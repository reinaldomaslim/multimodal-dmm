2
0:00:16.381,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So, embryonic stem cells

3
0:00:19.37,000 --> 0:00:22,000
are really incredible cells.

4
0:00:22.67,000 --> 0:00:24,000
They are our body's own repair kits,

5
0:00:25.458,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and they're pluripotent, which means they can morph into

6
0:00:28.422,000 --> 0:00:3,000
all of the cells in our bodies.

7
0:00:30.854,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Soon, we actually will be able to use stem cells

8
0:00:33.542,000 --> 0:00:35,000
to replace cells that are damaged or diseased.

9
0:00:36.527,000 --> 0:00:38,000
But that's not what I want to talk to you about,

10
0:00:38.958,000 --> 0:00:4,000
because right now there are some really

11
0:00:41.636,000 --> 0:00:44,000
extraordinary things that we are doing with stem cells

12
0:00:45.582,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that are completely changing

13
0:00:47.189,000 --> 0:00:49,000
the way we look and model disease,

14
0:00:50.088,000 --> 0:00:52,000
our ability to understand why we get sick,

15
0:00:52.607,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and even develop drugs.

16
0:00:55.038,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I truly believe that stem cell research is going to allow

17
0:00:59.351,000 --> 0:01:03,000
our children to look at Alzheimer's and diabetes

18
0:01:03.856,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and other major diseases the way we view polio today,

19
0:01:08.247,000 --> 0:01:11,000
which is as a preventable disease.

20
0:01:11.448,000 --> 0:01:14,000
So here we have this incredible field, which has

21
0:01:14.671,000 --> 0:01:18,000
enormous hope for humanity,

22
0:01:19.058,000 --> 0:01:22,000
but much like IVF over 35 years ago,

23
0:01:22.578,000 --> 0:01:24,000
until the birth of a healthy baby, Louise,

24
0:01:24.912,000 --> 0:01:29,000
this field has been under siege politically and financially.

25
0:01:29.981,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Critical research is being challenged instead of supported,

26
0:01:34.253,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and we saw that it was really essential to have

27
0:01:38.613,000 --> 0:01:41,000
private safe haven laboratories where this work

28
0:01:42.144,000 --> 0:01:44,000
could be advanced without interference.

29
0:01:44.974,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And so, in 2005,

30
0:01:47.505,000 --> 0:01:49,000
we started the New York Stem Cell Foundation Laboratory

31
0:01:50.117,000 --> 0:01:53,000
so that we would have a small organization that could

32
0:01:53.706,000 --> 0:01:56,000
do this work and support it.

33
0:01:57.018,000 --> 0:02:,000
What we saw very quickly is the world of both medical

34
0:02:00.403,000 --> 0:02:03,000
research, but also developing drugs and treatments,

35
0:02:03.779,000 --> 0:02:06,000
is dominated by, as you would expect, large organizations,

36
0:02:07.492,000 --> 0:02:1,000
but in a new field, sometimes large organizations

37
0:02:10.611,000 --> 0:02:12,000
really have trouble getting out of their own way,

38
0:02:12.779,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and sometimes they can't ask the right questions,

39
0:02:15.215,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and there is an enormous gap that's just gotten larger

40
0:02:18.571,000 --> 0:02:21,000
between academic research on the one hand

41
0:02:21.782,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and pharmaceutical companies and biotechs

42
0:02:24.483,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that are responsible for delivering all of our drugs

43
0:02:27.749,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and many of our treatments, and so we knew that

44
0:02:30.139,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to really accelerate cures and therapies, we were going

45
0:02:34.085,000 --> 0:02:36,000
to have to address this with two things:

46
0:02:36.892,000 --> 0:02:39,000
new technologies and also a new research model.

47
0:02:40.114,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Because if you don't close that gap, you really are

48
0:02:43.873,000 --> 0:02:44,000
exactly where we are today.

49
0:02:45.48,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And that's what I want to focus on.

50
0:02:47.147,000 --> 0:02:5,000
We've spent the last couple of years pondering this,

51
0:02:50.697,000 --> 0:02:52,000
making a list of the different things that we had to do,

52
0:02:53.088,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and so we developed a new technology,

53
0:02:55.719,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It's software and hardware,

54
0:02:56.97,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that actually can generate thousands and thousands of

55
0:03:00.473,000 --> 0:03:03,000
genetically diverse stem cell lines to create

56
0:03:03.643,000 --> 0:03:06,000
a global array, essentially avatars of ourselves.

57
0:03:07.43,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And we did this because we think that it's actually going

58
0:03:10.864,000 --> 0:03:13,000
to allow us to realize the potential, the promise,

59
0:03:14.279,000 --> 0:03:17,000
of all of the sequencing of the human genome,

60
0:03:17.359,000 --> 0:03:19,000
but it's going to allow us, in doing that,

61
0:03:19.863,000 --> 0:03:24,000
to actually do clinical trials in a dish with human cells,

62
0:03:24.871,000 --> 0:03:28,000
not animal cells, to generate drugs and treatments

63
0:03:29.03,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that are much more effective, much safer,

64
0:03:32.279,000 --> 0:03:35,000
much faster, and at a much lower cost.

65
0:03:35.535,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So let me put that in perspective for you

66
0:03:37.919,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and give you some context.

67
0:03:39.335,000 --> 0:03:43,000
This is an extremely new field.

68
0:03:44.167,000 --> 0:03:46,000
In 1998, human embryonic stem cells

69
0:03:46.999,000 --> 0:03:49,000
were first identified, and just nine years later,

70
0:03:50.511,000 --> 0:03:54,000
a group of scientists in Japan were able to take skin cells

71
0:03:54.816,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and reprogram them with very powerful viruses

72
0:03:58.011,000 --> 0:04:02,000
to create a kind of pluripotent stem cell

73
0:04:02.253,000 --> 0:04:04,000
called an induced pluripotent stem cell,

74
0:04:04.343,000 --> 0:04:07,000
or what we refer to as an IPS cell.

75
0:04:07.351,000 --> 0:04:1,000
This was really an extraordinary advance, because

76
0:04:10.549,000 --> 0:04:12,000
although these cells are not human embryonic stem cells,

77
0:04:13.093,000 --> 0:04:14,000
which still remain the gold standard,

78
0:04:14.887,000 --> 0:04:17,000
they are terrific to use for modeling disease

79
0:04:18.357,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and potentially for drug discovery.

80
0:04:21.087,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So a few months later, in 2008, one of our scientists

81
0:04:24.127,000 --> 0:04:27,000
built on that research. He took skin biopsies,

82
0:04:27.327,000 --> 0:04:29,000
this time from people who had a disease,

83
0:04:29.355,000 --> 0:04:31,000
ALS, or as you call it in the U.K., motor neuron disease.

84
0:04:32.269,000 --> 0:04:33,000
He turned them into the IPS cells

85
0:04:33.967,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that I've just told you about, and then he turned those

86
0:04:36.653,000 --> 0:04:38,000
IPS cells into the motor neurons that actually

87
0:04:39.357,000 --> 0:04:4,000
were dying in the disease.

88
0:04:40.818,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So basically what he did was to take a healthy cell

89
0:04:43.837,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and turn it into a sick cell,

90
0:04:45.551,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and he recapitulated the disease over and over again

91
0:04:49.109,000 --> 0:04:52,000
in the dish, and this was extraordinary,

92
0:04:52.469,000 --> 0:04:54,000
because it was the first time that we had a model

93
0:04:54.717,000 --> 0:04:58,000
of a disease from a living patient in living human cells.

94
0:04:58.905,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And as he watched the disease unfold, he was able

95
0:05:02.025,000 --> 0:05:05,000
to discover that actually the motor neurons were dying

96
0:05:05.036,000 --> 0:05:07,000
in the disease in a different way than the field

97
0:05:07.163,000 --> 0:05:09,000
had previously thought. There was another kind of cell

98
0:05:09.657,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that actually was sending out a toxin

99
0:05:11.858,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and contributing to the death of these motor neurons,

100
0:05:14.369,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and you simply couldn't see it

101
0:05:15.727,000 --> 0:05:16,000
until you had the human model.

102
0:05:17.517,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So you could really say that

103
0:05:20.184,000 --> 0:05:23,000
researchers trying to understand the cause of disease

104
0:05:24.09,000 --> 0:05:28,000
without being able to have human stem cell models

105
0:05:28.242,000 --> 0:05:3,000
were much like investigators trying to figure out

106
0:05:31.002,000 --> 0:05:34,000
what had gone terribly wrong in a plane crash

107
0:05:34.243,000 --> 0:05:37,000
without having a black box, or a flight recorder.

108
0:05:38.24,000 --> 0:05:4,000
They could hypothesize about what had gone wrong,

109
0:05:40.842,000 --> 0:05:43,000
but they really had no way of knowing what led

110
0:05:43.954,000 --> 0:05:45,000
to the terrible events.

111
0:05:46.126,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And stem cells really have given us the black box

112
0:05:50.309,000 --> 0:05:53,000
for diseases, and it's an unprecedented window.

113
0:05:54.277,000 --> 0:05:57,000
It really is extraordinary, because you can recapitulate

114
0:05:57.522,000 --> 0:06:,000
many, many diseases in a dish, you can see

115
0:06:00.769,000 --> 0:06:03,000
what begins to go wrong in the cellular conversation

116
0:06:04.305,000 --> 0:06:06,000
well before you would ever see

117
0:06:06.729,000 --> 0:06:08,000
symptoms appear in a patient.

118
0:06:09.265,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And this opens up the ability,

119
0:06:11.788,000 --> 0:06:13,000
which hopefully will become something that

120
0:06:14.602,000 --> 0:06:16,000
is routine in the near term,

121
0:06:17.249,000 --> 0:06:21,000
of using human cells to test for drugs.

122
0:06:21.395,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Right now, the way we test for drugs is pretty problematic.

123
0:06:26.859,000 --> 0:06:29,000
To bring a successful drug to market, it takes, on average,

124
0:06:30.177,000 --> 0:06:32,000
13 years — that's one drug —

125
0:06:32.363,000 --> 0:06:35,000
with a sunk cost of 4 billion dollars,

126
0:06:35.751,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and only one percent of the drugs that start down that road

127
0:06:40.618,000 --> 0:06:42,000
are actually going to get there.

128
0:06:42.866,000 --> 0:06:44,000
You can't imagine other businesses

129
0:06:44.991,000 --> 0:06:45,000
that you would think of going into

130
0:06:46.44,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that have these kind of numbers.

131
0:06:48.195,000 --> 0:06:49,000
It's a terrible business model.

132
0:06:49.997,000 --> 0:06:52,000
But it is really a worse social model because of

133
0:06:53.986,000 --> 0:06:56,000
what's involved and the cost to all of us.

134
0:06:57.314,000 --> 0:07:,000
So the way we develop drugs now

135
0:07:01.066,000 --> 0:07:04,000
is by testing promising compounds on --

136
0:07:04.266,000 --> 0:07:05,000
We didn't have disease modeling with human cells,

137
0:07:06.146,000 --> 0:07:09,000
so we'd been testing them on cells of mice

138
0:07:09.61,000 --> 0:07:12,000
or other creatures or cells that we engineer,

139
0:07:13.277,000 --> 0:07:16,000
but they don't have the characteristics of the diseases

140
0:07:16.338,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that we're actually trying to cure.

141
0:07:18.674,000 --> 0:07:21,000
You know, we're not mice, and you can't go into

142
0:07:21.72,000 --> 0:07:23,000
a living person with an illness

143
0:07:24.138,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and just pull out a few brain cells or cardiac cells

144
0:07:27.066,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and then start fooling around in a lab to test

145
0:07:29.355,000 --> 0:07:32,000
for, you know, a promising drug.

146
0:07:32.916,000 --> 0:07:35,000
But what you can do with human stem cells, now,

147
0:07:36.501,000 --> 0:07:4,000
is actually create avatars, and you can create the cells,

148
0:07:40.838,000 --> 0:07:41,000
whether it's the live motor neurons

149
0:07:42.805,000 --> 0:07:45,000
or the beating cardiac cells or liver cells

150
0:07:45.815,000 --> 0:07:49,000
or other kinds of cells, and you can test for drugs,

151
0:07:49.924,000 --> 0:07:52,000
promising compounds, on the actual cells

152
0:07:53.049,000 --> 0:07:56,000
that you're trying to affect, and this is now,

153
0:07:56.68,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and it's absolutely extraordinary,

154
0:07:59.494,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and you're going to know at the beginning,

155
0:08:02.65,000 --> 0:08:05,000
the very early stages of doing your assay development

156
0:08:06.394,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and your testing, you're not going to have to wait 13 years

157
0:08:09.783,000 --> 0:08:12,000
until you've brought a drug to market, only to find out

158
0:08:13.102,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that actually it doesn't work, or even worse, harms people.

159
0:08:18.158,000 --> 0:08:22,000
But it isn't really enough just to look at

160
0:08:22.498,000 --> 0:08:25,000
the cells from a few people or a small group of people,

161
0:08:26.28,000 --> 0:08:27,000
because we have to step back.

162
0:08:27.924,000 --> 0:08:28,000
We've got to look at the big picture.

163
0:08:29.775,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Look around this room. We are all different,

164
0:08:32.911,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and a disease that I might have,

165
0:08:35.651,000 --> 0:08:37,000
if I had Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease,

166
0:08:38.528,000 --> 0:08:41,000
it probably would affect me differently than if

167
0:08:42.294,000 --> 0:08:43,000
one of you had that disease,

168
0:08:43.935,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and if we both had Parkinson's disease,

169
0:08:48.28,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and we took the same medication,

170
0:08:50.548,000 --> 0:08:52,000
but we had different genetic makeup,

171
0:08:53.295,000 --> 0:08:55,000
we probably would have a different result,

172
0:08:55.58,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and it could well be that a drug that worked wonderfully

173
0:08:59.311,000 --> 0:09:02,000
for me was actually ineffective for you,

174
0:09:02.89,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and similarly, it could be that a drug that is harmful for you

175
0:09:07.582,000 --> 0:09:11,000
is safe for me, and, you know, this seems totally obvious,

176
0:09:11.884,000 --> 0:09:13,000
but unfortunately it is not the way

177
0:09:14.612,000 --> 0:09:17,000
that the pharmaceutical industry has been developing drugs

178
0:09:17.798,000 --> 0:09:2,000
because, until now, it hasn't had the tools.

179
0:09:21.784,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And so we need to move away

180
0:09:24.076,000 --> 0:09:26,000
from this one-size-fits-all model.

181
0:09:27.03,000 --> 0:09:3,000
The way we've been developing drugs is essentially

182
0:09:30.207,000 --> 0:09:31,000
like going into a shoe store,

183
0:09:31.586,000 --> 0:09:33,000
no one asks you what size you are, or

184
0:09:33.869,000 --> 0:09:35,000
if you're going dancing or hiking.

185
0:09:36.079,000 --> 0:09:38,000
They just say, "Well, you have feet, here are your shoes."

186
0:09:38.887,000 --> 0:09:41,000
It doesn't work with shoes, and our bodies are

187
0:09:42.487,000 --> 0:09:45,000
many times more complicated than just our feet.

188
0:09:45.959,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So we really have to change this.

189
0:09:48.5,000 --> 0:09:53,000
There was a very sad example of this in the last decade.

190
0:09:53.684,000 --> 0:09:55,000
There's a wonderful drug, and a class of drugs actually,

191
0:09:56.332,000 --> 0:09:58,000
but the particular drug was Vioxx, and

192
0:09:59.012,000 --> 0:10:03,000
for people who were suffering from severe arthritis pain,

193
0:10:03.388,000 --> 0:10:06,000
the drug was an absolute lifesaver,

194
0:10:06.78,000 --> 0:10:11,000
but unfortunately, for another subset of those people,

195
0:10:11.86,000 --> 0:10:15,000
they suffered pretty severe heart side effects,

196
0:10:16.629,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and for a subset of those people, the side effects were

197
0:10:19.357,000 --> 0:10:22,000
so severe, the cardiac side effects, that they were fatal.

198
0:10:23.254,000 --> 0:10:27,000
But imagine a different scenario,

199
0:10:27.296,000 --> 0:10:31,000
where we could have had an array, a genetically diverse array,

200
0:10:31.598,000 --> 0:10:34,000
of cardiac cells, and we could have actually tested

201
0:10:35.224,000 --> 0:10:4,000
that drug, Vioxx, in petri dishes, and figured out,

202
0:10:40.305,000 --> 0:10:43,000
well, okay, people with this genetic type are going to have

203
0:10:44.049,000 --> 0:10:49,000
cardiac side effects, people with these genetic subgroups

204
0:10:49.049,000 --> 0:10:54,000
or genetic shoes sizes, about 25,000 of them,

205
0:10:54.193,000 --> 0:10:56,000
are not going to have any problems.

206
0:10:56.953,000 --> 0:10:58,000
The people for whom it was a lifesaver

207
0:10:59.568,000 --> 0:11:,000
could have still taken their medicine.

208
0:11:01.245,000 --> 0:11:05,000
The people for whom it was a disaster, or fatal,

209
0:11:05.631,000 --> 0:11:07,000
would never have been given it, and

210
0:11:07.722,000 --> 0:11:09,000
you can imagine a very different outcome for the company,

211
0:11:10.305,000 --> 0:11:12,000
who had to withdraw the drug.

212
0:11:13.073,000 --> 0:11:15,000
So that is terrific,

213
0:11:15.889,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and we thought, all right,

214
0:11:17.723,000 --> 0:11:19,000
as we're trying to solve this problem,

215
0:11:20.482,000 --> 0:11:22,000
clearly we have to think about genetics,

216
0:11:22.679,000 --> 0:11:24,000
we have to think about human testing,

217
0:11:25.513,000 --> 0:11:26,000
but there's a fundamental problem,

218
0:11:27.092,000 --> 0:11:29,000
because right now, stem cell lines,

219
0:11:29.791,000 --> 0:11:3,000
as extraordinary as they are,

220
0:11:31.501,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and lines are just groups of cells,

221
0:11:33.245,000 --> 0:11:37,000
they are made by hand, one at a time,

222
0:11:37.577,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and it takes a couple of months.

223
0:11:39.801,000 --> 0:11:43,000
This is not scalable, and also when you do things by hand,

224
0:11:44.167,000 --> 0:11:45,000
even in the best laboratories,

225
0:11:45.71,000 --> 0:11:48,000
you have variations in techniques,

226
0:11:48.871,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and you need to know, if you're making a drug,

227
0:11:52.052,000 --> 0:11:53,000
that the Aspirin you're going to take out of the bottle

228
0:11:53.95,000 --> 0:11:55,000
on Monday is the same as the Aspirin

229
0:11:56.39,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that's going to come out of the bottle on Wednesday.

230
0:11:58.471,000 --> 0:12:01,000
So we looked at this, and we thought, okay,

231
0:12:02.262,000 --> 0:12:05,000
artisanal is wonderful in, you know, your clothing

232
0:12:05.414,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and your bread and crafts, but

233
0:12:08.358,000 --> 0:12:1,000
artisanal really isn't going to work in stem cells,

234
0:12:11.341,000 --> 0:12:13,000
so we have to deal with this.

235
0:12:13.731,000 --> 0:12:16,000
But even with that, there still was another big hurdle,

236
0:12:17.651,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and that actually brings us back to

237
0:12:21.215,000 --> 0:12:23,000
the mapping of the human genome, because

238
0:12:23.599,000 --> 0:12:25,000
we're all different.

239
0:12:26.31,000 --> 0:12:28,000
We know from the sequencing of the human genome

240
0:12:29.142,000 --> 0:12:31,000
that it's shown us all of the A's, C's, G's and T's

241
0:12:31.699,000 --> 0:12:33,000
that make up our genetic code,

242
0:12:34.167,000 --> 0:12:38,000
but that code, by itself, our DNA,

243
0:12:38.436,000 --> 0:12:42,000
is like looking at the ones and zeroes of the computer code

244
0:12:43.035,000 --> 0:12:45,000
without having a computer that can read it.

245
0:12:45.86,000 --> 0:12:48,000
It's like having an app without having a smartphone.

246
0:12:49.148,000 --> 0:12:52,000
We needed to have a way of bringing the biology

247
0:12:53.032,000 --> 0:12:55,000
to that incredible data,

248
0:12:55.241,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and the way to do that was to find

249
0:12:58.356,000 --> 0:13:,000
a stand-in, a biological stand-in,

250
0:13:01.043,000 --> 0:13:05,000
that could contain all of the genetic information,

251
0:13:05.068,000 --> 0:13:07,000
but have it be arrayed in such a way

252
0:13:07.596,000 --> 0:13:09,000
as it could be read together

253
0:13:10.46,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and actually create this incredible avatar.

254
0:13:13.716,000 --> 0:13:16,000
We need to have stem cells from all the genetic sub-types

255
0:13:17.42,000 --> 0:13:19,000
that represent who we are.

256
0:13:20.372,000 --> 0:13:22,000
So this is what we've built.

257
0:13:23.132,000 --> 0:13:26,000
It's an automated robotic technology.

258
0:13:26.452,000 --> 0:13:28,000
It has the capacity to produce thousands and thousands

259
0:13:29.06,000 --> 0:13:33,000
of stem cell lines. It's genetically arrayed.

260
0:13:33.299,000 --> 0:13:36,000
It has massively parallel processing capability,

261
0:13:37.048,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and it's going to change the way drugs are discovered,

262
0:13:40.368,000 --> 0:13:43,000
we hope, and I think eventually what's going to happen

263
0:13:44.203,000 --> 0:13:46,000
is that we're going to want to re-screen drugs,

264
0:13:46.402,000 --> 0:13:48,000
on arrays like this, that already exist,

265
0:13:48.893,000 --> 0:13:49,000
all of the drugs that currently exist,

266
0:13:50.764,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and in the future, you're going to be taking drugs

267
0:13:53.675,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and treatments that have been tested for side effects

268
0:13:56.547,000 --> 0:13:58,000
on all of the relevant cells,

269
0:13:58.85,000 --> 0:14:01,000
on brain cells and heart cells and liver cells.

270
0:14:02.003,000 --> 0:14:05,000
It really has brought us to the threshold

271
0:14:05.332,000 --> 0:14:07,000
of personalized medicine.

272
0:14:07.546,000 --> 0:14:11,000
It's here now, and in our family,

273
0:14:11.987,000 --> 0:14:13,000
my son has type 1 diabetes,

274
0:14:14.925,000 --> 0:14:16,000
which is still an incurable disease,

275
0:14:17.573,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and I lost my parents to heart disease and cancer,

276
0:14:21.015,000 --> 0:14:24,000
but I think that my story probably sounds familiar to you,

277
0:14:24.748,000 --> 0:14:28,000
because probably a version of it is your story.

278
0:14:28.978,000 --> 0:14:31,000
At some point in our lives, all of us,

279
0:14:32.922,000 --> 0:14:34,000
or people we care about, become patients,

280
0:14:35.658,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and that's why I think that stem cell research

281
0:14:38.267,000 --> 0:14:41,000
is incredibly important for all of us.

282
0:14:41.65,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Thank you. (Applause)

283
0:14:45.318,000 --> 0:14:52,000
(Applause)

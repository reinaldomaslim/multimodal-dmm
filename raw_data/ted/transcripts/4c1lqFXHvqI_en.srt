1
0:00:12.973,000 --> 0:00:16,000
We are built out of very small stuff,

2
0:00:17.516,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and we are embedded in a very large cosmos,

3
0:00:20.031,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and the fact is that we are not very good at understanding reality

4
0:00:24.582,000 --> 0:00:25,000
at either of those scales,

5
0:00:26.161,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and that's because our brains

6
0:00:27.763,000 --> 0:00:31,000
haven't evolved to understand the world at that scale.

7
0:00:32.157,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Instead, we're trapped on this very thin slice of perception

8
0:00:36.377,000 --> 0:00:37,000
right in the middle.

9
0:00:38.723,000 --> 0:00:42,000
But it gets strange, because even at that slice of reality that we call home,

10
0:00:43.191,000 --> 0:00:45,000
we're not seeing most of the action that's going on.

11
0:00:46.176,000 --> 0:00:49,000
So take the colors of our world.

12
0:00:49.566,000 --> 0:00:53,000
This is light waves, electromagnetic radiation that bounces off objects

13
0:00:54.279,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and it hits specialized receptors in the back of our eyes.

14
0:00:57.716,000 --> 0:01:,000
But we're not seeing all the waves out there.

15
0:01:01.361,000 --> 0:01:02,000
In fact, what we see

16
0:01:03.056,000 --> 0:01:07,000
is less than a 10 trillionth of what's out there.

17
0:01:07.119,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So you have radio waves and microwaves

18
0:01:10.486,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and X-rays and gamma rays passing through your body right now

19
0:01:13.783,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and you're completely unaware of it,

20
0:01:16.732,000 --> 0:01:19,000
because you don't come with the proper biological receptors

21
0:01:19.913,000 --> 0:01:2,000
for picking it up.

22
0:01:21.631,000 --> 0:01:23,000
There are thousands of cell phone conversations

23
0:01:24.198,000 --> 0:01:25,000
passing through you right now,

24
0:01:25.754,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and you're utterly blind to it.

25
0:01:28.055,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Now, it's not that these things are inherently unseeable.

26
0:01:31.953,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Snakes include some infrared in their reality,

27
0:01:36.852,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and honeybees include ultraviolet in their view of the world,

28
0:01:40.73,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and of course we build machines in the dashboards of our cars

29
0:01:43.655,000 --> 0:01:46,000
to pick up on signals in the radio frequency range,

30
0:01:46.883,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and we built machines in hospitals to pick up on the X-ray range.

31
0:01:50.575,000 --> 0:01:53,000
But you can't sense any of those by yourself,

32
0:01:53.965,000 --> 0:01:54,000
at least not yet,

33
0:01:55.474,000 --> 0:01:58,000
because you don't come equipped with the proper sensors.

34
0:01:59.421,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Now, what this means is that our experience of reality

35
0:02:03.902,000 --> 0:02:06,000
is constrained by our biology,

36
0:02:07.362,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and that goes against the common sense notion

37
0:02:09.916,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that our eyes and our ears and our fingertips

38
0:02:12.179,000 --> 0:02:16,000
are just picking up the objective reality that's out there.

39
0:02:16.394,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Instead, our brains are sampling just a little bit of the world.

40
0:02:22.013,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Now, across the animal kingdom,

41
0:02:24.08,000 --> 0:02:27,000
different animals pick up on different parts of reality.

42
0:02:27.4,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So in the blind and deaf world of the tick,

43
0:02:30.349,000 --> 0:02:34,000
the important signals are temperature and butyric acid;

44
0:02:34.83,000 --> 0:02:36,000
in the world of the black ghost knifefish,

45
0:02:37.756,000 --> 0:02:41,000
its sensory world is lavishly colored by electrical fields;

46
0:02:42.655,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and for the echolocating bat,

47
0:02:45.116,000 --> 0:02:49,000
its reality is constructed out of air compression waves.

48
0:02:49.156,000 --> 0:02:53,000
That's the slice of their ecosystem that they can pick up on,

49
0:02:53.521,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and we have a word for this in science.

50
0:02:55.403,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It's called the umwelt,

51
0:02:56.911,000 --> 0:02:59,000
which is the German word for the surrounding world.

52
0:03:00.603,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Now, presumably, every animal assumes

53
0:03:03.598,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that its umwelt is the entire objective reality out there,

54
0:03:07.987,000 --> 0:03:09,000
because why would you ever stop to imagine

55
0:03:10.281,000 --> 0:03:12,000
that there's something beyond what we can sense.

56
0:03:13.412,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Instead, what we all do is we accept reality

57
0:03:16.126,000 --> 0:03:18,000
as it's presented to us.

58
0:03:19.222,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Let's do a consciousness-raiser on this.

59
0:03:21.717,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Imagine that you are a bloodhound dog.

60
0:03:24.973,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Your whole world is about smelling.

61
0:03:27.178,000 --> 0:03:31,000
You've got a long snout that has 200 million scent receptors in it,

62
0:03:31.59,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and you have wet nostrils that attract and trap scent molecules,

63
0:03:36.094,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and your nostrils even have slits so you can take big nosefuls of air.

64
0:03:40.088,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Everything is about smell for you.

65
0:03:43.362,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So one day, you stop in your tracks with a revelation.

66
0:03:47.263,000 --> 0:03:5,000
You look at your human owner and you think,

67
0:03:50.583,000 --> 0:03:54,000
"What is it like to have the pitiful, impoverished nose of a human?

68
0:03:55.393,000 --> 0:03:56,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:57.083,000 --> 0:04:,000
What is it like when you take a feeble little noseful of air?

70
0:04:00.335,000 --> 0:04:04,000
How can you not know that there's a cat 100 yards away,

71
0:04:04.384,000 --> 0:04:07,000
or that your neighbor was on this very spot six hours ago?"

72
0:04:07.718,000 --> 0:04:09,000
(Laughter)

73
0:04:10.458,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So because we're humans,

74
0:04:12.757,000 --> 0:04:14,000
we've never experienced that world of smell,

75
0:04:15.404,000 --> 0:04:17,000
so we don't miss it,

76
0:04:18.083,000 --> 0:04:22,000
because we are firmly settled into our umwelt.

77
0:04:22.114,000 --> 0:04:25,000
But the question is, do we have to be stuck there?

78
0:04:26.317,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So as a neuroscientist, I'm interested in the way that technology

79
0:04:30.845,000 --> 0:04:32,000
might expand our umwelt,

80
0:04:33.468,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and how that's going to change the experience of being human.

81
0:04:38.228,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So we already know that we can marry our technology to our biology,

82
0:04:41.781,000 --> 0:04:44,000
because there are hundreds of thousands of people walking around

83
0:04:45.565,000 --> 0:04:48,000
with artificial hearing and artificial vision.

84
0:04:49.164,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So the way this works is, you take a microphone and you digitize the signal,

85
0:04:53.553,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and you put an electrode strip directly into the inner ear.

86
0:04:57.291,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Or, with the retinal implant, you take a camera

87
0:04:59.59,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and you digitize the signal, and then you plug an electrode grid

88
0:05:02.864,000 --> 0:05:05,000
directly into the optic nerve.

89
0:05:05.882,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And as recently as 15 years ago,

90
0:05:09.806,000 --> 0:05:12,000
there were a lot of scientists who thought these technologies wouldn't work.

91
0:05:13.544,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Why? It's because these technologies speak the language of Silicon Valley,

92
0:05:18.723,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and it's not exactly the same dialect as our natural biological sense organs.

93
0:05:24.295,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But the fact is that it works;

94
0:05:26.71,000 --> 0:05:3,000
the brain figures out how to use the signals just fine.

95
0:05:31.719,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Now, how do we understand that?

96
0:05:33.763,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Well, here's the big secret:

97
0:05:35.458,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Your brain is not hearing or seeing any of this.

98
0:05:40.728,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Your brain is locked in a vault of silence and darkness inside your skull.

99
0:05:47.183,000 --> 0:05:5,000
All it ever sees are electrochemical signals

100
0:05:50.991,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that come in along different data cables,

101
0:05:53.54,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and this is all it has to work with, and nothing more.

102
0:05:58.672,000 --> 0:06:,000
Now, amazingly,

103
0:06:00.924,000 --> 0:06:02,000
the brain is really good at taking in these signals

104
0:06:03.687,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and extracting patterns and assigning meaning,

105
0:06:07.238,000 --> 0:06:11,000
so that it takes this inner cosmos and puts together a story

106
0:06:11.292,000 --> 0:06:15,000
of this, your subjective world.

107
0:06:16.179,000 --> 0:06:17,000
But here's the key point:

108
0:06:18.129,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Your brain doesn't know, and it doesn't care,

109
0:06:21.519,000 --> 0:06:24,000
where it gets the data from.

110
0:06:24.561,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Whatever information comes in, it just figures out what to do with it.

111
0:06:29.414,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And this is a very efficient kind of machine.

112
0:06:31.852,000 --> 0:06:35,000
It's essentially a general purpose computing device,

113
0:06:36.008,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and it just takes in everything

114
0:06:38.423,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and figures out what it's going to do with it,

115
0:06:41.023,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and that, I think, frees up Mother Nature

116
0:06:44.669,000 --> 0:06:48,000
to tinker around with different sorts of input channels.

117
0:06:49.452,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So I call this the P.H. model of evolution,

118
0:06:52.284,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and I don't want to get too technical here,

119
0:06:54.328,000 --> 0:06:57,000
but P.H. stands for Potato Head,

120
0:06:57.369,000 --> 0:07:,000
and I use this name to emphasize that all these sensors

121
0:07:01.2,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that we know and love, like our eyes and our ears and our fingertips,

122
0:07:04.451,000 --> 0:07:08,000
these are merely peripheral plug-and-play devices:

123
0:07:08.77,000 --> 0:07:11,000
You stick them in, and you're good to go.

124
0:07:12.044,000 --> 0:07:17,000
The brain figures out what to do with the data that comes in.

125
0:07:18.243,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And when you look across the animal kingdom,

126
0:07:20.449,000 --> 0:07:22,000
you find lots of peripheral devices.

127
0:07:23.096,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So snakes have heat pits with which to detect infrared,

128
0:07:27.206,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and the ghost knifefish has electroreceptors,

129
0:07:30.456,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and the star-nosed mole has this appendage

130
0:07:33.057,000 --> 0:07:35,000
with 22 fingers on it

131
0:07:35.704,000 --> 0:07:38,000
with which it feels around and constructs a 3D model of the world,

132
0:07:39.373,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and many birds have magnetite so they can orient

133
0:07:43.297,000 --> 0:07:45,000
to the magnetic field of the planet.

134
0:07:45.792,000 --> 0:07:48,000
So what this means is that nature doesn't have to continually

135
0:07:49.664,000 --> 0:07:51,000
redesign the brain.

136
0:07:52.079,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Instead, with the principles of brain operation established,

137
0:07:56.56,000 --> 0:08:,000
all nature has to worry about is designing new peripherals.

138
0:08:01.239,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Okay. So what this means is this:

139
0:08:04.164,000 --> 0:08:06,000
The lesson that surfaces

140
0:08:06.184,000 --> 0:08:09,000
is that there's nothing really special or fundamental

141
0:08:09.853,000 --> 0:08:11,000
about the biology that we come to the table with.

142
0:08:12.848,000 --> 0:08:14,000
It's just what we have inherited

143
0:08:14.915,000 --> 0:08:17,000
from a complex road of evolution.

144
0:08:18.142,000 --> 0:08:21,000
But it's not what we have to stick with,

145
0:08:21.671,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and our best proof of principle of this

146
0:08:23.715,000 --> 0:08:25,000
comes from what's called sensory substitution.

147
0:08:26.315,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And that refers to feeding information into the brain

148
0:08:29.543,000 --> 0:08:31,000
via unusual sensory channels,

149
0:08:32.329,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and the brain just figures out what to do with it.

150
0:08:35.208,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Now, that might sound speculative,

151
0:08:37.669,000 --> 0:08:41,000
but the first paper demonstrating this was published in the journal Nature in 1969.

152
0:08:43.985,000 --> 0:08:45,000
So a scientist named Paul Bach-y-Rita

153
0:08:46.353,000 --> 0:08:49,000
put blind people in a modified dental chair,

154
0:08:49.581,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and he set up a video feed,

155
0:08:51.926,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and he put something in front of the camera,

156
0:08:54.178,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and then you would feel that

157
0:08:56.639,000 --> 0:08:58,000
poked into your back with a grid of solenoids.

158
0:08:59.565,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So if you wiggle a coffee cup in front of the camera,

159
0:09:02.049,000 --> 0:09:04,000
you're feeling that in your back,

160
0:09:04.394,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and amazingly, blind people got pretty good

161
0:09:07.482,000 --> 0:09:1,000
at being able to determine what was in front of the camera

162
0:09:11.035,000 --> 0:09:14,000
just by feeling it in the small of their back.

163
0:09:14.82,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Now, there have been many modern incarnations of this.

164
0:09:18.326,000 --> 0:09:21,000
The sonic glasses take a video feed right in front of you

165
0:09:21.6,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and turn that into a sonic landscape,

166
0:09:24.455,000 --> 0:09:26,000
so as things move around, and get closer and farther,

167
0:09:26.956,000 --> 0:09:28,000
it sounds like "Bzz, bzz, bzz."

168
0:09:29.03,000 --> 0:09:3,000
It sounds like a cacophony,

169
0:09:31.003,000 --> 0:09:34,000
but after several weeks, blind people start getting pretty good

170
0:09:34.997,000 --> 0:09:36,000
at understanding what's in front of them

171
0:09:37.319,000 --> 0:09:39,000
just based on what they're hearing.

172
0:09:39.966,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And it doesn't have to be through the ears:

173
0:09:41.99,000 --> 0:09:44,000
this system uses an electrotactile grid on the forehead,

174
0:09:45.354,000 --> 0:09:48,000
so whatever's in front of the video feed, you're feeling it on your forehead.

175
0:09:49.044,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Why the forehead? Because you're not using it for much else.

176
0:09:51.897,000 --> 0:09:55,000
The most modern incarnation is called the brainport,

177
0:09:56.103,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and this is a little electrogrid that sits on your tongue,

178
0:09:59.852,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and the video feed gets turned into these little electrotactile signals,

179
0:10:03.968,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and blind people get so good at using this that they can throw a ball into a basket,

180
0:10:10.455,000 --> 0:10:14,000
or they can navigate complex obstacle courses.

181
0:10:15.311,000 --> 0:10:19,000
They can come to see through their tongue.

182
0:10:19.525,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Now, that sounds completely insane, right?

183
0:10:21.731,000 --> 0:10:23,000
But remember, all vision ever is

184
0:10:24.54,000 --> 0:10:28,000
is electrochemical signals coursing around in your brain.

185
0:10:28.557,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Your brain doesn't know where the signals come from.

186
0:10:31.251,000 --> 0:10:34,000
It just figures out what to do with them.

187
0:10:34.687,000 --> 0:10:39,000
So my interest in my lab is sensory substitution for the deaf,

188
0:10:40.493,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and this is a project I've undertaken

189
0:10:43.232,000 --> 0:10:45,000
with a graduate student in my lab, Scott Novich,

190
0:10:46.227,000 --> 0:10:48,000
who is spearheading this for his thesis.

191
0:10:48.526,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And here is what we wanted to do:

192
0:10:50.522,000 --> 0:10:53,000
we wanted to make it so that sound from the world gets converted

193
0:10:54.516,000 --> 0:10:58,000
in some way so that a deaf person can understand what is being said.

194
0:10:59.392,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And we wanted to do this, given the power and ubiquity of portable computing,

195
0:11:03.92,000 --> 0:11:07,000
we wanted to make sure that this would run on cell phones and tablets,

196
0:11:08.796,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and also we wanted to make this a wearable,

197
0:11:11.094,000 --> 0:11:14,000
something that you could wear under your clothing.

198
0:11:14.136,000 --> 0:11:15,000
So here's the concept.

199
0:11:17.326,000 --> 0:11:22,000
So as I'm speaking, my sound is getting captured by the tablet,

200
0:11:22.402,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and then it's getting mapped onto a vest that's covered in vibratory motors,

201
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
just like the motors in your cell phone.

202
0:11:31.597,000 --> 0:11:33,000
So as I'm speaking,

203
0:11:33.988,000 --> 0:11:39,000
the sound is getting translated to a pattern of vibration on the vest.

204
0:11:40.327,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Now, this is not just conceptual:

205
0:11:41.906,000 --> 0:11:46,000
this tablet is transmitting Bluetooth, and I'm wearing the vest right now.

206
0:11:47.014,000 --> 0:11:49,000
So as I'm speaking -- (Applause) --

207
0:11:50.033,000 --> 0:11:55,000
the sound is getting translated into dynamic patterns of vibration.

208
0:11:55.966,000 --> 0:12:,000
I'm feeling the sonic world around me.

209
0:12:01.34,000 --> 0:12:05,000
So, we've been testing this with deaf people now,

210
0:12:05.404,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and it turns out that after just a little bit of time,

211
0:12:08.91,000 --> 0:12:11,000
people can start feeling, they can start understanding

212
0:12:12.3,000 --> 0:12:14,000
the language of the vest.

213
0:12:14.97,000 --> 0:12:18,000
So this is Jonathan. He's 37 years old. He has a master's degree.

214
0:12:19.753,000 --> 0:12:21,000
He was born profoundly deaf,

215
0:12:22.098,000 --> 0:12:26,000
which means that there's a part of his umwelt that's unavailable to him.

216
0:12:26.208,000 --> 0:12:3,000
So we had Jonathan train with the vest for four days, two hours a day,

217
0:12:30.596,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and here he is on the fifth day.

218
0:12:33.876,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Scott Novich: You.

219
0:12:36.012,000 --> 0:12:39,000
David Eagleman: So Scott says a word, Jonathan feels it on the vest,

220
0:12:39.226,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and he writes it on the board.

221
0:12:42.282,000 --> 0:12:45,000
SN: Where. Where.

222
0:12:46.168,000 --> 0:12:49,000
DE: Jonathan is able to translate this complicated pattern of vibrations

223
0:12:49.805,000 --> 0:12:51,000
into an understanding of what's being said.

224
0:12:52.684,000 --> 0:12:55,000
SN: Touch. Touch.

225
0:12:56.283,000 --> 0:13:,000
DE: Now, he's not doing this --

226
0:13:00.723,000 --> 0:13:06,000
(Applause) --

227
0:13:07.944,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Jonathan is not doing this consciously, because the patterns are too complicated,

228
0:13:12.03,000 --> 0:13:17,000
but his brain is starting to unlock the pattern that allows it to figure out

229
0:13:17.51,000 --> 0:13:19,000
what the data mean,

230
0:13:19.786,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and our expectation is that, after wearing this for about three months,

231
0:13:23.988,000 --> 0:13:27,000
he will have a direct perceptual experience of hearing

232
0:13:28.586,000 --> 0:13:32,000
in the same way that when a blind person passes a finger over braille,

233
0:13:32.765,000 --> 0:13:37,000
the meaning comes directly off the page without any conscious intervention at all.

234
0:13:38.941,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Now, this technology has the potential to be a game-changer,

235
0:13:42.494,000 --> 0:13:45,000
because the only other solution for deafness is a cochlear implant,

236
0:13:46.278,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and that requires an invasive surgery.

237
0:13:49.181,000 --> 0:13:54,000
And this can be built for 40 times cheaper than a cochlear implant,

238
0:13:54.335,000 --> 0:13:58,000
which opens up this technology globally, even for the poorest countries.

239
0:14:00.052,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Now, we've been very encouraged by our results with sensory substitution,

240
0:14:05.171,000 --> 0:14:09,000
but what we've been thinking a lot about is sensory addition.

241
0:14:09.374,000 --> 0:14:14,000
How could we use a technology like this to add a completely new kind of sense,

242
0:14:14.803,000 --> 0:14:17,000
to expand the human umvelt?

243
0:14:17.937,000 --> 0:14:21,000
For example, could we feed real-time data from the Internet

244
0:14:22.186,000 --> 0:14:23,000
directly into somebody's brain,

245
0:14:24.067,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and can they develop a direct perceptual experience?

246
0:14:27.945,000 --> 0:14:29,000
So here's an experiment we're doing in the lab.

247
0:14:30.482,000 --> 0:14:33,000
A subject is feeling a real-time streaming feed from the Net of data

248
0:14:34.376,000 --> 0:14:35,000
for five seconds.

249
0:14:36.187,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Then, two buttons appear, and he has to make a choice.

250
0:14:39.456,000 --> 0:14:4,000
He doesn't know what's going on.

251
0:14:41.145,000 --> 0:14:43,000
He makes a choice, and he gets feedback after one second.

252
0:14:43.841,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Now, here's the thing:

253
0:14:45.046,000 --> 0:14:47,000
The subject has no idea what all the patterns mean,

254
0:14:47.69,000 --> 0:14:5,000
but we're seeing if he gets better at figuring out which button to press.

255
0:14:51.361,000 --> 0:14:53,000
He doesn't know that what we're feeding

256
0:14:53.428,000 --> 0:14:56,000
is real-time data from the stock market,

257
0:14:56.609,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and he's making buy and sell decisions.

258
0:14:59.116,000 --> 0:15:,000
(Laughter)

259
0:15:01.49,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And the feedback is telling him whether he did the right thing or not.

260
0:15:04.792,000 --> 0:15:06,000
And what we're seeing is, can we expand the human umvelt

261
0:15:07.661,000 --> 0:15:09,000
so that he comes to have, after several weeks,

262
0:15:10.656,000 --> 0:15:16,000
a direct perceptual experience of the economic movements of the planet.

263
0:15:16.763,000 --> 0:15:19,000
So we'll report on that later to see how well this goes.

264
0:15:20.129,000 --> 0:15:21,000
(Laughter)

265
0:15:22.73,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Here's another thing we're doing:

266
0:15:24.82,000 --> 0:15:28,000
During the talks this morning, we've been automatically scraping Twitter

267
0:15:29.417,000 --> 0:15:31,000
for the TED2015 hashtag,

268
0:15:31.855,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and we've been doing an automated sentiment analysis,

269
0:15:34.548,000 --> 0:15:38,000
which means, are people using positive words or negative words or neutral?

270
0:15:39.123,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And while this has been going on,

271
0:15:41.567,000 --> 0:15:43,000
I have been feeling this,

272
0:15:44.562,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and so I am plugged in to the aggregate emotion

273
0:15:48.835,000 --> 0:15:52,000
of thousands of people in real time,

274
0:15:52.991,000 --> 0:15:55,000
and that's a new kind of human experience, because now I can know

275
0:15:56.729,000 --> 0:15:59,000
how everyone's doing and how much you're loving this.

276
0:16:00.026,000 --> 0:16:05,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

277
0:16:06.899,000 --> 0:16:1,000
It's a bigger experience than a human can normally have.

278
0:16:11.845,000 --> 0:16:13,000
We're also expanding the umvelt of pilots.

279
0:16:14.538,000 --> 0:16:18,000
So in this case, the vest is streaming nine different measures

280
0:16:18.624,000 --> 0:16:19,000
from this quadcopter,

281
0:16:20.25,000 --> 0:16:23,000
so pitch and yaw and roll and orientation and heading,

282
0:16:23.617,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and that improves this pilot's ability to fly it.

283
0:16:27.703,000 --> 0:16:32,000
It's essentially like he's extending his skin up there, far away.

284
0:16:32.998,000 --> 0:16:33,000
And that's just the beginning.

285
0:16:34.553,000 --> 0:16:39,000
What we're envisioning is taking a modern cockpit full of gauges

286
0:16:40.357,000 --> 0:16:44,000
and instead of trying to read the whole thing, you feel it.

287
0:16:44.908,000 --> 0:16:46,000
We live in a world of information now,

288
0:16:47.393,000 --> 0:16:5,000
and there is a difference between accessing big data

289
0:16:51.201,000 --> 0:16:54,000
and experiencing it.

290
0:16:54.289,000 --> 0:16:57,000
So I think there's really no end to the possibilities

291
0:16:58.114,000 --> 0:17:,000
on the horizon for human expansion.

292
0:17:00.436,000 --> 0:17:04,000
Just imagine an astronaut being able to feel

293
0:17:05.358,000 --> 0:17:08,000
the overall health of the International Space Station,

294
0:17:08.679,000 --> 0:17:12,000
or, for that matter, having you feel the invisible states of your own health,

295
0:17:13.555,000 --> 0:17:16,000
like your blood sugar and the state of your microbiome,

296
0:17:17.494,000 --> 0:17:22,000
or having 360-degree vision or seeing in infrared or ultraviolet.

297
0:17:23.121,000 --> 0:17:26,000
So the key is this: As we move into the future,

298
0:17:26.616,000 --> 0:17:3,000
we're going to increasingly be able to choose our own peripheral devices.

299
0:17:31.515,000 --> 0:17:34,000
We no longer have to wait for Mother Nature's sensory gifts

300
0:17:35.369,000 --> 0:17:36,000
on her timescales,

301
0:17:37.227,000 --> 0:17:41,000
but instead, like any good parent, she's given us the tools that we need

302
0:17:41.499,000 --> 0:17:45,000
to go out and define our own trajectory.

303
0:17:45.632,000 --> 0:17:46,000
So the question now is,

304
0:17:47.373,000 --> 0:17:52,000
how do you want to go out and experience your universe?

305
0:17:52.598,000 --> 0:17:54,000
Thank you.

306
0:17:54.641,000 --> 0:18:02,000

307
0:18:11.365,000 --> 0:18:13,000
Chris Anderson: Can you feel it? DE: Yeah.

308
0:18:13.553,000 --> 0:18:16,000
Actually, this was the first time I felt applause on the vest.

309
0:18:16.943,000 --> 0:18:18,000
It's nice. It's like a massage. (Laughter)

310
0:18:19.102,000 --> 0:18:22,000
CA: Twitter's going crazy. Twitter's going mad.

311
0:18:22.747,000 --> 0:18:24,000
So that stock market experiment.

312
0:18:25.04,000 --> 0:18:29,000
This could be the first experiment that secures its funding forevermore,

313
0:18:29.568,000 --> 0:18:3,000
right, if successful?

314
0:18:31.563,000 --> 0:18:34,000
DE: Well, that's right, I wouldn't have to write to NIH anymore.

315
0:18:34.715,000 --> 0:18:36,000
CA: Well look, just to be skeptical for a minute,

316
0:18:37.532,000 --> 0:18:4,000
I mean, this is amazing, but isn't most of the evidence so far

317
0:18:40.702,000 --> 0:18:42,000
that sensory substitution works,

318
0:18:43.049,000 --> 0:18:45,000
not necessarily that sensory addition works?

319
0:18:45.156,000 --> 0:18:48,000
I mean, isn't it possible that the blind person can see through their tongue

320
0:18:48.793,000 --> 0:18:53,000
because the visual cortex is still there, ready to process,

321
0:18:53.971,000 --> 0:18:54,000
and that that is needed as part of it?

322
0:18:55.79,000 --> 0:18:57,000
DE: That's a great question. We actually have no idea

323
0:18:58.434,000 --> 0:19:01,000
what the theoretical limits are of what kind of data the brain can take in.

324
0:19:02.33,000 --> 0:19:05,000
The general story, though, is that it's extraordinarily flexible.

325
0:19:05.402,000 --> 0:19:08,000
So when a person goes blind, what we used to call their visual cortex

326
0:19:09.207,000 --> 0:19:14,000
gets taken over by other things, by touch, by hearing, by vocabulary.

327
0:19:14.265,000 --> 0:19:18,000
So what that tells us is that the cortex is kind of a one-trick pony.

328
0:19:18.327,000 --> 0:19:2,000
It just runs certain kinds of computations on things.

329
0:19:20.975,000 --> 0:19:23,000
And when we look around at things like braille, for example,

330
0:19:24.076,000 --> 0:19:27,000
people are getting information through bumps on their fingers.

331
0:19:27.165,000 --> 0:19:3,000
So I don't think we have any reason to think there's a theoretical limit

332
0:19:30.82,000 --> 0:19:31,000
that we know the edge of.

333
0:19:33.244,000 --> 0:19:36,000
CA: If this checks out, you're going to be deluged.

334
0:19:36.508,000 --> 0:19:39,000
There are so many possible applications for this.

335
0:19:39.759,000 --> 0:19:42,000
Are you ready for this? What are you most excited about, the direction it might go?

336
0:19:43.69,000 --> 0:19:45,000
DE: I mean, I think there's a lot of applications here.

337
0:19:46.267,000 --> 0:19:49,000
In terms of beyond sensory substitution, the things I started mentioning

338
0:19:49.715,000 --> 0:19:53,000
about astronauts on the space station, they spend a lot of their time

339
0:19:54.085,000 --> 0:19:57,000
monitoring things, and they could instead just get what's going on,

340
0:19:57.304,000 --> 0:20:,000
because what this is really good for is multidimensional data.

341
0:20:00.764,000 --> 0:20:04,000
The key is this: Our visual systems are good at detecting blobs and edges,

342
0:20:05.547,000 --> 0:20:07,000
but they're really bad at what our world has become,

343
0:20:07.995,000 --> 0:20:09,000
which is screens with lots and lots of data.

344
0:20:10.182,000 --> 0:20:12,000
We have to crawl that with our attentional systems.

345
0:20:12.585,000 --> 0:20:14,000
So this is a way of just feeling the state of something,

346
0:20:15.255,000 --> 0:20:18,000
just like the way you know the state of your body as you're standing around.

347
0:20:18.849,000 --> 0:20:21,000
So I think heavy machinery, safety, feeling the state of a factory,

348
0:20:22.028,000 --> 0:20:25,000
of your equipment, that's one place it'll go right away.

349
0:20:25.092,000 --> 0:20:28,000
CA: David Eagleman, that was one mind-blowing talk. Thank you very much.

350
0:20:28.797,000 --> 0:20:32,000
DE: Thank you, Chris. (Applause)

0:00:06.26,000 --> 0:00:09,000
[Music]

2
0:00:24.55,000 --> 0:00:29,000
but ten years ago I took on the task to

3
0:00:27.98,000 --> 0:00:31,000
teach global development to Swedish

4
0:00:30.11,000 --> 0:00:34,000
undergraduate students that was after

5
0:00:32.66,000 --> 0:00:36,000
having spent about 20 years together

6
0:00:34.94,000 --> 0:00:38,000
with African institutions studying

7
0:00:37.07,000 --> 0:00:41,000
hunger in Africa so I was sort of

8
0:00:39.07,000 --> 0:00:43,000
expected to know a little about the

9
0:00:41.18,000 --> 0:00:45,000
world and I started in our medical

10
0:00:43.85,000 --> 0:00:47,000
university Karolinska Institute an

11
0:00:45.979,000 --> 0:00:49,000
undergraduate course called global

12
0:00:47.96,000 --> 0:00:51,000
health but when you get that opportunity

13
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:54,000
you get a little nervous I thought these

14
0:00:52.82,000 --> 0:00:55,000
students coming to us actually have the

15
0:00:54.5,000 --> 0:00:57,000
highest grade you can get in Swedish

16
0:00:56.12,000 --> 0:00:59,000
college system so I thought maybe they

17
0:00:57.979,000 --> 0:01:01,000
know everything I'm going to teach them

18
0:00:59.69,000 --> 0:01:04,000
about so I did a pretest when they came

19
0:01:02.78,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and one of the question from which I

20
0:01:04.909,000 --> 0:01:08,000
learned a lot was this one which country

21
0:01:07.01,000 --> 0:01:12,000
has the highest child mortality of these

22
0:01:09.47,000 --> 0:01:14,000
five pairs and I put them together so

23
0:01:12.74,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that in each pair of country one has

24
0:01:15.23,000 --> 0:01:21,000
twice the child mortality of the other

25
0:01:17.39,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and this means that it's much bigger the

26
0:01:21.83,000 --> 0:01:24,000
difference than the uncertainty of the

27
0:01:23.36,000 --> 0:01:27,000
data I won't put you to test here but

28
0:01:25.79,000 --> 0:01:29,000
it's Turkey which is high as there

29
0:01:27.38,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Poland Russia Pakistan and South Africa

30
0:01:30.71,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and these were the results of the

31
0:01:32.24,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Swedish students I did that so I got the

32
0:01:33.98,000 --> 0:01:36,000
confidence interval which was pretty

33
0:01:35.48,000 --> 0:01:39,000
narrow and I got happy of course at one

34
0:01:37.82,000 --> 0:01:4,000
point eight right answer out of five

35
0:01:39.74,000 --> 0:01:42,000
possible that means that there was a

36
0:01:41.66,000 --> 0:01:46,000
place for a professor of international

37
0:01:43.46,000 --> 0:01:48,000
health and for my course but one life

38
0:01:46.76,000 --> 0:01:51,000
late night when I was compiling the

39
0:01:49.31,000 --> 0:01:55,000
report I really realized my discovery I

40
0:01:52.58,000 --> 0:01:58,000
have shown that Swedish top students

41
0:01:55.52,000 --> 0:02:01,000
know statistically significantly less

42
0:01:58.73,000 --> 0:02:04,000
about the world than the chimpanzees

43
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:07,000
because the chimpanzee would score half

44
0:02:05.609,000 --> 0:02:08,000
right if I gave him two bananas with Sri

45
0:02:07.829,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Lanka and Turkey they would be right

46
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
half of the cases but the students are

47
0:02:11.43,000 --> 0:02:16,000
not there the problem for me was not

48
0:02:13.83,000 --> 0:02:18,000
ignorant it was preconceived ideas I did

49
0:02:16.95,000 --> 0:02:2,000
also an unfair unethical study of the

50
0:02:19.29,000 --> 0:02:23,000
professors of the Karolinska Institute

51
0:02:21.12,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that hands out the Nobel Prize in

52
0:02:23.31,000 --> 0:02:29,000
medicine and they are on par with the

53
0:02:25.5,000 --> 0:02:32,000
chimpanzee there so this is where I

54
0:02:30.269,000 --> 0:02:34,000
realized that there was really a need to

55
0:02:32.549,000 --> 0:02:36,000
communicate because the data or what's

56
0:02:35.25,000 --> 0:02:38,000
happening in the world and the child

57
0:02:36.989,000 --> 0:02:39,000
health obviously every country is very

58
0:02:38.64,000 --> 0:02:42,000
well aware so we did this software which

59
0:02:40.95,000 --> 0:02:46,000
displays it like this every bubble here

60
0:02:43.29,000 --> 0:02:5,000
is a country this country over here is

61
0:02:47.03,000 --> 0:02:53,000
this is China and this is India the size

62
0:02:50.849,000 --> 0:02:54,000
of the bubble is the population and on

63
0:02:53.099,000 --> 0:02:59,000
this axis here I put fertility rate

64
0:02:55.819,000 --> 0:03:,000
because my students what they said when

65
0:02:59.13,000 --> 0:03:02,000
they looked upon the world and I asked

66
0:03:00.989,000 --> 0:03:04,000
them what do you really think about the

67
0:03:03.12,000 --> 0:03:08,000
world huh well I first discovered that

68
0:03:05.549,000 --> 0:03:1,000
the textbook was Tintin mainly and they

69
0:03:08.97,000 --> 0:03:12,000
said the world is still we and them and

70
0:03:11.01,000 --> 0:03:16,000
we is Western world and them is third

71
0:03:13.92,000 --> 0:03:17,000
world and what do you mean with Western

72
0:03:16.56,000 --> 0:03:2,000
world I said well that's long life in

73
0:03:18.63,000 --> 0:03:23,000
small family and third world is short

74
0:03:20.819,000 --> 0:03:25,000
life in large family so this is what I

75
0:03:23.819,000 --> 0:03:28,000
could display here I put fertility rate

76
0:03:26.37,000 --> 0:03:31,000
here number of children per woman 1 2 3

77
0:03:29.43,000 --> 0:03:34,000
4 up to about eight children per woman

78
0:03:31.59,000 --> 0:03:36,000
we have very good data since 1960 to

79
0:03:34.829,000 --> 0:03:38,000
1968 on the size of families in all

80
0:03:37.41,000 --> 0:03:41,000
countries the error margin is narrow

81
0:03:39.06,000 --> 0:03:43,000
here I put life expectancy at birth from

82
0:03:41.639,000 --> 0:03:46,000
30 years in some countries up to about

83
0:03:43.98,000 --> 0:03:47,000
70 years and 1962 that was really a

84
0:03:47.28,000 --> 0:03:5,000
group of countries here that was

85
0:03:48.69,000 --> 0:03:53,000
industrialized countries and they had

86
0:03:50.669,000 --> 0:03:54,000
small families and long lives and these

87
0:03:53.849,000 --> 0:03:56,000
were the developing countries they had

88
0:03:55.41,000 --> 0:03:59,000
large families and they had relatively

89
0:03:57.69,000 --> 0:04:01,000
short lives now what has happened since

90
0:03:59.79,000 --> 0:04:03,000
1962 we want to see the change or the

91
0:04:02.669,000 --> 0:04:05,000
students right it's still two types of

92
0:04:04.65,000 --> 0:04:07,000
countries or have these developing

93
0:04:06.48,000 --> 0:04:09,000
countries got smaller families and they

94
0:04:08.25,000 --> 0:04:12,000
live here or have they got longer lives

95
0:04:10.259,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and live up there let's see we stopped

96
0:04:12.389,000 --> 0:04:15,000
the world and this is all UN statistic

97
0:04:14.519,000 --> 0:04:17,000
that has been a

98
0:04:15.7,000 --> 0:04:18,000
here we go can you see that it's China

99
0:04:17.62,000 --> 0:04:2,000
they're moving them against better

100
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:22,000
health they are improving there or the

101
0:04:20.68,000 --> 0:04:23,000
green latin-american countries they are

102
0:04:22.81,000 --> 0:04:25,000
moving towards smaller families your

103
0:04:24.55,000 --> 0:04:28,000
yellow ones here or the Arabic countries

104
0:04:26.32,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and they get larger families but they no

105
0:04:28.75,000 --> 0:04:31,000
longer life but not larger families the

106
0:04:30.669,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Africans are the green down here they

107
0:04:32.199,000 --> 0:04:35,000
still remain here this is India

108
0:04:33.82,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Indonesia is moving on pretty fast and

109
0:04:35.919,000 --> 0:04:39,000
in the 80s here you have Bangladesh

110
0:04:37.99,000 --> 0:04:4,000
still among the African countries there

111
0:04:39.97,000 --> 0:04:43,000
but now Bangladesh it's a miracle that

112
0:04:41.949,000 --> 0:04:45,000
happens in the 80s the Imams start to

113
0:04:44.32,000 --> 0:04:48,000
promote Family Planning and they move up

114
0:04:46.24,000 --> 0:04:51,000
into that corner and in 90s we have the

115
0:04:49.18,000 --> 0:04:53,000
terrible HIV epidemic that takes down

116
0:04:51.729,000 --> 0:04:55,000
the life expectancy of the African

117
0:04:53.919,000 --> 0:04:57,000
countries and all the rest of the world

118
0:04:55.9,000 --> 0:04:59,000
moves up into the corner where we have

119
0:04:58.45,000 --> 0:05:01,000
long lives and small family and we have

120
0:05:00.85,000 --> 0:05:05,000
a completely new world

121
0:05:02.42,000 --> 0:05:05,000
[Applause]

122
0:05:14.47,000 --> 0:05:18,000
let me make a comparison directly

123
0:05:16.99,000 --> 0:05:22,000
between United States of America and

124
0:05:19.03,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Vietnam 1964 America had small families

125
0:05:23.89,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and long life Vietnam had large families

126
0:05:26.71,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and short lives and this is what happens

127
0:05:29.23,000 --> 0:05:35,000
the data during the war indicate that

128
0:05:33.25,000 --> 0:05:37,000
even with all the death there was an

129
0:05:35.32,000 --> 0:05:38,000
improvement of life expectancy by the

130
0:05:37.36,000 --> 0:05:4,000
end of the year the Family Planning

131
0:05:38.68,000 --> 0:05:41,000
started in Vietnam and they went for

132
0:05:40.45,000 --> 0:05:43,000
smaller families and the United States

133
0:05:42.19,000 --> 0:05:46,000
up there is getting for a longer life

134
0:05:43.99,000 --> 0:05:48,000
keeping family size and in the 80s now

135
0:05:46.42,000 --> 0:05:5,000
they give up communist planning and they

136
0:05:49.39,000 --> 0:05:53,000
go for market economy and it moves

137
0:05:50.95,000 --> 0:05:56,000
faster even in social life and today we

138
0:05:53.59,000 --> 0:05:59,000
have in Vietnam the same life expectancy

139
0:05:57.01,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and the same family size here in Vietnam

140
0:06:00.51,000 --> 0:06:08,000
19 2003 as in United States 1974 by the

141
0:06:05.71,000 --> 0:06:1,000
end of the war I think we all if we

142
0:06:08.98,000 --> 0:06:13,000
don't look in the data we underestimate

143
0:06:11.62,000 --> 0:06:16,000
the tremendous change in Asia which was

144
0:06:14.23,000 --> 0:06:19,000
in social change before we saw the

145
0:06:17.02,000 --> 0:06:21,000
economical change so let's move over to

146
0:06:19.6,000 --> 0:06:24,000
another way here in which we could

147
0:06:21.88,000 --> 0:06:26,000
display the distribution in the world of

148
0:06:25.51,000 --> 0:06:32,000
the income this is the world

149
0:06:27.55,000 --> 0:06:36,000
distribution of income of people $1 $10

150
0:06:32.83,000 --> 0:06:37,000
or $100 per day there's no gap between

151
0:06:36.67,000 --> 0:06:41,000
rich and poor any longer this is a myth

152
0:06:38.74,000 --> 0:06:44,000
there's a little hump here but there are

153
0:06:42.25,000 --> 0:06:48,000
people all the way and if we look where

154
0:06:44.74,000 --> 0:06:51,000
the income ends up the income this is

155
0:06:48.85,000 --> 0:06:54,000
100 percent of world's annual income and

156
0:06:51.99,000 --> 0:06:59,000
the rich is 20% they take out of that

157
0:06:55.63,000 --> 0:07:03,000
about 74 percent and the poor is 20%

158
0:07:00.34,000 --> 0:07:06,000
they take about 2% and this shows that

159
0:07:04.36,000 --> 0:07:08,000
the concept developing countries is

160
0:07:06.34,000 --> 0:07:11,000
extremely doubtful we sort of think

161
0:07:09.01,000 --> 0:07:14,000
about aid like these people here giving

162
0:07:11.86,000 --> 0:07:15,000
aid to these people here but in the

163
0:07:14.14,000 --> 0:07:18,000
middle we have most a world population

164
0:07:16.21,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and they have now 24 percent of the

165
0:07:18.82,000 --> 0:07:23,000
income we heard it in other forms and

166
0:07:20.95,000 --> 0:07:24,000
who are who are these these where are

167
0:07:24.1,000 --> 0:07:29,000
the different countries

168
0:07:25.6,000 --> 0:07:3,000
I can show you Africa this is Africa

169
0:07:29.35,000 --> 0:07:33,000
10% of world population most

170
0:07:31.45,000 --> 0:07:35,000
impoverished this is oacd

171
0:07:33.75,000 --> 0:07:37,000
the rich country the country club of the

172
0:07:36.43,000 --> 0:07:4,000
UN and they are over here on this side

173
0:07:38.59,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and quite an overlap between Africa and

174
0:07:41.2,000 --> 0:07:45,000
oacd and this is Latin America it has

175
0:07:44.14,000 --> 0:07:48,000
everything on this earth from the

176
0:07:45.67,000 --> 0:07:5,000
poorest to the richest in Latin America

177
0:07:48.37,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and on top of that we can put East

178
0:07:51.13,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Europe we can put East Asia and we could

179
0:07:53.86,000 --> 0:07:59,000
South Asia and how did it look like if

180
0:07:56.53,000 --> 0:08:03,000
we go back in time to about 1970 then

181
0:08:00.46,000 --> 0:08:06,000
there was more of a hump and we have

182
0:08:04.3,000 --> 0:08:08,000
most who lived in absolute poverty were

183
0:08:06.49,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Asians the problem in the world was the

184
0:08:09.04,000 --> 0:08:14,000
poverty in Asia and if I now let the

185
0:08:12.49,000 --> 0:08:16,000
world move forward you will seen that

186
0:08:14.47,000 --> 0:08:18,000
wild populations increase there are

187
0:08:16.63,000 --> 0:08:2,000
hundreds of millions in Asia are getting

188
0:08:18.67,000 --> 0:08:22,000
out of poverty and some others get into

189
0:08:21.13,000 --> 0:08:24,000
poverty and this is the pattern we have

190
0:08:22.9,000 --> 0:08:26,000
today and the best projection from the

191
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:3,000
World Bank is that this will happen and

192
0:08:27.31,000 --> 0:08:31,000
we will not have a divided world we have

193
0:08:30.01,000 --> 0:08:34,000
most people in the middle of course it's

194
0:08:31.81,000 --> 0:08:36,000
a logarithmic scale here but our concept

195
0:08:34.479,000 --> 0:08:41,000
of economy is growth with percent we

196
0:08:37.06,000 --> 0:08:44,000
look upon it as a possibility of percent

197
0:08:41.5,000 --> 0:08:46,000
increase if I change this and I take GDP

198
0:08:44.77,000 --> 0:08:5,000
per capita instead of family income and

199
0:08:47.02,000 --> 0:08:53,000
I turn these individual data into

200
0:08:51.25,000 --> 0:08:55,000
regional data of gross domestic products

201
0:08:53.86,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and I take the regions down here the

202
0:08:56.08,000 --> 0:08:59,000
size of the bubble distill the

203
0:08:57.37,000 --> 0:09:,000
population and you have the OECD there

204
0:08:59.59,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and you have sub-saharan Africa there

205
0:09:01.36,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and we take off the Arab states they're

206
0:09:03.61,000 --> 0:09:07,000
coming both from Africa and from Asia

207
0:09:05.65,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and we put them separately and we can

208
0:09:08.14,000 --> 0:09:14,000
expand this axis and I can give it a new

209
0:09:11.71,000 --> 0:09:15,000
dimension here by adding the social

210
0:09:14.38,000 --> 0:09:18,000
values their child survival now I have

211
0:09:16.6,000 --> 0:09:19,000
money on that axis and I have the

212
0:09:18.58,000 --> 0:09:21,000
possibility of children to survive there

213
0:09:20.41,000 --> 0:09:23,000
in some countries ninety-nine point

214
0:09:22.03,000 --> 0:09:26,000
seven percent of children survive to

215
0:09:24.07,000 --> 0:09:28,000
five years of age others only seventy

216
0:09:26.56,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and here it seems that this a gap

217
0:09:28.75,000 --> 0:09:33,000
between oacd

218
0:09:29.8,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Latin America East Europe East Asia Arab

219
0:09:33.82,000 --> 0:09:37,000
states South Asia and sub-saharan Africa

220
0:09:37.18,000 --> 0:09:41,000
the linearity is very

221
0:09:38.649,000 --> 0:09:44,000
strong between child survival and money

222
0:09:41.829,000 --> 0:09:49,000
but let me split sub-saharan Africa

223
0:09:44.98,000 --> 0:09:51,000
health is there and better help is up

224
0:09:49.869,000 --> 0:09:53,000
there I can go here and I can split

225
0:09:52.48,000 --> 0:09:56,000
sub-saharan Africa into its countries

226
0:09:54.79,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and when it bursts the size of East

227
0:09:56.98,000 --> 0:09:59,000
country bubble it's the size of the

228
0:09:59.05,000 --> 0:10:02,000
population Sierra Leone the down there

229
0:10:00.879,000 --> 0:10:03,000
more reaches up there

230
0:10:02.379,000 --> 0:10:06,000
now reaches was the first country to get

231
0:10:04.779,000 --> 0:10:07,000
away with trade barriers and they could

232
0:10:06.61,000 --> 0:10:11,000
sell those sugar they could sell their

233
0:10:08.769,000 --> 0:10:13,000
textiles on equal terms as the people in

234
0:10:12.009,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Europe and North America there's a huge

235
0:10:13.99,000 --> 0:10:17,000
difference between Africa and Ghana is

236
0:10:15.939,000 --> 0:10:21,000
here in the middle in Sierra Leone a

237
0:10:18.49,000 --> 0:10:23,000
humanitarian aid here in Uganda

238
0:10:21.959,000 --> 0:10:26,000
development aid here time to invest

239
0:10:24.459,000 --> 0:10:29,000
there you can go for holiday it's a

240
0:10:27.1,000 --> 0:10:31,000
tremendous variation within Africa which

241
0:10:29.709,000 --> 0:10:33,000
we very often make that it's equal

242
0:10:31.99,000 --> 0:10:36,000
everything I can split South Asia here

243
0:10:34.6,000 --> 0:10:39,000
India's the big bubble in the middle but

244
0:10:37.029,000 --> 0:10:42,000
huge difference between Afghanistan and

245
0:10:39.6,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Sri Lanka and I can speed Arab states

246
0:10:42.67,000 --> 0:10:47,000
how are they same climate same culture

247
0:10:45.429,000 --> 0:10:5,000
same religion huge difference even

248
0:10:48.009,000 --> 0:10:52,000
between neighbors Yemen Civil War United

249
0:10:50.74,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Arab Emirates money which was quite

250
0:10:52.66,000 --> 0:10:58,000
equally and well used not as the methods

251
0:10:55.779,000 --> 0:11:,000
and that includes all the children of

252
0:10:58.749,000 --> 0:11:02,000
the foreign workers who are in the

253
0:11:00.85,000 --> 0:11:02,000
country data is often better than you

254
0:11:03.279,000 --> 0:11:05,000
think

255
0:11:03.67,000 --> 0:11:07,000
many people say data is bad there is an

256
0:11:05.829,000 --> 0:11:09,000
uncertainty merge but we can see the

257
0:11:07.929,000 --> 0:11:1,000
difference here Cambodia Singapore the

258
0:11:10.089,000 --> 0:11:15,000
differences are much bigger than the

259
0:11:11.589,000 --> 0:11:17,000
weakness of the data East Europe Soviet

260
0:11:15.579,000 --> 0:11:19,000
economy for a long time but they come

261
0:11:18.399,000 --> 0:11:22,000
out of the ten years very very

262
0:11:20.259,000 --> 0:11:25,000
differently and there is Latin America

263
0:11:23.04,000 --> 0:11:27,000
today we don't have to go to Cuba to

264
0:11:25.629,000 --> 0:11:28,000
find a healthy country in Latin America

265
0:11:27.459,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Chile will have a lower child mortality

266
0:11:29.41,000 --> 0:11:33,000
thank you but within some few years from

267
0:11:31.54,000 --> 0:11:36,000
now and here we have high-income

268
0:11:33.699,000 --> 0:11:39,000
countries in OECD and we get the whole

269
0:11:36.639,000 --> 0:11:42,000
pattern here of the world which is more

270
0:11:39.73,000 --> 0:11:47,000
or less like like this and if we look at

271
0:11:43.299,000 --> 0:11:49,000
it how it looks the world in 1960 it

272
0:11:48.069,000 --> 0:11:52,000
starts to move 1960 this is mouths a

273
0:11:50.199,000 --> 0:11:53,000
tomb he brought health to China

274
0:11:52.32,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and then he died and then thanks your

275
0:11:53.91,000 --> 0:11:56,000
ping came and brought money to China and

276
0:11:56.07,000 --> 0:12:,000
brought them into the mainstream again

277
0:11:57.78,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and we have seen how countries move in

278
0:12:00.39,000 --> 0:12:06,000
different directions like this so it's

279
0:12:03.09,000 --> 0:12:09,000
sort of sort of difficult to get an

280
0:12:06.77,000 --> 0:12:1,000
example country which shows the pattern

281
0:12:09.36,000 --> 0:12:17,000
of the world but I would like to bring

282
0:12:11.67,000 --> 0:12:22,000
you back to about here at 1960 and I

283
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:27,000
would like to compare South Korea which

284
0:12:23.49,000 --> 0:12:29,000
is this one with with Brazil which is

285
0:12:27.24,000 --> 0:12:32,000
this one the label went away for me here

286
0:12:30.36,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and I would like to compare Uganda which

287
0:12:32.88,000 --> 0:12:42,000
is there and I can run it forward like

288
0:12:37.05,000 --> 0:12:46,000
this and you can see how South Korea is

289
0:12:43.23,000 --> 0:12:49,000
making a very very fast advancement

290
0:12:46.14,000 --> 0:12:52,000
whereas Brazil is much slower and if we

291
0:12:49.53,000 --> 0:12:55,000
move back again here and we put on

292
0:12:52.65,000 --> 0:12:58,000
trails on them like this you can see

293
0:12:55.83,000 --> 0:13:01,000
again that the speed of development is

294
0:12:59.31,000 --> 0:13:06,000
very very different and the countries

295
0:13:02.67,000 --> 0:13:08,000
are moving more or less in the same rate

296
0:13:06.39,000 --> 0:13:1,000
as money and health but it seems you can

297
0:13:09.18,000 --> 0:13:14,000
move much faster if you're healthy first

298
0:13:11.31,000 --> 0:13:16,000
than if you are wealthy first and to

299
0:13:14.67,000 --> 0:13:18,000
show that you can put on the way of

300
0:13:16.44,000 --> 0:13:21,000
united arab emirate they came from here

301
0:13:18.81,000 --> 0:13:23,000
a mineral country they catch all the oil

302
0:13:21.51,000 --> 0:13:26,000
they got all the money but health cannot

303
0:13:24.06,000 --> 0:13:28,000
be bought at the supermarket you have to

304
0:13:26.58,000 --> 0:13:29,000
invest in health you have to get kids

305
0:13:28.2,000 --> 0:13:31,000
into schooling you have to Train health

306
0:13:29.79,000 --> 0:13:33,000
staff you have to educate the population

307
0:13:31.62,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and sheikh zayed did that in a fairly

308
0:13:33.93,000 --> 0:13:37,000
good way and in spite of falling oil

309
0:13:36.42,000 --> 0:13:4,000
prices he brought this country up here

310
0:13:38.4,000 --> 0:13:42,000
so we got a much more mainstream

311
0:13:41.09,000 --> 0:13:45,000
appearance of the world where all

312
0:13:42.84,000 --> 0:13:48,000
countries tend to use their money better

313
0:13:45.54,000 --> 0:13:51,000
than they used in the past now this is

314
0:13:49.32,000 --> 0:13:54,000
more or less if you look at if you look

315
0:13:51.96,000 --> 0:13:57,000
at the average data of the countries

316
0:13:55.14,000 --> 0:14:01,000
they are like this now that's dangerous

317
0:13:58.65,000 --> 0:14:04,000
to use average data because there's such

318
0:14:02.13,000 --> 0:14:05,000
a lot of difference within countries so

319
0:14:04.65,000 --> 0:14:08,000
if I go

320
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:13,000
look here we can see that Uganda that

321
0:14:09.27,000 --> 0:14:15,000
today is where South Korea was 1960 if I

322
0:14:13.5,000 --> 0:14:18,000
split Uganda there's quite a difference

323
0:14:15.41,000 --> 0:14:2,000
within Uganda these are the quintiles of

324
0:14:18.63,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Uganda the richest 20% of Uganda's are

325
0:14:21.15,000 --> 0:14:26,000
there the poorest are down there if I

326
0:14:23.34,000 --> 0:14:28,000
split South Africa it's like this and if

327
0:14:26.19,000 --> 0:14:31,000
I go down and look at Nigeria where

328
0:14:29.13,000 --> 0:14:34,000
there was such a terrible famine lost

329
0:14:31.41,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Lee it's like this the 20% poorest of

330
0:14:35.04,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Nigeria is out here and the 20% richest

331
0:14:37.86,000 --> 0:14:41,000
of South Africa is there and yet we tend

332
0:14:40.53,000 --> 0:14:43,000
to discuss on what solutions there

333
0:14:42.63,000 --> 0:14:46,000
should be in Africa everything in this

334
0:14:44.52,000 --> 0:14:49,000
world exists in Africa and you can't

335
0:14:46.74,000 --> 0:14:51,000
discuss universal access to HIV for that

336
0:14:50.13,000 --> 0:14:55,000
quintile up here with the same strategy

337
0:14:52.47,000 --> 0:14:57,000
as down here the improvement of the

338
0:14:55.14,000 --> 0:15:01,000
world must be highly contextualized and

339
0:14:57.69,000 --> 0:15:03,000
it's not relevant to have it on regional

340
0:15:01.17,000 --> 0:15:05,000
level we must be much more detailed we

341
0:15:03.9,000 --> 0:15:07,000
find that students get very excited when

342
0:15:05.97,000 --> 0:15:09,000
they can use this and even more

343
0:15:08.12,000 --> 0:15:13,000
policymakers and the corporate sectors

344
0:15:10.5,000 --> 0:15:15,000
would like to see see how the world is

345
0:15:13.29,000 --> 0:15:18,000
changing now why doesn't this take place

346
0:15:15.839,000 --> 0:15:19,000
why are we not using the data we have we

347
0:15:18.57,000 --> 0:15:22,000
have data in the United Nation in the

348
0:15:20.61,000 --> 0:15:24,000
National Statistical agencies and in

349
0:15:22.83,000 --> 0:15:25,000
universities another non-governmental

350
0:15:24.66,000 --> 0:15:28,000
organization because the data is hidden

351
0:15:26.79,000 --> 0:15:3,000
down in the databases and the public is

352
0:15:29.19,000 --> 0:15:32,000
there and the internet is there but we

353
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
have still not used it effectively all

354
0:15:33.15,000 --> 0:15:38,000
that information was so changing in the

355
0:15:35.4,000 --> 0:15:39,000
world does not include publicly funded

356
0:15:38.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
statistics there are some webpages like

357
0:15:40.08,000 --> 0:15:45,000
this you know but they take some

358
0:15:42.89,000 --> 0:15:47,000
nourishment down from the databases but

359
0:15:45.96,000 --> 0:15:51,000
people put prices on them stupid

360
0:15:48.24,000 --> 0:15:54,000
passwords and boring statistics and this

361
0:15:52.44,000 --> 0:15:54,000
won't work

362
0:15:55.25,000 --> 0:16:,000
so what is needed we have the databases

363
0:15:58.17,000 --> 0:16:02,000
it's not a new database you need we have

364
0:16:00.45,000 --> 0:16:04,000
wonderful design tools and more and more

365
0:16:02.73,000 --> 0:16:07,000
I added up here so we started a

366
0:16:05.19,000 --> 0:16:1,000
non-profit venture which we called

367
0:16:08.15,000 --> 0:16:12,000
linking data to design we call it

368
0:16:10.8,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Gapminder from London Underground where

369
0:16:12.78,000 --> 0:16:16,000
they warn you mind the gap so we thought

370
0:16:14.94,000 --> 0:16:18,000
gap mind was appropriate and we started

371
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:21,000
to write software which could link the

372
0:16:19.35,000 --> 0:16:22,000
data like this and it wasn't that

373
0:16:21.63,000 --> 0:16:23,000
difficult

374
0:16:22.44,000 --> 0:16:26,000
it took some person years and we have

375
0:16:24.36,000 --> 0:16:29,000
produced animations you can take a data

376
0:16:27.06,000 --> 0:16:32,000
set and put it there we are liberating

377
0:16:29.58,000 --> 0:16:34,000
you and data some few UN organizations

378
0:16:32.79,000 --> 0:16:36,000
some countries accept that their

379
0:16:34.98,000 --> 0:16:38,000
databases can go out on the world but

380
0:16:37.44,000 --> 0:16:41,000
what we really need is of course a

381
0:16:39.33,000 --> 0:16:44,000
search function a search function where

382
0:16:41.85,000 --> 0:16:45,000
we can copy the data up to a searchable

383
0:16:44.49,000 --> 0:16:48,000
format and get it out in the world and

384
0:16:46.44,000 --> 0:16:49,000
what do we hear when we go around I've

385
0:16:48.57,000 --> 0:16:52,000
done anthropology on the main

386
0:16:50.28,000 --> 0:16:54,000
statistical units everyone says it's

387
0:16:52.86,000 --> 0:16:56,000
impossible this can't be done our

388
0:16:55.17,000 --> 0:16:59,000
information is so peculiar in detail so

389
0:16:57.69,000 --> 0:17:01,000
that cannot be searched as other can be

390
0:16:59.88,000 --> 0:17:03,000
searched we cannot give the data free to

391
0:17:02.43,000 --> 0:17:06,000
the students free to the entrepreneurs

392
0:17:04.38,000 --> 0:17:09,000
of the world but this is what we would

393
0:17:06.75,000 --> 0:17:11,000
like to see isn't it the publicly funded

394
0:17:09.569,000 --> 0:17:14,000
data is down here and we would like

395
0:17:11.939,000 --> 0:17:15,000
flowers to grow out on the net and one

396
0:17:14.819,000 --> 0:17:18,000
of the crucial point is to make them

397
0:17:16.8,000 --> 0:17:2,000
searchable and then people can use the

398
0:17:19.02,000 --> 0:17:23,000
different design tool to animate it

399
0:17:21.42,000 --> 0:17:25,000
there and I have a pretty good news for

400
0:17:23.699,000 --> 0:17:28,000
you I have a good news that the present

401
0:17:26.13,000 --> 0:17:31,000
new head of UN statistic he doesn't say

402
0:17:28.8,000 --> 0:17:32,000
it's impossible he only says we can't do

403
0:17:31.5,000 --> 0:17:33,000
it

404
0:17:35.09,000 --> 0:17:42,000
and that's a quite clever guy so we can

405
0:17:40.799,000 --> 0:17:44,000
see a lot happening in data in the

406
0:17:43.08,000 --> 0:17:47,000
coming years we will be able to look at

407
0:17:45.36,000 --> 0:17:51,000
income distributions in completely new

408
0:17:47.7,000 --> 0:17:53,000
ways this is the income distribution of

409
0:17:51.51,000 --> 0:17:57,000
China 1970 this is the income

410
0:17:54.66,000 --> 0:18:01,000
distribution of the United States 1970

411
0:17:58.2,000 --> 0:18:04,000
almost no overlap almost no overlap and

412
0:18:01.77,000 --> 0:18:06,000
what has happened what has happened is

413
0:18:04.41,000 --> 0:18:08,000
this the China is growing it's not so

414
0:18:06.809,000 --> 0:18:11,000
equal any longer and it's appearing here

415
0:18:09.27,000 --> 0:18:17,000
overlooking the United States almost

416
0:18:12.51,000 --> 0:18:16,000
like a ghost isn't it it's pretty scary

417
0:18:21.65,000 --> 0:18:26,000
but I think it's very important to have

418
0:18:24.15,000 --> 0:18:3,000
have all this information we need we

419
0:18:27.12,000 --> 0:18:33,000
need really to see it and instead of

420
0:18:30.51,000 --> 0:18:36,000
looking at this I would like to end up

421
0:18:33.24,000 --> 0:18:39,000
by showing the Internet users per 1000

422
0:18:37.02,000 --> 0:18:41,000
and this software we access about 500

423
0:18:39.72,000 --> 0:18:44,000
variables from all the countries quite

424
0:18:41.76,000 --> 0:18:47,000
easily it takes some time to change for

425
0:18:45.54,000 --> 0:18:5,000
this but on the accesses you can quite

426
0:18:48.39,000 --> 0:18:54,000
easily get any variable you would like

427
0:18:50.97,000 --> 0:18:55,000
to have and the thing would be to get up

428
0:18:54.54,000 --> 0:18:58,000
the database is free to get them

429
0:18:56.73,000 --> 0:19:,000
searchable and with a secondly to get

430
0:18:59.22,000 --> 0:19:03,000
them into the graphic formats where you

431
0:19:01.559,000 --> 0:19:05,000
can instantly understand them now the

432
0:19:04.11,000 --> 0:19:08,000
statisticians doesn't like it because

433
0:19:06.059,000 --> 0:19:14,000
they say that this will not this will

434
0:19:08.46,000 --> 0:19:16,000
not show the the reality we have to have

435
0:19:14.85,000 --> 0:19:17,000
statistical analytical methods but this

436
0:19:16.919,000 --> 0:19:21,000
is hypothesis-generating

437
0:19:18.66,000 --> 0:19:23,000
I end now with a world where the

438
0:19:22.26,000 --> 0:19:25,000
internet are coming the number of

439
0:19:23.669,000 --> 0:19:27,000
Internet users are going up like this

440
0:19:25.41,000 --> 0:19:29,000
this is the GDP per capita and it's a

441
0:19:28.23,000 --> 0:19:33,000
new technology coming in but in

442
0:19:30.24,000 --> 0:19:35,000
amazingly how well it fits to the

443
0:19:33.45,000 --> 0:19:38,000
economy of the countries that's why the

444
0:19:35.85,000 --> 0:19:4,000
$100 computer will be so important but

445
0:19:38.64,000 --> 0:19:42,000
the nice tenders it's as if the world is

446
0:19:41.19,000 --> 0:19:45,000
flattening off isn't it these countries

447
0:19:43.05,000 --> 0:19:47,000
are lifting more than the economy

448
0:19:45.29,000 --> 0:19:48,000
and will be very interesting to fall of

449
0:19:47.27,000 --> 0:19:5,000
this over the year as I would like you

450
0:19:49.1,000 --> 0:20:03,000
to be able to do with all the publicly

451
0:19:51.14,000 --> 0:20:08,000
funded data thank you very much what if

452
0:20:03.77,000 --> 0:20:13,000
great ideas weren't cherished what if

453
0:20:08.87,000 --> 0:20:21,000
they carried no importance or held no

454
0:20:14.45,000 --> 0:20:24,000
value there is a place where artistic

455
0:20:22.67,000 --> 0:20:26,000
vision is protected where inspired

456
0:20:24.59,000 --> 0:20:3,000
design ideas live on to become ultimate

457
0:20:27.53,000 --> 0:20:3,000
driving machines

458
0:20:33.67,000 --> 0:20:35,000
you

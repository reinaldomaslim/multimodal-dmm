1
0:00:12.825,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Have you ever noticed when you ask someone to talk

2
0:00:15.2,000 --> 0:00:18,000
about a change they're making for the better in their personal lives,

3
0:00:18.56,000 --> 0:00:19,000
they're often really energetic?

4
0:00:21.015,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Whether it's training for a marathon,

5
0:00:23.52,000 --> 0:00:24,000
picking up an old hobby,

6
0:00:24.8,000 --> 0:00:25,000
or learning a new skill,

7
0:00:26.68,000 --> 0:00:27,000
for most people,

8
0:00:27.96,000 --> 0:00:32,000
self-transformation projects occupy a very positive emotional space.

9
0:00:33.72,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Self-transformation is empowering,

10
0:00:36.2,000 --> 0:00:38,000
energizing, even exhilarating.

11
0:00:38.56,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I mean just take a look at some of the titles of self-help books:

12
0:00:42.36,000 --> 0:00:44,000
"Awaken the Giant Within,"

13
0:00:45.08,000 --> 0:00:47,000
"Practicing the Power of Now,"

14
0:00:47.6,000 --> 0:00:49,000
or here's a great one we can all relate to,

15
0:00:50.08,000 --> 0:00:52,000
"You are a Badass:

16
0:00:52.32,000 --> 0:00:57,000
How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness and Start Living an Awesome Life."

17
0:00:57.44,000 --> 0:00:58,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:00.04,000 --> 0:01:02,000
When it comes to self-transformation,

19
0:01:03.24,000 --> 0:01:06,000
you can't help but get a sense of the excitement.

20
0:01:08.84,000 --> 0:01:11,000
But there's another type of transformation

21
0:01:12.04,000 --> 0:01:15,000
that occupies a very different emotional space.

22
0:01:16.08,000 --> 0:01:18,000
The transformation of organizations.

23
0:01:19.88,000 --> 0:01:2,000
If you're like most people,

24
0:01:21.24,000 --> 0:01:25,000
when you hear the words "Our organization is going to start a transformation,"

25
0:01:25.64,000 --> 0:01:26,000
you're thinking, "Uh-oh."

26
0:01:27.426,000 --> 0:01:28,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:28.6,000 --> 0:01:29,000
"Layoffs."

28
0:01:30.8,000 --> 0:01:31,000
The blood drains from your face,

29
0:01:32.76,000 --> 0:01:34,000
your mind goes into overdrive,

30
0:01:35.64,000 --> 0:01:38,000
frantically searching for some place to run and hide.

31
0:01:40.12,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Well, you can run,

32
0:01:41.64,000 --> 0:01:42,000
but you really can't hide.

33
0:01:44.04,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Most of us spend the majority of our waking hours

34
0:01:47.04,000 --> 0:01:48,000
involved in organizations.

35
0:01:49.04,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And due to changes in globalization,

36
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
changes due to advances in technology

37
0:01:54.72,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and other factors,

38
0:01:56.56,000 --> 0:02:,000
the reality is our organizations are constantly having to adapt.

39
0:02:02.36,000 --> 0:02:03,000
In fact,

40
0:02:03.6,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I call this the era of "always-on" transformation.

41
0:02:09.4,000 --> 0:02:11,000
When I shared this idea with my wife Nicola,

42
0:02:11.68,000 --> 0:02:14,000
she said, "Always-on transformation?

43
0:02:14.84,000 --> 0:02:16,000
That sounds exhausting."

44
0:02:17.64,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And that may be exactly what you're thinking --

45
0:02:19.96,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and you would be right.

46
0:02:21.56,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Particularly if we continue to approach the transformation of organizations

47
0:02:26.72,000 --> 0:02:27,000
the way we always have been.

48
0:02:28.92,000 --> 0:02:3,000
But because we can't hide,

49
0:02:31.36,000 --> 0:02:32,000
we need to sort out two things.

50
0:02:33.08,000 --> 0:02:34,000
First,

51
0:02:34.32,000 --> 0:02:36,000
why is transformation so exhausting?

52
0:02:37.08,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And second, how do we fix it?

53
0:02:41.2,000 --> 0:02:42,000
First of all,

54
0:02:42.44,000 --> 0:02:45,000
let's acknowledge that change is hard.

55
0:02:45.6,000 --> 0:02:47,000
People naturally resist change,

56
0:02:47.64,000 --> 0:02:49,000
especially when it's imposed on them.

57
0:02:51.2,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But there are things that organizations do that make change even harder

58
0:02:55.8,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and more exhausting for people than it needs to be.

59
0:02:59.72,000 --> 0:03:,000
First of all,

60
0:03:00.96,000 --> 0:03:03,000
leaders often wait too long to act.

61
0:03:05.04,000 --> 0:03:06,000
As a result,

62
0:03:06.28,000 --> 0:03:08,000
everything is happening in crisis mode.

63
0:03:10.32,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Which, of course, tends to be exhausting.

64
0:03:13.36,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Or, given the urgency,

65
0:03:16.48,000 --> 0:03:19,000
what they'll do is they'll just focus on the short-term results,

66
0:03:21.32,000 --> 0:03:23,000
but that doesn't give any hope for the future.

67
0:03:24.56,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Or they'll just take a superficial, one-off approach,

68
0:03:29.04,000 --> 0:03:33,000
hoping that they can return back to business as usual

69
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
as soon as the crisis is over.

70
0:03:37.6,000 --> 0:03:38,000
This kind of approach

71
0:03:38.84,000 --> 0:03:44,000
is kind of the way some students approach preparing for standardized tests.

72
0:03:46.28,000 --> 0:03:49,000
In order to get test scores to go up,

73
0:03:49.76,000 --> 0:03:51,000
teachers will end up teaching to the test.

74
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Now, that approach can work;

75
0:03:54.56,000 --> 0:03:55,000
test results often do go up.

76
0:03:56.52,000 --> 0:03:59,000
But it fails the fundamental goal of education:

77
0:04:00.32,000 --> 0:04:04,000
to prepare students to succeed over the long term.

78
0:04:06.68,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So given these obstacles,

79
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
what can we do

80
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
to transform the way we transform organizations

81
0:04:15.48,000 --> 0:04:16,000
so rather than being exhausting,

82
0:04:18.2,000 --> 0:04:2,000
it's actually empowering and energizing?

83
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
To do that, we need to focus on five strategic imperatives,

84
0:04:27.2,000 --> 0:04:29,000
all of which have one thing in common:

85
0:04:29.959,000 --> 0:04:31,000
putting people first.

86
0:04:33.079,000 --> 0:04:35,000
The first imperative for putting people first

87
0:04:35.76,000 --> 0:04:36,000
is to inspire through purpose.

88
0:04:38.12,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Most transformations have financial and operational goals.

89
0:04:41.84,000 --> 0:04:45,000
These are important and they can be energizing to leaders,

90
0:04:46.12,000 --> 0:04:49,000
but they tend not to be very motivating to most people in the organization.

91
0:04:50.48,000 --> 0:04:51,000
To motivate more broadly,

92
0:04:52.28,000 --> 0:04:56,000
the transformation needs to connect with a deeper sense of purpose.

93
0:04:57.72,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Take LEGO.

94
0:04:59.64,000 --> 0:05:03,000
The LEGO Group has become an extraordinary global company.

95
0:05:04.52,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Under their very capable leadership,

96
0:05:06.28,000 --> 0:05:08,000
they've actually undergone a series of transformations.

97
0:05:09.8,000 --> 0:05:12,000
While each of these has had a very specific focus,

98
0:05:13.04,000 --> 0:05:14,000
the North Star,

99
0:05:14.36,000 --> 0:05:15,000
linking and guiding all of them,

100
0:05:16.2,000 --> 0:05:18,000
has been Lego's powerful purpose:

101
0:05:19.48,000 --> 0:05:22,000
inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow.

102
0:05:24.36,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Expanding globally?

103
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
It's not about increasing sales,

104
0:05:28.6,000 --> 0:05:32,000
but about giving millions of additional children access to LEGO building bricks.

105
0:05:33.96,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Investment and innovation?

106
0:05:35.96,000 --> 0:05:36,000
It's not about developing new products,

107
0:05:38.36,000 --> 0:05:4,000
but about enabling more children

108
0:05:40.68,000 --> 0:05:43,000
to experience the joy of learning through play.

109
0:05:45.44,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Not surprisingly,

110
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that deep sense of purpose tends to be highly motivating to LEGO's people.

111
0:05:54.12,000 --> 0:05:56,000
The second imperative for putting people first

112
0:05:57.08,000 --> 0:05:58,000
is to go all in.

113
0:06:00.08,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Too many transformations

114
0:06:01.8,000 --> 0:06:04,000
are nothing more than head-count cutting exercises;

115
0:06:05.56,000 --> 0:06:08,000
layoffs under the guise of transformation.

116
0:06:09.96,000 --> 0:06:11,000
In the face of relentless competition,

117
0:06:12.04,000 --> 0:06:15,000
it may well be that you will have to take the painful decision

118
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
to downsize the organization,

119
0:06:18.88,000 --> 0:06:21,000
just as you may have to lose some weight in order to run a marathon.

120
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:25,000
But losing weight alone

121
0:06:25.24,000 --> 0:06:27,000
will not get you across the finish line with a winning time.

122
0:06:28.56,000 --> 0:06:29,000
To win

123
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
you need to go all in.

124
0:06:32.88,000 --> 0:06:35,000
You need to go all in.

125
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Rather than just cutting costs,

126
0:06:39.64,000 --> 0:06:41,000
you need to think about initiatives

127
0:06:42.2,000 --> 0:06:44,000
that will enable you to win in the medium term,

128
0:06:44.92,000 --> 0:06:45,000
initiatives to drive growth,

129
0:06:46.92,000 --> 0:06:5,000
actions that will fundamentally change the way the company operates,

130
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and very importantly,

131
0:06:52.56,000 --> 0:06:55,000
investments to develop the leadership and the talent.

132
0:06:58.68,000 --> 0:07:01,000
The third imperative for putting people first

133
0:07:02.48,000 --> 0:07:04,000
is to enable people with the capabilities

134
0:07:05.2,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that they need to succeed during the transformation and beyond.

135
0:07:12.28,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Over the years I've competed in a number of triathlons.

136
0:07:16.28,000 --> 0:07:18,000
You know, frankly, I'm not that good,

137
0:07:18.48,000 --> 0:07:22,000
but I do have one distinct capability;

138
0:07:22.52,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I am remarkably fast at finding my bike.

139
0:07:26.64,000 --> 0:07:27,000
(Laughter)

140
0:07:28.56,000 --> 0:07:29,000
By the time I finish the swim,

141
0:07:30.4,000 --> 0:07:31,000
almost all the bikes are already gone.

142
0:07:32.28,000 --> 0:07:34,000
(Laughter)

143
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Real triathletes know that each leg --

144
0:07:40.24,000 --> 0:07:41,000
the swim, the bike, the run --

145
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:44,000
really requires different capabilities,

146
0:07:44.52,000 --> 0:07:45,000
different tools,

147
0:07:45.76,000 --> 0:07:47,000
different skills, different techniques.

148
0:07:48.44,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Likewise when we transform organizations,

149
0:07:50.92,000 --> 0:07:52,000
we need to be sure that we're giving our people

150
0:07:53.8,000 --> 0:07:55,000
the skills and the tools they need along the way.

151
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Chronos,

152
0:07:59.4,000 --> 0:08:,000
a global software company,

153
0:08:01.4,000 --> 0:08:05,000
recognized the need to transfer from building products --

154
0:08:06.36,000 --> 0:08:07,000
software products --

155
0:08:08.04,000 --> 0:08:1,000
to building software as a service.

156
0:08:11.8,000 --> 0:08:14,000
To enable its people to take that transformation,

157
0:08:15.04,000 --> 0:08:17,000
first of all they invested in new tools

158
0:08:17.76,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that would enable their employees to monitor the usage of the features

159
0:08:22.84,000 --> 0:08:24,000
as well as customer satisfaction with the new service.

160
0:08:26.28,000 --> 0:08:29,000
They also invested in skill development,

161
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:31,000
so that their employees would be able

162
0:08:31.84,000 --> 0:08:33,000
to resolve customer service problems on the spot.

163
0:08:34.96,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And very importantly,

164
0:08:36.2,000 --> 0:08:39,000
they also reinforced the collaborative behaviors that would be required

165
0:08:39.6,000 --> 0:08:43,000
to deliver an end-to-end seamless customer experience.

166
0:08:44.679,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Because of these investments,

167
0:08:46.28,000 --> 0:08:49,000
rather than feeling overwhelmed by the transformation,

168
0:08:49.64,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Chronos employees actually felt energized

169
0:08:52.919,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and empowered in their new roles.

170
0:08:56.2,000 --> 0:08:58,000
In the era of "always-on" transformation,

171
0:08:58.44,000 --> 0:08:59,000
change is a constant.

172
0:08:59.96,000 --> 0:09:,000
My fourth imperative therefore

173
0:09:01.92,000 --> 0:09:04,000
is to instill a culture of continuous learning.

174
0:09:06.8,000 --> 0:09:09,000
When Satya Nadella became the CEO of Microsoft

175
0:09:09.84,000 --> 0:09:1,000
in February 2014,

176
0:09:11.8,000 --> 0:09:13,000
he embarked on an ambitious transformation journey

177
0:09:14.72,000 --> 0:09:18,000
to prepare the company to compete in a mobile-first, cloud-first world.

178
0:09:19.64,000 --> 0:09:21,000
This included changes to strategy,

179
0:09:21.96,000 --> 0:09:22,000
the organization

180
0:09:23.2,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and very importantly, the culture.

181
0:09:26.28,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Microsoft's culture at the time was one of silos and internal competition --

182
0:09:31.32,000 --> 0:09:33,000
not exactly conducive to learning.

183
0:09:34.48,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Nadella took this head-on.

184
0:09:37.56,000 --> 0:09:4,000
He rallied his leadership around his vision

185
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:43,000
for a living, learning culture,

186
0:09:44.24,000 --> 0:09:46,000
shifting from a fixed mindset,

187
0:09:46.6,000 --> 0:09:49,000
where your role was to show up as the smartest person in the room,

188
0:09:5,000 --> 0:09:51,000
to a growth mindset,

189
0:09:51.84,000 --> 0:09:56,000
where your role was to listen, to learn and to bring out the best in people.

190
0:09:58.72,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Well, early days,

191
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Microsoft employees already noticed this shift in the culture --

192
0:10:04.08,000 --> 0:10:07,000
clear evidence of Microsoft putting people first.

193
0:10:08.56,000 --> 0:10:11,000
My fifth and final imperative is specifically for leaders.

194
0:10:13.2,000 --> 0:10:14,000
In a transformation,

195
0:10:14.88,000 --> 0:10:15,000
a leader needs to have a vision,

196
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
a clear road map with milestones,

197
0:10:20.6,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and then you need to hold people accountable for results.

198
0:10:25.08,000 --> 0:10:26,000
In other words, you need to be directive.

199
0:10:28.24,000 --> 0:10:31,000
But in order to capture the hearts and minds of people,

200
0:10:31.4,000 --> 0:10:33,000
you also need to be inclusive.

201
0:10:34.68,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Inclusive leadership is critical to putting people first.

202
0:10:39.92,000 --> 0:10:4,000
I live in the San Francisco Bay area.

203
0:10:42.68,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And right now,

204
0:10:43.92,000 --> 0:10:45,000
our basketball team is the best in the league.

205
0:10:46.96,000 --> 0:10:48,000
We won the 2015 championship,

206
0:10:49.64,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and we're favored to win again this year.

207
0:10:52.6,000 --> 0:10:54,000
There are many explanations for this.

208
0:10:54.68,000 --> 0:10:55,000
They have some fabulous players,

209
0:10:57.12,000 --> 0:10:58,000
but one of the key reasons

210
0:10:58.92,000 --> 0:11:03,000
is their head coach, Steve Kerr, is an inclusive leader.

211
0:11:05.36,000 --> 0:11:07,000
When Kerr came to the Warriors in 2014,

212
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:1,000
the Warriors were looking for a major transformation.

213
0:11:11.48,000 --> 0:11:15,000
They hadn't won a national championship since 1975.

214
0:11:17.64,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Kerr came in, and he had a clear vision,

215
0:11:20.84,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and he immediately got to work.

216
0:11:24.48,000 --> 0:11:25,000
From the outset,

217
0:11:25.84,000 --> 0:11:29,000
he reached out and engaged the players and the staff.

218
0:11:29.96,000 --> 0:11:33,000
He created an environment of open debate and solicited suggestions.

219
0:11:35.36,000 --> 0:11:36,000
During games he would often ask,

220
0:11:37.08,000 --> 0:11:38,000
"What are you seeing that I'm missing?"

221
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:45,000
One the best examples of this came in game four of the 2015 finals.

222
0:11:46.6,000 --> 0:11:48,000
The Warriors were down two games to one

223
0:11:49.88,000 --> 0:11:53,000
when Kerr made the decision to change the starting lineup;

224
0:11:54.6,000 --> 0:11:57,000
a bold move by any measure.

225
0:11:59.36,000 --> 0:12:01,000
The Warriors won the game and went on to win the championship.

226
0:12:02.96,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And it is widely viewed

227
0:12:04.24,000 --> 0:12:07,000
that that move was the pivotal move in their victory.

228
0:12:09.44,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Interestingly, it wasn't actually Kerr's idea.

229
0:12:14.56,000 --> 0:12:17,000
It was the idea of his 28-year-old assistant, Nick U'Ren.

230
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Because of Kerr's leadership style,

231
0:12:21.36,000 --> 0:12:23,000
U'Ren felt comfortable bringing the idea forward.

232
0:12:25.24,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And Kerr not only listened,

233
0:12:27.24,000 --> 0:12:28,000
but he implemented the idea

234
0:12:29.52,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and then afterwards,

235
0:12:31.2,000 --> 0:12:32,000
gave U'Ren all the credit --

236
0:12:34.52,000 --> 0:12:39,000
actions all consistent with Kerr's highly inclusive approach to leadership.

237
0:12:41.28,000 --> 0:12:43,000
In the era of "always-on" transformation,

238
0:12:43.96,000 --> 0:12:46,000
organizations are always going to be transforming.

239
0:12:49.2,000 --> 0:12:52,000
But doing so does not have to be exhausting.

240
0:12:54.08,000 --> 0:12:56,000
We owe it to ourselves,

241
0:12:56.28,000 --> 0:12:57,000
to our organizations

242
0:12:58.28,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and to society more broadly

243
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:04,000
to boldly transform our approach to transformation.

244
0:13:05.92,000 --> 0:13:06,000
To do that,

245
0:13:07.6,000 --> 0:13:1,000
we need to start putting people first.

246
0:13:11.8,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Thank you.

247
0:13:13.04,000 --> 0:13:19,000
(Applause)

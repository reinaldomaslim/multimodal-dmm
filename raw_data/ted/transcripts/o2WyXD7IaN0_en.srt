1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
How would you like to be better than you are?

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Suppose I said

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
that, with just a few changes in your genes,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
you could get a better memory --

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
more precise,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
more accurate and quicker.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Or maybe you'd like to be more fit, stronger,

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
with more stamina.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Would you like to be more attractive and self-confident?

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
How about living longer with good health?

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Or perhaps you're one of those

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
who's always yearned for more creativity.

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Which one would you like the most?

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Which would you like, if you could have just one?

15
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Audience Member: Creativity.)

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Creativity.

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
How many people would choose creativity?

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Raise your hands. Let me see.

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
A few. Probably about as many as there are creative people here.

20
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
(Laughter) That's very good.

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
How many would opt for memory?

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Quite a few more.

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
How about fitness?

24
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
A few less.

25
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
What about longevity?

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Ah, the majority. That makes me feel very good as a doctor.

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
If you could have any one of these,

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
it would be a very different world.

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Is it just imaginary?

30
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Or, is it, perhaps, possible?

31
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Evolution has been a perennial topic

32
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
here at the TED Conference,

33
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
but I want to give you today

34
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
one doctor's take on the subject.

35
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
The great 20th-century geneticist,

36
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
T.G. Dobzhansky,

37
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
who was also a communicant

38
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
in the Russian Orthodox Church,

39
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
once wrote an essay that he titled

40
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
"Nothing in Biology Makes Sense

41
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Except in the Light of Evolution."

42
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
Now if you are one of those

43
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution,

44
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid,

45
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
take out your personal communications device --

46
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I give you permission --

47
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and perhaps take another look at Kathryn Schultz's book on being wrong,

48
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
because nothing in the rest of this talk

49
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
is going to make any sense whatsoever to you.

50
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
(Laughter)

51
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
But if you do accept

52
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
biological evolution,

53
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
consider this:

54
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
is it just about the past,

55
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
or is it about the future?

56
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Does it apply to others,

57
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
or does it apply to us?

58
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
This is another look at the tree of life.

59
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
In this picture,

60
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I've put a bush with a center branching out in all directions,

61
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
because if you look at the edges

62
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
of the tree of life,

63
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
every existing species

64
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
at the tips of those branches

65
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
has succeeded in evolutionary terms:

66
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
it has survived;

67
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
it has demonstrated a fitness

68
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
to its environment.

69
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
The human part of this branch,

70
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
way out on one end,

71
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
is, of course, the one that we are most interested in.

72
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
We branch off of a common ancestor

73
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
to modern chimpanzees

74
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
about six or eight million years ago.

75
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
In the interval,

76
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
there have been perhaps 20 or 25

77
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
different species of hominids.

78
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Some have come and gone.

79
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
We have been here for about 130,000 years.

80
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
It may seem like we're quite remote

81
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
from other parts of this tree of life,

82
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
but actually, for the most part,

83
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
the basic machinery of our cells

84
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
is pretty much the same.

85
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Do you realize that we can take advantage

86
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium

87
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
to produce the protein of human insulin

88
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
used to treat diabetics?

89
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
This is not like human insulin;

90
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
this is the same protein

91
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
that is chemically indistinguishable

92
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
from what comes out of your pancreas.

93
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And speaking of bacteria,

94
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
do you realize that each of us carries in our gut

95
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
more bacteria

96
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
than there are cells in the rest of our body?

97
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Maybe 10 times more.

98
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I mean think of it,

99
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
when Antonio Damasio asks about your self-image,

100
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
do you think about the bacteria?

101
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment

102
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
for those bacteria.

103
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It's warm, it's dark, it's moist,

104
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
it's very cozy.

105
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And you're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want

106
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
with no effort on their part.

107
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
It's really like an Easy Street for bacteria,

108
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
with the occasional interruption

109
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
of the unintended forced rush to the exit.

110
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
But otherwise,

111
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria,

112
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
just as they are essential to your life.

113
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
They help in the digestion of essential nutrients,

114
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and they protect you against certain diseases.

115
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
But what will come in the future?

116
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise

117
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
as a species?

118
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Or, are we destined

119
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
to become something different --

120
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
something, perhaps, even better adapted

121
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
to the environment?

122
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Now let's take a step back in time

123
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
to the Big Bang, 14 billion years ago --

124
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
the Earth, the solar system,

125
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
about four and a half billion years --

126
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
the first signs of proto-life,

127
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth --

128
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
the first multi-celled organisms,

129
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
perhaps as much

130
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
as 800 or a billion years ago --

131
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and then the human species,

132
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
finally emerging

133
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
in the last 130,000 years.

134
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
In this vast unfinished symphony of the universe,

135
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
life on Earth is like a brief measure;

136
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
the animal kingdom,

137
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
like a single measure;

138
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and human life,

139
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
a small grace note.

140
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
That was us.

141
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
That also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk,

142
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
so I hope you enjoyed it.

143
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
(Laughter)

144
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Now when I was a freshman in college,

145
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I took my first biology class.

146
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I was fascinated

147
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
by the elegance and beauty of biology.

148
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I became enamored of the power of evolution,

149
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and I realized something very fundamental:

150
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
in most of the existence of life

151
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
in single-celled organisms,

152
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
each cell simply divides,

153
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and all of the genetic energy of that cell

154
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
is carried on in both daughter cells.

155
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
But at the time multi-celled organisms come online,

156
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
things start to change.

157
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Sexual reproduction enters the picture.

158
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And very importantly,

159
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
with the introduction of sexual reproduction

160
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that passes on the genome,

161
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
the rest of the body

162
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
becomes expendable.

163
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
In fact, you could say

164
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that the inevitability of the death of our bodies

165
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
enters in evolutionary time

166
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
at the same moment

167
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
as sexual reproduction.

168
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Now I have to confess,

169
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
when I was a college undergraduate,

170
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I thought, okay, sex/death, sex/death, death for sex --

171
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
it seemed pretty reasonable at the time,

172
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
but with each passing year,

173
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I've come to have increasing doubts.

174
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I've come to understand the sentiments of George Burns,

175
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
who was performing still in Las Vegas

176
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
well into his 90s.

177
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And one night, there's a knock at his hotel room door.

178
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
He answers the door.

179
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Standing before him is a gorgeous, scantily clad showgirl.

180
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
She looks at him and says,

181
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
"I'm here for super sex."

182
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
"That's fine," says George, "I'll take the soup."

183
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
(Laughter)

184
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I came to realize,

185
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
as a physician,

186
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
that I was working toward a goal

187
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
which was different from the goal of evolution --

188
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
not necessarily contradictory, just different.

189
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
I was trying to preserve the body.

190
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I wanted to keep us healthy.

191
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I wanted to restore health from disease.

192
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I wanted us to live long and healthy lives.

193
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Evolution is all about passing on the genome

194
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
to the next generation,

195
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
adapting and surviving

196
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
through generation after generation.

197
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
From an evolutionary point of view,

198
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
you and I are like the booster rockets

199
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
designed to send the genetic payload

200
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
into the next level of orbit

201
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and then drop off into the sea.

202
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I think we would all understand the sentiment that Woody Allen expressed

203
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.

204
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I want to achieve it through not dying."

205
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
(Laughter)

206
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Evolution does not necessarily

207
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
favor the longest-lived.

208
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
It doesn't necessarily favor the biggest

209
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
or the strongest or the fastest,

210
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
and not even the smartest.

211
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Evolution favors

212
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
those creatures best adapted

213
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
to their environment.

214
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
That is the sole test

215
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
of survival and success.

216
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
At the bottom of the ocean,

217
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
bacteria that are thermophilic

218
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and can survive at the steam vent heat

219
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
that would otherwise produce, if fish were there,

220
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
sous-vide cooked fish,

221
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
nevertheless, have managed

222
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
to make that a hospitable environment for them.

223
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So what does this mean,

224
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
as we look back at what has happened in evolution,

225
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and as we think about the place again

226
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
of humans in evolution,

227
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and particularly as we look ahead

228
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
to the next phase,

229
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
I would say

230
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
that there are a number of possibilities.

231
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
The first is that we will not evolve.

232
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
We have reached

233
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
a kind of equipoise.

234
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And the reasoning behind that would be,

235
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
first, we have, through medicine,

236
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
managed to preserve a lot of genes

237
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
that would otherwise be selected out

238
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and be removed from the population.

239
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And secondly, we as a species

240
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
have so configured our environment

241
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
that we have managed to make it adapt to us

242
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
as well as we adapt to it.

243
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And by the way, we immigrate and circulate

244
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and intermix so much

245
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
that you can't any longer

246
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
have the isolation that is necessary

247
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
for evolution to take place.

248
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
A second possibility

249
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind,

250
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
natural, imposed by the forces of nature.

251
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And the argument here would be

252
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that the wheels of evolution grind slowly,

253
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
but they are inexorable.

254
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And as far as isolation goes,

255
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
when we as a species

256
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
do colonize distant planets,

257
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
there will be the isolation and the environmental changes

258
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
that could produce evolution

259
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
in the natural way.

260
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
But there's a third possibility,

261
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
an enticing, intriguing and frightening possibility.

262
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
I call it neo-evolution --

263
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
the new evolution

264
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
that is not simply natural,

265
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
but guided and chosen

266
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
by us as individuals

267
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
in the choices that we will make.

268
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Now how could this come about?

269
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
How could it be possible that we would do this?

270
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Consider, first, the reality

271
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
that people today, in some cultures,

272
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
are making choices about their offspring.

273
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
They're, in some cultures,

274
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
choosing to have more males than females.

275
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
It's not necessarily good for the society,

276
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
but it's what the individual and the family are choosing.

277
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Think also,

278
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
if it were possible ever

279
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
for you to choose, not simply to choose the sex of your child,

280
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
but for you in your body

281
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
to make the genetic adjustments

282
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
that would cure or prevent diseases.

283
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
What if you could make the genetic changes

284
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's

285
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
or reduce the risk of cancer

286
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
or eliminate stroke?

287
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Wouldn't you want

288
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
to make those changes

289
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
in your genes?

290
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
If we look ahead,

291
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
these kind of changes

292
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
are going to be increasingly possible.

293
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
The Human Genome Project

294
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
started in 1990,

295
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and it took 13 years.

296
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
It cost 2.7 billion dollars.

297
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
The year after it was finished in 2004,

298
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
you could do the same job

299
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
for 20 million dollars in three to four months.

300
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Today, you can have a complete sequence

301
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
of the three billion base pairs in the human genome

302
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
at a cost of about 20,000 dollars

303
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and in the space of about a week.

304
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
It won't be very long

305
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
before the reality will be

306
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
the 1,000-dollar human genome,

307
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and it will be increasingly available for everyone.

308
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Just a week ago,

309
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
the National Academy of Engineering

310
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
awarded its Draper Prize

311
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
to Francis Arnold and Willem Stemmer,

312
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
two scientists who independently developed techniques

313
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster

314
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and to lead to desirable proteins

315
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
in a more efficient way --

316
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
what Frances Arnold calls "directed evolution."

317
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
A couple of years ago, the Lasker Prize

318
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
was awarded to the scientist Shinya Yamanaka

319
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
for his research

320
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
in which he took an adult skin cell,

321
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
a fibroblast,

322
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and by manipulating just four genes,

323
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
he induced that cell

324
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
to revert to a pluripotential stem cell --

325
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
a cell potentially capable

326
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
of becoming any cell in your body.

327
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
These changes are coming.

328
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
The same technology

329
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
that has produced the human insulin in bacteria

330
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
can make viruses

331
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
that will not only protect you against themselves,

332
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
but induce immunity against other viruses.

333
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Believe it or not,

334
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
there's an experimental trial going on

335
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
with vaccine against influenza

336
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant.

337
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco?

338
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
These are all reality today,

339
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and [in] the future, will be evermore possible.

340
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Imagine then

341
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
just two other little changes.

342
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
You can change the cells in your body,

343
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
but what if you could change the cells in your offspring?

344
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
What if you could change the sperm and the ova,

345
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
or change the newly fertilized egg,

346
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and give your offspring a better chance

347
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
at a healthier life --

348
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
eliminate the diabetes, eliminate the hemophilia,

349
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
reduce the risk of cancer?

350
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Who doesn't want healthier children?

351
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
And then, that same analytic technology,

352
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
that same engine of science

353
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
that can produce

354
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
the changes to prevent disease,

355
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
will also enable us

356
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
to adopt super-attributes,

357
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
hyper-capacities --

358
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
that better memory.

359
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Why not have the quick wit

360
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
of a Ken Jennings,

361
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
especially if you can augment it

362
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
with the next generation of the Watson machine?

363
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Why not have the quick twitch muscle

364
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
that will enable you to run faster and longer?

365
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Why not live longer?

366
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
These will be irresistible.

367
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
And when we are at a position

368
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
where we can pass it on to the next generation,

369
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
and we can adopt the attributes we want,

370
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
we will have converted

371
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
old-style evolution

372
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
into neo-evolution.

373
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
We'll take a process

374
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
that normally might require 100,000 years,

375
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and we can compress it down to a thousand years --

376
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and maybe even in the next 100 years.

377
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
These are choices

378
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
that your grandchildren,

379
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
or their grandchildren,

380
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
are going to have before them.

381
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
Will we use these choices

382
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
to make a society that is better,

383
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
that is more successful, that is kinder?

384
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Or, will we selectively choose different attributes

385
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
that we want for some of us

386
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
and not for others of us?

387
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
Will we make a society

388
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
that is more boring and more uniform,

389
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
or more robust and more versatile?

390
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
These are the kinds of questions

391
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
that we will have to face.

392
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
And most profoundly of all,

393
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
will we ever be able to develop the wisdom,

394
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
and to inherit the wisdom,

395
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
that we'll need to make these choices wisely?

396
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
For better or worse,

397
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
and sooner than you may think,

398
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
these choices will be up to us.

399
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
Thank you.

400
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:12.594,000 --> 0:00:14,000
How many of you have checked your email today?

3
0:00:15.133,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Come on, raise your hands.

4
0:00:17.029,000 --> 0:00:19,000
How many of you are checking it right now?

5
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:20.718,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And how about finances? Anybody check that today?

7
0:00:23.218,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Credit card, investment account?

8
0:00:25.706,000 --> 0:00:28,000
How about this week?

9
0:00:29.659,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Now, how about your household energy use?

10
0:00:32.776,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Anybody check that today?

11
0:00:34.714,000 --> 0:00:38,000
This week? Last week?

12
0:00:38.866,000 --> 0:00:41,000
A few energy geeks spread out across the room.

13
0:00:41.994,000 --> 0:00:43,000
It's good to see you guys.

14
0:00:44.563,000 --> 0:00:47,000
But the rest of us -- this is a room filled with people

15
0:00:47.798,000 --> 0:00:49,000
who are passionate about the future of this planet,

16
0:00:50.78,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and even we aren't paying attention

17
0:00:52.611,000 --> 0:00:54,000
to the energy use that's driving climate change.

18
0:00:55.571,000 --> 0:00:57,000
The woman in the photo with me is Harriet.

19
0:00:58.226,000 --> 0:01:,000
We met her on our first family vacation.

20
0:01:00.763,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Harriet's paying attention to her energy use,

21
0:01:03.125,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and she is decidedly not an energy geek.

22
0:01:05.985,000 --> 0:01:1,000
This is the story of how Harriet came to pay attention.

23
0:01:11.224,000 --> 0:01:13,000
This is coal,

24
0:01:13.253,000 --> 0:01:16,000
the most common source of electricity on the planet,

25
0:01:16.61,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and there's enough energy in this coal

26
0:01:19.834,000 --> 0:01:22,000
to light this bulb for more than a year.

27
0:01:23.786,000 --> 0:01:25,000
But unfortunately, between here and here,

28
0:01:25.857,000 --> 0:01:26,000
most of that energy is lost to things

29
0:01:27.289,000 --> 0:01:29,000
like transmission leakage and heat.

30
0:01:30.174,000 --> 0:01:33,000
In fact, only 10 percent ends up as light.

31
0:01:33.753,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So this coal will last a little bit more than a month.

32
0:01:37.761,000 --> 0:01:39,000
If you wanted to light this bulb for a year,

33
0:01:40.37,000 --> 0:01:45,000
you'd need this much coal.

34
0:01:45.408,000 --> 0:01:48,000
The bad news here is that, for every unit of energy we use,

35
0:01:48.452,000 --> 0:01:5,000
we waste nine.

36
0:01:50.525,000 --> 0:01:51,000
That means there's good news,

37
0:01:52.156,000 --> 0:01:54,000
because for every unit of energy we save,

38
0:01:54.739,000 --> 0:01:57,000
we save the other nine.

39
0:01:58.004,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So the question is, how can we get the people in this room

40
0:02:03.3,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and across the globe to start paying attention

41
0:02:06.266,000 --> 0:02:08,000
to the energy we're using,

42
0:02:08.352,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and start wasting less of it?

43
0:02:11.328,000 --> 0:02:13,000
The answer comes from a behavioral science experiment

44
0:02:13.715,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that was run one hot summer, 10 years ago,

45
0:02:17.096,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and only 90 miles from here,

46
0:02:19.232,000 --> 0:02:22,000
in San Marcos, California.

47
0:02:22.608,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Graduate students put signs on every door in a neighborhood,

48
0:02:25.289,000 --> 0:02:27,000
asking people to turn off their air conditioning

49
0:02:28.11,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and turn on their fans.

50
0:02:30.32,000 --> 0:02:32,000
One quarter of the homes received a message that said,

51
0:02:32.608,000 --> 0:02:34,000
did you know you could save 54 dollars a month this summer?

52
0:02:34.926,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Turn off your air conditioning, turn on your fans.

53
0:02:36.744,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Another group got an environmental message.

54
0:02:38.578,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And still a third group got a message about

55
0:02:40.667,000 --> 0:02:42,000
being good citizens, preventing blackouts.

56
0:02:43.347,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Most people guessed that money-saving message would work best of all.

57
0:02:47.064,000 --> 0:02:49,000
In fact, none of these messages worked.

58
0:02:49.677,000 --> 0:02:51,000
They had zero impact on energy consumption.

59
0:02:52.533,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It was as if the grad students hadn't shown up at all.

60
0:02:56.654,000 --> 0:02:57,000
But there was a fourth message,

61
0:02:58.474,000 --> 0:03:,000
and this message simply said,

62
0:03:00.597,000 --> 0:03:03,000
"When surveyed, 77 percent of your neighbors

63
0:03:04.507,000 --> 0:03:06,000
said that they turned off their air conditioning and turned on their fans.

64
0:03:06.997,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Please join them. Turn off your air conditioning

65
0:03:08.802,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and turn on your fans."

66
0:03:10.063,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And wouldn't you know it, they did.

67
0:03:12.76,000 --> 0:03:13,000
The people who received this message

68
0:03:14.714,000 --> 0:03:16,000
showed a marked decrease in energy consumption

69
0:03:17.236,000 --> 0:03:2,000
simply by being told what their neighbors were doing.

70
0:03:20.647,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So what does this tell us?

71
0:03:22.347,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Well, if something is inconvenient,

72
0:03:24.564,000 --> 0:03:25,000
even if we believe in it,

73
0:03:26.553,000 --> 0:03:29,000
moral suasion, financial incentives, don't do much to move us --

74
0:03:30.431,000 --> 0:03:33,000
but social pressure, that's powerful stuff.

75
0:03:34.101,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And harnessed correctly, it can be a powerful force for good.

76
0:03:37.719,000 --> 0:03:39,000
In fact, it already is.

77
0:03:39.884,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Inspired by this insight, my friend Dan Yates and I

78
0:03:42.516,000 --> 0:03:44,000
started a company called Opower.

79
0:03:44.692,000 --> 0:03:46,000
We built software and partnered with utility companies

80
0:03:47.161,000 --> 0:03:49,000
who wanted to help their customers save energy.

81
0:03:49.964,000 --> 0:03:52,000
We deliver personalized home energy reports

82
0:03:53.03,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that show people how their consumption

83
0:03:54.748,000 --> 0:03:56,000
compares to their neighbors in similar-sized homes.

84
0:03:57.62,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Just like those effective door hangers,

85
0:03:59.86,000 --> 0:04:01,000
we have people comparing themselves to their neighbors,

86
0:04:02.324,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and then we give everyone targeted recommendations

87
0:04:04.84,000 --> 0:04:05,000
to help them save.

88
0:04:06.49,000 --> 0:04:08,000
We started with paper, we moved to a mobile application,

89
0:04:08.796,000 --> 0:04:1,000
web, and now even a controllable thermostat,

90
0:04:11.725,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and for the last five years we've been running

91
0:04:13.742,000 --> 0:04:17,000
the largest behavioral science experiment in the world.

92
0:04:18.145,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And it's working.

93
0:04:19.809,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Ordinary homeowners and renters have saved

94
0:04:21.906,000 --> 0:04:24,000
more than 250 million dollars on their energy bills,

95
0:04:25.046,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and we're just getting started.

96
0:04:26.559,000 --> 0:04:29,000
This year alone, in partnership with more than 80 utilities

97
0:04:29.819,000 --> 0:04:31,000
in six countries, we're going to generate

98
0:04:32.073,000 --> 0:04:35,000
another two terawatt hours of electricity savings.

99
0:04:35.225,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Now, the energy geeks in the room know two terawatt hours,

100
0:04:37.266,000 --> 0:04:39,000
but for the rest of us, two terawatt hours

101
0:04:39.305,000 --> 0:04:42,000
is more than enough energy to power every home

102
0:04:42.644,000 --> 0:04:45,000
in St. Louis and Salt Lake City combined

103
0:04:45.938,000 --> 0:04:46,000
for more than a year.

104
0:04:47.506,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Two terawatt hours, it's roughly half

105
0:04:49.472,000 --> 0:04:51,000
what the U.S. solar industry produced last year.

106
0:04:52.058,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And two terawatt hours? In terms of coal,

107
0:04:55.649,000 --> 0:04:58,000
we'd need to burn 34 of these wheelbarrows

108
0:04:58.806,000 --> 0:05:01,000
every minute around the clock every day for an entire year

109
0:05:02.802,000 --> 0:05:04,000
to get two terawatt hours of electricity.

110
0:05:04.906,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And we're not burning anything.

111
0:05:06.223,000 --> 0:05:07,000
We're just motivating people to pay attention

112
0:05:07.951,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and change their behavior.

113
0:05:10.964,000 --> 0:05:12,000
But we're just one company, and this is just

114
0:05:13.254,000 --> 0:05:15,000
scratching the surface.

115
0:05:15.391,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Twenty percent of the electricity in homes is wasted,

116
0:05:18.956,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and when I say wasted, I don't mean that people have

117
0:05:20.96,000 --> 0:05:23,000
inefficient lightbulbs. They may.

118
0:05:24.313,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I mean we leave the lights on in empty rooms,

119
0:05:27.457,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and we leave the air conditioning on when nobody's home.

120
0:05:30.487,000 --> 0:05:33,000
That's 40 billion dollars a year wasted

121
0:05:33.571,000 --> 0:05:36,000
on electricity that does not contribute to our well-being

122
0:05:36.82,000 --> 0:05:38,000
but does contribute to climate change.

123
0:05:39.467,000 --> 0:05:41,000
That's 40 billion -- with a B --

124
0:05:41.587,000 --> 0:05:43,000
every year in the U.S. alone.

125
0:05:43.87,000 --> 0:05:46,000
That's half our coal usage right there.

126
0:05:47.235,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Now thankfully, some of the world's best material scientists

127
0:05:50.007,000 --> 0:05:53,000
are looking to replace coal with sustainable resources

128
0:05:53.513,000 --> 0:05:54,000
like these,

129
0:05:54.651,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and this is both fantastic and essential.

130
0:05:58.149,000 --> 0:06:,000
But the most overlooked resource to get us

131
0:06:00.187,000 --> 0:06:03,000
to a sustainable energy future, it isn't on this slide.

132
0:06:03.733,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It's in this room. It's you, and it's me.

133
0:06:08.389,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And we can harness this resource

134
0:06:11.073,000 --> 0:06:12,000
with no new material science

135
0:06:12.91,000 --> 0:06:15,000
simply by applying behavioral science.

136
0:06:16.102,000 --> 0:06:18,000
We can do it today, we know it works,

137
0:06:18.186,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and it will save us money right away.

138
0:06:21.914,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So what are we waiting for?

139
0:06:24.665,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Well, in most places, utility regulation

140
0:06:27.392,000 --> 0:06:31,000
hasn't changed much since Thomas Edison.

141
0:06:31.708,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Utilities are still rewarded when their customers

142
0:06:34.638,000 --> 0:06:35,000
waste energy.

143
0:06:36.202,000 --> 0:06:39,000
They ought to be rewarded for helping their customers save it.

144
0:06:40.005,000 --> 0:06:43,000
But this story is much more than about household energy use.

145
0:06:43.411,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Take a look at the Prius.

146
0:06:45.473,000 --> 0:06:48,000
It's efficient not only because Toyota invested in material science

147
0:06:48.495,000 --> 0:06:5,000
but because they invested in behavioral science.

148
0:06:50.97,000 --> 0:06:52,000
The dashboard that shows drivers how much energy

149
0:06:53.11,000 --> 0:06:54,000
they're saving in real time

150
0:06:55.074,000 --> 0:06:56,000
makes former speed demons

151
0:06:56.589,000 --> 0:06:58,000
drive more like cautious grandmothers.

152
0:06:59.342,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Which brings us back to Harriet.

153
0:07:01.906,000 --> 0:07:03,000
We met her on our first family vacation.

154
0:07:04.094,000 --> 0:07:06,000
She came over to meet my young daughter,

155
0:07:06.281,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and she was tickled to learn that my daughter's name

156
0:07:08.452,000 --> 0:07:1,000
is also Harriet.

157
0:07:10.506,000 --> 0:07:11,000
She asked me what I did for a living,

158
0:07:11.931,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and I told her, I work with utilities

159
0:07:13.476,000 --> 0:07:14,000
to help people save energy.

160
0:07:15.352,000 --> 0:07:17,000
It was then that her eyes lit up.

161
0:07:17.578,000 --> 0:07:18,000
She looked at me, and she said,

162
0:07:19.51,000 --> 0:07:21,000
"You're exactly the person I need to talk to.

163
0:07:21.738,000 --> 0:07:23,000
You see, two weeks ago, my husband and I got a letter

164
0:07:23.921,000 --> 0:07:25,000
in the mail from our utility.

165
0:07:26.241,000 --> 0:07:29,000
It told us we were using twice as much energy as our neighbors."

166
0:07:29.439,000 --> 0:07:32,000
(Laughter)

167
0:07:32.869,000 --> 0:07:34,000
"And for the last two weeks, all we can think about,

168
0:07:35.689,000 --> 0:07:37,000
talk about, and even argue about,

169
0:07:37.977,000 --> 0:07:38,000
is what we should be doing to save energy.

170
0:07:39.697,000 --> 0:07:41,000
We did everything that letter told us to do,

171
0:07:42.562,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and still I know there must be more.

172
0:07:45.364,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Now I'm here with a genuine expert.

173
0:07:47.042,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Tell me. What should I do to save energy?"

174
0:07:51.801,000 --> 0:07:55,000
There are many experts who can help answer Harriet's question.

175
0:07:55.853,000 --> 0:07:57,000
My goal is to make sure

176
0:07:57.915,000 --> 0:07:59,000
we are all asking it.

177
0:08:00.213,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Thank you.

178
0:08:01.571,000 --> 0:08:05,000
(Applause)

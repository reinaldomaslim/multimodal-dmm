1
0:00:18.798,000 --> 0:00:21,000
How many of you have seen the Alfred Hitchcock film "The Birds"?

2
0:00:22.171,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Any of you get really freaked out by that?

3
0:00:24.868,000 --> 0:00:25,000
You might want to leave now.

4
0:00:26.275,000 --> 0:00:27,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
So this is a vending machine for crows.

6
0:00:29.357,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Over the past few days, many of you have been asking,

7
0:00:31.874,000 --> 0:00:33,000
"How did you come to this? How did you get started doing this?"

8
0:00:34.888,000 --> 0:00:35,000
It started, as with many great ideas,

9
0:00:36.681,000 --> 0:00:38,000
or many ideas you can't get rid of, anyway,

10
0:00:38.741,000 --> 0:00:39,000
at a cocktail party.

11
0:00:39.92,000 --> 0:00:42,000
About 10 years ago, I was at a cocktail party with a friend of mine.

12
0:00:43.154,000 --> 0:00:45,000
We were sitting there, and he was complaining about the crows

13
0:00:46.067,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that were all over his yard and making a big mess.

14
0:00:48.462,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And he was telling me we ought to eradicate these things,

15
0:00:51.188,000 --> 0:00:52,000
kill them, because they're making a mess.

16
0:00:53.184,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I said that was stupid,

17
0:00:54.359,000 --> 0:00:56,000
maybe we should just train them to do something useful.

18
0:00:56.956,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And he said that was impossible.

19
0:00:58.511,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And I'm sure I'm in good company in finding that tremendously annoying,

20
0:01:01.907,000 --> 0:01:02,000
when someone tells you it's impossible.

21
0:01:03.811,000 --> 0:01:06,000
So I spent the next 10 years reading about crows in my spare time.

22
0:01:06.965,000 --> 0:01:08,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:09.765,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And after 10 years of this, my wife said,

24
0:01:11.986,000 --> 0:01:13,000
"You've got to do this thing you've been talking about,

25
0:01:14.63,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and build the vending machine."

26
0:01:16.149,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So I did.

27
0:01:17.324,000 --> 0:01:19,000
But part of the reason I found this interesting is,

28
0:01:19.793,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I started noticing that we're very aware of all the species

29
0:01:22.649,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that are going extinct on the planet

30
0:01:24.468,000 --> 0:01:26,000
as a result of human habitation expansion,

31
0:01:26.561,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and no one seems to be paying attention to all the species

32
0:01:29.53,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that are actually living; they're surviving.

33
0:01:31.622,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And I'm talking specifically about synanthropic species,

34
0:01:34.371,000 --> 0:01:36,000
which have adapted specifically for human ecologies,

35
0:01:37.073,000 --> 0:01:4,000
species like rats and cockroaches and crows.

36
0:01:40.46,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And as I started looking at them, I was finding that they had hyper-adapted.

37
0:01:44.098,000 --> 0:01:46,000
They'd become extremely adept at living with us.

38
0:01:46.514,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And in return, we just tried to kill them all the time.

39
0:01:49.211,000 --> 0:01:5,000
(Laughter)

40
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And in doing so, we were breeding them for parasitism.

41
0:01:52.927,000 --> 0:01:55,000
We were giving them all sorts of reasons to adapt new ways.

42
0:01:56.912,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So, for example, rats are incredibly responsive breeders.

43
0:01:59.694,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And cockroaches, as anyone who's tried to get rid of them knows,

44
0:02:02.737,000 --> 0:02:05,000
have become really immune to the poisons that we're using.

45
0:02:05.763,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So I thought, let's build something that's mutually beneficial;

46
0:02:09.421,000 --> 0:02:1,000
something that we can both benefit from,

47
0:02:11.425,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and find some way to make a new relationship with these species.

48
0:02:14.468,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So I built the vending machine.

49
0:02:16.134,000 --> 0:02:19,000
But the story of the vending machine is a little more interesting

50
0:02:19.228,000 --> 0:02:2,000
if you know more about crows.

51
0:02:20.639,000 --> 0:02:22,000
It turns out, crows aren't just surviving with human beings;

52
0:02:23.505,000 --> 0:02:24,000
they're actually thriving.

53
0:02:24.77,000 --> 0:02:26,000
They're found everywhere on the planet except for the Arctic

54
0:02:27.631,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and the southern tip of South America.

55
0:02:29.467,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And in all that area, they're only rarely found breeding

56
0:02:32.182,000 --> 0:02:34,000
more than five kilometers away from human beings.

57
0:02:34.525,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So we may not think about them, but they're always around.

58
0:02:37.299,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And not surprisingly, given the human population growth,

59
0:02:39.967,000 --> 0:02:41,000
more than half of the human population is living in cities now.

60
0:02:42.967,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And out of those, nine-tenths of the human growth population

61
0:02:45.806,000 --> 0:02:46,000
is occurring in cities.

62
0:02:46.988,000 --> 0:02:48,000
We're seeing a population boom with crows.

63
0:02:49.185,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So bird counts are indicating

64
0:02:51.254,000 --> 0:02:54,000
that we might be seeing up to exponential growth in their numbers.

65
0:02:54.426,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So that's no great surprise.

66
0:02:56.097,000 --> 0:02:58,000
But what was really interesting to me was to find out

67
0:02:58.614,000 --> 0:03:,000
that the birds were adapting in a pretty unusual way.

68
0:03:02.611,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And I'll give you an example of that.

69
0:03:05.17,000 --> 0:03:07,000
This is Betty. She's a New Caledonian crow.

70
0:03:07.464,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And these crows use sticks in the wild

71
0:03:09.894,000 --> 0:03:11,000
to get insects and whatnot out of pieces of wood.

72
0:03:12.552,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Here, she's trying to get a piece of meat out of a tube.

73
0:03:15.242,000 --> 0:03:16,000
But the researchers had a problem.

74
0:03:16.909,000 --> 0:03:18,000
They messed up and left just a stick of wire in there.

75
0:03:19.481,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And she hadn't had the opportunity to do this before.

76
0:03:22.028,000 --> 0:03:23,000
You see, it wasn't working very well.

77
0:03:24.52,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So she adapted.

78
0:03:27.117,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Now, this is completely unprompted; she had never seen this done before.

79
0:03:30.544,000 --> 0:03:32,000
No one taught her to bend this into a hook

80
0:03:32.58,000 --> 0:03:33,000
or had shown her how it could happen.

81
0:03:34.385,000 --> 0:03:35,000
But she did it all on her own.

82
0:03:35.862,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So keep in mind -- she's never seen this done.

83
0:03:38.347,000 --> 0:03:39,000
(Laughter)

84
0:03:39.962,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Right.

85
0:03:41.169,000 --> 0:03:47,000
(Laughter)

86
0:03:47.828,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Yeah. All right.

87
0:03:49.276,000 --> 0:03:53,000
(Applause)

88
0:03:53.945,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So that's the part where the researchers freak out.

89
0:03:56.45,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Laughter)

90
0:03:58.243,000 --> 0:03:59,000
It turns out,

91
0:03:59.434,000 --> 0:04:02,000
we've been finding more and more that crows are really intelligent.

92
0:04:02.698,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Their brains are in the same proportion as chimpanzee brains are.

93
0:04:06.954,000 --> 0:04:07,000
There's all kinds of anecdotes

94
0:04:08.42,000 --> 0:04:1,000
for the different kinds of intelligence they have.

95
0:04:10.806,000 --> 0:04:12,000
For example, in Sweden, crows will wait for fishermen

96
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
to drop lines through holes in the ice.

97
0:04:15.247,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And when the fishermen move off,

98
0:04:16.811,000 --> 0:04:19,000
the crows fly down, reel up the lines, and eat the fish or the bait.

99
0:04:20.076,000 --> 0:04:21,000
It's pretty annoying for the fishermen.

100
0:04:22.038,000 --> 0:04:23,000
On an entirely different tack,

101
0:04:23.501,000 --> 0:04:25,000
at University of Washington a few years ago,

102
0:04:26.115,000 --> 0:04:29,000
they were doing an experiment where they captured some crows on campus.

103
0:04:29.499,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Some students went out, netted some crows, brought them in,

104
0:04:32.341,000 --> 0:04:34,000
weighed and measured them, and let them back out again.

105
0:04:34.949,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And they were entertained to discover that for the rest of the week,

106
0:04:38.185,000 --> 0:04:4,000
whenever these particular students walked around campus,

107
0:04:40.841,000 --> 0:04:42,000
these crows would caw at them and run around,

108
0:04:42.976,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and make their life kind of miserable.

109
0:04:44.812,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Laughter)

110
0:04:45.838,000 --> 0:04:46,000
They were significantly less entertained

111
0:04:47.807,000 --> 0:04:48,000
when this went on for the next week.

112
0:04:49.56,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And the next month.

113
0:04:50.857,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And after summer break.

114
0:04:52.609,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Until they finally graduated and left campus,

115
0:04:54.932,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and -- glad to get away, I'm sure --

116
0:04:56.696,000 --> 0:04:59,000
came back sometime later, and found the crows still remembered them.

117
0:04:59.959,000 --> 0:05:,000
(Laughter)

118
0:05:00.989,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So, the moral being: don't piss off crows.

119
0:05:03.088,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So now, students at the University of Washington

120
0:05:06.331,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that are studying these crows, do so with a giant wig and a big mask.

121
0:05:09.727,000 --> 0:05:11,000
(Laughter)

122
0:05:11.966,000 --> 0:05:12,000
It's fairly interesting.

123
0:05:13.3,000 --> 0:05:14,000
(Laughter)

124
0:05:14.895,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So we know these crows are really smart,

125
0:05:16.843,000 --> 0:05:18,000
but the more I dug into this, the more I found

126
0:05:19.047,000 --> 0:05:22,000
that they actually have an even more significant adaptation.

127
0:05:23.276,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Video: Crows have become highly skilled at making a living

128
0:05:26.714,000 --> 0:05:28,000
in these new urban environments.

129
0:05:29.085,000 --> 0:05:32,000
In this Japanese city, they have devised a way of eating a food

130
0:05:33.02,000 --> 0:05:35,000
that normally they can't manage:

131
0:05:37.623,000 --> 0:05:38,000
drop it among the traffic.

132
0:05:43.633,000 --> 0:05:48,000
The problem now is collecting the bits, without getting run over.

133
0:05:48.798,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Wait for the light to stop the traffic.

134
0:06:02.939,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Then, collect your cracked nut in safety.

135
0:06:10.032,000 --> 0:06:11,000
(Laughter)

136
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
(Applause)

137
0:06:12.433,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Joshua Klein: Yeah, pretty interesting.

138
0:06:14.45,000 --> 0:06:16,000
What's significant about this isn't that crows are using cars

139
0:06:17.411,000 --> 0:06:18,000
to crack nuts.

140
0:06:18.586,000 --> 0:06:19,000
In fact, that's old hat for crows.

141
0:06:20.251,000 --> 0:06:21,000
This happened about 10 years ago

142
0:06:21.81,000 --> 0:06:23,000
in a place called Sendai City, at a driving school

143
0:06:24.361,000 --> 0:06:25,000
in the suburbs of Tokyo.

144
0:06:26.067,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And since that time,

145
0:06:27.246,000 --> 0:06:3,000
all the crows in the neighborhood are picking up this behavior.

146
0:06:30.332,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Now every crow within five kilometers is standing by a sidewalk,

147
0:06:33.383,000 --> 0:06:34,000
waiting to collect its lunch.

148
0:06:35.321,000 --> 0:06:38,000
So they're learning from each other. And research bears this out.

149
0:06:38.415,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Parents seem to be teaching their young.

150
0:06:40.953,000 --> 0:06:42,000
They learn from their peers, they learn from their enemies.

151
0:06:43.827,000 --> 0:06:44,000
If I have a little extra time,

152
0:06:45.306,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I'll tell you about a case of crow infidelity

153
0:06:47.477,000 --> 0:06:48,000
that illustrates that nicely.

154
0:06:49.342,000 --> 0:06:51,000
The point being, they've developed cultural adaptation.

155
0:06:52.034,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And as we heard yesterday,

156
0:06:53.303,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that's the Pandora's box that's getting human beings in trouble,

157
0:06:56.369,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and we're starting to see it with them.

158
0:06:58.266,000 --> 0:07:,000
They're able to very quickly and very flexibly adapt

159
0:07:00.826,000 --> 0:07:02,000
to new challenges and new resources in their environment,

160
0:07:03.578,000 --> 0:07:05,000
which is really useful if you live in a city.

161
0:07:07.011,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So we know that there's lots of crows.

162
0:07:09.117,000 --> 0:07:12,000
We found out they're really smart and they can teach each other.

163
0:07:12.202,000 --> 0:07:13,000
When all this became clear,

164
0:07:13.527,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I realized the only obvious thing to do is build a vending machine.

165
0:07:16.714,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So that's what we did.

166
0:07:17.891,000 --> 0:07:18,000
This is a vending machine for crows.

167
0:07:19.652,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And it uses Skinnerian training to shape their behavior over four stages.

168
0:07:23.343,000 --> 0:07:24,000
It's pretty simple.

169
0:07:24.724,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Basically, what happens is that we put this out in a field

170
0:07:27.752,000 --> 0:07:28,000
or someplace where there's lots of crows.

171
0:07:29.746,000 --> 0:07:31,000
We put coins and peanuts all around the base of the machine.

172
0:07:32.607,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Crows eventually come by, eat the peanuts,

173
0:07:34.672,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and get used to the machine being there.

174
0:07:36.63,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Eventually, they eat all the peanuts.

175
0:07:38.435,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Then they see peanuts here on the feeder tray,

176
0:07:40.778,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and hop up and help themselves.

177
0:07:42.524,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Then they leave, the machine spits up more coins and peanuts,

178
0:07:45.421,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and life is dandy if you're a crow --

179
0:07:47.215,000 --> 0:07:49,000
you can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut.

180
0:07:49.685,000 --> 0:07:52,000
So when they get really used to that, we move on to the crows coming back.

181
0:07:53.194,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Now they're used to the sound of the machine;

182
0:07:55.321,000 --> 0:07:57,000
they keep coming back and digging out peanuts

183
0:07:57.457,000 --> 0:07:58,000
from the pile of coins that's there.

184
0:07:59.204,000 --> 0:08:01,000
When they get really happy about this, we stymie them.

185
0:08:01.764,000 --> 0:08:03,000
We move to the third stage, where we only give them a coin.

186
0:08:04.582,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Now, like most of us who have gotten used to a good thing,

187
0:08:07.344,000 --> 0:08:08,000
this really pisses them off.

188
0:08:08.707,000 --> 0:08:11,000
So they do what they do in nature when they're looking for something:

189
0:08:12.011,000 --> 0:08:14,000
sweep things out of the way with their beak.

190
0:08:14.108,000 --> 0:08:16,000
They do that here, and that knocks the coins down the slot.

191
0:08:16.974,000 --> 0:08:17,000
When that happens, they get a peanut.

192
0:08:18.784,000 --> 0:08:19,000
This goes on for some time.

193
0:08:20.103,000 --> 0:08:22,000
The crows learn that all they have to do is show up,

194
0:08:22.563,000 --> 0:08:24,000
wait for the coin to come out, put it in the slot,

195
0:08:24.937,000 --> 0:08:25,000
then get their peanut.

196
0:08:26.112,000 --> 0:08:28,000
When they're good and comfortable with that,

197
0:08:28.215,000 --> 0:08:31,000
we move to the final stage, where they show up and nothing happens.

198
0:08:31.41,000 --> 0:08:34,000
This is where we see the difference between crows and other animals.

199
0:08:34.641,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Squirrels, for example, would show up, look for the peanut, go away.

200
0:08:38.377,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Come back, look for the peanut, go away.

201
0:08:40.955,000 --> 0:08:42,000
They do this maybe half a dozen times before they get bored,

202
0:08:43.817,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and then they go off and play in traffic.

203
0:08:45.818,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Crows, on the other hand, show up and they try and figure it out.

204
0:08:49.49,000 --> 0:08:51,000
They know this machine has been messing with them

205
0:08:51.819,000 --> 0:08:53,000
through three different stages of behavior.

206
0:08:53.865,000 --> 0:08:54,000
(Laughter)

207
0:08:54.891,000 --> 0:08:55,000
They figure there must be more to it.

208
0:08:56.694,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So they poke at it and peck at it.

209
0:08:58.527,000 --> 0:09:,000
And eventually some crow gets a bright idea:

210
0:09:00.705,000 --> 0:09:03,000
"Hey, there's lots of coins lying around from the first stage,

211
0:09:04.65,000 --> 0:09:08,000
hops down, picks it up, drops it in the slot, and we're off to the races.

212
0:09:08.839,000 --> 0:09:1,000
That crow enjoys a temporary monopoly on peanuts,

213
0:09:11.283,000 --> 0:09:14,000
until his friends figure out how to do it, and then there we go.

214
0:09:14.95,000 --> 0:09:16,000
So, what's significant about this to me

215
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
isn't that we can train crows to pick up peanuts.

216
0:09:19.688,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Mind you, there's 216 million dollars' worth of change lost every year,

217
0:09:23.542,000 --> 0:09:25,000
but I'm not sure I can depend on that ROI from crows.

218
0:09:26.221,000 --> 0:09:27,000
(Laughter)

219
0:09:27.292,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Instead, I think we should look a little bit larger.

220
0:09:30.5,000 --> 0:09:32,000
I think crows can be trained to do other things.

221
0:09:32.79,000 --> 0:09:35,000
For example, why not train them to pick up garbage after stadium events?

222
0:09:36.29,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Or find expensive components from discarded electronics?

223
0:09:39.218,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Or maybe do search and rescue?

224
0:09:41.679,000 --> 0:09:43,000
The main point of all this for me is,

225
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
we can find mutually beneficial systems for these species.

226
0:09:47.083,000 --> 0:09:49,000
We can find ways to interact with these other species

227
0:09:49.611,000 --> 0:09:5,000
that doesn't involve exterminating them,

228
0:09:51.569,000 --> 0:09:54,000
but involves finding an equilibrium with them that's a useful balance.

229
0:09:54.895,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Thanks very much.

230
0:09:56.174,000 --> 0:10:01,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.766,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Have you ever been robbed?

2
0:00:15.577,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Or had something you value forcibly taken from you

3
0:00:20.245,000 --> 0:00:21,000
against your will?

4
0:00:21.963,000 --> 0:00:22,000
It's violating.

5
0:00:24.297,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Feelings of fury, of assault

6
0:00:28.086,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and of helplessness.

7
0:00:30.72,000 --> 0:00:32,000
That's what corruption feels like.

8
0:00:33.66,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Corruption is theft.

9
0:00:36.709,000 --> 0:00:37,000
It is corrosive,

10
0:00:38.607,000 --> 0:00:39,000
it is criminal,

11
0:00:40.685,000 --> 0:00:41,000
it is toxic

12
0:00:42.21,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and it is predatory.

13
0:00:46.025,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Now, I'm from Kenya,

14
0:00:48.656,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and in Kenya, corruption takes different forms.

15
0:00:53.336,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I want to share the story of Karura Forest with you.

16
0:00:57.822,000 --> 0:00:59,000
This is my hometown of Nairobi.

17
0:01:00.977,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I love Nairobi. It's beautiful.

18
0:01:03.66,000 --> 0:01:05,000
But it is a city of paradoxes.

19
0:01:06.792,000 --> 0:01:08,000
It is at once beautiful

20
0:01:09.782,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and challenging.

21
0:01:12.731,000 --> 0:01:15,000
But at the heart of this beautiful city

22
0:01:15.968,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that I call home

23
0:01:17.754,000 --> 0:01:19,000
is Karura Forest,

24
0:01:20.991,000 --> 0:01:26,000
an oasis of green, expansive beauty that would be the envy of any city anywhere.

25
0:01:27.594,000 --> 0:01:31,000
We almost lost Karura Forest to corruption.

26
0:01:33.105,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Word has reached my mother, Wangari Maathai,

27
0:01:35.959,000 --> 0:01:37,000
that Karura Forest is under attack.

28
0:01:40.574,000 --> 0:01:45,000
There was a construction site coming up right in the middle of the forest.

29
0:01:47.05,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Government officials had stolen the forest.

30
0:01:51.416,000 --> 0:01:57,000
They had divided, sold and gifted hundreds of parcels of Karura

31
0:01:58.063,000 --> 0:01:59,000
to their friends and cronies.

32
0:02:00.832,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Now in 1977,

33
0:02:03.335,000 --> 0:02:05,000
my mother founded the Green Belt Movement

34
0:02:06.297,000 --> 0:02:07,000
to plant trees across Kenya,

35
0:02:08.987,000 --> 0:02:09,000
restore green spaces

36
0:02:10.255,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and protect green spaces, much like Karura Forest.

37
0:02:14.508,000 --> 0:02:16,000
She got together her friends and allies,

38
0:02:16.725,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and together, they created what became

39
0:02:19.107,000 --> 0:02:22,000
one of the most successful tree-planting campaigns in the world.

40
0:02:23.961,000 --> 0:02:24,000
It was therefore no surprise

41
0:02:25.588,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that when word got to her that Karura was under attack,

42
0:02:28.974,000 --> 0:02:31,000
they immediately sprang into action.

43
0:02:33.02,000 --> 0:02:36,000
They battled police and hired goons

44
0:02:36.42,000 --> 0:02:39,000
to stop the theft of this forest.

45
0:02:40.29,000 --> 0:02:43,000
But fortunately, there was an uprising of support

46
0:02:44.099,000 --> 0:02:5,000
from the clergy, politicians, students and the general public,

47
0:02:50.456,000 --> 0:02:54,000
all of whom came out to say no to corruption and greed.

48
0:02:55.745,000 --> 0:03:,000
And pretty soon, that support was too strong and intense

49
0:03:01.095,000 --> 0:03:03,000
for the authorities to subdue.

50
0:03:04.101,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And Karura Forest was saved.

51
0:03:08.555,000 --> 0:03:11,000
In the 2000s, I joined my mother in the Green Belt Movement

52
0:03:12.275,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and witnessed the growth of the movement's advocacy activities,

53
0:03:16.71,000 --> 0:03:18,000
its expansion beyond Kenya

54
0:03:19.623,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and an extremely important growing consensus

55
0:03:24.373,000 --> 0:03:27,000
around the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize that she received --

56
0:03:28.211,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that the environment, democracy and peace were inextricably linked.

57
0:03:34.284,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I also learned that what my mother had faced that many years ago

58
0:03:39.34,000 --> 0:03:41,000
trying to protect Karura Forest

59
0:03:41.625,000 --> 0:03:42,000
was not an isolated incident.

60
0:03:44.071,000 --> 0:03:47,000
The corruption and greed that manifested itself then

61
0:03:47.928,000 --> 0:03:48,000
is alive and well today,

62
0:03:50.501,000 --> 0:03:53,000
from greedy politicians and public servants

63
0:03:53.874,000 --> 0:03:55,000
willing to loot public coffers

64
0:03:57.347,000 --> 0:03:58,000
at their expense.

65
0:03:59.151,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Corruption is everywhere.

66
0:04:02.213,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Now, corruption is devastating to any economy, democracy

67
0:04:06.511,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and the environment.

68
0:04:07.964,000 --> 0:04:1,000
It robs citizens of vital social services

69
0:04:11.848,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and renders human life worthless.

70
0:04:16.509,000 --> 0:04:18,000
When young men are willing

71
0:04:19.418,000 --> 0:04:2,000
to join gangs

72
0:04:22.043,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and brutalize their communities

73
0:04:24.706,000 --> 0:04:25,000
for a small fee,

74
0:04:27.382,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and women are raped on the way to work,

75
0:04:29.767,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and, when they report this,

76
0:04:31.787,000 --> 0:04:33,000
the perpetrators bribe their way out of jail,

77
0:04:35.521,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and when young girls have to sell their bodies

78
0:04:39.27,000 --> 0:04:4,000
to buy sanitary towels,

79
0:04:42.766,000 --> 0:04:44,000
you know the society is broken.

80
0:04:46.587,000 --> 0:04:48,000
In recent years, Kenya has been ranked

81
0:04:49.235,000 --> 0:04:53,000
amongst the top 10 most corrupt countries in the world.

82
0:04:56.334,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Even more frustrating for me is that Kenya loses

83
0:04:59.981,000 --> 0:05:02,000
a third of her national budget to corruption each year.

84
0:05:03.987,000 --> 0:05:05,000
That is six billion dollars.

85
0:05:07.844,000 --> 0:05:09,000
It is totally unacceptable.

86
0:05:11.287,000 --> 0:05:16,000
In a country where anti-corruption efforts have been frustrated and ignored

87
0:05:16.74,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and interfered with,

88
0:05:18.227,000 --> 0:05:23,000
we absolutely need new strategies for dealing with this vice.

89
0:05:24.31,000 --> 0:05:25,000
We cannot complain forever.

90
0:05:25.943,000 --> 0:05:27,000
We either decide that we're going to live with it

91
0:05:28.626,000 --> 0:05:29,000
or we are going to change it.

92
0:05:32.082,000 --> 0:05:33,000
There's some good news.

93
0:05:34.828,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Human beings are not born corrupt.

94
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:43,000
At some point, these behaviors are fostered by a culture

95
0:05:43.257,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that promotes individual gain over collective progress.

96
0:05:48.225,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So if we're going to uproot corruption,

97
0:05:50.906,000 --> 0:05:54,000
we have got to start before it ever takes root.

98
0:05:56.574,000 --> 0:05:58,000
We have got to intervene early.

99
0:06:01.715,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I don't know about your country,

100
0:06:03.336,000 --> 0:06:04,000
but where I come from,

101
0:06:04.876,000 --> 0:06:06,000
youth will lead us into the future.

102
0:06:08.688,000 --> 0:06:13,000
In Kenya today, 80 percent of the population is under the age of 35.

103
0:06:16.127,000 --> 0:06:19,000
But by their own admission, they have conflicting values.

104
0:06:20.98,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Fifty-eight percent of young people in Kenya recently told us

105
0:06:24.413,000 --> 0:06:27,000
they will do anything to make money.

106
0:06:29.008,000 --> 0:06:32,000
An additional 45 percent said

107
0:06:33.107,000 --> 0:06:36,000
corruption is a legitimate tool for doing business.

108
0:06:39.365,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Seventy-three percent

109
0:06:41.766,000 --> 0:06:45,000
said they would not be willing to stand up for what they believe in

110
0:06:46.239,000 --> 0:06:48,000
for fear of retribution.

111
0:06:51.293,000 --> 0:06:52,000
What I learned from my mother

112
0:06:54.02,000 --> 0:06:56,000
a few years ago

113
0:06:57.031,000 --> 0:07:,000
was this concept of "the power of one" --

114
0:07:00.543,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that each of us can be potent agents of change

115
0:07:04.247,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and that together, we are a force,

116
0:07:09.017,000 --> 0:07:13,000
that if we put our hands together, we can change the situation

117
0:07:13.784,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and no problem is too big.

118
0:07:17.813,000 --> 0:07:19,000
My mother understood this so profoundly

119
0:07:20.229,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that it was at the center of her work.

120
0:07:22.873,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Shifting cultures takes patience, persistence and commitment,

121
0:07:27.477,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and it is extremely slow and deep work.

122
0:07:32.965,000 --> 0:07:36,000
But if we are going to shift a culture, we have got to get that work started.

123
0:07:37.15,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And in the time since her passing, we have established a foundation in her name

124
0:07:41.6,000 --> 0:07:42,000
to do exactly that

125
0:07:42.896,000 --> 0:07:45,000
but to work with young people and children

126
0:07:46.584,000 --> 0:07:49,000
to begin to build character and personal leadership,

127
0:07:49.81,000 --> 0:07:51,000
to inspire purpose and integrity.

128
0:07:53.577,000 --> 0:07:57,000
But fighting corruption is not as easy as saying corruption is bad.

129
0:07:58.94,000 --> 0:08:,000
Now, here are three strategies that we are employing

130
0:08:01.954,000 --> 0:08:04,000
that we believe can be replicated in any school community.

131
0:08:06.652,000 --> 0:08:1,000
First, we must understand the why:

132
0:08:11.015,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Why does corruption happen in the first place?

133
0:08:15.48,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Do we call it for what it is -- theft --

134
0:08:19.28,000 --> 0:08:21,000
or do we gloss over it with other words?

135
0:08:23.624,000 --> 0:08:27,000
When young children are able to model what it looks and feels like

136
0:08:29.408,000 --> 0:08:3,000
to deal with corruption,

137
0:08:32.754,000 --> 0:08:35,000
they are likely, when faced with a dilemma in their future,

138
0:08:37.09,000 --> 0:08:39,000
to model what they've been taught.

139
0:08:41.693,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Second, we need to teach character explicitly.

140
0:08:47.883,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Now, this may seem obvious,

141
0:08:50.501,000 --> 0:08:53,000
but a child who exhibits a growth mindset

142
0:08:53.871,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and a sense of self-control

143
0:08:56.95,000 --> 0:08:57,000
is self-confident.

144
0:08:59.472,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And a self-confident child is likely to stand up for what they believe.

145
0:09:07.928,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Third, we need to build personal leadership in our children early

146
0:09:16.12,000 --> 0:09:19,000
to give them an opportunity to know what it looks like

147
0:09:19.857,000 --> 0:09:22,000
to call corruption out when they see it,

148
0:09:24.618,000 --> 0:09:29,000
what it feels like to stand up and be counted when they're needed

149
0:09:31.078,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and, for me, to make the more and most important connection

150
0:09:35.101,000 --> 0:09:38,000
between human suffering on one hand

151
0:09:39.226,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and corruption, greed and selfishness on the other.

152
0:09:45.306,000 --> 0:09:48,000
We have got to believe in our capacity

153
0:09:49.791,000 --> 0:09:51,000
to bring about the future we want to see,

154
0:09:53.183,000 --> 0:09:55,000
each of us in our small way.

155
0:09:58.045,000 --> 0:10:,000
Young people must believe

156
0:10:00.259,000 --> 0:10:02,000
that a new reality is possible.

157
0:10:05.118,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Corruption, climate change,

158
0:10:07.909,000 --> 0:10:1,000
ecosystem collapse, biodiversity loss --

159
0:10:10.965,000 --> 0:10:12,000
all these issues need leadership.

160
0:10:16.479,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And in the words of Baba Dioum of Senegal,

161
0:10:20.564,000 --> 0:10:21,000
"In the final analysis,

162
0:10:24.258,000 --> 0:10:26,000
we will conserve

163
0:10:26.697,000 --> 0:10:27,000
only what we love,

164
0:10:29.865,000 --> 0:10:3,000
we will love

165
0:10:32.169,000 --> 0:10:33,000
only what we understand

166
0:10:35.171,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and we will understand

167
0:10:37.475,000 --> 0:10:4,000
only what we are taught."

168
0:10:41.191,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Thank you.

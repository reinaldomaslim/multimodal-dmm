1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Good morning everybody.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I work with really amazing,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
little, itty-bitty creatures called cells.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And let me tell you what it's like

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
to grow these cells in the lab.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I work in a lab where we take cells out of their native environment.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
We plate them into dishes

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
that we sometimes call petri dishes.

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And we feed them -- sterilely of course --

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
with what we call cell culture media -- which is like their food --

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and we grow them in incubators.

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Why do I do this?

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
We observe the cells in a plate,

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and they're just on the surface.

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
But what we're really trying to do in my lab

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
is to engineer tissues out of them.

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
What does that even mean?

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Well it means growing an actual heart,

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
let's say,

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
or grow a piece of bone

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that can be put into the body.

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Not only that, but they can also be used for disease models.

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And for this purpose, traditional cell culture techniques

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
just really aren't enough.

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
The cells are kind of homesick;

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
the dish doesn't feel like their home.

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And so we need to do better at copying their natural environment

28
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
to get them to thrive.

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
We call this the biomimetic paradigm --

30
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
copying nature in the lab.

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Let's take the example of the heart,

32
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
the topic of a lot of my research.

33
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
What makes the heart unique?

34
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Well, the heart beats,

35
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
rhythmically, tirelessly, faithfully.

36
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
We copy this in the lab

37
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
by outfitting cell culture systems with electrodes.

38
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
These electrodes act like mini pacemakers

39
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
to get the cells to contract in the lab.

40
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
What else do we know about the heart?

41
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Well, heart cells are pretty greedy.

42
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Nature feeds the heart cells in your body

43
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
with a very, very dense blood supply.

44
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
In the lab, we micro-pattern channels

45
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
in the biomaterials

46
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
on which we grow the cells,

47
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and this allows us to flow the cell culture media, the cells' food,

48
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
through the scaffolds where we're growing the cells --

49
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
a lot like what you might expect

50
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
from a capillary bed in the heart.

51
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So this brings me to lesson number one:

52
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
life can do a lot with very little.

53
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Let's take the example of electrical stimulation.

54
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Let's see how powerful just one of these essentials can be.

55
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
On the left, we see a tiny piece of beating heart tissue

56
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that I engineered from rat cells in the lab.

57
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
It's about the size of a mini marshmallow.

58
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And after one week, it's beating.

59
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
You can see it in the upper left-hand corner.

60
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
But don't worry if you can't see it so well.

61
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
It's amazing that these cells beat at all.

62
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
But what's really amazing

63
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
is that the cells, when we electrically stimulate them,

64
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
like with a pacemaker,

65
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that they beat so much more.

66
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
But that brings me to lesson number two:

67
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
cells do all the work.

68
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
In a sense, tissue engineers have a bit of an identity crisis here,

69
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
because structural engineers

70
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
build bridges and big things,

71
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
computer engineers, computers,

72
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
but what we are doing

73
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
is actually building enabling technologies for the cells themselves.

74
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
What does this mean for us?

75
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Let's do something really simple.

76
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Let's remind ourselves

77
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that cells are not an abstract concept.

78
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Let's remember that our cells sustain our lives

79
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
in a very real way.

80
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
"We are what we eat," could easily be described

81
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
as, "We are what our cells eat."

82
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And in the case of the flora in our gut,

83
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
these cells may not even be human.

84
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
But it's also worth noting

85
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that cells also mediate our experience of life.

86
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Behind every sound, sight, touch, taste and smell

87
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
is a corresponding set of cells

88
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that receive this information

89
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and interpret it for us.

90
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It begs the question:

91
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
shall we expand our sense of environmental stewardship

92
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
to include the ecosystem of our own bodies?

93
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I invite you to talk about this with me further,

94
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and in the meantime, I wish you luck.

95
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
May none of your non-cancer cells

96
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
become endangered species.

97
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Thank you.

98
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
(Applause)

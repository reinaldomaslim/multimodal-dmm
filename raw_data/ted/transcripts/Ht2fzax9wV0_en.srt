1
0:00:12.336,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Motor racing is a funny old business.

2
0:00:14.593,000 --> 0:00:16,000
We make a new car every year,

3
0:00:16.91,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and then we spend the rest of the season

4
0:00:19.098,000 --> 0:00:21,000
trying to understand what it is we've built

5
0:00:21.874,000 --> 0:00:24,000
to make it better, to make it faster.

6
0:00:25.095,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And then the next year, we start again.

7
0:00:28.37,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Now, the car you see in front of you is quite complicated.

8
0:00:32.608,000 --> 0:00:35,000
The chassis is made up of about 11,000 components,

9
0:00:36.227,000 --> 0:00:38,000
the engine another 6,000,

10
0:00:38.695,000 --> 0:00:41,000
the electronics about eight and a half thousand.

11
0:00:41.788,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So there's about 25,000 things there that can go wrong.

12
0:00:46.189,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So motor racing is very much about attention to detail.

13
0:00:51.015,000 --> 0:00:54,000
The other thing about Formula 1 in particular

14
0:00:54.278,000 --> 0:00:56,000
is we're always changing the car.

15
0:00:56.402,000 --> 0:00:58,000
We're always trying to make it faster.

16
0:00:58.682,000 --> 0:01:,000
So every two weeks, we will be making

17
0:01:01.666,000 --> 0:01:05,000
about 5,000 new components to fit to the car.

18
0:01:05.866,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Five to 10 percent of the race car

19
0:01:08.044,000 --> 0:01:11,000
will be different every two weeks of the year.

20
0:01:11.796,000 --> 0:01:13,000
So how do we do that?

21
0:01:14.105,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Well, we start our life with the racing car.

22
0:01:17.849,000 --> 0:01:2,000
We have a lot of sensors on the car to measure things.

23
0:01:21.84,000 --> 0:01:22,000
On the race car in front of you here

24
0:01:23.722,000 --> 0:01:26,000
there are about 120 sensors when it goes into a race.

25
0:01:26.881,000 --> 0:01:29,000
It's measuring all sorts of things around the car.

26
0:01:30.533,000 --> 0:01:32,000
That data is logged. We're logging about

27
0:01:32.585,000 --> 0:01:35,000
500 different parameters within the data systems,

28
0:01:36.289,000 --> 0:01:39,000
about 13,000 health parameters and events

29
0:01:39.954,000 --> 0:01:43,000
to say when things are not working the way they should do,

30
0:01:44.519,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and we're sending that data back to the garage

31
0:01:47.344,000 --> 0:01:51,000
using telemetry at a rate of two to four megabits per second.

32
0:01:52.323,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So during a two-hour race, each car will be sending

33
0:01:55.45,000 --> 0:01:57,000
750 million numbers.

34
0:01:57.725,000 --> 0:02:,000
That's twice as many numbers as words that each of us

35
0:02:00.868,000 --> 0:02:01,000
speaks in a lifetime.

36
0:02:02.499,000 --> 0:02:04,000
It's a huge amount of data.

37
0:02:05.117,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But it's not enough just to have data and measure it.

38
0:02:07.762,000 --> 0:02:09,000
You need to be able to do something with it.

39
0:02:09.92,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So we've spent a lot of time and effort

40
0:02:12.314,000 --> 0:02:13,000
in turning the data into stories

41
0:02:14.183,000 --> 0:02:17,000
to be able to tell, what's the state of the engine,

42
0:02:17.288,000 --> 0:02:19,000
how are the tires degrading,

43
0:02:19.56,000 --> 0:02:22,000
what's the situation with fuel consumption?

44
0:02:23.308,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So all of this is taking data

45
0:02:26.096,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and turning it into knowledge that we can act upon.

46
0:02:29.898,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Okay, so let's have a look at a little bit of data.

47
0:02:32.536,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Let's pick a bit of data from

48
0:02:34.566,000 --> 0:02:37,000
another three-month-old patient.

49
0:02:37.645,000 --> 0:02:41,000
This is a child, and what you're seeing here is real data,

50
0:02:41.816,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and on the far right-hand side,

51
0:02:43.793,000 --> 0:02:45,000
where everything starts getting a little bit catastrophic,

52
0:02:46.579,000 --> 0:02:49,000
that is the patient going into cardiac arrest.

53
0:02:49.964,000 --> 0:02:52,000
It was deemed to be an unpredictable event.

54
0:02:53.196,000 --> 0:02:56,000
This was a heart attack that no one could see coming.

55
0:02:56.985,000 --> 0:02:58,000
But when we look at the information there,

56
0:02:59.535,000 --> 0:03:01,000
we can see that things are starting to become

57
0:03:01.884,000 --> 0:03:05,000
a little fuzzy about five minutes or so before the cardiac arrest.

58
0:03:05.913,000 --> 0:03:07,000
We can see small changes

59
0:03:07.95,000 --> 0:03:09,000
in things like the heart rate moving.

60
0:03:10.333,000 --> 0:03:12,000
These were all undetected by normal thresholds

61
0:03:12.819,000 --> 0:03:14,000
which would be applied to data.

62
0:03:15.227,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So the question is, why couldn't we see it?

63
0:03:18.37,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Was this a predictable event?

64
0:03:20.951,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Can we look more at the patterns in the data

65
0:03:23.961,000 --> 0:03:26,000
to be able to do things better?

66
0:03:27.341,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So this is a child,

67
0:03:29.991,000 --> 0:03:32,000
about the same age as the racing car on stage,

68
0:03:33.223,000 --> 0:03:34,000
three months old.

69
0:03:34.853,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It's a patient with a heart problem.

70
0:03:37.458,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Now, when you look at some of the data on the screen above,

71
0:03:40.926,000 --> 0:03:44,000
things like heart rate, pulse, oxygen, respiration rates,

72
0:03:45.828,000 --> 0:03:48,000
they're all unusual for a normal child,

73
0:03:48.904,000 --> 0:03:5,000
but they're quite normal for the child there,

74
0:03:51.546,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and so one of the challenges you have in health care is,

75
0:03:55.684,000 --> 0:03:57,000
how can I look at the patient in front of me,

76
0:03:58.535,000 --> 0:04:01,000
have something which is specific for her,

77
0:04:01.582,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and be able to detect when things start to change,

78
0:04:04.37,000 --> 0:04:06,000
when things start to deteriorate?

79
0:04:06.469,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Because like a racing car, any patient,

80
0:04:09.519,000 --> 0:04:11,000
when things start to go bad, you have a short time

81
0:04:12.495,000 --> 0:04:13,000
to make a difference.

82
0:04:14.326,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So what we did is we took a data system

83
0:04:17.08,000 --> 0:04:2,000
which we run every two weeks of the year in Formula 1

84
0:04:20.211,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and we installed it on the hospital computers

85
0:04:23.213,000 --> 0:04:25,000
at Birmingham Children's Hospital.

86
0:04:25.503,000 --> 0:04:27,000
We streamed data from the bedside instruments

87
0:04:27.942,000 --> 0:04:29,000
in their pediatric intensive care

88
0:04:30.499,000 --> 0:04:33,000
so that we could both look at the data in real time

89
0:04:33.954,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and, more importantly, to store the data

90
0:04:36.826,000 --> 0:04:39,000
so that we could start to learn from it.

91
0:04:39.883,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And then, we applied an application on top

92
0:04:44.267,000 --> 0:04:47,000
which would allow us to tease out the patterns in the data

93
0:04:47.537,000 --> 0:04:49,000
in real time so we could see what was happening,

94
0:04:50.493,000 --> 0:04:53,000
so we could determine when things started to change.

95
0:04:54.206,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Now, in motor racing, we're all a little bit ambitious,

96
0:04:58.069,000 --> 0:05:,000
audacious, a little bit arrogant sometimes,

97
0:05:00.618,000 --> 0:05:03,000
so we decided we would also look at the children

98
0:05:04.016,000 --> 0:05:06,000
as they were being transported to intensive care.

99
0:05:06.973,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Why should we wait until they arrived in the hospital

100
0:05:09.521,000 --> 0:05:1,000
before we started to look?

101
0:05:11.121,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And so we installed a real-time link

102
0:05:14.118,000 --> 0:05:16,000
between the ambulance and the hospital,

103
0:05:16.954,000 --> 0:05:19,000
just using normal 3G telephony to send that data

104
0:05:20.73,000 --> 0:05:22,000
so that the ambulance became an extra bed

105
0:05:23.217,000 --> 0:05:26,000
in intensive care.

106
0:05:26.353,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And then we started looking at the data.

107
0:05:30.055,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So the wiggly lines at the top, all the colors,

108
0:05:32.976,000 --> 0:05:35,000
this is the normal sort of data you would see on a monitor --

109
0:05:36.17,000 --> 0:05:39,000
heart rate, pulse, oxygen within the blood,

110
0:05:39.942,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and respiration.

111
0:05:42.577,000 --> 0:05:44,000
The lines on the bottom, the blue and the red,

112
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
these are the interesting ones.

113
0:05:46.831,000 --> 0:05:49,000
The red line is showing an automated version

114
0:05:49.899,000 --> 0:05:5,000
of the early warning score

115
0:05:51.496,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that Birmingham Children's Hospital were already running.

116
0:05:54.235,000 --> 0:05:56,000
They'd been running that since 2008,

117
0:05:56.321,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and already have stopped cardiac arrests

118
0:05:58.577,000 --> 0:06:,000
and distress within the hospital.

119
0:06:01.334,000 --> 0:06:03,000
The blue line is an indication

120
0:06:03.766,000 --> 0:06:05,000
of when patterns start to change,

121
0:06:06.266,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and immediately, before we even started

122
0:06:08.575,000 --> 0:06:09,000
putting in clinical interpretation,

123
0:06:10.283,000 --> 0:06:12,000
we can see that the data is speaking to us.

124
0:06:13.153,000 --> 0:06:16,000
It's telling us that something is going wrong.

125
0:06:16.689,000 --> 0:06:19,000
The plot with the red and the green blobs,

126
0:06:20.505,000 --> 0:06:22,000
this is plotting different components

127
0:06:23.31,000 --> 0:06:25,000
of the data against each other.

128
0:06:25.857,000 --> 0:06:28,000
The green is us learning what is normal for that child.

129
0:06:29.697,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We call it the cloud of normality.

130
0:06:32.307,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And when things start to change,

131
0:06:34.548,000 --> 0:06:36,000
when conditions start to deteriorate,

132
0:06:37.112,000 --> 0:06:39,000
we move into the red line.

133
0:06:39.35,000 --> 0:06:4,000
There's no rocket science here.

134
0:06:41.007,000 --> 0:06:45,000
It is displaying data that exists already in a different way,

135
0:06:45.12,000 --> 0:06:48,000
to amplify it, to provide cues to the doctors,

136
0:06:48.511,000 --> 0:06:5,000
to the nurses, so they can see what's happening.

137
0:06:51.249,000 --> 0:06:54,000
In the same way that a good racing driver

138
0:06:54.379,000 --> 0:06:58,000
relies on cues to decide when to apply the brakes,

139
0:06:58.423,000 --> 0:06:59,000
when to turn into a corner,

140
0:06:59.899,000 --> 0:07:01,000
we need to help our physicians and our nurses

141
0:07:02.817,000 --> 0:07:05,000
to see when things are starting to go wrong.

142
0:07:06.437,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So we have a very ambitious program.

143
0:07:09.383,000 --> 0:07:13,000
We think that the race is on to do something differently.

144
0:07:14.119,000 --> 0:07:16,000
We are thinking big. It's the right thing to do.

145
0:07:17.023,000 --> 0:07:2,000
We have an approach which, if it's successful,

146
0:07:20.435,000 --> 0:07:22,000
there's no reason why it should stay within a hospital.

147
0:07:23.079,000 --> 0:07:24,000
It can go beyond the walls.

148
0:07:24.807,000 --> 0:07:26,000
With wireless connectivity these days,

149
0:07:26.878,000 --> 0:07:29,000
there is no reason why patients, doctors and nurses

150
0:07:30.322,000 --> 0:07:32,000
always have to be in the same place

151
0:07:32.493,000 --> 0:07:33,000
at the same time.

152
0:07:34.486,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And meanwhile, we'll take our little three-month-old baby,

153
0:07:38.481,000 --> 0:07:41,000
keep taking it to the track, keeping it safe,

154
0:07:42.238,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and making it faster and better.

155
0:07:44.571,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Thank you very much.

156
0:07:45.976,000 --> 0:07:49,000
(Applause)

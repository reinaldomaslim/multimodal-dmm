2
0:00:15.682,000 --> 0:00:17,000
You know, my favorite part of being a dad

3
0:00:18.212,000 --> 0:00:21,000
is the movies I get to watch.

4
0:00:21.471,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids,

5
0:00:23.352,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and when my daughter was four,

6
0:00:25.948,000 --> 0:00:27,000
we got to watch "The Wizard of Oz" together.

7
0:00:28.838,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It totally dominated her imagination for months.

8
0:00:32.237,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Her favorite character was Glinda, of course.

9
0:00:35.455,000 --> 0:00:37,000
It gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress

10
0:00:37.515,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and carry a wand.

11
0:00:39.169,000 --> 0:00:41,000
But you watch that movie enough times,

12
0:00:41.578,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and you start to realize how unusual it is.

13
0:00:43.011,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Now we live today, and are raising our children,

14
0:00:45.863,000 --> 0:00:51,000
in a kind of children's-fantasy-spectacular-industrial complex.

15
0:00:52.213,000 --> 0:00:53,000
But "The Wizard of Oz" stood alone.

16
0:00:53.958,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It did not start that trend.

17
0:00:56.145,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Forty years later was when the trend really caught on,

18
0:00:59.567,000 --> 0:01:01,000
with, interestingly, another movie

19
0:01:01.916,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that featured a metal guy

20
0:01:04.051,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and a furry guy

21
0:01:05.435,000 --> 0:01:1,000
rescuing a girl by dressing up as the enemy's guards.

22
0:01:10.646,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Do you know what I'm talking about? (Laughter)

23
0:01:13.087,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Yeah.

24
0:01:14.562,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Now, there's a big difference between these two movies,

25
0:01:18.285,000 --> 0:01:2,000
a couple of really big differences between "The Wizard of Oz"

26
0:01:20.322,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and all the movies we watch today.

27
0:01:21.255,000 --> 0:01:24,000
One is there's very little violence in "The Wizard of Oz."

28
0:01:24.56,000 --> 0:01:29,000
The monkeys are rather aggressive, as are the apple trees.

29
0:01:29.805,000 --> 0:01:32,000
But I think if "The Wizard of Oz" were made today,

30
0:01:33.412,000 --> 0:01:37,000
the wizard would say, "Dorothy, you are the savior of Oz

31
0:01:37.838,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that the prophecy foretold.

32
0:01:39.6,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Use your magic slippers to defeat

33
0:01:41.674,000 --> 0:01:44,000
the computer-generated armies of the Wicked Witch."

34
0:01:45.287,000 --> 0:01:46,000
But that's not how it happens.

35
0:01:46.939,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Another thing that's really unique about "The Wizard of Oz"

36
0:01:49.341,000 --> 0:01:52,000
to me is that all of the most heroic

37
0:01:52.644,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and wise and even villainous characters

38
0:01:55.974,000 --> 0:01:58,000
are female.

39
0:01:59.486,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Now I started to notice this

40
0:02:01.6,000 --> 0:02:04,000
when I actually showed "Star Wars" to my daughter,

41
0:02:04.745,000 --> 0:02:06,000
which was years later, and the situation was different.

42
0:02:07.281,000 --> 0:02:1,000
At that point I also had a son.

43
0:02:10.42,000 --> 0:02:11,000
He was only three at the time.

44
0:02:12.147,000 --> 0:02:16,000
He was not invited to the screening. He was too young for that.

45
0:02:16.293,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But he was the second child,

46
0:02:17.614,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and the level of supervision had plummeted. (Laughter)

47
0:02:21.387,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So he wandered in,

48
0:02:25.001,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and it imprinted on him

49
0:02:29.03,000 --> 0:02:34,000
like a mommy duck does to its duckling,

50
0:02:34.672,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and I don't think he understands what's going on,

51
0:02:38.451,000 --> 0:02:41,000
but he is sure soaking in it.

52
0:02:41.978,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And I wonder what he's soaking in.

53
0:02:43.347,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Is he picking up on the themes of courage

54
0:02:45.825,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and perseverance and loyalty?

55
0:02:47.942,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Is he picking up on the fact that Luke

56
0:02:50.922,000 --> 0:02:54,000
joins an army to overthrow the government?

57
0:02:55.816,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Is he picking up on the fact that

58
0:02:57.472,000 --> 0:03:,000
there are only boys in the universe

59
0:03:00.575,000 --> 0:03:03,000
except for Aunt Beru, and of course this princess,

60
0:03:03.764,000 --> 0:03:07,000
who's really cool, but who kind of waits around through most of the movie

61
0:03:08.214,000 --> 0:03:11,000
so that she can award the hero with a medal and a wink

62
0:03:11.443,000 --> 0:03:13,000
to thank him for saving the universe, which he does

63
0:03:13.996,000 --> 0:03:16,000
by the magic that he was born with?

64
0:03:17.222,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Compare this to 1939 with "The Wizard of Oz."

65
0:03:20.188,000 --> 0:03:22,000
How does Dorothy win her movie?

66
0:03:22.817,000 --> 0:03:24,000
By making friends with everybody

67
0:03:25.767,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and being a leader.

68
0:03:27.544,000 --> 0:03:3,000
That's kind of the world I'd rather raise my kids in --

69
0:03:30.85,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Oz, right? -- and not the world of dudes fighting,

70
0:03:34.74,000 --> 0:03:35,000
which is where we kind of have to be.

71
0:03:36.643,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Why is there so much Force -- capital F, Force --

72
0:03:40.423,000 --> 0:03:41,000
in the movies we have for our kids,

73
0:03:42.11,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and so little yellow brick road?

74
0:03:44.555,000 --> 0:03:47,000
There is a lot of great writing about the impact

75
0:03:47.972,000 --> 0:03:51,000
that the boy-violent movie has on girls,

76
0:03:52.219,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and you should do that reading. It's very good.

77
0:03:54.837,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I haven't read as much on how boys are picking up on this vibe.

78
0:03:59.711,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I know from my own experience that

79
0:04:02.261,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Princess Leia did not provide the adequate context

80
0:04:07.886,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that I could have used in navigating the adult world

81
0:04:12.015,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that is co-ed. (Laughter)

82
0:04:16.616,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I think there was a first-kiss moment

83
0:04:19.806,000 --> 0:04:22,000
when I really expected the credits to start rolling

84
0:04:23.137,000 --> 0:04:25,000
because that's the end of the movie, right?

85
0:04:25.94,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I finished my quest, I got the girl.

86
0:04:28.237,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Why are you still standing there?

87
0:04:31.368,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

88
0:04:32.813,000 --> 0:04:35,000
The movies are very, very focused on defeating the villain

89
0:04:36.001,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and getting your reward, and there's not a lot of room

90
0:04:38.589,000 --> 0:04:4,000
for other relationships and other journeys.

91
0:04:41.48,000 --> 0:04:43,000
It's almost as though if you're a boy,

92
0:04:43.719,000 --> 0:04:45,000
you are a dopey animal,

93
0:04:45.8,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and if you are a girl, you should bring your warrior costume.

94
0:04:50.274,000 --> 0:04:52,000
There are plenty of exceptions,

95
0:04:52.462,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and I will defend the Disney princesses in front of any you.

96
0:04:57.759,000 --> 0:05:,000
But they do send a message to boys,

97
0:05:00.811,000 --> 0:05:02,000
that they are not, the boys are not really the target audience.

98
0:05:03.317,000 --> 0:05:05,000
They are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls

99
0:05:05.759,000 --> 0:05:08,000
how to defend against the patriarchy,

100
0:05:09.131,000 --> 0:05:1,000
but they are not necessarily showing boys

101
0:05:11.096,000 --> 0:05:13,000
how they're supposed to defend against the patriarchy.

102
0:05:13.93,000 --> 0:05:15,000
There's no models for them.

103
0:05:16.07,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And we also have some terrific women

104
0:05:19.343,000 --> 0:05:21,000
who are writing new stories for our kids,

105
0:05:21.48,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and as three-dimensional and delightful as Hermione and Katniss are,

106
0:05:26.222,000 --> 0:05:28,000
these are still war movies.

107
0:05:28.348,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And, of course, the most successful studio of all time

108
0:05:32.456,000 --> 0:05:36,000
continues to crank out classic after classic,

109
0:05:36.586,000 --> 0:05:38,000
every single one of them about

110
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
the journey of a boy, or a man,

111
0:05:43.1,000 --> 0:05:46,000
or two men who are friends, or a man and his son,

112
0:05:46.744,000 --> 0:05:49,000
or two men who are raising a little girl.

113
0:05:50.339,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Until, as many of you are thinking, this year,

114
0:05:54.079,000 --> 0:05:55,000
when they finally came out with "Brave."

115
0:05:55.805,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I recommend it to all of you. It's on demand now.

116
0:05:59.812,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Do you remember what the critics said when "Brave" came out?

117
0:06:03.706,000 --> 0:06:07,000
"Aw, I can't believe Pixar made a princess movie."

118
0:06:08.114,000 --> 0:06:1,000
It's very good. Don't let that stop you.

119
0:06:10.235,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Now, almost none of these movies pass the Bechdel Test.

120
0:06:14.127,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I don't know if you've heard of this.

121
0:06:15.313,000 --> 0:06:17,000
It has not yet caught on and caught fire,

122
0:06:18.135,000 --> 0:06:2,000
but maybe today we will start a movement.

123
0:06:20.216,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Alison Bechdel is a comic book artist,

124
0:06:22.998,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and back in the mid-'80s, she recorded this conversation

125
0:06:28.104,000 --> 0:06:31,000
she'd had with a friend about assessing the movies that they saw.

126
0:06:31.678,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And it's very simple. There's just three questions you should ask:

127
0:06:34.664,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Is there more than one character in the movie

128
0:06:37.174,000 --> 0:06:4,000
that is female who has lines?

129
0:06:40.775,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So try to meet that bar.

130
0:06:43.355,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie?

131
0:06:49.015,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And is their conversation about something other than

132
0:06:52.468,000 --> 0:06:55,000
the guy that they both like? (Laughter)

133
0:06:55.784,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Right? Thank you. (Applause)

134
0:07:00.116,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Thank you very much.

135
0:07:01.941,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Two women who exist and talk to each other about stuff.

136
0:07:09.544,000 --> 0:07:14,000
It does happen. I've seen it,

137
0:07:14.674,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and yet I very rarely see it in the movies

138
0:07:17.622,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that we know and love.

139
0:07:18.789,000 --> 0:07:2,000
In fact, this week I went to see

140
0:07:20.949,000 --> 0:07:23,000
a very high-quality movie, "Argo."

141
0:07:24.563,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Right? Oscar buzz, doing great at the box office,

142
0:07:28.222,000 --> 0:07:32,000
a consensus idea of what a quality Hollywood film is.

143
0:07:32.506,000 --> 0:07:34,000
It pretty much flunks the Bechdel test.

144
0:07:35.19,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And I don't think it should, because a lot of the movie,

145
0:07:38.997,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I don't know if you've seen it, but a lot of the movie

146
0:07:40.578,000 --> 0:07:43,000
takes place in this embassy where men and women

147
0:07:44.036,000 --> 0:07:46,000
are hiding out during the hostage crisis.

148
0:07:46.713,000 --> 0:07:47,000
We've got quite a few scenes of the men

149
0:07:48.602,000 --> 0:07:52,000
having deep, angst-ridden conversations in this hideout,

150
0:07:52.763,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and the great moment for one of the actresses is

151
0:07:56.779,000 --> 0:08:01,000
to peek through the door and say, "Are you coming to bed, honey?"

152
0:08:01.901,000 --> 0:08:03,000
That's Hollywood for you.

153
0:08:03.902,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So let's look at the numbers.

154
0:08:06.347,000 --> 0:08:09,000
2011, of the 100 most popular movies,

155
0:08:09.909,000 --> 0:08:13,000
how many of them do you think actually have female protagonists?

156
0:08:14.154,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Eleven. It's not bad.

157
0:08:17.448,000 --> 0:08:2,000
It's not as many percent as the number of women

158
0:08:21.143,000 --> 0:08:24,000
we've just elected to Congress, so that's good.

159
0:08:24.269,000 --> 0:08:27,000
But there is a number that is greater than this

160
0:08:27.273,000 --> 0:08:29,000
that's going to bring this room down.

161
0:08:29.93,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Last year, The New York Times published a study

162
0:08:33.592,000 --> 0:08:34,000
that the government had done.

163
0:08:35.251,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Here's what it said.

164
0:08:36.639,000 --> 0:08:4,000
One out of five women in America

165
0:08:40.855,000 --> 0:08:46,000
say that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life.

166
0:08:47.108,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Now, I don't think that's the fault of popular entertainment.

167
0:08:50.892,000 --> 0:08:54,000
I don't think kids' movies have anything to do with that.

168
0:08:55.175,000 --> 0:08:56,000
I don't even think that

169
0:08:56.953,000 --> 0:08:59,000
music videos or pornography are really directly related to that,

170
0:09:00.508,000 --> 0:09:02,000
but something is going wrong,

171
0:09:03.273,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and when I hear that statistic,

172
0:09:06.324,000 --> 0:09:08,000
one of the things I think of is

173
0:09:08.829,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that's a lot of sexual assailants.

174
0:09:12.954,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Who are these guys? What are they learning?

175
0:09:16.314,000 --> 0:09:17,000
What are they failing to learn?

176
0:09:18.03,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Are they absorbing the story that

177
0:09:20.18,000 --> 0:09:24,000
a male hero's job is to defeat the villain with violence

178
0:09:24.707,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and then collect the reward, which is a woman

179
0:09:27.24,000 --> 0:09:32,000
who has no friends and doesn't speak?

180
0:09:32.288,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Are we soaking up that story?

181
0:09:37.493,000 --> 0:09:39,000
You know,

182
0:09:39.839,000 --> 0:09:41,000
as a parent with the privilege

183
0:09:42.606,000 --> 0:09:44,000
of raising a daughter

184
0:09:45.25,000 --> 0:09:47,000
like all of you who are doing the same thing,

185
0:09:48.119,000 --> 0:09:51,000
we find this world and this statistic very alarming

186
0:09:51.899,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and we want to prepare them.

187
0:09:53.036,000 --> 0:09:57,000
We have tools at our disposal like "girl power,"

188
0:09:57.322,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and we hope that that will help,

189
0:10:00.056,000 --> 0:10:03,000
but I gotta wonder, is girl power going to protect them

190
0:10:03.665,000 --> 0:10:05,000
if, at the same time, actively or passively,

191
0:10:06.263,000 --> 0:10:1,000
we are training our sons to maintain their boy power?

192
0:10:11.216,000 --> 0:10:14,000
I mean, I think the Netflix queue

193
0:10:14.614,000 --> 0:10:17,000
is one way that we can do something very important,

194
0:10:17.87,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and I'm talking mainly to the dads here.

195
0:10:20.925,000 --> 0:10:22,000
I think we have got to show our sons

196
0:10:23.775,000 --> 0:10:24,000
a new definition of manhood.

197
0:10:25.631,000 --> 0:10:29,000
The definition of manhood is already turning upside down.

198
0:10:30.151,000 --> 0:10:32,000
You've read about how the new economy

199
0:10:32.282,000 --> 0:10:35,000
is changing the roles of caregiver and wage earner.

200
0:10:35.683,000 --> 0:10:36,000
They're throwing it up in the air.

201
0:10:37.337,000 --> 0:10:39,000
So our sons are going to have to find some way

202
0:10:39.955,000 --> 0:10:41,000
of adapting to this, some new relationship with each other,

203
0:10:42.93,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and I think we really have to show them, and model for them,

204
0:10:46.777,000 --> 0:10:49,000
how a real man

205
0:10:50.478,000 --> 0:10:53,000
is someone who trusts his sisters

206
0:10:54.247,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and respects them, and wants to be on their team,

207
0:10:57.42,000 --> 0:11:,000
and stands up against the real bad guys,

208
0:11:01.043,000 --> 0:11:04,000
who are the men who want to abuse the women.

209
0:11:04.899,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And I think our job in the Netflix queue

210
0:11:07.95,000 --> 0:11:1,000
is to look out for those movies that pass the Bechdel Test,

211
0:11:11.719,000 --> 0:11:15,000
if we can find them, and to seek out the heroines

212
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
who are there,

213
0:11:17.586,000 --> 0:11:2,000
who show real courage, who bring people together,

214
0:11:21.375,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and to nudge our sons to identify with those heroines

215
0:11:24.963,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and to say, "I want to be on their team,"

216
0:11:28.448,000 --> 0:11:32,000
because they're going to be on their team.

217
0:11:33.03,000 --> 0:11:36,000
When I asked my daughter who her favorite character was in "Star Wars,"

218
0:11:36.724,000 --> 0:11:38,000
do you know what she said?

219
0:11:38.753,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Obi-Wan.

220
0:11:41.256,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Obi-Wan Kenobi and Glinda.

221
0:11:45.153,000 --> 0:11:48,000
What do these two have in common?

222
0:11:48.62,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Maybe it's not just the sparkly dress.

223
0:11:50.544,000 --> 0:11:53,000
I think these people are experts.

224
0:11:54.171,000 --> 0:11:55,000
I think these are the two people in the movie

225
0:11:55.697,000 --> 0:11:56,000
who know more than anybody else,

226
0:11:57.265,000 --> 0:12:,000
and they love sharing their knowledge with other people

227
0:12:00.592,000 --> 0:12:03,000
to help them reach their potential.

228
0:12:03.696,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Now, they are leaders.

229
0:12:05.704,000 --> 0:12:07,000
I like that kind of quest for my daughter,

230
0:12:07.922,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and I like that kind of quest for my son.

231
0:12:10.109,000 --> 0:12:11,000
I want more quests like that.

232
0:12:12.02,000 --> 0:12:14,000
I want fewer quests where my son is told,

233
0:12:14.62,000 --> 0:12:16,000
"Go out and fight it alone,"

234
0:12:16.831,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and more quests where he sees that it's his job to join a team,

235
0:12:22.036,000 --> 0:12:26,000
maybe a team led by women,

236
0:12:26.136,000 --> 0:12:31,000
to help other people become better

237
0:12:31.756,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and be better people,

238
0:12:34.148,000 --> 0:12:36,000
like the Wizard of Oz.

239
0:12:36.43,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Thank you.

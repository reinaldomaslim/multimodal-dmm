1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
It's pretty simple. There are nine, sort of, rules

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
that I discovered after 35 years of rock climbing.

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Most of them are pretty basic.

4
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Number one: don't let go --

5
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
very sure success method.

6
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
But really, truly -- often you think about

7
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
letting go way before your body does.

8
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So hang in there,

9
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and you come up with some pretty peculiar solutions.

10
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Number two: hesitation is bad.

11
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
This is a friction climb, up in Tuolumne Meadows,

12
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
in the Yosemite high country.

13
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Friction climbing doesn't have any sort of hard positive edges.

14
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
You're climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock.

15
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
The most friction you have is when you first put your hand

16
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
or your foot on the rock.

17
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And then from that point on, you're basically falling.

18
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So momentum is good. Don't stop.

19
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Rule number three: have a plan.

20
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
This is a climb called the Naked Edge,

21
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
in El Dorado Canyon, outside of Boulder.

22
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
This climber is on the last pitch of it.

23
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
He's actually right about where I fell.

24
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
There is about 1,000 feet of air below him.

25
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And all the hard pitches are actually below him.

26
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Often what happens is

27
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
you're planning so hard for like,

28
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
"How do I get through the hardest part? How do I get through the hardest part?"

29
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And then what happens?

30
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
You get to the last pitch. It's easy.

31
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And you're completely flamed out. Don't do it.

32
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
You have to plan ahead to get to the top.

33
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But you also can't forget that each individual move

34
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
you have to be able to complete.

35
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
This is a climb called the Dike Route,

36
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
on Pywjack Dome, up in the Yosemite high country.

37
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
The interesting thing about this climb is it's not that hard.

38
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
But if you're the leader on it,

39
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
at the hardest move, you're looking at about 100 foot fall,

40
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
onto some low angle slabs.

41
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So you've got to focus.

42
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
You don't want to stop in the middle like

43
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Coleridge's Kubla Kahn.

44
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
You've got to keep going.

45
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Rule number five: know how to rest.

46
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It's amazing. The best climbers

47
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
are the ones that in the most extreme situations

48
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
can get their bodies into some position

49
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
where they can rest,

50
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
regroup, calm themselves, focus,

51
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and keep going.

52
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
This is a climb in the Needles, again in California.

53
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Fear really sucks because what it means is

54
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
you're not focusing on what you're doing.

55
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
You're focusing on the consequences of

56
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
failing at what you're doing

57
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
because any given move should require

58
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
all your concentration and thought processes

59
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
to execute it effectively.

60
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
One of the things in climbing is, most people

61
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
sort of take it straight on. And they follow the most obvious solution.

62
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
This is the Devils Tower in Wyoming,

63
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
which is a columnar basalt formation

64
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
that most of you probably know from "Close Encounters."

65
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
With this, typically crack climbers

66
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
would put their hands in and their toes in

67
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and just start climbing.

68
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
The cracks are too small to get your toes into

69
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
so the only way to climb is using your fingertips

70
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
in the cracks,

71
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and using opposing pressure

72
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and forcing yourself up.

73
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Rule number eight: strength doesn't always equal success.

74
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
In the 35 years I've been a climbing guide

75
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and taught on indoor walls, and stuff like that,

76
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
the most important thing I've learned

77
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
was, guys will always try to do pull-ups.

78
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Beginning guys, it's like, they thrash, they thrash,

79
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
they get 15 feet up --

80
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and they can do about 15 pull-ups right --

81
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And then they just flame out.

82
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Women are much more in balance

83
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
because they don't have that idea

84
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that they're going to be able to do 100 pull-ups.

85
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
They think about how to get the weight over their feet

86
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
because it's sort of natural -- they carry you all day long.

87
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So balance is really critical,

88
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and keeping your weight on your feet,

89
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
which is your strongest muscle.

90
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And of course there is rule number nine.

91
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I came up with rule number nine after

92
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I actually didn't plan for a fall,

93
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and went about 40 feet and cracked a rib.

94
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Once you get to that point where you know it's going to happen,

95
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
you need to start thinking about how you're going to let go

96
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
because that is the critical piece

97
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
of not getting hurt --

98
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
how you're going to fall onto the rope,

99
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
or if you're climbing without a rope,

100
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
fall to a place where you can actually control the fall.

101
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So don't hang on till the bitter end.

102
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Thank you very much.

103
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:21.406,000 --> 0:00:22,000
There's so many of you.

3
0:00:23.105,000 --> 0:00:24,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:27.945,000 --> 0:00:29,000
When I was a kid,

5
0:00:30.556,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I hid my heart under the bed, because my mother said,

6
0:00:33.064,000 --> 0:00:35,000
"If you're not careful, someday someone's going to break it."

7
0:00:36.698,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Take it from me: Under the bed is not a good hiding spot.

8
0:00:40.317,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I know because I've been shot down so many times,

9
0:00:42.717,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I get altitude sickness just from standing up for myself.

10
0:00:46.61,000 --> 0:00:47,000
But that's what we were told.

11
0:00:48.61,000 --> 0:00:49,000
"Stand up for yourself."

12
0:00:50.908,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And that's hard to do if you don't know who you are.

13
0:00:53.896,000 --> 0:00:56,000
We were expected to define ourselves at such an early age,

14
0:00:57.66,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and if we didn't do it, others did it for us.

15
0:01:00.978,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Geek. Fatty.

16
0:01:02.487,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Slut. Fag.

17
0:01:05.42,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And at the same time we were being told what we were,

18
0:01:08.911,000 --> 0:01:09,000
we were being asked,

19
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

20
0:01:13.213,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I always thought that was an unfair question.

21
0:01:15.339,000 --> 0:01:17,000
It presupposes that we can't be what we already are.

22
0:01:18.689,000 --> 0:01:19,000
We were kids.

23
0:01:20.545,000 --> 0:01:22,000
When I was a kid, I wanted to be a man.

24
0:01:23.615,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I wanted a registered retirement savings plan

25
0:01:25.818,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that would keep me in candy long enough to make old age sweet.

26
0:01:28.961,000 --> 0:01:29,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:30.166,000 --> 0:01:32,000
When I was a kid, I wanted to shave.

28
0:01:32.626,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Now, not so much.

29
0:01:34.468,000 --> 0:01:35,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:36.356,000 --> 0:01:39,000
When I was eight, I wanted to be a marine biologist.

31
0:01:39.771,000 --> 0:01:4,000
When I was nine, I saw the movie "Jaws,"

32
0:01:41.7,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and thought to myself, "No, thank you."

33
0:01:43.637,000 --> 0:01:44,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:45.153,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And when I was 10,

35
0:01:46.328,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I was told that my parents left because they didn't want me.

36
0:01:49.185,000 --> 0:01:5,000
When I was 11, I wanted to be left alone.

37
0:01:51.17,000 --> 0:01:54,000
When I was 12, I wanted to die. When I was 13, I wanted to kill a kid.

38
0:01:54.543,000 --> 0:01:57,000
When I was 14, I was asked to seriously consider a career path.

39
0:01:58.599,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I said, "I'd like to be a writer."

40
0:02:01.043,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And they said, "Choose something realistic."

41
0:02:03.915,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So I said, "Professional wrestler."

42
0:02:07.371,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And they said, "Don't be stupid."

43
0:02:09.699,000 --> 0:02:11,000
See, they asked me what I wanted to be,

44
0:02:12.459,000 --> 0:02:13,000
then told me what not to be.

45
0:02:14.823,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And I wasn't the only one.

46
0:02:17.062,000 --> 0:02:19,000
We were being told that we somehow must become

47
0:02:19.321,000 --> 0:02:2,000
what we are not, sacrificing what we are

48
0:02:21.308,000 --> 0:02:23,000
to inherit the masquerade of what we will be.

49
0:02:24.212,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I was being told to accept the identity that others will give me.

50
0:02:28.848,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And I wondered, what made my dreams so easy to dismiss?

51
0:02:32.921,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Granted, my dreams are shy,

52
0:02:36.288,000 --> 0:02:37,000
because they're Canadian.

53
0:02:38.005,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:41.138,000 --> 0:02:44,000
My dreams are self-conscious and overly apologetic.

55
0:02:44.518,000 --> 0:02:46,000
They're standing alone at the high school dance,

56
0:02:46.828,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and they've never been kissed.

57
0:02:49.391,000 --> 0:02:51,000
See, my dreams got called names too.

58
0:02:52.221,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Silly. Foolish.

59
0:02:54.879,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Impossible.

60
0:02:56.054,000 --> 0:02:57,000
But I kept dreaming.

61
0:02:57.802,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I was going to be a wrestler. I had it all figured out.

62
0:03:00.424,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I was going to be The Garbage Man.

63
0:03:02.068,000 --> 0:03:03,000
(Laughter)

64
0:03:03.093,000 --> 0:03:06,000
My finishing move was going to be The Trash Compactor.

65
0:03:06.546,000 --> 0:03:09,000
My saying was going to be, "I'm taking out the trash!"

66
0:03:09.688,000 --> 0:03:11,000
(Laughter)

67
0:03:12.548,000 --> 0:03:15,000
(Applause)

68
0:03:16.324,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And then this guy, Duke "The Dumpster" Droese,

69
0:03:21.096,000 --> 0:03:22,000
stole my entire shtick.

70
0:03:22.84,000 --> 0:03:23,000
(Laughter)

71
0:03:24.431,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I was crushed,

72
0:03:26.557,000 --> 0:03:27,000
as if by a trash compactor.

73
0:03:28.406,000 --> 0:03:3,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:30.928,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I thought to myself, "What now? Where do I turn?"

75
0:03:34.499,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Poetry.

76
0:03:35.936,000 --> 0:03:36,000
(Laughter)

77
0:03:37.338,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Like a boomerang, the thing I loved came back to me.

78
0:03:40.846,000 --> 0:03:42,000
One of the first lines of poetry I can remember writing

79
0:03:43.523,000 --> 0:03:45,000
was in response to a world that demanded I hate myself.

80
0:03:46.167,000 --> 0:03:48,000
From age 15 to 18, I hated myself

81
0:03:48.587,000 --> 0:03:5,000
for becoming the thing that I loathed:

82
0:03:51.411,000 --> 0:03:52,000
a bully.

83
0:03:52.988,000 --> 0:03:54,000
When I was 19, I wrote,

84
0:03:55.776,000 --> 0:03:57,000
"I will love myself despite the ease with which

85
0:03:58.325,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I lean toward the opposite."

86
0:04:01.443,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Standing up for yourself doesn't have to mean

87
0:04:04.673,000 --> 0:04:05,000
embracing violence.

88
0:04:07.122,000 --> 0:04:08,000
When I was a kid,

89
0:04:08.999,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I traded in homework assignments for friendship,

90
0:04:11.73,000 --> 0:04:13,000
then gave each friend a late slip for never showing up on time,

91
0:04:14.753,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and in most cases, not at all.

92
0:04:16.403,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I gave myself a hall pass to get through each broken promise.

93
0:04:19.537,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And I remember this plan, born out of frustration

94
0:04:21.888,000 --> 0:04:23,000
from a kid who kept calling me "Yogi,"

95
0:04:24.107,000 --> 0:04:27,000
then pointed at my tummy and said, "Too many picnic baskets."

96
0:04:27.848,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Turns out it's not that hard to trick someone,

97
0:04:30.294,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and one day before class, I said,

98
0:04:31.89,000 --> 0:04:33,000
"Yeah, you can copy my homework,"

99
0:04:33.959,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and I gave him all the wrong answers that I'd written down the night before.

100
0:04:37.934,000 --> 0:04:39,000
He got his paper back expecting a near-perfect score,

101
0:04:40.464,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and couldn't believe it when he looked across the room at me and held up a zero.

102
0:04:44.299,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I knew I didn't have to hold up my paper of 28 out of 30,

103
0:04:47.369,000 --> 0:04:5,000
but my satisfaction was complete when he looked at me, puzzled,

104
0:04:50.401,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and I thought to myself, "Smarter than the average bear, motherfucker."

105
0:04:53.883,000 --> 0:04:54,000
(Laughter)

106
0:04:55.689,000 --> 0:05:01,000
(Applause)

107
0:05:01.943,000 --> 0:05:02,000
This is who I am.

108
0:05:04.845,000 --> 0:05:06,000
This is how I stand up for myself.

109
0:05:08.543,000 --> 0:05:1,000
When I was a kid,

110
0:05:10.817,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I used to think that pork chops and karate chops were the same thing.

111
0:05:15.706,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I thought they were both pork chops.

112
0:05:17.875,000 --> 0:05:18,000
My grandmother thought it was cute,

113
0:05:19.653,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and because they were my favorite, she let me keep doing it.

114
0:05:22.487,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Not really a big deal.

115
0:05:23.964,000 --> 0:05:26,000
One day, before I realized fat kids are not designed to climb trees,

116
0:05:27.747,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I fell out of a tree and bruised the right side of my body.

117
0:05:31.254,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I didn't want to tell my grandmother

118
0:05:33.001,000 --> 0:05:34,000
because I was scared I'd get in trouble

119
0:05:34.895,000 --> 0:05:36,000
for playing somewhere I shouldn't have been.

120
0:05:37.026,000 --> 0:05:4,000
The gym teacher noticed the bruise, and I got sent to the principal's office.

121
0:05:40.68,000 --> 0:05:43,000
From there, I was sent to another small room with a really nice lady

122
0:05:43.983,000 --> 0:05:45,000
who asked me all kinds of questions about my life at home.

123
0:05:48.094,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I saw no reason to lie.

124
0:05:49.991,000 --> 0:05:51,000
As far as I was concerned, life was pretty good.

125
0:05:52.752,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I told her, whenever I'm sad, my grandmother gives me karate chops.

126
0:05:56.218,000 --> 0:06:02,000
(Laughter)

127
0:06:04.162,000 --> 0:06:07,000
This led to a full-scale investigation,

128
0:06:07.997,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and I was removed from the house for three days,

129
0:06:10.923,000 --> 0:06:12,000
until they finally decided to ask how I got the bruises.

130
0:06:14.461,000 --> 0:06:17,000
News of this silly little story quickly spread through the school,

131
0:06:17.629,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and I earned my first nickname:

132
0:06:20.101,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Porkchop.

133
0:06:22.156,000 --> 0:06:24,000
To this day,

134
0:06:24.539,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I hate pork chops.

135
0:06:28.416,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I'm not the only kid who grew up this way,

136
0:06:31.464,000 --> 0:06:33,000
surrounded by people who used to say that rhyme

137
0:06:34.186,000 --> 0:06:36,000
about sticks and stones,

138
0:06:36.622,000 --> 0:06:38,000
as if broken bones hurt more than the names we got called,

139
0:06:39.39,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and we got called them all.

140
0:06:41.326,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So we grew up believing no one would ever fall in love with us,

141
0:06:44.91,000 --> 0:06:46,000
that we'd be lonely forever,

142
0:06:47.239,000 --> 0:06:49,000
that we'd never meet someone to make us feel like the sun

143
0:06:49.975,000 --> 0:06:51,000
was something they built for us in their toolshed.

144
0:06:52.357,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So broken heartstrings bled the blues,

145
0:06:54.206,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and we tried to empty ourselves so we'd feel nothing.

146
0:06:56.74,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Don't tell me that hurts less than a broken bone,

147
0:06:59.119,000 --> 0:07:01,000
that an ingrown life is something surgeons can cut away,

148
0:07:01.776,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that there's no way for it to metastasize; it does.

149
0:07:04.423,000 --> 0:07:05,000
She was eight years old,

150
0:07:06.149,000 --> 0:07:08,000
our first day of grade three when she got called ugly.

151
0:07:09.419,000 --> 0:07:1,000
We both got moved to the back of class

152
0:07:11.373,000 --> 0:07:13,000
so we would stop getting bombarded by spitballs.

153
0:07:14.355,000 --> 0:07:15,000
But the school halls were a battleground.

154
0:07:16.35,000 --> 0:07:18,000
We found ourselves outnumbered day after wretched day.

155
0:07:18.903,000 --> 0:07:21,000
We used to stay inside for recess, because outside was worse.

156
0:07:22.249,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Outside, we'd have to rehearse running away,

157
0:07:24.372,000 --> 0:07:27,000
or learn to stay still like statues, giving no clues that we were there.

158
0:07:27.789,000 --> 0:07:29,000
In grade five, they taped a sign to the front of her desk

159
0:07:30.6,000 --> 0:07:31,000
that read, "Beware of dog."

160
0:07:33.23,000 --> 0:07:34,000
To this day,

161
0:07:34.873,000 --> 0:07:37,000
despite a loving husband, she doesn't think she's beautiful,

162
0:07:38.47,000 --> 0:07:41,000
because of a birthmark that takes up a little less than half her face.

163
0:07:41.878,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Kids used to say, "She looks like a wrong answer

164
0:07:44.141,000 --> 0:07:47,000
that someone tried to erase, but couldn't quite get the job done."

165
0:07:47.325,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And they'll never understand that she's raising two kids

166
0:07:50.286,000 --> 0:07:54,000
whose definition of beauty begins with the word "Mom,"

167
0:07:54.421,000 --> 0:07:56,000
because they see her heart before they see her skin,

168
0:07:56.899,000 --> 0:07:58,000
because she's only ever always been amazing.

169
0:07:59.938,000 --> 0:08:03,000
He was a broken branch grafted onto a different family tree,

170
0:08:03.962,000 --> 0:08:04,000
adopted,

171
0:08:05.875,000 --> 0:08:07,000
not because his parents opted for a different destiny.

172
0:08:09.725,000 --> 0:08:1,000
He was three when he became a mixed drink

173
0:08:11.702,000 --> 0:08:14,000
of one part left alone and two parts tragedy,

174
0:08:15.019,000 --> 0:08:17,000
started therapy in eighth grade,

175
0:08:17.201,000 --> 0:08:19,000
had a personality made up of tests and pills,

176
0:08:20.029,000 --> 0:08:23,000
lived like the uphills were mountains and the downhills were cliffs,

177
0:08:23.821,000 --> 0:08:26,000
four-fifths suicidal, a tidal wave of antidepressants,

178
0:08:27.229,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and an adolescent being called "Popper,"

179
0:08:30.139,000 --> 0:08:32,000
one part because of the pills,

180
0:08:32.235,000 --> 0:08:34,000
99 parts because of the cruelty.

181
0:08:34.973,000 --> 0:08:36,000
He tried to kill himself in grade 10

182
0:08:37.537,000 --> 0:08:39,000
when a kid who could still go home to Mom and Dad

183
0:08:40.18,000 --> 0:08:42,000
had the audacity to tell him, "Get over it."

184
0:08:43.583,000 --> 0:08:45,000
As if depression is something that could be remedied

185
0:08:46.052,000 --> 0:08:48,000
by any of the contents found in a first-aid kit.

186
0:08:48.718,000 --> 0:08:51,000
To this day, he is a stick of TNT lit from both ends,

187
0:08:52.318,000 --> 0:08:54,000
could describe to you in detail the way the sky bends

188
0:08:54.845,000 --> 0:08:55,000
in the moment before it's about to fall,

189
0:08:56.798,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and despite an army of friends who all call him an inspiration,

190
0:08:59.79,000 --> 0:09:02,000
he remains a conversation piece between people who can't understand

191
0:09:03.111,000 --> 0:09:06,000
sometimes being drug-free has less to do with addiction

192
0:09:06.14,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and more to do with sanity.

193
0:09:09.225,000 --> 0:09:11,000
We weren't the only kids who grew up this way.

194
0:09:12.47,000 --> 0:09:14,000
To this day, kids are still being called names.

195
0:09:16.18,000 --> 0:09:2,000
The classics were "Hey, stupid," "Hey, spaz."

196
0:09:21.069,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Seems like every school has an arsenal of names

197
0:09:23.849,000 --> 0:09:24,000
getting updated every year.

198
0:09:26.047,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And if a kid breaks in a school and no one around chooses to hear,

199
0:09:29.214,000 --> 0:09:3,000
do they make a sound?

200
0:09:30.588,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Are they just background noise from a soundtrack stuck on repeat,

201
0:09:33.753,000 --> 0:09:36,000
when people say things like, "Kids can be cruel."

202
0:09:37.788,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Every school was a big top circus tent,

203
0:09:41.037,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and the pecking order went from acrobats to lion tamers,

204
0:09:43.876,000 --> 0:09:46,000
from clowns to carnies, all of these miles ahead of who we were.

205
0:09:47.249,000 --> 0:09:48,000
We were freaks --

206
0:09:48.695,000 --> 0:09:5,000
lobster-claw boys and bearded ladies,

207
0:09:51.316,000 --> 0:09:53,000
oddities juggling depression and loneliness,

208
0:09:53.426,000 --> 0:09:54,000
playing solitaire, spin the bottle,

209
0:09:55.179,000 --> 0:09:57,000
trying to kiss the wounded parts of ourselves and heal,

210
0:09:57.823,000 --> 0:09:59,000
but at night, while the others slept,

211
0:10:00.444,000 --> 0:10:01,000
we kept walking the tightrope.

212
0:10:03.07,000 --> 0:10:05,000
It was practice, and yes, some of us fell.

213
0:10:06.9,000 --> 0:10:09,000
But I want to tell them that all of this

214
0:10:09.925,000 --> 0:10:11,000
is just debris

215
0:10:11.964,000 --> 0:10:15,000
left over when we finally decide to smash all the things we thought we used to be,

216
0:10:16.692,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and if you can't see anything beautiful about yourself,

217
0:10:20.636,000 --> 0:10:24,000
get a better mirror, look a little closer, stare a little longer,

218
0:10:25.343,000 --> 0:10:27,000
because there's something inside you that made you keep trying

219
0:10:28.284,000 --> 0:10:29,000
despite everyone who told you to quit.

220
0:10:30.208,000 --> 0:10:32,000
You built a cast around your broken heart

221
0:10:32.275,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and signed it yourself, "They were wrong."

222
0:10:34.34,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Because maybe you didn't belong to a group or a clique.

223
0:10:36.967,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Maybe they decided to pick you last for basketball or everything.

224
0:10:40.048,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Maybe you used to bring bruises and broken teeth to show-and-tell, but never told,

225
0:10:43.932,000 --> 0:10:44,000
because how can you hold your ground

226
0:10:45.679,000 --> 0:10:47,000
if everyone around you wants to bury you beneath it?

227
0:10:48.134,000 --> 0:10:49,000
You have to believe that they were wrong.

228
0:10:51.695,000 --> 0:10:52,000
They have to be wrong.

229
0:10:54.378,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Why else would we still be here?

230
0:10:58.028,000 --> 0:11:,000
We grew up learning to cheer on the underdog

231
0:11:00.373,000 --> 0:11:01,000
because we see ourselves in them.

232
0:11:03.111,000 --> 0:11:05,000
We stem from a root planted in the belief

233
0:11:05.259,000 --> 0:11:06,000
that we are not what we were called.

234
0:11:07.984,000 --> 0:11:11,000
We are not abandoned cars stalled out and sitting empty on some highway,

235
0:11:12.297,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and if in some way we are, don't worry.

236
0:11:14.216,000 --> 0:11:15,000
We only got out to walk and get gas.

237
0:11:16.233,000 --> 0:11:19,000
We are graduating members from the class of We Made It,

238
0:11:19.536,000 --> 0:11:21,000
not the faded echoes of voices crying out,

239
0:11:21.56,000 --> 0:11:22,000
"Names will never hurt me."

240
0:11:26.274,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Of course they did.

241
0:11:30.846,000 --> 0:11:33,000
But our lives will only ever always continue to be a balancing act

242
0:11:35.877,000 --> 0:11:36,000
that has less to do with pain

243
0:11:38.853,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and more to do with beauty.

244
0:11:42.663,000 --> 0:11:49,000
(Applause)

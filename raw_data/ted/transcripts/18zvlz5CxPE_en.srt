1
0:00:13.67,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Someone who looks like me walks past you in the street.

2
0:00:18.772,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Do you think they're a mother,

3
0:00:20.751,000 --> 0:00:21,000
a refugee

4
0:00:22.199,000 --> 0:00:24,000
or a victim of oppression?

5
0:00:24.253,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Or do you think they're a cardiologist,

6
0:00:26.454,000 --> 0:00:27,000
a barrister

7
0:00:27.496,000 --> 0:00:28,000
or maybe your local politician?

8
0:00:30.325,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Do you look me up and down,

9
0:00:32.283,000 --> 0:00:33,000
wondering how hot I must get

10
0:00:33.775,000 --> 0:00:36,000
or if my husband has forced me to wear this outfit?

11
0:00:38.384,000 --> 0:00:4,000
What if I wore my scarf like this?

12
0:00:43.531,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I can walk down the street in the exact same outfit

13
0:00:46.763,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and what the world expects of me and the way I'm treated

14
0:00:49.42,000 --> 0:00:52,000
depends on the arrangement of this piece of cloth.

15
0:00:52.771,000 --> 0:00:55,000
But this isn't going to be another monologue about the hijab

16
0:00:55.885,000 --> 0:00:58,000
because Lord knows, Muslim women are so much more than the piece of cloth

17
0:00:59.861,000 --> 0:01:02,000
they choose, or not, to wrap their head in.

18
0:01:03.82,000 --> 0:01:06,000
This is about looking beyond your bias.

19
0:01:08.204,000 --> 0:01:09,000
What if I walked past you and later on

20
0:01:10.084,000 --> 0:01:13,000
you'd found out that actually I was a race car engineer,

21
0:01:13.678,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and that I designed my own race car and I ran my university's race team,

22
0:01:17.122,000 --> 0:01:18,000
because it's true.

23
0:01:19.117,000 --> 0:01:24,000
What if I told you that I was actually trained as a boxer for five years,

24
0:01:24.127,000 --> 0:01:25,000
because that's true, too.

25
0:01:26.224,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Would it surprise you?

26
0:01:29.038,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Why?

27
0:01:31.487,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Ladies and gentlemen, ultimately,

28
0:01:33.319,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that surprise and the behaviors associated with it

29
0:01:36.347,000 --> 0:01:38,000
are the product of something called unconscious bias,

30
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:4,000
or implicit prejudice.

31
0:01:40.372,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And that results in the ridiculously detrimental

32
0:01:43.613,000 --> 0:01:44,000
lack of diversity in our workforce,

33
0:01:45.351,000 --> 0:01:47,000
particularly in areas of influence.

34
0:01:47.714,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Hello, Australian Federal Cabinet.

35
0:01:50.246,000 --> 0:01:52,000
(Applause)

36
0:01:52.318,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Let me just set something out from the outset:

37
0:01:55.327,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Unconscious bias is not the same as conscious discrimination.

38
0:01:58.689,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I'm not saying that in all of you, there's a secret sexist or racist

39
0:02:02.199,000 --> 0:02:04,000
or ageist lurking within, waiting to get out.

40
0:02:04.841,000 --> 0:02:05,000
That's not what I'm saying.

41
0:02:06.578,000 --> 0:02:07,000
We all have our biases.

42
0:02:08.53,000 --> 0:02:11,000
They're the filters through which we see the world around us.

43
0:02:11.869,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I'm not accusing anyone,

44
0:02:13.844,000 --> 0:02:14,000
bias is not an accusation.

45
0:02:15.338,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Rather, it's something that has to be identified,

46
0:02:17.879,000 --> 0:02:2,000
acknowledged and mitigated against.

47
0:02:21.082,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Bias can be about race,

48
0:02:22.476,000 --> 0:02:23,000
it can be about gender.

49
0:02:23.68,000 --> 0:02:26,000
It can also be about class, education, disability.

50
0:02:27.383,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The fact is, we all have biases against what's different,

51
0:02:30.406,000 --> 0:02:32,000
what's different to our social norms.

52
0:02:33.335,000 --> 0:02:36,000
The thing is, if we want to live in a world

53
0:02:36.359,000 --> 0:02:39,000
where the circumstances of your birth

54
0:02:39.494,000 --> 0:02:41,000
do not dictate your future

55
0:02:41.935,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and where equal opportunity is ubiquitous,

56
0:02:44.14,000 --> 0:02:47,000
then each and every one of us has a role to play

57
0:02:47.697,000 --> 0:02:5,000
in making sure unconscious bias does not determine our lives.

58
0:02:52.12,000 --> 0:02:55,000
There's this really famous experiment in the space of unconscious bias

59
0:02:55.909,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and that's in the space of gender in the 1970s and 1980s.

60
0:02:59.637,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So orchestras, back in the day, were made up mostly of dudes,

61
0:03:03.672,000 --> 0:03:05,000
up to only five percent were female.

62
0:03:06.473,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And apparently, that was because men played it differently,

63
0:03:09.741,000 --> 0:03:11,000
presumably better, presumably.

64
0:03:12.555,000 --> 0:03:14,000
But in 1952, The Boston Symphony Orchestra

65
0:03:15.517,000 --> 0:03:16,000
started an experiment.

66
0:03:17.282,000 --> 0:03:18,000
They started blind auditions.

67
0:03:19.125,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So rather than face-to-face auditions, you would have to play behind a screen.

68
0:03:22.954,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Now funnily enough,

69
0:03:24.466,000 --> 0:03:26,000
no immediate change was registered

70
0:03:26.754,000 --> 0:03:29,000
until they asked the audition-ers to take their shoes off

71
0:03:29.89,000 --> 0:03:3,000
before they entered the room.

72
0:03:31.578,000 --> 0:03:33,000
because the clickity-clack of the heels

73
0:03:33.618,000 --> 0:03:34,000
against the hardwood floors

74
0:03:35.559,000 --> 0:03:37,000
was enough to give the ladies away.

75
0:03:37.828,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Now get this,

76
0:03:39.334,000 --> 0:03:4,000
there results of the audition showed

77
0:03:41.196,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that there was a 50 percent increased chance

78
0:03:44.196,000 --> 0:03:46,000
a woman would progress past the preliminary stage.

79
0:03:47.126,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And it almost tripled their chances of getting in.

80
0:03:51.58,000 --> 0:03:52,000
What does that tell us?

81
0:03:53.093,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Well, unfortunately for the guys, men actually didn't play differently,

82
0:03:56.929,000 --> 0:03:58,000
but there was the perception that they did.

83
0:03:59.829,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And it was that bias that was determining their outcome.

84
0:04:03.146,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So what we're doing here is identifying and acknowledging

85
0:04:06.244,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that a bias exists.

86
0:04:07.292,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And look, we all do it.

87
0:04:08.91,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Let me give you an example.

88
0:04:10.697,000 --> 0:04:13,000
A son and his father are in a horrible car accident.

89
0:04:14.475,000 --> 0:04:15,000
The father dies on impact

90
0:04:16.339,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and the son, who's severely injured, is rushed to hospital.

91
0:04:19.999,000 --> 0:04:22,000
The surgeon looks at the son when they arrive and is like,

92
0:04:23.381,000 --> 0:04:25,000
"I can't operate."

93
0:04:25.788,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Why?

94
0:04:27.694,000 --> 0:04:3,000
"The boy is my son."

95
0:04:30.9,000 --> 0:04:31,000
How can that be?

96
0:04:32.248,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

97
0:04:33.468,000 --> 0:04:35,000
the surgeon is his mother.

98
0:04:36.334,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Now hands up -- and it's okay --

99
0:04:38.077,000 --> 0:04:41,000
but hands up if you initially assumed the surgeon was a guy?

100
0:04:42.917,000 --> 0:04:44,000
There's evidence that that unconscious bias exists,

101
0:04:45.838,000 --> 0:04:48,000
but we all just have to acknowledge that it's there

102
0:04:48.87,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and then look at ways that we can move past it

103
0:04:51.554,000 --> 0:04:53,000
so that we can look at solutions.

104
0:04:54.588,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Now one of the interesting things

105
0:04:57.075,000 --> 0:05:,000
around the space of unconscious bias is the topic of quotas.

106
0:05:00.357,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And this something that's often brought up.

107
0:05:02.682,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And of of the criticisms is this idea of merit.

108
0:05:05.993,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Look, I don't want to be picked because I'm a chick,

109
0:05:09.165,000 --> 0:05:11,000
I want to be picked because I have merit,

110
0:05:11.432,000 --> 0:05:13,000
because I'm the best person for the job.

111
0:05:13.608,000 --> 0:05:15,000
It's a sentiment that's pretty common among female engineers

112
0:05:16.507,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that I work with and that I know.

113
0:05:18.413,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And yeah, I get it, I've been there.

114
0:05:20.314,000 --> 0:05:22,000
But, if the merit idea was true,

115
0:05:22.653,000 --> 0:05:26,000
why would identical resumes, in an experiment done in 2012 by Yale,

116
0:05:27.42,000 --> 0:05:31,000
identical resumes sent out for a lab technician,

117
0:05:32.014,000 --> 0:05:35,000
why would Jennifers be deemed less competent,

118
0:05:35.23,000 --> 0:05:37,000
be less likely to be offered the job,

119
0:05:37.494,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and be paid less than Johns.

120
0:05:42.191,000 --> 0:05:43,000
The unconscious bias is there,

121
0:05:43.624,000 --> 0:05:45,000
but we just have to look at how we can move past it.

122
0:05:46.06,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And, you know, it's interesting,

123
0:05:47.681,000 --> 0:05:48,000
there's some research that talks about

124
0:05:49.494,000 --> 0:05:51,000
why this is the case and it's called the merit paradox.

125
0:05:52.346,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And in organizations -- and this is kind of ironic --

126
0:05:54.867,000 --> 0:05:57,000
in organizations that talk about merit being their primary value-driver

127
0:05:58.694,000 --> 0:05:59,000
in terms of who they hire,

128
0:06:00.066,000 --> 0:06:03,000
they were more likely to hire dudes and more likely to pay the guys more

129
0:06:03.561,000 --> 0:06:06,000
because apparently merit is a masculine quality.

130
0:06:07.168,000 --> 0:06:08,000
But, hey.

131
0:06:08.43,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So you guys think you've got a good read on me,

132
0:06:10.744,000 --> 0:06:13,000
you kinda think you know what's up.

133
0:06:14.175,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Can you imagine me running one of these?

134
0:06:17.748,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Can you imagine me walking in and being like,

135
0:06:20.035,000 --> 0:06:23,000
"Hey boys, this is what's up. This is how it's done."

136
0:06:23.14,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Well, I'm glad you can.

137
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
(Applause)

138
0:06:37.233,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Because ladies and gentlemen, that's my day job.

139
0:06:40.31,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And the cool thing about it is that it's pretty entertaining.

140
0:06:43.247,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Actually, in places like Malaysia,

141
0:06:44.935,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Muslim women on rigs isn't even comment-worthy.

142
0:06:47.395,000 --> 0:06:48,000
There are that many of them.

143
0:06:48.764,000 --> 0:06:49,000
But, it is entertaining.

144
0:06:49.992,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I remember, I was telling one of the guys,

145
0:06:52.049,000 --> 0:06:54,000
"Hey, mate, look, I really want to learn how to surf."

146
0:06:54.62,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And he's like, "Yassmin, I don't know how you can surf

147
0:06:57.181,000 --> 0:06:59,000
with all that gear you've got on,

148
0:06:59.552,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and I don't know any women-only beaches."

149
0:07:02.226,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And then, the guy came up with a brilliant idea,

150
0:07:04.51,000 --> 0:07:06,000
he was like, "I know, you run that organization

151
0:07:06.768,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Youth Without Borders, right?

152
0:07:08.628,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Why don't you start a clothing line for Muslim chicks in beaches.

153
0:07:13.282,000 --> 0:07:15,000
You can call it Youth Without Boardshorts."

154
0:07:15.919,000 --> 0:07:16,000
(Laughter)

155
0:07:17.435,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And I was like, "Thanks, guys."

156
0:07:19.25,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And I remember another bloke telling me that

157
0:07:22.356,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I should eat all the yogurt I could

158
0:07:24.169,000 --> 0:07:27,000
because that was the only culture I was going to get around there.

159
0:07:29.477,000 --> 0:07:31,000
But, the problem is, it's kind of true

160
0:07:32.366,000 --> 0:07:35,000
because there's an intense lack of diversity in our workforce,

161
0:07:35.704,000 --> 0:07:37,000
particularly in places of influence.

162
0:07:37.992,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Now, in 2010,

163
0:07:39.352,000 --> 0:07:41,000
The Australian National University did an experiment

164
0:07:41.825,000 --> 0:07:44,000
where they sent out 4,000 identical applications

165
0:07:45.431,000 --> 0:07:48,000
to entry level jobs, essentially.

166
0:07:48.963,000 --> 0:07:52,000
To get the same number of interviews as someone with an Anglo-Saxon name,

167
0:07:53.177,000 --> 0:07:57,000
if you were Chinese, you had to send out 68 percent more applications.

168
0:07:57.674,000 --> 0:07:59,000
If you were Middle Eastern -- Abdel-Magied --

169
0:08:00.368,000 --> 0:08:02,000
you had to send out 64 percent,

170
0:08:02.418,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and if you're Italian, you're pretty lucky,

171
0:08:04.581,000 --> 0:08:06,000
you only have to send out 12 percent more.

172
0:08:07.142,000 --> 0:08:1,000
In places like Silicon Valley, it's not that much better.

173
0:08:10.151,000 --> 0:08:12,000
In Google, they put out some diversity results

174
0:08:12.448,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and 61 percent white, 30 percent Asian and nine, a bunch of blacks, Hispanics,

175
0:08:19.39,000 --> 0:08:2,000
all that kind of thing.

176
0:08:20.717,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And the rest of the tech world is not that much better

177
0:08:23.345,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and they've acknowledged it,

178
0:08:24.677,000 --> 0:08:26,000
but I'm not really sure what they're doing about it.

179
0:08:27.225,000 --> 0:08:29,000
The thing is, it doesn't trickle up.

180
0:08:29.445,000 --> 0:08:3,000
In a study done by Green Park,

181
0:08:31.203,000 --> 0:08:35,000
who are a British senior exec supplier,

182
0:08:35.275,000 --> 0:08:39,000
they said that over half of the FTSE 100 companies

183
0:08:39.738,000 --> 0:08:41,000
don't have a nonwhite leader at their board level,

184
0:08:42.138,000 --> 0:08:43,000
executive or non-executive.

185
0:08:43.593,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And two out of every three don't have an executive

186
0:08:47.686,000 --> 0:08:49,000
who's from a minority.

187
0:08:49.956,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And most of the minorities that are at that sort of level

188
0:08:52.778,000 --> 0:08:53,000
are non-executive board directors.

189
0:08:54.42,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So their influence isn't that great.

190
0:08:57.086,000 --> 0:08:59,000
I've told you a bunch of terrible things.

191
0:08:59.301,000 --> 0:09:02,000
You're like, "Oh my god, how bad is that? What can I do about it?"

192
0:09:03.662,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Well, fortunately,

193
0:09:05.815,000 --> 0:09:07,000
we've identified that there's a problem.

194
0:09:07.857,000 --> 0:09:11,000
There's a lack of opportunity, and that's due to unconscious bias.

195
0:09:13.713,000 --> 0:09:14,000
But you might be sitting there thinking,

196
0:09:15.672,000 --> 0:09:18,000
"I ain't brown. What's that got to do with me?"

197
0:09:20.042,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Let me offer you a solution.

198
0:09:22.466,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And as I've said before,

199
0:09:23.717,000 --> 0:09:26,000
we live in a world where we're looking for an ideal.

200
0:09:27.568,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And if we want to create a world

201
0:09:29.208,000 --> 0:09:31,000
where the circumstances of your birth don't matter,

202
0:09:31.809,000 --> 0:09:33,000
we all have to be part of the solution.

203
0:09:33.838,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And interestingly, the author of the lab resume experiment

204
0:09:36.913,000 --> 0:09:37,000
offered some sort of a solution.

205
0:09:38.514,000 --> 0:09:41,000
She said the one thing that brought the successful women together,

206
0:09:42.248,000 --> 0:09:43,000
the one thing that they had in common,

207
0:09:44.227,000 --> 0:09:46,000
was the fact that they had good mentors.

208
0:09:46.694,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So mentoring, we've all kind of heard that before,

209
0:09:49.139,000 --> 0:09:51,000
it's in the vernacular.

210
0:09:52.267,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Here's another challenge for you.

211
0:09:54.661,000 --> 0:09:58,000
I challenge each and every one of you to mentor someone different.

212
0:09:59.771,000 --> 0:10:,000
Think about it.

213
0:10:00.988,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Everyone wants to mentor someone who kind of is familiar,

214
0:10:04.034,000 --> 0:10:04,000
who looks like us,

215
0:10:04.893,000 --> 0:10:05,000
we have shared experiences.

216
0:10:06.367,000 --> 0:10:08,000
If I see a Muslim chick who's got a bit of attitude,

217
0:10:09.028,000 --> 0:10:1,000
I'm like, "What's up? We can hang out."

218
0:10:10.881,000 --> 0:10:13,000
You walk into a room and there's someone who went to the same school,

219
0:10:14.117,000 --> 0:10:15,000
you play the same sports,

220
0:10:15.428,000 --> 0:10:18,000
there's a high chance that you're going to want to help that person out.

221
0:10:19.016,000 --> 0:10:22,000
But for the person in the room who has no shared experiences with you

222
0:10:22.509,000 --> 0:10:24,000
it becomes extremely difficult to find that connection.

223
0:10:25.415,000 --> 0:10:27,000
The idea of finding someone different to mentor,

224
0:10:27.834,000 --> 0:10:29,000
someone who doesn't come from the same background as you,

225
0:10:30.505,000 --> 0:10:31,000
whatever that background is,

226
0:10:31.988,000 --> 0:10:34,000
is about opening doors for people who couldn't even get

227
0:10:35.336,000 --> 0:10:36,000
to the damn hallway.

228
0:10:38.081,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Because ladies and gentlemen, the world is not just.

229
0:10:41.566,000 --> 0:10:43,000
People are not born with equal opportunity.

230
0:10:43.699,000 --> 0:10:46,000
I was born in one of the poorest cities in the world, Khartoum.

231
0:10:46.986,000 --> 0:10:48,000
I was born brown, I was born female,

232
0:10:49.107,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and I was born Muslim in a world that is pretty suspicious of us

233
0:10:52.941,000 --> 0:10:55,000
for reasons I can't control.

234
0:10:56.186,000 --> 0:10:59,000
However, I also acknowledge the fact that I was born with privilege.

235
0:11:00.156,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I was born with amazing parents,

236
0:11:01.825,000 --> 0:11:02,000
I was given an education

237
0:11:03.43,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and had the blessing of migrating to Australia.

238
0:11:06.067,000 --> 0:11:08,000
But also, I've been blessed with amazing mentors

239
0:11:08.658,000 --> 0:11:11,000
who've opened doors for me that I didn't even know were there.

240
0:11:11.674,000 --> 0:11:12,000
A mentor who said to me,

241
0:11:13.032,000 --> 0:11:14,000
"Hey, your story's interesting.

242
0:11:14.635,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Let's write something about it so that I can share it with people."

243
0:11:17.862,000 --> 0:11:18,000
A mentor who said,

244
0:11:18.868,000 --> 0:11:21,000
"I know you're all those things that don't belong on an Australian rig,

245
0:11:22.219,000 --> 0:11:23,000
but come on anyway."

246
0:11:23.548,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And here I am, talking to you.

247
0:11:25.055,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And I'm not the only one.

248
0:11:26.393,000 --> 0:11:28,000
There's all sorts of people in my communities

249
0:11:28.862,000 --> 0:11:3,000
that I see have been helped out by mentors.

250
0:11:31.026,000 --> 0:11:32,000
A young Muslim man in Sydney

251
0:11:32.805,000 --> 0:11:35,000
who ended up using his mentor's help

252
0:11:35.973,000 --> 0:11:38,000
to start up a poetry slam in Bankstown

253
0:11:39.476,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and now it's a huge thing.

254
0:11:41.098,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And he's able to change the lives of so many other young people.

255
0:11:44.218,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Or a lady here in Brisbane,

256
0:11:45.542,000 --> 0:11:46,000
an Afghan lady who's a refugee,

257
0:11:47.4,000 --> 0:11:49,000
who could barely speak English when she came to Australia,

258
0:11:50.151,000 --> 0:11:51,000
her mentors helped her become a doctor

259
0:11:52.03,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and she took our Young Queenslander of the Year Award in 2008.

260
0:11:55.253,000 --> 0:11:57,000
She's an inspiration.

261
0:12:02.366,000 --> 0:12:03,000
This is so not smooth.

262
0:12:06.376,000 --> 0:12:08,000
This is me.

263
0:12:08.94,000 --> 0:12:1,000
But I'm also the woman in the rig clothes,

264
0:12:11.812,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and I'm also the woman who was in the abaya at the beginning.

265
0:12:15.611,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Would you have chosen to mentor me if you had seen me

266
0:12:18.709,000 --> 0:12:2,000
in one of those other versions of who I am?

267
0:12:20.962,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Because I'm that same person.

268
0:12:24.11,000 --> 0:12:26,000
We have to look past our unconscious bias,

269
0:12:27.014,000 --> 0:12:3,000
find someone to mentor who's at the opposite end of your spectrum

270
0:12:30.206,000 --> 0:12:32,000
because structural change takes time,

271
0:12:32.591,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and I don't have that level of patience.

272
0:12:36.707,000 --> 0:12:37,000
So if we're going to create a change,

273
0:12:38.468,000 --> 0:12:39,000
if we're going to create a world

274
0:12:40.03,000 --> 0:12:42,000
where we all have those kinds of opportunities,

275
0:12:42.286,000 --> 0:12:44,000
then choose to open doors for people.

276
0:12:44.657,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Because you might think that diversity has nothing to do with you,

277
0:12:48.471,000 --> 0:12:49,000
but we are all part of this system

278
0:12:50.205,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and we can all be part of that solution.

279
0:12:52.301,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And if you don't know where to find someone different,

280
0:12:54.855,000 --> 0:12:55,000
go to the places you wouldn't usually go.

281
0:12:56.833,000 --> 0:12:58,000
If you enroll in private high school tutoring,

282
0:12:58.996,000 --> 0:12:59,000
go to your local state school

283
0:13:00.463,000 --> 0:13:03,000
or maybe just drop into your local refugee tutoring center.

284
0:13:03.893,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Or perhaps you work at an office.

285
0:13:05.616,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Take out that new grad who looks totally out of place --

286
0:13:08.614,000 --> 0:13:09,000
'cause that was me --

287
0:13:09.942,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and open doors for them,

288
0:13:11.27,000 --> 0:13:13,000
not in a tokenistic way, because we're not victims,

289
0:13:13.9,000 --> 0:13:15,000
but show them the opportunities

290
0:13:15.968,000 --> 0:13:17,000
because opening up your world

291
0:13:18.07,000 --> 0:13:2,000
will make you realize that you have access to doors

292
0:13:20.741,000 --> 0:13:21,000
that they didn't even know existed

293
0:13:22.565,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and you didn't even know they didn't have.

294
0:13:25.501,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

295
0:13:28.358,000 --> 0:13:31,000
there is a problem in our community with lack of opportunity,

296
0:13:31.907,000 --> 0:13:32,000
especially due to unconscious bias.

297
0:13:33.75,000 --> 0:13:37,000
But each and every one one of you has the potential to change that.

298
0:13:37.782,000 --> 0:13:39,000
I know you've been given a lot of challenges today,

299
0:13:40.654,000 --> 0:13:43,000
but if you can take this one piece and think about it a little differently,

300
0:13:44.495,000 --> 0:13:47,000
because diversity is magic.

301
0:13:47.736,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And I encourage you to look past your initial perceptions

302
0:13:51.554,000 --> 0:13:52,000
because I bet you,

303
0:13:53.378,000 --> 0:13:54,000
they're probably wrong.

304
0:13:55.199,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Thank you.

305
0:13:57.624,000 --> 0:14:,000
(Applause)

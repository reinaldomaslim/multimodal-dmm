1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I don't speak English.

2
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I start speaking English, learning English, about a year ago.

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I speak French and I grew up with French, so my English is Franglais.

4
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I'm born in the Western Congo, in an area around here,

5
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and then went to university in Kisangani.

6
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And after I finished, I went to this area, the Ituri Forest.

7
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
But what I've been doing --

8
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
when I was about 14, I grew in my uncle's house.

9
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And my father was a soldier,

10
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and my uncle was a fisherman and also a poacher.

11
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
What I've been doing from 14 to 17 was,

12
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I was assisting them collecting ivory tusk, meat

13
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and whatever they were killing, poaching, hunting in the forest,

14
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
bring it in the main city to get access to the market.

15
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
But finally, I got myself involved.

16
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Around 17 to 20 years, I became, myself, a poacher.

17
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And I wanted to do it, because -- I believed -- to continue my studies.

18
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I wanted to go to university, but my father was poor, my uncle even.

19
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So, I did it.

20
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And for three to four years, I went to university.

21
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
For three times, I applied to biomedical science, to be a doctor.

22
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I didn't succeed.

23
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I was having my inscriptions, my admission to biology.

24
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And I said, "No way, I'm not doing it.

25
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
My family's poor, my area don't have better health care.

26
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I want to be a doctor to serve them."

27
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Three times, that means three years, and I start getting old.

28
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I say, "Oh, no, I continue."

29
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So, I did tropical ecology and plant botany.

30
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
When I finished, I went to the Ituri Forest for my internship.

31
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
It's where I really getting passion with what I'm doing

32
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
right up to now -- I'm standing in front of you --

33
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
doing botany and wildlife conservation.

34
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
That time the Ituri Forest was created as a forest reserve

35
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
with some animals and also plants.

36
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And the training center there was built

37
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
around the scientific Congolese staff

38
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and some American scientists also.

39
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So, the Okapi Faunal Reserve protects number --

40
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I think that is the largest number of elephants

41
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
we have right now in protected areas in Congo.

42
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It has also chimpanzees.

43
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And it has been named Okapi Faunal Reserve

44
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
because of this beautiful creature.

45
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
That is a forest giraffe.

46
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I think you guys know it quite well.

47
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Here we have savanna giraffes,

48
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
but through evolution we have this forest giraffe

49
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that lives only in Congo.

50
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It has also some beautiful primates.

51
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Thirteen species -- highest diversity we can find in one single area in Africa.

52
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And it has the Ituri Forest itself --

53
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
about 1,300 species of plants, so far known.

54
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I joined the Wildlife Conservation Society, working there, in 1995,

55
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
but I started working with them as a student in 1991.

56
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I was appointed as a teaching assistant at my university

57
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
because I accomplished with honor.

58
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But I didn't like the way -- the instruction I got was very poor.

59
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And I wanted to be formed to a training center and a research center.

60
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
With the end of the dictatorship regime of Mobutu Sese Seko,

61
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that most of you know, life became very, very difficult.

62
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And the work we have been doing

63
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
was completely difficult to do and to achieve it.

64
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
When Kabila started his movement to liberate Congo,

65
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
so Mobutu soldiers started moving and retreated.

66
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So they started fleeing from the east to the west.

67
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And the Okapi Faunal Reserve is there,

68
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
so there was a road from Goma, somewhere here,

69
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and coming like this.

70
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So they might go through, pass through the Okapi Faunal Reserve.

71
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Congo has five of the world's richest sites of protected area,

72
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and the Okapi Faunal Reserve is one of them.

73
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So soldier was fleeing in the Okapi Faunal Reserve.

74
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
On their way, they looted everything.

75
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Torture, wars -- oh, my God, you can't believe.

76
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Every person was looking his way -- where to go, we don't know.

77
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And it was for us, the young, the first time really

78
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
we hear the language of war, of guns.

79
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And even people who faced the rebellion of 1963,

80
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
after our independence, they didn't believe what was happening.

81
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
They were killing people. They were doing whatever they want

82
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
because they have power.

83
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Who have been doing that?

84
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Young children. Child soldiers.

85
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
You can't ask him how old he is because he has guns.

86
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
But I was from the west, working in the east.

87
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I even [at] that time was not speaking Swahili.

88
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And when they came, they looted everything.

89
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
You can't speak Lingala because Lingala was from Mobutu,

90
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and everyone speaking Lingala is soldier.

91
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And I was from the same area to him.

92
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
All my friends said, we are leaving because we are a target.

93
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
But I'm not going to the east, because I don't know Swahili.

94
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I stay. If I go, I will be killed.

95
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I can't go back to my area -- it's more than 1,000 kilometers [away].

96
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
I stayed after they looted everything.

97
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
We have been doing research on botany,

98
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and we have a small herbarium of 4,500 sheets of plants.

99
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
We cut, we dry and we packed them,

100
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
we mounted them on a folder.

101
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Purpose: so that we start them for agriculture,

102
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
for medicine, for whatever, and for science,

103
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
for the study of the flora and the change of the forest.

104
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
That is people moving around, that's even Pygmies.

105
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And this is a bright guy, hard-working person, and Pygmy.

106
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I've been working with him about 10 years.

107
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And with soldiers, they went to the forest for poaching elephants.

108
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Because he's Pygmy, he knows how to track elephants in the forest.

109
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
He has been attacked by a leopard and they abandon him in the forest.

110
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
They came to told me, I have to save him.

111
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And what I did, I gave him just antibiotics

112
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
that we care for tuberculosis.

113
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And fortunately, I saved his life.

114
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And that was the language of the war.

115
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Everywhere there has been constant extraction of mineral,

116
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
killing animals, the logging timbers and so on.

117
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And what of important things --

118
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I think all of you here have a cell phone.

119
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
That mineral has killed a lot:

120
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
five millions of Congolese have gone because of this

121
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Colombo-Tantalite -- they call it Coltan --

122
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
that they use it to make cell phones

123
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and it has been in that area, all over in Congo. Extraction,

124
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and good, big business of the war.

125
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And what I did for the first war, after we have lost everything,

126
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
I have to save something, even myself, my life and life of the staff.

127
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I buried some of our new vehicle engines, I buried it to save it.

128
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And some of equipment went with them,

129
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
on the top of the canopy, to save it.

130
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
He's not collecting plants, he's going to save our equipment

131
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
on the canopy.

132
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And with the material that's left --

133
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
because they wanted to destroy it, to burn it,

134
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
they didn't understand it, they didn't go to school --

135
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I packed it.

136
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And that is me, going to, hurrying to Uganda,

137
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
to try to save that 4,000 material,

138
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
with people carrying them on the bikes, bicycles.

139
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And after that, we succeeded.

140
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I housed that 4,000 material at the herbarium of Makerere University.

141
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And after the war, I have been able to bring it back home,

142
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
so that we continue our studies.

143
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
The second war came while we didn't expect it.

144
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
With friends, we had been sitting and watching match football,

145
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and having some good music with WorldSpace radio,

146
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
when it started, I think.

147
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
So, it was so bad.

148
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
We heard that now from the east again the war started,

149
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and it's going fast.

150
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
This time I think Kabila will go in place of, as he did with Mobutu.

151
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And the reserve was a target to the rebels.

152
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Three different movements and two militia acting in the same area

153
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and competing for natural resources.

154
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And there was no way to work.

155
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
They destroy everything.

156
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Poaching -- oh, no way.

157
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And that's the powerful men. We have to meet and to talk to them.

158
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
What's the regulation of the reserve

159
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and what is the regulation of the parks?

160
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And they can't do what they are doing.

161
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
So we went to meet them.

162
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
That is Coltan extraction, gold mining.

163
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
So, we started talking with them,

164
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
convincing them that we are in a protected area.

165
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
There are regulations

166
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
that it's prohibited to do logging, mining and poaching, specifically.

167
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
But they said, "You guys,

168
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
you think that soldiers who are dying are not important,

169
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and your animals you are protecting are most important.

170
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
We don't think so.

171
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
We have to do it, because to let our movement advance."

172
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I say, "No way, you are not going to do it here."

173
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
We started talking with them and I was negotiating.

174
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Tried to protect our equipment, tried to protect our staff

175
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and the villages of about 1,500 people.

176
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And we continued.

177
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
But I was doing that, negotiating with them.

178
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Sometimes we are having meeting

179
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and they are talking with Jean-Pierre Bemba,

180
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
with Mbusa Nyamwisi, with Kabila, and I'm there.

181
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Sometimes, they talk to my own language, that is, Lingala.

182
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
I hear it and what strategy they are doing, what they are planning.

183
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Sometimes, they are having a helicopter

184
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
to supply them with ammunition and so on.

185
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
They used me to carry that, and I was doing counting,

186
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
what comes from where, and where, and where.

187
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
I had only this equipment -- my satellite phone, my computer

188
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and a plastic solar panel -- that I hide it in the forest.

189
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And every time, daily, after we have meeting,

190
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
what compromise we have, whatever,

191
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
I go, I write a short email, send it.

192
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
I don't know how many people I had on my address.

193
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
I sent the message: what is going about the progress of the war

194
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
and what they are planning to do.

195
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
They started suspecting that what we do on the morning,

196
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and the afternoon, it's on the news, BBC, RFI.

197
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
(Laughter)

198
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Something might be going on.

199
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
And one day, we went for a meeting.

200
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
(Applause)

201
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Sorry.

202
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
One day, we went to meet the Chief Commander.

203
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
He had the same iridium cell phone like me.

204
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And he asked me, "Do you know how to use this?"

205
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
I said, "I have never seen it.

206
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
(Laughter)

207
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
I don't know."

208
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And I had mine on my pocket.

209
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
So, it was a chance that they trusted me a lot.

210
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
They didn't -- they was not looking on me.

211
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
So I was scared.

212
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And when we finished the meeting, I went to return it in the forest.

213
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And I was sending news, doing whatever,

214
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
reporting daily to the U.N., to UNESCO, to our institution in New York,

215
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
what have been going.

216
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And for that, they have been having big pressure to leave, to free the area.

217
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
Because there was no way --

218
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
whatever they do, it's known the same time.

219
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
During the first two rebellions, they killed all animals in the zoo.

220
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
We have a zoo of 14 Okapis, and one of them was pregnant.

221
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And during the war, after a week of heavy war, fighting in the area,

222
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
we succeeded: we had the first Okapi.

223
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
This is the only trouser and shirt remind me of this.

224
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
This is not local population, this is rebels.

225
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
They are now happy sending the news

226
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
that they have protected the Okapi with the war,

227
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
because we sent the news that they are killing

228
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and poaching everywhere.

229
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
After a week, we celebrated the birthday of that Okapi,

230
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
they killed an elephant, just 50 meters to the area

231
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
where the zoo, where Okapi was born.

232
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And I was mad.

233
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
I oppose it -- that they are now going to dissect it,

234
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
until I do my report and then I see the Chief Commander.

235
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And I succeeded.

236
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
The elephant just decayed and they just got the tusks.

237
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
What we are doing after that -- that was the situation of the war --

238
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
we have to rebuild.

239
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
I had some money. I was paid 150 dollars.

240
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
I devoted half of it to rebuild the herbarium,

241
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
because we didn't have good infrastructure to start plants.

242
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Wildlife Conservation Society more dealing with plants.

243
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
I started this with 70 dollars,

244
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and start fundraising money to where I've been going.

245
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
I had opportunity to go all over,

246
0:14:33.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
where herbarium for my African material is.

247
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And they supported me a bit, and I built this.

248
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Now, it's doing work to train young Congolese.

249
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
And also, what one of the speciality we are doing,

250
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
my design is tracking the global warming effect on biodiversity,

251
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
and what the impacts of the Ituri Forest is playing to uptake carbon.

252
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
This is one of the studies we are doing on a 40-hectare plot,

253
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
where we have tagged trees and lianas from one centimeters,

254
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and we are tracking them.

255
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
We have now data of about 15 years,

256
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
to see how that forest is contributing to the carbon reductions.

257
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
And that is -- I think it's difficult for me.

258
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:28,000
This is a very embarrassing talk, I know.

259
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
I don't know where to start, where to finish it.

260
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
When I was thinking to come here,

261
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
what best title I wanted to say to my talk, I didn't find this.

262
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:44,000
But now I think that I would have titled it, "The Language of Guns."

263
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Where are you people?

264
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Now we are talking about reconstitution, rebuild Africa.

265
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
But is gun industries a tool to rebuild, or is it a game?

266
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:04,000
I think we see the war like a game --

267
0:16:04.16,000 --> 0:16:06,000
like soccer, football.

268
0:16:06.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Everybody is happy, but see what it's doing,

269
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:13,000
see what is going in Darfur.

270
0:16:13.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Now we say, oh, my God.

271
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:16,000
See what the wars in Rwanda.

272
0:16:16.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
That's because of the language of guns.

273
0:16:20.16,000 --> 0:16:24,000
I don't think that someone may blame Google,

274
0:16:24.16,000 --> 0:16:27,000
because it's doing the right things,

275
0:16:27.16,000 --> 0:16:3,000
even if people like Al-Qaeda are using Google

276
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
to connect between them.

277
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:35,000
But it's serving millions for the best.

278
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:38,000
But what is doing with gun industries?

279
0:16:38.16,000 --> 0:16:4,000
Thank you.

280
0:16:40.16,000 --> 0:16:45,000
(Applause)

281
0:16:45.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Chris Anderson: Thank you, thank you.

282
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Just wait over there.

283
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:52,000
It's an amazing story.

284
0:16:52.16,000 --> 0:16:56,000
I suspect a lot of people here have the same question I have.

285
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:17:02,000
How can we help you?

286
0:17:02.16,000 --> 0:17:05,000
Corneille Ewango: That's really embarrassing questions.

287
0:17:06.16,000 --> 0:17:08,000
I think that now I feel nervous.

288
0:17:08.16,000 --> 0:17:14,000
And I think, helping us, people are acting sometimes by ignorance.

289
0:17:14.16,000 --> 0:17:16,000
I did it myself.

290
0:17:16.16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
If I know when I was young,

291
0:17:18.16,000 --> 0:17:21,000
that [by] killing an elephant, I'm destroying biodiversity,

292
0:17:21.16,000 --> 0:17:23,000
I would not have done it.

293
0:17:23.16,000 --> 0:17:27,000
Many, many of you have seen the talents of Africans,

294
0:17:27.16,000 --> 0:17:31,000
but there are few who are going to school.

295
0:17:31.16,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Many are dying because of all those kind of pandemics,

296
0:17:36.16,000 --> 0:17:41,000
HIV, malaria, poverty, not going to school.

297
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:45,000
What you can assist us, it's by building capacities.

298
0:17:45.16,000 --> 0:17:47,000
How many have got opportunity like me

299
0:17:47.16,000 --> 0:17:49,000
to go to U.S., do a master's?

300
0:17:49.16,000 --> 0:17:52,000
And go -- now, I'm in the Netherlands to do a Ph.D.

301
0:17:52.16,000 --> 0:17:55,000
But many of them are just here, because they don't have money.

302
0:17:55.16,000 --> 0:17:58,000
And they can't go even to university.

303
0:17:58.16,000 --> 0:18:01,000
They can't even attain the bachelor's degree.

304
0:18:01.16,000 --> 0:18:05,000
Building capacities for the young generation

305
0:18:05.16,000 --> 0:18:07,000
is going to make a better generation

306
0:18:07.16,000 --> 0:18:1,000
and a better future tomorrow for Africa.

307
0:18:10.16,000 --> 0:18:11,000
CA: Thank you, thank you.

308
0:18:11.16,000 --> 0:18:13,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Our mission is to build

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
a detailed, realistic

3
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
computer model of the human brain.

4
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And we've done, in the past four years,

5
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
a proof of concept

6
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
on a small part of the rodent brain,

7
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and with this proof of concept we are now scaling the project up

8
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
to reach the human brain.

9
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Why are we doing this?

10
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
There are three important reasons.

11
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
The first is, it's essential for us to understand the human brain

12
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
if we do want to get along in society,

13
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and I think that it is a key step in evolution.

14
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
The second reason is,

15
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
we cannot keep doing animal experimentation forever,

16
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and we have to embody all our data and all our knowledge

17
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
into a working model.

18
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
It's like a Noah's Ark. It's like an archive.

19
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And the third reason is that there are two billion people on the planet

20
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that are affected by mental disorder,

21
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and the drugs that are used today

22
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
are largely empirical.

23
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I think that we can come up with very concrete solutions on

24
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
how to treat disorders.

25
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Now, even at this stage,

26
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
we can use the brain model

27
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
to explore some fundamental questions

28
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
about how the brain works.

29
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And here, at TED, for the first time,

30
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I'd like to share with you how we're addressing

31
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
one theory -- there are many theories --

32
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
one theory of how the brain works.

33
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So, this theory is that the brain

34
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
creates, builds, a version of the universe,

35
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and projects this version of the universe,

36
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
like a bubble, all around us.

37
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Now, this is of course a topic of philosophical debate for centuries.

38
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But, for the first time, we can actually address this,

39
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
with brain simulation,

40
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and ask very systematic and rigorous questions,

41
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
whether this theory could possibly be true.

42
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
The reason why the moon is huge on the horizon

43
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
is simply because our perceptual bubble

44
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
does not stretch out 380,000 kilometers.

45
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
It runs out of space.

46
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And so what we do is we compare the buildings

47
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
within our perceptual bubble,

48
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and we make a decision.

49
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
We make a decision it's that big,

50
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
even though it's not that big.

51
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And what that illustrates

52
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
is that decisions are the key things

53
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
that support our perceptual bubble. It keeps it alive.

54
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Without decisions you cannot see, you cannot think,

55
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
you cannot feel.

56
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And you may think that anesthetics work

57
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
by sending you into some deep sleep,

58
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
or by blocking your receptors so that you don't feel pain,

59
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
but in fact most anesthetics don't work that way.

60
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
What they do is they introduce a noise

61
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
into the brain so that the neurons cannot understand each other.

62
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
They are confused,

63
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and you cannot make a decision.

64
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So, while you're trying to make up your mind

65
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
what the doctor, the surgeon, is doing

66
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
while he's hacking away at your body, he's long gone.

67
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
He's at home having tea.

68
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So, when you walk up to a door and you open it,

70
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
what you compulsively have to do to perceive

71
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
is to make decisions,

72
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
thousands of decisions about the size of the room,

73
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
the walls, the height, the objects in this room.

74
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
99 percent of what you see

75
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
is not what comes in through the eyes.

76
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
It is what you infer about that room.

77
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So I can say, with some certainty,

78
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
"I think, therefore I am."

79
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
But I cannot say, "You think, therefore you are,"

80
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
because "you" are within my perceptual bubble.

81
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Now, we can speculate and philosophize this,

82
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
but we don't actually have to for the next hundred years.

83
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
We can ask a very concrete question.

84
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
"Can the brain build such a perception?"

85
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Is it capable of doing it?

86
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Does it have the substance to do it?

87
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And that's what I'm going to describe to you today.

88
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So, it took the universe 11 billion years to build the brain.

89
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
It had to improve it a little bit.

90
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
It had to add to the frontal part, so that you would have instincts,

91
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
because they had to cope on land.

92
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
But the real big step was the neocortex.

93
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
It's a new brain. You needed it.

94
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
The mammals needed it

95
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
because they had to cope with parenthood,

96
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
social interactions,

97
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
complex cognitive functions.

98
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So, you can think of the neocortex

99
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
actually as the ultimate solution today,

100
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
of the universe as we know it.

101
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
It's the pinnacle, it's the final product

102
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
that the universe has produced.

103
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
It was so successful in evolution

104
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that from mouse to man it expanded

105
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
about a thousandfold in terms of the numbers of neurons,

106
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
to produce this almost frightening

107
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
organ, structure.

108
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And it has not stopped its evolutionary path.

109
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
In fact, the neocortex in the human brain

110
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
is evolving at an enormous speed.

111
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
If you zoom into the surface of the neocortex,

112
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
you discover that it's made up of little modules,

113
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
G5 processors, like in a computer.

114
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
But there are about a million of them.

115
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
They were so successful in evolution

116
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
that what we did was to duplicate them

117
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
over and over and add more and more of them to the brain

118
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
until we ran out of space in the skull.

119
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And the brain started to fold in on itself,

120
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and that's why the neocortex is so highly convoluted.

121
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We're just packing in columns,

122
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
so that we'd have more neocortical columns

123
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
to perform more complex functions.

124
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So you can think of the neocortex actually as

125
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
a massive grand piano,

126
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
a million-key grand piano.

127
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Each of these neocortical columns

128
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
would produce a note.

129
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
You stimulate it; it produces a symphony.

130
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
But it's not just a symphony of perception.

131
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
It's a symphony of your universe, your reality.

132
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Now, of course it takes years to learn how

133
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
to master a grand piano with a million keys.

134
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
That's why you have to send your kids to good schools,

135
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
hopefully eventually to Oxford.

136
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
But it's not only education.

137
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
It's also genetics.

138
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
You may be born lucky,

139
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
where you know how to master your neocortical column,

140
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and you can play a fantastic symphony.

141
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
In fact, there is a new theory of autism

142
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
called the "intense world" theory,

143
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
which suggests that the neocortical columns are super-columns.

144
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
They are highly reactive, and they are super-plastic,

145
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and so the autists are probably capable of

146
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
building and learning a symphony

147
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
which is unthinkable for us.

148
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
But you can also understand

149
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
that if you have a disease

150
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
within one of these columns,

151
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
the note is going to be off.

152
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
The perception, the symphony that you create

153
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
is going to be corrupted,

154
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and you will have symptoms of disease.

155
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So, the Holy Grail for neuroscience

156
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
is really to understand the design of the neocoritical column --

157
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and it's not just for neuroscience;

158
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
it's perhaps to understand perception, to understand reality,

159
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and perhaps to even also understand physical reality.

160
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
So, what we did was, for the past 15 years,

161
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
was to dissect out the neocortex, systematically.

162
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
It's a bit like going and cataloging a piece of the rainforest.

163
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
How many trees does it have?

164
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
What shapes are the trees?

165
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
How many of each type of tree do you have? Where are they positioned?

166
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
But it's a bit more than cataloging because you actually have to

167
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
describe and discover all the rules of communication,

168
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
the rules of connectivity,

169
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
because the neurons don't just like to connect with any neuron.

170
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
They choose very carefully who they connect with.

171
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
It's also more than cataloging

172
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
because you actually have to build three-dimensional

173
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
digital models of them.

174
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And we did that for tens of thousands of neurons,

175
0:08:28.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
built digital models of all the different types

176
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
of neurons we came across.

177
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And once you have that, you can actually

178
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:39,000
begin to build the neocortical column.

179
0:08:39.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And here we're coiling them up.

180
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
But as you do this, what you see

181
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
is that the branches intersect

182
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
actually in millions of locations,

183
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and at each of these intersections

184
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
they can form a synapse.

185
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And a synapse is a chemical location

186
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
where they communicate with each other.

187
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And these synapses together

188
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
form the network

189
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
or the circuit of the brain.

190
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Now, the circuit, you could also think of as

191
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
the fabric of the brain.

192
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And when you think of the fabric of the brain,

193
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
the structure, how is it built? What is the pattern of the carpet?

194
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
You realize that this poses

195
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
a fundamental challenge to any theory of the brain,

196
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and especially to a theory that says

197
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
that there is some reality that emerges

198
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
out of this carpet, out of this particular carpet

199
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
with a particular pattern.

200
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
The reason is because the most important design secret of the brain

201
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
is diversity.

202
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Every neuron is different.

203
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
It's the same in the forest. Every pine tree is different.

204
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
You may have many different types of trees,

205
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
but every pine tree is different. And in the brain it's the same.

206
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
So there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as another,

207
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as in yours.

208
0:09:55.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And your neurons are not going to be oriented and positioned

209
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
in exactly the same way.

210
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And you may have more or less neurons.

211
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
So it's very unlikely

212
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
that you got the same fabric, the same circuitry.

213
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
So, how could we possibly create a reality

214
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
that we can even understand each other?

215
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Well, we don't have to speculate.

216
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
We can look at all 10 million synapses now.

217
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
We can look at the fabric. And we can change neurons.

218
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
We can use different neurons with different variations.

219
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
We can position them in different places,

220
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
orient them in different places.

221
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
We can use less or more of them.

222
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And when we do that

223
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
what we discovered is that the circuitry does change.

224
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
But the pattern of how the circuitry is designed does not.

225
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
So, the fabric of the brain,

226
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
even though your brain may be smaller, bigger,

227
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:48,000
it may have different types of neurons,

228
0:10:48.33,000 --> 0:10:5,000
different morphologies of neurons,

229
0:10:50.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
we actually do share

230
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
the same fabric.

231
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And we think this is species-specific,

232
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
which means that that could explain

233
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
why we can't communicate across species.

234
0:11:01.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
So, let's switch it on. But to do it, what you have to do

235
0:11:04.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
is you have to make this come alive.

236
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
We make it come alive

237
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
with equations, a lot of mathematics.

238
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And, in fact, the equations that make neurons into electrical generators

239
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
were discovered by two Cambridge Nobel Laureates.

240
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
So, we have the mathematics to make neurons come alive.

241
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
We also have the mathematics to describe

242
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
how neurons collect information,

243
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and how they create a little lightning bolt

244
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:3,000
to communicate with each other.

245
0:11:30.33,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And when they get to the synapse,

246
0:11:32.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
what they do is they effectively,

247
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
literally, shock the synapse.

248
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
It's like electrical shock

249
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:42,000
that releases the chemicals from these synapses.

250
0:11:42.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And we've got the mathematics to describe this process.

251
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
So we can describe the communication between the neurons.

252
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
There literally are only a handful

253
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:54,000
of equations that you need to simulate

254
0:11:54.33,000 --> 0:11:56,000
the activity of the neocortex.

255
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:11:59,000
But what you do need is a very big computer.

256
0:11:59.33,000 --> 0:12:01,000
And in fact you need one laptop

257
0:12:01.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
to do all the calculations just for one neuron.

258
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
So you need 10,000 laptops.

259
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
So where do you go? You go to IBM,

260
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and you get a supercomputer, because they know how to take

261
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
10,000 laptops and put it into the size of a refrigerator.

262
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:17,000
So now we have this Blue Gene supercomputer.

263
0:12:17.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
We can load up all the neurons,

264
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
each one on to its processor,

265
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and fire it up, and see what happens.

266
0:12:25.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Take the magic carpet for a ride.

267
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Here we activate it. And this gives the first glimpse

268
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
of what is happening in your brain

269
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
when there is a stimulation.

270
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
It's the first view.

271
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Now, when you look at that the first time, you think,

272
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
"My god. How is reality coming out of that?"

273
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:47,000
But, in fact, you can start,

274
0:12:47.33,000 --> 0:12:51,000
even though we haven't trained this neocortical column

275
0:12:51.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
to create a specific reality.

276
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
But we can ask, "Where is the rose?"

277
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
We can ask, "Where is it inside,

278
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:02,000
if we stimulate it with a picture?"

279
0:13:02.33,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Where is it inside the neocortex?

280
0:13:04.33,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Ultimately it's got to be there if we stimulated it with it.

281
0:13:08.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
So, the way that we can look at that

282
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
is to ignore the neurons, ignore the synapses,

283
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and look just at the raw electrical activity.

284
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Because that is what it's creating.

285
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:19,000
It's creating electrical patterns.

286
0:13:19.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
So when we did this,

287
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
we indeed, for the first time,

288
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
saw these ghost-like structures:

289
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
electrical objects appearing

290
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:32,000
within the neocortical column.

291
0:13:32.33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And it's these electrical objects

292
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
that are holding all the information about

293
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:41,000
whatever stimulated it.

294
0:13:41.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
And then when we zoomed into this,

295
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
it's like a veritable universe.

296
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:49,000
So the next step

297
0:13:49.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
is just to take these brain coordinates

298
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and to project them into perceptual space.

299
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And if you do that,

300
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
you will be able to step inside

301
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
the reality that is created

302
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:05,000
by this machine,

303
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:08,000
by this piece of the brain.

304
0:14:08.33,000 --> 0:14:1,000
So, in summary,

305
0:14:10.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
I think that the universe may have --

306
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
it's possible --

307
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
evolved a brain to see itself,

308
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:22,000
which may be a first step in becoming aware of itself.

309
0:14:22.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
There is a lot more to do to test these theories,

310
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and to test any other theories.

311
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
But I hope that you are at least partly convinced

312
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:33,000
that it is not impossible to build a brain.

313
0:14:33.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
We can do it within 10 years,

314
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and if we do succeed,

315
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:39,000
we will send to TED, in 10 years,

316
0:14:39.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
a hologram to talk to you. Thank you.

317
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
(Applause)

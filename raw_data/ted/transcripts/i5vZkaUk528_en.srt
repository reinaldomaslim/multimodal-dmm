1
0:00:13.412,000 --> 0:00:15,000
When I first became a doctor

2
0:00:16.143,000 --> 0:00:18,000
in Benin City, Nigeria,

3
0:00:18.172,000 --> 0:00:2,000
some 30-odd years ago,

4
0:00:21.137,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I was drawn to help people live full lives.

5
0:00:26.068,000 --> 0:00:28,000
But often, I found myself feeling impotent.

6
0:00:29.524,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Here I was, a brand-new doctor with all these skills,

7
0:00:33.414,000 --> 0:00:37,000
but I couldn't cure my patients who had chronic diseases --

8
0:00:37.669,000 --> 0:00:42,000
illnesses like heart disease, asthma, diabetes --

9
0:00:42.932,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and needed more than just handing them a prescription

10
0:00:46.195,000 --> 0:00:49,000
or providing grief counseling in the office to get the job done.

11
0:00:50.51,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Fast-forward 15 years later:

12
0:00:53.198,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I'm in Atlanta, Georgia;

13
0:00:55.089,000 --> 0:00:57,000
it's a different world,

14
0:00:57.21,000 --> 0:00:59,000
but it was déjà vu all over again.

15
0:01:00.062,000 --> 0:01:04,000
As doctors, we see our patients who have chronic illnesses

16
0:01:04.252,000 --> 0:01:06,000
in an episodic way.

17
0:01:06.561,000 --> 0:01:07,000
In between,

18
0:01:07.866,000 --> 0:01:11,000
the patients have to learn how to make a lot of decisions for themselves.

19
0:01:12.437,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I'll give you examples.

20
0:01:14.388,000 --> 0:01:16,000
If you have medications you're supposed to take every day,

21
0:01:17.293,000 --> 0:01:18,000
what do you do when you're sick?

22
0:01:19.303,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Are you still supposed to take it?

23
0:01:21.113,000 --> 0:01:23,000
How do you recognize a complication when it happens?

24
0:01:24.017,000 --> 0:01:26,000
How do you recognize a side effect when it happens?

25
0:01:26.456,000 --> 0:01:27,000
What do you do with it?

26
0:01:27.646,000 --> 0:01:28,000
In addition to all of this,

27
0:01:29.593,000 --> 0:01:34,000
they're dealing with the inevitable loneliness, isolation and anxiety

28
0:01:34.679,000 --> 0:01:37,000
that people who have chronic illnesses deal with.

29
0:01:38.599,000 --> 0:01:43,000
In the US alone, six in 10 adults have a chronic illness.

30
0:01:43.924,000 --> 0:01:46,000
That's 125 million people.

31
0:01:47.83,000 --> 0:01:5,000
A recent report from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

32
0:01:51.544,000 --> 0:01:56,000
showed that health habits account for 50 percent

33
0:01:56.631,000 --> 0:01:58,000
of the health outcomes that people experience,

34
0:01:58.948,000 --> 0:02:01,000
while medical care only accounts for 20 percent.

35
0:02:02.953,000 --> 0:02:05,000
In fact, the Centers for Disease Control

36
0:02:06.512,000 --> 0:02:09,000
says that if we could eliminate smoking,

37
0:02:10.199,000 --> 0:02:13,000
physical inactivity and poor nutrition,

38
0:02:13.577,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that we can prevent 80 percent of heart disease,

39
0:02:16.958,000 --> 0:02:18,000
80 percent of type 2 diabetes

40
0:02:19.288,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and 40 percent of cancer.

41
0:02:22.3,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But we also know

42
0:02:24.346,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that changing health behaviors is very difficult.

43
0:02:28.795,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So we asked the question:

44
0:02:30.211,000 --> 0:02:34,000
What if we could create a resource

45
0:02:34.562,000 --> 0:02:38,000
that could motivate people to change health behavior?

46
0:02:39.745,000 --> 0:02:43,000
The truth is, there are a lot of these resources out there

47
0:02:43.77,000 --> 0:02:47,000
that help people acquire these so-called self-management skills.

48
0:02:48.249,000 --> 0:02:52,000
But many a time, they're not easily accessible or relatable,

49
0:02:52.799,000 --> 0:02:56,000
particularly to individuals within minority and underserved communities,

50
0:02:57.75,000 --> 0:03:02,000
who face bias in addition to barriers like language and culture

51
0:03:02.825,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and inadequate health insurance coverage.

52
0:03:06.428,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And so in the last 12 years,

53
0:03:08.013,000 --> 0:03:1,000
my colleagues and I at Morehouse School of Medicine

54
0:03:10.465,000 --> 0:03:12,000
have created a technology-based application

55
0:03:13.483,000 --> 0:03:15,000
to assist with chronic illness care.

56
0:03:16.171,000 --> 0:03:18,000
It's freely available on the web

57
0:03:18.554,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and as an app.

58
0:03:19.839,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And what we do is get people to track variables --

59
0:03:23.156,000 --> 0:03:24,000
blood pressure, blood sugar --

60
0:03:24.945,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and then report it back to them in a color-coded format.

61
0:03:29.3,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So green would indicate a healthy range,

62
0:03:31.923,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and red would indicate a problem that needs something done about it.

63
0:03:36.11,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We link these stats to a curriculum.

64
0:03:39.836,000 --> 0:03:43,000
The curriculum helps the individual learn about their health condition,

65
0:03:44.095,000 --> 0:03:47,000
whatever the chronic illness is.

66
0:03:47.189,000 --> 0:03:49,000
They also work with a health coach

67
0:03:49.557,000 --> 0:03:51,000
to learn self-management skills,

68
0:03:52.078,000 --> 0:03:55,000
skills that'll help them prevent complications of their illness.

69
0:03:56.552,000 --> 0:03:58,000
In order for the coach to be successful,

70
0:03:59.527,000 --> 0:04:01,000
they have to be able to gain the trust

71
0:04:01.949,000 --> 0:04:03,000
of the individual that they're working with.

72
0:04:04.872,000 --> 0:04:06,000
We tested this application

73
0:04:07.217,000 --> 0:04:11,000
in clinics, where the health coaches were medical assistants,

74
0:04:11.744,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and in a large urban church,

75
0:04:13.847,000 --> 0:04:16,000
where the health coaches were volunteers from the health ministry.

76
0:04:18.694,000 --> 0:04:22,000
A year later, a third of the participants

77
0:04:23.031,000 --> 0:04:25,000
were able to acquire three new self-management skills

78
0:04:25.766,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and maintain them to the extent that it was able to improve

79
0:04:28.956,000 --> 0:04:3,000
their blood pressures, their blood sugar

80
0:04:31.597,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and their exercise.

81
0:04:33.768,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Now, what was simple yet fascinating to us

82
0:04:36.867,000 --> 0:04:42,000
was that the group from the church did just as well or even better

83
0:04:43.083,000 --> 0:04:45,000
than the group that were under purely medical care.

84
0:04:45.988,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And we wanted to learn why that was.

85
0:04:48.749,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So we looked a little further into the research --

86
0:04:51.294,000 --> 0:04:54,000
400 hours of recorded conversation --

87
0:04:54.427,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and what we learned was that the coaches from the church

88
0:04:58.355,000 --> 0:05:01,000
did have more time to spend with the patients,

89
0:05:01.993,000 --> 0:05:03,000
they had access to the patients' families,

90
0:05:04.507,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and so they could figure out what people needed

91
0:05:07.086,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and provide those resources for them.

92
0:05:09.777,000 --> 0:05:12,000
My team and I call this "culturally congruent coaching."

93
0:05:14.253,000 --> 0:05:17,000
To illustrate this concept of culturally congruent coaching,

94
0:05:17.398,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I want to tell you about one of our patients.

95
0:05:19.556,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I'll call her Ms. Bertha.

96
0:05:21.933,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So Ms. Bertha is an 83-year-old lady with diabetes and hypertension.

97
0:05:26.302,000 --> 0:05:29,000
She was assigned to Anne, her health coach in the church.

98
0:05:30.346,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Anne also happened to be a family friend to Ms. Bertha for many years,

99
0:05:34.074,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and they were fellow congregants.

100
0:05:37.394,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Anne observed after the first few visits

101
0:05:40.137,000 --> 0:05:43,000
that even though Ms. Bertha faithfully recorded her stats,

102
0:05:43.655,000 --> 0:05:45,000
they were all showing up as red.

103
0:05:46.043,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So she probed a little deeper

104
0:05:47.728,000 --> 0:05:49,000
to try to understand what was going on with Ms. Bertha,

105
0:05:50.5,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and Ms. Bertha gave her the real-real.

106
0:05:53.248,000 --> 0:05:54,000
(Laughter)

107
0:05:54.879,000 --> 0:05:57,000
She told her that there were times

108
0:05:57.904,000 --> 0:05:59,000
when her medications made her feel weird,

109
0:06:00.415,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and she wouldn't take them the way they were prescribed,

110
0:06:03.092,000 --> 0:06:05,000
because she thought it was due to the medicines

111
0:06:05.38,000 --> 0:06:06,000
but she didn't tell her doctor that.

112
0:06:07.377,000 --> 0:06:09,000
She also skipped out on some doctor appointments

113
0:06:09.871,000 --> 0:06:1,000
for a variety of reasons,

114
0:06:11.092,000 --> 0:06:13,000
but one of them was she wasn't doing better

115
0:06:13.164,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and she didn't want to make her doctor mad,

116
0:06:15.27,000 --> 0:06:16,000
so she just didn't go.

117
0:06:17.102,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So Anne talked to Ms. Bertha

118
0:06:20.407,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and asked her to bring her daughter in for the next visit, which she did.

119
0:06:23.89,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And at that visit,

120
0:06:25.827,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Anne was able to print out a log of all these stats

121
0:06:28.874,000 --> 0:06:3,000
that Ms. Bertha had been collecting,

122
0:06:31.281,000 --> 0:06:34,000
gave them to her and encouraged them to go see the doctor together,

123
0:06:34.545,000 --> 0:06:35,000
which they did.

124
0:06:35.822,000 --> 0:06:36,000
With that information,

125
0:06:37.022,000 --> 0:06:4,000
the doctor was able to make changes to Ms. Bertha's treatment.

126
0:06:40.574,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Within three months, Ms. Bertha's numbers were all in the green.

127
0:06:44.414,000 --> 0:06:49,000
No one was more excited or surprised than Ms. Bertha herself.

128
0:06:49.502,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Now, Anne was successful as a health coach

129
0:06:52.374,000 --> 0:06:55,000
because she cared enough to go below the surface

130
0:06:55.952,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and probe Ms. Bertha's deep culture

131
0:06:58.577,000 --> 0:07:,000
and was able to reach her at that level.

132
0:07:00.891,000 --> 0:07:01,000
She knew how to listen,

133
0:07:02.322,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and she knew how to ask the right questions

134
0:07:04.367,000 --> 0:07:05,000
to get to what was needed.

135
0:07:06.333,000 --> 0:07:09,000
We all have deep unconscious rules

136
0:07:09.687,000 --> 0:07:12,000
that drive the way we make our health decisions.

137
0:07:12.727,000 --> 0:07:13,000
That's our culture.

138
0:07:14.575,000 --> 0:07:17,000
The relationship and the conversation between Anne and Ms. Bertha

139
0:07:17.927,000 --> 0:07:19,000
illustrates what's possible

140
0:07:20.684,000 --> 0:07:23,000
when we have conversations with our patients,

141
0:07:24.363,000 --> 0:07:26,000
our friends and our neighbors

142
0:07:26.42,000 --> 0:07:27,000
on a deep cultural level.

143
0:07:27.844,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And personally, I'm beyond excited

144
0:07:30.017,000 --> 0:07:34,000
to think that with this simple concept of culturally congruent coaching,

145
0:07:34.322,000 --> 0:07:37,000
we could change the lives of 125 million Americans

146
0:07:37.899,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and many others across the world

147
0:07:39.49,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that are living with chronic diseases.

148
0:07:41.955,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Thank you.

149
0:07:43.147,000 --> 0:07:47,000
(Applause)

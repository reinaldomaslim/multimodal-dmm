2
0:00:15.396,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I've got a great idea that's going to change the world.

3
0:00:18.04,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It's fantastic, it's going to blow your mind.

4
0:00:20.458,000 --> 0:00:21,000
It's my beautiful baby.

5
0:00:21.883,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Here's the thing: everybody loves a beautiful baby.

6
0:00:24.336,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I mean, I was a beautiful baby.

7
0:00:26.301,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Here's me and my dad a couple days after I was born.

8
0:00:28.801,000 --> 0:00:29,000
So in the world of product design,

9
0:00:30.464,000 --> 0:00:32,000
the beautiful baby's like the concept car.

10
0:00:32.856,000 --> 0:00:33,000
It's the knockout.

11
0:00:34.766,000 --> 0:00:37,000
You see it and you go, "Oh, my God. I'd buy that in a second!"

12
0:00:37.929,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So why is it that this year's new cars

13
0:00:40.324,000 --> 0:00:43,000
look pretty much exactly like last year's new cars?

14
0:00:43.612,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:45.408,000 --> 0:00:47,000
What went wrong between the design studio and the factory?

16
0:00:48.25,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Today, I don't want to talk about beautiful babies,

17
0:00:50.678,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I want to talk about the awkward adolescence of design --

18
0:00:53.443,000 --> 0:00:57,000
those sort of dorky teenage years

19
0:00:58.045,000 --> 0:01:,000
where you're trying to figure out how the world works.

20
0:01:01.567,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I'm going to start with an example

21
0:01:03.226,000 --> 0:01:05,000
from some work that we did on newborn health.

22
0:01:05.678,000 --> 0:01:06,000
So here's a problem:

23
0:01:07.334,000 --> 0:01:11,000
four million babies around the world, mostly in developing countries,

24
0:01:11.373,000 --> 0:01:13,000
die every year before their first birthday,

25
0:01:13.758,000 --> 0:01:14,000
even before their first month of life.

26
0:01:15.61,000 --> 0:01:16,000
It turns out half of those kids,

27
0:01:17.294,000 --> 0:01:19,000
or about 1.8 million newborns around the world,

28
0:01:19.532,000 --> 0:01:21,000
would make it if you could just keep them warm

29
0:01:22.444,000 --> 0:01:24,000
for the first three days, maybe the first week.

30
0:01:25.19,000 --> 0:01:28,000
So this is a newborn intensive care unit in Kathmandu, Nepal.

31
0:01:28.915,000 --> 0:01:3,000
All of these kids in blankets belong in incubators --

32
0:01:31.648,000 --> 0:01:32,000
something like this.

33
0:01:33.321,000 --> 0:01:35,000
This is a donated Japanese Atom incubator

34
0:01:36.141,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that we found in a NICU in Kathmandu.

35
0:01:39.385,000 --> 0:01:4,000
This is what we want.

36
0:01:40.575,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Probably what happened is a hospital in Japan upgraded their equipment

37
0:01:43.933,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and donated their old stuff to Nepal.

38
0:01:47.386,000 --> 0:01:5,000
The problem is, without technicians, without spare parts,

39
0:01:50.475,000 --> 0:01:53,000
donations like this very quickly turn into junk.

40
0:01:54.513,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So this seemed like a problem that we could do something about.

41
0:01:58.218,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Keeping a baby warm for a week -- that's not rocket science.

42
0:02:02.016,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So we got started.

43
0:02:03.423,000 --> 0:02:06,000
We partnered with a leading medical research institution here in Boston.

44
0:02:07.318,000 --> 0:02:09,000
We conducted months of user research overseas,

45
0:02:10.258,000 --> 0:02:12,000
trying to think like designers, human-centered design --

46
0:02:12.988,000 --> 0:02:14,000
"Let's figure out what people want."

47
0:02:15.835,000 --> 0:02:17,000
We killed thousands of Post-it notes.

48
0:02:17.952,000 --> 0:02:2,000
We made dozens of prototypes to get to this.

49
0:02:21.399,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So this is the NeoNurture infant incubator,

50
0:02:24.391,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and this has a lot of smarts built into it, and we felt great.

51
0:02:28.089,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So the idea here is, unlike the concept car,

52
0:02:30.427,000 --> 0:02:31,000
we want to marry something beautiful

53
0:02:32.305,000 --> 0:02:34,000
with something that actually works.

54
0:02:34.808,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And our idea is that this design

55
0:02:36.919,000 --> 0:02:39,000
would inspire manufacturers and other people of influence

56
0:02:40.406,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to take this model and run with it.

57
0:02:43.776,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Here's the bad news:

58
0:02:46.457,000 --> 0:02:49,000
the only baby ever actually put inside the NeoNurture incubator

59
0:02:50.455,000 --> 0:02:53,000
was this kid during a Time magazine photo shoot.

60
0:02:54.328,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So recognition is fantastic.

61
0:02:56.555,000 --> 0:02:58,000
We want design to get out for people to see it.

62
0:02:59.254,000 --> 0:03:,000
It won lots of awards.

63
0:03:01.144,000 --> 0:03:03,000
But it felt like a booby prize.

64
0:03:04.166,000 --> 0:03:05,000
We wanted to make beautiful things

65
0:03:05.89,000 --> 0:03:08,000
that are going to make the world a better place,

66
0:03:09.051,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and I don't think this kid was even in it long enough to get warm.

67
0:03:12.729,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So it turns out that design for inspiration doesn't really ...

68
0:03:18.46,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I guess what I would say is, for us, for what I want to do,

69
0:03:22.01,000 --> 0:03:25,000
it's either too slow or it just doesn't work, it's ineffective.

70
0:03:25.444,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So, really, I want to design for outcomes.

71
0:03:28.505,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I don't want to make beautiful stuff; I want to make the world a better place.

72
0:03:32.225,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So when we were designing NeoNurture,

73
0:03:34.034,000 --> 0:03:37,000
we paid a lot of attention to the people who are going to use this thing,

74
0:03:37.499,000 --> 0:03:39,000
for example, poor families, rural doctors,

75
0:03:40.126,000 --> 0:03:43,000
overloaded nurses, even repair technicians.

76
0:03:43.306,000 --> 0:03:46,000
We thought we had all our bases covered, we'd done everything right.

77
0:03:46.542,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Well, it turns out there's this whole constellation of people

78
0:03:49.432,000 --> 0:03:51,000
who have to be involved in a product for it to be successful:

79
0:03:52.319,000 --> 0:03:54,000
manufacturing, financing, distribution, regulation.

80
0:03:55.033,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Michael Free at PATH says you have to figure out

81
0:03:57.31,000 --> 0:03:59,000
who will "choose, use and pay the dues"

82
0:03:59.968,000 --> 0:04:,000
for a product like this.

83
0:04:01.282,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And I have to ask the question that VCs always ask:

84
0:04:03.75,000 --> 0:04:05,000
"Sir, what is your business, and who is your customer?"

85
0:04:06.624,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Who is our customer?

86
0:04:08.389,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Well, here's an example.

87
0:04:09.581,000 --> 0:04:12,000
This is a Bangladeshi hospital director outside his facility.

88
0:04:12.876,000 --> 0:04:14,000
It turns out he doesn't buy any of his equipment.

89
0:04:15.737,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Those decisions are made by the Ministry of Health

90
0:04:18.527,000 --> 0:04:19,000
or by foreign donors,

91
0:04:19.875,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and it just kind of shows up.

92
0:04:21.599,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Similarly, here's a multinational medical-device manufacturer.

93
0:04:25.114,000 --> 0:04:27,000
It turns out they've got to fish where the fish are.

94
0:04:28.048,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So it turns out that in emerging markets -- where the fish are --

95
0:04:31.409,000 --> 0:04:34,000
are the emerging middle class of these countries --

96
0:04:34.528,000 --> 0:04:37,000
diseases of affluence: heart disease, infertility.

97
0:04:38.006,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So it turns out that design for outcomes in one aspect

98
0:04:42.508,000 --> 0:04:45,000
really means thinking about design for manufacture and distribution.

99
0:04:46.056,000 --> 0:04:47,000
OK, that was an important lesson.

100
0:04:48.267,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Second, we took that lesson and tried to push it into our next project.

101
0:04:52.457,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So we started by finding a manufacturer,

102
0:04:54.99,000 --> 0:04:56,000
an organization called MTTS in Vietnam,

103
0:04:57.312,000 --> 0:05:,000
that manufactures newborn-care technologies for Southeast Asia.

104
0:05:00.734,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Our other partner is East Meets West,

105
0:05:02.642,000 --> 0:05:04,000
an American foundation that distributes that technology

106
0:05:05.292,000 --> 0:05:07,000
to poor hospitals around that region.

107
0:05:07.966,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So we started with them, saying, "Well, what do you want?

108
0:05:10.673,000 --> 0:05:11,000
What's a problem you want to solve?"

109
0:05:12.426,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And they said, "Let's work on newborn jaundice."

110
0:05:14.955,000 --> 0:05:18,000
So this is another one of these mind-boggling global problems.

111
0:05:19.041,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Jaundice affects two-thirds of newborns around the world.

112
0:05:22.804,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Of those newborns, one in 10 roughly,

113
0:05:27.352,000 --> 0:05:29,000
if it's not treated, the jaundice gets so severe

114
0:05:29.856,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that it leads to either a life-long disability,

115
0:05:32.553,000 --> 0:05:34,000
or the kids could even die.

116
0:05:35.59,000 --> 0:05:36,000
There's one way to treat jaundice,

117
0:05:37.333,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and that's what's called an exchange transfusion.

118
0:05:39.897,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So as you can imagine, that's expensive and a little bit dangerous.

119
0:05:43.765,000 --> 0:05:44,000
There is another cure.

120
0:05:45.574,000 --> 0:05:5,000
It's very technological, it's very complex, a little daunting.

121
0:05:51.241,000 --> 0:05:53,000
You've got to shine blue light on the kid.

122
0:05:53.487,000 --> 0:05:54,000
(Laughter)

123
0:05:54.573,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Bright blue light on as much of the skin as you can cover.

124
0:05:58.048,000 --> 0:05:59,000
How is this a hard problem?

125
0:05:59.953,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I went to MIT. OK, we'll figure that out.

126
0:06:05.618,000 --> 0:06:06,000
(Laughter)

127
0:06:07.078,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So here's an example.

128
0:06:08.269,000 --> 0:06:12,000
This is an overhead phototherapy device that's designed for American hospitals,

129
0:06:12.801,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and here's how it's supposed to be used.

130
0:06:14.803,000 --> 0:06:17,000
It's over the baby, illuminating a single patient.

131
0:06:19.426,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Take it out of an American hospital,

132
0:06:21.189,000 --> 0:06:23,000
send it overseas to a crowded facility in Asia,

133
0:06:23.422,000 --> 0:06:24,000
here's how it's actually used.

134
0:06:24.898,000 --> 0:06:27,000
The effectiveness of phototherapy is a function of light intensity.

135
0:06:28.145,000 --> 0:06:31,000
These dark blue squares show you where it's effective phototherapy.

136
0:06:31.576,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Here's what it looks like under actual use.

137
0:06:33.631,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So those kids on the edges aren't actually receiving effective phototherapy.

138
0:06:37.336,000 --> 0:06:4,000
But without training, without some kind of light meter,

139
0:06:40.786,000 --> 0:06:41,000
how would you know?

140
0:06:42.596,000 --> 0:06:44,000
We see other examples of problems like this.

141
0:06:44.681,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Here's a neonatal intensive care unit,

142
0:06:46.527,000 --> 0:06:47,000
where moms come in to visit their babies.

143
0:06:48.513,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And keep in mind that Mom maybe just had a C-section,

144
0:06:51.032,000 --> 0:06:52,000
so that's already kind of a bummer.

145
0:06:52.922,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Mom's visiting her kid.

146
0:06:54.319,000 --> 0:06:57,000
She sees her baby naked, lying under some blue lights,

147
0:06:57.478,000 --> 0:06:59,000
looking kind of vulnerable.

148
0:06:59.617,000 --> 0:07:02,000
It's not uncommon for Mom to put a blanket over the baby.

149
0:07:03.474,000 --> 0:07:06,000
From a phototherapy standpoint, maybe not the best behavior.

150
0:07:07.372,000 --> 0:07:08,000
In fact, that sounds kind of dumb.

151
0:07:09.27,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Except, what we've learned is that there's no such thing as a dumb user --

152
0:07:14.084,000 --> 0:07:16,000
there are only dumb products.

153
0:07:16.77,000 --> 0:07:17,000
We have to think like existentialists:

154
0:07:18.632,000 --> 0:07:2,000
it's not the painting we would have painted,

155
0:07:20.72,000 --> 0:07:22,000
it's the painting that we actually painted.

156
0:07:22.759,000 --> 0:07:24,000
It's the use -- designed for actual use.

157
0:07:25.293,000 --> 0:07:27,000
How are people actually going to use this?

158
0:07:27.737,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So, similarly, when we think about our partner MTTS,

159
0:07:30.841,000 --> 0:07:33,000
they've made some amazing technologies for treating newborn illnesses.

160
0:07:34.293,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So here's an overhead warmer and a CPAP.

161
0:07:36.626,000 --> 0:07:38,000
They're inexpensive, really rugged.

162
0:07:39.395,000 --> 0:07:41,000
They've treated 50,000 kids in Vietnam with this technology.

163
0:07:42.256,000 --> 0:07:43,000
But here's the problem:

164
0:07:43.637,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Every doctor in the world, every hospital administrator,

165
0:07:46.464,000 --> 0:07:51,000
has seen TV -- curse those "ER" reruns!

166
0:07:51.74,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Turns out they all know what a medical device is supposed to look like.

167
0:07:55.897,000 --> 0:07:58,000
They want Buck Rogers, they don't want effective.

168
0:07:59.309,000 --> 0:08:,000
It sounds crazy, it sounds dumb,

169
0:08:01.091,000 --> 0:08:04,000
but there are actually hospitals who would rather have no equipment

170
0:08:04.282,000 --> 0:08:06,000
than something that looks cheap and crummy.

171
0:08:06.362,000 --> 0:08:09,000
So again, if we want people to trust a device,

172
0:08:09.68,000 --> 0:08:1,000
it has to look trustworthy.

173
0:08:11.112,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So thinking about outcomes,

174
0:08:12.627,000 --> 0:08:14,000
it turns out appearances matter.

175
0:08:15.028,000 --> 0:08:17,000
We took all that information together.

176
0:08:17.559,000 --> 0:08:19,000
We tried, this time, to get it right.

177
0:08:19.914,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And here's what we developed.

178
0:08:21.326,000 --> 0:08:22,000
This is the Firefly phototherapy device,

179
0:08:23.286,000 --> 0:08:25,000
except this time, we didn't stop at the concept car.

180
0:08:26.947,000 --> 0:08:29,000
From the very beginning, we started by talking to manufacturers.

181
0:08:30.225,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Our goal is to make a state-of-the-art product

182
0:08:33.393,000 --> 0:08:35,000
that our partner MTTS can actually manufacture.

183
0:08:36.099,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Our goal is to study how they work, the resources they have access to,

184
0:08:40.21,000 --> 0:08:42,000
so that they can make this product.

185
0:08:42.765,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So that's the design for manufacture question.

186
0:08:45.28,000 --> 0:08:46,000
When we think about actual use,

187
0:08:47.139,000 --> 0:08:49,000
you'll notice that Firefly has a single bassinet.

188
0:08:49.472,000 --> 0:08:5,000
It only fits a single baby,

189
0:08:51.369,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and the idea here is it's obvious how you ought to use this device.

190
0:08:55.427,000 --> 0:08:56,000
If you try to put more than one kid in,

191
0:08:57.324,000 --> 0:08:59,000
you're stacking them on top of each other.

192
0:08:59.377,000 --> 0:09:,000
(Laughter)

193
0:09:01.033,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So the idea here is you want to make it hard to use wrong.

194
0:09:03.828,000 --> 0:09:05,000
In other words, you want to make the right way to use it

195
0:09:06.519,000 --> 0:09:07,000
the easiest way to use it.

196
0:09:08.481,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Another example -- again, silly Mom.

197
0:09:11.517,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Silly Mom thinks her baby looks cold, wants to put a blanket over the baby.

198
0:09:15.094,000 --> 0:09:17,000
That's why we have lights above and below the baby in Firefly,

199
0:09:18.04,000 --> 0:09:2,000
so if Mom does put a blanket over the baby,

200
0:09:20.101,000 --> 0:09:22,000
it's still receiving effective phototherapy from below.

201
0:09:23.896,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Last story here:

202
0:09:25.238,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I've got a friend in India who told me

203
0:09:27.157,000 --> 0:09:29,000
that you haven't really tested a piece of electronic technology

204
0:09:30.162,000 --> 0:09:32,000
for distribution in Asia,

205
0:09:32.228,000 --> 0:09:34,000
until you've trained a cockroach to climb in and pee

206
0:09:34.697,000 --> 0:09:36,000
on every single little component on the inside.

207
0:09:37.173,000 --> 0:09:38,000
(Laughter)

208
0:09:38.981,000 --> 0:09:39,000
You think it's funny.

209
0:09:40.364,000 --> 0:09:42,000
I had a laptop in the Peace Corps,

210
0:09:42.602,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and the screen had all these dead pixels on it.

211
0:09:44.83,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And one day I looked in -- they were all dead ants

212
0:09:47.639,000 --> 0:09:49,000
that had gotten into my laptop and perished.

213
0:09:49.727,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Those poor ants.

214
0:09:50.902,000 --> 0:09:51,000
(Laughter)

215
0:09:52.466,000 --> 0:09:55,000
So with Firefly, what we did is -- the problem is electronics get hot,

216
0:09:56.054,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and you have to put in vents or fans to keep them cool --

217
0:09:58.8,000 --> 0:09:59,000
in most products.

218
0:10:00.068,000 --> 0:10:04,000
We decided we can't put a "Do not enter" sign next to the vent.

219
0:10:04.877,000 --> 0:10:05,000
We actually got rid of all that stuff.

220
0:10:06.9,000 --> 0:10:07,000
So Firefly's totally sealed.

221
0:10:08.625,000 --> 0:10:09,000
These are the kinds of lessons --

222
0:10:10.241,000 --> 0:10:12,000
as awkward as it was to be a pretty goofy teenager,

223
0:10:12.901,000 --> 0:10:13,000
much worse to be a frustrated designer.

224
0:10:14.908,000 --> 0:10:17,000
So I was thinking, "What I really want to do is change the world.

225
0:10:18.042,000 --> 0:10:2,000
I have to pay attention to manufacturing and distribution.

226
0:10:20.809,000 --> 0:10:23,000
I have to pay attention to how people are actually going to use a device.

227
0:10:24.824,000 --> 0:10:27,000
I actually have to pay attention. There's no excuse for failure.

228
0:10:27.864,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I have to think like an existentialist.

229
0:10:29.762,000 --> 0:10:32,000
I have to accept that there are no dumb users, only dumb products."

230
0:10:33.026,000 --> 0:10:35,000
We have to ask ourselves hard questions.

231
0:10:35.42,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Are we designing for the world that we want?

232
0:10:38.5,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Are we designing for the world that we have?

233
0:10:41.166,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Are we designing for the world that's coming,

234
0:10:43.304,000 --> 0:10:44,000
whether we're ready or not?

235
0:10:44.622,000 --> 0:10:47,000
I got into this business designing products.

236
0:10:48.022,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I've since learned that if you really want to make a difference in the world,

237
0:10:51.709,000 --> 0:10:52,000
you have to design outcomes.

238
0:10:53.496,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And that's design that matters.

239
0:10:55.061,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Thank you.

240
0:10:56.237,000 --> 0:10:59,000
(Applause)

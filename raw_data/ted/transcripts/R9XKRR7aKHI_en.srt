1
0:00:12.894,000 --> 0:00:13,000
So on the surface,

2
0:00:14.846,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Troy is the kind of millennial that think pieces are made of.

3
0:00:18.187,000 --> 0:00:2,000
He's arrogant, self-centered

4
0:00:20.449,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and convinced that he is smarter than people give him credit for.

5
0:00:23.562,000 --> 0:00:27,000
His favorite topics of conversation are girls, sneakers and cars --

6
0:00:28.389,000 --> 0:00:31,000
not a surprise for someone who was a teenager just a few years ago.

7
0:00:32.34,000 --> 0:00:33,000
But Troy's mannerisms --

8
0:00:34.042,000 --> 0:00:37,000
they reveal the patterns of someone who is scared,

9
0:00:37.924,000 --> 0:00:39,000
troubled and unsure of the future.

10
0:00:40.617,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Now Troy also embodies the many positive qualities

11
0:00:44.951,000 --> 0:00:45,000
his generation is known for.

12
0:00:46.812,000 --> 0:00:47,000
An entrepreneurial spirit,

13
0:00:48.546,000 --> 0:00:49,000
an independent streak

14
0:00:50.017,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and a dedication to his parents.

15
0:00:52.173,000 --> 0:00:53,000
He believes in hard work

16
0:00:53.653,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and has tried gigs in both the licit and underground economies,

17
0:00:58.097,000 --> 0:00:59,000
but he hasn't had any luck

18
0:00:59.492,000 --> 0:01:,000
and is just trying to find his way

19
0:01:01.279,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and still dances between both worlds.

20
0:01:04.055,000 --> 0:01:06,000
When I met Troy a few years ago,

21
0:01:06.603,000 --> 0:01:08,000
he had been employed as a golf caddy at a local country club,

22
0:01:09.525,000 --> 0:01:11,000
carrying bags for rich men and women

23
0:01:11.872,000 --> 0:01:13,000
who often never even acknowledged his existence.

24
0:01:14.719,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Before that, he sold sneakers on Facebook.

25
0:01:17.571,000 --> 0:01:2,000
He even tried selling candy bars and water bottles,

26
0:01:21.124,000 --> 0:01:24,000
but he wasn't making enough money to help his parents out

27
0:01:24.577,000 --> 0:01:26,000
or save up for a car any time soon.

28
0:01:27.57,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So Troy saw how hard his immigrant mother from Jamaica worked

29
0:01:31.701,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and how little she got back in return,

30
0:01:33.972,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and he vowed --

31
0:01:35.23,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Troy vowed to take a different path.

32
0:01:37.038,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So he ended up selling drugs.

33
0:01:38.715,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And then he got caught,

34
0:01:39.938,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and right now, he's trying to figure out his next steps.

35
0:01:43.533,000 --> 0:01:45,000
In a country where money equals power,

36
0:01:46.448,000 --> 0:01:5,000
quick money, at least for a while, gives young men and women like him

37
0:01:51.166,000 --> 0:01:53,000
a sense of control over their lives,

38
0:01:53.646,000 --> 0:01:56,000
though he said he mainly did it because he wanted stability.

39
0:01:57.31,000 --> 0:01:58,000
"I wanted a good life," he told me.

40
0:01:59.202,000 --> 0:02:01,000
"I got greedy and I got caught."

41
0:02:01.439,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Yet the amazing thing about Troy

42
0:02:04.166,000 --> 0:02:06,000
is that he still believes in the American dream.

43
0:02:06.781,000 --> 0:02:08,000
He still believes that with hard work,

44
0:02:08.946,000 --> 0:02:09,000
despite being arrested,

45
0:02:10.659,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that he can move on up.

46
0:02:13.287,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Now, I don't know if Troy's dreams came true.

47
0:02:16.947,000 --> 0:02:19,000
He disappeared from the program for troubled youth that he was involved in

48
0:02:20.585,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and slipped through the cracks,

49
0:02:22.273,000 --> 0:02:23,000
but on that day that we spoke,

50
0:02:24.072,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I could tell that more than anything,

51
0:02:26.964,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Troy was happy that someone listened to his dreams

52
0:02:30.104,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and asked him about his future.

53
0:02:32.839,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So I think about Troy and his optimism

54
0:02:35.326,000 --> 0:02:39,000
when I think of the reality that so many young, black millennials face

55
0:02:39.609,000 --> 0:02:41,000
when it comes to realizing their dreams.

56
0:02:41.796,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I think about all the challenges

57
0:02:43.399,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that so many black millennials have to endure

58
0:02:46.409,000 --> 0:02:49,000
in a world that tells them they can anything they want to be

59
0:02:49.906,000 --> 0:02:5,000
if they work hard,

60
0:02:51.14,000 --> 0:02:53,000
but actually doesn't sit down to listen to their dreams

61
0:02:54.025,000 --> 0:02:56,000
or hear stories about their struggle.

62
0:02:56.571,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And we really need to listen to this generation

63
0:02:59.824,000 --> 0:03:02,000
if we hope to have a healthy and civil society going forward,

64
0:03:03.263,000 --> 0:03:04,000
because millienials of color,

65
0:03:05.157,000 --> 0:03:1,000
they make up a fair chunk of the US and the world population.

66
0:03:11.133,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Now when we talk about millennials,

67
0:03:12.832,000 --> 0:03:15,000
a group that is often labeled as entitled, lazy, overeducated,

68
0:03:16.836,000 --> 0:03:17,000
noncommittal and narcissistic,

69
0:03:18.848,000 --> 0:03:2,000
the conversations often swirl around avocado toast,

70
0:03:21.579,000 --> 0:03:23,000
overpriced lattes and fancy jobs abroad --

71
0:03:24.246,000 --> 0:03:26,000
you probably have heard all these things before.

72
0:03:26.531,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But millennials are not a monolith.

73
0:03:28.891,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Actress Lena Dunham may be the media's representation

74
0:03:33.008,000 --> 0:03:34,000
of this generation,

75
0:03:34.468,000 --> 0:03:38,000
but Troy and other voices like his are also part of the story.

76
0:03:38.882,000 --> 0:03:42,000
In fact, millennials are the largest and most diverse adult population

77
0:03:43.644,000 --> 0:03:44,000
in this country.

78
0:03:44.91,000 --> 0:03:47,000
44 percent of all American millennials are nonwhite,

79
0:03:48.882,000 --> 0:03:5,000
but often, you wouldn't even know it at all.

80
0:03:51.638,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Now sure, there are similarities within this population

81
0:03:54.701,000 --> 0:03:56,000
born between 1981 and 1996.

82
0:03:57.914,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Perhaps many of us do love avocado toast and lattes --

83
0:04:00.9,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I know I do, right?

84
0:04:02.712,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But there are also extreme differences,

85
0:04:05.55,000 --> 0:04:08,000
often between millennials of color and white millennials.

86
0:04:09.106,000 --> 0:04:1,000
In fact, all too often,

87
0:04:10.934,000 --> 0:04:13,000
it seems as though we're virtually living in different worlds.

88
0:04:14.613,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Now black millennials,

89
0:04:15.788,000 --> 0:04:18,000
a group that I have researched for a book I recently wrote,

90
0:04:19.747,000 --> 0:04:22,000
are the perfect example of the blind spot that we have

91
0:04:22.924,000 --> 0:04:23,000
when it comes to this group.

92
0:04:24.725,000 --> 0:04:25,000
For example,

93
0:04:26.479,000 --> 0:04:28,000
we have lower rates of homeownership,

94
0:04:29.651,000 --> 0:04:3,000
we have higher student debt,

95
0:04:31.933,000 --> 0:04:34,000
we get ID'd more at voter registration booths,

96
0:04:35.629,000 --> 0:04:37,000
we are incarcerated at higher rates ...

97
0:04:39.557,000 --> 0:04:4,000
we make less money,

98
0:04:42.183,000 --> 0:04:44,000
we have higher numbers of unemployment --

99
0:04:45.075,000 --> 0:04:47,000
even when we do go to college, I should say --

100
0:04:47.504,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and we get married at lower rates.

101
0:04:49.725,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And honestly, that's really just the beginning.

102
0:04:52.671,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Now, none of these struggles are particularly new, right?

103
0:04:55.362,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Young black people in America have been fighting,

104
0:04:58.467,000 --> 0:05:,000
really fighting hard to get their stories told for centuries.

105
0:05:01.864,000 --> 0:05:03,000
After the Civil War in the 1800s,

106
0:05:04.459,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Reconstruction failed to deliver the equality

107
0:05:07.296,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that the end of slavery should have heralded,

108
0:05:09.416,000 --> 0:05:11,000
so young people moved to the North and the West

109
0:05:12.026,000 --> 0:05:14,000
to escape discriminatory Jim Crow policies.

110
0:05:14.8,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Then, as segregation raged in much of the country,

111
0:05:18.131,000 --> 0:05:2,000
young black people helped spearhead civil rights campaigns

112
0:05:20.904,000 --> 0:05:22,000
in the 1950s and 1960s.

113
0:05:23.117,000 --> 0:05:27,000
After that, some people embraced black power and then became Black Panthers

114
0:05:27.927,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and then the next generation,

115
0:05:29.335,000 --> 0:05:31,000
they turned to hip-hop to make sure their voices were heard.

116
0:05:32.233,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And then Barack Obama,

117
0:05:33.437,000 --> 0:05:35,000
hopeful that he, too, may bring about change.

118
0:05:35.751,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And when that failed,

119
0:05:37.239,000 --> 0:05:39,000
when we realized we were still brutalized and battered,

120
0:05:40.005,000 --> 0:05:43,000
we had to let the world know that our lives still mattered.

121
0:05:43.95,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Now, when technology allows more video of our pain and struggle

122
0:05:49.797,000 --> 0:05:5,000
to be broadcast to the world,

123
0:05:51.642,000 --> 0:05:53,000
we wonder, like, what is next?

124
0:05:54.134,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Our country feels more polarized than ever,

125
0:05:57.208,000 --> 0:06:,000
yet we are still being told to pull up our pants,

126
0:06:00.567,000 --> 0:06:02,000
be respectable, be less angry,

127
0:06:03.085,000 --> 0:06:05,000
smile more and work harder.

128
0:06:05.567,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Even the attitudes of millennials themselves are overdue for an update.

129
0:06:10.754,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Research done by the Washington Post in 2015 about this supposedly "woke" group

130
0:06:16.973,000 --> 0:06:21,000
found that 31 percent of white millennials think that blacks are lazier than whites,

131
0:06:22.41,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and 23 percent say they're not as intelligent.

132
0:06:26.295,000 --> 0:06:28,000
These are, like, surprising things to me, and shocking.

133
0:06:29.102,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And these responses are not that much different

134
0:06:31.355,000 --> 0:06:32,000
than generations in the past,

135
0:06:32.832,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and it shows that unfortunately,

136
0:06:34.478,000 --> 0:06:37,000
this generation is repeating the same old stereotypes

137
0:06:38.285,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and tropes of the past.

138
0:06:39.891,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Now, a study conducted by David Binder Research and MTV in 2014 --

139
0:06:44.67,000 --> 0:06:48,000
it found that 84 percent of young millennials were taught by their families

140
0:06:49.149,000 --> 0:06:5,000
that everyone should be equal.

141
0:06:50.808,000 --> 0:06:53,000
This is a really great thing, a really positive step.

142
0:06:53.908,000 --> 0:06:55,000
But only 37 percent in that group

143
0:06:56.469,000 --> 0:06:58,000
actually talked about race with their families.

144
0:06:59.176,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So I could understand why things may be confusing to some.

145
0:07:02.595,000 --> 0:07:05,000
There are definitely black millennials who are succeeding.

146
0:07:05.62,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Marvel's "Black Panther,"

147
0:07:07.49,000 --> 0:07:1,000
directed by black millennial Ryan Coogler and showcasing many others,

148
0:07:11.46,000 --> 0:07:12,000
broke all sorts of records.

149
0:07:13.048,000 --> 0:07:16,000
There's a crop of television shows by creatives like Donald Glover,

150
0:07:16.717,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Lena Waithe and Issa Rae.

151
0:07:18.535,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Beyoncé is, like, the queen, right?

152
0:07:20.282,000 --> 0:07:21,000
She is, like, everything.

153
0:07:22.352,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Young black authors are winning awards,

154
0:07:24.331,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Serena Williams is still dominating on the tennis court

155
0:07:27.722,000 --> 0:07:28,000
despite all her haters,

156
0:07:29.302,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and there's a crop of new politicians and activists running for office.

157
0:07:33.381,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So I don't want to, like, kill these moments of black joy

158
0:07:36.222,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that I too revel in,

159
0:07:38.131,000 --> 0:07:39,000
but I want to make it clear

160
0:07:39.734,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that these wins are too few and far between

161
0:07:42.885,000 --> 0:07:44,000
for a people that's been here for over 400 years.

162
0:07:45.565,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Like, that's insane, right?

163
0:07:47.201,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And most people still don't really understand the full picture, right?

164
0:07:51.311,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Our stories are still misunderstood,

165
0:07:53.574,000 --> 0:07:55,000
our bodies are still taken advantage of,

166
0:07:55.605,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and our voices?

167
0:07:56.78,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Our voices are silenced

168
0:07:58.248,000 --> 0:08:01,000
in a world that still shows little concern for our everyday struggles.

169
0:08:02.541,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So our stories need to be told

170
0:08:04.463,000 --> 0:08:05,000
in a multitude of ways

171
0:08:06.318,000 --> 0:08:07,000
by a range of voices

172
0:08:07.835,000 --> 0:08:09,000
talking about diverse and nuanced topics,

173
0:08:10.365,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and they really need to be listened to.

174
0:08:12.257,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And it is not just here in America, right?

175
0:08:14.74,000 --> 0:08:15,000
It's all around the world.

176
0:08:16.225,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Millennials make up 27 percent of the world's population.

177
0:08:19.905,000 --> 0:08:21,000
That's around two billion people.

178
0:08:22.244,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And with countries like India, China, Indonesia and Brazil,

179
0:08:26.153,000 --> 0:08:27,000
along with the United States,

180
0:08:28.048,000 --> 0:08:3,000
accounting for 50 percent of the world's millennials,

181
0:08:30.93,000 --> 0:08:35,000
it's clear that the white, often male, heterosexual narrative of the millennial

182
0:08:36.174,000 --> 0:08:38,000
is only telling half the story.

183
0:08:38.436,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Now, there's many people trying to broaden the palette.

184
0:08:41.053,000 --> 0:08:44,000
They're fighting to get their stories told and bust the millennial stereotype.

185
0:08:44.817,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Whether it's students in South Africa protesting statues of Cecil Rhodes,

186
0:08:49.083,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Michaela Coel making us laugh from the UK,

187
0:08:52.103,000 --> 0:08:55,000
or Uche Eze, who's framing views about Nigerian life, online.

188
0:08:56.511,000 --> 0:08:57,000
But I want to make it clear --

189
0:08:57.987,000 --> 0:08:59,000
I want to make it really clear to everyone

190
0:09:00.024,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that just because things look more equal than they did

191
0:09:02.815,000 --> 0:09:03,000
in the 20th century,

192
0:09:04.169,000 --> 0:09:06,000
doesn't mean that things are equitable at all.

193
0:09:07.107,000 --> 0:09:09,000
It doesn't mean our experiences are equitable,

194
0:09:09.396,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and it certainly doesn't mean that a post-racial society,

195
0:09:12.677,000 --> 0:09:13,000
that thing that we talked about so much,

196
0:09:14.697,000 --> 0:09:16,000
ever became close to being a reality.

197
0:09:17.943,000 --> 0:09:18,000
I think of Joelle,

198
0:09:19.118,000 --> 0:09:22,000
a middle-class 20-something who did everything the "right way,"

199
0:09:22.822,000 --> 0:09:25,000
but she couldn't go to her dream school, because it was simply too expensive.

200
0:09:26.728,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Or Jalessa,

201
0:09:28.014,000 --> 0:09:3,000
who knows she can't be mediocre at her job

202
0:09:30.658,000 --> 0:09:32,000
the same way that her white peers can.

203
0:09:34.202,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Or Trina, who knows that people judge her unconventional family choices

204
0:09:38.447,000 --> 0:09:4,000
in a different way than if she were a white woman.

205
0:09:41.15,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Or actor AB,

206
0:09:42.738,000 --> 0:09:45,000
who knows that the roles he takes and gets in Hollywood are different

207
0:09:46.618,000 --> 0:09:47,000
because of his skin color.

208
0:09:49.14,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And then there's Simon.

209
0:09:50.634,000 --> 0:09:54,000
So Simon, by all means, would be an example of someone who's made it.

210
0:09:54.879,000 --> 0:09:57,000
He's a CFO at a tech company in San Francisco,

211
0:09:58.114,000 --> 0:10:,000
he has a degree from MIT

212
0:10:00.379,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and he's worked at some of the hottest tech companies in the world.

213
0:10:04.487,000 --> 0:10:1,000
But when I asked Simon if he had achieved the American dream,

214
0:10:10.82,000 --> 0:10:12,000
it took him a while to respond.

215
0:10:14.185,000 --> 0:10:17,000
While acknowledging that he had a really comfortable life,

216
0:10:17.615,000 --> 0:10:19,000
he admitted that under different circumstances,

217
0:10:20.61,000 --> 0:10:22,000
he might have chosen a different path.

218
0:10:23.038,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Simon really loves photography,

219
0:10:25.851,000 --> 0:10:27,000
but that was never a real option for him.

220
0:10:29.185,000 --> 0:10:3,000
"My parents weren't able to subsidize me

221
0:10:31.142,000 --> 0:10:33,000
through that sort of thing," Simon said.

222
0:10:33.509,000 --> 0:10:35,000
"Maybe that's something my children could do."

223
0:10:36.355,000 --> 0:10:37,000
So it's these kinds of stories --

224
0:10:38.11,000 --> 0:10:4,000
the quieter, more subtle ones --

225
0:10:40.317,000 --> 0:10:44,000
that reveal the often unique and untold stories of black millennials

226
0:10:44.669,000 --> 0:10:48,000
that show how even dreaming may differ between communities.

227
0:10:48.805,000 --> 0:10:51,000
So we really need to listen and hear the stories of this generation,

228
0:10:52.641,000 --> 0:10:53,000
now more than ever,

229
0:10:54.197,000 --> 0:10:57,000
as the baby boomers age and millennials come to prominence.

230
0:10:57.525,000 --> 0:11:03,000
We can talk all we want to about pickling businesses in Brooklyn

231
0:11:03.705,000 --> 0:11:04,000
or avocado toast,

232
0:11:05.513,000 --> 0:11:08,000
but leaving out the stories and the voices of black millennials,

233
0:11:08.546,000 --> 0:11:09,000
large swaths of the population --

234
0:11:10.259,000 --> 0:11:11,000
it will only increase divisions.

235
0:11:12.127,000 --> 0:11:14,000
So stories of black millennials, brown millennials

236
0:11:14.494,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and all millennials of color

237
0:11:15.908,000 --> 0:11:16,000
really need to be told,

238
0:11:17.094,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and they also need to be listened to.

239
0:11:18.976,000 --> 0:11:21,000
We'd be a far better-off country and world.

240
0:11:22.448,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Thank you.

241
0:11:23.623,000 --> 0:11:26,000
(Applause)

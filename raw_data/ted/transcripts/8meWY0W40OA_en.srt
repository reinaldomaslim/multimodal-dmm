1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
As a culture, we tell ourselves lots of stories

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
about the future,

3
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and where we might move forward from this point.

4
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Some of those stories are that

5
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
somebody is just going to sort everything out for us.

6
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Other stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling.

7
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
But I want to tell you a different story here today.

8
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Like all stories, it has a beginning.

9
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
My work, for a long time, has been involved in education,

10
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
in teaching people practical skills

11
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
for sustainability,

12
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
teaching people how to take responsibility

13
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
for growing some of their own food,

14
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
how to build buildings using local materials,

15
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
how to generate their own energy, and so on.

16
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I lived in Ireland, built the first straw-bale houses in Ireland,

17
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and some cob buildings and all this kind of thing.

18
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
But all my work for many years was focused

19
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
around the idea that sustainability

20
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
means basically looking at

21
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
the globalized economic growth model,

22
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and moderating what comes in at one end,

23
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and moderating the outputs at the other end.

24
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And then I came into contact with a way of looking at things

25
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
which actually changed that profoundly.

26
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And in order to introduce you to that,

27
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I've got something here that I'm going to unveil,

28
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
which is one of the great marvels of the modern age.

29
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And it's something so astounding and so astonishing

30
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that I think maybe as I remove this cloth

31
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
a suitable gasp of amazement might be appropriate.

32
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
If you could help me with that it would be fantastic.

33
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
This is a liter of oil.

35
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
This bottle of oil,

36
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
distilled over a hundred million years of geological time,

37
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
ancient sunlight,

38
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
contains the energy equivalent of about five weeks

39
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
hard human manual labor --

40
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
equivalent to about 35 strong people

41
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
coming round and working for you.

42
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
We can turn it into a dazzling array of materials,

43
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
medicine, modern clothing,

44
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
laptops, a whole range of different things.

45
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
It gives us an energy return that's unimaginable, historically.

46
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
We've based the design of our settlements,

47
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
our business models, our transport plans,

48
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
even the idea of economic growth, some would argue,

49
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
on the assumption that we will have this in perpetuity.

50
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Yet, when we take a step back,

51
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and look over the span of history,

52
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
at what we might call the petroleum interval,

53
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
it's a short period in history

54
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
where we've discovered this extraordinary material,

55
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and then based a whole way of life around it.

56
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
But as we straddle the top of this energy mountain, at this stage,

57
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
we move from a time where our economic success,

58
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
our sense of individual prowess and well-being

59
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
is directly linked to how much of this we consume,

60
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
to a time when actually our degree of oil dependency

61
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
is our degree of vulnerability.

62
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And it's increasingly clear that we

63
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
aren't going to be able to rely on the fact that

64
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
we're going to have this at our disposal forever.

65
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
For every four barrels of oil that we consume,

66
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
we only discover one.

67
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And that gap continues to widen.

68
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
There is also the fact that the amount of energy

69
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
that we get back from the oil that we discover is falling.

70
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
In the 1930s we got 100 units of energy back

71
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
for every one that we put in to extract it.

72
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Completely unprecedented, historically.

73
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Already that's fallen to about 11.

74
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And that's why, now,

75
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
the new breakthroughs, the new frontiers

76
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
in terms of oil extraction are scrambling about in Alberta,

77
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
or at the bottom of the oceans.

78
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
There are 98 oil-producing nations in the world.

79
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But of those, 65 have already passed their peak.

80
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
The moment when the world on average passes this peak,

81
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
people wonder when that's going to happen.

82
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And there is an emerging case

83
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
that maybe that was what happened last July

84
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
when the oil prices were so high.

85
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But are we to assume that the same brilliance

86
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and creativity and adaptability

87
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place

88
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
is somehow mysteriously going to evaporate

89
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
when we have to design a creative way back down the other side?

90
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
No. But the thinking that we have to come up with

91
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
has to be based on a realistic assessment

92
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
of where we are.

93
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
There is also the issue of climate change,

94
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
is the other thing that underpins this transition approach.

95
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
But the thing that I notice, as I talk to climate scientists,

96
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
is the increasingly terrified look they have in their eyes,

97
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
as the data that's coming in,

98
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
which is far ahead of what the IPCC are talking about.

99
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So the IPCC said

100
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that we might see significant breakup

101
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
of the arctic ice in 2100, in their worst case scenario.

102
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Actually, if current trends continue,

103
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
it could all be gone in five or 10 years' time.

104
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
If just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost

105
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
is released as the world warms,

106
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
it would offset all the savings that we need to make,

107
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
in carbon, over the next 40 years to avoid runaway climate change.

108
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
We have no choice other than deep and urgent decarbonization.

109
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
But I'm always very interested to think about

110
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
what might the stories be

111
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
that the generations further down the slope from us

112
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
are going to tell about us.

113
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
"The generation that lived at the top of the mountain,

114
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
that partied so hard, and so abused its inheritance."

115
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And one of the ways I like to do that

116
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
is to look back at the stories people used to tell

117
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
before we had cheap oil, before we had fossil fuels,

118
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and people relied on their own muscle, animal muscle energy,

119
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
or a little bit of wind, little bit of water energy.

120
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
We had stories like "The Seven-League Boots":

121
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
the giant who had these boots, where, once you put them on,

122
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
with every stride you could cover seven leagues, or 21 miles,

123
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
a kind of travel completely unimaginable

124
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
to people without that kind of energy at their disposal.

125
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Stories like The Magic Porridge Pot,

126
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
where you had a pot where if you knew the magic words,

127
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
this pot would just make as much food as you liked,

128
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
without you having to do any work,

129
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
provided you could remember the other magic word to stop it making porridge.

130
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Otherwise you'd flood your entire town with warm porridge.

131
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
There is the story of "The Elves and the Shoemaker."

132
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
The people who make shoes go to sleep, wake up in the morning,

133
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and all the shoes are magically made for them.

134
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
It's something that was unimaginable to people then.

135
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Now we have the seven-league boots

136
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
in the form of Ryanair and Easyjet.

137
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
We have the magic porridge pot

138
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
in the form of Walmart and Tesco.

139
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And we have the elves in the form of China.

140
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
But we don't appreciate what an astonishing

141
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
thing that has been.

142
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And what are the stories that we tell ourselves now,

143
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
as we look forward about where we're going to go.

144
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And I would argue that there are four. There is the idea of business as usual,

145
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
that the future will be like the present, just more of it.

146
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
But as we've seen over the last year, I think that's an idea

147
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that is increasingly coming into question.

148
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And in terms of climate change,

149
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
is something that is not actually feasible.

150
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
There is the idea of hitting the wall,

151
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that actually somehow everything is so fragile

152
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
that it might just all unravel and collapse.

153
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
This is a popular story in some places.

154
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
The third story is the idea that technology can solve everything,

155
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that technology can somehow get us through this completely.

156
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And it's an idea that I think is very prevalent at these TED Talks,

157
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
the idea that we can invent our way out of a profound

158
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
economic and energy crisis,

159
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
that a move to a knowledge economy

160
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
can somehow neatly sidestep those energy constraints,

161
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
the idea that we'll discover some fabulous new source of energy

162
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that will mean we can sweep all concerns

163
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
about energy security to one side,

164
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
the idea that we can step off neatly

165
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
onto a completely renewable world.

166
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
But the world isn't Second Life.

167
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
We can't create new land and new energy systems at the click of a mouse.

168
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And as we sit, exchanging free ideas with each other,

169
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
there are still people mining coal

170
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
in order to power the servers, extracting the minerals

171
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:57,000
to make all of those things.

172
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
The breakfast that we eat as we sit down

173
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
to check our email in the morning

174
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
is still transported at great distances,

175
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
usually at the expense of the local, more resilient

176
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
food systems that would have supplied that in the past,

177
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
which we've so effectively devalued and dismantled.

178
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
We can be astonishingly inventive and creative.

179
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
But we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands.

180
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Energy and technology are not the same thing.

181
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
What I'm involved with is the transition response.

182
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And this is really about looking the challenges

183
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
of peak oil and climate change square in the face,

184
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and responding with a creativity and an adaptability

185
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and an imagination that we really need.

186
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
It's something which has spread incredibly fast.

187
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And it is something which has several characteristics.

188
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
It's viral. It seems to spread under the radar very, very quickly.

189
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
It's open source. It's something which everybody who's involved with it

190
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
develops and passes on as they work with it.

191
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
It's self-organizing. There is no great central organization

192
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
that pushes this; people just pick up an idea

193
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and they run with it, and they implement it where they are.

194
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
It's solutions-focused. It's very much looking at what people can do

195
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
where they are, to respond to this.

196
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
It's sensitive to place and to scale.

197
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Transitional is completely different.

198
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Transition groups in Chile, transition groups in the U.S., transition groups here,

199
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
what they're doing looks very different in every place that you go to.

200
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
It learns very much from its mistakes.

201
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And it feels historic. It tries to create a sense

202
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
that this is a historic opportunity

203
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
to do something really extraordinary.

204
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And it's a process which is really joyful.

205
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:31,000
People have a huge amount of fun doing this,

206
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
reconnecting with other people as they do it.

207
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
One of the things that underpins it is this idea of resilience.

208
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And I think, in many ways, the idea of resilience

209
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
is a more useful concept than the idea of sustainability.

210
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
The idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology.

211
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And it's really about how systems,

212
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
settlements, withstand shock from the outside.

213
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
When they encounter shock from the outside

214
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
that they don't just unravel and fall to pieces.

215
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
And I think it's a more useful concept than sustainability, as I said.

216
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
When our supermarkets have only two or three days' worth of food in them

217
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
at any one time, often sustainability tends to focus on

218
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
the energy efficiency of the freezers

219
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in.

220
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Looking through the lens of resilience,

221
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
we really question how we've let ourselves get into a situation

222
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
that's so vulnerable.

223
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Resilience runs much deeper:

224
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
it's about building modularity into what we do,

225
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
building surge breakers into how we organize the basic things that support us.

226
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
This is a photograph of the Bristol and District

227
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Market Gardeners Association, in 1897.

228
0:10:35.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
This is at a time when the city of Bristol,

229
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
which is quite close to here,

230
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
was surrounded by commercial market gardens,

231
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:44,000
which provided a significant amount of the food

232
0:10:44.33,000 --> 0:10:48,000
that was consumed in the town, and created a lot of employment for people, as well.

233
0:10:48.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
There was a degree of resilience, if you like, at that time,

234
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
which we can now only look back on with envy.

235
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
So how does this transition idea work?

236
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
So basically, you have a group of people who are excited by the idea.

237
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:03,000
They pick up some of the tools that we've developed.

238
0:11:03.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
They start to run an awareness-raising program

239
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
looking at how this might actually work in the town.

240
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
They show films, they give talks, and so on.

241
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
It's a process which is playful and creative

242
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and informative.

243
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Then they start to form working groups, looking at different aspects of this,

244
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and then from that, there emerge a whole lot of projects

245
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:23,000
which then the transition project itself

246
0:11:23.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
starts to support and enable.

247
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:3,000
So it started out with some work I was involved in in Ireland,

248
0:11:30.33,000 --> 0:11:32,000
where I was teaching, and has since spread.

249
0:11:32.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
There are now over 200 formal transition projects.

250
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage.

251
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
They are mulling whether they're going to take it further.

252
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff.

253
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
But what do they actually do? You know, it's a kind of nice idea,

254
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
but what do they actually do on the ground?

255
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Well, I think it's really important to make the point that actually

256
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
you know, this isn't something which is going to do everything on its own.

257
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:59,000
We need international legislation from Copenhagen and so on.

258
0:11:59.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
We need national responses. We need local government responses.

259
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
But all of those things are going to be much easier

260
0:12:05.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
if we have communities that are vibrant and coming up with ideas

261
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and leading from the front, making unelectable policies electable,

262
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
over the next 5 to 10 years.

263
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Some of the things that emerge from it are local food projects,

264
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:18,000
like community-supported agriculture schemes,

265
0:12:18.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
urban food production, creating local food directories, and so on.

266
0:12:22.33,000 --> 0:12:25,000
A lot of places now are starting to set up their own energy companies,

267
0:12:25.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
community-owned energy companies,

268
0:12:27.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
where the community can invest money into itself,

269
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
to start putting in place

270
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
the kind of renewable energy infrastructure that we need.

271
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
A lot of places are working with their local schools.

272
0:12:36.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Newent in the Forest of Dean: big polytunnel they built for the school;

273
0:12:38.33,000 --> 0:12:4,000
the kids are learning how to grow food.

274
0:12:40.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Promoting recycling, things like garden-share,

275
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
that matches up people who don't have a garden

276
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
who would like to grow food, with people who have gardens they aren't using anymore.

277
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Planting productive trees throughout urban spaces.

278
0:12:51.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And also starting to play around with the idea of

279
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:55,000
alternative currencies.

280
0:12:55.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
This is Lewes in Sussex,

281
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:13:,000
who have recently launched the Lewes Pound,

282
0:13:00.33,000 --> 0:13:02,000
a currency that you can only spend within the town,

283
0:13:02.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
as a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy.

284
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
You take it anywhere else, it's not worth anything.

285
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
But actually within the town you start to create these economic

286
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
cycles much more effectively.

287
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Another thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan,

288
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
which is basically to develop a plan B for the town.

289
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Most of our local authorities, when they sit down to plan

290
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:24,000
for the next five, 10, 15, 20 years of a community,

291
0:13:24.33,000 --> 0:13:27,000
still start by assuming that there will be more energy,

292
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
more cars, more housing,

293
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
more jobs, more growth, and so on.

294
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
What does it look like if that's not the case? And how can we embrace that

295
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and actually come up with something that was actually more likely

296
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
to sustain everybody?

297
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
As a friend of mine says, "Life is a series of things you're not quite ready for."

298
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:45,000
And that's certainly been my experience with transition.

299
0:13:45.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
From three years ago, it just being an idea,

300
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
this has become something that has virally swept around the world.

301
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
We're getting a lot of interest from government. Ed Miliband,

302
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
the energy minister of this country, was invited to come to our recent conference

303
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
as a keynote listener.

304
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Which he did --

305
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
(Laughter)

306
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:05,000
(Applause) --

307
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and has since become a great advocate of the whole idea.

308
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
There are now two local authorities in this country

309
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
who have declared themselves transitional local authorities,

310
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Leicestershire and Somerset. And in Stroud,

311
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
the transition group there, in effect, wrote the local government's food plan.

312
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:23,000
And the head of the council said,

313
0:14:23.33,000 --> 0:14:25,000
"If we didn't have Transition Stroud, we would have to invent

314
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:29,000
all of that community infrastructure for the first time."

315
0:14:29.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
As we see the spread of it, we see national hubs emerging.

316
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
In Scotland, the Scottish government's climate change fund

317
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
has funded Transition Scotland

318
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
as a national organization supporting the spread of this.

319
0:14:40.33,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And we see it all over the place as well now.

320
0:14:43.33,000 --> 0:14:46,000
But the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now,

321
0:14:46.33,000 --> 0:14:49,000
but that things are already inevitably changing,

322
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and what we need to do is to work creatively with that,

323
0:14:52.33,000 --> 0:14:55,000
based on asking the right questions.

324
0:14:55.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
I think I'd like to just return at the end

325
0:14:57.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
to the idea of stories.

326
0:14:59.33,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Because I think stories are vital here.

327
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:03,000
And actually the stories that we tell ourselves,

328
0:15:03.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
we have a huge dearth of stories about how to move forward creatively from here.

329
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:1,000
And one of the key things that transition does

330
0:15:10.33,000 --> 0:15:12,000
is to pull those stories out of what people are doing.

331
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Stories about the community that's produced

332
0:15:15.33,000 --> 0:15:18,000
its own 21 pound note, for example,

333
0:15:18.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
the school that's turned its car park into a food garden,

334
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:24,000
the community that's founded its own energy company.

335
0:15:24.33,000 --> 0:15:26,000
And for me, one of the great stories recently

336
0:15:26.33,000 --> 0:15:29,000
was the Obamas digging up the south lawn of the White House

337
0:15:29.33,000 --> 0:15:31,000
to create a vegetable garden. Because the last time that was done,

338
0:15:31.33,000 --> 0:15:33,000
when Eleanor Roosevelt did it,

339
0:15:33.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
it led to the creation of 20 million vegetable gardens across the United States.

340
0:15:38.33,000 --> 0:15:4,000
So the question I'd like to leave you with, really,

341
0:15:40.33,000 --> 0:15:44,000
is -- for all aspects of the things that your community needs

342
0:15:44.33,000 --> 0:15:46,000
in order to thrive,

343
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:48,000
how can it be done in such a way

344
0:15:48.33,000 --> 0:15:51,000
that drastically reduces its carbon emissions,

345
0:15:51.33,000 --> 0:15:53,000
while also building resilience?

346
0:15:53.33,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Personally, I feel enormously grateful

347
0:15:55.33,000 --> 0:15:58,000
to have lived through the age of cheap oil.

348
0:15:58.33,000 --> 0:16:02,000
I've been astonishingly lucky, we've been astonishingly lucky.

349
0:16:02.33,000 --> 0:16:04,000
But let us honor what it has bought us,

350
0:16:04.33,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and move forward from this point.

351
0:16:06.33,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Because if we cling to it, and continue to assume

352
0:16:08.33,000 --> 0:16:11,000
that it can underpin our choices,

353
0:16:11.33,000 --> 0:16:14,000
the future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable.

354
0:16:14.33,000 --> 0:16:17,000
And by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us,

355
0:16:17.33,000 --> 0:16:19,000
and that the Oil Age has done for us,

356
0:16:19.33,000 --> 0:16:21,000
we are able to then begin the creation

357
0:16:21.33,000 --> 0:16:24,000
of a world which is more resilient,

358
0:16:24.33,000 --> 0:16:26,000
more nourishing,

359
0:16:26.33,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and in which, we find ourselves fitter, more skilled

360
0:16:29.33,000 --> 0:16:31,000
and more connected to each other.

361
0:16:31.33,000 --> 0:16:33,000
Thank you very much.

362
0:16:33.33,000 --> 0:16:37,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:13.692,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So two weeks ago, I searched the word "nationalist" on Twitter.

3
0:00:18.109,000 --> 0:00:19,000
The results were quite colorful,

4
0:00:19.974,000 --> 0:00:22,000
with expressions like, "Emboldened Racist Moron," --

5
0:00:23.351,000 --> 0:00:24,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:24.385,000 --> 0:00:26,000
"White Supremacist Idiot,"

7
0:00:26.534,000 --> 0:00:27,000
"Fascist Sock Puppets," --

8
0:00:28.504,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:29.536,000 --> 0:00:31,000
"Orwellian, Hitlerian, Terrifying."

10
0:00:32.373,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I then searched the word "globalist"

11
0:00:34.564,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and got things like, "Socialist Sell-Outs,"

12
0:00:37.79,000 --> 0:00:39,000
"Disgusting Corporate Propaganda,"

13
0:00:40.774,000 --> 0:00:43,000
"Elitist Financial Overlords,"

14
0:00:43.813,000 --> 0:00:45,000
"Ruthless Cosmopolitan Rats."

15
0:00:45.949,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:47.039,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Even by social media standards, the words are cruel and disgusting.

17
0:00:51.379,000 --> 0:00:55,000
But they reflect the intensity of one of the most fundamental questions

18
0:00:56.125,000 --> 0:00:57,000
of our times:

19
0:00:57.348,000 --> 0:01:,000
Nationalism or globalism -- what is the best path forward?

20
0:01:01.494,000 --> 0:01:03,000
This question impacts everything we care about:

21
0:01:03.949,000 --> 0:01:04,000
our cultural identity,

22
0:01:05.814,000 --> 0:01:06,000
our prosperity,

23
0:01:07.653,000 --> 0:01:09,000
our political systems --

24
0:01:09.808,000 --> 0:01:12,000
everything -- the health of our planet -- everything.

25
0:01:13.55,000 --> 0:01:15,000
So on the one hand, we have nationalism.

26
0:01:16.62,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Collins defines it as a "devotion to one's nation,"

27
0:01:19.956,000 --> 0:01:21,000
but also, a "doctrine that puts national interests

28
0:01:22.744,000 --> 0:01:24,000
above international considerations."

29
0:01:25.364,000 --> 0:01:3,000
For nationalists, our modern societies are built on national grounds:

30
0:01:30.408,000 --> 0:01:34,000
we share a land, a history, a culture, and we defend each other.

31
0:01:35.288,000 --> 0:01:37,000
In a big and chaotic world,

32
0:01:37.667,000 --> 0:01:41,000
they see nationalism as the only sensible way to maintain social stability.

33
0:01:43.597,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But alarmed globalists warn us:

34
0:01:46.056,000 --> 0:01:49,000
self-centered nationalism can easily turn ugly.

35
0:01:49.803,000 --> 0:01:51,000
We've seen it with 20th-century fascisms:

36
0:01:52.535,000 --> 0:01:56,000
bloody wars, millions of deaths, immeasurable destruction.

37
0:01:57.39,000 --> 0:01:58,000
On the other hand, we have globalism.

38
0:01:59.744,000 --> 0:02:01,000
The Oxford Living Dictionary defines it as:

39
0:02:02.032,000 --> 0:02:05,000
"the operation or planning of economic and foreign policy

40
0:02:05.407,000 --> 0:02:06,000
on a global basis."

41
0:02:07.574,000 --> 0:02:1,000
For nationalists, globalism is rapidly deconstructing

42
0:02:11.01,000 --> 0:02:13,000
what our ancestors took decades to build.

43
0:02:13.662,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It's like spitting on our soldiers' tombs;

44
0:02:16.072,000 --> 0:02:19,000
it's eroding our national solidarities

45
0:02:19.096,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and opening the doors to foreign invasions.

46
0:02:22.705,000 --> 0:02:26,000
But globalists make the case that reinforcing our global governance

47
0:02:27.489,000 --> 0:02:3,000
is the only way to tackle big supernational problems,

48
0:02:31.24,000 --> 0:02:33,000
like nuclear proliferation,

49
0:02:34.035,000 --> 0:02:36,000
the global refugee crisis,

50
0:02:36.225,000 --> 0:02:38,000
climate change or terrorism

51
0:02:38.965,000 --> 0:02:41,000
or even the consequences of superhuman AI.

52
0:02:42.97,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So we are at the crossroads,

53
0:02:45.079,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and we are asked to choose:

54
0:02:46.95,000 --> 0:02:48,000
nationalism or globalism?

55
0:02:51.301,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Having lived in four continents,

56
0:02:52.908,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I've always been interested in this question.

57
0:02:55.256,000 --> 0:02:58,000
But it took a whole new level when I saw this happening:

58
0:02:58.852,000 --> 0:03:02,000
the biggest surge in nationalist votes in Western democracies

59
0:03:03.145,000 --> 0:03:04,000
since World War II.

60
0:03:05.413,000 --> 0:03:07,000
All of a sudden, this isn't theory anymore.

61
0:03:08.412,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I mean, these political movements have built their success with ideas

62
0:03:12.422,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that could mean, down the road, losing my French citizenship

63
0:03:15.556,000 --> 0:03:16,000
because I'm North African

64
0:03:17.27,000 --> 0:03:19,000
or not being able to come back home to the US

65
0:03:19.846,000 --> 0:03:21,000
because I come from a Muslim-majority country.

66
0:03:22.895,000 --> 0:03:24,000
You know, when you live in a democracy,

67
0:03:25.04,000 --> 0:03:28,000
you live with this idea that your government will always protect you,

68
0:03:28.973,000 --> 0:03:3,000
as long as you abide by the laws.

69
0:03:31.509,000 --> 0:03:33,000
With the rise of national populism,

70
0:03:34.317,000 --> 0:03:36,000
despite being the best citizen I can,

71
0:03:36.773,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I now have to live with the idea that my government can hurt me

72
0:03:40.375,000 --> 0:03:41,000
for reasons I cannot control.

73
0:03:42.579,000 --> 0:03:43,000
It's very unsettling.

74
0:03:44.522,000 --> 0:03:45,000
But it forced me to rethink

75
0:03:46.006,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and rethink this question and try to think deeper.

76
0:03:49.418,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And the more I thought about it,

77
0:03:51.12,000 --> 0:03:53,000
the more I started questioning the question.

78
0:03:54.191,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Why would we have to choose between nationalism and globalism,

79
0:03:57.605,000 --> 0:04:,000
between loving our country and caring for the world?

80
0:04:02.143,000 --> 0:04:03,000
There's no reason for that.

81
0:04:03.472,000 --> 0:04:05,000
We don't have to choose between family and country

82
0:04:05.866,000 --> 0:04:07,000
or region or religion and country.

83
0:04:07.939,000 --> 0:04:11,000
We already have multiple identities, and we live with them very well.

84
0:04:12.798,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Why would we have to choose between country and world?

85
0:04:16.491,000 --> 0:04:19,000
What if, instead of accepting this absurd choice,

86
0:04:19.728,000 --> 0:04:23,000
we took it on ourselves to fight this dangerous, binary thinking?

87
0:04:24.764,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So for all the globalists in the audience,

88
0:04:27.129,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I want to ask:

89
0:04:28.47,000 --> 0:04:31,000
When I say the word "nationalist," what image comes to your mind?

90
0:04:33.031,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Something like this?

91
0:04:34.52,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Believe me, I think of that, too.

92
0:04:36.823,000 --> 0:04:38,000
But I'd like you to remember that for most people,

93
0:04:39.844,000 --> 0:04:41,000
nationalism feels more like this.

94
0:04:42.313,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Or maybe like that.

95
0:04:44.418,000 --> 0:04:45,000
You know, it's that thing inside you

96
0:04:46.366,000 --> 0:04:5,000
when you accidentally watch an obscure Olympic sport on TV --

97
0:04:51.075,000 --> 0:04:53,000
(Laughter)

98
0:04:53.331,000 --> 0:04:54,000
wait --

99
0:04:54.416,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and the mere sight of an unknown athlete wearing your national colors

100
0:04:58.347,000 --> 0:04:59,000
gets you all excited.

101
0:05:00.104,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Your heartbeat goes up,

102
0:05:01.842,000 --> 0:05:02,000
your stress level goes up,

103
0:05:03.697,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and you're standing in front of the TV

104
0:05:05.544,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and screaming with passion for that athlete to win.

105
0:05:08.638,000 --> 0:05:09,000
That's nationalism.

106
0:05:09.812,000 --> 0:05:1,000
It's people happy to be together,

107
0:05:11.57,000 --> 0:05:13,000
happy to belong to a large national community.

108
0:05:14.901,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Why would it be wrong?

109
0:05:17.421,000 --> 0:05:19,000
You know, globalists, you may think of nationalism

110
0:05:19.794,000 --> 0:05:22,000
as an old, 19th-century idea that is destined to fade.

111
0:05:23.62,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But I'm sorry to tell you that the facts are not on your side.

112
0:05:27.976,000 --> 0:05:3,000
When the World Values Survey asked more than 89,000 people

113
0:05:31.828,000 --> 0:05:32,000
across 60 countries

114
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
how proud they felt about their country,

115
0:05:36.006,000 --> 0:05:39,000
88.5 percent said "very proud" or "quite proud" --

116
0:05:39.953,000 --> 0:05:4,000
88.5 percent.

117
0:05:41.989,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Nationalism is not going away anytime soon.

118
0:05:45.58,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It's a powerful feeling that, according to another study,

119
0:05:49.797,000 --> 0:05:52,000
is a strong predictor of individual happiness.

120
0:05:53.431,000 --> 0:05:58,000
It's crazy, but your happiness is more correlated with national satisfaction

121
0:05:58.61,000 --> 0:06:01,000
than with things you would expect, like household income

122
0:06:01.915,000 --> 0:06:03,000
or your job satisfaction

123
0:06:03.943,000 --> 0:06:04,000
or your health satisfaction.

124
0:06:05.955,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So if nationalism makes people happy,

125
0:06:08.591,000 --> 0:06:1,000
why would anybody take it away from them?

126
0:06:11.666,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Fellow globalists, if you are like me,

127
0:06:14.398,000 --> 0:06:17,000
you may be attached to globalization for humanistic reasons.

128
0:06:17.957,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And you may take great joy in some of its accomplishments since 1945.

129
0:06:22.664,000 --> 0:06:25,000
After all, major regions of the world have been exceptionally peaceful;

130
0:06:26.664,000 --> 0:06:29,000
extreme poverty rates around the globe are trending down;

131
0:06:30.506,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and more than two billion people, most notably in Asia,

132
0:06:33.706,000 --> 0:06:35,000
show spectacular improvements in their standards of living.

133
0:06:37.266,000 --> 0:06:41,000
But studies also show that globalization has a dark side.

134
0:06:41.591,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And left on the side of the road

135
0:06:44.527,000 --> 0:06:47,000
are hundreds of millions of people in Western middle classes

136
0:06:48.316,000 --> 0:06:5,000
with anemic income growth for more than two decades,

137
0:06:51.125,000 --> 0:06:53,000
possibly three decades, according to some studies.

138
0:06:54.031,000 --> 0:06:56,000
We cannot ignore this elephant in our room.

139
0:06:57.015,000 --> 0:06:59,000
If anything, our collective energy would be better used

140
0:06:59.672,000 --> 0:07:02,000
finding ways to fix this aspect of globalization,

141
0:07:03.093,000 --> 0:07:07,000
instead of fighting this polarizing battle against nationalism.

142
0:07:08.547,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So now, the nationalists in the audience,

143
0:07:10.856,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I have some crusty, nonbinary nuggets for you.

144
0:07:14.184,000 --> 0:07:15,000
(Laughter)

145
0:07:16.211,000 --> 0:07:18,000
When I say the word "globalist," what comes to your mind?

146
0:07:19.496,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Out-of-touch, one-percent plutocrats?

147
0:07:21.843,000 --> 0:07:22,000
(Laughter)

148
0:07:23.27,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Or maybe the heartless, greedy Wall Street type, right?

149
0:07:26.402,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Or maybe people like me, with multiple origins,

150
0:07:28.884,000 --> 0:07:3,000
living in a big, cosmopolitan metropolis.

151
0:07:32.696,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Well, you remember that World Values Survey that I mentioned earlier?

152
0:07:36.428,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It showed another fascinating finding:

153
0:07:39.074,000 --> 0:07:43,000
71 percent of the world population agreed with the statement,

154
0:07:43.417,000 --> 0:07:44,000
"I am a citizen of the world."

155
0:07:45.262,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Do you know what it means?

156
0:07:47.094,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Most of us are simultaneously proud of our country

157
0:07:50.347,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and citizens of the world.

158
0:07:52.185,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And it gets even better.

159
0:07:53.741,000 --> 0:07:57,000
The citizens of the world in the survey show a higher level of national pride

160
0:07:58.206,000 --> 0:07:59,000
than the ones that rejected that label.

161
0:08:00.754,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So once and for all, being a globalist doesn't mean betraying your country.

162
0:08:04.529,000 --> 0:08:06,000
It just means that you have enough social empathy,

163
0:08:06.95,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and you project some of it outside your national borders.

164
0:08:11.248,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Now, I know that when I dig into my own nationalist feelings,

165
0:08:14.756,000 --> 0:08:17,000
one of my anxieties versus the globalized world

166
0:08:17.818,000 --> 0:08:18,000
is national identity:

167
0:08:19.753,000 --> 0:08:22,000
How are we going to preserve what makes us special,

168
0:08:22.972,000 --> 0:08:23,000
what makes us different,

169
0:08:24.282,000 --> 0:08:25,000
what brings us together?

170
0:08:25.94,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And as I started thinking about it, I realized something really strange,

171
0:08:29.946,000 --> 0:08:32,000
which is that a lot of the key ingredients of our national identities

172
0:08:33.88,000 --> 0:08:35,000
actually come from outside our national borders.

173
0:08:37.032,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Like, think of the letters that we use every day.

174
0:08:39.705,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I don't know if you realize,

175
0:08:41.121,000 --> 0:08:44,000
but the Latin script, the Latin alphabet that we use

176
0:08:44.957,000 --> 0:08:46,000
has its origins thousands of years ago,

177
0:08:47.34,000 --> 0:08:48,000
near the Nile River.

178
0:08:49.082,000 --> 0:08:52,000
It all started with a cow just like this,

179
0:08:52.436,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that was captured by a scribe into an elegant hieroglyph.

180
0:08:57.233,000 --> 0:09:,000
That hieroglyph was transcribed by a Semite in the Sinai

181
0:09:00.82,000 --> 0:09:01,000
into the letter aleph.

182
0:09:02.972,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Aleph traveled with Phoenicians and reached the European shores in Greece,

183
0:09:08.036,000 --> 0:09:09,000
where it became alpha,

184
0:09:09.498,000 --> 0:09:1,000
the mother of our letter A.

185
0:09:11.555,000 --> 0:09:14,000
So that's how an Egyptian cow became our letter A.

186
0:09:14.914,000 --> 0:09:15,000
(Laughter)

187
0:09:16.865,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And same thing with the Egyptian house that became bet, beta and B.

188
0:09:22.951,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And the Egyptian fish that became daleth, delta and D.

189
0:09:27.681,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Our most fundamental texts are full of Egyptian cows,

190
0:09:31.106,000 --> 0:09:32,000
houses and fish.

191
0:09:32.637,000 --> 0:09:33,000
(Laughter)

192
0:09:34.565,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And there are so many other examples.

193
0:09:36.812,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Take the United Kingdom and its monarchy.

194
0:09:39.596,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Queen Elizabeth II?

195
0:09:41.607,000 --> 0:09:42,000
German ancestry.

196
0:09:43.384,000 --> 0:09:45,000
The mottos on the royal coat of arms?

197
0:09:45.721,000 --> 0:09:47,000
All written in French, not a single word of English.

198
0:09:49.117,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Take France and it's iconic Eiffel Tower.

199
0:09:52.92,000 --> 0:09:53,000
The inspiration?

200
0:09:54.754,000 --> 0:09:55,000
The United States of America --

201
0:09:56.774,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and I don't mean Las Vegas,

202
0:09:58.092,000 --> 0:09:59,000
I mean 19th-century New York.

203
0:09:59.874,000 --> 0:10:,000
(Laughter)

204
0:10:00.985,000 --> 0:10:03,000
This was the tallest building in New York in the mid-19th century.

205
0:10:04.526,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Does it remind you of something?

206
0:10:07.147,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And you may think of China as a self-contained civilization,

207
0:10:10.61,000 --> 0:10:12,000
protected behind its Great Wall.

208
0:10:12.763,000 --> 0:10:13,000
But think twice.

209
0:10:14.305,000 --> 0:10:16,000
The Chinese official ideology?

210
0:10:16.375,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Marxism, made in Germany.

211
0:10:20.064,000 --> 0:10:21,000
One of China's biggest religions?

212
0:10:21.733,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Buddhism, imported from India.

213
0:10:24.365,000 --> 0:10:26,000
India's favorite pastime?

214
0:10:26.674,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Cricket.

215
0:10:28.222,000 --> 0:10:3,000
I really love this quote from Ashis Nandy,

216
0:10:30.664,000 --> 0:10:34,000
who said, "Cricket is an Indian game accidentally discovered by the British."

217
0:10:35.565,000 --> 0:10:36,000
(Laughter)

218
0:10:37.147,000 --> 0:10:43,000
So these are good reminders that a lot of what we love in our national traditions

219
0:10:43.716,000 --> 0:10:45,000
actually come from previous waves of globalization.

220
0:10:46.835,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And beyond individual symbols, there are whole national traditions

221
0:10:50.563,000 --> 0:10:53,000
that could not have existed without globalization.

222
0:10:54.07,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And the example that comes to my mind is a world-beloved national tradition:

223
0:10:58.399,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Italian cuisine.

224
0:11:00.056,000 --> 0:11:01,000
My friends, if you ever have a chance

225
0:11:01.884,000 --> 0:11:03,000
to go to a superauthentic Italian restaurant

226
0:11:04.472,000 --> 0:11:06,000
that only serves ancient Roman recipes,

227
0:11:07.141,000 --> 0:11:09,000
my advice for you is: don't go.

228
0:11:09.651,000 --> 0:11:1,000
(Laughter)

229
0:11:11.102,000 --> 0:11:12,000
You'd get very, very disappointed.

230
0:11:13.353,000 --> 0:11:14,000
No spaghetti, no pasta --

231
0:11:15.241,000 --> 0:11:17,000
that really started in Sicily in the eighth century,

232
0:11:18.129,000 --> 0:11:19,000
when it was under Arabian rule.

233
0:11:20.407,000 --> 0:11:22,000
No perfect espresso, no creamy cappuccino --

234
0:11:23.068,000 --> 0:11:26,000
that came from Abyssinia via Yemen in the 17th century.

235
0:11:26.925,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And of course, no perfect pizza Napoletana --

236
0:11:29.458,000 --> 0:11:32,000
how would you make it without the tomatoes of the New World?

237
0:11:33.736,000 --> 0:11:37,000
No, instead, you would be served probably a lot of porridge,

238
0:11:37.799,000 --> 0:11:4,000
some vegetable -- mostly cabbage -- some cheese,

239
0:11:41.48,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and maybe if you're lucky,

240
0:11:43.21,000 --> 0:11:46,000
the absolute delicacy of that time --

241
0:11:46.356,000 --> 0:11:49,000
mmm, perfectly cooked fattened dormice.

242
0:11:49.911,000 --> 0:11:5,000
(Laughter)

243
0:11:52.115,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Thankfully, it was not a close tradition preserved by fanatic watchdogs.

244
0:11:56.431,000 --> 0:11:57,000
No, it was an open process,

245
0:11:58.108,000 --> 0:12:03,000
nourished by explorers, traders, street sellers and innovative home cooks.

246
0:12:04.021,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And in many ways, globalization is a chance

247
0:12:06.111,000 --> 0:12:11,000
for our national traditions to be questioned, regenerated, reinterpreted,

248
0:12:11.398,000 --> 0:12:14,000
to attract new converts to stay vibrant and relevant over time.

249
0:12:15.841,000 --> 0:12:16,000
So just remember this:

250
0:12:17.48,000 --> 0:12:19,000
most of us nationalists in the world are globalists,

251
0:12:20.202,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and most of us globalists in the world are nationalists.

252
0:12:23.046,000 --> 0:12:26,000
A lot of what we like in our national traditions

253
0:12:26.135,000 --> 0:12:28,000
come from outside our national borders.

254
0:12:28.475,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And the reason we venture outside our national borders

255
0:12:31.221,000 --> 0:12:33,000
is to discover these other national traditions.

256
0:12:33.941,000 --> 0:12:34,000
So the real question should not be

257
0:12:35.684,000 --> 0:12:37,000
to choose between nationalism and globalism.

258
0:12:38.394,000 --> 0:12:41,000
The real questions is: How can we do both better?

259
0:12:41.932,000 --> 0:12:43,000
It's a complex question for a complex world

260
0:12:44.807,000 --> 0:12:47,000
that calls for creative, nonbinary solutions.

261
0:12:48.334,000 --> 0:12:49,000
What are you waiting for?

262
0:12:49.715,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Thank you.

263
0:12:50.89,000 --> 0:12:51,000
(Applause)

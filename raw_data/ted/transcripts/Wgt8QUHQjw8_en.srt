1
0:00:13.689,000 --> 0:00:14,000
It's 1878.

2
0:00:16.789,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Sir Francis Galton gives a remarkable talk.

3
0:00:21.138,000 --> 0:00:25,000
He's speaking to the anthropologic institute of Great Britain and Ireland.

4
0:00:25.99,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Known for his pioneering work in human intelligence,

5
0:00:30.04,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Galton is a brilliant polymath.

6
0:00:33.536,000 --> 0:00:34,000
He's an explorer,

7
0:00:35.114,000 --> 0:00:36,000
an anthropologist,

8
0:00:36.891,000 --> 0:00:37,000
a sociologist,

9
0:00:38.445,000 --> 0:00:39,000
a psychologist

10
0:00:40.038,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and a statistician.

11
0:00:43.207,000 --> 0:00:45,000
He's also a eugenist.

12
0:00:46.42,000 --> 0:00:47,000
In this talk,

13
0:00:48.627,000 --> 0:00:52,000
he presents a new technique by which he can combine photographs

14
0:00:53.404,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and produce composite portraits.

15
0:00:56.483,000 --> 0:01:01,000
This technique could be used to characterize different types of people.

16
0:01:02.522,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Galton thinks that if he combines photographs of violent criminals,

17
0:01:07.895,000 --> 0:01:1,000
he will discover the face of criminality.

18
0:01:12.073,000 --> 0:01:13,000
But to his surprise,

19
0:01:14.084,000 --> 0:01:16,000
the composite portrait that he produces

20
0:01:17.771,000 --> 0:01:18,000
is beautiful.

21
0:01:21.846,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Galton's surprising finding raises deep questions:

22
0:01:25.335,000 --> 0:01:26,000
What is beauty?

23
0:01:27.89,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Why do certain configurations of line and color and form excite us so?

24
0:01:36.192,000 --> 0:01:37,000
For most of human history,

25
0:01:37.744,000 --> 0:01:42,000
these questions have been approached using logic and speculation.

26
0:01:43.935,000 --> 0:01:44,000
But in the last few decades,

27
0:01:45.476,000 --> 0:01:47,000
scientists have addressed the question of beauty

28
0:01:48.378,000 --> 0:01:53,000
using ideas from evolutionary psychology and tools of neuroscience.

29
0:01:54.322,000 --> 0:01:57,000
We're beginning to glimpse the why and the how of beauty,

30
0:01:58.765,000 --> 0:02:01,000
at least in terms of what it means for the human face and form.

31
0:02:03.021,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And in the process,

32
0:02:04.601,000 --> 0:02:06,000
we're stumbling upon some surprises.

33
0:02:07.98,000 --> 0:02:09,000
When it comes to seeing beauty in each other,

34
0:02:11.569,000 --> 0:02:15,000
while this decision is certainly subjective for the individual,

35
0:02:15.948,000 --> 0:02:19,000
it's sculpted by factors that contribute to the survival of the group.

36
0:02:20.63,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Many experiments have shown

37
0:02:23.302,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that a few basic parameters contribute to what makes a face attractive.

38
0:02:28.135,000 --> 0:02:33,000
These include averaging, symmetry and the effects of hormones.

39
0:02:33.835,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Let's take each one of these in turn.

40
0:02:38.351,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Galton's finding

41
0:02:39.849,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that composite or average faces are typically more attractive

42
0:02:45.156,000 --> 0:02:48,000
than each individual face that contributes to the average

43
0:02:48.737,000 --> 0:02:49,000
has been replicated many times.

44
0:02:51.753,000 --> 0:02:55,000
This laboratory finding fits with many people's intuitions.

45
0:02:56.574,000 --> 0:03:,000
Average faces represent the central tendencies of a group.

46
0:03:01.544,000 --> 0:03:05,000
People with mixed features represent different populations,

47
0:03:05.887,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and presumably harbor greater genetic diversity

48
0:03:09.259,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and adaptability to the environment.

49
0:03:12.157,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Many people find mixed-race individuals attractive

50
0:03:16.585,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and inbred families less so.

51
0:03:20.447,000 --> 0:03:24,000
The second factor that contributes to beauty is symmetry.

52
0:03:25.294,000 --> 0:03:29,000
People generally find symmetric faces more attractive than asymmetric ones.

53
0:03:30.578,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Developmental abnormalities are often associated with asymmetries.

54
0:03:35.854,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And in plants, animals and humans,

55
0:03:39.143,000 --> 0:03:42,000
asymmetries often arise from parasitic infections.

56
0:03:43.193,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Symmetry, it turns out,

57
0:03:45.435,000 --> 0:03:48,000
is also an indicator of health.

58
0:03:50.289,000 --> 0:03:51,000
In the 1930s,

59
0:03:52.599,000 --> 0:03:54,000
a man named Maksymilian Faktorowicz

60
0:03:55.523,000 --> 0:03:58,000
recognized the importance of symmetry for beauty

61
0:03:58.724,000 --> 0:04:,000
when he designed the beauty micrometer.

62
0:04:02.117,000 --> 0:04:03,000
With this device,

63
0:04:03.292,000 --> 0:04:06,000
he could measure minor asymmetric flaws

64
0:04:06.371,000 --> 0:04:1,000
which he could then make up for with products he sold from his company,

65
0:04:10.944,000 --> 0:04:13,000
named brilliantly after himself, Max Factor,

66
0:04:14.792,000 --> 0:04:17,000
which, as you know, is one of the world's most famous brands

67
0:04:17.827,000 --> 0:04:18,000
for "make up."

68
0:04:20.335,000 --> 0:04:23,000
The third factor that contributes to facial attractiveness

69
0:04:24.317,000 --> 0:04:25,000
is the effect of hormones.

70
0:04:27.353,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And here, I need to apologize for confining my comments

71
0:04:32.102,000 --> 0:04:33,000
to heterosexual norms.

72
0:04:35.438,000 --> 0:04:39,000
But estrogen and testosterone play important roles

73
0:04:39.932,000 --> 0:04:41,000
in shaping features that we find attractive.

74
0:04:43.463,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Estrogen produces features that signal fertility.

75
0:04:48.154,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Men typically find women attractive

76
0:04:51.128,000 --> 0:04:55,000
who have elements of both youth and maturity.

77
0:04:56.003,000 --> 0:04:59,000
A face that's too baby-like might mean that the girl is not yet fertile,

78
0:05:00.939,000 --> 0:05:01,000
so men find women attractive

79
0:05:02.936,000 --> 0:05:06,000
who have large eyes, full lips and narrow chins

80
0:05:07.196,000 --> 0:05:08,000
as indicators of youth,

81
0:05:09.52,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and high cheekbones as an indicator of maturity.

82
0:05:14.384,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Testosterone produces features that we regard as typically masculine.

83
0:05:20.597,000 --> 0:05:22,000
These include heavier brows,

84
0:05:22.641,000 --> 0:05:23,000
thinner cheeks

85
0:05:23.97,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and bigger, squared-off jaws.

86
0:05:26.246,000 --> 0:05:27,000
But here's a fascinating irony.

87
0:05:29.515,000 --> 0:05:3,000
In many species,

88
0:05:30.69,000 --> 0:05:31,000
if anything,

89
0:05:32.095,000 --> 0:05:35,000
testosterone suppresses the immune system.

90
0:05:36.822,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So the idea that testosterone-infused features are a fitness indicator

91
0:05:41.02,000 --> 0:05:43,000
doesn't really make a whole lot of sense.

92
0:05:44.003,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Here, the logic is turned on its head.

93
0:05:47.478,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Instead of a fitness indicator,

94
0:05:49.651,000 --> 0:05:52,000
scientists invoke a handicap principle.

95
0:05:54.609,000 --> 0:05:57,000
The most commonly cited example of a handicap

96
0:05:58.165,000 --> 0:05:59,000
is the peacock's tail.

97
0:06:00.362,000 --> 0:06:04,000
This beautiful but cumbersome tail doesn't exactly help the peacock

98
0:06:04.782,000 --> 0:06:05,000
avoid predators

99
0:06:06.73,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and approach peahens.

100
0:06:09.008,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Why should such an extravagant appendage evolve?

101
0:06:13.767,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Even Charles Darwin,

102
0:06:16.228,000 --> 0:06:19,000
in an 1860 letter to Asa Gray wrote

103
0:06:19.651,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that the sight of the peacock's tail made him physically ill.

104
0:06:23.964,000 --> 0:06:25,000
He couldn't explain it with his theory of natural selection,

105
0:06:26.886,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and out of this frustration,

106
0:06:28.809,000 --> 0:06:31,000
he developed the theory of sexual selection.

107
0:06:33.321,000 --> 0:06:34,000
On this account,

108
0:06:34.495,000 --> 0:06:38,000
the display of the peacock's tail is about sexual enticement,

109
0:06:38.902,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and this enticement means it's more likely the peacock will mate

110
0:06:45.148,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and have offspring.

111
0:06:47.638,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Now, the modern twist on this display argument

112
0:06:51.292,000 --> 0:06:55,000
is that the peacock is also advertising its health to the peahen.

113
0:06:57.821,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Only especially fit organisms can afford to divert resources

114
0:07:02.972,000 --> 0:07:04,000
to maintaining such an extravagant appendage.

115
0:07:06.412,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Only especially fit men can afford the price that testosterone levies

116
0:07:11.329,000 --> 0:07:12,000
on their immune system.

117
0:07:13.38,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And by analogy, think of the fact

118
0:07:16.062,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that only very rich men can afford to pay more than $10,000 for a watch

119
0:07:23.051,000 --> 0:07:25,000
as a display of their financial fitness.

120
0:07:26.933,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Now, many people hear these kinds of evolutionary claims

121
0:07:29.759,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and think they mean that we somehow are unconsciously seeking mates

122
0:07:35.513,000 --> 0:07:36,000
who are healthy.

123
0:07:37.452,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And I think this idea is probably not right.

124
0:07:42.089,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Teenagers and young adults are not exactly known for making decisions

125
0:07:46.975,000 --> 0:07:48,000
that are predicated on health concerns.

126
0:07:50.364,000 --> 0:07:51,000
But they don't have to be,

127
0:07:51.989,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and let me explain why.

128
0:07:54.971,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Imagine a population

129
0:07:57.028,000 --> 0:08:01,000
in which people have three different kinds of preferences:

130
0:08:01.23,000 --> 0:08:04,000
for green, for orange and for red.

131
0:08:05.742,000 --> 0:08:06,000
From their point of view,

132
0:08:06.957,000 --> 0:08:08,000
these preferences have nothing to do with health;

133
0:08:09.344,000 --> 0:08:1,000
they just like what they like.

134
0:08:11.948,000 --> 0:08:15,000
But if it were also the case that these preferences are associated

135
0:08:16.013,000 --> 0:08:18,000
with the different likelihood of producing offspring --

136
0:08:19.035,000 --> 0:08:21,000
let's say in a ratio of 3:2:1 --

137
0:08:22.88,000 --> 0:08:23,000
then in the first generation,

138
0:08:24.348,000 --> 0:08:27,000
there would be 3 greens to 2 oranges to 1 red,

139
0:08:27.644,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and in each subsequent generation,

140
0:08:29.854,000 --> 0:08:31,000
the proportion of greens increase,

141
0:08:33.887,000 --> 0:08:34,000
so that in 10 generations,

142
0:08:35.622,000 --> 0:08:38,000
98 percent of this population has a green preference.

143
0:08:39.783,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Now, a scientist coming in and sampling this population

144
0:08:42.928,000 --> 0:08:45,000
discovers that green preferences are universal.

145
0:08:47.426,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So the point about this little abstract example

146
0:08:51.322,000 --> 0:08:55,000
is that while preferences for specific physical features

147
0:08:56.006,000 --> 0:08:58,000
can be arbitrary for the individual,

148
0:08:59.91,000 --> 0:09:,000
if those features are heritable

149
0:09:05.052,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and they are associated with a reproductive advantage,

150
0:09:09.235,000 --> 0:09:1,000
over time,

151
0:09:10.473,000 --> 0:09:11,000
they become universal for the group.

152
0:09:14.992,000 --> 0:09:19,000
So what happens in the brain when we see beautiful people?

153
0:09:22.34,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Attractive faces activate parts of our visual cortex

154
0:09:26.392,000 --> 0:09:27,000
in the back of the brain,

155
0:09:28.361,000 --> 0:09:29,000
an area called the fusiform gyrus,

156
0:09:30.327,000 --> 0:09:32,000
that is especially tuned to processing faces,

157
0:09:33.153,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and an adjacent area called the lateral occipital complex,

158
0:09:37.191,000 --> 0:09:39,000
that is especially attuned to processing objects.

159
0:09:40.52,000 --> 0:09:41,000
In addition,

160
0:09:41.94,000 --> 0:09:46,000
attractive faces activate parts of our reward and pleasure centers

161
0:09:47.042,000 --> 0:09:49,000
in the front and deep in the brain,

162
0:09:49.999,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and these include areas that have complicated names,

163
0:09:53.147,000 --> 0:09:54,000
like the ventral striatum,

164
0:09:55.035,000 --> 0:09:56,000
the orbitofrontal cortex

165
0:09:56.978,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.

166
0:10:00.552,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Our visual brain that is tuned to processing faces

167
0:10:04.56,000 --> 0:10:06,000
interacts with our pleasure centers

168
0:10:07.221,000 --> 0:10:09,000
to underpin the experience of beauty.

169
0:10:11.539,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Amazingly, while we all engage with beauty,

170
0:10:15.655,000 --> 0:10:16,000
without our knowledge,

171
0:10:17.276,000 --> 0:10:18,000
beauty also engages us.

172
0:10:20.298,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Our brains respond to attractive faces

173
0:10:22.821,000 --> 0:10:24,000
even when we're not thinking about beauty.

174
0:10:26.457,000 --> 0:10:3,000
We conducted an experiment in which people saw a series of faces,

175
0:10:30.77,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and in one condition,

176
0:10:32.497,000 --> 0:10:37,000
they had to decide if a pair of faces were the same or a different person.

177
0:10:39.727,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Even in this condition,

178
0:10:42.244,000 --> 0:10:48,000
attractive faces drove neural activity robustly in their visual cortex,

179
0:10:48.41,000 --> 0:10:51,000
despite the fact that they were thinking about a person's identity

180
0:10:51.947,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and not their beauty.

181
0:10:54.947,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Another group similarly found automatic responses to beauty

182
0:10:59.282,000 --> 0:11:01,000
within our pleasure centers.

183
0:11:02.371,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Taken together, these studies suggest

184
0:11:05.853,000 --> 0:11:09,000
that our brain automatically responds to beauty

185
0:11:10.388,000 --> 0:11:12,000
by linking vision and pleasure.

186
0:11:13.674,000 --> 0:11:15,000
These beauty detectors, it seems,

187
0:11:16.078,000 --> 0:11:17,000
ping every time we see beauty,

188
0:11:17.94,000 --> 0:11:19,000
regardless of whatever else we might be thinking.

189
0:11:22.842,000 --> 0:11:27,000
We also have a "beauty is good" stereotype embedded in the brain.

190
0:11:29.532,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Within the orbitofrontal cortex,

191
0:11:31.783,000 --> 0:11:32,000
there's overlapping neural activity

192
0:11:33.582,000 --> 0:11:36,000
in response to beauty and to goodness,

193
0:11:39.005,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and this happens even when people aren't explicitly thinking

194
0:11:42.551,000 --> 0:11:43,000
about beauty or goodness.

195
0:11:45.726,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Our brains seem to reflexively associate beauty and good.

196
0:11:50.51,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And this reflexive association may be the biologic trigger

197
0:11:54.512,000 --> 0:11:56,000
for the many social effects of beauty.

198
0:11:57.877,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Attractive people receive all kinds of advantages in life.

199
0:12:03.376,000 --> 0:12:05,000
They're regarded as more intelligent,

200
0:12:06.154,000 --> 0:12:07,000
more trustworthy,

201
0:12:07.781,000 --> 0:12:1,000
they're given higher pay and lesser punishments,

202
0:12:11.35,000 --> 0:12:13,000
even when such judgments are not warranted.

203
0:12:15.392,000 --> 0:12:18,000
These kinds of observations reveal beauty's ugly side.

204
0:12:19.616,000 --> 0:12:21,000
In my lab, we recently found

205
0:12:21.713,000 --> 0:12:25,000
that people with minor facial anomalies and disfigurements

206
0:12:26.659,000 --> 0:12:29,000
are regarded as less good, less kind,

207
0:12:30.467,000 --> 0:12:34,000
less intelligent, less competent and less hardworking.

208
0:12:35.674,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Unfortunately, we also have a "disfigured is bad" stereotype.

209
0:12:42.218,000 --> 0:12:48,000
This stereotype is probably exploited and magnified

210
0:12:48.9,000 --> 0:12:5,000
by images in popular media,

211
0:12:51.337,000 --> 0:12:54,000
in which facial disfigurement is often used as a shorthand

212
0:12:55.257,000 --> 0:12:57,000
to depict someone of villainous character.

213
0:12:59.198,000 --> 0:13:02,000
We need to understand these kinds of implicit biases

214
0:13:02.676,000 --> 0:13:03,000
if we are to overcome them

215
0:13:04.437,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and aim for a society in which we treat people fairly,

216
0:13:08.142,000 --> 0:13:12,000
based on their behavior and not on the happenstance of their looks.

217
0:13:16.578,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Let me leave you with one final thought.

218
0:13:20.864,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Beauty is a work in progress.

219
0:13:24.347,000 --> 0:13:27,000
The so-called universal attributes of beauty

220
0:13:27.578,000 --> 0:13:32,000
were selected for during the almost two million years of the Pleistocene.

221
0:13:33.764,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Life was nasty, brutish and a very long time ago.

222
0:13:39.834,000 --> 0:13:44,000
The selection criteria for reproductive success from that time

223
0:13:45.182,000 --> 0:13:46,000
doesn't really apply today.

224
0:13:47.786,000 --> 0:13:48,000
For example,

225
0:13:49.3,000 --> 0:13:53,000
death by parasite is not one of the top ways that people die,

226
0:13:53.391,000 --> 0:13:55,000
at least not in the technologically developed world.

227
0:13:57.817,000 --> 0:13:59,000
From antibiotics to surgery,

228
0:14:00.201,000 --> 0:14:03,000
birth control to in vitro fertilization,

229
0:14:03.717,000 --> 0:14:06,000
the filters for reproductive success are being relaxed.

230
0:14:07.776,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And under these relaxed conditions,

231
0:14:10.455,000 --> 0:14:14,000
preference and trait combinations are free to drift

232
0:14:14.713,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and become more variable.

233
0:14:17.236,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Even as we are profoundly affecting our environment,

234
0:14:22.805,000 --> 0:14:25,000
modern medicine and technological innovation

235
0:14:26.142,000 --> 0:14:27,000
is profoundly affecting

236
0:14:27.919,000 --> 0:14:3,000
the very essence of what it means to look beautiful.

237
0:14:33.017,000 --> 0:14:35,000
The universal nature of beauty is changing

238
0:14:35.591,000 --> 0:14:37,000
even as we're changing the universe.

239
0:14:40.683,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Thank you.

240
0:14:41.892,000 --> 0:14:44,000
(Applause)

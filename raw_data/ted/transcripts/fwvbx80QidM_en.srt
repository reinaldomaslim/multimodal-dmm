1
0:00:12.667,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Between 2004 and 2008,

2
0:00:15.417,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I unsuccessfully tried to get into the Kenyan music industry.

3
0:00:19.375,000 --> 0:00:21,000
But the recurring answer from producers

4
0:00:22.083,000 --> 0:00:24,000
was I was not Kenyan enough.

5
0:00:24.417,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Meaning what?

6
0:00:25.708,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I didn't sing fully in the slang derivative of Kiswahili

7
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and I didn't sing enough party tracks,

8
0:00:31.333,000 --> 0:00:34,000
so they said Kenyans wouldn't listen to a Kenyan who sounded like me.

9
0:00:36.042,000 --> 0:00:37,000
This idea of otherism,

10
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:39,000
the exclusion of a person

11
0:00:39.5,000 --> 0:00:41,000
based on their perceived deviation from the norms,

12
0:00:42.417,000 --> 0:00:44,000
goes to the root of the problems in Kenya.

13
0:00:45.125,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And it runs deep.

14
0:00:47.667,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Kenya was invented by colonialists in 1895,

15
0:00:50.875,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and with it, came the erasure of our identity

16
0:00:53.75,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and the class system built on otherism.

17
0:00:56.333,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So by 1963, when we received our independence,

18
0:00:59.75,000 --> 0:01:02,000
these ideas had already become the new normal.

19
0:01:02.917,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Now, we've tried a lot of different ways to move forward since.

20
0:01:05.917,000 --> 0:01:07,000
We have a common language, currency, infrastructure,

21
0:01:08.708,000 --> 0:01:1,000
basically all the things that make a country a country.

22
0:01:11.667,000 --> 0:01:13,000
But all these efforts at nation-building

23
0:01:14.042,000 --> 0:01:16,000
do not go to the heart of the matter.

24
0:01:16.292,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Which is this:

25
0:01:17.583,000 --> 0:01:19,000
we cannot build what we do not truly love.

26
0:01:20.458,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And we cannot love until we love ourselves.

27
0:01:24.458,000 --> 0:01:26,000
The thing we have to heal, us Kenyans,

28
0:01:26.917,000 --> 0:01:27,000
is our lack of self-love,

29
0:01:28.625,000 --> 0:01:3,000
our deep self-hate

30
0:01:30.667,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and our existential identity crisis.

31
0:01:33.917,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And this is the work of nation-building

32
0:01:36.458,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that only the creative industry can do.

33
0:01:40.417,000 --> 0:01:42,000
The idea that Kenya can only include some of us

34
0:01:43.375,000 --> 0:01:47,000
led me to found a music festival in 2008 called Blankets and Wine,

35
0:01:47.542,000 --> 0:01:5,000
to give a platform to myself and other misfits.

36
0:01:50.625,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Ten years later, we've programmed over 200 bands

37
0:01:53.083,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and put at least 100,000 dollars

38
0:01:55.375,000 --> 0:01:57,000
directly into the hands of artists and managers,

39
0:01:58.375,000 --> 0:02:01,000
who have in turn spent it on technicians, rehearsals,

40
0:02:01.708,000 --> 0:02:04,000
music videos and other things along the music value chain.

41
0:02:05.583,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Our platform has allowed for multiple Kenyan identities to exist,

42
0:02:09.792,000 --> 0:02:11,000
while inspiring the industry to discover and engage

43
0:02:12.292,000 --> 0:02:14,000
the wide variety of Kenyan music.

44
0:02:15.042,000 --> 0:02:18,000
What we do is necessary but insufficient.

45
0:02:18.292,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And we must urgently pivot into a live music circuit.

46
0:02:21.958,000 --> 0:02:25,000
But there are other ways music can help heal the nation.

47
0:02:26.125,000 --> 0:02:28,000
According to a 2018 state of media report,

48
0:02:29.083,000 --> 0:02:33,000
traditional radio is sill by far the biggest distributor of ideas in Kenya,

49
0:02:33.5,000 --> 0:02:36,000
with 47 percent of Kenyans still choosing radio first.

50
0:02:37.417,000 --> 0:02:39,000
This presents an opportunity.

51
0:02:39.75,000 --> 0:02:43,000
We can use radio to help Kenyans hear the diversity that is Kenya.

52
0:02:43.917,000 --> 0:02:46,000
We can reserve 60 percent of all programing on Kenyan radio

53
0:02:47.417,000 --> 0:02:48,000
for Kenyan music.

54
0:02:49.125,000 --> 0:02:5,000
We can break down ethnic barriers

55
0:02:50.792,000 --> 0:02:53,000
by playing Kenyan music done in English, Kiswahili

56
0:02:53.917,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and other ethnic languages,

57
0:02:55.708,000 --> 0:02:58,000
on what is now single-language ethnic radio.

58
0:02:59.458,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Radio can help stimulate interest and demand

59
0:03:02.5,000 --> 0:03:04,000
for Kenyan music by Kenyans,

60
0:03:05.208,000 --> 0:03:07,000
while also providing the much-needed incomes

61
0:03:07.917,000 --> 0:03:08,000
by way of royalties.

62
0:03:09.542,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But more importantly,

63
0:03:11.208,000 --> 0:03:14,000
radio can help us build a more inclusive narrative about Kenya.

64
0:03:15.208,000 --> 0:03:18,000
For you cannot love what you do not know exists.

65
0:03:19.583,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Other creative industries too can do the work.

66
0:03:22.792,000 --> 0:03:24,000
When you consider that 41 percent of Kenyans

67
0:03:24.917,000 --> 0:03:26,000
still choose TV as their primary medium,

68
0:03:27.292,000 --> 0:03:3,000
it's obvious that film has a huge potential.

69
0:03:30.917,000 --> 0:03:32,000
The meager resources that have been put into the sector

70
0:03:33.513,000 --> 0:03:34,000
have already produced world-class acts,

71
0:03:35.417,000 --> 0:03:37,000
like Lupita Nyong'o and Wanuri Kahiu,

72
0:03:37.583,000 --> 0:03:4,000
but we are going to need a lot more incentives and investments

73
0:03:40.833,000 --> 0:03:42,000
to make filming in Kenya easier,

74
0:03:42.917,000 --> 0:03:45,000
so more Kenyan stories can get on the Kenyan TV

75
0:03:46.167,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and spark off the really difficult conversations

76
0:03:48.667,000 --> 0:03:5,000
we need to have with one another.

77
0:03:51.208,000 --> 0:03:55,000
We're going to need to grow a lot more home-grown stars,

78
0:03:55.542,000 --> 0:03:57,000
so we can reverse the idea

79
0:03:57.583,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that we have to blow up abroad

80
0:03:59.583,000 --> 0:04:02,000
before we get the acceptance and validation of home.

81
0:04:04.417,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Fashion too can do the work.

82
0:04:06.5,000 --> 0:04:07,000
We need to make it possible

83
0:04:08.042,000 --> 0:04:11,000
to affordably mass-produce Kenyan clothes for Kenyan consumers,

84
0:04:11.333,000 --> 0:04:14,000
so we don't all have to rely on second-hand imports.

85
0:04:15.625,000 --> 0:04:16,000
The first running shoe made in Kenya

86
0:04:17.458,000 --> 0:04:19,000
needs to be a local and global success

87
0:04:19.708,000 --> 0:04:21,000
as an ode to Kenyan excellence,

88
0:04:21.958,000 --> 0:04:25,000
epitomized by Kenyan runners, who are literally world-class.

89
0:04:26.792,000 --> 0:04:28,000
For these ideas to come to life,

90
0:04:29.333,000 --> 0:04:3,000
jobs will be created,

91
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and Kenyan ideas will be exported.

92
0:04:33.458,000 --> 0:04:34,000
But more importantly,

93
0:04:35.417,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Kenyans may finally consider themselves worthy

94
0:04:38.5,000 --> 0:04:4,000
of the love that we reserve for others.

95
0:04:42.167,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Kenya's creative industry is dynamic,

96
0:04:44.875,000 --> 0:04:45,000
cosmopolitan, forward-looking,

97
0:04:46.75,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and without a doubt,

98
0:04:48.042,000 --> 0:04:51,000
a true manufacturing industry of the immediate future.

99
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:57,000
But its true power lies in its ability to help heal the psyche of Kenya,

100
0:04:57.583,000 --> 0:05:,000
so we can finally build a nation for real.

101
0:05:01.958,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Thank you.

102
0:05:03.25,000 --> 0:05:08,000
(Applause)

103
0:05:08.75,000 --> 0:05:1,000
(Applause)

104
0:05:11.292,000 --> 0:05:13,000
For this song, I'd like us all to take a minute

105
0:05:13.875,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and think about immigrant communities,

106
0:05:16.5,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and especially refugee immigrant communities,

107
0:05:19.708,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and the daily struggle they have to endure,

108
0:05:22.458,000 --> 0:05:23,000
building a life with dignity and meaning

109
0:05:24.458,000 --> 0:05:27,000
away from everything they have loved and known.

110
0:05:27.583,000 --> 0:05:29,000
If you feel any empathy for this idea,

111
0:05:30.25,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I ask to see your fist up in the air with me.

112
0:05:32.583,000 --> 0:05:33,000
(Music)

113
0:05:34.292,000 --> 0:05:35,000
"Million voice."

114
0:05:36.708,000 --> 0:05:39,000
The mandem make some noise

115
0:05:39.75,000 --> 0:05:42,000
With a million, million voice

116
0:05:43.083,000 --> 0:05:46,000
All the mandem make some noise

117
0:05:46.125,000 --> 0:05:49,000
With a million, million voice

118
0:05:49.333,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Can't stop I, won't stop I

119
0:05:52.5,000 --> 0:05:55,000
With a million, million voice

120
0:05:55.708,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Can't stop I, won't stop I

121
0:05:58.917,000 --> 0:06:,000
With a million, million voice

122
0:06:01.792,000 --> 0:06:04,000
This one dedicated to my people building something

123
0:06:04.917,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Working hard to make sure that their children will lack for nothing

124
0:06:08.167,000 --> 0:06:11,000
When them people come around and treat them like they're basic

125
0:06:11.292,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I just want to LOL and tell them to consider all their options

126
0:06:15.417,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Caution, natural distortion

127
0:06:17.708,000 --> 0:06:2,000
You can't even kill us we survive even abortion

128
0:06:20.917,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Say we cannot make it, watch us how we make it

129
0:06:24.083,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Watch us in a minute come and run and overtake it

130
0:06:27.292,000 --> 0:06:28,000
TED, clap!

131
0:06:28.917,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Can't have enough of it

132
0:06:32.125,000 --> 0:06:35,000
This our only way of life

133
0:06:35.375,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Keeping, keeping on the grind

134
0:06:38.542,000 --> 0:06:4,000
TED, will you clap like this.

135
0:06:41.75,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Can't have enough of it

136
0:06:45.042,000 --> 0:06:48,000
This our only way of life

137
0:06:48.083,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Keeping, keeping on the grind

138
0:06:51.292,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Keeping, keeping on the grind

139
0:06:53.542,000 --> 0:06:55,000
The mandem make some noise

140
0:06:56.542,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Like a million, million voice

141
0:06:59.792,000 --> 0:07:02,000
All the mandem make some noise

142
0:07:02.917,000 --> 0:07:05,000
With a million, million voice

143
0:07:06.125,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Can't stop I, won't stop I

144
0:07:09.292,000 --> 0:07:12,000
With a million, million voice

145
0:07:12.5,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Can't stop I, won't stop I

146
0:07:15.708,000 --> 0:07:18,000
With a million, million voice

147
0:07:19.125,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Can I be your leader

148
0:07:20.667,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Can I be your Caesar

149
0:07:22.417,000 --> 0:07:25,000
If I show you how to make some more will you pledge allegiance

150
0:07:25.5,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Is it always either

151
0:07:27.125,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Me or you or neither

152
0:07:28.792,000 --> 0:07:31,000
If I show you where I'm coming from, will you take a breather?

153
0:07:31.875,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Cos what you'll find -- what you'll find

154
0:07:35.333,000 --> 0:07:37,000
What you'll find guarantee will blow your mind!

155
0:07:38.292,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I'll blow your mind -- I'll blow your mind

156
0:07:41.542,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And then you'll see the reason I stay on my grind

157
0:07:44.583,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Would you clap!

158
0:07:45.875,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Can't have enough of it

159
0:07:48.917,000 --> 0:07:51,000
It's our only way of life

160
0:07:52.083,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Keeping, keeping on the grind

161
0:07:55.292,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Keeping, keeping on the grind

162
0:07:58.542,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Can't have enough of it

163
0:08:01.708,000 --> 0:08:04,000
It's our only way of life

164
0:08:04.917,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Keeping, keeping on the grind

165
0:08:08.292,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Keeping, keeping on the grind

166
0:08:10.375,000 --> 0:08:13,000
The mandem make some noise

167
0:08:13.917,000 --> 0:08:17,000

(Applause)

169
0:08:24.917,000 --> 0:08:27,000
This next one is partly in Kiswahili,

170
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:3,000
which is what we speak in Kenya.

171
0:08:30.542,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And it's about female friendship

172
0:08:33.917,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and female power.

173
0:08:35.458,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And girls coming together to build something that lasts,

174
0:08:38.708,000 --> 0:08:41,000
a true legacy and intergenerational worth.

175
0:08:41.958,000 --> 0:08:42,000
"Suzie Noma."

177
0:08:50.582,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Sitting at the corner

Me and Suzie Noma

179
0:08:53.625,000 --> 0:08:55,000
We ain't got no worries we are looking like the owners

180
0:08:56.625,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Sipping on Coronas

181
0:08:58.125,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Looking at the phone as

0:09:08.667,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Planning how we want to take over the world soon

186
0:09:11.667,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Riding on the drums and the clap while the bass goes

187
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:18,000

Be the way to go

Go and grab somebody, move your body, show somebody

0:09:36.792,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Be the way to go

Scheming at the corner

199
0:09:55.167,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Me and Suzie Noma

200
0:09:56.667,000 --> 0:09:58,000
We ain't got no money but we do it how we wanna

201
0:09:59.625,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Painting our nails checking our mails as

0:00:26.498,000 --> 0:00:3,000
You know, when Chris first approached me to speak at TED, I said no,

2
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:33,000
because I felt like I wasn't going to be able

3
0:00:33.167,000 --> 0:00:36,000
to make that personal connection, you know, that I wanted to.

4
0:00:36.43,000 --> 0:00:37,000
It's such a large conference.

5
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:4,000
But he explained to me that he was in a bind,

6
0:00:40.523,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and that he was having trouble finding the kind of sex appeal

7
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and star power that the conference was known for.

8
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:49,000
So I said fine, Ted -- I mean Chris.

9
0:00:49.859,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I'll come on two conditions.

10
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:56,000
One: I want to speak as early in the morning as possible.

11
0:00:57.349,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And two: I want to pick the theme for TED 2006.

12
0:01:01.64,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And luckily he agreed.

13
0:01:03.773,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And the theme, in two years, is going to be "Cute Pictures Of Puppies."

for nature has a way of arriving unannounced,

but their echoes sound ouder.

I am Mr Micheal Bangura, the son of late Mr Thaimu Bangura

who was the Minister of Finance in Sierra Leone

46

but was killed during the civil war.

Knowing your country to be economical conducive for investment,

0:02:53.31,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and your people as transparent and trustworthy to engage in business,

0:02:56.588,000 --> 0:02:57,000
on which premise I write you.

Before my father death,

53
0:03:01.877,000 --> 0:03:04,000
he had the sum of 23 million United States dollars,

54
0:03:05.582,000 --> 0:03:08,000
which he kept away from the rebel leaders during the course of the war.

(Laughter)

56
0:03:11.42,000 --> 0:03:12,000
This fund was supposed to be used

57
0:03:13.086,000 --> 0:03:16,000
for the rehabilitation of water reserves all over the country,

58
0:03:16.534,000 --> 0:03:17,000
before the outbreak of war.

59
0:03:18.506,000 --> 0:03:2,000
When the war broke out,

60
0:03:20.555,000 --> 0:03:22,000
the rebel leader demanded the fund be given to him,

61
0:03:23.025,000 --> 0:03:26,000
my father insisted it was not in his possession,

62
0:03:26.352,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and he was killed because of his refusal to release the fund.

63
0:03:29.655,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Meanwhile, my mother and I

64
0:03:30.922,000 --> 0:03:33,000
is the only person who knows about it because my father always confide in me.

0:03:34.768,000 --> 0:03:35,000
(Sighs)

66
0:03:36.001,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I made an arrangement with a Red Cross relief worker,

67
0:03:38.544,000 --> 0:03:41,000
who used his official van to transport the money to Lungi Airport, Freetown,

68
0:03:42.141,000 --> 0:03:44,000
although he did not know the real contents of the box.

0:03:44.69,000 --> 0:03:45,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:46.327,000 --> 0:03:48,000
The fund was deposited as a family reasure,

71
0:03:49.3,000 --> 0:03:52,000
in a safe, reliable security company in Dakar, Senegal,

72
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:54,000
where I was only given temporary asylum.

73
0:03:55.43,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I do not wish to invest the money in Senegal

74
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:01,000
due to unfavorable economic climate, and so close to my country.

75
0:04:02.369,000 --> 0:04:06,000
The only assistance I need from you, which I know you would do for me,

76
0:04:06.811,000 --> 0:04:08,000
are the following: one, be a silent partner

77
0:04:09.776,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and receive the funds in your account in trust;

78
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
two, provide a bank account under your control

79
0:04:15.401,000 --> 0:04:16,000
to which the funds will be remitted;

80
0:04:17.368,000 --> 0:04:2,000
three, receive the funds into your account in trust;

81
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:24,000
take out your commission; and leave the rest of the money

82
0:04:24.489,000 --> 0:04:26,000
until I arrive, after the transfer is complete.

83
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:29,000

(Laughter)

120
0:06:13.921,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And they were telling me that Google software has gotten so advanced

121
0:06:17.402,000 --> 0:06:21,000
that, based on your interaction with Google over your lifetime,

122
0:06:21.641,000 --> 0:06:24,000
they can actually predict what you are going to say --

But they said, "No, but don't show anyone."

128
0:06:36.803,000 --> 0:06:37,000
But they slipped up.

129
0:06:38.073,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And they said that I could just type in "What was I going to say next?"

130
0:06:42.154,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and my name, and it would tell me.

131
0:06:43.876,000 --> 0:06:46,000

(Laughter)

146
0:07:26.531,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I filmed myself dancing to Madonna's "Justify My Love."

147
0:07:31.69,000 --> 0:07:34,000
On a Thursday, I sent out a link to a website that featured those clips

148
0:07:35.382,000 --> 0:07:36,000
to 17 of my closest friends,

Within a week, I received a call from Earthlink that said,

157
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:06,000
due to a 10 cents per megabyte overage charge,

158
0:08:06.215,000 --> 0:08:07,000
I owed them 30,000 dollars.

(Laughter)

160
0:08:10.352,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Needless to say, I was able to leave my job.

(Laughter)

295
0:14:05.417,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Tech joy, to me, means something, because I get a lot of joy out of tech.

296
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:13,000
And in fact, making things using technology --

297
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and I'm being serious here,

298
0:14:15.452,000 --> 0:14:18,000
even though I'm using my sarcastic voice -- I won't -- hold on.

299
0:14:19.657,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Making things, you know --

300
0:14:22.736,000 --> 0:14:24,000
making things actually does give me a lot of joy.

301
0:14:25.066,000 --> 0:14:27,000
It's the process of creation that keeps me

302
0:14:27.405,000 --> 0:14:3,000
sort of a bubble and a half above perpetual anxiety in my life,

303
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:34,000
and it's that feeling of being about 80 percent complete on a project --

304
0:14:34.453,000 --> 0:14:36,000
where you know you still have something to do,

305
0:14:36.668,000 --> 0:14:39,000
but it's not finished, and you're not starting something --

306
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:42,000
that really fills my entire life.

307
0:14:42.714,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And so, what I've done is,

308
0:14:44.572,000 --> 0:14:47,000
I started getting interested in creating online social spaces

309
0:14:48.202,000 --> 0:14:49,000
to share that feeling

310
0:14:49.696,000 --> 0:14:51,000
with people who don't consider themselves artists.

311
0:14:52.124,000 --> 0:14:54,000
We're in a culture of guru-ship.

312
0:14:54.622,000 --> 0:14:57,000
It's so hard to use some software because, you know, it's unapproachable,

313
0:14:58.478,000 --> 0:15:,000
people feel like they have to read the manual.

314
0:15:01.078,000 --> 0:15:06,000
So I try to create these very minimal activities

315
0:15:06.694,000 --> 0:15:09,000
that allow people to express themselves, and, hopefully --

323
0:15:32.087,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Here I created a contest called, "When Office Supplies Attack,"

324
0:15:36,000 --> 0:15:4,000

326
0:15:42.182,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Over 500 entries in three weeks.

327
0:15:46.554,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Toilet paper fashion.

328
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:5,000
(Laughter)

329
0:15:50.867,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Again, people from all over the country.

330
0:15:53.178,000 --> 0:15:55,000
The watch is particularly incredible.

331
0:15:55.31,000 --> 0:15:57,000
(Laughter)

332
0:15:58,000 --> 0:16:,000
Online drawing tools -- you've probably seen a lot of them.

333
0:16:00.808,000 --> 0:16:01,000
I think they're wonderful.

334
0:16:02.079,000 --> 0:16:04,000
It's a chance for people to get to play with crayons

335
0:16:04.575,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and all that kind of stuff.

336
0:16:05.885,000 --> 0:16:07,000
But I'm interested in the process of creating,

337
0:16:08.262,000 --> 0:16:11,000
as the real event that I'm interested in.

338
0:16:11.464,000 --> 0:16:15,000
And the problem is that a lot of people suck at drawing,

339
0:16:15.622,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and they get bummed out at this, sort of, you know, stick figure,

340
0:16:19.612,000 --> 0:16:21,000
awful little thing that they created.

341
0:16:21.839,000 --> 0:16:24,000
And eventually, it just makes them stop playing with it,

342
0:16:25,000 --> 0:16:27,000
or they draw penises and things like that.

343
0:16:27.545,000 --> 0:16:28,000
(Laughter)

344
0:16:29,000 --> 0:16:32,000
So, the Scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool.

345
0:16:32.429,000 --> 0:16:34,000
In other words, it's a helping tool.

346
0:16:35,000 --> 0:16:36,000
You can draw your simple stick figure,

347
0:16:36.834,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and it collaborates with you to create sort of a post-war German etching.

348
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:43,000
(Laughter)

349
0:16:43.23,000 --> 0:16:49,000
In fact, it's tuned to be better at drawing things that look worse.

350
0:16:50.46,000 --> 0:16:53,000
So, we go ahead, and we start scribbling.

351
0:16:54.888,000 --> 0:16:58,000
So the idea is that you can really,

352
0:16:59,000 --> 0:17:01,000
you know, partake in this process,

353
0:17:02,000 --> 0:17:04,000
but watch something really crappy look beautiful.

354
0:17:05.853,000 --> 0:17:06,000
And here are some of my favorites.

355
0:17:07.587,000 --> 0:17:1,000
This is the little trap marionette that was submitted to me.

356
0:17:14.35,000 --> 0:17:15,000
Very cool.

357
0:17:15.572,000 --> 0:17:16,000
(Laughter)

358
0:17:18.257,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Darling.

359
0:17:20.201,000 --> 0:17:21,000
Beautiful stuff.

360
0:17:22.713,000 --> 0:17:23,000
I mean this is incredible.

361
0:17:24.415,000 --> 0:17:26,000
An 11-year-old girl drew this and submitted it.

362
0:17:27.14,000 --> 0:17:28,000
It's just gorgeous.

363
0:17:28.871,000 --> 0:17:29,000
(Laughter)

364
0:17:30.419,000 --> 0:17:31,000
I'm dead serious here.

365
0:17:32.211,000 --> 0:17:33,000
This is not a joke.

366
0:17:34,000 --> 0:17:35,000
(Laughter)

367
0:17:36,000 --> 0:17:39,000
But, I think it's a really fun and wonderful thing.

368
0:17:39.319,000 --> 0:17:42,000
So this is called the "Fiction Project."

369
0:17:42.505,000 --> 0:17:43,000
This is an online space,

370
0:17:44.502,000 --> 0:17:47,000
which is basically a refurbished message board

371
0:17:48,000 --> 0:17:5,000
that encourages collaborative fiction writing.

372
0:17:50.754,000 --> 0:17:51,000
These are haikus.

373
0:17:52,000 --> 0:17:54,000
None of the haikus were written by the same person.

374
0:17:54.405,000 --> 0:17:57,000
In fact, each line is contributed by a different person

375
0:17:58.385,000 --> 0:17:59,000
at a different time.

376
0:18:,000 --> 0:18:03,000
I think that the "now tied up, tied down,

377
0:18:03.866,000 --> 0:18:05,000
mistress cruel approaches me, now tied down, it's up."

378
0:18:07,000 --> 0:18:1,000
It's an amazing way, and I'll tell you,

379
0:18:11,000 --> 0:18:16,000
if you come home, and your spouse, or whoever it is,

380
0:18:16.452,000 --> 0:18:17,000
says, "Let's talk" --

381
0:18:20.063,000 --> 0:18:23,000
That, like, chills you to the very core.

382
0:18:23.569,000 --> 0:18:24,000
(Laughter)

383
0:18:24.648,000 --> 0:18:26,000
But it's peripheral activities like these

384
0:18:26.847,000 --> 0:18:29,000
that allow people to get together, doing fun things.

385
0:18:3,000 --> 0:18:31,000
They actually get to know each other,

386
0:18:31.786,000 --> 0:18:34,000
and it's sort of like low-threshold peripheral activities

387
0:18:35.38,000 --> 0:18:36,000
that I think are the key to bringing up

388
0:18:37.37,000 --> 0:18:39,000
some of our bonding social capital that we're lacking.

389
0:18:39.918,000 --> 0:18:41,000
And very, very quickly -- I love puppets.

390
0:18:42.306,000 --> 0:18:43,000
Here's a puppet.

391
0:18:44.315,000 --> 0:18:45,000
It dances to music.

392
0:18:45.523,000 --> 0:18:49,000
Lotte Reiniger, an amazing shadow puppeteer in the 20s,

393
0:18:5,000 --> 0:18:51,000
that started doing more elaborate things.

394
0:18:51.993,000 --> 0:18:52,000
I became interested in puppets,

395
0:18:53.494,000 --> 0:18:55,000
and I just want to show one last thing to you.

396
0:18:55.707,000 --> 0:18:56,000
Oh, this is how you make puppets.

397
0:18:57.303,000 --> 0:18:58,000
(Applause)

398
0:18:58.913,000 --> 0:19:,000
Chris Anderson: Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Ze Frank.

399
0:19:01.453,000 --> 0:19:04,000
(Applause)

0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Hello, my name is Thomas Heatherwick.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I have a studio in London

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
that has a particular approach

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
to designing buildings.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
When I was growing up,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I was exposed to making

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and crafts and materials

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and invention on a small scale.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And I was there looking

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
at the larger scale of buildings

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and finding

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that the buildings that were around me

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and that were being designed

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and that were there in the publications I was seeing

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
felt soulless and cold.

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And there on the smaller scale,

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
the scale of an earring

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
or a ceramic pot

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
or a musical instrument,

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
was a materiality and a soulfulness.

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And this influenced me.

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
The first building I built was 20 years ago.

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And since, in the last 20 years,

24
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I've developed a studio in London.

25
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Sorry, this was my mother, by the way,

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
in her bead shop in London.

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I spent a lot of time counting beads and things like that.

28
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I'm just going to show, for people who don't know my studio's work,

29
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
a few projects that we've worked on.

30
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
This is a hospital building.

31
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
This is a shop for a bag company.

32
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
This is studios for artists.

33
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
This is a sculpture

34
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
made from a million yards of wire

35
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and 150,000 glass beads

36
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
the size of a golf ball.

37
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And this is a window display.

38
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And this is pair of cooling towers

39
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
for an electricity substation

40
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
next to St. Paul's Cathedral in London.

41
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And this is a temple in Japan

42
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
for a Buddhist monk.

43
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And this is a cafe by the sea

44
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
in Britain.

45
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And just very quickly,

46
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
something we've been working on very recently

47
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
is we were commissioned by the mayor of London

48
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
to design a new bus

49
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that gave the passenger

50
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
their freedom again.

51
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Because the original Routemaster bus

52
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that some of you may be familiar with,

53
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
which had this open platform at the back --

54
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
in fact, I think all our Routemasters

55
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
are here in California now actually.

56
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
But they aren't in London.

57
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And so you're stuck on a bus.

58
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And if the bus is going to stop

59
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and it's three yards away from the bus stop,

60
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
you're just a prisoner.

61
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
But the mayor of London wanted to reintroduce

62
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
buses with this open platform.

63
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So we've been working with Transport for London,

64
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
and that organization

65
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
hasn't actually been responsible

66
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
as a client for a new bus

67
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
for 50 years.

68
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And so we've been very lucky to have a chance to work.

69
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
The brief is that the bus should use 40 percent less energy.

70
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So it's got hybrid drive.

71
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And we've been working

72
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
to try to improve

73
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
everything from the fabric

74
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
to the format

75
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and structure

76
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and aesthetics.

77
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I was going to show four main projects.

78
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And this is a project for a bridge.

79
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open.

80
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And openings seemed --

81
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
everyone loves opening bridges,

82
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
but it's quite a basic thing.

83
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I think we all kind of stand and watch.

84
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
But the bridges that we saw

85
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
that opened and closed --

86
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I'm slightly squeamish --

87
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
but I once saw a photograph of a footballer

88
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
who was diving for a ball.

89
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And as he was diving, someone had stamped on his knee,

90
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and it had broken like this.

91
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And then we looked at these kinds of bridges

92
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and just couldn't help feeling

93
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that it was a beautiful thing that had broken.

94
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And so this is in Paddington in London.

95
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And it's a very boring bridge, as you can see.

96
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
It's just steel and timber.

97
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
But instead of what it is,

98
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
our focus was on the way it worked.

99
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
(Applause)

100
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So we liked the idea that the two farthest bits of it

101
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
would end up kissing each other.

102
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
(Applause)

103
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
We actually had to halve its speed,

104
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
because everyone was too scared when we first did it.

105
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So that's it speeded up.

106
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
A project that we've been working on very recently

107
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
is to design a new biomass power station --

108
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
so a power station that uses organic waste material.

109
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
In the news,

110
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
the subject of where our future water is going to come from

111
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and where our power is going to come from

112
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
is in all the papers all the time.

113
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And we used to be quite proud of the way we generated power.

114
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
But recently,

115
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
any annual report of a power company

116
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
doesn't have a power station on it.

117
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
It has a child running through a field, or something like that.

118
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Laughter)

119
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And so when a consortium of engineers approached us

120
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and asked us to work with them on this power station,

121
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
our condition was that we would work with them

122
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and that, whatever we did,

123
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
we were not just going to decorate a normal power station.

124
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And instead, we had to learn -- we kind of forced them to teach us.

125
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
And so we spent time traveling with them

126
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and learning about all the different elements,

127
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and finding that there were plenty of inefficiencies

128
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that weren't being capitalized on.

129
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
That just taking a field and banging all these things out

130
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
isn't necessarily the most efficient way that they could work.

131
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So we looked at how we could compose all those elements --

132
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
instead of just litter, create one composition.

133
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And what we found --

134
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
this area is one of the poorest parts of Britain.

135
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
It was voted the worst place in Britain to live.

136
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And there are 2,000 new homes being built

137
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
next to this power station.

138
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So it felt this has a social dimension.

139
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
It has a symbolic importance.

140
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And we should be proud of where our power is coming from,

141
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
rather than something we are necessarily ashamed of.

142
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So we were looking at how we could make a power station,

143
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
that, instead of keeping people out

144
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and having a big fence around the outside,

145
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
could be a place that pulls you in.

146
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And it has to be --

147
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I'm trying to get my --

148
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
250 feet high.

149
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So it felt that what we could try to do

150
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
is make a power park

151
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and actually bring the whole area in,

152
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and using the spare soil that's there on the site,

153
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
we could make a power station that was silent as well.

154
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Because just that soil

155
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
could make the acoustic difference.

156
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And we also found that we could make a more efficient structure

157
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and have a cost-effective way

158
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
of making a structure to do this.

159
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
The finished project

160
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
is meant to be more than just a power station.

161
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
It has a space where you could have a bar mitzvah at the top.

162
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
(Laughter)

163
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And it's a power park.

164
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So people can come and really experience this

165
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and also look out all around the area,

166
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and use that height that we have to have for its function.

167
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
In Shanghai,

168
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
we were invited to build --

169
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
well we weren't invited; what am I talking about.

170
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
We won the competition, and it was painful to get there.

171
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
(Laughter)

172
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So we won the competition to build the U.K. pavilion.

173
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
And an expo

174
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
is a totally bonkers thing.

175
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
There's 250 pavilions.

176
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
It's the world's biggest ever expo that had ever happened.

177
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So there are up to a million people there everyday.

178
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And 250 countries all competing.

179
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And the British government saying,

180
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
"You need to be in the top five."

181
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And so that became

182
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
the governmental goal --

183
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
is, how do you stand out in this chaos,

184
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
which is an expo of stimulus?

185
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So our sense was we had to do one thing,

186
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and only one thing,

187
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
instead of trying to have everything.

188
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And so what we also felt

189
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
was that whatever we did we couldn't do a cheesy advert for Britain.

190
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
(Laughter)

191
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
But the thing that was true,

192
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
the expo was about the future of cities,

193
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and particularly the Victorians

194
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
pioneered integrating nature into the cities.

195
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And the world's first public park of modern times

196
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
was in Britain.

197
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And the world's first major botanical institution

198
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
is in London,

199
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and they have this extraordinary project

200
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
where they've been collecting 25 percent

201
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
of all the world's plant species.

202
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So we suddenly realized that there was this thing.

203
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And everyone agrees that trees are beautiful,

204
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and I've never met anyone who says, "I don't like trees."

205
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And the same with flowers.

206
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
I've never met anyone who says, "I don't like flowers."

207
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
But we realized that seeds --

208
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
there's been this very serious project happening --

209
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
but that seeds --

210
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
at these major botanical gardens,

211
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
seeds aren't on show.

212
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
But you just have to go to a garden center,

213
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and they're in little paper packets.

214
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
But this phenomenal project's been happening.

215
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
So we realized we had to make a project

216
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
that would be seeds, some kind of seed cathedral.

217
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
But how could we show these teeny-weeny things?

218
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And the film "Jurassic Park" actually really helped us.

219
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Because the DNA of the dinosaur that was trapped in the amber

220
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
gave us some kind of clue

221
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
that these tiny things

222
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
could be trapped and be made to seem precious,

223
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
rather than looking like nuts.

224
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
So the challenge was,

225
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
how are we going to bring light and expose these things?

226
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
We didn't want to make a separate building and have separate content.

227
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
So we were trying to think,

228
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
how could we make a whole thing emanate.

229
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
By the way, we had half the budget of the other Western nations.

230
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
So that was also in the mix

231
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
with the site the size of a football pitch.

232
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And so there was one particular toy that gave us a clue.

233
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
(Video) Voice Over: The new Play-Doh Mop Top Hair Shop.

234
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000

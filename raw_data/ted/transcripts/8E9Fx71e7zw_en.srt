1
0:00:13,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Compassion:

2
0:00:15,000 --> 0:00:19,000
what does it look like?

3
0:00:19,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Come with me to 915 South Bloodworth Street

4
0:00:24,000 --> 0:00:28,000
in Raleigh, North Carolina, where I grew up.

5
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:31,000
If you come in you will see us: evening time,

6
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:38,000
at table -- set for ten but not always all seats filled --

7
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:42,000
at the point when dinner is ready to be served.

8
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Since mom had eight kids,

9
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:49,000
sometimes she said she couldn't tell who was who and where they were.

10
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Before we could eat, she would ask,

11
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:55,000
"Are all the children in?"

12
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And if someone happened to be missing,

13
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:05,000
we would have to, we say, "Fix a plate" for that person, put it in the oven,

14
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:09,000
then we could say grace, and we could eat.

15
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Also, while we were at the table,

16
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:15,000
there was a ritual in our family:

17
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:19,000
when something significant had happened for any one of us --

18
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:24,000
whether mom had just been elected as the president of the PTA,

19
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:3,000
or whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination,

20
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:36,000
or whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent --

21
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:4,000
the ritual at the family was, once the announcement is made,

22
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:46,000
we must take five, ten minutes to do what we call "make over" that person --

23
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that is, to make a fuss over the one who had been honored in some way.

24
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:57,000
For when one is honored, all are honored.

25
0:01:57,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Also, we had to make a report on our extended "visited" members,

26
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:08,000
that is, extended members of the family,

27
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:1,000
sick and elderly, shut in.

28
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:15,000
My task was, at least once a week, to visit Mother Lassiter

29
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:17,000
who lived on East Street,

30
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Mother Williamson who lived on Bledsoe Avenue,

31
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and Mother Lathers who lived on Oberlin Road.

32
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Why? Because they were old and infirm,

33
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and we needed to go by to see if they needed anything.

34
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:38,000
For mom said, "To be family, is to care and share and to look out for one another.

35
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:4,000
They are our family."

36
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And, of course, sometimes there was a bonus for going.

37
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:46,000
They would offer sweets or money.

38
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Mom says, "If they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them,

39
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:52,000
you must always say, 'Nothing.'

40
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And if they insist, say, 'Whatever you mind to give me.'"

41
0:02:57,000 --> 0:03:,000
This was the nature of being at that table.

42
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:05,000
In fact, she indicated that if we would do that,

43
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:1,000
not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude

44
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:12,000
from the members of the extended family,

45
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:19,000
but she said, "Even God will smile, and when God smiles,

46
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:22,000
there is peace, and justice, and joy."

47
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So, at the table at 915, I learned something about compassion.

48
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Of course, it was a minister's family,

49
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:35,000
so we had to add God into it.

50
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And so, I came to think that mama eternal, mama eternal,

51
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:47,000
is always wondering: Are all the children in?

52
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And if we had been faithful in caring and sharing,

53
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:57,000
we had the sense that justice and peace would have a chance in the world.

54
0:03:57,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Now, it was not always wonderful at that table.

55
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Let me explain a point at which we did not rise to the occasion.

56
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:09,000
It was Christmas, and at our family, oh, what a morning.

57
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Christmas morning, where we open up our gifts,

58
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:16,000
where we have special prayers, and where we get to the old upright piano

59
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and we would sing carols. It was a very intimate moment.

60
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:25,000
In fact, you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing,

61
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed,

62
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:32,000
except that daddy messed it up.

63
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:37,000
There was a member of his staff who did not have any place

64
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:41,000
on that particular Christmas to celebrate.

65
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And daddy brought Elder Revels to the Christmas family celebration.

66
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:5,000
We thought he must be out of his mind.

67
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:53,000
This is our time. This is intimate time.

68
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:55,000
This is when we can just be who we are,

69
0:04:55,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and now we have this stuffy brother

70
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:02,000
with his shirt and tie on, while we are still in our PJs.

71
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Why would daddy bring Elder Revels?

72
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Any other time, but not to the Christmas celebration.

73
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And mom overheard us and said,

74
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:2,000
"Well, you know what? If you really understand the nature of this celebration,

75
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:26,000
it is that this is a time where you extend the circle of love.

76
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
That's what the celebration is all about.

77
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:38,000
It's time to make space, to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community."

78
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So, we sucked up.

79
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:42,000
(Laughter)

80
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:49,000
But growing up at 915, compassion was not a word to be debated;

81
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:55,000
it was a sensibility to how we are together.

82
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:59,000
We are sisters and brothers united together.

83
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And, like Chief Seattle said, "We did not spin the web of life.

84
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:07,000
We're all strands in it.

85
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves."

86
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Now that's compassion.

87
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:16,000
So, let me tell you, I kind of look at the world this way.

88
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I see pictures, and something says, "Now, that's compassion."

89
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:3,000
A harvested field of grain, with some grain in the corners,

90
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:33,000
reminding me of the Hebrew tradition

91
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
that you may indeed harvest,

92
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:39,000
but you must always leave some on the edges,

93
0:06:39,000 --> 0:06:42,000
just in case there's someone who has not

94
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:47,000
had the share necessary for good nurture.

95
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Talk about a picture of compassion.

96
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I see -- always, it stirs my heart --

97
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:58,000
a picture of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

98
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:03,000
walking arm in arm with Andy Young and Rabbi Heschel

99
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and maybe Thich Nhat Hanh and some of the other saints assembled,

100
0:07:08,000 --> 0:07:12,000
walking across the bridge and going into Selma.

101
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Just a photograph.

102
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Arm in arm for struggle.

103
0:07:17,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Suffering together in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters

104
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:29,000
without the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity

105
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:33,000
robbing us of a sense of unity of being.

106
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
So, there's another picture. Here, this one. I really do like this picture.

107
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:42,000
When Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated,

108
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that day, everybody in my community was upset.

109
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:54,000
You heard about riots all across the land.

110
0:07:54,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Bobby Kennedy was scheduled to bring an inner city message in Indianapolis.

111
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:06,000
This is the picture. They said,

112
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:09,000
"It's going to be too volatile for you to go."

113
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:12,000
He insisted, "I must go."

114
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:16,000
So, sitting on a flatbed truck,

115
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
the elders of the community are there,

116
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and Bobby stands up and says to the people,

117
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:24,000
"I have bad news for you.

118
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Some of you may not have heard that Dr. King has been assassinated.

119
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I know that you are angry,

120
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and I know that you would almost wish to have the opportunity

121
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:37,000
to enter now into activities of revenge. But,"

122
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:44,000
he said, "what I really want you to know is that I know how you feel.

123
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Because I had someone dear to me snatched away.

124
0:08:5,000 --> 0:08:53,000
I know how you feel."

125
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And he said, "I hope that you will have the strength to do what I did.

126
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I allowed my anger, my bitterness, my grief to simmer a while,

127
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and then I made up my mind that I was going to make a different world,

128
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and we can do that together."

129
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:16,000
That's a picture. Compassion? I think I see it.

130
0:09:16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
I saw it when the Dalai Lama came to the Riverside Church while I was a pastor,

131
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world.

132
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:33,000
He asked them to give a message,

133
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and they each read in their own language a central affirmation,

134
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and that was some version of the golden rule:

135
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:49,000
"As you would that others would do unto you,

136
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:54,000
do also unto them."

137
0:09:54,000 --> 0:10:,000
Twelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire

138
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:03,000
affirming one message.

139
0:10:03,000 --> 0:10:07,000
We are so connected that we must treat each other

140
0:10:07,000 --> 0:10:13,000
as if an action toward you is an action toward myself.

141
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:18,000
One more picture while I'm stinking and thinking about the Riverside Church:

142
0:10:18,000 --> 0:10:24,000
9/11. Last night at Chagrin Fall,

143
0:10:24,000 --> 0:10:28,000
a newspaperman and a television guy said,

144
0:10:28,000 --> 0:10:34,000
"That evening, when a service was held at the Riverside Church,

145
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:38,000
we carried it on our station in this city.

146
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:46,000
It was," he said, "one of the most powerful moments of life together.

147
0:10:46,000 --> 0:10:48,000
We were all suffering.

148
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:54,000
But you invited representatives of all of the traditions to come,

149
0:10:54,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and you invited them.

150
0:10:56,000 --> 0:11:,000
'Find out what it is in your tradition

151
0:11:,000 --> 0:11:04,000
that tells us what to do when we have been humiliated,

152
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:08,000
when we have been despised and rejected.'

153
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And they all spoke out of their own traditions,

154
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:18,000
a word about the healing power of solidarity, one with the other."

155
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I developed a sense of compassion sort of as second nature,

156
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:27,000
but I became a preacher.

157
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Now, as a preacher, I got a job. I got to preach the stuff,

158
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:33,000
but I got to do it too.

159
0:11:33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Or, as Father Divine in Harlem used to say to folks,

160
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:4,000
"Some people preach the Gospel.

161
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:42,000
I have to tangibilitate the Gospel."

162
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:48,000
So, the real issue is: How do you tangibilitate compassion?

163
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:51,000
How do you make it real?

164
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:55,000
My faith has constantly lifted up the ideal,

165
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and challenged me when I fell beneath it.

166
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:05,000
In my tradition, there is a gift that we have made to other traditions --

167
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:13,000
to everybody around the world who knows the story of the "Good Samaritan."

168
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Many people think of it primarily in terms of charity,

169
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:23,000
random acts of kindness.

170
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:29,000
But for those who really study that text a little more thoroughly,

171
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:32,000
you will discover that a question has been raised

172
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:34,000
that leads to this parable.

173
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:38,000
The question was: "What is the greatest commandment?"

174
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And, according to Jesus, the word comes forth,

175
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:43,000
"You must love yourself,

176
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:47,000
you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind and soul,

177
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and your neighbor as yourself."

178
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And then the person asked, "Well, what do you mean, 'neighbor?'"

179
0:12:57,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And he answered it by telling the story of the man who fell among thieves,

180
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and how religious authorities went the other way,

181
0:13:09,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and how their supporters in the congregation went the other way;

182
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:18,000
but an unsuspecting, despised person came along,

183
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:21,000
saw the man in need,

184
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:25,000
provided oil and wine for his wounds,

185
0:13:25,000 --> 0:13:3,000
put him on his own transportation,

186
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and took him to the inn

187
0:13:33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and asked the innkeeper, "Take care of him."

188
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:44,000
And he said, "Here, this is the initial investment,

189
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:5,000
but if needs continue, make sure that you provide them.

190
0:13:5,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And whatever else is needed, I will provide it and pay for it when I return."

191
0:13:57,000 --> 0:14:,000
This always seemed to me to be a deepening

192
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:04,000
of the sense of what it means to be a Good Samaritan.

193
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:07,000
A Good Samaritan is not simply one whose heart is touched

194
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:11,000
in an immediate act of care and charity,

195
0:14:11,000 --> 0:14:15,000
but one who provides a system of sustained care -- I like that,

196
0:14:15,000 --> 0:14:19,000
'a system of sustained care ' -- in the inn, take care.

197
0:14:19,000 --> 0:14:24,000
I think maybe it's one time when the Bible talks about a healthcare system

198
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and a commitment to do whatever is necessary --

199
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:31,000
that all God's children would have their needs cared for,

200
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:37,000
so that we could answer when mommy eternal asks, "In regards to health,

201
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:4,000
are all the children in?" And we could say yes.

202
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Oh, what a joy it has been to be a person seeking to tangibilitate compassion.

203
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:52,000
I recall that my work as a pastor

204
0:14:52,000 --> 0:14:57,000
has always involved caring for their spiritual needs;

205
0:14:57,000 --> 0:15:01,000
being concerned for housing, for healthcare,

206
0:15:01,000 --> 0:15:05,000
for the prisoners, for the infirm, for children --

207
0:15:05,000 --> 0:15:11,000
even the foster care children for whom no one can even keep a record

208
0:15:11,000 --> 0:15:13,000
where they started off, where they are going.

209
0:15:13,000 --> 0:15:18,000
To be a pastor is to care for these individual needs.

210
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:22,000
But now, to be a Good Samaritan -- and I always say,

211
0:15:22,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and to be a good American -- for me,

212
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:3,000
is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care.

213
0:15:3,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Compassion takes on a corporate dynamic.

214
0:15:35,000 --> 0:15:42,000
I believe that whatever we did around that table at Bloodworth Street

215
0:15:42,000 --> 0:15:47,000
must be done around tables and rituals of faith

216
0:15:47,000 --> 0:15:53,000
until we become that family, that family together

217
0:15:53,000 --> 0:15:56,000
that understands the nature of our unity.

218
0:15:56,000 --> 0:16:,000
We are one people together.

219
0:16:,000 --> 0:16:06,000
So, let me explain to you what I mean when I think about compassion,

220
0:16:06,000 --> 0:16:12,000
and why I think it is so important that right at this point in history.

221
0:16:12,000 --> 0:16:17,000
We would decide to establish this charter of compassion.

222
0:16:17,000 --> 0:16:27,000
The reason it's important is because this is a very special time in history.

223
0:16:27,000 --> 0:16:31,000
It is the time that, biblically, we would speak of as

224
0:16:31,000 --> 0:16:35,000
the day, or the year, of God's favor.

225
0:16:35,000 --> 0:16:37,000
This is a season of grace.

226
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:41,000
Unusual things are beginning to happen.

227
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Please pardon me, as a black man, for celebrating

228
0:16:43,000 --> 0:16:48,000
that the election of Obama was an unusual sign

229
0:16:48,000 --> 0:16:52,000
of the fact that it is a year of favor.

230
0:16:52,000 --> 0:16:59,000
And yet, there is so much more that needs to be done.

231
0:16:59,000 --> 0:17:04,000
We need to bring health and food and education

232
0:17:04,000 --> 0:17:1,000
and respect for all God's citizens, all God's children,

233
0:17:1,000 --> 0:17:13,000
remembering mama eternal.

234
0:17:13,000 --> 0:17:17,000
Now, let me close my comments by telling you

235
0:17:17,000 --> 0:17:21,000
that whenever I feel something very deeply,

236
0:17:21,000 --> 0:17:25,000
it usually takes the form of verse.

237
0:17:25,000 --> 0:17:29,000
And so I want to close with a little song.

238
0:17:29,000 --> 0:17:33,000
I close with this song -- it's a children's song --

239
0:17:33,000 --> 0:17:39,000
because we are all children at the table of mama eternal.

240
0:17:39,000 --> 0:17:43,000
And if mama eternal has taught us correctly,

241
0:17:43,000 --> 0:17:49,000
this song will make sense, not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering,

242
0:17:49,000 --> 0:17:52,000
but to all who sign the charter for compassion.

243
0:17:52,000 --> 0:17:54,000
And this is why we do it.

244
0:17:54,000 --> 0:17:58,000

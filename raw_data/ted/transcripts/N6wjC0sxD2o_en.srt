1
0:00:12.417,000 --> 0:00:15,000
In an age of global strife and climate change,

2
0:00:15.644,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm here to answer the all important question:

3
0:00:19.13,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Why is sex so damn good?

4
0:00:22.225,000 --> 0:00:23,000
If you're laughing, you know what I mean.

5
0:00:24.202,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Now, before we get to that answer,

6
0:00:26.064,000 --> 0:00:28,000
let me tell you about Chris Hosmer.

7
0:00:28.282,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Chris is a great friend of mine from my university days,

8
0:00:30.973,000 --> 0:00:32,000
but secretly, I hate him.

9
0:00:33.837,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Here's why. Back in university, we had a quick project

10
0:00:36.757,000 --> 0:00:37,000
to design some solar-powered clocks.

11
0:00:38.739,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Here's my clock.

12
0:00:40.293,000 --> 0:00:42,000
It uses something called the dwarf sunflower,

13
0:00:42.77,000 --> 0:00:44,000
which grows to about 12 inches in height.

14
0:00:45.116,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Now, as you know, sunflowers

15
0:00:47.182,000 --> 0:00:49,000
track the sun during the course of the day.

16
0:00:49.418,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So in the morning, you see which direction the sunflower is facing,

17
0:00:52.78,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and you mark it on the blank area in the base.

18
0:00:55.97,000 --> 0:00:57,000
At noon, you mark the changed position of the sunflower,

19
0:00:58.921,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and in the evening again, and that's your clock.

20
0:01:02.293,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Now, I know my clock doesn't tell you the exact time,

21
0:01:04.879,000 --> 0:01:06,000
but it does give you a general idea using a flower.

22
0:01:07.607,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So, in my completely unbiased, subjective opinion,

23
0:01:10.723,000 --> 0:01:11,000
it's brilliant.

24
0:01:12.442,000 --> 0:01:14,000
However, here's Chris's clock.

25
0:01:15.268,000 --> 0:01:19,000
It's five magnifying glasses with a shot glass under each one.

26
0:01:19.319,000 --> 0:01:21,000
In each shot glass is a different scented oil.

27
0:01:22.24,000 --> 0:01:23,000
In the morning, the sunlight will shine down

28
0:01:23.759,000 --> 0:01:24,000
on the first magnifying glass,

29
0:01:25.418,000 --> 0:01:28,000
focusing a beam of light on the shot glass underneath.

30
0:01:28.448,000 --> 0:01:3,000
This will warm up the scented oil inside,

31
0:01:30.647,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and a particular smell will be emitted.

32
0:01:33.231,000 --> 0:01:35,000
A couple of hours later, the sun will shine

33
0:01:35.303,000 --> 0:01:38,000
on the next magnifying glass, and a different smell will be emitted.

34
0:01:38.6,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So during the course of the day, five different smells

35
0:01:41.281,000 --> 0:01:43,000
are dispersed throughout that environment.

36
0:01:43.316,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Anyone living in that house can tell the time

37
0:01:46.056,000 --> 0:01:48,000
just by the smell.

38
0:01:48.528,000 --> 0:01:5,000
You can see why I hate Chris.

39
0:01:50.881,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I thought my idea was pretty good,

40
0:01:52.525,000 --> 0:01:54,000
but his idea is genius,

41
0:01:54.916,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and at the time, I knew his idea was better than mine,

42
0:01:57.537,000 --> 0:01:59,000
but I just couldn't explain why.

43
0:02:00.359,000 --> 0:02:03,000
One thing you have to know about me is I hate to lose.

44
0:02:03.889,000 --> 0:02:06,000
This problem's been bugging me for well over a decade.

45
0:02:07.751,000 --> 0:02:1,000
All right, let's get back to the question of why sex is so good.

46
0:02:11.111,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Many years after the solar powered clocks project,

47
0:02:13.972,000 --> 0:02:16,000
a young lady I knew suggested maybe sex is so good

48
0:02:17.676,000 --> 0:02:18,000
because of the five senses.

49
0:02:19.616,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And when she said this, I had an epiphany.

50
0:02:22.425,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So I decided to evaluate different experiences I had in my life

51
0:02:26.156,000 --> 0:02:28,000
from the point of view of the five senses.

52
0:02:28.644,000 --> 0:02:31,000
To do this, I devised something called the five senses graph.

53
0:02:32.354,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Along the y-axis, you have a scale from zero to 10,

54
0:02:35.439,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and along the x-axis, you have, of course, the five senses.

55
0:02:38.786,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Anytime I had a memorable experience in my life,

56
0:02:41.37,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I would record it on this graph like a five senses diary.

57
0:02:45.365,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Here's a quick video to show you how it works.

58
0:02:48.557,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Video) Jinsop Lee: Hey, my name's Jinsop,

59
0:02:51.373,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and today, I'm going to show you what riding motorbikes

60
0:02:54.017,000 --> 0:02:57,000
is like from the point of view of the five senses. Hey!

61
0:02:57.302,000 --> 0:03:,000
Bike designer: This is [unclear], custom bike designer.

62
0:03:00.908,000 --> 0:03:05,000
(Motorcyle revving)

63
0:03:06.731,000 --> 0:03:09,000
[Sound]

64
0:03:27.119,000 --> 0:03:3,000
[Touch]

65
0:03:36.75,000 --> 0:03:38,000
[Sight]

66
0:03:47.686,000 --> 0:03:49,000
[Smell]

67
0:03:55.301,000 --> 0:03:57,000
[Taste]

68
0:04:01.037,000 --> 0:04:03,000
JL: And that's how the five senses graph works.

69
0:04:03.962,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Now, for a period of three years, I gathered data,

70
0:04:07.311,000 --> 0:04:09,000
not just me but also some of my friends,

71
0:04:10.067,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and I used to teach in university, so I forced my --

72
0:04:12.568,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I mean, I asked my students to do this as well.

73
0:04:15.253,000 --> 0:04:17,000
So here are some other results.

74
0:04:17.883,000 --> 0:04:19,000
The first is for instant noodles.

75
0:04:20.12,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Now obviously, taste and smell are quite high,

76
0:04:23.18,000 --> 0:04:27,000
but notice sound is at three.

77
0:04:27.299,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Many people told me a big part

78
0:04:28.875,000 --> 0:04:3,000
of the noodle-eating experience is the slurping noise.

79
0:04:31.897,000 --> 0:04:33,000
You know. (Slurps)

80
0:04:34.279,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Needless to say, I no longer dine with these people.

81
0:04:37.098,000 --> 0:04:39,000
OK, next, clubbing.

82
0:04:39.435,000 --> 0:04:42,000
OK, here what I found interesting was

83
0:04:43.156,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that taste is at four, and many respondents told me

84
0:04:47.825,000 --> 0:04:48,000
it's because of the taste of drinks,

85
0:04:49.564,000 --> 0:04:53,000
but also, in some cases, kissing is a big part of the clubbing experience.

86
0:04:53.985,000 --> 0:04:55,000
These people I still do hang out with.

87
0:04:56.793,000 --> 0:04:58,000
All right, and smoking.

88
0:04:59.137,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Here I found touch is at [six], and one of the reasons

89
0:05:04.184,000 --> 0:05:07,000
is that smokers told me the sensation of holding a cigarette

90
0:05:07.54,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and bringing it up to your lips is a big part of the smoking experience,

91
0:05:11.237,000 --> 0:05:13,000
which shows, it's kind of scary to think

92
0:05:13.916,000 --> 0:05:16,000
how well cigarettes are designed by the manufacturers.

93
0:05:17.126,000 --> 0:05:2,000
OK. Now, what would the perfect experience

94
0:05:20.507,000 --> 0:05:22,000
look like on the five senses graph?

95
0:05:22.986,000 --> 0:05:25,000
It would, of course, be a horizontal line along the top.

96
0:05:26.507,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Now you can see, not even as intense an experience

97
0:05:29.087,000 --> 0:05:31,000
as riding a motorbike comes close.

98
0:05:31.32,000 --> 0:05:33,000
In fact, in the years that I gathered data,

99
0:05:33.862,000 --> 0:05:36,000
only one experience came close to being the perfect one.

100
0:05:37.1,000 --> 0:05:4,000
That is, of course, sex. Great sex.

101
0:05:40.725,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Respondents said that great sex

102
0:05:42.414,000 --> 0:05:45,000
hits all of the five senses at an extreme level.

103
0:05:46.269,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Here I'll quote one of my students who said,

104
0:05:48.389,000 --> 0:05:52,000
"Sex is so good, it's good even when it's bad."

105
0:05:52.626,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So the five senses theory does help explain

106
0:05:55.939,000 --> 0:05:57,000
why sex is so good.

107
0:05:58.056,000 --> 0:06:,000
Now in the middle of all this five senses work,

108
0:06:00.905,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I suddenly remembered the solar-powered clocks project

109
0:06:03.714,000 --> 0:06:04,000
from my youth.

110
0:06:04.791,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And I realized this theory also explains why Chris's clock

111
0:06:07.783,000 --> 0:06:08,000
is so much better than mine.

112
0:06:09.664,000 --> 0:06:12,000
You see, my clock only focuses on sight,

113
0:06:12.793,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and a little bit of touch.

114
0:06:15.231,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Here's Chris's clock.

115
0:06:17.214,000 --> 0:06:21,000
It's the first clock ever that uses smell to tell the time.

116
0:06:21.863,000 --> 0:06:23,000
In fact, in terms of the five senses,

117
0:06:23.929,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Chris's clock is a revolution.

118
0:06:26.942,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And that's what this theory taught me about my field.

119
0:06:29.58,000 --> 0:06:3,000
You see, up till now, us designers,

120
0:06:31.479,000 --> 0:06:33,000
we've mainly focused on making things look very pretty,

121
0:06:34.485,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and a little bit of touch,

122
0:06:36.281,000 --> 0:06:39,000
which means we've ignored the other three senses.

123
0:06:39.46,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Chris's clock shows us that even raising just one

124
0:06:41.93,000 --> 0:06:44,000
of those other senses can make for a brilliant product.

125
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So what if we started using the five senses theory

126
0:06:49.361,000 --> 0:06:5,000
in all of our designs?

127
0:06:50.596,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Here's three quick ideas I came up with.

128
0:06:53.321,000 --> 0:06:55,000
This is an iron, you know, for your clothes,

129
0:06:55.924,000 --> 0:06:57,000
to which I added a spraying mechanism,

130
0:06:58.693,000 --> 0:07:,000
so you fill up the vial with your favorite scent,

131
0:07:01.244,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and your clothes will smell nicer,

132
0:07:03.112,000 --> 0:07:04,000
but hopefully it should also make

133
0:07:04.708,000 --> 0:07:05,000
the ironing experience more enjoyable.

134
0:07:06.716,000 --> 0:07:09,000
We could call this "the perfumator."

135
0:07:09.888,000 --> 0:07:1,000
All right, next.

136
0:07:11.373,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So I brush my teeth twice a day,

137
0:07:13.416,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and what if we had a toothbrush

138
0:07:15.822,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that tastes like candy,

139
0:07:17.518,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and when the taste of candy ran out,

140
0:07:19.993,000 --> 0:07:21,000
you'd know it's time to change your toothbrush?

141
0:07:22.953,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Finally, I have a thing for the keys on a flute or a clarinet.

142
0:07:27.532,000 --> 0:07:3,000
It's not just the way they look, but I love the way they feel

143
0:07:30.958,000 --> 0:07:32,000
when you press down on them.

144
0:07:33.188,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Now, I don't play the flute or the clarinet,

145
0:07:35.328,000 --> 0:07:39,000
so I decided to combine these keys with an instrument I do play:

146
0:07:39.464,000 --> 0:07:42,000
the television remote control.

147
0:07:42.675,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Now, when we look at these three ideas together,

148
0:07:45.967,000 --> 0:07:47,000
you'll notice that the five senses theory

149
0:07:48.887,000 --> 0:07:5,000
doesn't only change the way we use these products

150
0:07:51.891,000 --> 0:07:53,000
but also the way they look.

151
0:07:54.71,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So in conclusion, I've found the five senses theory

152
0:07:58.762,000 --> 0:08:,000
to be a very useful tool in evaluating

153
0:08:01.323,000 --> 0:08:02,000
different experiences in my life,

154
0:08:02.919,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and then taking those best experiences

155
0:08:05.867,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and hopefully incorporating them into my designs.

156
0:08:08.515,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Now, I realize the five senses isn't the only thing

157
0:08:12.432,000 --> 0:08:13,000
that makes life interesting.

158
0:08:14.35,000 --> 0:08:16,000
There's also the six emotions

159
0:08:16.569,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and that elusive x-factor.

160
0:08:20.133,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Maybe that could be the topic of my next talk.

161
0:08:23.883,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Until then, please have fun

162
0:08:26.292,000 --> 0:08:28,000
using the five senses in your own lives

163
0:08:28.691,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and your own designs.

164
0:08:30.411,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Oh, one last thing before I leave.

165
0:08:33.196,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Here's the experience you all had while listening

166
0:08:35.506,000 --> 0:08:36,000
to the TED Talks.

167
0:08:36.755,000 --> 0:08:38,000
However, it would be better if we could boost up

168
0:08:39.067,000 --> 0:08:42,000
a couple of the other senses like smell and taste.

169
0:08:42.731,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And the best way to do that is with

170
0:08:45.783,000 --> 0:08:46,000
free candy.

171
0:08:47.436,000 --> 0:08:48,000
You guys ready?

172
0:08:49.179,000 --> 0:08:5,000
All right.

173
0:08:52.504,000 --> 0:08:57,000
(Applause)

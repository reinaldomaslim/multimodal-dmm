1
0:00:13.008,000 --> 0:00:14,000
When people think about cities,

2
0:00:14.698,000 --> 0:00:16,000
they tend to think of certain things.

3
0:00:17,000 --> 0:00:19,000
They think of buildings and streets

4
0:00:19.06,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and skyscrapers, noisy cabs.

5
0:00:21.956,000 --> 0:00:22,000
But when I think about cities,

6
0:00:23.89,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I think about people.

7
0:00:25.691,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Cities are fundamentally about people,

8
0:00:29.161,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and where people go

9
0:00:31.005,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and where people meet

10
0:00:32.52,000 --> 0:00:35,000
are at the core of what makes a city work.

11
0:00:35.85,000 --> 0:00:38,000
So even more important than buildings in a city

12
0:00:39.03,000 --> 0:00:42,000
are the public spaces in between them.

13
0:00:42.038,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And today, some of the most transformative

14
0:00:44.696,000 --> 0:00:45,000
changes in cities

15
0:00:46.373,000 --> 0:00:49,000
are happening in these public spaces.

16
0:00:49.559,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So I believe that lively, enjoyable public spaces

17
0:00:53.752,000 --> 0:00:56,000
are the key to planning a great city.

18
0:00:56.872,000 --> 0:00:59,000
They are what makes it come alive.

19
0:01:00.292,000 --> 0:01:03,000
But what makes a public space work?

20
0:01:03.972,000 --> 0:01:06,000
What attracts people to successful public spaces,

21
0:01:07.523,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and what is it about unsuccessful places

22
0:01:09.945,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that keeps people away?

23
0:01:12.625,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I thought, if I could answer those questions,

24
0:01:15.984,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I could make a huge contribution to my city.

25
0:01:19.764,000 --> 0:01:21,000
But one of the more wonky things about me

26
0:01:21.918,000 --> 0:01:24,000
is that I am an animal behaviorist,

27
0:01:25.469,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and I use those skills not to study animal behavior

28
0:01:29.046,000 --> 0:01:31,000
but to study how people in cities

29
0:01:31.98,000 --> 0:01:33,000
use city public spaces.

30
0:01:34.228,000 --> 0:01:37,000
One of the first spaces that I studied

31
0:01:37.549,000 --> 0:01:4,000
was this little vest pocket park called Paley Park

32
0:01:40.954,000 --> 0:01:42,000
in midtown Manhattan.

33
0:01:43.262,000 --> 0:01:47,000
This little space became a small phenomenon,

34
0:01:47.387,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and because it had such a profound impact

35
0:01:50.255,000 --> 0:01:51,000
on New Yorkers,

36
0:01:51.471,000 --> 0:01:55,000
it made an enormous impression on me.

37
0:01:55.555,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I studied this park very early on in my career

38
0:01:58.052,000 --> 0:01:59,000
because it happened to have been built

39
0:01:59.638,000 --> 0:02:,000
by my stepfather,

40
0:02:01.416,000 --> 0:02:03,000
so I knew that places like Paley Park

41
0:02:04.048,000 --> 0:02:06,000
didn't happen by accident.

42
0:02:06.448,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I saw firsthand that they required

43
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:1,000
incredible dedication

44
0:02:10.456,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and enormous attention to detail.

45
0:02:13.514,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But what was it about this space

46
0:02:15.248,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that made it special and drew people to it?

47
0:02:19.05,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Well, I would sit in the park and watch very carefully,

48
0:02:21.951,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and first among other things

49
0:02:23.843,000 --> 0:02:26,000
were the comfortable, movable chairs.

50
0:02:26.906,000 --> 0:02:28,000
People would come in, find their own seat,

51
0:02:29.416,000 --> 0:02:32,000
move it a bit, actually, and then stay a while,

52
0:02:32.81,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and then interestingly,

53
0:02:34.658,000 --> 0:02:36,000
people themselves attracted other people,

54
0:02:37.633,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and ironically, I felt more peaceful

55
0:02:40.41,000 --> 0:02:41,000
if there were other people around.

56
0:02:42.391,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And it was green.

57
0:02:44.281,000 --> 0:02:47,000
This little park provided what New Yorkers crave:

58
0:02:48.042,000 --> 0:02:5,000
comfort and greenery.

59
0:02:50.58,000 --> 0:02:51,000
But my question was,

60
0:02:52.268,000 --> 0:02:55,000
why weren't there more places with greenery

61
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and places to sit in the middle of the city

62
0:02:57.839,000 --> 0:02:59,000
where you didn't feel alone,

63
0:03:00.319,000 --> 0:03:02,000
or like a trespasser?

64
0:03:02.776,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Unfortunately, that's not how cities

65
0:03:05.008,000 --> 0:03:07,000
were being designed.

66
0:03:07.026,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So here you see a familiar sight.

67
0:03:10.72,000 --> 0:03:14,000
This is how plazas have been designed for generations.

68
0:03:15.001,000 --> 0:03:18,000
They have that stylish, Spartan look

69
0:03:18.131,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that we often associate with modern architecture,

70
0:03:21.951,000 --> 0:03:23,000
but it's not surprising that people

71
0:03:24.262,000 --> 0:03:25,000
avoid spaces like this.

72
0:03:26.124,000 --> 0:03:28,000
They not only look desolate,

73
0:03:28.234,000 --> 0:03:3,000
they feel downright dangerous.

74
0:03:30.946,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I mean, where would you sit here?

75
0:03:34.223,000 --> 0:03:36,000
What would you do here?

76
0:03:36.769,000 --> 0:03:39,000
But architects love them.

77
0:03:40.245,000 --> 0:03:43,000
They are plinths for their creations.

78
0:03:43.518,000 --> 0:03:44,000
They might tolerate a sculpture or two,

79
0:03:45.451,000 --> 0:03:46,000
but that's about it.

80
0:03:47.204,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And for developers, they are ideal.

81
0:03:50.408,000 --> 0:03:52,000
There's nothing to water, nothing to maintain,

82
0:03:52.995,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and no undesirable people to worry about.

83
0:03:56.955,000 --> 0:03:59,000
But don't you think this is a waste?

84
0:04:00.199,000 --> 0:04:02,000
For me, becoming a city planner

85
0:04:02.52,000 --> 0:04:04,000
meant being able to truly change the city

86
0:04:05.192,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that I lived in and loved.

87
0:04:07.682,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I wanted to be able to create places

88
0:04:10.17,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that would give you the feeling that you got

89
0:04:12.135,000 --> 0:04:13,000
in Paley Park,

90
0:04:13.673,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and not allow developers to build bleak plazas like this.

91
0:04:18.461,000 --> 0:04:19,000
But over the many years,

92
0:04:19.876,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I have learned how hard it is

93
0:04:22.472,000 --> 0:04:24,000
to create successful, meaningful,

94
0:04:25.06,000 --> 0:04:27,000
enjoyable public spaces.

95
0:04:27.088,000 --> 0:04:28,000
As I learned from my stepfather,

96
0:04:28.665,000 --> 0:04:3,000
they certainly do not happen by accident,

97
0:04:30.953,000 --> 0:04:32,000
especially in a city like New York,

98
0:04:33.781,000 --> 0:04:36,000
where public space has to be fought for to begin with,

99
0:04:37.06,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and then for them to be successful,

100
0:04:39.168,000 --> 0:04:41,000
somebody has to think very hard

101
0:04:41.19,000 --> 0:04:43,000
about every detail.

102
0:04:43.214,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Now, open spaces in cities are opportunities.

103
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Yes, they are opportunities for commercial investment,

104
0:04:50.964,000 --> 0:04:53,000
but they are also opportunities for the common good

105
0:04:54.533,000 --> 0:04:55,000
of the city,

106
0:04:56.299,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and those two goals are often not aligned with one another,

107
0:04:59.814,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and therein lies the conflict.

108
0:05:02.423,000 --> 0:05:04,000
The first opportunity I had to fight

109
0:05:05.075,000 --> 0:05:08,000
for a great public open space was in the early 1980s,

110
0:05:08.237,000 --> 0:05:1,000
when I was leading a team of planners

111
0:05:10.575,000 --> 0:05:13,000
at a gigantic landfill called Battery Park City

112
0:05:13.887,000 --> 0:05:15,000
in lower Manhattan on the Hudson River.

113
0:05:16.5,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And this sandy wasteland had lain barren

114
0:05:19.314,000 --> 0:05:2,000
for 10 years,

115
0:05:20.764,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and we were told, unless we found a developer

116
0:05:23.408,000 --> 0:05:25,000
in six months, it would go bankrupt.

117
0:05:25.536,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So we came up with a radical,

118
0:05:27.537,000 --> 0:05:29,000
almost insane idea.

119
0:05:29.927,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Instead of building a park

120
0:05:31.775,000 --> 0:05:33,000
as a complement to future development,

121
0:05:34.283,000 --> 0:05:36,000
why don't we reverse that equation

122
0:05:36.368,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and build a small but very high-quality

123
0:05:39.421,000 --> 0:05:4,000
public open space first,

124
0:05:41.406,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and see if that made a difference.

125
0:05:44.412,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So we only could afford to build a two-block section

126
0:05:48.11,000 --> 0:05:51,000
of what would become a mile-long esplanade,

127
0:05:51.57,000 --> 0:05:53,000
so whatever we built had to be perfect.

128
0:05:54.537,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So just to make sure, I insisted

129
0:05:57.533,000 --> 0:05:59,000
that we build a mock-up

130
0:05:59.75,000 --> 0:06:02,000
in wood, at scale, of the railing and the sea wall.

131
0:06:03.684,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And when I sat down on that test bench

132
0:06:06.708,000 --> 0:06:09,000
with sand still swirling all around me,

133
0:06:09.906,000 --> 0:06:12,000
the railing hit exactly at eye level,

134
0:06:12.999,000 --> 0:06:14,000
blocking my view and ruining my experience

135
0:06:15.99,000 --> 0:06:17,000
at the water's edge.

136
0:06:18.12,000 --> 0:06:21,000
So you see, details really do make a difference.

137
0:06:21.427,000 --> 0:06:24,000
But design is not just how something looks,

138
0:06:25.358,000 --> 0:06:3,000
it's how your body feels on that seat in that space,

139
0:06:31.25,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and I believe that successful design always depends

140
0:06:34.39,000 --> 0:06:37,000
on that very individual experience.

141
0:06:37.815,000 --> 0:06:41,000
In this photo, everything looks very finished,

142
0:06:42.186,000 --> 0:06:44,000
but that granite edge, those lights,

143
0:06:44.904,000 --> 0:06:45,000
the back on that bench,

144
0:06:46.792,000 --> 0:06:47,000
the trees in planting,

145
0:06:48.486,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and the many different kinds of places to sit

146
0:06:51.089,000 --> 0:06:54,000
were all little battles that turned this project

147
0:06:54.271,000 --> 0:06:58,000
into a place that people wanted to be.

148
0:06:58.315,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Now, this proved very valuable 20 years later

149
0:07:02.15,000 --> 0:07:04,000
when Michael Bloomberg asked me to be

150
0:07:04.158,000 --> 0:07:05,000
his planning commissioner

151
0:07:05.74,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and put me in charge of shaping

152
0:07:07.587,000 --> 0:07:09,000
the entire city of New York.

153
0:07:09.658,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And he said to me on that very day,

154
0:07:11.757,000 --> 0:07:13,000
he said that New York was projected

155
0:07:13.853,000 --> 0:07:16,000
to grow from eight to nine million people.

156
0:07:16.91,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And he asked me,

157
0:07:18.44,000 --> 0:07:19,000
"So where are you going to put

158
0:07:20.283,000 --> 0:07:22,000
one million additional New Yorkers?"

159
0:07:22.999,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Well, I didn't have any idea.

160
0:07:25.644,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Now, you know that New York does

161
0:07:28.683,000 --> 0:07:3,000
place a high value on attracting immigrants,

162
0:07:31.381,000 --> 0:07:33,000
so we were excited about the prospect of growth,

163
0:07:34.301,000 --> 0:07:36,000
but honestly, where were we going to grow

164
0:07:37.18,000 --> 0:07:4,000
in a city that was already built out to its edges

165
0:07:40.574,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and surrounded by water?

166
0:07:43.374,000 --> 0:07:44,000
How were we going to find housing

167
0:07:44.976,000 --> 0:07:46,000
for that many new New Yorkers?

168
0:07:47.274,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And if we couldn't spread out,

169
0:07:49.087,000 --> 0:07:5,000
which was probably a good thing,

170
0:07:50.901,000 --> 0:07:52,000
where could new housing go?

171
0:07:53.72,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And what about cars?

172
0:07:55.353,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Our city couldn't possibly handle any more cars.

173
0:07:59.465,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So what were we going to do?

174
0:08:02.299,000 --> 0:08:05,000
If we couldn't spread out, we had to go up.

175
0:08:06.276,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And if we had to go up,

176
0:08:07.31,000 --> 0:08:08,000
we had to go up in places

177
0:08:09.092,000 --> 0:08:11,000
where you wouldn't need to own a car.

178
0:08:11.101,000 --> 0:08:13,000
So that meant using one of our greatest assets:

179
0:08:13.964,000 --> 0:08:15,000
our transit system.

180
0:08:16.416,000 --> 0:08:17,000
But we had never before thought

181
0:08:17.989,000 --> 0:08:19,000
of how we could make the most of it.

182
0:08:20.225,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So here was the answer to our puzzle.

183
0:08:23.438,000 --> 0:08:26,000
If we were to channel and redirect

184
0:08:27.069,000 --> 0:08:29,000
all new development around transit,

185
0:08:29.363,000 --> 0:08:32,000
we could actually handle that population increase,

186
0:08:32.99,000 --> 0:08:33,000
we thought.

187
0:08:34.264,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And so here was the plan,

188
0:08:36.822,000 --> 0:08:37,000
what we really needed to do:

189
0:08:38.47,000 --> 0:08:4,000
We needed to redo our zoning --

190
0:08:41.318,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and zoning is the city planner's regulatory tool --

191
0:08:44.669,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and basically reshape the entire city,

192
0:08:47.98,000 --> 0:08:49,000
targeting where new development could go

193
0:08:50.125,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and prohibiting any development at all

194
0:08:52.316,000 --> 0:08:53,000
in our car-oriented,

195
0:08:54.03,000 --> 0:08:56,000
suburban-style neighborhoods.

196
0:08:56.192,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Well, this was an unbelievably ambitious idea,

197
0:08:59.924,000 --> 0:09:01,000
ambitious because communities

198
0:09:02.5,000 --> 0:09:05,000
had to approve those plans.

199
0:09:06.115,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So how was I going to get this done?

200
0:09:09.134,000 --> 0:09:11,000
By listening. So I began listening,

201
0:09:12.042,000 --> 0:09:15,000
in fact, thousands of hours of listening

202
0:09:15.396,000 --> 0:09:16,000
just to establish trust.

203
0:09:17.214,000 --> 0:09:19,000
You know, communities can tell

204
0:09:19.303,000 --> 0:09:21,000
whether or not you understand their neighborhoods.

205
0:09:21.455,000 --> 0:09:24,000
It's not something you can just fake.

206
0:09:24.551,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And so I began walking.

207
0:09:27.257,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I can't tell you how many blocks I walked,

208
0:09:29.577,000 --> 0:09:32,000
in sweltering summers, in freezing winters,

209
0:09:32.986,000 --> 0:09:33,000
year after year,

210
0:09:34.816,000 --> 0:09:36,000
just so I could get to understand

211
0:09:36.904,000 --> 0:09:38,000
the DNA of each neighborhood

212
0:09:38.931,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and know what each street felt like.

213
0:09:41.506,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I became an incredibly geeky zoning expert,

214
0:09:45.001,000 --> 0:09:47,000
finding ways that zoning could address

215
0:09:47.07,000 --> 0:09:49,000
communities' concerns.

216
0:09:49.132,000 --> 0:09:51,000
So little by little, neighborhood by neighborhood,

217
0:09:51.704,000 --> 0:09:52,000
block by block,

218
0:09:53.139,000 --> 0:09:54,000
we began to set height limits

219
0:09:55.012,000 --> 0:09:56,000
so that all new development

220
0:09:56.744,000 --> 0:09:59,000
would be predictable and near transit.

221
0:10:00.361,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Over the course of 12 years,

222
0:10:02.142,000 --> 0:10:04,000
we were able to rezone

223
0:10:04.611,000 --> 0:10:06,000
124 neighborhoods,

224
0:10:07.18,000 --> 0:10:09,000
40 percent of the city,

225
0:10:09.959,000 --> 0:10:13,000
12,500 blocks, so that now,

226
0:10:14.498,000 --> 0:10:17,000
90 percent of all new development of New York

227
0:10:17.735,000 --> 0:10:19,000
is within a 10-minute walk of a subway.

228
0:10:20.383,000 --> 0:10:22,000
In other words, nobody in those new buildings

229
0:10:23.033,000 --> 0:10:24,000
needs to own a car.

230
0:10:24.909,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Well, those rezonings were exhausting

231
0:10:29.002,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and enervating and important,

232
0:10:32.04,000 --> 0:10:34,000
but rezoning was never my mission.

233
0:10:34.59,000 --> 0:10:37,000
You can't see zoning and you can't feel zoning.

234
0:10:38.081,000 --> 0:10:4,000
My mission was always to create

235
0:10:40.169,000 --> 0:10:41,000
great public spaces.

236
0:10:42.093,000 --> 0:10:45,000
So in the areas where we zoned for significant development,

237
0:10:45.985,000 --> 0:10:47,000
I was determined to create places

238
0:10:48.176,000 --> 0:10:5,000
that would make a difference in people's lives.

239
0:10:50.87,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Here you see what was

240
0:10:52.956,000 --> 0:10:54,000
two miles of abandoned, degraded waterfront

241
0:10:55.38,000 --> 0:10:56,000
in the neighborhoods of Greenpoint

242
0:10:57.147,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and Williamsburg in Brooklyn,

243
0:10:58.929,000 --> 0:11:01,000
impossible to get to and impossible to use.

244
0:11:02.489,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Now the zoning here was massive,

245
0:11:04.983,000 --> 0:11:07,000
so I felt an obligation to create

246
0:11:08.005,000 --> 0:11:11,000
magnificent parks on these waterfronts,

247
0:11:11.03,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and I spent an incredible amount of time

248
0:11:13.77,000 --> 0:11:16,000
on every square inch of these plans.

249
0:11:16.875,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I wanted to make sure that there were

250
0:11:18.94,000 --> 0:11:2,000
tree-lined paths from the upland to the water,

251
0:11:21.479,000 --> 0:11:23,000
that there were trees and plantings everywhere,

252
0:11:23.89,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and, of course, lots and lots of places to sit.

253
0:11:28.078,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Honestly, I had no idea how it would turn out.

254
0:11:31.448,000 --> 0:11:32,000
I had to have faith.

255
0:11:33.073,000 --> 0:11:35,000
But I put everything that I had studied and learned

256
0:11:36.036,000 --> 0:11:37,000
into those plans.

257
0:11:37.77,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And then it opened,

258
0:11:39.43,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and I have to tell you, it was incredible.

259
0:11:42.717,000 --> 0:11:44,000
People came from all over the city

260
0:11:44.802,000 --> 0:11:45,000
to be in these parks.

261
0:11:46.459,000 --> 0:11:49,000
I know they changed the lives of the people who live there,

262
0:11:49.879,000 --> 0:11:51,000
but they also changed New Yorkers' whole image

263
0:11:52.374,000 --> 0:11:53,000
of their city.

264
0:11:54.15,000 --> 0:11:55,000
I often come down and watch people

265
0:11:55.729,000 --> 0:11:56,000
get on this little ferry

266
0:11:57.245,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that now runs between the boroughs,

267
0:11:59.223,000 --> 0:12:,000
and I can't tell you why,

268
0:12:00.71,000 --> 0:12:01,000
but I'm completely moved

269
0:12:02.282,000 --> 0:12:04,000
by the fact that people are using it

270
0:12:04.429,000 --> 0:12:06,000
as if it had always been there.

271
0:12:06.611,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And here is a new park in lower Manhattan.

272
0:12:09.884,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Now, the water's edge in lower Manhattan

273
0:12:12.641,000 --> 0:12:14,000
was a complete mess before 9/11.

274
0:12:15.574,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Wall Street was essentially landlocked

275
0:12:17.489,000 --> 0:12:19,000
because you couldn't get anywhere near this edge.

276
0:12:20.075,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And after 9/11, the city had very little control.

277
0:12:23.909,000 --> 0:12:24,000
But I thought if we went

278
0:12:25.454,000 --> 0:12:27,000
to the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation

279
0:12:27.599,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and got money to reclaim this two miles

280
0:12:30.56,000 --> 0:12:31,000
of degraded waterfront

281
0:12:32.356,000 --> 0:12:33,000
that it would have an enormous effect

282
0:12:34.207,000 --> 0:12:36,000
on the rebuilding of lower Manhattan.

283
0:12:36.668,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And it did.

284
0:12:37.848,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Lower Manhattan finally has a public waterfront

285
0:12:41.239,000 --> 0:12:43,000
on all three sides.

286
0:12:43.353,000 --> 0:12:45,000
I really love this park.

287
0:12:45.737,000 --> 0:12:47,000
You know, railings have to be higher now,

288
0:12:47.962,000 --> 0:12:49,000
so we put bar seating at the edge,

289
0:12:50.506,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and you can get so close to the water

290
0:12:52.618,000 --> 0:12:53,000
you're practically on it.

291
0:12:54.346,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And see how the railing widens

292
0:12:56.215,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and flattens out so you can lay down

293
0:12:57.631,000 --> 0:12:58,000
your lunch or your laptop.

294
0:12:59.513,000 --> 0:13:,000
And I love when people come there

295
0:13:01.493,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and look up and they say,

296
0:13:03.353,000 --> 0:13:07,000
"Wow, there's Brooklyn, and it's so close."

297
0:13:07.38,000 --> 0:13:09,000
So what's the trick?

298
0:13:09.732,000 --> 0:13:1,000
How do you turn a park

299
0:13:11.541,000 --> 0:13:14,000
into a place that people want to be?

300
0:13:14.707,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Well, it's up to you,

301
0:13:17.55,000 --> 0:13:2,000
not as a city planner but as a human being.

302
0:13:20.915,000 --> 0:13:23,000
You don't tap into your design expertise.

303
0:13:24.315,000 --> 0:13:27,000
You tap into your humanity.

304
0:13:27.83,000 --> 0:13:3,000
I mean, would you want to go there?

305
0:13:31.156,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Would you want to stay there?

306
0:13:33.139,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Can you see into it and out of it?

307
0:13:35.277,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Are there other people there?

308
0:13:37.529,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Does it seem green and friendly?

309
0:13:40.176,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Can you find your very own seat?

310
0:13:43.414,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Well now, all over New York City,

311
0:13:46.443,000 --> 0:13:47,000
there are places where you can

312
0:13:47.947,000 --> 0:13:48,000
find your very own seat.

313
0:13:49.801,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Where there used to be parking spaces,

314
0:13:52.323,000 --> 0:13:54,000
there are now pop-up cafes.

315
0:13:54.616,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Where Broadway traffic used to run,

316
0:13:56.594,000 --> 0:13:57,000
there are now tables and chairs.

317
0:13:58.558,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Where 12 years ago, sidewalk cafes were not allowed,

318
0:14:02.112,000 --> 0:14:03,000
they are now everywhere.

319
0:14:04.085,000 --> 0:14:06,000
But claiming these spaces for public use

320
0:14:07.08,000 --> 0:14:08,000
was not simple,

321
0:14:08.219,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and it's even harder to keep them that way.

322
0:14:10.881,000 --> 0:14:11,000
So now I'm going to tell you a story

323
0:14:12.57,000 --> 0:14:16,000
about a very unusual park called the High Line.

324
0:14:16.85,000 --> 0:14:18,000
The High Line was an elevated railway.

325
0:14:18.904,000 --> 0:14:24,000
(Applause)

326
0:14:25.535,000 --> 0:14:27,000
The High Line was an elevated railway

327
0:14:27.811,000 --> 0:14:28,000
that ran through three neighborhoods

328
0:14:29.623,000 --> 0:14:3,000
on Manhattan's West Side,

329
0:14:31.493,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and when the train stopped running,

330
0:14:33.238,000 --> 0:14:35,000
it became a self-seeded landscape,

331
0:14:35.394,000 --> 0:14:37,000
a kind of a garden in the sky.

332
0:14:38.001,000 --> 0:14:4,000
And when I saw it the first time,

333
0:14:40.15,000 --> 0:14:42,000
honestly, when I went up on that old viaduct,

334
0:14:42.796,000 --> 0:14:44,000
I fell in love the way you fall in love with a person,

335
0:14:45.612,000 --> 0:14:46,000
honestly.

336
0:14:46.839,000 --> 0:14:48,000
And when I was appointed,

337
0:14:48.96,000 --> 0:14:5,000
saving the first two sections of the High Line

338
0:14:51.036,000 --> 0:14:54,000
from demolition became my first priority

339
0:14:54.408,000 --> 0:14:56,000
and my most important project.

340
0:14:57.08,000 --> 0:15:,000
I knew if there was a day that I didn't

341
0:15:00.348,000 --> 0:15:03,000
worry about the High Line, it would come down.

342
0:15:03.951,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And the High Line,

343
0:15:05.94,000 --> 0:15:07,000
even though it is widely known now

344
0:15:08.4,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and phenomenally popular,

345
0:15:10.219,000 --> 0:15:13,000
it is the most contested public space in the city.

346
0:15:14.123,000 --> 0:15:16,000
You might see a beautiful park,

347
0:15:16.998,000 --> 0:15:18,000
but not everyone does.

348
0:15:19.445,000 --> 0:15:21,000
You know, it's true, commercial interests

349
0:15:22.082,000 --> 0:15:25,000
will always battle against public space.

350
0:15:25.299,000 --> 0:15:26,000
You might say,

351
0:15:27.123,000 --> 0:15:28,000
"How wonderful it is that more than

352
0:15:28.693,000 --> 0:15:3,000
four million people come from all over the world

353
0:15:31.124,000 --> 0:15:32,000
to visit the High Line."

354
0:15:32.771,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Well, a developer sees just one thing: customers.

355
0:15:37.387,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Hey, why not take out those plantings

356
0:15:40.112,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and have shops all along the High Line?

357
0:15:42.12,000 --> 0:15:43,000
Wouldn't that be terrific

358
0:15:43.617,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and won't it mean a lot more money for the city?

359
0:15:46.152,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Well no, it would not be terrific.

360
0:15:48.644,000 --> 0:15:51,000
It would be a mall, and not a park.

361
0:15:51.943,000 --> 0:15:58,000
(Applause)

362
0:15:59.322,000 --> 0:16:,000
And you know what, it might mean

363
0:16:00.83,000 --> 0:16:02,000
more money for the city,

364
0:16:03.04,000 --> 0:16:07,000
but a city has to take the long view,

365
0:16:07.089,000 --> 0:16:09,000
the view for the common good.

366
0:16:10.025,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Most recently, the last section of the High Line,

367
0:16:13.74,000 --> 0:16:14,000
the third section of the High Line,

368
0:16:15.356,000 --> 0:16:16,000
the final section of the High Line,

369
0:16:16.926,000 --> 0:16:18,000
has been pitted against development interests,

370
0:16:19.728,000 --> 0:16:21,000
where some of the city's leading developers

371
0:16:22.028,000 --> 0:16:24,000
are building more than 17 million square feet

372
0:16:24.71,000 --> 0:16:26,000
at the Hudson Yards.

373
0:16:27.01,000 --> 0:16:28,000
And they came to me and proposed

374
0:16:28.971,000 --> 0:16:3,000
that they "temporarily disassemble"

375
0:16:31.53,000 --> 0:16:33,000
that third and final section.

376
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
Perhaps the High Line didn't fit in

377
0:16:36.723,000 --> 0:16:38,000
with their image of a gleaming city of skyscrapers

378
0:16:39.61,000 --> 0:16:4,000
on a hill.

379
0:16:41.073,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Perhaps it was just in their way.

380
0:16:43.797,000 --> 0:16:45,000
But in any case, it took nine months

381
0:16:46.285,000 --> 0:16:48,000
of nonstop daily negotiation

382
0:16:48.759,000 --> 0:16:5,000
to finally get the signed agreement

383
0:16:50.772,000 --> 0:16:52,000
to prohibit its demolition,

384
0:16:52.796,000 --> 0:16:55,000
and that was only two years ago.

385
0:16:56.605,000 --> 0:16:58,000
So you see, no matter how popular

386
0:16:59.063,000 --> 0:17:01,000
and successful a public space may be,

387
0:17:01.899,000 --> 0:17:03,000
it can never be taken for granted.

388
0:17:04.315,000 --> 0:17:06,000
Public spaces always -- this is it saved --

389
0:17:06.896,000 --> 0:17:09,000
public spaces always need vigilant champions,

390
0:17:10.608,000 --> 0:17:13,000
not only to claim them at the outset for public use,

391
0:17:14.308,000 --> 0:17:17,000
but to design them for the people that use them,

392
0:17:17.839,000 --> 0:17:19,000
then to maintain them to ensure

393
0:17:19.87,000 --> 0:17:2,000
that they are for everyone,

394
0:17:21.84,000 --> 0:17:23,000
that they are not violated, invaded,

395
0:17:24.253,000 --> 0:17:26,000
abandoned or ignored.

396
0:17:26.89,000 --> 0:17:27,000
If there is any one lesson

397
0:17:28.534,000 --> 0:17:31,000
that I have learned in my life as a city planner,

398
0:17:31.686,000 --> 0:17:34,000
it is that public spaces have power.

399
0:17:35.446,000 --> 0:17:38,000
It's not just the number of people using them,

400
0:17:38.515,000 --> 0:17:39,000
it's the even greater number of people

401
0:17:40.469,000 --> 0:17:42,000
who feel better about their city

402
0:17:42.588,000 --> 0:17:45,000
just knowing that they are there.

403
0:17:45.82,000 --> 0:17:48,000
Public space can change how you live in a city,

404
0:17:49.292,000 --> 0:17:51,000
how you feel about a city,

405
0:17:51.462,000 --> 0:17:54,000
whether you choose one city over another,

406
0:17:54.75,000 --> 0:17:56,000
and public space is one of the most important reasons

407
0:17:57.521,000 --> 0:18:,000
why you stay in a city.

408
0:18:00.642,000 --> 0:18:02,000
I believe that a successful city

409
0:18:03.107,000 --> 0:18:05,000
is like a fabulous party.

410
0:18:05.728,000 --> 0:18:08,000
People stay because they are having a great time.

411
0:18:09.633,000 --> 0:18:1,000
Thank you.

412
0:18:11.576,000 --> 0:18:16,000
(Applause)

413
0:18:17.529,000 --> 0:18:21,000
Thank you. (Applause)

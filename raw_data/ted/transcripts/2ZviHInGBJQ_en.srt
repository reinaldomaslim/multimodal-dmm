1
0:00:13.097,000 --> 0:00:15,000
It was April, last year.

2
0:00:15.714,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I was on an evening out with friends

3
0:00:17.485,000 --> 0:00:18,000
to celebrate one of their birthdays.

4
0:00:19.677,000 --> 0:00:21,000
We hadn't been all together for a couple of weeks;

5
0:00:22.094,000 --> 0:00:24,000
it was a perfect evening, as we were all reunited.

6
0:00:25.22,000 --> 0:00:26,000
At the end of the evening,

7
0:00:26.497,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I caught the last underground train back to the other side of London.

8
0:00:30.663,000 --> 0:00:31,000
The journey was smooth.

9
0:00:32.479,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I got back to my local station

10
0:00:34.011,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and I began the 10-minute walk home.

11
0:00:37.159,000 --> 0:00:39,000
As I turned the corner onto my street,

12
0:00:39.547,000 --> 0:00:4,000
my house in sight up ahead,

13
0:00:41.596,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I heard footsteps behind me

14
0:00:43.004,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that seemed to have approached out of nowhere

15
0:00:45.191,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and were picking up pace.

16
0:00:47.778,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Before I had time to process what was happening,

17
0:00:50.329,000 --> 0:00:53,000
a hand was clapped around my mouth so that I could not breathe,

18
0:00:53.484,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and the young man behind me dragged me to the ground,

19
0:00:56.208,000 --> 0:00:58,000
beat my head repeatedly against the pavement

20
0:00:58.358,000 --> 0:00:59,000
until my face began to bleed,

21
0:01:00.364,000 --> 0:01:02,000
kicking me in the back and neck

22
0:01:02.596,000 --> 0:01:03,000
while he began to assault me,

23
0:01:04.272,000 --> 0:01:06,000
ripping off my clothes and telling me to "shut up,"

24
0:01:06.758,000 --> 0:01:07,000
as I struggled to cry for help.

25
0:01:09.423,000 --> 0:01:11,000
With each smack of my head to the concrete ground,

26
0:01:11.843,000 --> 0:01:13,000
a question echoed through my mind that still haunts me today:

27
0:01:15.118,000 --> 0:01:17,000
"Is this going to be how it all ends?"

28
0:01:18.828,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Little could I have realized, I'd been followed the whole way

29
0:01:21.764,000 --> 0:01:22,000
from the moment I left the station.

30
0:01:23.739,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And hours later,

31
0:01:24.966,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I was standing topless and barelegged in front of the police,

32
0:01:28.534,000 --> 0:01:3,000
having the cuts and bruises on my naked body photographed

33
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
for forensic evidence.

34
0:01:33.956,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Now, there are few words to describe the all-consuming feelings

35
0:01:37.219,000 --> 0:01:4,000
of vulnerability, shame, upset and injustice that I was ridden with

36
0:01:40.448,000 --> 0:01:42,000
in that moment and for the weeks to come.

37
0:01:43.868,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But wanting to find a way to condense these feelings

38
0:01:46.516,000 --> 0:01:48,000
into something ordered that I could work through,

39
0:01:48.862,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I decided to do what felt most natural to me:

40
0:01:51.322,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I wrote about it.

41
0:01:53.149,000 --> 0:01:55,000
It started out as a cathartic exercise.

42
0:01:55.606,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I wrote a letter to my assaulter,

43
0:01:58.688,000 --> 0:02:,000
humanizing him as "you,"

44
0:02:00.807,000 --> 0:02:02,000
to identify him as part of the very community

45
0:02:03.708,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that he had so violently abused that night.

46
0:02:06.991,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Stressing the tidal-wave effect of his actions,

47
0:02:09.289,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I wrote:

48
0:02:10.92,000 --> 0:02:12,000
"Did you ever think of the people in your life?

49
0:02:13.841,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I don't know who the people in your life are.

50
0:02:16.202,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I don't know anything about you.

51
0:02:18.183,000 --> 0:02:19,000
But I do know this:

52
0:02:19.839,000 --> 0:02:21,000
you did not just attack me that night.

53
0:02:22.323,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I'm a daughter, I'm a friend,

54
0:02:23.86,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I'm a sister, I'm a pupil,

55
0:02:25.569,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I'm a cousin, I'm a niece,

56
0:02:26.895,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I'm a neighbor;

57
0:02:28.086,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I'm the employee who served everyone coffee

58
0:02:30.159,000 --> 0:02:31,000
in the café under the railway.

59
0:02:32.362,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And all the people who form these relations to me

60
0:02:34.872,000 --> 0:02:35,000
make up my community.

61
0:02:36.549,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And you assaulted every single one of them.

62
0:02:39.418,000 --> 0:02:41,000
You violated the truth that I will never cease to fight for,

63
0:02:42.278,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and which all of these people represent:

64
0:02:44.239,000 --> 0:02:47,000
that there are infinitely more good people in the world than bad."

65
0:02:48.79,000 --> 0:02:5,000
But, determined not to let this one incident make me lose faith

66
0:02:51.813,000 --> 0:02:53,000
in the solidarity in my community or humanity as a whole,

67
0:02:54.55,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I recalled the 7/7 terrorist bombings in July 2005 on London transport,

68
0:02:59.052,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and how the mayor of London at the time, and indeed my own parents,

69
0:03:02.476,000 --> 0:03:04,000
had insisted that we all get back on the tubes the next day,

70
0:03:05.347,000 --> 0:03:06,000
so we wouldn't be defined or changed

71
0:03:07.134,000 --> 0:03:08,000
by those that had made us feel unsafe.

72
0:03:09.49,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I told my attacker,

73
0:03:11.74,000 --> 0:03:12,000
"You've carried out your attack,

74
0:03:13.313,000 --> 0:03:15,000
but now I'm getting back on my tube.

75
0:03:16.162,000 --> 0:03:19,000
My community will not feel we are unsafe walking home after dark.

76
0:03:19.453,000 --> 0:03:2,000
We will get on the last tubes home,

77
0:03:21.18,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and we will walk up our streets alone,

78
0:03:23.038,000 --> 0:03:25,000
because we will not ingrain or submit to the idea

79
0:03:25.398,000 --> 0:03:27,000
that we are putting ourselves in danger in doing so.

80
0:03:28.19,000 --> 0:03:3,000
We will continue to come together, like an army,

81
0:03:30.814,000 --> 0:03:32,000
when any member of our community is threatened.

82
0:03:33.785,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And this is a fight you will not win."

83
0:03:37.621,000 --> 0:03:38,000
At the time of writing this letter --

84
0:03:39.452,000 --> 0:03:4,000
(Applause)

85
0:03:40.851,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Thank you.

86
0:03:42.02,000 --> 0:03:44,000
(Applause)

87
0:03:44.717,000 --> 0:03:45,000
At the time of writing this letter,

88
0:03:46.461,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I was studying for my exams in Oxford,

89
0:03:48.34,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and I was working on the local student paper there.

90
0:03:50.748,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Despite being lucky enough to have friends and family supporting me,

91
0:03:54.072,000 --> 0:03:55,000
it was an isolating time.

92
0:03:55.304,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I didn't know anyone who'd been through this before;

93
0:03:57.815,000 --> 0:03:58,000
at least I didn't think I did.

94
0:03:59.283,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I'd read news reports, statistics, and knew how common sexual assault was,

95
0:04:02.801,000 --> 0:04:04,000
yet I couldn't actually name a single person

96
0:04:04.882,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that I'd heard speak out about an experience of this kind before.

97
0:04:07.989,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So in a somewhat spontaneous decision,

98
0:04:09.95,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I decided that I would publish my letter in the student paper,

99
0:04:12.97,000 --> 0:04:13,000
hoping to reach out to others in Oxford

100
0:04:14.902,000 --> 0:04:17,000
that might have had a similar experience and be feeling the same way.

101
0:04:18.297,000 --> 0:04:19,000
At the end of the letter,

102
0:04:19.547,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I asked others to write in with their experiences

103
0:04:21.937,000 --> 0:04:22,000
under the hashtag, "#NotGuilty,"

104
0:04:23.653,000 --> 0:04:26,000
to emphasize that survivors of assault could express themselves

105
0:04:26.703,000 --> 0:04:28,000
without feeling shame or guilt about what happened to them --

106
0:04:29.633,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to show that we could all stand up to sexual assault.

107
0:04:32.233,000 --> 0:04:34,000
What I never anticipated is that almost overnight,

108
0:04:35.089,000 --> 0:04:36,000
this published letter would go viral.

109
0:04:37.619,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Soon, we were receiving hundreds of stories

110
0:04:40.169,000 --> 0:04:41,000
from men and women across the world,

111
0:04:41.976,000 --> 0:04:43,000
which we began to publish on a website I set up.

112
0:04:44.672,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And the hashtag became a campaign.

113
0:04:47.652,000 --> 0:04:5,000
There was an Australian mother in her 40s who described how on an evening out,

114
0:04:51.366,000 --> 0:04:52,000
she was followed to the bathroom

115
0:04:52.946,000 --> 0:04:54,000
by a man who went to repeatedly grab her crotch.

116
0:04:55.296,000 --> 0:04:56,000
There was a man in the Netherlands

117
0:04:56.942,000 --> 0:04:58,000
who described how he was date-raped on a visit to London

118
0:04:59.658,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and wasn't taken seriously by anyone he reported his case to.

119
0:05:02.564,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I had personal Facebook messages from people in India and South America,

120
0:05:06.022,000 --> 0:05:09,000
saying, how can we bring the message of the campaign there?

121
0:05:09.173,000 --> 0:05:11,000
One of the first contributions we had was from a woman called Nikki,

122
0:05:11.995,000 --> 0:05:13,000
who described growing up, being molested my her own father.

123
0:05:14.836,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And I had friends open up to me

124
0:05:16.343,000 --> 0:05:19,000
about experiences ranging from those that happened last week

125
0:05:19.46,000 --> 0:05:22,000
to those that happened years ago, that I'd had no idea about.

126
0:05:23.326,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And the more we started to receive these messages,

127
0:05:25.709,000 --> 0:05:27,000
the more we also started to receive messages of hope --

128
0:05:28.317,000 --> 0:05:3,000
people feeling empowered by this community of voices

129
0:05:30.816,000 --> 0:05:32,000
standing up to sexual assault and victim-blaming.

130
0:05:33.344,000 --> 0:05:34,000
One woman called Olivia,

131
0:05:34.667,000 --> 0:05:35,000
after describing how she was attacked

132
0:05:36.476,000 --> 0:05:38,000
by someone she had trusted and cared about for a long time,

133
0:05:39.326,000 --> 0:05:41,000
said, "I've read many of the stories posted here,

134
0:05:41.748,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and I feel hopeful that if so many women can move forward,

135
0:05:44.762,000 --> 0:05:45,000
then I can, too.

136
0:05:45.968,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I've been inspired by many,

137
0:05:47.299,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and I hope I can be as strong as them someday.

138
0:05:49.516,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I'm sure I will."

139
0:05:51.082,000 --> 0:05:53,000
People around the world began tweeting under this hashtag,

140
0:05:53.832,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and the letter was republished and covered by the national press,

141
0:05:56.933,000 --> 0:05:59,000
as well as being translated into several other languages worldwide.

142
0:06:00.642,000 --> 0:06:02,000
But something struck me about the media attention

143
0:06:03.04,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that this letter was attracting.

144
0:06:04.675,000 --> 0:06:06,000
For something to be front-page news,

145
0:06:06.777,000 --> 0:06:08,000
given the word "news" itself,

146
0:06:09.768,000 --> 0:06:12,000
we can assume it must be something new or something surprising.

147
0:06:13.172,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And yet sexual assault is not something new.

148
0:06:15.87,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Sexual assault, along with other kinds of injustices,

149
0:06:18.755,000 --> 0:06:19,000
is reported in the media all the time.

150
0:06:21.154,000 --> 0:06:22,000
But through the campaign,

151
0:06:22.376,000 --> 0:06:24,000
these injustices were framed as not just news stories,

152
0:06:25.007,000 --> 0:06:28,000
they were firsthand experiences that had affected real people,

153
0:06:28.349,000 --> 0:06:3,000
who were creating, with the solidarity of others,

154
0:06:30.723,000 --> 0:06:32,000
what they needed and had previously lacked:

155
0:06:32.838,000 --> 0:06:33,000
a platform to speak out,

156
0:06:34.259,000 --> 0:06:37,000
the reassurance they weren't alone or to blame for what happened to them

157
0:06:37.735,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and open discussions that would help to reduce stigma around the issue.

158
0:06:41.388,000 --> 0:06:44,000
The voices of those directly affected were at the forefront of the story --

159
0:06:45.08,000 --> 0:06:48,000
not the voices of journalists or commentators on social media.

160
0:06:48.733,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And that's why the story was news.

161
0:06:52.239,000 --> 0:06:54,000
We live in an incredibly interconnected world

162
0:06:54.37,000 --> 0:06:55,000
with the proliferation of social media,

163
0:06:56.294,000 --> 0:06:59,000
which is of course a fantastic resource for igniting social change.

164
0:06:59.951,000 --> 0:07:01,000
But it's also made us increasingly reactive,

165
0:07:02.702,000 --> 0:07:05,000
from the smallest annoyances of, "Oh, my train's been delayed,"

166
0:07:06.113,000 --> 0:07:1,000
to the greatest injustices of war, genocides, terrorist attacks.

167
0:07:10.508,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Our default response has become to leap to react to any kind of grievance

168
0:07:14.03,000 --> 0:07:16,000
by tweeting, Facebooking, hastagging --

169
0:07:16.202,000 --> 0:07:18,000
anything to show others that we, too, have reacted.

170
0:07:19.798,000 --> 0:07:21,000
The problem with reacting in this manner en masse

171
0:07:22.135,000 --> 0:07:24,000
is it can sometimes mean that we don't actually react at all,

172
0:07:25.08,000 --> 0:07:27,000
not in the sense of actually doing anything, anyway.

173
0:07:27.553,000 --> 0:07:28,000
It might make ourselves feel better,

174
0:07:29.315,000 --> 0:07:31,000
like we've contributed to a group mourning or outrage,

175
0:07:31.89,000 --> 0:07:32,000
but it doesn't actually change anything.

176
0:07:33.876,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And what's more,

177
0:07:35.064,000 --> 0:07:36,000
it can sometimes drown out the voices

178
0:07:36.892,000 --> 0:07:38,000
of those directly affected by the injustice,

179
0:07:39.014,000 --> 0:07:4,000
whose needs must be heard.

180
0:07:41.78,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Worrying, too, is the tendency for some reactions to injustice

181
0:07:45.657,000 --> 0:07:46,000
to build even more walls,

182
0:07:47.278,000 --> 0:07:5,000
being quick to point fingers with the hope of providing easy solutions

183
0:07:50.664,000 --> 0:07:51,000
to complex problems.

184
0:07:52.328,000 --> 0:07:54,000
One British tabloid, on the publication of my letter,

185
0:07:54.891,000 --> 0:07:55,000
branded a headline stating,

186
0:07:56.444,000 --> 0:07:59,000
"Oxford Student Launches Online Campaign to Shame Attacker."

187
0:08:01.567,000 --> 0:08:03,000
But the campaign never meant to shame anyone.

188
0:08:04.237,000 --> 0:08:07,000
It meant to let people speak and to make others listen.

189
0:08:08.186,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Divisive Twitter trolls were quick to create even more injustice,

190
0:08:11.624,000 --> 0:08:13,000
commenting on my attacker's ethnicity or class

191
0:08:14.598,000 --> 0:08:16,000
to push their own prejudiced agendas.

192
0:08:17.381,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And some even accused me of feigning the whole thing

193
0:08:20.866,000 --> 0:08:22,000
to push, and I quote,

194
0:08:22.996,000 --> 0:08:25,000
my "feminist agenda of man-hating."

195
0:08:26.834,000 --> 0:08:27,000
(Laughter)

196
0:08:27.92,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I know, right?

197
0:08:29.104,000 --> 0:08:31,000
As if I'm going to be like, "Hey guys! Sorry I can't make it,

198
0:08:31.993,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I'm busy trying to hate the entire male population

199
0:08:34.382,000 --> 0:08:35,000
by the time I'm 30."

200
0:08:35.791,000 --> 0:08:36,000
(Laughter)

201
0:08:36.953,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Now, I'm almost sure

202
0:08:39.025,000 --> 0:08:41,000
that these people wouldn't say the things they say in person.

203
0:08:42.021,000 --> 0:08:44,000
But it's as if because they might be behind a screen,

204
0:08:44.807,000 --> 0:08:45,000
in the comfort in their own home

205
0:08:46.39,000 --> 0:08:47,000
when on social media,

206
0:08:47.565,000 --> 0:08:49,000
people forget that what they're doing is a public act --

207
0:08:50.243,000 --> 0:08:52,000
that other people will be reading it and be affected by it.

208
0:08:53.043,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Returning to my analogy of getting back on our trains,

209
0:08:56.64,000 --> 0:08:58,000
another main concern I have about this noise that escalates

210
0:08:59.497,000 --> 0:09:,000
from our online responses to injustice

211
0:09:01.397,000 --> 0:09:04,000
is that it can very easily slip into portraying us as the affected party,

212
0:09:04.896,000 --> 0:09:06,000
which can lead to a sense of defeatism,

213
0:09:06.94,000 --> 0:09:09,000
a kind of mental barrier to seeing any opportunity for positivity or change

214
0:09:10.683,000 --> 0:09:11,000
after a negative situation.

215
0:09:13.092,000 --> 0:09:15,000
A couple of months before the campaign started

216
0:09:15.351,000 --> 0:09:16,000
or any of this happened to me,

217
0:09:16.816,000 --> 0:09:17,000
I went to a TEDx event in Oxford,

218
0:09:18.586,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and I saw Zelda la Grange speak,

219
0:09:20.545,000 --> 0:09:22,000
the former private secretary to Nelson Mandela.

220
0:09:22.83,000 --> 0:09:24,000
One of the stories she told really struck me.

221
0:09:25.755,000 --> 0:09:27,000
She spoke of when Mandela was taken to court

222
0:09:27.848,000 --> 0:09:28,000
by the South African Rugby Union

223
0:09:29.462,000 --> 0:09:31,000
after he commissioned an inquiry into sports affairs.

224
0:09:32.037,000 --> 0:09:33,000
In the courtroom,

225
0:09:33.212,000 --> 0:09:35,000
he went up to the South African Rugby Union's lawyers,

226
0:09:36.227,000 --> 0:09:37,000
shook them by the hand

227
0:09:37.411,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and conversed with them, each in their own language.

228
0:09:39.878,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And Zelda wanted to protest,

229
0:09:41.242,000 --> 0:09:42,000
saying they had no right to his respect

230
0:09:43.173,000 --> 0:09:45,000
after this injustice they had caused him.

231
0:09:45.837,000 --> 0:09:46,000
He turned to her and said,

232
0:09:48.324,000 --> 0:09:52,000
"You must never allow the enemy to determine the grounds for battle."

233
0:09:53.9,000 --> 0:09:54,000
At the time of hearing these words,

234
0:09:55.634,000 --> 0:09:57,000
I didn't really know why they were so important,

235
0:09:57.926,000 --> 0:10:,000
but I felt they were, and I wrote them down in a notebook I had on me.

236
0:10:01.311,000 --> 0:10:03,000
But I've thought about this line a lot ever since.

237
0:10:04.198,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Revenge, or the expression of hatred

238
0:10:06.739,000 --> 0:10:07,000
towards those who have done us injustice

239
0:10:08.699,000 --> 0:10:11,000
may feel like a human instinct in the face of wrong,

240
0:10:11.737,000 --> 0:10:12,000
but we need to break out of these cycles

241
0:10:13.675,000 --> 0:10:16,000
if we are to hope to transform negative events of injustice

242
0:10:16.807,000 --> 0:10:17,000
into positive social change.

243
0:10:18.906,000 --> 0:10:19,000
To do otherwise

244
0:10:20.103,000 --> 0:10:23,000
continues to let the enemy determine the grounds for battle,

245
0:10:23.406,000 --> 0:10:24,000
creates a binary,

246
0:10:24.616,000 --> 0:10:26,000
where we who have suffered become the affected,

247
0:10:27.144,000 --> 0:10:29,000
pitted against them, the perpetrators.

248
0:10:30.143,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And just like we got back on our tubes,

249
0:10:32.037,000 --> 0:10:35,000
we can't let our platforms for interconnectivity and community

250
0:10:35.097,000 --> 0:10:37,000
be the places that we settle for defeat.

251
0:10:39.072,000 --> 0:10:42,000
But I don't want to discourage a social media response,

252
0:10:42.612,000 --> 0:10:44,000
because I owe the development of the #NotGuilty campaign

253
0:10:45.303,000 --> 0:10:46,000
almost entirely to social media.

254
0:10:46.871,000 --> 0:10:48,000
But I do want to encourage a more considered approach

255
0:10:49.42,000 --> 0:10:51,000
to the way we use it to respond to injustice.

256
0:10:51.567,000 --> 0:10:53,000
The start, I think, is to ask ourselves two things.

257
0:10:54.042,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Firstly: Why do I feel this injustice?

258
0:10:56.598,000 --> 0:10:58,000
In my case, there were several answers to this.

259
0:10:58.928,000 --> 0:11:,000
Someone had hurt me and those who I loved,

260
0:11:01.185,000 --> 0:11:03,000
under the assumption they wouldn't have to be held to account

261
0:11:04.109,000 --> 0:11:05,000
or recognize the damage they had caused.

262
0:11:06.046,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Not only that, but thousands of men and women suffer every day

263
0:11:08.978,000 --> 0:11:09,000
from sexual abuse, often in silence,

264
0:11:10.72,000 --> 0:11:13,000
yet it's still a problem we don't give the same airtime to as other issues.

265
0:11:14.296,000 --> 0:11:16,000
It's still an issue many people blame victims for.

266
0:11:16.84,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Next, ask yourself: How, in recognizing these reasons,

267
0:11:20.146,000 --> 0:11:21,000
could I go about reversing them?

268
0:11:22.183,000 --> 0:11:25,000
With us, this was holding my attacker to account -- and many others.

269
0:11:25.795,000 --> 0:11:27,000
It was calling them out on the effect they had caused.

270
0:11:28.425,000 --> 0:11:3,000
It was giving airtime to the issue of sexual assault,

271
0:11:31.183,000 --> 0:11:34,000
opening up discussions amongst friends, amongst families, in the media

272
0:11:34.568,000 --> 0:11:35,000
that had been closed for too long,

273
0:11:36.233,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and stressing that victims shouldn't feel to blame

274
0:11:38.614,000 --> 0:11:39,000
for what happened to them.

275
0:11:39.909,000 --> 0:11:42,000
We might still have a long way to go in solving this problem entirely.

276
0:11:43.251,000 --> 0:11:44,000
But in this way,

277
0:11:44.426,000 --> 0:11:47,000
we can begin to use social media as an active tool for social justice,

278
0:11:47.761,000 --> 0:11:49,000
as a tool to educate, to stimulate dialogues,

279
0:11:49.883,000 --> 0:11:51,000
to make those in positions of authority aware of an issue

280
0:11:52.592,000 --> 0:11:54,000
by listening to those directly affected by it.

281
0:11:56.112,000 --> 0:12:,000
Because sometimes these questions don't have easy answers.

282
0:12:00.606,000 --> 0:12:01,000
In fact, they rarely do.

283
0:12:02.715,000 --> 0:12:05,000
But this doesn't mean we still can't give them a considered response.

284
0:12:06.37,000 --> 0:12:08,000
In situations where you can't go about thinking

285
0:12:08.598,000 --> 0:12:1,000
how you'd reverse this feeling of injustice,

286
0:12:10.717,000 --> 0:12:12,000
you can still think, maybe not what you can do,

287
0:12:13.395,000 --> 0:12:14,000
but what you can not do.

288
0:12:15.681,000 --> 0:12:18,000
You can not build further walls by fighting injustice with more prejudice,

289
0:12:19.397,000 --> 0:12:2,000
more hatred.

290
0:12:20.894,000 --> 0:12:23,000
You can not speak over those directly affected by an injustice.

291
0:12:25.121,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And you can not react to injustice, only to forget about it the next day,

292
0:12:29.124,000 --> 0:12:31,000
just because the rest of Twitter has moved on.

293
0:12:32.078,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Sometimes not reacting instantly is, ironically,

294
0:12:36.289,000 --> 0:12:38,000
the best immediate course of action we can take.

295
0:12:39.919,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Because we might be angry, upset and energized by injustice,

296
0:12:44.219,000 --> 0:12:46,000
but let's consider our responses.

297
0:12:47.413,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Let us hold people to account, without descending into a culture

298
0:12:50.673,000 --> 0:12:52,000
that thrives off shaming and injustice ourselves.

299
0:12:54.345,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Let us remember that distinction,

300
0:12:56.016,000 --> 0:12:58,000
so often forgotten by internet users,

301
0:12:58.238,000 --> 0:13:,000
between criticism and insult.

302
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Let us not forget to think before we speak,

303
0:13:03.37,000 --> 0:13:05,000
just because we might have a screen in front of us.

304
0:13:05.811,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And when we create noise on social media,

305
0:13:07.806,000 --> 0:13:09,000
let it not drown out the needs of those affected,

306
0:13:10.148,000 --> 0:13:12,000
but instead let it amplify their voices,

307
0:13:12.613,000 --> 0:13:14,000
so the internet becomes a place where you're not the exception

308
0:13:15.579,000 --> 0:13:18,000
if you speak out about something that has actually happened to you.

309
0:13:18.771,000 --> 0:13:2,000
All these considered approaches to injustice

310
0:13:20.848,000 --> 0:13:22,000
evoke the very keystones on which the internet was built:

311
0:13:24.317,000 --> 0:13:26,000
to network, to have signal, to connect --

312
0:13:26.596,000 --> 0:13:28,000
all these terms that imply bringing people together,

313
0:13:29.112,000 --> 0:13:3,000
not pushing people apart.

314
0:13:31.443,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Because if you look up the word "justice" in the dictionary,

315
0:13:35.977,000 --> 0:13:36,000
before punishment,

316
0:13:37.267,000 --> 0:13:4,000
before administration of law or judicial authority,

317
0:13:41.529,000 --> 0:13:42,000
you get:

318
0:13:42.799,000 --> 0:13:44,000
"The maintenance of what is right."

319
0:13:45.794,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And I think there are few things more "right" in this world

320
0:13:49.584,000 --> 0:13:5,000
than bringing people together,

321
0:13:51.344,000 --> 0:13:52,000
than unions.

322
0:13:53.395,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And if we allow social media to deliver that,

323
0:13:55.916,000 --> 0:13:58,000
then it can deliver a very powerful form of justice, indeed.

324
0:14:00.477,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Thank you very much.

325
0:14:01.73,000 --> 0:14:07,000

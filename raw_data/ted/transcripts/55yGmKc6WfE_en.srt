1
0:00:12.96,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Hank Willis Thomas: I'm Deb's son.

2
0:00:14.68,000 --> 0:00:15,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:16.28,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Deborah Willis: And I'm Hank's mom.

4
0:00:18.92,000 --> 0:00:19,000
HWT: We've said that so many times,

5
0:00:20.88,000 --> 0:00:21,000
we've made a piece about it.

6
0:00:22.64,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It's called "Sometimes I See Myself In You,"

7
0:00:25.32,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and it speaks to the symbiotic relationship

8
0:00:27.6,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that we've developed over the years through our life and work.

9
0:00:30.56,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And really, it's because everywhere we go,

10
0:00:33.72,000 --> 0:00:34,000
together or apart,

11
0:00:35.04,000 --> 0:00:36,000
we carry these monikers.

12
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I've been following in my mother's footsteps

13
0:00:39.12,000 --> 0:00:4,000
since before I was even born

14
0:00:40.72,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and haven't figured out how to stop.

15
0:00:43.6,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And as I get older, it does get harder.

16
0:00:46.68,000 --> 0:00:48,000
No seriously, it gets harder.

17
0:00:48.96,000 --> 0:00:49,000
(Laughter)

18
0:00:50.52,000 --> 0:00:52,000
My mother's taught me many things, though,

19
0:00:52.92,000 --> 0:00:54,000
most of all that love overrules.

20
0:00:55.04,000 --> 0:00:57,000
She's taught me that love

21
0:00:57.24,000 --> 0:00:59,000
is an action,

22
0:01:00.24,000 --> 0:01:01,000
not a feeling.

23
0:01:01.56,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Love is a way of being, it's a way of doing,

24
0:01:05.04,000 --> 0:01:08,000
it's a way of listening and it's a way of seeing.

25
0:01:09.32,000 --> 0:01:11,000
DW: And also, the idea about love,

26
0:01:11.72,000 --> 0:01:12,000
photographers,

27
0:01:14.36,000 --> 0:01:16,000
they're looking for love when they make photographs.

28
0:01:17.08,000 --> 0:01:19,000
They're looking and looking and finding love.

29
0:01:19.88,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Growing up in North Philadelphia,

30
0:01:21.52,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I was surrounded by people in my family and friends

31
0:01:25.4,000 --> 0:01:26,000
who made photographs

32
0:01:26.96,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and used the family camera as a way of telling a story about life,

33
0:01:30.96,000 --> 0:01:31,000
about life of joy,

34
0:01:32.56,000 --> 0:01:36,000
about what it meant to become a family in North Philadelphia.

35
0:01:37.32,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So I spent most of my life searching for pictures

36
0:01:40.4,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that reflect on ideas about black love, black joy

37
0:01:43.84,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and about family life.

38
0:01:45.44,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So it's really important to think about the action of love overrules as a verb.

39
0:01:52.12,000 --> 0:01:56,000
HWT: Sometimes I wonder if the love of looking is genetic,

40
0:01:56.48,000 --> 0:01:58,000
because, like my mother,

41
0:01:58.92,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I've loved photographs since before I can even remember.

42
0:02:02.24,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I think sometimes that -- after my mother and her mother --

43
0:02:06.04,000 --> 0:02:09,000
that photography and photographs were my first love.

44
0:02:09.52,000 --> 0:02:1,000
No offense to my father,

45
0:02:11.32,000 --> 0:02:13,000
but that's what you get for calling me a "ham"

46
0:02:14.04,000 --> 0:02:15,000
wherever you go.

47
0:02:15.72,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I remember whenever I'd go to my grandmother's house,

48
0:02:18.221,000 --> 0:02:19,000
she would hide all the photo albums

49
0:02:19.92,000 --> 0:02:21,000
because she was afraid of me asking,

50
0:02:22.199,000 --> 0:02:23,000
"Well, who is that in that picture?"

51
0:02:23.96,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and "Who are they to you and who are they to me,

52
0:02:26.24,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and how old were you when that picture was taken?

53
0:02:28.6,000 --> 0:02:3,000
How old was I when that picture was taken?

54
0:02:30.68,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And why were they in black and white?

55
0:02:32.52,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Was the world in black and white before I was born?"

56
0:02:34.973,000 --> 0:02:35,000
DW: Well, that's interesting,

57
0:02:36.4,000 --> 0:02:38,000
just to think about the world in black and white.

58
0:02:38.76,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I grew up in a beauty shop in North Philadelphia,

59
0:02:41.12,000 --> 0:02:43,000
my mom's beauty shop, looking at "Ebony Magazine,"

60
0:02:43.52,000 --> 0:02:47,000
found images that told stories that were often not in the daily news,

61
0:02:48.48,000 --> 0:02:49,000
but in the family album.

62
0:02:50.08,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I wanted the family album to be energetic for me,

63
0:02:53.08,000 --> 0:02:54,000
a way of telling stories,

64
0:02:54.76,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and one day I happened upon a book in the Philadelphia Public Library

65
0:02:58.64,000 --> 0:03:02,000
called "The Sweet Flypaper of Life" by Roy DeCarava and Langston Hughes.

66
0:03:03.04,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I think what attracted me as a seven-year-old,

67
0:03:05.24,000 --> 0:03:07,000
the title, flypaper and sweet,

68
0:03:08.2,000 --> 0:03:1,000
but to think about that as a seven-year-old,

69
0:03:10.32,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I looked at the beautiful images that Roy DeCarava made

70
0:03:13.72,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and then looked at ways that I could tell a story about life.

71
0:03:17.4,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And looking for me is the act that basically changed my life.

72
0:03:21.92,000 --> 0:03:24,000
HWT: My friend Chris Johnson told me that every photographer,

73
0:03:25.52,000 --> 0:03:29,000
every artist, is essentially trying to answer one question,

74
0:03:29.76,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and I think your question might have been,

75
0:03:32.04,000 --> 0:03:35,000
"Why doesn't the rest of the world see how beautiful we are,

76
0:03:35.4,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and what can I do to help them see our community the way I do?"

77
0:03:39.32,000 --> 0:03:4,000
DW: While studying in art school --

78
0:03:41.04,000 --> 0:03:42,000
it's probably true --

79
0:03:42.48,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I had a male professor who told me that I was taking up a good man's space.

80
0:03:47.12,000 --> 0:03:5,000
He tried to stifle my dream of becoming a photographer.

81
0:03:50.52,000 --> 0:03:53,000
He attempted to shame me in a class full of male photographers.

82
0:03:54.36,000 --> 0:03:57,000
He told me I was out of place and out of order as a woman,

83
0:03:58.28,000 --> 0:04:,000
and he went on to say that all you could and would do

84
0:04:01.28,000 --> 0:04:05,000
was to have a baby when a good man could have had your seat in this class.

85
0:04:05.6,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I was shocked into silence into that experience.

86
0:04:09.2,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But I had my camera, and I was determined to prove to him

87
0:04:12.04,000 --> 0:04:14,000
that I was worthy for a seat in that class.

88
0:04:14.56,000 --> 0:04:17,000
But in retrospect, I asked myself: "Why did I need to prove it to him?"

89
0:04:18.08,000 --> 0:04:21,000
You know, I had my camera, and I knew I needed to prove to myself

90
0:04:21.44,000 --> 0:04:23,000
that I would make a difference in photography.

91
0:04:23.64,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I love photography, and no one is going to stop me from making images.

92
0:04:27.76,000 --> 0:04:28,000
HWT: But that's when I came in.

93
0:04:29.279,000 --> 0:04:31,000
DW: Yeah, that year I graduated, I got pregnant.

94
0:04:32.24,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Yep, he was right.

95
0:04:34.6,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And I had you,

96
0:04:35.84,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and I shook off that sexist language that he used against me

97
0:04:40.8,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and picked up my camera and made photographs daily,

98
0:04:43.8,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and made photographs of my pregnant belly as I prepared for graduate school.

99
0:04:48.48,000 --> 0:04:51,000
But I thought about also that black photographers were missing

100
0:04:52.44,000 --> 0:04:55,000
from the history books of photography,

101
0:04:55.52,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and I was looking for ways to tell a story.

102
0:04:58.48,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And I ran across Gordon Parks' book "A Choice of Weapons,"

103
0:05:03.12,000 --> 0:05:04,000
which was his autobiography.

104
0:05:04.84,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I began photographing and making images,

105
0:05:07.4,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and I tucked away that contact sheet that I made of my pregnant belly,

106
0:05:11.72,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and then you inspired me to create a new piece,

107
0:05:14.32,000 --> 0:05:18,000
a piece that said, "A woman taking a place from a good man,"

108
0:05:18.64,000 --> 0:05:19,000
"You took the space from a good man,"

109
0:05:20.48,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and then I used that language and reversed it and said,

110
0:05:24.08,000 --> 0:05:26,000
"I made a space for a good man, you."

111
0:05:26.92,000 --> 0:05:27,000
(Applause)

112
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
HWT: Thanks, ma.

113
0:05:33.04,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Like mother, like son.

114
0:05:35.24,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I grew up in a house full of photographs.

115
0:05:38.84,000 --> 0:05:42,000
They were everywhere, and my mother would turn the kitchen into a darkroom.

116
0:05:42.88,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And there weren't just pictures that she took

117
0:05:45.04,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and pictures of family members.

118
0:05:46.6,000 --> 0:05:5,000
But there were pictures on the wall of and by people that we didn't know,

119
0:05:51.2,000 --> 0:05:53,000
men and women that we didn't know.

120
0:05:53.24,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Thanks, ma.

121
0:05:54.48,000 --> 0:05:55,000
(Laughter)

122
0:05:55.72,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I have my own timing.

123
0:05:56.96,000 --> 0:05:57,000
(Laughter)

124
0:05:58.64,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Did you see her poke me?

125
0:05:59.88,000 --> 0:06:,000
(Laughter)

126
0:06:01.12,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Puppet strings.

127
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I grew up in a house full of photographs.

128
0:06:08.32,000 --> 0:06:11,000
(Applause)

129
0:06:11.56,000 --> 0:06:13,000
But they weren't just pictures of men and women that we knew,

130
0:06:14.48,000 --> 0:06:17,000
but pictures of people that I didn't know,

131
0:06:17.64,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Pretty much, it was pretty clear from what I learned in school,

132
0:06:20.64,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that the rest of the world didn't either.

133
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And it took me a long time to figure out what she was up to,

134
0:06:26.64,000 --> 0:06:29,000
but after a while, I figured it out.

135
0:06:30.28,000 --> 0:06:32,000
When I was nine years old, she published this book,

136
0:06:32.72,000 --> 0:06:35,000
"Black Photographers, 1840-1940: A Bio-Bibliography."

137
0:06:36.64,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And it's astounding to me to consider

138
0:06:39.04,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that in 1840, African Americans were making photographs.

139
0:06:43.28,000 --> 0:06:44,000
What does it mean for us to think

140
0:06:44.92,000 --> 0:06:48,000
that at a time that was two, three decades before the end of slavery,

141
0:06:49.6,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that people were learning how to read,

142
0:06:52.8,000 --> 0:06:53,000
they had to learn how to do math,

143
0:06:54.44,000 --> 0:06:56,000
they had to be on the cutting edge of science and technology,

144
0:06:57.36,000 --> 0:07:01,000
to do math, physics and chemistry just to make a single photograph.

145
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And what compelled them to do that if not love?

146
0:07:05.2,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Well, that book led her to her next book, "Black Photographers, 1940-1988,"

147
0:07:10.28,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and that book led to another book, and another book, and another book,

148
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and another book, and another book,

149
0:07:17.28,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and another book, and another book,

150
0:07:19,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and another book, and another book, and another book, and another book,

151
0:07:22.36,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and another book, and another book, and another book, and another book,

152
0:07:25.72,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and another book, and another book, and another.

153
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:29,000
(Applause)

154
0:07:29.76,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And throughout my life,

155
0:07:31.12,000 --> 0:07:34,000
she's edited and published dozens of books

156
0:07:34.68,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and curated numerous exhibitions on every continent,

157
0:07:39.4,000 --> 0:07:42,000
not all about black photographers but all inspired by the curiosity

158
0:07:42.96,000 --> 0:07:44,000
of a little black girl from North Philadelphia.

159
0:07:45.52,000 --> 0:07:48,000
DW: What I found is that black photographers had stories to tell,

160
0:07:48.96,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and we needed to listen.

161
0:07:51.12,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And then I found and I discovered

162
0:07:52.76,000 --> 0:07:54,000
black photographers like Augustus Washington,

163
0:07:55.72,000 --> 0:07:57,000
who made these beautiful daguerreotypes

164
0:07:57.96,000 --> 0:08:01,000
of the McGill family in the early 1840s and '50s.

165
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Their stories tended to be different, black photographers,

166
0:08:04.96,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and they had a different narrative about black life during slavery,

167
0:08:08.96,000 --> 0:08:12,000
but it was also about family life, beauty and telling stories about community.

168
0:08:13.64,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I didn't know how to link the stories,

169
0:08:16.28,000 --> 0:08:19,000
but I knew that teachers needed to know this story.

170
0:08:19.8,000 --> 0:08:23,000
HWT: So I think I was my mother's first student.

171
0:08:24.28,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Unwillingly and unwittingly -- puppet strings --

172
0:08:27.88,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I decided to pick up a camera,

173
0:08:30.44,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and thought that I should make my own pictures

174
0:08:32.64,000 --> 0:08:34,000
about the then and now and the now and then.

175
0:08:35.04,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I thought about how I could use photography

176
0:08:38.44,000 --> 0:08:41,000
to talk about how what's going on outside of the frame of the camera

177
0:08:41.8,000 --> 0:08:43,000
can affect what we see inside.

178
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:47,000
The truth is always in the hands of the actual image maker

179
0:08:47.32,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and it's up to us to really consider what's being cut out.

180
0:08:50.4,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I thought I could use her research as a jumping-off point

181
0:08:53.32,000 --> 0:08:54,000
of things that I was seeing in society

182
0:08:55.32,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and I wanted to start to think about how I could use historical images

183
0:08:58.84,000 --> 0:09:01,000
to talk about the past being present

184
0:09:01.88,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and think about ways that we can speak

185
0:09:03.76,000 --> 0:09:06,000
to the perennial struggle for human rights and equal rights

186
0:09:07.48,000 --> 0:09:1,000
through my appropriation of photographs

187
0:09:11.12,000 --> 0:09:14,000
in the form of sculpture, video,

188
0:09:14.52,000 --> 0:09:15,000
installation and paintings.

189
0:09:15.88,000 --> 0:09:19,000
But through it all, one piece has affected me the most.

190
0:09:20.24,000 --> 0:09:21,000
It continues to nourish me.

191
0:09:21.92,000 --> 0:09:23,000
It's based off of this photograph by Ernest Withers,

192
0:09:24.4,000 --> 0:09:26,000
who took this picture in 1968

193
0:09:26.84,000 --> 0:09:28,000
at the Memphis Sanitation Workers March

194
0:09:29.24,000 --> 0:09:33,000
of men and women standing collectively to affirm their humanity.

195
0:09:33.92,000 --> 0:09:35,000
They were holding signs that said "I am a man,"

196
0:09:36.48,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and I found that astounding, because the phrase I grew up with

197
0:09:39.44,000 --> 0:09:42,000
wasn't "I am a man," it was "I am the man,"

198
0:09:42.56,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and I was amazed at how it went from this collective statement during segregation

199
0:09:46.76,000 --> 0:09:49,000
to this seemingly selfish statement after integration.

200
0:09:50.48,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And I wanted to ponder that,

201
0:09:52.48,000 --> 0:09:55,000
so I decided to remix that text in as many ways as I could think of,

202
0:09:55.72,000 --> 0:10:,000
and I like to think of the top line as a timeline of American history,

203
0:10:00.84,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and the last line as a poem,

204
0:10:03.12,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and it says,

205
0:10:04.4,000 --> 0:10:06,000
"I am the man. Who's the man. You the man. What a man.

206
0:10:07.24,000 --> 0:10:09,000
I am man. I am many. I am, am I.

207
0:10:10.04,000 --> 0:10:12,000
I am, I am. I am, Amen.

208
0:10:12.96,000 --> 0:10:13,000
DW: Wow, so fascinating.

209
0:10:14.96,000 --> 0:10:15,000
(Applause)

210
0:10:16.2,000 --> 0:10:17,000
But what we learn from this experience

211
0:10:18.08,000 --> 0:10:21,000
is the most powerful two words in the English language is, "I am."

212
0:10:21.96,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And we each have the capacity to love.

213
0:10:24.6,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Thank you.

214
0:10:25.84,000 --> 0:10:29,000
(Applause)

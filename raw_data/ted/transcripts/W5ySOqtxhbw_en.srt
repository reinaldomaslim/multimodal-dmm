1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I've been at MIT for 44 years.

2
0:00:27.92,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I went to TED I.

3
0:00:29.88,000 --> 0:00:31,000
There's only one other person here, I think, who did that.

4
0:00:32.76,000 --> 0:00:33,000
All the other TEDs --

5
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and I went to them all, under Ricky's regime --

6
0:00:36.28,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I talked about what the Media Lab was doing,

7
0:00:38.84,000 --> 0:00:41,000
which today has almost 500 people in it.

8
0:00:41.88,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And if you read the press,

9
0:00:43.32,000 --> 0:00:45,000
last week it actually said I quit the Media Lab.

10
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I didn't quit the Media Lab, I stepped down as chairman --

11
0:00:50.2,000 --> 0:00:54,000
which was a kind of ridiculous title, but someone else has taken it on --

12
0:00:54.92,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and one of the things you can do as a professor

13
0:00:57.135,000 --> 0:00:58,000
is you stay on as a professor.

14
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And I will now do for the rest of my life the One Laptop Per Child,

15
0:01:03.28,000 --> 0:01:06,000
which I've sort of been doing for a year and a half, anyway.

16
0:01:06.32,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So I'm going to tell you about this,

17
0:01:08.08,000 --> 0:01:12,000
use my 18 minutes to tell you why we're doing it,

18
0:01:12.2,000 --> 0:01:14,000
how we're doing it and then what we're doing.

19
0:01:14.4,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And at some point I'll even pass around

20
0:01:17.72,000 --> 0:01:2,000
what the $100 laptop might be like.

21
0:01:23.8,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I was asked by Chris to talk about some of the big issues,

22
0:01:26.68,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and so I figured I'd start with the three that at least drove me to do this.

23
0:01:31.96,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And the first is pretty obvious.

24
0:01:34.8,000 --> 0:01:36,000
It's amazing when you meet a head of state, and you say,

25
0:01:37.48,000 --> 0:01:39,000
"What is your most precious natural resource?"

26
0:01:40.24,000 --> 0:01:42,000
They will not say "children" at first,

27
0:01:42.96,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and then when you say, "children," they will pretty quickly agree with you.

28
0:01:47.239,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And so that isn't very hard.

29
0:01:49.28,000 --> 0:01:51,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Everybody agrees that whatever the solutions are to the big problems,

31
0:01:57.08,000 --> 0:02:01,000
they include education, sometimes can be just education

32
0:02:01.84,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and can never be without some element of education.

33
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So that's certainly part of it.

34
0:02:07,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And the third is a little bit less obvious.

35
0:02:09.4,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And that is that we all in this room learned how to walk, how to talk,

36
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
not by being taught how to talk, or taught how to walk,

37
0:02:18.68,000 --> 0:02:19,000
but by interacting with the world,

38
0:02:20.4,000 --> 0:02:24,000
by having certain results as a consequence of being able to ask for something,

39
0:02:24.56,000 --> 0:02:26,000
or being able to stand up and reach it.

40
0:02:26.72,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Whereas at about the age six, we were told to stop learning that way,

41
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and that all learning from then on would happen through teaching,

42
0:02:34.36,000 --> 0:02:36,000
whether it's people standing up, like I'm doing now,

43
0:02:36.813,000 --> 0:02:37,000
or a book, or something.

44
0:02:38.56,000 --> 0:02:39,000
But it was really through teaching.

45
0:02:40.52,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And one of the things in general that computers have provided to learning

46
0:02:45.72,000 --> 0:02:48,000
is that it now includes a kind of learning

47
0:02:48.88,000 --> 0:02:51,000
which is a little bit more like walking and talking,

48
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:58,000
in the sense that a lot of it is driven by the learner himself or herself.

49
0:02:58.64,000 --> 0:03:,000
So with those as the principles --

50
0:03:01.4,000 --> 0:03:03,000
some of you may know Seymour Papert.

51
0:03:03.44,000 --> 0:03:06,000
This is back in 1982, when we were working in Senegal.

52
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Because some people think that the $100 laptop just happened a year ago,

53
0:03:12.269,000 --> 0:03:15,000
or two years ago, or we were struck by lightning --

54
0:03:15.48,000 --> 0:03:2,000
this actually has gone back a long time, and in fact, back to the '60s.

55
0:03:20.56,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Here we're in the '80s.

56
0:03:22.12,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Steve Jobs had given us some laptops. We were in Senegal.

57
0:03:26.4,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It didn't scale

58
0:03:27.68,000 --> 0:03:32,000
but it at least was bringing computers to developing countries

59
0:03:32.8,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and learning pretty quickly that these kids,

60
0:03:35.28,000 --> 0:03:37,000
even though English wasn't their language,

61
0:03:37.304,000 --> 0:03:4,000
the Latin alphabet barely was their language,

62
0:03:40.56,000 --> 0:03:42,000
but they could just swim like fish.

63
0:03:42.92,000 --> 0:03:43,000
They could play these like pianos.

64
0:03:46.36,000 --> 0:03:5,000
A little bit more recently, I got involved personally.

65
0:03:50.6,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And these are two anecdotes --

66
0:03:52.36,000 --> 0:03:54,000
one was in Cambodia,

67
0:03:55,000 --> 0:03:59,000
in a village that has no electricity, no water, no television, no telephone,

68
0:03:59.44,000 --> 0:04:01,000
but has broadband Internet now.

69
0:04:01.6,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And these kids, their first English word is "Google"

70
0:04:05.12,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and they only know Skype.

71
0:04:07.48,000 --> 0:04:08,000
They've never heard of telephony.

72
0:04:09.12,000 --> 0:04:11,000
They just use Skype.

73
0:04:11.28,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And they go home at night --

74
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
they've got a broadband connection in a hut that doesn't have electricity.

75
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:19,000
The parents love it, because when they open up the laptops,

76
0:04:19.786,000 --> 0:04:21,000
it's the brightest light source in the house.

77
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And talk about where metaphors and reality mix --

78
0:04:25.4,000 --> 0:04:27,000
this is the actual school.

79
0:04:28.56,000 --> 0:04:33,000
In parallel with this, Seymour Papert got the governor of Maine

80
0:04:33.68,000 --> 0:04:38,000
to legislate one laptop per child in the year 2002.

81
0:04:39.2,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Now at the time, I think it's fair to say that 80 percent of the teachers were --

82
0:04:44.32,000 --> 0:04:45,000
let me say, apprehensive.

83
0:04:45.92,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Really, they were actually against it.

84
0:04:47.76,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And they really preferred that the money would be used

85
0:04:50.308,000 --> 0:04:52,000
for higher salaries, more schools, whatever.

86
0:04:52.72,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And now, three and a half years later, guess what?

87
0:04:57,000 --> 0:05:03,000
They're reporting five things: drop of truancy to almost zero,

88
0:05:03.24,000 --> 0:05:04,000
attending parent-teacher meetings --

89
0:05:05.189,000 --> 0:05:07,000
which nobody did and now almost everybody does --

90
0:05:07.72,000 --> 0:05:1,000
drop in discipline problems, increase in student participation.

91
0:05:11.64,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Teachers are now saying it's kind of fun to teach.

92
0:05:14.08,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Kids are engaged -- they have laptops! --

93
0:05:17.24,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and then the fifth, which interests me the most,

94
0:05:19.72,000 --> 0:05:22,000
is that the servers have to be turned off at certain times at night

95
0:05:22.96,000 --> 0:05:24,000
because the teachers are getting too much email

96
0:05:25.4,000 --> 0:05:26,000
from the kids asking them for help.

97
0:05:27.4,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So when you see that kind of thing --

98
0:05:29.2,000 --> 0:05:31,000
this is not something that you have to test.

99
0:05:31.272,000 --> 0:05:33,000
The days of pilot projects are over, when people say,

100
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:38,000
"We'd like to do three or four thousand in our country to see how it works."

101
0:05:38.08,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Screw you. Go to the back of the line and someone else will do it,

102
0:05:41.2,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and then when you figure out that this works, you can join as well.

103
0:05:45.76,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And this is what we're doing.

104
0:05:48.36,000 --> 0:05:5,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

105
0:05:50.52,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So, One Laptop Per Child was formed about a year and a half ago.

106
0:05:55.52,000 --> 0:05:56,000
It's a nonprofit association.

107
0:05:57.44,000 --> 0:05:58,000
It raised about 20 million dollars

108
0:05:59.4,000 --> 0:06:02,000
to do the engineering to just get this built,

109
0:06:03.24,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and then have it produced afterwards.

110
0:06:05.92,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Scale is truly important.

111
0:06:08.2,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And it's not important because you can buy components at a lower price, OK?

112
0:06:14.52,000 --> 0:06:16,000
It's because you can go to a manufacturer --

113
0:06:17.42,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and I will leave the name out --

114
0:06:19.086,000 --> 0:06:22,000
but we wanted a small display,

115
0:06:22.64,000 --> 0:06:25,000
doesn't have to have perfect color uniformity.

116
0:06:26.44,000 --> 0:06:28,000
It can even have a pixel or two missing.

117
0:06:28.826,000 --> 0:06:3,000
It doesn't have to be that bright.

118
0:06:31.4,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And this particular manufacturer said,

119
0:06:33.72,000 --> 0:06:36,000
"We're not interested in that. We're interested in the living room.

120
0:06:36.887,000 --> 0:06:38,000
We're interested in perfect color uniformity.

121
0:06:39.08,000 --> 0:06:41,000
We're interested in big displays, bright displays.

122
0:06:41.44,000 --> 0:06:43,000
You're not part of our strategic plan."

123
0:06:44.24,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And I said, "That's kind of too bad, because we need 100 million units a year."

124
0:06:47.979,000 --> 0:06:48,000
(Laughter)

125
0:06:49.574,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And they said, "Oh, well, maybe we could become part of your strategic plan."

126
0:06:53.56,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And that's why scale counts.

127
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And that's why we will not launch this

128
0:06:58.28,000 --> 0:07:01,000
without five to 10 million units in the first run.

129
0:07:02.2,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And the idea is to launch with enough scale

130
0:07:05.2,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that the scale itself helps bring the price down,

131
0:07:07.8,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and that's why I said seven to 10 million there.

132
0:07:11.72,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And we're doing it without a sales-and-marketing team.

133
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I mean, you're looking at the sales-and-marketing team.

134
0:07:17.76,000 --> 0:07:21,000
We will do it by going to seven large countries

135
0:07:21.8,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and getting them to agree and launch it,

136
0:07:24.348,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and then the others can follow.

137
0:07:26.68,000 --> 0:07:27,000
We have partners.

138
0:07:28.56,000 --> 0:07:3,000
It's not hard to guess Google would be one.

139
0:07:30.584,000 --> 0:07:33,000
The others are all playing to pending.

140
0:07:34.24,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And this has been in the press a great deal.

141
0:07:37.12,000 --> 0:07:42,000
It's the so-called Green Machine that we introduced with Kofi Annan

142
0:07:43.04,000 --> 0:07:47,000
in November at the World Summit that was held in Tunisia.

143
0:07:47.36,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Now once people start looking at this, they say, "Ah, this is a laptop project."

144
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Well, no, it's not a laptop project. It's an education project.

145
0:07:56.32,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And the fun part -- and I'm quite focused on it --

146
0:08:,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I tell people I used to be a light bulb, but now I'm a laser --

147
0:08:04.12,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I'm just going to get that thing built, and it turns out it's not so hard.

148
0:08:10.24,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Because laptop economics are the following:

149
0:08:13.48,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I say 50 percent here -- it's more like 60,

150
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
60 percent of the cost of your laptop

151
0:08:18.08,000 --> 0:08:2,000
is sales, marketing, distribution and profit.

152
0:08:20.96,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Now we have none of those, OK?

153
0:08:23.32,000 --> 0:08:25,000
None of those figure into our cost,

154
0:08:26.28,000 --> 0:08:3,000
because first of all, we sell it at cost, and the governments distribute it.

155
0:08:30.52,000 --> 0:08:34,000
It gets distributed to the school system like a textbook.

156
0:08:34.8,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So that piece disappears.

157
0:08:36.96,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Then you have display and everything else.

158
0:08:39.8,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Now the display on your laptop costs,

159
0:08:42.68,000 --> 0:08:47,000
in rough numbers, 10 dollars a diagonal inch.

160
0:08:47.84,000 --> 0:08:49,000
That can drop to eight; it can drop to seven

161
0:08:5,000 --> 0:08:52,000
but it's not going to drop to two, or to one and a half,

162
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:55,000
unless we do some pretty clever things.

163
0:08:57.08,000 --> 0:09:01,000
It's the rest -- that little brown box -- that is pretty fascinating,

164
0:09:01.28,000 --> 0:09:06,000
because the rest of your laptop is devoted to itself.

165
0:09:06.72,000 --> 0:09:08,000
It's a little bit like an obese person

166
0:09:09.36,000 --> 0:09:12,000
having to use most of their energy to move their obesity.

167
0:09:12.52,000 --> 0:09:13,000
(Laughter)

168
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And we have a situation today which is incredible.

169
0:09:19.8,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I've been using laptops since their inception.

170
0:09:22.8,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And my laptop runs slower, less reliably and less pleasantly

171
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
than it ever has before.

172
0:09:30.72,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And this year is worse.

173
0:09:32.24,000 --> 0:09:33,000
(Applause)

174
0:09:33.64,000 --> 0:09:36,000
People clap, sometimes you even get standing ovations,

175
0:09:36.96,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and I say, "What the hell's wrong with you? Why are we all sitting there?"

176
0:09:40.68,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And somebody -- to remain nameless -- called our laptop a "gadget" recently.

177
0:09:47.04,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And I said, "God, our laptop's going to go like a bat out of hell.

178
0:09:50.68,000 --> 0:09:52,000
When you open it up, it's going to go 'bing.'"

179
0:09:52.9,000 --> 0:09:53,000
It'll be on.

180
0:09:54.2,000 --> 0:09:57,000
It'll be just like it was in 1985,

181
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:02,000
when you bought an Apple Macintosh 512.

182
0:10:02.72,000 --> 0:10:03,000
It worked really well.

183
0:10:04.48,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And we've been going steadily downhill.

184
0:10:07.6,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Now, people ask all the time what it is.

185
0:10:11.56,000 --> 0:10:13,000
That's what it is.

186
0:10:13.64,000 --> 0:10:18,000
The two pieces that are probably notable: it'll be a mesh network,

187
0:10:18.96,000 --> 0:10:21,000
so when the kids open up their laptops, they all become a network,

188
0:10:22.6,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and then just need one or two points of backhaul.

189
0:10:25.44,000 --> 0:10:28,000
You can serve a couple of thousand kids with two megabits.

190
0:10:28.64,000 --> 0:10:31,000
So you really can bring into a village,

191
0:10:31.72,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and then the villages can connect themselves,

192
0:10:34.04,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and you really can do it quite well.

193
0:10:37.12,000 --> 0:10:38,000
The dual mode display --

194
0:10:39.12,000 --> 0:10:43,000
the idea is to have a display that both works outdoors --

195
0:10:43.84,000 --> 0:10:46,000
isn't it fun using your cell phone outdoors in the sunlight?

196
0:10:47.28,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Well, you can't see it.

197
0:10:48.84,000 --> 0:10:5,000
And one of the reasons you can't see it

198
0:10:51.04,000 --> 0:10:55,000
is because it's backlighting most of the time, most cell phones.

199
0:10:55.12,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Now, what we're doing is, we're doing one that will be both frontlit and backlit.

200
0:10:59.8,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And whether you manually switch it or you do it in the software

201
0:11:03.6,000 --> 0:11:04,000
is to be seen.

202
0:11:05.12,000 --> 0:11:06,000
But when it's backlit, it's color.

203
0:11:07,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And when it's frontlit, it's black and white

204
0:11:09.08,000 --> 0:11:1,000
at three times the resolution.

205
0:11:11.08,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Is it all worked out? No.

206
0:11:13.56,000 --> 0:11:18,000
That's why a lot of our people are more or less living in Taiwan right now.

207
0:11:18.84,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And in about 30 days, we'll know for sure whether this works.

208
0:11:23.08,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Probably the most important piece there

209
0:11:27.32,000 --> 0:11:3,000
is that the kids really can do the maintenance.

210
0:11:30.48,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And this is again something that people don't believe,

211
0:11:33.64,000 --> 0:11:34,000
but I really think it's quite true.

212
0:11:36.88,000 --> 0:11:4,000
That's the machine we showed in Tunis.

213
0:11:41.8,000 --> 0:11:43,000
This is more the direction that we're going to go.

214
0:11:44.6,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And it's something that we didn't think was possible.

215
0:11:47.96,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Now, I'm going to pass this around.

216
0:11:51.32,000 --> 0:11:53,000
This isn't a design, OK?

217
0:11:53.52,000 --> 0:11:57,000
So this is just a mechanical engineering sort of embodiment of it

218
0:11:58.24,000 --> 0:11:59,000
for you to play with.

219
0:11:59.8,000 --> 0:12:,000
And it's clearly just a model.

220
0:12:01.68,000 --> 0:12:03,000
The working one is at MIT.

221
0:12:04.4,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I'm going to pass it to this handsome gentleman.

222
0:12:07.28,000 --> 0:12:09,000
At least you can decide whether it goes left or --

223
0:12:09.76,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Chris Anderson: Before you do it, for the people down in simulcast --

224
0:12:13.084,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Nicholas Negroponte: Sorry! I forgot. CA: Just show it off a bit.

225
0:12:16.17,000 --> 0:12:19,000
So wherever the camera is -- OK, good point. Thank you, Chris.

226
0:12:19.2,000 --> 0:12:22,000
The idea was that it would be not only a laptop,

227
0:12:22.8,000 --> 0:12:25,000
but that it could transform into an electronic book.

228
0:12:26.4,000 --> 0:12:27,000
So it's sort of an electronic book.

229
0:12:28.091,000 --> 0:12:3,000
This is where when you go outside, it's in black and white.

230
0:12:30.877,000 --> 0:12:31,000
The games buttons are missing,

231
0:12:32.68,000 --> 0:12:34,000
but it'll also be a games machine,

232
0:12:34.999,000 --> 0:12:35,000
book machine.

233
0:12:36.36,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Set it up this way, and it's a television set.

234
0:12:38.88,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Etc., etc. -- is that enough for simulcast? OK, sorry.

235
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
I'll let Jim decide which way to send it afterwards.

236
0:12:48.04,000 --> 0:12:49,000
OK. Seven countries.

237
0:12:49.76,000 --> 0:12:5,000
(Laughter)

238
0:12:51.36,000 --> 0:12:56,000
I say "maybe" for Massachusetts, because they actually have to do a bid.

239
0:12:56.44,000 --> 0:12:58,000
By law you've got to bid, and so on and so forth.

240
0:12:59.12,000 --> 0:13:,000
So I can't quite name them.

241
0:13:00.56,000 --> 0:13:02,000
In the other cases, they don't have to do bids.

242
0:13:03.24,000 --> 0:13:04,000
They can decide --

243
0:13:04.876,000 --> 0:13:06,000
it's the federal government in each case.

244
0:13:06.96,000 --> 0:13:07,000
It's kind of agonizing,

245
0:13:08.2,000 --> 0:13:1,000
because a lot of people say, "Let's do it at the state level,"

246
0:13:11.129,000 --> 0:13:15,000
because states are more nimble than the feds, just because of size.

247
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And yet we count.

248
0:13:17.2,000 --> 0:13:19,000
We're really dealing with the federal government.

249
0:13:19.6,000 --> 0:13:21,000
We're really dealing with ministries of education.

250
0:13:21.96,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And if you look at governments around the world,

251
0:13:24.68,000 --> 0:13:27,000
ministries of education tend to be the most conservative,

252
0:13:28.44,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and also the ones that have huge payrolls.

253
0:13:32.64,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Everybody thinks they know about education,

254
0:13:35.04,000 --> 0:13:37,000
a lot of culture is built into it as well.

255
0:13:37.52,000 --> 0:13:4,000
It's really hard. And so it's certainly the hard road.

256
0:13:41.2,000 --> 0:13:45,000
If you look at the countries, they're pretty geoculturally distributed.

257
0:13:46,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Have they all agreed? No, not completely.

258
0:13:48.52,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Probably Thailand, Brazil and Nigeria

259
0:13:50.92,000 --> 0:13:53,000
are the three that are the most active and most agreed.

260
0:13:54.04,000 --> 0:13:57,000
We're purposely not signing anything with anybody

261
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
until we actually have the working ones.

262
0:13:59.48,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And since I visit each one of those countries

263
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
within at least every three months,

264
0:14:04.2,000 --> 0:14:07,000
I'm just going around the world every three weeks.

265
0:14:07.36,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Here's sort of the schedule

266
0:14:08.92,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and I put at the bottom we might give some away free in two years at this meeting.

267
0:14:15.422,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Everybody says it's a $100 laptop --

268
0:14:18.559,000 --> 0:14:19,000
you can't do it.

269
0:14:19.734,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Well, guess what, we're not.

270
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
We're coming in probably at 135, to start, then drift down.

271
0:14:26.24,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And that's very important,

272
0:14:27.72,000 --> 0:14:32,000
because so many things hit the market at a price and then drift up.

273
0:14:33.04,000 --> 0:14:34,000
It's kind of the loss leader,

274
0:14:34.56,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and then as soon as it looks interesting,

275
0:14:37.44,000 --> 0:14:39,000
it can't be afforded, or it can't be scaled out.

276
0:14:40.12,000 --> 0:14:43,000
So we're targeting 50 dollars in 2010.

277
0:14:43.56,000 --> 0:14:44,000
The gray market's a big issue.

278
0:14:45.36,000 --> 0:14:47,000
And one of the ways -- just one --

279
0:14:47.76,000 --> 0:14:51,000
but one of the ways to help in the case of the gray market

280
0:14:51.84,000 --> 0:14:53,000
is to make something that is so utterly unique --

281
0:14:54.4,000 --> 0:14:57,000
It's a little bit like the fact that automobiles --

282
0:14:58.04,000 --> 0:15:01,000
thousands of automobiles are stolen every day in the United States.

283
0:15:01.72,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Not one single post-office truck is stolen.

284
0:15:04.68,000 --> 0:15:05,000
(Laughter)

285
0:15:05.92,000 --> 0:15:06,000
And why?

286
0:15:07.12,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Because there's no market for post-office trucks.

287
0:15:09.48,000 --> 0:15:1,000
It looks like a post-office truck.

288
0:15:11.24,000 --> 0:15:13,000
You can spray paint it. You can do anything you want.

289
0:15:13.741,000 --> 0:15:17,000
I just learned recently: in South Africa, no white Volvos are stolen.

290
0:15:17.96,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Period. None. Zero.

291
0:15:19.56,000 --> 0:15:23,000
So we want to make it very much like a white Volvo.

292
0:15:24.36,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Each government has a task force.

293
0:15:26.6,000 --> 0:15:27,000
This perhaps is less interesting,

294
0:15:28.24,000 --> 0:15:3,000
but we're trying to get the governments to all work together

295
0:15:31.169,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and it's not easy.

296
0:15:34.88,000 --> 0:15:39,000
The economics of this is to start with the federal governments

297
0:15:39.951,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and then later, to subsequently go to other --

298
0:15:46.957,000 --> 0:15:47,000
whether it's child-to-child funding,

299
0:15:48.877,000 --> 0:15:52,000
so a child in this country buys one for a child in the developing world,

300
0:15:53.36,000 --> 0:15:56,000
maybe of the same gender, maybe of the same age.

301
0:15:56.48,000 --> 0:15:59,000
An uncle gives a niece or a nephew that as a birthday present.

302
0:16:00.2,000 --> 0:16:02,000
I mean, there are all sorts of things that will happen,

303
0:16:02.92,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and they'll be very, very exciting.

304
0:16:04.84,000 --> 0:16:08,000
And everybody says -- I say -- it's an education project.

305
0:16:09.859,000 --> 0:16:1,000
Are we providing the software?

306
0:16:11.88,000 --> 0:16:12,000
The answer is:

307
0:16:13.389,000 --> 0:16:14,000
The system certainly has software,

308
0:16:15.04,000 --> 0:16:18,000
but no, we're not providing the education content.

309
0:16:18.2,000 --> 0:16:22,000
That is really done in the countries.

310
0:16:22.32,000 --> 0:16:24,000
But we are certainly constructionists.

311
0:16:24.42,000 --> 0:16:26,000
And we certainly believe in learning by doing

312
0:16:26.6,000 --> 0:16:3,000
and everything from Logo, which was started in 1968,

313
0:16:30.76,000 --> 0:16:34,000
to more modern things, like Scratch, if you've ever even heard of it,

314
0:16:35.76,000 --> 0:16:37,000
are very, very much part of it.

315
0:16:37.84,000 --> 0:16:38,000
And that's the rollout.

316
0:16:40.88,000 --> 0:16:42,000
Are we dreaming? Is this real?

317
0:16:43.143,000 --> 0:16:44,000
It actually is real.

318
0:16:45.76,000 --> 0:16:49,000
The only criticism, and people really don't want to criticize this,

319
0:16:50.52,000 --> 0:16:53,000
because it is a humanitarian effort, a nonprofit effort

320
0:16:54.4,000 --> 0:16:57,000
and to criticize it is a little bit stupid, actually.

321
0:16:58.24,000 --> 0:16:59,000
(Laughter)

322
0:16:59.48,000 --> 0:17:05,000
But the one thing that people could criticize was,

323
0:17:05.64,000 --> 0:17:08,000
"Great idea, but these guys can't do it."

324
0:17:09.8,000 --> 0:17:13,000
And that could either mean these guys, professors and so on couldn't do it,

325
0:17:14,000 --> 0:17:15,000
or that it's not possible.

326
0:17:16,000 --> 0:17:21,000
Well, on December 12, a company called Quanta agreed to build it,

327
0:17:21.72,000 --> 0:17:25,000
and since they make about one-third of all the laptops on the planet today,

328
0:17:26.68,000 --> 0:17:27,000
that question disappeared.

329
0:17:28.28,000 --> 0:17:31,000
So it's not a matter of whether it's going to happen.

330
0:17:31.52,000 --> 0:17:32,000
It is going to happen.

331
0:17:32.76,000 --> 0:17:36,000
And if it comes out at 138 dollars, so what?

332
0:17:37.204,000 --> 0:17:4,000
If it comes out six months late, so what?

333
0:17:40.23,000 --> 0:17:41,000
That's a pretty soft landing.

334
0:17:41.93,000 --> 0:17:42,000
Thank you.

335
0:17:43.49,000 --> 0:17:44,000
(Applause)

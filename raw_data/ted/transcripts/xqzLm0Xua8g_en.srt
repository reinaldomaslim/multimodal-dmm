0:00:12.389,000 --> 0:00:14,000
The hoodie is an amazing object.

3
0:00:14.764,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It's one of those timeless objects that we hardly think of,

4
0:00:19.693,000 --> 0:00:21,000
because they work so well that they're part of our lives.

5
0:00:22.373,000 --> 0:00:23,000
We call them "humble masterpieces."

[Paola Antonelli on the Hoodie]

9
0:00:30.722,000 --> 0:00:33,000
The hoodie has been -- even if it was not called so --

10
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:37,000
it's been an icon throughout history for good and for bad reasons.

11
0:00:38.286,000 --> 0:00:4,000
The earliest ones that we can trace

12
0:00:41.105,000 --> 0:00:43,000
are from ancient Greece and ancient Rome.

13
0:00:43.708,000 --> 0:00:45,000
The Middle Ages, you see a lot of monks

14
0:00:45.744,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that were wearing garments that were cape-like, with hoods attached,

15
0:00:49.724,000 --> 0:00:5,000
so therefore, "hoodies."

16
0:00:51.041,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Ladies in the 17th century would wear hoodies

17
0:00:53.975,000 --> 0:00:56,000
to kind of hide themselves when they were going to meet their lovers.

18
0:00:57.86,000 --> 0:01:,000
And then, of course, there's the legend, there's fantasy.

19
0:01:01.062,000 --> 0:01:03,000
There's the image of the hoodie connected to the grim reaper.

20
0:01:04.057,000 --> 0:01:07,000
There's the image of the hoodie connected to the executioner.

21
0:01:07.144,000 --> 0:01:09,000
So there's the dark side of the hoodie.

22
0:01:10.491,000 --> 0:01:12,000
The modern incarnation of the hoodie --

23
0:01:13.451,000 --> 0:01:15,000
a garment that's made usually of cotton jersey,

24
0:01:16.421,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that has a hood attached with a drawstring;

25
0:01:19.465,000 --> 0:01:21,000
sometimes it has a marsupial pocket --

26
0:01:22.046,000 --> 0:01:26,000
was introduced in the 1930s by Knickerbocker Knitting Company.

27
0:01:26.349,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Now it's called Champion.

28
0:01:28.267,000 --> 0:01:3,000
It was meant to keep athletes warm.

29
0:01:31.448,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Of course, though, it was such a functional, comfortable garment

30
0:01:35.568,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that it was very rapidly adopted by workmen everywhere.

31
0:01:39.654,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And then, around the 1980s, it also gets adopted

32
0:01:43.747,000 --> 0:01:46,000
by hip-hop and B-boys, skateboarders,

33
0:01:47.109,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and it takes on this kind of youth street culture.

34
0:01:50.246,000 --> 0:01:52,000
It was, at the same time, super-comfortable,

35
0:01:52.414,000 --> 0:01:53,000
perfect for the streets

36
0:01:53.589,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and also had that added value of anonymity

37
0:01:57.141,000 --> 0:01:58,000
when you needed it.

38
0:01:58.408,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And then we have Mark Zuckerberg,

39
0:02:00.086,000 --> 0:02:04,000
who defies convention of respectable attire for businesspeople.

40
0:02:04.962,000 --> 0:02:08,000
But interestingly, it's also a way to show how power has changed.

41
0:02:09.386,000 --> 0:02:11,000
If you're wearing a two-piece suit, you might be the bodyguard.

42
0:02:12.04,000 --> 0:02:16,000
The real powerful person is wearing a hoodie with a T-shirt and jeans.

43
0:02:17.531,000 --> 0:02:2,000
It's easy to think of the physical aspects of the hoodie.

44
0:02:21.017,000 --> 0:02:23,000
You can immediately think of wearing the hood up,

45
0:02:23.842,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and you feel this warmth and this protection,

46
0:02:26.551,000 --> 0:02:27,000
but at the same time,

47
0:02:27.974,000 --> 0:02:29,000
you can also feel the psychological aspects of it.

48
0:02:30.867,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I mean, think of donning a hoodie,

49
0:02:32.532,000 --> 0:02:34,000
all of a sudden, you feel more protected,

50
0:02:34.979,000 --> 0:02:38,000
you feel that you are in your own shell.

51
0:02:41.298,000 --> 0:02:44,000
We know very well what the hoodie has come to signify

52
0:02:45.035,000 --> 0:02:47,000
in the past few years in the United States.

53
0:02:47.648,000 --> 0:02:51,000
When Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old African-American kid,

54
0:02:52.215,000 --> 0:02:55,000
was shot by a neighborhood vigilante,

55
0:02:55.911,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and Million Hoodie Marches happened all over the United States,

56
0:03:00.084,000 --> 0:03:03,000
in which people wore hoodies with the hood up

57
0:03:03.196,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and marched in the streets against this kind of prejudice.

58
0:03:07.081,000 --> 0:03:08,000
It doesn't happen that often

59
0:03:09.01,000 --> 0:03:13,000
for a garment to have so much symbolism and history

60
0:03:13.835,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and that encompasses so many different universes

61
0:03:17.06,000 --> 0:03:18,000
as the hoodie.

62
0:03:18.656,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So, like all garments,

63
0:03:20.211,000 --> 0:03:22,000
especially all truly utilitarian garments,

64
0:03:23.233,000 --> 0:03:25,000
it is very basic in its design.

65
0:03:25.65,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But at the same time,

66
0:03:26.97,000 --> 0:03:29,000
it has a whole universe of possibilities attached.

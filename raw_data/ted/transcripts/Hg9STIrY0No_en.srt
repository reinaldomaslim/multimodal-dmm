1
0:00:14.426,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Mother Earth: Our end was imminent

2
0:00:17.674,000 --> 0:00:19,000
yet finality relented.

3
0:00:20.47,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Wind, water and fire gently revived;

4
0:00:24.497,000 --> 0:00:27,000
you and I reconciled,

5
0:00:27.9,000 --> 0:00:29,000
rhythms realigned,

6
0:00:29.98,000 --> 0:00:31,000
the blues gone green.

7
0:00:32.301,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Your care in conserving in exchange for my fruit

8
0:00:36.654,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and replenishing this picturous restoring of painted skies,

9
0:00:42.762,000 --> 0:00:43,000
mountains rolling,

10
0:00:44.617,000 --> 0:00:45,000
forest covering --

11
0:00:46.261,000 --> 0:00:47,000
no more warming.

12
0:00:48.247,000 --> 0:00:52,000
The purity and simplicity of how we used to be.

13
0:00:52.646,000 --> 0:00:53,000
You remember me?

14
0:00:54.185,000 --> 0:00:56,000
All I give to humanity?

15
0:00:56.877,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Housing, land, seas, birds,

16
0:01:00.667,000 --> 0:01:02,000
beast and all of mankind,

17
0:01:03.619,000 --> 0:01:08,000
exclusively the interface where you and the elements meet

18
0:01:09.153,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and vibrate harmoniously.

19
0:01:12.226,000 --> 0:01:14,000
(Piano plays)

20
0:01:17.252,000 --> 0:01:2,000

(Applause)

29
0:04:38.484,000 --> 0:04:39,000
My beauty altered,

30
0:04:39.688,000 --> 0:04:41,000
muddied waters, fields stripped bare,

31
0:04:42.117,000 --> 0:04:44,000
interior scarred beyond repair,

32
0:04:44.894,000 --> 0:04:46,000
our memories eroding.

33
0:04:47.848,000 --> 0:04:49,000
You once obsessed over my frame

34
0:04:50.357,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and how I came to be;

35
0:04:51.728,000 --> 0:04:53,000
my nature, its polarity --

36
0:04:54.167,000 --> 0:04:59,000
how my sweet winds whisper softly, yet assault seas.

37
0:04:59.871,000 --> 0:05:,000
You remember me?

38
0:05:01.365,000 --> 0:05:03,000
All I give to humanity?

39
0:05:04.087,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Housing, land, seas, birds,

40
0:05:07.948,000 --> 0:05:1,000
beast and all of mankind --

41
0:05:11.042,000 --> 0:05:16,000
exclusively the interface where you and the elements meet

42
0:05:16.392,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and vibrate harmoniously.

43
0:05:18.751,000 --> 0:05:21,000
The unseen traveler forever passing,

44
0:05:22.55,000 --> 0:05:23,000
carrying life,

45
0:05:24.061,000 --> 0:05:25,000
moving,

46
0:05:25.284,000 --> 0:05:28,000
awning of earth felt and heard,

47
0:05:28.752,000 --> 0:05:3,000
strong and stirring,

48
0:05:31.284,000 --> 0:05:32,000
blowing.

49
0:05:32.623,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Breathe you in, cleansing wind,

50
0:05:35.992,000 --> 0:05:36,000
gentle and still,

51
0:05:37.983,000 --> 0:05:38,000
quieter.

52
0:05:39.339,000 --> 0:05:41,000
The source eternally here,

53
0:05:42.025,000 --> 0:05:44,000
ascent and descending:

54
0:05:45.15,000 --> 0:05:46,000
air.

55
0:05:47.315,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Rhythmic flow,

56
0:05:49.408,000 --> 0:05:51,000
fluid and graceful,

57
0:05:51.494,000 --> 0:05:53,000
waves of serenity,

58
0:05:53.682,000 --> 0:05:55,000
smooth strings of purity,

59
0:05:55.832,000 --> 0:05:57,000
rains replenishing rapidly,

60
0:05:59.735,000 --> 0:06:,000
rivers of dreams,

61
0:06:01.012,000 --> 0:06:03,000
raging springs covering earth in abundance,

62
0:06:03.663,000 --> 0:06:05,000
universal solvent dissolving,

63
0:06:06.172,000 --> 0:06:1,000
drink, liquid, life and power:

64
0:06:12.384,000 --> 0:06:13,000
water.

65
0:06:14.1,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Born when the universe was formed,

66
0:06:15.928,000 --> 0:06:16,000
warmed mankind,

67
0:06:17.222,000 --> 0:06:18,000
gave him light,

68
0:06:18.438,000 --> 0:06:2,000
colored rays illuminate ember flickers

69
0:06:21.446,000 --> 0:06:23,000
incandescent, powerful and brilliant.

70
0:06:23.557,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Sacred son of air, father of fury,

71
0:06:25.938,000 --> 0:06:26,000
heat dancing vigorously

72
0:06:27.389,000 --> 0:06:28,000
between perfection and beauty.

73
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Unconfined agility,

74
0:06:30.841,000 --> 0:06:32,000
fast and fancy,

75
0:06:32.886,000 --> 0:06:34,000
sparks of ingenuity rise:

76
0:06:36.087,000 --> 0:06:37,000
fire.

77
0:06:37.939,000 --> 0:06:38,000

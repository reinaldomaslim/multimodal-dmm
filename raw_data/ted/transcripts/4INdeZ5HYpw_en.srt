1
0:00:12.623,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'd like you to ask yourself,

2
0:00:14.973,000 --> 0:00:17,000
what do you feel when you hear the words "organic chemistry?"

3
0:00:18.786,000 --> 0:00:19,000
What comes to mind?

4
0:00:20.763,000 --> 0:00:23,000
There is a course offered at nearly every university,

5
0:00:24.43,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and it's called Organic Chemistry,

6
0:00:26.343,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and it is a grueling, heavy introduction to the subject,

7
0:00:30.252,000 --> 0:00:32,000
a flood of content that overwhelms students,

8
0:00:33.25,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and you have to ace it if you want to become a doctor or a dentist

9
0:00:37.464,000 --> 0:00:38,000
or a veterinarian.

10
0:00:38.85,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And that is why so many students perceive this science like this ...

11
0:00:44.127,000 --> 0:00:45,000
as an obstacle in their path,

12
0:00:46.121,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and they fear it and they hate it

13
0:00:48.309,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and they call it a weed-out course.

14
0:00:50.476,000 --> 0:00:52,000
What a cruel thing for a subject to do to young people,

15
0:00:53.325,000 --> 0:00:54,000
weed them out.

16
0:00:55.538,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And this perception spread beyond college campuses long ago.

17
0:00:59.342,000 --> 0:01:02,000
There is a universal anxiety about these two words.

18
0:01:04.963,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I happen to love this science,

19
0:01:07.413,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and I think this position in which we have placed it

20
0:01:09.937,000 --> 0:01:1,000
is inexcusable.

21
0:01:11.702,000 --> 0:01:14,000
It's not good for science, and it's not good for society,

22
0:01:15.587,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and I don't think it has to be this way.

23
0:01:18.178,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And I don't mean that this class should be easier. It shouldn't.

24
0:01:23.819,000 --> 0:01:26,000
But your perception of these two words

25
0:01:28.884,000 --> 0:01:32,000
should not be defined by the experiences of premed students

26
0:01:33.297,000 --> 0:01:36,000
who frankly are going through a very anxious time of their lives.

27
0:01:37.72,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So I'm here today because I believe

28
0:01:40.199,000 --> 0:01:42,000
that a basic knowledge of organic chemistry is valuable,

29
0:01:42.856,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and I think that it can be made accessible to everybody,

30
0:01:47.492,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and I'd like to prove that to you today.

31
0:01:49.929,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Would you let me try?

32
0:01:51.334,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Audience: Yeah!

33
0:01:52.886,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Jakob Magolan: All right, let's go for it.

34
0:01:55.973,000 --> 0:01:56,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:57.251,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Here I have one of these overpriced EpiPens.

36
0:02:00.54,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Inside it is a drug called epinephrine.

37
0:02:03.25,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Epinephrine can restart the beat of my heart,

38
0:02:06.408,000 --> 0:02:08,000
or it could stop a life-threatening allergic reaction.

39
0:02:08.997,000 --> 0:02:11,000
An injection of this right here will do it.

40
0:02:13.076,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It would be like turning the ignition switch

41
0:02:15.195,000 --> 0:02:17,000
in my body's fight-or-flight machinery.

42
0:02:17.249,000 --> 0:02:2,000
My heart rate, my blood pressure would go up so blood could rush to my muscles.

43
0:02:21.09,000 --> 0:02:23,000
My pupils would dilate. I would feel a wave of strength.

44
0:02:24.05,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Epinephrine has been the difference between life and death for many people.

45
0:02:29.224,000 --> 0:02:32,000
This is like a little miracle that you can hold in your fingers.

46
0:02:33.459,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Here is the chemical structure of epinephrine.

47
0:02:37.753,000 --> 0:02:39,000
This is what organic chemistry looks like.

48
0:02:39.984,000 --> 0:02:41,000
It looks like lines and letters ...

49
0:02:43.362,000 --> 0:02:44,000
No meaning to most people.

50
0:02:45.74,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I'd like to show you what I see when I look at that picture.

51
0:02:49.645,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I see a physical object

52
0:02:53.071,000 --> 0:02:55,000
that has depth and rotating parts,

53
0:02:55.445,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and it's moving.

54
0:02:58.864,000 --> 0:03:,000
We call this a compound or a molecule,

55
0:03:00.992,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and it is 26 atoms that are stitched together by atomic bonds.

56
0:03:07.443,000 --> 0:03:11,000
The unique arrangement of these atoms gives epinephrine its identity,

57
0:03:11.935,000 --> 0:03:13,000
but nobody has ever actually seen one of these,

58
0:03:14.27,000 --> 0:03:15,000
because they're very small,

59
0:03:15.748,000 --> 0:03:18,000
so we're going to call this an artistic impression,

60
0:03:18.92,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and I want to explain to you how small this is.

61
0:03:22.618,000 --> 0:03:26,000
In here, I have less than half a milligram of it dissolved in water.

62
0:03:26.786,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It's the mass of a grain of sand.

63
0:03:28.383,000 --> 0:03:31,000
The number of epinephrine molecules in here is one quintillion.

64
0:03:33.528,000 --> 0:03:34,000
That's 18 zeroes.

65
0:03:35.011,000 --> 0:03:36,000
That number is hard to visualize.

66
0:03:37.336,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Seven billion of us on this planet?

67
0:03:40.877,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Maybe 400 billion stars in our galaxy?

68
0:03:45.656,000 --> 0:03:46,000
You're not even close.

69
0:03:46.831,000 --> 0:03:48,000
If you wanted to get into the right ballpark,

70
0:03:48.952,000 --> 0:03:5,000
you'd have to imagine every grain of sand

71
0:03:51.693,000 --> 0:03:54,000
on every beach, under all the oceans and lakes,

72
0:03:55.313,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and then shrink them all so they fit in here.

73
0:03:59.821,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Epinephrine is so small we will never see it,

74
0:04:02.695,000 --> 0:04:04,000
not through any microscope ever,

75
0:04:05.995,000 --> 0:04:06,000
but we know what it looks like,

76
0:04:07.568,000 --> 0:04:1,000
because it shows itself through some sophisticated machines

77
0:04:11.401,000 --> 0:04:13,000
with fancy names

78
0:04:13.557,000 --> 0:04:15,000
like "nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers."

79
0:04:17.398,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So visible or not, we know this molecule very well.

80
0:04:20.693,000 --> 0:04:22,000
We know it is made of four different types of atoms,

81
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
hydrogen, carbon, oxygen and nitrogen.

82
0:04:25.097,000 --> 0:04:27,000
These are the colors we typically use for them.

83
0:04:27.888,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Everything in our universe is made of little spheres

84
0:04:30.539,000 --> 0:04:31,000
that we call atoms.

85
0:04:31.739,000 --> 0:04:33,000
There's about a hundred of these basic ingredients,

86
0:04:34.165,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and they're all made from three smaller particles:

87
0:04:36.548,000 --> 0:04:37,000
protons, neutrons, electrons.

88
0:04:38.208,000 --> 0:04:4,000
We arrange these atoms into this familiar table.

89
0:04:42.755,000 --> 0:04:44,000
We give them each a name and a number.

90
0:04:45.002,000 --> 0:04:47,000
But life as we know it doesn't need all of these,

91
0:04:47.352,000 --> 0:04:49,000
just a smaller subset, just these.

92
0:04:50.671,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And there are four atoms in particular that stand apart from the rest

93
0:04:53.998,000 --> 0:04:55,000
as the main building blocks of life,

94
0:04:56.055,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and they are the same ones that are found in epinephrine:

95
0:04:59.445,000 --> 0:05:02,000
hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen.

96
0:05:04.512,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Now what I tell you next is the most important part.

97
0:05:08.443,000 --> 0:05:1,000
When these atoms connect to form molecules,

98
0:05:11.323,000 --> 0:05:12,000
they follow a set of rules.

99
0:05:13.076,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Hydrogen makes one bond,

100
0:05:15.362,000 --> 0:05:16,000
oxygen always makes two,

101
0:05:17.132,000 --> 0:05:18,000
nitrogen makes three

102
0:05:18.588,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and carbon makes four.

103
0:05:20.857,000 --> 0:05:21,000
That's it.

104
0:05:22.302,000 --> 0:05:23,000
HONC -- one, two, three, four.

105
0:05:25.962,000 --> 0:05:28,000
If you can count to four, and you can misspell the word "honk,"

106
0:05:29.702,000 --> 0:05:31,000
you're going to remember this for the rest of your lives.

107
0:05:32.394,000 --> 0:05:33,000
(Laughter)

108
0:05:34.07,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Now here I have four bowls with these ingredients.

109
0:05:36.517,000 --> 0:05:38,000
We can use these to build molecules.

110
0:05:40.828,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Let's start with epinephrine.

111
0:05:43.464,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Now, these bonds between atoms, they're made of electrons.

112
0:05:48.454,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Atoms use electrons like arms to reach out and hold their neighbors.

113
0:05:51.771,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Two electrons in each bond, like a handshake,

114
0:05:53.917,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and like a handshake, they are not permanent.

115
0:05:56.038,000 --> 0:05:58,000
They can let go of one atom and grab another.

116
0:05:58.205,000 --> 0:05:59,000
That's what we call a chemical reaction,

117
0:06:00.135,000 --> 0:06:02,000
when atoms exchange partners and make new molecules.

118
0:06:03.02,000 --> 0:06:06,000
The backbone of epinephrine is made mostly of carbon atoms,

119
0:06:06.629,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and that's common.

120
0:06:07.811,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Carbon is life's favorite structural building material,

121
0:06:10.518,000 --> 0:06:13,000
because it makes a good number of handshakes

122
0:06:13.715,000 --> 0:06:15,000
with just the right grip strength.

123
0:06:15.747,000 --> 0:06:18,000
That's why we define organic chemistry as the study of carbon molecules.

124
0:06:20.559,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Now, if we build the smallest molecules we can think of that follow our rules,

125
0:06:25.546,000 --> 0:06:27,000
they highlight our rules, and they have familiar names:

126
0:06:28.142,000 --> 0:06:31,000
water, ammonia and methane, H20 and NH3 and CH4.

127
0:06:33.739,000 --> 0:06:35,000
The words "hydrogen," "oxygen" and "nitrogen" --

128
0:06:36.224,000 --> 0:06:38,000
we use the same words

129
0:06:38.516,000 --> 0:06:4,000
to name these three molecules that have two atoms each.

130
0:06:41.191,000 --> 0:06:42,000
They still follow the rules,

131
0:06:42.556,000 --> 0:06:44,000
because they have one, two and three bonds between them.

132
0:06:45.248,000 --> 0:06:46,000
That's why oxygen gets called O2.

133
0:06:48.449,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I can show you combustion.

134
0:06:51.323,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Here's carbon dioxide, CO2.

135
0:06:53.768,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Above it, let's place water and oxygen, and beside it, some flammable fuels.

136
0:06:58.696,000 --> 0:07:,000
These fuels are made of just hydrogen and carbon.

137
0:07:01.022,000 --> 0:07:03,000
That's why we call them hydrocarbons. We're very creative.

138
0:07:03.762,000 --> 0:07:04,000
(Laughter)

139
0:07:05.242,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So when these crash into molecules of oxygen,

140
0:07:07.409,000 --> 0:07:1,000
as they do in your engine or in your barbecues,

141
0:07:12.091,000 --> 0:07:13,000
they release energy and they reassemble,

142
0:07:14.108,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and every carbon atom ends up at the center of a CO2 molecule,

143
0:07:17.124,000 --> 0:07:18,000
holding on to two oxygens,

144
0:07:18.39,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and all the hydrogens end up as parts of waters,

145
0:07:20.863,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and everybody follows the rules.

146
0:07:22.879,000 --> 0:07:23,000
They are not optional,

147
0:07:24.221,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and they're not optional for bigger molecules either,

148
0:07:26.723,000 --> 0:07:27,000
like these three.

149
0:07:29.347,000 --> 0:07:31,000
This is our favorite vitamin

150
0:07:31.546,000 --> 0:07:32,000
sitting next to our favorite drug,

151
0:07:33.22,000 --> 0:07:34,000
(Laughter)

152
0:07:34.49,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and morphine is one of the most important stories in medical history.

153
0:07:38.253,000 --> 0:07:4,000
It marks medicine's first real triumph over physical pain,

154
0:07:41.189,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and every molecule has a story,

155
0:07:43.217,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and they are all published.

156
0:07:44.825,000 --> 0:07:47,000
They're written by scientists, and they're read by other scientists,

157
0:07:48.315,000 --> 0:07:51,000
so we have handy representations to do this quickly on paper,

158
0:07:51.414,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and I need to teach you how to do that.

159
0:07:53.297,000 --> 0:07:55,000
So we lay epinephrine flat on a page,

160
0:07:56.096,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and then we replace all the spheres with simple letters,

161
0:07:58.8,000 --> 0:08:,000
and then the bonds that lie in the plane of the page,

162
0:08:01.319,000 --> 0:08:02,000
they just become regular lines,

163
0:08:03.152,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and the bonds that point forwards and backwards,

164
0:08:05.429,000 --> 0:08:06,000
they become little triangles,

165
0:08:06.851,000 --> 0:08:08,000
either solid or dashed to indicate depth.

166
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
We don't actually draw these carbons.

167
0:08:11.585,000 --> 0:08:13,000
We save time by just hiding them.

168
0:08:14.897,000 --> 0:08:17,000
They're represented by corners between the bonds,

169
0:08:18.057,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and we also hide every hydrogen that's bonded to a carbon.

170
0:08:22.583,000 --> 0:08:23,000
We know they're there

171
0:08:23.765,000 --> 0:08:25,000
whenever a carbon is showing us any fewer than four bonds.

172
0:08:27.853,000 --> 0:08:29,000
The last thing that's done is the bonds between OH and NH.

173
0:08:31.432,000 --> 0:08:33,000
We just get rid of those to make it cleaner,

174
0:08:33.544,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and that's all there is to it.

175
0:08:35.045,000 --> 0:08:37,000
This is the professional way to draw molecules.

176
0:08:37.649,000 --> 0:08:39,000
This is what you see on Wikipedia pages.

177
0:08:42.793,000 --> 0:08:45,000
It takes a little bit of practice, but I think everyone here could do it,

178
0:08:46.579,000 --> 0:08:48,000
but for today, this is epinephrine.

179
0:08:49.886,000 --> 0:08:51,000
This is also called adrenaline. They're one and the same.

180
0:08:52.838,000 --> 0:08:53,000
It's made by your adrenal glands.

181
0:08:54.474,000 --> 0:08:56,000
You have this molecule swimming through your body right now.

182
0:08:57.45,000 --> 0:08:58,000
It's a natural molecule.

183
0:08:59.164,000 --> 0:09:03,000
This EpiPen would just give you a quick quintillion more of them.

184
0:09:03.432,000 --> 0:09:04,000
(Laughter)

185
0:09:05.106,000 --> 0:09:08,000
We can extract epinephrine

186
0:09:08.321,000 --> 0:09:11,000
from the adrenal glands of sheep or cattle,

187
0:09:11.765,000 --> 0:09:13,000
but that's not where this stuff comes from.

188
0:09:14.123,000 --> 0:09:16,000
We make this epinephrine in a factory

189
0:09:17.015,000 --> 0:09:22,000
by stitching together smaller molecules that come mostly from petroleum.

190
0:09:23.322,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And this is 100 percent synthetic.

191
0:09:25.862,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And that word, "synthetic," makes some of us uncomfortable.

192
0:09:29.964,000 --> 0:09:32,000
It's not like the word "natural," which makes us feel safe.

193
0:09:33.283,000 --> 0:09:36,000
But these two molecules, they cannot be distinguished.

194
0:09:38.263,000 --> 0:09:41,000
We're not talking about two cars that are coming off an assembly line here.

195
0:09:42.183,000 --> 0:09:44,000
A car can have a scratch on it,

196
0:09:44.248,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and you can't scratch an atom.

197
0:09:46.127,000 --> 0:09:5,000
These two are identical in a surreal, almost mathematical sense.

198
0:09:50.699,000 --> 0:09:53,000
At this atomic scale, math practically touches reality.

199
0:09:54.128,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And a molecule of epinephrine ...

200
0:09:56.779,000 --> 0:09:57,000
it has no memory of its origin.

201
0:09:58.502,000 --> 0:09:59,000
It just is what it is,

202
0:09:59.931,000 --> 0:10:,000
and once you have it,

203
0:10:01.106,000 --> 0:10:05,000
the words "natural" and "synthetic," they don't matter,

204
0:10:06.284,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and nature synthesizes this molecule just like we do,

205
0:10:09.52,000 --> 0:10:11,000
except nature is much better at this than we are.

206
0:10:11.831,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Before there was life on earth,

207
0:10:14.233,000 --> 0:10:17,000
all the molecules were small, simple:

208
0:10:17.264,000 --> 0:10:18,000
carbon dioxide, water, nitrogen,

209
0:10:20.018,000 --> 0:10:21,000
just simple things.

210
0:10:21.192,000 --> 0:10:22,000
The emergence of life changed that.

211
0:10:23.164,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Life brought biosynthetic factories that are powered by sunlight,

212
0:10:26.424,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and inside these factories, small molecules crash into each other

213
0:10:29.963,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and become large ones: carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids,

214
0:10:33.295,000 --> 0:10:35,000
multitudes of spectacular creations.

215
0:10:37.613,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Nature is the original organic chemist,

216
0:10:40.932,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and her construction also fills our sky with the oxygen gas we breathe,

217
0:10:44.379,000 --> 0:10:45,000
this high-energy oxygen.

218
0:10:47.597,000 --> 0:10:5,000
All of these molecules are infused with the energy of the sun.

219
0:10:50.882,000 --> 0:10:51,000
They store it like batteries.

220
0:10:52.81,000 --> 0:10:54,000
So nature is made of chemicals.

221
0:10:56.251,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Maybe you guys can help me to reclaim this word, "chemical,"

222
0:10:59.212,000 --> 0:11:01,000
because it has been stolen from us.

223
0:11:01.735,000 --> 0:11:03,000
It doesn't mean toxic, and it doesn't mean harmful,

224
0:11:04.458,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and it doesn't mean man-made or unnatural.

225
0:11:07.117,000 --> 0:11:1,000
It just means "stuff," OK?

226
0:11:10.394,000 --> 0:11:11,000
(Laughter)

227
0:11:11.939,000 --> 0:11:15,000
You can't have chemical-free lump charcoal.

228
0:11:15.999,000 --> 0:11:16,000
That is ridiculous.

229
0:11:17.233,000 --> 0:11:18,000
(Laughter)

230
0:11:18.258,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And I'd like to do one more word.

231
0:11:20.932,000 --> 0:11:22,000
The word "natural" doesn't mean "safe,"

232
0:11:23.631,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and you all know that.

233
0:11:26.163,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Plenty of nature's chemicals are quite toxic,

234
0:11:30.67,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and others are delicious,

235
0:11:33.297,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and some are both ...

236
0:11:35.243,000 --> 0:11:36,000
(Laughter)

237
0:11:36.638,000 --> 0:11:37,000
toxic and delicious.

238
0:11:38.813,000 --> 0:11:4,000
The only way to tell whether something is harmful

239
0:11:41.615,000 --> 0:11:42,000
is to test it,

240
0:11:43.511,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and I don't mean you guys.

241
0:11:45.693,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Professional toxicologists: we have these people.

242
0:11:48.526,000 --> 0:11:49,000
They're well-trained,

243
0:11:50.064,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and you should trust them like I do.

244
0:11:52.893,000 --> 0:11:53,000
So nature's molecules are everywhere,

245
0:11:54.687,000 --> 0:11:55,000
including the ones that have decomposed

246
0:11:56.584,000 --> 0:11:58,000
into these black mixtures that we call petroleum.

247
0:11:58.918,000 --> 0:12:,000
We refine these molecules.

248
0:12:01.695,000 --> 0:12:02,000
There's nothing unnatural about them.

249
0:12:03.538,000 --> 0:12:04,000
We purify them.

250
0:12:06.228,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Now, our dependence on them for energy --

251
0:12:09.22,000 --> 0:12:13,000
that means that every one of those carbons gets converted into a molecule of CO2.

252
0:12:13.253,000 --> 0:12:15,000
That's a greenhouse gas that is messing up our climate.

253
0:12:16.221,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Maybe knowing this chemistry will make that reality easier to accept

254
0:12:19.936,000 --> 0:12:2,000
for some people, I don't know,

255
0:12:21.43,000 --> 0:12:23,000
but these molecules are not just fossil fuels.

256
0:12:24.523,000 --> 0:12:26,000
They're also the cheapest available raw materials

257
0:12:27.189,000 --> 0:12:29,000
for doing something that we call synthesis.

258
0:12:30.195,000 --> 0:12:32,000
We're using them like pieces of LEGO.

259
0:12:33.083,000 --> 0:12:37,000
We have learned how to connect them or break them apart with great control.

260
0:12:37.394,000 --> 0:12:38,000
I have done a lot of this myself,

261
0:12:39.024,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and I still think it's amazing it's even possible.

262
0:12:41.397,000 --> 0:12:44,000
What we do is kind of like assembling LEGO

263
0:12:44.723,000 --> 0:12:47,000
by dumping boxes of it into washing machines,

264
0:12:47.779,000 --> 0:12:48,000
but it works.

265
0:12:49.108,000 --> 0:12:53,000
We can make molecules that are exact copies of nature, like epinephrine,

266
0:12:53.345,000 --> 0:12:56,000
or we can make creations of our own from scratch, like these two.

267
0:12:57.361,000 --> 0:13:01,000
One of these eases the symptoms of multiple sclerosis;

268
0:13:01.655,000 --> 0:13:04,000
the other one cures a type of blood cancer that we call T-cell lymphoma.

269
0:13:05.466,000 --> 0:13:09,000
A molecule with the right size and shape, it's like a key in a lock,

270
0:13:09.722,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and when it fits, it interferes with the chemistry of a disease.

271
0:13:13.221,000 --> 0:13:14,000
That's how drugs work.

272
0:13:15.58,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Natural or synthetic,

273
0:13:17.224,000 --> 0:13:2,000
they're all just molecules that happen to fit snugly somewhere important.

274
0:13:20.708,000 --> 0:13:22,000
But nature is much better at making them than we are,

275
0:13:23.412,000 --> 0:13:25,000
so hers look more impressive than ours,

276
0:13:25.548,000 --> 0:13:26,000
like this one.

277
0:13:27.15,000 --> 0:13:28,000
This is called vancomycin.

278
0:13:29.119,000 --> 0:13:32,000
She gave this majestic beast two chlorine atoms

279
0:13:32.206,000 --> 0:13:34,000
to wear like a pair of earrings.

280
0:13:34.415,000 --> 0:13:39,000
We found vancomycin in a puddle of mud in a jungle in Borneo in 1953.

281
0:13:39.606,000 --> 0:13:4,000
It's made by a bacteria.

282
0:13:42.355,000 --> 0:13:44,000
We can't synthesize this cost-efficiently in a lab.

283
0:13:45.798,000 --> 0:13:49,000
It's too complicated for us, but we can harvest it from its natural source,

284
0:13:50.141,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and we do, because this is one of our most powerful antibiotics.

285
0:13:54.348,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And new molecules are reported in our literature every day.

286
0:13:57.327,000 --> 0:14:,000
We make them or we find them in every corner of this planet.

287
0:14:01.982,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And that's where drugs come from,

288
0:14:03.697,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and that's why your doctors have amazing powers ...

289
0:14:05.966,000 --> 0:14:06,000
(Laughter)

290
0:14:07.012,000 --> 0:14:09,000
to cure deadly infections and everything else.

291
0:14:09.242,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Being a physician today is like being a knight in shining armor.

292
0:14:13.948,000 --> 0:14:15,000
They fight battles with courage and composure,

293
0:14:16.873,000 --> 0:14:17,000
but also with good equipment.

294
0:14:18.517,000 --> 0:14:22,000
So let's not forget the role of the blacksmith in this picture,

295
0:14:22.559,000 --> 0:14:25,000
because without the blacksmith, things would look a little different ...

296
0:14:26.046,000 --> 0:14:28,000
(Laughter)

297
0:14:28.163,000 --> 0:14:3,000
But this science is bigger than medicine.

298
0:14:30.52,000 --> 0:14:36,000
It is oils and solvents and flavors, fabrics, all plastics,

299
0:14:36.763,000 --> 0:14:38,000
the cushions that you're sitting on right now --

300
0:14:39.057,000 --> 0:14:41,000
they're all manufactured, and they're mostly carbon,

301
0:14:41.541,000 --> 0:14:43,000
so that makes all of it organic chemistry.

302
0:14:43.599,000 --> 0:14:45,000
This is a rich science.

303
0:14:45.812,000 --> 0:14:46,000
I left out a lot today:

304
0:14:47.69,000 --> 0:14:5,000
phosphorus and sulfur and the other atoms,

305
0:14:51.812,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and why they all bond the way they do,

306
0:14:54.121,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and symmetry

307
0:14:55.4,000 --> 0:14:56,000
and non-bonding electrons,

308
0:14:57.245,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and atoms that are charged,

309
0:14:58.813,000 --> 0:15:01,000
and reactions and their mechanisms, and it goes on and on and on,

310
0:15:01.933,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and synthesis takes a long time to learn.

311
0:15:03.967,000 --> 0:15:05,000
But I didn't come here to teach you guys organic chemistry --

312
0:15:06.872,000 --> 0:15:07,000
I just wanted to show it to you,

313
0:15:08.738,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and I had a lot of help with that today from a young man named Weston Durland,

314
0:15:13.801,000 --> 0:15:14,000
and you've already seen him.

315
0:15:16.427,000 --> 0:15:18,000
He's an undergraduate student in chemistry,

316
0:15:18.602,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and he also happens to be pretty good with computer graphics.

317
0:15:21.904,000 --> 0:15:22,000
(Laughter)

318
0:15:23.665,000 --> 0:15:27,000
So Weston designed all the moving molecules

319
0:15:27.777,000 --> 0:15:28,000
that you saw today.

320
0:15:29.213,000 --> 0:15:32,000
He and I wanted to demonstrate through the use of graphics like these

321
0:15:32.477,000 --> 0:15:34,000
to help someone talk about this intricate science.

322
0:15:35.316,000 --> 0:15:37,000
But our main goal was just to show you

323
0:15:37.681,000 --> 0:15:39,000
that organic chemistry is not something to be afraid of.

324
0:15:41.418,000 --> 0:15:44,000
It is, at its core, a window

325
0:15:44.632,000 --> 0:15:47,000
through which the beauty of the natural world looks richer.

326
0:15:48.365,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Thank you.

327
0:15:49.54,000 --> 0:15:52,000
(Applause)

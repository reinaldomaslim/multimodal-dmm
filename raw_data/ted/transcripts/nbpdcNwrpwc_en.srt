1
0:00:13.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm a contemporary artist and I show in art galleries and museums.

2
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I show a number of photographs and films,

3
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
but I also make television programs, books and some advertising,

4
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
all with the same concept.

5
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And it's about our fixation with celebrity and celebrity culture,

6
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and the importance of the image:

7
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
celebrity is born of photography.

8
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I'm going to start with how I started with this concept seven years ago,

9
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
when Princess Diana died.

10
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
There was a sort of a standstill in Britain

11
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
the moment of her death,

12
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and people decided to mourn her death in a sort of mass way.

13
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I was fascinated by this phenomenon,

14
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
so I wondered:

15
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
could one erase the image of Diana, actually quite crudely and physically?

16
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So, I got a gun and started to shoot at the image of Diana,

17
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
but I couldn't erase this from my memory

18
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and certainly it was not being erased from the public psyche.

19
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Momentum was being built.

20
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
The press wrote about her death in rather, I felt, pornographic ways --

21
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
like, "Which bit of artery left which bit of body?"

22
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and "How did she die in the back of the car?" --

23
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and I was intrigued by this sort of mass voyeurism,

24
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
so I made these rather gory images.

25
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I then went on wondering whether I could actually replace her image,

26
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
so I got a look-alike of Diana

27
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and posed her in the right positions and angles

28
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and created something that was in, or existed in, the public imagination.

29
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So people were wondering: was she going to marry Dodi?

30
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Was she in love with him?

31
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Was she pregnant? Did she want his baby?

32
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Was she pregnant when she died?

33
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So I created this image of Diana, Dodi and their imaginary mixed-race child

34
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and this image came out, which caused a huge public outcry at the time.

35
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I then went on to make more comments on the media and press imagery,

36
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
so I started making reference to media imagery --

37
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
made it grainy, shot through doorways and so on and so forth --

38
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to titillate the public or the viewer further

39
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
in terms of trying to make the viewer more aware of their own voyeurism.

40
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So, this is an image of Diana looking at Camilla kissing her husband,

41
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and this was a sequence of images.

42
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And this gets shown in art galleries like this, as a sequence.

43
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And similarly with the Di-Dodian baby imagery --

44
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
this is another art gallery installation.

45
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I'm particularly interested in how you can't rely on your own perception.

46
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
This is Jane Smith and Jo Bloggs, for instance,

47
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
but you think it's Camilla and the Queen,

48
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and I'm fascinated how what you think is real isn't necessarily real.

49
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And the camera can lie,

50
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and it makes it very, very easy

51
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
with the mass bombardment of imagery to tell untruths.

52
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So, I continued to work on this project of how photography seduces us

53
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and is more interesting to look at than the actual real subject matter.

54
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And at the same time, it removes us from the real subject matter,

55
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and this acts as a sort of titillating thing.

56
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So, the photograph becomes this teaser and incites desire and voyeurism;

57
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
what you can't have, you want more.

58
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
In the photograph, the real subject doesn't exist

59
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
so it makes you want that person more.

60
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And that is the way, I think, that celebrity magazines work now:

61
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
the more pictures you see of these celebrities,

62
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
the more you feel you know them,

63
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
but you don't know them

64
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and you want to know them further.

65
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Of course, the Queen goes to her stud often to watch her horses ...

66
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
watch her horses. (Laughter).

67
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And then I was sort of making imagery.

68
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
In England there's an expression: "you can't imagine the Queen on the loo."

69
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So I'm trying to penetrate that.

70
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Well, here is the image.

71
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
All this imagery was creating a lot of fuss

72
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and I was cited as a disgusting artist. The press were writing about this,

73
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
giving full pages about how terrible this was.

74
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Which I found very interesting that it was going full cycle:

75
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I was making comments about the press

76
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and about how we know facts and information only by media --

77
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
because we don't know the real people;

78
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
very few of us know the real people --

79
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
but it was going back into the press

80
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and they were publicizing, effectively, my filthy work.

81
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So, these are broadsheets, tabloids, debates were being had all about this work,

82
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
films were being banned before people had actually had the look at the work,

83
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
politicians were getting involved --

84
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
all sorts of things -- great headlines.

85
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Then suddenly, it started to get on front pages.

86
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I was being asked and paid to do front covers.

87
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Suddenly I was becoming sort of acceptable,

88
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
which I found also fascinating.

89
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
How one moment -- it was disgusting --

90
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
journalists would lie to me to get a story or a photograph of me,

91
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
saying my work was wonderful,

92
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and the next minute there were terrible headlines about me.

93
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
But then this changed suddenly.

94
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I then started to work for magazines and newspapers.

95
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
This was, for example, an image that went into Tatler.

96
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
This was another newspaper image.

97
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
It was an April fool actually, and to this day some people think it's real.

98
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I was sitting next to someone at dinner the other day,

99
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and they were saying there's this great image of the Queen

100
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
sitting outside William Hill.

101
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
They thought it was real.

102
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I was exploring, at the time, the hyperbole of icons --

103
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and Diana and Marilyn -- and the importance of celebrity in our lives.

104
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
How they wheedle their way into the collective psyche

105
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
without us even knowing,

106
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and how that should happen.

107
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I explored with actually dressing up as the celebrities myself.

108
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
There's me as Diana --

109
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I look like the mass murderer Myra Hindley, I think, in this one. (Laughter).

110
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And me as the Queen.

111
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I then continued on to make a whole body of work about Marilyn --

112
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
the biggest icon of all --

113
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and trying to titillate by shooting through doorways and shutters and so on and so forth,

114
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and only showing certain angles to create a reality that, obviously,

115
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
is completely constructed.

116
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
This is the look-alike, so the crafting elements of this is completely enormous.

117
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
She looks nothing like Marilyn,

118
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
but by the time we've made her up and put wigs and makeup on,

119
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
she looks exactly like Marilyn,

120
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
to the extent that her husband couldn't recognize her --

121
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
or recognize this look-alike -- in these photographs,

122
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
which I find quite interesting.

123
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So, all this work is getting shown in art galleries.

124
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Then I made a book.

125
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I was also making a TV series for the BBC at the time.

126
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Stills from the TV series went into this book.

127
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
But there was a real legal problem because it looks real,

128
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
but how do you get over that?

129
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Because obviously it's making a comment about our culture right now:

130
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that we can't tell what's real.

131
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
How do we know when we're looking at something whether it's real or not?

132
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So, from my point of view, it's important to publish it,

133
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
but at the same time it does cause a confusion --

134
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
intentional on my behalf,

135
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
but problematic for any outlet that I'm working with.

136
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
So a big disclaimer is put on everything that I do,

137
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and I made narratives about all the European or Brit celebrities

138
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and comments about our public figures.

139
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
You know, what does Tony Blair get up to in private with his fashion guru?

140
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And also dealing with the perceptions that are put about

141
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, the links that were put about pre-Iraq war.

142
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And what is going to happen to the monarchy?

143
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Because obviously the British public,

144
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I think, would prefer William to Charles on the throne.

145
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And it's that wish, or that desire, that I suppose I'm dealing with in my work.

146
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I'm not really interested in the celebrity themselves.

147
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
I'm interested in the perception of the celebrity.

148
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And with some look-alikes, they are so good

149
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
you don't know whether they're real or not.

150
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
I did an advertising campaign for Schweppes, which is Coca-Cola,

151
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and so that was very interesting in terms of the legalities.

152
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
It's highly commercial.

153
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
But it was a difficulty for me -- because this is my artwork;

154
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
should I do advertising? -- at the time.

155
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
So I made sure the work was not compromised in any way

156
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and that the integrity of the work remained the same.

157
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
But the meanings changed in the sense that with the logo on,

158
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
you're closing all the lines of interpretation down to selling a product

159
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and that's all you're doing.

160
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
When you take the logo off, you're opening up the interpretations

161
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and making the work inconclusive,

162
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
opposed to conclusive when you are advertising.

163
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
This image is quite interesting, actually,

164
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
because I think we made it three years ago.

165
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And it's Camilla in her wedding dress, which, again,

166
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
nearly got re-used now, recently prior to her wedding.

167
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Tony Blair and Cherie. And again, the legalities -- we had to be very careful.

168
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
It's obviously a very big commercial company, and so this little,

169
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
"Shh -- it's not really them,"

170
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
was put on the side of the imagery.

171
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And Margaret Thatcher visiting Jeffery Archer in jail.

172
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
I then was asked by Selfridges to do a series of windows for them,

173
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
so I built a sauna bath in one of their windows and created little scenes --

174
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
live scenes with look-alikes inside the windows,

175
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and the windows were all steamed up.

176
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
So, it's Tony Blair reading and practicing his speech;

177
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
I've got them doing yoga inside there with Carole Caplin;

178
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Sven making out with Ulrika Jonsson, who he was having an affair with at that time.

179
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
This was a huge success for them

180
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
because the imagery got shown in the press the day after

181
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
in every single newspaper, broadsheets and tabloids.

182
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
It was a bit of a road stopper, which was problematic

183
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
because the police kept on trying to clear away the crowds,

184
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
but huge fun -- it was great for me to do a performance.

185
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Also, people were taking photographs of this,

186
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
so it was being texted around the world extremely quickly, all this imagery.

187
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And the press were interviewing, and I was signing my book. (Laughter).

188
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Further imagery. I'm making a new book now with Taschen

189
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
that I'm working on really for a sort of global market --

190
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
my previous book was only for the U.K. market --

191
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
that I suppose it could be called humorous.

192
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
I suppose I come from a sort of non-humorous background

193
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
with serious intent,

194
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and then suddenly my work is funny.

195
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And I think it doesn't really matter that my work is considered humorous, in a way;

196
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
I think it's a way in for me to deal with the importance of imagery

197
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and how we read all our information through imagery.

198
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
It's an extremely fast way of getting information.

199
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
It's extremely difficult if it's constructed correctly,

200
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and there are techniques of constructing iconic imagery.

201
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
This image, for example, is sort of spot-on

202
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
because it exactly sums up what Elton may be doing in private,

203
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and also what might be happening with Saddam Hussein, and George Bush

204
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
reading the Koran upside-down.

205
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
For example, George Bush target practice --

206
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
shooting at Bin Laden and Michael Moore.

207
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And then you change the photograph he's shooting at,

208
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and it suddenly becomes rather grim and maybe less accessible. (Laughter).

209
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Tony Blair being used as a mounting block,

210
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and Rumsfeld and Bush laughing with some Abu Ghraib photos behind,

211
0:13:51.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and the seriousness, or the intellect, of Bush.

212
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
And also, commenting on the behind the scenes --

213
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
well, as we know now -- what goes on in prisons.

214
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And in fact, George Bush and Tony Blair

215
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
are having great fun during all of this.

216
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And really commenting, you know,

217
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
based on the perception we have of the celebrities.

218
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
What Jack Nicholson might be up to in his celebrity life,

219
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and the fact that he tried to ... he had a bit of road rage

220
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and golf-clubbed a driver the other day.

221
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
I mean, it's extremely difficult to find these look-alikes,

222
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
so I'm constantly going up to people in the street

223
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:42,000
and trying to ask people to come

224
0:14:42.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and be in one of my photographs or films.

225
0:14:45.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
And sometimes asking the real celebrity,

226
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:5,000
mistaking them for someone who just looks like the real person,

227
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
which is highly embarrassing. (Laughter).

228
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
I've also been working with The Guardian on a topical basis --

229
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
a page a week in their newspaper --

230
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
which has been very interesting, working topically.

231
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
So, Jamie Oliver and school dinners;

232
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Bush and Blair having difficulty getting alongside Muslim culture;

233
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:11,000
the whole of the hunting issue,

234
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
and the royal family refusing to stop hunting;

235
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
and the tsunami issues; and obviously Harry;

236
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Blair's views on Gordon Brown, which I find very interesting;

237
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Condi and Bush.

238
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
This image I've decided to show having a reservation about it.

239
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
I made it a year ago. And just how meanings change,

240
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and there were a terrible thing that has happened,

241
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
but the fear is lurking around in our minds prior to that.

242
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:5,000
That's why this image was made one year ago,

243
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
and what it means today.

244
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
So, I'll leave you with these clips to have a look. (Music)

245
0:17:30.16,000 --> 0:17:31,000
Chris Anderson: Thank you.

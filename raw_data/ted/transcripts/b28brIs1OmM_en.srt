1
0:00:12.88,000 --> 0:00:13,000
"Mom, who are these people?"

2
0:00:15.48,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It was an innocent question from my young daughter Alia

3
0:00:18.12,000 --> 0:00:2,000
around the time when she was three.

4
0:00:20.28,000 --> 0:00:22,000
We were walking along with my husband

5
0:00:22.4,000 --> 0:00:24,000
in one of Abu Dhabi's big fancy malls.

6
0:00:25.2,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Alia was peering at a huge poster standing tall in the middle of the mall.

7
0:00:29.52,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It featured the three rulers of the United Arab Emirates.

8
0:00:33.76,000 --> 0:00:34,000
As she tucked in my side,

9
0:00:35.24,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I bent down and explained that these were the rulers of the UAE

10
0:00:38.48,000 --> 0:00:4,000
who had worked hard to develop their nation

11
0:00:40.76,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and preserve its unity.

12
0:00:43.04,000 --> 0:00:46,000
She asked, "Mom, why is it that here where we live,

13
0:00:46.92,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and back in Lebanon, where grandma and grandpa live,

14
0:00:49.6,000 --> 0:00:52,000
we never see the pictures of powerful women on the walls?

15
0:00:52.76,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Is it because women are not important?"

16
0:00:56.04,000 --> 0:00:59,000
This is probably the hardest question I've had to answer in my years as a parent

17
0:00:59.88,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and in my 16-plus years of professional life, for that matter.

18
0:01:04.12,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I had grown up in my hometown in Lebanon,

19
0:01:07.12,000 --> 0:01:1,000
the younger of two daughters to a very hard-working pilot

20
0:01:10.6,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and director of operations for the Lebanese Airlines

21
0:01:14.24,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and a super-supportive stay-at-home mom and grandma.

22
0:01:17.96,000 --> 0:01:21,000
My father had encouraged my sister and I to pursue our education

23
0:01:22.08,000 --> 0:01:25,000
even though our culture emphasized at the time

24
0:01:25.4,000 --> 0:01:29,000
that it was sons and not daughters who should be professionally motivated.

25
0:01:30.84,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I was one of very few girls of my generation

26
0:01:33.04,000 --> 0:01:35,000
who left home at 18 to study abroad.

27
0:01:36.48,000 --> 0:01:37,000
My father didn't have a son,

28
0:01:38.32,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and so I, in a sense, became his.

29
0:01:42.88,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Fast-forward a couple of decades, and I hope I didn't do too badly

30
0:01:46.6,000 --> 0:01:48,000
in making my father proud of his would-be son.

31
0:01:50.68,000 --> 0:01:53,000
As I got my Bachelor's and PhD in electrical engineering,

32
0:01:53.84,000 --> 0:01:55,000
did R and D in the UK, then consulting in the Middle East,

33
0:01:57.36,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I have always been in male-dominated environments.

34
0:02:00.72,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Truth be told, I have never found a role model I could truly identify with.

35
0:02:06.24,000 --> 0:02:08,000
My mother's generation wasn't into professional leadership.

36
0:02:09.88,000 --> 0:02:11,000
There were some encouraging men along the way,

37
0:02:12.08,000 --> 0:02:15,000
but none knew the demands and pressures I was facing,

38
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
pressures that got particularly acute when I had my own two beautiful children.

39
0:02:21.759,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And although Western women love to give us poor, oppressed Arab women advice,

40
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
they live different lives with different constraints.

41
0:02:31.12,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So Arab women of my generation have had to become our own role models.

42
0:02:35.24,000 --> 0:02:37,000
We have had to juggle more than Arab men,

43
0:02:37.52,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and we have had to face more cultural rigidity than Western women.

44
0:02:41.72,000 --> 0:02:45,000
As a result, I would like to think that we poor, oppressed women

45
0:02:45.84,000 --> 0:02:48,000
actually have some useful, certainly hard-earned lessons to share,

46
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:52,000
lessons that might turn out useful

47
0:02:52.04,000 --> 0:02:54,000
for anyone wishing to thrive in the modern world.

48
0:02:55.44,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Here are three of mine.

49
0:02:56.76,000 --> 0:02:57,000
["Convert their sh*t into your fuel."]

50
0:02:58.64,000 --> 0:02:59,000
(Laughter)

51
0:02:59.88,000 --> 0:03:,000
(Applause)

52
0:03:06.28,000 --> 0:03:1,000
There is this word that everybody is touting as the key to success:

53
0:03:10.68,000 --> 0:03:11,000
resilience.

54
0:03:12.52,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Well, what exactly is resilience, and how do you develop it?

55
0:03:16.64,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I believe resilience is simply the ability to transform shit into fuel.

56
0:03:23.64,000 --> 0:03:25,000
In my previous job, well before my current firm,

57
0:03:26.48,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I was working with a man we will call John.

58
0:03:29.4,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I had teamed up with John and was working hard,

59
0:03:31.84,000 --> 0:03:32,000
hoping he would notice how great I was

60
0:03:33.84,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and that he would come to support my case to make partner at the firm.

61
0:03:38.04,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I was, in addition to delivering on my consulting projects,

62
0:03:41.24,000 --> 0:03:44,000
writing passionately on the topic of women economic empowerment.

63
0:03:45.88,000 --> 0:03:49,000
One day, I got to present my research to a roomful of MBA students.

64
0:03:50.56,000 --> 0:03:51,000
John was part of the audience

65
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
listening for the first time to the details of my study.

66
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:58,000
As I proceeded with my presentation,

67
0:03:58.32,000 --> 0:04:,000
I could see John in the corner of my eye.

68
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:03,000
He had turned a dark shade of pink

69
0:04:03.56,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and had slid under his chair in apparent shame.

70
0:04:07.84,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I finished my presentation to an applauding audience

71
0:04:10.32,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and we rushed out and jumped into the car.

72
0:04:13.48,000 --> 0:04:14,000
There he exploded.

73
0:04:16.04,000 --> 0:04:18,000
"What you did up there was unacceptable!

74
0:04:18.24,000 --> 0:04:2,000
You are a consultant, not an activist!"

75
0:04:21.6,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I said, "John, I don't understand.

76
0:04:24.08,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I presented a couple of gender parity indices,

77
0:04:27.76,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and some conclusions about the Arab world.

78
0:04:29.839,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Yes, we do happen to be today at the bottom of the index,

79
0:04:32.839,000 --> 0:04:35,000
but what is it that I said or presented that was not factual?"

80
0:04:37.04,000 --> 0:04:41,000
To which he replied, "The whole premise of your study is wrong.

81
0:04:41.12,000 --> 0:04:44,000
What you are doing is dangerous and will break the social fabric of our society."

82
0:04:45.72,000 --> 0:04:47,000
He paused, then added,

83
0:04:48.12,000 --> 0:04:51,000
"When women have children, their place is in the home."

84
0:04:53.36,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Time stood still for a long while,

85
0:04:55.64,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and all I could think and repeat in the chaos of my brain was:

86
0:04:59.36,000 --> 0:05:01,000
"You can forget about that partnership, Leila.

87
0:05:01.56,000 --> 0:05:02,000
It's just never going to happen."

88
0:05:04.68,000 --> 0:05:07,000
It took me a couple of days to fully absorb this incident and its implications,

89
0:05:08.6,000 --> 0:05:1,000
but once I did, I reached three conclusions.

90
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
One, that these were his issues,

91
0:05:14.72,000 --> 0:05:15,000
his complexes.

92
0:05:16.24,000 --> 0:05:18,000
There may be many like him in our society,

93
0:05:18.32,000 --> 0:05:2,000
but I would never let their issues become mine.

94
0:05:21.4,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Two, that I needed another sponsor, and fast.

95
0:05:24.36,000 --> 0:05:25,000
(Laughter)

96
0:05:25.6,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I got one, by the way, and boy, was he great.

97
0:05:27.84,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And three, that I would get to show John what women with children can do.

98
0:05:32.28,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I apply this lesson equally well to my personal life.

99
0:05:35.72,000 --> 0:05:36,000
As I have progressed in my career,

100
0:05:37.52,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I have received many words of encouragement,

101
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:44,000
but I have also often been met by women, men and couples

102
0:05:44.32,000 --> 0:05:46,000
who have clearly had an issue with my husband and I

103
0:05:47.08,000 --> 0:05:49,000
having chosen the path of a dual-career couple.

104
0:05:50.6,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So you get this well-meaning couple

105
0:05:52.72,000 --> 0:05:54,000
who tells you straight out at a family gathering

106
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:56,000
or at a friends gathering,

107
0:05:56.28,000 --> 0:05:58,000
that, come on, you must know you're not a great mom,

108
0:05:58.733,000 --> 0:06:,000
given how much you're investing in your career, right?

109
0:06:02.72,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I would lie if I said these words didn't hurt.

110
0:06:05.44,000 --> 0:06:07,000
My children are the most precious thing to me,

111
0:06:07.92,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and the thought that I could be failing them in any way is intolerable.

112
0:06:12.48,000 --> 0:06:13,000
But just like I did with John,

113
0:06:14.04,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I quickly reminded myself that these were their issues,

114
0:06:17.68,000 --> 0:06:18,000
their complexes.

115
0:06:19.52,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So instead of replying,

116
0:06:20.84,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I gave back one of my largest smiles

117
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
as I saw, in flashing light,

118
0:06:25.04,000 --> 0:06:27,000
the following sign in my mind's eye.

119
0:06:27.2,000 --> 0:06:29,000
[Be happy, it drives people crazy.]

120
0:06:29.28,000 --> 0:06:31,000
(Applause)

121
0:06:34.76,000 --> 0:06:37,000
You see, as a young woman in these situations, you have two options.

122
0:06:38.12,000 --> 0:06:4,000
You can either decide to internalize these negative messages

123
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that are being thrown at you,

124
0:06:42.64,000 --> 0:06:43,000
to let them make you feel like a failure,

125
0:06:44.64,000 --> 0:06:46,000
like success is way too hard to ever achieve,

126
0:06:47.24,000 --> 0:06:5,000
or you can choose to see that others' negativity is their own issue,

127
0:06:50.68,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and instead transform it into your own personal fuel.

128
0:06:54.88,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I have learned to always go for option two,

129
0:06:58.08,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and I have found that it has taken me from strength to strength.

130
0:07:01.8,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And it's true what they say:

131
0:07:03.28,000 --> 0:07:05,000
success is the best revenge.

132
0:07:06.96,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Some women in the Middle East

133
0:07:08.4,000 --> 0:07:11,000
are lucky enough to be married to someone supportive of their career.

134
0:07:11.84,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Correction: I should say "smart enough,"

135
0:07:14.32,000 --> 0:07:16,000
because who you marry is your own choice,

136
0:07:16.72,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and you'd better marry someone supportive if you plan to have a long career.

137
0:07:21.24,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Still today, the Arab man is not an equal contributor in the home.

138
0:07:25.56,000 --> 0:07:27,000
It's simply not expected by our society,

139
0:07:27.8,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and even frowned upon as not very manly.

140
0:07:31.36,000 --> 0:07:33,000
As for the Arab woman, our society still assumes

141
0:07:34.08,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that her primary source of happiness should be the happiness and prosperity

142
0:07:37.84,000 --> 0:07:38,000
of her children and husband.

143
0:07:39.8,000 --> 0:07:41,000
She mostly exists for her family.

144
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Things are changing, but it will take time.

145
0:07:45.76,000 --> 0:07:47,000
For now, it means that the professional Arab woman

146
0:07:48.28,000 --> 0:07:51,000
has to somehow maintain the perfect home,

147
0:07:51.64,000 --> 0:07:54,000
make sure that her children's every need is being taken care of

148
0:07:54.76,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and manage her demanding career.

149
0:07:57.76,000 --> 0:08:,000
To achieve this, I have found the hard way

150
0:08:01.12,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that you need to apply your hard-earned professional skills to your personal life.

151
0:08:05.92,000 --> 0:08:06,000
You need to work your life.

152
0:08:08,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Here is how I do this in my personal life.

153
0:08:12.998,000 --> 0:08:13,000
One thing to know about the Middle East

154
0:08:14.88,000 --> 0:08:17,000
is that nearly every family has access to affordable domestic help.

155
0:08:19.32,000 --> 0:08:22,000
The challenge therefore becomes how to recruit effectively.

156
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Just like I would in my business life, I have based the selection

157
0:08:26.48,000 --> 0:08:29,000
of who would support me with my children while I'm at work

158
0:08:29.56,000 --> 0:08:3,000
on a strong referral.

159
0:08:31.28,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Cristina had worked for four years with my sister

160
0:08:34.24,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and the quality of her work was well-established.

161
0:08:37.88,000 --> 0:08:39,000
She is now an integral member of our family,

162
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
having been with us since Alia was six months old.

163
0:08:43.4,000 --> 0:08:46,000
She makes sure that the house is running smoothly while I'm at work,

164
0:08:46.919,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and I make sure to empower her

165
0:08:49.159,000 --> 0:08:52,000
in the most optimal conditions for her and my children,

166
0:08:52.36,000 --> 0:08:54,000
just like I would my best talent at work.

167
0:08:55.559,000 --> 0:08:58,000
This lesson applies whatever your childcare situation,

168
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
whether an au pair, nursery,

169
0:09:01.6,000 --> 0:09:03,000
part-time nanny that you share with someone else.

170
0:09:03.96,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Choose very carefully, and empower.

171
0:09:08.04,000 --> 0:09:09,000
If you look at my calendar,

172
0:09:09.4,000 --> 0:09:1,000
you will see every working day

173
0:09:11.4,000 --> 0:09:14,000
one and a half hours from 7pm to 8:30pm UAE time

174
0:09:15.12,000 --> 0:09:16,000
blocked and called "family time."

175
0:09:17.8,000 --> 0:09:18,000
This is sacred time.

176
0:09:19.36,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I have done this ever since Alia was a baby.

177
0:09:23.04,000 --> 0:09:25,000
I do everything in my power to protect this time

178
0:09:25.48,000 --> 0:09:28,000
so that I can be home by then to spend quality time with my children,

179
0:09:28.92,000 --> 0:09:29,000
asking them about their day,

180
0:09:31.36,000 --> 0:09:33,000
checking up on homework, reading them a bedtime story

181
0:09:34.28,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and giving them lots of kisses and cuddles.

182
0:09:36.88,000 --> 0:09:38,000
If I'm traveling, in whatever the time zone,

183
0:09:39.4,000 --> 0:09:42,000
I use Skype to connect with my children even if I am miles away.

184
0:09:44.2,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Our son Burhan is five years old,

185
0:09:46.28,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and he's learning to read and do basic maths.

186
0:09:49.92,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Here's another confession:

187
0:09:51.52,000 --> 0:09:53,000
I have found that our daughter is actually more successful

188
0:09:54.28,000 --> 0:09:55,000
at teaching him these skills than I am.

189
0:09:56.2,000 --> 0:09:57,000
(Laughter)

190
0:09:58.8,000 --> 0:10:02,000
It started as a game, but Alia loves playing teacher to her little brother,

191
0:10:02.88,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and I have found that these sessions actually improve Burhan's literacy,

192
0:10:08.08,000 --> 0:10:1,000
increase Alia's sense of responsibility,

193
0:10:10.48,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and strengthen the bonding between them,

194
0:10:12.48,000 --> 0:10:13,000
a win-win all around.

195
0:10:15.52,000 --> 0:10:17,000
The successful Arab women I know

196
0:10:17.76,000 --> 0:10:2,000
have each found their unique approach to working their life

197
0:10:20.92,000 --> 0:10:21,000
as they continue to shoulder

198
0:10:22.32,000 --> 0:10:24,000
the lion's share of responsibility in the home.

199
0:10:25.04,000 --> 0:10:27,000
But this is not just about surviving in your dual role

200
0:10:27.68,000 --> 0:10:28,000
as a career woman and mother.

201
0:10:29.4,000 --> 0:10:31,000
This is also about being in the present.

202
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
When I am with my children,

203
0:10:34.88,000 --> 0:10:36,000
I try to leave work out of our lives.

204
0:10:37.32,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Instead of worrying about how many minutes I can spend with them every day,

205
0:10:41.36,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I focus on turning these minutes into memorable moments,

206
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
moments where I'm seeing my kids,

207
0:10:47.4,000 --> 0:10:48,000
hearing them, connecting with them.

208
0:10:49.24,000 --> 0:10:5,000
["Join forces, don't compete."]

209
0:10:51.04,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Arab women of my generation have not been very visible

210
0:10:53.84,000 --> 0:10:55,000
in the public eye as they grew up.

211
0:10:55.96,000 --> 0:10:56,000
This explains, I think, to some extent,

212
0:10:57.88,000 --> 0:10:59,000
why you find so few women in politics in the Arab world.

213
0:11:01.32,000 --> 0:11:02,000
The upside of this, however,

214
0:11:02.84,000 --> 0:11:04,000
is that we have spent a lot of time

215
0:11:04.96,000 --> 0:11:06,000
developing a social skill behind the scenes,

216
0:11:09.04,000 --> 0:11:1,000
in coffee shops, in living rooms,

217
0:11:10.84,000 --> 0:11:11,000
on the phone,

218
0:11:12.08,000 --> 0:11:14,000
a social skill that is very important to success:

219
0:11:14.88,000 --> 0:11:15,000
networking.

220
0:11:16.56,000 --> 0:11:17,000
I would say the average Arab woman

221
0:11:18.24,000 --> 0:11:2,000
has a large network of friends and acquaintances.

222
0:11:20.8,000 --> 0:11:22,000
The majority of those are also women.

223
0:11:24.4,000 --> 0:11:27,000
In the West, it seems like ambitious women often compare themselves to other women

224
0:11:28.4,000 --> 0:11:31,000
hoping to be noticed as the most successful woman in the room.

225
0:11:32.36,000 --> 0:11:34,000
This leads to the much-spoken-about competitive behavior

226
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
between professional women.

227
0:11:37.56,000 --> 0:11:39,000
If there's only room for one woman at the top,

228
0:11:39.76,000 --> 0:11:41,000
then you can't make room for others, much less lift them up.

229
0:11:43.76,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Arab women, generally speaking,

230
0:11:45.28,000 --> 0:11:47,000
have not fallen for this psychological trap.

231
0:11:48.28,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Faced with a patriarchal society,

232
0:11:50.24,000 --> 0:11:52,000
they have found that by helping each other out,

233
0:11:52.6,000 --> 0:11:53,000
all benefit.

234
0:11:55.12,000 --> 0:11:58,000
In my previous job, I was the most senior woman in the Middle East,

235
0:11:58.32,000 --> 0:12:01,000
so one could think that investing in my network of female colleagues

236
0:12:02.2,000 --> 0:12:03,000
couldn't bring many benefits

237
0:12:03.8,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and that I should instead invest my time

238
0:12:06.08,000 --> 0:12:08,000
developing my relationships with male seniors and peers.

239
0:12:09.76,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Yet two of my biggest breaks came through the support of other women.

240
0:12:14.2,000 --> 0:12:16,000
It was the head of marketing who initially suggested

241
0:12:16.68,000 --> 0:12:19,000
I be considered as a young global leader to the World Economic Forum.

242
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:22,000
She was familiar with my media engagements and my publications,

243
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and when she was asked to voice her opinion,

244
0:12:25.12,000 --> 0:12:26,000
she highlighted my name.

245
0:12:27.28,000 --> 0:12:29,000
It was a young consultant, a Saudi lady and friend,

246
0:12:29.96,000 --> 0:12:31,000
who helped me sell my first project in Saudi Arabia,

247
0:12:32.72,000 --> 0:12:35,000
a market I was finding hard to gain traction in as a woman.

248
0:12:36.84,000 --> 0:12:37,000
She introduced me to a client,

249
0:12:38.36,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and that introduction led to the first of very many projects for me in Saudi.

250
0:12:42.52,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Today, I have two senior women on my team,

251
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and I see making them successful as key to my own success.

252
0:12:50.32,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Women continue to advance in the world,

253
0:12:52.32,000 --> 0:12:54,000
not fast enough, but we're moving.

254
0:12:54.72,000 --> 0:12:58,000
The Arab world, too, is making progress, despite many recent setbacks.

255
0:12:58.84,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Just this year, the UAE appointed five new female ministers to its cabinet,

256
0:13:03.48,000 --> 0:13:05,000
for a total of eight female ministers.

257
0:13:06.36,000 --> 0:13:08,000
That's nearly 28 percent of the cabinet,

258
0:13:09.08,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and more than many developed countries can claim.

259
0:13:11.92,000 --> 0:13:13,000
This is today my daughter Alia's favorite picture.

260
0:13:15.36,000 --> 0:13:17,000
This is the result, no doubt, of great leadership,

261
0:13:17.88,000 --> 0:13:19,000
but it is also the result of strong Arab women

262
0:13:20.52,000 --> 0:13:22,000
not giving up and continuously pushing the boundaries.

263
0:13:23.52,000 --> 0:13:27,000
It is the result of Arab women deciding every day like me

264
0:13:27.68,000 --> 0:13:28,000
to convert shit into fuel,

265
0:13:29.48,000 --> 0:13:31,000
to work their life to keep work out of their life,

266
0:13:32.04,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and to join forces and not compete.

267
0:13:34.96,000 --> 0:13:35,000
As I look to the future,

268
0:13:36.4,000 --> 0:13:38,000
my hopes for my daughter when she stands on this stage

269
0:13:38.96,000 --> 0:13:39,000
some 20, 30 years from now

270
0:13:40.8,000 --> 0:13:43,000
are that she be as proud to call herself her mother's daughter

271
0:13:43.92,000 --> 0:13:44,000
as her father's daughter.

272
0:13:46.04,000 --> 0:13:47,000
My hopes for my son

273
0:13:47.52,000 --> 0:13:5,000
are that by then, the expression "her mother's son" or "mama's boy"

274
0:13:51.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
would have taken on a completely different meaning.

275
0:13:54.12,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Thank you.

276
0:13:55.36,000 --> 0:14:,000
(Applause)

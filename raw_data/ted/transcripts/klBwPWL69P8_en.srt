2
0:00:12.539,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I know this is going to sound strange,

3
0:00:15.382,000 --> 0:00:19,000
but I think robots can inspire us to be better humans.

4
0:00:21.245,000 --> 0:00:24,000
See, I grew up in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania,

5
0:00:24.363,000 --> 0:00:25,000
the home of Bethlehem Steel.

6
0:00:26.991,000 --> 0:00:28,000
My father was an engineer,

7
0:00:29.127,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and when I was growing up, he would teach me how things worked.

8
0:00:33.47,000 --> 0:00:35,000
We would build projects together,

9
0:00:35.588,000 --> 0:00:37,000
like model rockets and slot cars.

10
0:00:38.732,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Here's the go-kart that we built together.

11
0:00:42.208,000 --> 0:00:43,000
That's me behind the wheel,

12
0:00:43.976,000 --> 0:00:45,000
with my sister and my best friend at the time.

13
0:00:47.875,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And one day,

14
0:00:49.825,000 --> 0:00:52,000
he came home, when I was about 10 years old,

15
0:00:52.932,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and at the dinner table, he announced

16
0:00:55.582,000 --> 0:00:58,000
that for our next project, we were going to build ...

17
0:00:59.318,000 --> 0:01:,000
a robot.

18
0:01:01.604,000 --> 0:01:02,000
A robot.

19
0:01:03.12,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Now, I was thrilled about this,

20
0:01:05.207,000 --> 0:01:08,000
because at school, there was a bully named Kevin,

21
0:01:09.033,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and he was picking on me,

22
0:01:10.946,000 --> 0:01:12,000
because I was the only Jewish kid in class.

23
0:01:13.91,000 --> 0:01:15,000
So I couldn't wait to get started to work on this,

24
0:01:16.307,000 --> 0:01:18,000
so I could introduce Kevin to my robot.

25
0:01:18.941,000 --> 0:01:19,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:19.995,000 --> 0:01:23,000
(Robot noises)

27
0:01:29.552,000 --> 0:01:3,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:30.968,000 --> 0:01:33,000
But that wasn't the kind of robot my dad had in mind.

29
0:01:34.841,000 --> 0:01:35,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:35.933,000 --> 0:01:38,000
See, he owned a chromium-plating company,

31
0:01:39.589,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and they had to move heavy steel parts between tanks of chemicals.

32
0:01:45.486,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And so he needed an industrial robot like this,

33
0:01:48.883,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that could basically do the heavy lifting.

34
0:01:51.684,000 --> 0:01:54,000
But my dad didn't get the kind of robot he wanted, either.

35
0:01:55.87,000 --> 0:01:57,000
He and I worked on it for several years,

36
0:01:58.324,000 --> 0:02:02,000
but it was the 1970s, and the technology that was available to amateurs

37
0:02:03.093,000 --> 0:02:04,000
just wasn't there yet.

38
0:02:05.992,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So Dad continued to do this kind of work by hand.

39
0:02:09.595,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And a few years later,

40
0:02:11.73,000 --> 0:02:12,000
he was diagnosed with cancer.

41
0:02:15.822,000 --> 0:02:16,000
You see,

42
0:02:17.416,000 --> 0:02:19,000
what the robot we were trying to build was telling him

43
0:02:20.036,000 --> 0:02:22,000
was not about doing the heavy lifting.

44
0:02:22.216,000 --> 0:02:23,000
It was a warning

45
0:02:23.391,000 --> 0:02:25,000
about his exposure to the toxic chemicals.

46
0:02:27.184,000 --> 0:02:29,000
He didn't recognize that at the time,

47
0:02:29.501,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and he contracted leukemia.

48
0:02:31.827,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And he died at the age of 45.

49
0:02:35.354,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I was devastated by this.

50
0:02:37.703,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And I never forgot the robot that he and I tried to build.

51
0:02:42.195,000 --> 0:02:45,000
When I was at college, I decided to study engineering, like him.

52
0:02:47.081,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And I went to Carnegie Mellon, and I earned my PhD in robotics.

53
0:02:51.653,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I've been studying robots ever since.

54
0:02:54.721,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So what I'd like to tell you about are four robot projects,

55
0:02:59.34,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and how they've inspired me to be a better human.

56
0:03:06.206,000 --> 0:03:11,000
By 1993, I was a young professor at USC,

57
0:03:11.844,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and I was just building up my own robotics lab,

58
0:03:14.686,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and this was the year the World Wide Web came out.

59
0:03:18.487,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And I remember my students were the ones who told me about it,

60
0:03:21.496,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and we would -- we were just amazed.

61
0:03:23.837,000 --> 0:03:26,000
We started playing with this, and that afternoon,

62
0:03:27.244,000 --> 0:03:31,000
we realized that we could use this new, universal interface

63
0:03:31.546,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to allow anyone in the world to operate the robot in our lab.

64
0:03:37.339,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So, rather than have it fight or do industrial work,

65
0:03:42.413,000 --> 0:03:44,000
we decided to build a planter,

66
0:03:44.967,000 --> 0:03:45,000
put the robot into the center of it,

67
0:03:46.942,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and we called it the Telegarden.

68
0:03:49.736,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And we had put a camera in the gripper of the hand of the robot,

69
0:03:54.277,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and we wrote some special scripts and software,

70
0:03:57.232,000 --> 0:03:59,000
so that anyone in the world could come in,

71
0:03:59.29,000 --> 0:04:,000
and by clicking on the screen,

72
0:04:01.098,000 --> 0:04:04,000
they could move the robot around and visit the garden.

73
0:04:05.416,000 --> 0:04:08,000
But we also set up some other software

74
0:04:09.291,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that lets you participate and help us water the garden, remotely.

75
0:04:13.643,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And if you watered it a few times,

76
0:04:15.956,000 --> 0:04:17,000
we'd give you your own seed to plant.

77
0:04:19.167,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Now, this was an engineering project,

78
0:04:22.667,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and we published some papers on the system design of it,

79
0:04:26.803,000 --> 0:04:28,000
but we also thought of it as an art installation.

80
0:04:30.638,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It was invited, after the first year,

81
0:04:32.811,000 --> 0:04:35,000
by the Ars Electronica Museum in Austria,

82
0:04:35.855,000 --> 0:04:37,000
to have it installed in their lobby.

83
0:04:39.558,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And I'm happy to say, it remained online there, 24 hours a day,

84
0:04:43.569,000 --> 0:04:44,000
for almost nine years.

85
0:04:46.369,000 --> 0:04:49,000
That robot was operated by more people

86
0:04:50.168,000 --> 0:04:51,000
than any other robot in history.

87
0:04:53.303,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Now, one day,

88
0:04:54.954,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I got a call out of the blue from a student,

89
0:04:59.211,000 --> 0:05:03,000
who asked a very simple but profound question.

90
0:05:04.361,000 --> 0:05:06,000
He said, "Is the robot real?"

91
0:05:08.599,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Now, everyone else had assumed it was,

92
0:05:10.909,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and we knew it was, because we were working with it.

93
0:05:13.449,000 --> 0:05:14,000
But I knew what he meant,

94
0:05:14.871,000 --> 0:05:15,000
because it would be possible

95
0:05:16.337,000 --> 0:05:18,000
to take a bunch of pictures of flowers in a garden

96
0:05:19.146,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and then, basically, index them in a computer system,

97
0:05:22.809,000 --> 0:05:24,000
such that it would appear that there was a real robot,

98
0:05:25.46,000 --> 0:05:26,000
when there wasn't.

99
0:05:27.088,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And the more I thought about it,

100
0:05:28.636,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I couldn't think of a good answer for how he could tell the difference.

101
0:05:32.628,000 --> 0:05:34,000
This was right about the time that I was offered a position

102
0:05:35.449,000 --> 0:05:36,000
here at Berkeley.

103
0:05:36.774,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And when I got here,

104
0:05:38.443,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I looked up Hubert Dreyfus,

105
0:05:40.829,000 --> 0:05:42,000
who's a world-renowned professor of philosophy,

106
0:05:44.582,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And I talked with him about this and he said,

107
0:05:47.336,000 --> 0:05:51,000
"This is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy.

108
0:05:51.462,000 --> 0:05:55,000
It goes back to the Skeptics and up through Descartes.

109
0:05:55.503,000 --> 0:05:58,000
It's the issue of epistemology,

110
0:05:58.709,000 --> 0:06:,000
the study of how do we know that something is true."

111
0:06:02.625,000 --> 0:06:04,000
So he and I started working together,

112
0:06:04.649,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and we coined a new term: "telepistemology,"

113
0:06:08.757,000 --> 0:06:1,000
the study of knowledge at a distance.

114
0:06:11.303,000 --> 0:06:15,000
We invited leading artists, engineers and philosophers

115
0:06:15.818,000 --> 0:06:16,000
to write essays about this,

116
0:06:17.161,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and the results are collected in this book from MIT Press.

117
0:06:21.959,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So thanks to this student,

118
0:06:24.079,000 --> 0:06:27,000
who questioned what everyone else had assumed to be true,

119
0:06:27.422,000 --> 0:06:3,000
this project taught me an important lesson about life,

120
0:06:31.423,000 --> 0:06:33,000
which is to always question assumptions.

121
0:06:35.807,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Now, the second project I'll tell you about

122
0:06:38.007,000 --> 0:06:39,000
grew out of the Telegarden.

123
0:06:40.023,000 --> 0:06:42,000
As it was operating, my students and I were very interested

124
0:06:42.868,000 --> 0:06:44,000
in how people were interacting with each other,

125
0:06:45.233,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and what they were doing with the garden.

126
0:06:47.314,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So we started thinking:

127
0:06:48.489,000 --> 0:06:49,000
what if the robot could leave the garden

128
0:06:50.481,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and go out into some other interesting environment?

129
0:06:53.319,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Like, for example, what if it could go to a dinner party

130
0:06:56.084,000 --> 0:06:57,000
at the White House?

131
0:06:57.569,000 --> 0:06:58,000
(Laughter)

132
0:07:00.401,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So, because we were interested more in the system design

133
0:07:03.994,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and the user interface than in the hardware,

134
0:07:06.961,000 --> 0:07:07,000
we decided that,

135
0:07:08.136,000 --> 0:07:12,000
rather than have a robot replace the human to go to the party,

136
0:07:12.647,000 --> 0:07:14,000
we'd have a human replace the robot.

137
0:07:15.679,000 --> 0:07:16,000
We called it the Tele-Actor.

138
0:07:17.978,000 --> 0:07:19,000
We got a human,

139
0:07:20.01,000 --> 0:07:23,000
someone who's very outgoing and gregarious,

140
0:07:23.142,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and she was outfitted with a helmet with various equipment,

141
0:07:27.421,000 --> 0:07:28,000
cameras and microphones,

142
0:07:28.729,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and then a backpack with wireless Internet connection.

143
0:07:32.882,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And the idea was that she could go

144
0:07:35.05,000 --> 0:07:37,000
into a remote and interesting environment,

145
0:07:37.524,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and then over the Internet,

146
0:07:39.565,000 --> 0:07:41,000
people could experience what she was experiencing.

147
0:07:42.736,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So they could see what she was seeing,

148
0:07:45.731,000 --> 0:07:48,000
but then, more importantly, they could participate,

149
0:07:49.038,000 --> 0:07:53,000
by interacting with each other and coming up with ideas

150
0:07:53.812,000 --> 0:07:56,000
about what she should do next and where she should go,

151
0:07:57.805,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and then conveying those to the Tele-Actor.

152
0:08:01.069,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So we got a chance to take the Tele-Actor

153
0:08:03.514,000 --> 0:08:05,000
to the Webby Awards in San Francisco.

154
0:08:07.129,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And that year, Sam Donaldson was the host.

155
0:08:12.29,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Just before the curtain went up, I had about 30 seconds

156
0:08:15.004,000 --> 0:08:18,000
to explain to Mr. Donaldson what we were going to do.

157
0:08:20.119,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And I said, "The Tele-Actor is going to be joining you onstage.

158
0:08:23.66,000 --> 0:08:25,000
This is a new experimental project,

159
0:08:26.038,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and people are watching her on their screens,

160
0:08:28.657,000 --> 0:08:31,000
there's cameras involved and there's microphones

161
0:08:31.972,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and she's got an earbud in her ear,

162
0:08:33.782,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and people over the network are giving her advice

163
0:08:36.123,000 --> 0:08:37,000
about what to do next."

164
0:08:37.305,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And he said, "Wait a second.

165
0:08:39.806,000 --> 0:08:4,000
That's what I do."

166
0:08:41.003,000 --> 0:08:45,000
(Laughter)

167
0:08:46.004,000 --> 0:08:47,000
So he loved the concept,

168
0:08:47.9,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and when the Tele-Actor walked onstage, she walked right up to him,

169
0:08:52.177,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and she gave him a big kiss right on the lips.

170
0:08:54.66,000 --> 0:08:55,000
(Laughter)

171
0:08:56.636,000 --> 0:08:58,000
We were totally surprised -- we had no idea that would happen.

172
0:08:59.582,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And he was great, he just gave her a big hug in return,

173
0:09:02.224,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and it worked out great.

174
0:09:03.905,000 --> 0:09:05,000
But that night, as we were packing up,

175
0:09:05.969,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I asked the Tele-Actor, how did the Tele-Directors decide

176
0:09:10.548,000 --> 0:09:13,000
that they would give a kiss to Sam Donaldson?

177
0:09:15.135,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And she said they hadn't.

178
0:09:17.274,000 --> 0:09:19,000
She said, when she was just about to walk onstage,

179
0:09:19.916,000 --> 0:09:21,000
the Tele-Directors still were trying to agree on what to do,

180
0:09:22.914,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and so she just walked onstage and did what felt most natural.

181
0:09:26.038,000 --> 0:09:3,000
(Laughter)

182
0:09:30.576,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So, the success of the Tele-Actor that night

183
0:09:33.692,000 --> 0:09:37,000
was due to the fact that she was a wonderful actor.

184
0:09:37.969,000 --> 0:09:39,000
She knew when to trust her instincts.

185
0:09:40.422,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And so that project taught me another lesson about life,

186
0:09:44.375,000 --> 0:09:47,000
which is that, when in doubt, improvise.

187
0:09:48.046,000 --> 0:09:49,000
(Laughter)

188
0:09:50.664,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Now, the third project grew out of my experience

189
0:09:55.607,000 --> 0:09:56,000
when my father was in the hospital.

190
0:09:59.284,000 --> 0:10:02,000
He was undergoing a treatment -- chemotherapy treatments --

191
0:10:02.661,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and there's a related treatment called brachytherapy,

192
0:10:06.955,000 --> 0:10:09,000
where tiny, radioactive seeds are placed into the body

193
0:10:10.767,000 --> 0:10:11,000
to treat cancerous tumors.

194
0:10:13.572,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And the way it's done, as you can see here,

195
0:10:15.867,000 --> 0:10:19,000
is that surgeons insert needles into the body

196
0:10:20.258,000 --> 0:10:21,000
to deliver the seeds.

197
0:10:21.974,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And all these needles are inserted in parallel.

198
0:10:26.445,000 --> 0:10:31,000
So it's very common that some of the needles penetrate sensitive organs.

199
0:10:32.635,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And as a result, the needles damage these organs, cause damage,

200
0:10:39.632,000 --> 0:10:41,000
which leads to trauma and side effects.

201
0:10:42.581,000 --> 0:10:43,000
So my students and I wondered:

202
0:10:44.249,000 --> 0:10:48,000
what if we could modify the system,

203
0:10:48.795,000 --> 0:10:5,000
so that the needles could come in at different angles?

204
0:10:52.395,000 --> 0:10:53,000
So we simulated this;

205
0:10:54.262,000 --> 0:10:57,000
we developed some optimization algorithms and we simulated this.

206
0:10:57.731,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And we were able to show

207
0:10:58.906,000 --> 0:11:,000
that we are able to avoid the delicate organs,

208
0:11:01.492,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and yet still achieve the coverage of the tumors with the radiation.

209
0:11:07.313,000 --> 0:11:1,000
So now, we're working with doctors at UCSF

210
0:11:10.811,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and engineers at Johns Hopkins,

211
0:11:13.102,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and we're building a robot that has a number of --

212
0:11:17.088,000 --> 0:11:19,000
it's a specialized design with different joints

213
0:11:19.711,000 --> 0:11:23,000
that can allow the needles to come in at an infinite variety of angles.

214
0:11:24.483,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And as you can see here, they can avoid delicate organs

215
0:11:28.229,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and still reach the targets they're aiming for.

216
0:11:32.019,000 --> 0:11:36,000
So, by questioning this assumption that all the needles have to be parallel,

217
0:11:37.028,000 --> 0:11:39,000
this project also taught me an important lesson:

218
0:11:40.114,000 --> 0:11:44,000
When in doubt, when your path is blocked, pivot.

219
0:11:45.797,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And the last project also has to do with medical robotics.

220
0:11:50.187,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And this is something that's grown out of a system

221
0:11:53.781,000 --> 0:11:56,000
called the da Vinci surgical robot.

222
0:11:57.866,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And this is a commercially available device.

223
0:12:00.334,000 --> 0:12:02,000
It's being used in over 2,000 hospitals around the world.

224
0:12:04.013,000 --> 0:12:08,000
The idea is it allows the surgeon to operate comfortably

225
0:12:08.41,000 --> 0:12:09,000
in his own coordinate frame.

226
0:12:12.762,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Many of the subtasks in surgery are very routine and tedious, like suturing,

227
0:12:18.555,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and currently, all of these are performed

228
0:12:20.846,000 --> 0:12:23,000
under the specific and immediate control of the surgeon.

229
0:12:25.374,000 --> 0:12:27,000
So the surgeon becomes fatigued over time.

230
0:12:28.086,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And we've been wondering,

231
0:12:29.546,000 --> 0:12:33,000
what if we could program the robot to perform some of these subtasks,

232
0:12:33.941,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and thereby free the surgeon

233
0:12:35.346,000 --> 0:12:38,000
to focus on the more complicated parts of the surgery,

234
0:12:38.605,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and also cut down on the time that the surgery would take

235
0:12:41.429,000 --> 0:12:43,000
if we could get the robot to do them a little bit faster?

236
0:12:44.958,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Now, it's hard to program a robot to do delicate things like this.

237
0:12:48.943,000 --> 0:12:52,000
But it turns out my colleague Pieter Abbeel, who's here at Berkeley,

238
0:12:53.173,000 --> 0:12:58,000
has developed a new set of techniques for teaching robots from example.

239
0:12:59.17,000 --> 0:13:01,000
So he's gotten robots to fly helicopters,

240
0:13:01.937,000 --> 0:13:04,000
do incredibly interesting, beautiful acrobatics,

241
0:13:05.215,000 --> 0:13:06,000
by watching human experts fly them.

242
0:13:08.152,000 --> 0:13:09,000
So we got one of these robots.

243
0:13:10.082,000 --> 0:13:12,000
We started working with Pieter and his students.

244
0:13:12.646,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And we asked a surgeon to perform a task --

245
0:13:18.761,000 --> 0:13:19,000
with the robot.

246
0:13:19.936,000 --> 0:13:22,000
So what we're doing is asking the surgeon to perform the task,

247
0:13:22.985,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and we record the motions of the robot.

248
0:13:25.045,000 --> 0:13:26,000
So here's an example.

249
0:13:26.495,000 --> 0:13:29,000
I'll use tracing out a figure eight as an example.

250
0:13:30.17,000 --> 0:13:33,000
So here's what it looks like when the robot --

251
0:13:33.828,000 --> 0:13:36,000
this is what the robot's path looks like, those three examples.

252
0:13:36.92,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Now, those are much better than what a novice like me could do,

253
0:13:41.08,000 --> 0:13:43,000
but they're still jerky and imprecise.

254
0:13:43.798,000 --> 0:13:45,000
So we record all these examples, the data,

255
0:13:46.763,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and then go through a sequence of steps.

256
0:13:50.278,000 --> 0:13:53,000
First, we use a technique called dynamic time warping

257
0:13:53.428,000 --> 0:13:54,000
from speech recognition.

258
0:13:54.942,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And this allows us to temporally align all of the examples.

259
0:13:58.918,000 --> 0:14:03,000
And then we apply Kalman filtering, a technique from control theory,

260
0:14:04.144,000 --> 0:14:06,000
that allows us to statistically analyze all the noise

261
0:14:07.137,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and extract the desired trajectory that underlies them.

262
0:14:13.283,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Now we take those human demonstrations --

263
0:14:15.857,000 --> 0:14:16,000
they're all noisy and imperfect --

264
0:14:17.556,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and we extract from them an inferred task trajectory

265
0:14:20.178,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and control sequence for the robot.

266
0:14:23.181,000 --> 0:14:25,000
We then execute that on the robot,

267
0:14:25.521,000 --> 0:14:27,000
we observe what happens,

268
0:14:27.57,000 --> 0:14:28,000
then we adjust the controls,

269
0:14:28.951,000 --> 0:14:3,000
using a sequence of techniques called iterative learning.

270
0:14:33.129,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Then what we do is we increase the velocity a little bit.

271
0:14:37.244,000 --> 0:14:4,000
We observe the results, adjust the controls again,

272
0:14:41.34,000 --> 0:14:42,000
and observe what happens.

273
0:14:43.136,000 --> 0:14:45,000
And we go through this several rounds.

274
0:14:45.327,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And here's the result.

275
0:14:46.968,000 --> 0:14:47,000
That's the inferred task trajectory,

276
0:14:48.73,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and here's the robot moving at the speed of the human.

277
0:14:51.975,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Here's four times the speed of the human.

278
0:14:54.477,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Here's seven times.

279
0:14:57.004,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And here's the robot operating at 10 times the speed of the human.

280
0:15:02.762,000 --> 0:15:04,000
So we're able to get a robot to perform a delicate task

281
0:15:05.687,000 --> 0:15:07,000
like a surgical subtask,

282
0:15:09.081,000 --> 0:15:1,000
at 10 times the speed of a human.

283
0:15:12.185,000 --> 0:15:14,000
So this project also,

284
0:15:14.469,000 --> 0:15:16,000
because of its involved practicing and learning,

285
0:15:17.018,000 --> 0:15:18,000
doing something over and over again,

286
0:15:18.804,000 --> 0:15:2,000
this project also has a lesson, which is:

287
0:15:21.405,000 --> 0:15:23,000
if you want to do something well,

288
0:15:25.084,000 --> 0:15:29,000
there's no substitute for practice, practice, practice.

289
0:15:33.186,000 --> 0:15:36,000
So these are four of the lessons that I've learned from robots

290
0:15:36.697,000 --> 0:15:37,000
over the years.

291
0:15:39.312,000 --> 0:15:44,000
And the field of robotics has gotten much better over time.

292
0:15:46.319,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Nowadays, high school students can build robots,

293
0:15:48.619,000 --> 0:15:5,000
like the industrial robot my dad and I tried to build.

294
0:15:52.675,000 --> 0:15:54,000
But, it's very -- now ...

295
0:15:55.954,000 --> 0:15:58,000
And now, I have a daughter,

296
0:15:59.857,000 --> 0:16:,000
named Odessa.

297
0:16:01.673,000 --> 0:16:02,000
She's eight years old.

298
0:16:03.682,000 --> 0:16:04,000
And she likes robots, too.

299
0:16:05.97,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Maybe it runs in the family.

300
0:16:07.39,000 --> 0:16:08,000
(Laughter)

301
0:16:08.654,000 --> 0:16:1,000
I wish she could meet my dad.

302
0:16:12.303,000 --> 0:16:14,000
And now I get to teach her how things work,

303
0:16:15.067,000 --> 0:16:17,000
and we get to build projects together.

304
0:16:17.321,000 --> 0:16:2,000
And I wonder what kind of lessons she'll learn from them.

305
0:16:22.147,000 --> 0:16:26,000
Robots are the most human of our machines.

306
0:16:26.983,000 --> 0:16:28,000
They can't solve all of the world's problems,

307
0:16:29.961,000 --> 0:16:32,000
but I think they have something important to teach us.

308
0:16:34.276,000 --> 0:16:36,000
I invite all of you

309
0:16:36.301,000 --> 0:16:39,000
to think about the innovations that you're interested in,

310
0:16:40.712,000 --> 0:16:42,000
the machines that you wish for.

311
0:16:43.66,000 --> 0:16:45,000
And think about what they might be telling you.

312
0:16:47.211,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Because I have a hunch that many of our technological innovations,

313
0:16:50.98,000 --> 0:16:51,000

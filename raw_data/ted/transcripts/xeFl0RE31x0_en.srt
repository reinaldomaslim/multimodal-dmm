1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
If you are a blind child in India,

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
you will very likely have to contend with

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
at least two big pieces of bad news.

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
The first bad news

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
is that the chances of getting treatment

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
are extremely slim to none,

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and that's because most of the blindness

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
alleviation programs in the country

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
are focused on adults,

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and there are very, very few hospitals

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that are actually equipped to treat children.

12
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
In fact, if you were to be treated,

13
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
you might well end up being treated

14
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
by a person who has no medical credentials

15
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
as this case from Rajasthan illustrates.

16
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
This is a three-year-old orphan girl

17
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
who had cataracts.

18
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
So, her caretakers took her

19
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
to the village medicine man,

20
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and instead of suggesting to the caretakers

21
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that the girl be taken to a hospital,

22
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
the person decided to burn her abdomen

23
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
with red-hot iron bars

24
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
to drive out the demons.

25
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
The second piece of bad news

26
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
will be delivered to you

27
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
by neuroscientists, who will tell you

28
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that if you are older than four or five years of age,

29
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that even if you have your eye corrected,

30
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
the chances of your brain learning how to see

31
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
are very, very slim --

32
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
again, slim or none.

33
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
So when I heard these two things,

34
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
it troubled me deeply,

35
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
both because of personal reasons

36
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and scientific reasons.

37
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So let me first start with the personal reason.

38
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
It'll sound corny, but it's sincere.

39
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
That's my son, Darius.

40
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
As a new father,

41
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I have a qualitatively different sense

42
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
of just how delicate babies are,

43
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
what our obligations are towards them

44
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and how much love

45
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
we can feel towards a child.

46
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I would move heaven and earth

47
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
in order to get treatment for Darius,

48
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and for me to be told

49
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that there might be other Dariuses

50
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
who are not getting treatment,

51
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that's just viscerally wrong.

52
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So that's the personal reason.

53
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Scientific reason is that this notion

54
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
from neuroscience of critical periods --

55
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that if the brain is older

56
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
than four or five years of age,

57
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
it loses its ability to learn --

58
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that doesn't sit well with me,

59
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
because I don't think that idea

60
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
has been tested adequately.

61
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
The birth of the idea is from

62
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel's work,

63
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
two researchers who were at Harvard,

64
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and they got the Nobel Prize in 1981

65
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
for their studies of visual physiology,

66
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
which are remarkably beautiful studies,

67
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
but I believe some of their work

68
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
has been extrapolated

69
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
into the human domain prematurely.

70
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
So, they did their work with kittens,

71
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
with different kinds of deprivation regiments,

72
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and those studies,

73
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
which date back to the '60s,

74
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
are now being applied to human children.

75
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So I felt that I needed to do two things.

76
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
One: provide care

77
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
to children who are currently

78
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
being deprived of treatment.

79
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
That's the humanitarian mission.

80
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And the scientific mission would be

81
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
to test the limits

82
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
of visual plasticity.

83
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And these two missions, as you can tell,

84
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
thread together perfectly. One adds to the other;

85
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
in fact, one would be impossible without the other.

86
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So, to implement

87
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
these twin missions,

88
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
a few years ago, I launched Project Prakash.

89
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Prakash, as many of you know,

90
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
is the Sanskrit word for light,

91
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and the idea is that

92
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
in bringing light into the lives of children,

93
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
we also have a chance

94
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
of shedding light on some of the

95
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
deepest mysteries of neuroscience.

96
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And the logo -- even though it looks extremely Irish,

97
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
it's actually derived from

98
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
the Indian symbol of Diya, an earthen lamp.

99
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
The Prakash, the overall effort

100
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
has three components:

101
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
outreach, to identify children in need of care;

102
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
medical treatment; and in subsequent study.

103
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And I want to show you a short video clip

104
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that illustrates the first two components of this work.

105
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
This is an outreach station

106
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
conducted at a school for the blind.

107
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
(Text: Most of the children are profoundly and permanently blind ...)

108
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Pawan Sinha: So, because this is a school for the blind,

109
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
many children have permanent conditions.

110
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
That's a case of microphthalmos,

111
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
which is malformed eyes,

112
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and that's a permanent condition;

113
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
it cannot be treated.

114
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
That's an extreme of micropthalmos

115
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
called enophthalmos.

116
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
But, every so often, we come across children

117
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
who show some residual vision,

118
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and that is a very good sign

119
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
that the condition might actually be treatable.

120
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So, after that screening, we bring the children to the hospital.

121
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
That's the hospital we're working with in Delhi,

122
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
the Schroff Charity Eye Hospital.

123
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
It has a very well-equipped

124
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
pediatric ophthalmic center,

125
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
which was made possible in part

126
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
by a gift from the Ronald McDonald charity.

127
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So, eating burgers actually helps.

128
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
(Text: Such examinations allow us to improve

129
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
eye-health in many children, and ...

130
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
... help us find children who can participate in Project Prakash.)

131
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
PS: So, as I zoom in to the eyes of this child,

132
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
you will see the cause of his blindness.

133
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
The whites that you see in the middle of his pupils

134
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
are congenital cataracts,

135
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
so opacities of the lens.

136
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
In our eyes, the lens is clear,

137
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
but in this child, the lens has become opaque,

138
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and therefore he can't see the world.

139
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So, the child is given treatment. You'll see shots of the eye.

140
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Here's the eye with the opaque lens,

141
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
the opaque lens extracted

142
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and an acrylic lens inserted.

143
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And here's the same child

144
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
three weeks post-operation,

145
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
with the right eye open.

146
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
(Applause)

147
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Thank you.

148
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So, even from that little clip, you can begin to get the sense

149
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that recovery is possible,

150
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and we have now

151
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
provided treatment to over 200 children,

152
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
and the story repeats itself.

153
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
After treatment, the child

154
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
gains significant functionality.

155
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
In fact, the story holds true

156
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
even if you have a person who got sight

157
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
after several years of deprivation.

158
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We did a paper a few years ago

159
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
about this woman that you see on the right, SRD,

160
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and she got her sight late in life,

161
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and her vision is remarkable at this age.

162
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I should add a tragic postscript to this --

163
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
she died two years ago

164
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
in a bus accident.

165
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So, hers is just a truly inspiring story --

166
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
unknown, but inspiring story.

167
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So when we started finding these results,

168
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
as you might imagine, it created quite a bit of stir

169
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
in the scientific and the popular press.

170
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Here's an article in Nature

171
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
that profiled this work,

172
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and another one in Time.

173
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So, we were fairly convinced -- we are convinced --

174
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
that recovery is feasible,

175
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
despite extended visual deprivation.

176
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
The next obvious question to ask:

177
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
What is the process of recovery?

178
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
So, the way we study that is,

179
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
let's say we find a child who has light sensitivity.

180
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
The child is provided treatment,

181
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and I want to stress that the treatment

182
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
is completely unconditional;

183
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
there is no quid pro quo.

184
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
We treat many more children then we actually work with.

185
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Every child who needs treatment is treated.

186
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
After treatment, about every week,

187
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
we run the child

188
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
on a battery of simple visual tests

189
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
in order to see how their visual skills

190
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
are coming on line.

191
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And we try to do this for as long as possible.

192
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
This arc of development

193
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
gives us unprecedented

194
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and extremely valuable information

195
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
about how the scaffolding of vision

196
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
gets set up.

197
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
What might be the causal connections

198
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
between the early developing skills

199
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and the later developing ones?

200
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And we've used this general approach to study

201
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
many different visual proficiencies,

202
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
but I want to highlight one particular one,

203
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and that is image parsing into objects.

204
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
So, any image of the kind that you see on the left,

205
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
be it a real image or a synthetic image,

206
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
it's made up of little regions

207
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
that you see in the middle column,

208
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
regions of different colors, different luminances.

209
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
The brain has this complex task

210
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
of putting together, integrating,

211
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
subsets of these regions

212
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
into something that's more meaningful,

213
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
into what we would consider to be objects,

214
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
as you see on the right.

215
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And nobody knows how this integration happens,

216
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and that's the question we asked with Project Prakash.

217
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So, here's what happens

218
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
very soon after the onset of sight.

219
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Here's a person who had gained sight just a couple of weeks ago,

220
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and you see Ethan Myers, a graduate student from MIT,

221
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
running the experiment with him.

222
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
His visual-motor coordination is quite poor,

223
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
but you get a general sense

224
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
of what are the regions that he's trying to trace out.

225
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
If you show him real world images,

226
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
if you show others like him real world images,

227
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
they are unable to recognize most of the objects

228
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
because the world to them is over-fragmented;

229
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
it's made up of a collage, a patchwork,

230
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
of regions of different colors and luminances.

231
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And that's what's indicated in the green outlines.

232
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
When you ask them,

233
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
"Even if you can't name the objects, just point to where the objects are,"

234
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
these are the regions that they point to.

235
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
So the world is this complex

236
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
patchwork of regions.

237
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Even the shadow on the ball

238
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
becomes its own object.

239
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Interestingly enough,

240
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
you give them a few months,

241
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and this is what happens.

242
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Doctor: How many are these?

243
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Patient: These are two things.

244
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Doctor: What are their shapes?

245
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Patient: Their shapes ...

246
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
This one is a circle,

247
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and this

248
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
is a square.

249
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
PS: A very dramatic transformation has come about.

250
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And the question is:

251
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
What underlies this transformation?

252
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
It's a profound question,

253
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and what's even more amazing is how simple

254
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
the answer is.

255
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
The answer lies in motion

256
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and that's what I want to show you in the next clip.

257
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Doctor: What shape do you see here?

258
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Patient: I can't make it out.

259
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Doctor: Now?

260
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Patient: Triangle.

261
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Doctor: How many things are these?

262
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Now, how many things are these?

263
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Patient: Two.

264
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Doctor: What are these things?

265
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Patient: A square and a circle.

266
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
PS: And we see this pattern over and over again.

267
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
The one thing the visual system needs

268
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
in order to begin parsing the world

269
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
is dynamic information.

270
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
So the inference we are deriving from this,

271
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and several such experiments,

272
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
is that dynamic information processing,

273
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
or motion processing,

274
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
serves as the bedrock for building

275
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
the rest of the complexity of visual processing;

276
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
it leads to visual integration

277
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and eventually to recognition.

278
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
This simple idea has far reaching implications.

279
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And let me just quickly mention two,

280
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
one, drawing from the domain of engineering,

281
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and one from the clinic.

282
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
So, from the perspective of engineering,

283
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
we can ask: Goven that we know

284
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
that motion is so important for the human visual system,

285
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
can we use this as a recipe

286
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
for constructing machine-based vision systems

287
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
that can learn on their own, that don't need to be programmed

288
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
by a human programmer?

289
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And that's what we're trying to do.

290
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
I'm at MIT, at MIT you need to apply

291
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
whatever basic knowledge you gain.

292
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
So we are creating Dylan,

293
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
which is a computational system

294
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
with an ambitious goal

295
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
of taking in visual inputs

296
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
of the same kind that a human child would receive,

297
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and autonomously discovering:

298
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
What are the objects in this visual input?

299
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
So, don't worry about the internals of Dylan.

300
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Here, I'm just going to talk about

301
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
how we test Dylan.

302
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
The way we test Dylan is by giving it

303
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
inputs, as I said, of the same kind

304
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
that a baby, or a child in Project Prakash would get.

305
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
But for a long time we couldn't quite figure out:

306
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Wow can we get these kinds of video inputs?

307
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
So, I thought,

308
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
could we have Darius

309
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
serve as our babycam carrier,

310
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and that way get the inputs that we feed into Dylan?

311
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
So that's what we did.

312
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
(Laughter)

313
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
I had to have long conversations with my wife.

314
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
(Laughter)

315
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
In fact, Pam, if you're watching this,

316
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
please forgive me.

317
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
So, we modified the optics of the camera

318
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
in order to mimic the baby's visual acuity.

319
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
As some of you might know,

320
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
babyies are born pretty much legally blind.

321
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Their acuity -- our acuity is 20/20;

322
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
babies' acuity is like 20/800,

323
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
so they are looking at the world

324
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
in a very, very blurry fashion.

325
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Here's what a baby-cam video looks like.

326
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
(Laughter)

327
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
(Applause)

328
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Thankfully, there isn't any audio

329
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
to go with this.

330
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
What's amazing is that working with such

331
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
highly degraded input,

332
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
the baby, very quickly, is able

333
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
to discover meaning in such input.

334
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
But then two or three days afterward,

335
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
babies begin to pay attention

336
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
to their mother's or their father's face.

337
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
How does that happen? We want Dylan to be able to do that,

338
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and using this mantra of motion,

339
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Dylan actually can do that.

340
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
So, given that kind of video input,

341
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
with just about six or seven minutes worth of video,

342
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Dylan can begin to extract patterns

343
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
that include faces.

344
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
So, it's an important demonstration

345
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
of the power of motion.

346
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
The clinical implication, it comes from the domain of autism.

347
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
Visual integration has been associated with autism

348
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
by several researchers.

349
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
When we saw that, we asked:

350
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Could the impairment in visual integration

351
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
be the manifestation of something underneath,

352
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
of dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism?

353
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Because, if that hypothesis were to be true,

354
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
it would have massive repercussions in our understanding

355
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
of what's causing the many different aspects

356
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
of the autism phenotype.

357
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
What you're going to see are

358
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
video clips of two children -- one neurotypical,

359
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
one with autism, playing Pong.

360
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
So, while the child is playing Pong, we are tracking where they're looking.

361
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
In red are the eye movement traces.

362
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
This is the neurotypical child, and what you see

363
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
is that the child is able to make cues

364
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
of the dynamic information

365
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
to predict where the ball is going to go.

366
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Even before the ball gets to a place,

367
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
the child is already looking there.

368
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
Contrast this with a child

369
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
with autism playing the same game.

370
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
Instead of anticipating,

371
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
the child always follows where the ball has been.

372
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
The efficiency of the use

373
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
of dynamic information

374
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
seems to be significantly compromised in autism.

375
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
So we are pursuing this line of work

376
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
and hopefully we'll have

377
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
more results to report soon.

378
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
Looking ahead, if you think of this disk

379
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
as representing all of the children

380
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
we've treated so far,

381
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
this is the magnitude of the problem.

382
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
The red dots are the children we have not treated.

383
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
So, there are many, many more children who need to be treated,

384
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
and in order to expand the scope of the project,

385
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
we are planning on launching

386
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
The Prakash Center for Children,

387
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
which will have a dedicated pediatric hospital,

388
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
a school for the children we are treating

389
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
and also a cutting-edge research facility.

390
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
The Prakash Center will integrate health care,

391
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
education and research in a way

392
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
that truly creates the whole

393
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
to be greater than the sum of the parts.

394
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
So, to summarize: Prakash, in its five years of existence,

395
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
it's had an impact in multiple areas,

396
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
ranging from basic neuroscience

397
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
plasticity and learning in the brain,

398
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
to clinically relevant hypotheses like in autism,

399
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
the development of autonomous machine vision systems,

400
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
education of the undergraduate and graduate students,

401
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
and most importantly in the alleviation

402
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
of childhood blindness.

403
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
And for my students and I, it's been

404
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
just a phenomenal experience

405
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
because we have gotten to do interesting research,

406
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
while at the same time

407
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
helping the many children that we have worked with.

408
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
Thank you very much.

409
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
(Applause)

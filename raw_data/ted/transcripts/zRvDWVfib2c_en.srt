0:00:15.461,000 --> 0:00:16,000
The theme of my talk today is,

3
0:00:17.153,000 --> 0:00:2,000
"Be an artist, right now."

4
0:00:20.361,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Most people, when this subject is brought up,

5
0:00:23.418,000 --> 0:00:25,000
get tense and resist it:

6
0:00:26.044,000 --> 0:00:28,000
"Art doesn't feed me, and right now I'm busy.

7
0:00:29.038,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I have to go to school, get a job,

8
0:00:31.414,000 --> 0:00:33,000
send my kids to lessons ... "

9
0:00:33.701,000 --> 0:00:38,000
You think, "I'm too busy. I don't have time for art."

10
0:00:39.236,000 --> 0:00:42,000
There are hundreds of reasons why we can't be artists right now.

11
0:00:42.697,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Don't they just pop into your head?

12
0:00:44.252,000 --> 0:00:45,000
There are so many reasons why we can't be,

13
0:00:46.075,000 --> 0:00:48,000
indeed, we're not sure why we should be.

14
0:00:48.635,000 --> 0:00:49,000
We don't know why we should be artists,

15
0:00:50.328,000 --> 0:00:53,000
but we have many reasons why we can't be.

16
0:00:54.231,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Why do people instantly resist the idea of associating themselves with art?

17
0:00:58.606,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Perhaps you think art is for the greatly gifted

18
0:01:02.474,000 --> 0:01:07,000
or for the thoroughly and professionally trained.

19
0:01:07.526,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And some of you may think you've strayed too far from art.

20
0:01:11.869,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Well you might have, but I don't think so.

21
0:01:16.487,000 --> 0:01:18,000
This is the theme of my talk today.

22
0:01:18.956,000 --> 0:01:19,000
We are all born artists.

23
0:01:20.758,000 --> 0:01:23,000
If you have kids, you know what I mean.

24
0:01:23.802,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Almost everything kids do is art.

25
0:01:28.687,000 --> 0:01:3,000
They draw with crayons on the wall.

26
0:01:31.265,000 --> 0:01:34,000
They dance to Son Dam Bi's dance on TV,

27
0:01:34.417,000 --> 0:01:37,000
but you can't even call it Son Dam Bi's dance -- it becomes the kids' own dance.

28
0:01:38.275,000 --> 0:01:43,000
So they dance a strange dance and inflict their singing on everyone.

29
0:01:43.561,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Perhaps their art is something only their parents can bear,

30
0:01:47.535,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and because they practice such art all day long,

31
0:01:52.732,000 --> 0:01:55,000
people honestly get a little tired around kids.

32
0:01:56.011,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Kids will sometimes perform monodramas --

33
0:01:59.166,000 --> 0:02:02,000
playing house is indeed a monodrama or a play.

34
0:02:02.712,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And some kids, when they get a bit older,

35
0:02:05.391,000 --> 0:02:07,000
start to lie.

36
0:02:07.411,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Usually parents remember the very first time their kid lies.

37
0:02:12.502,000 --> 0:02:13,000
They're shocked.

38
0:02:13.847,000 --> 0:02:16,000
"Now you're showing your true colors," Mom says. She thinks, "Why does he take after his dad?"

39
0:02:17.415,000 --> 0:02:2,000
She questions him, "What kind of a person are you going to be?"

40
0:02:20.621,000 --> 0:02:21,000
But you shouldn't worry.

41
0:02:22.192,000 --> 0:02:28,000
The moment kids start to lie is the moment storytelling begins.

42
0:02:28.412,000 --> 0:02:3,000
They are talking about things they didn't see.

43
0:02:30.6,000 --> 0:02:31,000
It's amazing. It's a wonderful moment.

44
0:02:32.391,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Parents should celebrate.

45
0:02:34.458,000 --> 0:02:38,000
"Hurray! My boy finally started to lie!"

46
0:02:38.615,000 --> 0:02:4,000
All right! It calls for celebration.

47
0:02:40.844,000 --> 0:02:43,000
For example, a kid says, "Mom, guess what? I met an alien on my way home."

48
0:02:44.233,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Then a typical mom responds, "Stop that nonsense."

49
0:02:48.684,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Now, an ideal parent is someone who responds like this:

50
0:02:52.3,000 --> 0:02:55,000
"Really? An alien, huh? What did it look like? Did it say anything?

51
0:02:55.372,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Where did you meet it?" "Um, in front of the supermarket."

52
0:02:57.076,000 --> 0:02:59,000
When you have a conversation like this,

53
0:02:59.398,000 --> 0:03:05,000
the kid has to come up with the next thing to say to be responsible for what he started.

54
0:03:05.773,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Soon, a story develops.

55
0:03:07.937,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Of course this is an infantile story,

56
0:03:12.414,000 --> 0:03:15,000
but thinking up one sentence after the next

57
0:03:16.23,000 --> 0:03:2,000
is the same thing a professional writer like me does.

58
0:03:20.298,000 --> 0:03:22,000
In essence, they are not different.

59
0:03:22.677,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Roland Barthes once said of Flaubert's novels,

60
0:03:25.363,000 --> 0:03:27,000
"Flaubert did not write a novel.

61
0:03:27.969,000 --> 0:03:3,000
He merely connected one sentence after another.

62
0:03:30.974,000 --> 0:03:34,000
The eros between sentences, that is the essence of Flaubert's novel."

63
0:03:35.701,000 --> 0:03:37,000
That's right -- a novel, basically, is writing one sentence,

64
0:03:38.484,000 --> 0:03:41,000
then, without violating the scope of the first one,

65
0:03:41.943,000 --> 0:03:42,000
writing the next sentence.

66
0:03:43.648,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And you continue to make connections.

67
0:03:45.157,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Take a look at this sentence:

68
0:03:47.223,000 --> 0:03:49,000
"One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams, he discovered that in his bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug."

69
0:03:49.69,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Yes, it's the first sentence of Franz Kafka's "The Metamorphosis."

70
0:03:52.136,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Writing such an unjustifiable sentence

71
0:03:55.304,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and continuing in order to justify it,

72
0:03:57.752,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Kafka's work became the masterpiece of contemporary literature.

73
0:04:02.181,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Kafka did not show his work to his father.

74
0:04:04.93,000 --> 0:04:06,000
He was not on good terms with his father.

75
0:04:07.254,000 --> 0:04:1,000
On his own, he wrote these sentences.

76
0:04:11.05,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Had he shown his father, "My boy has finally lost it," he would've thought.

77
0:04:14.313,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And that's right. Art is about going a little nuts

78
0:04:16.225,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and justifying the next sentence,

79
0:04:18.472,000 --> 0:04:21,000
which is not much different from what a kid does.

80
0:04:21.733,000 --> 0:04:22,000
A kid who has just started to lie

81
0:04:23.264,000 --> 0:04:26,000
is taking the first step as a storyteller.

82
0:04:26.39,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Kids do art.

83
0:04:28.951,000 --> 0:04:29,000
They don't get tired and they have fun doing it.

84
0:04:30.376,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I was in Jeju Island a few days ago.

85
0:04:32.137,000 --> 0:04:37,000
When kids are on the beach, most of them love playing in the water.

86
0:04:37.249,000 --> 0:04:39,000
But some of them spend a lot of time in the sand,

87
0:04:40.156,000 --> 0:04:42,000
making mountains and seas -- well, not seas,

88
0:04:42.4,000 --> 0:04:45,000
but different things -- people and dogs, etc.

89
0:04:46.347,000 --> 0:04:47,000
But parents tell them,

90
0:04:47.76,000 --> 0:04:48,000
"It will all be washed away by the waves."

91
0:04:49.523,000 --> 0:04:5,000
In other words, it's useless.

92
0:04:51.345,000 --> 0:04:52,000
There's no need.

93
0:04:52.489,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But kids don't mind.

94
0:04:54.355,000 --> 0:04:55,000
They have fun in the moment

95
0:04:55.526,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and they keep playing in the sand.

96
0:04:57.692,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Kids don't do it because someone told them to.

97
0:04:59.958,000 --> 0:05:,000
They aren't told by their boss

98
0:05:01.554,000 --> 0:05:03,000
or anyone, they just do it.

99
0:05:04.479,000 --> 0:05:09,000
When you were little, I bet you spent time enjoying the pleasure of primitive art.

100
0:05:09.875,000 --> 0:05:13,000
When I ask my students to write about their happiest moment,

101
0:05:14.237,000 --> 0:05:19,000
many write about an early artistic experience they had as a kid.

102
0:05:20.161,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Learning to play piano for the first time and playing four hands with a friend,

103
0:05:22.916,000 --> 0:05:27,000
or performing a ridiculous skit with friends looking like idiots -- things like that.

104
0:05:27.932,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Or the moment you developed the first film you shot with an old camera.

105
0:05:31.283,000 --> 0:05:33,000
They talk about these kinds of experiences.

106
0:05:33.606,000 --> 0:05:35,000
You must have had such a moment.

107
0:05:35.871,000 --> 0:05:36,000
In that moment, art makes you happy

108
0:05:37.804,000 --> 0:05:38,000
because it's not work.

109
0:05:39.481,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Work doesn't make you happy, does it? Mostly it's tough.

110
0:05:42.014,000 --> 0:05:45,000
The French writer Michel Tournier has a famous saying.

111
0:05:45.115,000 --> 0:05:46,000
It's a bit mischievous, actually.

112
0:05:46.805,000 --> 0:05:5,000
"Work is against human nature. The proof is that it makes us tired."

113
0:05:51.777,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Right? Why would work tire us if it's in our nature?

114
0:05:53.262,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Playing doesn't tire us.

115
0:05:54.923,000 --> 0:05:55,000
We can play all night long.

116
0:05:56.358,000 --> 0:05:58,000
If we work overnight, we should be paid for overtime.

117
0:05:58.791,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Why? Because it's tiring and we feel fatigue.

118
0:06:02.075,000 --> 0:06:06,000
But kids, usually they do art for fun. It's playing.

119
0:06:06.757,000 --> 0:06:08,000
They don't draw to sell the work to a client

120
0:06:09.491,000 --> 0:06:12,000
or play the piano to earn money for the family.

121
0:06:12.516,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Of course, there were kids who had to.

122
0:06:15.292,000 --> 0:06:16,000
You know this gentleman, right?

123
0:06:16.594,000 --> 0:06:2,000
He had to tour around Europe to support his family --

124
0:06:20.68,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart --

125
0:06:22.57,000 --> 0:06:24,000
but that was centuries ago, so we can make him an exception.

126
0:06:25.533,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Unfortunately, at some point our art -- such a joyful pastime -- ends.

127
0:06:29.398,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Kids have to go to lessons, to school, do homework

128
0:06:32.788,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and of course they take piano or ballet lessons,

129
0:06:36.306,000 --> 0:06:37,000
but they aren't fun anymore.

130
0:06:38.075,000 --> 0:06:41,000
You're told to do it and there's competition. How can it be fun?

131
0:06:41.407,000 --> 0:06:46,000
If you're in elementary school and you still draw on the wall,

132
0:06:46.999,000 --> 0:06:49,000
you'll surely get in trouble with your mom.

133
0:06:50.914,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Besides,

134
0:06:54.781,000 --> 0:06:56,000
if you continue to act like an artist as you get older,

135
0:06:57.361,000 --> 0:07:,000
you'll increasingly feel pressure --

136
0:07:01.029,000 --> 0:07:07,000
people will question your actions and ask you to act properly.

137
0:07:07.084,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Here's my story: I was an eighth grader and I entered a drawing contest at school in Gyeongbokgung.

138
0:07:13.271,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I was trying my best, and my teacher came around

139
0:07:16.178,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and asked me, "What are you doing?"

140
0:07:19.766,000 --> 0:07:2,000
"I'm drawing diligently," I said.

141
0:07:21.58,000 --> 0:07:22,000
"Why are you using only black?"

142
0:07:23.483,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Indeed, I was eagerly coloring the sketchbook in black.

143
0:07:25.863,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And I explained,

144
0:07:28.932,000 --> 0:07:31,000
"It's a dark night and a crow is perching on a branch."

145
0:07:32.179,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Then my teacher said,

146
0:07:33.177,000 --> 0:07:38,000
"Really? Well, Young-ha, you may not be good at drawing but you have a talent for storytelling."

147
0:07:38.499,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Or so I wished.

148
0:07:41.234,000 --> 0:07:43,000
"Now you'll get it, you rascal!" was the response. (Laughter)

149
0:07:44.002,000 --> 0:07:45,000
"You'll get it!" he said.

150
0:07:45.606,000 --> 0:07:47,000
You were supposed to draw the palace, the Gyeonghoeru, etc.,

151
0:07:48.288,000 --> 0:07:5,000
but I was coloring everything in black,

152
0:07:50.723,000 --> 0:07:51,000
so he dragged me out of the group.

153
0:07:52.407,000 --> 0:07:54,000
There were a lot of girls there as well,

154
0:07:54.427,000 --> 0:07:55,000
so I was utterly mortified.

155
0:07:55.978,000 --> 0:07:59,000
None of my explanations or excuses were heard,

156
0:08:00.43,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and I really got it big time.

157
0:08:03.643,000 --> 0:08:07,000
If he was an ideal teacher, he would have responded like I said before,

158
0:08:08.161,000 --> 0:08:1,000
"Young-ha may not have a talent for drawing,

159
0:08:10.474,000 --> 0:08:13,000
but he has a gift for making up stories," and he would have encouraged me.

160
0:08:13.849,000 --> 0:08:16,000
But such a teacher is seldom found.

161
0:08:17.301,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Later, I grew up and went to Europe's galleries --

162
0:08:20.264,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I was a university student -- and I thought this was really unfair.

163
0:08:22.165,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Look what I found. (Laughter)

164
0:08:27.563,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Works like this were hung in Basel while I was punished

165
0:08:31.888,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and stood in front of the palace with my drawing in my mouth.

166
0:08:37.281,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Look at this. Doesn't it look just like wallpaper?

167
0:08:40.287,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Contemporary art, I later discovered, isn't explained by a lame story like mine.

168
0:08:42.203,000 --> 0:08:45,000
No crows are brought up.

169
0:08:46.148,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Most of the works have no title, Untitled.

170
0:08:49.481,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Anyways, contemporary art in the 20th century

171
0:08:52.582,000 --> 0:08:57,000
is about doing something weird and filling the void with explanation and interpretation --

172
0:08:57.951,000 --> 0:08:58,000
essentially the same as I did.

173
0:08:59.43,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Of course, my work was very amateur,

174
0:09:02.178,000 --> 0:09:05,000
but let's turn to more famous examples.

175
0:09:05.467,000 --> 0:09:07,000
This is Picasso's.

176
0:09:08.068,000 --> 0:09:13,000
He stuck handlebars into a bike seat and called it "Bull's Head." Sounds convincing, right?

177
0:09:13.869,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Next, a urinal was placed on its side and called "Fountain".

178
0:09:18.513,000 --> 0:09:19,000
That was Duchamp.

179
0:09:20.107,000 --> 0:09:24,000
So filling the gap between explanation and a weird act with stories --

180
0:09:24.557,000 --> 0:09:28,000
that's indeed what contemporary art is all about.

181
0:09:28.684,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Picasso even made the statement,

182
0:09:30.072,000 --> 0:09:34,000
"I draw not what I see but what I think."

183
0:09:34.249,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Yes, it means I didn't have to draw Gyeonghoeru.

184
0:09:36.766,000 --> 0:09:4,000
I wish I knew what Picasso said back then. I could have argued better with my teacher.

185
0:09:40.837,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Unfortunately, the little artists within us

186
0:09:44.639,000 --> 0:09:49,000
are choked to death before we get to fight against the oppressors of art.

187
0:09:50.126,000 --> 0:09:51,000
They get locked in.

188
0:09:51.731,000 --> 0:09:52,000
That's our tragedy.

189
0:09:52.814,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So what happens when little artists get locked in, banished or even killed?

190
0:09:58.074,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Our artistic desire doesn't go away.

191
0:09:59.457,000 --> 0:10:02,000
We want to express, to reveal ourselves,

192
0:10:02.554,000 --> 0:10:07,000
but with the artist dead, the artistic desire reveals itself in dark form.

193
0:10:07.792,000 --> 0:10:09,000
In karaoke bars, there are always people who sing

194
0:10:10.759,000 --> 0:10:12,000
"She's Gone" or "Hotel California,"

195
0:10:13.301,000 --> 0:10:15,000
miming the guitar riffs.

196
0:10:15.621,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Usually they sound awful. Awful indeed.

197
0:10:17.863,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Some people turn into rockers like this.

198
0:10:20.342,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Or some people dance in clubs.

199
0:10:22.415,000 --> 0:10:25,000
People who would have enjoyed telling stories

200
0:10:25.817,000 --> 0:10:28,000
end up trolling on the Internet all night long.

201
0:10:28.827,000 --> 0:10:31,000
That's how a writing talent reveals itself on the dark side.

202
0:10:32.222,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Sometimes we see dads get more excited than their kids

203
0:10:36.175,000 --> 0:10:38,000
playing with Legos or putting together plastic robots.

204
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
They go, "Don't touch it. Daddy will do it for you."

205
0:10:40.893,000 --> 0:10:41,000
The kid has already lost interest and is doing something else,

206
0:10:42.528,000 --> 0:10:46,000
but the dad alone builds castles.

207
0:10:46.537,000 --> 0:10:5,000
This shows the artistic impulses inside us are suppressed, not gone.

208
0:10:51.015,000 --> 0:10:54,000
But they can often reveal themselves negatively, in the form of jealousy.

209
0:10:54.807,000 --> 0:10:59,000
You know the song "I would love to be on TV"? Why would we love it?

210
0:11:00.101,000 --> 0:11:03,000
TV is full of people who do what we wished to do,

211
0:11:03.929,000 --> 0:11:04,000
but never got to.

212
0:11:05.869,000 --> 0:11:11,000
They dance, they act -- and the more they do, they are praised.

213
0:11:11.998,000 --> 0:11:14,000
So we start to envy them.

214
0:11:15.148,000 --> 0:11:19,000
We become dictators with a remote and start to criticize the people on TV.

215
0:11:19.242,000 --> 0:11:24,000
"He just can't act." "You call that singing? She can't hit the notes."

216
0:11:25.095,000 --> 0:11:27,000
We easily say these sorts of things.

217
0:11:27.385,000 --> 0:11:29,000
We get jealous, not because we're evil,

218
0:11:30.328,000 --> 0:11:34,000
but because we have little artists pent up inside us.

219
0:11:34.865,000 --> 0:11:37,000
That's what I think.

220
0:11:38.451,000 --> 0:11:39,000
What should we do then?

221
0:11:40.289,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Yes, that's right.

222
0:11:41.066,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Right now, we need to start our own art.

223
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Right this minute, we can turn off TV,

224
0:11:45.269,000 --> 0:11:47,000
log off the Internet,

225
0:11:47.718,000 --> 0:11:49,000
get up and start to do something.

226
0:11:50.418,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Where I teach students in drama school,

227
0:11:52.153,000 --> 0:11:54,000
there's a course called Dramatics.

228
0:11:54.887,000 --> 0:11:58,000
In this course, all students must put on a play.

229
0:11:59.077,000 --> 0:12:03,000
However, acting majors are not supposed to act.

230
0:12:03.189,000 --> 0:12:05,000
They can write the play, for example,

231
0:12:05.209,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and the writers may work on stage art.

232
0:12:07.933,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Likewise, stage art majors may become actors, and in this way you put on a show.

233
0:12:10.244,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Students at first wonder whether they can actually do it,

234
0:12:13.992,000 --> 0:12:17,000
but later they have so much fun. I rarely see anyone who is miserable doing a play.

235
0:12:18.555,000 --> 0:12:22,000
In school, the military or even in a mental institution, once you make people do it, they enjoy it.

236
0:12:22.717,000 --> 0:12:26,000
I saw this happen in the army -- many people had fun doing plays.

237
0:12:27.613,000 --> 0:12:29,000
I have another experience:

238
0:12:30.545,000 --> 0:12:33,000
In my writing class, I give students a special assignment.

239
0:12:34.179,000 --> 0:12:39,000
I have students like you in the class -- many who don't major in writing.

240
0:12:40.079,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Some major in art or music and think they can't write.

241
0:12:44.656,000 --> 0:12:47,000
So I give them blank sheets of paper and a theme.

242
0:12:48.383,000 --> 0:12:49,000
It can be a simple theme:

243
0:12:49.997,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Write about the most unfortunate experience in your childhood.

244
0:12:52.511,000 --> 0:12:55,000
There's one condition: You must write like crazy. Like crazy!

245
0:12:56.424,000 --> 0:12:58,000
I walk around and encourage them,

246
0:12:59.157,000 --> 0:13:02,000
"Come on, come on!" They have to write like crazy for an hour or two.

247
0:13:02.901,000 --> 0:13:05,000
They only get to think for the first five minutes.

248
0:13:06.109,000 --> 0:13:09,000
The reason I make them write like crazy is because

249
0:13:09.331,000 --> 0:13:11,000
when you write slowly and lots of thoughts cross your mind,

250
0:13:12.089,000 --> 0:13:14,000
the artistic devil creeps in.

251
0:13:14.536,000 --> 0:13:18,000
This devil will tell you hundreds of reasons

252
0:13:18.568,000 --> 0:13:2,000
why you can't write:

253
0:13:21.498,000 --> 0:13:23,000
"People will laugh at you. This is not good writing!

254
0:13:24.333,000 --> 0:13:25,000
What kind of sentence is this? Look at your handwriting!"

255
0:13:25.883,000 --> 0:13:26,000
It will say a lot of things.

256
0:13:27.46,000 --> 0:13:29,000
You have to run fast so the devil can't catch up.

257
0:13:29.964,000 --> 0:13:33,000
The really good writing I've seen in my class

258
0:13:34.036,000 --> 0:13:36,000
was not from the assignments with a long deadline,

259
0:13:36.709,000 --> 0:13:39,000
but from the 40- to 60-minute crazy writing students did

260
0:13:40.193,000 --> 0:13:43,000
in front of me with a pencil.

261
0:13:43.595,000 --> 0:13:44,000
The students go into a kind of trance.

262
0:13:45.434,000 --> 0:13:49,000
After 30 or 40 minutes, they write without knowing what they're writing.

263
0:13:49.896,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And in this moment, the nagging devil disappears.

264
0:13:52.861,000 --> 0:13:53,000
So I can say this:

265
0:13:54.57,000 --> 0:13:58,000
It's not the hundreds of reasons why one can't be an artist,

266
0:13:58.585,000 --> 0:14:02,000
but rather, the one reason one must be that makes us artists.

267
0:14:02.835,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Why we cannot be something is not important.

268
0:14:04.544,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Most artists became artists because of the one reason.

269
0:14:07.694,000 --> 0:14:1,000
When we put the devil in our heart to sleep and start our own art,

270
0:14:11.364,000 --> 0:14:13,000
enemies appear on the outside.

271
0:14:13.698,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Mostly, they have the faces of our parents. (Laughter)

272
0:14:16.554,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Sometimes they look like our spouses,

273
0:14:19.655,000 --> 0:14:2,000
but they are not your parents or spouses.

274
0:14:21.423,000 --> 0:14:23,000
They are devils. Devils.

275
0:14:24.317,000 --> 0:14:25,000
They came to Earth briefly transformed

276
0:14:26.261,000 --> 0:14:29,000
to stop you from being artistic, from becoming artists.

277
0:14:30.207,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And they have a magic question.

278
0:14:32.129,000 --> 0:14:38,000
When we say, "I think I'll try acting. There's a drama school in the community center," or

279
0:14:38.287,000 --> 0:14:42,000
"I'd like to learn Italian songs," they ask, "Oh, yeah? A play? What for?"

280
0:14:42.764,000 --> 0:14:45,000
The magic question is, "What for?"

281
0:14:46.426,000 --> 0:14:49,000
But art is not for anything.

282
0:14:50.138,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Art is the ultimate goal.

283
0:14:52.392,000 --> 0:14:56,000
It saves our souls and makes us live happily.

284
0:14:56.532,000 --> 0:15:01,000
It helps us express ourselves and be happy without the help of alcohol or drugs.

285
0:15:02.038,000 --> 0:15:06,000
So in response to such a pragmatic question,

286
0:15:06.378,000 --> 0:15:08,000
we need to be bold.

287
0:15:08.797,000 --> 0:15:12,000
"Well, just for the fun of it. Sorry for having fun without you,"

288
0:15:13.241,000 --> 0:15:17,000
is what you should say. "I'll just go ahead and do it anyway."

289
0:15:17.266,000 --> 0:15:22,000
The ideal future I imagine is where we all have multiple identities,

290
0:15:22.366,000 --> 0:15:25,000
at least one of which is an artist.

291
0:15:26.147,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Once I was in New York and got in a cab. I took the backseat,

292
0:15:29.316,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and in front of me I saw something related to a play.

293
0:15:33.473,000 --> 0:15:34,000
So I asked the driver, "What is this?"

294
0:15:34.61,000 --> 0:15:38,000
He said it was his profile. "Then what are you?" I asked. "An actor," he said.

295
0:15:38.655,000 --> 0:15:41,000
He was a cabby and an actor. I asked, "What roles do you usually play?"

296
0:15:42.078,000 --> 0:15:44,000
He proudly said he played King Lear.

297
0:15:44.104,000 --> 0:15:45,000
King Lear.

298
0:15:45.549,000 --> 0:15:46,000
"Who is it that can tell me who I am?" -- a great line from King Lear.

299
0:15:47.175,000 --> 0:15:5,000
That's the world I dream of.

300
0:15:50.566,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Someone is a golfer by day and writer by night.

301
0:15:54.501,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Or a cabby and an actor, a banker and a painter,

302
0:15:57.02,000 --> 0:16:02,000
secretly or publicly performing their own arts.

In 1990, Martha Graham, the legend of modern dance, came to Korea.

304
0:16:07.467,000 --> 0:16:12,000
The great artist, then in her 90s, arrived at Gimpo Airport

305
0:16:13.239,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and a reporter asked her a typical question:

306
0:16:16.304,000 --> 0:16:18,000
"What do you have to do to become a great dancer?

307
0:16:18.911,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Any advice for aspiring Korean dancers?"

308
0:16:21.491,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Now, she was the master. This photo was taken in 1948 and she was already a celebrated artist.

309
0:16:26.486,000 --> 0:16:28,000
In 1990, she was asked this question.

310
0:16:28.677,000 --> 0:16:3,000
And here's what she answered:

311
0:16:31.361,000 --> 0:16:34,000
"Just do it."

312
0:16:35.278,000 --> 0:16:36,000
Wow. I was touched.

313
0:16:36.796,000 --> 0:16:4,000
Only those three words and she left the airport. That's it.

314
0:16:40.888,000 --> 0:16:43,000
So what should we do now?

315
0:16:44.119,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Let's be artists, right now. Right away. How?

316
0:16:47.845,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Just do it!

317
0:16:48.837,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Thank you.

318
0:16:50.451,000 --> 0:16:51,000
(Applause)

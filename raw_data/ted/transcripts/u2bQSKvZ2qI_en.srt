1
0:00:14.888,000 --> 0:00:2,000
So, I have a background in technology and magic.

2
0:00:22.402,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And magicians are interesting.

3
0:00:24.58,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Their illusions accomplish what technology cannot.

4
0:00:29.674,000 --> 0:00:32,000
But what happens when the technology of the day

5
0:00:33.501,000 --> 0:00:35,000
seems almost magical?

6
0:00:37.103,000 --> 0:00:4,000
What happens when you can do this?

7
0:00:41.294,000 --> 0:00:43,000
(Music)

8
0:00:58.829,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Now, 100 years ago,

9
0:01:00.632,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that would have been the magic of levitation.

10
0:01:03.234,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Is it possible to create illusions

11
0:01:06.013,000 --> 0:01:11,000
in a world where technology makes anything possible?

12
0:01:11.724,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Jump!

13
0:01:12.911,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Now, if you know how the trick is done,

14
0:01:15.322,000 --> 0:01:16,000
where is the illusion?

15
0:01:16.942,000 --> 0:01:21,000
But still, our imagination is more powerful than our reasoning,

16
0:01:22.471,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and it's easy to attribute personality to machines.

17
0:01:28.204,000 --> 0:01:3,000
These are quadcopters.

18
0:01:30.654,000 --> 0:01:33,000
But they are more than mechanical flying machines.

19
0:01:34.888,000 --> 0:01:36,000
They analyze the environment around them

20
0:01:37.12,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and react to everything I do.

21
0:01:41.415,000 --> 0:01:47,000
At once, algorithms allow these autonomous machines to fly in close formation,

22
0:01:47.969,000 --> 0:01:48,000
aware of each other

23
0:01:49.754,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and aware of me --

24
0:01:51.373,000 --> 0:01:54,000
mathematics that can be mistaken for intelligence,

25
0:01:55.021,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and intelligence for personality.

26
0:01:59.512,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Anthropomorphism: that's the illusion,

27
0:02:02.179,000 --> 0:02:05,000
an illusion created by technology

28
0:02:05.258,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and embroidered by our imagination

29
0:02:10.202,000 --> 0:02:14,000
to become an intelligent flying robot,

30
0:02:15.043,000 --> 0:02:18,000
a machine that appears to be alive.

31
0:02:19.056,000 --> 0:02:23,000
(Music plays "Close Encounters of the Third Kind")

32
0:02:26.655,000 --> 0:02:27,000
(Quadcopters make tones)

33
0:02:28.454,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I think they say, "Hello."

34
0:02:30.08,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Hey guys! Come on.

35
0:02:33.135,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And time to land.

36
0:02:37.253,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And that's it.

37
0:02:38.445,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Thank you.

38
0:02:39.72,000 --> 0:02:41,000
(Applause)

39
0:02:44.775,000 --> 0:02:48,000
OK, guys, time to go home.

40
0:02:49.431,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Everybody in here.

41
0:02:50.972,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Come on, everybody, quickly, quickly.

42
0:02:54.652,000 --> 0:02:57,000
No pushing, everybody can fit.

43
0:02:57.856,000 --> 0:03:,000
There you go, a little bit to the left, a little bit to the right.

44
0:03:01.154,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Come on, everybody, everybody,

45
0:03:03.563,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and ... good job!

46
0:03:05.737,000 --> 0:03:06,000
(Cheers)

47
0:03:07.363,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Thank you.

48
0:03:08.558,000 --> 0:03:1,000
(Applause)

49
0:03:13.779,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Thank you.

50
0:03:14.969,000 --> 0:03:16,000
(Applause)

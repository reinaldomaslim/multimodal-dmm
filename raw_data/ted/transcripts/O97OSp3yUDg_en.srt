1
0:00:13.127,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Most of you will know

2
0:00:15.317,000 --> 0:00:19,000
about the challenges faced by my beloved continent, Africa.

3
0:00:20.635,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Too many people are poor.

4
0:00:23.149,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Millions of girls don't have access to school.

5
0:00:26.085,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And there aren't enough jobs for the rapidly growing population.

6
0:00:31.434,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Every day,

7
0:00:32.695,000 --> 0:00:36,000
33,000 new young people join the search for employment.

8
0:00:37.419,000 --> 0:00:4,000
That's 12 million for three million formal jobs.

9
0:00:41.482,000 --> 0:00:42,000
In sub-Saharan Africa,

10
0:00:42.982,000 --> 0:00:47,000
less than one in four young people are likely to get waged or salaried work.

11
0:00:49.022,000 --> 0:00:51,000
The chances of making a secure living

12
0:00:51.403,000 --> 0:00:54,000
are even slimmer for poor and rural young women.

13
0:00:55.506,000 --> 0:00:57,000
They cannot afford an education.

14
0:00:57.696,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And they do not have the same access to wages, loans or land

15
0:01:02.767,000 --> 0:01:03,000
as men.

16
0:01:04.077,000 --> 0:01:06,000
This leaves entire communities trapped

17
0:01:06.787,000 --> 0:01:1,000
in a vicious cycle of poverty, inequality and hopelessness.

18
0:01:11.922,000 --> 0:01:14,000
But I'm not here to narrate the doom and gloom,

19
0:01:15.74,000 --> 0:01:17,000
because we also know that a youthful population

20
0:01:18.577,000 --> 0:01:21,000
presents an opportunity to kick-start economic growth

21
0:01:22.292,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and solve global challenges.

22
0:01:24.331,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And in fact,

23
0:01:25.506,000 --> 0:01:3,000
there is a growing movement in Africa, of educated young women,

24
0:01:30.879,000 --> 0:01:33,000
who are stepping up and using the power of their network

25
0:01:34.789,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and a tool we call social interest

26
0:01:37.464,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to uplift communities.

27
0:01:39.804,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I'm one of the leaders of the organization behind this movement.

28
0:01:44.693,000 --> 0:01:47,000
An organization that also supported me through school.

29
0:01:48.648,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And I have seen social interest multiply the impact of our work.

30
0:01:55.363,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Social interest is a way to pay back interest on a loan

31
0:02:00.14,000 --> 0:02:02,000
through service, rather than dollars.

32
0:02:02.672,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Sharing time and knowledge through mentoring,

33
0:02:05.259,000 --> 0:02:06,000
academic support,

34
0:02:06.942,000 --> 0:02:08,000
business training to others in need.

35
0:02:09.39,000 --> 0:02:14,000
This means the impact of a loan is felt not by one, but by many.

36
0:02:16.072,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Through this system,

37
0:02:17.248,000 --> 0:02:21,000
we've been able to help and send more and more girls to school,

38
0:02:21.543,000 --> 0:02:23,000
support them while they are there,

39
0:02:23.724,000 --> 0:02:24,000
help them start businesses

40
0:02:25.208,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and ultimately, lead in their communities --

41
0:02:28.478,000 --> 0:02:31,000
all while providing funding for the next generation.

42
0:02:32.657,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Social interest can be used

43
0:02:35.014,000 --> 0:02:39,000
to supercharge any movement where the benefits can be paid forward.

44
0:02:40.371,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Let me give you an example.

45
0:02:41.95,000 --> 0:02:43,000
This is Stumai from rural Tanzania.

46
0:02:44.919,000 --> 0:02:47,000
She tragically lost her father when she was just three years old.

47
0:02:48.792,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Leaving a disabled mother to single-handedly raise her

48
0:02:52.868,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and her five siblings.

49
0:02:54.529,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Once Stumai completed primary school,

50
0:02:56.498,000 --> 0:02:57,000
she was about to drop out of school

51
0:02:58.45,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and become one of the 92 percent of girls in sub-Saharan Africa

52
0:03:03.752,000 --> 0:03:04,000
that never finish high school.

53
0:03:05.68,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Instead, she got lucky.

54
0:03:07.609,000 --> 0:03:1,000
She got support from a nonprofit that paid her fees

55
0:03:10.942,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and kept her in school.

56
0:03:12.665,000 --> 0:03:13,000
But upon graduating high school,

57
0:03:14.601,000 --> 0:03:17,000
she faced a daunting challenge of what's next.

58
0:03:18.78,000 --> 0:03:21,000
She knew she had to start her own business to survive.

59
0:03:22.415,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And to help her mother,

60
0:03:23.869,000 --> 0:03:25,000
who had tried so hard to keep her in school

61
0:03:26.875,000 --> 0:03:28,000
by selling her only assets,

62
0:03:28.958,000 --> 0:03:31,000
a stack of corrugated iron sheets she had been saving

63
0:03:32.419,000 --> 0:03:35,000
in the hope of building a better home for her children.

64
0:03:35.974,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Stumai also knew she wouldn’t get a loan from a traditional bank,

65
0:03:39.839,000 --> 0:03:42,000
which generally considers young, rural women like her,

66
0:03:43.339,000 --> 0:03:46,000
without land or assets, unbankable.

67
0:03:47.291,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Through a special group of lending partners,

68
0:03:49.522,000 --> 0:03:53,000
she secured 350 dollars to start a food shop,

69
0:03:53.616,000 --> 0:03:57,000
selling vegetables, oil, rice, tomatoes, onions and beans.

70
0:03:58.633,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Fellow network members helped to train her on basic business skills,

71
0:04:02.331,000 --> 0:04:04,000
like creating a business plan,

72
0:04:04.442,000 --> 0:04:06,000
working out profits, marketing,

73
0:04:06.974,000 --> 0:04:07,000
keeping business records

74
0:04:08.315,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and the value of savings.

75
0:04:10.395,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And the business took off.

76
0:04:12.482,000 --> 0:04:15,000
She repaid the original loan within eight months,

77
0:04:16.021,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and then borrowed 2,000 dollars

78
0:04:18.473,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to start a motorcycle taxi and courier business.

79
0:04:23.18,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Stumai now owns two motorcycles

80
0:04:26.014,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and employs two people.

81
0:04:28.696,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And she has been able to purchase land and build a house,

82
0:04:32.403,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and the business continues to grow

83
0:04:34.458,000 --> 0:04:36,000
from strength to strength.

84
0:04:37.403,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Stumai repaid her interest in social interest.

85
0:04:42.173,000 --> 0:04:43,000
She paid social interest

86
0:04:43.879,000 --> 0:04:46,000
by providing mentoring to girls in a local high school.

87
0:04:48.466,000 --> 0:04:51,000
She volunteered weekly as a learner guide,

88
0:04:51.902,000 --> 0:04:54,000
delivering a life skills and well-being curriculum

89
0:04:55.022,000 --> 0:04:59,000
that helps children gain the confidence to ask questions,

90
0:04:59.133,000 --> 0:05:,000
care for and support each other,

91
0:05:01.109,000 --> 0:05:03,000
learn about health and nutrition,

92
0:05:03.363,000 --> 0:05:05,000
set goals and learn how to achieve them.

93
0:05:06.191,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Stumai says her greatest reward is witnessing the girls she mentors

94
0:05:12.12,000 --> 0:05:14,000
start to believe in themselves and succeeding.

95
0:05:15.53,000 --> 0:05:18,000
These days, Stumai also trains other learner guides.

96
0:05:19.109,000 --> 0:05:22,000
That's multiplying the number of girls making it through school

97
0:05:23.093,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and into secure livelihoods like she did.

98
0:05:26.784,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Through her business profits, she has been able to support her siblings,

99
0:05:30.292,000 --> 0:05:33,000
three nieces and nephews and other children in her community

100
0:05:33.657,000 --> 0:05:34,000
to go to school.

101
0:05:34.879,000 --> 0:05:37,000
She also regularly supports other network members.

102
0:05:38.165,000 --> 0:05:39,000
For example,

103
0:05:39.522,000 --> 0:05:42,000
a young woman studying for a diploma in community development.

104
0:05:43.911,000 --> 0:05:44,000
In the past two years,

105
0:05:45.546,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Stumai helped her with money for bus fare,

106
0:05:48.633,000 --> 0:05:5,000
for sanitary pads, for soap

107
0:05:50.863,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and encouraged her to keep going.

108
0:05:55.03,000 --> 0:06:,000
Stumai spends 370 dollars a year supporting the education of others.

109
0:06:01.831,000 --> 0:06:07,000
That's 17 percent of her gross earnings from her motorcycle business.

110
0:06:09.149,000 --> 0:06:12,000
This is the power of social interest.

111
0:06:12.688,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Stumai's example shows that if you help one girl,

112
0:06:17.68,000 --> 0:06:18,000
not only to go to school,

113
0:06:19.482,000 --> 0:06:21,000
but graduate and start a business,

114
0:06:21.8,000 --> 0:06:24,000
she can in turn make a giant difference

115
0:06:24.903,000 --> 0:06:26,000
in the lives of others and her community.

116
0:06:28.047,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Had Stumai paid back interest on her loan in dollars,

117
0:06:32.158,000 --> 0:06:36,000
her success might have been felt by her and her immediate family,

118
0:06:36.381,000 --> 0:06:39,000
but because she paid interest as social interest,

119
0:06:39.682,000 --> 0:06:42,000
the impact was felt by her mentees,

120
0:06:42.777,000 --> 0:06:44,000
her nieces, nephews, her employees

121
0:06:45.412,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and so many others around her.

122
0:06:48.19,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Stumai is just one example of many.

123
0:06:52.235,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Today, we have 7,000 learner guides like Stumai,

124
0:06:57.252,000 --> 0:06:58,000
working across Malawi,

125
0:06:59.19,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Tanzania, Ghana, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

126
0:07:02.643,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And collectively,

127
0:07:04.246,000 --> 0:07:06,000
they've helped children do better in school.

128
0:07:07.579,000 --> 0:07:11,000
The girls we work with are nearly three times less likely

129
0:07:12.192,000 --> 0:07:13,000
to drop out of school,

130
0:07:13.549,000 --> 0:07:16,000
because learner guides make home visits when girls fail to attend school

131
0:07:17.352,000 --> 0:07:18,000
to help them back on track.

132
0:07:19.089,000 --> 0:07:22,000
They also work with communities and district governments

133
0:07:22.722,000 --> 0:07:25,000
to address the challenges children face,

134
0:07:25.818,000 --> 0:07:28,000
including preventing or annulling child marriages,

135
0:07:29.556,000 --> 0:07:32,000
connecting children facing hunger or hardship at home

136
0:07:33.044,000 --> 0:07:34,000
with local support,

137
0:07:34.496,000 --> 0:07:35,000
or running study groups

138
0:07:35.75,000 --> 0:07:38,000
so that children who might be lagging behind in their studies

139
0:07:39.385,000 --> 0:07:4,000
can get supporters and catch up.

140
0:07:41.75,000 --> 0:07:45,000
They act as trusted sisters, friends and guardians.

141
0:07:47.299,000 --> 0:07:51,000
So far, nearly 6,300 network members

142
0:07:51.703,000 --> 0:07:54,000
have borrowed close to three million dollars,

143
0:07:55.204,000 --> 0:08:01,000
with a repayment rate of those loans at consistently above 95 percent.

144
0:08:03.196,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And our 140,000 members,

145
0:08:06.466,000 --> 0:08:09,000
they have invested their own resources

146
0:08:09.688,000 --> 0:08:1,000
to support and send

147
0:08:11.538,000 --> 0:08:16,000
over 937,000 children to primary and secondary school.

148
0:08:17.744,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Every young woman we work with

149
0:08:19.871,000 --> 0:08:22,000
supports, on average, another three children

150
0:08:23.228,000 --> 0:08:25,000
outside of her immediate family

151
0:08:25.673,000 --> 0:08:26,000
to go to school.

152
0:08:26.903,000 --> 0:08:29,000
All without additional money from us.

153
0:08:30.911,000 --> 0:08:33,000
We are building a powerful force.

154
0:08:34.488,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Gaining ever greater momentum

155
0:08:37.051,000 --> 0:08:4,000
as we open the door for more and more girls

156
0:08:40.441,000 --> 0:08:41,000
to go to school,

157
0:08:41.63,000 --> 0:08:44,000
succeed, lead and in turn, support thousands more.

158
0:08:46.408,000 --> 0:08:47,000
This system,

159
0:08:47.595,000 --> 0:08:5,000
supporting those once excluded to transform their lives

160
0:08:51.4,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and then step up for others,

161
0:08:53.289,000 --> 0:08:55,000
can work for more than girls' education.

162
0:08:56.548,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Of course, you need to get your money back if you lend it.

163
0:09:00.548,000 --> 0:09:03,000
But instead of demanding interest in dollars,

164
0:09:04.365,000 --> 0:09:06,000
can you consider using social interest instead?

165
0:09:07.874,000 --> 0:09:08,000
For example,

166
0:09:09.763,000 --> 0:09:1,000
could young people

167
0:09:11.612,000 --> 0:09:14,000
pass on the skills they learned in training colleges?

168
0:09:15.517,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Like Michelle,

169
0:09:17.212,000 --> 0:09:19,000
who teaches brickmaking in rural Zimbabwe.

170
0:09:20.173,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Or Louisa,

171
0:09:21.347,000 --> 0:09:24,000
who is training others on climate-smart agriculture

172
0:09:24.45,000 --> 0:09:25,000
in Malawi.

173
0:09:25.754,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Or Fatima in Ghana,

174
0:09:27.444,000 --> 0:09:29,000
who is training women to help deliver babies

175
0:09:30.27,000 --> 0:09:31,000
where expectant mothers

176
0:09:32.064,000 --> 0:09:35,000
might not be able to make it to the local hospital on time.

177
0:09:36.338,000 --> 0:09:37,000
When I was growing up,

178
0:09:37.863,000 --> 0:09:4,000
an elder in my village in rural Zimbabwe

179
0:09:40.998,000 --> 0:09:43,000
once described the challenges I faced in going to school.

180
0:09:44.815,000 --> 0:09:45,000
She said,

181
0:09:47.521,000 --> 0:09:5,000
"Those who harvest many pumpkins

182
0:09:50.582,000 --> 0:09:53,000
often do not have the clay pots to cook them in."

183
0:09:54.971,000 --> 0:09:55,000
(Laughter)

184
0:09:56.482,000 --> 0:09:58,000
What she meant was that,

185
0:09:58.681,000 --> 0:10:04,000
although I got the best possible results in my exams

186
0:10:05.293,000 --> 0:10:07,000
when I finished elementary school,

187
0:10:07.569,000 --> 0:10:09,000
my talent was of no value

188
0:10:10.061,000 --> 0:10:14,000
if my family could not afford to pay for me to continue my education.

189
0:10:15.412,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Well, with this system,

190
0:10:17.507,000 --> 0:10:19,000
we are not just providing pots,

191
0:10:19.753,000 --> 0:10:22,000
or making a single meal out of the pumpkins.

192
0:10:23.428,000 --> 0:10:24,000
After all,

193
0:10:24.982,000 --> 0:10:26,000
there are hundreds of seeds in a single pumpkin.

194
0:10:27.958,000 --> 0:10:28,000
We are saving the seeds,

195
0:10:29.911,000 --> 0:10:3,000
planting them

196
0:10:31.1,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and nurturing every one of them.

197
0:10:34.308,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And the result?

198
0:10:36.482,000 --> 0:10:4,000
A virtual cycle of prosperity,

199
0:10:40.57,000 --> 0:10:42,000
equality and hope,

200
0:10:42.887,000 --> 0:10:43,000
led by young women.

201
0:10:44.617,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Because together,

202
0:10:46.061,000 --> 0:10:48,000
we are shaking up the world.

203
0:10:48.8,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Pamoja tunaweza --

204
0:10:50.673,000 --> 0:10:53,000
that's Swahili for my network motto: "Together we can!"

205
0:10:54.387,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Thank you.

206
0:10:55.563,000 --> 0:11:01,000
(Applause)

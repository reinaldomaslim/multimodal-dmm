1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I got my start

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
in writing and research

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
as a surgical trainee,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
as someone who was a long ways away

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
from becoming any kind of an expert at anything.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
So the natural question you ask then at that point

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
is, how do I get good at what I'm trying to do?

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And it became a question of,

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
how do we all get good

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
at what we're trying to do?

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
It's hard enough to learn to get the skills,

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
try to learn all the material you have to absorb

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
at any task you're taking on.

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I had to think about how I sew and how I cut,

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
but then also how I pick the right person

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
to come to an operating room.

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And then in the midst of all this

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
came this new context

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
for thinking about what it meant to be good.

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
In the last few years

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
we realized we were in the deepest crisis

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
of medicine's existence

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
due to something you don't normally think about

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
when you're a doctor

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
concerned with how you do good for people,

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
which is the cost

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
of health care.

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
There's not a country in the world

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that now is not asking

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
whether we can afford what doctors do.

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
The political fight that we've developed

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
has become one around

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
whether it's the government that's the problem

34
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
or is it insurance companies that are the problem.

35
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And the answer is yes and no;

36
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
it's deeper than all of that.

37
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
The cause of our troubles

38
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
is actually the complexity that science has given us.

39
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And in order to understand this,

40
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I'm going to take you back a couple of generations.

41
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
I want to take you back

42
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
to a time when Lewis Thomas was writing in his book, "The Youngest Science."

43
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Lewis Thomas was a physician-writer,

44
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
one of my favorite writers.

45
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And he wrote this book to explain, among other things,

46
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
what it was like to be a medical intern

47
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
at the Boston City Hospital

48
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
in the pre-penicillin year

49
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
of 1937.

50
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
It was a time when medicine was cheap

51
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and very ineffective.

52
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
If you were in a hospital, he said,

53
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
it was going to do you good

54
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
only because it offered you

55
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
some warmth, some food, shelter,

56
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and maybe the caring attention

57
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
of a nurse.

58
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Doctors and medicine

59
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
made no difference at all.

60
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
That didn't seem to prevent the doctors

61
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
from being frantically busy in their days,

62
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
as he explained.

63
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
What they were trying to do

64
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
was figure out whether you might have one of the diagnoses

65
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
for which they could do something.

66
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And there were a few.

67
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
You might have a lobar pneumonia, for example,

68
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and they could give you an antiserum,

69
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
an injection of rabid antibodies

70
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
to the bacterium streptococcus,

71
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
if the intern sub-typed it correctly.

72
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
If you had an acute congestive heart failure,

73
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
they could bleed a pint of blood from you

74
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
by opening up an arm vein,

75
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
giving you a crude leaf preparation of digitalis

76
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and then giving you oxygen by tent.

77
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
If you had early signs of paralysis

78
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and you were really good at asking personal questions,

79
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
you might figure out

80
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
that this paralysis someone has is from syphilis,

81
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
in which case you could give this nice concoction

82
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
of mercury and arsenic --

83
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
as long as you didn't overdose them and kill them.

84
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Beyond these sorts of things,

85
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
a medical doctor didn't have a lot that they could do.

86
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
This was when the core structure of medicine

87
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
was created --

88
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
what it meant to be good at what we did

89
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and how we wanted to build medicine to be.

90
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
It was at a time

91
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
when what was known you could know,

92
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
you could hold it all in your head, and you could do it all.

93
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
If you had a prescription pad,

94
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
if you had a nurse,

95
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
if you had a hospital

96
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that would give you a place to convalesce, maybe some basic tools,

97
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
you really could do it all.

98
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
You set the fracture, you drew the blood,

99
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
you spun the blood,

100
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
looked at it under the microscope,

101
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
you plated the culture, you injected the antiserum.

102
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
This was a life as a craftsman.

103
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
As a result, we built it around

104
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
a culture and set of values

105
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
that said what you were good at

106
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
was being daring,

107
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
at being courageous,

108
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
at being independent and self-sufficient.

109
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Autonomy was our highest value.

110
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Go a couple generations forward

111
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
to where we are, though,

112
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and it looks like a completely different world.

113
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
We have now found treatments

114
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
for nearly all of the tens of thousands of conditions

115
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
that a human being can have.

116
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
We can't cure it all.

117
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
We can't guarantee that everybody will live a long and healthy life.

118
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But we can make it possible

119
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
for most.

120
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
But what does it take?

121
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Well, we've now discovered

122
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
4,000 medical and surgical procedures.

123
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
We've discovered 6,000 drugs

124
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
that I'm now licensed to prescribe.

125
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And we're trying to deploy this capability,

126
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
town by town,

127
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
to every person alive --

128
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
in our own country,

129
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
let alone around the world.

130
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And we've reached the point where we've realized,

131
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
as doctors,

132
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
we can't know it all.

133
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
We can't do it all

134
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
by ourselves.

135
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
There was a study where they looked

136
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
at how many clinicians it took to take care of you

137
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
if you came into a hospital,

138
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
as it changed over time.

139
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And in the year 1970,

140
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
it took just over two full-time equivalents of clinicians.

141
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
That is to say,

142
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
it took basically the nursing time

143
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and then just a little bit of time for a doctor

144
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
who more or less checked in on you

145
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
once a day.

146
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
By the end of the 20th century,

147
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
it had become more than 15 clinicians

148
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
for the same typical hospital patient --

149
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
specialists, physical therapists,

150
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
the nurses.

151
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
We're all specialists now,

152
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
even the primary care physicians.

153
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
Everyone just has

154
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
a piece of the care.

155
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
But holding onto that structure we built

156
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
around the daring, independence,

157
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
self-sufficiency

158
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
of each of those people

159
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
has become a disaster.

160
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
We have trained, hired and rewarded people

161
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
to be cowboys.

162
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
But it's pit crews that we need,

163
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
pit crews for patients.

164
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
There's evidence all around us:

165
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
40 percent of our coronary artery disease patients

166
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
in our communities

167
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
receive incomplete or inappropriate care.

168
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
60 percent

169
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
of our asthma, stroke patients

170
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
receive incomplete or inappropriate care.

171
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Two million people come into hospitals

172
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and pick up an infection

173
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
they didn't have

174
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
because someone failed to follow

175
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
the basic practices of hygiene.

176
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Our experience

177
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
as people who get sick,

178
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
need help from other people,

179
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
is that we have amazing clinicians

180
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that we can turn to --

181
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
hardworking, incredibly well-trained and very smart --

182
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that we have access to incredible technologies

183
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that give us great hope,

184
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
but little sense

185
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
that it consistently all comes together for you

186
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
from start to finish

187
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
in a successful way.

188
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
There's another sign

189
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
that we need pit crews,

190
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and that's the unmanageable cost

191
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
of our care.

192
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Now we in medicine, I think,

193
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
are baffled by this question of cost.

194
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
We want to say, "This is just the way it is.

195
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
This is just what medicine requires."

196
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
When you go from a world

197
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
where you treated arthritis with aspirin,

198
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
that mostly didn't do the job,

199
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
to one where, if it gets bad enough,

200
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
we can do a hip replacement, a knee replacement

201
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
that gives you years, maybe decades,

202
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
without disability,

203
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
a dramatic change,

204
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
well is it any surprise

205
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
that that $40,000 hip replacement

206
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
replacing the 10-cent aspirin

207
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
is more expensive?

208
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
It's just the way it is.

209
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
But I think we're ignoring certain facts

210
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
that tell us something about what we can do.

211
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
As we've looked at the data

212
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
about the results that have come

213
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
as the complexity has increased,

214
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
we found

215
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
that the most expensive care

216
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
is not necessarily the best care.

217
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And vice versa,

218
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
the best care

219
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
often turns out to be the least expensive --

220
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
has fewer complications,

221
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
the people get more efficient at what they do.

222
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And what that means

223
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
is there's hope.

224
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Because [if] to have the best results,

225
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
you really needed the most expensive care

226
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
in the country, or in the world,

227
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
well then we really would be talking about rationing

228
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
who we're going to cut off from Medicare.

229
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
That would be really our only choice.

230
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
But when we look at the positive deviants --

231
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
the ones who are getting the best results

232
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
at the lowest costs --

233
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
we find the ones that look the most like systems

234
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
are the most successful.

235
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
That is to say, they found ways

236
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
to get all of the different pieces,

237
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
all of the different components,

238
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
to come together into a whole.

239
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Having great components is not enough,

240
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and yet we've been obsessed in medicine with components.

241
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
We want the best drugs, the best technologies,

242
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
the best specialists,

243
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
but we don't think too much

244
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
about how it all comes together.

245
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
It's a terrible design strategy actually.

246
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
There's a famous thought experiment

247
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
that touches exactly on this

248
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
that said, what if you built a car

249
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
from the very best car parts?

250
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Well it would lead you to put in Porsche brakes,

251
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
a Ferrari engine,

252
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
a Volvo body, a BMW chassis.

253
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And you put it all together and what do you get?

254
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
A very expensive pile of junk that does not go anywhere.

255
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And that is what medicine can feel like sometimes.

256
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
It's not a system.

257
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Now a system, however,

258
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
when things start to come together,

259
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
you realize it has certain skills

260
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
for acting and looking that way.

261
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Skill number one

262
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
is the ability to recognize success

263
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and the ability to recognize failure.

264
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
When you are a specialist,

265
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
you can't see the end result very well.

266
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
You have to become really interested in data,

267
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
unsexy as that sounds.

268
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
One of my colleagues is a surgeon in Cedar Rapids, Iowa,

269
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and he got interested in the question of,

270
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
well how many CT scans did they do

271
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
for their community in Cedar Rapids?

272
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
He got interested in this

273
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
because there had been government reports,

274
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
newspaper reports, journal articles

275
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
saying that there had been too many CT scans done.

276
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
He didn't see it in his own patients.

277
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And so he asked the question, "How many did we do?"

278
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and he wanted to get the data.

279
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
It took him three months.

280
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
No one had asked this question in his community before.

281
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And what he found was that,

282
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
for the 300,000 people in their community,

283
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
in the previous year

284
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
they had done 52,000 CT scans.

285
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
They had found a problem.

286
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Which brings us to skill number two a system has.

287
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Skill one, find where your failures are.

288
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Skill two is devise solutions.

289
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
I got interested in this

290
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
when the World Health Organization came to my team

291
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
asking if we could help with a project

292
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
to reduce deaths in surgery.

293
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
The volume of surgery had spread

294
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
around the world,

295
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
but the safety of surgery

296
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
had not.

297
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Now our usual tactics for tackling problems like these

298
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
are to do more training,

299
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
give people more specialization

300
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
or bring in more technology.

301
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Well in surgery, you couldn't have people who are more specialized

302
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and you couldn't have people who are better trained.

303
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And yet we see unconscionable levels

304
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
of death, disability

305
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
that could be avoided.

306
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And so we looked at what other high-risk industries do.

307
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
We looked at skyscraper construction,

308
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
we looked at the aviation world,

309
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and we found

310
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
that they have technology, they have training,

311
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and then they have one other thing:

312
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
They have checklists.

313
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
I did not expect

314
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
to be spending a significant part

315
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
of my time as a Harvard surgeon

316
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
worrying about checklists.

317
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
And yet, what we found

318
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
were that these were tools

319
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
to help make experts better.

320
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
We got the lead safety engineer for Boeing to help us.

321
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Could we design a checklist for surgery?

322
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Not for the lowest people on the totem pole,

323
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
but for the folks

324
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
who were all the way around the chain,

325
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
the entire team including the surgeons.

326
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
And what they taught us

327
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
was that designing a checklist

328
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
to help people handle complexity

329
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
actually involves more difficulty than I had understood.

330
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
You have to think about things

331
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
like pause points.

332
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
You need to identify the moments in a process

333
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
when you can actually catch a problem before it's a danger

334
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and do something about it.

335
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
You have to identify

336
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
that this is a before-takeoff checklist.

337
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
And then you need to focus on the killer items.

338
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
An aviation checklist,

339
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
like this one for a single-engine plane,

340
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
isn't a recipe for how to fly a plane,

341
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
it's a reminder of the key things

342
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
that get forgotten or missed

343
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
if they're not checked.

344
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
So we did this.

345
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
We created a 19-item two-minute checklist

346
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
for surgical teams.

347
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
We had the pause points

348
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
immediately before anesthesia is given,

349
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
immediately before the knife hits the skin,

350
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
immediately before the patient leaves the room.

351
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And we had a mix of dumb stuff on there --

352
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
making sure an antibiotic is given in the right time frame

353
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
because that cuts the infection rate by half --

354
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and then interesting stuff,

355
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
because you can't make a recipe for something as complicated as surgery.

356
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Instead, you can make a recipe

357
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
for how to have a team that's prepared for the unexpected.

358
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
And we had items like making sure everyone in the room

359
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
had introduced themselves by name at the start of the day,

360
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
because you get half a dozen people or more

361
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
who are sometimes coming together as a team

362
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
for the very first time that day that you're coming in.

363
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
We implemented this checklist

364
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
in eight hospitals around the world,

365
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
deliberately in places from rural Tanzania

366
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
to the University of Washington in Seattle.

367
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
We found that after they adopted it

368
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
the complication rates fell

369
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
35 percent.

370
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
It fell in every hospital it went into.

371
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
The death rates fell

372
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
47 percent.

373
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
This was bigger than a drug.

374
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
(Applause)

375
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
And that brings us

376
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
to skill number three,

377
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
the ability to implement this,

378
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
to get colleagues across the entire chain

379
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
to actually do these things.

380
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
And it's been slow to spread.

381
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
This is not yet our norm in surgery --

382
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
let alone making checklists

383
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
to go onto childbirth and other areas.

384
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
There's a deep resistance

385
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
because using these tools

386
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
forces us to confront

387
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
that we're not a system,

388
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
forces us to behave with a different set of values.

389
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
Just using a checklist

390
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
requires you to embrace different values from the ones we've had,

391
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
like humility,

392
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
discipline,

393
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
teamwork.

394
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
This is the opposite of what we were built on:

395
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
independence, self-sufficiency,

396
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
autonomy.

397
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
I met an actual cowboy, by the way.

398
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
I asked him, what was it like

399
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
to actually herd a thousand cattle

400
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
across hundreds of miles?

401
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
How did you do that?

402
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
And he said, "We have the cowboys stationed at distinct places all around."

403
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
They communicate electronically constantly,

404
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
and they have protocols and checklists

405
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
for how they handle everything --

406
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
(Laughter)

407
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
-- from bad weather

408
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
to emergencies or inoculations for the cattle.

409
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
Even the cowboys are pit crews now.

410
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
And it seemed like time

411
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
that we become that way ourselves.

412
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
Making systems work

413
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:17,000
is the great task of my generation

414
0:18:17.26,000 --> 0:18:19,000
of physicians and scientists.

415
0:18:19.26,000 --> 0:18:21,000
But I would go further and say

416
0:18:21.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
that making systems work,

417
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
whether in health care, education,

418
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:27,000
climate change,

419
0:18:27.26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
making a pathway out of poverty,

420
0:18:29.26,000 --> 0:18:33,000
is the great task of our generation as a whole.

421
0:18:33.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
In every field, knowledge has exploded,

422
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
but it has brought complexity,

423
0:18:38.26,000 --> 0:18:41,000
it has brought specialization.

424
0:18:41.26,000 --> 0:18:43,000
And we've come to a place where we have no choice

425
0:18:43.26,000 --> 0:18:45,000
but to recognize,

426
0:18:45.26,000 --> 0:18:48,000
as individualistic as we want to be,

427
0:18:48.26,000 --> 0:18:51,000
complexity requires

428
0:18:51.26,000 --> 0:18:53,000
group success.

429
0:18:53.26,000 --> 0:18:57,000
We all need to be pit crews now.

430
0:18:57.26,000 --> 0:18:59,000
Thank you.

431
0:18:59.26,000 --> 0:19:13,000
(Applause)

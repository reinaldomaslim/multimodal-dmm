1
0:00:12.895,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm an industrial engineer.

2
0:00:14.631,000 --> 0:00:16,000
The goal in my life has always been to make

3
0:00:17.428,000 --> 0:00:18,000
more and more products

4
0:00:18.9,000 --> 0:00:2,000
in the least amount of time and resources.

5
0:00:21.41,000 --> 0:00:22,000
While working at Toyota,

6
0:00:22.91,000 --> 0:00:23,000
all I knew was how to make cars

7
0:00:24.875,000 --> 0:00:26,000
until I met Dr. Akira Miyawaki,

8
0:00:27.328,000 --> 0:00:3,000
who came to our factory to make a forest in it

9
0:00:30.511,000 --> 0:00:32,000
in order to make it carbon-neutral.

10
0:00:33.346,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I was so fascinated

11
0:00:35.22,000 --> 0:00:37,000
that I decided to learn this methodology

12
0:00:37.666,000 --> 0:00:39,000
by joining his team as a volunteer.

13
0:00:40.557,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Soon, I started making a forest

14
0:00:42.379,000 --> 0:00:44,000
in the backyard of my own house,

15
0:00:44.843,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and this is how it looks after three years.

16
0:00:48.776,000 --> 0:00:49,000
These forests,

17
0:00:49.91,000 --> 0:00:51,000
compared to a conventional plantation,

18
0:00:51.96,000 --> 0:00:53,000
grow 10 times faster,

19
0:00:54.382,000 --> 0:00:56,000
they're 30 times more dense,

20
0:00:56.969,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and 100 times more biodiverse.

21
0:01:00.94,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Within two years of having this forest in our backyard,

22
0:01:03.8,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I could observe that the groundwater

23
0:01:05.744,000 --> 0:01:06,000
didn't dry during summers,

24
0:01:07.623,000 --> 0:01:09,000
the number of bird species I spotted in this area

25
0:01:10.48,000 --> 0:01:11,000
doubled.

26
0:01:11.65,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Quality of air became better,

27
0:01:13.026,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and we started harvesting seasonal fruits

28
0:01:15.587,000 --> 0:01:16,000
growing effortlessly

29
0:01:17.319,000 --> 0:01:19,000
right in the backyard of our house.

30
0:01:19.93,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I wanted to make more of these forests.

31
0:01:22.247,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I was so moved by these results

32
0:01:23.665,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that I wanted to make these forests

33
0:01:25.689,000 --> 0:01:27,000
with the same acumen with which we make cars

34
0:01:28.479,000 --> 0:01:31,000
or write software or do any mainstream business,

35
0:01:31.899,000 --> 0:01:32,000
so I founded a company

36
0:01:33.743,000 --> 0:01:34,000
which is an end-to-end service provider

37
0:01:35.59,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to create these native natural forests.

38
0:01:38.935,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But to make afforestation as a mainstream business

39
0:01:42.13,000 --> 0:01:44,000
or an industry, we had to standardize

40
0:01:44.289,000 --> 0:01:45,000
the process of forest-making.

41
0:01:46.202,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So we benchmarked the Toyota Production System

42
0:01:48.902,000 --> 0:01:51,000
known for its quality and efficiency

43
0:01:51.916,000 --> 0:01:52,000
for the process of forest-making.

44
0:01:53.849,000 --> 0:01:55,000
For an example, the core of TPS,

45
0:01:56.411,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Toyota Production System, lies in heijunka,

46
0:01:59.751,000 --> 0:02:,000
which is making manufacturing

47
0:02:01.341,000 --> 0:02:03,000
of different models of cars

48
0:02:03.79,000 --> 0:02:05,000
on a single assembly line.

49
0:02:05.881,000 --> 0:02:07,000
We replaced these cars with trees,

50
0:02:08.727,000 --> 0:02:1,000
using which now we can make multi-layered forests.

51
0:02:11.65,000 --> 0:02:14,000
These forests utilize 100 percent vertical space.

52
0:02:15.218,000 --> 0:02:15,000
They are so dense

53
0:02:15.967,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that one can't even walk into them.

54
0:02:19.516,000 --> 0:02:22,000
For an example, we can make a 300-tree forest

55
0:02:22.75,000 --> 0:02:26,000
in an area as small as the parking spaces of six cars.

56
0:02:27.204,000 --> 0:02:31,000
In order to reduce cost and our own carbon footprint,

57
0:02:31.284,000 --> 0:02:32,000
we started utilizing local biomass

58
0:02:33.279,000 --> 0:02:35,000
as soil amender and fertilizers.

59
0:02:36.046,000 --> 0:02:38,000
For example, coconut shells crushed in a machine

60
0:02:38.814,000 --> 0:02:41,000
mixed with rice straw,

61
0:02:42.437,000 --> 0:02:45,000
powder of rice husk mixed with organic manure

62
0:02:46.04,000 --> 0:02:48,000
is finally dumped in soil on which

63
0:02:48.321,000 --> 0:02:49,000
our forest is planted.

64
0:02:49.658,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Once planted, we use grass or rice straw

65
0:02:52.887,000 --> 0:02:53,000
to cover the soil

66
0:02:54.619,000 --> 0:02:56,000
so that all the water which goes into irrigation

67
0:02:57.173,000 --> 0:02:59,000
doesn't get evaporated back into the atmosphere.

68
0:02:59.866,000 --> 0:03:,000
And using these simple improvisations,

69
0:03:01.796,000 --> 0:03:02,000
today we can make a forest

70
0:03:03.495,000 --> 0:03:06,000
for a cost as low as the cost of an iPhone.

71
0:03:07.361,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Today, we are making forests in houses,

72
0:03:09.814,000 --> 0:03:13,000
in schools, even in factories with the corporates.

73
0:03:13.882,000 --> 0:03:14,000
But that's not enough.

74
0:03:15.86,000 --> 0:03:16,000
There is a huge number of people

75
0:03:17.812,000 --> 0:03:19,000
who want to take matters into their own hands.

76
0:03:20.681,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So we let it happen.

77
0:03:22.545,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Today, we are working on an Internet-based platform

78
0:03:26.785,000 --> 0:03:28,000
where we are going to share our methodology

79
0:03:29.362,000 --> 0:03:3,000
on an open source

80
0:03:31.319,000 --> 0:03:32,000
using which anyone and everyone

81
0:03:32.77,000 --> 0:03:33,000
can make their own forest

82
0:03:34.28,000 --> 0:03:36,000
without our physical presence being there,

83
0:03:36.802,000 --> 0:03:37,000
using our methodology.

84
0:03:38.755,000 --> 0:03:39,000
At the click of a button,

85
0:03:40.01,000 --> 0:03:41,000
they can get to know all the native species

86
0:03:41.56,000 --> 0:03:43,000
of their place.

87
0:03:43.778,000 --> 0:03:46,000
By installing a small hardware probe on site,

88
0:03:47.596,000 --> 0:03:49,000
we can do remote soil testing,

89
0:03:50.296,000 --> 0:03:53,000
using which we can give step-by-step instructions

90
0:03:54.101,000 --> 0:03:56,000
on forest-making remotely.

91
0:03:57.005,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Also we can monitor the growth of this forest

92
0:03:59.917,000 --> 0:04:02,000
without being on site.

93
0:04:03.566,000 --> 0:04:04,000
This methodology, I believe,

94
0:04:05.117,000 --> 0:04:06,000
has a potential.

95
0:04:06.862,000 --> 0:04:08,000
By sharing, we can actually bring back our native forests.

96
0:04:09.695,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Now, when you go back home,

97
0:04:11.342,000 --> 0:04:12,000
if you see a barren piece of land,

98
0:04:13.045,000 --> 0:04:16,000
do remember that it can be a potential forest.

99
0:04:16.638,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Thank you very much. Thanks.

100
0:04:18.828,000 --> 0:04:2,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So, I don't like to boast,

2
0:00:15.719,000 --> 0:00:2,000
but I am very good at finding things to be annoyed about.

3
0:00:21.28,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It is a real specialty of mine.

4
0:00:23.4,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I can hear 100 compliments and a single insult,

5
0:00:27.32,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and what do I remember?

6
0:00:28.84,000 --> 0:00:29,000
The insult.

7
0:00:30.24,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And according to the research, I'm not alone.

8
0:00:32.96,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Unfortunately, the human brain is wired to focus on the negative.

9
0:00:38.52,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Now, this might have been helpful when we were cave people,

10
0:00:41.88,000 --> 0:00:42,000
trying to avoid predators,

11
0:00:43.76,000 --> 0:00:45,000
but now it's a terrible way to go through life.

12
0:00:46.48,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It is a real major component of anxiety and depression.

13
0:00:52.96,000 --> 0:00:56,000
So how can we fight the brain's negative bias?

14
0:00:57.04,000 --> 0:01:02,000
According to a lot of research, one of the best weapons is gratitude.

15
0:01:03.08,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So knowing this, I started a new tradition in our house a couple of years ago.

16
0:01:08.12,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Before a meal with my wife and kids,

17
0:01:10.6,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I would say a prayer of thanksgiving.

18
0:01:14.56,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Prayer is not quite the right word.

19
0:01:16.4,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I'm agnostic, so instead of thanking God,

20
0:01:21.12,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I would thank some of the people who helped make my food a reality.

21
0:01:25.48,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I'd say, "I'd like to thank the farmer who grew these tomatoes,

22
0:01:29.84,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and the trucker who drove these tomatoes to the store,

23
0:01:32.56,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and the cashier who rang these tomatoes up."

24
0:01:35.44,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And I thought it was going pretty well, this tradition.

25
0:01:39.04,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Then one day, my 10-year-old son said,

26
0:01:41.6,000 --> 0:01:44,000
"You know, Dad, those people aren't in our apartment.

27
0:01:44.96,000 --> 0:01:45,000
They can't hear you.

28
0:01:46.2,000 --> 0:01:5,000
If you really cared, you would go and thank them in person."

29
0:01:50.28,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And I thought, "Hmm. That's an interesting idea."

30
0:01:53.48,000 --> 0:01:54,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:54.8,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Now I'm a writer, and for my books I like to go on adventures.

32
0:01:59.88,000 --> 0:02:,000
Go on quests.

33
0:02:01.32,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So I decided I'm going to take my son up on his challenge.

34
0:02:05.4,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It seemed simple enough.

35
0:02:07.12,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And to make it even simpler,

36
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I decided to focus on just one item.

37
0:02:12.52,000 --> 0:02:13,000
An item I can't live without:

38
0:02:14.36,000 --> 0:02:15,000
my morning cup of coffee.

39
0:02:16.84,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Well, it turned out to be not so simple at all.

40
0:02:20.08,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:21.12,000 --> 0:02:22,000
This quest took me months.

42
0:02:22.759,000 --> 0:02:24,000
It took me around the world.

43
0:02:25.24,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Because I discovered that my coffee would not be possible

44
0:02:30.72,000 --> 0:02:33,000
without hundreds of people I take for granted.

45
0:02:33.8,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So I would thank the trucker

46
0:02:35.72,000 --> 0:02:37,000
who drove the coffee beans to the coffee shop.

47
0:02:38.44,000 --> 0:02:41,000
But he couldn't have done his job without the road.

48
0:02:41.76,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So I would thank the people who paved the road.

49
0:02:44.68,000 --> 0:02:45,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:45.8,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And then I would thank the people who made the asphalt for the pavement.

51
0:02:50.84,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And I came to realize that my coffee,

52
0:02:54.92,000 --> 0:02:56,000
like so much else in the world,

53
0:02:57,000 --> 0:02:59,000
requires the combined work

54
0:02:59.52,000 --> 0:03:02,000
of a shocking number of people from all walks of life.

55
0:03:03.12,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Architects, biologists, designers, miners, goat herds,

56
0:03:08.92,000 --> 0:03:09,000
you name it.

57
0:03:10.44,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I decided to call my project

58
0:03:12.72,000 --> 0:03:13,000
"Thanks a Thousand."

59
0:03:14.72,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Because I ended up thanking over a thousand people.

60
0:03:18.4,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And it was overwhelming, but it was also wonderful.

61
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Because it allowed me to focus

62
0:03:24.28,000 --> 0:03:27,000
on the hundreds of things that go right every day,

63
0:03:27.64,000 --> 0:03:29,000
as opposed to the three or four that go wrong.

64
0:03:30.4,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And it reminded me of the astounding interconnectedness or our world.

65
0:03:36.64,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I learned dozens of lessons during this project,

66
0:03:40.52,000 --> 0:03:42,000
but let me just focus on five today.

67
0:03:43.44,000 --> 0:03:45,000
The first is: look up.

68
0:03:46.36,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I started my trail of gratitude

69
0:03:48.4,000 --> 0:03:51,000
by thanking the barista at my local coffee shop,

70
0:03:51.72,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Joe Coffee in New York.

71
0:03:53.4,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Her name is Chung,

72
0:03:55.12,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and Chung is one of the most upbeat people you will ever meet.

73
0:03:59.88,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Big smiler, enthusiastic hugger.

74
0:04:03.24,000 --> 0:04:06,000
But even for Chung, being a barista is hard.

75
0:04:06.76,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And that's because you are encountering people in a very dangerous state.

76
0:04:11.68,000 --> 0:04:12,000
(Laughter)

77
0:04:12.96,000 --> 0:04:14,000
You know what it is -- precaffeination.

78
0:04:15.72,000 --> 0:04:17,000
(Laughter)

79
0:04:17.88,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So, Chung has had people yell at her until she cried,

80
0:04:21.64,000 --> 0:04:23,000
including a nine-year-old girl,

81
0:04:23.68,000 --> 0:04:27,000
who didn't like the whipped cream design that Chung did on her hot chocolate.

82
0:04:27.96,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So I thanked Chung,

83
0:04:30.88,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and she thanked me for thanking her.

84
0:04:34.079,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I cut it off there.

85
0:04:35.36,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I didn't want to go into an infinite thanking loop.

86
0:04:37.8,000 --> 0:04:38,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:39.4,000 --> 0:04:42,000
But Chung said that the hardest part

88
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
is when people don't even treat her like a human being.

89
0:04:46.68,000 --> 0:04:47,000
They treat her like a vending machine.

90
0:04:48.56,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So, they'll hand her their credit card

91
0:04:51.08,000 --> 0:04:53,000
without even looking up from their phone.

92
0:04:53.92,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And while she's saying this, I'm realizing I've done that.

93
0:04:58.76,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I've been that a-hole.

94
0:05:00.64,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And at that moment, I pledged:

95
0:05:03.6,000 --> 0:05:06,000
when dealing with people, I'm going to take those two seconds

96
0:05:06.92,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and look at them, make eye contact.

97
0:05:09.8,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Because it reminds you, you're dealing with a human being

98
0:05:12.68,000 --> 0:05:15,000
who has family and aspirations

99
0:05:16.44,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and embarrassing high school memories.

100
0:05:19.04,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And that little moment of connection

101
0:05:22.12,000 --> 0:05:26,000
is so important to both people's humanity and happiness.

102
0:05:26.84,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Alright, second lesson was:

103
0:05:28.64,000 --> 0:05:32,000
smell the roses. And the dirt. And the fertilizer.

104
0:05:33.4,000 --> 0:05:35,000
After Chung, I thanked this man.

105
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
This is Ed Kaufmann.

106
0:05:38.04,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And Ed is the one who chooses which coffee they serve at my local coffee shop.

107
0:05:43.6,000 --> 0:05:46,000
He goes around the world, to South America, to Africa,

108
0:05:47.28,000 --> 0:05:48,000
finding the best coffee beans.

109
0:05:49.12,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So I thanked Ed.

110
0:05:50.56,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And in return, Ed showed me how to taste coffee like a pro.

111
0:05:56.36,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And it is quite a ritual.

112
0:05:58.32,000 --> 0:06:,000
You take your spoon and you dip it in the coffee

113
0:06:00.6,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and then you take a big, loud slurp.

114
0:06:03.4,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Almost cartoonishly loud.

115
0:06:05.36,000 --> 0:06:08,000
This is because you want to spray the coffee all over your mouth.

116
0:06:08.68,000 --> 0:06:11,000
You have taste buds in the side of your cheeks,

117
0:06:11.84,000 --> 0:06:12,000
in the roof of your mouth,

118
0:06:13.28,000 --> 0:06:14,000
you've got to get them all.

119
0:06:14.84,000 --> 0:06:16,000
So Ed would do this

120
0:06:17.6,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and he would --

121
0:06:20.12,000 --> 0:06:22,000
his face would light up and he would say,

122
0:06:22.84,000 --> 0:06:25,000
"This coffee tastes of Honeycrisp apple

123
0:06:26.84,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and notes of soil and maple syrup."

124
0:06:30.4,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And I would take a sip and I'd say,

125
0:06:33.04,000 --> 0:06:35,000
"I'm picking up coffee.

126
0:06:35.8,000 --> 0:06:36,000
(Laughter)

127
0:06:37.64,000 --> 0:06:38,000
It tastes to me like coffee."

128
0:06:39.52,000 --> 0:06:41,000
(Laughter)

129
0:06:41.56,000 --> 0:06:43,000
But inspired by Ed, I decided to really

130
0:06:44.52,000 --> 0:06:47,000
let the coffee sit on my tongue for five seconds --

131
0:06:47.68,000 --> 0:06:49,000
we're all busy, but I could spare five seconds,

132
0:06:49.92,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and really think about the texture and the acidity and the sweetness.

133
0:06:56.48,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And I started to do it with other foods.

134
0:06:58.84,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And this idea of savoring is so important to gratitude.

135
0:07:04.52,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Psychologists talk about how gratitude

136
0:07:07.88,000 --> 0:07:12,000
is about taking a moment and holding on to it as long as possible.

137
0:07:13.24,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And slowing down time.

138
0:07:16.92,000 --> 0:07:2,000
So that life doesn't go by in one big blur, as it often does.

139
0:07:21.72,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Number three is:

140
0:07:23.2,000 --> 0:07:25,000
find the hidden masterpieces all around you.

141
0:07:26.2,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Now, one of my favorite conversations during this year

142
0:07:29.12,000 --> 0:07:33,000
was with the guy who invented my coffee cup lid.

143
0:07:33.6,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And until this point,

144
0:07:35.28,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I had given approximately zero thought to coffee cup lids.

145
0:07:39.48,000 --> 0:07:42,000
But I loved talking to this inventor, Doug Fleming,

146
0:07:42.76,000 --> 0:07:43,000
because he was so passionate.

147
0:07:44.64,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And the blood and sweat and tears he put into this lid,

148
0:07:48.64,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and that I had never even considered.

149
0:07:51.96,000 --> 0:07:53,000
He says a bad lid can ruin your coffee.

150
0:07:54.84,000 --> 0:07:55,000
That it can block the aroma,

151
0:07:56.8,000 --> 0:07:58,000
which is so important to the experience.

152
0:07:59.08,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So he -- he's very innovative.

153
0:08:01.64,000 --> 0:08:03,000
He's like the Elon Musk of coffee lids.

154
0:08:03.72,000 --> 0:08:04,000
(Laughter)

155
0:08:04.76,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So he designed this lid that's got an upside-down hexagon

156
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:12,000
so you can get your nose right in there and get maximum aroma.

157
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And so I was delighted talking to him,

158
0:08:16.68,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and it made me realize there are hundreds of masterpieces all around us

159
0:08:21.32,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that we totally take for granted.

160
0:08:23.08,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Like the on-off switch on my desk lamp has a little indentation for my thumb

161
0:08:29.56,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that perfectly fits my thumb.

162
0:08:31.36,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And when something is done well,

163
0:08:34.6,000 --> 0:08:37,000
the process behind it is largely invisible.

164
0:08:37.88,000 --> 0:08:39,000
But paying attention to it

165
0:08:40.12,000 --> 0:08:44,000
can tap into that sense of wonder and enrich our lives.

166
0:08:44.36,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Number four is: fake it till you feel it.

167
0:08:47.36,000 --> 0:08:5,000
By the end of the project, I was just in a thanking frenzy.

168
0:08:51.32,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So I was -- I would get up and spend a couple hours,

169
0:08:54.52,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I'd write emails, send notes,

170
0:08:58.4,000 --> 0:09:,000
make phone calls, visit people

171
0:09:00.96,000 --> 0:09:02,000
to thank them for their role in my coffee.

172
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And some of them, quite honestly --

173
0:09:05.44,000 --> 0:09:06,000
not that into it.

174
0:09:07.32,000 --> 0:09:09,000
They would be like, "What is this?

175
0:09:09.6,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Is this a pyramid scheme, what do you want, what are you selling?"

176
0:09:14.56,000 --> 0:09:18,000
But most people were surprisingly moved.

177
0:09:18.84,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I remember, I called the woman who does the pest control

178
0:09:22.64,000 --> 0:09:25,000
for the warehouse where my coffee is served --

179
0:09:25.84,000 --> 0:09:27,000
I'm sorry -- where my coffee is stored.

180
0:09:28.44,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And I said,

181
0:09:30.92,000 --> 0:09:31,000
"This may sound strange,

182
0:09:32.44,000 --> 0:09:36,000
but I want to thank you for keeping the bugs out of my coffee."

183
0:09:36.84,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And she said, "Well, that does sound strange,

184
0:09:39.48,000 --> 0:09:41,000
but you just made my day."

185
0:09:41.6,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And it was like an anti-crank phone call.

186
0:09:45.2,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And it didn't just affect her, it affected me.

187
0:09:48.6,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Because I would wake up every morning in my default mood, which is grumpiness,

188
0:09:54.6,000 --> 0:09:57,000
but I would force myself to write a thank-you note

189
0:09:57.88,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and then another and then another.

190
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And what I found was that if you act as if you're grateful,

191
0:10:04.84,000 --> 0:10:07,000
you eventually become grateful for real.

192
0:10:07.88,000 --> 0:10:11,000
The power of our actions to change our mind is astounding.

193
0:10:12.8,000 --> 0:10:16,000
So, often we think that thought changes behavior,

194
0:10:16.88,000 --> 0:10:2,000
but behavior very often changes our thought.

195
0:10:22.72,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And finally, the last lesson I want to tell you about is:

196
0:10:27.2,000 --> 0:10:3,000
practice six degrees of gratitude.

197
0:10:30.64,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And every place, every stop on this gratitude trail

198
0:10:35.24,000 --> 0:10:38,000
would give birth to 100 other people that I could thank.

199
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
So I went down to Colombia to thank the farmers who grow my coffee beans.

200
0:10:44.44,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And it was in a small mountain town,

201
0:10:46.68,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and I was driven there along these curvy, cliffside roads.

202
0:10:51.88,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And every time we went around a hairpin turn

203
0:10:55.64,000 --> 0:10:58,000
the driver would do the sign of the cross.

204
0:10:59.32,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And I was like, "Thank you for that.

205
0:11:02.2,000 --> 0:11:03,000
(Laughter)

206
0:11:04.04,000 --> 0:11:07,000
But can you do that while keeping your hands on the wheel?

207
0:11:07.88,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Because I am terrified."

208
0:11:09.48,000 --> 0:11:1,000
But we made it.

209
0:11:10.72,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And I met the farmers, the Guarnizo brothers.

210
0:11:14.24,000 --> 0:11:17,000
It's a small farm, they make great coffee,

211
0:11:17.52,000 --> 0:11:19,000
they're paid above fair-trade prices for it.

212
0:11:20.44,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And they showed me how the coffee is grown.

213
0:11:23.48,000 --> 0:11:27,000
The bean is actually inside this fruit called the coffee cherry.

214
0:11:28.08,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And I thanked them.

215
0:11:30.28,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And they said, "Well, we couldn't do our job

216
0:11:33.52,000 --> 0:11:35,000
without 100 other people."

217
0:11:35.76,000 --> 0:11:38,000
The machine that depulps the fruit is made in Brazil,

218
0:11:39.64,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and the pickup truck they drive around the farm,

219
0:11:42.72,000 --> 0:11:45,000
that is made from parts from all over the world.

220
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
In fact, the US exports steel to Colombia.

221
0:11:50.28,000 --> 0:11:54,000
So I went to Indiana, and I thanked the steel makers.

222
0:11:55.28,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And it just drove home

223
0:11:58.44,000 --> 0:12:01,000
that it doesn't take a village to make a cup of coffee.

224
0:12:02.04,000 --> 0:12:05,000
It takes the world to make a cup of coffee.

225
0:12:05.2,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And this global economy, this globalization,

226
0:12:10.32,000 --> 0:12:11,000
it does have downsides.

227
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
But I believe the long-term upsides are far greater,

228
0:12:15.64,000 --> 0:12:16,000
that progress is real.

229
0:12:17.24,000 --> 0:12:19,000
We have made improvements in the last 50 years,

230
0:12:19.68,000 --> 0:12:21,000
poverty worldwide has gone down.

231
0:12:22.4,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And that we should resist the temptation

232
0:12:25.68,000 --> 0:12:28,000
to retreat into our silos.

233
0:12:28.72,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And we should resist this upsurge

234
0:12:31.8,000 --> 0:12:35,000
in isolationism and jingoism.

235
0:12:36.36,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Which brings me to my final point.

236
0:12:38.76,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Which is my hope that we use gratitude as a spark to action.

237
0:12:45.36,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Some people worry that gratitude has a downside.

238
0:12:49.12,000 --> 0:12:52,000
That we'll be so grateful, that we'll be complacent.

239
0:12:52.96,000 --> 0:12:55,000
We'll be so, "Oh, everything's wonderful, I'm so grateful."

240
0:12:56.64,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Well, it turns out, the opposite is true.

241
0:13:01.12,000 --> 0:13:03,000
The research shows

242
0:13:03.44,000 --> 0:13:07,000
that the more grateful you are, the more likely you are to help others.

243
0:13:08.12,000 --> 0:13:1,000
When you're in a bad state,

244
0:13:10.2,000 --> 0:13:12,000
you're often more focused on your own needs.

245
0:13:12.8,000 --> 0:13:15,000
But gratitude makes you want to pay it forward.

246
0:13:16.04,000 --> 0:13:18,000
And I experienced this personally.

247
0:13:18.48,000 --> 0:13:19,000
I mean, I'm not Mother Teresa,

248
0:13:20.2,000 --> 0:13:23,000
I'm still a selfish bastard a huge amount of the time.

249
0:13:23.68,000 --> 0:13:26,000
But I'm better than I was before this project.

250
0:13:27.68,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And that's because it made me aware

251
0:13:30.44,000 --> 0:13:33,000
of the exploitation on the supply chain.

252
0:13:34.04,000 --> 0:13:36,000
It reminded me that what I take for granted

253
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:4,000
is not available to millions of people around the world.

254
0:13:40.8,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Like water.

255
0:13:42.08,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Coffee is 98.8 percent water.

256
0:13:46.4,000 --> 0:13:49,000
So I figured I should go and thank the people at the New York reservoir,

257
0:13:49.96,000 --> 0:13:51,000
hundreds of them, who provide me water,

258
0:13:52.6,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and this miracle that I can turn a lever and get safe water.

259
0:13:55.72,000 --> 0:13:58,000
And that millions of people around the world don't have this luxury

260
0:13:59.32,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and have to walk hours to get safe water.

261
0:14:02.32,000 --> 0:14:06,000
It inspired me to see what I could do to help people get more access,

262
0:14:07.04,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and I did research and found a wonderful group

263
0:14:10.12,000 --> 0:14:12,000
called Dispensers for Safe Water.

264
0:14:12.8,000 --> 0:14:13,000
And I got involved.

265
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
And I'm not expecting the Nobel Prize committee

266
0:14:16.96,000 --> 0:14:17,000
to knock down my door,

267
0:14:18.24,000 --> 0:14:22,000
but it's a baby step, it's a little something.

268
0:14:22.56,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And it's all because of gratitude.

269
0:14:25.4,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And it's why I encourage people, friends, family,

270
0:14:28.96,000 --> 0:14:3,000
to follow gratitude trails of their own.

271
0:14:31.96,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Because it's a life-transforming experience.

272
0:14:34.8,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And it doesn't have to be coffee.

273
0:14:36.44,000 --> 0:14:37,000
It could be anything.

274
0:14:37.68,000 --> 0:14:39,000
It could be a pair of socks, it could be a light bulb.

275
0:14:40.24,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And you don't have to go around the world, you can just do a little gesture,

276
0:14:43.84,000 --> 0:14:48,000
like make eye contact or send a note to the designer of a logo you love.

277
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:5,000
It's more about a mindset.

278
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Being aware of the thousands of people involved in every little thing we do.

279
0:14:56.88,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Remembering that there's someone in a factory

280
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:04,000
who made the fabric for the chairs you're sitting in right now.

281
0:15:04.24,000 --> 0:15:1,000
That someone went into a mine and got the copper for this microphone

282
0:15:10.4,000 --> 0:15:12,000
so that I could say my final thank you,

283
0:15:13,000 --> 0:15:14,000
which is to thank you.

284
0:15:14.88,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Thank you a thousand for listening to my story.

285
0:15:18.4,000 --> 0:15:2,000
(Applause)

286
0:15:20.64,000 --> 0:15:21,000
(Cheering)

2
0:00:15.997,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I was one of those kids that, every time I got in the car,

3
0:00:19.348,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I basically had to roll down the window.

4
0:00:22.291,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It was usually too hot, too stuffy or just too smelly,

5
0:00:26.503,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and my father would not let us use the air conditioner.

6
0:00:28.857,000 --> 0:00:3,000
He said that it would overheat the engine.

7
0:00:31.614,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And you might remember, some of you,

8
0:00:33.262,000 --> 0:00:34,000
how the cars were back then, and it was

9
0:00:35.162,000 --> 0:00:37,000
a common problem of overheating.

10
0:00:37.528,000 --> 0:00:41,000
But it was also the signal that capped the use,

11
0:00:41.548,000 --> 0:00:45,000
or overuse, of energy-consuming devices.

12
0:00:45.97,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Things have changed now. We have cars that we take across country.

13
0:00:49.009,000 --> 0:00:52,000
We blast the air conditioning the entire way,

14
0:00:52.17,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and we never experience overheating.

15
0:00:53.746,000 --> 0:00:55,000
So there's no more signal for us to tell us to stop.

16
0:00:56.733,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Great, right? Well, we have similar problems in buildings.

17
0:01:02.351,000 --> 0:01:05,000
In the past, before air conditioning, we had thick walls.

18
0:01:05.817,000 --> 0:01:07,000
The thick walls are great for insulation. It keeps the interior

19
0:01:08.496,000 --> 0:01:11,000
very cool during the summertime, and warm during the wintertime,

20
0:01:12.014,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and the small windows were also very good because

21
0:01:14.414,000 --> 0:01:16,000
it limited the amount of temperature transfer

22
0:01:17.005,000 --> 0:01:19,000
between the interior and exterior.

23
0:01:19.472,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Then in about the 1930s, with the advent of plate glass,

24
0:01:23.344,000 --> 0:01:26,000
rolled steel and mass production, we were able

25
0:01:26.74,000 --> 0:01:29,000
to make floor-to-ceiling windows and unobstructed views,

26
0:01:30.19,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and with that came the irreversible reliance on

27
0:01:33.916,000 --> 0:01:39,000
mechanical air conditioning to cool our solar-heated spaces.

28
0:01:40.497,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Over time, the buildings got taller and bigger,

29
0:01:43.601,000 --> 0:01:45,000
our engineering even better, so that the mechanical systems

30
0:01:46.242,000 --> 0:01:49,000
were massive. They require a huge amount of energy.

31
0:01:50.116,000 --> 0:01:52,000
They give off a lot of heat into the atmosphere,

32
0:01:52.875,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and for some of you may understand the heat island effect

33
0:01:56.075,000 --> 0:01:59,000
in cities, where the urban areas are much more warm

34
0:01:59.585,000 --> 0:02:01,000
than the adjacent rural areas,

35
0:02:02.535,000 --> 0:02:05,000
but we also have problems that, when we lose power,

36
0:02:05.789,000 --> 0:02:07,000
we can't open a window here, and so

37
0:02:08.55,000 --> 0:02:1,000
the buildings are uninhabitable and have to be made vacant

38
0:02:11.364,000 --> 0:02:14,000
until that air conditioning system can start up again.

39
0:02:15.012,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Even worse, with our intention of trying to make buildings

40
0:02:19.067,000 --> 0:02:23,000
move towards a net-zero energy state, we can't do it

41
0:02:24.052,000 --> 0:02:26,000
just by making mechanical systems more and more efficient.

42
0:02:26.419,000 --> 0:02:29,000
We need to look for something else, and we've gotten ourselves a little bit into a rut.

43
0:02:30.197,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So what do we do here? How do we pull ourselves and dig us

44
0:02:34.448,000 --> 0:02:36,000
out of this hole that we've dug?

45
0:02:37.299,000 --> 0:02:39,000
If we look at biology, and many of you probably don't know,

46
0:02:40.208,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I was a biology major before I went into architecture,

47
0:02:43.864,000 --> 0:02:47,000
the human skin is the organ that naturally regulates

48
0:02:48.253,000 --> 0:02:51,000
the temperature in the body, and it's a fantastic thing.

49
0:02:51.689,000 --> 0:02:53,000
That's the first line of defense for the body.

50
0:02:54.304,000 --> 0:02:57,000
It has pores, it has sweat glands, it has all these things

51
0:02:57.513,000 --> 0:03:,000
that work together very dynamically and very efficiently,

52
0:03:00.931,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and so what I propose is that our building skins

53
0:03:03.435,000 --> 0:03:06,000
should be more similar to human skin,

54
0:03:07.084,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and by doing so can be much more dynamic, responsive

55
0:03:11.196,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and differentiated, depending on where it is.

56
0:03:14.452,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And this gets me back to my research.

57
0:03:16.385,000 --> 0:03:21,000
What I proposed first doing is looking at a different material palette to do that.

58
0:03:21.695,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I presently, or currently, work with smart materials,

59
0:03:24.606,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and a smart thermo-bimetal.

60
0:03:26.325,000 --> 0:03:28,000
First of all, I guess we call it smart because it requires

61
0:03:29.237,000 --> 0:03:31,000
no controls and it requires no energy,

62
0:03:31.967,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and that's a very big deal for architecture.

63
0:03:34.63,000 --> 0:03:36,000
What it is, it's a lamination of two different metals together.

64
0:03:37.444,000 --> 0:03:4,000
You can see that here by the different reflection on this side.

65
0:03:41.318,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And because it has two different coefficients of expansion,

66
0:03:44.793,000 --> 0:03:47,000
when heated, one side will expand faster than the other

67
0:03:48.09,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and result in a curling action.

68
0:03:51.627,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So in early prototypes I built these surfaces to try to see

69
0:03:55.333,000 --> 0:03:59,000
how the curl would react to temperature and possibly allow

70
0:03:59.526,000 --> 0:04:02,000
air to ventilate through the system,

71
0:04:02.631,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and in other prototypes did surfaces where the multiplicity

72
0:04:05.86,000 --> 0:04:07,000
of having these strips together can try to make

73
0:04:08.341,000 --> 0:04:12,000
bigger movement happen when also heated,

74
0:04:12.415,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and currently have this installation at the Materials & Applications gallery

75
0:04:16.479,000 --> 0:04:19,000
in Silver Lake, close by, and it's there until August, if you want to see it.

76
0:04:19.965,000 --> 0:04:21,000
It's called "Bloom," and the surface is made completely

77
0:04:22.863,000 --> 0:04:26,000
out of thermo-bimetal, and its intention is to make this canopy

78
0:04:26.903,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that does two things. One, it's a sun-shading device, so that

79
0:04:30.72,000 --> 0:04:34,000
when the sun hits the surface, it constricts the amount of sun passing through,

80
0:04:34.73,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and in other areas, it's a ventilating system,

81
0:04:38.099,000 --> 0:04:4,000
so that hot, trapped air underneath can actually

82
0:04:40.252,000 --> 0:04:43,000
move through and out when necessary.

83
0:04:44.13,000 --> 0:04:48,000
You can see here in this time-lapse video that the sun,

84
0:04:48.261,000 --> 0:04:5,000
as it moves across the surface, as well as the shade,

85
0:04:51.007,000 --> 0:04:53,000
each of the tiles moves individually.

86
0:04:53.483,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Keep in mind, with the digital technology that we have today,

87
0:04:55.995,000 --> 0:04:58,000
this thing was made out of about 14,000 pieces

88
0:04:59.008,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and there's no two pieces alike at all. Every single one is different.

89
0:05:03.737,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And the great thing with that is the fact that we can calibrate

90
0:05:06.249,000 --> 0:05:09,000
each one to be very, very specific to its location,

91
0:05:10.248,000 --> 0:05:14,000
to the angle of the sun, and also how the thing actually curls.

92
0:05:15.194,000 --> 0:05:17,000
So this kind of proof of concept project

93
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:19,000
has a lot of implications

94
0:05:19.964,000 --> 0:05:22,000
to actual future application in architecture,

95
0:05:23.664,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and in this case, here you see a house,

96
0:05:26.169,000 --> 0:05:28,000
that's for a developer in China,

97
0:05:28.602,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and it's actually a four-story glass box.

98
0:05:31.346,000 --> 0:05:34,000
It's still with that glass box because we still want that visual access,

99
0:05:35.183,000 --> 0:05:38,000
but now it's sheathed with this thermo-bimetal layer,

100
0:05:39.065,000 --> 0:05:41,000
it's a screen that goes around it, and that layer can actually

101
0:05:41.53,000 --> 0:05:45,000
open and close as that sun moves around on that surface.

102
0:05:45.558,000 --> 0:05:49,000
In addition to that, it can also screen areas for privacy,

103
0:05:50.12,000 --> 0:05:52,000
so that it can differentiate from some of the public areas

104
0:05:52.416,000 --> 0:05:54,000
in the space during different times of day.

105
0:05:55.008,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And what it basically implies is that, in houses now,

106
0:05:58.271,000 --> 0:06:01,000
we don't need drapes or shutters or blinds anymore

107
0:06:01.688,000 --> 0:06:03,000
because we can sheath the building with these things,

108
0:06:03.855,000 --> 0:06:08,000
as well as control the amount of air conditioning you need inside that building.

109
0:06:09.422,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I'm also looking at trying to develop some building components for the market,

110
0:06:12.811,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and so here you see a pretty typical

111
0:06:15.3,000 --> 0:06:19,000
double-glazed window panel, and in that panel,

112
0:06:20.031,000 --> 0:06:22,000
between those two pieces of glass, that double-glazing,

113
0:06:22.958,000 --> 0:06:24,000
I'm trying to work on making

114
0:06:25.135,000 --> 0:06:27,000
a thermo-bimetal pattern system

115
0:06:27.204,000 --> 0:06:29,000
so that when the sun hits that outside layer

116
0:06:29.876,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and heats that interior cavity, that thermo-bimetal

117
0:06:34.52,000 --> 0:06:36,000
will begin to curl, and what actually will happen then

118
0:06:37.296,000 --> 0:06:39,000
is it'll start to block out the sun

119
0:06:39.599,000 --> 0:06:4,000
in certain areas of the building,

120
0:06:41.473,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and totally, if necessary.

121
0:06:43.414,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And so you can imagine, even in this application, that

122
0:06:45.922,000 --> 0:06:47,000
in a high-rise building where the panel systems go

123
0:06:48.599,000 --> 0:06:52,000
from floor to floor up to 30, 40 floors, the entire surface

124
0:06:53.366,000 --> 0:06:55,000
could be differentiated at different times of day

125
0:06:55.556,000 --> 0:07:,000
depending on how that sun moves across and hits that surface.

126
0:07:01.015,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And these are some later studies that I'm working on

127
0:07:03.834,000 --> 0:07:05,000
right now that are on the boards, where you can see,

128
0:07:06.098,000 --> 0:07:09,000
in the bottom right-hand corner, with the red, it's actually

129
0:07:09.439,000 --> 0:07:11,000
smaller pieces of thermometal, and it's actually going to,

130
0:07:11.717,000 --> 0:07:16,000
we're trying to make it move like cilia or eyelashes.

131
0:07:16.963,000 --> 0:07:18,000
This last project is also of components.

132
0:07:19.445,000 --> 0:07:22,000
The influence -- and if you have noticed, one of my

133
0:07:23.302,000 --> 0:07:26,000
spheres of influence is biology -- is from a grasshopper.

134
0:07:26.878,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And grasshoppers have a different kind of breathing system.

135
0:07:29.485,000 --> 0:07:32,000
They breathe through holes in their sides called spiracles,

136
0:07:32.887,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and they bring the air through and it moves through their system to cool them down,

137
0:07:36.377,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and so in this project, I'm trying to look at how we can

138
0:07:39.759,000 --> 0:07:41,000
consider that in architecture too, how we can bring

139
0:07:41.941,000 --> 0:07:43,000
air through holes in the sides of a building.

140
0:07:44.607,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And so you see here some early studies of blocks,

141
0:07:47.58,000 --> 0:07:49,000
where those holes are actually coming through,

142
0:07:50.093,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and this is before the thermo-bimetal is applied,

143
0:07:53.813,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and this is after the bimetal is applied. Sorry, it's a little

144
0:07:56.512,000 --> 0:07:59,000
hard to see, but on the surfaces, you can see these red arrows.

145
0:07:59.72,000 --> 0:08:02,000
On the left, it's when it's cold and the thermo-bimetal

146
0:08:02.898,000 --> 0:08:05,000
is flat so it will constrict air from passing through the blocks,

147
0:08:06.5,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and on the right, the thermo-bimetal curls

148
0:08:08.54,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and allows that air to pass through, so those are two different

149
0:08:12.086,000 --> 0:08:13,000
components that I'm working on, and again,

150
0:08:13.902,000 --> 0:08:15,000
it's a completely different thing, because you can imagine

151
0:08:16.214,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that air could potentially be coming through the walls

152
0:08:18.941,000 --> 0:08:2,000
instead of opening windows.

153
0:08:21.822,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So I want to leave you with one last impression about

154
0:08:24.51,000 --> 0:08:28,000
the project, or this kind of work and using smart materials.

155
0:08:28.89,000 --> 0:08:31,000
When you're tired of opening and closing those blinds

156
0:08:32.07,000 --> 0:08:34,000
day after day, when you're on vacation

157
0:08:35.063,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and there's no one there on the weekends to be turning off and on the controls,

158
0:08:39.102,000 --> 0:08:41,000
or when there's a power outage, and you have

159
0:08:41.457,000 --> 0:08:44,000
no electricity to rely on, these thermo-bimetals

160
0:08:44.478,000 --> 0:08:47,000
will still be working tirelessly, efficiently

161
0:08:48.476,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and endlessly. Thank you. (Applause)

162
0:08:51.782,000 --> 0:08:53,000

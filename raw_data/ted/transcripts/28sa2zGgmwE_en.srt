1
0:00:13.054,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Some months back, I was visiting this East African city,

2
0:00:18.558,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and we were stuck in traffic.

3
0:00:21.571,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And this vendor suddenly approaches my window

4
0:00:24.637,000 --> 0:00:26,000
with a half-opened alphabet sheet.

5
0:00:28.505,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I took a quick look at the alphabet sheet,

6
0:00:31.348,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and I thought of my daughter,

7
0:00:32.807,000 --> 0:00:34,000
how it would be nice to spread it on the floor

8
0:00:35.393,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and just play all over it with her

9
0:00:37.257,000 --> 0:00:39,000
while getting her to learn the alphabet.

10
0:00:39.47,000 --> 0:00:42,000
So the traffic moved a bit, and I quickly grabbed a copy,

11
0:00:42.789,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and we moved on.

12
0:00:46.165,000 --> 0:00:49,000
When I had time to fully open the alphabet sheet

13
0:00:49.29,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and take a more detailed look at it,

14
0:00:51.643,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I knew I was not going to use that to teach my daughter.

15
0:00:55.267,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I regretted my purchase.

16
0:00:58.331,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Why so?

17
0:01:00.338,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Looking at the alphabet sheet reminded me of the fact

18
0:01:03.148,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that not much has changed

19
0:01:05.548,000 --> 0:01:07,000
in the education curricula in Africa.

20
0:01:08.729,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Some decades back, I was taught out of a similar alphabet sheet.

21
0:01:13.312,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And because of that, I struggled for years.

22
0:01:16.464,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I struggled to reconcile my reality with the formal education I received

23
0:01:20.984,000 --> 0:01:22,000
in school, in the schools I attended.

24
0:01:24.592,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I had identity crises.

25
0:01:26.626,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I looked down on my reality.

26
0:01:29.559,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I looked at my ancestry, I looked at my lineage with disrespect.

27
0:01:34.205,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I had very little patience for what my life had to offer around me.

28
0:01:41.045,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Why?

29
0:01:43.496,000 --> 0:01:44,000
"A is for apple."

30
0:01:46.421,000 --> 0:01:47,000
"A is for apple."

31
0:01:49.528,000 --> 0:01:53,000
"A is for apple" is for that child in that part of the world

32
0:01:54.24,000 --> 0:01:55,000
where apples grow out;

33
0:01:56.751,000 --> 0:01:57,000
who has an apple in her lunch bag;

34
0:02:00.235,000 --> 0:02:03,000
who goes to the grocery store with her mom and sees red,

35
0:02:03.661,000 --> 0:02:06,000
green, yellow -- apples of all shapes and colors and sizes.

36
0:02:08.049,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And so, introducing education to this child

37
0:02:10.962,000 --> 0:02:12,000
with an alphabet sheet like this

38
0:02:14.09,000 --> 0:02:17,000
fulfills one of the major functions of education,

39
0:02:17.155,000 --> 0:02:2,000
which is to introduce the learner

40
0:02:20.341,000 --> 0:02:23,000
to an appreciation of the learner's environment

41
0:02:23.738,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and a curiosity to explore more in order to add value.

42
0:02:29.581,000 --> 0:02:3,000
In my own case,

43
0:02:32.014,000 --> 0:02:34,000
when and where I grew up in Africa,

44
0:02:35.613,000 --> 0:02:36,000
apple was an exotic fruit.

45
0:02:38.719,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Two or three times a year,

46
0:02:40.128,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I could get some yellowish apples with brown dots, you know,

47
0:02:45.519,000 --> 0:02:48,000
signifying thousands of miles traveled -- warehouses storing --

48
0:02:49.44,000 --> 0:02:5,000
to get to me.

49
0:02:51.575,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I grew up in the city

50
0:02:53.51,000 --> 0:02:56,000
to very financially comfortable parents,

51
0:02:56.534,000 --> 0:02:57,000
so it was my dignified reality,

52
0:02:58.5,000 --> 0:03:,000
exactly the same way

53
0:03:00.835,000 --> 0:03:04,000
cassava fufu or ugali would not regularly feature

54
0:03:05.021,000 --> 0:03:07,000
in an American, Chinese or Indian diet,

55
0:03:08.851,000 --> 0:03:1,000
apples didn't count as part of my reality.

56
0:03:12.208,000 --> 0:03:15,000
So what this did to me,

57
0:03:15.28,000 --> 0:03:18,000
introducing education to me with "A is for apple,"

58
0:03:18.988,000 --> 0:03:2,000
made education an abstraction.

59
0:03:21.914,000 --> 0:03:22,000
It made it something out of my reach --

60
0:03:24.665,000 --> 0:03:25,000
a foreign concept,

61
0:03:26.595,000 --> 0:03:29,000
a phenomenon for which I would have to constantly and perpetually seek

62
0:03:30.425,000 --> 0:03:31,000
the validation of those it belonged to

63
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
for me to make progress within it and with it.

64
0:03:36.109,000 --> 0:03:38,000
That was tough for a child; it would be tough for anyone.

65
0:03:40.042,000 --> 0:03:42,000
As I grew up and I advanced academically,

66
0:03:42.789,000 --> 0:03:47,000
my reality was further separated from my education.

67
0:03:48.739,000 --> 0:03:49,000
In history, I was taught

68
0:03:50.509,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that the Scottish explorer Mungo Park discovered the Niger River.

69
0:03:55.631,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And so it bothered me.

70
0:03:57.448,000 --> 0:03:59,000
My great-great-grandparents grew up

71
0:03:59.487,000 --> 0:04:01,000
quite close to the edge of the Niger River.

72
0:04:01.514,000 --> 0:04:03,000
(Laughter)

73
0:04:03.957,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And it took someone to travel thousands of miles from Europe

74
0:04:10.458,000 --> 0:04:12,000
to discover a river right under their nose?

75
0:04:12.929,000 --> 0:04:14,000
(Laughter)

76
0:04:15.394,000 --> 0:04:16,000
No!

77
0:04:16.575,000 --> 0:04:21,000
(Applause and cheers)

78
0:04:22.018,000 --> 0:04:23,000
What did they do with their time?

79
0:04:23.971,000 --> 0:04:24,000
(Laughter)

80
0:04:25.892,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Playing board games, roasting fresh yams,

81
0:04:28.747,000 --> 0:04:29,000
fighting tribal wars?

82
0:04:30.557,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I mean, I just knew my education was preparing me to go somewhere else

83
0:04:35.441,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and practice and give to another environment that it belonged to.

84
0:04:39.232,000 --> 0:04:42,000
It was not for my environment, where and when I grew up.

85
0:04:43.029,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And this continued.

86
0:04:44.212,000 --> 0:04:45,000
This philosophy undergirded my studies

87
0:04:46.129,000 --> 0:04:48,000
all through the time I studied in Africa.

88
0:04:48.618,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It took a lot of experiences and some studies

89
0:04:52.476,000 --> 0:04:55,000
for me to begin to have a change of mindset.

90
0:04:55.652,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I will share a couple of the remarkable ones with us.

91
0:04:59.735,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I was in the United States in Washington, DC

92
0:05:02.114,000 --> 0:05:04,000
studying towards my doctorate,

93
0:05:04.18,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and I got this consultancy position with the World Bank Africa Region.

94
0:05:08.735,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And so I remember one day,

95
0:05:11.515,000 --> 0:05:15,000
my boss -- we were having a conversation on some project,

96
0:05:16.187,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and he mentioned a particular World Bank project,

97
0:05:19.252,000 --> 0:05:23,000
a large-scale irrigation project that cost millions of dollars

98
0:05:24.248,000 --> 0:05:25,000
in Niger Republic

99
0:05:25.603,000 --> 0:05:28,000
that was faltering sustainably.

100
0:05:28.901,000 --> 0:05:3,000
He said this project wasn't so sustainable,

101
0:05:31.268,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and it bothered those that instituted the whole package.

102
0:05:36.035,000 --> 0:05:38,000
But then he mentioned a particular project,

103
0:05:39.517,000 --> 0:05:43,000
a particular traditional irrigation method that was hugely successful

104
0:05:44.458,000 --> 0:05:47,000
in the same Niger Republic where the World Bank project was failing.

105
0:05:48.93,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And that got me thinking.

106
0:05:51.281,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So I did further research,

107
0:05:53.984,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and I found out about Tassa.

108
0:05:57.775,000 --> 0:06:,000
Tassa is a traditional irrigation method

109
0:06:01.569,000 --> 0:06:07,000
where 20- to 30-centimeter-wide and 20- to 30-centimeter-deep holes

110
0:06:07.786,000 --> 0:06:09,000
are dug across a field to be cultivated.

111
0:06:11.22,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Then, a small dam is constructed around the field,

112
0:06:16.296,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and then crops are planted across the surface area.

113
0:06:19.946,000 --> 0:06:22,000
What happens is that when rain falls,

114
0:06:23.274,000 --> 0:06:25,000
the holes are able to store the water

115
0:06:26.282,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and appropriate it to the extent that the plant needs the water.

116
0:06:30.124,000 --> 0:06:33,000
The plant can only assimilate as much water as needed

117
0:06:33.414,000 --> 0:06:34,000
until harvest time.

118
0:06:36.582,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Niger is 75 percent scorched desert,

119
0:06:40.299,000 --> 0:06:42,000
so this is something that is a life-or-death situation,

120
0:06:43.016,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and it has been used for centuries.

121
0:06:45.384,000 --> 0:06:47,000
In an experiment that was conducted,

122
0:06:48.233,000 --> 0:06:53,000
two similar plots of land were used in the experiment,

123
0:06:53.67,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and one plot of land

124
0:06:56.325,000 --> 0:06:57,000
did not have the Tassa technique on it.

125
0:06:58.291,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Similar plots.

126
0:06:59.482,000 --> 0:07:02,000
The other one had Tassa technique constructed on it.

127
0:07:03.332,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Then similar grains of millet also were planted on both plots.

128
0:07:08.045,000 --> 0:07:1,000
During harvest time,

129
0:07:10.276,000 --> 0:07:13,000
the plot of land without Tassa technique

130
0:07:13.452,000 --> 0:07:17,000
yielded 11 kilograms of millet per hectare.

131
0:07:18.737,000 --> 0:07:2,000
The plot of land with Tassa technique

132
0:07:21.056,000 --> 0:07:26,000
yielded 553 kilograms of millet per hectare.

133
0:07:27.66,000 --> 0:07:29,000
(Applause)

134
0:07:30.269,000 --> 0:07:33,000
I looked at the research, and I looked at myself.

135
0:07:34.206,000 --> 0:07:37,000
I said, "I studied agriculture for 12 years,

136
0:07:37.482,000 --> 0:07:4,000
from primary to Senior Six, as we say in East Africa,

137
0:07:40.916,000 --> 0:07:42,000
SS3 in West Africa or 12th grade.

138
0:07:43.286,000 --> 0:07:44,000
No one ever taught me

139
0:07:44.967,000 --> 0:07:47,000
of any form of traditional African knowledge of cultivation --

140
0:07:48.797,000 --> 0:07:49,000
of harvesting, of anything --

141
0:07:50.615,000 --> 0:07:53,000
that will work in modern times and actually succeed,

142
0:07:54.467,000 --> 0:07:58,000
where something imported from the West would struggle to succeed.

143
0:07:59.775,000 --> 0:08:02,000
That was when I knew the challenge,

144
0:08:02.912,000 --> 0:08:04,000
the challenge of Africa's curricula,

145
0:08:05.649,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And I thus began my quest to dedicate my life, concern my life work,

146
0:08:10.471,000 --> 0:08:14,000
to studying, conducting research on Africa's own knowledge system

147
0:08:14.787,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and being able to advocate for its mainstreaming

148
0:08:17.811,000 --> 0:08:19,000
in education, in research, policy

149
0:08:20.682,000 --> 0:08:22,000
across sectors and industries.

150
0:08:23.445,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Another conversation and experience I had at the bank

151
0:08:27.313,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I guess made me take that final decision of where I was going to go,

152
0:08:32.087,000 --> 0:08:36,000
even though it wasn't the most lucrative research to go into,

153
0:08:36.135,000 --> 0:08:38,000
but it was just about what I believed in.

154
0:08:38.937,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And so one day, my boss said that he likes to go to Africa

155
0:08:43.587,000 --> 0:08:47,000
to negotiate World Bank loans and to work on World Bank projects.

156
0:08:48.614,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And I was intrigued. I asked him why.

157
0:08:50.587,000 --> 0:08:52,000
He said, "Oh, when I go to Africa,

158
0:08:53.057,000 --> 0:08:54,000
it's so easy.

159
0:08:55.255,000 --> 0:08:59,000
I just write up my loan documents and my project proposal in Washington, DC,

160
0:08:59.937,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I go to Africa, and they all just get signed.

161
0:09:02.914,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I get the best deal, and I'm back to base.

162
0:09:06.326,000 --> 0:09:08,000
My bosses are happy with me."

163
0:09:08.933,000 --> 0:09:11,000
But then he said, "I hate going to Asia or ..."

164
0:09:12.644,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and he mentioned a particular country, Asia and some of these countries.

165
0:09:16.111,000 --> 0:09:2,000
"They keep me for this, trying to get the best deal for their countries.

166
0:09:20.158,000 --> 0:09:21,000
They get the best deal.

167
0:09:21.358,000 --> 0:09:23,000
They tell me, 'Oh, that clause will not work for us

168
0:09:24.29,000 --> 0:09:25,000
in our environment.

169
0:09:25.921,000 --> 0:09:27,000
It's not our reality. It's just so Western.'

170
0:09:28.918,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And they tell me, 'Oh, we have enough experts

171
0:09:32.053,000 --> 0:09:33,000
to take care of this.

172
0:09:33.28,000 --> 0:09:34,000
You don't have enough experts.

173
0:09:34.925,000 --> 0:09:35,000
We know our aim.'

174
0:09:36.102,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And they just keep going through all these things.

175
0:09:38.571,000 --> 0:09:4,000
By the time they finish, yes, they get the best deal,

176
0:09:41.115,000 --> 0:09:44,000
but I'm so exhausted and I don't get the best deal for the bank,

177
0:09:44.304,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and we're in business."

178
0:09:45.507,000 --> 0:09:46,000
"Really?" I thought in my head, "OK."

179
0:09:47.326,000 --> 0:09:51,000
I was privileged to sit in on a loan negotiating session

180
0:09:51.63,000 --> 0:09:52,000
in an African country.

181
0:09:53.319,000 --> 0:09:55,000
So I would do these consultancy positions during summer,

182
0:09:56.163,000 --> 0:09:58,000
you know, since I was a doctoral student.

183
0:09:58.871,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And then I traveled with the team, with the World Bank team,

184
0:10:03.227,000 --> 0:10:07,000
as more like someone to help out with organizational matters.

185
0:10:07.567,000 --> 0:10:1,000
But I sat in during the negotiating session.

186
0:10:11.73,000 --> 0:10:15,000
I had mostly Euro-Americans, you know, with me from Washington, DC.

187
0:10:16.686,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And I looked across the table at my African brothers and sisters.

188
0:10:21.993,000 --> 0:10:23,000
I could see intimidation on their faces.

189
0:10:24.771,000 --> 0:10:26,000
They didn't believe they had anything to offer

190
0:10:27.058,000 --> 0:10:29,000
the great-great-grandchildren of Mungo Park --

191
0:10:29.37,000 --> 0:10:31,000
the owners of "apple" in "A is for apple."

192
0:10:32.011,000 --> 0:10:34,000
They just sat and watched: "Oh, just give us, let us sign.

193
0:10:34.811,000 --> 0:10:35,000
You own the knowledge. You know it all.

194
0:10:36.748,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Just, where do we sign? Show us, let us sign."

195
0:10:38.981,000 --> 0:10:41,000
They had no voice. They didn't believe in themselves.

196
0:10:46.544,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Excuse me.

197
0:10:48.587,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And so,

198
0:10:51.212,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I have been doing this for a decade.

199
0:10:53.562,000 --> 0:10:56,000
I have been conducting research on Africa's knowledge system,

200
0:10:57.03,000 --> 0:10:59,000
original, authentic, traditional knowledge.

201
0:10:59.298,000 --> 0:11:02,000
In the few cases where this has been implemented in Africa,

202
0:11:02.519,000 --> 0:11:04,000
there has been remarkable successes recorded.

203
0:11:05.027,000 --> 0:11:06,000
I think of Gacaca.

204
0:11:07.256,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Gacaca is Rwanda's traditional judicial system

205
0:11:12.012,000 --> 0:11:14,000
that was used after the genocide.

206
0:11:14.13,000 --> 0:11:16,000
In 1994, when the genocide ended,

207
0:11:18.1,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Rwanda's national court system was in shambles:

208
0:11:20.686,000 --> 0:11:25,000
no judges, no lawyers to try hundreds of thousands of genocide cases.

209
0:11:26.236,000 --> 0:11:29,000
So the government of Rwanda came up with this idea

210
0:11:29.768,000 --> 0:11:32,000
to resuscitate a traditional judicial system known as Gacaca.

211
0:11:33.625,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Gacaca is a community-based judicial system,

212
0:11:37.096,000 --> 0:11:39,000
where community members come together

213
0:11:40.057,000 --> 0:11:43,000
to elect men and women of proven integrity

214
0:11:43.83,000 --> 0:11:47,000
to try cases of crimes committed within these communities.

215
0:11:49.255,000 --> 0:11:54,000
So by the time Gacaca concluded its trial of genocide cases in 2012,

216
0:11:55.619,000 --> 0:12:01,000
12,000 community-based courts had tried approximately 1.2 million cases.

217
0:12:03.334,000 --> 0:12:04,000
That's a record.

218
0:12:05.169,000 --> 0:12:09,000
(Applause)

219
0:12:10.438,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Most importantly is that Gacaca emphasized Rwanda's traditional philosophy

220
0:12:16.062,000 --> 0:12:19,000
of reconciliation and reintegration,

221
0:12:19.179,000 --> 0:12:22,000
as against the whole punitive and banishment idea

222
0:12:23.081,000 --> 0:12:26,000
that undergirds present-day Western style.

223
0:12:27.481,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And not to compare, but just to say that it really emphasized

224
0:12:31.4,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Rwanda's traditional method of philosophy.

225
0:12:35.269,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And so it was Mwalimu Julius Nyerere,

226
0:12:37.89,000 --> 0:12:38,000
former president of Tanzania --

227
0:12:39.655,000 --> 0:12:4,000
(Applause)

228
0:12:41.155,000 --> 0:12:44,000
who said that you cannot develop people.

229
0:12:44.916,000 --> 0:12:47,000
People will have to develop themselves.

230
0:12:48.563,000 --> 0:12:49,000
I agree with Mwalimu.

231
0:12:50.487,000 --> 0:12:51,000
I am convinced

232
0:12:51.899,000 --> 0:12:54,000
that Africa's further transformation, Africa's advancement,

233
0:12:55.546,000 --> 0:12:59,000
rests simply in the acknowledgment, validation and mainstreaming

234
0:13:00.349,000 --> 0:13:04,000
of Africa's own traditional, authentic, original, indigenous knowledge

235
0:13:05.362,000 --> 0:13:09,000
in education, in research, in policy making and across sectors.

236
0:13:10.816,000 --> 0:13:12,000
This is not going to be easy for Africa.

237
0:13:13.357,000 --> 0:13:16,000
It is not going to be easy for a people used to being told how to think,

238
0:13:16.845,000 --> 0:13:18,000
what to do, how to go about it,

239
0:13:19.234,000 --> 0:13:22,000
a people long subjected to the intellectual guidance

240
0:13:22.412,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and direction of others,

241
0:13:24.178,000 --> 0:13:25,000
be they the colonial masters,

242
0:13:25.869,000 --> 0:13:27,000
aid industry or international news media.

243
0:13:28.865,000 --> 0:13:31,000
But it is a task that we have to do to make progress.

244
0:13:32.123,000 --> 0:13:34,000
I am strengthened by the words of Joseph Shabalala,

245
0:13:35.047,000 --> 0:13:38,000
founder of the South African choral group Ladysmith Black Mambazo.

246
0:13:38.545,000 --> 0:13:43,000
He said that the task ahead of us can never, ever be greater

247
0:13:44.256,000 --> 0:13:46,000
than the power within us.

248
0:13:46.433,000 --> 0:13:47,000
We can do it.

249
0:13:47.615,000 --> 0:13:49,000
We can unlearn looking down on ourselves.

250
0:13:50.199,000 --> 0:13:54,000
We can learn to place value on our reality and our knowledge.

251
0:13:54.418,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Thank you.

252
0:13:55.597,000 --> 0:13:56,000
(Swahili) Thank you very much.

253
0:13:57.092,000 --> 0:13:58,000
(Applause)

254
0:13:58.639,000 --> 0:14:,000
Thank you. Thank you.

255
0:14:00.865,000 --> 0:14:04,000
(Applause)

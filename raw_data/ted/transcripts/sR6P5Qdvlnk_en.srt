1
0:00:13,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I dedicated the past two years to understanding

2
0:00:15.233,000 --> 0:00:17,000
how people achieve their dreams.

3
0:00:17.598,000 --> 0:00:18,000
When we think about the dreams we have,

4
0:00:19.599,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and the dent we want to leave in the universe,

5
0:00:22.132,000 --> 0:00:25,000
it is striking to see how big of an overlap there is

6
0:00:25.677,000 --> 0:00:28,000
between the dreams that we have, and projects that never happen.

7
0:00:29.323,000 --> 0:00:3,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:30.515,000 --> 0:00:31,000
So I'm here to talk to you today

9
0:00:32.321,000 --> 0:00:35,000
about five ways how not to follow your dreams.

10
0:00:37.223,000 --> 0:00:41,000
One: Believe in overnight success.

11
0:00:41.549,000 --> 0:00:42,000
You know the story, right?

12
0:00:43.285,000 --> 0:00:47,000
The tech guy built a mobile app and sold it very fast for a lot of money.

13
0:00:48.765,000 --> 0:00:51,000
You know, the story may seem real, but I bet it's incomplete.

14
0:00:52.648,000 --> 0:00:54,000
If you go investigate further,

15
0:00:54.725,000 --> 0:00:56,000
the guy has done 30 apps before

16
0:00:56.845,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and he has done a master's on the topic, a PhD.

17
0:00:59.719,000 --> 0:01:02,000
He has been working on the topic for 20 years.

18
0:01:03.822,000 --> 0:01:04,000
This is really interesting.

19
0:01:05.167,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I myself have a story in Brazil that people think is an overnight success.

20
0:01:10.796,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I come from a humble family,

21
0:01:13.052,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and two weeks before the deadline to apply for MIT,

22
0:01:16.547,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I started the application process.

23
0:01:18.819,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And, voilà! I got in.

24
0:01:21.732,000 --> 0:01:23,000
People may think it's an overnight success,

25
0:01:24.559,000 --> 0:01:28,000
but that only worked because for the 17 years prior to that,

26
0:01:28.905,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I took life and education seriously.

27
0:01:31.15,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Your overnight success story is always a result

28
0:01:34.617,000 --> 0:01:37,000
of everything you've done in your life through that moment.

29
0:01:38.712,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Two: Believe someone else has the answers for you.

30
0:01:42.465,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Constantly, people want to help out, right?

31
0:01:44.819,000 --> 0:01:47,000
All sorts of people: your family, your friends, your business partners,

32
0:01:48.188,000 --> 0:01:51,000
they all have opinions on which path you should take:

33
0:01:51.431,000 --> 0:01:53,000
"And let me tell you, go through this pipe."

34
0:01:53.697,000 --> 0:01:54,000
But whenever you go inside,

35
0:01:55.491,000 --> 0:01:57,000
there are other ways you have to pick as well.

36
0:01:58.244,000 --> 0:02:,000
And you need to make those decisions yourself.

37
0:02:01.42,000 --> 0:02:04,000
No one else has the perfect answers for your life.

38
0:02:05.301,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And you need to keep picking those decisions, right?

39
0:02:07.882,000 --> 0:02:09,000
The pipes are infinite and you're going to bump your head,

40
0:02:10.687,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and it's a part of the process.

41
0:02:13.806,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Three, and it's very subtle but very important:

42
0:02:18.004,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Decide to settle when growth is guaranteed.

43
0:02:20.705,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So when your life is going great,

44
0:02:22.756,000 --> 0:02:24,000
you have put together a great team,

45
0:02:25.091,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and you have growing revenue, and everything is set --

46
0:02:28.477,000 --> 0:02:29,000
time to settle.

47
0:02:30.478,000 --> 0:02:31,000
When I launched my first book,

48
0:02:32.023,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I worked really, really hard to distribute it everywhere in Brazil.

49
0:02:35.196,000 --> 0:02:37,000
With that, over three million people downloaded it,

50
0:02:37.616,000 --> 0:02:39,000
over 50,000 people bought physical copies.

51
0:02:40.332,000 --> 0:02:43,000
When I wrote a sequel, some impact was guaranteed.

52
0:02:44.6,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Even if I did little, sales would be OK.

53
0:02:48.204,000 --> 0:02:49,000
But OK is never OK.

54
0:02:50.138,000 --> 0:02:52,000
When you're growing towards a peak,

55
0:02:52.448,000 --> 0:02:55,000
you need to work harder than ever and find yourself another peak.

56
0:02:56.546,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Maybe if I did little,

57
0:02:58.262,000 --> 0:03:,000
a couple hundred thousand people would read it,

58
0:03:00.486,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and that's great already.

59
0:03:02.435,000 --> 0:03:03,000
But if I work harder than ever,

60
0:03:04.255,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I can bring this number up to millions.

61
0:03:07.383,000 --> 0:03:1,000
That's why I decided, with my new book, to go to every single state of Brazil.

62
0:03:11.12,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And I can already see a higher peak.

63
0:03:13.049,000 --> 0:03:14,000
There's no time to settle down.

64
0:03:15.238,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Fourth tip, and that's really important:

65
0:03:18.481,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Believe the fault is someone else's.

66
0:03:21.961,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I constantly see people saying,

67
0:03:24.157,000 --> 0:03:27,000
"Yes, I had this great idea, but no investor had the vision to invest."

68
0:03:28.146,000 --> 0:03:29,000
"Oh, I created this great product,

69
0:03:29.924,000 --> 0:03:32,000
but the market is so bad, the sales didn't go well."

70
0:03:33.834,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Or, "I can't find good talent; my team is so below expectations."

71
0:03:38.683,000 --> 0:03:39,000
If you have dreams,

72
0:03:40.216,000 --> 0:03:42,000
it's your responsibility to make them happen.

73
0:03:43.663,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Yes, it may be hard to find talent.

74
0:03:46.22,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Yes, the market may be bad.

75
0:03:48.321,000 --> 0:03:5,000
But if no one invested in your idea,

76
0:03:50.475,000 --> 0:03:51,000
if no one bought your product,

77
0:03:52.368,000 --> 0:03:54,000
for sure, there is something there that is your fault.

78
0:03:55.38,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Laughter)

79
0:03:57.405,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Definitely.

80
0:03:59.052,000 --> 0:04:01,000
You need to get your dreams and make them happen.

81
0:04:01.95,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And no one achieved their goals alone.

82
0:04:05.162,000 --> 0:04:09,000
But if you didn't make them happen, it's your fault and no one else's.

83
0:04:09.31,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Be responsible for your dreams.

84
0:04:13.019,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And one last tip, and this one is really important as well:

85
0:04:18.046,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Believe that the only things that matter are the dreams themselves.

86
0:04:22.892,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Once I saw an ad, and it was a lot of friends,

87
0:04:26.126,000 --> 0:04:28,000
they were going up a mountain, it was a very high mountain,

88
0:04:29.118,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and it was a lot of work.

89
0:04:30.384,000 --> 0:04:32,000
You could see that they were sweating and this was tough.

90
0:04:33.402,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And they were going up, and they finally made it to the peak.

91
0:04:36.778,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Of course, they decided to celebrate, right?

92
0:04:38.869,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I'm going to celebrate, so, "Yes! We made it, we're at the top!"

93
0:04:42.874,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Two seconds later, one looks at the other and says,

94
0:04:45.508,000 --> 0:04:46,000
"OK, let's go down."

95
0:04:47.446,000 --> 0:04:48,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:48.73,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Life is never about the goals themselves.

97
0:04:51.468,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Life is about the journey.

98
0:04:53.94,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Yes, you should enjoy the goals themselves,

99
0:04:56.301,000 --> 0:04:58,000
but people think that you have dreams,

100
0:04:59.146,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and whenever you get to reaching one of those dreams,

101
0:05:01.785,000 --> 0:05:04,000
it's a magical place where happiness will be all around.

102
0:05:05.851,000 --> 0:05:08,000
But achieving a dream is a momentary sensation,

103
0:05:09.272,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and your life is not.

104
0:05:11.211,000 --> 0:05:14,000
The only way to really achieve all of your dreams

105
0:05:14.521,000 --> 0:05:17,000
is to fully enjoy every step of your journey.

106
0:05:18.451,000 --> 0:05:19,000
That's the best way.

107
0:05:19.638,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And your journey is simple -- it's made of steps.

108
0:05:22.038,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Some steps will be right on.

109
0:05:23.992,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Sometimes you will trip.

110
0:05:26.228,000 --> 0:05:3,000
If it's right on, celebrate, because some people wait a lot to celebrate.

111
0:05:30.849,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And if you tripped, turn that into something to learn.

112
0:05:33.996,000 --> 0:05:38,000
If every step becomes something to learn or something to celebrate,

113
0:05:39.446,000 --> 0:05:41,000
you will for sure enjoy the journey.

114
0:05:42.071,000 --> 0:05:43,000
So, five tips:

115
0:05:43.797,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Believe in overnight success,

116
0:05:46.231,000 --> 0:05:48,000
believe someone else has the answers for you,

117
0:05:48.657,000 --> 0:05:51,000
believe that when growth is guaranteed, you should settle down,

118
0:05:51.683,000 --> 0:05:53,000
believe the fault is someone else's,

119
0:05:54.029,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and believe that only the goals themselves matter.

120
0:05:57.358,000 --> 0:06:,000
Believe me, you do that, and you will destroy your dreams.

121
0:06:00.386,000 --> 0:06:01,000
(Laughter)

122
0:06:01.617,000 --> 0:06:02,000
(Applause)

123
0:06:02.814,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Thank you.

124
0:06:04.695,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Thanks.

125
0:06:05.916,000 --> 0:06:09,000
(Applause)

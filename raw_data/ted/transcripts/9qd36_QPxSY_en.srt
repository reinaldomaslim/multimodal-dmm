1
0:00:12.874,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So many of you have probably seen the movie "The Martian."

2
0:00:16.961,000 --> 0:00:19,000
But for those of you who did not, it's a movie about an astronaut

3
0:00:20.802,000 --> 0:00:24,000
who is stranded on Mars, and his efforts to stay alive

4
0:00:25.369,000 --> 0:00:29,000
until the Earth can send a rescue mission to bring him back to Earth.

5
0:00:31.025,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Gladly, they do re-establish communication

6
0:00:34.188,000 --> 0:00:36,000
with the character, astronaut Watney, at some point

7
0:00:36.75,000 --> 0:00:41,000
so that he's not as alone on Mars until he can be rescued.

8
0:00:42.546,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So while you're watching the movie, or even if you haven't,

9
0:00:45.332,000 --> 0:00:46,000
when you think about Mars,

10
0:00:46.904,000 --> 0:00:5,000
you're probably thinking about how far away it is and how distant.

11
0:00:51.728,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And, what might not have occurred to you is,

12
0:00:54.331,000 --> 0:00:57,000
what are the logistics really like of working on another planet --

13
0:00:58.252,000 --> 0:01:,000
of living on two planets

14
0:01:00.522,000 --> 0:01:05,000
when there are people on the Earth and there are rovers or people on Mars?

15
0:01:06.38,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So think about when you have friends, families and co-workers

16
0:01:10.562,000 --> 0:01:13,000
in California, on the West Coast or in other parts of the world.

17
0:01:14.045,000 --> 0:01:16,000
When you're trying to communicate with them,

18
0:01:16.122,000 --> 0:01:18,000
one of the things you probably first think about is:

19
0:01:18.584,000 --> 0:01:2,000
wait, what time is it in California?

20
0:01:20.704,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Will I wake them up? Is it OK to call?

21
0:01:23.703,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So even if you're interacting with colleagues who are in Europe,

22
0:01:27.078,000 --> 0:01:29,000
you're immediately thinking about:

23
0:01:29.144,000 --> 0:01:36,000
What does it take to coordinate communication when people are far away?

24
0:01:36.793,000 --> 0:01:41,000
So we don't have people on Mars right now, but we do have rovers.

25
0:01:42.401,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And actually right now, on Curiosity, it is 6:10 in the morning.

26
0:01:47.53,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So, 6:10 in the morning on Mars.

27
0:01:50.696,000 --> 0:01:52,000
We have four rovers on Mars.

28
0:01:52.721,000 --> 0:01:56,000
The United States has put four rovers on Mars since the mid-1990s,

29
0:01:56.752,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and I have been privileged enough to work on three of them.

30
0:02:00.715,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So, I am a spacecraft engineer, a spacecraft operations engineer,

31
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Los Angeles, California.

32
0:02:10.676,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And these rovers are our robotic emissaries.

33
0:02:14.861,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So, they are our eyes and our ears, and they see the planet for us

34
0:02:21.163,000 --> 0:02:22,000
until we can send people.

35
0:02:23.02,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So we learn how to operate on other planets through these rovers.

36
0:02:28.337,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So before we send people, we send robots.

37
0:02:33.146,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So the reason there's a time difference on Mars right now,

38
0:02:37.121,000 --> 0:02:38,000
from the time that we're at

39
0:02:38.447,000 --> 0:02:41,000
is because the Martian day is longer than the Earth day.

40
0:02:42.774,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Our Earth day is 24 hours,

41
0:02:45.595,000 --> 0:02:48,000
because that's how long it takes the Earth to rotate,

42
0:02:48.993,000 --> 0:02:5,000
how long it takes to go around once.

43
0:02:51.018,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So our day is 24 hours.

44
0:02:53.306,000 --> 0:02:59,000
It takes Mars 24 hours and approximately 40 minutes to rotate once.

45
0:03:00.15,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So that means that the Martian day is 40 minutes longer than the Earth day.

46
0:03:07.027,000 --> 0:03:12,000
So teams of people who are operating the rovers on Mars, like this one,

47
0:03:12.206,000 --> 0:03:17,000
what we are doing is we are living on Earth, but working on Mars.

48
0:03:17.642,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So we have to think as if we are actually on Mars with the rover.

49
0:03:23.474,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Our job, the job of this team, of which I'm a part of,

50
0:03:27.077,000 --> 0:03:32,000
is to send commands to the rover to tell it what to do the next day.

51
0:03:33.03,000 --> 0:03:37,000
To tell it to drive or drill or tell her whatever she's supposed to do.

52
0:03:37.373,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So while she's sleeping -- and the rover does sleep at night

53
0:03:41.863,000 --> 0:03:43,000
because she needs to recharge her batteries

54
0:03:44.257,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and she needs to weather the cold Martian night.

55
0:03:48.177,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And so she sleeps.

56
0:03:49.563,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So while she sleeps, we work on her program for the next day.

57
0:03:54.677,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So I work the Martian night shift.

58
0:03:57.683,000 --> 0:03:58,000
(Laughter)

59
0:03:59.298,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So in order to come to work on the Earth at the same time every day on Mars --

60
0:04:05.95,000 --> 0:04:07,000
like, let's say I need to be at work at 5:00 p.m.,

61
0:04:08.378,000 --> 0:04:13,000
this team needs to be at work at 5:00 p.m. Mars time every day,

62
0:04:13.971,000 --> 0:04:2,000
then we have to come to work on the Earth 40 minutes later every day,

63
0:04:21.962,000 --> 0:04:23,000
in order to stay in sync with Mars.

64
0:04:24.165,000 --> 0:04:26,000
That's like moving a time zone every day.

65
0:04:27.141,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So one day you come in at 8:00, the next day 40 minutes later at 8:40,

66
0:04:32.62,000 --> 0:04:35,000
the next day 40 minutes later at 9:20,

67
0:04:35.913,000 --> 0:04:36,000
the next day at 10:00.

68
0:04:37.526,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So you keep moving 40 minutes every day,

69
0:04:41.128,000 --> 0:04:43,000
until soon you're coming to work in the middle of the night --

70
0:04:44.141,000 --> 0:04:45,000
the middle of the Earth night.

71
0:04:45.982,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Right? So you can imagine how confusing that is.

72
0:04:49.624,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Hence, the Mars watch.

73
0:04:51.8,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Laughter)

74
0:04:52.825,000 --> 0:04:55,000
This weights in this watch have been mechanically adjusted

75
0:04:56.367,000 --> 0:04:58,000
so that it runs more slowly.

76
0:04:58.919,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Right? And we didn't start out --

77
0:05:00.832,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I got this watch in 2004

78
0:05:03.082,000 --> 0:05:06,000
when Spirit and Opportunity, the rovers back then.

79
0:05:06.41,000 --> 0:05:07,000
We didn't start out thinking

80
0:05:08.04,000 --> 0:05:1,000
that we were going to need Mars watches.

81
0:05:10.495,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Right? We thought, OK, we'll just have the time on our computers

82
0:05:14.95,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and on the mission control screens, and that would be enough.

83
0:05:18.622,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Yeah, not so much.

84
0:05:20.027,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Because we weren't just working on Mars time,

85
0:05:22.9,000 --> 0:05:25,000
we were actually living on Mars time.

86
0:05:26.083,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And we got just instantaneously confused about what time it was.

87
0:05:30.39,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So you really needed something on your wrist to tell you:

88
0:05:34.207,000 --> 0:05:37,000
What time is it on the Earth? What time is it on Mars?

89
0:05:37.927,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And it wasn't just the time on Mars that was confusing;

90
0:05:43.845,000 --> 0:05:47,000
we also needed to be able to talk to each other about it.

91
0:05:49.157,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So a "sol" is a Martian day -- again, 24 hours and 40 minutes.

92
0:05:54.808,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So when we're talking about something that's happening on the Earth,

93
0:05:58.027,000 --> 0:05:59,000
we will say, today.

94
0:06:00.048,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So, for Mars, we say, "tosol."

95
0:06:02.904,000 --> 0:06:03,000
(Laughter)

96
0:06:05.812,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Yesterday became "yestersol" for Mars.

97
0:06:10.657,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Again, we didn't start out thinking, "Oh, let's invent a language."

98
0:06:15.188,000 --> 0:06:16,000
It was just very confusing.

99
0:06:16.502,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I remember somebody walked up to me and said,

100
0:06:18.707,000 --> 0:06:21,000
"I would like to do this activity on the vehicle tomorrow, on the rover."

101
0:06:22.164,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And I said, "Tomorrow, tomorrow, or Mars, tomorrow?"

102
0:06:27.807,000 --> 0:06:32,000
We started this terminology because we needed a way to talk to each other.

103
0:06:32.883,000 --> 0:06:33,000
(Laughter)

104
0:06:34.035,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Tomorrow became "nextersol" or "solorrow."

105
0:06:39.036,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Because people have different preferences for the words they use.

106
0:06:42.675,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Some of you might say "soda" and some of you might say "pop."

107
0:06:46.649,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So we have people who say "nextersol" or "solorrow."

108
0:06:50.382,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And then something that I noticed after a few years of working on these missions,

109
0:06:55.13,000 --> 0:06:59,000
was that the people who work on the rovers, we say "tosol."

110
0:07:00.246,000 --> 0:07:03,000
The people who work on the landed missions that don't rove around,

111
0:07:03.804,000 --> 0:07:04,000
they say "tosoul."

112
0:07:05.778,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So I could actually tell what mission you worked on from your Martian accent.

113
0:07:10.521,000 --> 0:07:13,000
(Laughter)

114
0:07:13.795,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So we have the watches and the language, and you're detecting a theme here, right?

115
0:07:17.679,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So that we don't get confused.

116
0:07:20.239,000 --> 0:07:23,000
But even the Earth daylight could confuse us.

117
0:07:24.489,000 --> 0:07:26,000
If you think that right now, you've come to work

118
0:07:26.852,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and it's the middle of the Martian night

119
0:07:28.971,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and there's light streaming in from the windows

120
0:07:32.293,000 --> 0:07:34,000
that's going to be confusing as well.

121
0:07:34.901,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So you can see from this image of the control room

122
0:07:37.43,000 --> 0:07:39,000
that all of the blinds are down.

123
0:07:39.723,000 --> 0:07:42,000
So that there's no light to distract us.

124
0:07:42.75,000 --> 0:07:46,000
The blinds went down all over the building about a week before landing,

125
0:07:47.126,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and they didn't go up until we went off Mars time.

126
0:07:50.847,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So this also works for the house, for at home.

127
0:07:54.052,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I've been on Mars time three times, and my husband is like,

128
0:07:56.849,000 --> 0:07:57,000
OK, we're getting ready for Mars time.

129
0:07:58.688,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And so he'll put foil all over the windows and dark curtains and shades

130
0:08:04.914,000 --> 0:08:07,000
because it also affects your families.

131
0:08:08.085,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And so here I was living in kind of this darkened environment, but so was he.

132
0:08:13.525,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And he'd gotten used to it.

133
0:08:14.845,000 --> 0:08:17,000
But then I would get these plaintive emails from him when he was at work.

134
0:08:19.077,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Should I come home? Are you awake?

135
0:08:22.393,000 --> 0:08:25,000
What time is it on Mars?

136
0:08:25.547,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And I decided, OK, so he needs a Mars watch.

137
0:08:28.069,000 --> 0:08:29,000
(Laughter)

138
0:08:29.628,000 --> 0:08:33,000
But of course, it's 2016, so there's an app for that.

139
0:08:34.086,000 --> 0:08:35,000
(Laughter)

140
0:08:35.388,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So now instead of the watches, we can also use our phones.

141
0:08:40.42,000 --> 0:08:44,000
But the impact on families was just across the board;

142
0:08:44.584,000 --> 0:08:47,000
it wasn't just those of us who were working on the rovers

143
0:08:48.27,000 --> 0:08:5,000
but our families as well.

144
0:08:50.508,000 --> 0:08:52,000
This is David Oh, one of our flight directors,

145
0:08:53.011,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and he's at the beach in Los Angeles with his family at 1:00 in the morning.

146
0:08:57.509,000 --> 0:08:58,000
(Laughter)

147
0:08:58.956,000 --> 0:09:,000
So because we landed in August

148
0:09:01.96,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and his kids didn't have to go back to school until September,

149
0:09:06.43,000 --> 0:09:1,000
they actually went on to Mars time with him for one month.

150
0:09:11.202,000 --> 0:09:15,000
They got up 40 minutes later every day.

151
0:09:15.995,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And they were on dad's work schedule.

152
0:09:18.202,000 --> 0:09:21,000
So they lived on Mars time for a month and had these great adventures,

153
0:09:22.201,000 --> 0:09:24,000
like going bowling in the middle of the night

154
0:09:24.322,000 --> 0:09:25,000
or going to the beach.

155
0:09:25.969,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And one of the things that we all discovered

156
0:09:29.352,000 --> 0:09:32,000
is you can get anywhere in Los Angeles

157
0:09:33.364,000 --> 0:09:36,000
at 3:00 in the morning when there's no traffic.

158
0:09:36.941,000 --> 0:09:37,000
(Laughter)

159
0:09:38.439,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So we would get off work,

160
0:09:39.655,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and we didn't want to go home and bother our families,

161
0:09:42.794,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and we were hungry, so instead of going locally to eat something,

162
0:09:46.008,000 --> 0:09:49,000
we'd go, "Wait, there's this great all-night deli in Long Beach,

163
0:09:49.596,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and we can get there in 10 minutes!"

164
0:09:51.862,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So we would drive down -- it was like the 60s, no traffic.

165
0:09:54.607,000 --> 0:09:57,000
We would drive down there, and the restaurant owners would go,

166
0:09:58.386,000 --> 0:10:,000
"Who are you people?

167
0:10:01.241,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And why are you at my restaurant at 3:00 in the morning?"

168
0:10:05.778,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So they came to realize that there were these packs of Martians,

169
0:10:11.481,000 --> 0:10:15,000
roaming the LA freeways, in the middle of the night --

170
0:10:17.108,000 --> 0:10:19,000
in the middle of the Earth night.

171
0:10:19.155,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And we did actually start calling ourselves Martians.

172
0:10:24.401,000 --> 0:10:29,000
So those of us who were on Mars time would refer to ourselves as Martians,

173
0:10:30.031,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and everyone else as Earthlings.

174
0:10:32.908,000 --> 0:10:33,000
(Laughter)

175
0:10:34.232,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And that's because when you're moving a time-zone every day,

176
0:10:39.951,000 --> 0:10:44,000
you start to really feel separated from everyone else.

177
0:10:45.788,000 --> 0:10:48,000
You're literally in your own world.

178
0:10:50.524,000 --> 0:10:56,000
So I have this button on that says, "I survived Mars time. Sol 0-90."

179
0:10:57.473,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And there's a picture of it up on the screen.

180
0:11:00.242,000 --> 0:11:05,000
So the reason we got these buttons is because we work on Mars time

181
0:11:05.895,000 --> 0:11:1,000
in order to be as efficient as possible with the rover on Mars,

182
0:11:10.968,000 --> 0:11:12,000
to make the best use of our time.

183
0:11:13.282,000 --> 0:11:16,000
But we don't stay on Mars time for more than three to four months.

184
0:11:17.192,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Eventually, we'll move to a modified Mars time, which is what we're working now.

185
0:11:22.199,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And that's because it's hard on your bodies, it's hard on your families.

186
0:11:26.88,000 --> 0:11:3,000
In fact, there were sleep researchers who actually were studying us

187
0:11:31.786,000 --> 0:11:36,000
because it was so unusual for humans to try to extend their day.

188
0:11:37.147,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And they had about 30 of us

189
0:11:38.461,000 --> 0:11:41,000
that they would do sleep deprivation experiments on.

190
0:11:42.111,000 --> 0:11:45,000
So I would come in and take the test and I fell asleep in each one.

191
0:11:45.698,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And that was because, again, this eventually becomes hard on your body.

192
0:11:52.364,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Even though it was a blast.

193
0:11:55.703,000 --> 0:11:59,000
It was a huge bonding experience with the other members on the team,

194
0:12:00.241,000 --> 0:12:02,000
but it is difficult to sustain.

195
0:12:04.063,000 --> 0:12:1,000
So these rover missions are our first steps out into the solar system.

196
0:12:10.272,000 --> 0:12:15,000
We are learning how to live on more than one planet.

197
0:12:15.369,000 --> 0:12:2,000
We are changing our perspective to become multi-planetary.

198
0:12:20.763,000 --> 0:12:22,000
So the next time you see a Star Wars movie,

199
0:12:23.582,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and there are people going from the Dagobah system to Tatooine,

200
0:12:27.281,000 --> 0:12:32,000
think about what it really means to have people spread out so far.

201
0:12:32.795,000 --> 0:12:35,000
What it means in terms of the distances between them,

202
0:12:35.881,000 --> 0:12:38,000
how they will start to feel separate from each other

203
0:12:39.725,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and just the logistics of the time.

204
0:12:43.757,000 --> 0:12:47,000
We have not sent people to Mars yet, but we hope to.

205
0:12:48.333,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And between companies like SpaceX and NASA

206
0:12:52.196,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and all of the international space agencies of the world,

207
0:12:55.709,000 --> 0:12:58,000
we hope to do that in the next few decades.

208
0:12:59.5,000 --> 0:13:04,000
So soon we will have people on Mars, and we truly will be multi-planetary.

209
0:13:05.82,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And the young boy or the young girl

210
0:13:08.256,000 --> 0:13:15,000
who will be going to Mars could be in this audience or listening today.

211
0:13:16.021,000 --> 0:13:21,000
I have wanted to work at JPL on these missions since I was 14 years old

212
0:13:21.647,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and I am privileged to be a part of it.

213
0:13:23.893,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And this is a remarkable time in the space program,

214
0:13:27.971,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and we are all in this journey together.

215
0:13:31.169,000 --> 0:13:36,000
So the next time you think you don't have enough time in your day,

216
0:13:36.404,000 --> 0:13:4,000
just remember, it's all a matter of your Earthly perspective.

217
0:13:41.206,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Thank you.

218
0:13:42.381,000 --> 0:13:46,000
(Applause)

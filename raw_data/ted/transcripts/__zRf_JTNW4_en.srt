1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Come with me to the bottom of the world,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Antarctica,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
the highest, driest, windiest,

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and yes, coldest region on Earth --

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
more arid than the Sahara

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and, in parts, colder than Mars.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
The ice of Antarctica glows

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
with a light so dazzling,

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
it blinds the unprotected eye.

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Early explorers rubbed cocaine in their eyes

11
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
to kill the pain of it.

12
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
The weight of the ice is such that the entire continent

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
sags below sea level, beneath its weight.

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Yet, the ice of Antarctica

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
is a calendar of climate change.

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
It records the annual rise and fall

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
of greenhouse gases and temperatures

18
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
going back before the onset of the last ice ages.

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Nowhere on Earth

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
offers us such a perfect record.

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And here, scientists are drilling

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
into the past of our planet

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
to find clues to the future

24
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
of climate change.

25
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
This past January,

26
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I traveled to a place called WAIS Divide,

27
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
about 600 miles from the South Pole.

28
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
It is the best place on the planet, many say,

29
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
to study the history of climate change.

30
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
There, about 45 scientists from the University of Wisconsin,

31
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
the Desert Research Institute in Nevada and others

32
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
have been working to answer a central question

33
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
about global warming.

34
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
What is the exact relationship

35
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
between levels of greenhouse gases

36
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and planetary temperatures?

37
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
It's urgent work. We know that temperatures are rising.

38
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
This past May was the warmest worldwide on record.

39
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And we know that levels of greenhouse gases are rising too.

40
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
What we don't know

41
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
is the exact, precise, immediate

42
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
impact of these changes

43
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
on natural climate patterns --

44
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
winds, ocean currents,

45
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
precipitation rates, cloud formation,

46
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
things that bear on the health and well-being

47
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
of billions of people.

48
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Their entire camp, every item of gear,

49
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
was ferried 885 miles

50
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
from McMurdo Station,

51
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
the main U.S. supply base

52
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
on the coast of Antarctica.

53
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
WAIS Divide itself though,

54
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
is a circle of tents in the snow.

55
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
In blizzard winds, the crew sling ropes between the tents

56
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
so that people can feel their way safely

57
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
to the nearest ice house

58
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and to the nearest outhouse.

59
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
It snows so heavily there,

60
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
the installation was almost immediately buried.

61
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Indeed, the researchers picked this site

62
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
because ice and snow accumulates here

63
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
10 times faster than anywhere else in Antarctica.

64
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
They have to dig themselves out every day.

65
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
It makes for an exotic

66
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and chilly commute.

67
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
(Laughter)

68
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
But under the surface

69
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
is a hive of industrial activity

70
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
centered around an eight-million-dollar drill assembly.

71
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Periodically, this drill, like a biopsy needle,

72
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
plunges thousands of feet deep into the ice

73
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
to extract a marrow of gases

74
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and isotopes for analysis.

75
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Ten times a day, they extract

76
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
the 10-foot long cylinder of compressed ice crystals

77
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that contain the unsullied air and trace chemicals

78
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
laid down by snow,

79
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
season after season for thousands of years.

80
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It's really a time machine.

81
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
At the peak of activity earlier this year,

82
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
the researchers lowered the drill

83
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
an extra hundred feet deeper into the ice every day

84
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and another 365 years

85
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
deeper into the past.

86
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Periodically, they remove

87
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
a cylinder of ice,

88
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
like gamekeepers popping a spent shotgun shell

89
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
from the barrel of a drill.

90
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
They inspect it, they check it for cracks,

91
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
for drill damage, for spalls, for chips.

92
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
More importantly,

93
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
they prepare it for inspection and analysis

94
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
by 27 independent laboratories

95
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
in the United States and Europe,

96
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
who will examine it for 40 different trace chemicals

97
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
related to climate,

98
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
some in parts per quadrillion.

99
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Yes, I said that with a Q, quadrillion.

100
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
They cut the cylinders up into three-foot sections

101
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
for easier handling and shipment

102
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
back to these labs,

103
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
some 8,000 miles from the drill site.

104
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Each cylinder

105
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
is a parfait of time.

106
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
This ice formed as snow

107
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
15,800 years ago,

108
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
when our ancestors were daubing themselves with paint

109
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and considering the radical new technology

110
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
of the alphabet.

111
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Bathed in polarized light

112
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and cut in cross-section,

113
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
this ancient ice reveals itself

114
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
as a mosaic of colors,

115
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
each one showing how conditions at depth in the ice

116
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
have affected this material

117
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
at depths where pressures can reach

118
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
a ton per square inch.

119
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Every year, it begins with a snowflake,

120
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and by digging into fresh snow,

121
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
we can see how this process is ongoing today.

122
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
This wall of undisturbed snow,

123
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
back-lit by sunlight,

124
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
shows the striations of winter and summer snow,

125
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
layer upon layer.

126
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Each storm scours the atmosphere,

127
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
washing out dust, soot,

128
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
trace chemicals,

129
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and depositing them on the snow pack

130
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
year after year,

131
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
millennia after millennia,

132
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
creating a kind of periodic table of elements

133
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
that at this point

134
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
is more than 11,000 feet thick.

135
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
From this, we can detect an extraordinary number of things.

136
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
We can see the calcium

137
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
from the world's deserts,

138
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
soot from distant wildfires,

139
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
methane as an indicator of the strength of a Pacific monsoon,

140
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
all wafted on winds from warmer latitudes

141
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to this remote and very cold place.

142
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Most importantly,

143
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
these cylinders and this snow

144
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
trap air.

145
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Each cylinder is about 10 percent ancient air,

146
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
a pristine time capsule

147
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
of greenhouse gases -- carbon dioxide,

148
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
methane, nitrous oxide --

149
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
all unchanged from the day that snow formed

150
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and first fell.

151
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And this is the object of their scrutiny.

152
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
But don't we already know

153
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
what we need to know about greenhouse gases?

154
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Why do we need to study this anymore?

155
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Don't we already know how they affect temperatures?

156
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Don't we already know the consequences

157
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
of a changing climate on our settled civilization?

158
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
The truth is, we only know the outlines,

159
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and what we don't completely understand,

160
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
we can't properly fix.

161
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Indeed, we run the risk of making things worse.

162
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Consider, the single most successful

163
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
international environmental effort of the 20th century,

164
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
the Montreal Protocol,

165
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
in which the nations of Earth banded together to protect the planet

166
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
from the harmful effects of ozone-destroying chemicals

167
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
used at that time

168
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
in air conditioners, refrigerators and other cooling devices.

169
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
We banned those chemicals,

170
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and we replaced them, unknowingly,

171
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
with other substances

172
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
that, molecule per molecule,

173
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
are a hundred times more potent

174
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
as heat-trapping, greenhouse gases

175
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
than carbon dioxide.

176
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
This process requires

177
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
extraordinary precautions.

178
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
The scientists must insure

179
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that the ice is not contaminated.

180
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Moreover, in this 8,000-mile journey,

181
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
they have to insure this ice doesn't melt.

182
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics.

183
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
They have to, in fact,

184
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
make sure this ice never gets warmer

185
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
than about 20 degrees below zero,

186
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
otherwise, the key gases inside it will dissipate.

187
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
So, in the coldest place on Earth,

188
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
they work inside a refrigerator.

189
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
As they handle the ice, in fact,

190
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
they keep an extra pair of gloves warming in an oven,

191
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
so that, when their work gloves freeze

192
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and their fingers stiffen,

193
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
they can don a fresh pair.

194
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
They work against the clock and against the thermometer.

195
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
So far, they've packed up

196
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
about 4,500 feet of ice cores

197
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
for shipment back to the United States.

198
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
This past season,

199
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
they manhandled them across the ice

200
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
to waiting aircraft.

201
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
The 109th Air National Guard

202
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
flew the most recent shipment of ice

203
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
back to the coast of Antarctica,

204
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
where it was boarded onto a freighter,

205
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
shipped across the tropics to California,

206
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
unloaded, put on a truck,

207
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
driven across the desert

208
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
to the National Ice Core Laboratory in Denver, Colorado,

209
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
where, as we speak,

210
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
scientists are now slicing this material up

211
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
for samples, for analysis,

212
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
to be distributed

213
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to the laboratories around the country

214
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and in Europe.

215
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
Antarctica was this planet's

216
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
last empty quarter --

217
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
the blind spot

218
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
in our expanding vision of the world.

219
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Early explorers

220
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
sailed off the edge of the map,

221
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and they found a place

222
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
where the normal rules of time and temperature

223
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
seem suspended.

224
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Here, the ice seems a living presence.

225
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
The wind that rubs against it

226
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
gives it voice.

227
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
It is a voice of experience.

228
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
It is a voice we should heed.

229
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Thank you.

230
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
(Applause)

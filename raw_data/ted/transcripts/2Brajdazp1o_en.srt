1
0:00:12.691,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Whenever I get to travel for work,

2
0:00:14.794,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I try to find out where my drinking water comes from,

3
0:00:17.326,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and where my poop and pee go.

4
0:00:19.017,000 --> 0:00:2,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:20.885,000 --> 0:00:23,000
This has earned me the nickname "The Poo Princess" in my family,

6
0:00:23.936,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and it's ruined many family vacations, because this is not normal.

7
0:00:28.612,000 --> 0:00:33,000
But thinking about where it all goes is the first step in activating

8
0:00:33.897,000 --> 0:00:35,000
what are actually superpowers in our poop and pee.

9
0:00:36.736,000 --> 0:00:37,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:37.836,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Yeah.

11
0:00:39.014,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And if we use them well,

12
0:00:40.196,000 --> 0:00:42,000
we can live healthier and more beautifully.

13
0:00:42.371,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Check out this landscape in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

14
0:00:46.771,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Just notice what kinds of words and feelings come to mind.

15
0:00:51.588,000 --> 0:00:54,000
This landscape was watered with treated sewage water.

16
0:00:55.892,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Does that change anything for you?

17
0:00:58.458,000 --> 0:01:,000
I imagine it might.

18
0:01:02.191,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And that's OK.

19
0:01:04.897,000 --> 0:01:06,000
How we feel about this

20
0:01:07.118,000 --> 0:01:1,000
is going to determine exactly how innovative we can be.

21
0:01:10.589,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And I want to explain how it works,

22
0:01:14.675,000 --> 0:01:15,000
but what words do I use?

23
0:01:17.471,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I mean, I can use profane words like "shit" and "piss,"

24
0:01:21.147,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and then my grandma won't watch the video.

25
0:01:23.451,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Or I can use childish words like "poo" and "pee." Eh.

26
0:01:27.252,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Or I can use scientific words like "excrement" and "feces." Humph.

27
0:01:31.994,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I'll use a mix.

28
0:01:33.285,000 --> 0:01:34,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:34.649,000 --> 0:01:37,000
It's all I got. (Laughs)

30
0:01:37.678,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So, in this suburb,

31
0:01:39.195,000 --> 0:01:42,000
the poo and the pee and the wash water are going to this treatment plant

32
0:01:43.144,000 --> 0:01:45,000
right in the middle of the community.

33
0:01:45.285,000 --> 0:01:47,000
It looks more like a park than a treatment plant.

34
0:01:47.97,000 --> 0:01:5,000
The poo at the very bottom of all those layers of gravel --

35
0:01:51.38,000 --> 0:01:52,000
not touching anyone --

36
0:01:52.92,000 --> 0:01:54,000
is providing solid food for those marsh plants.

37
0:01:56.238,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And the clean, clear water that comes out the other end

38
0:01:59.543,000 --> 0:02:02,000
is traveling underground to water each person's yard.

39
0:02:03.328,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So even though they're in a desert,

40
0:02:05.047,000 --> 0:02:06,000
they get their own personal oasis.

41
0:02:07.963,000 --> 0:02:1,000
This approach is called Integrated Water Management,

42
0:02:11.199,000 --> 0:02:13,000
or holistic or closed-loop.

43
0:02:14.071,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Whatever you want to call it,

44
0:02:15.612,000 --> 0:02:18,000
it's in conflict with the status quo of how we think about sanitation,

45
0:02:19.271,000 --> 0:02:22,000
which is contain, treat, push it away.

46
0:02:23.239,000 --> 0:02:25,000
But in this approach, we're doing one step better.

47
0:02:25.609,000 --> 0:02:27,000
We're designing for reuse from the very beginning,

48
0:02:27.995,000 --> 0:02:29,000
because everything does get reused,

49
0:02:30.587,000 --> 0:02:32,000
only now we're planning for it.

50
0:02:32.765,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And often, that makes for really beautiful spaces.

51
0:02:37.042,000 --> 0:02:41,000
But the most important thing about this system

52
0:02:41.131,000 --> 0:02:42,000
isn't the technicals of how it works.

53
0:02:43.812,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It's how you feel about it.

54
0:02:46.002,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Do you want this in your yard?

55
0:02:48.507,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Why not?

56
0:02:50.368,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I got really curious about this question.

57
0:02:53.111,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Why don't we see more innovation in sanitation?

58
0:02:56.475,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Why isn't that kind of thing the new normal?

59
0:02:59.61,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And I care so much about this question,

60
0:03:01.814,000 --> 0:03:03,000
that I work for a nonprofit called Recode.

61
0:03:03.997,000 --> 0:03:04,000
We want to accelerate adoption

62
0:03:05.925,000 --> 0:03:07,000
of sustainable building and development practices.

63
0:03:08.721,000 --> 0:03:09,000
We want more innovation.

64
0:03:12.274,000 --> 0:03:15,000
But a lot of times, whole categories of innovation --

65
0:03:15.375,000 --> 0:03:17,000
ones that can help us live more beautifully --

66
0:03:18.197,000 --> 0:03:19,000
turn out to be illegal.

67
0:03:20.728,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Today's regulations and codes were written under the assumption

68
0:03:24.204,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that best practices would remain best practices,

69
0:03:28.242,000 --> 0:03:3,000
with incremental updates forever and ever.

70
0:03:31.387,000 --> 0:03:33,000
But innovation isn't always incremental.

71
0:03:34.285,000 --> 0:03:37,000
It turns out, how we feel about any particular new technique

72
0:03:37.79,000 --> 0:03:38,000
gets into everything we do:

73
0:03:39.663,000 --> 0:03:4,000
how we talk about it,

74
0:03:40.957,000 --> 0:03:41,000
how we encourage people to study,

75
0:03:42.807,000 --> 0:03:43,000
our jokes, our codes ...

76
0:03:44.754,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And it ultimately determines how innovative we can be.

77
0:03:48.503,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So, that's the first reason we don't innovate in sanitation.

78
0:03:53.079,000 --> 0:03:56,000
We're kind of uncomfortable talking about sanitation,

79
0:03:56.416,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that's why I've gotten called "The Poo Princess" so much.

80
0:03:59.142,000 --> 0:04:,000
The second reason is:

81
0:04:00.857,000 --> 0:04:02,000
we think the problem is solved here in the US.

82
0:04:03.833,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But not so.

83
0:04:05.087,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Here in the US we still get sick from drinking shit in our sewage water.

84
0:04:10.699,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Seven million people get sick every year,

85
0:04:12.868,000 --> 0:04:13,000
900 die annually.

86
0:04:14.663,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And we're not taking a holistic approach to making it better.

87
0:04:19.125,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So we're not solving it.

88
0:04:21.749,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Where I live in Portland, Oregon,

89
0:04:23.448,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I can't take Echo for a swim during the rainy season,

90
0:04:26.275,000 --> 0:04:29,000
because we dump raw sewage sometimes into our river.

91
0:04:29.905,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Our rainwater and our sewage go to the same treatment plant.

92
0:04:33.904,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Too much rain overflows into the river.

93
0:04:37.53,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And Portland is not alone here.

94
0:04:39.569,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Forty percent of municipalities self-report

95
0:04:42.683,000 --> 0:04:45,000
dumping raw or partially treated sewage into our waterways.

96
0:04:47.442,000 --> 0:04:5,000
The other bummer going on here with our status quo

97
0:04:50.624,000 --> 0:04:54,000
is that half of all of your poop and pee is going to fertilize farmland.

98
0:04:55.819,000 --> 0:04:57,000
The other half is being incinerated

99
0:04:58.209,000 --> 0:04:59,000
or land-filled.

100
0:04:59.447,000 --> 0:05:,000
And that's a bummer to me,

101
0:05:00.979,000 --> 0:05:02,000
because there are amazing nutrients in your daily doody.

102
0:05:03.965,000 --> 0:05:05,000
It is comparable to pig manure;

103
0:05:06.155,000 --> 0:05:08,000
we're omnivores, they're omnivores.

104
0:05:09.24,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Think of your poo and pee as a health smoothie for a tree.

105
0:05:12.647,000 --> 0:05:15,000
(Laughter)

106
0:05:17.357,000 --> 0:05:18,000
The other bummer going on here

107
0:05:19.19,000 --> 0:05:23,000
is that we're quickly moving all the drugs we take into our waterways.

108
0:05:23.971,000 --> 0:05:27,000
The average wastewater treatment plant can remove maybe half of the drugs

109
0:05:28.226,000 --> 0:05:29,000
that come in.

110
0:05:29.91,000 --> 0:05:31,000
The other half goes right out the other side.

111
0:05:32.564,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Consider what a cocktail of pharmaceuticals --

112
0:05:36.044,000 --> 0:05:38,000
hormones, steroids, Vicodin --

113
0:05:38.089,000 --> 0:05:39,000
does to a fish,

114
0:05:39.896,000 --> 0:05:4,000
to a dog,

115
0:05:41.142,000 --> 0:05:42,000
to a child.

116
0:05:44.322,000 --> 0:05:47,000
But this isn't just some problem that we need to contain.

117
0:05:48.215,000 --> 0:05:5,000
If we flip this around, we can create a resource

118
0:05:50.637,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that can solve so many of our other problems.

119
0:05:53.758,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And I want to get you comfortable with this idea,

120
0:05:56.162,000 --> 0:06:,000
so imagine the things I'm going to show you, these technologies,

121
0:06:00.335,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and this attitude that says,

122
0:06:02.348,000 --> 0:06:03,000
"We're going to reuse this.

123
0:06:03.72,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Let's design to make it beautiful" --

124
0:06:05.958,000 --> 0:06:06,000
as advanced potty training.

125
0:06:07.515,000 --> 0:06:08,000
(Laughter)

126
0:06:08.562,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I think you're ready for it.

127
0:06:10.312,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I think we as a culture are ready for advanced potty training.

128
0:06:14.527,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And there are three great reasons to enroll today.

129
0:06:17.03,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Number one:

130
0:06:19.094,000 --> 0:06:2,000
we can fertilize our food.

131
0:06:21.016,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Each one of us is pooping and peeing something

132
0:06:23.552,000 --> 0:06:25,000
that could fertilize half or maybe all of our food,

133
0:06:26.315,000 --> 0:06:27,000
depending on our diet.

134
0:06:29.06,000 --> 0:06:32,000
That dark brown poo in the toilet is dark brown because of what?

135
0:06:32.359,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Dead stuff, bacteria.

136
0:06:34.249,000 --> 0:06:35,000
That's carbon.

137
0:06:35.424,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And carbon, if we're getting that into the soil,

138
0:06:37.754,000 --> 0:06:4,000
is going to bind to the other minerals and nutrients in there.

139
0:06:41.187,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Boom! Healthier food.

140
0:06:43.443,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Voilà! Healthier people.

141
0:06:46.325,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Chemical fertilizers by definition don't have carbon in them.

142
0:06:51.221,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Imagine if we could move our animal manure and our human manure to our soil,

143
0:06:56.608,000 --> 0:06:59,000
we might not need to rely on fossil fuel-based fertilizers,

144
0:07:00.438,000 --> 0:07:01,000
mine minerals from far away.

145
0:07:03.395,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Imagine how much energy we could save.

146
0:07:07.23,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Now, some of us are concerned

147
0:07:10.314,000 --> 0:07:13,000
about industrial pollutants contaminating this reuse cycle.

148
0:07:15.322,000 --> 0:07:16,000
That can be addressed.

149
0:07:17.445,000 --> 0:07:21,000
But we need to separate our discomfort about talking about poo and pee

150
0:07:22.403,000 --> 0:07:26,000
so we can calmly talk about how we want to reuse it

151
0:07:26.791,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and what things we don't want to reuse.

152
0:07:29.456,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And get this:

153
0:07:31.598,000 --> 0:07:33,000
if we change our approach to sanitation,

154
0:07:34.417,000 --> 0:07:36,000
we can start to slow down climate change.

155
0:07:38.234,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Remember that carbon in the poop?

156
0:07:40.8,000 --> 0:07:42,000
If we can get that into our soil bank,

157
0:07:43.489,000 --> 0:07:47,000
it's going to start to absorb carbon dioxide that we put into the air.

158
0:07:48.154,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And that could help slow down global warming.

159
0:07:51.397,000 --> 0:07:53,000
I want to show you some brave souls

160
0:07:53.928,000 --> 0:07:57,000
who've had the courage to embrace this advanced potty training approach.

161
0:07:59.028,000 --> 0:08:,000
So those folks in New Mexico --

162
0:08:00.743,000 --> 0:08:01,000
why did they do it?

163
0:08:02.735,000 --> 0:08:04,000
'Cause they're in a desert? 'Cause they save money? Yeah.

164
0:08:05.842,000 --> 0:08:07,000
But more importantly, they felt comfortable

165
0:08:10.217,000 --> 0:08:12,000
seeing what was going down the toilet as a resource.

166
0:08:13.642,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Here's an average house in Portland, Oregon.

167
0:08:15.762,000 --> 0:08:17,000
This house is special because they have a composting toilet

168
0:08:18.723,000 --> 0:08:22,000
turning all their poo and pee, over time, into a soil amendment.

169
0:08:23.547,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Their wash water, their shower water, is going underground

170
0:08:26.465,000 --> 0:08:27,000
to a series of mulch basins,

171
0:08:29.127,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and then watering that orchard downhill.

172
0:08:32.392,000 --> 0:08:33,000
When they went to get this permitted,

173
0:08:34.901,000 --> 0:08:35,000
it wasn't allowed in Oregon.

174
0:08:37.222,000 --> 0:08:39,000
But it was allowed in five other states nearby.

175
0:08:40.322,000 --> 0:08:44,000
That was Recode's -- my organization's -- first code-change campaign.

176
0:08:46.158,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Here's a great example where the Integrated Water Management approach

177
0:08:50.644,000 --> 0:08:51,000
was the cheapest.

178
0:08:52.108,000 --> 0:08:56,000
This is three high-rise residential buildings in downtown Portland,

179
0:08:56.728,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and they're not flushing to the sewer system.

180
0:08:59.332,000 --> 0:09:,000
How?

181
0:09:00.515,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Well, their wash water is getting reused to flush toilets,

182
0:09:04.461,000 --> 0:09:05,000
cool mechanical systems,

183
0:09:06.152,000 --> 0:09:07,000
water the landscape.

184
0:09:08.028,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And then once the building has thoroughly used everything --

185
0:09:10.906,000 --> 0:09:11,000
aka, shat in it --

186
0:09:12.453,000 --> 0:09:16,000
it's treated to highest standard right on-site by plants and bacteria,

187
0:09:17.099,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and then infiltrated into the groundwater right below.

188
0:09:21.371,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And all that was cheaper

189
0:09:24.898,000 --> 0:09:26,000
than updating the surrounding sewer infrastructure.

190
0:09:28.553,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So that's the last reason we should get really excited

191
0:09:31.115,000 --> 0:09:32,000
about doing things differently:

192
0:09:32.631,000 --> 0:09:34,000
we can save a lot of money.

193
0:09:36.085,000 --> 0:09:38,000
This was the first permit of its kind in Oregon.

194
0:09:39.597,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Brave and open-minded people sat down and felt comfortable saying,

195
0:09:44.41,000 --> 0:09:45,000
"Yeah, that shit makes sense."

196
0:09:45.934,000 --> 0:09:47,000
(Laughter)

197
0:09:48.426,000 --> 0:09:49,000
"Let's do it."

198
0:09:49.691,000 --> 0:09:5,000
(Applause)

199
0:09:50.716,000 --> 0:09:51,000
You know?

200
0:09:51.891,000 --> 0:09:53,000
I keep showing examples

201
0:09:54.064,000 --> 0:09:56,000
where everyone's reusing everything on-site.

202
0:09:56.246,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Why?

203
0:09:57.421,000 --> 0:10:,000
Well, when we look at our aging infrastructure -- and it is old --

204
0:10:00.719,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and we look at the cost of updating it,

205
0:10:02.646,000 --> 0:10:06,000
three-quarters of that cost is just the pipes snaking through our city.

206
0:10:07.666,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So as we build anew, as we renovate,

207
0:10:09.869,000 --> 0:10:13,000
it might make more sense to treat and reuse everything on-site.

208
0:10:15.499,000 --> 0:10:17,000
San Francisco realized that it made sense

209
0:10:18.094,000 --> 0:10:2,000
to invest in rebates for every household

210
0:10:20.792,000 --> 0:10:22,000
to reuse their wash water and their rainwater

211
0:10:23.349,000 --> 0:10:24,000
to water the backyard,

212
0:10:25.006,000 --> 0:10:29,000
because the amount of water they would save as a community would be so big.

213
0:10:30.261,000 --> 0:10:32,000
But why were all these projects so innovative?

214
0:10:33.434,000 --> 0:10:34,000
The money piece, yeah.

215
0:10:35.963,000 --> 0:10:36,000
But more importantly,

216
0:10:37.638,000 --> 0:10:4,000
they felt comfortable with this idea of advanced potty training.

217
0:10:41.572,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Imagine if we embraced innovation for sanitation

218
0:10:46.624,000 --> 0:10:49,000
the way we have for, say, solar power.

219
0:10:50.565,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Think about it -- solar power used to be uncommon and unaffordable.

220
0:10:54.144,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Now it's more a part of our web of power than ever before.

221
0:10:57.721,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And it's creating resiliency.

222
0:11:00.13,000 --> 0:11:02,000
We now have sources of power like the sun

223
0:11:02.988,000 --> 0:11:04,000
that don't vary with our earthly dramas.

224
0:11:06.282,000 --> 0:11:08,000
What's driving all that innovation?

225
0:11:09.002,000 --> 0:11:1,000
It's us.

226
0:11:10.4,000 --> 0:11:12,000
We're talking about energy.

227
0:11:12.447,000 --> 0:11:14,000
It's cool to talk about energy.

228
0:11:16.032,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Some folks are even talking about the problems

229
0:11:18.207,000 --> 0:11:21,000
with the limited resources where our current energy is coming from.

230
0:11:21.397,000 --> 0:11:25,000
We encourage our best and brightest to work on this issue --

231
0:11:25.485,000 --> 0:11:28,000
better solar panels, better batteries, everything.

232
0:11:30.099,000 --> 0:11:33,000
So let's talk about where our drinking water is coming from,

233
0:11:33.233,000 --> 0:11:35,000
where our poo and pee are actually going.

234
0:11:36.344,000 --> 0:11:4,000
If we can get over this discomfort with this entire topic,

235
0:11:41.308,000 --> 0:11:44,000
we could create something that creates our future goldmine.

236
0:11:45.158,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Every time you flush the toilet,

237
0:11:46.803,000 --> 0:11:47,000
I want you to think,

238
0:11:48.446,000 --> 0:11:5,000
"Where is my poop and pee going?

239
0:11:50.494,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Will they be gainfully employed?"

240
0:11:52.421,000 --> 0:11:53,000
(Laughter)

241
0:11:53.697,000 --> 0:11:56,000
"Or are they going to be wreaking havoc in some waterway?"

242
0:11:56.899,000 --> 0:11:57,000
If you don't know, find out.

243
0:11:58.826,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And if you don't like the answer,

244
0:12:00.628,000 --> 0:12:03,000
figure out how you can communicate to those who can drive this change

245
0:12:04.379,000 --> 0:12:08,000
that you have advanced potty training, that you are ready for reuse.

246
0:12:08.415,000 --> 0:12:1,000
How all of you feel

247
0:12:10.866,000 --> 0:12:13,000
is going to determine exactly how innovative we can be.

248
0:12:14.191,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Thank you so much.

249
0:12:15.374,000 --> 0:12:2,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Have you ever watched a baby learning to crawl?

2
0:00:16.52,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Because as any parent knows, it's gripping.

3
0:00:19.2,000 --> 0:00:2,000
First, they wriggle about on the floor,

4
0:00:21.12,000 --> 0:00:22,000
usually backwards,

5
0:00:22.36,000 --> 0:00:24,000
but then they drag themselves forwards,

6
0:00:24.4,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and then they pull themselves up to stand,

7
0:00:27.32,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and we all clap.

8
0:00:29.2,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And that simple motion of forwards and upwards,

9
0:00:33.2,000 --> 0:00:36,000
it's the most basic direction of progress we humans recognize.

10
0:00:38.4,000 --> 0:00:4,000
We tell it in our story of evolution as well,

11
0:00:40.84,000 --> 0:00:44,000
from our lolloping ancestors to Homo erectus, finally upright,

12
0:00:44.88,000 --> 0:00:47,000
to Homo sapiens, depicted, always a man,

13
0:00:48.36,000 --> 0:00:49,000
always mid-stride.

14
0:00:51.48,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So no wonder we so readily believe

15
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
that economic progress will take this very same shape,

16
0:00:57.92,000 --> 0:00:59,000
this ever-rising line of growth.

17
0:01:02.4,000 --> 0:01:04,000
It's time to think again,

18
0:01:04.72,000 --> 0:01:06,000
to reimagine the shape of progress,

19
0:01:08.36,000 --> 0:01:11,000
because today, we have economies

20
0:01:11.76,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that need to grow, whether or not they make us thrive,

21
0:01:16.56,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and what we need, especially in the richest countries,

22
0:01:20.52,000 --> 0:01:22,000
are economies that make us thrive

23
0:01:22.96,000 --> 0:01:23,000
whether or not they grow.

24
0:01:24.92,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Yes, it's a little flippant word

25
0:01:27.04,000 --> 0:01:3,000
hiding a profound shift in mindset,

26
0:01:30.36,000 --> 0:01:32,000
but I believe this is the shift we need to make

27
0:01:33.04,000 --> 0:01:37,000
if we, humanity, are going to thrive here together this century.

28
0:01:38.6,000 --> 0:01:41,000
So where did this obsession with growth come from?

29
0:01:41.64,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Well, GDP, gross domestic product,

30
0:01:43.76,000 --> 0:01:45,000
it's just the total cost of goods and services

31
0:01:46.36,000 --> 0:01:48,000
sold in an economy in a year.

32
0:01:48.52,000 --> 0:01:49,000
It was invented in the 1930s,

33
0:01:50.08,000 --> 0:01:53,000
but it very soon became the overriding goal of policymaking,

34
0:01:54.08,000 --> 0:01:57,000
so much so that even today, in the richest of countries,

35
0:01:57.84,000 --> 0:01:59,000
governments think that the solution to their economic problems

36
0:02:00.8,000 --> 0:02:01,000
lies in more growth.

37
0:02:03.72,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Just how that happened

38
0:02:05.6,000 --> 0:02:1,000
is best told through the 1960 classic by W.W. Rostow.

39
0:02:10.72,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I love it so much, I have a first-edition copy.

40
0:02:16.6,000 --> 0:02:2,000
"The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto."

41
0:02:21.44,000 --> 0:02:22,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:23.2,000 --> 0:02:25,000
You can just smell the politics, huh?

43
0:02:25.96,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And Rostow tells us that all economies

44
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:3,000
need to pass through five stages of growth:

45
0:02:30.44,000 --> 0:02:33,000
first, traditional society, where a nation's output is limited

46
0:02:34.04,000 --> 0:02:37,000
by its technology, its institutions and mindset;

47
0:02:37.08,000 --> 0:02:39,000
but then the preconditions for takeoff,

48
0:02:39.76,000 --> 0:02:41,000
where we get the beginnings of a banking industry,

49
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
the mechanization of work

50
0:02:43.44,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and the belief that growth is necessary for something beyond itself,

51
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
like national dignity or a better life for the children;

52
0:02:51.2,000 --> 0:02:56,000
then takeoff, where compound interest is built into the economy's institutions

53
0:02:57.04,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and growth becomes the normal condition;

54
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:03,000
fourth is the drive to maturity where you can have any industry you want,

55
0:03:03.72,000 --> 0:03:05,000
no matter your natural resource base;

56
0:03:05.76,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and the fifth and final stage, the age of high-mass consumption

57
0:03:10.2,000 --> 0:03:12,000
where people can buy all the consumer goods they want,

58
0:03:12.8,000 --> 0:03:14,000
like bicycles and sewing machines --

59
0:03:14.92,000 --> 0:03:15,000
this was 1960, remember.

60
0:03:17.96,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Well, you can hear the implicit airplane metaphor in this story,

61
0:03:23.56,000 --> 0:03:25,000
but this plane is like no other,

62
0:03:27.2,000 --> 0:03:29,000
because it can never be allowed to land.

63
0:03:30.56,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Rostow left us flying into the sunset of mass consumerism,

64
0:03:35.44,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and he knew it.

65
0:03:37.28,000 --> 0:03:38,000
As he wrote,

66
0:03:39.88,000 --> 0:03:41,000
"And then the question beyond,

67
0:03:43.24,000 --> 0:03:46,000
where history offers us only fragments.

68
0:03:47.44,000 --> 0:03:52,000
What to do when the increase in real income itself loses its charm?"

69
0:03:54.72,000 --> 0:03:57,000
He asked that question, but he never answered it, and here's why.

70
0:03:58.08,000 --> 0:03:59,000
The year was 1960,

71
0:03:59.64,000 --> 0:04:02,000
he was an advisor to the presidential candidate John F. Kennedy,

72
0:04:03.44,000 --> 0:04:06,000
who was running for election on the promise of five-percent growth,

73
0:04:07.4,000 --> 0:04:09,000
so Rostow's job was to keep that plane flying,

74
0:04:09.92,000 --> 0:04:13,000
not to ask if, how, or when it could ever be allowed to land.

75
0:04:16.44,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So here we are, flying into the sunset of mass consumerism

76
0:04:20.04,000 --> 0:04:21,000
over half a century on,

77
0:04:22.44,000 --> 0:04:27,000
with economies that have come to expect, demand and depend upon

78
0:04:27.48,000 --> 0:04:28,000
unending growth,

79
0:04:29.079,000 --> 0:04:32,000
because we're financially, politically and socially addicted to it.

80
0:04:34.96,000 --> 0:04:37,000
We're financially addicted to growth, because today's financial system

81
0:04:38.28,000 --> 0:04:41,000
is designed to pursue the highest rate of monetary return,

82
0:04:41.6,000 --> 0:04:44,000
putting publicly traded companies under constant pressure

83
0:04:45.12,000 --> 0:04:48,000
to deliver growing sales, growing market share and growing profits,

84
0:04:48.48,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and because banks create money as debt bearing interest,

85
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:53,000
which must be repaid with more.

86
0:04:54.2,000 --> 0:04:55,000
We're politically addicted to growth

87
0:04:55.96,000 --> 0:04:57,000
because politicians want to raise tax revenue

88
0:04:58.12,000 --> 0:04:59,000
without raising taxes

89
0:04:59.56,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and a growing GDP seems a sure way to do that.

90
0:05:02.68,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And no politician wants to lose their place in the G-20 family photo.

91
0:05:06.28,000 --> 0:05:07,000
(Laughter)

92
0:05:07.52,000 --> 0:05:1,000
But if their economy stops growing while the rest keep going,

93
0:05:11.24,000 --> 0:05:14,000
well, they'll be booted out by the next emerging powerhouse.

94
0:05:14.6,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And we are socially addicted to growth,

95
0:05:16.8,000 --> 0:05:19,000
because thanks to a century of consumer propaganda,

96
0:05:20.64,000 --> 0:05:23,000
which fascinatingly was created by Edward Bernays,

97
0:05:23.88,000 --> 0:05:25,000
the nephew of Sigmund Freud,

98
0:05:26.6,000 --> 0:05:29,000
who realized that his uncle's psychotherapy

99
0:05:29.64,000 --> 0:05:32,000
could be turned into very lucrative retail therapy

100
0:05:32.92,000 --> 0:05:36,000
if we could be convinced to believe that we transform ourselves

101
0:05:37.12,000 --> 0:05:39,000
every time we buy something more.

102
0:05:41.08,000 --> 0:05:44,000
None of these addictions are insurmountable,

103
0:05:44.28,000 --> 0:05:48,000
but they all deserve far more attention than they currently get,

104
0:05:48.48,000 --> 0:05:5,000
because look where this journey has been taking us.

105
0:05:50.92,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Global GDP is 10 times bigger than it was in 1950

106
0:05:55.28,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and that increase has brought prosperity to billions of people,

107
0:05:59.36,000 --> 0:06:04,000
but the global economy has also become incredibly divisive,

108
0:06:04.56,000 --> 0:06:06,000
with the vast share of returns to wealth

109
0:06:06.68,000 --> 0:06:1,000
now accruing to a fraction of the global one percent.

110
0:06:10.88,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And the economy has become incredibly degenerative,

111
0:06:14.56,000 --> 0:06:18,000
rapidly destabilizing this delicately balanced planet

112
0:06:19.36,000 --> 0:06:2,000
on which all of our lives depend.

113
0:06:22.4,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Our politicians know it, and so they offer new destinations for growth.

114
0:06:26.12,000 --> 0:06:28,000
You can have green growth, inclusive growth,

115
0:06:28.24,000 --> 0:06:29,000
smart, resilient, balanced growth.

116
0:06:30.24,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Choose any future you want so long as you choose growth.

117
0:06:35.28,000 --> 0:06:39,000
I think it's time to choose a higher ambition, a far bigger one,

118
0:06:4,000 --> 0:06:44,000
because humanity's 21st century challenge is clear:

119
0:06:44.48,000 --> 0:06:46,000
to meet the needs of all people

120
0:06:47.28,000 --> 0:06:51,000
within the means of this extraordinary, unique, living planet

121
0:06:51.8,000 --> 0:06:54,000
so that we and the rest of nature can thrive.

122
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Progress on this goal isn't going to be measured with the metric of money.

123
0:06:59.68,000 --> 0:07:01,000
We need a dashboard of indicators.

124
0:07:02.04,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And when I sat down to try and draw a picture of what that might look like,

125
0:07:06.48,000 --> 0:07:08,000
strange though this is going to sound,

126
0:07:08.8,000 --> 0:07:1,000
it came out looking like a doughnut.

127
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I know, I'm sorry,

128
0:07:13.4,000 --> 0:07:15,000
but let me introduce you to the one doughnut

129
0:07:15.72,000 --> 0:07:17,000
that might actually turn out to be good for us.

130
0:07:18.08,000 --> 0:07:21,000
So imagine humanity's resource use radiating out from the middle.

131
0:07:21.32,000 --> 0:07:22,000
That hole in the middle is a place

132
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:25,000
where people are falling short on life's essentials.

133
0:07:25.48,000 --> 0:07:29,000
They don't have the food, health care, education, political voice, housing

134
0:07:29.64,000 --> 0:07:32,000
that every person needs for a life of dignity and opportunity.

135
0:07:33.48,000 --> 0:07:36,000
We want to get everybody out of the hole, over the social foundation

136
0:07:36.72,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and into that green doughnut itself.

137
0:07:39.72,000 --> 0:07:41,000
But, and it's a big but,

138
0:07:43.48,000 --> 0:07:47,000
we cannot let our collective resource use overshoot that outer circle,

139
0:07:48.08,000 --> 0:07:49,000
the ecological ceiling,

140
0:07:49.52,000 --> 0:07:52,000
because there we put so much pressure on this extraordinary planet

141
0:07:53.36,000 --> 0:07:55,000
that we begin to kick it out of kilter.

142
0:07:55.56,000 --> 0:07:57,000
We cause climate breakdown, we acidify the oceans,

143
0:07:58.56,000 --> 0:08:,000
a hole in the ozone layer,

144
0:08:00.64,000 --> 0:08:03,000
pushing ourselves beyond the planetary boundaries

145
0:08:03.84,000 --> 0:08:07,000
of the life-supporting systems that have for the last 11,000 years

146
0:08:08.52,000 --> 0:08:11,000
made earth such a benevolent home to humanity.

147
0:08:13.12,000 --> 0:08:15,000
So this double-sided challenge to meet the needs of all

148
0:08:15.76,000 --> 0:08:16,000
within the means of the planet,

149
0:08:17.28,000 --> 0:08:19,000
it invites a new shape of progress,

150
0:08:19.56,000 --> 0:08:21,000
no longer this ever-rising line of growth,

151
0:08:22.56,000 --> 0:08:24,000
but a sweet spot for humanity,

152
0:08:25.52,000 --> 0:08:29,000
thriving in dynamic balance between the foundation and the ceiling.

153
0:08:30.08,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And I was really struck once I'd drawn this picture

154
0:08:32.72,000 --> 0:08:36,000
to realize that the symbol of well-being in many ancient cultures

155
0:08:37.04,000 --> 0:08:4,000
reflects this very same sense of dynamic balance,

156
0:08:40.64,000 --> 0:08:41,000
from the Maori Takarangi

157
0:08:42.56,000 --> 0:08:44,000
to the Taoist Yin Yang, the Buddhist endless knot,

158
0:08:44.96,000 --> 0:08:45,000
the Celtic double spiral.

159
0:08:47.919,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So can we find this dynamic balance in the 21st century?

160
0:08:52.64,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Well, that's a key question,

161
0:08:54.2,000 --> 0:08:58,000
because as these red wedges show, right now we are far from balanced,

162
0:08:58.88,000 --> 0:09:01,000
falling short and overshooting at the same time.

163
0:09:02.08,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Look in that hole, you can see that millions or billions of people worldwide

164
0:09:05.68,000 --> 0:09:07,000
still fall short on their most basic of needs.

165
0:09:09.2,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And yet, we've already overshot at least four of these planetary boundaries,

166
0:09:13.64,000 --> 0:09:16,000
risking irreversible impact of climate breakdown

167
0:09:17.24,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and ecosystem collapse.

168
0:09:20.4,000 --> 0:09:23,000
This is the state of humanity and our planetary home.

169
0:09:24.6,000 --> 0:09:26,000
We, the people of the early 21st century,

170
0:09:28.52,000 --> 0:09:29,000
this is our selfie.

171
0:09:31.8,000 --> 0:09:33,000
No economist from last century saw this picture,

172
0:09:34.36,000 --> 0:09:36,000
so why would we imagine that their theories

173
0:09:36.44,000 --> 0:09:37,000
would be up for taking on its challenges?

174
0:09:38.44,000 --> 0:09:39,000
We need ideas of our own,

175
0:09:39.88,000 --> 0:09:41,000
because we are the first generation to see this

176
0:09:42.6,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and probably the last with a real chance of turning this story around.

177
0:09:47.12,000 --> 0:09:5,000
You see, 20th century economics assured us that if growth creates inequality,

178
0:09:51.08,000 --> 0:09:52,000
don't try to redistribute,

179
0:09:52.6,000 --> 0:09:54,000
because more growth will even things up again.

180
0:09:54.84,000 --> 0:09:55,000
If growth creates pollution,

181
0:09:56.68,000 --> 0:09:59,000
don't try to regulate, because more growth will clean things up again.

182
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Except, it turns out, it doesn't,

183
0:10:04.2,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and it won't.

184
0:10:05.68,000 --> 0:10:09,000
We need to create economies that tackle this shortfall and overshoot together,

185
0:10:09.88,000 --> 0:10:1,000
by design.

186
0:10:11.44,000 --> 0:10:15,000
We need economies that are regenerative and distributive by design.

187
0:10:16.04,000 --> 0:10:18,000
You see, we've inherited degenerative industries.

188
0:10:18.76,000 --> 0:10:21,000
We take earth's materials, make them into stuff we want,

189
0:10:21.88,000 --> 0:10:24,000
use it for a while, often only once, and then throw it away,

190
0:10:25.52,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and that is pushing us over planetary boundaries,

191
0:10:28.24,000 --> 0:10:3,000
so we need to bend those arrows around,

192
0:10:30.76,000 --> 0:10:34,000
create economies that work with and within the cycles of the living world,

193
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:38,000
so that resources are never used up but used again and again,

194
0:10:38.08,000 --> 0:10:39,000
economies that run on sunlight,

195
0:10:40.08,000 --> 0:10:43,000
where waste from one process is food for the next.

196
0:10:43.64,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And this kind of regenerative design is popping up everywhere.

197
0:10:47.52,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Over a hundred cities worldwide, from Quito to Oslo,

198
0:10:50.96,000 --> 0:10:51,000
from Harare to Hobart,

199
0:10:52.84,000 --> 0:10:55,000
already generate more than 70 percent of their electricity

200
0:10:56.32,000 --> 0:10:58,000
from sun, wind and waves.

201
0:10:58.72,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Cities like London, Glasgow, Amsterdam are pioneering circular city design,

202
0:11:03.84,000 --> 0:11:06,000
finding ways to turn the waste from one urban process

203
0:11:07,000 --> 0:11:08,000
into food for the next.

204
0:11:08.8,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And from Tigray, Ethiopia to Queensland, Australia,

205
0:11:13.12,000 --> 0:11:17,000
farmers and foresters are regenerating once-barren landscapes

206
0:11:17.36,000 --> 0:11:19,000
so that it teems with life again.

207
0:11:20.68,000 --> 0:11:22,000
But as well as being regenerative by design,

208
0:11:22.8,000 --> 0:11:25,000
our economies must be distributive by design,

209
0:11:26.28,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and we've got unprecedented opportunities for making that happen,

210
0:11:30.56,000 --> 0:11:33,000
because 20th-century centralized technologies,

211
0:11:33.84,000 --> 0:11:34,000
institutions,

212
0:11:35.36,000 --> 0:11:4,000
concentrated wealth, knowledge and power in few hands.

213
0:11:40.64,000 --> 0:11:43,000
This century, we can design our technologies and institutions

214
0:11:44.28,000 --> 0:11:48,000
to distribute wealth, knowledge and empowerment to many.

215
0:11:48.56,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Instead of fossil fuel energy and large-scale manufacturing,

216
0:11:52.32,000 --> 0:11:56,000
we've got renewable energy networks, digital platforms and 3D printing.

217
0:11:57.92,000 --> 0:12:01,000
200 years of corporate control of intellectual property is being upended

218
0:12:02.48,000 --> 0:12:05,000
by the bottom-up, open-source, peer-to-peer knowledge commons.

219
0:12:06.24,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And corporations that still pursue maximum rate of return

220
0:12:09.72,000 --> 0:12:11,000
for their shareholders,

221
0:12:12.04,000 --> 0:12:14,000
well they suddenly look rather out of date

222
0:12:14.36,000 --> 0:12:16,000
next to social enterprises that are designed to generate

223
0:12:17.32,000 --> 0:12:2,000
multiple forms of value and share it with those throughout their networks.

224
0:12:22.48,000 --> 0:12:24,000
If we can harness today's technologies,

225
0:12:25.2,000 --> 0:12:27,000
from AI to blockchain

226
0:12:27.92,000 --> 0:12:29,000
to the Internet of Things to material science,

227
0:12:30.12,000 --> 0:12:34,000
if we can harness these in service of distributive design,

228
0:12:34.44,000 --> 0:12:38,000
we can ensure that health care, education, finance, energy, political voice

229
0:12:39.4,000 --> 0:12:42,000
reaches and empowers those people who need it most.

230
0:12:43.84,000 --> 0:12:46,000
You see, regenerative and distributive design

231
0:12:46.88,000 --> 0:12:49,000
create extraordinary opportunities for the 21st-century economy.

232
0:12:51.4,000 --> 0:12:54,000
So where does this leave Rostow's airplane ride?

233
0:12:54.6,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Well, for some it still carries the hope of endless green growth,

234
0:12:58.08,000 --> 0:13:01,000
the idea that thanks to dematerialization,

235
0:13:01.4,000 --> 0:13:05,000
exponential GDP growth can go on forever while resource use keeps falling.

236
0:13:06.84,000 --> 0:13:09,000
But look at the data. This is a flight of fancy.

237
0:13:10.68,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Yes, we need to dematerialize our economies,

238
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:17,000
but this dependency on unending growth cannot be decoupled from resource use

239
0:13:17.44,000 --> 0:13:19,000
on anything like the scale required

240
0:13:19.84,000 --> 0:13:21,000
to bring us safely back within planetary boundaries.

241
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:26,000
I know this way of thinking about growth is unfamiliar,

242
0:13:26.84,000 --> 0:13:28,000
because growth is good, no?

243
0:13:28.92,000 --> 0:13:3,000
We want our children to grow, our gardens to grow.

244
0:13:31.88,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Yes, look to nature and growth is a wonderful, healthy source of life.

245
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
It's a phase, but many economies like Ethiopia and Nepal today

246
0:13:40.4,000 --> 0:13:41,000
may be in that phase.

247
0:13:41.8,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Their economies are growing at seven percent a year.

248
0:13:45.6,000 --> 0:13:46,000
But look again to nature,

249
0:13:47.48,000 --> 0:13:51,000
because from your children's feet to the Amazon forest,

250
0:13:51.6,000 --> 0:13:52,000
nothing in nature grows forever.

251
0:13:53.56,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Things grow, and they grow up and they mature,

252
0:13:56.64,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and it's only by doing so

253
0:13:58.44,000 --> 0:14:01,000
that they can thrive for a very long time.

254
0:14:03.84,000 --> 0:14:04,000
We already know this.

255
0:14:05.52,000 --> 0:14:07,000
If I told you my friend went to the doctor

256
0:14:08.36,000 --> 0:14:09,000
who told her she had a growth

257
0:14:12.36,000 --> 0:14:13,000
that feels very different,

258
0:14:14.08,000 --> 0:14:18,000
because we intuitively understand that when something tries to grow forever

259
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
within a healthy, living, thriving system,

260
0:14:22.56,000 --> 0:14:23,000
it's a threat to the health of the whole.

261
0:14:25.48,000 --> 0:14:27,000
So why would we imagine that our economies

262
0:14:27.76,000 --> 0:14:29,000
would be the one system that could buck this trend

263
0:14:30.48,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and succeed by growing forever?

264
0:14:33.56,000 --> 0:14:37,000
We urgently need financial, political and social innovations

265
0:14:38.32,000 --> 0:14:42,000
that enable us to overcome this structural dependency on growth,

266
0:14:42.92,000 --> 0:14:45,000
so that we can instead focus on thriving and balance

267
0:14:48.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
within the social and the ecological boundaries of the doughnut.

268
0:14:53.32,000 --> 0:14:58,000
And if the mere idea of boundaries makes you feel, well, bounded,

269
0:14:59.04,000 --> 0:15:,000
think again.

270
0:15:00.84,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Because the world's most ingenious people

271
0:15:03.64,000 --> 0:15:06,000
turn boundaries into the source of their creativity.

272
0:15:07.4,000 --> 0:15:1,000
From Mozart on his five-octave piano

273
0:15:10.44,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Jimi Hendrix on his six-string guitar,

274
0:15:13.2,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Serena Williams on a tennis court,

275
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
it's boundaries that unleash our potential.

276
0:15:20.24,000 --> 0:15:25,000
And the doughnut's boundaries unleash the potential for humanity to thrive

277
0:15:25.56,000 --> 0:15:29,000
with boundless creativity, participation, belonging and meaning.

278
0:15:32.52,000 --> 0:15:36,000
It's going to take all the ingenuity that we have got to get there,

279
0:15:37.28,000 --> 0:15:38,000
so bring it on.

280
0:15:38.92,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Thank you.

281
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
(Applause)

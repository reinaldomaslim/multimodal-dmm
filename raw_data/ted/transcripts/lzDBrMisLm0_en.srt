1
0:00:12.485,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Good morning.

2
0:00:13.669,000 --> 0:00:14,000
My name is David Rose.

3
0:00:14.953,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I am a serial entrepreneur turned serial investor.

4
0:00:18.533,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And by the use of pitching PowerPoints to VCs,

5
0:00:22.153,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I have personally raised tens of millions of dollars

6
0:00:24.653,000 --> 0:00:26,000
from VCs through PowerPoint pitches.

7
0:00:27.547,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And turning to the other side of the equation,

8
0:00:29.749,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I've personally supervised the investment of tens of millions of dollars

9
0:00:33.189,000 --> 0:00:36,000
into companies who have pitched me with PowerPoint presentations.

10
0:00:36.28,000 --> 0:00:37,000
So I think it's safe to say

11
0:00:37.629,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I know a little bit about the process of pitching.

12
0:00:40.305,000 --> 0:00:42,000
So, the very first question you've got to figure out is:

13
0:00:42.961,000 --> 0:00:45,000
What is the single most important thing that a VC is looking for

14
0:00:46.643,000 --> 0:00:49,000
when you come to them pitching your new business idea?

15
0:00:49.785,000 --> 0:00:51,000
There are obviously all kinds of things --

16
0:00:51.814,000 --> 0:00:53,000
business models and financials and markets and this and that.

17
0:00:54.72,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Overall, of all the things that you have to do,

18
0:00:56.95,000 --> 0:00:57,000
what is the single most important thing

19
0:00:58.881,000 --> 0:00:59,000
the VC is going to be investing in?

20
0:01:01.903,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Somebody? What?

21
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Audience: People!

22
0:01:04.662,000 --> 0:01:07,000
David Rose: People! You! That's it -- you are the person.

23
0:01:08.065,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Therefore, the entire purpose of a VC pitch is to convince them

24
0:01:11.965,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that you are the entrepreneur in whom they are going to invest their money

25
0:01:15.583,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and make a lot of money in return.

26
0:01:17.497,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Now, how do you do this?

27
0:01:18.688,000 --> 0:01:19,000
You can't just walk up and say,

28
0:01:20.212,000 --> 0:01:23,000
"Hi, I'm a really good guy, good girl, and you should invest in me." Right?

29
0:01:24.18,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So in the course of your VC pitch -- you have a very few minutes;

30
0:01:27.778,000 --> 0:01:3,000
most VC pitches, angel pitches, are about 15 minutes,

31
0:01:30.915,000 --> 0:01:32,000
most should be less than half an hour --

32
0:01:33.359,000 --> 0:01:35,000
people's attention span, after 18 minutes, begins to drop off.

33
0:01:36.301,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Tests have shown.

34
0:01:37.476,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So in that 18 or 10 or five minutes,

35
0:01:39.695,000 --> 0:01:41,000
you have to convey a whole bunch of different characteristics,

36
0:01:42.655,000 --> 0:01:44,000
about 10 different characteristics,

37
0:01:44.741,000 --> 0:01:45,000
while you're standing up there.

38
0:01:46.258,000 --> 0:01:49,000
What's the single most important thing you've got to convey? What?

39
0:01:49.896,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Audience: Integrity.

40
0:01:51.114,000 --> 0:01:52,000
DR: Boy, oh boy, oh boy!

41
0:01:52.337,000 --> 0:01:53,000
That's a straight line, look at that!

42
0:01:54.147,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And I didn't even prompt him.

43
0:01:55.568,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Right, integrity. The key thing.

44
0:01:57.52,000 --> 0:02:,000
I would much rather invest in, take a chance on,

45
0:02:00.552,000 --> 0:02:03,000
somebody who I know is straight than where there's any possible question

46
0:02:04.203,000 --> 0:02:06,000
of who are they looking out for, and what's going on.

47
0:02:06.725,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So the most important thing is integrity.

48
0:02:08.733,000 --> 0:02:1,000
What's the second most important thing?

49
0:02:10.851,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Let's see if you can get this one.

50
0:02:12.501,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Audience: Self-confidence.

51
0:02:13.831,000 --> 0:02:14,000
DR: Close enough. Passion.

52
0:02:15.878,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Right? Entrepreneurs, by definition, are people who are leaving something else,

53
0:02:19.715,000 --> 0:02:22,000
starting a new world, creating and putting their lifeblood into this thing.

54
0:02:23.421,000 --> 0:02:24,000
You've got to convey passion.

55
0:02:24.83,000 --> 0:02:25,000
If you're not passionate,

56
0:02:26.157,000 --> 0:02:29,000
why should anyone else be, or put money into your company

57
0:02:29.333,000 --> 0:02:3,000
if you're not passionate about it?

58
0:02:31.048,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Integrity, passion: the most important things.

59
0:02:33.38,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Then there's a whole panoply of other things you've got to wrap up

60
0:02:36.585,000 --> 0:02:38,000
in this package you're presenting to a VC.

61
0:02:38.799,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Experience: you've got to be able to say,

62
0:02:40.877,000 --> 0:02:42,000
"Hey, you know, I've done this before."

63
0:02:43.059,000 --> 0:02:46,000
"Done this before" is starting an enterprise, creating value,

64
0:02:46.119,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and taking something from beginning to end.

65
0:02:48.152,000 --> 0:02:5,000
That's why VCs love to fund serial entrepreneurs --

66
0:02:50.691,000 --> 0:02:52,000
even if you didn't do it right the first time,

67
0:02:52.867,000 --> 0:02:55,000
you've learned the lessons, which puts you in good stead the next time.

68
0:02:56.23,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Along with the experience of starting an enterprise or running something --

69
0:02:59.807,000 --> 0:03:,000
doesn't have to be a business,

70
0:03:01.277,000 --> 0:03:03,000
it can be an organization in a school, a not-for-profit.

71
0:03:04.007,000 --> 0:03:06,000
But experience in creating an organization.

72
0:03:06.085,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Next: knowledge.

73
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
If you tell me

74
0:03:08.435,000 --> 0:03:11,000
you're going to be the developer of the map of the human genome,

75
0:03:11.49,000 --> 0:03:14,000
you better know what a human genome is; I want you to have expertise.

76
0:03:14.904,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I don't want somebody who says,

77
0:03:16.413,000 --> 0:03:18,000
"I've got a great idea in a business I know nothing about.

78
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I don't know who the players are, what the market is like."

79
0:03:21.963,000 --> 0:03:23,000
You've got to know your market, your area.

80
0:03:24.003,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And you have to have the skills that it takes

81
0:03:26.13,000 --> 0:03:27,000
to get a company going.

82
0:03:27.304,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Those skills include everything from technical skills

83
0:03:30.401,000 --> 0:03:31,000
if it's a technology business,

84
0:03:32.147,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to marketing and sales and management and so on.

85
0:03:34.945,000 --> 0:03:36,000
But, you know, not everybody has all these skills.

86
0:03:37.651,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Very few people have the full set of skills it takes to run a company.

87
0:03:41.37,000 --> 0:03:43,000
What else do you require? Well, leadership.

88
0:03:43.421,000 --> 0:03:46,000
You've got to be able to convince us that you either have developed a team

89
0:03:46.951,000 --> 0:03:48,000
that has all those factors in it, or else you can.

90
0:03:49.799,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And you have the charisma and the management style

91
0:03:52.254,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and the ability to get people to follow your lead,

92
0:03:55.057,000 --> 0:03:58,000
to inspire them, to motivate them to be part of your team.

93
0:03:58.369,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Having done all that,

94
0:03:59.941,000 --> 0:04:,000
what else do I want to know as a VC?

95
0:04:01.686,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I want to know that you have commitment.

96
0:04:03.805,000 --> 0:04:04,000
That you are going to be here to the end.

97
0:04:05.79,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I want you to say -- or I want you to convey --

98
0:04:08.436,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that you are going to die if you have to, with your very last breath,

99
0:04:12.084,000 --> 0:04:14,000
your fingernails scratching as they draw you out.

100
0:04:14.434,000 --> 0:04:16,000
You'll keep my money alive and make more from it.

101
0:04:16.934,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I don't want someone who'll cut and run at the first opportunity.

102
0:04:20.016,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Bad things happen.

103
0:04:21.191,000 --> 0:04:24,000
There's never been a venture-funded company where bad things didn't happen.

104
0:04:24.756,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So know that you're committed to the very end.

105
0:04:26.925,000 --> 0:04:28,000
You've got to have vision to see where this is going.

106
0:04:29.545,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I don't want another "me too" product.

107
0:04:31.382,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I want somebody who can change the world out there.

108
0:04:33.832,000 --> 0:04:34,000
But on top of that, I need realism,

109
0:04:35.528,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Because while changing the world is great, it doesn't always happen.

110
0:04:39.709,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And before you get to change the world,

111
0:04:41.662,000 --> 0:04:42,000
bad things are going to take place;

112
0:04:43.357,000 --> 0:04:44,000
you have to deal with that.

113
0:04:44.709,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And you have to have rational projections.

114
0:04:46.738,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Finally, you're asking for my money --

115
0:04:48.681,000 --> 0:04:5,000
not just because it's my money, but because it's me.

116
0:04:51.139,000 --> 0:04:52,000
You need to be coachable.

117
0:04:52.359,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I need to know you have the ability to listen.

118
0:04:54.534,000 --> 0:04:55,000
We've had a lot of experience.

119
0:04:55.998,000 --> 0:04:58,000
People who are VCs or angels investing in you have had experience,

120
0:04:59.301,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and they'd like to know that you want to hear that experience.

121
0:05:02.325,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So how do you convey these 10 things in 10 minutes without saying them?

122
0:05:05.705,000 --> 0:05:07,000
You can't say, "I've got integrity, invest in me!"

123
0:05:08.104,000 --> 0:05:11,000
You've got to do a whole pitch that conveys this without conveying it.

124
0:05:11.45,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Think about your pitch as a timeline.

125
0:05:13.241,000 --> 0:05:14,000
It starts off, you walk in the door.

126
0:05:15.147,000 --> 0:05:16,000
They know nothing whatsoever about you.

127
0:05:17.05,000 --> 0:05:2,000
You can take them on an emotional -- all pitches, all sales presentations,

128
0:05:20.705,000 --> 0:05:21,000
are emotional at some level.

129
0:05:22.095,000 --> 0:05:23,000
You can go up, you can go down, right?

130
0:05:24.015,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And it goes from beginning to end.

131
0:05:25.663,000 --> 0:05:27,000
You walk in, the first thing you've got to do,

132
0:05:27.837,000 --> 0:05:3,000
the overall arc of your presentation, it's got to start like a rocket.

133
0:05:31.231,000 --> 0:05:32,000
You've got maybe 10 seconds --

134
0:05:32.99,000 --> 0:05:35,000
between 10 and 30 seconds, depending on how long the pitch is --

135
0:05:36.174,000 --> 0:05:37,000
to get their attention.

136
0:05:37.722,000 --> 0:05:38,000
In my case, I've invested.

137
0:05:39.192,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I've gotten millions of dollars from PowerPoint pitches.

138
0:05:42.01,000 --> 0:05:44,000
"I've invested millions." That should get you right there.

139
0:05:44.893,000 --> 0:05:46,000
This can be a fact or something counterintuitive.

140
0:05:47.231,000 --> 0:05:48,000
It can be a story or an experience.

141
0:05:48.954,000 --> 0:05:51,000
But you've got to grab their emotional attention, focused on you,

142
0:05:52.062,000 --> 0:05:53,000
within that first few seconds.

143
0:05:53.562,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And then from there, you've got to take them

144
0:05:55.654,000 --> 0:05:58,000
on a very solid, steady, upward path, right from beginning to end.

145
0:05:59.542,000 --> 0:06:,000
Everything has to reinforce this.

146
0:06:01.159,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And you've got to get better and better and better,

147
0:06:03.584,000 --> 0:06:04,000
revving up to the very end,

148
0:06:04.98,000 --> 0:06:05,000
then you've got to -- boom! --

149
0:06:06.511,000 --> 0:06:07,000
knock them out of the park.

150
0:06:07.837,000 --> 0:06:09,000
You want to get them to such an emotional high

151
0:06:10.02,000 --> 0:06:12,000
they're ready to write you a check, throw money at you,

152
0:06:12.624,000 --> 0:06:13,000
before you leave.

153
0:06:13.799,000 --> 0:06:14,000
How do you do that?

154
0:06:14.974,000 --> 0:06:15,000
First of all, logical progression.

155
0:06:16.812,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Any time you go backwards, any time you skip a step --

156
0:06:20.195,000 --> 0:06:23,000
imagine walking up a staircase where some of the treads are missing,

157
0:06:23.421,000 --> 0:06:24,000
or the heights are different.

158
0:06:25.161,000 --> 0:06:27,000
You stop, you need to figure out a nice, logical progression.

159
0:06:28.078,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Start with what the market is: Why are you going to do X, Y or Z?

160
0:06:31.326,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And then you've got to tell me how you're going to do it,

161
0:06:34.041,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and what you're going to do.

162
0:06:35.59,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And it's got to flow from beginning to end.

163
0:06:37.779,000 --> 0:06:39,000
You've got to let me know there are touchstones,

164
0:06:40.089,000 --> 0:06:42,000
to tie in to the rest of the world out there.

165
0:06:42.263,000 --> 0:06:45,000
For example, reference companies I've heard of,

166
0:06:45.585,000 --> 0:06:47,000
or basic items in your business.

167
0:06:48.141,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I want to know about things that I can relate to:

168
0:06:50.918,000 --> 0:06:53,000
validators, or anything that tells me somebody else has approved this,

169
0:06:54.639,000 --> 0:06:55,000
or there's outside validation.

170
0:06:56.366,000 --> 0:06:59,000
It can be sales; it can be you got an award for something;

171
0:06:59.414,000 --> 0:07:01,000
it can be people have done it before;

172
0:07:02.136,000 --> 0:07:04,000
it can be your beta tests are going great, whatever.

173
0:07:05.14,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I want to know validation -- not just what you're telling me,

174
0:07:08.061,000 --> 0:07:1,000
but that somebody or something else out there

175
0:07:10.184,000 --> 0:07:11,000
says this makes sense.

176
0:07:11.442,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And then, I'm looking for the upside; I need a believable upside.

177
0:07:14.533,000 --> 0:07:16,000
That's two parts; it's got to be upside and believable.

178
0:07:17.183,000 --> 0:07:19,000
The upside means if you tell me that five years out,

179
0:07:19.687,000 --> 0:07:22,000
you're making a million dollars a year, that's not really upside.

180
0:07:22.77,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Telling me you'll be making a billion dollars a year --

181
0:07:25.375,000 --> 0:07:26,000
that's not believable.

182
0:07:26.55,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So it's got to be both.

183
0:07:27.725,000 --> 0:07:3,000
On the other hand are things that take the emotional level down.

184
0:07:30.77,000 --> 0:07:31,000
You have to recover from those.

185
0:07:32.273,000 --> 0:07:34,000
For example, anything that I know is not true.

186
0:07:34.444,000 --> 0:07:36,000
"We have no competition. Nobody makes a widget like this."

187
0:07:37.192,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Odds are I know somebody who's made a widget,

188
0:07:39.32,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and the minute you tell me that,

189
0:07:40.952,000 --> 0:07:42,000
I discount half of what you're saying from then on.

190
0:07:43.604,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Anything I don't understand,

191
0:07:46.373,000 --> 0:07:48,000
where I have to make the leap myself, in my own head,

192
0:07:48.929,000 --> 0:07:49,000
will stop the flow of the presentation.

193
0:07:50.881,000 --> 0:07:52,000
So you've got to take me through like a sixth-grader --

194
0:07:53.486,000 --> 0:07:55,000
dub, dub, dub -- but without patronizing me.

195
0:07:55.573,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And it's a very tricky path.

196
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
But if you can do it, it works really well.

197
0:07:59.315,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Anything that's inconsistent within your concept --

198
0:08:03.021,000 --> 0:08:05,000
if you tell me sales of X, Y or Z are 10 million dollars,

199
0:08:05.721,000 --> 0:08:07,000
five slides later, they're five million dollars ...

200
0:08:08.179,000 --> 0:08:1,000
One may have been gross sales, one may have been net sales,

201
0:08:10.987,000 --> 0:08:12,000
but I want to know that all the numbers make sense together.

202
0:08:13.894,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And then, finally: anything that's an error or a typo,

203
0:08:16.457,000 --> 0:08:18,000
or a stupid mistake or a line that's in the wrong place --

204
0:08:19.354,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that shows me that if you can't do a presentation, how can you run a company?

205
0:08:23.007,000 --> 0:08:24,000
So this all feeds in together.

206
0:08:24.903,000 --> 0:08:26,000
The best way to do this is to look at our betters,

207
0:08:27.28,000 --> 0:08:28,000
people who have done this before.

208
0:08:28.899,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Let's look at the most successful technology executive in the business,

209
0:08:32.301,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and see how a presentation goes.

210
0:08:34.538,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Bill Gates's PowerPoint presentation over here.

211
0:08:36.795,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Here's Gates doing a thing for Windows.

212
0:08:38.867,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Is this how to do a PowerPoint presentation? What do you think?

213
0:08:42.017,000 --> 0:08:44,000
No. Who do you think we should look at as our role model?

214
0:08:44.724,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Oh, isn't that funny! There's another great one over here.

215
0:08:47.548,000 --> 0:08:48,000
OK, Steve Jobs.

216
0:08:48.753,000 --> 0:08:51,000
You want absolute -- this is the Zen of presentation, right?

217
0:08:52.263,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Here he is, one little guy, black jeans and stuff,

218
0:08:55.073,000 --> 0:08:56,000
on a totally empty stage.

219
0:08:56.289,000 --> 0:08:57,000
What are you focusing on?

220
0:08:57.891,000 --> 0:08:59,000
You're focusing on him! This is Steve Jobs.

221
0:08:59.964,000 --> 0:09:02,000
So are these wonderful long bullet points, whole list of things good?

222
0:09:03.948,000 --> 0:09:05,000
No, they're not. The long bullet points are bad.

223
0:09:06.503,000 --> 0:09:08,000
What's good? Short. Short bullet points.

224
0:09:09.112,000 --> 0:09:12,000
But you know what? Even better than short bullet points are no bullet points.

225
0:09:12.792,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Just give me the headline.

226
0:09:14.061,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And you know what?

227
0:09:15.236,000 --> 0:09:17,000
How many bullet points does Steve Jobs use?

228
0:09:17.284,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Basically, none.

229
0:09:18.679,000 --> 0:09:19,000
What do you do?

230
0:09:19.855,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Best of all, images. Just a simple image.

231
0:09:22.715,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I look at the image; a picture's worth a thousand words.

232
0:09:25.37,000 --> 0:09:27,000
You look at the image and you've got the whole thing.

233
0:09:27.878,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Then you come back to me; you're focused on me, why I'm such a great guy,

234
0:09:31.336,000 --> 0:09:33,000
why you want to invest, why this all makes sense.

235
0:09:33.67,000 --> 0:09:35,000
That said, we only have a very short time,

236
0:09:35.785,000 --> 0:09:38,000
so let's run through the things to include in your presentation.

237
0:09:38.847,000 --> 0:09:4,000
First of all, none of these big, long-titled slides

238
0:09:41.352,000 --> 0:09:43,000
with blah, blah, I'm presenting to so-and-so on X date.

239
0:09:43.955,000 --> 0:09:45,000
I know the day, I know who I am -- I don't need all that.

240
0:09:46.701,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Just give me your company logo.

241
0:09:48.225,000 --> 0:09:5,000
I look at the logo, and it ties it to my brain.

242
0:09:50.456,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Then I come back to you. I'm focused on you, OK?

243
0:09:53.876,000 --> 0:09:56,000
You give me your quick, 15-second or 30-second intro, grab my attention.

244
0:09:57.825,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Then you give me a quick business overview.

245
0:09:59.854,000 --> 0:10:02,000
This is not a five-minute pitch. This is, you know, two sentences.

246
0:10:03.005,000 --> 0:10:05,000
"We build widgets for the X, Y, Z market."

247
0:10:05.058,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Or, "We sell services to help do X." You know, whatever.

248
0:10:07.744,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And that is like the picture on the outside of a jigsaw puzzle box.

249
0:10:10.932,000 --> 0:10:11,000
That lets me know the context.

250
0:10:12.413,000 --> 0:10:15,000
It gives me the armature for the whole thing you'll be going through;

251
0:10:15.689,000 --> 0:10:17,000
it lets me put everything in relation to what you've told me.

252
0:10:18.575,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Then you've got to walk me through, show me who your management team is.

253
0:10:22.881,000 --> 0:10:25,000
I want to know the size of the market. Why is this market worth getting at?

254
0:10:26.454,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I want to know your product, that's very important.

255
0:10:28.888,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Now, this is not a product pitch or sales pitch.

256
0:10:31.163,000 --> 0:10:34,000
I don't want to know all the ins and outs, just what the heck is it?

257
0:10:34.38,000 --> 0:10:37,000
If it's a website, show me a screenshot of your website.

258
0:10:37.466,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Don't do a live demo. Never do a live demo.

259
0:10:39.502,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Do a canned demo, or something that lets me know

260
0:10:41.776,000 --> 0:10:43,000
why people are going to buy whatever it is.

261
0:10:43.958,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Now that I know what you're selling,

262
0:10:46.222,000 --> 0:10:47,000
tell me how you make money on it.

263
0:10:47.821,000 --> 0:10:51,000
For every X you sell, you get Y, or services of Z.

264
0:10:52.327,000 --> 0:10:54,000
I want to know what the business model is on a per-unit basis,

265
0:10:55.297,000 --> 0:10:56,000
or for the actual product you're selling.

266
0:10:57.281,000 --> 0:10:59,000
I want to know who you're selling to in terms of customers

267
0:11:00.025,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and if you have any special relationships that will help you,

268
0:11:02.935,000 --> 0:11:05,000
whether it's a distribution relationship or a producing partner.

269
0:11:05.969,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Again, validation.

270
0:11:07.144,000 --> 0:11:1,000
This helps to say you're bigger than just one little thing over here.

271
0:11:10.419,000 --> 0:11:11,000
But everybody has competition.

272
0:11:11.879,000 --> 0:11:13,000
There's never been a company with no competition,

273
0:11:14.213,000 --> 0:11:16,000
even if the competition is the old way of doing something.

274
0:11:16.966,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I want to know exactly what your competition is,

275
0:11:19.27,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and that will help me judge how you fit into the whole operation.

276
0:11:22.361,000 --> 0:11:23,000
I want to know how you're special.

277
0:11:24.048,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I know what your competition does --

278
0:11:25.794,000 --> 0:11:27,000
how are you going to prevent them from eating your lunch?

279
0:11:28.493,000 --> 0:11:3,000
All this ties into the financial overview.

280
0:11:30.525,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And you can't do a VC pitch without giving me your financials.

281
0:11:33.477,000 --> 0:11:36,000
I want to know a year or two back, or as long as you've been in existence.

282
0:11:37.007,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And I want to know four or five years forward.

283
0:11:39.276,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Five is a bit much. Probably four.

284
0:11:40.929,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And I want to know how that business model, on a product basis,

285
0:11:43.919,000 --> 0:11:46,000
will translate into a company model: How many widgets will you sell?

286
0:11:47.147,000 --> 0:11:5,000
You make X amount per widget. I want to know what the driver is.

287
0:11:50.174,000 --> 0:11:52,000
We'll have 1,000 customers this year and 10,000 the next,

288
0:11:52.869,000 --> 0:11:53,000
our revenues will do this and that.

289
0:11:54.564,000 --> 0:11:56,000
That gives me the whole picture for the next several years

290
0:11:57.309,000 --> 0:11:58,000
into which I'm investing.

291
0:11:58.527,000 --> 0:12:01,000
And I want to know how the money from me will help you get there.

292
0:12:01.612,000 --> 0:12:03,000
You're going to open an offshore plant in China,

293
0:12:03.877,000 --> 0:12:05,000
you're going to spend it all on sales and marketing,

294
0:12:06.34,000 --> 0:12:07,000
you're going to go to Tahiti, whatever.

295
0:12:08.227,000 --> 0:12:1,000
But then comes the ask, where you tell me how much you want.

296
0:12:11.067,000 --> 0:12:13,000
You're looking for 5 million -- at what valuation?

297
0:12:13.562,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Two million? 100,000?

298
0:12:15.796,000 --> 0:12:16,000
What's the money in so far? Who invested?

299
0:12:17.795,000 --> 0:12:2,000
I hope you invested -- if you can't invest in your own thing, why should I?

300
0:12:21.806,000 --> 0:12:23,000
So I like to know if you have friends and family,

301
0:12:24.12,000 --> 0:12:25,000
or angel investors, or more VCs before.

302
0:12:26.009,000 --> 0:12:28,000
What's the capital structure up until this point?

303
0:12:28.379,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Finally, having done all that, you've now told me the whole thing,

304
0:12:31.507,000 --> 0:12:33,000
so now you bring it back to that conclusion.

305
0:12:34.022,000 --> 0:12:35,000
This is that rocket going up.

306
0:12:35.442,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Hopefully everything has been positive.

307
0:12:37.336,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And everything you say clicks, it all makes sense.

308
0:12:39.807,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And I'm thinking, "This is really great!"

309
0:12:41.808,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Then you take me back to just your logo on the screen.

310
0:12:44.379,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And I look at the logo -- OK, good.

311
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Now I come back to you. Nothing else to look at, right?

312
0:12:48.764,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Now you've got to wrap it up to give me the final -- boom! --

313
0:12:52.311,000 --> 0:12:54,000
the final pitch that's going to send me into space.

314
0:12:54.724,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Now, in the process of doing this,

315
0:12:56.8,000 --> 0:12:58,000
how do you remember the sequences and do it?

316
0:12:59.279,000 --> 0:13:01,000
You've noticed I'm not looking at the screen, right?

317
0:13:01.74,000 --> 0:13:02,000
The screen is in front of me,

318
0:13:03.326,000 --> 0:13:04,000
so I couldn't even see if I wanted to.

319
0:13:05.161,000 --> 0:13:06,000
So how do I know what's going on?

320
0:13:06.76,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Well, I have a laptop in front of me.

321
0:13:08.578,000 --> 0:13:09,000
You're looking at me and at this.

322
0:13:10.177,000 --> 0:13:11,000
What am I looking at?

323
0:13:11.352,000 --> 0:13:12,000
You think that I'm looking at that?

324
0:13:13.048,000 --> 0:13:14,000
No, I'm looking, actually,

325
0:13:14.358,000 --> 0:13:16,000
at a special version of PowerPoint over here,

326
0:13:16.722,000 --> 0:13:18,000
which shows me the slides ahead and behind, my notes,

327
0:13:19.452,000 --> 0:13:2,000
so I can see what's going on.

328
0:13:20.873,000 --> 0:13:22,000
PowerPoint has this built into every copy of it that's shipped.

329
0:13:23.871,000 --> 0:13:25,000
If you use Apple's Keynote, it's got an even better version.

330
0:13:26.714,000 --> 0:13:29,000
There's another program called Ovation you can get from Adobe

331
0:13:29.771,000 --> 0:13:3,000
that they bought last summer,

332
0:13:31.18,000 --> 0:13:34,000
which helps you run the timers and lets you figure out what's going on.

333
0:13:34.891,000 --> 0:13:36,000
So, here's my wrap-up to take you to the moon, right?

334
0:13:37.473,000 --> 0:13:39,000
I usually do a Top 10, but we don't have time,

335
0:13:39.651,000 --> 0:13:4,000
so: David's Top Five Presentation Tips.

336
0:13:41.564,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Number five: always use presenter mode,

337
0:13:43.927,000 --> 0:13:45,000
or Ovation, or presenter tools.

338
0:13:46.324,000 --> 0:13:48,000
It lets you know exactly where you're going,

339
0:13:48.428,000 --> 0:13:5,000
helps you pace yourself, gives you a timer, the whole bit.

340
0:13:51.328,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Number four: always use remote control.

341
0:13:53.218,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Have you seen me touch the computer? No. Why not?

342
0:13:55.541,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Because I'm using remote control. Always use remote control.

343
0:13:58.382,000 --> 0:14:,000
Number three: the handouts you give are not your presentation.

344
0:14:01.336,000 --> 0:14:02,000
If you follow my suggestions,

345
0:14:02.748,000 --> 0:14:04,000
you'll have a very spare, Zen-like presentation,

346
0:14:05.023,000 --> 0:14:08,000
which is great to convey who you are and get people emotionally involved,

347
0:14:08.479,000 --> 0:14:09,000
but not good as a handout.

348
0:14:09.749,000 --> 0:14:12,000
You want a handout that gives more information; it has to stand without you.

349
0:14:13.35,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Number two: don't read your speech. Can you imagine?

350
0:14:15.903,000 --> 0:14:17,000
(Reading) "You should invest in my company ... "

351
0:14:18.172,000 --> 0:14:19,000
It doesn't work.

352
0:14:19.348,000 --> 0:14:22,000
And the number one presentation tip: never, ever look at the screen.

353
0:14:22.973,000 --> 0:14:24,000
You're making a connection with your audience,

354
0:14:25.181,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and you always want a one-on-one connection.

355
0:14:27.683,000 --> 0:14:29,000
The screen should come up behind you

356
0:14:29.742,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and supplement what you're doing, instead of replace you.

357
0:14:32.437,000 --> 0:14:33,000
And that is how to pitch to a VC.

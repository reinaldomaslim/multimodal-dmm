1
0:00:12.492,000 --> 0:00:16,000
The two most likely largest inventions

2
0:00:17.126,000 --> 0:00:19,000
of our generation

3
0:00:19.373,000 --> 0:00:22,000
are the Internet and the mobile phone.

4
0:00:22.566,000 --> 0:00:24,000
They've changed the world.

5
0:00:24.701,000 --> 0:00:27,000
However, largely to our surprise,

6
0:00:28.216,000 --> 0:00:32,000
they also turned out to be the perfect tools

7
0:00:32.614,000 --> 0:00:35,000
for the surveillance state.

8
0:00:35.764,000 --> 0:00:37,000
It turned out that the capability

9
0:00:38.661,000 --> 0:00:42,000
to collect data, information and connections

10
0:00:42.705,000 --> 0:00:46,000
about basically any of us and all of us

11
0:00:46.923,000 --> 0:00:47,000
is exactly what we've been hearing

12
0:00:48.736,000 --> 0:00:52,000
throughout of the summer through revelations and leaks

13
0:00:53.343,000 --> 0:00:56,000
about Western intelligence agencies,

14
0:00:56.434,000 --> 0:00:59,000
mostly U.S. intelligence agencies,

15
0:00:59.46,000 --> 0:01:02,000
watching over the rest of the world.

16
0:01:02.633,000 --> 0:01:05,000
We've heard about these starting with the

17
0:01:05.831,000 --> 0:01:08,000
revelations from June 6.

18
0:01:09.517,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Edward Snowden started leaking information,

19
0:01:12.586,000 --> 0:01:14,000
top secret classified information,

20
0:01:14.89,000 --> 0:01:15,000
from the U.S. intelligence agencies,

21
0:01:16.357,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and we started learning about things like PRISM

22
0:01:18.826,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and XKeyscore and others.

23
0:01:22.093,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And these are examples of the kinds of programs

24
0:01:25.198,000 --> 0:01:29,000
U.S. intelligence agencies are running right now,

25
0:01:29.477,000 --> 0:01:32,000
against the whole rest of the world.

26
0:01:32.993,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And if you look back about the forecasts

27
0:01:36.701,000 --> 0:01:4,000
on surveillance by George Orwell,

28
0:01:40.817,000 --> 0:01:42,000
well it turns out that

29
0:01:42.935,000 --> 0:01:44,000
George Orwell was an optimist.

30
0:01:45.439,000 --> 0:01:47,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:47.919,000 --> 0:01:49,000
We are right now seeing a much larger scale

32
0:01:50.619,000 --> 0:01:51,000
of tracking of individual citizens

33
0:01:52.517,000 --> 0:01:55,000
than he could have ever imagined.

34
0:01:56.149,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And this here is the infamous

35
0:01:59.684,000 --> 0:02:02,000
NSA data center in Utah.

36
0:02:03.528,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Due to be opened very soon,

37
0:02:06.684,000 --> 0:02:08,000
it will be both a supercomputing center

38
0:02:09.475,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and a data storage center.

39
0:02:11.612,000 --> 0:02:13,000
You could basically imagine it has a large hall

40
0:02:14.505,000 --> 0:02:16,000
filled with hard drives storing data

41
0:02:16.961,000 --> 0:02:18,000
they are collecting.

42
0:02:19.235,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And it's a pretty big building.

43
0:02:21.392,000 --> 0:02:22,000
How big? Well, I can give you the numbers --

44
0:02:23.243,000 --> 0:02:25,000
140,000 square meters --

45
0:02:25.265,000 --> 0:02:27,000
but that doesn't really tell you very much.

46
0:02:27.871,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Maybe it's better to imagine it as a comparison.

47
0:02:31.047,000 --> 0:02:33,000
You think about the largest IKEA store

48
0:02:33.503,000 --> 0:02:34,000
you've ever been in.

49
0:02:35.25,000 --> 0:02:38,000
This is five times larger.

50
0:02:38.719,000 --> 0:02:41,000
How many hard drives can you fit in an IKEA store?

51
0:02:41.795,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Right? It's pretty big.

52
0:02:43.802,000 --> 0:02:45,000
We estimate that just the electricity bill

53
0:02:46.648,000 --> 0:02:47,000
for running this data center

54
0:02:48.524,000 --> 0:02:51,000
is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year.

55
0:02:51.922,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And this kind of wholesale surveillance

56
0:02:54.431,000 --> 0:02:56,000
means that they can collect our data

57
0:02:57.167,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and keep it basically forever,

58
0:02:59.17,000 --> 0:03:01,000
keep it for extended periods of time,

59
0:03:01.679,000 --> 0:03:04,000
keep it for years, keep it for decades.

60
0:03:04.925,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And this opens up completely new kinds of risks

61
0:03:08.304,000 --> 0:03:09,000
to us all.

62
0:03:10.25,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And what this is is that it is wholesale

63
0:03:13.878,000 --> 0:03:17,000
blanket surveillance on everyone.

64
0:03:18.735,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Well, not exactly everyone,

65
0:03:20.289,000 --> 0:03:24,000
because the U.S. intelligence only has a legal right

66
0:03:24.317,000 --> 0:03:25,000
to monitor foreigners.

67
0:03:26.287,000 --> 0:03:27,000
They can monitor foreigners

68
0:03:28.037,000 --> 0:03:3,000
when foreigners' data connections

69
0:03:30.847,000 --> 0:03:33,000
end up in the United States or pass through the United States.

70
0:03:34.337,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And monitoring foreigners doesn't sound too bad

71
0:03:37.121,000 --> 0:03:39,000
until you realize

72
0:03:39.488,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that I'm a foreigner and you're a foreigner.

73
0:03:42.489,000 --> 0:03:45,000
In fact, 96 percent of the planet are foreigners.

74
0:03:46.275,000 --> 0:03:47,000
(Laughter)

75
0:03:47.945,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Right?

76
0:03:49.832,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So it is wholesale blanket surveillance of all of us,

77
0:03:54.281,000 --> 0:03:58,000
all of us who use telecommunications and the Internet.

78
0:03:58.383,000 --> 0:03:59,000
But don't get me wrong:

79
0:04:00.274,000 --> 0:04:05,000
There are actually types of surveillance that are okay.

80
0:04:05.5,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I love freedom, but even I agree

81
0:04:08.529,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that some surveillance is fine.

82
0:04:10.808,000 --> 0:04:13,000
If the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer,

83
0:04:14.711,000 --> 0:04:17,000
or they're trying to catch a drug lord

84
0:04:17.813,000 --> 0:04:2,000
or trying to prevent a school shooting,

85
0:04:21.417,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and they have leads and they have suspects,

86
0:04:23.094,000 --> 0:04:26,000
then it's perfectly fine for them to tap the suspect's phone,

87
0:04:26.811,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and to intercept his Internet communications.

88
0:04:30.167,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I'm not arguing that at all,

89
0:04:32.105,000 --> 0:04:34,000
but that's not what programs like PRISM are about.

90
0:04:34.929,000 --> 0:04:36,000
They are not about doing surveillance on people

91
0:04:37.814,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that they have reason to suspect of some wrongdoings.

92
0:04:41.018,000 --> 0:04:42,000
They're about doing surveillance on people

93
0:04:42.695,000 --> 0:04:45,000
they know are innocent.

94
0:04:46.455,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So the four main arguments

95
0:04:48.7,000 --> 0:04:5,000
supporting surveillance like this,

96
0:04:50.852,000 --> 0:04:52,000
well, the first of all is that whenever you start

97
0:04:53.087,000 --> 0:04:54,000
discussing about these revelations,

98
0:04:54.982,000 --> 0:04:56,000
there will be naysayers trying to minimize

99
0:04:57.275,000 --> 0:04:59,000
the importance of these revelations, saying that

100
0:04:59.463,000 --> 0:05:,000
we knew all this already,

101
0:05:01.076,000 --> 0:05:04,000
we knew it was happening, there's nothing new here.

102
0:05:04.656,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And that's not true. Don't let anybody tell you

103
0:05:07.871,000 --> 0:05:12,000
that we knew this already, because we did not know this already.

104
0:05:13.583,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Our worst fears might have been something like this,

105
0:05:17.356,000 --> 0:05:18,000
but we didn't know this was happening.

106
0:05:19.307,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Now we know for a fact it's happening.

107
0:05:22.084,000 --> 0:05:24,000
We didn't know about this. We didn't know about PRISM.

108
0:05:24.663,000 --> 0:05:26,000
We didn't know about XKeyscore. We didn't know about Cybertrans.

109
0:05:27.569,000 --> 0:05:28,000
We didn't know about DoubleArrow.

110
0:05:29.519,000 --> 0:05:31,000
We did not know about Skywriter --

111
0:05:31.667,000 --> 0:05:32,000
all these different programs

112
0:05:33.362,000 --> 0:05:36,000
run by U.S. intelligence agencies.

113
0:05:36.603,000 --> 0:05:39,000
But now we do.

114
0:05:39.632,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And we did not know

115
0:05:41.798,000 --> 0:05:44,000
that U.S. intelligence agencies go to extremes

116
0:05:44.873,000 --> 0:05:47,000
such as infiltrating standardization bodies

117
0:05:48.71,000 --> 0:05:52,000
to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose.

118
0:05:53.458,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And what that means

119
0:05:55.495,000 --> 0:05:56,000
is that you take something which is secure,

120
0:05:57.315,000 --> 0:05:59,000
an encryption algorithm which is so secure

121
0:05:59.736,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file,

122
0:06:02.843,000 --> 0:06:03,000
nobody can decrypt that file.

123
0:06:04.585,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Even if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file,

124
0:06:08.998,000 --> 0:06:1,000
it's going to take millions of years.

125
0:06:11.058,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So that's basically perfectly safe, uncrackable.

126
0:06:13.305,000 --> 0:06:15,000
You take something which is that good

127
0:06:15.379,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and then you weaken it on purpose,

128
0:06:17.863,000 --> 0:06:22,000
making all of us less secure as an end result.

129
0:06:23.473,000 --> 0:06:25,000
A real-world equivalent would be that

130
0:06:25.604,000 --> 0:06:27,000
intelligence agencies would force

131
0:06:28.256,000 --> 0:06:3,000
some secret pin code into every single house alarm

132
0:06:31.083,000 --> 0:06:32,000
so they could get into every single house

133
0:06:32.876,000 --> 0:06:34,000
because, you know, bad people might have house alarms,

134
0:06:35.122,000 --> 0:06:37,000
but it will also make all of us

135
0:06:37.561,000 --> 0:06:39,000
less secure as an end result.

136
0:06:39.79,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Backdooring encryption algorithms

137
0:06:43.53,000 --> 0:06:46,000
just boggles the mind.

138
0:06:46.626,000 --> 0:06:49,000
But of course, these intelligence agencies are doing their job.

139
0:06:50.401,000 --> 0:06:51,000
This is what they have been told to do:

140
0:06:52.158,000 --> 0:06:54,000
do signals intelligence,

141
0:06:54.388,000 --> 0:06:56,000
monitor telecommunications,

142
0:06:56.4,000 --> 0:06:57,000
monitor Internet traffic.

143
0:06:57.822,000 --> 0:06:58,000
That's what they're trying to do,

144
0:06:59.53,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and since most, a very big part of the Internet traffic today is encrypted,

145
0:07:02.612,000 --> 0:07:03,000
they're trying to find ways around the encryption.

146
0:07:04.569,000 --> 0:07:07,000
One way is to sabotage encryption algorithms,

147
0:07:07.626,000 --> 0:07:08,000
which is a great example

148
0:07:09.511,000 --> 0:07:11,000
about how U.S. intelligence agencies

149
0:07:11.732,000 --> 0:07:12,000
are running loose.

150
0:07:13.481,000 --> 0:07:14,000
They are completely out of control,

151
0:07:15.322,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and they should be brought back under control.

152
0:07:21.629,000 --> 0:07:23,000
So what do we actually know about the leaks?

153
0:07:24.579,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Everything is based on the files

154
0:07:26.689,000 --> 0:07:28,000
leaked by Mr. Snowden.

155
0:07:29.187,000 --> 0:07:31,000
The very first PRISM slides

156
0:07:32.035,000 --> 0:07:33,000
from the beginning of June

157
0:07:34.024,000 --> 0:07:36,000
detail a collection program where the data

158
0:07:36.118,000 --> 0:07:37,000
is collected from service providers,

159
0:07:37.904,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and they actually go and name the service providers

160
0:07:40.782,000 --> 0:07:41,000
they have access to.

161
0:07:42.113,000 --> 0:07:44,000
They even have a specific date

162
0:07:45.055,000 --> 0:07:47,000
on when the collection of data began

163
0:07:47.719,000 --> 0:07:48,000
for each of the service providers.

164
0:07:49.358,000 --> 0:07:51,000
So for example, they name the collection from Microsoft

165
0:07:51.645,000 --> 0:07:54,000
started on September 11, 2007,

166
0:07:55.365,000 --> 0:07:57,000
for Yahoo on the March 12, 2008,

167
0:07:58.097,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and then others: Google, Facebook,

168
0:08:01.113,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Skype, Apple and so on.

169
0:08:04.357,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And every single one of these companies denies.

170
0:08:07.205,000 --> 0:08:11,000
They all say that this simply isn't true,

171
0:08:11.6,000 --> 0:08:15,000
that they are not giving backdoor access to their data.

172
0:08:16.208,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Yet we have these files.

173
0:08:20.331,000 --> 0:08:22,000
So is one of the parties lying,

174
0:08:22.652,000 --> 0:08:25,000
or is there some other alternative explanation?

175
0:08:25.975,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And one explanation would be

176
0:08:28.897,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that these parties, these service providers,

177
0:08:31.784,000 --> 0:08:32,000
are not cooperating.

178
0:08:33.7,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Instead, they've been hacked.

179
0:08:36.721,000 --> 0:08:39,000
That would explain it. They aren't cooperating. They've been hacked.

180
0:08:39.938,000 --> 0:08:43,000
In this case, they've been hacked by their own government.

181
0:08:44.116,000 --> 0:08:46,000
That might sound outlandish,

182
0:08:46.537,000 --> 0:08:48,000
but we already have cases where this has happened,

183
0:08:48.751,000 --> 0:08:51,000
for example, the case of the Flame malware

184
0:08:51.797,000 --> 0:08:53,000
which we strongly believe was authored

185
0:08:53.83,000 --> 0:08:54,000
by the U.S. government,

186
0:08:55.727,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and which, to spread, subverted the security

187
0:08:59.626,000 --> 0:09:01,000
of the Windows Update network,

188
0:09:02.512,000 --> 0:09:06,000
meaning here, the company was hacked

189
0:09:06.605,000 --> 0:09:08,000
by their own government.

190
0:09:08.963,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And there's more evidence

191
0:09:10.562,000 --> 0:09:12,000
supporting this theory as well.

192
0:09:13.113,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Der Spiegel, from Germany, leaked more information

193
0:09:17.118,000 --> 0:09:21,000
about the operations run by the elite hacker units

194
0:09:21.383,000 --> 0:09:24,000
operating inside these intelligence agencies.

195
0:09:24.418,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Inside NSA, the unit is called TAO,

196
0:09:27.044,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Tailored Access Operations,

197
0:09:28.889,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and inside GCHQ, which is the U.K. equivalent,

198
0:09:32.453,000 --> 0:09:35,000
it's called NAC, Network Analysis Centre.

199
0:09:36.452,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And these recent leaks of these three slides

200
0:09:40.296,000 --> 0:09:42,000
detail an operation

201
0:09:42.5,000 --> 0:09:45,000
run by this GCHQ intelligence agency

202
0:09:45.658,000 --> 0:09:46,000
from the United Kingdom

203
0:09:47.467,000 --> 0:09:51,000
targeting a telecom here in Belgium.

204
0:09:51.7,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And what this really means

205
0:09:53.976,000 --> 0:09:56,000
is that an E.U. country's intelligence agency

206
0:09:57.864,000 --> 0:09:59,000
is breaching the security

207
0:10:00.079,000 --> 0:10:04,000
of a telecom of a fellow E.U. country on purpose,

208
0:10:04.892,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and they discuss it in their slides completely casually,

209
0:10:08.727,000 --> 0:10:09,000
business as usual.

210
0:10:10.328,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Here's the primary target,

211
0:10:11.996,000 --> 0:10:12,000
here's the secondary target,

212
0:10:13.374,000 --> 0:10:14,000
here's the teaming.

213
0:10:14.798,000 --> 0:10:17,000
They probably have a team building on Thursday evening in a pub.

214
0:10:18.654,000 --> 0:10:21,000
They even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art

215
0:10:21.695,000 --> 0:10:22,000
like, you know, "Success,"

216
0:10:23.402,000 --> 0:10:26,000
when they gain access to services like this.

217
0:10:26.666,000 --> 0:10:28,000
What the hell?

218
0:10:31.685,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And then there's the argument

219
0:10:33.518,000 --> 0:10:34,000
that okay, yes, this might be going on,

220
0:10:35.178,000 --> 0:10:37,000
but then again, other countries are doing it as well.

221
0:10:37.815,000 --> 0:10:39,000
All countries spy.

222
0:10:40.238,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And maybe that's true.

223
0:10:41.976,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Many countries spy, not all of them, but let's take an example.

224
0:10:44.414,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Let's take, for example, Sweden.

225
0:10:46.525,000 --> 0:10:47,000
I'm speaking of Sweden because Sweden

226
0:10:47.901,000 --> 0:10:49,000
has a little bit of a similar law to the United States.

227
0:10:50.18,000 --> 0:10:52,000
When your data traffic goes through Sweden,

228
0:10:52.303,000 --> 0:10:54,000
their intelligence agency has a legal right by the law

229
0:10:55.113,000 --> 0:10:57,000
to intercept that traffic.

230
0:10:57.114,000 --> 0:11:,000
All right, how many Swedish decisionmakers

231
0:11:00.319,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and politicians and business leaders

232
0:11:03.191,000 --> 0:11:06,000
use, every day, U.S.-based services,

233
0:11:06.264,000 --> 0:11:09,000
like, you know, run Windows or OSX,

234
0:11:09.532,000 --> 0:11:11,000
or use Facebook or LinkedIn,

235
0:11:11.742,000 --> 0:11:14,000
or store their data in clouds like iCloud

236
0:11:15.142,000 --> 0:11:18,000
or Skydrive or DropBox,

237
0:11:19.036,000 --> 0:11:23,000
or maybe use online services like Amazon web services or sales support?

238
0:11:23.339,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And the answer is, every single Swedish business leader does that every single day.

239
0:11:27.296,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And then we turn it around.

240
0:11:28.895,000 --> 0:11:29,000
How many American leaders

241
0:11:30.8,000 --> 0:11:34,000
use Swedish webmails and cloud services?

242
0:11:35.093,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And the answer is zero.

243
0:11:37.133,000 --> 0:11:39,000
So this is not balanced.

244
0:11:39.402,000 --> 0:11:43,000
It's not balanced by any means, not even close.

245
0:11:44.027,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And when we do have the occasional

246
0:11:46.468,000 --> 0:11:48,000
European success story,

247
0:11:48.469,000 --> 0:11:51,000
even those, then, typically end up being sold to the United States.

248
0:11:52.035,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Like, Skype used to be secure.

249
0:11:54.299,000 --> 0:11:56,000
It used to be end-to-end encrypted.

250
0:11:57.032,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Then it was sold to the United States.

251
0:11:59.073,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Today, it no longer is secure.

252
0:12:01.722,000 --> 0:12:04,000
So once again, we take something which is secure

253
0:12:04.943,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and then we make it less secure on purpose,

254
0:12:06.813,000 --> 0:12:1,000
making all of us less secure as an outcome.

255
0:12:12.855,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And then the argument that the United States

256
0:12:15.102,000 --> 0:12:17,000
is only fighting terrorists.

257
0:12:17.12,000 --> 0:12:18,000
It's the war on terror.

258
0:12:18.286,000 --> 0:12:2,000
You shouldn't worry about it.

259
0:12:20.833,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Well, it's not the war on terror.

260
0:12:23.063,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Yes, part of it is war on terror, and yes,

261
0:12:25.236,000 --> 0:12:27,000
there are terrorists, and they do kill and maim,

262
0:12:28.212,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and we should fight them,

263
0:12:29.763,000 --> 0:12:3,000
but we know through these leaks

264
0:12:31.369,000 --> 0:12:33,000
that they have used the same techniques

265
0:12:33.951,000 --> 0:12:36,000
to listen to phone calls of European leaders,

266
0:12:37.287,000 --> 0:12:4,000
to tap the email of residents of Mexico and Brazil,

267
0:12:40.742,000 --> 0:12:44,000
to read email traffic inside the United Nations Headquarters and E.U. Parliament,

268
0:12:45.548,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and I don't think they are trying to find terrorists

269
0:12:48.702,000 --> 0:12:51,000
from inside the E.U. Parliament, right?

270
0:12:51.72,000 --> 0:12:52,000
It's not the war on terror.

271
0:12:53.668,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Part of it might be, and there are terrorists,

272
0:12:57.81,000 --> 0:12:59,000
but are we really thinking about terrorists

273
0:13:00.237,000 --> 0:13:02,000
as such an existential threat

274
0:13:02.406,000 --> 0:13:05,000
that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them?

275
0:13:06.082,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Are the Americans ready to throw away the Constituion

276
0:13:09.573,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and throw it in the trash just because there are terrorists?

277
0:13:13.814,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And the same thing with the Bill of Rights and all the amendments

278
0:13:16.338,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights

279
0:13:18.655,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and the E.U. conventions on human rights and fundamental freedoms

280
0:13:23.806,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and the press freedom?

281
0:13:25.323,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Do we really think terrorism is such an existential threat,

282
0:13:29.138,000 --> 0:13:32,000
we are ready to do anything at all?

283
0:13:34.49,000 --> 0:13:36,000
But people are scared about terrorists,

284
0:13:37.154,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and then they think that maybe that surveillance is okay

285
0:13:39.568,000 --> 0:13:41,000
because they have nothing to hide.

286
0:13:41.612,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Feel free to survey me if that helps.

287
0:13:44.319,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide

288
0:13:47.207,000 --> 0:13:51,000
simply hasn't thought about this long enough.

289
0:13:54.52,000 --> 0:13:59,000
(Applause)

290
0:14:00.385,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Because we have this thing called privacy,

291
0:14:03.157,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and if you really think that you have nothing to hide,

292
0:14:05.502,000 --> 0:14:07,000
please make sure that's the first thing you tell me,

293
0:14:07.718,000 --> 0:14:08,000
because then I know

294
0:14:09.268,000 --> 0:14:1,000
that I should not trust you with any secrets,

295
0:14:10.908,000 --> 0:14:13,000
because obviously you can't keep a secret.

296
0:14:17.065,000 --> 0:14:2,000
But people are brutally honest with the Internet,

297
0:14:20.894,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and when these leaks started,

298
0:14:23.59,000 --> 0:14:24,000
many people were asking me about this.

299
0:14:25.468,000 --> 0:14:26,000
And I have nothing to hide.

300
0:14:27.042,000 --> 0:14:3,000
I'm not doing anything bad or anything illegal.

301
0:14:30.332,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Yet, I have nothing that I would in particular

302
0:14:33.117,000 --> 0:14:35,000
like to share with an intelligence agency,

303
0:14:35.91,000 --> 0:14:39,000
especially a foreign intelligence agency.

304
0:14:40.047,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And if we indeed need a Big Brother,

305
0:14:42.902,000 --> 0:14:45,000
I would much rather have a domestic Big Brother

306
0:14:46.38,000 --> 0:14:49,000
than a foreign Big Brother.

307
0:14:49.545,000 --> 0:14:54,000
And when the leaks started, the very first thing I tweeted about this

308
0:14:54.604,000 --> 0:14:56,000
was a comment about how,

309
0:14:56.678,000 --> 0:14:57,000
when you've been using search engines,

310
0:14:58.366,000 --> 0:15:01,000
you've been potentially leaking all that to U.S. intelligence.

311
0:15:02.015,000 --> 0:15:03,000
And two minutes later, I got a reply

312
0:15:03.987,000 --> 0:15:05,000
by somebody called Kimberly from the United States

313
0:15:06.323,000 --> 0:15:08,000
challenging me, like, why am I worried about this?

314
0:15:08.503,000 --> 0:15:12,000
What am I sending to worry about this? Am I sending naked pictures or something?

315
0:15:12.535,000 --> 0:15:13,000
And my answer to Kimberly was

316
0:15:14.503,000 --> 0:15:17,000
that what I'm sending is none of your business,

317
0:15:17.532,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and it should be none of your government's business either.

318
0:15:21.797,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Because that's what it's about. It's about privacy.

319
0:15:24.049,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Privacy is nonnegotiable.

320
0:15:25.963,000 --> 0:15:28,000
It should be built in to all the systems we use.

321
0:15:31.968,000 --> 0:15:34,000
(Applause)

322
0:15:38.83,000 --> 0:15:4,000
And one thing we should all understand

323
0:15:41.449,000 --> 0:15:45,000
is that we are brutally honest with search engines.

324
0:15:46.048,000 --> 0:15:48,000
You show me your search history,

325
0:15:48.799,000 --> 0:15:5,000
and I'll find something incriminating

326
0:15:51.165,000 --> 0:15:54,000
or something embarrassing there in five minutes.

327
0:15:54.602,000 --> 0:15:55,000
We are more honest with search engines

328
0:15:56.39,000 --> 0:15:57,000
than we are with our families.

329
0:15:58.152,000 --> 0:16:,000
Search engines know more about you

330
0:16:00.243,000 --> 0:16:02,000
than your family members know about you.

331
0:16:03.009,000 --> 0:16:06,000
And this is all the kind of information we are giving away,

332
0:16:06.097,000 --> 0:16:1,000
we are giving away to the United States.

333
0:16:10.472,000 --> 0:16:12,000
And surveillance changes history.

334
0:16:12.95,000 --> 0:16:15,000
We know this through examples of corrupt presidents like Nixon.

335
0:16:16.159,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Imagine if he would have had the kind of surveillance tools that are available today.

336
0:16:20.631,000 --> 0:16:22,000
And let me actually quote

337
0:16:22.94,000 --> 0:16:25,000
the president of Brazil, Ms. Dilma Rousseff.

338
0:16:26.073,000 --> 0:16:29,000
She was one of the targets of NSA surveillance.

339
0:16:29.359,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Her email was read, and she spoke

340
0:16:31.635,000 --> 0:16:34,000
at the United Nations Headquarters, and she said,

341
0:16:34.658,000 --> 0:16:36,000
"If there is no right to privacy,

342
0:16:36.671,000 --> 0:16:38,000
there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion,

343
0:16:39.498,000 --> 0:16:44,000
and therefore, there can be no effective democracy."

344
0:16:44.609,000 --> 0:16:46,000
That's what it's about.

345
0:16:46.954,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Privacy is the building block of our democracies.

346
0:16:52.611,000 --> 0:16:55,000
And to quote a fellow security researcher, Marcus Ranum,

347
0:16:56.076,000 --> 0:16:59,000
he said that the United States is right now treating the Internet

348
0:16:59.903,000 --> 0:17:02,000
as it would be treating one of its colonies.

349
0:17:02.996,000 --> 0:17:04,000
So we are back to the age of colonization,

350
0:17:05.561,000 --> 0:17:08,000
and we, the foreign users of the Internet,

351
0:17:08.623,000 --> 0:17:11,000
we should think about Americans as our masters.

352
0:17:15.005,000 --> 0:17:18,000
So Mr. Snowden, he's been blamed for many things.

353
0:17:18.98,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Some are blaming him for causing problems

354
0:17:21.634,000 --> 0:17:24,000
for the U.S. cloud industry and software companies with these revelations --

355
0:17:24.825,000 --> 0:17:28,000
and blaming Snowden for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry

356
0:17:29.121,000 --> 0:17:31,000
would be the equivalent of blaming Al Gore

357
0:17:31.58,000 --> 0:17:33,000
for causing global warming.

358
0:17:33.897,000 --> 0:17:35,000
(Laughter)

359
0:17:36.151,000 --> 0:17:41,000
(Applause)

360
0:17:43.853,000 --> 0:17:49,000
So, what is there to be done?

361
0:17:50.061,000 --> 0:17:51,000
Should we worry. No, we shouldn't worry.

362
0:17:51.841,000 --> 0:17:53,000
We should be angry, because this is wrong,

363
0:17:54.277,000 --> 0:17:56,000
and it's rude, and it should not be done.

364
0:17:57.016,000 --> 0:17:59,000
But that's not going to really change the situation.

365
0:17:59.284,000 --> 0:18:02,000
What's going to change the situation for the rest of the world

366
0:18:02.505,000 --> 0:18:04,000
is to try to steer away

367
0:18:04.787,000 --> 0:18:06,000
from systems built in the United States.

368
0:18:07.42,000 --> 0:18:09,000
And that's much easier said than done.

369
0:18:10.05,000 --> 0:18:11,000
How do you do that?

370
0:18:11.759,000 --> 0:18:12,000
A single country, any single country in Europe

371
0:18:13.558,000 --> 0:18:15,000
cannot replace and build replacements

372
0:18:16.351,000 --> 0:18:18,000
for the U.S.-made operating systems and cloud services.

373
0:18:19.113,000 --> 0:18:2,000
But maybe you don't have to do it alone.

374
0:18:21.006,000 --> 0:18:22,000
Maybe you can do it together with other countries.

375
0:18:22.775,000 --> 0:18:25,000
The solution is open source.

376
0:18:26.271,000 --> 0:18:31,000
By building together open, free, secure systems,

377
0:18:31.884,000 --> 0:18:34,000
we can go around such surveillance,

378
0:18:34.992,000 --> 0:18:37,000
and then one country doesn't have to solve the problem by itself.

379
0:18:38.215,000 --> 0:18:4,000
It only has to solve one little problem.

380
0:18:40.687,000 --> 0:18:45,000
And to quote a fellow security researcher, Haroon Meer,

381
0:18:46.21,000 --> 0:18:48,000
one country only has to make a small wave,

382
0:18:49.179,000 --> 0:18:52,000
but those small waves together become a tide,

383
0:18:52.646,000 --> 0:18:55,000
and the tide will lift all the boats up at the same time,

384
0:18:56.266,000 --> 0:18:57,000
and the tide we will build

385
0:18:57.917,000 --> 0:19:,000
with secure, free, open-source systems,

386
0:19:01.358,000 --> 0:19:03,000
will become the tide that will lift all of us

387
0:19:03.757,000 --> 0:19:08,000
up and above the surveillance state.

388
0:19:09.339,000 --> 0:19:11,000
Thank you very much.

389
0:19:11.451,000 --> 0:19:13,000
(Applause)

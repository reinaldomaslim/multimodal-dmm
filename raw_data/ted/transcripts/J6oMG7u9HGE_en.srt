2
0:00:15.992,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So here's the good news about families.

3
0:00:18.879,000 --> 0:00:2,000
The last 50 years have seen a revolution

4
0:00:21.128,000 --> 0:00:23,000
in what it means to be a family.

5
0:00:23.184,000 --> 0:00:25,000
We have blended families, adopted families,

6
0:00:25.479,000 --> 0:00:27,000
we have nuclear families living in separate houses

7
0:00:27.784,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and divorced families living in the same house.

8
0:00:30.663,000 --> 0:00:33,000
But through it all, the family has grown stronger.

9
0:00:33.722,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Eight in 10 say the family they have today

10
0:00:36.271,000 --> 0:00:4,000
is as strong or stronger than the family they grew up in.

11
0:00:40.808,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Now, here's the bad news.

12
0:00:42.792,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Nearly everyone is completely overwhelmed

13
0:00:45.19,000 --> 0:00:47,000
by the chaos of family life.

14
0:00:47.501,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Every parent I know, myself included,

15
0:00:49.559,000 --> 0:00:51,000
feels like we're constantly playing defense.

16
0:00:52.155,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Just when our kids stop teething, they start having tantrums.

17
0:00:55.208,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Just when they stop needing our help taking a bath,

18
0:00:57.248,000 --> 0:01:,000
they need our help dealing with cyberstalking or bullying.

19
0:01:00.448,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And here's the worst news of all.

20
0:01:03.138,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Our children sense we're out of control.

21
0:01:06.064,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Ellen Galinsky of the Families and Work Institute

22
0:01:09.129,000 --> 0:01:11,000
asked 1,000 children, "If you were granted

23
0:01:11.408,000 --> 0:01:14,000
one wish about your parents, what would it be?"

24
0:01:14.841,000 --> 0:01:16,000
The parents predicted the kids would say,

25
0:01:17.159,000 --> 0:01:19,000
spending more time with them.

26
0:01:20.025,000 --> 0:01:22,000
They were wrong. The kids' number one wish?

27
0:01:22.87,000 --> 0:01:26,000
That their parents be less tired and less stressed.

28
0:01:27.216,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So how can we change this dynamic?

29
0:01:29.317,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Are there concrete things we can do to reduce stress,

30
0:01:32.535,000 --> 0:01:33,000
draw our family closer,

31
0:01:34.401,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and generally prepare our children to enter the world?

32
0:01:39.257,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I spent the last few years trying to answer that question,

33
0:01:42.453,000 --> 0:01:45,000
traveling around, meeting families, talking to scholars,

34
0:01:45.478,000 --> 0:01:48,000
experts ranging from elite peace negotiators

35
0:01:48.536,000 --> 0:01:52,000
to Warren Buffett's bankers to the Green Berets.

36
0:01:52.583,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I was trying to figure out, what do happy families do right

37
0:01:55.949,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and what can I learn from them to make my family happier?

38
0:02:00.935,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I want to tell you about one family that I met,

39
0:02:02.8,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and why I think they offer clues.

40
0:02:05.424,000 --> 0:02:07,000
At 7 p.m. on a Sunday in Hidden Springs, Idaho,

41
0:02:08.411,000 --> 0:02:1,000
where the six members of the Starr family are sitting down

42
0:02:10.719,000 --> 0:02:13,000
to the highlight of their week: the family meeting.

43
0:02:13.957,000 --> 0:02:15,000
The Starrs are a regular American family

44
0:02:16.182,000 --> 0:02:18,000
with their share of regular American family problems.

45
0:02:18.933,000 --> 0:02:2,000
David is a software engineer. Eleanor takes care

46
0:02:21.725,000 --> 0:02:23,000
of their four children, ages 10 to 15.

47
0:02:24.517,000 --> 0:02:27,000
One of those kids tutors math on the far side of town.

48
0:02:27.541,000 --> 0:02:29,000
One has lacrosse on the near side of town.

49
0:02:30.046,000 --> 0:02:33,000
One has Asperger syndrome. One has ADHD.

50
0:02:33.557,000 --> 0:02:36,000
"We were living in complete chaos," Eleanor said.

51
0:02:36.885,000 --> 0:02:39,000
What the Starrs did next, though, was surprising.

52
0:02:40.229,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Instead of turning to friends or relatives,

53
0:02:42.997,000 --> 0:02:44,000
they looked to David's workplace.

54
0:02:45.709,000 --> 0:02:47,000
They turned to a cutting-edge program called agile development

55
0:02:48.487,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that was just spreading from manufacturers in Japan

56
0:02:51.557,000 --> 0:02:53,000
to startups in Silicon Valley.

57
0:02:54.533,000 --> 0:02:56,000
In agile, workers are organized into small groups

58
0:02:57.401,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and do things in very short spans of time.

59
0:03:00.087,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So instead of having executives issue grand proclamations,

60
0:03:03.029,000 --> 0:03:06,000
the team in effect manages itself.

61
0:03:06.229,000 --> 0:03:08,000
You have constant feedback. You have daily update sessions.

62
0:03:08.86,000 --> 0:03:11,000
You have weekly reviews. You're constantly changing.

63
0:03:12.477,000 --> 0:03:15,000
David said when they brought this system into their home,

64
0:03:15.677,000 --> 0:03:18,000
the family meetings in particular increased communication,

65
0:03:19.093,000 --> 0:03:21,000
decreased stress, and made everybody

66
0:03:21.469,000 --> 0:03:24,000
happier to be part of the family team.

67
0:03:24.573,000 --> 0:03:26,000
When my wife and I adopted these family meetings and other techniques

68
0:03:27.556,000 --> 0:03:3,000
into the lives of our then-five-year-old twin daughters,

69
0:03:31.069,000 --> 0:03:35,000
it was the biggest single change we made since our daughters were born.

70
0:03:35.133,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And these meetings had this effect

71
0:03:37.322,000 --> 0:03:39,000
while taking under 20 minutes.

72
0:03:39.821,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So what is Agile, and why can it help

73
0:03:41.973,000 --> 0:03:43,000
with something that seems so different, like families?

74
0:03:44.701,000 --> 0:03:46,000
In 1983, Jeff Sutherland was a technologist

75
0:03:47.05,000 --> 0:03:49,000
at a financial firm in New England.

76
0:03:49.367,000 --> 0:03:52,000
He was very frustrated with how software got designed.

77
0:03:52.385,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Companies followed the waterfall method, right,

78
0:03:55.137,000 --> 0:03:58,000
in which executives issued orders that slowly trickled down

79
0:03:58.195,000 --> 0:03:59,000
to programmers below,

80
0:03:59.814,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and no one had ever consulted the programmers.

81
0:04:02.462,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Eighty-three percent of projects failed.

82
0:04:05.041,000 --> 0:04:07,000
They were too bloated or too out of date

83
0:04:07.438,000 --> 0:04:09,000
by the time they were done.

84
0:04:10.12,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Sutherland wanted to create a system where

85
0:04:12.564,000 --> 0:04:16,000
ideas didn't just percolate down but could percolate up from the bottom

86
0:04:16.742,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and be adjusted in real time.

87
0:04:19.287,000 --> 0:04:22,000
He read 30 years of Harvard Business Review

88
0:04:22.35,000 --> 0:04:24,000
before stumbling upon an article in 1986

89
0:04:25.142,000 --> 0:04:28,000
called "The New New Product Development Game."

90
0:04:28.221,000 --> 0:04:3,000
It said that the pace of business was quickening --

91
0:04:30.472,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and by the way, this was in 1986 --

92
0:04:32.601,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and the most successful companies were flexible.

93
0:04:36.566,000 --> 0:04:37,000
It highlighted Toyota and Canon

94
0:04:38.35,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and likened their adaptable, tight-knit teams to rugby scrums.

95
0:04:42.654,000 --> 0:04:44,000
As Sutherland told me, we got to that article,

96
0:04:45.019,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and said, "That's it."

97
0:04:47.184,000 --> 0:04:49,000
In Sutherland's system, companies don't use

98
0:04:49.901,000 --> 0:04:52,000
large, massive projects that take two years.

99
0:04:52.902,000 --> 0:04:53,000
They do things in small chunks.

100
0:04:54.13,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Nothing takes longer than two weeks.

101
0:04:56.579,000 --> 0:04:58,000
So instead of saying, "You guys go off into that bunker

102
0:04:58.645,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and come back with a cell phone or a social network,"

103
0:05:01.646,000 --> 0:05:03,000
you say, "You go off and come up with one element,

104
0:05:04.078,000 --> 0:05:06,000
then bring it back. Let's talk about it. Let's adapt."

105
0:05:06.598,000 --> 0:05:09,000
You succeed or fail quickly.

106
0:05:10.206,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Today, agile is used in a hundred countries,

107
0:05:13.374,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and it's sweeping into management suites.

108
0:05:16.312,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Inevitably, people began taking some of these techniques

109
0:05:18.822,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and applying it to their families.

110
0:05:21.097,000 --> 0:05:23,000
You had blogs pop up, and some manuals were written.

111
0:05:23.67,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Even the Sutherlands told me that they had

112
0:05:25.566,000 --> 0:05:26,000
an Agile Thanksgiving,

113
0:05:27.076,000 --> 0:05:29,000
where you had one group of people working on the food,

114
0:05:29.587,000 --> 0:05:32,000
one setting the table, and one greeting visitors at the door.

115
0:05:32.918,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Sutherland said it was the best Thanksgiving ever.

116
0:05:36.438,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So let's take one problem that families face,

117
0:05:39.118,000 --> 0:05:42,000
crazy mornings, and talk about how agile can help.

118
0:05:42.135,000 --> 0:05:44,000
A key plank is accountability,

119
0:05:44.301,000 --> 0:05:45,000
so teams use information radiators,

120
0:05:46.1,000 --> 0:05:49,000
these large boards in which everybody is accountable.

121
0:05:49.863,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So the Starrs, in adapting this to their home,

122
0:05:51.799,000 --> 0:05:52,000
created a morning checklist

123
0:05:53.46,000 --> 0:05:56,000
in which each child is expected to tick off chores.

124
0:05:57.048,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So on the morning I visited, Eleanor came downstairs,

125
0:05:59.428,000 --> 0:06:01,000
poured herself a cup of coffee, sat in a reclining chair,

126
0:06:02.138,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and she sat there,

127
0:06:03.646,000 --> 0:06:05,000
kind of amiably talking to each of her children

128
0:06:06.644,000 --> 0:06:07,000
as one after the other they came downstairs,

129
0:06:08.635,000 --> 0:06:1,000
checked the list, made themselves breakfast,

130
0:06:11.004,000 --> 0:06:13,000
checked the list again, put the dishes in the dishwasher,

131
0:06:13.787,000 --> 0:06:16,000
rechecked the list, fed the pets or whatever chores they had,

132
0:06:16.907,000 --> 0:06:18,000
checked the list once more, gathered their belongings,

133
0:06:19.331,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and made their way to the bus.

134
0:06:21.968,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It was one of the most astonishing family dynamics I have ever seen.

135
0:06:26.045,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And when I strenuously objected this would never work in our house,

136
0:06:29.187,000 --> 0:06:31,000
our kids needed way too much monitoring,

137
0:06:31.37,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Eleanor looked at me.

138
0:06:32.67,000 --> 0:06:33,000
"That's what I thought," she said.

139
0:06:33.838,000 --> 0:06:35,000
"I told David, 'keep your work out of my kitchen.'

140
0:06:36.158,000 --> 0:06:37,000
But I was wrong."

141
0:06:37.779,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So I turned to David: "So why does it work?"

142
0:06:39.883,000 --> 0:06:41,000
He said, "You can't underestimate the power of doing this."

143
0:06:42.819,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And he made a checkmark.

144
0:06:44.353,000 --> 0:06:46,000
He said, "In the workplace, adults love it.

145
0:06:46.489,000 --> 0:06:48,000
With kids, it's heaven."

146
0:06:48.965,000 --> 0:06:5,000
The week we introduced a morning checklist into our house,

147
0:06:51.802,000 --> 0:06:55,000
it cut parental screaming in half. (Laughter)

148
0:06:55.949,000 --> 0:06:58,000
But the real change didn't come until we had these family meetings.

149
0:06:59.034,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So following the agile model, we ask three questions:

150
0:07:02.355,000 --> 0:07:03,000
What worked well in our family this week,

151
0:07:04.277,000 --> 0:07:08,000
what didn't work well, and what will we agree to work on in the week ahead?

152
0:07:08.437,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Everyone throws out suggestions

153
0:07:10.024,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and then we pick two to focus on.

154
0:07:12.756,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And suddenly the most amazing things started coming out of our daughters' mouths.

155
0:07:16.658,000 --> 0:07:18,000
What worked well this week?

156
0:07:18.778,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Getting over our fear of riding bikes. Making our beds.

157
0:07:21.698,000 --> 0:07:23,000
What didn't work well? Our math sheets,

158
0:07:24.61,000 --> 0:07:27,000
or greeting visitors at the door.

159
0:07:27.797,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Like a lot of parents, our kids are something like Bermuda Triangles.

160
0:07:31.225,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Like, thoughts and ideas go in, but none ever comes out,

161
0:07:33.77,000 --> 0:07:34,000
I mean at least not that are revealing.

162
0:07:35.304,000 --> 0:07:38,000
This gave us access suddenly to their innermost thoughts.

163
0:07:39.067,000 --> 0:07:4,000
But the most surprising part was when we turned to,

164
0:07:40.854,000 --> 0:07:42,000
what are we going to work on in the week ahead?

165
0:07:43.508,000 --> 0:07:45,000
You know, the key idea of agile is that

166
0:07:45.525,000 --> 0:07:46,000
teams essentially manage themselves,

167
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and it works in software and it turns out that it works with kids.

168
0:07:50.674,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Our kids love this process.

169
0:07:52.365,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So they would come up with all these ideas.

170
0:07:54.554,000 --> 0:07:56,000
You know, greet five visitors at the door this week,

171
0:07:56.6,000 --> 0:07:58,000
get an extra 10 minutes of reading before bed.

172
0:07:59.163,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Kick someone, lose desserts for a month.

173
0:08:01.975,000 --> 0:08:03,000
It turns out, by the way, our girls are little Stalins.

174
0:08:04.142,000 --> 0:08:06,000
We constantly have to kind of dial them back.

175
0:08:07.087,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Now look, naturally there's a gap between

176
0:08:09.079,000 --> 0:08:12,000
their kind of conduct in these meetings and their behavior the rest of the week,

177
0:08:12.447,000 --> 0:08:14,000
but the truth is it didn't really bother us.

178
0:08:14.561,000 --> 0:08:16,000
It felt like we were kind of laying these underground cables

179
0:08:16.911,000 --> 0:08:19,000
that wouldn't light up their world for many years to come.

180
0:08:20.241,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Three years later -- our girls are almost eight now --

181
0:08:22.671,000 --> 0:08:24,000
We're still holding these meetings.

182
0:08:25.108,000 --> 0:08:29,000
My wife counts them among her most treasured moments as a mom.

183
0:08:29.84,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So what did we learn?

184
0:08:32.223,000 --> 0:08:34,000
The word "agile" entered the lexicon in 2001

185
0:08:34.724,000 --> 0:08:36,000
when Jeff Sutherland and a group of designers

186
0:08:36.924,000 --> 0:08:4,000
met in Utah and wrote a 12-point Agile Manifesto.

187
0:08:41.056,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I think the time is right for an Agile Family Manifesto.

188
0:08:44.587,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I've taken some ideas from the Starrs and from many other families I met.

189
0:08:47.962,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I'm proposing three planks.

190
0:08:50.721,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Plank number one: Adapt all the time.

191
0:08:54.289,000 --> 0:08:55,000
When I became a parent, I figured, you know what?

192
0:08:56.075,000 --> 0:08:59,000
We'll set a few rules and we'll stick to them.

193
0:08:59.174,000 --> 0:09:02,000
That assumes, as parents, we can anticipate every problem that's going to arise.

194
0:09:02.823,000 --> 0:09:05,000
We can't. What's great about the agile system

195
0:09:06.257,000 --> 0:09:07,000
is you build in a system of change

196
0:09:08.123,000 --> 0:09:11,000
so that you can react to what's happening to you in real time.

197
0:09:11.154,000 --> 0:09:12,000
It's like they say in the Internet world:

198
0:09:12.598,000 --> 0:09:14,000
if you're doing the same thing today you were doing six months ago,

199
0:09:15.342,000 --> 0:09:16,000
you're doing the wrong thing.

200
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Parents can learn a lot from that.

201
0:09:19.908,000 --> 0:09:22,000
But to me, "adapt all the time" means something deeper, too.

202
0:09:23.22,000 --> 0:09:25,000
We have to break parents out of this straitjacket

203
0:09:25.596,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that the only ideas we can try at home

204
0:09:27.933,000 --> 0:09:3,000
are ones that come from shrinks or self-help gurus

205
0:09:31.3,000 --> 0:09:33,000
or other family experts.

206
0:09:33.62,000 --> 0:09:35,000
The truth is, their ideas are stale,

207
0:09:35.892,000 --> 0:09:37,000
whereas in all these other worlds there are these new ideas

208
0:09:38.188,000 --> 0:09:41,000
to make groups and teams work effectively.

209
0:09:41.513,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Let's just take a few examples.

210
0:09:42.648,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Let's take the biggest issue of all: family dinner.

211
0:09:45.868,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Everybody knows that having family dinner

212
0:09:47.925,000 --> 0:09:49,000
with your children is good for the kids.

213
0:09:50.253,000 --> 0:09:52,000
But for so many of us, it doesn't work in our lives.

214
0:09:53.212,000 --> 0:09:55,000
I met a celebrity chef in New Orleans who said,

215
0:09:55.484,000 --> 0:09:57,000
"No problem, I'll just time-shift family dinner.

216
0:09:57.863,000 --> 0:09:59,000
I'm not home, can't make family dinner?

217
0:09:59.999,000 --> 0:10:01,000
We'll have family breakfast. We'll meet for a bedtime snack.

218
0:10:02.991,000 --> 0:10:04,000
We'll make Sunday meals more important."

219
0:10:05.857,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And the truth is, recent research backs him up.

220
0:10:09.407,000 --> 0:10:11,000
It turns out there's only 10 minutes of productive time

221
0:10:12.319,000 --> 0:10:13,000
in any family meal.

222
0:10:14.156,000 --> 0:10:17,000
The rest of it's taken up with "take your elbows off the table" and "pass the ketchup."

223
0:10:18.074,000 --> 0:10:2,000
You can take that 10 minutes and move it

224
0:10:20.111,000 --> 0:10:23,000
to any part of the day and have the same benefit.

225
0:10:23.391,000 --> 0:10:25,000
So time-shift family dinner. That's adaptability.

226
0:10:26.216,000 --> 0:10:28,000
An environmental psychologist told me,

227
0:10:28.506,000 --> 0:10:31,000
"If you're sitting in a hard chair on a rigid surface,

228
0:10:31.841,000 --> 0:10:32,000
you'll be more rigid.

229
0:10:33.291,000 --> 0:10:36,000
If you're sitting on a cushioned chair, you'll be more open."

230
0:10:37.194,000 --> 0:10:38,000
She told me, "When you're discipling your children,

231
0:10:38.801,000 --> 0:10:4,000
sit in an upright chair with a cushioned surface.

232
0:10:41.199,000 --> 0:10:43,000
The conversation will go better."

233
0:10:43.753,000 --> 0:10:46,000
My wife and I actually moved where we sit for difficult conversations

234
0:10:47.37,000 --> 0:10:49,000
because I was sitting above in the power position.

235
0:10:50.19,000 --> 0:10:53,000
So move where you sit. That's adaptability.

236
0:10:53.23,000 --> 0:10:56,000
The point is there are all these new ideas out there.

237
0:10:56.584,000 --> 0:10:58,000
We've got to hook them up with parents.

238
0:10:58.971,000 --> 0:11:,000
So plank number one: Adapt all the time.

239
0:11:01.398,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Be flexible, be open-minded, let the best ideas win.

240
0:11:05.838,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Plank number two: Empower your children.

241
0:11:09.934,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Our instinct as parents is to order our kids around.

242
0:11:12.948,000 --> 0:11:14,000
It's easier, and frankly, we're usually right.

243
0:11:15.542,000 --> 0:11:17,000
There's a reason that few systems have been more

244
0:11:17.605,000 --> 0:11:2,000
waterfall over time than the family.

245
0:11:20.657,000 --> 0:11:21,000
But the single biggest lesson we learned

246
0:11:22.474,000 --> 0:11:24,000
is to reverse the waterfall as much as possible.

247
0:11:25.361,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Enlist the children in their own upbringing.

248
0:11:29.226,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Just yesterday, we were having our family meeting,

249
0:11:31.114,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and we had voted to work on overreacting.

250
0:11:33.993,000 --> 0:11:36,000
So we said, "Okay, give us a reward and give us a punishment. Okay?"

251
0:11:37.289,000 --> 0:11:41,000
So one of my daughters threw out, you get five minutes of overreacting time all week.

252
0:11:41.865,000 --> 0:11:42,000
So we kind of liked that.

253
0:11:43.623,000 --> 0:11:44,000
But then her sister started working the system.

254
0:11:45.262,000 --> 0:11:48,000
She said, "Do I get one five-minute overreaction

255
0:11:48.399,000 --> 0:11:51,000
or can I get 10 30-second overreactions?"

256
0:11:51.869,000 --> 0:11:53,000
I loved that. Spend the time however you want.

257
0:11:54.097,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Now give us a punishment. Okay.

258
0:11:56.369,000 --> 0:12:,000
If we get 15 minutes of overreaction time, that's the limit.

259
0:12:01.273,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Every minute above that, we have to do one pushup.

260
0:12:04.697,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So you see, this is working. Now look, this system isn't lax.

261
0:12:08.081,000 --> 0:12:1,000
There's plenty of parental authority going on.

262
0:12:10.809,000 --> 0:12:12,000
But we're giving them practice becoming independent,

263
0:12:13.524,000 --> 0:12:15,000
which of course is our ultimate goal.

264
0:12:16.091,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Just as I was leaving to come here tonight,

265
0:12:18.409,000 --> 0:12:19,000
one of my daughters started screaming.

266
0:12:20.233,000 --> 0:12:22,000
The other one said, "Overreaction! Overreaction!"

267
0:12:22.748,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and started counting, and within 10 seconds it had ended.

268
0:12:25.677,000 --> 0:12:28,000
To me that is a certified agile miracle.

269
0:12:29.186,000 --> 0:12:31,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

270
0:12:31.393,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And by the way, research backs this up too.

271
0:12:36.129,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Children who plan their own goals, set weekly schedules,

272
0:12:39.705,000 --> 0:12:42,000
evaluate their own work build up their frontal cortex

273
0:12:43.63,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and take more control over their lives.

274
0:12:47.857,000 --> 0:12:5,000
The point is, we have to let our children succeed on their own terms,

275
0:12:51.009,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and yes, on occasion, fail on their own terms.

276
0:12:54.113,000 --> 0:12:55,000
I was talking to Warren Buffett's banker,

277
0:12:55.861,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and he was chiding me for not letting my children

278
0:12:58.103,000 --> 0:13:,000
make mistakes with their allowance.

279
0:13:00.772,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And I said, "But what if they drive into a ditch?"

280
0:13:02.748,000 --> 0:13:04,000
He said, "It's much better to drive into a ditch

281
0:13:04.889,000 --> 0:13:07,000
with a $6 allowance than a $60,000-a-year salary

282
0:13:08.321,000 --> 0:13:1,000
or a $6 million inheritance."

283
0:13:10.993,000 --> 0:13:12,000
So the bottom line is, empower your children.

284
0:13:13.473,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Plank number three: Tell your story.

285
0:13:18.259,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Adaptability is fine, but we also need bedrock.

286
0:13:22.222,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Jim Collins, the author of "Good To Great,"

287
0:13:24.162,000 --> 0:13:26,000
told me that successful human organizations of any kind

288
0:13:26.865,000 --> 0:13:27,000
have two things in common:

289
0:13:28.379,000 --> 0:13:31,000
they preserve the core, they stimulate progress.

290
0:13:31.674,000 --> 0:13:33,000
So agile is great for stimulating progress,

291
0:13:33.879,000 --> 0:13:36,000
but I kept hearing time and again, you need to preserve the core.

292
0:13:37.161,000 --> 0:13:39,000
So how do you do that?

293
0:13:39.215,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Collins coached us on doing something

294
0:13:41.422,000 --> 0:13:43,000
that businesses do, which is define your mission

295
0:13:44.209,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and identify your core values.

296
0:13:46.603,000 --> 0:13:49,000
So he led us through the process of creating a family mission statement.

297
0:13:50.161,000 --> 0:13:52,000
We did the family equivalent of a corporate retreat.

298
0:13:52.425,000 --> 0:13:54,000
We had a pajama party.

299
0:13:54.729,000 --> 0:13:57,000
I made popcorn. Actually, I burned one, so I made two.

300
0:13:58.289,000 --> 0:13:58,000
My wife bought a flip chart.

301
0:13:59.161,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And we had this great conversation, like, what's important to us?

302
0:14:01.778,000 --> 0:14:03,000
What values do we most uphold?

303
0:14:03.903,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And we ended up with 10 statements.

304
0:14:05.659,000 --> 0:14:06,000
We are travelers, not tourists.

305
0:14:07.63,000 --> 0:14:1,000
We don't like dilemmas. We like solutions.

306
0:14:11.305,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Again, research shows that parents should spend less time

307
0:14:14.536,000 --> 0:14:16,000
worrying about what they do wrong

308
0:14:16.875,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and more time focusing on what they do right,

309
0:14:20.032,000 --> 0:14:24,000
worry less about the bad times and build up the good times.

310
0:14:24.143,000 --> 0:14:26,000
This family mission statement is a great way to identify

311
0:14:26.879,000 --> 0:14:28,000
what it is that you do right.

312
0:14:29.399,000 --> 0:14:31,000
A few weeks later, we got a call from the school.

313
0:14:31.689,000 --> 0:14:32,000
One of our daughters had gotten into a spat.

314
0:14:33.677,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And suddenly we were worried, like, do we have a mean girl on our hands?

315
0:14:36.033,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And we didn't really know what to do,

316
0:14:37.287,000 --> 0:14:38,000
so we called her into my office.

317
0:14:38.715,000 --> 0:14:39,000
The family mission statement was on the wall,

318
0:14:40.372,000 --> 0:14:43,000
and my wife said, "So, anything up there seem to apply?"

319
0:14:43.483,000 --> 0:14:45,000
And she kind of looked down the list, and she said,

320
0:14:46.359,000 --> 0:14:47,000
"Bring people together?"

321
0:14:48.087,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Suddenly we had a way into the conversation.

322
0:14:51.543,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Another great way to tell your story

323
0:14:52.875,000 --> 0:14:55,000
is to tell your children where they came from.

324
0:14:56.17,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Researchers at Emory gave children a simple

325
0:14:58.871,000 --> 0:15:,000
"what do you know" test.

326
0:15:00.953,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Do you know where your grandparents were born?

327
0:15:03.031,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Do you know where your parents went to high school?

328
0:15:05.495,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Do you know anybody in your family

329
0:15:07.28,000 --> 0:15:1,000
who had a difficult situation, an illness, and they overcame it?

330
0:15:11.279,000 --> 0:15:14,000
The children who scored highest on this "do you know" scale

331
0:15:14.849,000 --> 0:15:18,000
had the highest self-esteem and a greater sense they could control their lives.

332
0:15:19.415,000 --> 0:15:22,000
The "do you know" test was the single biggest predictor

333
0:15:22.671,000 --> 0:15:24,000
of emotional health and happiness.

334
0:15:25.375,000 --> 0:15:27,000
As the author of the study told me,

335
0:15:27.551,000 --> 0:15:3,000
children who have a sense of -- they're part of a larger narrative

336
0:15:31.405,000 --> 0:15:33,000
have greater self-confidence.

337
0:15:34.359,000 --> 0:15:36,000
So my final plank is, tell your story.

338
0:15:37.335,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Spend time retelling the story of your family's positive moments

339
0:15:41.326,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and how you overcame the negative ones.

340
0:15:44.167,000 --> 0:15:46,000
If you give children this happy narrative,

341
0:15:46.623,000 --> 0:15:51,000
you give them the tools to make themselves happier.

342
0:15:52.334,000 --> 0:15:54,000
I was a teenager when I first read "Anna Karenina"

343
0:15:54.757,000 --> 0:15:55,000
and its famous opening sentence,

344
0:15:56.509,000 --> 0:15:57,000
"All happy families are alike.

345
0:15:58.468,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."

346
0:16:02.559,000 --> 0:16:05,000
When I first read that, I thought, "That sentence is inane.

347
0:16:05.783,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Of course all happy families aren't alike."

348
0:16:08.906,000 --> 0:16:1,000
But as I began working on this project,

349
0:16:11.247,000 --> 0:16:13,000
I began changing my mind.

350
0:16:13.959,000 --> 0:16:15,000
Recent scholarship has allowed us, for the first time,

351
0:16:16.511,000 --> 0:16:18,000
to identify the building blocks

352
0:16:19.247,000 --> 0:16:21,000
that successful families have.

353
0:16:22.223,000 --> 0:16:24,000
I've mentioned just three here today:

354
0:16:24.367,000 --> 0:16:29,000
Adapt all the time, empower the children, tell your story.

355
0:16:29.549,000 --> 0:16:33,000
Is it possible, all these years later, to say Tolstoy was right?

356
0:16:33.92,000 --> 0:16:36,000
The answer, I believe, is yes.

357
0:16:37.296,000 --> 0:16:39,000
When Leo Tolstoy was five years old,

358
0:16:40.008,000 --> 0:16:41,000
his brother Nikolay came to him

359
0:16:41.75,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and said he had engraved the secret to universal happiness

360
0:16:44.724,000 --> 0:16:46,000
on a little green stick, which he had hidden

361
0:16:47.504,000 --> 0:16:5,000
in a ravine on the family's estate in Russia.

362
0:16:50.62,000 --> 0:16:54,000
If the stick were ever found, all humankind would be happy.

363
0:16:55.053,000 --> 0:17:,000
Tolstoy became consumed with that stick, but he never found it.

364
0:17:00.549,000 --> 0:17:04,000
In fact, he asked to be buried in that ravine where he thought it was hidden.

365
0:17:04.9,000 --> 0:17:08,000
He still lies there today, covered in a layer of green grass.

366
0:17:09.445,000 --> 0:17:11,000
That story perfectly captures for me

367
0:17:11.996,000 --> 0:17:13,000
the final lesson that I learned:

368
0:17:14.204,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Happiness is not something we find,

369
0:17:16.868,000 --> 0:17:18,000
it's something we make.

370
0:17:19.764,000 --> 0:17:22,000
Almost anybody who's looked at well-run organizations

371
0:17:23.034,000 --> 0:17:25,000
has come to pretty much the same conclusion.

372
0:17:26.015,000 --> 0:17:28,000
Greatness is not a matter of circumstance.

373
0:17:28.404,000 --> 0:17:3,000
It's a matter of choice.

374
0:17:31.268,000 --> 0:17:34,000
You don't need some grand plan. You don't need a waterfall.

375
0:17:34.732,000 --> 0:17:36,000
You just need to take small steps,

376
0:17:36.916,000 --> 0:17:38,000
accumulate small wins,

377
0:17:39.108,000 --> 0:17:41,000
keep reaching for that green stick.

378
0:17:41.932,000 --> 0:17:44,000
In the end, this may be the greatest lesson of all.

379
0:17:45.581,000 --> 0:17:49,000
What's the secret to a happy family? Try.

380
0:17:49.748,000 --> 0:17:53,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.891,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Is there a real you?

2
0:00:13.988,000 --> 0:00:15,000
This might seem to you like a very odd question.

3
0:00:16.338,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Because, you might ask,

4
0:00:18.897,000 --> 0:00:2,000
how do we find the real you,

5
0:00:21.225,000 --> 0:00:23,000
how do you know what the real you is?

6
0:00:23.259,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And so forth.

7
0:00:24.223,000 --> 0:00:27,000
But the idea that there must be a real you,

8
0:00:27.591,000 --> 0:00:28,000
surely that's obvious.

9
0:00:28.634,000 --> 0:00:31,000
If there's anything real in the world, it's you.

10
0:00:31.895,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Well, I'm not quite sure.

11
0:00:33.84,000 --> 0:00:35,000
At least we have to understand a bit better what that means.

12
0:00:36.457,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Now certainly, I think there are lots of things in our culture around us

13
0:00:40.291,000 --> 0:00:42,000
which sort of reinforce the idea

14
0:00:42.498,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that for each one of us, we have a kind of a core, an essence.

15
0:00:46.249,000 --> 0:00:49,000
There is something about what it means to be you which defines you,

16
0:00:49.683,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and it's kind of permanent and unchanging.

17
0:00:52.003,000 --> 0:00:53,000
The most kind of crude way in which we have it,

18
0:00:53.813,000 --> 0:00:54,000
are things like horoscopes.

19
0:00:55.107,000 --> 0:00:58,000
You know, people are very wedded to these, actually.

20
0:00:58.147,000 --> 0:00:59,000
People put them on their Facebook profile

21
0:01:00.111,000 --> 0:01:01,000
as though they are meaningul,

22
0:01:01.594,000 --> 0:01:03,000
you even know your Chinese horoscope as well.

23
0:01:04.271,000 --> 0:01:06,000
There are also more scientific versions of this,

24
0:01:06.724,000 --> 0:01:09,000
all sorts of ways of profiling personality type,

25
0:01:09.781,000 --> 0:01:11,000
such as the Myers-Briggs tests, for example.

26
0:01:12.454,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I don't know if you've done those.

27
0:01:13.835,000 --> 0:01:14,000
A lot of companies use these for recruitment.

28
0:01:15.739,000 --> 0:01:18,000
You answer a lot of questions,

29
0:01:19.036,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and this is supposed to reveal something about your core personality.

30
0:01:22.792,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And of course, the popular fascination with this is enormous.

31
0:01:26.093,000 --> 0:01:27,000
In magazines like this, you'll see,

32
0:01:27.761,000 --> 0:01:3,000
in the bottom left corner, they'll advertise in virtually every issue

33
0:01:31.223,000 --> 0:01:33,000
some kind of personality thing.

34
0:01:33.333,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And if you pick up one of those magazines,

35
0:01:35.113,000 --> 0:01:36,000
it's hard to resist, isn't it?

36
0:01:36.361,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Doing the test to find what is your learning style,

37
0:01:39.226,000 --> 0:01:42,000
what is your loving style, or what is your working style?

38
0:01:42.354,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Are you this kind of person or that?

39
0:01:44.954,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So I think that we have a common-sense idea

40
0:01:48.987,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that there is a kind of core or essence of ourselves

41
0:01:51.634,000 --> 0:01:52,000
to be discovered.

42
0:01:53.168,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And that this is kind of a permanent truth about ourselves,

43
0:01:56.424,000 --> 0:01:58,000
something that's the same throughout life.

44
0:01:58.864,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Well, that's the idea I want to challenge.

45
0:02:02.615,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And I have to say now, I'll say it a bit later,

46
0:02:04.457,000 --> 0:02:06,000
but I'm not challenging this just because I'm weird,

47
0:02:07.285,000 --> 0:02:1,000
the challenge actually has a very, very long and distinguished history.

48
0:02:11.082,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Here's the common-sense idea.

49
0:02:13.251,000 --> 0:02:14,000
There is you.

50
0:02:14.287,000 --> 0:02:17,000
You are the individuals you are, and you have this kind of core.

51
0:02:17.595,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Now in your life, what happens is that you, of course,

52
0:02:22.227,000 --> 0:02:24,000
accumulate different experiences and so forth.

53
0:02:24.446,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So you have memories,

54
0:02:26.716,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and these memories help to create what you are.

55
0:02:28.966,000 --> 0:02:3,000
You have desires, maybe for a cookie,

56
0:02:31.623,000 --> 0:02:33,000
maybe for something that we don't want to talk about

57
0:02:34.418,000 --> 0:02:35,000
at 11 o'clock in the morning in a school.

58
0:02:36.293,000 --> 0:02:37,000
You will have beliefs.

59
0:02:38.274,000 --> 0:02:39,000
This is a number plate from someone in America.

60
0:02:40.187,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I don't know whether this number plate, which says "messiah 1,"

61
0:02:42.959,000 --> 0:02:44,000
indicates that the driver believes in the messiah,

62
0:02:45.251,000 --> 0:02:47,000
or that they are the messiah.

63
0:02:47.445,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Either way, they have beliefs about messiahs.

64
0:02:50.158,000 --> 0:02:51,000
We have knowledge.

65
0:02:51.62,000 --> 0:02:53,000
We have sensations and experiences as well.

66
0:02:53.878,000 --> 0:02:55,000
It's not just intellectual things.

67
0:02:56.395,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So this is kind of the common-sense model, I think,

68
0:02:58.998,000 --> 0:02:59,000
of what a person is.

69
0:03:00.15,000 --> 0:03:06,000
There is a person who has all the things that make up our life experiences.

70
0:03:06.441,000 --> 0:03:08,000
But the suggestion I want to put to you today

71
0:03:08.96,000 --> 0:03:11,000
is that there's something fundamentally wrong with this model.

72
0:03:12.395,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And I can show you what's wrong with one click.

73
0:03:14.853,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Which is there isn't actually a "you" at the heart of all these experiences.

74
0:03:21.708,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Strange thought? Well, maybe not.

75
0:03:23.321,000 --> 0:03:24,000
What is there, then?

76
0:03:25.079,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Well, clearly there are memories, desires, intentions, sensations,

77
0:03:28.348,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and so forth.

78
0:03:30.291,000 --> 0:03:32,000
But what happens is these things exist,

79
0:03:32.549,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and they're kind of all integrated,

80
0:03:34.618,000 --> 0:03:37,000
they're overlapped, they're connected in various different ways.

81
0:03:38.407,000 --> 0:03:4,000
They're connecting partly, and perhaps even mainly,

82
0:03:40.997,000 --> 0:03:43,000
because they all belong to one body and one brain.

83
0:03:44.324,000 --> 0:03:47,000
But there's also a narrative, a story we tell about ourselves,

84
0:03:47.387,000 --> 0:03:49,000
the experiences we have when we remember past things.

85
0:03:50.282,000 --> 0:03:52,000
We do things because of other things.

86
0:03:52.514,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So what we desire is partly a result of what we believe,

87
0:03:56.126,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and what we remember is also informing us what we know.

88
0:03:59.692,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And so really, there are all these things,

89
0:04:02.354,000 --> 0:04:05,000
like beliefs, desires, sensations, experiences,

90
0:04:05.393,000 --> 0:04:07,000
they're all related to each other,

91
0:04:07.823,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and that just is you.

92
0:04:11.371,000 --> 0:04:15,000
In some ways, it's a small difference from the common-sense understanding.

93
0:04:16.208,000 --> 0:04:18,000
In some ways, it's a massive one.

94
0:04:18.462,000 --> 0:04:2,000
It's the shift between thinking of yourself

95
0:04:20.638,000 --> 0:04:23,000
as a thing which has all the experiences of life,

96
0:04:24.034,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and thinking of yourself as simply that collection

97
0:04:26.977,000 --> 0:04:28,000
of all experiences in life.

98
0:04:28.999,000 --> 0:04:3,000
You are the sum of your parts.

99
0:04:31.847,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Now those parts are also physical parts, of course,

100
0:04:33.969,000 --> 0:04:34,000
brains, bodies and legs and things,

101
0:04:35.871,000 --> 0:04:37,000
but they aren't so important, actually.

102
0:04:38.174,000 --> 0:04:4,000
If you have a heart transplant, you're still the same person.

103
0:04:40.847,000 --> 0:04:42,000
If you have a memory transplant, are you the same person?

104
0:04:43.227,000 --> 0:04:46,000
If you have a belief transplant, would you be the same person?

105
0:04:46.602,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Now this idea, that what we are, the way to understand ourselves,

106
0:04:51.501,000 --> 0:04:55,000
is as not of some permanent being, which has experiences,

107
0:04:55.962,000 --> 0:04:57,000
but is kind of a collection of experiences,

108
0:04:58.36,000 --> 0:05:,000
might strike you as kind of weird.

109
0:05:00.971,000 --> 0:05:02,000
But actually, I don't think it should be weird.

110
0:05:03.055,000 --> 0:05:04,000
In a way, it's common sense.

111
0:05:04.914,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Because I just invite you to think about, by comparison,

112
0:05:09.215,000 --> 0:05:11,000
think about pretty much anything else in the universe,

113
0:05:12.172,000 --> 0:05:14,000
maybe apart from the very most fundamental forces or powers.

114
0:05:14.922,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Let's take something like water.

115
0:05:17.657,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Now my science isn't very good.

116
0:05:20.198,000 --> 0:05:23,000
We might say something like water has two parts hydrogen

117
0:05:23.213,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and one parts oxygen, right?

118
0:05:25.099,000 --> 0:05:26,000
We all know that.

119
0:05:26.747,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I hope no one in this room thinks that what that means

120
0:05:30.212,000 --> 0:05:34,000
is there is a thing called water, and attached to it

121
0:05:34.414,000 --> 0:05:36,000
are hydrogen and oxygen atoms,

122
0:05:37.051,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and that's what water is.

123
0:05:38.244,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Of course we don't.

124
0:05:39.099,000 --> 0:05:42,000
We understand, very easily, very straightforwardly,

125
0:05:42.351,000 --> 0:05:43,000
that water is nothing more

126
0:05:44.083,000 --> 0:05:49,000
than the hydrogen and oxygen molecules suitably arranged.

127
0:05:49.117,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Everything else in the universe is the same.

128
0:05:51.03,000 --> 0:05:55,000
There's no mystery about my watch, for example.

129
0:05:55.199,000 --> 0:05:58,000
We say the watch has a face, and hands,

130
0:05:58.562,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and a mechanism and a battery,

131
0:06:00.362,000 --> 0:06:01,000
But what we really mean is,

132
0:06:01.523,000 --> 0:06:02,000
we don't think there is a thing called the watch

133
0:06:03.128,000 --> 0:06:05,000
to which we then attach all these bits.

134
0:06:05.861,000 --> 0:06:08,000
We understand very clearly that you get the parts of the watch,

135
0:06:08.897,000 --> 0:06:1,000
you put them together, and you create a watch.

136
0:06:10.994,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Now if everything else in the universe is like this,

137
0:06:13.638,000 --> 0:06:15,000
why are we different?

138
0:06:15.944,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Why think of ourselves

139
0:06:17.508,000 --> 0:06:2,000
as somehow not just being a collection of all our parts,

140
0:06:21.46,000 --> 0:06:25,000
but somehow being a separate, permanent entity which has those parts?

141
0:06:26.328,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Now this view is not particularly new, actually.

142
0:06:29.438,000 --> 0:06:3,000
It has quite a long lineage.

143
0:06:31.113,000 --> 0:06:32,000
You find it in Buddhism,

144
0:06:32.463,000 --> 0:06:34,000
you find it in 17th, 18th-century philosophy

145
0:06:35.009,000 --> 0:06:38,000
going through to the current day, people like Locke and Hume.

146
0:06:38.604,000 --> 0:06:4,000
But interestingly, it's also a view

147
0:06:40.687,000 --> 0:06:44,000
increasingly being heard reinforced by neuroscience.

148
0:06:44.731,000 --> 0:06:47,000
This is Paul Broks, he's a clinical neuropsychologist,

149
0:06:48.375,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and he says this:

150
0:06:49.574,000 --> 0:06:51,000
"We have a deep intuition that there is a core,

151
0:06:51.956,000 --> 0:06:53,000
an essence there, and it's hard to shake off,

152
0:06:54.505,000 --> 0:06:57,000
probably impossible to shake off, I suspect.

153
0:06:57.516,000 --> 0:07:,000
But it's true that neuroscience shows that there is no centre in the brain

154
0:07:01.443,000 --> 0:07:03,000
where things do all come together."

155
0:07:03.733,000 --> 0:07:05,000
So when you look at the brain,

156
0:07:06.203,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and you look at how the brain makes possible a sense of self,

157
0:07:10.22,000 --> 0:07:13,000
you find that there isn't a central control spot in the brain.

158
0:07:14.004,000 --> 0:07:17,000
There is no kind of center where everything happens.

159
0:07:17.303,000 --> 0:07:19,000
There are lots of different processes in the brain,

160
0:07:19.888,000 --> 0:07:22,000
all of which operate, in a way, quite independently.

161
0:07:22.987,000 --> 0:07:25,000
But it's because of the way that they relate

162
0:07:26.097,000 --> 0:07:28,000
that we get this sense of self.

163
0:07:28.958,000 --> 0:07:31,000
The term I use in the book, I call it the ego trick.

164
0:07:32.447,000 --> 0:07:36,000
It's like a mechanical trick.

165
0:07:37.106,000 --> 0:07:39,000
It's not that we don't exist,

166
0:07:39.586,000 --> 0:07:42,000
it's just that the trick is to make us feel that inside of us

167
0:07:42.87,000 --> 0:07:45,000
is something more unified than is really there.

168
0:07:46.356,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Now you might think this is a worrying idea.

169
0:07:49.493,000 --> 0:07:51,000
You might think that if it's true,

170
0:07:51.825,000 --> 0:07:54,000
that for each one of us there is no abiding core of self,

171
0:07:55.576,000 --> 0:07:56,000
no permanent essence,

172
0:07:57.561,000 --> 0:08:,000
does that mean that really, the self is an illusion?

173
0:08:01.493,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Does it mean that we really don't exist?

174
0:08:03.807,000 --> 0:08:04,000
There is no real you.

175
0:08:05.615,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Well, a lot of people actually do use this talk of illusion and so forth.

176
0:08:08.696,000 --> 0:08:11,000
These are three psychologists, Thomas Metzinger, Bruce Hood,

177
0:08:12.674,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Susan Blackmore,

178
0:08:14.978,000 --> 0:08:16,000
a lot of these people do talk the language of illusion,

179
0:08:17.963,000 --> 0:08:19,000
the self is an illusion, it's a fiction.

180
0:08:20.029,000 --> 0:08:23,000
But I don't think this is a very helpful way of looking at it.

181
0:08:23.075,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Go back to the watch.

182
0:08:23.852,000 --> 0:08:27,000
The watch isn't an illusion, because there is nothing to the watch

183
0:08:27.904,000 --> 0:08:29,000
other than a collection of its parts.

184
0:08:30.152,000 --> 0:08:31,000
In the same way, we're not illusions either.

185
0:08:32.109,000 --> 0:08:37,000
The fact that we are, in some ways, just this very, very complex collection,

186
0:08:37.552,000 --> 0:08:38,000
ordered collection of things,

187
0:08:39.137,000 --> 0:08:4,000
does not mean we're not real.

188
0:08:41.012,000 --> 0:08:43,000
I can give you a very sort of rough metaphor for this.

189
0:08:43.911,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Let's take something like a waterfall.

190
0:08:46.516,000 --> 0:08:49,000
These are the Iguazu Falls, in Argentina.

191
0:08:50.123,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Now if you take something like this,

192
0:08:52.625,000 --> 0:08:55,000
you can appreciate the fact that in lots of ways,

193
0:08:55.919,000 --> 0:08:57,000
there's nothing permanent about this.

194
0:08:58.029,000 --> 0:08:59,000
For one thing, it's always changing.

195
0:08:59.462,000 --> 0:09:01,000
The waters are always carving new channels.

196
0:09:02.309,000 --> 0:09:04,000
with changes and tides and the weather,

197
0:09:04.6,000 --> 0:09:08,000
some things dry up, new things are created.

198
0:09:09.024,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Of course the water that flows through the waterfall

199
0:09:12.511,000 --> 0:09:14,000
is different every single instance.

200
0:09:15.413,000 --> 0:09:17,000
But it doesn't mean that the Iguazu Falls are an illusion.

201
0:09:18.165,000 --> 0:09:19,000
It doesn't mean it's not real.

202
0:09:19.798,000 --> 0:09:22,000
What it means is we have to understand what it is

203
0:09:23.132,000 --> 0:09:25,000
as something which has a history,

204
0:09:25.361,000 --> 0:09:27,000
has certain things that keep it together,

205
0:09:28.003,000 --> 0:09:3,000
but it's a process, it's fluid, it's forever changing.

206
0:09:30.799,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Now that, I think, is a model for understanding ourselves,

207
0:09:34.531,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and I think it's a liberating model.

208
0:09:36.195,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Because if you think that you have this fixed, permanent essence,

209
0:09:39.231,000 --> 0:09:42,000
which is always the same, throughout your life, no matter what,

210
0:09:42.237,000 --> 0:09:44,000
in a sense you're kind of trapped.

211
0:09:44.807,000 --> 0:09:46,000
You're born with an essence,

212
0:09:47.418,000 --> 0:09:49,000
that's what you are until you die,

213
0:09:50.101,000 --> 0:09:53,000
if you believe in an afterlife, maybe you continue.

214
0:09:53.13,000 --> 0:09:55,000
But if you think of yourself as being, in a way,

215
0:09:56.1,000 --> 0:09:59,000
not a thing as such, but a kind of a process,

216
0:09:59.88,000 --> 0:10:,000
something that is changing,

217
0:10:01.407,000 --> 0:10:02,000
then I think that's quite liberating.

218
0:10:02.944,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Because unlike the the waterfalls,

219
0:10:05.812,000 --> 0:10:07,000
we actually have the capacity to channel

220
0:10:08.307,000 --> 0:10:11,000
the direction of our development for ourselves to a certain degree.

221
0:10:11.929,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Now we've got to be careful here, right?

222
0:10:14.302,000 --> 0:10:17,000
If you watch the X-Factor too much, you might buy into this idea

223
0:10:17.392,000 --> 0:10:19,000
that we can all be whatever we want to be.

224
0:10:19.721,000 --> 0:10:2,000
That's not true.

225
0:10:21.039,000 --> 0:10:23,000
I've heard some fantastic musicians this morning,

226
0:10:23.209,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and I am very confident that I could in no way be as good as them.

227
0:10:26.927,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I could practice hard and maybe be good,

228
0:10:29.324,000 --> 0:10:32,000
but I don't have that really natural ability.

229
0:10:32.328,000 --> 0:10:34,000
There are limits to what we can achieve.

230
0:10:34.985,000 --> 0:10:36,000
There are limits to what we can make of ourselves.

231
0:10:37.46,000 --> 0:10:39,000
But nevertheless, we do have this capacity

232
0:10:40.122,000 --> 0:10:43,000
to, in a sense, shape ourselves.

233
0:10:44.112,000 --> 0:10:46,000
The true self, as it were then,

234
0:10:46.368,000 --> 0:10:5,000
is not something that is just there for you to discover,

235
0:10:50.429,000 --> 0:10:53,000
you don't sort of look into your soul and find your true self,

236
0:10:54.078,000 --> 0:10:55,000
What you are partly doing, at least,

237
0:10:55.899,000 --> 0:10:57,000
is actually creating your true self.

238
0:10:58.29,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And this, I think, is very, very significant,

239
0:11:00.213,000 --> 0:11:01,000
particularly at this stage of life you're at.

240
0:11:02.179,000 --> 0:11:03,000
You'll be aware of the fact

241
0:11:03.578,000 --> 0:11:05,000
how much of you changed over recent years.

242
0:11:06.132,000 --> 0:11:09,000
If you have any videos of yourself, three or four years ago,

243
0:11:09.371,000 --> 0:11:12,000
you probably feel embarrassed because you don't recognize yourself.

244
0:11:12.651,000 --> 0:11:14,000
So I want to get that message over, that what we need to do

245
0:11:15.532,000 --> 0:11:18,000
is think about ourselves as things that we can shape,

246
0:11:18.592,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and channel and change.

247
0:11:19.645,000 --> 0:11:2,000
This is the Buddha, again:

248
0:11:20.941,000 --> 0:11:22,000
"Well-makers lead the water,

249
0:11:23.36,000 --> 0:11:24,000
fletchers bend the arrow,

250
0:11:24.761,000 --> 0:11:26,000
carpenters bend a log of wood,

251
0:11:27.226,000 --> 0:11:3,000
wise people fashion themselves."

252
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And that's the idea I want to leave you with,

253
0:11:32.461,000 --> 0:11:39,000
that your true self is not something that you will have to go searching for,

254
0:11:39.668,000 --> 0:11:42,000
as a mystery, and maybe never ever find.

255
0:11:42.873,000 --> 0:11:43,000
To the extent you have a true self,

256
0:11:44.574,000 --> 0:11:46,000
it's something that you in part discover,

257
0:11:47.308,000 --> 0:11:49,000
but in part create.

258
0:11:49.701,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and that, I think, is a liberating and exciting prospect.

259
0:11:54.197,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Thank you very much.

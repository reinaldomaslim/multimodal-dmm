1
0:00:12.999,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Over a million people are killed each year in disasters.

2
0:00:17.999,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Two and a half million people will be permanently disabled or displaced,

3
0:00:23.257,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and the communities will take 20 to 30 years to recover

4
0:00:27.205,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and billions of economic losses.

5
0:00:31.054,000 --> 0:00:35,000
If you can reduce the initial response by one day,

6
0:00:35.449,000 --> 0:00:38,000
you can reduce the overall recovery

7
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:41,000
by a thousand days, or three years.

8
0:00:41.832,000 --> 0:00:42,000
See how that works?

9
0:00:43.609,000 --> 0:00:45,000
If the initial responders can get in, save lives,

10
0:00:46.483,000 --> 0:00:48,000
mitigate whatever flooding danger there is,

11
0:00:49.023,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that means the other groups can get in

12
0:00:51.331,000 --> 0:00:53,000
to restore the water, the roads, the electricity,

13
0:00:54.34,000 --> 0:00:57,000
which means then the construction people, the insurance agents,

14
0:00:57.48,000 --> 0:00:59,000
all of them can get in to rebuild the houses,

15
0:01:00.118,000 --> 0:01:02,000
which then means you can restore the economy,

16
0:01:03.13,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and maybe even make it better and more resilient to the next disaster.

17
0:01:09.899,000 --> 0:01:1,000
A major insurance company told me

18
0:01:11.719,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that if they can get a homeowner's claim processed one day earlier,

19
0:01:16.855,000 --> 0:01:18,000
it'll make a difference of six months

20
0:01:18.999,000 --> 0:01:2,000
in that person getting their home repaired.

21
0:01:22.118,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And that's why I do disaster robotics --

22
0:01:24.471,000 --> 0:01:28,000
because robots can make a disaster go away faster.

23
0:01:30.305,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Now, you've already seen a couple of these.

24
0:01:32.346,000 --> 0:01:33,000
These are the UAVs.

25
0:01:34.09,000 --> 0:01:35,000
These are two types of UAVs:

26
0:01:35.975,000 --> 0:01:36,000
a rotorcraft, or hummingbird;

27
0:01:37.864,000 --> 0:01:39,000
a fixed-wing, a hawk.

28
0:01:39.958,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And they're used extensively since 2005 --

29
0:01:43.372,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Hurricane Katrina.

30
0:01:44.571,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Let me show you how this hummingbird, this rotorcraft, works.

31
0:01:47.919,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Fantastic for structural engineers.

32
0:01:50.999,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Being able to see damage from angles you can't get from binoculars on the ground

33
0:01:55.443,000 --> 0:01:56,000
or from a satellite image,

34
0:01:56.777,000 --> 0:01:59,000
or anything flying at a higher angle.

35
0:02:00.53,000 --> 0:02:04,000
But it's not just structural engineers and insurance people who need this.

36
0:02:04.926,000 --> 0:02:06,000
You've got things like this fixed-wing, this hawk.

37
0:02:07.417,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Now, this hawk can be used for geospatial surveys.

38
0:02:10.712,000 --> 0:02:12,000
That's where you're pulling imagery together

39
0:02:13.585,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and getting 3D reconstruction.

40
0:02:15.434,000 --> 0:02:19,000
We used both of these at the Oso mudslides up in Washington State,

41
0:02:19.532,000 --> 0:02:21,000
because the big problem

42
0:02:21.755,000 --> 0:02:24,000
was geospatial and hydrological understanding of the disaster --

43
0:02:24.937,000 --> 0:02:25,000
not the search and rescue.

44
0:02:26.207,000 --> 0:02:28,000
The search and rescue teams had it under control

45
0:02:28.55,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and knew what they were doing.

46
0:02:30.052,000 --> 0:02:33,000
The bigger problem was that river and mudslide might wipe them out

47
0:02:33.946,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and flood the responders.

48
0:02:35.464,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And not only was it challenging to the responders and property damage,

49
0:02:39.23,000 --> 0:02:42,000
it's also putting at risk the future of salmon fishing

50
0:02:42.533,000 --> 0:02:43,000
along that part of Washington State.

51
0:02:44.273,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So they needed to understand what was going on.

52
0:02:46.773,000 --> 0:02:48,000
In seven hours, going from Arlington,

53
0:02:49.406,000 --> 0:02:53,000
driving from the Incident Command Post to the site, flying the UAVs,

54
0:02:54.244,000 --> 0:02:57,000
processing the data, driving back to Arlington command post --

55
0:02:57.999,000 --> 0:02:58,000
seven hours.

56
0:02:59.429,000 --> 0:03:02,000
We gave them in seven hours data that they could take

57
0:03:02.987,000 --> 0:03:05,000
only two to three days to get any other way --

58
0:03:06.761,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and at higher resolution.

59
0:03:09.064,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It's a game changer.

60
0:03:11.773,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And don't just think about the UAVs.

61
0:03:13.866,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I mean, they are sexy -- but remember,

62
0:03:16.518,000 --> 0:03:19,000
80 percent of the world's population lives by water,

63
0:03:19.878,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and that means our critical infrastructure is underwater --

64
0:03:22.766,000 --> 0:03:25,000
the parts that we can't get to, like the bridges and things like that.

65
0:03:26.076,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And that's why we have unmanned marine vehicles,

66
0:03:28.692,000 --> 0:03:32,000
one type of which you've already met, which is SARbot, a square dolphin.

67
0:03:33.168,000 --> 0:03:35,000
It goes underwater and uses sonar.

68
0:03:35.888,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Well, why are marine vehicles so important

69
0:03:38.245,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and why are they very, very important?

70
0:03:41.393,000 --> 0:03:42,000
They get overlooked.

71
0:03:42.933,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Think about the Japanese tsunami --

72
0:03:45.359,000 --> 0:03:48,000
400 miles of coastland totally devastated,

73
0:03:49.349,000 --> 0:03:53,000
twice the amount of coastland devastated by Hurricane Katrina in the United States.

74
0:03:54.069,000 --> 0:03:57,000
You're talking about your bridges, your pipelines, your ports -- wiped out.

75
0:03:57.949,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And if you don't have a port,

76
0:03:59.585,000 --> 0:04:02,000
you don't have a way to get in enough relief supplies

77
0:04:02.855,000 --> 0:04:03,000
to support a population.

78
0:04:04.1,000 --> 0:04:06,000
That was a huge problem at the Haiti earthquake.

79
0:04:07.565,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So we need marine vehicles.

80
0:04:09.711,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Now, let's look at a viewpoint from the SARbot

81
0:04:12.166,000 --> 0:04:13,000
of what they were seeing.

82
0:04:13.661,000 --> 0:04:15,000
We were working on a fishing port.

83
0:04:15.931,000 --> 0:04:2,000
We were able to reopen that fishing port, using her sonar, in four hours.

84
0:04:21.671,000 --> 0:04:23,000
That fishing port was told it was going to be six months

85
0:04:24.348,000 --> 0:04:26,000
before they could get a manual team of divers in,

86
0:04:27.078,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and it was going to take the divers two weeks.

87
0:04:29.789,000 --> 0:04:31,000
They were going to miss the fall fishing season,

88
0:04:32.107,000 --> 0:04:36,000
which was the major economy for that part, which is kind of like their Cape Cod.

89
0:04:36.357,000 --> 0:04:38,000
UMVs, very important.

90
0:04:38.649,000 --> 0:04:41,000
But you know, all the robots I've shown you have been small,

91
0:04:41.921,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and that's because robots don't do things that people do.

92
0:04:45.722,000 --> 0:04:47,000
They go places people can't go.

93
0:04:47.999,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And a great example of that is Bujold.

94
0:04:50.999,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Unmanned ground vehicles are particularly small,

95
0:04:53.999,000 --> 0:04:54,000
so Bujold --

96
0:04:55.341,000 --> 0:04:56,000
(Laughter)

97
0:04:56.873,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Say hello to Bujold.

98
0:04:58.08,000 --> 0:05:,000
(Laughter)

99
0:05:01.606,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Bujold was used extensively at the World Trade Center

100
0:05:04.999,000 --> 0:05:06,000
to go through Towers 1, 2 and 4.

101
0:05:07.403,000 --> 0:05:11,000
You're climbing into the rubble, rappelling down, going deep in spaces.

102
0:05:12.072,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And just to see the World Trade Center from Bujold's viewpoint, look at this.

103
0:05:16.655,000 --> 0:05:21,000
You're talking about a disaster where you can't fit a person or a dog --

104
0:05:21.748,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and it's on fire.

105
0:05:23.914,000 --> 0:05:26,000
The only hope of getting to a survivor way in the basement,

106
0:05:27.672,000 --> 0:05:29,000
you have to go through things that are on fire.

107
0:05:29.891,000 --> 0:05:33,000
It was so hot, on one of the robots, the tracks began to melt and come off.

108
0:05:35.161,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Robots don't replace people or dogs,

109
0:05:37.973,000 --> 0:05:39,000
or hummingbirds or hawks or dolphins.

110
0:05:40.518,000 --> 0:05:42,000
They do things new.

111
0:05:42.578,000 --> 0:05:47,000
They assist the responders, the experts, in new and innovative ways.

112
0:05:48.291,000 --> 0:05:52,000
The biggest problem is not making the robots smaller, though.

113
0:05:52.744,000 --> 0:05:54,000
It's not making them more heat-resistant.

114
0:05:54.999,000 --> 0:05:55,000
It's not making more sensors.

115
0:05:56.78,000 --> 0:05:59,000
The biggest problem is the data, the informatics,

116
0:06:00.414,000 --> 0:06:04,000
because these people need to get the right data at the right time.

117
0:06:04.474,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So wouldn't it be great if we could have experts immediately access the robots

118
0:06:09.999,000 --> 0:06:11,000
without having to waste any time of driving to the site,

119
0:06:12.999,000 --> 0:06:14,000
so whoever's there, use their robots over the Internet.

120
0:06:15.956,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Well, let's think about that.

121
0:06:17.362,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Let's think about a chemical train derailment in a rural county.

122
0:06:20.758,000 --> 0:06:23,000
What are the odds that the experts, your chemical engineer,

123
0:06:24.624,000 --> 0:06:25,000
your railroad transportation engineers,

124
0:06:26.51,000 --> 0:06:3,000
have been trained on whatever UAV that particular county happens to have?

125
0:06:31.395,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Probably, like, none.

126
0:06:32.952,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So we're using these kinds of interfaces

127
0:06:35.366,000 --> 0:06:39,000
to allow people to use the robots without knowing what robot they're using,

128
0:06:39.73,000 --> 0:06:41,000
or even if they're using a robot or not.

129
0:06:44.252,000 --> 0:06:5,000
What the robots give you, what they give the experts, is data.

130
0:06:50.31,000 --> 0:06:53,000
The problem becomes: who gets what data when?

131
0:06:53.914,000 --> 0:06:56,000
One thing to do is to ship all the information to everybody

132
0:06:57.831,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and let them sort it out.

133
0:06:59.367,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Well, the problem with that is it overwhelms the networks,

134
0:07:03.247,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and worse yet, it overwhelms the cognitive abilities

135
0:07:06.957,000 --> 0:07:1,000
of each of the people trying to get that one nugget of information

136
0:07:11.49,000 --> 0:07:14,000
they need to make the decision that's going to make the difference.

137
0:07:15.999,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So we need to think about those kinds of challenges.

138
0:07:19.117,000 --> 0:07:2,000
So it's the data.

139
0:07:20.406,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Going back to the World Trade Center,

140
0:07:22.666,000 --> 0:07:26,000
we tried to solve that problem by just recording the data from Bujold

141
0:07:26.999,000 --> 0:07:27,000
only when she was deep in the rubble,

142
0:07:28.999,000 --> 0:07:3,000
because that's what the USAR team said they wanted.

143
0:07:32.523,000 --> 0:07:34,000
What we didn't know at the time

144
0:07:35.135,000 --> 0:07:37,000
was that the civil engineers would have loved,

145
0:07:37.757,000 --> 0:07:41,000
needed the data as we recorded the box beams, the serial numbers,

146
0:07:41.999,000 --> 0:07:43,000
the locations, as we went into the rubble.

147
0:07:45.343,000 --> 0:07:46,000
We lost valuable data.

148
0:07:46.834,000 --> 0:07:48,000
So the challenge is getting all the data

149
0:07:49.237,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and getting it to the right people.

150
0:07:51.441,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Now, here's another reason.

151
0:07:53.542,000 --> 0:07:55,000
We've learned that some buildings --

152
0:07:55.877,000 --> 0:07:58,000
things like schools, hospitals, city halls --

153
0:07:59.173,000 --> 0:08:03,000
get inspected four times by different agencies

154
0:08:03.216,000 --> 0:08:05,000
throughout the response phases.

155
0:08:06.156,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Now, we're looking, if we can get the data from the robots to share,

156
0:08:09.449,000 --> 0:08:13,000
not only can we do things like compress that sequence of phases

157
0:08:14.323,000 --> 0:08:15,000
to shorten the response time,

158
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
but now we can begin to do the response in parallel.

159
0:08:20.382,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Everybody can see the data.

160
0:08:21.785,000 --> 0:08:22,000
We can shorten it that way.

161
0:08:23.999,000 --> 0:08:26,000
So really, "disaster robotics" is a misnomer.

162
0:08:28.227,000 --> 0:08:29,000
It's not about the robots.

163
0:08:30.146,000 --> 0:08:31,000
It's about the data.

164
0:08:32.433,000 --> 0:08:35,000
(Applause)

165
0:08:35.787,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So my challenge to you:

166
0:08:37.768,000 --> 0:08:39,000
the next time you hear about a disaster,

167
0:08:40.092,000 --> 0:08:41,000
look for the robots.

168
0:08:41.441,000 --> 0:08:44,000
They may be underground, they may be underwater,

169
0:08:44.59,000 --> 0:08:45,000
they may be in the sky,

170
0:08:46.308,000 --> 0:08:47,000
but they should be there.

171
0:08:48.297,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Look for the robots,

172
0:08:49.488,000 --> 0:08:51,000
because robots are coming to the rescue.

173
0:08:52.259,000 --> 0:08:57,000
(Applause)

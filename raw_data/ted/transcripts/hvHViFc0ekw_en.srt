1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
This is the exact moment

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
that I started creating something called Tinkering School.

3
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Tinkering School is a place where kids can pick up sticks

4
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and hammers and other dangerous objects,

5
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and be trusted.

6
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Trusted not to hurt themselves,

7
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and trusted not to hurt others.

8
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Tinkering School doesn't follow a set curriculum,

9
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and there are no tests.

10
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
We're not trying to teach anybody any specific thing.

11
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
When the kids arrive

12
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
they're confronted with lots of stuff:

13
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
wood and nails and rope and wheels,

14
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
and lots of tools, real tools.

15
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
It's a six-day immersive experience for the kids.

16
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And within that context, we can offer the kids time --

17
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
something that seems in short supply

18
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
in their over-scheduled lives.

19
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Our goal is to ensure that they leave

20
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
with a better sense of how to make things

21
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
than when they arrived,

22
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and the deep internal realization

23
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
that you can figure things out by fooling around.

24
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Nothing ever turns out as planned ... ever.

25
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And the kids soon learn

27
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that all projects go awry --

28
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and become at ease with the idea that every step

30
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
in a project is a step closer

31
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
to sweet success,

32
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
or gleeful calamity.

33
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
We start from doodles and sketches.

34
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And sometimes we make real plans.

35
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And sometimes we just start building.

36
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Building is at the heart of the experience:

37
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
hands on, deeply immersed

38
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and fully committed to the problem at hand.

39
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Robin and I, acting as collaborators,

40
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
keep the landscape of the projects

41
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
tilted towards completion.

42
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Success is in the doing,

43
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and failures are celebrated and analyzed.

44
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Problems become puzzles

45
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and obstacles disappear.

46
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
When faced with particularly difficult

47
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
setbacks or complexities,

48
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
a really interesting behavior emerges: decoration.

49
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Decoration of the unfinished project

51
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
is a kind of conceptual incubation.

52
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
From these interludes come deep insights

53
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and amazing new approaches to solving the problems

54
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that had them frustrated just moments before.

55
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
All materials are available for use.

56
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Even those mundane, hateful, plastic grocery bags

57
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
can become a bridge

58
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
stronger than anyone imagined.

59
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And the things that they build

60
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
amaze even themselves.

61
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Video: Three, two, one, go!

62
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Gever Tulley: A rollercoaster built by seven-year-olds.

63
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Video: Yay!

64
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
(Applause)

65
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
GT: Thank you. It's been a great pleasure.

66
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000

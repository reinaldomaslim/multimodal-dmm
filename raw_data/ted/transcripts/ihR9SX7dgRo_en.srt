1
0:00:12.949,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm thrilled to be here tonight

2
0:00:14.773,000 --> 0:00:16,000
to share with you something we've been working on

3
0:00:17.152,000 --> 0:00:19,000
for over two years,

4
0:00:19.242,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and it's in the area of additive manufacturing,

5
0:00:21.796,000 --> 0:00:23,000
also known as 3D printing.

6
0:00:24.513,000 --> 0:00:25,000
You see this object here.

7
0:00:26.231,000 --> 0:00:29,000
It looks fairly simple, but it's quite complex at the same time.

8
0:00:30.549,000 --> 0:00:33,000
It's a set of concentric geodesic structures

9
0:00:33.8,000 --> 0:00:35,000
with linkages between each one.

10
0:00:36.795,000 --> 0:00:42,000
In its context, it is not manufacturable by traditional manufacturing techniques.

11
0:00:43.343,000 --> 0:00:46,000
It has a symmetry such that you can't injection mold it.

12
0:00:47.29,000 --> 0:00:5,000
You can't even manufacture it through milling.

13
0:00:51.47,000 --> 0:00:53,000
This is a job for a 3D printer,

14
0:00:54.117,000 --> 0:00:58,000
but most 3D printers would take between three and 10 hours to fabricate it,

15
0:00:58.598,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and we're going to take the risk tonight to try to fabricate it onstage

16
0:01:02.824,000 --> 0:01:04,000
during this 10-minute talk.

17
0:01:05.401,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Wish us luck.

18
0:01:08.35,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Now, 3D printing is actually a misnomer.

19
0:01:11.624,000 --> 0:01:14,000
It's actually 2D printing over and over again,

20
0:01:15.919,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and it in fact uses the technologies associated with 2D printing.

21
0:01:20.401,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Think about inkjet printing where you lay down ink on a page to make letters,

22
0:01:25.36,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and then do that over and over again to build up a three-dimensional object.

23
0:01:30.346,000 --> 0:01:32,000
In microelectronics, they use something

24
0:01:32.417,000 --> 0:01:34,000
called lithography to do the same sort of thing,

25
0:01:34.737,000 --> 0:01:36,000
to make the transistors and integrated circuits

26
0:01:36.945,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and build up a structure several times.

27
0:01:38.997,000 --> 0:01:4,000
These are all 2D printing technologies.

28
0:01:42.099,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Now, I'm a chemist, a material scientist too,

29
0:01:45.987,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and my co-inventors are also material scientists,

30
0:01:48.711,000 --> 0:01:5,000
one a chemist, one a physicist,

31
0:01:51.01,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and we began to be interested in 3D printing.

32
0:01:53.936,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And very often, as you know, new ideas are often simple connections

33
0:01:59.531,000 --> 0:02:02,000
between people with different experiences in different communities,

34
0:02:03.274,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and that's our story.

35
0:02:05.591,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Now, we were inspired

36
0:02:08.122,000 --> 0:02:12,000
by the "Terminator 2" scene for T-1000,

37
0:02:12.893,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and we thought, why couldn't a 3D printer operate in this fashion,

38
0:02:18.426,000 --> 0:02:21,000
where you have an object arise out of a puddle

39
0:02:23.052,000 --> 0:02:25,000
in essentially real time

40
0:02:25.52,000 --> 0:02:27,000
with essentially no waste

41
0:02:27.749,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to make a great object?

42
0:02:30.071,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Okay, just like the movies.

43
0:02:31.488,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And could we be inspired by Hollywood

44
0:02:34.877,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and come up with ways to actually try to get this to work?

45
0:02:38.384,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And that was our challenge.

46
0:02:40.45,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And our approach would be, if we could do this,

47
0:02:43.817,000 --> 0:02:46,000
then we could fundamentally address the three issues holding back 3D printing

48
0:02:47.671,000 --> 0:02:49,000
from being a manufacturing process.

49
0:02:50.086,000 --> 0:02:52,000
One, 3D printing takes forever.

50
0:02:52.617,000 --> 0:02:57,000
There are mushrooms that grow faster than 3D printed parts. (Laughter)

51
0:02:59.281,000 --> 0:03:01,000
The layer by layer process

52
0:03:01.417,000 --> 0:03:03,000
leads to defects in mechanical properties,

53
0:03:04.319,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and if we could grow continuously, we could eliminate those defects.

54
0:03:08.266,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And in fact, if we could grow really fast, we could also start using materials

55
0:03:13.398,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that are self-curing, and we could have amazing properties.

56
0:03:18.042,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So if we could pull this off, imitate Hollywood,

57
0:03:22.151,000 --> 0:03:24,000
we could in fact address 3D manufacturing.

58
0:03:26.702,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Our approach is to use some standard knowledge

59
0:03:29.953,000 --> 0:03:31,000
in polymer chemistry

60
0:03:32.553,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to harness light and oxygen to grow parts continuously.

61
0:03:39.152,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Light and oxygen work in different ways.

62
0:03:42.099,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Light can take a resin and convert it to a solid,

63
0:03:45.141,000 --> 0:03:47,000
can convert a liquid to a solid.

64
0:03:47.295,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Oxygen inhibits that process.

65
0:03:50.829,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So light and oxygen are polar opposites from one another

66
0:03:54.08,000 --> 0:03:56,000
from a chemical point of view,

67
0:03:56.588,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and if we can control spatially the light and oxygen,

68
0:04:00.001,000 --> 0:04:01,000
we could control this process.

69
0:04:02.288,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And we refer to this as CLIP. [Continuous Liquid Interface Production.]

70
0:04:05.739,000 --> 0:04:06,000
It has three functional components.

71
0:04:08.465,000 --> 0:04:11,000
One, it has a reservoir that holds the puddle,

72
0:04:12.326,000 --> 0:04:13,000
just like the T-1000.

73
0:04:14.205,000 --> 0:04:16,000
At the bottom of the reservoir is a special window.

74
0:04:16.621,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I'll come back to that.

75
0:04:18.112,000 --> 0:04:21,000
In addition, it has a stage that will lower into the puddle

76
0:04:21.892,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and pull the object out of the liquid.

77
0:04:24.481,000 --> 0:04:27,000
The third component is a digital light projection system

78
0:04:28.285,000 --> 0:04:3,000
underneath the reservoir,

79
0:04:30.305,000 --> 0:04:33,000
illuminating with light in the ultraviolet region.

80
0:04:34.048,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Now, the key is that this window in the bottom of this reservoir,

81
0:04:37.271,000 --> 0:04:39,000
it's a composite, it's a very special window.

82
0:04:40.15,000 --> 0:04:43,000
It's not only transparent to light but it's permeable to oxygen.

83
0:04:43.796,000 --> 0:04:45,000
It's got characteristics like a contact lens.

84
0:04:47.435,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So we can see how the process works.

85
0:04:49.716,000 --> 0:04:52,000
You can start to see that as you lower a stage in there,

86
0:04:53.13,000 --> 0:04:57,000
in a traditional process, with an oxygen-impermeable window,

87
0:04:57.309,000 --> 0:04:58,000
you make a two-dimensional pattern

88
0:05:00.008,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and you end up gluing that onto the window with a traditional window,

89
0:05:03.37,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and so in order to introduce the next layer, you have to separate it,

90
0:05:06.922,000 --> 0:05:09,000
introduce new resin, reposition it,

91
0:05:10.451,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and do this process over and over again.

92
0:05:13.4,000 --> 0:05:14,000
But with our very special window,

93
0:05:15.234,000 --> 0:05:18,000
what we're able to do is, with oxygen coming through the bottom

94
0:05:18.563,000 --> 0:05:19,000
as light hits it,

95
0:05:21.256,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that oxygen inhibits the reaction,

96
0:05:23.926,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and we form a dead zone.

97
0:05:26.55,000 --> 0:05:3,000
This dead zone is on the order of tens of microns thick,

98
0:05:30.869,000 --> 0:05:33,000
so that's two or three diameters of a red blood cell,

99
0:05:34.096,000 --> 0:05:36,000
right at the window interface that remains a liquid,

100
0:05:36.627,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and we pull this object up,

101
0:05:38.577,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and as we talked about in a Science paper,

102
0:05:40.969,000 --> 0:05:44,000
as we change the oxygen content, we can change the dead zone thickness.

103
0:05:45.682,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And so we have a number of key variables that we control: oxygen content,

104
0:05:49.374,000 --> 0:05:52,000
the light, the light intensity, the dose to cure,

105
0:05:52.439,000 --> 0:05:53,000
the viscosity, the geometry,

106
0:05:54.401,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and we use very sophisticated software to control this process.

107
0:05:58.697,000 --> 0:06:,000
The result is pretty staggering.

108
0:06:01.46,000 --> 0:06:04,000
It's 25 to 100 times faster than traditional 3D printers,

109
0:06:06.336,000 --> 0:06:07,000
which is game-changing.

110
0:06:08.17,000 --> 0:06:12,000
In addition, as our ability to deliver liquid to that interface,

111
0:06:12.506,000 --> 0:06:15,000
we can go 1,000 times faster I believe,

112
0:06:16.246,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and that in fact opens up the opportunity for generating a lot of heat,

113
0:06:19.803,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and as a chemical engineer, I get very excited at heat transfer

114
0:06:23.866,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and the idea that we might one day have water-cooled 3D printers,

115
0:06:28.045,000 --> 0:06:3,000
because they're going so fast.

116
0:06:30.437,000 --> 0:06:34,000
In addition, because we're growing things, we eliminate the layers,

117
0:06:34.5,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and the parts are monolithic.

118
0:06:36.474,000 --> 0:06:38,000
You don't see the surface structure.

119
0:06:38.564,000 --> 0:06:4,000
You have molecularly smooth surfaces.

120
0:06:41.057,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And the mechanical properties of most parts made in a 3D printer

121
0:06:45.297,000 --> 0:06:49,000
are notorious for having properties that depend on the orientation

122
0:06:49.593,000 --> 0:06:52,000
with which how you printed it, because of the layer-like structure.

123
0:06:53.354,000 --> 0:06:55,000
But when you grow objects like this,

124
0:06:55.699,000 --> 0:06:58,000
the properties are invariant with the print direction.

125
0:06:59.368,000 --> 0:07:01,000
These look like injection-molded parts,

126
0:07:02.317,000 --> 0:07:05,000
which is very different than traditional 3D manufacturing.

127
0:07:05.729,000 --> 0:07:08,000
In addition, we're able to throw

128
0:07:09.259,000 --> 0:07:12,000
the entire polymer chemistry textbook at this,

129
0:07:12.835,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and we're able to design chemistries that can give rise to the properties

130
0:07:16.826,000 --> 0:07:19,000
you really want in a 3D-printed object.

131
0:07:19.868,000 --> 0:07:2,000
(Applause)

132
0:07:21.205,000 --> 0:07:24,000
There it is. That's great.

133
0:07:26.049,000 --> 0:07:29,000
You always take the risk that something like this won't work onstage, right?

134
0:07:30.177,000 --> 0:07:32,000
But we can have materials with great mechanical properties.

135
0:07:33.056,000 --> 0:07:35,000
For the first time, we can have elastomers

136
0:07:35.494,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that are high elasticity or high dampening.

137
0:07:37.955,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Think about vibration control or great sneakers, for example.

138
0:07:41.368,000 --> 0:07:43,000
We can make materials that have incredible strength,

139
0:07:44.828,000 --> 0:07:47,000
high strength-to-weight ratio, really strong materials,

140
0:07:48.404,000 --> 0:07:5,000
really great elastomers,

141
0:07:50.517,000 --> 0:07:52,000
so throw that in the audience there.

142
0:07:53.242,000 --> 0:07:55,000
So great material properties.

143
0:07:55.878,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And so the opportunity now, if you actually make a part

144
0:07:59.293,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that has the properties to be a final part,

145
0:08:02.973,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and you do it in game-changing speeds,

146
0:08:06.073,000 --> 0:08:08,000
you can actually transform manufacturing.

147
0:08:08.86,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Right now, in manufacturing, what happens is,

148
0:08:11.716,000 --> 0:08:13,000
the so-called digital thread in digital manufacturing.

149
0:08:14.678,000 --> 0:08:19,000
We go from a CAD drawing, a design, to a prototype to manufacturing.

150
0:08:19.717,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Often, the digital thread is broken right at prototype,

151
0:08:22.44,000 --> 0:08:24,000
because you can't go all the way to manufacturing

152
0:08:24.872,000 --> 0:08:27,000
because most parts don't have the properties to be a final part.

153
0:08:28.587,000 --> 0:08:3,000
We now can connect the digital thread

154
0:08:30.978,000 --> 0:08:34,000
all the way from design to prototyping to manufacturing,

155
0:08:35.227,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and that opportunity really opens up all sorts of things,

156
0:08:38.176,000 --> 0:08:42,000
from better fuel-efficient cars dealing with great lattice properties

157
0:08:43.129,000 --> 0:08:44,000
with high strength-to-weight ratio,

158
0:08:45.08,000 --> 0:08:48,000
new turbine blades, all sorts of wonderful things.

159
0:08:49.468,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Think about if you need a stent in an emergency situation,

160
0:08:54.623,000 --> 0:08:57,000
instead of the doctor pulling off a stent out of the shelf

161
0:08:58.593,000 --> 0:09:,000
that was just standard sizes,

162
0:09:00.822,000 --> 0:09:04,000
having a stent that's designed for you, for your own anatomy

163
0:09:04.978,000 --> 0:09:05,000
with your own tributaries,

164
0:09:06.789,000 --> 0:09:09,000
printed in an emergency situation in real time out of the properties

165
0:09:10.038,000 --> 0:09:13,000
such that the stent could go away after 18 months: really-game changing.

166
0:09:13.477,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Or digital dentistry, and making these kinds of structures

167
0:09:17.633,000 --> 0:09:2,000
even while you're in the dentist chair.

168
0:09:20.814,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And look at the structures that my students are making

169
0:09:23.53,000 --> 0:09:24,000
at the University of North Carolina.

170
0:09:25.504,000 --> 0:09:27,000
These are amazing microscale structures.

171
0:09:28.313,000 --> 0:09:3,000
You know, the world is really good at nano-fabrication.

172
0:09:31.309,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Moore's Law has driven things from 10 microns and below.

173
0:09:35.599,000 --> 0:09:36,000
We're really good at that,

174
0:09:37.201,000 --> 0:09:41,000
but it's actually very hard to make things from 10 microns to 1,000 microns,

175
0:09:41.241,000 --> 0:09:43,000
the mesoscale.

176
0:09:43.261,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And subtractive techniques from the silicon industry

177
0:09:46.094,000 --> 0:09:47,000
can't do that very well.

178
0:09:47.51,000 --> 0:09:48,000
They can't etch wafers that well.

179
0:09:49.159,000 --> 0:09:5,000
But this process is so gentle,

180
0:09:51.109,000 --> 0:09:53,000
we can grow these objects up from the bottom

181
0:09:53.594,000 --> 0:09:54,000
using additive manufacturing

182
0:09:55.59,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and make amazing things in tens of seconds,

183
0:09:57.843,000 --> 0:09:59,000
opening up new sensor technologies,

184
0:09:59.932,000 --> 0:10:01,000
new drug delivery techniques,

185
0:10:02.417,000 --> 0:10:05,000
new lab-on-a-chip applications, really game-changing stuff.

186
0:10:07.149,000 --> 0:10:11,000
So the opportunity of making a part in real time

187
0:10:11.983,000 --> 0:10:13,000
that has the properties to be a final part

188
0:10:14.816,000 --> 0:10:16,000
really opens up 3D manufacturing,

189
0:10:17.792,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and for us, this is very exciting, because this really is owning

190
0:10:20.992,000 --> 0:10:26,000
the intersection between hardware, software and molecular science,

191
0:10:27.589,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and I can't wait to see what designers and engineers around the world

192
0:10:31.755,000 --> 0:10:33,000
are going to be able to do with this great tool.

193
0:10:34.499,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Thanks for listening.

194
0:10:36.618,000 --> 0:10:41,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.33,000 --> 0:00:18,000
My name is Arvind Gupta, and I'm a toymaker.

2
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I've been making toys for the last 30 years.

3
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
The early '70s, I was in college.

4
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
It was a very revolutionary time.

5
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
It was a political ferment, so to say --

6
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
students out in the streets of Paris,

7
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
revolting against authority.

8
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
America was jolted

9
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
by the anti-Vietnam movement, the Civil Rights movement.

10
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
In India, we had the Naxalite movement,

11
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
the [unclear] movement.

12
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
But you know, when there is a political churning of society,

13
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
it unleashes a lot of energy.

14
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
The National Movement of India

15
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
was testimony to that.

16
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Lots of people resigned from well-paid jobs

17
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and jumped into the National Movement.

18
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Now in the early '70s,

19
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
one of the great programs in India

20
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
was to revitalize

21
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
primary science in village schools.

22
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
There was a person, Anil Sadgopal, did a Ph.D. from Caltech

23
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and returned back as a molecular biologist

24
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
in India's cutting-edge research institute, the TIFR.

25
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
At 31, he was not able

26
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
to relate the kind of [unclear] research,

27
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
which he was doing with the lives of the ordinary people.

28
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
So he designed and went and started a village science program.

29
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Many people were inspired by this.

30
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
The slogan of the early '70s

31
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
was "Go to the people.

32
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Live with them; love them.

33
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Start from what they know. Build on what they have."

34
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
This was kind of the defining slogan.

35
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Well I took one year.

36
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I joined Telco, made TATA trucks, pretty close to Pune.

37
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I worked there for two years,

38
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and I realized that I was not born to make trucks.

39
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Often one doesn't know what one wants to do,

40
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
but it's good enough to know what you don't want to do.

41
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So I took one year off, and I went to this village science program.

42
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And it was a turning point.

43
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
It was a very small village --

44
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
a weekly bazaar

45
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
where people, just once in a week, they put in all the vats.

46
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So I said, "I'm going to spend a year over here."

47
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So I just bought one specimen

48
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
of everything which was sold on the roadside.

49
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And one thing which I found

50
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
was this black rubber.

51
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
This is called a cycle valve tube.

52
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
When you pump in air in a bicycle, you use a bit of this.

53
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And some of these models --

54
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
so you take a bit of this cycle valve tube,

55
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
you can put two matchsticks inside this, and you make a flexible joint.

56
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
It's a joint of tubes. You start by teaching angles --

57
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
an acute angle, a right angle, an obtuse angle, a straight angle.

58
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
It's like its own little coupling.

59
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
If you have three of them, and you loop them together,

60
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
well you make a triangle.

61
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
With four, you make a square,

62
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
you make a pentagon, you make a hexagon,

63
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
you make all these kind of polygons.

64
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And they have some wonderful properties.

65
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
If you look at the hexagon, for instance,

66
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
it's like an amoeba, which is constantly changing its own profile.

67
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
You can just pull this out, this becomes a rectangle.

68
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
You give it a push, this becomes a parallelogram.

69
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
But this is very shaky.

70
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Look at the pentagon, for instance,

71
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
pull this out -- it becomes a boat shape trapezium.

72
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
Push it and it becomes house shaped.

73
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
This becomes an isosceles triangle --

74
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
again, very shaky.

75
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
This square might look very square and prim.

76
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Give it a little push -- this becomes a rhombus.

77
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It becomes kite-shaped.

78
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
But give a child a triangle,

79
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
he can't do a thing to it.

80
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Why use triangles?

81
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Because triangles are the only rigid structures.

82
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
We can't make a bridge with squares

83
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
because the train would come, it would start doing a jig.

84
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Ordinary people know about this

85
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
because if you go to a village in India,

86
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
they might not have gone to engineering college,

87
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
but no one makes a roof placed like this.

88
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Because if they put tiles on top, it's just going to crash.

89
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
They always make a triangular roof.

90
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Now this is people science.

91
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And if you were to just poke a hole over here

92
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and put a third matchstick,

93
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
you'll get a T joint.

94
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And if I were to poke all the three legs of this

95
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
in the three vertices of this triangle,

96
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I would make a tetrahedron.

97
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So you make all these 3D shapes.

98
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
You make a tetrahedron like this.

99
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And once you make these,

100
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
you make a little house.

101
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Put this on top.

102
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
You can make a joint of four. You can make a joint of six.

103
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
You just need a ton.

104
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Now this was -- you make a joint of six,

105
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
you make an icosahedron.

106
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
You can play around with it.

107
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
This makes an igloo.

108
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Now this is in 1978.

109
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I was a 24-year-old young engineer.

110
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And I thought this was so much better than making trucks.

111
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
(Applause)

112
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
If you, as a matter of fact, put four marbles inside,

113
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
you simulate the molecular structure of methane, CH4.

114
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Four atoms of hydrogen, the four points of the tetrahedron,

115
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
which means the little carbon atom.

116
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Well since then,

117
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I just thought that I've been really privileged

118
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
to go to over 2,000 schools in my country --

119
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
village schools, government schools,

120
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
municipal schools, Ivy League schools --

121
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I've been invited by most of them.

122
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And every time I go to a school,

123
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I see a gleam in the eyes of the children.

124
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I see hope. I see happiness in their faces.

125
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Children want to make things. Children want to do things.

126
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Now this, we make lots and lots of pumps.

127
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Now this is a little pump

128
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
with which you could inflate a balloon.

129
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
It's a real pump. You could actually pop the balloon.

130
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And we have a slogan

131
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
that the best thing a child can do with a toy is to break it.

132
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So all you do is --

133
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
it's a very kind of provocative statement --

134
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
this old bicycle tube and this old plastic [unclear]

135
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
This filling cap will go very snugly into an old bicycle tube.

136
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And this is how you make a valve.

137
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
You put a little sticky tape.

138
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
This is one-way traffic.

139
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Well we make lots and lots of pumps.

140
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And this is the other one --

141
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that you just take a straw, and you just put a stick inside

142
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and you make two half-cuts.

143
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Now this is what you do,

144
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
is you bend both these legs into a triangle,

145
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and you just wrap some tape around.

146
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And this is the pump.

147
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
And now, if you have this pump,

148
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
it's like a great, great sprinkler.

149
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
It's like a centrifuge.

150
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
If you spin something, it tends to fly out.

151
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
(Applause)

152
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Well in terms of -- if you were in Andhra Pradesh,

153
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
you would make this with the palmyra leaf.

154
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Many of our folk toys

155
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
have great science principles.

156
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
If you spin-top something, it tends to fly out.

157
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
If I do it with both hands, you can see this fun Mr. Flying Man.

158
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Right.

159
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
This is a toy which is made from paper. It's amazing.

160
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
There are four pictures.

161
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
You see insects,

162
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
you see frogs, snakes, eagles, butterflies,

163
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
frogs, snakes, eagles.

164
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Here's a paper which you could [unclear] --

165
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
designed by a mathematician at Harvard in 1928,

166
0:06:44.33,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Arthur Stone,

167
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
documented by Martin Gardner in many of his many books.

168
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
But this is great fun for children.

169
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
They all study about the food chain.

170
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
The insects are eaten by the frogs; the frogs are eaten by the snakes;

171
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
the snakes are eaten by the eagles.

172
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And this can be, if you had a whole photocopy paper --

173
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
A4 size paper --

174
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
you could be in a municipal school, you could be in a government school --

175
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:07,000
a paper, a scale and a pencil -- no glue, no scissors.

176
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:1,000
In three minutes, you just fold this up.

177
0:07:10.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And what you could use it for is just limited by your imagination.

178
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
If you take a smaller paper, you make a smaller flexagon.

179
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
With a bigger one, you make a bigger one.

180
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Now this is a pencil with a few slots over here.

181
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And you put a little fan here.

182
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And this is a hundred-year-old toy.

183
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
There have been six major research papers on this.

184
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
There's some grooves over here, you can see.

185
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And if I take a reed -- if I rub this,

186
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
something very amazing happens.

187
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Six major research papers on this.

188
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
As a matter of fact, Feynman, as a child, was very fascinated by this.

189
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
He wrote a paper on this.

190
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And you don't need the three billion-dollar Hadron Collider

191
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
for doing this. (Laughter) (Applause)

192
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
This is there for every child,

193
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and every child can enjoy this.

194
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
If you want to put a colored disk,

195
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
well all these seven colors coalesce.

196
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And this is what Newton talked about 400 years back,

197
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
that white light's made of seven colors,

198
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
just by spinning this around.

199
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
This is a straw.

200
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
What we've done, we've just sealed both the ends with tape,

201
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
nipped the right corner and the bottom left corner,

202
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
so there's holes in the opposite corners, there's a little hole over here.

203
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
This is a kind of a blowing straw.

204
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
I just put this inside this.

205
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
There's a hole here, and I shut this.

206
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And this costs very little money to make --

207
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
great fun for children to do.

208
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
What we do

209
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
is make a very simple electric motor.

210
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Now this is the simplest motor on Earth.

211
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
The most expensive thing is the battery inside this.

212
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
If you have a battery, it costs five cents to make it.

213
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
This is an old bicycle tube,

214
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
which gives you a broad rubber band, two safety pins.

215
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
This is a permanent magnet.

216
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Whenever current flows through the coil, this becomes an electromagnet.

217
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
It's the interaction of both these magnets

218
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
which makes this motor spin.

219
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
We made 30,000.

220
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Teachers who have been teaching science for donkey years,

221
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
they just muck up the definition and they spit it out.

222
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
When teachers make it, children make it.

223
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
You can see a gleam in their eye.

224
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
They get a thrill

225
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
of what science is all about.

226
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And this science is not a rich man's game.

227
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
In a democratic country,

228
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
science must reach to our most oppressed,

229
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
to the most marginalized children.

230
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
This program started with 16 schools

231
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and spread to 1,500 government schools.

232
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Over 100,000 children learn science this way.

233
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And we're just trying to see possibilities.

234
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Look, this is the tetrapak --

235
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
awful materials from the point of view of the environment.

236
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
There are six layers -- three layers of plastic, aluminum --

237
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
which are are sealed together.

238
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
They are fused together, so you can't separate them.

239
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Now you can just make a little network like this

240
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and fold them and stick them together

241
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and make an icosahedron.

242
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
So something which is trash,

243
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:57,000
which is choking all the seabirds,

244
0:09:57.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
you could just recycle this into a very, very joyous --

245
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
all the platonic solids can be made with things like this.

246
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
This is a little straw,

247
0:10:06.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and what you do is you just nip two corners here,

248
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and this becomes like a baby crocodile's mouth.

249
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
You put this in your mouth, and you blow.

250
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
(Honk)

251
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
It's children's delight, a teacher's envy, as they say.

252
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
You're not able to see how the sound is produced,

253
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
because the thing which is vibrating goes inside my mouth.

254
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
I'm going to keep this outside, to blow out. I'm going to suck in air.

255
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:32,000
(Honk)

256
0:10:32.33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
So no one actually needs to muck up the production of sound

257
0:10:35.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
with wire vibrations.

258
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
The other is that you keep blowing at it,

259
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
keep making the sound,

260
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and you keep cutting it.

261
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And something very, very nice happens.

262
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
(Honk)

263
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
(Applause)

264
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And when you get a very small one --

265
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
(Honk)

266
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
This is what the kids teach you. You can also do this.

267
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Well before I go any further,

268
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
this is something worth sharing.

269
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
This is a touching slate meant for blind children.

270
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
This is strips of Velcro, this is my drawing slate,

271
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and this is my drawing pen,

272
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
which is basically a film box.

273
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
It's basically like a fisherman's line,

274
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
a fishing line.

275
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And this is wool over here.

276
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:32,000
If I crank the handle, all the wool goes inside.

277
0:11:32.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And what a blind child can do is to just draw this.

278
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Wool sticks on Velcro.

279
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
There are 12 million blind children in our country --

280
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
(Applause)

281
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
who live in a world of darkness.

282
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And this has come as a great boon to them.

283
0:11:50.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
There's a factory out there making our children blind,

284
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
not able to provide them with food,

285
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
not able to provide them with vitamin A.

286
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:11:59,000
But this has come as a great boon for them.

287
0:11:59.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
There are no patents. Anyone can make it.

288
0:12:03.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
This is very, very simple.

289
0:12:05.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
You can see, this is the generator. It's a crank generator.

290
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
These are two magnets.

291
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
This is a large pulley made by sandwiching rubber between two old CDs.

292
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Small pulley and two strong magnets.

293
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And this fiber turns a wire attached to an LED.

294
0:12:18.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
If I spin this pulley, the small one's going to spin much faster.

295
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
There will be a spinning magnetic field.

296
0:12:22.33,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Lines, of course, would be cut, the force will be generated.

297
0:12:25.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And you can see, this LED is going to glow.

298
0:12:27.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
So this is a small crank generator.

299
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Well, this is, again,

300
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
it's just a ring, a steel ring with steel nuts.

301
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And what you can do

302
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:42,000
is just, if you give it a twirl,

303
0:12:42.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
well they just keep going on.

304
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And imagine a bunch of kids

305
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:52,000
standing in a circle

306
0:12:52.33,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and just waiting for the steel ring to be passed on.

307
0:12:54.33,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And they'd be absolutely joyous playing with this.

308
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Well in the end, what we can also do:

309
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:04,000
we use a lot of old newspapers

310
0:13:04.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
to make caps.

311
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:08,000
This is worthy of Sachin Tendulkar.

312
0:13:08.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
It's a great cricket cap. (Laughter) (Applause)

313
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
When first you see Nehru and Gandhi,

314
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:16,000
this is the Nehru cap -- just half a newspaper.

315
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
We make lots of toys with newspapers,

316
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and this is one of them.

317
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And this is -- you can see --

318
0:13:22.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
this is a flapping bird.

319
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
All of our old newspapers, we cut them into little squares.

320
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And if you have one of these birds --

321
0:13:30.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
children in Japan have been making this bird for many, many years.

322
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And you can see,

323
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
this is a little fantail bird.

324
0:13:41.33,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Well in the end, I'll just end with a story.

325
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
This is called "The Captain's Hat Story."

326
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:48,000
The captain was a captain of a sea-going ship.

327
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
It goes very slowly.

328
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And there were lots of passengers on the ship,

329
0:13:52.33,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and they were getting bored, so the captain invited them on the deck.

330
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
"Wear all your colorful clothes and sing and dance,

331
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and I'll provide you with good food and drinks."

332
0:13:58.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
And the captain would wear a cap everyday

333
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and join in the regalia.

334
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
The first day, it was a huge umbrella cap,

335
0:14:04.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
like a captain's cap.

336
0:14:06.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
That night, when the passengers would be sleeping,

337
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
he would give it one more fold,

338
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and the second day, he would be wearing a fireman's cap --

339
0:14:13.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
with a little shoot just like a designer cap,

340
0:14:15.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
because it protects the spinal cord.

341
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And the second night, he would take the same cap

342
0:14:20.33,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and give it another fold.

343
0:14:22.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And the third day, it would be a Shikari cap --

344
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
just like an adventurer's cap.

345
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And the third night, he would give it two more folds --

346
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and this is a very, very famous cap.

347
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
If you've seen any of our Bollywood films,

348
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
this is what the policeman wears,

349
0:14:36.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
it's called a zapalu cap.

350
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:41,000
It's been catapulted to international glory.

351
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And we must not forget that he was the captain of the ship.

352
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:46,000
So that's a ship.

353
0:14:46.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
And now the end:

354
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
everyone was enjoying the journey very much.

355
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:52,000
They were singing and dancing.

356
0:14:52.33,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Suddenly there was a storm and huge waves.

357
0:14:55.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
And all the ship can do is to dance and pitch along with the waves.

358
0:14:58.33,000 --> 0:15:,000
A huge wave comes and slaps the front

359
0:15:00.33,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and knocks it down.

360
0:15:02.33,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And another one comes and slaps the aft and knocks it down.

361
0:15:05.33,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And there's a third one over here.

362
0:15:07.33,000 --> 0:15:09,000
This swallows the bridge and knocks it down.

363
0:15:09.33,000 --> 0:15:11,000
And the ship sinks,

364
0:15:11.33,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and the captain has lost everything,

365
0:15:13.33,000 --> 0:15:16,000
but for a life jacket.

366
0:15:16.33,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Thank you so much.

367
0:15:18.33,000 --> 0:15:24,000
(Applause)

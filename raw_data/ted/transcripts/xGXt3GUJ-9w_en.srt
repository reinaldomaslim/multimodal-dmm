1
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
So I want to talk to you today about AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa.

2
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And this is a pretty well-educated audience,

3
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:34,000
so I imagine you all know something about AIDS.

4
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:36,000
You probably know that roughly 25 million people in Africa

5
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:4,000
are infected with the virus, that AIDS is a disease of poverty,

6
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and that if we can bring Africa out of poverty, we would decrease AIDS as well.

7
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:47,000
If you know something more, you probably know that Uganda, to date,

8
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:49,000
is the only country in sub-Saharan Africa

9
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:52,000
that has had success in combating the epidemic.

10
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Using a campaign that encouraged people to abstain, be faithful, and use condoms --

11
0:00:56,000 --> 0:01:,000
the ABC campaign -- they decreased their prevalence in the 1990s

12
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:04,000
from about 15 percent to 6 percent over just a few years.

13
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:07,000
If you follow policy, you probably know that a few years ago

14
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:11,000
the president pledged 15 billion dollars to fight the epidemic over five years,

15
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and a lot of that money is going to go to programs that try to replicate Uganda

16
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and use behavior change to encourage people and decrease the epidemic.

17
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So today I'm going to talk about some things

18
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that you might not know about the epidemic,

19
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and I'm actually also going to challenge

20
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
some of these things that you think that you do know.

21
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:31,000
To do that I'm going to talk about my research

22
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:33,000
as an economist on the epidemic.

23
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And I'm not really going to talk much about the economy.

24
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I'm not going to tell you about exports and prices.

25
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:42,000
But I'm going to use tools and ideas that are familiar to economists

26
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:44,000
to think about a problem that's more traditionally

27
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:46,000
part of public health and epidemiology.

28
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And I think in that sense, this fits really nicely with this lateral thinking idea.

29
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Here I'm really using the tools of one academic discipline

30
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:55,000
to think about problems of another.

31
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So we think, first and foremost, AIDS is a policy issue.

32
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And probably for most people in this room, that's how you think about it.

33
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:05,000
But this talk is going to be about understanding facts about the epidemic.

34
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:08,000
It's going to be about thinking about how it evolves, and how people respond to it.

35
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I think it may seem like I'm ignoring the policy stuff,

36
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:13,000
which is really the most important,

37
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:15,000
but I'm hoping that at the end of this talk you will conclude

38
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that we actually cannot develop effective policy

39
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:2,000
unless we really understand how the epidemic works.

40
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And the first thing that I want to talk about,

41
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:24,000
the first thing I think we need to understand is:

42
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:26,000
how do people respond to the epidemic?

43
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So AIDS is a sexually transmitted infection, and it kills you.

44
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So this means that in a place with a lot of AIDS,

45
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:34,000
there's a really significant cost of sex.

46
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:38,000
If you're an uninfected man living in Botswana, where the HIV rate is 30 percent,

47
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:42,000
if you have one more partner this year -- a long-term partner, girlfriend, mistress --

48
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:46,000
your chance of dying in 10 years increases by three percentage points.

49
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:48,000
That is a huge effect.

50
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And so I think that we really feel like then people should have less sex.

51
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And in fact among gay men in the US

52
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:55,000
we did see that kind of change in the 1980s.

53
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So if we look in this particularly high-risk sample, they're being asked,

54
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:02,000
"Did you have more than one unprotected sexual partner in the last two months?"

55
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Over a period from '84 to '88, that share drops from about 85 percent to 55 percent.

56
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It's a huge change in a very short period of time.

57
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:12,000
We didn't see anything like that in Africa.

58
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:15,000
So we don't have quite as good data, but you can see here

59
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:17,000
the share of single men having pre-marital sex,

60
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:19,000
or married men having extra-marital sex,

61
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and how that changes from the early '90s to late '90s,

62
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and late '90s to early 2000s. The epidemic is getting worse.

63
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:27,000
People are learning more things about it.

64
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:29,000
We see almost no change in sexual behavior.

65
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:33,000
These are just tiny decreases -- two percentage points -- not significant.

66
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
This seems puzzling. But I'm going to argue that you shouldn't be surprised by this,

67
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and that to understand this you need to think about health

68
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:43,000
the way than an economist does -- as an investment.

69
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So if you're a software engineer and you're trying to think about

70
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:49,000
whether to add some new functionality to your program,

71
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:51,000
it's important to think about how much it costs.

72
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:53,000
It's also important to think about what the benefit is.

73
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And one part of that benefit is how much longer

74
0:03:55,000 --> 0:03:57,000
you think this program is going to be active.

75
0:03:57,000 --> 0:03:59,000
If version 10 is coming out next week,

76
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:02,000
there's no point in adding more functionality into version nine.

77
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But your health decisions are the same.

78
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Every time you have a carrot instead of a cookie,

79
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:09,000
every time you go to the gym instead of going to the movies,

80
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that's a costly investment in your health.

81
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:13,000
But how much you want to invest is going to depend

82
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:15,000
on how much longer you expect to live in the future,

83
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:17,000
even if you don't make those investments.

84
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:2,000
AIDS is the same kind of thing. It's costly to avoid AIDS.

85
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:23,000
People really like to have sex.

86
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:29,000
But, you know, it has a benefit in terms of future longevity.

87
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:33,000
But life expectancy in Africa, even without AIDS, is really, really low:

88
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
40 or 50 years in a lot of places.

89
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I think it's possible, if we think about that intuition, and think about that fact,

90
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that maybe that explains some of this low behavior change.

91
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:45,000
But we really need to test that.

92
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And a great way to test that is to look across areas in Africa and see:

93
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:52,000
do people with more life expectancy change their sexual behavior more?

94
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And the way that I'm going to do that is,

95
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I'm going to look across areas with different levels of malaria.

96
0:04:57,000 --> 0:05:,000
So malaria is a disease that kills you.

97
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:03,000
It's a disease that kills a lot of adults in Africa, in addition to a lot of children.

98
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And so people who live in areas with a lot of malaria

99
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:1,000
are going to have lower life expectancy than people who live in areas with limited malaria.

100
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So one way to test to see whether we can explain

101
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:15,000
some of this behavior change by differences in life expectancy

102
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:18,000
is to look and see is there more behavior change

103
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:2,000
in areas where there's less malaria.

104
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So that's what this figure shows you.

105
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:26,000
This shows you -- in areas with low malaria, medium malaria, high malaria --

106
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
what happens to the number of sexual partners as you increase HIV prevalence.

107
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:32,000
If you look at the blue line,

108
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:35,000
the areas with low levels of malaria, you can see in those areas,

109
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:38,000
actually, the number of sexual partners is decreasing a lot

110
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:4,000
as HIV prevalence goes up.

111
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Areas with medium levels of malaria it decreases some --

112
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:45,000
it doesn't decrease as much. And areas with high levels of malaria --

113
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:5,000
actually, it's increasing a little bit, although that's not significant.

114
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:52,000
This is not just through malaria.

115
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Young women who live in areas with high maternal mortality

116
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:58,000
change their behavior less in response to HIV

117
0:05:58,000 --> 0:06:01,000
than young women who live in areas with low maternal mortality.

118
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:05,000
There's another risk, and they respond less to this existing risk.

119
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So by itself, I think this tells a lot about how people behave.

120
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:12,000
It tells us something about why we see limited behavior change in Africa.

121
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:14,000
But it also tells us something about policy.

122
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Even if you only cared about AIDS in Africa,

123
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:2,000
it might still be a good idea to invest in malaria,

124
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:22,000
in combating poor indoor air quality,

125
0:06:22,000 --> 0:06:24,000
in improving maternal mortality rates.

126
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Because if you improve those things,

127
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
then people are going to have an incentive to avoid AIDS on their own.

128
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:34,000
But it also tells us something about one of these facts that we talked about before.

129
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Education campaigns, like the one that the president is focusing on in his funding,

130
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:4,000
may not be enough, at least not alone.

131
0:06:4,000 --> 0:06:42,000
If people have no incentive to avoid AIDS on their own,

132
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:44,000
even if they know everything about the disease,

133
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:46,000
they still may not change their behavior.

134
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So the other thing that I think we learn here is that AIDS is not going to fix itself.

135
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:51,000
People aren't changing their behavior enough

136
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:54,000
to decrease the growth in the epidemic.

137
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:56,000
So we're going to need to think about policy

138
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and what kind of policies might be effective.

139
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And a great way to learn about policy is to look at what worked in the past.

140
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:03,000
The reason that we know that the ABC campaign

141
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:06,000
was effective in Uganda is we have good data on prevalence over time.

142
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:08,000
In Uganda we see the prevalence went down.

143
0:07:08,000 --> 0:07:11,000
We know they had this campaign. That's how we learn about what works.

144
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:13,000
It's not the only place we had any interventions.

145
0:07:13,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Other places have tried things, so why don't we look at those places

146
0:07:17,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and see what happened to their prevalence?

147
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Unfortunately, there's almost no good data

148
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:27,000
on HIV prevalence in the general population in Africa until about 2003.

149
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So if I asked you, "Why don't you go and find me

150
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:32,000
the prevalence in Burkina Faso in 1991?"

151
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:35,000
You get on Google, you Google, and you find,

152
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:38,000
actually the only people tested in Burkina Faso in 1991

153
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:4,000
are STD patients and pregnant women,

154
0:07:4,000 --> 0:07:42,000
which is not a terribly representative group of people.

155
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Then if you poked a little more, you looked a little more at what was going on,

156
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:48,000
you'd find that actually that was a pretty good year,

157
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:51,000
because in some years the only people tested are IV drug users.

158
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:53,000
But even worse -- some years it's only IV drug users,

159
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:55,000
some years it's only pregnant women.

160
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:57,000
We have no way to figure out what happened over time.

161
0:07:57,000 --> 0:07:59,000
We have no consistent testing.

162
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Now in the last few years, we actually have done some good testing.

163
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:07,000
In Kenya, in Zambia, and a bunch of countries,

164
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:1,000
there's been testing in random samples of the population.

165
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:13,000
But this leaves us with a big gap in our knowledge.

166
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:16,000
So I can tell you what the prevalence was in Kenya in 2003,

167
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
but I can't tell you anything about 1993 or 1983.

168
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So this is a problem for policy. It was a problem for my research.

169
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And I started thinking about how else might we figure out

170
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:29,000
what the prevalence of HIV was in Africa in the past.

171
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And I think that the answer is, we can look at mortality data,

172
0:08:33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and we can use mortality data to figure out what the prevalence was in the past.

173
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:39,000
To do this, we're going to have to rely on the fact

174
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:41,000
that AIDS is a very specific kind of disease.

175
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:43,000
It kills people in the prime of their lives.

176
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Not a lot of other diseases have that profile. And you can see here --

177
0:08:46,000 --> 0:08:5,000
this is a graph of death rates by age in Botswana and Egypt.

178
0:08:5,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Botswana is a place with a lot of AIDS,

179
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Egypt is a place without a lot of AIDS.

180
0:08:54,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And you see they have pretty similar death rates among young kids and old people.

181
0:08:57,000 --> 0:09:,000
That suggests it's pretty similar levels of development.

182
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:03,000
But in this middle region, between 20 and 45,

183
0:09:03,000 --> 0:09:07,000
the death rates in Botswana are much, much, much higher than in Egypt.

184
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:11,000
But since there are very few other diseases that kill people,

185
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:14,000
we can really attribute that mortality to HIV.

186
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:18,000
But because people who died this year of AIDS got it a few years ago,

187
0:09:18,000 --> 0:09:23,000
we can use this data on mortality to figure out what HIV prevalence was in the past.

188
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:25,000
So it turns out, if you use this technique,

189
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:27,000
actually your estimates of prevalence are very close

190
0:09:27,000 --> 0:09:3,000
to what we get from testing random samples in the population,

191
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:35,000
but they're very, very different than what UNAIDS tells us the prevalences are.

192
0:09:35,000 --> 0:09:38,000
So this is a graph of prevalence estimated by UNAIDS,

193
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and prevalence based on the mortality data

194
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:44,000
for the years in the late 1990s in nine countries in Africa.

195
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:46,000
You can see, almost without exception,

196
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:5,000
the UNAIDS estimates are much higher than the mortality-based estimates.

197
0:09:5,000 --> 0:09:54,000
UNAIDS tell us that the HIV rate in Zambia is 20 percent,

198
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and mortality estimates suggest it's only about 5 percent.

199
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And these are not trivial differences in mortality rates.

200
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:03,000
So this is another way to see this.

201
0:10:03,000 --> 0:10:05,000
You can see that for the prevalence to be as high as UNAIDS says,

202
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:07,000
we have to really see 60 deaths per 10,000

203
0:10:07,000 --> 0:10:11,000
rather than 20 deaths per 10,000 in this age group.

204
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:13,000
I'm going to talk a little bit in a minute

205
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:16,000
about how we can use this kind of information to learn something

206
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that's going to help us think about the world.

207
0:10:18,000 --> 0:10:2,000
But this also tells us that one of these facts

208
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:23,000
that I mentioned in the beginning may not be quite right.

209
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:25,000
If you think that 25 million people are infected,

210
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:28,000
if you think that the UNAIDS numbers are much too high,

211
0:10:28,000 --> 0:10:3,000
maybe that's more like 10 or 15 million.

212
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:34,000
It doesn't mean that AIDS isn't a problem. It's a gigantic problem.

213
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:38,000
But it does suggest that that number might be a little big.

214
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:4,000
What I really want to do, is I want to use this new data

215
0:10:4,000 --> 0:10:44,000
to try to figure out what makes the HIV epidemic grow faster or slower.

216
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And I said in the beginning, I wasn't going to tell you about exports.

217
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:49,000
When I started working on these projects,

218
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I was not thinking at all about economics,

219
0:10:51,000 --> 0:10:54,000
but eventually it kind of sucks you back in.

220
0:10:54,000 --> 0:10:57,000
So I am going to talk about exports and prices.

221
0:10:57,000 --> 0:11:,000
And I want to talk about the relationship between economic activity,

222
0:11:,000 --> 0:11:04,000
in particular export volume, and HIV infections.

223
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:08,000
So obviously, as an economist, I'm deeply familiar

224
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:1,000
with the fact that development, that openness to trade,

225
0:11:1,000 --> 0:11:12,000
is really good for developing countries.

226
0:11:12,000 --> 0:11:15,000
It's good for improving people's lives.

227
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:17,000
But openness and inter-connectedness, it comes with a cost

228
0:11:17,000 --> 0:11:2,000
when we think about disease. I don't think this should be a surprise.

229
0:11:2,000 --> 0:11:22,000
On Wednesday, I learned from Laurie Garrett

230
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:24,000
that I'm definitely going to get the bird flu,

231
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and I wouldn't be at all worried about that

232
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:3,000
if we never had any contact with Asia.

233
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And HIV is actually particularly closely linked to transit.

234
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:36,000
The epidemic was introduced to the US

235
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:4,000
by actually one male steward on an airline flight,

236
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:42,000
who got the disease in Africa and brought it back.

237
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And that was the genesis of the entire epidemic in the US.

238
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:49,000
In Africa, epidemiologists have noted for a long time

239
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:53,000
that truck drivers and migrants are more likely to be infected than other people.

240
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Areas with a lot of economic activity --

241
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:58,000
with a lot of roads, with a lot of urbanization --

242
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:,000
those areas have higher prevalence than others.

243
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:02,000
But that actually doesn't mean at all

244
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:06,000
that if we gave people more exports, more trade, that that would increase prevalence.

245
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:1,000
By using this new data, using this information about prevalence over time,

246
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:14,000
we can actually test that. And so it seems to be --

247
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:16,000
fortunately, I think -- it seems to be the case

248
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
that these things are positively related.

249
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:22,000
More exports means more AIDS. And that effect is really big.

250
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:26,000
So the data that I have suggests that if you double export volume,

251
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
it will lead to a quadrupling of new HIV infections.

252
0:12:31,000 --> 0:12:34,000
So this has important implications both for forecasting and for policy.

253
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:38,000
From a forecasting perspective, if we know where trade is likely to change,

254
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:41,000
for example, because of the African Growth and Opportunities Act

255
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:43,000
or other policies that encourage trade,

256
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:48,000
we can actually think about which areas are likely to be heavily infected with HIV.

257
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And we can go and we can try to have pre-emptive preventive measures there.

258
0:12:54,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Likewise, as we're developing policies to try to encourage exports,

259
0:12:57,000 --> 0:12:59,000
if we know there's this externality --

260
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:01,000
this extra thing that's going to happen as we increase exports --

261
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:04,000
we can think about what the right kinds of policies are.

262
0:13:04,000 --> 0:13:07,000
But it also tells us something about one of these things that we think that we know.

263
0:13:07,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Even though it is the case that poverty is linked to AIDS,

264
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:13,000
in the sense that Africa is poor and they have a lot of AIDS,

265
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:17,000
it's not necessarily the case that improving poverty -- at least in the short run,

266
0:13:17,000 --> 0:13:19,000
that improving exports and improving development --

267
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:21,000
it's not necessarily the case that that's going to lead

268
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:23,000
to a decline in HIV prevalence.

269
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:26,000
So throughout this talk I've mentioned a few times

270
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
the special case of Uganda, and the fact that

271
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:32,000
it's the only country in sub-Saharan Africa with successful prevention.

272
0:13:32,000 --> 0:13:34,000
It's been widely heralded.

273
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:4,000
It's been replicated in Kenya, and Tanzania, and South Africa and many other places.

274
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:44,000
But now I want to actually also question that.

275
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Because it is true that there was a decline in prevalence

276
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:51,000
in Uganda in the 1990s. It's true that they had an education campaign.

277
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:57,000
But there was actually something else that happened in Uganda in this period.

278
0:13:57,000 --> 0:13:59,000
There was a big decline in coffee prices.

279
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Coffee is Uganda's major export.

280
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Their exports went down a lot in the early 1990s -- and actually that decline lines up

281
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:1,000
really, really closely with this decline in new HIV infections.

282
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:13,000
So you can see that both of these series --

283
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:16,000
the black line is export value, the red line is new HIV infections --

284
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
you can see they're both increasing.

285
0:14:18,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Starting about 1987 they're both going down a lot.

286
0:14:2,000 --> 0:14:22,000
And then actually they track each other

287
0:14:22,000 --> 0:14:24,000
a little bit on the increase later in the decade.

288
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:26,000
So if you combine the intuition in this figure

289
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
with some of the data that I talked about before,

290
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:33,000
it suggests that somewhere between 25 percent and 50 percent

291
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
of the decline in prevalence in Uganda

292
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:39,000
actually would have happened even without any education campaign.

293
0:14:39,000 --> 0:14:41,000
But that's enormously important for policy.

294
0:14:41,000 --> 0:14:43,000
We're spending so much money to try to replicate this campaign.

295
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And if it was only 50 percent as effective as we think that it was,

296
0:14:46,000 --> 0:14:48,000
then there are all sorts of other things

297
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:5,000
maybe we should be spending our money on instead.

298
0:14:5,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Trying to change transmission rates by treating other sexually transmitted diseases.

299
0:14:54,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Trying to change them by engaging in male circumcision.

300
0:14:56,000 --> 0:14:58,000
There are tons of other things that we should think about doing.

301
0:14:58,000 --> 0:15:02,000
And maybe this tells us that we should be thinking more about those things.

302
0:15:02,000 --> 0:15:07,000
I hope that in the last 16 minutes I've told you something that you didn't know about AIDS,

303
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and I hope that I've gotten you questioning a little bit

304
0:15:09,000 --> 0:15:11,000
some of the things that you did know.

305
0:15:11,000 --> 0:15:13,000
And I hope that I've convinced you maybe

306
0:15:13,000 --> 0:15:15,000
that it's important to understand things about the epidemic

307
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:17,000
in order to think about policy.

308
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:2,000
But more than anything, you know, I'm an academic.

309
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And when I leave here, I'm going to go back

310
0:15:22,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and sit in my tiny office, and my computer, and my data.

311
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And the thing that's most exciting about that

312
0:15:27,000 --> 0:15:3,000
is every time I think about research, there are more questions.

313
0:15:3,000 --> 0:15:32,000
There are more things that I think that I want to do.

314
0:15:32,000 --> 0:15:34,000
And what's really, really great about being here

315
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:36,000
is I'm sure that the questions that you guys have

316
0:15:36,000 --> 0:15:39,000
are very, very different than the questions that I think up myself.

317
0:15:39,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And I can't wait to hear about what they are.

318
0:15:41,000 --> 0:15:43,000
So thank you very much.

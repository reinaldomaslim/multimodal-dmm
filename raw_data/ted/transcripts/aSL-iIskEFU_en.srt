1
0:00:13.34,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Chris Anderson: So, this is an interview with a difference.

2
0:00:16.947,000 --> 0:00:2,000
On the basis that a picture is worth a thousand words,

3
0:00:21.015,000 --> 0:00:23,000
what I did was, I asked Bill and Melinda

4
0:00:23.911,000 --> 0:00:25,000
to dig out from their archive

5
0:00:26.118,000 --> 0:00:28,000
some images that would help explain

6
0:00:28.216,000 --> 0:00:29,000
some of what they've done,

7
0:00:29.652,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and do a few things that way.

8
0:00:32.249,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So, we're going to start here.

9
0:00:35.98,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Melinda, when and where was this,

10
0:00:38.183,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and who is that handsome man next to you?

11
0:00:40.217,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Melinda Gates: With those big glasses, huh?

12
0:00:42.226,000 --> 0:00:44,000
This is in Africa, our very first trip,

13
0:00:44.265,000 --> 0:00:45,000
the first time either of us had ever been to Africa,

14
0:00:46.17,000 --> 0:00:47,000
in the fall of 1993.

15
0:00:47.78,000 --> 0:00:48,000
We were already engaged to be married.

16
0:00:49.768,000 --> 0:00:5,000
We married a few months later,

17
0:00:51.474,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and this was the trip where we really went to see

18
0:00:53.691,000 --> 0:00:54,000
the animals and to see the savanna.

19
0:00:55.583,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It was incredible. Bill had never taken that much time

20
0:00:57.571,000 --> 0:00:58,000
off from work.

21
0:00:58.983,000 --> 0:01:02,000
But what really touched us, actually, were the people,

22
0:01:03.61,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and the extreme poverty.

23
0:01:06.218,000 --> 0:01:07,000
We started asking ourselves questions.

24
0:01:07.791,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Does it have to be like this?

25
0:01:09.595,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And at the end of the trip,

26
0:01:10.546,000 --> 0:01:11,000
we went out to Zanzibar,

27
0:01:11.646,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and took some time to walk on the beach,

28
0:01:13.134,000 --> 0:01:14,000
which is something we had done a lot

29
0:01:14.5,000 --> 0:01:15,000
while we were dating.

30
0:01:15.818,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And we'd already been talking about during that time

31
0:01:18.791,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that the wealth that had come from Microsoft

32
0:01:20.648,000 --> 0:01:21,000
would be given back to society,

33
0:01:21.923,000 --> 0:01:22,000
but it was really on that beach walk

34
0:01:23.497,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that we started to talk about, well,

35
0:01:25.069,000 --> 0:01:28,000
what might we do and how might we go about it?

36
0:01:28.602,000 --> 0:01:3,000
CA: So, given that this vacation

37
0:01:31.334,000 --> 0:01:33,000
led to the creation of

38
0:01:33.526,000 --> 0:01:35,000
the world's biggest private foundation,

39
0:01:36.342,000 --> 0:01:39,000
it's pretty expensive as vacations go. (Laughter)

40
0:01:39.474,000 --> 0:01:41,000
MG: I guess so. We enjoyed it.

41
0:01:41.942,000 --> 0:01:43,000
CA: Which of you was the key instigator here,

42
0:01:44.84,000 --> 0:01:46,000
or was it symmetrical?

43
0:01:47.793,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Bill Gates: Well, I think we were excited

44
0:01:50.186,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that there'd be a phase of our life

45
0:01:51.653,000 --> 0:01:53,000
where we'd get to work together

46
0:01:53.714,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and figure out how to give this money back.

47
0:02:00.325,000 --> 0:02:03,000
At this stage, we were talking about the poorest,

48
0:02:03.474,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and could you have a big impact on them?

49
0:02:05.876,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Were there things that weren't being done?

50
0:02:07.801,000 --> 0:02:08,000
There was a lot we didn't know.

51
0:02:09.701,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Our naïveté is pretty incredible,

52
0:02:11.789,000 --> 0:02:12,000
when we look back on it.

53
0:02:12.881,000 --> 0:02:13,000
But we had a certain enthusiasm

54
0:02:14.437,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that that would be the phase,

55
0:02:17.434,000 --> 0:02:19,000
the post-Microsoft phase

56
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
would be our philanthropy.

57
0:02:22.388,000 --> 0:02:24,000
MG: Which Bill always thought was going to come

58
0:02:24.534,000 --> 0:02:25,000
after he was 60,

59
0:02:25.67,000 --> 0:02:26,000
so he hasn't quite hit 60 yet,

60
0:02:27.332,000 --> 0:02:3,000
so some things change along the way.

61
0:02:30.525,000 --> 0:02:32,000
CA: So it started there, but it got accelerated.

62
0:02:32.969,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So that was '93, and it was '97, really,

63
0:02:35.489,000 --> 0:02:36,000
before the foundation itself started.

64
0:02:37.227,000 --> 0:02:39,000
MA: Yeah, in '97, we read an article

65
0:02:39.532,000 --> 0:02:42,000
about diarrheal diseases killing so many kids around the world,

66
0:02:42.946,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and we kept saying to ourselves,

67
0:02:44.56,000 --> 0:02:45,000
"Well that can't be.

68
0:02:45.8,000 --> 0:02:46,000
In the U.S., you just go down to the drug store."

69
0:02:47.554,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And so we started gathering scientists

70
0:02:49.719,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and started learning about population,

71
0:02:52.185,000 --> 0:02:53,000
learning about vaccines,

72
0:02:53.545,000 --> 0:02:55,000
learning about what had worked and what had failed,

73
0:02:55.932,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and that's really when we got going,

74
0:02:57.838,000 --> 0:03:01,000
was in late 1998, 1999.

75
0:03:02.215,000 --> 0:03:04,000
CA: So, you've got a big pot of money

76
0:03:04.966,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and a world full of so many different issues.

77
0:03:07.293,000 --> 0:03:11,000
How on Earth do you decide what to focus on?

78
0:03:11.515,000 --> 0:03:13,000
BG: Well, we decided that we'd pick two causes,

79
0:03:14.06,000 --> 0:03:16,000
whatever the biggest inequity was globally,

80
0:03:16.92,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and there we looked at children dying,

81
0:03:19.18,000 --> 0:03:21,000
children not having enough nutrition to ever develop,

82
0:03:21.92,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and countries that were really stuck,

83
0:03:23.419,000 --> 0:03:25,000
because with that level of death,

84
0:03:25.679,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and parents would have so many kids

85
0:03:27.647,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that they'd get huge population growth,

86
0:03:29.165,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and that the kids were so sick

87
0:03:32.291,000 --> 0:03:34,000
that they really couldn't be educated

88
0:03:34.937,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and lift themselves up.

89
0:03:36.809,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So that was our global thing,

90
0:03:37.917,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and then in the U.S.,

91
0:03:40.637,000 --> 0:03:42,000
both of us have had amazing educations,

92
0:03:43.411,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and we saw that as the way that the U.S.

93
0:03:46.46,000 --> 0:03:49,000
could live up to its promise of equal opportunity

94
0:03:49.472,000 --> 0:03:51,000
is by having a phenomenal education system,

95
0:03:52.057,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and the more we learned, the more we realized

96
0:03:54.685,000 --> 0:03:56,000
we're not really fulfilling that promise.

97
0:03:57.113,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And so we picked those two things,

98
0:03:58.95,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and everything the foundation does

99
0:04:00.602,000 --> 0:04:03,000
is focused there.

100
0:04:03.616,000 --> 0:04:05,000
CA: So, I asked each of you to pick an image

101
0:04:05.952,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that you like that illustrates your work,

102
0:04:08.384,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and Melinda, this is what you picked.

103
0:04:11.452,000 --> 0:04:12,000
What's this about?

104
0:04:12.919,000 --> 0:04:15,000
MG: So I, one of the things I love to do when I travel

105
0:04:15.95,000 --> 0:04:18,000
is to go out to the rural areas and talk to the women,

106
0:04:19.06,000 --> 0:04:21,000
whether it's Bangladesh, India, lots of countries in Africa,

107
0:04:21.658,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and I go in as a Western woman without a name.

108
0:04:24.066,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I don't tell them who I am. Pair of khakis.

109
0:04:27.475,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And I kept hearing from women,

110
0:04:28.979,000 --> 0:04:3,000
over and over and over, the more I traveled,

111
0:04:31.862,000 --> 0:04:33,000
"I want to be able to use this shot."

112
0:04:34.271,000 --> 0:04:36,000
I would be there to talk to them about childhood vaccines,

113
0:04:36.84,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and they would bring the conversation around to

114
0:04:39.24,000 --> 0:04:4,000
"But what about the shot I get?"

115
0:04:41.221,000 --> 0:04:43,000
which is an injection they were getting called Depo-Provera,

116
0:04:43.673,000 --> 0:04:44,000
which is a contraceptive.

117
0:04:45.654,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And I would come back and talk to global health experts,

118
0:04:47.986,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and they'd say, "Oh no, contraceptives

119
0:04:49.539,000 --> 0:04:51,000
are stocked in in the developing world."

120
0:04:51.931,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Well, you had to dig deeper into the reports,

121
0:04:53.921,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and this is what the team came to me with,

122
0:04:55.697,000 --> 0:04:57,000
which is, to have the number one thing

123
0:04:57.843,000 --> 0:05:,000
that women tell you in Africa they want to use

124
0:05:00.981,000 --> 0:05:02,000
stocked out more than 200 days a year

125
0:05:03.598,000 --> 0:05:04,000
explains why women were saying to me,

126
0:05:05.502,000 --> 0:05:08,000
"I walked 10 kilometers without my husband knowing it,

127
0:05:09.054,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and I got to the clinic, and there was nothing there."

128
0:05:12.363,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And so condoms were stocked in in Africa

129
0:05:15.17,000 --> 0:05:17,000
because of all the AIDS work that the U.S.

130
0:05:17.447,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and others supported.

131
0:05:18.851,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But women will tell you over and over again,

132
0:05:20.522,000 --> 0:05:22,000
"I can't negotiate a condom with my husband.

133
0:05:23.132,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I'm either suggesting he has AIDS or I have AIDS,

134
0:05:27.34,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and I need that tool because then I can space

135
0:05:30.1,000 --> 0:05:32,000
the births of my children, and I can feed them

136
0:05:32.517,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and have a chance of educating them."

137
0:05:35.055,000 --> 0:05:37,000
CA: Melinda, you're Roman Catholic,

138
0:05:37.105,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and you've often been embroiled

139
0:05:40.674,000 --> 0:05:41,000
in controversy over this issue,

140
0:05:42.628,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and on the abortion question,

141
0:05:44.877,000 --> 0:05:45,000
on both sides, really.

142
0:05:46.332,000 --> 0:05:47,000
How do you navigate that?

143
0:05:48.023,000 --> 0:05:51,000
MG: Yeah, so I think that's a really important point,

144
0:05:51.133,000 --> 0:05:54,000
which is, we had backed away from contraceptives

145
0:05:54.216,000 --> 0:05:55,000
as a global community.

146
0:05:55.383,000 --> 0:05:58,000
We knew that 210 million women

147
0:05:58.677,000 --> 0:06:,000
were saying they wanted access to contraceptives,

148
0:06:00.936,000 --> 0:06:02,000
even the contraceptives we have here in the United States,

149
0:06:03.576,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and we weren't providing them

150
0:06:05.881,000 --> 0:06:08,000
because of the political controversy in our country,

151
0:06:09.632,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and to me that was just a crime,

152
0:06:11.809,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and I kept looking around trying to find the person

153
0:06:14.574,000 --> 0:06:16,000
that would get this back on the global stage,

154
0:06:16.924,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and I finally realized I just had to do it.

155
0:06:18.93,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And even though I'm Catholic,

156
0:06:20.601,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I believe in contraceptives

157
0:06:22.042,000 --> 0:06:24,000
just like most of the Catholic women in the United States

158
0:06:24.338,000 --> 0:06:25,000
who report using contraceptives,

159
0:06:26.169,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and I shouldn't let that controversy

160
0:06:28.454,000 --> 0:06:29,000
be the thing that holds us back.

161
0:06:30.269,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We used to have consensus in the United States

162
0:06:32.227,000 --> 0:06:33,000
around contraceptives,

163
0:06:33.492,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and so we got back to that global consensus,

164
0:06:35.972,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and actually raised 2.6 billion dollars

165
0:06:38.616,000 --> 0:06:4,000
around exactly this issue for women.

166
0:06:41.149,000 --> 0:06:46,000
(Applause)

167
0:06:49.249,000 --> 0:06:52,000
CA: Bill, this is your graph. What's this about?

168
0:06:53.105,000 --> 0:06:54,000
BG: Well, my graph has numbers on it.

169
0:06:55.09,000 --> 0:06:57,000
(Laughter)

170
0:06:57.208,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I really like this graph.

171
0:06:59.025,000 --> 0:07:01,000
This is the number of children

172
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:04,000
who die before the age of five every year.

173
0:07:04.582,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And what you find is really

174
0:07:06.405,000 --> 0:07:07,000
a phenomenal success story

175
0:07:08.355,000 --> 0:07:1,000
which is not widely known,

176
0:07:10.509,000 --> 0:07:12,000
that we are making incredible progress.

177
0:07:13.184,000 --> 0:07:15,000
We go from 20 million

178
0:07:15.562,000 --> 0:07:16,000
not long after I was born

179
0:07:17.266,000 --> 0:07:2,000
to now we're down to about six million.

180
0:07:20.952,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So this is a story

181
0:07:23.089,000 --> 0:07:24,000
largely of vaccines.

182
0:07:24.756,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Smallpox was killing a couple million kids a year.

183
0:07:27.88,000 --> 0:07:29,000
That was eradicated, so that got down to zero.

184
0:07:30.07,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Measles was killing a couple million a year.

185
0:07:31.91,000 --> 0:07:32,000
That's down to a few hundred thousand.

186
0:07:33.613,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Anyway, this is a chart

187
0:07:35.521,000 --> 0:07:39,000
where you want to get that number to continue,

188
0:07:39.708,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and it's going to be possible,

189
0:07:41.448,000 --> 0:07:42,000
using the science of new vaccines,

190
0:07:43.124,000 --> 0:07:44,000
getting the vaccines out to kids.

191
0:07:45.016,000 --> 0:07:46,000
We can actually accelerate the progress.

192
0:07:46.74,000 --> 0:07:47,000
The last decade,

193
0:07:48.303,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that number has dropped faster

194
0:07:50.115,000 --> 0:07:52,000
than ever in history,

195
0:07:52.393,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and so I just love the fact that

196
0:07:55.116,000 --> 0:07:57,000
you can say, okay, if we can invent new vaccines,

197
0:07:57.381,000 --> 0:07:58,000
we can get them out there,

198
0:07:58.889,000 --> 0:08:,000
use the very latest understanding of these things,

199
0:08:01.374,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and get the delivery right, that we can perform a miracle.

200
0:08:05.985,000 --> 0:08:06,000
CA: I mean, you do the math on this,

201
0:08:07.143,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and it works out, I think, literally

202
0:08:09.017,000 --> 0:08:11,000
to thousands of kids' lives saved every day

203
0:08:11.143,000 --> 0:08:13,000
compared to the prior year.

204
0:08:13.197,000 --> 0:08:14,000
It's not reported.

205
0:08:15.044,000 --> 0:08:18,000
An airliner with 200-plus deaths

206
0:08:18.29,000 --> 0:08:2,000
is a far, far bigger story than that.

207
0:08:20.5,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Does that drive you crazy?

208
0:08:22.049,000 --> 0:08:24,000
BG: Yeah, because it's a silent thing going on.

209
0:08:25.04,000 --> 0:08:27,000
It's a kid, one kid at a time.

210
0:08:27.71,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Ninety-eight percent of this

211
0:08:29.173,000 --> 0:08:3,000
has nothing to do with natural disasters,

212
0:08:31.05,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and yet, people's charity,

213
0:08:32.527,000 --> 0:08:33,000
when they see a natural disaster, are wonderful.

214
0:08:34.05,000 --> 0:08:36,000
It's incredible how people think, okay,

215
0:08:36.286,000 --> 0:08:38,000
that could be me, and the money flows.

216
0:08:39.062,000 --> 0:08:42,000
These causes have been a bit invisible.

217
0:08:42.468,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Now that the Millennium Development Goals

218
0:08:44.679,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and various things are getting out there,

219
0:08:46.229,000 --> 0:08:48,000
we are seeing some increased generosity,

220
0:08:49.073,000 --> 0:08:52,000
so the goal is to get this well below a million,

221
0:08:52.344,000 --> 0:08:54,000
which should be possible in our lifetime.

222
0:08:54.762,000 --> 0:08:55,000
CA: Maybe it needed someone

223
0:08:55.942,000 --> 0:08:57,000
who is turned on by numbers and graphs

224
0:08:58.038,000 --> 0:09:,000
rather than just the big, sad face

225
0:09:00.452,000 --> 0:09:01,000
to get engaged.

226
0:09:02.107,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I mean, you've used it in your letter this year,

227
0:09:03.83,000 --> 0:09:06,000
you used basically this argument to say that aid,

228
0:09:07.281,000 --> 0:09:08,000
contrary to the current meme

229
0:09:08.952,000 --> 0:09:11,000
that aid is kind of worthless and broken,

230
0:09:12.035,000 --> 0:09:13,000
that actually it has been effective.

231
0:09:13.988,000 --> 0:09:14,000
BG: Yeah, well people can take,

232
0:09:15.968,000 --> 0:09:18,000
there is some aid that was well-meaning

233
0:09:19.148,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and didn't go well.

234
0:09:21.071,000 --> 0:09:22,000
There's some venture capital investments

235
0:09:23.004,000 --> 0:09:25,000
that were well-meaning and didn't go well.

236
0:09:25.904,000 --> 0:09:27,000
You shouldn't just say, okay, because of that,

237
0:09:28.743,000 --> 0:09:31,000
because we don't have a perfect record,

238
0:09:31.861,000 --> 0:09:32,000
this is a bad endeavor.

239
0:09:33.393,000 --> 0:09:34,000
You should look at, what was your goal?

240
0:09:35.263,000 --> 0:09:37,000
How are you trying to uplift nutrition

241
0:09:37.871,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and survival and literacy

242
0:09:41.275,000 --> 0:09:42,000
so these countries can take care of themselves,

243
0:09:42.91,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and say wow, this is going well,

244
0:09:44.914,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and be smarter.

245
0:09:46.186,000 --> 0:09:47,000
We can spend aid smarter.

246
0:09:48.026,000 --> 0:09:51,000
It is not all a panacea.

247
0:09:51.438,000 --> 0:09:53,000
We can do better than venture capital, I think,

248
0:09:54.37,000 --> 0:09:56,000
including big hits like this.

249
0:09:57.157,000 --> 0:09:59,000
CA: Traditional wisdom is that

250
0:09:59.9,000 --> 0:10:03,000
it's pretty hard for married couples to work together.

251
0:10:03.948,000 --> 0:10:04,000
How have you guys managed it?

252
0:10:05.564,000 --> 0:10:06,000
MG: Yeah, I've had a lot of women say to me,

253
0:10:07.234,000 --> 0:10:08,000
"I really don't think I could work with my husband.

254
0:10:09.093,000 --> 0:10:11,000
That just wouldn't work out."

255
0:10:11.24,000 --> 0:10:14,000
You know, we enjoy it, and we don't --

256
0:10:14.829,000 --> 0:10:16,000
this foundation has been a coming to for both of us

257
0:10:17.315,000 --> 0:10:19,000
in its continuous learning journey,

258
0:10:20.143,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and we don't travel together as much

259
0:10:22.902,000 --> 0:10:23,000
for the foundation, actually, as we used to

260
0:10:24.83,000 --> 0:10:25,000
when Bill was working at Microsoft.

261
0:10:26.286,000 --> 0:10:28,000
We have more trips where we're traveling separately,

262
0:10:28.509,000 --> 0:10:3,000
but I always know when I come home,

263
0:10:30.651,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Bill's going to be interested in what I learned,

264
0:10:32.79,000 --> 0:10:33,000
whether it's about women or girls

265
0:10:34.533,000 --> 0:10:36,000
or something new about the vaccine delivery chain,

266
0:10:37.219,000 --> 0:10:39,000
or this person that is a great leader.

267
0:10:39.455,000 --> 0:10:41,000
He's going to listen and be really interested.

268
0:10:41.922,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And he knows when he comes home,

269
0:10:43.525,000 --> 0:10:44,000
even if it's to talk about the speech he did

270
0:10:45.358,000 --> 0:10:46,000
or the data or what he's learned,

271
0:10:47.1,000 --> 0:10:48,000
I'm really interested,

272
0:10:48.342,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and I think we have a really collaborative relationship.

273
0:10:51.242,000 --> 0:10:53,000
But we don't every minute together, that's for sure.

274
0:10:53.916,000 --> 0:10:57,000
(Laughter)

275
0:10:58.091,000 --> 0:11:,000
CA: But now you are, and we're very happy that you are.

276
0:11:00.586,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Melinda, early on, you were basically

277
0:11:04.172,000 --> 0:11:06,000
largely running the show.

278
0:11:06.173,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Six years ago, I guess,

279
0:11:07.385,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Bill came on full time, so moved from Microsoft

280
0:11:09.968,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and became full time.

281
0:11:11.079,000 --> 0:11:11,000
That must have been hard,

282
0:11:12.058,000 --> 0:11:14,000
adjusting to that. No?

283
0:11:14.094,000 --> 0:11:17,000
MG: Yeah. I think actually,

284
0:11:17.148,000 --> 0:11:18,000
for the foundation employees,

285
0:11:19.137,000 --> 0:11:21,000
there was way more angst for them

286
0:11:21.684,000 --> 0:11:22,000
than there was for me about Bill coming.

287
0:11:23.05,000 --> 0:11:24,000
I was actually really excited.

288
0:11:24.256,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I mean, Bill made this decision

289
0:11:25.875,000 --> 0:11:27,000
even obviously before it got announced in 2006,

290
0:11:28.558,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and it was really his decision,

291
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
but again, it was a beach vacation

292
0:11:32.146,000 --> 0:11:33,000
where we were walking on the beach

293
0:11:33.45,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and he was starting to think of this idea.

294
0:11:35.714,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And for me, the excitement of Bill

295
0:11:38.326,000 --> 0:11:4,000
putting his brain and his heart

296
0:11:41.035,000 --> 0:11:43,000
against these huge global problems,

297
0:11:43.382,000 --> 0:11:45,000
these inequities, to me that was exciting.

298
0:11:45.71,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Yes, the foundation employees had angst about that.

299
0:11:49.444,000 --> 0:11:5,000
(Applause)

300
0:11:51.119,000 --> 0:11:53,000
CA: That's cool.

301
0:11:53.235,000 --> 0:11:54,000
MG: But that went away within three months,

302
0:11:54.919,000 --> 0:11:54,000
once he was there.

303
0:11:55.846,000 --> 0:11:56,000
BG: Including some of the employees.

304
0:11:57.511,000 --> 0:11:58,000
MG: That's what I said, the employees,

305
0:11:58.784,000 --> 0:12:,000
it went away for them three months after you were there.

306
0:12:00.906,000 --> 0:12:02,000
BG: No, I'm kidding. MG: Oh, you mean, the employees didn't go away.

307
0:12:03.226,000 --> 0:12:04,000
BG: A few of them did, but —

308
0:12:05.127,000 --> 0:12:06,000
(Laughter)

309
0:12:06.96,000 --> 0:12:07,000
CA: So what do you guys argue about?

310
0:12:08.903,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Sunday, 11 o'clock,

311
0:12:11.56,000 --> 0:12:12,000
you're away from work,

312
0:12:12.981,000 --> 0:12:14,000
what comes up? What's the argument?

313
0:12:15.494,000 --> 0:12:16,000
BG: Because we built this thing

314
0:12:17.139,000 --> 0:12:2,000
together from the beginning,

315
0:12:20.258,000 --> 0:12:21,000
it's this great partnership.

316
0:12:21.904,000 --> 0:12:22,000
I had that with Paul Allen

317
0:12:23.758,000 --> 0:12:24,000
in the early days of Microsoft.

318
0:12:25.669,000 --> 0:12:27,000
I had it with Steve Ballmer as Microsoft got bigger,

319
0:12:28.481,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and now Melinda, and in even stronger,

320
0:12:31.485,000 --> 0:12:32,000
equal ways, is the partner,

321
0:12:33.371,000 --> 0:12:34,000
so we talk a lot about

322
0:12:35.128,000 --> 0:12:37,000
which things should we give more to,

323
0:12:37.256,000 --> 0:12:39,000
which groups are working well?

324
0:12:39.8,000 --> 0:12:4,000
She's got a lot of insight.

325
0:12:41.053,000 --> 0:12:42,000
She'll sit down with the employees a lot.

326
0:12:42.7,000 --> 0:12:44,000
We'll take the different trips she described.

327
0:12:44.816,000 --> 0:12:47,000
So there's a lot of collaboration.

328
0:12:48.433,000 --> 0:12:49,000
I can't think of anything where one of us

329
0:12:50.409,000 --> 0:12:53,000
had a super strong opinion

330
0:12:53.679,000 --> 0:12:54,000
about one thing or another?

331
0:12:55.515,000 --> 0:12:57,000
CA: How about you, Melinda, though? Can you? (Laughter)

332
0:12:58.317,000 --> 0:12:59,000
You never know.

333
0:12:59.533,000 --> 0:13:,000
MG: Well, here's the thing.

334
0:13:01.059,000 --> 0:13:02,000
We come at things from different angles,

335
0:13:02.798,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and I actually think that's really good.

336
0:13:04.73,000 --> 0:13:06,000
So Bill can look at the big data

337
0:13:06.738,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and say, "I want to act based on these global statistics."

338
0:13:09.75,000 --> 0:13:1,000
For me, I come at it from intuition.

339
0:13:11.616,000 --> 0:13:12,000
I meet with lots of people on the ground

340
0:13:13.549,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and Bill's taught me to take that

341
0:13:15.529,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and read up to the global data and see if they match,

342
0:13:18.152,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and I think what I've taught him

343
0:13:19.241,000 --> 0:13:2,000
is to take that data

344
0:13:20.669,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and meet with people on the ground to understand,

345
0:13:22.283,000 --> 0:13:24,000
can you actually deliver that vaccine?

346
0:13:24.667,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Can you get a woman to accept those polio drops

347
0:13:27.868,000 --> 0:13:28,000
in her child's mouth?

348
0:13:29.198,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Because the delivery piece

349
0:13:30.756,000 --> 0:13:32,000
is every bit as important as the science.

350
0:13:32.959,000 --> 0:13:34,000
So I think it's been more a coming to over time

351
0:13:35.481,000 --> 0:13:36,000
towards each other's point of view,

352
0:13:36.776,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and quite frankly, the work is better because of it.

353
0:13:40.046,000 --> 0:13:42,000
CA: So, in vaccines and polio and so forth,

354
0:13:42.319,000 --> 0:13:45,000
you've had some amazing successes.

355
0:13:46.118,000 --> 0:13:47,000
What about failure, though?

356
0:13:47.35,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Can you talk about a failure

357
0:13:49.041,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and maybe what you've learned from it?

358
0:13:51.137,000 --> 0:13:53,000
BG: Yeah. Fortunately, we can afford a few failures,

359
0:13:53.705,000 --> 0:13:55,000
because we've certainly had them.

360
0:13:55.842,000 --> 0:13:59,000
We do a lot of drug work or vaccine work

361
0:14:00.216,000 --> 0:14:03,000
that you know you're going to have different failures.

362
0:14:03.492,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Like, we put out, one that got a lot of publicity

363
0:14:05.719,000 --> 0:14:06,000
was asking for a better condom.

364
0:14:07.02,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Well, we got hundreds of ideas.

365
0:14:08.514,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Maybe a few of those will work out.

366
0:14:11.708,000 --> 0:14:14,000
We were very naïve, certainly I was, about a drug

367
0:14:15.087,000 --> 0:14:17,000
for a disease in India, visceral leishmaniasis,

368
0:14:17.703,000 --> 0:14:18,000
that I thought, once I got this drug,

369
0:14:19.354,000 --> 0:14:2,000
we can just go wipe out the disease.

370
0:14:20.71,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Well, turns out it took an injection

371
0:14:23.29,000 --> 0:14:24,000
every day for 10 days.

372
0:14:24.926,000 --> 0:14:26,000
It took three more years to get it than we expected,

373
0:14:27.313,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and then there was no way

374
0:14:28.771,000 --> 0:14:3,000
it was going to get out there.

375
0:14:31.139,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Fortunately, we found out

376
0:14:32.358,000 --> 0:14:35,000
that if you go kill the sand flies,

377
0:14:35.52,000 --> 0:14:37,000
you probably can have success there,

378
0:14:37.642,000 --> 0:14:38,000
but we spent five years,

379
0:14:39.497,000 --> 0:14:4,000
you could say wasted five years,

380
0:14:40.875,000 --> 0:14:42,000
and about 60 million,

381
0:14:42.882,000 --> 0:14:43,000
on a path that turned out to have

382
0:14:44.222,000 --> 0:14:48,000
very modest benefit when we got there.

383
0:14:48.387,000 --> 0:14:51,000
CA: You're spending, like, a billion dollars a year

384
0:14:51.831,000 --> 0:14:52,000
in education, I think, something like that.

385
0:14:53.766,000 --> 0:14:57,000
Is anything, the story of what's gone right there

386
0:14:57.79,000 --> 0:14:59,000
is quite a long and complex one.

387
0:15:00.246,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Are there any failures that you can talk about?

388
0:15:04.168,000 --> 0:15:05,000
MG: Well, I would say a huge lesson for us

389
0:15:05.958,000 --> 0:15:06,000
out of the early work is we thought

390
0:15:07.206,000 --> 0:15:09,000
that these small schools were the answer,

391
0:15:09.739,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and small schools definitely help.

392
0:15:11.209,000 --> 0:15:12,000
They bring down the dropout rate.

393
0:15:12.733,000 --> 0:15:14,000
They have less violence and crime in those schools.

394
0:15:15.333,000 --> 0:15:17,000
But the thing that we learned from that work,

395
0:15:17.479,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and what turned out to be the fundamental key,

396
0:15:20.013,000 --> 0:15:22,000
is a great teacher in front of the classroom.

397
0:15:22.077,000 --> 0:15:23,000
If you don't have an effective teacher

398
0:15:23.684,000 --> 0:15:24,000
in the front of the classroom,

399
0:15:24.75,000 --> 0:15:26,000
I don't care how big or small the building is,

400
0:15:26.906,000 --> 0:15:27,000
you're not going to change the trajectory

401
0:15:28.56,000 --> 0:15:29,000
of whether that student will be ready for college.

402
0:15:30.513,000 --> 0:15:34,000
(Applause)

403
0:15:35.108,000 --> 0:15:37,000
CA: So Melinda, this is you and

404
0:15:37.418,000 --> 0:15:4,000
your eldest daughter, Jenn.

405
0:15:40.972,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And just taken about three weeks ago, I think,

406
0:15:42.871,000 --> 0:15:43,000
three or four weeks ago. Where was this?

407
0:15:44.455,000 --> 0:15:45,000
MG: So we went to Tanzania.

408
0:15:46.211,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Jenn's been to Tanzania.

409
0:15:47.053,000 --> 0:15:49,000
All our kids have been to Africa quite a bit, actually.

410
0:15:49.756,000 --> 0:15:51,000
And we did something very different,

411
0:15:51.971,000 --> 0:15:52,000
which is, we decided to go spend

412
0:15:53.798,000 --> 0:15:55,000
two nights and three days with a family.

413
0:15:56.217,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Anna and Sanare are the parents.

414
0:15:59.318,000 --> 0:16:02,000
They invited us to come and stay in their boma.

415
0:16:02.352,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Actually, the goats had been there, I think,

416
0:16:03.851,000 --> 0:16:04,000
living in that particular little hut

417
0:16:05.25,000 --> 0:16:07,000
on their little compound before we got there.

418
0:16:07.921,000 --> 0:16:08,000
And we stayed with their family,

419
0:16:09.419,000 --> 0:16:1,000
and we really, really learned

420
0:16:11.353,000 --> 0:16:12,000
what life is like in rural Tanzania.

421
0:16:13.206,000 --> 0:16:14,000
And the difference between just going

422
0:16:14.82,000 --> 0:16:15,000
and visiting for half a day

423
0:16:16.539,000 --> 0:16:17,000
or three quarters of a day

424
0:16:18.001,000 --> 0:16:2,000
versus staying overnight was profound,

425
0:16:20.399,000 --> 0:16:23,000
and so let me just give you one explanation of that.

426
0:16:23.89,000 --> 0:16:25,000
They had six children, and as I talked to Anna

427
0:16:26.019,000 --> 0:16:27,000
in the kitchen, we cooked for about five hours

428
0:16:27.794,000 --> 0:16:28,000
in the cooking hut that day,

429
0:16:29.437,000 --> 0:16:3,000
and as I talked to her, she had absolutely planned

430
0:16:31.248,000 --> 0:16:32,000
and spaced with her husband

431
0:16:32.718,000 --> 0:16:33,000
the births of their children.

432
0:16:34.155,000 --> 0:16:35,000
It was a very loving relationship.

433
0:16:35.81,000 --> 0:16:37,000
This was a Maasai warrior and his wife,

434
0:16:38.113,000 --> 0:16:39,000
but they had decided to get married,

435
0:16:40.022,000 --> 0:16:43,000
they clearly had respect and love in the relationship.

436
0:16:43.357,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Their children, their six children,

437
0:16:44.968,000 --> 0:16:46,000
the two in the middle were twins, 13,

438
0:16:47.487,000 --> 0:16:49,000
a boy, and a girl named Grace.

439
0:16:49.74,000 --> 0:16:5,000
And when we'd go out to chop wood

440
0:16:51.313,000 --> 0:16:53,000
and do all the things that Grace and her mother would do,

441
0:16:53.748,000 --> 0:16:55,000
Grace was not a child, she was an adolescent,

442
0:16:56.34,000 --> 0:16:57,000
but she wasn't an adult.

443
0:16:57.817,000 --> 0:16:58,000
She was very, very shy.

444
0:16:59.568,000 --> 0:17:,000
So she kept wanting to talk to me and Jenn.

445
0:17:01.329,000 --> 0:17:03,000
We kept trying to engage her, but she was shy.

446
0:17:04.164,000 --> 0:17:05,000
And at night, though,

447
0:17:05.77,000 --> 0:17:07,000
when all the lights went out in rural Tanzania,

448
0:17:08.577,000 --> 0:17:09,000
and there was no moon that night,

449
0:17:10.081,000 --> 0:17:11,000
the first night, and no stars,

450
0:17:11.803,000 --> 0:17:12,000
and Jenn came out of our hut

451
0:17:13.629,000 --> 0:17:15,000
with her REI little headlamp on,

452
0:17:16.446,000 --> 0:17:18,000
Grace went immediately,

453
0:17:18.584,000 --> 0:17:19,000
and got the translator,

454
0:17:19.94,000 --> 0:17:21,000
came straight up to my Jenn and said,

455
0:17:22.03,000 --> 0:17:23,000
"When you go home,

456
0:17:23.263,000 --> 0:17:24,000
can I have your headlamp

457
0:17:24.438,000 --> 0:17:25,000
so I can study at night?"

458
0:17:26.168,000 --> 0:17:27,000
CA: Oh, wow.

459
0:17:27.25,000 --> 0:17:28,000
MG: And her dad had told me

460
0:17:28.734,000 --> 0:17:3,000
how afraid he was that unlike the son,

461
0:17:30.821,000 --> 0:17:31,000
who had passed his secondary exams,

462
0:17:32.483,000 --> 0:17:33,000
because of her chores,

463
0:17:34.013,000 --> 0:17:35,000
she'd not done so well

464
0:17:35.451,000 --> 0:17:36,000
and wasn't in the government school yet.

465
0:17:37.255,000 --> 0:17:39,000
He said, "I don't know how I'm going to pay for her education.

466
0:17:39.79,000 --> 0:17:4,000
I can't pay for private school,

467
0:17:41.616,000 --> 0:17:43,000
and she may end up on this farm like my wife."

468
0:17:44.195,000 --> 0:17:45,000
So they know the difference

469
0:17:45.324,000 --> 0:17:46,000
that an education can make

470
0:17:46.349,000 --> 0:17:48,000
in a huge, profound way.

471
0:17:49.346,000 --> 0:17:5,000
CA: I mean, this is another pic

472
0:17:50.767,000 --> 0:17:53,000
of your other two kids, Rory and Phoebe,

473
0:17:54.173,000 --> 0:17:58,000
along with Paul Farmer.

474
0:17:58.311,000 --> 0:17:59,000
Bringing up three children

475
0:17:59.925,000 --> 0:18:02,000
when you're the world's richest family

476
0:18:02.927,000 --> 0:18:04,000
seems like a social experiment

477
0:18:05.223,000 --> 0:18:08,000
without much prior art.

478
0:18:08.795,000 --> 0:18:09,000
How have you managed it?

479
0:18:10.33,000 --> 0:18:12,000
What's been your approach?

480
0:18:12.545,000 --> 0:18:14,000
BG: Well, I'd say overall

481
0:18:15.178,000 --> 0:18:16,000
the kids get a great education,

482
0:18:16.94,000 --> 0:18:16,000
but you've got to make sure

483
0:18:17.838,000 --> 0:18:18,000
they have a sense of their own ability

484
0:18:19.54,000 --> 0:18:2,000
and what they're going to go and do,

485
0:18:21.529,000 --> 0:18:23,000
and our philosophy has been

486
0:18:23.902,000 --> 0:18:24,000
to be very clear with them --

487
0:18:25.124,000 --> 0:18:26,000
most of the money's going to the foundation --

488
0:18:26.669,000 --> 0:18:3,000
and help them find something they're excited about.

489
0:18:31.01,000 --> 0:18:32,000
We want to strike a balance where they have

490
0:18:32.405,000 --> 0:18:33,000
the freedom to do anything

491
0:18:34.198,000 --> 0:18:37,000
but not a lot of money showered on them

492
0:18:37.538,000 --> 0:18:4,000
so they could go out and do nothing.

493
0:18:40.667,000 --> 0:18:42,000
And so far, they're fairly diligent,

494
0:18:43.645,000 --> 0:18:46,000
excited to pick their own direction.

495
0:18:46.853,000 --> 0:18:51,000
CA: You've obviously guarded their privacy carefully for obvious reasons.

496
0:18:52.421,000 --> 0:18:54,000
I'm curious why you've given me permission

497
0:18:54.615,000 --> 0:18:55,000
to show this picture now here at TED.

498
0:18:56.24,000 --> 0:18:57,000
MG: Well, it's interesting.

499
0:18:57.377,000 --> 0:18:58,000
As they get older, they so know

500
0:18:59.218,000 --> 0:19:02,000
that our family belief is about responsibility,

501
0:19:02.227,000 --> 0:19:04,000
that we are in an unbelievable situation

502
0:19:04.342,000 --> 0:19:05,000
just to live in the United States

503
0:19:05.96,000 --> 0:19:06,000
and have a great education,

504
0:19:07.651,000 --> 0:19:09,000
and we have a responsibility to give back to the world.

505
0:19:09.699,000 --> 0:19:1,000
And so as they get older

506
0:19:10.752,000 --> 0:19:11,000
and we are teaching them --

507
0:19:11.772,000 --> 0:19:13,000
they have been to so many countries around the world —

508
0:19:14.132,000 --> 0:19:15,000
they're saying,

509
0:19:15.264,000 --> 0:19:16,000
we do want people to know that we believe

510
0:19:17.016,000 --> 0:19:18,000
in what you're doing, Mom and Dad,

511
0:19:18.517,000 --> 0:19:19,000
and it is okay to show us more.

512
0:19:20.478,000 --> 0:19:22,000
So we have their permission to show this picture,

513
0:19:23.13,000 --> 0:19:24,000
and I think Paul Farmer is probably going to put it

514
0:19:24.845,000 --> 0:19:26,000
eventually in some of his work.

515
0:19:27.3,000 --> 0:19:28,000
But they really care deeply

516
0:19:28.902,000 --> 0:19:3,000
about the mission of the foundation, too.

517
0:19:31.327,000 --> 0:19:32,000
CA: You've easily got enough money

518
0:19:33.249,000 --> 0:19:35,000
despite your vast contributions to the foundation

519
0:19:35.84,000 --> 0:19:36,000
to make them all billionaires.

520
0:19:37.474,000 --> 0:19:38,000
Is that your plan for them?

521
0:19:38.991,000 --> 0:19:4,000
BG: Nope. No. They won't have anything like that.

522
0:19:41.327,000 --> 0:19:42,000
They need to have a sense

523
0:19:43.262,000 --> 0:19:49,000
that their own work is meaningful and important.

524
0:19:49.798,000 --> 0:19:52,000
We read an article long, actually, before we got married,

525
0:19:53.27,000 --> 0:19:55,000
where Warren Buffett talked about that,

526
0:19:55.915,000 --> 0:19:57,000
and we're quite convinced that it wasn't a favor

527
0:19:58.164,000 --> 0:20:01,000
either to society or to the kids.

528
0:20:01.418,000 --> 0:20:03,000
CA: Well, speaking of Warren Buffett,

529
0:20:03.486,000 --> 0:20:05,000
something really amazing happened in 2006,

530
0:20:06.15,000 --> 0:20:08,000
when somehow your only real rival

531
0:20:09.11,000 --> 0:20:1,000
for richest person in America

532
0:20:10.662,000 --> 0:20:11,000
suddenly turned around and agreed to give

533
0:20:12.032,000 --> 0:20:14,000
80 percent of his fortune

534
0:20:14.625,000 --> 0:20:15,000
to your foundation.

535
0:20:16.342,000 --> 0:20:17,000
How on Earth did that happen?

536
0:20:18.078,000 --> 0:20:19,000
I guess there's a long version and a short version of that.

537
0:20:20.056,000 --> 0:20:21,000
We've got time for the short version.

538
0:20:21.438,000 --> 0:20:24,000
BG: All right. Well, Warren was a close friend,

539
0:20:25.193,000 --> 0:20:29,000
and he was going to have his wife Suzie

540
0:20:29.85,000 --> 0:20:3,000
give it all away.

541
0:20:31.405,000 --> 0:20:34,000
Tragically, she passed away before he did,

542
0:20:34.846,000 --> 0:20:37,000
and he's big on delegation, and

543
0:20:38.444,000 --> 0:20:4,000
— (Laughter) —

544
0:20:40.602,000 --> 0:20:41,000
he said —

545
0:20:42.013,000 --> 0:20:42,000
CA: Tweet that.

546
0:20:42.868,000 --> 0:20:45,000
BG: If he's got somebody who is doing something well,

547
0:20:46.029,000 --> 0:20:5,000
and is willing to do it at no charge,

548
0:20:50.486,000 --> 0:20:52,000
maybe that's okay. But we were stunned.

549
0:20:52.864,000 --> 0:20:54,000
MG: Totally stunned. BG: We had never expected it,

550
0:20:54.96,000 --> 0:20:55,000
and it has been unbelievable.

551
0:20:56.525,000 --> 0:20:59,000
It's allowed us to increase our ambition

552
0:20:59.665,000 --> 0:21:02,000
in what the foundation can do quite dramatically.

553
0:21:03.282,000 --> 0:21:04,000
Half the resources we have

554
0:21:04.786,000 --> 0:21:06,000
come from Warren's mind-blowing generosity.

555
0:21:07.67,000 --> 0:21:07,000
CA: And I think you've pledged that

556
0:21:08.554,000 --> 0:21:09,000
by the time you're done,

557
0:21:10.344,000 --> 0:21:11,000
more than, or 95 percent of your wealth,

558
0:21:12.222,000 --> 0:21:13,000
will be given to the foundation.

559
0:21:14.117,000 --> 0:21:15,000
BG: Yes.

560
0:21:15.271,000 --> 0:21:18,000
CA: And since this relationship, it's amazing—

561
0:21:19.02,000 --> 0:21:22,000
(Applause)

562
0:21:22.386,000 --> 0:21:24,000
And recently, you and Warren

563
0:21:25.023,000 --> 0:21:26,000
have been going around trying to persuade

564
0:21:26.903,000 --> 0:21:27,000
other billionaires and successful people

565
0:21:28.879,000 --> 0:21:29,000
to pledge to give, what,

566
0:21:30.402,000 --> 0:21:35,000
more than half of their assets for philanthropy.

567
0:21:36.16,000 --> 0:21:38,000
How is that going?

568
0:21:38.575,000 --> 0:21:41,000
BG: Well, we've got about 120 people

569
0:21:41.747,000 --> 0:21:43,000
who have now taken this giving pledge.

570
0:21:44.185,000 --> 0:21:46,000
The thing that's great is that we get together

571
0:21:46.791,000 --> 0:21:48,000
yearly and talk about, okay,

572
0:21:48.9,000 --> 0:21:49,000
do you hire staff, what do you give to them?

573
0:21:50.865,000 --> 0:21:51,000
We're not trying to homogenize it.

574
0:21:52.092,000 --> 0:21:53,000
I mean, the beauty of philanthropy

575
0:21:53.14,000 --> 0:21:55,000
is this mind-blowing diversity.

576
0:21:55.147,000 --> 0:21:56,000
People give to some things.

577
0:21:56.31,000 --> 0:21:58,000
We look and go, "Wow."

578
0:21:58.989,000 --> 0:21:59,000
But that's great.

579
0:22:00.097,000 --> 0:22:01,000
That's the role of philanthropy

580
0:22:01.226,000 --> 0:22:03,000
is to pick different approaches,

581
0:22:03.713,000 --> 0:22:04,000
including even in one space, like education.

582
0:22:05.705,000 --> 0:22:07,000
We need more experimentation.

583
0:22:08.076,000 --> 0:22:1,000
But it's been wonderful, meeting those people,

584
0:22:10.98,000 --> 0:22:12,000
sharing their journey to philanthropy,

585
0:22:13.212,000 --> 0:22:14,000
how they involve their kids,

586
0:22:14.316,000 --> 0:22:15,000
where they're doing it differently,

587
0:22:16.15,000 --> 0:22:18,000
and it's been way more successful than we expected.

588
0:22:18.856,000 --> 0:22:2,000
Now it looks like it'll just keep growing in size

589
0:22:21.551,000 --> 0:22:23,000
in the years ahead.

590
0:22:24.114,000 --> 0:22:27,000
MG: And having people see that other people

591
0:22:27.626,000 --> 0:22:28,000
are making change with philanthropy,

592
0:22:29.33,000 --> 0:22:31,000
I mean, these are people who have

593
0:22:31.666,000 --> 0:22:32,000
created their own businesses,

594
0:22:32.711,000 --> 0:22:34,000
put their own ingenuity behind incredible ideas.

595
0:22:35.359,000 --> 0:22:37,000
If they put their ideas and their brain

596
0:22:37.585,000 --> 0:22:39,000
behind philanthropy, they can change the world.

597
0:22:40.118,000 --> 0:22:42,000
And they start to see others doing it, and saying,

598
0:22:42.409,000 --> 0:22:44,000
"Wow, I want to do that with my own money."

599
0:22:44.449,000 --> 0:22:46,000
To me, that's the piece that's incredible.

600
0:22:46.493,000 --> 0:22:48,000
CA: It seems to me, it's actually really hard

601
0:22:49.411,000 --> 0:22:5,000
for some people to figure out

602
0:22:50.657,000 --> 0:22:52,000
even how to remotely spend that much money

603
0:22:53.34,000 --> 0:22:55,000
on something else.

604
0:22:55.513,000 --> 0:22:57,000
There are probably some billionaires in the room

605
0:22:57.606,000 --> 0:22:59,000
and certainly some successful people.

606
0:22:59.715,000 --> 0:23:01,000
I'm curious, can you make the pitch?

607
0:23:01.775,000 --> 0:23:02,000
What's the pitch?

608
0:23:03.009,000 --> 0:23:04,000
BG: Well, it's the most fulfilling thing

609
0:23:04.39,000 --> 0:23:05,000
we've ever done,

610
0:23:05.872,000 --> 0:23:07,000
and you can't take it with you,

611
0:23:08.842,000 --> 0:23:11,000
and if it's not good for your kids,

612
0:23:12.024,000 --> 0:23:13,000
let's get together and brainstorm

613
0:23:13.313,000 --> 0:23:15,000
about what we can be done.

614
0:23:16,000 --> 0:23:18,000
The world is a far better place

615
0:23:18.19,000 --> 0:23:2,000
because of the philanthropists of the past,

616
0:23:20.828,000 --> 0:23:23,000
and the U.S. tradition here, which is the strongest,

617
0:23:23.861,000 --> 0:23:24,000
is the envy of the world.

618
0:23:25.212,000 --> 0:23:26,000
And part of the reason I'm so optimistic

619
0:23:27.13,000 --> 0:23:28,000
is because I do think philanthropy

620
0:23:29.074,000 --> 0:23:3,000
is going to grow

621
0:23:30.688,000 --> 0:23:31,000
and take some of these things

622
0:23:31.807,000 --> 0:23:33,000
government's not just good at working on and discovering

623
0:23:34.706,000 --> 0:23:37,000
and shine some light in the right direction.

624
0:23:38.176,000 --> 0:23:4,000
CA: The world's got this terrible inequality,

625
0:23:41.118,000 --> 0:23:42,000
growing inequality problem

626
0:23:42.279,000 --> 0:23:43,000
that seems structural.

627
0:23:43.74,000 --> 0:23:45,000
It does seem to me that if more of your peers

628
0:23:46.606,000 --> 0:23:48,000
took the approach that you two have made,

629
0:23:48.982,000 --> 0:23:49,000
it would make a dent

630
0:23:50.574,000 --> 0:23:51,000
both in that problem and certainly

631
0:23:51.84,000 --> 0:23:52,000
in the perception of that problem.

632
0:23:53.44,000 --> 0:23:54,000
Is that a fair comment?

633
0:23:54.844,000 --> 0:23:55,000
BG: Oh yeah. If you take from the most wealthy

634
0:23:56.502,000 --> 0:23:59,000
and give to the least wealthy, it's good.

635
0:23:59.834,000 --> 0:24:01,000
It tries to balance out, and that's just.

636
0:24:01.966,000 --> 0:24:02,000
MG: But you change systems.

637
0:24:03.722,000 --> 0:24:05,000
In the U.S., we're trying to change the education system

638
0:24:06.335,000 --> 0:24:08,000
so it's just for everybody

639
0:24:08.403,000 --> 0:24:09,000
and it works for all students.

640
0:24:09.96,000 --> 0:24:1,000
That, to me, really changes

641
0:24:11.85,000 --> 0:24:12,000
the inequality balance.

642
0:24:13.007,000 --> 0:24:14,000
BG: That's the most important.

643
0:24:14.589,000 --> 0:24:17,000
(Applause)

644
0:24:18.137,000 --> 0:24:21,000
CA: Well, I really think that most people here

645
0:24:21.552,000 --> 0:24:22,000
and many millions around the world

646
0:24:23.297,000 --> 0:24:25,000
are just in awe of the trajectory

647
0:24:25.846,000 --> 0:24:26,000
your lives have taken

648
0:24:27.154,000 --> 0:24:3,000
and the spectacular degree to which

649
0:24:30.885,000 --> 0:24:32,000
you have shaped the future.

650
0:24:33,000 --> 0:24:34,000
Thank you so much for coming to TED

651
0:24:34.34,000 --> 0:24:35,000
and for sharing with us and for all you do.

652
0:24:35.801,000 --> 0:24:36,000
BG: Thank you. MG: Thank you.

653
0:24:37.737,000 --> 0:24:39,000
(Applause)

654
0:24:46.515,000 --> 0:24:5,000
BG: Thank you. MG: Thank you very much.

655
0:24:50.91,000 --> 0:24:54,000
BG: All right, good job. (Applause)

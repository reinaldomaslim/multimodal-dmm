0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
My talk is "Flapping Birds and Space Telescopes."

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And you would think that should have nothing to do with one another,

3
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
but I hope by the end of these 18 minutes,

4
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
you'll see a little bit of a relation.

5
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
It ties to origami. So let me start.

6
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
What is origami?

7
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Most people think they know what origami is. It's this:

8
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
flapping birds, toys, cootie catchers, that sort of thing.

9
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And that is what origami used to be.

10
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
But it's become something else.

11
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
It's become an art form, a form of sculpture.

12
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
The common theme -- what makes it origami --

13
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
is folding is how we create the form.

14
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
You know, it's very old. This is a plate from 1797.

15
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It shows these women playing with these toys.

16
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
If you look close, it's this shape, called a crane.

17
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
Every Japanese kid

18
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
learns how to fold that crane.

19
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
So this art has been around for hundreds of years,

20
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and you would think something

21
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that's been around that long -- so restrictive, folding only --

22
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
everything that could be done has been done a long time ago.

23
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And that might have been the case.

24
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
But in the twentieth century,

25
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
a Japanese folder named Yoshizawa came along,

26
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and he created tens of thousands of new designs.

27
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
But even more importantly, he created a language,

28
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
a way we could communicate,

29
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
a code of dots, dashes and arrows.

30
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Harkening back to Susan Blackmore's talk,

31
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
we now have a means of transmitting information

32
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
with heredity and selection,

33
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and we know where that leads.

34
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And where it has led in origami

35
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
is to things like this.

36
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
This is an origami figure --

37
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
one sheet, no cuts, folding only, hundreds of folds.

38
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
This, too, is origami,

39
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and this shows where we've gone in the modern world.

40
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Naturalism. Detail.

41
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
You can get horns, antlers --

42
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
even, if you look close, cloven hooves.

43
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And it raises a question: what changed?

44
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And what changed is something

45
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
you might not have expected in an art,

46
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
which is math.

47
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
That is, people applied mathematical principles

48
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to the art,

49
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
to discover the underlying laws.

50
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And that leads to a very powerful tool.

51
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
The secret to productivity in so many fields --

52
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and in origami --

53
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
is letting dead people do your work for you.

54
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Because what you can do is

56
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
take your problem,

57
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and turn it into a problem that someone else has solved,

58
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and use their solutions.

59
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And I want to tell you how we did that in origami.

60
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Origami revolves around crease patterns.

61
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
The crease pattern shown here is the underlying blueprint

62
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
for an origami figure.

63
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And you can't just draw them arbitrarily.

64
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
They have to obey four simple laws.

65
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And they're very simple, easy to understand.

66
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
The first law is two-colorability. You can color any crease pattern

67
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
with just two colors without ever having

68
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
the same color meeting.

69
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
The directions of the folds at any vertex --

70
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
the number of mountain folds, the number of valley folds --

71
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
always differs by two. Two more or two less.

72
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Nothing else.

73
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
If you look at the angles around the fold,

74
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
you find that if you number the angles in a circle,

75
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
all the even-numbered angles add up to a straight line,

76
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
all the odd-numbered angles add up to a straight line.

77
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And if you look at how the layers stack,

78
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
you'll find that no matter how you stack folds and sheets,

79
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
a sheet can never

80
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
penetrate a fold.

81
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So that's four simple laws. That's all you need in origami.

82
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
All of origami comes from that.

83
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And you'd think, "Can four simple laws

84
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
give rise to that kind of complexity?"

85
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
But indeed, the laws of quantum mechanics

86
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
can be written down on a napkin,

87
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and yet they govern all of chemistry,

88
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
all of life, all of history.

89
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
If we obey these laws,

90
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
we can do amazing things.

91
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So in origami, to obey these laws,

92
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
we can take simple patterns --

93
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
like this repeating pattern of folds, called textures --

94
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and by itself it's nothing.

95
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But if we follow the laws of origami,

96
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
we can put these patterns into another fold

97
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that itself might be something very, very simple,

98
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
but when we put it together,

99
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
we get something a little different.

100
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
This fish, 400 scales --

101
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
again, it is one uncut square, only folding.

102
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And if you don't want to fold 400 scales,

103
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
you can back off and just do a few things,

104
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and add plates to the back of a turtle, or toes.

105
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Or you can ramp up and go up to 50 stars

106
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:33,000
on a flag, with 13 stripes.

107
0:04:33.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And if you want to go really crazy,

108
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
1,000 scales on a rattlesnake.

109
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And this guy's on display downstairs,

110
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
so take a look if you get a chance.

111
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
The most powerful tools in origami

112
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
have related to how we get parts of creatures.

113
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And I can put it in this simple equation.

114
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
We take an idea,

115
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
combine it with a square, and you get an origami figure.

116
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Laughter)

117
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
What matters is what we mean by those symbols.

118
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And you might say, "Can you really be that specific?

119
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I mean, a stag beetle -- it's got two points for jaws,

120
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
it's got antennae. Can you be that specific in the detail?"

121
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And yeah, you really can.

122
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
So how do we do that? Well, we break it down

123
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
into a few smaller steps.

124
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So let me stretch out that equation.

125
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I start with my idea. I abstract it.

126
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
What's the most abstract form? It's a stick figure.

127
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And from that stick figure, I somehow have to get to a folded shape

128
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that has a part for every bit of the subject,

129
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
a flap for every leg.

130
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And then once I have that folded shape that we call the base,

131
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
you can make the legs narrower, you can bend them,

132
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
you can turn it into the finished shape.

133
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Now the first step, pretty easy.

134
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Take an idea, draw a stick figure.

135
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
The last step is not so hard, but that middle step --

136
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
going from the abstract description to the folded shape --

137
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
that's hard.

138
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
But that's the place where the mathematical ideas

139
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
can get us over the hump.

140
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
And I'm going to show you all how to do that

141
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
so you can go out of here and fold something.

142
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
But we're going to start small.

143
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
This base has a lot of flaps in it.

144
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
We're going to learn how to make one flap.

145
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
How would you make a single flap?

146
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Take a square. Fold it in half, fold it in half, fold it again,

147
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
until it gets long and narrow,

148
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and then we'll say at the end of that, that's a flap.

149
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I could use that for a leg, an arm, anything like that.

150
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
What paper went into that flap?

151
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Well, if I unfold it and go back to the crease pattern,

152
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
you can see that the upper left corner of that shape

153
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
is the paper that went into the flap.

154
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
So that's the flap, and all the rest of the paper's left over.

155
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I can use it for something else.

156
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Well, there are other ways of making a flap.

157
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
There are other dimensions for flaps.

158
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
If I make the flaps skinnier, I can use a bit less paper.

159
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
If I make the flap as skinny as possible,

160
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I get to the limit of the minimum amount of paper needed.

161
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And you can see there, it needs a quarter-circle of paper to make a flap.

162
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
There's other ways of making flaps.

163
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
If I put the flap on the edge, it uses a half circle of paper.

164
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
And if I make the flap from the middle, it uses a full circle.

165
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So, no matter how I make a flap,

166
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
it needs some part

167
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
of a circular region of paper.

168
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So now we're ready to scale up.

169
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
What if I want to make something that has a lot of flaps?

170
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
What do I need? I need a lot of circles.

171
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And in the 1990s,

172
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
origami artists discovered these principles

173
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and realized we could make arbitrarily complicated figures

174
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
just by packing circles.

175
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And here's where the dead people start to help us out,

176
0:07:28.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
because lots of people have studied

177
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
the problem of packing circles.

178
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I can rely on that vast history of mathematicians and artists

179
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
looking at disc packings and arrangements.

180
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And I can use those patterns now to create origami shapes.

181
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles,

182
0:07:45.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
you decorate the patterns of circles with lines

183
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
according to more rules. That gives you the folds.

184
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Those folds fold into a base. You shape the base.

185
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
You get a folded shape -- in this case, a cockroach.

186
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And it's so simple.

187
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
(Laughter)

188
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
It's so simple that a computer could do it.

189
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And you say, "Well, you know, how simple is that?"

190
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
But computers -- you need to be able to describe things

191
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
in very basic terms, and with this, we could.

192
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
So I wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago

193
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
called TreeMaker, and you can download it from my website.

194
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
It's free. It runs on all the major platforms -- even Windows.

195
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
(Laughter)

196
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And you just draw a stick figure,

197
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and it calculates the crease pattern.

198
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:28,000
It does the circle packing, calculates the crease pattern,

199
0:08:28.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and if you use that stick figure that I just showed --

200
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
which you can kind of tell, it's a deer, it's got antlers --

201
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
you'll get this crease pattern.

202
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And if you take this crease pattern, you fold on the dotted lines,

203
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
you'll get a base that you can then shape

204
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
into a deer,

205
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
with exactly the crease pattern that you wanted.

206
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And if you want a different deer,

207
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
not a white-tailed deer, but you want a mule deer, or an elk,

208
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
you change the packing,

209
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and you can do an elk.

210
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Or you could do a moose.

211
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Or, really, any other kind of deer.

212
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
These techniques revolutionized this art.

213
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
We found we could do insects,

214
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
spiders, which are close,

215
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
things with legs, things with legs and wings,

216
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
things with legs and antennae.

217
0:09:10.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And if folding a single praying mantis from a single uncut square

218
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
wasn't interesting enough,

219
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
then you could do two praying mantises

220
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
from a single uncut square.

221
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
She's eating him.

222
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I call it "Snack Time."

223
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And you can do more than just insects.

224
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
This -- you can put details,

225
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:31,000
toes and claws. A grizzly bear has claws.

226
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
This tree frog has toes.

227
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Actually, lots of people in origami now put toes into their models.

228
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Toes have become an origami meme,

229
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
because everyone's doing it.

230
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:43,000
You can make multiple subjects.

231
0:09:43.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
So these are a couple of instrumentalists.

232
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
The guitar player from a single square,

233
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
the bass player from a single square.

234
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And if you say, "Well, but the guitar, bass --

235
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
that's not so hot.

236
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Do a little more complicated instrument."

237
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Well, then you could do an organ.

238
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
(Laughter)

239
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And what this has allowed is the creation

240
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
of origami-on-demand.

241
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
So now people can say, "I want exactly this and this and this,"

242
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and you can go out and fold it.

243
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And sometimes you create high art,

244
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work.

245
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
But I want to show you some examples.

246
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Everything you'll see here,

247
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
except the car, is origami.

248
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
(Video)

249
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
(Applause)

250
0:10:54.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Just to show you, this really was folded paper.

251
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Computers made things move,

252
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
but these were all real, folded objects that we made.

253
0:11:03.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And we can use this not just for visuals,

254
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
but it turns out to be useful even in the real world.

255
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Surprisingly, origami

256
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and the structures that we've developed in origami

257
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
turn out to have applications in medicine, in science,

258
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
in space, in the body, consumer electronics and more.

259
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And I want to show you some of these examples.

260
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
One of the earliest was this pattern,

261
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
this folded pattern,

262
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
studied by Koryo Miura, a Japanese engineer.

263
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
He studied a folding pattern, and realized

264
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
this could fold down into an extremely compact package

265
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
that had a very simple opening and closing structure.

266
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And he used it to design this solar array.

267
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
It's an artist's rendition, but it flew in a Japanese telescope

268
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
in 1995.

269
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Now, there is actually a little origami

270
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:5,000
in the James Webb Space Telescope, but it's very simple.

271
0:11:50.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
The telescope, going up in space,

272
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
it unfolds in two places.

273
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
It folds in thirds. It's a very simple pattern --

274
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:11:59,000
you wouldn't even call that origami.

275
0:11:59.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
They certainly didn't need to talk to origami artists.

276
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
But if you want to go higher and go larger than this,

277
0:12:05.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
then you might need some origami.

278
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Engineers at Lawrence Livermore National Lab

279
0:12:09.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
had an idea for a telescope much larger.

280
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
They called it the Eyeglass.

281
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
The design called for geosynchronous orbit

282
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:18,000
25,000 miles up,

283
0:12:18.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
100-meter diameter lens.

284
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
So, imagine a lens the size of a football field.

285
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
There were two groups of people who were interested in this:

286
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
planetary scientists, who want to look up,

287
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and then other people, who wanted to look down.

288
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Whether you look up or look down,

289
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
how do you get it up in space? You've got to get it up there in a rocket.

290
0:12:38.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And rockets are small. So you have to make it smaller.

291
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
How do you make a large sheet of glass smaller?

292
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Well, about the only way is to fold it up somehow.

293
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
So you have to do something like this.

294
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
This was a small model.

295
0:12:51.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Folded lens, you divide up the panels, you add flexures.

296
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
But this pattern's not going to work

297
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
to get something 100 meters down to a few meters.

298
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:01,000
So the Livermore engineers,

299
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
wanting to make use of the work of dead people,

300
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
or perhaps live origamists, said,

301
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
"Let's see if someone else is doing this sort of thing."

302
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:12,000
So they looked into the origami community,

303
0:13:12.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
we got in touch with them, and I started working with them.

304
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And we developed a pattern together

305
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
that scales to arbitrarily large size,

306
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:22,000
but that allows any flat ring or disc

307
0:13:22.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
to fold down into a very neat, compact cylinder.

308
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And they adopted that for their first generation,

309
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
which was not 100 meters -- it was a five-meter.

310
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
But this is a five-meter telescope --

311
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
has about a quarter-mile focal length.

312
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And it works perfectly on its test range,

313
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and it indeed folds up into a neat little bundle.

314
0:13:39.33,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Now, there is other origami in space.

315
0:13:41.33,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Japan Aerospace [Exploration] Agency flew a solar sail,

316
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and you can see here that the sail expands out,

317
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and you can still see the fold lines.

318
0:13:49.33,000 --> 0:13:52,000
The problem that's being solved here is

319
0:13:52.33,000 --> 0:13:55,000
something that needs to be big and sheet-like at its destination,

320
0:13:55.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
but needs to be small for the journey.

321
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
And that works whether you're going into space,

322
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
or whether you're just going into a body.

323
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:05,000
And this example is the latter.

324
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:08,000
This is a heart stent developed by Zhong You

325
0:14:08.33,000 --> 0:14:1,000
at Oxford University.

326
0:14:10.33,000 --> 0:14:13,000
It holds open a blocked artery when it gets to its destination,

327
0:14:13.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
but it needs to be much smaller for the trip there,

328
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
through your blood vessels.

329
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And this stent folds down using an origami pattern,

330
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
based on a model called the water bomb base.

331
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Airbag designers also have the problem

332
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:29,000
of getting flat sheets

333
0:14:29.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
into a small space.

334
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
And they want to do their design by simulation.

335
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
So they need to figure out how, in a computer,

336
0:14:36.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
to flatten an airbag.

337
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
And the algorithms that we developed

338
0:14:40.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
to do insects

339
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
turned out to be the solution for airbags

340
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:47,000
to do their simulation.

341
0:14:47.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And so they can do a simulation like this.

342
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Those are the origami creases forming,

343
0:14:52.33,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and now you can see the airbag inflate

344
0:14:54.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and find out, does it work?

345
0:14:57.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
And that leads

346
0:14:59.33,000 --> 0:15:01,000
to a really interesting idea.

347
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:04,000
You know, where did these things come from?

348
0:15:04.33,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Well, the heart stent

349
0:15:06.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
came from that little blow-up box

350
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:11,000
that you might have learned in elementary school.

351
0:15:11.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
It's the same pattern, called the water bomb base.

352
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:16,000
The airbag-flattening algorithm

353
0:15:16.33,000 --> 0:15:18,000
came from all the developments

354
0:15:18.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
of circle packing and the mathematical theory

355
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:23,000
that was really developed

356
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:26,000
just to create insects -- things with legs.

357
0:15:27.33,000 --> 0:15:29,000
The thing is, that this often happens

358
0:15:29.33,000 --> 0:15:31,000
in math and science.

359
0:15:31.33,000 --> 0:15:34,000
When you get math involved, problems that you solve

360
0:15:34.33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
for aesthetic value only,

361
0:15:36.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
or to create something beautiful,

362
0:15:38.33,000 --> 0:15:4,000
turn around and turn out

363
0:15:40.33,000 --> 0:15:43,000
to have an application in the real world.

364
0:15:43.33,000 --> 0:15:46,000
And as weird and surprising as it may sound,

365
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:49,000
origami may someday even save a life.

366
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Thanks.

367
0:15:52.33,000 --> 0:15:54,000

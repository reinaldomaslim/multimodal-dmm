2
0:00:15.451,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I live in South Central.

3
0:00:18.924,000 --> 0:00:2,000
This is South Central:

4
0:00:21.067,000 --> 0:00:23,000
liquor stores,

5
0:00:23.937,000 --> 0:00:25,000
fast food,

6
0:00:26.312,000 --> 0:00:28,000
vacant lots.

7
0:00:28.656,000 --> 0:00:29,000
So the city planners, they get together and they figure

8
0:00:30.338,000 --> 0:00:33,000
they're going to change the name South Central to make it represent something else,

9
0:00:33.584,000 --> 0:00:36,000
so they change it to South Los Angeles,

10
0:00:36.752,000 --> 0:00:39,000
like this is going to fix what's really going wrong in the city.

11
0:00:40.634,000 --> 0:00:43,000
This is South Los Angeles. (Laughter)

12
0:00:44.344,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Liquor stores,

13
0:00:46.512,000 --> 0:00:48,000
fast food,

14
0:00:48.824,000 --> 0:00:5,000
vacant lots.

15
0:00:51.465,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Just like 26.5 million other Americans,

16
0:00:54.936,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I live in a food desert,

17
0:00:57.496,000 --> 0:00:59,000
South Central Los Angeles,

18
0:00:59.56,000 --> 0:01:03,000
home of the drive-thru and the drive-by.

19
0:01:03.761,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Funny thing is, the drive-thrus are killing more people than the drive-bys.

20
0:01:09.2,000 --> 0:01:11,000
People are dying from curable diseases

21
0:01:11.701,000 --> 0:01:13,000
in South Central Los Angeles.

22
0:01:14.536,000 --> 0:01:16,000
For instance, the obesity rate in my neighborhood

23
0:01:17.137,000 --> 0:01:2,000
is five times higher than, say, Beverly Hills,

24
0:01:20.404,000 --> 0:01:23,000
which is probably eight, 10 miles away.

25
0:01:24.004,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I got tired of seeing this happening.

26
0:01:27.464,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And I was wondering, how would you feel

27
0:01:29.572,000 --> 0:01:32,000
if you had no access to healthy food,

28
0:01:32.86,000 --> 0:01:34,000
if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects

29
0:01:35.74,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that the present food system has on your neighborhood?

30
0:01:39.4,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I see wheelchairs bought and sold

31
0:01:42.068,000 --> 0:01:44,000
like used cars.

32
0:01:44.137,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I see dialysis centers popping up like Starbucks.

33
0:01:48.161,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And I figured, this has to stop.

34
0:01:51.556,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So I figured that the problem is the solution.

35
0:01:57.382,000 --> 0:02:,000
Food is the problem and food is the solution.

36
0:02:01.106,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Plus I got tired of driving 45 minutes round trip

37
0:02:04.036,000 --> 0:02:08,000
to get an apple that wasn't impregnated with pesticides.

38
0:02:08.244,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So what I did, I planted a food forest in front of my house.

39
0:02:12.796,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It was on a strip of land that we call a parkway.

40
0:02:15.188,000 --> 0:02:18,000
It's 150 feet by 10 feet.

41
0:02:18.572,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Thing is, it's owned by the city.

42
0:02:21.02,000 --> 0:02:23,000
But you have to maintain it.

43
0:02:23.596,000 --> 0:02:27,000
So I'm like, "Cool. I can do whatever the hell I want,

44
0:02:28.108,000 --> 0:02:31,000
since it's my responsibility and I gotta maintain it."

45
0:02:31.951,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And this is how I decided to maintain it.

46
0:02:34.852,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So me and my group, L.A. Green Grounds, we got together

47
0:02:37.838,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and we started planting my food forest, fruit trees,

48
0:02:40.19,000 --> 0:02:42,000
you know, the whole nine, vegetables.

49
0:02:42.3,000 --> 0:02:44,000
What we do, we're a pay-it-forward kind of group,

50
0:02:45.271,000 --> 0:02:49,000
where it's composed of gardeners from all walks of life,

51
0:02:50.11,000 --> 0:02:52,000
from all over the city, and it's completely volunteer,

52
0:02:52.439,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and everything we do is free.

53
0:02:54.271,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And the garden, it was beautiful.

54
0:02:57.373,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And then somebody complained.

55
0:02:59.823,000 --> 0:03:01,000
The city came down on me,

56
0:03:02.199,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and basically gave me a citation saying that I had to remove my garden,

57
0:03:06.511,000 --> 0:03:08,000
which this citation was turning into a warrant.

58
0:03:09.139,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And I'm like, "Come on, really?

59
0:03:11.671,000 --> 0:03:13,000
A warrant for planting food on a piece of land

60
0:03:14.415,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that you could care less about?" (Laughter)

61
0:03:17.827,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And I was like, "Cool. Bring it."

62
0:03:20.167,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Because this time it wasn't coming up.

63
0:03:23.362,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So L.A. Times got ahold of it. Steve Lopez did a story on it

64
0:03:28.374,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and talked to the councilman,

65
0:03:31.491,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and one of the Green Grounds members,

66
0:03:33.087,000 --> 0:03:35,000
they put up a petition on Change.org,

67
0:03:35.905,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and with 900 signatures, we were a success.

68
0:03:38.758,000 --> 0:03:4,000
We had a victory on our hands.

69
0:03:40.834,000 --> 0:03:43,000
My councilman even called in and said how they endorse

70
0:03:44.331,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and love what we're doing.

71
0:03:46.977,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I mean, come on, why wouldn't they?

72
0:03:49.501,000 --> 0:03:53,000
L.A. leads the United States in vacant lots that the city actually owns.

73
0:03:54.346,000 --> 0:03:59,000
They own 26 square miles of vacant lots.

74
0:03:59.704,000 --> 0:04:02,000
That's 20 Central Parks.

75
0:04:02.726,000 --> 0:04:09,000
That's enough space to plant 725 million tomato plants.

76
0:04:10.045,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Why in the hell would they not okay this?

77
0:04:14.998,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Growing one plant will give you 1,000, 10,000 seeds.

78
0:04:19.113,000 --> 0:04:21,000
When one dollar's worth of green beans

79
0:04:21.822,000 --> 0:04:24,000
will give you 75 dollars' worth of produce.

80
0:04:25.38,000 --> 0:04:28,000
It's my gospel, when I'm telling people, grow your own food.

81
0:04:29.057,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Growing your own food is like printing your own money.

82
0:04:32.198,000 --> 0:04:39,000
(Applause)

83
0:04:39.198,000 --> 0:04:41,000
See, I have a legacy in South Central.

84
0:04:42.07,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.

85
0:04:46.799,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And I refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality

86
0:04:51.062,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that was manufactured for me by some other people,

87
0:04:53.926,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and I'm manufacturing my own reality.

88
0:04:56.534,000 --> 0:04:58,000
See, I'm an artist.

89
0:04:59.046,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Gardening is my graffiti. I grow my art.

90
0:05:03.15,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Just like a graffiti artist, where they beautify walls,

91
0:05:07.726,000 --> 0:05:1,000
me, I beautify lawns, parkways.

92
0:05:11.158,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I use the garden, the soil, like it's a piece of cloth,

93
0:05:15.068,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and the plants and the trees,

94
0:05:17.263,000 --> 0:05:2,000
that's my embellishment for that cloth.

95
0:05:20.945,000 --> 0:05:26,000
You'd be surprised what the soil could do

96
0:05:26.986,000 --> 0:05:27,000
if you let it be your canvas.

97
0:05:28.521,000 --> 0:05:31,000
You just couldn't imagine how amazing a sunflower is

98
0:05:32.041,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and how it affects people.

99
0:05:35.049,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So what happened?

100
0:05:37.721,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education,

101
0:05:42.792,000 --> 0:05:45,000
a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood.

102
0:05:45.818,000 --> 0:05:49,000
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil.

103
0:05:50.699,000 --> 0:05:54,000
We are the soil.

104
0:05:55.239,000 --> 0:06:,000
You'd be surprised how kids are affected by this.

105
0:06:00.782,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Gardening is the most therapeutic

106
0:06:05.016,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and defiant act you can do,

107
0:06:07.96,000 --> 0:06:09,000
especially in the inner city.

108
0:06:10.452,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Plus you get strawberries.

109
0:06:13.196,000 --> 0:06:16,000
(Laughter)

110
0:06:16.654,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I remember this time,

111
0:06:19.032,000 --> 0:06:21,000
there was this mother and a daughter came,

112
0:06:21.341,000 --> 0:06:24,000
it was, like, 10:30 at night, and they were in my yard,

113
0:06:24.808,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and I came out and they looked so ashamed.

114
0:06:28.272,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So I'm like, man, it made me feel bad that they were there,

115
0:06:31.96,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and I told them, you know, you don't have to do this like this.

116
0:06:34.696,000 --> 0:06:36,000
This is on the street for a reason.

117
0:06:36.707,000 --> 0:06:39,000
It made me feel ashamed to see people

118
0:06:40.198,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that were this close to me that were hungry,

119
0:06:42.781,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and this only reinforced why I do this,

120
0:06:45.92,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and people asked me, "Fin, aren't you afraid

121
0:06:48.889,000 --> 0:06:49,000
people are going to steal your food?"

122
0:06:50.376,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And I'm like, "Hell no, I ain't afraid they're gonna steal it.

123
0:06:52.577,000 --> 0:06:54,000
That's why it's on the street.

124
0:06:55.17,000 --> 0:06:57,000
That's the whole idea.

125
0:06:57.88,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I want them to take it, but at the same time,

126
0:06:59.675,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I want them to take back their health."

127
0:07:03.678,000 --> 0:07:05,000
There's another time when I put

128
0:07:06.221,000 --> 0:07:11,000
a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown Los Angeles.

129
0:07:11.664,000 --> 0:07:13,000
These are the guys, they helped me unload the truck.

130
0:07:14.615,000 --> 0:07:16,000
It was cool, and they just shared the stories

131
0:07:17.24,000 --> 0:07:19,000
about how this affected them and how

132
0:07:20.096,000 --> 0:07:22,000
they used to plant with their mother and their grandmother,

133
0:07:22.888,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and it was just cool to see how this changed them,

134
0:07:26.314,000 --> 0:07:31,000
if it was only for that one moment.

135
0:07:32.019,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So Green Grounds has gone on to plant

136
0:07:34.882,000 --> 0:07:35,000
maybe 20 gardens.

137
0:07:36.633,000 --> 0:07:4,000
We've had, like, 50 people come to our dig-ins

138
0:07:40.898,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and participate, and it's all volunteers.

139
0:07:43.663,000 --> 0:07:46,000
If kids grow kale, kids eat kale.

140
0:07:47.29,000 --> 0:07:48,000
(Laughter)

141
0:07:48.554,000 --> 0:07:52,000
If they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes. (Applause)

142
0:07:53.53,000 --> 0:07:56,000
But when none of this is presented to them,

143
0:07:56.864,000 --> 0:07:59,000
if they're not shown how food affects the mind and the body,

144
0:08:00.49,000 --> 0:08:04,000
they blindly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them.

145
0:08:05.034,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I see young people

146
0:08:06.939,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and they want to work,

147
0:08:10.05,000 --> 0:08:12,000
but they're in this thing where they're caught up --

148
0:08:12.171,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I see kids of color and they're just on this track

149
0:08:15.778,000 --> 0:08:17,000
that's designed for them,

150
0:08:18.713,000 --> 0:08:2,000
that leads them to nowhere.

151
0:08:20.746,000 --> 0:08:22,000
So with gardening, I see an opportunity

152
0:08:23.421,000 --> 0:08:25,000
where we can train these kids

153
0:08:25.567,000 --> 0:08:27,000
to take over their communities,

154
0:08:28.564,000 --> 0:08:31,000
to have a sustainable life.

155
0:08:32.408,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And when we do this, who knows?

156
0:08:34.527,000 --> 0:08:37,000
We might produce the next George Washington Carver.

157
0:08:37.751,000 --> 0:08:39,000
but if we don't change the composition of the soil,

158
0:08:40.036,000 --> 0:08:41,000
we will never do this.

159
0:08:41.645,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Now this is one of my plans. This is what I want to do.

160
0:08:44.587,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I want to plant a whole block of gardens

161
0:08:48.587,000 --> 0:08:51,000
where people can share in the food in the same block.

162
0:08:51.975,000 --> 0:08:53,000
I want to take shipping containers

163
0:08:54.236,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and turn them into healthy cafes.

164
0:08:56.932,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Now don't get me wrong.

165
0:08:59.324,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I'm not talking about no free shit,

166
0:09:01.602,000 --> 0:09:04,000
because free is not sustainable.

167
0:09:04.955,000 --> 0:09:05,000
The funny thing about sustainability,

168
0:09:06.86,000 --> 0:09:07,000
you have to sustain it.

169
0:09:08.617,000 --> 0:09:12,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

170
0:09:12.774,000 --> 0:09:14,000
What I'm talking about is putting people to work,

171
0:09:15.012,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and getting kids off the street, and letting them know

172
0:09:18.115,000 --> 0:09:22,000
the joy, the pride and the honor in growing your own food,

173
0:09:23.067,000 --> 0:09:25,000
opening farmer's markets.

174
0:09:25.405,000 --> 0:09:27,000
So what I want to do here,

175
0:09:27.498,000 --> 0:09:29,000
we gotta make this sexy.

176
0:09:30.204,000 --> 0:09:34,000
So I want us all to become ecolutionary renegades,

177
0:09:34.444,000 --> 0:09:35,000
gangstas, gangsta gardeners.

178
0:09:36.163,000 --> 0:09:4,000
We gotta flip the script on what a gangsta is.

179
0:09:40.499,000 --> 0:09:41,000
If you ain't a gardener, you ain't gangsta.

180
0:09:42.352,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Get gangsta with your shovel, okay?

181
0:09:46.772,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And let that be your weapon of choice.

182
0:09:49.956,000 --> 0:09:55,000
(Applause)

183
0:09:56.9,000 --> 0:10:01,000
So basically, if you want to meet with me,

184
0:10:02.523,000 --> 0:10:05,000
you know, if you want to meet,

185
0:10:05.656,000 --> 0:10:08,000
don't call me if you want to sit around in cushy chairs

186
0:10:09.453,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and have meetings where you talk about doing some shit --

187
0:10:13.259,000 --> 0:10:16,000
where you talk about doing some shit.

188
0:10:16.487,000 --> 0:10:19,000
If you want to meet with me, come to the garden

189
0:10:19.641,000 --> 0:10:22,000
with your shovel so we can plant some shit.

190
0:10:22.921,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Peace. Thank you.

191
0:10:26.105,000 --> 0:10:3,000
(Applause)

192
0:10:30.249,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Thank you. (Applause)

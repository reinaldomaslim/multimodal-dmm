2
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So I grew up in Limpopo, on the border of Limpopo

3
0:00:18.319,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and Mpumalanga, a little town called Motetema.

4
0:00:21.328,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Water and electricity supply are as unpredictable

5
0:00:23.881,000 --> 0:00:27,000
as the weather, and growing up in these tough situations,

6
0:00:28.15,000 --> 0:00:31,000
at the age of 17, I was relaxing with a couple of friends

7
0:00:31.673,000 --> 0:00:33,000
of mine in winter, and we were sunbathing.

8
0:00:34.219,000 --> 0:00:37,000
The Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter.

9
0:00:37.408,000 --> 0:00:4,000
So as we were sunbathing, my best friend next to me says,

10
0:00:40.592,000 --> 0:00:43,000
"Man, why doesn't somebody invent something that you can

11
0:00:43.641,000 --> 0:00:46,000
just put on your skin and then you don't have to bathe?"

12
0:00:47.375,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And I sat, and I was like, "Man, I would buy that, eh?"

13
0:00:51.286,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So I went home, and I did a little research,

14
0:00:54.821,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and I found some very shocking statistics.

15
0:00:58.253,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Over 2.5 billion people in the world today

16
0:01:01.27,000 --> 0:01:04,000
do not have proper access to water and sanitation.

17
0:01:04.271,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Four hundred and fifty million of them are in Africa,

18
0:01:06.394,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and five million of them are in South Africa.

19
0:01:09.161,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Various diseases thrive in this environment,

20
0:01:11.701,000 --> 0:01:14,000
the most drastic of which is called trachoma.

21
0:01:15.048,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Trachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirt

22
0:01:17.849,000 --> 0:01:2,000
getting into your eye. Multiple infections of trachoma

23
0:01:21.158,000 --> 0:01:23,000
can leave you permanently blind.

24
0:01:23.842,000 --> 0:01:26,000
The disease leaves eight million people permanently blind

25
0:01:27.575,000 --> 0:01:29,000
each and every year. The shocking part about it

26
0:01:30.32,000 --> 0:01:32,000
is that to avoid being infected with trachoma,

27
0:01:33.017,000 --> 0:01:34,000
all you have to do is wash your face:

28
0:01:34.89,000 --> 0:01:36,000
no medicine, no pills, no injections.

29
0:01:37.703,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So after seeing these shocking statistics, I thought to myself,

30
0:01:40.606,000 --> 0:01:42,000
"Okay, even if I'm not just doing it for myself

31
0:01:42.958,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and the fact that I don't want to bathe, I at least need

32
0:01:45.671,000 --> 0:01:47,000
to do it to try to save the world." (Laughter)

33
0:01:48.311,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So with my trusty little steed, my Nokia 6234 cell phone --

34
0:01:53.264,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I didn't have a laptop, I didn't have Internet much,

35
0:01:56.119,000 --> 0:01:58,000
except for the 20-rand-an-hour Internet cafe —

36
0:01:59.064,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I did research on Wikipedia, on Google, about lotions,

37
0:02:02.105,000 --> 0:02:05,000
creams, the compositions, the melting points, the toxicities --

38
0:02:05.842,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I did high school science --

39
0:02:07.37,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and I wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper,

40
0:02:11.108,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and it looked like the KFC special spice, you know?

41
0:02:14.48,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So I was like, okay, so we've got the formula ready.

42
0:02:16.969,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Now we need to get this thing into practice.

43
0:02:19.718,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Fast forward four years later, after having written

44
0:02:23.714,000 --> 0:02:25,000
a 40-page business plan on the cell phone,

45
0:02:26.298,000 --> 0:02:28,000
having written my patent on the cell phone,

46
0:02:28.397,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I'm the youngest patent-holder in the country,

47
0:02:31.09,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and — ("No more bathing!") —

48
0:02:33.991,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I can't say any more than that. (Laughter)

49
0:02:36.596,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I had invented DryBath, the world's first

50
0:02:40.338,000 --> 0:02:42,000
bath-substituting lotion.

51
0:02:43.124,000 --> 0:02:47,000
You literally put it on your skin, and you don't have to bathe.

52
0:02:47.457,000 --> 0:02:51,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:51.842,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So after having tried to make it work in high school

54
0:02:54.531,000 --> 0:02:57,000
with the limited resources I had, I went to university,

55
0:02:58.048,000 --> 0:03:,000
met a few people, got it into practice,

56
0:03:00.751,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and we have a fully functioning product that's ready

57
0:03:03.803,000 --> 0:03:05,000
to go to the market. It's actually available on the market.

58
0:03:06.6,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So we learned a few lessons in commercializing

59
0:03:09.526,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and making DryBath available.

60
0:03:11.953,000 --> 0:03:13,000
One of the things we learned was that poor communities

61
0:03:14.309,000 --> 0:03:16,000
don't buy products in bulk.

62
0:03:16.569,000 --> 0:03:18,000
They buy products on demand. A person in Alex

63
0:03:19.046,000 --> 0:03:21,000
doesn't buy a box of cigarettes. They buy one cigarette

64
0:03:21.44,000 --> 0:03:23,000
each day, even though it's more expensive.

65
0:03:23.85,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So we packaged DryBath in these innovative little sachets.

66
0:03:26.496,000 --> 0:03:28,000
You just snap them in half, and you squeeze it out.

67
0:03:29.386,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And the cool part is, one sachet substitutes one bath

68
0:03:33.073,000 --> 0:03:35,000
for five rand.

69
0:03:35.283,000 --> 0:03:37,000
After creating that model, we also learned a lot

70
0:03:37.975,000 --> 0:03:38,000
in terms of implementing the product.

71
0:03:39.716,000 --> 0:03:41,000
We realized that even rich kids from the suburbs

72
0:03:42.034,000 --> 0:03:44,000
really want DryBath. (Laughter)

73
0:03:44.222,000 --> 0:03:46,000
At least once a week.

74
0:03:46.405,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Anyway, we realized that we could save 80 million liters

75
0:03:49.017,000 --> 0:03:52,000
of water on average each time they skipped a bath,

76
0:03:52.148,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and also we would save two hours a day for kids

77
0:03:55.083,000 --> 0:03:58,000
who are in rural areas, two hours more for school,

78
0:03:58.149,000 --> 0:03:59,000
two hours more for homework,

79
0:03:59.933,000 --> 0:04:01,000
two hours more to just be a kid.

80
0:04:02.781,000 --> 0:04:04,000
After seeing that global impact, we narrowed it down

81
0:04:05.428,000 --> 0:04:07,000
to our key value proposition,

82
0:04:07.792,000 --> 0:04:09,000
which was cleanliness and convenience.

83
0:04:10.035,000 --> 0:04:12,000
DryBath is a rich man's convenience

84
0:04:12.667,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and a poor man's lifesaver.

85
0:04:15.037,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Having put the product into practice, we are actually now

86
0:04:18.509,000 --> 0:04:2,000
on the verge of selling the product

87
0:04:20.553,000 --> 0:04:23,000
onto a multinational to take it to the retail market,

88
0:04:23.666,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and one question I have for the audience today is,

89
0:04:27.191,000 --> 0:04:29,000
on the gravel roads of Limpopo,

90
0:04:29.464,000 --> 0:04:32,000
with an allowance of 50 rand a week,

91
0:04:32.813,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I came up with a way for the world not to bathe.

92
0:04:36.635,000 --> 0:04:38,000
What's stopping you? (Applause)

93
0:04:39.343,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I'm not done yet. I'm not done yet.

94
0:04:42.289,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And another key thing that I learned a lot

95
0:04:45.354,000 --> 0:04:46,000
throughout this whole process,

96
0:04:46.702,000 --> 0:04:5,000
last year Google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world.

97
0:04:50.787,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I'm also currently the best student entrepreneur

98
0:04:53.656,000 --> 0:04:55,000
in the world, the first African to get that accolade,

99
0:04:56.412,000 --> 0:05:,000
and one thing that really puzzles me is, I did all of this

100
0:05:01.407,000 --> 0:05:04,000
just because I didn't want to bathe. Thank you.

101
0:05:05.043,000 --> 0:05:07,000
(Applause.)

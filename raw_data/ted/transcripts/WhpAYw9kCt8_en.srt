1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:14,000
"How much pain medication are you taking?"

2
0:00:16.12,000 --> 0:00:18,000
That was the very routine question that changed my life.

3
0:00:19.88,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It was July 2015,

4
0:00:21.4,000 --> 0:00:23,000
about two months after I nearly lost my foot

5
0:00:23.8,000 --> 0:00:24,000
in a serious motorcycle accident.

6
0:00:26.4,000 --> 0:00:28,000
So I was back in my orthopedic surgeon's office

7
0:00:28.92,000 --> 0:00:3,000
for yet another follow-up appointment.

8
0:00:31.56,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I looked at my wife, Sadiye;

9
0:00:32.96,000 --> 0:00:33,000
we did some calculating.

10
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:38,000
"About 115 milligrams oxycodone," I responded.

11
0:00:38.96,000 --> 0:00:39,000
"Maybe more."

12
0:00:40.64,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I was nonchalant, having given this information to many doctors

13
0:00:44.72,000 --> 0:00:45,000
many times before,

14
0:00:46.64,000 --> 0:00:47,000
but this time was different.

15
0:00:48.84,000 --> 0:00:49,000
My doctor turned serious

16
0:00:50.44,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and he looked at me and said,

17
0:00:51.88,000 --> 0:00:53,000
"Travis, that's a lot of opioids.

18
0:00:54.28,000 --> 0:00:56,000
You need to think about getting off the meds now."

19
0:00:57.52,000 --> 0:00:59,000
In two months of escalating prescriptions,

20
0:00:59.6,000 --> 0:01:01,000
this was the first time that anyone had expressed concern.

21
0:01:03.12,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Indeed, this was the first real conversation I'd had

22
0:01:05.88,000 --> 0:01:06,000
about my opioid therapy, period.

23
0:01:08.52,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I had been given no warnings,

24
0:01:10.56,000 --> 0:01:11,000
no counseling,

25
0:01:12.2,000 --> 0:01:13,000
no plan ...

26
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:16,000
just lots and lots of prescriptions.

27
0:01:17.96,000 --> 0:01:21,000
What happened next really came to define my entire experience of medical trauma.

28
0:01:22.28,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I was given what I now know is a much too aggressive tapering regimen,

29
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
according to which I divided my medication into four doses,

30
0:01:30.92,000 --> 0:01:32,000
dropping one each week over the course of the month.

31
0:01:34.72,000 --> 0:01:38,000
The result is that I was launched into acute opioid withdrawal.

32
0:01:39.96,000 --> 0:01:41,000
The result, put another way,

33
0:01:42.48,000 --> 0:01:43,000
was hell.

34
0:01:45.52,000 --> 0:01:5,000
The early stages of withdrawal feel a lot like a bad case of the flu.

35
0:01:50.64,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I became nauseated,

36
0:01:52.44,000 --> 0:01:53,000
lost my appetite,

37
0:01:54.2,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I ached everywhere,

38
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
had increased pain in my rather mangled foot;

39
0:01:59.76,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I developed trouble sleeping due to a general feeling of restlessness.

40
0:02:05.68,000 --> 0:02:06,000
At the time,

41
0:02:07.08,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I thought this was all pretty miserable.

42
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:12,000
That's because I didn't know what was coming.

43
0:02:13.64,000 --> 0:02:15,000
At the beginning of week two,

44
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
my life got much worse.

45
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
As the symptoms dialed up in intensity,

46
0:02:22.08,000 --> 0:02:24,000
my internal thermostat seemed to go haywire.

47
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I would sweat profusely almost constantly,

48
0:02:27.88,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and yet if I managed to get myself out into the hot August sun,

49
0:02:31.84,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I might look down and find myself covered in goosebumps.

50
0:02:35.537,000 --> 0:02:38,000
The restlessness that had made sleep difficult during that first week

51
0:02:38.8,000 --> 0:02:41,000
now turned into what I came to think of as the withdrawal feeling.

52
0:02:42.8,000 --> 0:02:47,000
It was a deep sense of jitters that would keep me twitching.

53
0:02:47.84,000 --> 0:02:48,000
It made sleep nearly impossible.

54
0:02:50.56,000 --> 0:02:53,000
But perhaps the most disturbing was the crying.

55
0:02:55.76,000 --> 0:03:,000
I would find myself with tears coming on

56
0:03:00.8,000 --> 0:03:01,000
for seemingly no reason

57
0:03:02.56,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and with no warning.

58
0:03:05.04,000 --> 0:03:07,000
At the time they felt like a neural misfire,

59
0:03:07.48,000 --> 0:03:08,000
similar to the goosebumps.

60
0:03:09.96,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Sadiye became concerned, and she called the prescribing doctor

61
0:03:13.96,000 --> 0:03:16,000
who very helpfully advised lots of fluids for the nausea.

62
0:03:18.48,000 --> 0:03:21,000
When she pushed him and said, "You know, he's really quite badly off,"

63
0:03:21.84,000 --> 0:03:23,000
the doctor responded, "Well, if it's that bad,

64
0:03:24.04,000 --> 0:03:26,000
he can just go back to his previous dose for a little while."

65
0:03:28.2,000 --> 0:03:29,000
"And then what?" I wondered.

66
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
"Try again later," he responded.

67
0:03:34.12,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Now, there's no way that I was going to go back on my previous dose

68
0:03:38.2,000 --> 0:03:41,000
unless I had a better plan for making it through the withdrawal next time.

69
0:03:42.32,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And so we stuck to riding it out and dropped another dose.

70
0:03:47.72,000 --> 0:03:48,000
At the beginning of week three,

71
0:03:50.2,000 --> 0:03:51,000
my world got very dark.

72
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I basically stopped eating,

73
0:03:56.04,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and I barely slept at all

74
0:03:57.84,000 --> 0:03:59,000
thanks to the jitters that would keep me writhing all night.

75
0:04:01.8,000 --> 0:04:02,000
But the worst --

76
0:04:03.76,000 --> 0:04:04,000
the worst was the depression.

77
0:04:06.48,000 --> 0:04:1,000
The tears that had felt like a misfire before

78
0:04:10.56,000 --> 0:04:11,000
now felt meaningful.

79
0:04:12.64,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Several times a day I would get that welling in my chest

80
0:04:15.92,000 --> 0:04:16,000
where you know the tears are coming,

81
0:04:18.48,000 --> 0:04:19,000
but I couldn't stop them

82
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and with them came desperation and hopelessness.

83
0:04:24.88,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I began to believe that I would never recover

84
0:04:27.84,000 --> 0:04:29,000
either from the accident or from the withdrawal.

85
0:04:31.68,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Sadiye got back on the phone with the prescriber

86
0:04:33.959,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and this time he recommended that we contact our pain management team

87
0:04:37.24,000 --> 0:04:38,000
from the last hospitalization.

88
0:04:38.96,000 --> 0:04:39,000
That sounded like a great idea,

89
0:04:40.56,000 --> 0:04:41,000
so we did that immediately,

90
0:04:42.64,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and we were shocked when nobody would speak with us.

91
0:04:45.76,000 --> 0:04:48,000
The receptionist who answered the phone advised us

92
0:04:48.92,000 --> 0:04:51,000
that the pain management team provides an inpatient service;

93
0:04:52.88,000 --> 0:04:54,000
although they prescribe opioids to get pain under control,

94
0:04:55.64,000 --> 0:04:57,000
they do not oversee tapering and withdrawal.

95
0:04:59.32,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Furious, we called the prescriber back and begged him for anything --

96
0:05:05.36,000 --> 0:05:06,000
anything that could help me --

97
0:05:07.08,000 --> 0:05:08,000
but instead he apologized,

98
0:05:09.44,000 --> 0:05:11,000
saying that he was out of his depth.

99
0:05:11.72,000 --> 0:05:12,000
"Look," he told us,

100
0:05:13.12,000 --> 0:05:15,000
"my initial advice to you is clearly bad,

101
0:05:15.64,000 --> 0:05:18,000
so my official recommendation is that Travis go back on the medication

102
0:05:19.28,000 --> 0:05:21,000
until he can find someone more competent to wean him off."

103
0:05:24.84,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Of course I wanted to go back on the medication.

104
0:05:27.12,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I was in agony.

105
0:05:30.92,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But I believed that if I saved myself from the withdrawal with the drugs

106
0:05:37.76,000 --> 0:05:38,000
that I would never be free of them,

107
0:05:40.56,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and so we buckled ourselves in,

108
0:05:42.72,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and I dropped the last dose.

109
0:05:46.08,000 --> 0:05:49,000
As my brain experienced life without prescription opioids

110
0:05:49.24,000 --> 0:05:5,000
for the first time in months,

111
0:05:52.36,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I thought I would die.

112
0:05:54.68,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I assumed I would die --

113
0:05:55.96,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Crying)

114
0:05:57.04,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I'm sorry.

115
0:05:58.28,000 --> 0:05:59,000
(Crying)

116
0:06:04.84,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Because if the symptoms didn't kill me outright,

117
0:06:07.92,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I'd kill myself.

118
0:06:10.36,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And I know that sounds dramatic,

119
0:06:12.24,000 --> 0:06:14,000
because to me, standing up here years later,

120
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:16,000
whole and healthy --

121
0:06:16.88,000 --> 0:06:17,000
to me, it sounds dramatic.

122
0:06:19.24,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But I believed it to my core

123
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:25,000
because I no longer had any hope

124
0:06:27.36,000 --> 0:06:28,000
that I would be normal again.

125
0:06:33.48,000 --> 0:06:35,000
The insomnia became unbearable

126
0:06:36.48,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and after two days with virtually no sleep,

127
0:06:40.28,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I spent a whole night on the floor of our basement bathroom.

128
0:06:45.24,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I alternated between cooling my feverish head

129
0:06:48.64,000 --> 0:06:49,000
against the ceramic tiles

130
0:06:51.12,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and trying violently to throw up despite not having eaten anything in days.

131
0:06:56.96,000 --> 0:06:58,000
When Sadiye found me at the end of the night

132
0:06:59.08,000 --> 0:07:,000
she was horrified,

133
0:07:00.4,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and we got back on the phone.

134
0:07:02.24,000 --> 0:07:03,000
We called everyone.

135
0:07:03.56,000 --> 0:07:06,000
We called surgeons and pain docs and general practitioners --

136
0:07:07.4,000 --> 0:07:09,000
anyone we could find on the internet,

137
0:07:09.96,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and not a single one of them would help me.

138
0:07:13.12,000 --> 0:07:15,000
The few that we could speak with on the phone

139
0:07:16.48,000 --> 0:07:18,000
advised us to go back on the medication.

140
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:25,000
An independent pain management clinic said that they prescribe opioids

141
0:07:25.24,000 --> 0:07:27,000
but they don't oversee tapering or withdrawal.

142
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
When my desperation was clearly coming through my voice,

143
0:07:32.48,000 --> 0:07:33,000
much as it is now,

144
0:07:35.52,000 --> 0:07:37,000
the receptionist took a deep breath and said,

145
0:07:38.36,000 --> 0:07:41,000
"Mr. Rieder, it sounds like perhaps what you need is a rehab facility

146
0:07:41.64,000 --> 0:07:42,000
or a methadone clinic."

147
0:07:43.68,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I didn't know any better at the time, so I took her advice.

148
0:07:46.52,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I hung up and I started calling those places,

149
0:07:48.92,000 --> 0:07:5,000
but it took me virtually no time at all

150
0:07:51.36,000 --> 0:07:53,000
to discover that many of these facilities

151
0:07:54.2,000 --> 0:07:57,000
are geared towards those battling long-term substance use disorder.

152
0:07:57.64,000 --> 0:07:58,000
In the case of opioids,

153
0:07:59.04,000 --> 0:08:02,000
this often involves precisely not weaning the patient off the medication,

154
0:08:02.68,000 --> 0:08:06,000
but transitioning them onto the safer, longer-acting opioids:

155
0:08:06.92,000 --> 0:08:09,000
methadone or buprenorphine for maintenance treatment.

156
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:12,000
In addition, everywhere I called had an extensive waiting list.

157
0:08:13.68,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I was simply not the kind of patient they were designed to see.

158
0:08:18.24,000 --> 0:08:2,000
After being turned away from a rehab facility,

159
0:08:21.12,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I finally admitted defeat.

160
0:08:23.84,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I was broken and beaten,

161
0:08:26.32,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and I couldn't do it anymore.

162
0:08:29.56,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So I told Sadiye that I was going back on the medication.

163
0:08:33.68,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I would start with the lowest dose possible,

164
0:08:35.76,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and I would take only as much as I absolutely needed

165
0:08:38.213,000 --> 0:08:4,000
to escape the most crippling effects of the withdrawal.

166
0:08:41.68,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So that night she helped me up the stairs

167
0:08:43.68,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and for the first time in weeks I actually went to bed.

168
0:08:46.679,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I took the little orange prescription bottle,

169
0:08:49.559,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I set it on my nightstand ...

170
0:08:52.559,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and then I didn't touch it.

171
0:08:55.12,000 --> 0:08:56,000
I fell asleep,

172
0:08:56.4,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I slept through the night

173
0:08:58.36,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and when I woke up,

174
0:08:59.64,000 --> 0:09:01,000
the most severe symptoms had abated dramatically.

175
0:09:03.68,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I'd made it out.

176
0:09:04.96,000 --> 0:09:09,000
(Applause)

177
0:09:14.44,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Thanks for that, that was my response, too.

178
0:09:16.52,000 --> 0:09:17,000
(Laughter)

179
0:09:19.96,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So --

180
0:09:24.08,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I'm sorry, I have to gather myself just a little bit.

181
0:09:27.92,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I think this story is important.

182
0:09:30.2,000 --> 0:09:32,000
It's not because I think I'm special.

183
0:09:32.48,000 --> 0:09:35,000
This story is important precisely because I'm not special;

184
0:09:35.56,000 --> 0:09:37,000
because nothing that happened to me was all that unique.

185
0:09:39.68,000 --> 0:09:42,000
My dependence on opioids was entirely predictable

186
0:09:43,000 --> 0:09:44,000
given the amount that I was prescribed

187
0:09:44.92,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and the duration for which I was prescribed it.

188
0:09:48.36,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Dependence is simply the brain's natural response to an opioid-rich environment

189
0:09:53.2,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and so there was every reason to think that from the beginning,

190
0:09:57.04,000 --> 0:09:59,000
I would need a supervised, well-formed tapering plan,

191
0:10:00.84,000 --> 0:10:04,000
but our health care system seemingly hasn't decided

192
0:10:04.96,000 --> 0:10:06,000
who's responsible for patients like me.

193
0:10:08.12,000 --> 0:10:11,000
The prescribers saw me as a complex patient

194
0:10:11.72,000 --> 0:10:12,000
needing specialized care,

195
0:10:13.24,000 --> 0:10:14,000
probably from pain medicine.

196
0:10:14.72,000 --> 0:10:17,000
The pain docs saw their job as getting pain under control

197
0:10:18.48,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and when I couldn't get off the medication,

198
0:10:20.56,000 --> 0:10:22,000
they saw me as the purview of addiction medicine.

199
0:10:23.28,000 --> 0:10:25,000
But addiction medicine is overstressed

200
0:10:25.44,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and focused on those suffering from long-term substance use disorder.

201
0:10:29.4,000 --> 0:10:32,000
In short, I was prescribed a drug that needed long-term management

202
0:10:33.96,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and then I wasn't given that management,

203
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and it wasn't even clear whose job such management was.

204
0:10:39.92,000 --> 0:10:4,000
This is a recipe for disaster

205
0:10:42.6,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and any such disaster would be interesting and worth talking about --

206
0:10:46.28,000 --> 0:10:47,000
probably worth a TED Talk --

207
0:10:48.96,000 --> 0:10:52,000
but the failure of opioid tapering is a particular concern

208
0:10:53.32,000 --> 0:10:54,000
at this moment in America

209
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
because we are in the midst of an epidemic

210
0:10:59.28,000 --> 0:11:03,000
in which 33,000 people died from overdose in 2015.

211
0:11:04.64,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Nearly half of those deaths involved prescription opioids.

212
0:11:09.68,000 --> 0:11:14,000
The medical community has in fact started to react to this crisis,

213
0:11:14.96,000 --> 0:11:18,000
but much of their response has involved trying to prescribe fewer pills --

214
0:11:19.52,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and absolutely, that's going to be important.

215
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
So for instance, we're now gaining evidence

216
0:11:24.44,000 --> 0:11:27,000
that American physicians often prescribe medication

217
0:11:28.44,000 --> 0:11:29,000
even when it's not necessary

218
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:31,000
in the case of opioids.

219
0:11:31.24,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And even when opioids are called for,

220
0:11:33.24,000 --> 0:11:35,000
they often prescribe much more than is needed.

221
0:11:36.32,000 --> 0:11:41,000
These sorts of considerations help to explain why America,

222
0:11:41.52,000 --> 0:11:44,000
despite accounting for only five percent of the global population,

223
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
consumes nearly 70 percent of the total global opioid supply.

224
0:11:50.68,000 --> 0:11:54,000
But focusing only on the rate of prescribing

225
0:11:55.2,000 --> 0:11:58,000
risks overlooking two crucially important points.

226
0:11:59.76,000 --> 0:12:03,000
The first is that opioids just are

227
0:12:04.64,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and will continue to be important pain therapies.

228
0:12:08.2,000 --> 0:12:13,000
As somebody who has had severe, real, long-lasting pain,

229
0:12:13.24,000 --> 0:12:16,000
I can assure you these medications can make life worth living.

230
0:12:18.48,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And second:

231
0:12:20.2,000 --> 0:12:24,000
we can still fight the epidemic while judiciously prescribing opioids

232
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
to people who really need them

233
0:12:27.76,000 --> 0:12:3,000
by requiring that doctors properly manage the pills that they do prescribe.

234
0:12:32.2,000 --> 0:12:33,000
So for instance,

235
0:12:33.84,000 --> 0:12:35,000
go back to the tapering regimen that I was given.

236
0:12:36.92,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Is it reasonable to expect

237
0:12:39.04,000 --> 0:12:42,000
that any physician who prescribes opioids knows that that is too aggressive?

238
0:12:43.88,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Well, after I initially published my story in an academic journal,

239
0:12:47.68,000 --> 0:12:51,000
someone from the CDC sent me their pocket guide for tapering opioids.

240
0:12:52.64,000 --> 0:12:53,000
This is a four-page document,

241
0:12:54.6,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and most of it's pictures.

242
0:12:57.2,000 --> 0:13:01,000
In it, they teach physicians how to taper opioids in the easier cases,

243
0:13:02,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and one of the their recommendations

244
0:13:03.76,000 --> 0:13:07,000
is that you never start at more than a 10 percent dose reduction per week.

245
0:13:09.36,000 --> 0:13:11,000
If my physician had given me that plan,

246
0:13:12.12,000 --> 0:13:16,000
my taper would have taken several months instead of a few weeks.

247
0:13:18.44,000 --> 0:13:2,000
I'm sure it wouldn't have been easy.

248
0:13:20.6,000 --> 0:13:22,000
It probably would have been pretty uncomfortable,

249
0:13:23.84,000 --> 0:13:24,000
but maybe it wouldn't have been hell.

250
0:13:26.72,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And that seems like the kind of information

251
0:13:28.8,000 --> 0:13:3,000
that someone who prescribes this medication ought to have.

252
0:13:33.08,000 --> 0:13:34,000
In closing,

253
0:13:35.2,000 --> 0:13:4,000
I need to say that properly managing prescribed opioids

254
0:13:40.64,000 --> 0:13:42,000
will not by itself solve the crisis.

255
0:13:43.64,000 --> 0:13:46,000
America's epidemic is far bigger than that,

256
0:13:47.96,000 --> 0:13:52,000
but when a medication is responsible for tens of thousands of deaths a year,

257
0:13:53.04,000 --> 0:13:57,000
reckless management of that medication is indefensible.

258
0:13:58.64,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Helping opioid therapy patients to get off the medication

259
0:14:01.96,000 --> 0:14:03,000
that they were prescribed

260
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:06,000
may not be a complete solution to our epidemic,

261
0:14:07.32,000 --> 0:14:09,000
but it would clearly constitute progress.

262
0:14:10.24,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Thank you.

263
0:14:11.48,000 --> 0:14:13,000
(Applause)

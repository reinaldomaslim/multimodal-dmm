1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Have you ever wondered

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
why extremism seems to have been on the rise in Muslim-majority countries

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
over the course of the last decade?

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Have you ever wondered

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
how such a situation can be turned around?

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Have you ever looked at the Arab uprisings

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and thought, "How could we have predicted that?"

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
or "How could we have better prepared for that?"

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Well my personal story, my personal journey,

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
what brings me to the TED stage here today,

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
is a demonstration of exactly what's been happening

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
in Muslim-majority countries

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
over the course of the last decades, at least, and beyond.

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I want to share some of that story with you,

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
but also some of my ideas around change

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and the role of social movements in creating change

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
in Muslim-majority societies.

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So let me begin

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
by first of all giving a very, very brief history of time,

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
if I may indulge.

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
In medieval societies there were defined allegiances.

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
An identity was defined

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
primarily by religion.

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And then we moved on into an era in the 19th century

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
with the rise of a European nation-state

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
where identities and allegiances were defined

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
by ethnicity.

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So identity was primarily defined by ethnicity,

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and the nation-state reflected that.

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
In the age of globalization, we moved on.

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I call it the era of citizenship --

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
where people could be from multi-racial, multi-ethnic backgrounds,

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
but all be equal as citizens

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
in a state.

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
You could be American-Italian; you could be American-Irish;

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
you could be British-Pakistani.

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
But I believe now

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that we're moving into a new age,

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and that age The New York Times dubbed recently

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
as "the age of behavior."

41
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
How I define the age of behavior

42
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
is a period of transnational allegiances,

43
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
where identity is defined more so

44
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
by ideas and narratives.

45
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And these ideas and narratives that bump people across borders

46
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
are increasingly beginning to affect

47
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
the way in which people behave.

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Now this is not all necessarily good news,

49
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
because it's also my belief

50
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that hatred has gone global

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
just as much as love.

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
But actually it's my belief

53
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that the people who've been truly capitalizing on this age of behavior,

54
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
up until now, up until recent times,

55
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
up until the last six months,

56
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
the people who have been capitalizing most

57
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
on the age of behavior

58
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and the transnational allegiances,

59
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
using digital activism

60
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and other sorts of borderless technologies,

61
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
those who've been benefiting from this

62
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
have been extremists.

63
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And that's something which I'd like to elaborate on.

64
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
If we look at Islamists,

65
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
if we look at the phenomenon

66
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
of far-right fascists,

67
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
one thing they've been very good at,

68
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
one thing that they've actually been exceeding in,

69
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
is communicating across borders,

70
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
using technologies to organize themselves,

71
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
to propagate their message

72
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and to create truly global phenomena.

73
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Now I should know,

74
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
because for 13 years of my life,

75
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I was involved in an extreme Islamist organization.

76
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And I was actually a potent force

77
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
in spreading ideas across borders,

78
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and I witnessed the rise of Islamist extremism

79
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
as distinct from Islam the faith,

80
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and the way in which it influenced my co-religionists

81
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
across the world.

82
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And my story, my personal story,

83
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
is truly evidence for the age of behavior

84
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that I'm attempting to elaborate upon here.

85
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I was, by the way -- I'm an Essex lad,

86
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
born and raised in Essex in the U.K.

87
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Anyone who's from England

88
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
knows the reputation we have from Essex.

89
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
But having been born in Essex,

90
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
at the age of 16,

91
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I joined an organization.

92
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
At the age of 17, I was recruiting people from Cambridge University

93
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
to this organization.

94
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
At the age of 19,

95
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I was on the national leadership of this organization in the U.K.

96
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
At the age of 21, I was co-founding this organization in Pakistan.

97
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
At the age of 22,

98
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I was co-founding this organization in Denmark.

99
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
By the age of 24,

100
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
I found myself convicted in prison in Egypt,

101
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
being blacklisted from three countries in the world

102
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
for attempting to overthrow their governments,

103
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
being subjected to torture

104
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
in Egyptian jails

105
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and sentenced to five years as a prisoner of conscience.

106
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Now that journey,

107
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and what took me from Essex all the way across the world --

108
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
by the way, we were laughing at democratic activists.

109
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
We felt they were from the age of yesteryear.

110
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
We felt that they were out of date.

111
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I learned how to use email

112
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
from the extremist organization that I used.

113
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I learned how to effectively communicate across borders

114
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
without being detected.

115
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Eventually I was detected, of course, in Egypt.

116
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But the way in which I learned

117
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to use technology to my advantage

118
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
was because I was within an extremist organization

119
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
that was forced to think beyond

120
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
the confines of the nation-state.

121
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
The age of behavior: where ideas and narratives

122
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
were increasingly defining behavior

123
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and identity and allegiances.

124
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So as I said, we looked to the status quo

125
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and ridiculed it.

126
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And it's not just Islamist extremists that did this.

127
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
But even if you look across

128
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
the mood music in Europe of late,

129
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
far-right fascism is also on the rise.

130
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
A form of anti-Islam rhetoric

131
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
is also on the rise

132
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and it's transnational.

133
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And the consequences that this is having

134
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
is that it's affecting the political climate

135
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
across Europe.

136
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
What's actually happening

137
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
is that what were previously localized parochialisms,

138
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
individual or groupings of extremists

139
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
who were isolated from one another,

140
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
have become interconnected in a globalized way

141
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and have thus become, or are becoming, mainstream.

142
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Because the Internet and connection technologies

143
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
are connecting them across the world.

144
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
If you look at the rise of far-right fascism across Europe of late,

145
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
you will see some things that are happening

146
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
that are influencing domestic politics,

147
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
yet the phenomenon is transnational.

148
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
In certain countries, mosque minarets are being banned.

149
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
In others, headscarves are being banned.

150
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
In others, kosher and halal meat are being banned,

151
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
as we speak.

152
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And on the flip side,

153
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
we have transnational Islamist extremists

154
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
doing the same thing across their own societies.

155
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And so they are pockets of parochialism that are being connected

156
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
in a way that makes them feel like they are mainstream.

157
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Now that never would have been possible before.

158
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
They would have felt isolated,

159
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
until these sorts of technologies came around

160
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and connected them in a way

161
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
that made them feel part of a larger phenomenon.

162
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Where does that leave democracy aspirants?

163
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Well I believe they're getting left far behind.

164
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And I'll give you an example here at this stage.

165
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
If any of you remembers the Christmas Day bomb plot:

166
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
there's a man called Anwar al-Awlaki.

167
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
As an American citizen, ethnically a Yemeni,

168
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
in hiding currently in Yemen,

169
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
who inspired a Nigerian,

170
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
son of the head of Nigeria's national bank.

171
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
This Nigerian student studied in London, trained in Yemen,

172
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
boarded a flight in Amsterdam to attack America.

173
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
In the meanwhile,

174
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
the Old mentality with a capital O,

175
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
was represented by his father, the head of the Nigerian bank,

176
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
warning the CIA that his own son was about to attack,

177
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and this warning fell on deaf ears.

178
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
The Old mentality with a capital O,

179
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
as represented by the nation-state,

180
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
not yet fully into the age of behavior,

181
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
not recognizing the power of transnational social movements,

182
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
got left behind.

183
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And the Christmas Day bomber almost succeeded

184
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
in attacking the United States of America.

185
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Again with the example of the far right:

186
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
that we find, ironically,

187
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
xenophobic nationalists

188
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
are utilizing the benefits of globalization.

189
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So why are they succeeding?

190
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And why are democracy aspirants falling behind?

191
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
Well we need to understand the power of the social movements who understand this.

192
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And a social movement is comprised, in my view,

193
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
it's comprised of four main characteristics.

194
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
It's comprised of ideas and narratives

195
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and symbols and leaders.

196
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I'll talk you through one example,

197
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and that's the example that everyone here will be aware of,

198
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and that's the example of Al-Qaeda.

199
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
If I asked you to think of the ideas of Al-Qaeda,

200
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
that's something that comes to your mind immediately.

201
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
If I ask you to think of their narratives --

202
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
the West being at war with Islam, the need to defend Islam against the West --

203
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
these narratives, they come to your mind immediately.

204
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Incidentally, the difference between ideas and narratives:

205
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
the idea is the cause that one believes in;

206
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and the narrative is the way to sell that cause --

207
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
the propaganda, if you like, of the cause.

208
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So the ideas and the narratives of Al-Qaeda come to your mind immediately.

209
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
If I ask you to think of their symbols and their leaders,

210
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
they come to your mind immediately.

211
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
One of their leaders was killed in Pakistan recently.

212
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
So these symbols and these leaders

213
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
come to your mind immediately.

214
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And that's the power of social movements.

215
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
They're transnational, and they bond around these ideas and narratives

216
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and these symbols and these leaders.

217
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
However,

218
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
if I ask your minds to focus currently on Pakistan,

219
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and I ask you to think

220
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
of the symbols and the leaders for democracy

221
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
in Pakistan today,

222
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
you'll be hard pressed

223
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
to think beyond perhaps

224
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
the assassination of Benazir Bhutto.

225
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Which means, by definition,

226
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
that particular leader no longer exists.

227
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
One of the problems we're facing is, in my view,

228
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
that there are no globalized,

229
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
youth-led, grassroots social movements

230
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
advocating for democratic culture

231
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
across Muslim-majority societies.

232
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
There is no equivalent of the Al-Qaeda, without the terrorism,

233
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
for democracy across Muslim-majority societies.

234
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
There are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols

235
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
advocating the democratic culture on the ground.

236
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So that begs the next question.

237
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Why is it that extremist organizations,

238
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
whether of the far-right or of the Islamist extremism --

239
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Islamism meaning those who wish to impose

240
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
one version of Islam over the rest of society --

241
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
why is it that they are succeeding

242
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
in organizing in a globalized way,

243
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
whereas those who aspire to democratic culture

244
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
are falling behind?

245
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And I believe that's for four reasons.

246
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I believe, number one, it's complacency.

247
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Because those who aspire to democratic culture

248
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
are in power,

249
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
or have societies

250
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
that are leading globalized, powerful societies,

251
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
powerful countries.

252
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And that level of complacency means

253
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
they don't feel the need to advocate for that culture.

254
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
The second, I believe,

255
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
is political correctness.

256
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
That we have a hesitation

257
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
in espousing the universality of democratic culture

258
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
because we are associating that --

259
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
we associate believing in the universality of our values --

260
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
with extremists.

261
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Yet actually, whenever we talk about human rights,

262
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
we do say that human rights are universal.

263
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
But actually going out to propagate that view

264
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
is associated with either neoconservativism

265
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
or with Islamist extremism.

266
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
To go around saying that I believe

267
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
democratic culture is the best that we've arrived at

268
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
as a form of political organizing

269
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
is associated with extremism.

270
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And the third,

271
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
democratic choice in Muslim-majority societies

272
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
has been relegated to a political choice,

273
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
meaning political parties

274
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
in many of these societies

275
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
ask people to vote for them

276
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
as the democratic party,

277
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
but then the other parties ask them to vote for them

278
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
as the military party --

279
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
wanting to rule by military dictatorship.

280
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And then you have a third party saying,

281
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
"Vote for us; we'll establish a theocracy."

282
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
So democracy has become merely one political choice

283
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
among many other forms

284
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
of political choices available in those societies.

285
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And what happens as a result of this

286
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
is, when those parties are elected,

287
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and inevitably they fail,

288
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
or inevitably they make political mistakes,

289
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
democracy takes the blame

290
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
for their political mistakes.

291
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And then people say, "We've tried democracy. It doesn't really work.

292
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Let's bring the military back again."

293
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And the fourth reason, I believe,

294
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
is what I've labeled here on the slide as the ideology of resistance.

295
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
What I mean by that is,

296
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
if the world superpower today was a communist,

297
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
it would be much easier for democracy activists

298
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
to use democracy activism

299
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
as a form of resistance against colonialism,

300
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
than it is today with the world superpower being America,

301
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
occupying certain lands

302
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and also espousing democratic ideals.

303
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
So roughly these four reasons

304
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
make it a lot more difficult for democratic culture to spread

305
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
as a civilizational choice,

306
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
not merely as a political choice.

307
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
When talking about those reasons,

308
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
let's break down certain preconceptions.

309
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Is it just about grievances?

310
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Is it just about a lack of education?

311
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Well statistically,

312
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
the majority of those who join extremist organizations are highly educated.

313
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Statistically, they are educated, on average,

314
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
above the education levels

315
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
of Western society.

316
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Anecdotally, we can demonstrate

317
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
that if poverty was the only factor,

318
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
well Bin Laden is from one of the richest families in Saudi Arabia.

319
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
His deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was a pediatrician --

320
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
not an ill-educated man.

321
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
International aid and development has been going on for years,

322
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
but extremism in those societies, in many of those societies,

323
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
has been on the rise.

324
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And what I believe is missing

325
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
is genuine grassroots activism

326
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
on the ground,

327
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
in addition to international aid,

328
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
in addition to education, in addition to health.

329
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Not exclusive to these things, but in addition to them,

330
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
is propagating a genuine demand for democracy on the ground.

331
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And this is where I believe

332
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
neoconservatism had it upside-down.

333
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Neoconservatism had the philosophy

334
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
that you go in with a supply-led approach

335
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
to impose democratic values from the top down.

336
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Whereas Islamists and far-right organizations, for decades,

337
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
have been building demand for their ideology on the grassroots.

338
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
They've been building civilizational demand for their values

339
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
on the grassroots,

340
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
and we've been seeing those societies slowly transition

341
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
to societies that are increasingly asking for

342
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
a form of Islamism.

343
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Mass movements in Pakistan

344
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
have been represented after the Arab uprisings

345
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
mainly by organizations

346
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
claiming for some form of theocracy,

347
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
rather than for a democratic uprising.

348
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Because since pre-partition,

349
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
they've been building demand for their ideology on the ground.

350
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
And what's needed is a genuine transnational

351
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
youth-led movement

352
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
that works to actively advocate

353
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
for the democratic culture --

354
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
which is necessarily more

355
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
than just elections.

356
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
But without freedom of speech, you can't have free and fair elections.

357
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Without human rights, you don't have the protection granted to you to campaign.

358
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Without freedom of belief,

359
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
you don't have the right to join organizations.

360
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
So what's needed is those organizations on the ground

361
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
advocating for the democratic culture itself

362
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
to create the demand on the ground for this culture.

363
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
What that will do

364
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
is avoid the problem I was talking about earlier,

365
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
where currently we have political parties presenting democracy

366
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
as merely a political choice in those societies

367
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
alongside other choices

368
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
such as military rule and theocracy.

369
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Whereas if we start building this demand on the ground on a civilizational level,

370
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
rather than merely on a political level,

371
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
a level above politics --

372
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
movements that are not political parties,

373
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
but are rather creating this civilizational demand

374
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
for this democratic culture.

375
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
What we'll have in the end

376
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
is this ideal that you see on the slide here --

377
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
the ideal that people should vote in an existing democracy,

378
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
not for a democracy.

379
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
But to get to that stage,

380
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
where democracy builds the fabric of society

381
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
and the political choices within that fabric,

382
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
but are certainly not theocratic and military dictatorship --

383
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
i.e. you're voting in a democracy,

384
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
in an existing democracy,

385
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
and that democracy is not merely one of the choices at the ballot box.

386
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
To get to that stage,

387
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
we genuinely need to start building demand

388
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
in those societies on the ground.

389
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Now to conclude, how does that happen?

390
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Well, Egypt is a good starting point.

391
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
The Arab uprisings have demonstrated that this is already beginning.

392
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
But what happened in the Arab uprisings and what happened in Egypt

393
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
was particularly cathartic for me.

394
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
What happened there was a political coalition

395
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
gathered together for a political goal,

396
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and that was to remove the leader.

397
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
We need to move one step beyond that now.

398
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
We need to see how we can help those societies

399
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
move from political coalitions,

400
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
loosely based political coalitions,

401
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
to civilizational coalitions

402
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
that are working for the ideals and narratives

403
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
of the democratic culture on the ground.

404
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Because it's not enough to remove a leader

405
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
or ruler or dictator.

406
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
That doesn't guarantee that what comes next

407
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
will be a society built on democratic values.

408
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
But generally, the trends that start in Egypt

409
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
have historically spread across the MENA region,

410
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
the Middle East and North Africa region.

411
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
So when Arab socialism started in Egypt, it spread across the region.

412
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
In the '80s and '90s when Islamism started in the region,

413
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
it spread across the MENA region as a whole.

414
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
And the aspiration that we have at the moment --

415
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
as young Arabs are proving today

416
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
and instantly rebranding themselves

417
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
as being prepared to die for more than just terrorism --

418
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
is that there is a chance

419
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
that democratic culture can start in the region

420
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
and spread across to the rest of the countries that are surrounding that.

421
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
But that will require

422
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
helping these societies transition

423
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
from having merely political coalitions

424
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
to building genuinely grassroots-based social movements

425
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
that advocate for the democratic culture.

426
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
And we've made a start for that in Pakistan

427
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
with a movement called Khudi,

428
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
where we are working on the ground to encourage the youth

429
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
to create genuine buy-in for the democratic culture.

430
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
And it's with that thought that I'll end.

431
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
And my time is up, and thank you for your time.

432
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Pat Mitchell: What is the story of this pin?

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Madeleine Albright: This is "Breaking the Glass Ceiling."

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
PM: Oh.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
That was well chosen, I would say, for TEDWomen.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
MA: Most of the time I spend when I get up in the morning

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
is trying to figure out what is going to happen.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And none of this pin stuff would have happened

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
if it hadn't been for Saddam Hussein.

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I'll tell you what happened.

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I went to the United Nations as an ambassador,

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and it was after the Gulf War,

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and I was an instructed ambassador.

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And the cease-fire had been translated

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
into a series of sanctions resolutions,

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and my instructions

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
were to say perfectly terrible things about Saddam Hussein constantly,

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
which he deserved -- he had invaded another country.

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And so all of a sudden, a poem appeared in the papers in Baghdad

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
comparing me to many things,

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
but among them an "unparalleled serpent."

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And so I happened to have a snake pin.

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So I wore it when we talked about Iraq.

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And when I went out to meet the press,

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
they zeroed in, said, "Why are you wearing that snake pin?"

26
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I said, "Because Saddam Hussein compared me to an unparalleled serpent."

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And then I thought, well this is fun.

28
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So I went out and I bought a lot of pins

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that would, in fact, reflect

30
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
what I thought we were going to do on any given day.

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So that's how it all started.

32
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
PM: So how large is the collection?

33
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
MA: Pretty big.

34
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
It's now traveling.

35
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
At the moment it's in Indianapolis,

36
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
but it was at the Smithsonian.

37
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And it goes with a book that says, "Read My Pins."

38
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
(Laughter)

39
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
PM: So is this a good idea.

40
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I remember when you were the first woman

41
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
as Secretary of State,

42
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and there was a lot of conversation always

43
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
about what you were wearing,

44
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
how you looked --

45
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
the thing that happens to a lot of women,

46
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
especially if they're the first in a position.

47
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So how do you feel about that -- the whole --

48
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
MA: Well, it's pretty irritating actually

49
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing.

50
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
But people did pay attention to what clothes I had.

51
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
What was interesting was that,

52
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
before I went up to New York as U.N. ambassador,

53
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I talked to Jeane Kirkpatrick, who'd been ambassador before me,

54
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and she said, "You've got to get rid of your professor clothes.

55
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Go out and look like a diplomat."

56
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So that did give me a lot of opportunities to go shopping.

57
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
But still, there were all kinds of questions

58
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
about -- "did you wear a hat?" "How short was your skirt?"

59
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And one of the things --

60
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
if you remember Condoleezza Rice was at some event and she wore boots,

61
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and she got criticized over that.

62
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And no guy ever gets criticized. But that's the least of it.

63
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
PM: It is, for all of us, men and women,

64
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
finding our ways of defining our roles,

65
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and doing them in ways that make a difference in the world

66
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and shape the future.

67
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
How did you handle that balance

68
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
between being the tough diplomatic

69
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and strong voice of this country

70
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
to the rest of the world

71
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and also how you felt about yourself

72
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
as a mother, a grandmother, nurturing ...

73
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and so how did you handle that?

74
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
MA: Well the interesting part was I was asked

75
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
what it was like to be the first woman Secretary of State

76
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
a few minutes after I'd been named.

77
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And I said, "Well I've been a woman for 60 years,

78
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
but I've only been Secretary of State for a few minutes."

79
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
So it evolved.

80
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
(Laughter)

81
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
But basically I love being a woman.

82
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And so what happened --

83
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and I think there will probably be some people in the audience

84
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
that will identify with this --

85
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I went to my first meeting, first at the U.N.,

86
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and that's when this all started,

87
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
because that is a very male organization.

88
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And I'm sitting there -- there are 15 members of the Security Council --

89
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
so 14 men sat there staring at me,

90
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and I thought -- well you know how we all are.

91
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
You want to get the feeling of the room,

92
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and "do people like me?"

93
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and "will I really say something intelligent?"

94
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
And all of a sudden I thought, "Well, wait a minute.

95
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I am sitting behind a sign that says 'The United States,'

96
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and if I don't speak today

97
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
then the voice of the United States will not be heard,"

98
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and it was the first time that I had that feeling

99
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that I had to step out of myself

100
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
in my normal, reluctant female mode

101
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and decide that I had to speak on behalf of our country.

102
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And so that happened more at various times,

103
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
but I really think that there was a great advantage in many ways

104
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
to being a woman.

105
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I think we are a lot better

106
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
at personal relationships,

107
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and then have the capability obviously

108
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
of telling it like it is when it's necessary.

109
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
But I have to tell you, I have my youngest granddaughter,

110
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
when she turned seven last year,

111
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
said to her mother, my daughter,

112
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
"So what's the big deal about Grandma Maddie being Secretary of State?

113
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Only girls are Secretary of State."

114
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
(Laughter)

115
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Applause)

116
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
PM: Because in her lifetime -- MA: That would be so.

117
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
PM: What a change that is.

118
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
As you travel now all over the world,

119
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
which you do frequently,

120
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
how do you assess

121
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
this global narrative around the story of women and girls?

122
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Where are we?

123
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
MA: I think we're slowly changing,

124
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
but obviously there are whole pockets

125
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
in countries where nothing is different.

126
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And therefore it means that we have to remember

127
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
that, while many of us have had huge opportunities --

128
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and Pat, you have been a real leader in your field --

129
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
is that there are a lot of women

130
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that are not capable

131
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
of worrying and taking care of themselves

132
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and understanding that women have to help other women.

133
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And so what I have felt --

134
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and I have looked at this

135
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
from a national security issue --

136
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
when I was Secretary of State, I decided

137
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that women's issues had to be central to American foreign policy,

138
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
not just because I'm a feminist,

139
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
but because I believe that societies are better off

140
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
when women are politically and economically empowered,

141
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that values are passed down,

142
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
the health situation is better,

143
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
education is better,

144
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
there is greater economic prosperity.

145
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So I think that it behooves us --

146
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
those of us that live in various countries

147
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
where we do have economic and political voice --

148
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that we need to help other women.

149
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And I really dedicated myself to that,

150
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
both at the U.N. and then as Secretary of State.

151
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
PM: And did you get pushback

152
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
from making that a central tenant of foreign policy?

153
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
MA: From some people.

154
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I think that they thought that it was a soft issue.

155
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
The bottom line that I decided

156
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
was actually women's issues are the hardest issues,

157
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
because they are the ones that have to do with life and death

158
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
in so many aspects,

159
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and because, as I said,

160
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
it is really central to the way that we think about things.

161
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Now for instance,

162
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
some of the wars that took place

163
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
when I was in office,

164
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
a lot of them, the women were the main victims of it.

165
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
For instance, when I started,

166
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
there were wars in the Balkans.

167
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
The women in Bosnia were being raped.

168
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
We then managed to set up a war crimes tribunal

169
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
to deal specifically with those kinds of issues.

170
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And by the way, one of the things that I did at that stage

171
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
was, I had just arrived at the U.N.,

172
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and when I was there, there were 183 countries in the U.N.

173
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Now there are 192.

174
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
But it was one of the first times that I didn't have to cook lunch myself.

175
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So I said to my assistant,

176
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
"Invite the other women permanent representatives."

177
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And I thought when I'd get to my apartment

178
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
that there'd be a lot of women there.

179
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I get there, and there are six other women, out of 183.

180
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So the countries that had women representatives

181
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
were Canada, Kazakhstan, Philippines,

182
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Trinidad Tobago, Jamaica,

183
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Lichtenstein and me.

184
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So being an American, I decided to set up a caucus.

185
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
(Laughter)

186
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And so we set it up,

187
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
and we called ourselves the G7.

188
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
(Laughter)

189
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
PM: Is that "Girl 7?" MA: Girl 7.

190
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And we lobbied

191
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
on behalf of women's issues.

192
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
So we managed to get two women judges

193
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
on this war crimes tribunal.

194
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And then what happened

195
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
was that they were able to declare that rape was a weapon of war,

196
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
that it was against humanity.

197
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
(Applause)

198
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
PM: So when you look around the world

199
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and you see that, in many cases --

200
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
certainly in the Western world --

201
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
women are evolving into more leadership positions,

202
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and even other places

203
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
some barriers are being brought down,

204
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
but there's still so much violence,

205
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
still so many problems,

206
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and yet we hear there are more women

207
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
at the negotiating tables.

208
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Now you were at those negotiating tables

209
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
when they weren't, when there was maybe you --

210
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
one voice, maybe one or two others.

211
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Do you believe, and can you tell us why,

212
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
there is going to be a significant shift

213
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
in things like violence

214
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and peace and conflict and resolution

215
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
on a sustainable basis?

216
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
MA: Well I do think, when there are more women,

217
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that the tone of the conversation changes,

218
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and also the goals of the conversation change.

219
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
But it doesn't mean that the whole world

220
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
would be a lot better

221
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
if it were totally run by women.

222
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
If you think that, you've forgotten high school.

223
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
(Laughter)

224
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
But the bottom line

225
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
is that there is a way,

226
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
when there are more women at the table,

227
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
that there's an attempt

228
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
to develop some understanding.

229
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So for instance, what I did when I went to Burundi,

230
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
we'd got Tutsi and Hutu women together

231
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
to talk about some of the problems

232
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that had taken place in Rwanda.

233
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And so I think the capability of women

234
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
to put themselves --

235
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
I think we're better about putting ourselves into the other guy's shoes

236
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and having more empathy.

237
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
I think it helps in terms of the support

238
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
if there are other women in the room.

239
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
When I was Secretary of State,

240
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
there were only 13 other women foreign ministers.

241
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And so it was nice when one of them would show up.

242
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
For instance, she is now the president of Finland,

243
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
but Tarja Halonen was the foreign minister of Finland

244
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and, at a certain stage, head of the European Union.

245
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And it was really terrific.

246
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Because one of the things I think you'll understand.

247
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
We went to a meeting,

248
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and the men in my delegation,

249
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
when I would say, "Well I feel we should do something about this,"

250
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and they'd say, "What do you mean, you feel?"

251
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And so then Tarja was sitting across the table from me.

252
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And all of a sudden we were talking about arms control,

253
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and she said, "Well I feel we should do this."

254
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And my male colleagues kind of got it all of a sudden.

255
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
But I think it really does help

256
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
to have a critical mass of women

257
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
in a series of foreign policy positions.

258
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
The other thing that I think is really important:

259
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
A lot of national security policy

260
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
isn't just about foreign policy,

261
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
but it's about budgets, military budgets,

262
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and how the debts of countries work out.

263
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
So if you have women

264
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
in a variety of foreign policy posts,

265
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
they can support each other

266
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
when there are budget decisions being made in their own countries.

267
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
PM: So how do we get

268
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
this balance we're looking for, then, in the world?

269
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
More women's voices at the table?

270
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
More men who believe

271
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
that the balance is best?

272
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
MA: Well I think one of the things --

273
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
I'm chairman of the board of an organization

274
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
called the National Democratic Institute

275
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
that works to support women candidates.

276
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
I think that we need

277
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
to help in other countries

278
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
to train women

279
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
to be in political office,

280
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
to figure out how they can in fact

281
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
develop political voices.

282
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
I think we also need to be supportive

283
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
when businesses are being created

284
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and just make sure that women help each other.

285
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Now I have a saying

286
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
that I feel very strongly about,

287
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
because I am of a certain age

288
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
where, when I started in my career,

289
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
believe it or not, there were other women who criticized me:

290
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
"Why aren't you in the carpool line?"

291
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
or "Aren't your children suffering

292
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
because you're not there all the time?"

293
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And I think we have a tendency to make each other feel guilty.

294
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
In fact, I think "guilt" is every woman's middle name.

295
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And so I think what needs to happen

296
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
is we need to help each other.

297
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And my motto is that there's a special place in hell

298
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
for women who don't help each other.

299
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
(Applause)

300
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
PM: Well Secretary Albright, I guess you'll be going to heaven.

301
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Thank you for joining us today.

302
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
MA: Thank you all. Thanks Pat.

303
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
(Applause)

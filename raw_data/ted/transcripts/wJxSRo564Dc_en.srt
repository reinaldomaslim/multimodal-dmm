1
0:00:13.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I have a big impact on the planet

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
to travel here by plane.

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I emitted, in the atmosphere, nine tons of CO2;

4
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that is the weight of two elephants.

5
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I came here to speak about ecology,

6
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and I emitted as much CO2

7
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
as a Frenchman in one year.

8
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
So what do I have to do?

9
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I have to kill a Frenchman when I come back at home?

10
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I have to do my carbon offset in another way,

12
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
like I do every time.

13
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
In fact my work is to show

15
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
our impact on our planet.

16
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I'm going to show you some examples

17
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
of the last pictures I've done

18
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
in the last year.

19
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Alberta sand oil, a lot of pollution.

20
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
You know the problem;

21
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
we don't want to believe what we know.

22
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
In Alberta people work nonstop,

23
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
24 hours by seven

24
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
to extract as much oil

25
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
as they can.

26
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
We know about the end of oil.

27
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Oil sand is not a long-term solution.

28
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
But we use three times more oil

29
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
than we find every year.

30
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
We don't want to believe what we know.

31
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Deny.

32
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Coral reef in New Caledonia.

33
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
100 percent of the coral

34
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
may be wiped out before 2050

35
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
because of global warming.

36
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And you know how coral are very sensitive to temperature,

37
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and are very important for the biodiversity of the sea.

38
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
North Pole. I've done this picture last summer.

39
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
It was impossible to do this picture 15 years ago.

40
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Now there is a new way open between Atlantic and Pacific.

41
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
The thickness of the Arctic

42
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
decreased more than 40 percent

43
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
since 1960.

44
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
There is a new face of Kilimanjaro without ice.

45
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Sad picture.

46
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
It lost 80 percent of its ice.

47
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
According to scientists,

48
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
in 100 years

49
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
all the mountain glacier will be gone.

50
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Glaciers are very important for the life on earth.

51
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
Like Al Gore told you,

52
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
two billion people live on the water

53
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
from the glacier of Himalaya.

54
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Return of fish men.

55
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
One fifth of human kind

56
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
depend on fish to live.

57
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Today now 70 percent

58
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
of the fish stock are over-exploited.

59
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
According to FAO,

60
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
if we don't change our system of fishing

61
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
the main sea resources will be gone in 2050.

62
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
We don't want to believe what we know.

63
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
The beautiful picture, by [unclear] in Africa.

64
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
One human of six

65
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
have not enough to eat in the world.

66
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
One billion people have not enough to eat.

67
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
In Africa, corn is one of the main foods in many places.

68
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Here in America,

69
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
90 percent of the corn cultivated

70
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
is used to feed animals or to do oil.

71
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Palm tree plantation in Borneo.

72
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Every year we lose 50 thousand square miles in deforestation.

73
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Refugee camp in Darfur.

74
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Today we have 20 million refugees in the world.

75
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
According to the U.N.,

76
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
we speak about 250 million refugees

77
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
in 2050.

78
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I always show my pictures in the street.

79
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
We have done already 100 exhibitions in the cities.

80
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
But how to understand the world

81
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
without the voice of people?

82
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Landscape was not enough.

83
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
It was obvious to me to do another work.

84
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I launched a project named Six Billion Others.

85
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I sent around the world six cameramen

86
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
asking the same question,

87
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
the same crucial question,

88
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
about life.

89
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
We have done five thousand interviews.

90
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I'm going to show you this.

91
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Man: The most beautiful thing that has happened to me in life?

92
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
It's when my dad told me, "Here, I give you this girl as your fiance."

93
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Woman: Love? Love is nice if you can have it.

94
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Second Man: Romeo and Juliet, Sassi and Panno, Dodi and Diana, Heer and Ranjha,

95
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
this is love! Third Man: My greatest fear is ...

96
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Woman: You're asking me a hard question.

97
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Fourth Man: I live happily because what else should I do?

98
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Fifth Man: The first thing I remember ... (Sixth Man: That's how I learned, by my mother,)

99
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Fifth Man: ... from my childhood, (Sixth Man: that you should respect humans.)

100
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Fifth Man: we were having fun, biking. (Sixth Man: I will never forget those words.)

101
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Seventh Man: We invented stories, we flew around the world, while remaining in our attic.

102
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Eighth Man: I had a big laugh today.

103
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Ninth Man: You see, family is ... it's awful.

104
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
10th Man: In the word life, you have the life.

105
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
11th Man: Who am I? Isn't that the biggest question?

106
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
12th Man: If I was to go back to Iraq

107
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and speak to the people,

108
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I'd have to bow down and kiss their feet.

109
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Just as that woman tried to kiss my feet

110
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
when we were taking her sons.

111
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I feel ashamed.

112
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And I feel humbled

113
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
by their strength.

114
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And I will forever feel a need

115
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
to make reparations to Iraq.

116
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Second Woman: Dad, Mom, I grew up.

117
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
You shouldn't worry about me. Dad doesn't need to go to work.

118
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
My family ... What can I say?

119
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
At the moment, my family is very poor,

120
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
my life here in Shenzhen is just about showing myself that I can earn more

121
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and to let my parents stay and have something to live on.

122
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I don't want them to spend their whole lives in poverty.

123
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
If someday I can achieve something, I would like to say thank you daddy and mommy.

124
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Thank you.

125
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Thank you for having fed me and raised me,

126
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and for making my life of today. Thank you.

127
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
13th Man: After seven years now of being in a wheelchair,

128
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I've done more in life being in a chair

129
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
than out of a chair.

130
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I still surf. I sail the world. I freedive.

131
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
After many people said I couldn't do that.

132
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And I think that comes from connecting with nature,

133
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
connecting with the energy of life,

134
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
because we're all disabled in some way on the planet --

135
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
spiritually, mentally or physically.

136
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
I got the easy part.

137
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
14th Man: Let's say that you and me like each other.

138
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
You come from elsewhere.

139
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
You don't know me. I don't know you.

140
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
We talk without lying.

141
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
If I do like you, I give you one cow and many other things

142
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and we become friends.

143
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
How can we make it all by ourselves?

144
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
(Applause)

145
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
YAB: You can also go to the website,

146
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
answer -- respond to the questions also.

147
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Forty crucial questions.

148
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Now I am going to speak to you about my movie.

149
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
For the last three years,

150
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I was shooting the earth for the movie.

151
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
The name of the movie is "Home" --

152
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
"Maison."

153
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
It is about the state of the planet.

154
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
It's a fantastic story of life on the earth.

155
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
I'm very proud to show you the teaser.

156
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Video: This Earth is four and a half billion years old.

157
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
These plants, several hundred million years old.

158
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And we humans have been walking upright

159
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
for only 200 thousand years.

160
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
We've managed to adapt,

161
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and have conquered the whole planet.

162
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
For generations, we've been raising our children,

163
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
not unlike millions of other species living beside us.

164
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
For the past 30 years

165
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I've been closely watching the earth and its dwellers

166
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
from high up in the sky.

167
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Our life is tied to the well-being of our planet.

168
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
We depend on water,

169
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
forests,

170
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
deserts,

171
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
oceans.

172
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Fishing,

173
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
breeding,

174
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
farming

175
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
are still the world's foremost human occupations.

176
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
And what binds us together

177
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
is far greater than what divides us.

178
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
We all share the same need for the earth's gifts --

179
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
the same wish to rise above ourselves,

180
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and become better.

181
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And yet we carry on raising walls

182
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
to keep us apart.

183
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Today our greatest battle

184
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
is to protect the natural offerings of our planet.

185
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
In less than 50 years

186
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
we've altered it more thoroughly

187
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
than in the entire history of mankind.

188
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Half of the world's forests have vanished.

189
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Water resources are running low.

190
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Intensive farming is depleting soils.

191
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Our energy sources are not sustainable.

192
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
The climate is changing.

193
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
We are endangering ourselves.

194
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
We're only trying to improve our lives.

195
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
But the wealth gaps are growing wider.

196
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
We haven't yet understood

197
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
that we're going at a much faster pace

198
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
than the planet can sustain.

199
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
We know that solutions are available today.

200
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
We all have the power to change this trend

201
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
for the better.

202
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
So what are we waiting for?

203
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
(Applause)

204
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
YAB: Luc Besson is the producer of the movie.

205
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
But it is not a normal movie.

206
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
The film is going to be distributed free.

207
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
This film has no copyright.

208
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
On the five of June,

209
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
the environment day,

210
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
everybody can download the movie on Internet.

211
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
The film is given for free

212
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
to the distributor for TV and theater

213
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:51,000
to show it the fifth of June.

214
0:13:51.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
There is no business on this movie.

215
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
It is also available for school,

216
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
cities, NGOs and you.

217
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
We have to believe what we know.

218
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Let me tell you something.

219
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
It's too late to be pessimistic --

220
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
really too late.

221
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
We have all a part of the solutions.

222
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
To finish,

223
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
I would like to welcome

224
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
the 4,700th baby

225
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
born since the beginning of this talk.

226
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Merci beaucoup. I love you.

227
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
(Applause)

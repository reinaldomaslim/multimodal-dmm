2
0:00:13.828,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Today I'm going to speak to you

3
0:00:15.472,000 --> 0:00:18,000
about the last 30 years of architectural history.

4
0:00:19.685,000 --> 0:00:21,000
That's a lot to pack into 18 minutes.

5
0:00:22.167,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It's a complex topic,

6
0:00:23.878,000 --> 0:00:27,000
so we're just going to dive right in at a complex place:

7
0:00:28.276,000 --> 0:00:29,000
New Jersey.

8
0:00:29.506,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Because 30 years ago, I'm from Jersey,

9
0:00:32.72,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and I was six, and I lived there in my parents' house

10
0:00:36.586,000 --> 0:00:37,000
in a town called Livingston,

11
0:00:38.234,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and this was my childhood bedroom.

12
0:00:41.689,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Around the corner from my bedroom

13
0:00:44.148,000 --> 0:00:46,000
was the bathroom that I used to share with my sister.

14
0:00:47.225,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And in between my bedroom and the bathroom

15
0:00:50.162,000 --> 0:00:52,000
was a balcony that overlooked the family room.

16
0:00:53.413,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And that's where everyone would hang out and watch TV,

17
0:00:57.119,000 --> 0:01:01,000
so that every time that I walked from my bedroom to the bathroom,

18
0:01:01.306,000 --> 0:01:02,000
everyone would see me,

19
0:01:02.666,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and every time I took a shower and would come back in a towel,

20
0:01:06.444,000 --> 0:01:07,000
everyone would see me.

21
0:01:08.162,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And I looked like this.

22
0:01:10.718,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I was awkward,

23
0:01:13.765,000 --> 0:01:15,000
insecure, and I hated it.

24
0:01:15.88,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I hated that walk, I hated that balcony,

25
0:01:18.943,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I hated that room, and I hated that house.

26
0:01:22.769,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And that's architecture.

27
0:01:24.917,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:26.258,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Done.

29
0:01:28.088,000 --> 0:01:31,000
That feeling, those emotions that I felt,

30
0:01:31.486,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that's the power of architecture,

31
0:01:34.203,000 --> 0:01:37,000
because architecture is not about math and it's not about zoning,

32
0:01:37.765,000 --> 0:01:4,000
it's about those visceral, emotional connections

33
0:01:41.147,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that we feel to the places that we occupy.

34
0:01:44.653,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And it's no surprise that we feel that way,

35
0:01:47.553,000 --> 0:01:49,000
because according to the EPA,

36
0:01:49.785,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Americans spend 90 percent of their time indoors.

37
0:01:54.428,000 --> 0:01:58,000
That's 90 percent of our time surrounded by architecture.

38
0:01:59.188,000 --> 0:02:,000
That's huge.

39
0:02:00.72,000 --> 0:02:04,000
That means that architecture is shaping us in ways that we didn't even realize.

40
0:02:05.922,000 --> 0:02:1,000
That makes us a little bit gullible and very, very predictable.

41
0:02:11.464,000 --> 0:02:13,000
It means that when I show you a building like this,

42
0:02:14.117,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I know what you think:

43
0:02:15.523,000 --> 0:02:18,000
You think "power" and "stability" and "democracy."

44
0:02:19.239,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And I know you think that because it's based on a building

45
0:02:22.896,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that was build 2,500 years ago by the Greeks.

46
0:02:26.272,000 --> 0:02:27,000
This is a trick.

47
0:02:27.912,000 --> 0:02:29,000
This is a trigger that architects use

48
0:02:30.104,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to get you to create an emotional connection

49
0:02:34.017,000 --> 0:02:36,000
to the forms that we build our buildings out of.

50
0:02:37.237,000 --> 0:02:39,000
It's a predictable emotional connection,

51
0:02:39.901,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and we've been using this trick for a long, long time.

52
0:02:43.629,000 --> 0:02:46,000
We used it [200] years ago to build banks.

53
0:02:46.926,000 --> 0:02:49,000
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.

54
0:02:50.107,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And in the 20th century in America,

55
0:02:52.336,000 --> 0:02:53,000
we used it to build houses.

56
0:02:54.195,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And look at these solid, stable little soldiers

57
0:02:56.957,000 --> 0:02:58,000
facing the ocean and keeping away the elements.

58
0:03:00.265,000 --> 0:03:02,000
This is really, really useful,

59
0:03:02.924,000 --> 0:03:04,000
because building things is terrifying.

60
0:03:06.331,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It's expensive, it takes a long time, and it's very complicated.

61
0:03:10.996,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And the people that build things --

62
0:03:13.178,000 --> 0:03:15,000
developers and governments --

63
0:03:15.407,000 --> 0:03:17,000
they're naturally afraid of innovation,

64
0:03:18.284,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and they'd rather just use those forms that they know you'll respond to.

65
0:03:23.125,000 --> 0:03:25,000
That's how we end up with buildings like this.

66
0:03:26.096,000 --> 0:03:27,000
This is a nice building.

67
0:03:27.79,000 --> 0:03:29,000
This is the Livingston Public Library

68
0:03:30.105,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that was completed in 2004 in my hometown,

69
0:03:33.239,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and, you know, it's got a dome

70
0:03:34.888,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and it's got this round thing and columns, red brick,

71
0:03:38.495,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and you can kind of guess what Livingston is trying to say with this building:

72
0:03:43.509,000 --> 0:03:46,000
children, property values and history.

73
0:03:47.751,000 --> 0:03:5,000
But it doesn't have much to do with what a library actually does today.

74
0:03:52.209,000 --> 0:03:56,000
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country,

75
0:03:56.297,000 --> 0:03:57,000
another library was completed,

76
0:03:58.316,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and it looks like this.

77
0:03:59.998,000 --> 0:04:,000
It's in Seattle.

78
0:04:02.14,000 --> 0:04:07,000
This library is about how we consume media in a digital age.

79
0:04:07.718,000 --> 0:04:1,000
It's about a new kind of public amenity for the city,

80
0:04:11.312,000 --> 0:04:13,000
a place to gather and read and share.

81
0:04:15.244,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So how is it possible

82
0:04:16.891,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that in the same year, in the same country,

83
0:04:20.328,000 --> 0:04:22,000
two buildings, both called libraries,

84
0:04:22.975,000 --> 0:04:23,000
look so completely different?

85
0:04:25.576,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And the answer is that architecture works on the principle of a pendulum.

86
0:04:31.501,000 --> 0:04:33,000
On the one side is innovation,

87
0:04:34.393,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and architects are constantly pushing, pushing for new technologies,

88
0:04:38.034,000 --> 0:04:41,000
new typologies, new solutions for the way that we live today.

89
0:04:41.886,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And we push and we push and we push

90
0:04:44.304,000 --> 0:04:46,000
until we completely alienate all of you.

91
0:04:46.927,000 --> 0:04:48,000
We wear all black, we get very depressed,

92
0:04:49.177,000 --> 0:04:51,000
you think we're adorable,

93
0:04:51.362,000 --> 0:04:54,000
we're dead inside because we've got no choice.

94
0:04:54.845,000 --> 0:04:55,000
We have to go to the other side

95
0:04:56.621,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and reengage those symbols that we know you love.

96
0:05:00.394,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So we do that, and you're happy,

97
0:05:02.577,000 --> 0:05:03,000
we feel like sellouts,

98
0:05:04.411,000 --> 0:05:05,000
so we start experimenting again

99
0:05:06.085,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and we push the pendulum back and back and forth and back and forth

100
0:05:09.303,000 --> 0:05:11,000
we've gone for the last 300 years,

101
0:05:11.702,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and certainly for the last 30 years.

102
0:05:14.926,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Okay, 30 years ago we were coming out of the '70s.

103
0:05:18.542,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Architects had been busy experimenting with something called brutalism.

104
0:05:22.519,000 --> 0:05:23,000
It's about concrete.

105
0:05:23.789,000 --> 0:05:24,000
(Laughter)

106
0:05:25.285,000 --> 0:05:26,000
You can guess this.

107
0:05:26.453,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Small windows, dehumanizing scale.

108
0:05:29.807,000 --> 0:05:31,000
This is really tough stuff.

109
0:05:32.594,000 --> 0:05:34,000
So as we get closer to the '80s,

110
0:05:35.381,000 --> 0:05:37,000
we start to reengage those symbols.

111
0:05:37.748,000 --> 0:05:39,000
We push the pendulum back into the other direction.

112
0:05:40.72,000 --> 0:05:42,000
We take these forms that we know you love

113
0:05:43.553,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and we update them.

114
0:05:45.142,000 --> 0:05:47,000
We add neon

115
0:05:47.175,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and we add pastels

116
0:05:49.463,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and we use new materials.

117
0:05:51.141,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And you love it.

118
0:05:52.603,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And we can't give you enough of it.

119
0:05:54.576,000 --> 0:05:56,000
We take Chippendale armoires

120
0:05:56.764,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and we turned those into skyscrapers,

121
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and skyscrapers can be medieval castles made out of glass.

122
0:06:04.409,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Forms got big,

123
0:06:05.985,000 --> 0:06:07,000
forms got bold and colorful.

124
0:06:08.536,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Dwarves became columns.

125
0:06:11.404,000 --> 0:06:12,000
(Laughter)

126
0:06:12.467,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Swans grew to the size of buildings.

127
0:06:14.597,000 --> 0:06:15,000
It was crazy.

128
0:06:16.64,000 --> 0:06:19,000
But it's the '80s, it's cool.

129
0:06:20.537,000 --> 0:06:21,000
(Laughter)

130
0:06:21.739,000 --> 0:06:22,000
We're all hanging out in malls

131
0:06:23.757,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and we're all moving to the suburbs,

132
0:06:26.162,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and out there, out in the suburbs,

133
0:06:28.76,000 --> 0:06:31,000
we can create our own architectural fantasies.

134
0:06:32.116,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And those fantasies,

135
0:06:33.894,000 --> 0:06:35,000
they can be Mediterranean

136
0:06:35.981,000 --> 0:06:36,000
or French

137
0:06:37.93,000 --> 0:06:38,000
or Italian.

138
0:06:39.154,000 --> 0:06:4,000
(Laughter)

139
0:06:40.821,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Possibly with endless breadsticks.

140
0:06:42.738,000 --> 0:06:44,000
This is the thing about postmodernism.

141
0:06:44.788,000 --> 0:06:45,000
This is the thing about symbols.

142
0:06:46.908,000 --> 0:06:48,000
They're easy, they're cheap,

143
0:06:49.912,000 --> 0:06:51,000
because instead of making places,

144
0:06:52.441,000 --> 0:06:54,000
we're making memories of places.

145
0:06:55.091,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Because I know, and I know all of you know,

146
0:06:57.971,000 --> 0:06:58,000
this isn't Tuscany.

147
0:07:00.182,000 --> 0:07:01,000
This is Ohio.

148
0:07:01.452,000 --> 0:07:02,000
(Laughter)

149
0:07:02.994,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So architects get frustrated,

150
0:07:04.843,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and we start pushing the pendulum back into the other direction.

151
0:07:08.559,000 --> 0:07:1,000
In the late '80s and early '90s,

152
0:07:10.81,000 --> 0:07:13,000
we start experimenting with something called deconstructivism.

153
0:07:14.727,000 --> 0:07:16,000
We throw out historical symbols,

154
0:07:17.497,000 --> 0:07:2,000
we rely on new, computer-aided design techniques,

155
0:07:21.367,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and we come up with new compositions,

156
0:07:23.348,000 --> 0:07:25,000
forms crashing into forms.

157
0:07:26.228,000 --> 0:07:29,000
This is academic and heady stuff,

158
0:07:29.275,000 --> 0:07:3,000
it's super unpopular,

159
0:07:31.15,000 --> 0:07:32,000
we totally alienate you.

160
0:07:32.837,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Ordinarily, the pendulum would just swing back into the other direction.

161
0:07:37.048,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And then, something amazing happened.

162
0:07:40.331,000 --> 0:07:42,000
In 1997, this building opened.

163
0:07:43.898,000 --> 0:07:45,000
This is the Guggenheim Bilbao, by Frank Gehry.

164
0:07:48.228,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And this building

165
0:07:49.656,000 --> 0:07:53,000
fundamentally changes the world's relationship to architecture.

166
0:07:54.694,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Paul Goldberger said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments

167
0:07:58.618,000 --> 0:08:01,000
when critics, academics, and the general public

168
0:08:01.945,000 --> 0:08:03,000
were completely united around a building.

169
0:08:05.401,000 --> 0:08:08,000
The New York Times called this building a miracle.

170
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Tourism in Bilbao increased 2,500 percent

171
0:08:14.866,000 --> 0:08:15,000
after this building was completed.

172
0:08:16.885,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So all of a sudden, everybody wants one of these buildings:

173
0:08:21.044,000 --> 0:08:22,000
L.A.,

174
0:08:23.633,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Seattle,

175
0:08:25.196,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Chicago,

176
0:08:26.824,000 --> 0:08:27,000
New York,

177
0:08:28.552,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Cleveland,

178
0:08:30.47,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Springfield.

179
0:08:31.737,000 --> 0:08:32,000
(Laughter)

180
0:08:32.795,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Everybody wants one, and Gehry is everywhere.

181
0:08:36.042,000 --> 0:08:39,000
He is our very first starchitect.

182
0:08:39.989,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Now, how is it possible that these forms --

183
0:08:44.889,000 --> 0:08:45,000
they're wild and radical --

184
0:08:46.818,000 --> 0:08:49,000
how is it possible that they become so ubiquitous throughout the world?

185
0:08:51.27,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And it happened because media so successfully galvanized around them

186
0:08:56.79,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that they quickly taught us that these forms mean culture and tourism.

187
0:09:03.068,000 --> 0:09:06,000
We created an emotional reaction to these forms.

188
0:09:06.49,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So did every mayor in the world.

189
0:09:08.967,000 --> 0:09:1,000
So every mayor knew that if they had these forms,

190
0:09:11.493,000 --> 0:09:13,000
they had culture and tourism.

191
0:09:15.778,000 --> 0:09:17,000
This phenomenon at the turn of the new millennium

192
0:09:18.134,000 --> 0:09:2,000
happened to a few other starchitects.

193
0:09:20.288,000 --> 0:09:22,000
It happened to Zaha

194
0:09:22.695,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and it happened to Libeskind,

195
0:09:25.118,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and what happened to these elite few architects

196
0:09:29.756,000 --> 0:09:3,000
at the turn of the new millennium

197
0:09:31.536,000 --> 0:09:34,000
could actually start to happen to the entire field of architecture,

198
0:09:35.237,000 --> 0:09:38,000
as digital media starts to increase the speed

199
0:09:38.499,000 --> 0:09:39,000
with which we consume information.

200
0:09:41.096,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Because think about how you consume architecture.

201
0:09:44.429,000 --> 0:09:45,000
A thousand years ago,

202
0:09:45.668,000 --> 0:09:48,000
you would have had to have walked to the village next door to see a building.

203
0:09:49.488,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Transportation speeds up:

204
0:09:51.142,000 --> 0:09:54,000
You can take a boat, you can take a plane, you can be a tourist.

205
0:09:54.166,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Technology speeds up: You can see it in a newspaper, on TV,

206
0:09:57.087,000 --> 0:10:01,000
until finally, we are all architectural photographers,

207
0:10:01.974,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and the building has become disembodied from the site.

208
0:10:06.768,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Architecture is everywhere now,

209
0:10:10.339,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and that means that the speed of communication

210
0:10:13.477,000 --> 0:10:16,000
has finally caught up to the speed of architecture.

211
0:10:17.409,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Because architecture actually moves quite quickly.

212
0:10:19.903,000 --> 0:10:21,000
It doesn't take long to think about a building.

213
0:10:22.635,000 --> 0:10:24,000
It takes a long time to build a building,

214
0:10:24.812,000 --> 0:10:26,000
three or four years,

215
0:10:27.13,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and in the interim, an architect will design two or eight

216
0:10:30.822,000 --> 0:10:32,000
or a hundred other buildings

217
0:10:33.492,000 --> 0:10:36,000
before they know if that building that they designed four years ago

218
0:10:37.207,000 --> 0:10:38,000
was a success or not.

219
0:10:39.69,000 --> 0:10:42,000
That's because there's never been a good feedback loop in architecture.

220
0:10:44.416,000 --> 0:10:46,000
That's how we end up with buildings like this.

221
0:10:47.332,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Brutalism wasn't a two-year movement,

222
0:10:50.296,000 --> 0:10:51,000
it was a 20-year movement.

223
0:10:52.383,000 --> 0:10:55,000
For 20 years, we were producing buildings like this

224
0:10:56.225,000 --> 0:10:58,000
because we had no idea how much you hated it.

225
0:11:00.284,000 --> 0:11:02,000
It's never going to happen again,

226
0:11:03.108,000 --> 0:11:05,000
I think,

227
0:11:05.262,000 --> 0:11:11,000
because we are living on the verge of the greatest revolution in architecture

228
0:11:11.386,000 --> 0:11:13,000
since the invention of concrete,

229
0:11:13.779,000 --> 0:11:15,000
of steel, or of the elevator,

230
0:11:16.257,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and it's a media revolution.

231
0:11:19.072,000 --> 0:11:23,000
So my theory is that when you apply media to this pendulum,

232
0:11:23.756,000 --> 0:11:25,000
it starts swinging faster and faster,

233
0:11:26.641,000 --> 0:11:29,000
until it's at both extremes nearly simultaneously,

234
0:11:30.403,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and that effectively blurs the difference between innovation and symbol,

235
0:11:35.395,000 --> 0:11:38,000
between us, the architects, and you, the public.

236
0:11:39.342,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Now we can make nearly instantaneous, emotionally charged symbols

237
0:11:45.426,000 --> 0:11:46,000
out of something that's brand new.

238
0:11:48.453,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Let me show you how this plays out

239
0:11:50.21,000 --> 0:11:52,000
in a project that my firm recently completed.

240
0:11:52.829,000 --> 0:11:55,000
We were hired to replace this building, which burned down.

241
0:11:56.304,000 --> 0:11:58,000
This is the center of a town called the Pines

242
0:11:58.797,000 --> 0:11:59,000
in Fire Island in New York State.

243
0:12:00.567,000 --> 0:12:01,000
It's a vacation community.

244
0:12:02.729,000 --> 0:12:05,000
We proposed a building that was audacious,

245
0:12:06.506,000 --> 0:12:09,000
that was different than any of the forms that the community was used to,

246
0:12:10.181,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and we were scared and our client was scared

247
0:12:14.726,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and the community was scared,

248
0:12:16.513,000 --> 0:12:2,000
so we created a series of photorealistic renderings

249
0:12:20.693,000 --> 0:12:21,000
that we put onto Facebook

250
0:12:22.095,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and we put onto Instagram,

251
0:12:24.245,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and we let people start to do what they do:

252
0:12:26.59,000 --> 0:12:28,000
share it, comment, like it, hate it.

253
0:12:30.232,000 --> 0:12:34,000
But that meant that two years before the building was complete,

254
0:12:34.586,000 --> 0:12:37,000
it was already a part of the community,

255
0:12:37.938,000 --> 0:12:43,000
so that when the renderings looked exactly like the finished product,

256
0:12:44.228,000 --> 0:12:45,000
there were no surprises.

257
0:12:46.212,000 --> 0:12:49,000
This building was already a part of this community,

258
0:12:50.124,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and then that first summer,

259
0:12:52.433,000 --> 0:12:55,000
when people started arriving and sharing the building on social media,

260
0:12:56.375,000 --> 0:13:01,000
the building ceased to be just an edifice and it became media,

261
0:13:01.886,000 --> 0:13:04,000
because these, these are not just pictures of a building,

262
0:13:05.693,000 --> 0:13:07,000
they're your pictures of a building.

263
0:13:08.527,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And as you use them to tell your story,

264
0:13:11.838,000 --> 0:13:13,000
they become part of your personal narrative,

265
0:13:14.57,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and what you're doing is you're short-circuiting

266
0:13:18.142,000 --> 0:13:2,000
all of our collective memory,

267
0:13:20.416,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and you're making these charged symbols for us to understand.

268
0:13:25.187,000 --> 0:13:27,000
That means we don't need the Greeks anymore

269
0:13:27.5,000 --> 0:13:29,000
to tell us what to think about architecture.

270
0:13:30.142,000 --> 0:13:34,000
We can tell each other what we think about architecture,

271
0:13:34.191,000 --> 0:13:39,000
because digital media hasn't just changed the relationship between all of us,

272
0:13:39.986,000 --> 0:13:42,000
it's changed the relationship between us and buildings.

273
0:13:44.614,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Think for a second about those librarians back in Livingston.

274
0:13:48.39,000 --> 0:13:5,000
If that building was going to be built today,

275
0:13:50.829,000 --> 0:13:54,000
the first thing they would do is go online and search "new libraries."

276
0:13:55.705,000 --> 0:14:,000
They would be bombarded by examples of experimentation, of innovation,

277
0:14:00.999,000 --> 0:14:03,000
of pushing at the envelope of what a library can be.

278
0:14:04.998,000 --> 0:14:05,000
That's ammunition.

279
0:14:06.846,000 --> 0:14:08,000
That's ammunition that they can take with them

280
0:14:09.205,000 --> 0:14:12,000
to the mayor of Livingston, to the people of Livingston,

281
0:14:12.354,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and say, there's no one answer to what a library is today.

282
0:14:16.337,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Let's be a part of this.

283
0:14:18.287,000 --> 0:14:2,000
This abundance of experimentation

284
0:14:21.177,000 --> 0:14:24,000
gives them the freedom to run their own experiment.

285
0:14:26.452,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Everything is different now.

286
0:14:28.664,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Architects are no longer these mysterious creatures

287
0:14:32.043,000 --> 0:14:34,000
that use big words and complicated drawings,

288
0:14:34.562,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and you aren't the hapless public,

289
0:14:37.546,000 --> 0:14:4,000
the consumer that won't accept anything that they haven't seen anymore.

290
0:14:42.98,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Architects can hear you,

291
0:14:44.737,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and you're not intimidated by architecture.

292
0:14:47.77,000 --> 0:14:5,000
That means that that pendulum swinging back and forth

293
0:14:51.176,000 --> 0:14:53,000
from style to style, from movement to movement,

294
0:14:54.178,000 --> 0:14:55,000
is irrelevant.

295
0:14:55.68,000 --> 0:14:57,000
We can actually move forward

296
0:14:58.304,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and find relevant solutions to the problems that our society faces.

297
0:15:03.757,000 --> 0:15:06,000
This is the end of architectural history,

298
0:15:07.223,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and it means that the buildings of tomorrow

299
0:15:10.115,000 --> 0:15:13,000
are going to look a lot different than the buildings of today.

300
0:15:14.389,000 --> 0:15:18,000
It means that a public space in the ancient city of Seville

301
0:15:18.821,000 --> 0:15:22,000
can be unique and tailored to the way that a modern city works.

302
0:15:23.992,000 --> 0:15:27,000
It means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be a stadium in Brooklyn,

303
0:15:28.435,000 --> 0:15:3,000
not some red-brick historical pastiche

304
0:15:31.221,000 --> 0:15:33,000
of what we think a stadium ought to be.

305
0:15:34.54,000 --> 0:15:36,000
It means that robots are going to build our buildings,

306
0:15:37.397,000 --> 0:15:4,000
because we're finally ready for the forms that they're going to produce.

307
0:15:41.842,000 --> 0:15:44,000
And it means that buildings will twist to the whims of nature

308
0:15:45.717,000 --> 0:15:46,000
instead of the other way around.

309
0:15:48.676,000 --> 0:15:51,000
It means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida,

310
0:15:52.304,000 --> 0:15:54,000
can also be a place for sports

311
0:15:54.812,000 --> 0:15:55,000
and for yoga

312
0:15:56.215,000 --> 0:15:58,000
and you can even get married there late at night.

313
0:15:58.818,000 --> 0:15:59,000
(Laughter)

314
0:15:59.866,000 --> 0:16:03,000
It means that three architects can dream about swimming

315
0:16:04.053,000 --> 0:16:05,000
in the East River of New York,

316
0:16:05.997,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and then raise nearly half a million dollars

317
0:16:08.511,000 --> 0:16:11,000
from a community that gathered around their cause,

318
0:16:11.863,000 --> 0:16:12,000
no one client anymore.

319
0:16:14.765,000 --> 0:16:16,000
It means that no building is too small for innovation,

320
0:16:17.69,000 --> 0:16:19,000
like this little reindeer pavilion

321
0:16:19.912,000 --> 0:16:24,000
that's as muscly and sinewy as the animals it's designed to observe.

322
0:16:25.808,000 --> 0:16:27,000
And it means that a building doesn't have to be beautiful

323
0:16:28.57,000 --> 0:16:29,000
to be lovable,

324
0:16:29.887,000 --> 0:16:32,000
like this ugly little building in Spain,

325
0:16:32.926,000 --> 0:16:34,000
where the architects dug a hole,

326
0:16:35.431,000 --> 0:16:36,000
packed it with hay,

327
0:16:36.837,000 --> 0:16:38,000
and then poured concrete around it,

328
0:16:39.194,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and when the concrete dried,

329
0:16:40.858,000 --> 0:16:43,000
they invited someone to come and clean that hay out

330
0:16:44.442,000 --> 0:16:46,000
so that all that's left when it's done

331
0:16:47.397,000 --> 0:16:49,000
is this hideous little room

332
0:16:50.096,000 --> 0:16:55,000
that's filled with the imprints and scratches of how that place was made,

333
0:16:56.074,000 --> 0:17:,000
and that becomes the most sublime place to watch a Spanish sunset.

334
0:17:01.658,000 --> 0:17:04,000
Because it doesn't matter if a cow builds our buildings

335
0:17:05.037,000 --> 0:17:06,000
or a robot builds our buildings.

336
0:17:06.871,000 --> 0:17:09,000
It doesn't matter how we build, it matters what we build.

337
0:17:10.899,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Architects already know how to make buildings that are greener

338
0:17:14.348,000 --> 0:17:16,000
and smarter and friendlier.

339
0:17:16.53,000 --> 0:17:18,000
We've just been waiting for all of you to want them.

340
0:17:20.022,000 --> 0:17:23,000
And finally, we're not on opposite sides anymore.

341
0:17:23.957,000 --> 0:17:25,000
Find an architect, hire an architect,

342
0:17:26.953,000 --> 0:17:31,000
work with us to design better buildings, better cities, and a better world,

343
0:17:32.794,000 --> 0:17:34,000
because the stakes are high.

344
0:17:35.635,000 --> 0:17:4,000
Buildings don't just reflect our society, they shape our society

345
0:17:40.849,000 --> 0:17:42,000
down to the smallest spaces:

346
0:17:42.925,000 --> 0:17:44,000
the local libraries,

347
0:17:44.953,000 --> 0:17:46,000
the homes where we raise our children,

348
0:17:47.406,000 --> 0:17:5,000
and the walk that they take from the bedroom to the bathroom.

349
0:17:51.288,000 --> 0:17:52,000
Thank you.

350
0:17:52.412,000 --> 0:17:55,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.76,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I'm a bug lover, myself --

2
0:00:17.783,000 --> 0:00:18,000
not from childhood, by the way,

3
0:00:19.56,000 --> 0:00:2,000
but rather late.

4
0:00:22.157,000 --> 0:00:23,000
When I bachelored,

5
0:00:23.56,000 --> 0:00:25,000
majoring in zoology at Tel Aviv University,

6
0:00:26.277,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I kind of fell in love with bugs.

7
0:00:28.438,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And then, within zoology,

8
0:00:30.2,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I took the course or the discipline of entomology,

9
0:00:33.364,000 --> 0:00:35,000
the science of insects.

10
0:00:36.004,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And then I thought to myself, how can I be practical

11
0:00:39.226,000 --> 0:00:41,000
or help in the science of entomology?

12
0:00:42.56,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And then I moved to the world of plant protection --

13
0:00:45.817,000 --> 0:00:47,000
plant protection from insects,

14
0:00:48.343,000 --> 0:00:49,000
from bad bugs.

15
0:00:50.181,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And then within plant protection,

16
0:00:52.56,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I came into the discipline of biological pest control,

17
0:00:56.845,000 --> 0:00:57,000
which we actually define

18
0:00:58.559,000 --> 0:01:,000
as the use of living organisms

19
0:01:01.56,000 --> 0:01:05,000
to reduce populations of noxious plant pests.

20
0:01:06.084,000 --> 0:01:09,000
So it's a whole discipline in plant protection

21
0:01:09.21,000 --> 0:01:12,000
aimed at the reduction of chemicals.

22
0:01:13.456,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And biological pest control, by the way,

23
0:01:15.526,000 --> 0:01:17,000
or these "good bugs" that we are talking about,

24
0:01:18.318,000 --> 0:01:21,000
they've existed in the world for thousands and thousands of years,

25
0:01:22.174,000 --> 0:01:23,000
for a long, long time.

26
0:01:23.801,000 --> 0:01:26,000
But only in the last 120 years,

27
0:01:27.488,000 --> 0:01:3,000
people started, or people knew more and more

28
0:01:30.902,000 --> 0:01:34,000
how to exploit, or how to use, this biological control phenomenon,

29
0:01:35.312,000 --> 0:01:38,000
or in fact, natural control phenomenon,

30
0:01:38.716,000 --> 0:01:4,000
for their own needs.

31
0:01:41.44,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Because biological control phenomenon -- you can see it in your backyard.

32
0:01:45.072,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Just take a magnifying glass. You see what I have here?

33
0:01:48.052,000 --> 0:01:52,000
That's a magnifier, times 10.

34
0:01:52.09,000 --> 0:01:54,000
You just open it, twist leaves,

35
0:01:55.112,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and you see a whole new world of minute insects,

36
0:01:58.56,000 --> 0:02:02,000
or little spiders of one millimeter, one-and-a-half, two millimeters long,

37
0:02:03.56,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and you can distinguish between the good ones and the bad ones.

38
0:02:06.584,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So this phenomenon of natural control exists literally everywhere.

39
0:02:11.148,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Here, in front of this building, I'm sure.

40
0:02:13.226,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Just have a look at the plants.

41
0:02:15.165,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So it's everywhere, and we need to know how to exploit it.

42
0:02:19.329,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Well, let's go hand by hand

43
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and browse through just a few examples.

44
0:02:24.56,000 --> 0:02:25,000
What is a pest?

45
0:02:26.099,000 --> 0:02:29,000
What damage does it actually inflict on the plant?

46
0:02:29.433,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And what is the natural enemy,

47
0:02:31.718,000 --> 0:02:33,000
the biological control agent, or the "good bug"

48
0:02:34.725,000 --> 0:02:35,000
that we're talking about?

49
0:02:35.95,000 --> 0:02:4,000
In general, I'm going to talk about insects and spiders,

50
0:02:40.987,000 --> 0:02:42,000
or mites, let us call them.

51
0:02:43.234,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Insects, those six-legged organisms

52
0:02:46.027,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and spiders or mites, the eight-legged organisms.

53
0:02:50.129,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Let's have a look at that.

54
0:02:51.56,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Here is a devastating pest, a spider mite,

55
0:02:54.812,000 --> 0:02:56,000
because it does a lot of webbing, like a spider.

56
0:02:58.06,000 --> 0:02:59,000
You see the mother in between,

57
0:02:59.606,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and two daughters, probably, on the left and right,

58
0:03:02.04,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and a single egg on the right-hand side.

59
0:03:04.132,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And then you see what kind of damage it can inflict.

60
0:03:06.644,000 --> 0:03:08,000
On your right-hand side, you can see a cucumber leaf,

61
0:03:09.21,000 --> 0:03:1,000
in the middle, a cotton leaf,

62
0:03:10.675,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and on the left, a tomato leaf with these little stipplings.

63
0:03:13.897,000 --> 0:03:16,000
They can literally turn from green to white,

64
0:03:16.974,000 --> 0:03:21,000
because of the sucking, piercing mouth parts of those spiders.

65
0:03:23.018,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But here comes nature, that provides us with a good spider.

66
0:03:26.712,000 --> 0:03:29,000
This is a predatory mite -- just as small as a spider mite;

67
0:03:30.118,000 --> 0:03:32,000
one, two millimeters long, not more than that --

68
0:03:32.946,000 --> 0:03:36,000
running quickly, hunting, chasing the spider mites.

69
0:03:37.384,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And here, you can see this lady in action on your left-hand side --

70
0:03:41.276,000 --> 0:03:46,000
just pierces, sucks the body fluids on the left-hand side of the pest mite.

71
0:03:46.926,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And after five minutes, this is what you see:

72
0:03:49.56,000 --> 0:03:51,000
just a typical dead corpse --

73
0:03:51.903,000 --> 0:03:54,000
the shriveled, sucked-out, dead corpse of the spider mite,

74
0:03:55.56,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and next to it, two satiated individuals, predatory mites,

75
0:04:00.448,000 --> 0:04:03,000
a mother on the left-hand side, a young nymph on the right-hand side.

76
0:04:03.969,000 --> 0:04:05,000
By the way, a meal for them for 24 hours,

77
0:04:06.915,000 --> 0:04:1,000
is about five of the spider mites, of the bad mites,

78
0:04:11.189,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and-or 15 to 20 eggs of the pest mites.

79
0:04:16.098,000 --> 0:04:18,000
By the way, they are always hungry.

80
0:04:18.56,000 --> 0:04:2,000
(Laughter)

81
0:04:20.823,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And here is another example: aphids.

82
0:04:23.154,000 --> 0:04:24,000
It's springtime now in Israel.

83
0:04:25.032,000 --> 0:04:27,000
When temperatures rise sharply,

84
0:04:27.561,000 --> 0:04:3,000
you can see those bad ones, those aphids, all over the plants --

85
0:04:30.858,000 --> 0:04:32,000
in your hibiscus, in your lantana,

86
0:04:33.56,000 --> 0:04:36,000
in the young, fresh foliage of the so-called spring flush.

87
0:04:37.56,000 --> 0:04:4,000
By the way, with aphids you have only females, like Amazons.

88
0:04:41.56,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Females giving rise to females, giving rise to other females.

89
0:04:45.009,000 --> 0:04:46,000
No males at all.

90
0:04:46.262,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Parthenogenesis, as it's so called.

91
0:04:48.722,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And they're very happy with that, apparently.

92
0:04:50.861,000 --> 0:04:51,000
(Laughter)

93
0:04:51.91,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Here we can see the damage.

94
0:04:53.56,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Those aphids secrete a sticky, sugary liquid called honeydew,

95
0:05:00.344,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and this just clogs the upper parts of the plant.

96
0:05:04.387,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Here you see a typical cucumber leaf that turned from green to black

97
0:05:08.124,000 --> 0:05:12,000
because of a black fungus, sooty mold, which is covering it.

98
0:05:12.867,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And here comes the salvation, through this parasitic wasp.

99
0:05:18.219,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Here we are not talking about a predator.

100
0:05:20.345,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Here we are talking a parasite --

101
0:05:22.833,000 --> 0:05:23,000
not a two-legged parasite,

102
0:05:24.73,000 --> 0:05:27,000
but an eight-legged parasite, of course.

103
0:05:27.763,000 --> 0:05:28,000
This is a parasitic wasp,

104
0:05:29.561,000 --> 0:05:34,000
again, two millimeters long, slender, a very quick and sharp flier.

105
0:05:35.34,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And here you can see this parasite in action,

106
0:05:38.148,000 --> 0:05:4,000
like in an acrobatic maneuver.

107
0:05:40.839,000 --> 0:05:41,000
She stands vis-à-vis

108
0:05:42.56,000 --> 0:05:44,000
in front of the victim at the right-hand side,

109
0:05:44.911,000 --> 0:05:49,000
bending its abdomen and inserting a single egg

110
0:05:50.109,000 --> 0:05:52,000
into the body fluids of the aphid.

111
0:05:52.898,000 --> 0:05:54,000
By the way, the aphid tries to escape.

112
0:05:55.079,000 --> 0:05:59,000
She kicks and bites and secretes different liquids,

113
0:05:59.362,000 --> 0:06:01,000
but nothing will happen, in fact --

114
0:06:01.436,000 --> 0:06:04,000
only the egg of the parasitoid will be inserted

115
0:06:04.87,000 --> 0:06:06,000
into the body fluids of the aphid.

116
0:06:07.032,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And after a few days, depending upon temperature,

117
0:06:09.992,000 --> 0:06:1,000
the egg will hatch

118
0:06:11.433,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and the larva of this parasite will eat the aphid from the inside.

119
0:06:16.428,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(Laughter)

120
0:06:17.503,000 --> 0:06:19,000
This is all natural. This is all natural.

121
0:06:19.771,000 --> 0:06:2,000
This is not fiction, nothing at all.

122
0:06:21.794,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Again -- in your backyard. In your backyard.

123
0:06:24.769,000 --> 0:06:25,000
(Laughter)

124
0:06:26.298,000 --> 0:06:27,000
(Applause)

125
0:06:27.787,000 --> 0:06:33,000
But this is the end result: mummies.

126
0:06:34.354,000 --> 0:06:39,000
This is the visual result of a dead aphid encompassing inside,

127
0:06:39.56,000 --> 0:06:44,000
a developing parasitoid that, after a few minutes, you see halfway out.

128
0:06:45.479,000 --> 0:06:47,000
The birth is almost complete.

129
0:06:47.709,000 --> 0:06:5,000
You can see, by the way, in different movies, etc.,

130
0:06:50.907,000 --> 0:06:51,000
it takes just a few minutes.

131
0:06:52.56,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And if this is a female, she'll immediately mate with a male

132
0:06:56.086,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and off she goes, because time is very short.

133
0:06:58.946,000 --> 0:07:,000
This female can live only three to four days,

134
0:07:01.56,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and she needs to give rise to around 400 eggs.

135
0:07:05.446,000 --> 0:07:08,000
That means she has 400 bad aphids

136
0:07:08.872,000 --> 0:07:1,000
to put her eggs into their body fluids.

137
0:07:12.464,000 --> 0:07:13,000
This is, of course, not the end of it.

138
0:07:14.464,000 --> 0:07:16,000
There is a whole wealth of other natural enemies

139
0:07:16.87,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and this is just the last example.

140
0:07:18.56,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Again, we'll start first with the pest:

141
0:07:21.077,000 --> 0:07:22,000
the thrips.

142
0:07:22.56,000 --> 0:07:24,000
By the way, all these weird names --

143
0:07:24.887,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I didn't bother you with the Latin names of these creatures,

144
0:07:28.41,000 --> 0:07:29,000
just the popular names.

145
0:07:29.674,000 --> 0:07:33,000
But this is a nice, slender, very bad pest.

146
0:07:33.81,000 --> 0:07:35,000
If you can see this: sweet peppers.

147
0:07:36.182,000 --> 0:07:38,000
This is not just an exotic, ornamental sweet pepper.

148
0:07:39.205,000 --> 0:07:41,000
This is a sweet pepper which is not consumable

149
0:07:41.776,000 --> 0:07:43,000
because it is suffering from a viral disease

150
0:07:44.56,000 --> 0:07:47,000
transmitted by those thrip adults.

151
0:07:48.17,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And here comes the natural enemy, minute pirate bug --

152
0:07:51.711,000 --> 0:07:53,000
"minute," because it is rather small.

153
0:07:54.314,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Here you can see the adult, black, and two young ones.

154
0:07:57.757,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And again, in action.

155
0:07:59.326,000 --> 0:08:01,000
This adult pierces the thrips,

156
0:08:02.874,000 --> 0:08:04,000
sucking it within just several minutes,

157
0:08:05.144,000 --> 0:08:08,000
going to the other prey, continuing all over the place.

158
0:08:08.398,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And if we spread those minute pirate bugs, the good ones,

159
0:08:12.717,000 --> 0:08:14,000
for example, in a sweet pepper plot,

160
0:08:15.637,000 --> 0:08:16,000
they go to the flowers.

161
0:08:17.23,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And look -- this flower is flooded with predatory bugs, with the good ones,

162
0:08:22.338,000 --> 0:08:25,000
after wiping out the bad ones, the thrips.

163
0:08:25.56,000 --> 0:08:27,000
So this is a very positive situation.

164
0:08:28.168,000 --> 0:08:31,000
No harm to the developing fruit. No harm to the fruit set.

165
0:08:31.492,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Everything is just fine under these circumstances.

166
0:08:35.305,000 --> 0:08:36,000
But again, the question is,

167
0:08:36.79,000 --> 0:08:4,000
here you saw them on a one-to-one basis -- the pest, the natural enemy.

168
0:08:41.357,000 --> 0:08:43,000
What we do is actually this.

169
0:08:44.804,000 --> 0:08:47,000
In Northeast Israel, in Kibbutz Sde Eliyahu,

170
0:08:48.257,000 --> 0:08:52,000
there is a facility that mass-produces those natural enemies.

171
0:08:52.971,000 --> 0:08:58,000
In other words, what we do there is amplify the natural control,

172
0:08:59.473,000 --> 0:09:,000
or the biological control phenomenon.

173
0:09:01.474,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And in 30,000 square meters of state-of-the-art greenhouses,

174
0:09:06.375,000 --> 0:09:09,000
there, we are mass-producing those predatory mites,

175
0:09:09.703,000 --> 0:09:1,000
those minute pirate bugs,

176
0:09:11.422,000 --> 0:09:13,000
those parasitic wasps, etc.

177
0:09:14.342,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Many different parts.

178
0:09:15.693,000 --> 0:09:17,000
By the way, they have a very nice landscape --

179
0:09:17.973,000 --> 0:09:19,000
you see the Jordanian Mountains on the one hand,

180
0:09:20.373,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and the Jordan Valley on the other hand,

181
0:09:22.374,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and a good, mild winter and a nice, hot summer,

182
0:09:26.451,000 --> 0:09:29,000
which is an excellent condition to mass-produce those creatures.

183
0:09:30.47,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And by the way, mass-production -- it is not genetic manipulation.

184
0:09:34.734,000 --> 0:09:38,000
There are no GMOs -- genetically modified organisms -- whatsoever.

185
0:09:38.805,000 --> 0:09:39,000
We take them from nature,

186
0:09:40.56,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and the only thing that we do is give them the optimal conditions,

187
0:09:44.881,000 --> 0:09:46,000
under the greenhouses or in the climate rooms,

188
0:09:47.56,000 --> 0:09:5,000
in order to proliferate, multiply and reproduce.

189
0:09:51.627,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And that's what we get.

190
0:09:53.342,000 --> 0:09:54,000
You see under a microscope.

191
0:09:55.223,000 --> 0:09:58,000
You see in the upper left corner? You see a single predatory mite.

192
0:09:58.391,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And this is the whole bunch of predatory mites.

193
0:10:01.81,000 --> 0:10:03,000
You see this ampul. You see this one.

194
0:10:04.154,000 --> 0:10:07,000
I have one gram of those predatory mites.

195
0:10:07.651,000 --> 0:10:1,000
One gram is 80,000 individuals.

196
0:10:11.763,000 --> 0:10:16,000
80,000 individuals are good enough to control one acre,

197
0:10:17.373,000 --> 0:10:18,000
4,000 square meters,

198
0:10:19.235,000 --> 0:10:2,000
of a strawberry plot

199
0:10:21.112,000 --> 0:10:23,000
against spider mites for the whole season

200
0:10:24.065,000 --> 0:10:25,000
of almost one year.

201
0:10:26.242,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And we can produce from this, believe you me,

202
0:10:29.814,000 --> 0:10:33,000
several dozens of kilograms on an annual basis.

203
0:10:34.24,000 --> 0:10:38,000
So this is what I call amplification of the phenomenon.

204
0:10:38.472,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And no, we do not disrupt the balance.

205
0:10:42.295,000 --> 0:10:43,000
On the contrary,

206
0:10:43.56,000 --> 0:10:45,000
because we bring it to every cultural plot

207
0:10:46.467,000 --> 0:10:48,000
where the balance was already disrupted

208
0:10:49.244,000 --> 0:10:5,000
by the chemicals.

209
0:10:50.56,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Here we come with those natural enemies

210
0:10:52.461,000 --> 0:10:54,000
in order to reverse a little bit of the wheel

211
0:10:55.392,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and to bring more natural balance to the agricultural plot

212
0:10:59.398,000 --> 0:11:,000
by reducing those chemicals.

213
0:11:01.263,000 --> 0:11:02,000
That's the whole idea.

214
0:11:02.842,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And what is the impact?

215
0:11:04.304,000 --> 0:11:07,000
In this table, you can actually see what is an impact

216
0:11:07.56,000 --> 0:11:1,000
of a successful biological control by good bugs.

217
0:11:11.908,000 --> 0:11:17,000
For example, in Israel, where we employ more than 1,000 hectares --

218
0:11:18.301,000 --> 0:11:2,000
10,000 dunams in Israeli terms --

219
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:23,000
of biological pests controlling sweet pepper

220
0:11:23.649,000 --> 0:11:24,000
under protection,

221
0:11:25.197,000 --> 0:11:28,000
75 percent of the pesticides were actually reduced.

222
0:11:28.876,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And Israeli strawberries, even more --

223
0:11:31.385,000 --> 0:11:32,000
80 percent of the pesticides,

224
0:11:33.183,000 --> 0:11:37,000
especially those aimed against pest mites in strawberries.

225
0:11:38.106,000 --> 0:11:39,000
So the impact is very strong.

226
0:11:41.244,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And there goes the question,

227
0:11:43.416,000 --> 0:11:45,000
especially if you ask growers, agriculturists:

228
0:11:46.417,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Why biological control?

229
0:11:48.134,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Why good bugs?

230
0:11:49.936,000 --> 0:11:51,000
By the way, the number of answers you get

231
0:11:52.726,000 --> 0:11:54,000
equals the number of people you ask.

232
0:11:56.314,000 --> 0:12:,000
But if we go, for example, to this place, Southeast Israel,

233
0:12:00.896,000 --> 0:12:03,000
the Arava area above the Great Rift Valley,

234
0:12:04.396,000 --> 0:12:09,000
where the pearl of Israeli agriculture is located,

235
0:12:09.465,000 --> 0:12:12,000
especially under greenhouse conditions, or under screenhouse conditions --

236
0:12:13.082,000 --> 0:12:15,000
if you drive all the way to Eilat, you see this

237
0:12:15.895,000 --> 0:12:16,000
just in the middle of the desert.

238
0:12:17.832,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And if you zoom in,

239
0:12:19.365,000 --> 0:12:2,000
you can definitely watch this:

240
0:12:21.456,000 --> 0:12:23,000
grandparents with their grandchildren,

241
0:12:23.667,000 --> 0:12:25,000
distributing the natural enemies, the good bugs,

242
0:12:26.56,000 --> 0:12:28,000
instead of wearing special clothes

243
0:12:28.957,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and gas masks and applying chemicals.

244
0:12:31.745,000 --> 0:12:33,000
So safety, with respect to the application,

245
0:12:34.355,000 --> 0:12:37,000
is the number one answer that we get from growers,

246
0:12:37.798,000 --> 0:12:38,000
for "Why biological control?"

247
0:12:40.949,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Number two, many growers are, in fact, petrified

248
0:12:44.943,000 --> 0:12:47,000
by the idea of resistance,

249
0:12:48.15,000 --> 0:12:52,000
that the pests will become resistant to the chemicals,

250
0:12:52.727,000 --> 0:12:55,000
just like in our case, that bacteria becomes resistant to antibiotics.

251
0:12:56.56,000 --> 0:12:58,000
It's the same, and it can happen very quickly.

252
0:13:00.168,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Fortunately, in either biological control or even natural control,

253
0:13:04.56,000 --> 0:13:07,000
resistance is extremely rare.

254
0:13:08.2,000 --> 0:13:09,000
It hardly happens.

255
0:13:09.773,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Because this is evolution, this is the natural ratio,

256
0:13:13.149,000 --> 0:13:16,000
unlike resistance, which happens in the case of chemicals.

257
0:13:17.027,000 --> 0:13:19,000
And thirdly, public demand.

258
0:13:20.496,000 --> 0:13:24,000
The more the public demands the reduction of chemicals,

259
0:13:25.324,000 --> 0:13:28,000
the more growers become aware of the fact

260
0:13:29.193,000 --> 0:13:31,000
that they should, wherever they can and wherever possible,

261
0:13:31.959,000 --> 0:13:34,000
replace the chemical control with biological control.

262
0:13:35.994,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Even here, there is another grower,

263
0:13:38.08,000 --> 0:13:41,000
you see, very interested in the bugs, the bad ones and the good ones,

264
0:13:41.831,000 --> 0:13:43,000
wearing this magnifier already on her head,

265
0:13:44.05,000 --> 0:13:46,000
just walking safely in her crop.

266
0:13:47.127,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Finally, I want to get to my vision,

267
0:13:50.411,000 --> 0:13:51,000
or, in fact, to my dream.

268
0:13:52.871,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Because, you see, this is the reality.

269
0:13:54.918,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Have a look at the gap.

270
0:13:56.418,000 --> 0:13:58,000
If we take the overall turnover

271
0:13:58.56,000 --> 0:14:,000
of the biocontrol industry worldwide,

272
0:14:01.029,000 --> 0:14:02,000
it's 250 million dollars.

273
0:14:04.022,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And look at the overall pesticide industry

274
0:14:07.14,000 --> 0:14:08,000
in all the crops throughout the world.

275
0:14:09.337,000 --> 0:14:11,000
I think it's times 100 or something like that.

276
0:14:12.232,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Twenty-five billion.

277
0:14:13.962,000 --> 0:14:15,000
So there is a huge gap to bridge.

278
0:14:17.56,000 --> 0:14:18,000
So actually, how can we do it?

279
0:14:19.248,000 --> 0:14:23,000
How can we bridge, or let's say, narrow, this gap over the years?

280
0:14:24.152,000 --> 0:14:27,000
First of all, we need to find more robust,

281
0:14:27.924,000 --> 0:14:29,000
good and reliable biological solutions,

282
0:14:30.56,000 --> 0:14:34,000
more good bugs that we can either mass-produce

283
0:14:35.207,000 --> 0:14:37,000
or actually conserve in the field.

284
0:14:38.273,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Secondly, to create even more intensive and strict public demand

285
0:14:42.883,000 --> 0:14:45,000
for the reduction of chemicals in agricultural fresh produce.

286
0:14:46.976,000 --> 0:14:49,000
And thirdly, also to increase awareness by the growers

287
0:14:50.758,000 --> 0:14:52,000
to the potential of this industry.

288
0:14:53.56,000 --> 0:14:55,000
And this gap really narrows.

289
0:14:56.083,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Step by step, it does narrow.

290
0:14:59.817,000 --> 0:15:01,000
So I think my last slide is:

291
0:15:02.046,000 --> 0:15:04,000
All we are saying -- we can actually sing it --

292
0:15:04.335,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Give nature a chance.

293
0:15:06.153,000 --> 0:15:09,000
I'm saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol practitioners

294
0:15:09.343,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and implementers,

295
0:15:10.681,000 --> 0:15:12,000
in Israel and abroad,

296
0:15:12.926,000 --> 0:15:14,000
really give nature a chance.

297
0:15:14.982,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Thank you.

298
0:15:16.165,000 --> 0:15:18,000
(Applause)

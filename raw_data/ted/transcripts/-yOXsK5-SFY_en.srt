1
0:00:26.73,000 --> 0:00:32,000
(Music)

2
0:08:38.321,000 --> 0:08:39,000
(Music ends)

3
0:08:39.686,000 --> 0:08:45,000
(Applause)

4
0:08:57.463,000 --> 0:08:58,000
(Applause ends)

5
0:08:58.488,000 --> 0:09:,000
Hi, everyone. I'm Sirena.

6
0:09:00.572,000 --> 0:09:02,000
I'm 11 years old and from Connecticut.

7
0:09:02.755,000 --> 0:09:05,000
(Audience cheers)

8
0:09:06.356,000 --> 0:09:1,000
(Applause)

9
0:09:10.506,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Well, I'm not really sure why I'm here.

10
0:09:15.1,000 --> 0:09:17,000
(Laughter)

11
0:09:17.308,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I mean, what does this have to do with technology, entertainment and design?

12
0:09:23.784,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Well, I count my iPod, cellphone and computer as technology,

13
0:09:28.159,000 --> 0:09:3,000
but this has nothing to do with that.

14
0:09:31.683,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So I did a little research on it.

15
0:09:34.659,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Well, this is what I found.

16
0:09:36.342,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Of course, I hope I can memorize it.

17
0:09:38.401,000 --> 0:09:39,000
(Clears throat)

18
0:09:40.229,000 --> 0:09:42,000
The violin is made of a wood box and four metal strings.

19
0:09:42.916,000 --> 0:09:44,000
By pulling a string, it vibrates and produces a sound wave,

20
0:09:45.775,000 --> 0:09:47,000
which passes through a piece of wood called a bridge,

21
0:09:48.347,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and goes down to the wood box and gets amplified, but ... let me think.

22
0:09:51.862,000 --> 0:09:54,000
(Laughter)

23
0:09:55.586,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Placing your finger at different places on the fingerboard

24
0:09:58.499,000 --> 0:10:01,000
changes the string length, and that changes the frequency of the sound wave.

25
0:10:02.112,000 --> 0:10:03,000
(Sighs) Oh, my gosh!

26
0:10:03.511,000 --> 0:10:05,000
(Laughter)

27
0:10:05.89,000 --> 0:10:08,000
OK, this is sort of technology,

28
0:10:09.521,000 --> 0:10:12,000
but I can call it a 16th-century technology.

29
0:10:14.302,000 --> 0:10:17,000
But actually, the most fascinating thing that I found

30
0:10:17.437,000 --> 0:10:21,000
was that even the audio system or wave transmission nowadays

31
0:10:21.696,000 --> 0:10:26,000
are still based on the same principle of producing and projecting sound.

32
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Isn't that cool?

33
0:10:28.185,000 --> 0:10:31,000
(Laughter)

34
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:37,000
(Applause)

35
0:10:38.883,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Design -- I love its design.

36
0:10:41.858,000 --> 0:10:43,000
I remember when I was little, my mom asked me,

37
0:10:44.674,000 --> 0:10:46,000
"Would you like to play the violin or the piano?"

38
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I looked at that giant monster and said to myself --

39
0:10:51.256,000 --> 0:10:56,000
"I am not going to lock myself on that bench the whole day!"

40
0:10:56.433,000 --> 0:10:57,000
(Laughter)

41
0:10:57.567,000 --> 0:10:58,000
This is small and lightweight.

42
0:10:59.397,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I can play from standing, sitting or walking.

43
0:11:01.88,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And, you know what?

44
0:11:03.316,000 --> 0:11:07,000
The best of all is that if I don't want to practice,

45
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:09,000
(Whispering) I can hide it.

46
0:11:09.84,000 --> 0:11:13,000
(Laughter)

47
0:11:14.189,000 --> 0:11:15,000
The violin is very beautiful.

48
0:11:15.841,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Some people relate it as the shape of a lady.

49
0:11:19.094,000 --> 0:11:23,000
But whether you like it or not, it's been so for more than 400 years,

50
0:11:23.844,000 --> 0:11:26,000
unlike modern stuff [that] easily looks dated.

51
0:11:27.597,000 --> 0:11:29,000
But I think it's very personal and unique that,

52
0:11:30.121,000 --> 0:11:32,000
although each violin looks pretty similar,

53
0:11:32.683,000 --> 0:11:34,000
no two violins sound the same --

54
0:11:35.129,000 --> 0:11:38,000
even from the same maker or based on the same model.

55
0:11:39.418,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Entertainment -- I love the entertainment.

56
0:11:43.057,000 --> 0:11:47,000
But actually, the instrument itself isn't very entertaining.

57
0:11:48.563,000 --> 0:11:51,000
I mean, when I first got my violin and tried to play around on it,

58
0:11:52.336,000 --> 0:11:55,000
it was actually really bad,

59
0:11:55.688,000 --> 0:11:58,000
because it didn't sound the way I'd heard from other kids --

60
0:11:59.699,000 --> 0:12:01,000
it was so horrible and so scratchy.

61
0:12:02.189,000 --> 0:12:04,000
So, it wasn't entertaining at all.

62
0:12:05.418,000 --> 0:12:1,000
But besides, my brother found this very funny:

63
0:12:11.263,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Yuk! Yuk! Yuk!

64
0:12:13.654,000 --> 0:12:19,000
(Laughter)

65
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:21,000
A few years later, I heard a joke

66
0:12:21.818,000 --> 0:12:23,000
about the greatest violinist, Jascha Heifetz.

67
0:12:24.167,000 --> 0:12:25,000
After Mr. Heifetz's concert,

68
0:12:25.838,000 --> 0:12:27,000
a lady came over and complimented him:

69
0:12:27.871,000 --> 0:12:3,000
"Oh, Mr. Heifetz, your violin sounded so great tonight!"

70
0:12:31.577,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And Mr. Heifetz was a very cool person,

71
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:35,000
so he picked up his violin and said,

72
0:12:35.893,000 --> 0:12:36,000
"Funny -- I don't hear anything."

73
0:12:37.612,000 --> 0:12:39,000
(Laughter)

74
0:12:40.325,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Now I realize that as the musician,

75
0:12:43.316,000 --> 0:12:48,000
we human beings, with our great mind, artistic heart and skill,

76
0:12:48.723,000 --> 0:12:52,000
can change this 16th-century technology and a legendary design

77
0:12:53.604,000 --> 0:12:54,000
to a wonderful entertainment.

78
0:12:55.54,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Now I know why I'm here.

79
0:12:58.445,000 --> 0:13:04,000
(Music)

80
0:16:31.946,000 --> 0:16:33,000
(Music ends)

81
0:16:35.926,000 --> 0:16:41,000
(Applause)

82
0:16:44.315,000 --> 0:16:47,000
At first, I thought I was just going to be here to perform,

83
0:16:47.444,000 --> 0:16:51,000
but unexpectedly, I learned and enjoyed much more.

84
0:16:53.09,000 --> 0:16:58,000
But ... although some of the talks were quite up there for me.

85
0:16:58.747,000 --> 0:17:01,000
(Laughter)

86
0:17:02.007,000 --> 0:17:05,000
Like the multi-dimension stuff.

87
0:17:06.322,000 --> 0:17:08,000
I mean, honestly, I'd be happy enough

88
0:17:08.868,000 --> 0:17:11,000
if I could actually get my two dimensions correct in school.

89
0:17:12,000 --> 0:17:14,000
(Laughter)

90
0:17:15.306,000 --> 0:17:19,000
But actually, the most impressive thing to me is that --

91
0:17:19.81,000 --> 0:17:22,000
well, actually, I would also like to say this for all children

92
0:17:23.61,000 --> 0:17:28,000
is to say thank you to all adults, for actually caring for us a lot,

93
0:17:29.54,000 --> 0:17:32,000
and to make our future world much better.

94
0:17:32.77,000 --> 0:17:33,000
Thank you.

95
0:17:33.945,000 --> 0:17:39,000
(Applause)

96
0:17:43.041,000 --> 0:17:47,000
(Music)

97
0:22:30.376,000 --> 0:22:32,000
(Music ends)

98
0:22:33.37,000 --> 0:22:39,000
(Applause)

99
0:22:57.885,000 --> 0:22:59,000
(Applause ends)

100
0:23:00.306,000 --> 0:23:04,000
(Music)

101
0:24:40.938,000 --> 0:24:42,000
(Music ends)

102
0:24:44.031,000 --> 0:24:48,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.468,000 --> 0:00:16,000
What I'd like to do today is talk about one of my favorite subjects,

2
0:00:16.857,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and that is the neuroscience of sleep.

3
0:00:20.542,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Now, there is a sound --

4
0:00:23.12,000 --> 0:00:25,000
(Alarm clock)

5
0:00:25.15,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Ah, it worked!

6
0:00:27.19,000 --> 0:00:3,000
A sound that is desperately familiar to most of us,

7
0:00:30.792,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and of course it's the sound of the alarm clock.

8
0:00:33.156,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And what that truly ghastly, awful sound does

9
0:00:36.347,000 --> 0:00:41,000
is stop the single most important behavioral experience

10
0:00:41.738,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that we have, and that's sleep.

11
0:00:44.695,000 --> 0:00:47,000
If you're an average sort of person,

12
0:00:48.01,000 --> 0:00:52,000
36 percent of your life will be spent asleep,

13
0:00:52.433,000 --> 0:00:54,000
which means that if you live to 90,

14
0:00:54.668,000 --> 0:00:59,000
then 32 years will have been spent entirely asleep.

15
0:01:01.587,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Now what that 32 years is telling us is that sleep at some level is important.

16
0:01:06.857,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And yet, for most of us, we don't give sleep a second thought.

17
0:01:09.836,000 --> 0:01:1,000
We throw it away.

18
0:01:11.669,000 --> 0:01:13,000
We really just don't think about sleep.

19
0:01:14.921,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And so what I'd like to do today is change your views,

20
0:01:18.54,000 --> 0:01:21,000
change your ideas and your thoughts about sleep.

21
0:01:21.739,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And the journey that I want to take you on,

22
0:01:24.13,000 --> 0:01:26,000
we need to start by going back in time.

23
0:01:28.706,000 --> 0:01:31,000
"Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber."

24
0:01:33.266,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Any ideas who said that?

25
0:01:36.64,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.

26
0:01:38.999,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Yes, let me give you a few more quotes.

27
0:01:42.621,000 --> 0:01:45,000
"O sleep, O gentle sleep, nature's soft nurse,

28
0:01:46.595,000 --> 0:01:47,000
how have I frighted thee?"

29
0:01:47.944,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Shakespeare again, from -- I won't say it --

30
0:01:50.541,000 --> 0:01:51,000
the Scottish play.

31
0:01:51.939,000 --> 0:01:52,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:54.577,000 --> 0:01:55,000
From the same time:

33
0:01:55.831,000 --> 0:01:59,000
"Sleep is the golden chain that ties health and our bodies together."

34
0:02:00.06,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Extremely prophetic, by Thomas Dekker, another Elizabethan dramatist.

35
0:02:04.636,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But if we jump forward 400 years,

36
0:02:07.678,000 --> 0:02:1,000
the tone about sleep changes somewhat.

37
0:02:11.043,000 --> 0:02:14,000
This is from Thomas Edison, from the beginning of the 20th century:

38
0:02:14.238,000 --> 0:02:17,000
"Sleep is a criminal waste of time and a heritage from our cave days."

39
0:02:17.898,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Bang!

40
0:02:19.105,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:21.673,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And if we also jump into the 1980s, some of you may remember

42
0:02:26.789,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that Margaret Thatcher was reported to have said,

43
0:02:29.163,000 --> 0:02:3,000
"Sleep is for wimps."

44
0:02:30.628,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And of course the infamous -- what was his name? --

45
0:02:33.523,000 --> 0:02:35,000
the infamous Gordon Gekko from "Wall Street" said,

46
0:02:35.985,000 --> 0:02:36,000
"Money never sleeps."

47
0:02:38.46,000 --> 0:02:4,000
What do we do in the 20th century about sleep?

48
0:02:41.14,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Well, of course, we use Thomas Edison's light bulb

49
0:02:44.505,000 --> 0:02:46,000
to invade the night, and we occupied the dark,

50
0:02:47.351,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and in the process of this occupation,

51
0:02:50.136,000 --> 0:02:52,000
we've treated sleep as an illness, almost.

52
0:02:52.741,000 --> 0:02:54,000
We've treated it as an enemy.

53
0:02:55.677,000 --> 0:03:,000
At most now, I suppose, we tolerate the need for sleep,

54
0:03:01.068,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and at worst perhaps many of us think of sleep

55
0:03:03.259,000 --> 0:03:05,000
as an illness that needs some sort of a cure.

56
0:03:06.247,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And our ignorance about sleep is really quite profound.

57
0:03:10.307,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Why is it? Why do we abandon sleep in our thoughts?

58
0:03:13.668,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Well, it's because you don't do anything much while you're asleep, it seems.

59
0:03:18.008,000 --> 0:03:21,000
You don't eat. You don't drink.

60
0:03:21.513,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And you don't have sex.

61
0:03:22.814,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Well, most of us anyway.

62
0:03:24.242,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And so, therefore it's --

63
0:03:26.07,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Sorry.

64
0:03:28.032,000 --> 0:03:3,000
It's a complete waste of time, right?

65
0:03:30.292,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Wrong.

66
0:03:31.689,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Actually, sleep is an incredibly important part of our biology,

67
0:03:35.512,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and neuroscientists are beginning to explain

68
0:03:38.08,000 --> 0:03:4,000
why it's so very important.

69
0:03:40.547,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So let's move to the brain.

70
0:03:43.383,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Now, here we have a brain.

71
0:03:48.14,000 --> 0:03:51,000
This is donated by a social scientist,

72
0:03:51.985,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and they said they didn't know what it was or indeed, how to use it, so --

73
0:03:55.604,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:58.582,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Sorry.

75
0:04:00.714,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So I borrowed it.

76
0:04:02.318,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I don't think they noticed. OK.

77
0:04:04.03,000 --> 0:04:06,000
(Laughter)

78
0:04:06.618,000 --> 0:04:09,000
The point I'm trying to make is that when you're asleep,

79
0:04:09.815,000 --> 0:04:1,000
this thing doesn't shut down.

80
0:04:11.583,000 --> 0:04:13,000
In fact, some areas of the brain are actually more active

81
0:04:14.289,000 --> 0:04:16,000
during the sleep state than during the wake state.

82
0:04:17.439,000 --> 0:04:19,000
The other thing that's really important about sleep

83
0:04:19.869,000 --> 0:04:22,000
is that it doesn't arise from a single structure within the brain,

84
0:04:23.019,000 --> 0:04:25,000
but is to some extent a network property.

85
0:04:25.2,000 --> 0:04:27,000
If we flip the brain on its back --

86
0:04:27.656,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I love this little bit of spinal cord here --

87
0:04:30.668,000 --> 0:04:32,000
this bit here is the hypothalamus,

88
0:04:33.597,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and right under there is a whole raft of interesting structures,

89
0:04:37.435,000 --> 0:04:38,000
not least the biological clock.

90
0:04:39.04,000 --> 0:04:41,000
The biological clock tells us when it's good to be up,

91
0:04:41.679,000 --> 0:04:42,000
when it's good to be asleep,

92
0:04:43.251,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and what that structure does is interact

93
0:04:45.203,000 --> 0:04:48,000
with a whole raft of other areas within the hypothalamus,

94
0:04:48.445,000 --> 0:04:5,000
the lateral hypothalamus, the ventrolateral preoptic nuclei.

95
0:04:51.289,000 --> 0:04:52,000
All of those combine,

96
0:04:52.677,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and they send projections down to the brain stem here.

97
0:04:55.888,000 --> 0:04:57,000
The brain stem then projects forward

98
0:04:58.889,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and bathes the cortex, this wonderfully wrinkly bit over here,

99
0:05:02.958,000 --> 0:05:04,000
with neurotransmitters that keep us awake

100
0:05:05.416,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and essentially provide us with our consciousness.

101
0:05:08.054,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So sleep arises from a whole raft

102
0:05:10.794,000 --> 0:05:12,000
of different interactions within the brain,

103
0:05:12.897,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and essentially, sleep is turned on and off

104
0:05:15.09,000 --> 0:05:17,000
as a result of a range of interactions in here.

105
0:05:18.035,000 --> 0:05:19,000
OK. So where have we got to?

106
0:05:19.924,000 --> 0:05:22,000
We've said that sleep is complicated

107
0:05:23.474,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and it takes 32 years of our life.

108
0:05:28.188,000 --> 0:05:31,000
But what I haven't explained is what sleep is about.

109
0:05:31.251,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So why do we sleep?

110
0:05:33.401,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And it won't surprise any of you that, of course,

111
0:05:35.719,000 --> 0:05:36,000
as scientists, we don't have a consensus.

112
0:05:37.711,000 --> 0:05:4,000
There are dozens of different ideas about why we sleep,

113
0:05:41.009,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and I'm going to outline three of those.

114
0:05:43.517,000 --> 0:05:45,000
The first is sort of the restoration idea,

115
0:05:46.24,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and it's somewhat intuitive.

116
0:05:48.11,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Essentially, all the stuff we've burned up during the day,

117
0:05:50.9,000 --> 0:05:53,000
we restore, we replace, we rebuild during the night.

118
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And indeed, as an explanation, it goes back to Aristotle,

119
0:05:57.636,000 --> 0:05:59,000
so that's what -- 2,300 years ago.

120
0:05:59.837,000 --> 0:06:,000
It's gone in and out of fashion.

121
0:06:01.458,000 --> 0:06:02,000
It's fashionable at the moment

122
0:06:02.927,000 --> 0:06:04,000
because what's been shown is that within the brain,

123
0:06:05.344,000 --> 0:06:09,000
a whole raft of genes have been shown to be turned on only during sleep,

124
0:06:10.01,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and those genes are associated with restoration and metabolic pathways.

125
0:06:14.333,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So there's good evidence for the whole restoration hypothesis.

126
0:06:18.436,000 --> 0:06:19,000
What about energy conservation?

127
0:06:20.428,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Again, perhaps intuitive.

128
0:06:23.764,000 --> 0:06:25,000
You essentially sleep to save calories.

129
0:06:26.488,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Now, when you do the sums, though, it doesn't really pan out.

130
0:06:29.958,000 --> 0:06:33,000
If you compare an individual who has slept at night,

131
0:06:34.302,000 --> 0:06:37,000
or stayed awake and hasn't moved very much,

132
0:06:38.033,000 --> 0:06:42,000
the energy saving of sleeping is about 110 calories a night.

133
0:06:42.601,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Now, that's the equivalent of a hot dog bun.

134
0:06:45.934,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Now, I would say that a hot dog bun

135
0:06:49.518,000 --> 0:06:5,000
is kind of a meager return

136
0:06:51.335,000 --> 0:06:53,000
for such a complicated and demanding behavior as sleep.

137
0:06:54.454,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So I'm less convinced by the energy conservation idea.

138
0:06:58.397,000 --> 0:07:,000
But the third idea I'm quite attracted to,

139
0:07:00.621,000 --> 0:07:03,000
which is brain processing and memory consolidation.

140
0:07:04.1,000 --> 0:07:07,000
What we know is that, if after you've tried to learn a task,

141
0:07:08.002,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and you sleep-deprive individuals,

142
0:07:09.836,000 --> 0:07:11,000
the ability to learn that task is smashed.

143
0:07:12.401,000 --> 0:07:15,000
It's really hugely attenuated.

144
0:07:15.481,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So sleep and memory consolidation is also very important.

145
0:07:18.545,000 --> 0:07:2,000
However, it's not just the laying down of memory

146
0:07:21.07,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and recalling it.

147
0:07:22.664,000 --> 0:07:24,000
What's turned out to be really exciting

148
0:07:25.024,000 --> 0:07:29,000
is that our ability to come up with novel solutions to complex problems

149
0:07:29.587,000 --> 0:07:31,000
is hugely enhanced by a night of sleep.

150
0:07:32.029,000 --> 0:07:35,000
In fact, it's been estimated to give us a threefold advantage.

151
0:07:35.456,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Sleeping at night enhances our creativity.

152
0:07:38.123,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And what seems to be going on is that, in the brain,

153
0:07:41.003,000 --> 0:07:43,000
those neural connections that are important,

154
0:07:43.58,000 --> 0:07:45,000
those synaptic connections that are important,

155
0:07:45.781,000 --> 0:07:46,000
are linked and strengthened,

156
0:07:47.312,000 --> 0:07:51,000
while those that are less important tend to fade away and be less important.

157
0:07:52.218,000 --> 0:07:53,000
OK.

158
0:07:53.393,000 --> 0:07:56,000
So we've had three explanations for why we might sleep,

159
0:07:56.432,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and I think the important thing to realize is that the details will vary,

160
0:08:00.11,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and it's probable we sleep for multiple different reasons.

161
0:08:03.235,000 --> 0:08:06,000
But sleep is not an indulgence.

162
0:08:06.385,000 --> 0:08:1,000
It's not some sort of thing that we can take on board rather casually.

163
0:08:11.04,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I think that sleep was once likened to an upgrade

164
0:08:14.907,000 --> 0:08:17,000
from economy to business class, you know, the equivalent of.

165
0:08:17.955,000 --> 0:08:2,000
It's not even an upgrade from economy to first class.

166
0:08:21.748,000 --> 0:08:26,000
The critical thing to realize is that if you don't sleep,

167
0:08:26.889,000 --> 0:08:27,000
you don't fly.

168
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Essentially, you never get there.

169
0:08:30.233,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And what's extraordinary about much of our society these days

170
0:08:33.542,000 --> 0:08:36,000
is that we are desperately sleep-deprived.

171
0:08:36.615,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So let's now look at sleep deprivation.

172
0:08:39.298,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Huge sectors of society are sleep-deprived,

173
0:08:42.012,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and let's look at our sleep-o-meter.

174
0:08:44.764,000 --> 0:08:47,000
So in the 1950s, good data suggests that most of us

175
0:08:48.125,000 --> 0:08:5,000
were getting around eight hours of sleep a night.

176
0:08:51.49,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Nowadays, we sleep one and a half to two hours less every night,

177
0:08:55.368,000 --> 0:08:58,000
so we're in the six-and-a-half-hours every-night league.

178
0:08:59.686,000 --> 0:09:01,000
For teenagers, it's worse, much worse.

179
0:09:02.644,000 --> 0:09:04,000
They need nine hours for full brain performance,

180
0:09:05.626,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and many of them, on a school night, are only getting five hours of sleep.

181
0:09:09.293,000 --> 0:09:1,000
It's simply not enough.

182
0:09:10.945,000 --> 0:09:13,000
If we think about other sectors of society -- the aged;

183
0:09:14.013,000 --> 0:09:18,000
if you are aged, then your ability to sleep in a single block

184
0:09:18.452,000 --> 0:09:2,000
is somewhat disrupted, and many sleep, again,

185
0:09:21.04,000 --> 0:09:22,000
less than five hours a night.

186
0:09:22.792,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Shift work.

187
0:09:23.973,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Shift work is extraordinary,

188
0:09:25.528,000 --> 0:09:27,000
perhaps 20 percent of the working population,

189
0:09:28.036,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and the body clock does not shift to the demands of working at night.

190
0:09:32.03,000 --> 0:09:35,000
It's locked onto the same light-dark cycle as the rest of us.

191
0:09:35.224,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So when the poor old shift worker is going home

192
0:09:37.459,000 --> 0:09:39,000
to try and sleep during the day, desperately tired,

193
0:09:39.96,000 --> 0:09:42,000
the body clock is saying, "Wake up. This is the time to be awake."

194
0:09:43.1,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So the quality of sleep that you get as a night shift worker

195
0:09:46.18,000 --> 0:09:48,000
is usually very poor, again in that sort of five-hour region.

196
0:09:49.563,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And then, of course, tens of millions of people suffer from jet lag.

197
0:09:53.1,000 --> 0:09:55,000
So who here has jet lag?

198
0:09:56.389,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Well, my goodness gracious.

199
0:09:58.365,000 --> 0:10:,000
Well, thank you very much indeed for not falling asleep,

200
0:10:01.195,000 --> 0:10:03,000
because that's what your brain is craving.

201
0:10:03.893,000 --> 0:10:08,000
One of the things that the brain does is indulge in micro-sleeps,

202
0:10:09.231,000 --> 0:10:1,000
this involuntary falling asleep,

203
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and you have essentially no control over it.

204
0:10:13.237,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Now, micro-sleeps can be sort of somewhat embarrassing,

205
0:10:16.02,000 --> 0:10:17,000
but they can also be deadly.

206
0:10:18.02,000 --> 0:10:21,000
It's been estimated that 31 percent of drivers

207
0:10:21.699,000 --> 0:10:25,000
will fall asleep at the wheel at least once in their life,

208
0:10:26.005,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and in the US, the statistics are pretty good:

209
0:10:28.195,000 --> 0:10:33,000
100,000 accidents on the freeway have been associated with tiredness,

210
0:10:33.416,000 --> 0:10:36,000
loss of vigilance, and falling asleep -- a hundred thousand a year.

211
0:10:36.604,000 --> 0:10:37,000
It's extraordinary.

212
0:10:37.786,000 --> 0:10:39,000
At another level of terror,

213
0:10:39.875,000 --> 0:10:42,000
we dip into the tragic accidents at Chernobyl

214
0:10:43.477,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and indeed the space shuttle Challenger,

215
0:10:45.624,000 --> 0:10:46,000
which was so tragically lost.

216
0:10:47.577,000 --> 0:10:5,000
And in the investigations that followed those disasters,

217
0:10:51.002,000 --> 0:10:53,000
poor judgment as a result of extended shift work

218
0:10:54.02,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and loss of vigilance and tiredness

219
0:10:56.326,000 --> 0:10:59,000
was attributed to a big chunk of those disasters.

220
0:11:02.408,000 --> 0:11:04,000
When you're tired and you lack sleep,

221
0:11:04.511,000 --> 0:11:07,000
you have poor memory, you have poor creativity,

222
0:11:08.156,000 --> 0:11:1,000
you have increased impulsiveness,

223
0:11:10.287,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and you have overall poor judgment.

224
0:11:12.914,000 --> 0:11:15,000
But my friends, it's so much worse than that.

225
0:11:16.025,000 --> 0:11:18,000
(Laughter)

226
0:11:18.096,000 --> 0:11:19,000
If you are a tired brain,

227
0:11:20.08,000 --> 0:11:22,000
the brain is craving things to wake it up.

228
0:11:23.04,000 --> 0:11:25,000
So drugs, stimulants.

229
0:11:25.23,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Caffeine represents the stimulant of choice

230
0:11:28.924,000 --> 0:11:29,000
across much of the Western world.

231
0:11:30.528,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Much of the day is fueled by caffeine,

232
0:11:32.575,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and if you're a really naughty tired brain, nicotine.

233
0:11:35.613,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Of course, you're fueling the waking state with these stimulants,

234
0:11:38.93,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and then, of course, it gets to 11 o'clock at night,

235
0:11:41.39,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and the brain says to itself,

236
0:11:42.802,000 --> 0:11:44,000
"Actually, I need to be asleep fairly shortly.

237
0:11:44.988,000 --> 0:11:46,000
What do we do about that when I'm feeling completely wired?"

238
0:11:47.881,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Well, of course, you then resort to alcohol.

239
0:11:50.765,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Now alcohol, short-term, you know, once or twice,

240
0:11:54.02,000 --> 0:11:56,000
to use to mildly sedate you, can be very useful.

241
0:11:56.795,000 --> 0:11:58,000
It can actually ease the sleep transition.

242
0:11:59.675,000 --> 0:12:04,000
But what you must be so aware of is that alcohol doesn't provide sleep.

243
0:12:04.947,000 --> 0:12:05,000
A biological mimic for sleep,

244
0:12:06.438,000 --> 0:12:07,000
it sedates you.

245
0:12:07.669,000 --> 0:12:1,000
So it actually harms some of the neural processing

246
0:12:11.058,000 --> 0:12:13,000
that's going on during memory consolidation and memory recall.

247
0:12:14.01,000 --> 0:12:16,000
So it's a short-term acute measure,

248
0:12:16.198,000 --> 0:12:17,000
but for goodness sake,

249
0:12:17.38,000 --> 0:12:19,000
don't become addicted to alcohol

250
0:12:19.414,000 --> 0:12:21,000
as a way of getting to sleep every night.

251
0:12:22.095,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Another connection between loss of sleep is weight gain.

252
0:12:25.644,000 --> 0:12:28,000
If you sleep around about five hours or less every night,

253
0:12:29.263,000 --> 0:12:32,000
then you have a 50 percent likelihood of being obese.

254
0:12:33.132,000 --> 0:12:34,000
What's the connection here?

255
0:12:34.879,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Well, sleep loss seems to give rise to the release of the hormone ghrelin,

256
0:12:39.267,000 --> 0:12:4,000
the hunger hormone.

257
0:12:40.448,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Ghrelin is released.

258
0:12:41.624,000 --> 0:12:42,000
It gets to the brain.

259
0:12:43.059,000 --> 0:12:45,000
The brain says, "I need carbohydrates,"

260
0:12:45.866,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and what it does is seek out carbohydrates and particularly sugars.

261
0:12:49.493,000 --> 0:12:51,000
So there's a link between tiredness

262
0:12:52.208,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and the metabolic predisposition for weight gain: stress.

263
0:12:55.802,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Tired people are massively stressed.

264
0:12:58.89,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And one of the things of stress, of course, is loss of memory,

265
0:13:02.183,000 --> 0:13:05,000
which is what I sort of just then had a little lapse of.

266
0:13:07.14,000 --> 0:13:08,000
But stress is so much more.

267
0:13:09.145,000 --> 0:13:12,000
So, if you're acutely stressed, not a great problem,

268
0:13:12.319,000 --> 0:13:15,000
but it's sustained stress associated with sleep loss that's the problem.

269
0:13:16.118,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Sustained stress leads to suppressed immunity.

270
0:13:20.219,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And so, tired people tend to have higher rates of overall infection,

271
0:13:23.806,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and there's some very good studies

272
0:13:25.482,000 --> 0:13:28,000
showing that shift workers, for example, have higher rates of cancer.

273
0:13:28.908,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Increased levels of stress throw glucose into the circulation.

274
0:13:32.756,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Glucose becomes a dominant part of the vasculature

275
0:13:36.798,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and essentially you become glucose intolerant.

276
0:13:39.29,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Therefore, diabetes 2.

277
0:13:41.609,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Stress increases cardiovascular disease as a result of raising blood pressure.

278
0:13:47.515,000 --> 0:13:5,000
So there's a whole raft of things associated with sleep loss

279
0:13:50.832,000 --> 0:13:53,000
that are more than just a mildly impaired brain,

280
0:13:54.479,000 --> 0:13:57,000
which is where I think most people think that sleep loss resides.

281
0:13:57.613,000 --> 0:14:,000
So at this point in the talk, this is a nice time to think,

282
0:14:01.02,000 --> 0:14:04,000
"Well, do you think on the whole I'm getting enough sleep?"

283
0:14:04.234,000 --> 0:14:05,000
So a quick show of hands.

284
0:14:06.012,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Who feels that they're getting enough sleep here?

285
0:14:09.067,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Oh. Well, that's pretty impressive.

286
0:14:11.536,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Good. We'll talk more about that later, about what are your tips.

287
0:14:14.639,000 --> 0:14:16,000
So most of us, of course, ask the question,

288
0:14:17.059,000 --> 0:14:19,000
"How do I know whether I'm getting enough sleep?"

289
0:14:19.39,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Well, it's not rocket science.

290
0:14:20.85,000 --> 0:14:23,000
If you need an alarm clock to get you out of bed in the morning,

291
0:14:23.936,000 --> 0:14:25,000
if you are taking a long time to get up,

292
0:14:25.997,000 --> 0:14:26,000
if you need lots of stimulants,

293
0:14:27.552,000 --> 0:14:28,000
if you're grumpy, if you're irritable,

294
0:14:29.52,000 --> 0:14:32,000
if you're told by your work colleagues that you're looking tired and irritable,

295
0:14:33.342,000 --> 0:14:35,000
chances are you are sleep-deprived.

296
0:14:35.691,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Listen to them. Listen to yourself.

297
0:14:37.824,000 --> 0:14:38,000
What do you do?

298
0:14:39.291,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Well -- and this is slightly offensive --

299
0:14:41.348,000 --> 0:14:42,000
sleep for dummies.

300
0:14:42.529,000 --> 0:14:44,000
(Laughter)

301
0:14:44.673,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Make your bedroom a haven for sleep.

302
0:14:47.482,000 --> 0:14:5,000
The first critical thing is make it as dark as you possibly can,

303
0:14:51.01,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and also make it slightly cool.

304
0:14:52.875,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Very important.

305
0:14:54.051,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Actually, reduce your amount of light exposure

306
0:14:56.981,000 --> 0:14:58,000
at least half an hour before you go to bed.

307
0:14:59.354,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Light increases levels of alertness and will delay sleep.

308
0:15:02.131,000 --> 0:15:04,000
What's the last thing that most of us do before we go to bed?

309
0:15:05.018,000 --> 0:15:07,000
We stand in a massively lit bathroom,

310
0:15:07.411,000 --> 0:15:09,000
looking into the mirror cleaning our teeth.

311
0:15:09.53,000 --> 0:15:12,000
It's the worst thing we can possibly do before we go to sleep.

312
0:15:13.109,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Turn off those mobile phones. Turn off those computers.

313
0:15:15.836,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Turn off all of those things that are also going to excite the brain.

314
0:15:20.155,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Try not to drink caffeine too late in the day,

315
0:15:22.843,000 --> 0:15:24,000
ideally not after lunch.

316
0:15:25.715,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Now, we've set about reducing light exposure before you go to bed,

317
0:15:29.04,000 --> 0:15:3,000
but light exposure in the morning

318
0:15:30.996,000 --> 0:15:33,000
is very good at setting the biological clock to the light-dark cycle.

319
0:15:34.311,000 --> 0:15:35,000
So seek out morning light.

320
0:15:35.994,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Basically, listen to yourself.

321
0:15:38.474,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Wind down.

322
0:15:39.65,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Do those sorts of things

323
0:15:40.836,000 --> 0:15:42,000
that you know are going to ease you off

324
0:15:42.882,000 --> 0:15:44,000
into the honey-heavy dew of slumber.

325
0:15:46.195,000 --> 0:15:47,000
OK.

326
0:15:47.378,000 --> 0:15:49,000
That's some facts. What about some myths?

327
0:15:49.704,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Teenagers are lazy.

328
0:15:51.01,000 --> 0:15:52,000
No. Poor things.

329
0:15:52.898,000 --> 0:15:55,000
They have a biological predisposition to go to bed late and get up late,

330
0:15:56.348,000 --> 0:15:57,000
so give them a break.

331
0:15:57.661,000 --> 0:15:59,000
We need eight hours of sleep a night.

332
0:16:01.392,000 --> 0:16:02,000
That's an average.

333
0:16:02.572,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Some people need more. Some people need less.

334
0:16:04.864,000 --> 0:16:06,000
And what you need to do is listen to your body.

335
0:16:07.101,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Do you need that much or do you need more?

336
0:16:09.466,000 --> 0:16:1,000
Simple as that.

337
0:16:10.866,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Old people need less sleep.

338
0:16:13.01,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Not true.

339
0:16:14.684,000 --> 0:16:16,000
The sleep demands of the aged do not go down.

340
0:16:17.584,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Essentially, sleep fragments and becomes less robust,

341
0:16:20.903,000 --> 0:16:22,000
but sleep requirements do not go down.

342
0:16:23.674,000 --> 0:16:26,000
And the fourth myth is early to bed, early to rise

343
0:16:27.603,000 --> 0:16:29,000
makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.

344
0:16:30.27,000 --> 0:16:32,000
Well, that's wrong at so many different levels.

345
0:16:33.05,000 --> 0:16:35,000
(Laughter)

346
0:16:35.405,000 --> 0:16:39,000
There is no evidence that getting up early and going to bed early

347
0:16:39.944,000 --> 0:16:4,000
gives you more wealth at all.

348
0:16:41.388,000 --> 0:16:43,000
There's no difference in socioeconomic status.

349
0:16:44.02,000 --> 0:16:45,000
In my experience,

350
0:16:45.195,000 --> 0:16:47,000
the only difference between morning people and evening people

351
0:16:48.104,000 --> 0:16:5,000
is that those people that get up in the morning early

352
0:16:50.629,000 --> 0:16:51,000
are just horribly smug.

353
0:16:51.945,000 --> 0:16:52,000
(Laughter)

354
0:16:53.24,000 --> 0:16:56,000
(Applause)

355
0:16:56.567,000 --> 0:16:57,000
OK.

356
0:16:57.743,000 --> 0:16:58,000
So for the last few minutes,

357
0:16:59.293,000 --> 0:17:,000
what I want to do is change gears

358
0:17:01.19,000 --> 0:17:04,000
and talk about some really new, breaking areas of neuroscience,

359
0:17:04.963,000 --> 0:17:06,000
which is the association between mental health,

360
0:17:07.871,000 --> 0:17:09,000
mental illness and sleep disruption.

361
0:17:10.189,000 --> 0:17:14,000
We've known for 130 years that in severe mental illness,

362
0:17:14.313,000 --> 0:17:17,000
there is always, always sleep disruption,

363
0:17:17.621,000 --> 0:17:18,000
but it's been largely ignored.

364
0:17:19.103,000 --> 0:17:21,000
In the 1970s, when people started to think about this again,

365
0:17:21.951,000 --> 0:17:24,000
they said, "Yes, well, of course you have sleep disruption in schizophrenia,

366
0:17:25.781,000 --> 0:17:27,000
because they're on antipsychotics.

367
0:17:27.852,000 --> 0:17:3,000
It's the antipsychotics causing the sleep problems,"

368
0:17:30.888,000 --> 0:17:32,000
ignoring the fact that for a hundred years previously,

369
0:17:33.841,000 --> 0:17:36,000
sleep disruption had been reported before antipsychotics.

370
0:17:37.846,000 --> 0:17:38,000
So what's going on?

371
0:17:39.67,000 --> 0:17:42,000
Several groups are studying

372
0:17:42.698,000 --> 0:17:45,000
conditions like depression, schizophrenia and bipolar

373
0:17:46.02,000 --> 0:17:48,000
and what's going on in terms of sleep disruption.

374
0:17:48.77,000 --> 0:17:51,000
We have a big study which we published last year on schizophrenia,

375
0:17:52.508,000 --> 0:17:55,000
and the data were quite extraordinary.

376
0:17:55.981,000 --> 0:17:57,000
In those individuals with schizophrenia,

377
0:17:58.957,000 --> 0:18:01,000
much of the time, they were awake during the night phase

378
0:18:02.874,000 --> 0:18:04,000
and then they were asleep during the day.

379
0:18:05.088,000 --> 0:18:07,000
Other groups showed no 24-hour patterns whatsoever --

380
0:18:07.651,000 --> 0:18:08,000
their sleep was absolutely smashed.

381
0:18:09.62,000 --> 0:18:13,000
And some had no ability to regulate their sleep by the light-dark cycle.

382
0:18:13.808,000 --> 0:18:16,000
They were getting up later and later and later and later each night.

383
0:18:17.074,000 --> 0:18:18,000
It was smashed.

384
0:18:18.371,000 --> 0:18:2,000
So what's going on?

385
0:18:20.582,000 --> 0:18:21,000
And the really exciting news

386
0:18:22.13,000 --> 0:18:27,000
is that mental illness and sleep are not simply associated,

387
0:18:27.733,000 --> 0:18:29,000
but they are physically linked within the brain.

388
0:18:30.471,000 --> 0:18:32,000
The neural networks that predispose you to normal sleep,

389
0:18:33.429,000 --> 0:18:34,000
give you normal sleep,

390
0:18:34.714,000 --> 0:18:37,000
and those that give you normal mental health, are overlapping.

391
0:18:38.344,000 --> 0:18:39,000
And what's the evidence for that?

392
0:18:40.027,000 --> 0:18:42,000
Well, genes that have been shown

393
0:18:42.964,000 --> 0:18:44,000
to be very important in the generation of normal sleep,

394
0:18:45.918,000 --> 0:18:46,000
when mutated, when changed,

395
0:18:47.685,000 --> 0:18:5,000
also predispose individuals to mental health problems.

396
0:18:51.041,000 --> 0:18:52,000
And last year, we published a study

397
0:18:53.026,000 --> 0:18:56,000
which showed that a gene that's been linked to schizophrenia,

398
0:18:56.413,000 --> 0:18:59,000
when mutated, also smashes the sleep.

399
0:18:59.793,000 --> 0:19:02,000
So we have evidence of a genuine mechanistic overlap

400
0:19:03.14,000 --> 0:19:05,000
between these two important systems.

401
0:19:05.806,000 --> 0:19:07,000
Other work flowed from these studies.

402
0:19:07.83,000 --> 0:19:1,000
The first was that sleep disruption

403
0:19:11.03,000 --> 0:19:14,000
actually precedes certain types of mental illness,

404
0:19:14.932,000 --> 0:19:16,000
and we've shown that in those young individuals

405
0:19:17.368,000 --> 0:19:2,000
who are at high risk of developing bipolar disorder,

406
0:19:20.777,000 --> 0:19:22,000
they already have a sleep abnormality

407
0:19:23.294,000 --> 0:19:26,000
prior to any clinical diagnosis of bipolar.

408
0:19:27.463,000 --> 0:19:32,000
The other bit of data was that sleep disruption

409
0:19:33.212,000 --> 0:19:37,000
may actually exacerbate, make worse, the mental illness state.

410
0:19:37.378,000 --> 0:19:39,000
My colleague Dan Freeman has used a range of agents

411
0:19:40.04,000 --> 0:19:43,000
which have stabilized sleep and reduced levels of paranoia

412
0:19:43.608,000 --> 0:19:45,000
in those individuals by 50 percent.

413
0:19:46.189,000 --> 0:19:47,000
So what have we got?

414
0:19:47.808,000 --> 0:19:52,000
We've got, in these connections, some really exciting things.

415
0:19:53.721,000 --> 0:19:54,000
In terms of the neuroscience,

416
0:19:55.147,000 --> 0:19:56,000
by understanding these two systems,

417
0:19:56.917,000 --> 0:19:59,000
we're really beginning to understand how both sleep and mental illness

418
0:20:00.241,000 --> 0:20:02,000
are generated and regulated within the brain.

419
0:20:03.128,000 --> 0:20:06,000
The second area is that if we can use sleep

420
0:20:06.843,000 --> 0:20:08,000
and sleep disruption as an early warning signal,

421
0:20:09.351,000 --> 0:20:11,000
then we have the chance of going in.

422
0:20:11.621,000 --> 0:20:13,000
If we know these individuals are vulnerable,

423
0:20:14.05,000 --> 0:20:16,000
early intervention then becomes possible.

424
0:20:16.593,000 --> 0:20:18,000
And the third, which I think is the most exciting,

425
0:20:19.188,000 --> 0:20:21,000
is that we can think of the sleep centers within the brain

426
0:20:21.99,000 --> 0:20:22,000
as a new therapeutic target.

427
0:20:23.37,000 --> 0:20:25,000
Stabilize sleep in those individuals who are vulnerable,

428
0:20:26.284,000 --> 0:20:27,000
we can certainly make them healthier,

429
0:20:28.295,000 --> 0:20:32,000
but also alleviate some of the appalling symptoms of mental illness.

430
0:20:33.01,000 --> 0:20:34,000
So let me just finish.

431
0:20:34.396,000 --> 0:20:37,000
What I started by saying is: Take sleep seriously.

432
0:20:37.687,000 --> 0:20:39,000
Our attitudes toward sleep are so very different

433
0:20:40.16,000 --> 0:20:41,000
from a pre-industrial age,

434
0:20:41.709,000 --> 0:20:43,000
when we were almost wrapped in a duvet.

435
0:20:43.836,000 --> 0:20:46,000
We used to understand intuitively the importance of sleep.

436
0:20:47.299,000 --> 0:20:5,000
And this isn't some sort of crystal-waving nonsense.

437
0:20:50.878,000 --> 0:20:52,000
This is a pragmatic response to good health.

438
0:20:53.522,000 --> 0:20:55,000
If you have good sleep, it increases your concentration,

439
0:20:56.363,000 --> 0:20:59,000
attention, decision-making, creativity, social skills, health.

440
0:21:00.372,000 --> 0:21:04,000
If you get sleep, it reduces your mood changes, your stress,

441
0:21:04.721,000 --> 0:21:06,000
your levels of anger, your impulsivity,

442
0:21:06.878,000 --> 0:21:08,000
and your tendency to drink and take drugs.

443
0:21:09.495,000 --> 0:21:11,000
And we finished by saying

444
0:21:12.354,000 --> 0:21:15,000
that an understanding of the neuroscience of sleep

445
0:21:15.504,000 --> 0:21:17,000
is really informing the way we think

446
0:21:18.332,000 --> 0:21:2,000
about some of the causes of mental illness,

447
0:21:20.866,000 --> 0:21:22,000
and indeed is providing us new ways

448
0:21:22.946,000 --> 0:21:25,000
to treat these incredibly debilitating conditions.

449
0:21:27.666,000 --> 0:21:3,000
Jim Butcher, the fantasy writer, said,

450
0:21:31.5,000 --> 0:21:33,000
"Sleep is God. Go worship."

451
0:21:33.545,000 --> 0:21:35,000
And I can only recommend that you do the same.

452
0:21:35.776,000 --> 0:21:36,000
Thank you for your attention.

453
0:21:37.228,000 --> 0:21:4,000
(Applause)

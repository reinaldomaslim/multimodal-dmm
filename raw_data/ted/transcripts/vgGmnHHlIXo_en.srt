1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
So, indeed, I have spent my life

2
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive.

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Waking up with Abraham Lincoln in the morning,

4
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
thinking of Franklin Roosevelt when I went to bed at night.

5
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
But when I try and think about what I've learned

6
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
about the meaning in life, my mind keeps wandering back

7
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
to a seminar that I took when I was a graduate student at Harvard

8
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
with the great psychologist Erik Erikson.

9
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
He taught us that the richest and fullest lives

10
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
attempt to achieve an inner balance between three realms:

11
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
work, love and play.

12
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the other,

13
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
is to open oneself to ultimate sadness in older age.

14
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Whereas to pursue all three with equal dedication,

15
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
is to make possible a life filled not only with achievement,

16
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
but with serenity.

17
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
So since I tell stories, let me look back

18
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
on the lives of two of the presidents I've studied to illustrate this point --

19
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson.

20
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
As for that first sphere of work,

21
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I think what Abraham Lincoln's life suggests

22
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
is that fierce ambition is a good thing.

23
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
He had a huge ambition.

24
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
But it wasn't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame --

25
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
what it was for was to accomplish something worthy enough in life

26
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it.

27
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Even as a child, it seemed, Lincoln dreamed heroic dreams.

28
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
He somehow had to escape that hard-scrabble farm

29
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
from which he was born.

30
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
No schooling was possible for him,

31
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
except a few weeks here, a few weeks there.

32
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
But he read books in every spare moment he could find.

33
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
It was said when he got a copy of the King James Bible

34
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
or "Aesop's Fables," he was so excited he couldn't sleep.

35
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
He couldn't eat.

36
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
The great poet Emily Dickinson once said,

37
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
"There is no frigate like a book to take us lands away."

38
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
How true for Lincoln.

39
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Though he never would travel to Europe,

40
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
he went with Shakespeare's kings to merry England,

41
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
he went with Lord Byron's poetry to Spain and Portugal.

42
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings.

43
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
But there were so many losses in his early life

44
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that he was haunted by death.

45
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
His mother died when he was only nine years old;

46
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
his only sister, Sarah, in childbirth a few years later;

47
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and his first love, Ann Rutledge, at the age of 22.

48
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Moreover, when his mother lay dying,

49
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
she did not hold out for him the hope

50
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
that they would meet in an afterworld.

51
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
She simply said to him,

52
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
"Abraham, I'm going away from you now, and I shall never return."

53
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
As a result he became obsessed with the thought

54
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that when we die our life is swept away -- dust to dust.

55
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But only as he grew older did he develop

56
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
a certain consolation from an ancient Greek notion --

57
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
but followed by other cultures as well --

58
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
that if you could accomplish something worthy in your life,

59
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
you could live on in the memory of others.

60
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
Your honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence.

61
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And that worthy ambition became his lodestar.

62
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
It carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered

63
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
when he was in his early 30s.

64
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Three things had combined to lay him low.

65
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
He had broken his engagement with Mary Todd,

66
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
not certain he was ready to marry her,

67
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
but knowing how devastating it was to her that he did that.

68
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
His one intimate friend, Joshua Speed, was leaving Illinois

69
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
to go back to Kentucky because Speed's father had died.

70
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And his political career in the state legislature

71
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
was on a downward slide.

72
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
He was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal.

73
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
They took all knives and razors and scissors from his room.

74
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And his great friend Speed went to his side and said,

75
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
"Lincoln, you must rally or you will die."

76
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
He said that, "I would just as soon die right now,

77
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
but I've not yet done anything to make any human being

78
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
remember that I have lived."

79
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So fueled by that ambition, he returned to the state legislature.

80
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
He eventually won a seat in Congress.

81
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
He then ran twice for the Senate, lost twice.

82
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
"Everyone is broken by life," Ernest Hemingway once said,

83
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
"but some people are stronger in the broken places."

84
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So then he surprised the nation with an upset victory

85
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
for the presidency over three far more experienced,

86
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
far more educated, far more celebrated rivals.

87
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And then when he won the general election,

88
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
he stunned the nation even more

89
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
by appointing each of these three rivals into his Cabinet.

90
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
It was an unprecedented act at the time because everybody thought,

91
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
"He'll look like a figurehead compared to these people."

92
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
They said, "Why are you doing this, Lincoln?"

93
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
He said, "Look, these are the strongest

94
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and most able men in the country.

95
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
The country is in peril. I need them by my side."

96
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
But perhaps my old friend Lyndon Johnson

97
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
might have put it in less noble fashion:

98
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
"Better to have your enemies inside the tent pissing out,

99
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
than outside the tent pissing in."

100
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Laughter)

101
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
But it soon became clear that Abraham Lincoln

102
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
would emerge as the undisputed captain of this unruly team.

103
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
For each of them soon came to understand

104
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that he possessed an unparalleled array of

105
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
emotional strengths and political skills

106
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that proved far more important than the thinness of his external résumé.

107
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
For one thing, he possessed an uncanny ability

108
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
to empathize with and to think about other peoples' point of view.

109
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
He repaired injured feelings that might have escalated

110
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
into permanent hostility.

111
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
He shared credit with ease,

112
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
assumed responsibility for the failure of his subordinates,

113
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
constantly acknowledged his errors and learned from his mistakes.

114
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
These are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in 2008.

115
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
(Applause)

116
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
He refused to be provoked by petty grievances.

117
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
He never submitted to jealousy or brooded over perceived slights.

118
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And he expressed his unshakeable convictions

119
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
in everyday language, in metaphors, in stories.

120
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And with a beauty of language -- almost as if

121
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
the Shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child

122
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
had worked their way into his very soul.

123
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
In 1863, when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed,

124
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
he brought his old friend, Joshua Speed, back to the White House,

125
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and remembered that conversation of decades before, when he was so sad.

126
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And he, pointing to the Proclamation, said,

127
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
"I believe, in this measure, my fondest hopes will be realized."

128
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
But as he was about to put his signature on the Proclamation

129
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
his own hand was numb and shaking

130
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
because he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a New Year's reception.

131
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
So he put the pen down.

132
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
He said, "If ever my soul were in an act, it is in this act.

133
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
But if I sign with a shaking hand,

134
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
posterity will say, 'He hesitated.'"

135
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
So he waited until he could take up the pen

136
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and sign with a bold and clear hand.

137
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
But even in his wildest dreams,

138
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Lincoln could never have imagined

139
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
how far his reputation would reach.

140
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I was so thrilled to find an interview with the great Russian writer,

141
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Leo Tolstoy, in a New York newspaper in the early 1900s.

142
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And in it, Tolstoy told of a trip that he'd recently made

143
0:06:44.33,000 --> 0:06:46,000
to a very remote area of the Caucasus,

144
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
where there were only wild barbarians,

145
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
who had never left this part of Russia.

146
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Knowing that Tolstoy was in their midst,

147
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
they asked him to tell stories of the great men of history.

148
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So he said, "I told them about Napoleon

149
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and Alexander the Great and Frederick the Great

150
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
and Julius Caesar, and they loved it.

151
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
But before I finished, the chief of the barbarians stood up and said,

152
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:07,000
'But wait, you haven't told us about the greatest ruler of them all.

153
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:1,000
We want to hear about that man who spoke with a voice of thunder,

154
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
who laughed like the sunrise,

155
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
who came from that place called America, which is so far from here,

156
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
that if a young man should travel there,

157
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
he would be an old man when he arrived.

158
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Tell us of that man. Tell us of Abraham Lincoln.'"

159
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
He was stunned.

160
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
He told them everything he could about Lincoln.

161
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And then in the interview he said, "What made Lincoln so great?

162
0:07:28.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Not as great a general as Napoleon,

163
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
not as great a statesman as Frederick the Great."

164
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
But his greatness consisted, and historians would roundly agree,

165
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
in the integrity of his character

166
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and the moral fiber of his being.

167
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
So in the end that powerful ambition

168
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that had carried Lincoln through his bleak childhood had been realized.

169
0:07:45.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
That ambition that had allowed him to laboriously educate himself by himself,

170
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
to go through that string of political failures

171
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and the darkest days of the war.

172
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
His story would be told.

173
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
So as for that second sphere, not of work, but of love --

174
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
encompassing family, friends and colleagues --

175
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
it, too, takes work and commitment.

176
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
The Lyndon Johnson that I saw in the last years of his life,

177
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
when I helped him on his memoirs,

178
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of

179
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
work, power and individual success,

180
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
that he had absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left

181
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
to get him through the days

182
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
once the presidency was gone.

183
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
My relationship with him began on a rather curious level.

184
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I was selected as a White House Fellow when I was 24 years old.

185
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
We had a big dance at the White House.

186
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
President Johnson did dance with me that night.

187
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Not that peculiar --

188
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
there were only three women out of the 16 White House Fellows.

189
0:08:36.33,000 --> 0:08:39,000
But he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me

190
0:08:39.33,000 --> 0:08:41,000
to work directly for him in the White House.

191
0:08:41.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
But it was not to be that simple.

192
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
For in the months leading up to my selection,

193
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
like many young people, I'd been active

194
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
in the anti-Vietnam War movement,

195
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and had written an article against Lyndon Johnson,

196
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
which unfortunately came out in The New Republic

197
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
two days after the dance in the White House.

198
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
(Laugher)

199
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And the theme of the article was how to remove Lyndon Johnson from power.

200
0:08:59.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
(Laughter)

201
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So I was certain he would kick me out of the program.

202
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
But instead, surprisingly, he said,

203
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
"Oh, bring her down here for a year,

204
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and if I can't win her over, no one can."

205
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
So I did end up working for him in the White House.

206
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Eventually accompanied him to his ranch to help him on those memoirs,

207
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
never fully understanding why he'd chosen me to spend so many hours with.

208
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I like to believe it was because I was a good listener.

209
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
He was a great storyteller.

210
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Fabulous, colorful, anecdotal stories.

211
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
There was a problem with these stories, however,

212
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
which I later discovered, which is that half of them weren't true.

213
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
But they were great, nonetheless.

214
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
(Laughter)

215
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
So I think that part of his attraction for me was that I loved listening to his tall tales.

216
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
But I also worried that part of it was that I was then a young woman.

217
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation.

218
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:43,000
So I constantly chatted to him about boyfriends,

219
0:09:43.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
even when I didn't have any at all.

220
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Everything was working perfectly,

221
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
until one day he said he wanted to discuss our relationship.

222
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Sounded very ominous when he took me nearby to the lake,

223
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
conveniently called Lake Lyndon Baines Johnson.

224
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And there was wine and cheese and a red-checked tablecloth --

225
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
all the romantic trappings.

226
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And he started out,

227
0:09:59.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
"Doris, more than any other woman I have ever known ... "

228
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And my heart sank.

229
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And then he said,

230
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
"You remind me of my mother."

231
0:10:06.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
(Laughter)

232
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
It was pretty embarrassing, given what was going on in my mind.

233
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
But I must say, the older I've gotten,

234
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:17,000
the more I realize what an incredible privilege it was

235
0:10:17.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
to have spent so many hours with this aging lion of a man.

236
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
A victor in a thousand contests,

237
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
three great civil rights laws, Medicare, aid to education.

238
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And yet, roundly defeated in the end by the war in Vietnam.

239
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And because he was so sad and so vulnerable,

240
0:10:32.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
he opened up to me in ways he never would have

241
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
had I known him at the height of his power --

242
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
sharing his fears, his sorrows and his worries.

243
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And I'd like to believe that the privilege fired within me

244
0:10:42.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
the drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure,

245
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that I've tried to bring to each of my books since then.

246
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
But it also brought home to me the lessons

247
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
which Erik Erikson had tried to instill in all of us

248
0:10:54.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
about the importance of finding balance in life.

249
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
For on the surface, Lyndon Johnson should have had

250
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:03,000
everything in the world to feel good about in those last years,

251
0:11:03.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
in the sense that he had been elected to the presidency;

252
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
he had all the money he needed to pursue

253
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
any leisure activity he wanted;

254
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
he owned a spacious ranch in the countryside, a penthouse in the city,

255
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
sailboats, speedboats.

256
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
He had servants to answer any whim,

257
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and he had a family who loved him deeply.

258
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And yet, years of concentration solely on work and individual success

259
0:11:23.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
meant that in his retirement he could find no solace

260
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
in family, in recreation, in sports or in hobbies.

261
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
It was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large

262
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
that even the love of a family, without work, could not fill it.

263
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
As his spirits sagged, his body deteriorated

264
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
until, I believe, he slowly brought about his own death.

265
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
In those last years, he said he was so sad

266
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:5,000
watching the American people look toward a new president and forgetting him.

267
0:11:50.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
He spoke with immense sadness in his voice,

268
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:54,000
saying maybe he should have spent more time with his children,

269
0:11:54.33,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and their children in turn.

270
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
But it was too late.

271
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
Despite all that power, all that wealth,

272
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
he was alone when he finally died --

273
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
his ultimate terror realized.

274
0:12:05.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So as for that third sphere of play,

275
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:09,000
which he never had learned to enjoy,

276
0:12:09.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
I've learned over the years

277
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
that even this sphere requires a commitment of time and energy --

278
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:18,000
enough so that a hobby, a sport, a love of music,

279
0:12:18.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
or art, or literature, or any form of recreation,

280
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
can provide true pleasure, relaxation and replenishment.

281
0:12:25.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
So deep, for instance, was Abraham Lincoln's love of Shakespeare,

282
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:32,000
that he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theater,

283
0:12:32.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
even during those dark days of the war.

284
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
He said, when the lights went down and a Shakespeare play came on,

285
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:4,000
for a few precious hours he could imagine himself

286
0:12:40.33,000 --> 0:12:42,000
back in Prince Hal's time.

287
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
But an even more important form of relaxation for him,

288
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:47,000
that Lyndon Johnson never could enjoy,

289
0:12:47.33,000 --> 0:12:51,000
was a love of -- somehow -- humor,

290
0:12:51.33,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and feeling out what hilarious parts of life can produce

291
0:12:54.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
as a sidelight to the sadness.

292
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
He once said that he laughed so he did not cry,

293
0:13:00.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
that a good story, for him, was better than a drop of whiskey.

294
0:13:04.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
His storytelling powers had first been recognized

295
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
when he was on the circuit in Illinois.

296
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
The lawyers and the judges would travel

297
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
from one county courthouse to the other,

298
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and when anyone was knowing Lincoln was in town,

299
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:16,000
they would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories.

300
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
He would stand with his back against a fire

301
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and entertain the crowd for hours with his winding tales.

302
0:13:22.33,000 --> 0:13:24,000
And all these stories became part of his memory bank,

303
0:13:24.33,000 --> 0:13:27,000
so he could call on them whenever he needed to.

304
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And they're not quite what you might expect from our marble monument.

305
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
One of his favorite stories, for example,

306
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
had to do with the Revolutionary War hero, Ethan Allen.

307
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And as Lincoln told the story,

308
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Mr. Allen went to Britain after the war.

309
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And the British people were still upset

310
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:41,000
about losing the Revolution,

311
0:13:41.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
so they decided to embarrass him a little bit

312
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
by putting a huge picture of General Washington

313
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:48,000
in the only outhouse, where he'd have to encounter it.

314
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
They figured he'd be upset about the indignity

315
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:52,000
of George Washington being in an outhouse.

316
0:13:52.33,000 --> 0:13:54,000
But he came out of the outhouse not upset at all.

317
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And so they said, "Well, did you see George Washington in there?"

318
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
"Oh, yes," he said, "perfectly appropriate place for him."

319
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
"What do you mean?" they said.

320
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:05,000
"Well," he said, "there's nothing to make an Englishman shit

321
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:08,000
faster than the sight of General George Washington."

322
0:14:08.33,000 --> 0:14:1,000
(Laughter)

323
0:14:10.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
(Applause)

324
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
So you can imagine, if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting --

325
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and he had hundreds of these stories --

326
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:2,000
you would have to relax.

327
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:23,000
So between his nightly treks to the theater,

328
0:14:23.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
his story telling, and his extraordinary sense of humor

329
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:29,000
and his love of quoting Shakespeare and poetry,

330
0:14:29.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
he found that form of play which carried him through his days.

331
0:14:33.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
In my own life, I shall always be grateful

332
0:14:36.33,000 --> 0:14:39,000
for having found a form of play in my irrational love of baseball.

333
0:14:39.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Which allows me, from the beginning of spring training

334
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:43,000
to the end of the fall,

335
0:14:43.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
to have something to occupy my mind and heart

336
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:47,000
other than my work.

337
0:14:47.33,000 --> 0:14:49,000
It all began when I was only six years old,

338
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping score

339
0:14:51.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000
while listening to baseball games --

340
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:56,000
so that when he went to work in New York during the day,

341
0:14:56.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
I could record for him the history of that afternoon's

342
0:14:58.33,000 --> 0:15:,000
Brooklyn Dodgers game.

343
0:15:00.33,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Now, when you're only six years old,

344
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and your father comes home every single night

345
0:15:02.33,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and listens to you -- as I now realize that I, in excruciating detail,

346
0:15:06.33,000 --> 0:15:07,000
recounted every single play of every inning

347
0:15:07.33,000 --> 0:15:1,000
of the game that had just taken place that afternoon.

348
0:15:10.33,000 --> 0:15:13,000
But he made me feel I was telling him a fabulous story.

349
0:15:13.33,000 --> 0:15:15,000
It makes you think there's something magic about history

350
0:15:15.33,000 --> 0:15:17,000
to keep your father's attention.

351
0:15:17.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
In fact, I'm convinced I learned the narrative art

352
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
from those nightly sessions with my father.

353
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Because at first, I'd be so excited I would blurt out,

354
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:25,000
"The Dodgers won!" or, "The Dodgers lost!"

355
0:15:25.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Which took much of the drama of this two-hour telling away.

356
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:29,000
(Laughter)

357
0:15:29.33,000 --> 0:15:31,000
So I finally learned you had to tell a story

358
0:15:31.33,000 --> 0:15:32,000
from beginning to middle to end.

359
0:15:33.33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
I must say, so fervent was my love

360
0:15:35.33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
of the old Brooklyn Dodgers in those days

361
0:15:37.33,000 --> 0:15:39,000
that I had to confess in my first confession

362
0:15:39.33,000 --> 0:15:41,000
two sins that related to baseball.

363
0:15:41.33,000 --> 0:15:44,000
The first occurred because the Dodgers' catcher, Roy Campanella,

364
0:15:44.33,000 --> 0:15:46,000
came to my hometown of Rockville Centre, Long Island,

365
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:49,000
just as I was in preparation for my first Holy Communion.

366
0:15:49.33,000 --> 0:15:51,000
And I was so excited --

367
0:15:51.33,000 --> 0:15:53,000
first person I'd ever see outside of Ebbets Field.

368
0:15:53.33,000 --> 0:15:56,000
But it so happened he was speaking in a Protestant Church.

369
0:15:56.33,000 --> 0:15:57,000
When you are brought up as a Catholic, you think

370
0:15:57.33,000 --> 0:15:59,000
that if you ever set foot in a Protestant Church,

371
0:15:59.33,000 --> 0:16:01,000
you'll be struck dead at the threshold.

372
0:16:01.33,000 --> 0:16:03,000
So I went to my father in tears, "What are we going to do?"

373
0:16:03.33,000 --> 0:16:05,000
He said, "Don't worry. He's speaking in a parish hall.

374
0:16:05.33,000 --> 0:16:07,000
We're sitting in folding chairs. He's talking about sportsmanship.

375
0:16:07.33,000 --> 0:16:08,000
It's not a sin."

376
0:16:08.33,000 --> 0:16:11,000
But as I left that night, I was certain that somehow

377
0:16:11.33,000 --> 0:16:13,000
I'd traded the life of my everlasting soul

378
0:16:13.33,000 --> 0:16:15,000
for this one night with Roy Campanella.

379
0:16:15.33,000 --> 0:16:16,000
(Laughter)

380
0:16:16.33,000 --> 0:16:19,000
And there were no indulgences around that I could buy.

381
0:16:19.33,000 --> 0:16:22,000
So I had this sin on my soul when I went to my first confession.

382
0:16:22.33,000 --> 0:16:23,000
I told the priest right away.

383
0:16:23.33,000 --> 0:16:25,000
He said, "No problem. It wasn't a religious service."

384
0:16:25.33,000 --> 0:16:28,000
But then, unfortunately, he said, "And what else, my child?"

385
0:16:28.33,000 --> 0:16:3,000
And then came my second sin.

386
0:16:30.33,000 --> 0:16:32,000
I tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church,

387
0:16:32.33,000 --> 0:16:35,000
wishing harm to others, being mean to my sisters.

388
0:16:35.33,000 --> 0:16:37,000
And he said, "To whom did you wish harm?"

389
0:16:37.33,000 --> 0:16:41,000
And I had to say that I wished that various New York Yankees players

390
0:16:41.33,000 --> 0:16:43,000
would break arms, legs and ankles --

391
0:16:43.33,000 --> 0:16:44,000
(Laughter)

392
0:16:44.33,000 --> 0:16:47,000
-- so that the Brooklyn Dodgers could win their first World Series.

393
0:16:47.33,000 --> 0:16:48,000
He said, "How often do you make these horrible wishes?"

394
0:16:48.33,000 --> 0:16:51,000
And I had to say, every night when I said my prayers.

395
0:16:51.33,000 --> 0:16:52,000
(Laughter)

396
0:16:52.33,000 --> 0:16:53,000
So he said, "Look, I'll tell you something.

397
0:16:53.33,000 --> 0:16:55,000
I love the Brooklyn Dodgers, as you do,

398
0:16:55.33,000 --> 0:16:58,000
but I promise you some day they will win fairly and squarely.

399
0:16:58.33,000 --> 0:17:,000
You do not need to wish harm on others to make it happen."

400
0:17:00.33,000 --> 0:17:01,000
"Oh yes," I said.

401
0:17:01.33,000 --> 0:17:04,000
But luckily, my first confession -- to a baseball-loving priest!

402
0:17:04.33,000 --> 0:17:05,000
(Laughter)

403
0:17:05.33,000 --> 0:17:08,000
Well, though my father died of a sudden heart attack

404
0:17:08.33,000 --> 0:17:09,000
when I was still in my 20s,

405
0:17:09.33,000 --> 0:17:13,000
before I had gotten married and had my three sons,

406
0:17:13.33,000 --> 0:17:17,000
I have passed his memory -- as well as his love of baseball -- on to my boys.

407
0:17:17.33,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Though when the Dodgers abandoned us to come to L.A.,

408
0:17:19.33,000 --> 0:17:23,000
I lost faith in baseball until I moved to Boston

409
0:17:23.33,000 --> 0:17:25,000
and became an irrational Red Sox fan.

410
0:17:26.33,000 --> 0:17:28,000
And I must say, even now, when I sit with my sons

411
0:17:28.33,000 --> 0:17:3,000
with our season tickets,

412
0:17:30.33,000 --> 0:17:32,000
I can sometimes close my eyes against the sun

413
0:17:32.33,000 --> 0:17:36,000
and imagine myself, a young girl once more, in the presence of my father,

414
0:17:36.33,000 --> 0:17:39,000
watching the players of my youth on the grassy fields below:

415
0:17:39.33,000 --> 0:17:43,000
Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Pee Wee Reese, and Duke Snider.

416
0:17:43.33,000 --> 0:17:45,000
I must say there is magic in these moments.

417
0:17:45.33,000 --> 0:17:47,000
When I open my eyes and I see my sons

418
0:17:47.33,000 --> 0:17:49,000
in the place where my father once sat,

419
0:17:50.33,000 --> 0:17:52,000
I feel an invisible loyalty and love

420
0:17:52.33,000 --> 0:17:56,000
linking my sons to the grandfather whose face they never had a chance to see,

421
0:17:56.33,000 --> 0:17:58,000
but whose heart and soul they have come to know

422
0:17:58.33,000 --> 0:18:01,000
through all the stories I have told.

423
0:18:01.33,000 --> 0:18:04,000
Which is why, in the end, I shall always be grateful for this curious love of history,

424
0:18:04.33,000 --> 0:18:08,000
allowing me to spend a lifetime looking back into the past.

425
0:18:08.33,000 --> 0:18:11,000
Allowing me to learn from these large figures

426
0:18:11.33,000 --> 0:18:13,000
about the struggle for meaning for life.

427
0:18:13.33,000 --> 0:18:15,000
Allowing me to believe that the private people

428
0:18:15.33,000 --> 0:18:17,000
we have loved and lost in our families,

429
0:18:17.33,000 --> 0:18:2,000
and the public figures we have respected in our history,

430
0:18:20.33,000 --> 0:18:22,000
just as Abraham Lincoln wanted to believe,

431
0:18:22.33,000 --> 0:18:25,000
really can live on, so long as we pledge

432
0:18:25.33,000 --> 0:18:29,000
to tell and to retell the stories of their lives.

433
0:18:29.33,000 --> 0:18:31,000
Thank you for letting me be that storyteller today.

434
0:18:31.33,000 --> 0:18:32,000
(Applause)

435
0:18:32.33,000 --> 0:18:35,000
Thank you.

1
0:00:12.38,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm going to speak to you about the global refugee crisis

2
0:00:16.18,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and my aim is to show you that this crisis

3
0:00:20.02,000 --> 0:00:22,000
is manageable, not unsolvable,

4
0:00:23.78,000 --> 0:00:28,000
but also show you that this is as much about us and who we are

5
0:00:29.1,000 --> 0:00:32,000
as it is a trial of the refugees on the front line.

6
0:00:33.14,000 --> 0:00:35,000
For me, this is not just a professional obligation,

7
0:00:35.98,000 --> 0:00:39,000
because I run an NGO supporting refugees and displaced people around the world.

8
0:00:40.94,000 --> 0:00:41,000
It's personal.

9
0:00:43.14,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I love this picture.

10
0:00:45.74,000 --> 0:00:47,000
That really handsome guy on the right,

11
0:00:47.86,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that's not me.

12
0:00:49.58,000 --> 0:00:52,000
That's my dad, Ralph, in London, in 1940

13
0:00:53.18,000 --> 0:00:54,000
with his father Samuel.

14
0:00:55.74,000 --> 0:00:57,000
They were Jewish refugees from Belgium.

15
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
They fled the day the Nazis invaded.

16
0:01:02.42,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And I love this picture, too.

17
0:01:04.46,000 --> 0:01:06,000
It's a group of refugee children

18
0:01:07.3,000 --> 0:01:09,000
arriving in England in 1946 from Poland.

19
0:01:10.82,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And in the middle is my mother, Marion.

20
0:01:14.46,000 --> 0:01:17,000
She was sent to start a new life

21
0:01:17.5,000 --> 0:01:18,000
in a new country

22
0:01:19.02,000 --> 0:01:2,000
on her own

23
0:01:20.3,000 --> 0:01:21,000
at the age of 12.

24
0:01:22.74,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I know this:

25
0:01:24.38,000 --> 0:01:27,000
if Britain had not admitted refugees

26
0:01:27.66,000 --> 0:01:28,000
in the 1940s,

27
0:01:29.62,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I certainly would not be here today.

28
0:01:34.06,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Yet 70 years on, the wheel has come full circle.

29
0:01:38.66,000 --> 0:01:41,000
The sound is of walls being built,

30
0:01:41.7,000 --> 0:01:43,000
vengeful political rhetoric,

31
0:01:44.22,000 --> 0:01:47,000
humanitarian values and principles on fire

32
0:01:48.58,000 --> 0:01:51,000
in the very countries that 70 years ago said never again

33
0:01:52.5,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to statelessness and hopelessness for the victims of war.

34
0:01:58.42,000 --> 0:02:,000
Last year, every minute,

35
0:02:02.14,000 --> 0:02:05,000
24 more people were displaced from their homes

36
0:02:05.5,000 --> 0:02:07,000
by conflict, violence and persecution:

37
0:02:08.98,000 --> 0:02:1,000
another chemical weapon attack in Syria,

38
0:02:11.7,000 --> 0:02:14,000
the Taliban on the rampage in Afghanistan,

39
0:02:15.18,000 --> 0:02:2,000
girls driven from their school in northeast Nigeria by Boko Haram.

40
0:02:21.62,000 --> 0:02:24,000
These are not people moving to another country

41
0:02:25.14,000 --> 0:02:26,000
to get a better life.

42
0:02:27.1,000 --> 0:02:28,000
They're fleeing for their lives.

43
0:02:30.9,000 --> 0:02:31,000
It's a real tragedy

44
0:02:33.34,000 --> 0:02:38,000
that the world's most famous refugee can't come to speak to you here today.

45
0:02:39.06,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Many of you will know this picture.

46
0:02:41.62,000 --> 0:02:43,000
It shows the lifeless body

47
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
of five-year-old Alan Kurdi,

48
0:02:46.38,000 --> 0:02:5,000
a Syrian refugee who died in the Mediterranean in 2015.

49
0:02:50.86,000 --> 0:02:54,000
He died alongside 3,700 others trying to get to Europe.

50
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
The next year, 2016,

51
0:02:58.54,000 --> 0:03:,000
5,000 people died.

52
0:03:02.66,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It's too late for them,

53
0:03:05.06,000 --> 0:03:07,000
but it's not too late for millions of others.

54
0:03:07.82,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It's not too late for people like Frederick.

55
0:03:10.46,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I met him in the Nyarugusu refugee camp in Tanzania.

56
0:03:13.98,000 --> 0:03:14,000
He's from Burundi.

57
0:03:15.54,000 --> 0:03:17,000
He wanted to know where could he complete his studies.

58
0:03:18.14,000 --> 0:03:21,000
He'd done 11 years of schooling. He wanted a 12th year.

59
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
He said to me, "I pray that my days do not end here

60
0:03:25.9,000 --> 0:03:26,000
in this refugee camp."

61
0:03:28.02,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And it's not too late for Halud.

62
0:03:31.3,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Her parents were Palestinian refugees

63
0:03:34.02,000 --> 0:03:36,000
living in the Yarmouk refugee camp outside Damascus.

64
0:03:37.3,000 --> 0:03:38,000
She was born to refugee parents,

65
0:03:38.86,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and now she's a refugee herself in Lebanon.

66
0:03:42.34,000 --> 0:03:45,000
She's working for the International Rescue Committee to help other refugees,

67
0:03:46.66,000 --> 0:03:48,000
but she has no certainty at all

68
0:03:49.66,000 --> 0:03:51,000
about her future,

69
0:03:51.82,000 --> 0:03:52,000
where it is or what it holds.

70
0:03:54.22,000 --> 0:03:57,000
This talk is about Frederick, about Halud

71
0:03:58.14,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and about millions like them:

72
0:04:00.14,000 --> 0:04:01,000
why they're displaced,

73
0:04:02.1,000 --> 0:04:06,000
how they survive, what help they need and what our responsibilities are.

74
0:04:07.42,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I truly believe this,

75
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that the biggest question in the 21st century

76
0:04:13.58,000 --> 0:04:16,000
concerns our duty to strangers.

77
0:04:17.14,000 --> 0:04:2,000
The future "you" is about your duties

78
0:04:20.42,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to strangers.

79
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
You know better than anyone,

80
0:04:23.66,000 --> 0:04:26,000
the world is more connected than ever before,

81
0:04:28.339,000 --> 0:04:29,000
yet the great danger

82
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
is that we're consumed by our divisions.

83
0:04:33.82,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And there is no better test of that

84
0:04:36.1,000 --> 0:04:37,000
than how we treat refugees.

85
0:04:38.66,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Here are the facts: 65 million people

86
0:04:41.62,000 --> 0:04:44,000
displaced from their homes by violence and persecution last year.

87
0:04:44.86,000 --> 0:04:45,000
If it was a country,

88
0:04:46.62,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that would be the 21st largest country in the world.

89
0:04:50.7,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Most of those people, about 40 million, stay within their own home country,

90
0:04:55.62,000 --> 0:04:56,000
but 25 million are refugees.

91
0:04:57.22,000 --> 0:05:,000
That means they cross a border into a neighboring state.

92
0:05:00.94,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Most of them are living in poor countries,

93
0:05:04.98,000 --> 0:05:07,000
relatively poor or lower-middle-income countries, like Lebanon,

94
0:05:08.02,000 --> 0:05:09,000
where Halud is living.

95
0:05:10.7,000 --> 0:05:13,000
In Lebanon, one in four people is a refugee,

96
0:05:15.38,000 --> 0:05:18,000
a quarter of the whole population.

97
0:05:18.66,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And refugees stay for a long time.

98
0:05:20.78,000 --> 0:05:22,000
The average length of displacement

99
0:05:22.9,000 --> 0:05:23,000
is 10 years.

100
0:05:25.14,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I went to what was the world's largest refugee camp, in eastern Kenya.

101
0:05:29.9,000 --> 0:05:3,000
It's called Dadaab.

102
0:05:31.14,000 --> 0:05:33,000
It was built in 1991-92

103
0:05:33.3,000 --> 0:05:36,000
as a "temporary camp" for Somalis fleeing the civil war.

104
0:05:37.74,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I met Silo.

105
0:05:39.54,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And naïvely I said to Silo,

106
0:05:42.38,000 --> 0:05:44,000
"Do you think you'll ever go home to Somalia?"

107
0:05:45.7,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And she said, "What do you mean, go home?

108
0:05:48.14,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I was born here."

109
0:05:50.54,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And then when I asked the camp management

110
0:05:52.66,000 --> 0:05:56,000
how many of the 330,000 people in that camp were born there,

111
0:05:56.74,000 --> 0:05:57,000
they gave me the answer:

112
0:05:58.98,000 --> 0:05:59,000
100,000.

113
0:06:01.66,000 --> 0:06:03,000
That's what long-term displacement means.

114
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Now, the causes of this are deep:

115
0:06:07.74,000 --> 0:06:09,000
weak states that can't support their own people,

116
0:06:10.66,000 --> 0:06:12,000
an international political system

117
0:06:13.1,000 --> 0:06:15,000
weaker than at any time since 1945

118
0:06:16.14,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and differences over theology, governance, engagement with the outside world

119
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
in significant parts of the Muslim world.

120
0:06:24.5,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Now, those are long-term, generational challenges.

121
0:06:27.7,000 --> 0:06:3,000
That's why I say that this refugee crisis is a trend and not a blip.

122
0:06:32.18,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And it's complex, and when you have big, large, long-term, complex problems,

123
0:06:36.74,000 --> 0:06:37,000
people think nothing can be done.

124
0:06:39.94,000 --> 0:06:41,000
When Pope Francis went to Lampedusa,

125
0:06:43.18,000 --> 0:06:44,000
off the coast of Italy, in 2014,

126
0:06:44.78,000 --> 0:06:47,000
he accused all of us and the global population

127
0:06:48.1,000 --> 0:06:51,000
of what he called "the globalization of indifference."

128
0:06:52.58,000 --> 0:06:53,000
It's a haunting phrase.

129
0:06:53.82,000 --> 0:06:56,000
It means that our hearts have turned to stone.

130
0:06:58.38,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Now, I don't know, you tell me.

131
0:07:00.22,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Are you allowed to argue with the Pope, even at a TED conference?

132
0:07:04.7,000 --> 0:07:05,000
But I think it's not right.

133
0:07:06.14,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I think people do want to make a difference,

134
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
but they just don't know whether there are any solutions to this crisis.

135
0:07:11.98,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And what I want to tell you today

136
0:07:13.82,000 --> 0:07:16,000
is that though the problems are real, the solutions are real, too.

137
0:07:17.62,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Solution one:

138
0:07:18.98,000 --> 0:07:21,000
these refugees need to get into work in the countries where they're living,

139
0:07:22.58,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and the countries where they're living need massive economic support.

140
0:07:25.86,000 --> 0:07:26,000
In Uganda in 2014, they did a study:

141
0:07:28.5,000 --> 0:07:3,000
80 percent of refugees in the capital city Kampala

142
0:07:31.42,000 --> 0:07:33,000
needed no humanitarian aid because they were working.

143
0:07:34.18,000 --> 0:07:35,000
They were supported into work.

144
0:07:36.22,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Solution number two:

145
0:07:38.02,000 --> 0:07:42,000
education for kids is a lifeline, not a luxury,

146
0:07:42.1,000 --> 0:07:43,000
when you're displaced for so long.

147
0:07:45.3,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Kids can bounce back when they're given the proper social, emotional support

148
0:07:49.42,000 --> 0:07:5,000
alongside literacy and numeracy.

149
0:07:51.18,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I've seen it for myself.

150
0:07:54.5,000 --> 0:07:57,000
But half of the world's refugee children of primary school age

151
0:07:57.86,000 --> 0:07:58,000
get no education at all,

152
0:07:59.86,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and three-quarters of secondary school age get no education at all.

153
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
That's crazy.

154
0:08:05.58,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Solution number three:

155
0:08:08.1,000 --> 0:08:11,000
most refugees are in urban areas, in cities, not in camps.

156
0:08:11.58,000 --> 0:08:13,000
What would you or I want if we were a refugee in a city?

157
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
We would want money to pay rent or buy clothes.

158
0:08:18.42,000 --> 0:08:2,000
That is the future of the humanitarian system,

159
0:08:20.62,000 --> 0:08:21,000
or a significant part of it:

160
0:08:22.02,000 --> 0:08:24,000
give people cash so that you boost the power of refugees

161
0:08:24.7,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and you'll help the local economy.

162
0:08:26.7,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And there's a fourth solution, too,

163
0:08:28.7,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that's controversial but needs to be talked about.

164
0:08:31.46,000 --> 0:08:34,000
The most vulnerable refugees need to be given a new start

165
0:08:34.98,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and a new life in a new country,

166
0:08:37.94,000 --> 0:08:38,000
including in the West.

167
0:08:39.9,000 --> 0:08:42,000
The numbers are relatively small, hundreds of thousands, not millions,

168
0:08:44.14,000 --> 0:08:46,000
but the symbolism is huge.

169
0:08:47.7,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Now is not the time to be banning refugees,

170
0:08:50.42,000 --> 0:08:51,000
as the Trump administration proposes.

171
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
It's a time to be embracing people who are victims of terror.

172
0:08:55.979,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And remember --

173
0:08:57.22,000 --> 0:08:59,000
(Applause)

174
0:09:04.3,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Remember, anyone who asks you, "Are they properly vetted?"

175
0:09:08.06,000 --> 0:09:11,000
that's a really sensible and good question to ask.

176
0:09:12.1,000 --> 0:09:16,000
The truth is, refugees arriving for resettlement

177
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
are more vetted than any other population arriving in our countries.

178
0:09:19.94,000 --> 0:09:21,000
So while it's reasonable to ask the question,

179
0:09:22.1,000 --> 0:09:25,000
it's not reasonable to say that refugee is another word for terrorist.

180
0:09:26.94,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Now, what happens --

181
0:09:28.18,000 --> 0:09:31,000
(Applause)

182
0:09:31.58,000 --> 0:09:34,000
What happens when refugees can't get work,

183
0:09:34.74,000 --> 0:09:35,000
they can't get their kids into school,

184
0:09:36.62,000 --> 0:09:39,000
they can't get cash, they can't get a legal route to hope?

185
0:09:39.7,000 --> 0:09:41,000
What happens is they take risky journeys.

186
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
I went to Lesbos, this beautiful Greek island, two years ago.

187
0:09:47.02,000 --> 0:09:48,000
It's a home to 90,000 people.

188
0:09:48.9,000 --> 0:09:51,000
In one year, 500,000 refugees went across the island.

189
0:09:53.06,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And I want to show you what I saw

190
0:09:54.9,000 --> 0:09:57,000
when I drove across to the north of the island:

191
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
a pile of life jackets of those who had made it to shore.

192
0:10:02.66,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And when I looked closer,

193
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
there were small life jackets for children,

194
0:10:06.74,000 --> 0:10:07,000
yellow ones.

195
0:10:08.14,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And I took this picture.

196
0:10:10.3,000 --> 0:10:13,000
You probably can't see the writing, but I want to read it for you.

197
0:10:13.46,000 --> 0:10:16,000
"Warning: will not protect against drowning."

198
0:10:17.74,000 --> 0:10:18,000
So in the 21st century,

199
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
children are being given life jackets

200
0:10:22.54,000 --> 0:10:24,000
to reach safety in Europe

201
0:10:24.7,000 --> 0:10:27,000
even though those jackets will not save their lives

202
0:10:28.06,000 --> 0:10:3,000
if they fall out of the boat that is taking them there.

203
0:10:32.62,000 --> 0:10:35,000
This is not just a crisis, it's a test.

204
0:10:37.58,000 --> 0:10:39,000
It's a test that civilizations have faced down the ages.

205
0:10:41.38,000 --> 0:10:42,000
It's a test of our humanity.

206
0:10:43.82,000 --> 0:10:45,000
It's a test of us in the Western world

207
0:10:46.14,000 --> 0:10:48,000
of who we are and what we stand for.

208
0:10:50.98,000 --> 0:10:52,000
It's a test of our character, not just our policies.

209
0:10:54.78,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And refugees are a hard case.

210
0:10:56.98,000 --> 0:10:58,000
They do come from faraway parts of the world.

211
0:10:59.98,000 --> 0:11:,000
They have been through trauma.

212
0:11:01.9,000 --> 0:11:03,000
They're often of a different religion.

213
0:11:04.02,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Those are precisely the reasons we should be helping refugees,

214
0:11:07.22,000 --> 0:11:08,000
not a reason not to help them.

215
0:11:09.22,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And it's a reason to help them because of what it says about us.

216
0:11:14.3,000 --> 0:11:15,000
It's revealing of our values.

217
0:11:16.94,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Empathy and altruism are two of the foundations of civilization.

218
0:11:23.14,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Turn that empathy and altruism into action

219
0:11:25.58,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and we live out a basic moral credo.

220
0:11:28.78,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And in the modern world, we have no excuse.

221
0:11:31.06,000 --> 0:11:35,000
We can't say we don't know what's happening in Juba, South Sudan,

222
0:11:35.18,000 --> 0:11:36,000
or Aleppo, Syria.

223
0:11:36.78,000 --> 0:11:38,000
It's there, in our smartphone

224
0:11:39.7,000 --> 0:11:4,000
in our hand.

225
0:11:41.1,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Ignorance is no excuse at all.

226
0:11:43.7,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Fail to help, and we show we have no moral compass at all.

227
0:11:48.9,000 --> 0:11:51,000
It's also revealing about whether we know our own history.

228
0:11:52.78,000 --> 0:11:54,000
The reason that refugees have rights around the world

229
0:11:55.3,000 --> 0:11:57,000
is because of extraordinary Western leadership

230
0:11:58.1,000 --> 0:12:,000
by statesmen and women after the Second World War

231
0:12:00.46,000 --> 0:12:01,000
that became universal rights.

232
0:12:03.46,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Trash the protections of refugees, and we trash our own history.

233
0:12:08.22,000 --> 0:12:09,000
This is --

234
0:12:09.46,000 --> 0:12:1,000
(Applause)

235
0:12:11.18,000 --> 0:12:15,000
This is also revealing about the power of democracy

236
0:12:15.22,000 --> 0:12:17,000
as a refuge from dictatorship.

237
0:12:17.5,000 --> 0:12:19,000
How many politicians have you heard say,

238
0:12:20.58,000 --> 0:12:24,000
"We believe in the power of our example, not the example of our power."

239
0:12:25.42,000 --> 0:12:28,000
What they mean is what we stand for is more important than the bombs we drop.

240
0:12:30.18,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Refugees seeking sanctuary

241
0:12:32.62,000 --> 0:12:35,000
have seen the West as a source of hope and a place of haven.

242
0:12:38.54,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Russians, Iranians,

243
0:12:41.3,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Chinese, Eritreans, Cubans,

244
0:12:43.62,000 --> 0:12:45,000
they've come to the West for safety.

245
0:12:47.3,000 --> 0:12:48,000
We throw that away at our peril.

246
0:12:49.94,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And there's one other thing it reveals about us:

247
0:12:52.22,000 --> 0:12:54,000
whether we have any humility for our own mistakes.

248
0:12:55.14,000 --> 0:12:56,000
I'm not one of these people

249
0:12:57.02,000 --> 0:13:,000
who believes that all the problems in the world are caused by the West.

250
0:13:00.38,000 --> 0:13:01,000
They're not.

251
0:13:01.62,000 --> 0:13:03,000
But when we make mistakes, we should recognize it.

252
0:13:04.7,000 --> 0:13:06,000
It's not an accident that the country which has taken

253
0:13:07.22,000 --> 0:13:09,000
more refugees than any other, the United States,

254
0:13:09.5,000 --> 0:13:12,000
has taken more refugees from Vietnam than any other country.

255
0:13:13.78,000 --> 0:13:14,000
It speaks to the history.

256
0:13:16.02,000 --> 0:13:18,000
But there's more recent history, in Iraq and Afghanistan.

257
0:13:19.38,000 --> 0:13:22,000
You can't make up for foreign policy errors

258
0:13:23.14,000 --> 0:13:24,000
by humanitarian action,

259
0:13:24.74,000 --> 0:13:27,000
but when you break something, you have a duty to try to help repair it,

260
0:13:28.66,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and that's our duty now.

261
0:13:33.34,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Do you remember at the beginning of the talk,

262
0:13:35.5,000 --> 0:13:37,000
I said I wanted to explain that the refugee crisis

263
0:13:38.02,000 --> 0:13:39,000
was manageable, not insoluble?

264
0:13:40.86,000 --> 0:13:42,000
That's true. I want you to think in a new way,

265
0:13:43.5,000 --> 0:13:45,000
but I also want you to do things.

266
0:13:47.5,000 --> 0:13:49,000
If you're an employer,

267
0:13:49.7,000 --> 0:13:5,000
hire refugees.

268
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
If you're persuaded by the arguments,

269
0:13:55.1,000 --> 0:13:56,000
take on the myths

270
0:13:56.62,000 --> 0:13:58,000
when family or friends or workmates repeat them.

271
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
If you've got money, give it to charities

272
0:14:02.54,000 --> 0:14:04,000
that make a difference for refugees around the world.

273
0:14:05.34,000 --> 0:14:06,000
If you're a citizen,

274
0:14:07.86,000 --> 0:14:09,000
vote for politicians

275
0:14:10.22,000 --> 0:14:13,000
who will put into practice the solutions that I've talked about.

276
0:14:13.86,000 --> 0:14:17,000
(Applause)

277
0:14:18.1,000 --> 0:14:2,000
The duty to strangers

278
0:14:20.3,000 --> 0:14:21,000
shows itself

279
0:14:22.3,000 --> 0:14:24,000
in small ways and big,

280
0:14:24.86,000 --> 0:14:25,000
prosaic and heroic.

281
0:14:27.62,000 --> 0:14:28,000
In 1942,

282
0:14:30.42,000 --> 0:14:32,000
my aunt and my grandmother were living in Brussels

283
0:14:32.82,000 --> 0:14:33,000
under German occupation.

284
0:14:35.82,000 --> 0:14:36,000
They received a summons

285
0:14:38.18,000 --> 0:14:41,000
from the Nazi authorities to go to Brussels Railway Station.

286
0:14:44.1,000 --> 0:14:47,000
My grandmother immediately thought something was amiss.

287
0:14:48.54,000 --> 0:14:5,000
She pleaded with her relatives

288
0:14:51.06,000 --> 0:14:53,000
not to go to Brussels Railway Station.

289
0:14:54.06,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Her relatives said to her,

290
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
"If we don't go, if we don't do what we're told,

291
0:15:00.06,000 --> 0:15:01,000
then we're going to be in trouble."

292
0:15:02.58,000 --> 0:15:03,000
You can guess what happened

293
0:15:04.54,000 --> 0:15:06,000
to the relatives who went to Brussels Railway Station.

294
0:15:07.98,000 --> 0:15:08,000
They were never seen again.

295
0:15:09.98,000 --> 0:15:1,000
But my grandmother and my aunt,

296
0:15:12.54,000 --> 0:15:14,000
they went to a small village

297
0:15:15.1,000 --> 0:15:16,000
south of Brussels

298
0:15:17.54,000 --> 0:15:2,000
where they'd been on holiday in the decade before,

299
0:15:21.1,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and they presented themselves at the house of the local farmer,

300
0:15:24.78,000 --> 0:15:26,000
a Catholic farmer called Monsieur Maurice,

301
0:15:27.66,000 --> 0:15:29,000
and they asked him to take them in.

302
0:15:30.7,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And he did,

303
0:15:32.38,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and by the end of the war,

304
0:15:34.74,000 --> 0:15:37,000
17 Jews, I was told, were living in that village.

305
0:15:40.18,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And when I was teenager, I asked my aunt,

306
0:15:42.18,000 --> 0:15:44,000
"Can you take me to meet Monsieur Maurice?"

307
0:15:45.22,000 --> 0:15:48,000
And she said, "Yeah, I can. He's still alive. Let's go and see him."

308
0:15:48.46,000 --> 0:15:49,000
And so, it must have been '83, '84,

309
0:15:51.14,000 --> 0:15:52,000
we went to see him.

310
0:15:52.54,000 --> 0:15:54,000
And I suppose, like only a teenager could,

311
0:15:55.38,000 --> 0:15:56,000
when I met him,

312
0:15:56.66,000 --> 0:15:59,000
he was this white-haired gentleman,

313
0:16:00.14,000 --> 0:16:01,000
I said to him,

314
0:16:02.98,000 --> 0:16:03,000
"Why did you do it?

315
0:16:05.22,000 --> 0:16:07,000
Why did you take that risk?"

316
0:16:09.06,000 --> 0:16:1,000
And he looked at me and he shrugged,

317
0:16:10.82,000 --> 0:16:11,000
and he said, in French,

318
0:16:13.06,000 --> 0:16:14,000
"On doit."

319
0:16:14.42,000 --> 0:16:15,000
"One must."

320
0:16:16.1,000 --> 0:16:18,000
It was innate in him.

321
0:16:18.94,000 --> 0:16:19,000
It was natural.

322
0:16:20.22,000 --> 0:16:24,000
And my point to you is it should be natural and innate in us, too.

323
0:16:24.46,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Tell yourself,

324
0:16:26.9,000 --> 0:16:28,000
this refugee crisis is manageable,

325
0:16:29.42,000 --> 0:16:3,000
not unsolvable,

326
0:16:31.02,000 --> 0:16:32,000
and each one of us

327
0:16:33.14,000 --> 0:16:36,000
has a personal responsibility to help make it so.

328
0:16:37.06,000 --> 0:16:41,000
Because this is about the rescue of us and our values

329
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
as well as the rescue of refugees and their lives.

330
0:16:44.14,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Thank you very much indeed.

331
0:16:45.46,000 --> 0:16:48,000
(Applause)

332
0:16:56.94,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Bruno Giussani: David, thank you. David Miliband: Thank you.

333
0:16:59.82,000 --> 0:17:,000
BG: Those are strong suggestions

334
0:17:01.42,000 --> 0:17:04,000
and your call for individual responsibility is very strong as well,

335
0:17:04.62,000 --> 0:17:06,000
but I'm troubled by one thought, and it's this:

336
0:17:06.86,000 --> 0:17:1,000
you mentioned, and these are your words, "extraordinary Western leadership"

337
0:17:10.9,000 --> 0:17:11,000
which led 60-something years ago

338
0:17:12.78,000 --> 0:17:14,000
to the whole discussion about human rights,

339
0:17:14.86,000 --> 0:17:16,000
to the conventions on refugees, etc. etc.

340
0:17:19.06,000 --> 0:17:21,000
That leadership happened after a big trauma

341
0:17:21.46,000 --> 0:17:24,000
and happened in a consensual political space,

342
0:17:25.46,000 --> 0:17:27,000
and now we are in a divisive political space.

343
0:17:27.62,000 --> 0:17:29,000
Actually, refugees have become one of the divisive issues.

344
0:17:30.38,000 --> 0:17:31,000
So where will leadership come from today?

345
0:17:32.98,000 --> 0:17:34,000
DM: Well, I think that you're right to say

346
0:17:35.46,000 --> 0:17:37,000
that the leadership forged in war

347
0:17:38.58,000 --> 0:17:4,000
has a different temper and a different tempo

348
0:17:40.86,000 --> 0:17:41,000
and a different outlook

349
0:17:42.14,000 --> 0:17:44,000
than leadership forged in peace.

350
0:17:45.38,000 --> 0:17:48,000
And so my answer would be the leadership has got to come from below,

351
0:17:49.14,000 --> 0:17:5,000
not from above.

352
0:17:50.62,000 --> 0:17:53,000
I mean, a recurring theme of the conference this week

353
0:17:53.98,000 --> 0:17:56,000
has been about the democratization of power.

354
0:17:57.82,000 --> 0:17:59,000
And we've got to preserve our own democracies,

355
0:18:00.02,000 --> 0:18:02,000
but we've got to also activate our own democracies.

356
0:18:02.54,000 --> 0:18:03,000
And when people say to me,

357
0:18:04.38,000 --> 0:18:05,000
"There's a backlash against refugees,"

358
0:18:06.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
what I say to them is,

359
0:18:07.54,000 --> 0:18:09,000
"No, there's a polarization,

360
0:18:09.66,000 --> 0:18:1,000
and at the moment,

361
0:18:10.9,000 --> 0:18:12,000
those who are fearful are making more noise

362
0:18:12.924,000 --> 0:18:13,000
than those who are proud."

363
0:18:14.46,000 --> 0:18:17,000
And so my answer to your question is that we will sponsor and encourage

364
0:18:18.46,000 --> 0:18:19,000
and give confidence to leadership

365
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:21,000
when we mobilize ourselves.

366
0:18:22.06,000 --> 0:18:25,000
And I think that when you are in a position of looking for leadership,

367
0:18:25.38,000 --> 0:18:26,000
you have to look inside

368
0:18:26.74,000 --> 0:18:27,000
and mobilize in your own community

369
0:18:28.46,000 --> 0:18:31,000
to try to create conditions for a different kind of settlement.

370
0:18:31.7,000 --> 0:18:33,000
BG: Thank you, David. Thanks for coming to TED.

371
0:18:33.94,000 --> 0:18:36,000
(Applause)

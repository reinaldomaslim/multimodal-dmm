1
0:00:14.76,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Here's a question that matters.

2
0:00:16.88,000 --> 0:00:17,000
[Is it ethical to evolve the human body?]

3
0:00:18.88,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Because we're beginning to get all the tools together to evolve ourselves.

4
0:00:22.4,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And we can evolve bacteria and we can evolve plants

5
0:00:24.84,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and we can evolve animals,

6
0:00:26.28,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and we're now reaching a point where we really have to ask,

7
0:00:29.12,000 --> 0:00:31,000
is it really ethical and do we want to evolve human beings?

8
0:00:33.44,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And as you're thinking about that,

9
0:00:35.36,000 --> 0:00:38,000
let me talk about that in the context of prosthetics,

10
0:00:39.12,000 --> 0:00:41,000
prosthetics past, present, future.

11
0:00:42.92,000 --> 0:00:43,000
So this is the iron hand

12
0:00:44.52,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that belonged to one of the German counts.

13
0:00:46.88,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Loved to fight, lost his arm in one of these battles.

14
0:00:51.32,000 --> 0:00:53,000
No problem, he just made a suit of armor,

15
0:00:53.8,000 --> 0:00:54,000
put it on,

16
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
perfect prosthetic.

17
0:00:56.44,000 --> 0:00:59,000
That's where the concept of ruling with an iron fist comes from.

18
0:01:01.6,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And of course these prosthetics have been getting more and more useful,

19
0:01:05.08,000 --> 0:01:06,000
more and more modern.

20
0:01:06.36,000 --> 0:01:08,000
You can hold soft-boiled eggs.

21
0:01:08.84,000 --> 0:01:11,000
You can have all types of controls, and as you're thinking about that,

22
0:01:12.36,000 --> 0:01:14,000
there are wonderful people like Hugh Herr

23
0:01:14.4,000 --> 0:01:16,000
who have been building absolutely extraordinary prosthetics.

24
0:01:17.72,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So the wonderful Aimee Mullins will go out and say,

25
0:01:20.56,000 --> 0:01:21,000
how tall do I want to be tonight?

26
0:01:23.04,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Or Hugh will say what type of cliff do I want to climb?

27
0:01:25.96,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Or does somebody want to run a marathon, or does somebody want to ballroom dance?

28
0:01:30.48,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And as you adapt these things,

29
0:01:32.48,000 --> 0:01:36,000
the interesting thing about prosthetics is they've been coming inside the body.

30
0:01:36.64,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So these external prosthetics have now become artificial knees.

31
0:01:39.64,000 --> 0:01:41,000
They've become artificial hips.

32
0:01:41.72,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And then they've evolved further

33
0:01:43.96,000 --> 0:01:45,000
to become not just nice to have

34
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:47,000
but essential to have.

35
0:01:47.92,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So when you're talking about a heart pacemaker as a prosthetic,

36
0:01:51.8,000 --> 0:01:54,000
you're talking about something that isn't just, "I'm missing my leg,"

37
0:01:55.52,000 --> 0:01:57,000
it's, "if I don't have this, I can die."

38
0:01:57.96,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And at that point, a prosthetic becomes a symbiotic relationship

39
0:02:02.08,000 --> 0:02:03,000
with the human body.

40
0:02:04.56,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And four of the smartest people that I've ever met --

41
0:02:07.12,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Ed Boyden, Hugh Herr, Joe Jacobson, Bob Lander --

42
0:02:12.4,000 --> 0:02:14,000
are working on a Center for Extreme Bionics.

43
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And the interesting thing of what you're seeing here is

44
0:02:17.64,000 --> 0:02:19,000
these prosthetics now get integrated into the bone.

45
0:02:20.08,000 --> 0:02:21,000
They get integrated into the skin.

46
0:02:21.759,000 --> 0:02:22,000
They get integrated into the muscle.

47
0:02:24.36,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And one of the other sides of Ed

48
0:02:27.36,000 --> 0:02:29,000
is he's been thinking about how to connect the brain

49
0:02:30.28,000 --> 0:02:32,000
using light or other mechanisms

50
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
directly to things like these prosthetics.

51
0:02:36.52,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And if you can do that,

52
0:02:37.8,000 --> 0:02:4,000
then you can begin changing fundamental aspects of humanity.

53
0:02:41.84,000 --> 0:02:45,000
So how quickly you react to something depends on the diameter of a nerve.

54
0:02:46.92,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And of course, if you have nerves that are external or prosthetic,

55
0:02:51.6,000 --> 0:02:52,000
say with light or liquid metal,

56
0:02:54.28,000 --> 0:02:55,000
then you can increase that diameter

57
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and you could even increase it theoretically to the point where,

58
0:02:59.08,000 --> 0:03:03,000
as long as you could see the muzzle flash, you could step out of the way of a bullet.

59
0:03:03.84,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Those are the order of magnitude of changes you're talking about.

60
0:03:08.2,000 --> 0:03:1,000
This is a fourth sort of level of prosthetics.

61
0:03:10.8,000 --> 0:03:12,000
These are Phonak hearing aids,

62
0:03:13.36,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and the reason why these are so interesting

63
0:03:15.44,000 --> 0:03:18,000
is because they cross the threshold from where prosthetics are something

64
0:03:18.88,000 --> 0:03:19,000
for somebody who is "disabled"

65
0:03:21.56,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and they become something that somebody who is "normal"

66
0:03:25.64,000 --> 0:03:26,000
might want to actually have,

67
0:03:27.56,000 --> 0:03:29,000
because what this prosthetic does, which is really interesting,

68
0:03:30.56,000 --> 0:03:31,000
is not only does it help you hear,

69
0:03:32.24,000 --> 0:03:33,000
you can focus your hearing,

70
0:03:33.6,000 --> 0:03:35,000
so it can hear the conversation going on over there.

71
0:03:36.08,000 --> 0:03:37,000
You can have superhearing.

72
0:03:37.36,000 --> 0:03:39,000
You can have hearing in 360 degrees. You can have white noise.

73
0:03:40.32,000 --> 0:03:43,000
You can record, and oh, by the way, they also put a phone into this.

74
0:03:44.44,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So this functions as your hearing aid and also as your phone.

75
0:03:47.92,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And at that point, somebody might actually want to have a prosthetic voluntarily.

76
0:03:54.4,000 --> 0:03:56,000
All of these thousands of loosely connected little pieces

77
0:03:57.12,000 --> 0:03:58,000
are coming together,

78
0:03:59.12,000 --> 0:04:,000
and it's about time we ask the question,

79
0:04:01.08,000 --> 0:04:04,000
how do we want to evolve human beings over the next century or two?

80
0:04:05.64,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And for that we turn to a great philosopher

81
0:04:08.92,000 --> 0:04:11,000
who was a very smart man despite being a Yankee fan.

82
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:13,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:14.8,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And Yogi Berra used to say, of course, that it's very tough to make predictions,

84
0:04:18.64,000 --> 0:04:19,000
especially about the future.

85
0:04:20.04,000 --> 0:04:21,000
(Laughter)

86
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So instead of making a prediction about the future to begin with,

87
0:04:24.24,000 --> 0:04:27,000
let's take what's happening in the present with people like Tony Atala,

88
0:04:27.6,000 --> 0:04:29,000
who is redesigning 30-some-odd organs.

89
0:04:31.2,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And maybe the ultimate prosthetic isn't having something external, titanium.

90
0:04:34.8,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Maybe the ultimate prosthetic is take your own gene code,

91
0:04:37.52,000 --> 0:04:38,000
remake your own body parts,

92
0:04:39.92,000 --> 0:04:42,000
because that's a whole lot more effective than any kind of a prosthetic.

93
0:04:44.44,000 --> 0:04:48,000
But while you're at it, then you can take the work of Craig Venter and Ham Smith.

94
0:04:48.48,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And one of the things that we've been doing

95
0:04:50.56,000 --> 0:04:52,000
is trying to figure out how to reprogram cells.

96
0:04:54.28,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And if you can reprogram a cell,

97
0:04:55.88,000 --> 0:04:57,000
then you can change the cells in those organs.

98
0:04:59.4,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So if you can change the cells in those organs,

99
0:05:01.64,000 --> 0:05:03,000
maybe you make those organs more radiation-resistant.

100
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Maybe you make them absorb more oxygen.

101
0:05:06.08,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Maybe you make them more efficient

102
0:05:07.76,000 --> 0:05:09,000
to filter out stuff that you don't want in your body.

103
0:05:11.44,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And over the last few weeks, George Church has been in the news a lot

104
0:05:15.12,000 --> 0:05:18,000
because he's been talking about taking one of these programmable cells

105
0:05:18.44,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and inserting an entire human genome

106
0:05:20.2,000 --> 0:05:21,000
into that cell.

107
0:05:22.48,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And once you can insert an entire human genome into a cell,

108
0:05:26.32,000 --> 0:05:28,000
then you begin to ask the question,

109
0:05:28.48,000 --> 0:05:3,000
would you want to enhance any of that genome?

110
0:05:33.44,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Do you want to enhance a human body?

111
0:05:35.8,000 --> 0:05:37,000
How would you want to enhance a human body?

112
0:05:38.12,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Where is it ethical to enhance a human body

113
0:05:40.24,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and where is it not ethical to enhance a human body?

114
0:05:43.52,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And all of a sudden, what we're doing

115
0:05:45.44,000 --> 0:05:47,000
is we've got this multidimensional chess board

116
0:05:48.4,000 --> 0:05:51,000
where we can change human genetics by using viruses

117
0:05:51.68,000 --> 0:05:52,000
to attack things like AIDS,

118
0:05:54.12,000 --> 0:05:56,000
or we can change the gene code through gene therapy

119
0:05:56.56,000 --> 0:05:58,000
to do away with some hereditary diseases,

120
0:05:59.52,000 --> 0:06:,000
or we can change the environment,

121
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and change the expression of those genes in the epigenome

122
0:06:03.851,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and pass that on to the next generations.

123
0:06:07.32,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And all of a sudden, it's not just one little bit,

124
0:06:10.48,000 --> 0:06:11,000
it's all these stacked little bits

125
0:06:12.36,000 --> 0:06:14,000
that allow you to take little portions of it

126
0:06:15.28,000 --> 0:06:17,000
until all the portions coming together

127
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
lead you to something that's very different.

128
0:06:21.6,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And a lot of people are very scared by this stuff.

129
0:06:24.36,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And it does sound scary, and there are risks to this stuff.

130
0:06:28.04,000 --> 0:06:3,000
So why in the world would you ever want to do this stuff?

131
0:06:30.76,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Why would we really want to alter the human body

132
0:06:33.8,000 --> 0:06:34,000
in a fundamental way?

133
0:06:37.04,000 --> 0:06:39,000
The answer lies in part

134
0:06:39.36,000 --> 0:06:4,000
with Lord Rees,

135
0:06:41.24,000 --> 0:06:42,000
astronomer royal of Great Britain.

136
0:06:44.56,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And one of his favorite sayings is the universe is 100 percent malevolent.

137
0:06:48.4,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So what does that mean?

138
0:06:49.64,000 --> 0:06:51,000
It means if you take any one of your bodies at random,

139
0:06:52.56,000 --> 0:06:53,000
drop it anywhere in the universe,

140
0:06:54.48,000 --> 0:06:55,000
drop it in space, you die.

141
0:06:56.72,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Drop it on the Sun, you die.

142
0:06:58.12,000 --> 0:07:,000
Drop it on the surface of Mercury, you die.

143
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Drop it near a supernova, you die.

144
0:07:02.24,000 --> 0:07:05,000
But fortunately, it's only about 80 percent effective.

145
0:07:06.64,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So as a great physicist once said,

146
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:14,000
there's these little upstream eddies of biology

147
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that create order in this rapid torrent of entropy.

148
0:07:20.08,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So as the universe dissipates energy,

149
0:07:23.08,000 --> 0:07:26,000
there's these upstream eddies that create biological order.

150
0:07:27.96,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Now, the problem with eddies is,

151
0:07:30.4,000 --> 0:07:31,000
they tend to disappear.

152
0:07:31.92,000 --> 0:07:32,000
They shift. They move in rivers.

153
0:07:34.68,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And because of that, when an eddy shifts,

154
0:07:36.68,000 --> 0:07:39,000
when the Earth becomes a snowball, when the Earth becomes very hot,

155
0:07:40.24,000 --> 0:07:43,000
when the Earth gets hit by an asteroid, when you have supervolcanoes,

156
0:07:43.52,000 --> 0:07:44,000
when you have solar flares,

157
0:07:45.4,000 --> 0:07:48,000
when you have potentially extinction-level events

158
0:07:48.76,000 --> 0:07:49,000
like the next election --

159
0:07:5,000 --> 0:07:52,000
(Laughter)

160
0:07:53.44,000 --> 0:07:56,000
then all of a sudden, you can have periodic extinctions.

161
0:07:57.4,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And by the way, that's happened five times on Earth,

162
0:08:00.36,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and therefore it is very likely

163
0:08:02.48,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that the human species on Earth is going to go extinct someday.

164
0:08:06.44,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Not next week,

165
0:08:07.96,000 --> 0:08:08,000
not next month,

166
0:08:09.8,000 --> 0:08:11,000
maybe in November, but maybe 10,000 years after that.

167
0:08:13.88,000 --> 0:08:15,000
As you're thinking of the consequence of that,

168
0:08:16.72,000 --> 0:08:19,000
if you believe that extinctions are common and natural

169
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and normal and occur periodically,

170
0:08:22.48,000 --> 0:08:24,000
it becomes a moral imperative to diversify our species.

171
0:08:26.52,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And it becomes a moral imperative

172
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
because it's going to be really hard to live on Mars

173
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
if we don't fundamentally modify the human body.

174
0:08:34.88,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Right?

175
0:08:36.12,000 --> 0:08:37,000
You go from one cell,

176
0:08:37.48,000 --> 0:08:39,000
mom and dad coming together to make one cell,

177
0:08:39.72,000 --> 0:08:41,000
in a cascade to 10 trillion cells.

178
0:08:41.92,000 --> 0:08:45,000
We don't know, if you change the gravity substantially,

179
0:08:46.4,000 --> 0:08:48,000
if the same thing will happen to create your body.

180
0:08:50.159,000 --> 0:08:53,000
We do know that if you expose our bodies as they currently are

181
0:08:53.24,000 --> 0:08:55,000
to a lot of radiation, we will die.

182
0:08:57.04,000 --> 0:09:,000
So as you're thinking of that, you have to really redesign things

183
0:09:00.12,000 --> 0:09:01,000
just to get to Mars.

184
0:09:01.4,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Forget about the moons of Neptune or Jupiter.

185
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And to borrow from Nikolai Kardashev,

186
0:09:07.48,000 --> 0:09:09,000
let's think about life in a series of scales.

187
0:09:09.68,000 --> 0:09:11,000
So Life One civilization

188
0:09:12.2,000 --> 0:09:15,000
is a civilization that begins to alter his or her looks.

189
0:09:16.08,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And we've been doing that for thousands of years.

190
0:09:18.4,000 --> 0:09:21,000
You've got tummy tucks and you've got this and you've got that.

191
0:09:22.28,000 --> 0:09:24,000
You alter your looks, and I'm told

192
0:09:24.72,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that not all of those alterations take place for medical reasons.

193
0:09:28.68,000 --> 0:09:3,000
(Laughter)

194
0:09:30.76,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Seems odd.

195
0:09:32.36,000 --> 0:09:34,000
A Life Two civilization is a different civilization.

196
0:09:36.32,000 --> 0:09:4,000
A Life Two civilization alters fundamental aspects of the body.

197
0:09:41.84,000 --> 0:09:43,000
So you put human growth hormone in, the person grows taller,

198
0:09:44.72,000 --> 0:09:47,000
or you put x in and the person gets fatter or loses metabolism

199
0:09:48.68,000 --> 0:09:49,000
or does a whole series of things,

200
0:09:50.32,000 --> 0:09:52,000
but you're altering the functions in a fundamental way.

201
0:09:53.04,000 --> 0:09:55,000
To become an intrasolar civilization,

202
0:09:55.68,000 --> 0:09:57,000
we're going to have to create a Life Three civilization,

203
0:09:59.72,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and that looks very different from what we've got here.

204
0:10:02.84,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Maybe you splice in Deinococcus radiodurans

205
0:10:05.08,000 --> 0:10:09,000
so that the cells can resplice after a lot of exposure to radiation.

206
0:10:10.32,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Maybe you breathe by having oxygen flow through your blood

207
0:10:13.36,000 --> 0:10:14,000
instead of through your lungs.

208
0:10:15.6,000 --> 0:10:17,000
But you're talking about really radical redesigns,

209
0:10:19.48,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and one of the interesting things that's happened in the last decade

210
0:10:22.72,000 --> 0:10:24,000
is we've discovered a whole lot of planets out there.

211
0:10:25.48,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And some of them may be Earth-like.

212
0:10:29.44,000 --> 0:10:32,000
The problem is, if we ever want to get to these planets,

213
0:10:33.08,000 --> 0:10:34,000
the fastest human objects --

214
0:10:34.76,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Juno and Voyager and the rest of this stuff --

215
0:10:37.36,000 --> 0:10:39,000
take tens of thousands of years

216
0:10:39.88,000 --> 0:10:41,000
to get from here to the nearest solar system.

217
0:10:42.72,000 --> 0:10:44,000
So if you want to start exploring beaches somewhere else,

218
0:10:46.4,000 --> 0:10:48,000
or you want to see two-sun sunsets,

219
0:10:49.84,000 --> 0:10:52,000
then you're talking about something that is very different,

220
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:58,000
because you have to change the timescale and the body of humans

221
0:10:58.08,000 --> 0:11:,000
in ways which may be absolutely unrecognizable.

222
0:11:02,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And that's a Life Four civilization.

223
0:11:05.72,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Now, we can't even begin to imagine what that might look like,

224
0:11:08.68,000 --> 0:11:1,000
but we're beginning to get glimpses

225
0:11:11.04,000 --> 0:11:14,000
of instruments that might take us even that far.

226
0:11:14.96,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And let me give you two examples.

227
0:11:16.6,000 --> 0:11:17,000
So this is the wonderful Floyd Romesberg,

228
0:11:19.2,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and one of the things that Floyd's been doing

229
0:11:21.36,000 --> 0:11:23,000
is he's been playing with the basic chemistry of life.

230
0:11:23.92,000 --> 0:11:27,000
So all life on this planet is made in ATCGs, the four letters of DNA.

231
0:11:28.8,000 --> 0:11:31,000
All bacteria, all plants, all animals, all humans, all cows,

232
0:11:31.96,000 --> 0:11:32,000
everything else.

233
0:11:34.44,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And what Floyd did is he changed out two of those base pairs,

234
0:11:38.64,000 --> 0:11:39,000
so it's ATXY.

235
0:11:41.76,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And that means that you now have a parallel system to make life,

236
0:11:47.48,000 --> 0:11:51,000
to make babies, to reproduce, to evolve,

237
0:11:51.8,000 --> 0:11:53,000
that doesn't mate with most things on Earth

238
0:11:54,000 --> 0:11:55,000
or in fact maybe with nothing on Earth.

239
0:11:56.88,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Maybe you make plants that are immune to all bacteria.

240
0:11:59.44,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Maybe you make plants that are immune to all viruses.

241
0:12:01.96,000 --> 0:12:02,000
But why is that so interesting?

242
0:12:03.52,000 --> 0:12:06,000
It means that we are not a unique solution.

243
0:12:07.4,000 --> 0:12:1,000
It means you can create alternate chemistries to us

244
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
that could be chemistries adaptable to a very different planet

245
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
that could create life and heredity.

246
0:12:20.12,000 --> 0:12:21,000
The second experiment,

247
0:12:22.48,000 --> 0:12:24,000
or the other implication of this experiment,

248
0:12:25.36,000 --> 0:12:29,000
is that all of you, all life is based on 20 amino acids.

249
0:12:29.6,000 --> 0:12:31,000
If you don't substitute two amino acids,

250
0:12:32.08,000 --> 0:12:37,000
if you don't say ATXY, if you say ATCG + XY,

251
0:12:37.68,000 --> 0:12:39,000
then you go from 20 building blocks to 172,

252
0:12:41.52,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and all of a sudden you've got 172 building blocks of amino acids

253
0:12:44.68,000 --> 0:12:46,000
to build life-forms in very different shapes.

254
0:12:49.48,000 --> 0:12:52,000
The second experiment to think about is a really weird experiment

255
0:12:52.56,000 --> 0:12:54,000
that's been taking place in China.

256
0:12:55.92,000 --> 0:12:59,000
So this guy has been transplanting hundreds of mouse heads.

257
0:13:00.92,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Right?

258
0:13:02.32,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And why is that an interesting experiment?

259
0:13:05.44,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Well, think of the first heart transplants.

260
0:13:07.52,000 --> 0:13:08,000
One of the things they used to do

261
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
is they used to bring in the wife or the daughter of the donor

262
0:13:12.72,000 --> 0:13:15,000
so the donee could tell the doctors,

263
0:13:16.64,000 --> 0:13:18,000
"Do you recognize this person? Do you love this person?

264
0:13:19.28,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Do you feel anything for this person?"

265
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
We laugh about that today.

266
0:13:23.56,000 --> 0:13:25,000
We laugh because we know the heart is a muscle,

267
0:13:25.8,000 --> 0:13:28,000
but for hundreds of thousands of years, or tens of thousands of years,

268
0:13:29.32,000 --> 0:13:31,000
"I gave her my heart. She took my heart. She broke my heart."

269
0:13:32.24,000 --> 0:13:33,000
We thought this was emotion

270
0:13:33.64,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and we thought maybe emotions were transplanted with the heart. Nope.

271
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:39,000
So how about the brain?

272
0:13:41.04,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Two possible outcomes to this experiment.

273
0:13:43.88,000 --> 0:13:45,000
If you can get a mouse

274
0:13:46.32,000 --> 0:13:47,000
that is functional,

275
0:13:47.96,000 --> 0:13:48,000
then you can see,

276
0:13:50.04,000 --> 0:13:51,000
is the new brain a blank slate?

277
0:13:53.28,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And boy, does that have implications.

278
0:13:57.12,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Second option:

279
0:13:58.8,000 --> 0:14:,000
the new mouse recognizes Minnie Mouse.

280
0:14:01.76,000 --> 0:14:03,000
The new mouse remembers what it's afraid of,

281
0:14:03.88,000 --> 0:14:04,000
remembers how to navigate the maze,

282
0:14:05.6,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and if that is true,

283
0:14:08.04,000 --> 0:14:11,000
then you can transplant memory and consciousness.

284
0:14:13.08,000 --> 0:14:15,000
And then the really interesting question is,

285
0:14:15.52,000 --> 0:14:18,000
if you can transplant this, is the only input-output mechanism

286
0:14:19.48,000 --> 0:14:2,000
this down here?

287
0:14:21.44,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Or could you transplant that consciousness into something

288
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
that would be very different,

289
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
that would last in space,

290
0:14:27.44,000 --> 0:14:29,000
that would last tens of thousands of years,

291
0:14:29.52,000 --> 0:14:31,000
that would be a completely redesigned body

292
0:14:31.544,000 --> 0:14:34,000
that could hold consciousness for a long, long period of time?

293
0:14:38.04,000 --> 0:14:4,000
And let's come back to the first question:

294
0:14:40.56,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Why would you ever want to do that?

295
0:14:44.32,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Well, I'll tell you why.

296
0:14:45.6,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Because this is the ultimate selfie.

297
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:49,000
(Laughter)

298
0:14:50.44,000 --> 0:14:52,000
This is taken from six billion miles away,

299
0:14:54.04,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and that's Earth.

300
0:14:56.8,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And that's all of us.

301
0:14:59.24,000 --> 0:15:02,000
And if that little thing goes, all of humanity goes.

302
0:15:04.32,000 --> 0:15:06,000
And the reason you want to alter the human body

303
0:15:06.56,000 --> 0:15:08,000
is because you eventually want a picture that says,

304
0:15:09.36,000 --> 0:15:1,000
that's us, and that's us,

305
0:15:11.32,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and that's us,

306
0:15:12.76,000 --> 0:15:15,000
because that's the way humanity survives long-term extinction.

307
0:15:17.44,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And that's the reason why it turns out

308
0:15:19.72,000 --> 0:15:22,000
it's actually unethical not to evolve the human body

309
0:15:23.68,000 --> 0:15:26,000
even though it can be scary, even though it can be challenging,

310
0:15:27.04,000 --> 0:15:3,000
but it's what's going to allow us to explore, live

311
0:15:30.44,000 --> 0:15:32,000
and get to places we can't even dream of today,

312
0:15:33.76,000 --> 0:15:36,000
but which our great-great-great-great- grandchildren might someday.

313
0:15:37.52,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Thank you very much.

314
0:15:38.76,000 --> 0:15:43,000
(Applause)

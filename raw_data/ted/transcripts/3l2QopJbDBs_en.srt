1
0:00:12.644,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm a historian.

2
0:00:13.819,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Steve told us about the future of little technology;

3
0:00:17.936,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I'm going to show you some of the past of big technology.

4
0:00:21.997,000 --> 0:00:26,000
This was a project to build a 4,000-ton nuclear bomb-propelled spaceship

5
0:00:27.457,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and go to Saturn and Jupiter.

6
0:00:30.029,000 --> 0:00:34,000
This took place in my childhood, 1957-65.

7
0:00:34.724,000 --> 0:00:35,000
It was deeply classified.

8
0:00:36.027,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I'm going to show you some stuff that not only has not been declassified,

9
0:00:40.123,000 --> 0:00:42,000
but has now been reclassified.

10
0:00:42.653,000 --> 0:00:45,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:46.369,000 --> 0:00:48,000
If all goes well, next year I'll be back,

12
0:00:48.437,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and I'll have a lot more to show you, and if all doesn't go well,

13
0:00:51.592,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I'll be in jail, like Wen Ho Lee.

14
0:00:53.911,000 --> 0:00:56,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:58.646,000 --> 0:01:01,000
So, this ship was basically the size of the Marriott Hotel,

16
0:01:02.453,000 --> 0:01:04,000
a little taller and a little bigger.

17
0:01:04.76,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And one of the people who worked on it at the beginning

18
0:01:07.443,000 --> 0:01:09,000
was my father, Freeman, there in the middle.

19
0:01:09.535,000 --> 0:01:11,000
That's me and my sister, Esther, who's a frequent TEDster.

20
0:01:12.441,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I didn't like nuclear bomb-propelled spaceships.

21
0:01:15.627,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I mean, I thought it was a great idea, but I started building kayaks.

22
0:01:18.916,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So we had a few kayaks.

23
0:01:20.104,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Just so you know that I am not Dr. Strangelove.

24
0:01:24.319,000 --> 0:01:27,000
But all the time I was out there doing these strange kayak voyages

25
0:01:27.533,000 --> 0:01:29,000
in odd, beautiful parts of this planet,

26
0:01:30.427,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I always thought in the back of my mind about Project Orion,

27
0:01:33.76,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and how my father and his friends were going to build these big ships.

28
0:01:37.76,000 --> 0:01:39,000
They were actually going to go --

29
0:01:39.827,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Ted Taylor, who led the project, was going to take his children.

30
0:01:42.888,000 --> 0:01:44,000
My father was not going to take his children,

31
0:01:45.039,000 --> 0:01:48,000
that was one of the reasons we sort of had a falling out for a few years.

32
0:01:48.702,000 --> 0:01:51,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:52.436,000 --> 0:01:54,000
The project began in '57 at General Atomics there,

34
0:01:54.96,000 --> 0:01:55,000
that's right on the coast at La Jolla.

35
0:01:56.926,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Look at that central building right in the middle of the picture.

36
0:02:00.023,000 --> 0:02:03,000
That's the 130-foot diameter library.

37
0:02:03.383,000 --> 0:02:05,000
That is exactly the size of the base of the spaceship.

38
0:02:06.36,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So put that library at the bottom of that ship --

39
0:02:08.806,000 --> 0:02:09,000
that's how big the thing was going to be.

40
0:02:10.799,000 --> 0:02:12,000
It would take two or three thousand bombs.

41
0:02:12.869,000 --> 0:02:14,000
The people who worked on it were a lot of the Los Alamos people

42
0:02:15.87,000 --> 0:02:16,000
who had done the hydrogen bomb work.

43
0:02:17.619,000 --> 0:02:19,000
It was the first project funded by ARPA.

44
0:02:19.77,000 --> 0:02:21,000
That's the contract where ARPA gave the first million dollars

45
0:02:22.657,000 --> 0:02:23,000
to get this thing started.

46
0:02:23.928,000 --> 0:02:26,000
"Spaceship project officially begun. Job waiting for you. Dyson."

47
0:02:27.715,000 --> 0:02:28,000
That's July '58.

48
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Two days later, the space traveler's manifesto explaining why --

49
0:02:33.418,000 --> 0:02:35,000
just like we heard yesterday -- why we need to go into space:

50
0:02:36.32,000 --> 0:02:38,000
"... trips to satellites of the outer planets.

51
0:02:38.511,000 --> 0:02:39,000
August 20, 1958."

52
0:02:40.255,000 --> 0:02:44,000
These are the statistics of what would be the good places to go and stop.

53
0:02:44.636,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Some of the sizes of the ships,

54
0:02:46.149,000 --> 0:02:5,000
ranging all the way up to ship mass of 8 million tons.

55
0:02:50.355,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So that was the outer extreme.

56
0:02:51.812,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Here was version two: 2,000 bombs.

57
0:02:55.697,000 --> 0:03:,000
These are five-kiloton yield bombs, about the size of small Volkswagens;

58
0:03:01.014,000 --> 0:03:03,000
it would take 800 to get into orbit.

59
0:03:03.497,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Here we see a 10,000-ton ship will deliver 1,300 tons

60
0:03:07.941,000 --> 0:03:09,000
to Saturn and back -- essentially, a five-year trip.

61
0:03:10.779,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Possible departure dates: October 1960 to February 1967.

62
0:03:15.684,000 --> 0:03:17,000
These are trajectories going to Mars.

63
0:03:18.327,000 --> 0:03:2,000
All this was done by hand, with slide rules.

64
0:03:20.469,000 --> 0:03:21,000
The little Orion ship,

65
0:03:22.057,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and what it would take to do what Orion does with chemicals:

66
0:03:24.933,000 --> 0:03:26,000
you have a ship the size of the Empire State Building.

67
0:03:27.494,000 --> 0:03:29,000
NASA had no interest; they tried to kill the project.

68
0:03:29.998,000 --> 0:03:31,000
The people who supported it were the Air Force,

69
0:03:32.221,000 --> 0:03:33,000
which meant that it was all secret.

70
0:03:33.919,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And that's why when you get something declassified, that's what it looks like.

71
0:03:37.623,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Military weapon versions that carried hydrogen bombs

72
0:03:40.163,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that could destroy half the planet.

73
0:03:41.868,000 --> 0:03:44,000
There's another version there that sends retaliatory strikes at the Soviet Union.

74
0:03:45.716,000 --> 0:03:46,000
This is the really secret stuff:

75
0:03:47.272,000 --> 0:03:49,000
how to get directed energy explosions.

76
0:03:49.408,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So you're sending the energy of a nuclear explosion --

77
0:03:51.981,000 --> 0:03:54,000
not like just a stick of dynamite, but you're directing it at the ship.

78
0:03:55.367,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And this is still a very active subject.

79
0:03:57.655,000 --> 0:03:58,000
It's quite dangerous,

80
0:03:58.885,000 --> 0:04:,000
but I believe it's better to have dangerous things in the open

81
0:04:01.862,000 --> 0:04:03,000
than think you're going to keep them secret.

82
0:04:03.942,000 --> 0:04:05,000
This is what happened at 600 microseconds.

83
0:04:06.022,000 --> 0:04:08,000
The Air Force started to build smaller models

84
0:04:08.821,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and actually started doing this.

85
0:04:10.539,000 --> 0:04:12,000
The guys in La Jolla said, "We've got to get started now."

86
0:04:13.286,000 --> 0:04:15,000
They built a high-explosive propelled model.

87
0:04:15.71,000 --> 0:04:18,000
These are stills from film footage that was saved

88
0:04:19.456,000 --> 0:04:21,000
by someone who was supposed to destroy it but didn't,

89
0:04:22.035,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and kept it in their basement for the last 40 years.

90
0:04:24.497,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So, these are three-pound charges of C4;

91
0:04:26.437,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that's about 10 times what the guy had in his shoes.

92
0:04:29.134,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Laughter)

93
0:04:30.338,000 --> 0:04:31,000
This is Ed Day putting --

94
0:04:31.784,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So each of these coffee cans has three pounds of C4 in it.

95
0:04:35.057,000 --> 0:04:39,000
They're building a system that ejects these at quarter-second intervals.

96
0:04:39.217,000 --> 0:04:42,000
That's my dad in the sport coat there, holding the briefcase.

97
0:04:42.519,000 --> 0:04:44,000
So, they had a lot of fun doing this.

98
0:04:44.671,000 --> 0:04:45,000
But no children were allowed;

99
0:04:46.18,000 --> 0:04:49,000
my dad could tell me he was building a spaceship and going to go to Saturn,

100
0:04:49.807,000 --> 0:04:51,000
but he could not say anything more about it.

101
0:04:51.949,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So all my life I have wanted to find this stuff out,

102
0:04:54.581,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and spent the last four years tracking these old guys down.

103
0:04:57.557,000 --> 0:04:58,000
These are stills from the video.

104
0:04:59.108,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Jeff Bezos kindly, yesterday, said he'll put this video up

105
0:05:01.911,000 --> 0:05:03,000
on the Amazon site -- some little clip of it.

106
0:05:04.327,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Applause)

107
0:05:05.359,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So, thanks to him.

108
0:05:06.64,000 --> 0:05:08,000
They got quite serious about the engineering of this.

109
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
The size of that mass, for us,

110
0:05:11.305,000 --> 0:05:14,000
is really large technology in a way we're never going to go back to.

111
0:05:15.257,000 --> 0:05:16,000
If you saw the 1959 --

112
0:05:17.035,000 --> 0:05:19,000
this is what it would feel like in the passenger compartment;

113
0:05:19.919,000 --> 0:05:2,000
that's acceleration profile.

114
0:05:21.316,000 --> 0:05:22,000
(Laughter)

115
0:05:22.348,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And pulse-system yield: we're looking at 20-kiloton yield

116
0:05:26.225,000 --> 0:05:28,000
for an effective thrust of 10 million newtons.

117
0:05:28.56,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Well, here we have a little problem, the radiation doses at the crew station:

118
0:05:32.221,000 --> 0:05:34,000
700 rads per shot.

119
0:05:34.992,000 --> 0:05:35,000
(Laughter)

120
0:05:36.723,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Fission yields during development:

121
0:05:38.5,000 --> 0:05:41,000
they were hoping to get clean bombs; they didn't.

122
0:05:41.83,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Eyeburn: this is what happens to the people in Miami who are looking up.

123
0:05:46.11,000 --> 0:05:47,000
(Laughter)

124
0:05:47.558,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Personnel compartment noise: that's not too bad; it's very low frequencies,

125
0:05:51.137,000 --> 0:05:52,000
it's basically like these sub-woofers.

126
0:05:52.979,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And now we have ground-hazard assessments when you have a blow-up on the pad.

127
0:05:56.637,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Finally, at the very end in 1964, NASA steps in and says,

128
0:05:59.589,000 --> 0:06:02,000
"OK, we'll support a feasibility study for a small version

129
0:06:03.182,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that could be launched with Saturn Vs in sections and pieced together."

130
0:06:07.306,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So this is what NASA did,

131
0:06:09.355,000 --> 0:06:13,000
getting an eight-man version that would go to Mars.

132
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
They liked it because the guys could kind of live there and be like,

133
0:06:17.55,000 --> 0:06:18,000
"It's like living in a submarine."

134
0:06:19.2,000 --> 0:06:2,000
This is crew compartment.

135
0:06:20.486,000 --> 0:06:22,000
It switches, so what's upside down is right side up

136
0:06:22.893,000 --> 0:06:23,000
when you go to artificial gravity mode.

137
0:06:24.78,000 --> 0:06:26,000
The scientists were still going to go along;

138
0:06:26.866,000 --> 0:06:28,000
they would take seven astronauts and seven scientists.

139
0:06:29.415,000 --> 0:06:31,000
This is a 20-man version for going to Jupiter:

140
0:06:31.591,000 --> 0:06:32,000
bunks, storm cellars, exercise room.

141
0:06:33.387,000 --> 0:06:35,000
You know, it was going to be a nice, long trip.

142
0:06:36.058,000 --> 0:06:4,000
The Air Force version: here we have a military version.

143
0:06:40.271,000 --> 0:06:42,000
This is the kind of stuff that's not been declassified,

144
0:06:42.885,000 --> 0:06:44,000
just that people managed to sneak home and after, you know,

145
0:06:45.687,000 --> 0:06:47,000
on their deathbed, basically, gave me that.

146
0:06:49.234,000 --> 0:06:5,000
The sort of artist conceptions.

147
0:06:50.756,000 --> 0:06:52,000
These are basically PowerPoint presentations

148
0:06:52.962,000 --> 0:06:54,000
given to the Air Force 40 years ago.

149
0:06:55.047,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Look at the little guys there outside the vehicle.

150
0:06:59.712,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And one part of NASA was interested in it,

151
0:07:02.704,000 --> 0:07:04,000
but the headquarters in NASA, they killed the project.

152
0:07:06.828,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So finally, at the end,

153
0:07:09.234,000 --> 0:07:14,000
we can see the thing followed its sort of design path right up to 1965,

154
0:07:14.475,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and then all those paths came to a halt.

155
0:07:16.45,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Results: none.

156
0:07:17.935,000 --> 0:07:19,000
This project is hereby terminated.

157
0:07:19.963,000 --> 0:07:2,000
So that's the end.

158
0:07:21.865,000 --> 0:07:22,000
All I can say in closing is:

159
0:07:23.49,000 --> 0:07:27,000
we heard yesterday that one of the 10 bad things that could happen to us

160
0:07:27.817,000 --> 0:07:29,000
is an asteroid with our name on it.

161
0:07:30.431,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And one of the bad things that could happen to NASA

162
0:07:32.844,000 --> 0:07:35,000
is if that asteroid shows up with our name on it nine months out,

163
0:07:35.983,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and everybody says,

164
0:07:37.602,000 --> 0:07:38,000
"Well, what are we going to do?"

165
0:07:39.179,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And Orion is really one of the only, if not the only,

166
0:07:42.146,000 --> 0:07:46,000
off-the-shelf technologies that could do something.

167
0:07:46.251,000 --> 0:07:47,000
(Laughter)

168
0:07:48.126,000 --> 0:07:5,000
So I'm going to tell you the good news and the bad news.

169
0:07:50.784,000 --> 0:07:55,000
The good news is that NASA has a small, secret contingency-plan division

170
0:07:56.559,000 --> 0:08:,000
that is looking at this, trying to keep knowledge of Orion preserved

171
0:08:01.122,000 --> 0:08:03,000
in the event of such a misfortune.

172
0:08:03.194,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Maybe keep a few little bombs of plutonium on the side.

173
0:08:06.226,000 --> 0:08:07,000
That's the good news.

174
0:08:07.401,000 --> 0:08:09,000
The bad news is, when I got in contact with these people

175
0:08:10.052,000 --> 0:08:13,000
to try and get some documents from them, they went crazy

176
0:08:13.163,000 --> 0:08:15,000
because I had all this stuff that they don't have,

177
0:08:15.534,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and NASA purchased 1,759 pages of this stuff from me.

178
0:08:20.603,000 --> 0:08:22,000
So that's the state we're at; it's not very good.

179
0:08:23.31,000 --> 0:08:24,000
(Laughter)

180
0:08:24.596,000 --> 0:08:26,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I have a tough job to do.

2
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
You know, when I looked at the profile of the audience here,

3
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
with their connotations and design, in all its forms,

4
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and with so much and so many people working

5
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
on collaborative and networks, and so on, that I wanted to tell you,

6
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I wanted to build an argument for primary education

7
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
in a very specific context.

8
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
In order to do that in 20 minutes, I have to bring out four ideas --

9
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
it's like four pieces of a puzzle.

10
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And if I succeed in doing that,

11
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
maybe you would go back with the thought

12
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that you could build on, and perhaps help me do my work.

13
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
The first piece of the puzzle is remoteness

14
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and the quality of education.

15
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Now, by remoteness, I mean two or three different kinds of things.

16
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Of course, remoteness in its normal sense, which means

17
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that as you go further and further away

18
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
from an urban center, you get to remoter areas.

19
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
What happens to education?

20
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
The second, or a different kind of remoteness

21
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
is that within the large metropolitan areas all over the world,

22
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
you have pockets, like slums, or shantytowns, or poorer areas,

23
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
which are socially and economically remote

24
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
from the rest of the city, so it's us and them.

25
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
What happens to education in that context?

26
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
So keep both of those ideas of remoteness.

27
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
We made a guess. The guess was that schools in remote areas

28
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
do not have good enough teachers.

29
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
If they do have, they cannot retain those teachers.

30
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
They do not have good enough infrastructure.

31
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And if they had some infrastructure,

32
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
they have difficulty maintaining it.

33
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
But I wanted to check if this is true. So what I did last year was

34
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
we hired a car, looked up on Google,

35
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
found a route into northern India from New Delhi

36
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
which, you know, which did not cross any big cities

37
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
or any big metropolitan centers. Drove out about 300 kilometers,

38
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and wherever we found a school, administered a set of standard tests,

39
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph.

40
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
The graph was interesting, although you need to consider it carefully.

41
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I mean, this is a very small sample; you should not generalize from it.

42
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
But it was quite obvious, quite clear,

43
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
that for this particular route that I had taken,

44
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
the remoter the school was, the worse its results seemed to be.

45
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
That seemed a little damning,

46
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and I tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure,

47
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
or with the availability of electricity, and things like that.

48
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
To my surprise, it did not correlate.

49
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It did not correlate with the size of classrooms.

50
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It did not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure.

51
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
It did not correlate with the poverty levels. It did not correlate.

52
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
But what happened was that when I administered a questionnaire

53
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
to each of these schools, with one single question for the teachers -- which was,

54
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
"Would you like to move to an urban, metropolitan area?" --

55
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
69 percent of them said yes. And as you can see from that,

56
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
they say yes just a little bit out of Delhi,

57
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of Delhi --

58
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
because, you know, those are relatively better off areas --

59
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and then from 200 kilometers out of Delhi, the answer is consistently yes.

60
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class

61
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
every day thinking that, I wish I was in some other school,

62
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
probably has a deep impact on what happens to the results.

63
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration

64
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
was a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools,

65
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
as opposed to whether the children have enough to eat,

66
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and whether they are packed tightly into classrooms

67
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and that sort of thing. It appears that way.

68
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
When you take education and technology, then I find in the literature that,

69
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
you know, things like websites, collaborative environments --

70
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
you've been listening to all that in the morning --

71
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
it's always piloted first in the best schools, the best urban schools,

72
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and, according to me, biases the result.

73
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
The literature -- one part of it, the scientific literature --

74
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
consistently blames ET as being over-hyped and under-performing.

75
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
The teachers always say, well, it's fine, but it's too expensive for what it does.

76
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Because it's being piloted in a school where the students are already getting,

77
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
let's say, 80 percent of whatever they could do.

78
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
You put in this new super-duper technology, and now they get 83 percent.

79
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So the principal looks at it and says,

80
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
3 percent for 300,000 dollars? Forget it.

81
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
If you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools,

82
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
where the score was 30 percent, and, let's say, took that up to 40 percent --

83
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that will be a completely different thing.

84
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So the relative change that ET, Educational Technology, would make,

85
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top,

86
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
but we seem to be doing it the other way about.

87
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So I came to this conclusion that ET should reach

88
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
the underprivileged first, not the other way about.

89
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And finally came the question of, how do you tackle teacher perception?

90
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Whenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology,

91
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
the teacher's first reaction is,

92
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
you cannot replace a teacher with a machine -- it's impossible.

93
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I don't know why it's impossible, but, even for a moment,

94
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
if you did assume that it's impossible -- I have a quotation from Sir Arthur C. Clarke,

95
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
the science fiction writer whom I met in Colombo,

96
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and he said something which completely solves this problem.

97
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
He said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine, should be.

98
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So, you know, it puts the teacher into a tough bind, you have to think.

99
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Anyway, so I'm proposing that an alternative primary education,

100
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
whatever alternative you want, is required where schools don't exist,

101
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
where schools are not good enough, where teachers are not available

102
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
or where teachers are not good enough, for whatever reason.

103
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
If you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies,

104
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
then you don't need an alternative education.

105
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So far I haven't come across such an area, except for one case. I won't name the area,

106
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
but somewhere in the world people said, we don't have this problem,

107
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
because we have perfect teachers and perfect schools.

108
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
There are such areas, but -- anyway, I'd never heard that anywhere else.

109
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I'm going to talk about children and self-organization,

110
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea

111
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
of what might an alternative education be like.

112
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
They're called the hole-in-the-wall experiments.

113
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
I'll have to really rush through this. They're a set of experiments.

114
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
The first one was done in New Delhi in 1999.

115
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And what we did over there was pretty much simple.

116
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I had an office in those days which bordered a slum, an urban slum,

117
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
so there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum.

118
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
They cut a hole inside that wall --

119
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
which is how it has got the name hole-in-the-wall --

120
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
and put a pretty powerful PC into that hole, sort of embedded into the wall

121
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end,

122
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
a touchpad similarly embedded into the wall,

123
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
put it on high-speed Internet, put the Internet Explorer there,

124
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
put it on Altavista.com -- in those days -- and just left it there.

125
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And this is what we saw.

126
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
So that was my office in IIT. Here's the hole-in-the-wall.

127
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
About eight hours later, we found this kid.

128
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
To the right is this eight-year-old child who --

129
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and to his left is a six-year-old girl, who is not very tall.

130
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And what he was doing was, he was teaching her to browse.

131
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So it sort of raised more questions than it answered.

132
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Is this real? Does the language matter,

133
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
because he's not supposed to know English?

134
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Will the computer last, or will they break it and steal it

135
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
-- and did anyone teach them?

136
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
The last question is what everybody said, but you know,

137
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I mean, they must have poked their head over the wall

138
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and asked the people in your office,

139
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
can you show me how to do it, and then somebody taught him.

140
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
So I took the experiment out of Delhi and repeated it,

141
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
this time in a city called Shivpuri in the center of India,

142
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
where I was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything.

143
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
(Laughter)

144
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
So it was a warm day, and the hole in the wall

145
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
was on that decrepit old building. This is the first kid who came there;

146
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
he later on turned out to be a 13-year-old school dropout.

147
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
He came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad.

148
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Very quickly, he noticed that when he moves his finger on the touchpad

149
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
something moves on the screen --

150
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and later on he told me, "I have never seen a television

151
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
where you can do something."

152
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
So he figured that out. It took him over two minutes

153
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
to figure out that he was doing things to the television.

154
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And then, as he was doing that, he made an accidental click

155
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
by hitting the touchpad -- you'll see him do that.

156
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
He did that, and the Internet Explorer changed page.

157
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Eight minutes later, he looked from his hand to the screen,

158
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and he was browsing: he was going back and forth.

159
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
When that happened, he started calling all the neighborhood children,

160
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
like, children would come and see what's happening over here.

161
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And by the evening of that day, 70 children were all browsing.

162
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
So eight minutes and an embedded computer

163
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
seemed to be all that we needed there.

164
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
So we thought that this is what was happening:

165
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
that children in groups can self-instruct themselves

166
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
to use a computer and the Internet. But under what circumstances?

167
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
At this time there was a -- the main question was about English.

168
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
People said, you know, you really ought to have this in Indian languages.

169
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
So I said, have what, shall I translate the Internet

170
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
into some Indian language? That's not possible.

171
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
So, it has to be the other way about.

172
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
But let's see, how do the children tackle the English language?

173
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
I took the experiment out to northeastern India,

174
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
to a village called Madantusi,

175
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
where, for some reason, there was no English teacher,

176
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
so the children had not learned English at all.

177
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And I built a similar hole-in-the-wall.

178
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
One big difference in the villages, as opposed to the urban slums:

179
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
there were more girls than boys who came to the kiosk.

180
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
In the urban slums, the girls tend to stay away.

181
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
I left the computer there with lots of CDs -- I didn't have any Internet --

182
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and came back three months later.

183
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
So when I came back there, I found these two kids,

184
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
eight- and 12-year-olds, who were playing a game on the computer.

185
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And as soon as they saw me they said,

186
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
"We need a faster processor and a better mouse."

187
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
(Laughter)

188
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
I was real surprised.

189
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
You know, how on earth did they know all this?

190
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And they said, "Well, we've picked it up from the CDs."

191
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
So I said, "But how did you understand what's going on over there?"

192
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
So they said, "Well, you've left this machine

193
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
which talks only in English, so we had to learn English."

194
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
So then I measured, and they were using 200 English words with each other

195
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
-- mispronounced, but correct usage --

196
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
words like exit, stop, find, save, that kind of thing,

197
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
not only to do with the computer but in their day-to-day conversations.

198
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
So, Madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier;

199
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
in fact they may be able to teach themselves the language

200
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
if they really wanted to.

201
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Finally, I got some funding to try this experiment out

202
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
to see if these results are replicable, if they happen everywhere else.

203
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
India is a good place to do such an experiment in,

204
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
because we have all the ethnic diversities, all the -- you know,

205
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
the genetic diversity, all the racial diversities,

206
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and also all the socio-economic diversities.

207
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
So, I could actually choose samples to cover a cross section

208
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
that would cover practically the whole world.

209
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
So I did this for almost five years, and this experiment

210
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
really took us all the way across the length and breadth of India.

211
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
This is the Himalayas. Up in the north, very cold.

212
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
I also had to check or invent an engineering design

213
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
which would survive outdoors, and I was using regular, normal PCs,

214
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
so I needed different climates, for which India is also great,

215
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
because we have very cold, very hot, and so on.

216
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
This is the desert to the west. Near the Pakistan border.

217
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And you see here a little clip of -- one of these villages --

218
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
the first thing that these children did was to find a website

219
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
to teach themselves the English alphabet.

220
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Then to central India -- very warm, moist, fishing villages,

221
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
where humidity is a very big killer of electronics.

222
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
So we had to solve all the problems we had

223
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
without air conditioning and with very poor power,

224
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
so most of the solutions that came out used little blasts of air

225
0:14:33.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
put at the right places to keep the machines running.

226
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
I want to just cut this short. We did this over and over again.

227
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:45,000
This sequence is also nice. This is a small child, a six-year-old,

228
0:14:45.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
telling his eldest sister what to do.

229
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
And this happens very often with these computers,

230
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
that the younger children are found teaching the older ones.

231
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
What did we find? We found that six- to 13-year-olds can self-instruct

232
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
in a connected environment,

233
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
irrespective of anything that we could measure.

234
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
So if they have access to the computer, they will teach themselves, including intelligence.

235
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
I couldn't find a single correlation with anything, but it had to be in groups.

236
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
And that may be of great, you know, interest to this group,

237
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
because all of you are talking about groups.

238
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
So here was the power of what a group of children can do,

239
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:3,000
if you lift the adult intervention.

240
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Just a quick idea of the measurements.

241
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:38,000
We took standard statistical techniques, so I'm going to not talk about that.

242
0:15:38.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
But we got a clean learning curve,

243
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:44,000
almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school.

244
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
I'll leave it at that,

245
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:49,000
because, I mean, it sort of says it all, doesn't it?

246
0:15:49.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
What could they learn to do?

247
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Basic Windows functions, browsing, painting, chatting and email,

248
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
games and educational material, music downloads, playing video.

249
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:01,000
In short, what all of us do.

250
0:16:01.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
And over 300 children will become computer literate

251
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
and be able to do all of these things in six months with one computer.

252
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
So, how do they do that?

253
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:13,000
If you calculated the actual time of access,

254
0:16:13.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
it would work out to minutes per day,

255
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
so that's not how it's happening.

256
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
What you have, actually, is there is one child operating the computer.

257
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:24,000
And surrounding him are usually three other children,

258
0:16:24.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
who are advising him on what they should do.

259
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
If you test them, all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them.

260
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
Around these four are usually a group of about 16 children,

261
0:16:36.16,000 --> 0:16:39,000
who are also advising, usually wrongly,

262
0:16:39.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
about everything that's going on on the computer.

263
0:16:42.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
And all of them also will clear a test given on that subject.

264
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:51,000
So they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing.

265
0:16:51.16,000 --> 0:16:54,000
It seems counter-intuitive to adult learning,

266
0:16:54.16,000 --> 0:16:56,000
but remember, eight-year-olds live in a society

267
0:16:56.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
where most of the time they are told, don't do this,

268
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:02,000
you know, don't touch the whiskey bottle.

269
0:17:02.16,000 --> 0:17:04,000
So what does the eight-year-old do?

270
0:17:04.16,000 --> 0:17:08,000
He observes very carefully how a whiskey bottle should be touched.

271
0:17:08.16,000 --> 0:17:09,000
And if you tested him,

272
0:17:09.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
he would answer every question correctly on that topic.

273
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
So, they seem to be able to acquire very quickly.

274
0:17:17.16,000 --> 0:17:2,000
So what was the conclusion over the six years of work?

275
0:17:20.16,000 --> 0:17:24,000
It was that primary education can happen on its own,

276
0:17:24.16,000 --> 0:17:26,000
or parts of it can happen on its own.

277
0:17:26.16,000 --> 0:17:3,000
It does not have to be imposed from the top downwards.

278
0:17:30.16,000 --> 0:17:36,000
It could perhaps be a self-organizing system, so that was

279
0:17:36.16,000 --> 0:17:38,000
the second bit that I wanted to tell you,

280
0:17:38.16,000 --> 0:17:42,000
that children can self-organize and attain an educational objective.

281
0:17:42.16,000 --> 0:17:48,000
The third piece was on values, and again, to put it very briefly,

282
0:17:48.16,000 --> 0:17:52,000
I conducted a test over 500 children spread across all over India,

283
0:17:52.16,000 --> 0:17:55,000
and asked them -- I gave them about 68 different

284
0:17:55.16,000 --> 0:17:59,000
values-oriented questions and simply asked them their opinions.

285
0:17:59.16,000 --> 0:18:03,000
We got all sorts of opinions. Yes, no or I don't know.

286
0:18:03.16,000 --> 0:18:09,000
I simply took those questions where I got 50 percent yeses and 50 percent noes --

287
0:18:09.16,000 --> 0:18:13,000
so I was able to get a collection of 16 such statements.

288
0:18:13.16,000 --> 0:18:17,000
These were areas where the children were clearly confused,

289
0:18:17.16,000 --> 0:18:19,000
because half said yes and half said no.

290
0:18:19.16,000 --> 0:18:23,000
A typical example being, "Sometimes it is necessary to tell lies."

291
0:18:23.16,000 --> 0:18:28,000
They don't have a way to determine which way to answer this question;

292
0:18:28.16,000 --> 0:18:31,000
perhaps none of us do.

293
0:18:31.16,000 --> 0:18:33,000
So I leave you with this third question.

294
0:18:33.16,000 --> 0:18:37,000
Can technology alter the acquisition of values?

295
0:18:37.16,000 --> 0:18:39,000
Finally, self-organizing systems,

296
0:18:39.16,000 --> 0:18:41,000
about which, again, I won't say too much

297
0:18:41.16,000 --> 0:18:45,000
because you've been hearing all about it.

298
0:18:45.16,000 --> 0:18:47,000
Natural systems are all self-organizing:

299
0:18:47.16,000 --> 0:18:5,000
galaxies, molecules, cells, organisms, societies --

300
0:18:50.16,000 --> 0:18:52,000
except for the debate about an intelligent designer.

301
0:18:52.16,000 --> 0:18:55,000
But at this point in time, as far as science goes,

302
0:18:55.16,000 --> 0:18:57,000
it's self-organization.

303
0:18:57.16,000 --> 0:19:,000
But other examples are traffic jams, stock market, society

304
0:19:00.16,000 --> 0:19:06,000
and disaster recovery, terrorism and insurgency.

305
0:19:06.16,000 --> 0:19:1,000
And you know about the Internet-based self-organizing systems.

306
0:19:10.16,000 --> 0:19:12,000
So here are my four sentences then.

307
0:19:12.16,000 --> 0:19:16,000
Remoteness affects the quality of education.

308
0:19:16.16,000 --> 0:19:22,000
Educational technology should be introduced into remote areas first,

309
0:19:22.16,000 --> 0:19:25,000
and other areas later.

310
0:19:25.16,000 --> 0:19:31,000
Values are acquired; doctrine and dogma are imposed --

311
0:19:31.16,000 --> 0:19:33,000
the two opposing mechanisms.

312
0:19:33.16,000 --> 0:19:38,000
And learning is most likely a self-organizing system.

313
0:19:38.16,000 --> 0:19:43,000
If you put all the four together, then it gives -- according to me --

314
0:19:43.16,000 --> 0:19:47,000
it gives us a goal, a vision, for educational technology.

315
0:19:47.16,000 --> 0:19:53,000
An educational technology and pedagogy that is digital, automatic,

316
0:19:53.16,000 --> 0:19:59,000
fault-tolerant, minimally invasive, connected and self-organized.

317
0:19:59.16,000 --> 0:20:03,000
As educationists, we have never asked for technology; we keep borrowing it.

318
0:20:03.16,000 --> 0:20:07,000
PowerPoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology,

319
0:20:07.16,000 --> 0:20:11,000
but it was not meant for education, it was meant for making boardroom presentations.

320
0:20:11.16,000 --> 0:20:15,000
We borrowed it. Video conferencing. The personal computer itself.

321
0:20:15.16,000 --> 0:20:18,000
I think it's time that the educationists made their own specs,

322
0:20:18.16,000 --> 0:20:22,000
and I have such a set of specs. This is a brief look at that.

323
0:20:22.16,000 --> 0:20:26,000
And such a set of specs should produce the technology

324
0:20:26.16,000 --> 0:20:29,000
to address remoteness, values and violence.

325
0:20:29.16,000 --> 0:20:35,000
So I thought I'd give it a name -- why don't we call it "outdoctrination."

326
0:20:35.16,000 --> 0:20:4,000
And could this be a goal for educational technology in the future?

327
0:20:40.16,000 --> 0:20:43,000
So I want to leave that as a thought with you.

328
0:20:43.16,000 --> 0:20:44,000
Thank you.

329
0:20:44.16,000 --> 0:20:5,000

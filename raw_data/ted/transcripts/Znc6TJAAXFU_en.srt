1
0:00:12.985,000 --> 0:00:14,000
At Free America, we've done a listening and learning tour.

2
0:00:16.39,000 --> 0:00:19,000
We visited not only with prosecutors

3
0:00:19.858,000 --> 0:00:2,000
but with legislators,

4
0:00:21.628,000 --> 0:00:25,000
with inmates in our state and local prisons.

5
0:00:27.282,000 --> 0:00:29,000
We've gone to immigration detention centers.

6
0:00:30.239,000 --> 0:00:31,000
We've met a lot of people.

7
0:00:33.174,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And we've seen that redemption and transformation can happen

8
0:00:39.422,000 --> 0:00:43,000
in our prisons, our jails and our immigration detention centers,

9
0:00:44.133,000 --> 0:00:47,000
giving hope to those who want to create a better life

10
0:00:47.174,000 --> 0:00:48,000
after serving their time.

11
0:00:50.028,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Imagine if we also considered the front end of this prison pipeline.

12
0:00:53.964,000 --> 0:00:54,000
What would it look like if we intervened,

13
0:00:55.929,000 --> 0:00:57,000
with rehabilitation as a core value --

14
0:00:58.906,000 --> 0:01:01,000
with love and compassion as core values?

15
0:01:02.523,000 --> 0:01:04,000
We would have a society that is safer,

16
0:01:04.846,000 --> 0:01:05,000
healthier

17
0:01:06.021,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and worthy of raising our children in.

18
0:01:08.864,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I want to introduce you to James Cavitt.

19
0:01:12.036,000 --> 0:01:16,000
James served 12 years in the San Quentin State Prison

20
0:01:16.563,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and is being released in 18 months.

21
0:01:19.809,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Now James, like you and me,

22
0:01:21.798,000 --> 0:01:23,000
is more than the worst thing he's done.

23
0:01:25.691,000 --> 0:01:27,000
He is a father, a husband, a son, a poet.

24
0:01:29.265,000 --> 0:01:3,000
He committed a crime;

25
0:01:30.906,000 --> 0:01:31,000
he's paying his debt,

26
0:01:32.547,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and working hard to build the skills

27
0:01:35.035,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to make the transition back to a productive life

28
0:01:38.762,000 --> 0:01:41,000
when he enters the civilian population again.

29
0:01:41.807,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Now James, like millions of people behind bars,

30
0:01:44.485,000 --> 0:01:46,000
is an example of what happens

31
0:01:46.544,000 --> 0:01:5,000
if we believe that our failings don't define who we are,

32
0:01:51.019,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that we are all worthy of redemption

33
0:01:53.345,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and if we support those impacted by mass incarceration,

34
0:01:57.606,000 --> 0:01:58,000
we can all heal together.

35
0:02:00.034,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I'd like to introduce you to James right now,

36
0:02:02.344,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and he's going to share his journey of redemption

37
0:02:04.852,000 --> 0:02:05,000
through spoken word.

38
0:02:08.432,000 --> 0:02:09,000
James Cavitt: Thanks, John.

39
0:02:09.806,000 --> 0:02:1,000
TED, welcome to San Quentin.

40
0:02:12.521,000 --> 0:02:14,000
The talent is abundant behind prison walls.

41
0:02:15.608,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Future software engineers,

42
0:02:17.664,000 --> 0:02:18,000
entrepreneurs,

43
0:02:18.967,000 --> 0:02:19,000
craftsmen,

44
0:02:20.142,000 --> 0:02:21,000
musicians

45
0:02:21.317,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and artists.

46
0:02:22.624,000 --> 0:02:25,000
This piece is inspired by all of the hard work

47
0:02:25.745,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that men and women are doing on the inside

48
0:02:28.997,000 --> 0:02:31,000
to create better lives and futures for themselves

49
0:02:32.346,000 --> 0:02:33,000
after they serve their time.

50
0:02:34.931,000 --> 0:02:37,000
This piece is entitled, "Where I Live."

51
0:02:40.218,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I live in a world where most people are too afraid to go.

52
0:02:44.441,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Surrounded by tall, concrete walls,

53
0:02:46.801,000 --> 0:02:47,000
steel bars,

54
0:02:47.976,000 --> 0:02:48,000
where razor wire have a way

55
0:02:49.294,000 --> 0:02:52,000
of cutting away at the hopes for a brighter tomorrow.

56
0:02:53.697,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I live in a world

57
0:02:54.872,000 --> 0:02:55,000
that kill people who kill people

58
0:02:56.429,000 --> 0:02:57,000
in order to teach people

59
0:02:57.604,000 --> 0:02:58,000
that killing people is wrong.

60
0:03:00.285,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Imagine that.

61
0:03:02.111,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Better yet,

62
0:03:03.286,000 --> 0:03:06,000
imagine a world where healed people helped hurt people heal

63
0:03:06.38,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and become strong.

64
0:03:08.427,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Maybe then we would all be singin' "Redemption Song."

65
0:03:13.08,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I live in a world that has been called "hell on Earth"

66
0:03:16.013,000 --> 0:03:17,000
by those trapped inside.

67
0:03:19.046,000 --> 0:03:2,000
But I've come to the stark realization

68
0:03:20.993,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that prison --

69
0:03:22.78,000 --> 0:03:23,000
it really is what you make it.

70
0:03:25.192,000 --> 0:03:27,000
You see, in spite of the harshness of my reality,

71
0:03:27.931,000 --> 0:03:28,000
there is a silver lining.

72
0:03:30.47,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I knew that my freedom was gonna come,

73
0:03:32.312,000 --> 0:03:33,000
it was just a matter of time.

74
0:03:33.725,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And so I treated my first steps as if they were my last mile,

75
0:03:37.141,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and I realized that you don't have to be free

76
0:03:40.122,000 --> 0:03:41,000
in order to experience freedom.

77
0:03:42.89,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And just because you're free,

78
0:03:44.673,000 --> 0:03:45,000
doesn't mean that you have freedom.

79
0:03:46.996,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Many of us, for years, have been battling our inner demons.

80
0:03:50.266,000 --> 0:03:53,000
We walk around smiling when inside we're really screamin':

81
0:03:53.631,000 --> 0:03:54,000
freedom!

82
0:03:56.171,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Don't you get it?

83
0:03:58.018,000 --> 0:03:59,000
We're all serving time;

84
0:03:59.527,000 --> 0:04:,000
we're just in different places.

85
0:04:01.78,000 --> 0:04:02,000
As for me,

86
0:04:02.955,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I choose to be free from the prisons I've created.

87
0:04:05.559,000 --> 0:04:06,000
The key:

88
0:04:06.734,000 --> 0:04:07,000
forgiveness.

89
0:04:07.909,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Action's my witness.

90
0:04:09.084,000 --> 0:04:1,000
If we want freedom,

91
0:04:11.122,000 --> 0:04:12,000
then we gotta think different.

92
0:04:13.69,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Because freedom ...

93
0:04:17.227,000 --> 0:04:18,000
it isn't a place.

94
0:04:19.783,000 --> 0:04:2,000
It's a mind setting.

95
0:04:22.996,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Thank you.

96
0:04:24.171,000 --> 0:04:27,000
(Applause)

97
0:04:27.536,000 --> 0:04:34,000
(Piano)

98
0:04:45.789,000 --> 0:04:47,000
John Legend: Old pirates, yes, they rob I.

99
0:04:50.233,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Sold I to the merchant ships.

100
0:04:55.414,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Minutes after they took I

101
0:04:59.622,000 --> 0:05:,000
from the bottomless pit.

102
0:05:03.191,000 --> 0:05:06,000
My hands were made strong

103
0:05:07.969,000 --> 0:05:1,000
by the hand of the almighty.

104
0:05:12.213,000 --> 0:05:15,000
We forward in this generation

105
0:05:17.798,000 --> 0:05:19,000
triumphantly.

106
0:05:21.343,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Won't you help to sing

107
0:05:26.686,000 --> 0:05:28,000
these songs of freedom?

108
0:05:29.899,000 --> 0:05:31,000
'Cause all I ever had --

109
0:05:35.238,000 --> 0:05:37,000
redemption songs.

110
0:05:39.722,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Redemption songs.

111
0:05:43.947,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery.

112
0:05:48.277,000 --> 0:05:51,000
None but ourselves can free our minds.

113
0:05:53.253,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Have no fear for atomic energy

114
0:05:57.269,000 --> 0:06:,000
'cause none of them can stop the time.

115
0:06:01.719,000 --> 0:06:03,000
How long shall they kill our prophets

116
0:06:05.433,000 --> 0:06:07,000
while we stand aside and look?

117
0:06:10.329,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Some say it's just a part of it,

118
0:06:14.447,000 --> 0:06:16,000
we've got to fulfill the book.

119
0:06:18.877,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Won't you help to sing

120
0:06:24.048,000 --> 0:06:26,000
these songs of freedom?

121

redemption songs.

123
0:06:36.387,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Redemption songs.

(Piano)

125
0:06:56.291,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery.

126

None but ourselves can free our minds.

127

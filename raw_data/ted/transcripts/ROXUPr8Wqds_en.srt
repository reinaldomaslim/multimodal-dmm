2
0:00:17.057,000 --> 0:00:19,000
So I want to talk a little bit about seeing the world

3
0:00:19.524,000 --> 0:00:21,000
from a totally unique point of view,

4
0:00:22.25,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and this world I'm going to talk about is the micro world.

5
0:00:25.275,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I've found, after doing this for many, many years,

6
0:00:27.855,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that there's a magical world behind reality.

7
0:00:30.571,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And that can be seen directly through a microscope,

8
0:00:33.73,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and I'm going to show you some of this today.

9
0:00:35.835,000 --> 0:00:38,000
So let's start off looking at something rather not-so-small,

10
0:00:39.522,000 --> 0:00:41,000
something that we can see with our naked eye,

11
0:00:41.786,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and that's a bee. So when you look at this bee,

12
0:00:44.227,000 --> 0:00:46,000
it's about this size here, it's about a centimeter.

13
0:00:47.123,000 --> 0:00:49,000
But to really see the details of the bee, and really

14
0:00:49.411,000 --> 0:00:52,000
appreciate what it is, you have to look a little bit closer.

15
0:00:53.14,000 --> 0:00:56,000
So that's just the eye of the bee with a microscope,

16
0:00:56.226,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and now all of a sudden you can see that the bee has

17
0:00:58.573,000 --> 0:01:,000
thousands of individual eyes called ommatidia,

18
0:01:01.404,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and they actually have sensory hairs in their eyes

19
0:01:03.836,000 --> 0:01:05,000
so they know when they're right up close to something,

20
0:01:06.205,000 --> 0:01:09,000
because they can't see in stereo.

21
0:01:09.909,000 --> 0:01:12,000
As we go smaller, here is a human hair.

22
0:01:13.613,000 --> 0:01:15,000
A human hair is about the smallest thing that the eye can see.

23
0:01:16.432,000 --> 0:01:18,000
It's about a tenth of a millimeter.

24
0:01:19.166,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And as we go smaller again,

25
0:01:20.342,000 --> 0:01:23,000
about ten times smaller than that, is a cell.

26
0:01:23.748,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So you could fit 10 human cells

27
0:01:26.331,000 --> 0:01:29,000
across the diameter of a human hair.

28
0:01:29.997,000 --> 0:01:3,000
So when we would look at cells, this is how I really got

29
0:01:31.583,000 --> 0:01:34,000
involved in biology and science is by looking

30
0:01:34.851,000 --> 0:01:36,000
at living cells in the microscope.

31
0:01:37.318,000 --> 0:01:39,000
When I first saw living cells in a microscope, I was

32
0:01:39.389,000 --> 0:01:42,000
absolutely enthralled and amazed at what they looked like.

33
0:01:43.288,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So if you look at the cell like that from the immune system,

34
0:01:46.604,000 --> 0:01:47,000
they're actually moving all over the place.

35
0:01:48.443,000 --> 0:01:51,000
This cell is looking for foreign objects,

36
0:01:52.193,000 --> 0:01:54,000
bacteria, things that it can find.

37
0:01:54.55,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And it's looking around, and when it finds something,

38
0:01:57.198,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and recognizes it being foreign,

39
0:01:59.494,000 --> 0:02:,000
it will actually engulf it and eat it.

40
0:02:00.786,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So if you look right there, it finds that little bacterium,

41
0:02:05.07,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and it engulfs it and eats it.

42
0:02:10.692,000 --> 0:02:13,000
If you take some heart cells from an animal,

43
0:02:13.873,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and put it in a dish, they'll just sit there and beat.

44
0:02:16.769,000 --> 0:02:19,000
That's their job. Every cell has a mission in life,

45
0:02:20.359,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and these cells, the mission is

46
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
to move blood around our body.

47
0:02:25.687,000 --> 0:02:27,000
These next cells are nerve cells, and right now,

48
0:02:28.471,000 --> 0:02:3,000
as we see and understand what we're looking at,

49
0:02:31.407,000 --> 0:02:33,000
our brains and our nerve cells are actually doing this

50
0:02:33.521,000 --> 0:02:35,000
right now. They're not just static. They're moving around

51
0:02:36.063,000 --> 0:02:39,000
making new connections, and that's what happens when we learn.

52
0:02:39.565,000 --> 0:02:41,000
As you go farther down this scale here,

53
0:02:42.355,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that's a micron, or a micrometer, and we go

54
0:02:45.259,000 --> 0:02:47,000
all the way down to here to a nanometer

55
0:02:47.607,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and an angstrom. Now, an angstrom is the size

56
0:02:50.364,000 --> 0:02:53,000
of the diameter of a hydrogen atom.

57
0:02:53.731,000 --> 0:02:54,000
That's how small that is.

58
0:02:55.364,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And microscopes that we have today can actually see

59
0:02:57.681,000 --> 0:03:,000
individual atoms. So these are some pictures

60
0:03:00.739,000 --> 0:03:02,000
of individual atoms. Each bump here is an individual atom.

61
0:03:03.572,000 --> 0:03:05,000
This is a ring of cobalt atoms.

62
0:03:06.401,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So this whole world, the nano world, this area in here

63
0:03:09.059,000 --> 0:03:12,000
is called the nano world, and the nano world,

64
0:03:12.254,000 --> 0:03:15,000
the whole micro world that we see,

65
0:03:15.388,000 --> 0:03:18,000
there's a nano world that is wrapped up within that, and

66
0:03:18.421,000 --> 0:03:22,000
the whole -- and that is the world of molecules and atoms.

67
0:03:22.816,000 --> 0:03:24,000
But I want to talk about this larger world,

68
0:03:25.274,000 --> 0:03:27,000
the world of the micro world.

69
0:03:27.611,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So if you were a little tiny bug living in a flower,

70
0:03:31.73,000 --> 0:03:34,000
what would that flower look like, if the flower was this big?

71
0:03:34.881,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It wouldn't look or feel like anything that we see

72
0:03:37.396,000 --> 0:03:4,000
when we look at a flower. So if you look at this flower here,

73
0:03:40.69,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and you're a little bug, if you're on that surface

74
0:03:42.522,000 --> 0:03:46,000
of that flower, that's what the terrain would look like.

75
0:03:46.588,000 --> 0:03:48,000
The petal of that flower looks like that, so the ant

76
0:03:48.964,000 --> 0:03:5,000
is kind of crawling over these objects, and if you look

77
0:03:51.645,000 --> 0:03:54,000
a little bit closer at this stigma and the stamen here,

78
0:03:54.989,000 --> 0:03:56,000
this is the style of that flower, and you notice

79
0:03:57.734,000 --> 0:04:01,000
that it's got these little -- these are like little jelly-like things

80
0:04:01.959,000 --> 0:04:05,000
that are what are called spurs. These are nectar spurs.

81
0:04:06.701,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So this little ant that's crawling here, it's like

82
0:04:09.318,000 --> 0:04:1,000
it's in a little Willy Wonka land.

83
0:04:11.144,000 --> 0:04:15,000
It's like a little Disneyland for them. It's not like what we see.

84
0:04:15.279,000 --> 0:04:18,000
These are little bits of individual grain of pollen

85
0:04:19.182,000 --> 0:04:22,000
there and there, and here is a --

86
0:04:22.628,000 --> 0:04:24,000
what you see as one little yellow dot of pollen,

87
0:04:25.206,000 --> 0:04:26,000
when you look in a microscope, it's actually made

88
0:04:27.17,000 --> 0:04:3,000
of thousands of little grains of pollen.

89
0:04:30.934,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So this, for example, when you see bees flying around

90
0:04:33.169,000 --> 0:04:35,000
these little plants, and they're collecting pollen,

91
0:04:35.974,000 --> 0:04:37,000
those pollen grains that they're collecting, they pack

92
0:04:38.397,000 --> 0:04:4,000
into their legs and they take it back to the hive,

93
0:04:40.83,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and that's what makes the beehive,

94
0:04:43.46,000 --> 0:04:46,000
the wax in the beehive. And they're also collecting nectar,

95
0:04:47.278,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and that's what makes the honey that we eat.

96
0:04:51.189,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Here's a close-up picture, or this is actually a regular picture

97
0:04:54.446,000 --> 0:04:56,000
of a water hyacinth, and if you had really, really good vision,

98
0:04:57.119,000 --> 0:04:59,000
with your naked eye, you'd see it about that well.

99
0:04:59.68,000 --> 0:05:01,000
There's the stamen and the pistil. But look what the stamen

100
0:05:02.308,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and the pistil look like in a microscope. That's the stamen.

101
0:05:05.822,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So that's thousands of little grains of pollen there,

102
0:05:08.473,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and there's the pistil there, and these are the little things

103
0:05:11.759,000 --> 0:05:14,000
called trichomes. And that's what makes the flower give

104
0:05:15.478,000 --> 0:05:18,000
a fragrance, and plants actually communicate

105
0:05:19.438,000 --> 0:05:24,000
with one another through their fragrances.

106
0:05:24.832,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I want to talk about something really ordinary,

107
0:05:27.2,000 --> 0:05:28,000
just ordinary sand.

108
0:05:29.124,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I became interested in sand about 10 years ago,

109
0:05:31.054,000 --> 0:05:33,000
when I first saw sand from Maui,

110
0:05:33.615,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and in fact, this is a little bit of sand from Maui.

111
0:05:36.762,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So sand is about a tenth of a millimeter in size.

112
0:05:39.793,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Each sand grain is about a tenth of a millimeter in size.

113
0:05:42.704,000 --> 0:05:44,000
But when you look closer at this, look at what's there.

114
0:05:45.287,000 --> 0:05:48,000
It's really quite amazing. You have microshells there.

115
0:05:48.789,000 --> 0:05:5,000
You have things like coral.

116
0:05:50.982,000 --> 0:05:53,000
You have fragments of other shells. You have olivine.

117
0:05:54.516,000 --> 0:05:56,000
You have bits of a volcano. There's a little bit

118
0:05:56.712,000 --> 0:05:58,000
of a volcano there. You have tube worms.

119
0:05:59.339,000 --> 0:06:03,000
An amazing array of incredible things exist in sand.

120
0:06:04.065,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And the reason that is, is because in a place like this island,

121
0:06:06.744,000 --> 0:06:08,000
a lot of the sand is made of biological material

122
0:06:09.11,000 --> 0:06:11,000
because the reefs provide a place where all these

123
0:06:12.107,000 --> 0:06:15,000
microscopic animals or macroscopic animals grow,

124
0:06:15.997,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and when they die, their shells and their teeth

125
0:06:18.335,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and their bones break up and they make grains of sand,

126
0:06:20.677,000 --> 0:06:22,000
things like coral and so forth.

127
0:06:23.647,000 --> 0:06:26,000
So here's, for example, a picture of sand from Maui.

128
0:06:27.44,000 --> 0:06:29,000
This is from Lahaina,

129
0:06:29.977,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and when we're walking along a beach, we're actually

130
0:06:31.707,000 --> 0:06:34,000
walking along millions of years of biological and geological history.

131
0:06:35.161,000 --> 0:06:37,000
We don't realize it, but it's actually a record

132
0:06:37.628,000 --> 0:06:39,000
of that entire ecology.

133
0:06:40.201,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So here we see, for example, a sponge spicule,

134
0:06:43.359,000 --> 0:06:45,000
two bits of coral here,

135
0:06:45.945,000 --> 0:06:48,000
that's a sea urchin spine. Really some amazing stuff.

136
0:06:49.795,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So when I first looked at this, I was -- I thought,

137
0:06:52.172,000 --> 0:06:53,000
gee, this is like a little treasure trove here.

138
0:06:53.921,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I couldn't believe it, and I'd go around dissecting

139
0:06:56.087,000 --> 0:06:59,000
the little bits out and making photographs of them.

140
0:06:59.396,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Here's what most of the sand in our world looks like.

141
0:07:01.907,000 --> 0:07:04,000
These are quartz crystals and feldspar,

142
0:07:05.168,000 --> 0:07:07,000
so most sand in the world on the mainland

143
0:07:07.629,000 --> 0:07:1,000
is made of quartz crystal and feldspar. It's the erosion of granite rock.

144
0:07:11.379,000 --> 0:07:15,000
So mountains are built up, and they erode away by water

145
0:07:15.73,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and rain and ice and so forth,

146
0:07:17.757,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and they become grains of sand.

147
0:07:19.063,000 --> 0:07:21,000
There's some sand that's really much more colorful.

148
0:07:21.513,000 --> 0:07:23,000
These are sand from near the Great Lakes,

149
0:07:23.597,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and you can see that it's filled with minerals

150
0:07:25.608,000 --> 0:07:28,000
like pink garnet and green epidote, all kinds of amazing stuff,

151
0:07:29.1,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and if you look at different sands from different places,

152
0:07:31.484,000 --> 0:07:34,000
every single beach, every single place you look at sand,

153
0:07:34.735,000 --> 0:07:39,000
it's different. Here's from Big Sur, like they're little jewels.

154
0:07:39.767,000 --> 0:07:41,000
There are places in Africa where they do the mining

155
0:07:42.256,000 --> 0:07:46,000
of jewels, and you go to the sand where the rivers have

156
0:07:46.425,000 --> 0:07:48,000
the sand go down to the ocean, and it's like literally looking

157
0:07:48.724,000 --> 0:07:5,000
at tiny jewels through the microscope.

158
0:07:51.587,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So every grain of sand is unique. Every beach is different.

159
0:07:54.764,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Every single grain is different. There are no two grains

160
0:07:57.946,000 --> 0:07:58,000
of sand alike in the world.

161
0:07:59.646,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Every grain of sand is coming somewhere and going somewhere.

162
0:08:03.178,000 --> 0:08:06,000
They're like a snapshot in time.

163
0:08:06.906,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Now sand is not only on Earth, but sand is

164
0:08:10.329,000 --> 0:08:12,000
ubiquitous throughout the universe. In fact, outer space

165
0:08:12.927,000 --> 0:08:15,000
is filled with sand, and that sand comes together

166
0:08:16.591,000 --> 0:08:19,000
to make our planets and the Moon.

167
0:08:19.788,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And you can see those in micrometeorites.

168
0:08:21.37,000 --> 0:08:23,000
This is some micrometeorites that the Army gave me,

169
0:08:23.913,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and they get these out of the drinking wells in the South Pole.

170
0:08:27.007,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And they're quite amazing-looking, and these are the

171
0:08:29.753,000 --> 0:08:33,000
tiny constituents that make up the world that we live in --

172
0:08:34.177,000 --> 0:08:35,000
the planets and the Moon.

173
0:08:36.092,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So NASA wanted me to take some pictures of Moon sand,

174
0:08:39.336,000 --> 0:08:41,000
so they sent me sand from all the different landings

175
0:08:41.599,000 --> 0:08:45,000
of the Apollo missions that happened 40 years ago.

176
0:08:46.077,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And I started taking pictures with my three-dimensional microscopes.

177
0:08:49.717,000 --> 0:08:51,000
This was the first picture I took. It was kind of amazing.

178
0:08:52.684,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I thought it looked kind of a little bit like the Moon, which is sort of interesting.

179
0:08:56.467,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Now, the way my microscopes work is, normally

180
0:08:59.13,000 --> 0:09:01,000
in a microscope you can see very little at one time,

181
0:09:01.596,000 --> 0:09:03,000
so what you have to do is you have to refocus the microscope,

182
0:09:04.543,000 --> 0:09:07,000
keep taking pictures, and then I have a computer program

183
0:09:08.334,000 --> 0:09:1,000
that puts all those pictures together

184
0:09:10.808,000 --> 0:09:13,000
into one picture so you can see actually what it looks like,

185
0:09:13.93,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and I do that in 3D. So there, you can see,

186
0:09:17.165,000 --> 0:09:19,000
is a left-eye view. There's a right-eye view.

187
0:09:19.867,000 --> 0:09:21,000
So sort of left-eye view, right-eye view.

188
0:09:22.42,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Now something's interesting here. This looks very different

189
0:09:24.788,000 --> 0:09:26,000
than any sand on Earth that I've ever seen, and I've

190
0:09:27.166,000 --> 0:09:3,000
seen a lot of sand on Earth, believe me. (Laughter)

191
0:09:30.966,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Look at this hole in the middle. That hole was caused

192
0:09:33.924,000 --> 0:09:35,000
by a micrometeorite hitting the Moon.

193
0:09:36.263,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Now, the Moon has no atmosphere, so micrometeorites

194
0:09:38.62,000 --> 0:09:41,000
come in continuously, and the whole surface of the Moon

195
0:09:41.836,000 --> 0:09:43,000
is covered with powder now, because for four billion years

196
0:09:44.436,000 --> 0:09:46,000
it's been bombarded by micrometeorites,

197
0:09:47.23,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and when micrometeorites come in at about

198
0:09:49.62,000 --> 0:09:53,000
20 to 60,000 miles an hour, they vaporize on contact.

199
0:09:53.63,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And you can see here that that is --

200
0:09:55.54,000 --> 0:09:57,000
that's sort of vaporized, and that material is holding this

201
0:09:58.134,000 --> 0:10:,000
little clump of little sand grains together.

202
0:10:00.68,000 --> 0:10:02,000
This is a very small grain of sand, this whole thing.

203
0:10:02.859,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And that's called a ring agglutinate.

204
0:10:05.019,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And many of the grains of sand on the Moon look like that,

205
0:10:08.963,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and you'd never find that on Earth.

206
0:10:12.42,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Most of the sand on the Moon,

207
0:10:15.673,000 --> 0:10:16,000
especially -- and you know when you look at the Moon,

208
0:10:17.372,000 --> 0:10:19,000
there's the dark areas and the light areas. The dark areas

209
0:10:19.732,000 --> 0:10:23,000
are lava flows. They're basaltic lava flows,

210
0:10:23.873,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and that's what this sand looks like, very similar

211
0:10:26.538,000 --> 0:10:29,000
to the sand that you would see in Haleakala.

212
0:10:30.301,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Other sands, when these micrometeorites come in,

213
0:10:33.724,000 --> 0:10:36,000
they vaporize and they make these fountains,

214
0:10:36.813,000 --> 0:10:38,000
these microscopic fountains that go up into the --

215
0:10:39.436,000 --> 0:10:41,000
I was going to say "up into the air," but there is no air --

216
0:10:41.8,000 --> 0:10:45,000
goes sort of up, and these microscopic glass beads

217
0:10:46.051,000 --> 0:10:48,000
are formed instantly, and they harden, and by the time

218
0:10:48.564,000 --> 0:10:51,000
they fall down back to the surface of the Moon,

219
0:10:51.949,000 --> 0:10:53,000
they have these beautiful colored glass spherules.

220
0:10:54.845,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And these are actually microscopic;

221
0:10:56.39,000 --> 0:10:58,000
you need a microscope to see these.

222
0:10:59.358,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Now here's a grain of sand that is from the Moon,

223
0:11:02.795,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and you can see that the entire

224
0:11:04.949,000 --> 0:11:06,000
crystal structure is still there.

225
0:11:07.432,000 --> 0:11:09,000
This grain of sand is probably about

226
0:11:09.58,000 --> 0:11:11,000
three and a half or four billion years old,

227
0:11:11.862,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and it's never eroded away like the way we have sand

228
0:11:14.053,000 --> 0:11:18,000
on Earth erodes away because of water and tumbling,

229
0:11:18.072,000 --> 0:11:21,000
air, and so forth. All you can see is a little bit of erosion

230
0:11:21.322,000 --> 0:11:25,000
down here by the Sun, has these solar storms,

231
0:11:25.929,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and that's erosion by solar radiation.

232
0:11:30.692,000 --> 0:11:32,000
So what I've been trying to tell you today is

233
0:11:33.278,000 --> 0:11:36,000
things even as ordinary as a grain of sand

234
0:11:36.847,000 --> 0:11:38,000
can be truly extraordinary if you look closely

235
0:11:39.822,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and if you look from a different and a new point of view.

236
0:11:43.127,000 --> 0:11:47,000
I think that this was best put by William Blake when he said,

237
0:11:47.502,000 --> 0:11:49,000
"To see a world in a grain of sand

238
0:11:50.044,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and a heaven in a wild flower,

239
0:11:52.798,000 --> 0:11:54,000
hold infinity in the palm of your hand,

240
0:11:55.131,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and eternity in an hour."

241
0:11:57.464,000 --> 0:12:,000
Thank you. (Applause)

2
0:00:16.08,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So, I'm an artist.

3
0:00:17.728,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I live in New York, and I've been working in advertising

4
0:00:20.182,000 --> 0:00:22,000
for -- ever since I left school,

5
0:00:22.827,000 --> 0:00:23,000
so about seven, eight years now,

6
0:00:24.448,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and it was draining.

7
0:00:26.004,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I worked a lot of late nights. I worked a lot of weekends,

8
0:00:28.717,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and I found myself never having time for all the projects

9
0:00:31.887,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that I wanted to work on on my own.

10
0:00:34.189,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And one day I was at work and I saw a talk

11
0:00:36.151,000 --> 0:00:38,000
by Stefan Sagmeister on TED,

12
0:00:38.382,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and it was called "The power of time off,"

13
0:00:40.037,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and he spoke about how every seven years,

14
0:00:42.673,000 --> 0:00:44,000
he takes a year off from work so he could

15
0:00:44.78,000 --> 0:00:47,000
do his own creative projects, and I was instantly inspired,

16
0:00:48.445,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and I just said, "I have to do that. I have to take a year off.

17
0:00:51.834,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I need to take time to travel and spend time with my family

18
0:00:56.313,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and start my own creative ideas."

19
0:00:58.599,000 --> 0:01:01,000
So the first of those projects ended up being

20
0:01:02.238,000 --> 0:01:05,000
something I called "One Second Every Day."

21
0:01:05.804,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Basically I'm recording one second of every day of my life

22
0:01:08.138,000 --> 0:01:1,000
for the rest of my life,

23
0:01:10.873,000 --> 0:01:12,000
chronologically compiling these one-second

24
0:01:13.81,000 --> 0:01:17,000
tiny slices of my life into one single continuous video

25
0:01:18.112,000 --> 0:01:23,000
until, you know, I can't record them anymore.

26
0:01:23.789,000 --> 0:01:25,000
The purpose of this project is, one:

27
0:01:26.146,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I hate not remembering things that I've done in the past.

28
0:01:30.87,000 --> 0:01:32,000
There's all these things that I've done with my life

29
0:01:33.58,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that I have no recollection of

30
0:01:35.494,000 --> 0:01:36,000
unless someone brings it up, and sometimes I think,

31
0:01:37.21,000 --> 0:01:4,000
"Oh yeah, that's something that I did."

32
0:01:40.781,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And something that I realized early on in the project

33
0:01:42.422,000 --> 0:01:44,000
was that if I wasn't doing anything interesting,

34
0:01:45.146,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I would probably forget to record the video.

35
0:01:47.625,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So the day -- the first time that I forgot, it really hurt me,

36
0:01:51.098,000 --> 0:01:53,000
because it's something that I really wanted to --

37
0:01:53.573,000 --> 0:01:55,000
from the moment that I turned 30, I wanted

38
0:01:55.769,000 --> 0:01:58,000
to keep this project going until forever,

39
0:01:59.119,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and having missed that one second, I realized,

40
0:02:01.565,000 --> 0:02:04,000
it just kind of created this thing in my head

41
0:02:05.318,000 --> 0:02:07,000
where I never forgot ever again.

42
0:02:10.858,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So if I live to see 80 years of age,

43
0:02:13.857,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I'm going to have a five-hour video

44
0:02:16.49,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that encapsulates 50 years of my life.

45
0:02:19.239,000 --> 0:02:21,000
When I turn 40, I'll have a one-hour video

46
0:02:21.631,000 --> 0:02:26,000
that includes just my 30s.

47
0:02:26.868,000 --> 0:02:27,000
This has really

48
0:02:28.396,000 --> 0:02:31,000
invigorated me day-to-day, when I wake up,

49
0:02:31.671,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to try and do something interesting with my day.

50
0:02:42.017,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Now, one of the things that I have issues with is that,

51
0:02:45.525,000 --> 0:02:49,000
as the days and weeks and months go by,

52
0:02:49.723,000 --> 0:02:5,000
time just seems to start blurring

53
0:02:51.54,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and blending into each other

54
0:02:53.462,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and, you know, I hated that,

55
0:02:57.193,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and visualization is the way to trigger memory.

56
0:03:10.252,000 --> 0:03:12,000
You know, this project for me is a way for me

57
0:03:13.141,000 --> 0:03:16,000
to bridge that gap and remember everything that I've done.

58
0:03:16.435,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Even just this one second allows me to remember

59
0:03:19.002,000 --> 0:03:21,000
everything else I did that one day.

60
0:03:21.279,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It's difficult, sometimes, to pick that one second.

61
0:03:23.941,000 --> 0:03:26,000
On a good day, I'll have maybe three or four seconds

62
0:03:27.125,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that I really want to choose,

63
0:03:28.838,000 --> 0:03:3,000
but I'll just have to narrow it down to one,

64
0:03:30.987,000 --> 0:03:31,000
but even narrowing it down to that one allows me

65
0:03:32.951,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to remember the other three anyway.

66
0:03:35.431,000 --> 0:03:38,000
It's also kind of a protest, a personal protest,

67
0:03:38.972,000 --> 0:03:4,000
against the culture we have now where people

68
0:03:41.367,000 --> 0:03:43,000
just are at concerts with their cell phones out

69
0:03:43.809,000 --> 0:03:45,000
recording the whole concert, and they're disturbing you.

70
0:03:45.958,000 --> 0:03:46,000
They're not even enjoying the show.

71
0:03:47.193,000 --> 0:03:5,000
They're watching the concert through their cell phone.

72
0:03:50.298,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I hate that. I admittedly used to be that guy a little bit,

73
0:03:54.266,000 --> 0:03:56,000
back in the day, and I've decided that the best way

74
0:03:57.084,000 --> 0:04:02,000
for me to still capture and keep a visual memory of my life

75
0:04:02.665,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and not be that person, is to just record that one second

76
0:04:05.751,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that will allow me to trigger that memory of,

77
0:04:08.02,000 --> 0:04:11,000
"Yeah, that concert was amazing. I really loved that concert."

78
0:04:11.395,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And it just takes a quick, quick second.

79
0:04:16.813,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I was on a three-month road trip this summer.

80
0:04:19.692,000 --> 0:04:21,000
It was something that I've been dreaming about doing my whole life,

81
0:04:22.546,000 --> 0:04:24,000
just driving around the U.S. and Canada

82
0:04:25.039,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and just figuring out where to go the next day,

83
0:04:28.278,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and it was kind of outstanding.

84
0:04:30.883,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I actually ran out, I spent too much money on my road trip

85
0:04:34.595,000 --> 0:04:36,000
for the savings that I had to take my year off,

86
0:04:37.585,000 --> 0:04:39,000
so I had to, I went to Seattle and I spent some time

87
0:04:40.479,000 --> 0:04:43,000
with friends working on a really neat project.

88
0:04:51.371,000 --> 0:04:54,000
One of the reasons that I took my year off was to spend more time with my family,

89
0:04:55.131,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and this really tragic thing happened where

90
0:04:58.541,000 --> 0:04:59,000
my sister-in-law,

91
0:05:00.146,000 --> 0:05:03,000
her intestine suddenly strangled one day,

92
0:05:03.582,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and we took her to the emergency room,

93
0:05:06.36,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and she was, she was in really bad shape.

94
0:05:09.652,000 --> 0:05:11,000
We almost lost her a couple of times,

95
0:05:11.727,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and I was there with my brother every day.

96
0:05:19.168,000 --> 0:05:21,000
It helped me realize something else during this project,

97
0:05:21.944,000 --> 0:05:27,000
is that recording that one second on a really bad day

98
0:05:28.459,000 --> 0:05:29,000
is extremely difficult.

99
0:05:29.692,000 --> 0:05:34,000
It's not -- we tend to take our cameras out when we're doing awesome things.

100
0:05:34.889,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Or we're, "Oh, yeah, this party, let me take a picture."

101
0:05:37.313,000 --> 0:05:4,000
But we rarely do that when we're having a bad day,

102
0:05:40.315,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and something horrible is happening.

103
0:05:42.196,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And I found that it's actually been very, very important

104
0:05:45.616,000 --> 0:05:48,000
to record even just that one second of a really bad moment.

105
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
It really helps you appreciate the good times.

106
0:05:52.861,000 --> 0:05:56,000
It's not always a good day, so when you have a bad one,

107
0:05:57.148,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I think it's important to remember it,

108
0:05:59.046,000 --> 0:06:04,000
just as much as it is important to remember the [good] days.

109
0:06:12.74,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Now one of the things that I do is I don't use any filters,

110
0:06:15.606,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I don't use anything to -- I try to capture the moment

111
0:06:19.385,000 --> 0:06:24,000
as much as possible as the way that I saw it with my own eyes.

112
0:06:25.012,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I started a rule of first person perspective.

113
0:06:27.747,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Early on, I think I had a couple of videos where

114
0:06:29.82,000 --> 0:06:33,000
you would see me in it, but I realized that wasn't the way to go.

115
0:06:34.033,000 --> 0:06:35,000
The way to really remember what I saw

116
0:06:35.88,000 --> 0:06:39,000
was to record it as I actually saw it.

117
0:06:47.797,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Now a couple of things that I have in my head about this project are,

118
0:06:52.059,000 --> 0:06:57,000
wouldn't it be interesting if thousands of people were doing this?

119
0:06:58.034,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I turned 31 last week, which is there.

120
0:07:04.289,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I think it would be interesting to see

121
0:07:06.017,000 --> 0:07:07,000
what everyone did with a project like this.

122
0:07:07.865,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I think everyone would have a different interpretation of it.

123
0:07:09.857,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I think everyone would benefit from just having that one second to remember every day.

124
0:07:14.595,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Personally, I'm tired of forgetting,

125
0:07:17.446,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and this is a really easy thing to do.

126
0:07:20.017,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I mean, we all have HD-capable cameras in our pockets right now --

127
0:07:22.886,000 --> 0:07:23,000
most people in this room, I bet --

128
0:07:24.716,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and it's something that's --

129
0:07:26.306,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I never want to forget another day that I've ever lived,

130
0:07:28.564,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and this is my way of doing that,

131
0:07:30.845,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and it'd be really interesting also to see,

132
0:07:33.63,000 --> 0:07:34,000
if you could just type in on a website,

133
0:07:35.6,000 --> 0:07:38,000
"June 18, 2018,"

134
0:07:38.806,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and you would just see a stream of people's lives

135
0:07:41.157,000 --> 0:07:42,000
on that particular day from all over the world.

136
0:07:42.851,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And I don't know, I think this project has a lot of possibilities,

137
0:07:46.073,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and I encourage you all to record just a small snippet of your life every day,

138
0:07:49.72,000 --> 0:07:5,000
so you can never forget that that day, you lived.

139
0:07:51.567,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Thank you.

140
0:07:53.271,000 --> 0:07:57,000

1
0:00:12.785,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Nine years ago,

2
0:00:14.513,000 --> 0:00:17,000
my sister discovered lumps in her neck and arm

3
0:00:17.638,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and was diagnosed with cancer.

4
0:00:20.985,000 --> 0:00:23,000
From that day, she started to benefit

5
0:00:24.208,000 --> 0:00:27,000
from the understanding that science has of cancer.

6
0:00:28.206,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Every time she went to the doctor,

7
0:00:30.329,000 --> 0:00:32,000
they measured specific molecules

8
0:00:32.547,000 --> 0:00:34,000
that gave them information about how she was doing

9
0:00:35.452,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and what to do next.

10
0:00:38.095,000 --> 0:00:41,000
New medical options became available every few years.

11
0:00:43.07,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Everyone recognized that she was struggling heroically

12
0:00:47.412,000 --> 0:00:48,000
with a biological illness.

13
0:00:50.847,000 --> 0:00:53,000
This spring, she received an innovative new medical treatment

14
0:00:54.528,000 --> 0:00:55,000
in a clinical trial.

15
0:00:55.754,000 --> 0:00:57,000
It dramatically knocked back her cancer.

16
0:00:59.446,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Guess who I'm going to spend this Thanksgiving with?

17
0:01:02.022,000 --> 0:01:04,000
My vivacious sister,

18
0:01:04.313,000 --> 0:01:06,000
who gets more exercise than I do,

19
0:01:06.966,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and who, like perhaps many people in this room,

20
0:01:09.849,000 --> 0:01:11,000
increasingly talks about a lethal illness

21
0:01:12.165,000 --> 0:01:13,000
in the past tense.

22
0:01:14.614,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Science can, in our lifetimes -- even in a decade --

23
0:01:18.501,000 --> 0:01:21,000
transform what it means to have a specific illness.

24
0:01:24.055,000 --> 0:01:25,000
But not for all illnesses.

25
0:01:27.375,000 --> 0:01:3,000
My friend Robert and I were classmates in graduate school.

26
0:01:31.121,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Robert was smart,

27
0:01:32.946,000 --> 0:01:33,000
but with each passing month,

28
0:01:34.447,000 --> 0:01:37,000
his thinking seemed to become more disorganized.

29
0:01:38.241,000 --> 0:01:41,000
He dropped out of school, got a job in a store ...

30
0:01:41.463,000 --> 0:01:43,000
But that, too, became too complicated.

31
0:01:44.559,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Robert became fearful and withdrawn.

32
0:01:48.281,000 --> 0:01:5,000
A year and a half later, he started hearing voices

33
0:01:50.686,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and believing that people were following him.

34
0:01:52.907,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Doctors diagnosed him with schizophrenia,

35
0:01:55.653,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and they gave him the best drug they could.

36
0:01:57.797,000 --> 0:02:,000
That drug makes the voices somewhat quieter,

37
0:02:00.829,000 --> 0:02:03,000
but it didn't restore his bright mind or his social connectedness.

38
0:02:06.27,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Robert struggled to remain connected

39
0:02:08.15,000 --> 0:02:1,000
to the worlds of school and work and friends.

40
0:02:11.031,000 --> 0:02:12,000
He drifted away,

41
0:02:12.438,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and today I don't know where to find him.

42
0:02:15.593,000 --> 0:02:16,000
If he watches this,

43
0:02:17.962,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I hope he'll find me.

44
0:02:22.639,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Why does medicine have so much to offer my sister,

45
0:02:27.54,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and so much less to offer millions of people like Robert?

46
0:02:32.952,000 --> 0:02:33,000
The need is there.

47
0:02:34.266,000 --> 0:02:37,000
The World Health Organization estimates that brain illnesses

48
0:02:37.443,000 --> 0:02:41,000
like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression

49
0:02:41.582,000 --> 0:02:45,000
are the world's largest cause of lost years of life and work.

50
0:02:47.807,000 --> 0:02:5,000
That's in part because these illnesses often strike early in life,

51
0:02:51.392,000 --> 0:02:53,000
in many ways, in the prime of life,

52
0:02:53.597,000 --> 0:02:57,000
just as people are finishing their educations, starting careers,

53
0:02:58.085,000 --> 0:03:,000
forming relationships and families.

54
0:03:00.388,000 --> 0:03:02,000
These illnesses can result in suicide;

55
0:03:03.907,000 --> 0:03:07,000
they often compromise one's ability to work at one's full potential;

56
0:03:09.767,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and they're the cause of so many tragedies harder to measure:

57
0:03:13.246,000 --> 0:03:15,000
lost relationships and connections,

58
0:03:15.708,000 --> 0:03:18,000
missed opportunities to pursue dreams and ideas.

59
0:03:19.533,000 --> 0:03:22,000
These illnesses limit human possibilities

60
0:03:22.562,000 --> 0:03:24,000
in ways we simply cannot measure.

61
0:03:27.493,000 --> 0:03:31,000
We live in an era in which there's profound medical progress

62
0:03:31.533,000 --> 0:03:32,000
on so many other fronts.

63
0:03:33.368,000 --> 0:03:35,000
My sister's cancer story is a great example,

64
0:03:35.939,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and we could say the same of heart disease.

65
0:03:38.025,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Drugs like statins will prevent millions of heart attacks and strokes.

66
0:03:43.047,000 --> 0:03:45,000
When you look at these areas of profound medical progress

67
0:03:46.016,000 --> 0:03:47,000
in our lifetimes,

68
0:03:47.504,000 --> 0:03:48,000
they have a narrative in common:

69
0:03:50.067,000 --> 0:03:54,000
scientists discovered molecules that matter to an illness,

70
0:03:54.639,000 --> 0:03:58,000
they developed ways to detect and measure those molecules in the body,

71
0:04:00.492,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and they developed ways to interfere with those molecules

72
0:04:03.294,000 --> 0:04:05,000
using other molecules -- medicines.

73
0:04:05.921,000 --> 0:04:09,000
It's a strategy that has worked again and again and again.

74
0:04:11.403,000 --> 0:04:14,000
But when it comes to the brain, that strategy has been limited,

75
0:04:15.069,000 --> 0:04:19,000
because today, we don't know nearly enough, yet,

76
0:04:19.695,000 --> 0:04:2,000
about how the brain works.

77
0:04:22.526,000 --> 0:04:26,000
We need to learn which of our cells matter to each illness,

78
0:04:26.816,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and which molecules in those cells matter to each illness.

79
0:04:31.058,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And that's the mission I want to tell you about today.

80
0:04:34.781,000 --> 0:04:37,000
My lab develops technologies with which we try to turn the brain

81
0:04:38.614,000 --> 0:04:39,000
into a big-data problem.

82
0:04:40.338,000 --> 0:04:43,000
You see, before I became a biologist, I worked in computers and math,

83
0:04:43.898,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and I learned this lesson:

84
0:04:46.365,000 --> 0:04:5,000
wherever you can collect vast amounts of the right kinds of data

85
0:04:50.573,000 --> 0:04:52,000
about the functioning of a system,

86
0:04:53.365,000 --> 0:04:56,000
you can use computers in powerful new ways

87
0:04:57.007,000 --> 0:05:,000
to make sense of that system and learn how it works.

88
0:05:00.256,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Today, big-data approaches are transforming

89
0:05:02.802,000 --> 0:05:04,000
ever-larger sectors of our economy,

90
0:05:05.309,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and they could do the same in biology and medicine, too.

91
0:05:08.619,000 --> 0:05:1,000
But you have to have the right kinds of data.

92
0:05:11.2,000 --> 0:05:13,000
You have to have data about the right things.

93
0:05:13.917,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And that often requires new technologies and ideas.

94
0:05:18.815,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And that is the mission that animates the scientists in my lab.

95
0:05:23.251,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Today, I want to tell you two short stories from our work.

96
0:05:27.427,000 --> 0:05:3,000
One fundamental obstacle we face

97
0:05:30.555,000 --> 0:05:32,000
in trying to turn the brain into a big-data problem

98
0:05:33.946,000 --> 0:05:37,000
is that our brains are composed of and built from billions of cells.

99
0:05:39.246,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And our cells are not generalists; they're specialists.

100
0:05:43.129,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Like humans at work,

101
0:05:45.242,000 --> 0:05:5,000
they specialize into thousands of different cellular careers,

102
0:05:50.54,000 --> 0:05:51,000
or cell types.

103
0:05:52.796,000 --> 0:05:54,000
In fact, each of the cell types in our body

104
0:05:55.391,000 --> 0:05:56,000
could probably give a lively TED Talk

105
0:05:57.293,000 --> 0:05:58,000
about what it does at work.

106
0:06:00.422,000 --> 0:06:02,000
But as scientists, we don't even know today

107
0:06:02.816,000 --> 0:06:03,000
how many cell types there are,

108
0:06:04.747,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and we don't know what the titles of most of those talks would be.

109
0:06:11.809,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Now, we know many important things about cell types.

110
0:06:14.803,000 --> 0:06:16,000
They can differ dramatically in size and shape.

111
0:06:17.578,000 --> 0:06:21,000
One will respond to a molecule that the other doesn't respond to,

112
0:06:21.737,000 --> 0:06:22,000
they'll make different molecules.

113
0:06:23.555,000 --> 0:06:25,000
But science has largely been reaching these insights

114
0:06:26.1,000 --> 0:06:28,000
in an ad hoc way, one cell type at a time,

115
0:06:29.067,000 --> 0:06:3,000
one molecule at a time.

116
0:06:31.854,000 --> 0:06:35,000
We wanted to make it possible to learn all of this quickly and systematically.

117
0:06:37.673,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Now, until recently, it was the case

118
0:06:39.445,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that if you wanted to inventory all of the molecules

119
0:06:42.545,000 --> 0:06:44,000
in a part of the brain or any organ,

120
0:06:45.494,000 --> 0:06:48,000
you had to first grind it up into a kind of cellular smoothie.

121
0:06:50.678,000 --> 0:06:51,000
But that's a problem.

122
0:06:52.737,000 --> 0:06:54,000
As soon as you've ground up the cells,

123
0:06:55.299,000 --> 0:06:58,000
you can only study the contents of the average cell --

124
0:06:58.834,000 --> 0:06:59,000
not the individual cells.

125
0:07:01.182,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Imagine if you were trying to understand how a big city like New York works,

126
0:07:04.915,000 --> 0:07:06,000
but you could only do so by reviewing some statistics

127
0:07:07.481,000 --> 0:07:09,000
about the average resident of New York.

128
0:07:10.637,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Of course, you wouldn't learn very much,

129
0:07:12.64,000 --> 0:07:15,000
because everything that's interesting and important and exciting

130
0:07:15.664,000 --> 0:07:17,000
is in all the diversity and the specializations.

131
0:07:18.42,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And the same thing is true of our cells.

132
0:07:21.05,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And we wanted to make it possible to study the brain not as a cellular smoothie

133
0:07:25.824,000 --> 0:07:27,000
but as a cellular fruit salad,

134
0:07:28.326,000 --> 0:07:3,000
in which one could generate data about and learn from

135
0:07:30.954,000 --> 0:07:31,000
each individual piece of fruit.

136
0:07:34.253,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So we developed a technology for doing that.

137
0:07:36.995,000 --> 0:07:37,000
You're about to see a movie of it.

138
0:07:41.477,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Here we're packaging tens of thousands of individual cells,

139
0:07:45.529,000 --> 0:07:47,000
each into its own tiny water droplet

140
0:07:48.476,000 --> 0:07:5,000
for its own molecular analysis.

141
0:07:51.921,000 --> 0:07:55,000
When a cell lands in a droplet, it's greeted by a tiny bead,

142
0:07:56.068,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and that bead delivers millions of DNA bar code molecules.

143
0:08:01.115,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And each bead delivers a different bar code sequence

144
0:08:04.447,000 --> 0:08:05,000
to a different cell.

145
0:08:06.884,000 --> 0:08:08,000
We incorporate the DNA bar codes

146
0:08:09.489,000 --> 0:08:12,000
into each cell's RNA molecules.

147
0:08:12.571,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Those are the molecular transcripts it's making

148
0:08:15.431,000 --> 0:08:18,000
of the specific genes that it's using to do its job.

149
0:08:19.383,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And then we sequence billions of these combined molecules

150
0:08:24.532,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and use the sequences to tell us

151
0:08:27.054,000 --> 0:08:29,000
which cell and which gene

152
0:08:29.68,000 --> 0:08:3,000
every molecule came from.

153
0:08:32.561,000 --> 0:08:35,000
We call this approach "Drop-seq," because we use droplets

154
0:08:35.877,000 --> 0:08:37,000
to separate the cells for analysis,

155
0:08:38.476,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and we use DNA sequences to tag and inventory

156
0:08:41.945,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and keep track of everything.

157
0:08:44.727,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And now, whenever we do an experiment,

158
0:08:46.727,000 --> 0:08:49,000
we analyze tens of thousands of individual cells.

159
0:08:51.018,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And today in this area of science,

160
0:08:53.666,000 --> 0:08:57,000
the challenge is increasingly how to learn as much as we can

161
0:08:58.621,000 --> 0:08:59,000
as quickly as we can

162
0:09:00.517,000 --> 0:09:01,000
from these vast data sets.

163
0:09:04.914,000 --> 0:09:06,000
When we were developing Drop-seq, people used to tell us,

164
0:09:07.708,000 --> 0:09:11,000
"Oh, this is going to make you guys the go-to for every major brain project."

165
0:09:13.257,000 --> 0:09:14,000
That's not how we saw it.

166
0:09:14.825,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Science is best when everyone is generating lots of exciting data.

167
0:09:20.197,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So we wrote a 25-page instruction book,

168
0:09:23.435,000 --> 0:09:27,000
with which any scientist could build their own Drop-seq system from scratch.

169
0:09:28.037,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And that instruction book has been downloaded from our lab website

170
0:09:31.758,000 --> 0:09:33,000
50,000 times in the past two years.

171
0:09:35.598,000 --> 0:09:38,000
We wrote software that any scientist could use

172
0:09:38.674,000 --> 0:09:4,000
to analyze the data from Drop-seq experiments,

173
0:09:41.596,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and that software is also free,

174
0:09:43.335,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and it's been downloaded from our website 30,000 times in the past two years.

175
0:09:48.328,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And hundreds of labs have written us about discoveries that they've made

176
0:09:53.331,000 --> 0:09:54,000
using this approach.

177
0:09:54.798,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Today, this technology is being used to make a human cell atlas.

178
0:09:58.382,000 --> 0:10:01,000
It will be an atlas of all of the cell types in the human body

179
0:10:01.76,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and the specific genes that each cell type uses to do its job.

180
0:10:08.133,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Now I want to tell you about a second challenge that we face

181
0:10:11.033,000 --> 0:10:13,000
in trying to turn the brain into a big data problem.

182
0:10:13.505,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And that challenge is that we'd like to learn from the brains

183
0:10:16.808,000 --> 0:10:18,000
of hundreds of thousands of living people.

184
0:10:19.998,000 --> 0:10:22,000
But our brains are not physically accessible while we're living.

185
0:10:24.895,000 --> 0:10:27,000
But how can we discover molecular factors if we can't hold the molecules?

186
0:10:30.352,000 --> 0:10:34,000
An answer comes from the fact that the most informative molecules, proteins,

187
0:10:34.924,000 --> 0:10:35,000
are encoded in our DNA,

188
0:10:36.73,000 --> 0:10:4,000
which has the recipes our cells follow to make all of our proteins.

189
0:10:41.999,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And these recipes vary from person to person to person

190
0:10:46.969,000 --> 0:10:49,000
in ways that cause the proteins to vary from person to person

191
0:10:50.335,000 --> 0:10:51,000
in their precise sequence

192
0:10:52.146,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and in how much each cell type makes of each protein.

193
0:10:56.441,000 --> 0:10:59,000
It's all encoded in our DNA, and it's all genetics,

194
0:10:59.858,000 --> 0:11:01,000
but it's not the genetics that we learned about in school.

195
0:11:03.572,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Do you remember big B, little b?

196
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
If you inherit big B, you get brown eyes?

197
0:11:09.085,000 --> 0:11:1,000
It's simple.

198
0:11:11.451,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Very few traits are that simple.

199
0:11:15.232,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Even eye color is shaped by much more than a single pigment molecule.

200
0:11:20.861,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And something as complex as the function of our brains

201
0:11:25.135,000 --> 0:11:28,000
is shaped by the interaction of thousands of genes.

202
0:11:28.406,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And each of these genes varies meaningfully

203
0:11:30.77,000 --> 0:11:31,000
from person to person to person,

204
0:11:32.632,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and each of us is a unique combination of that variation.

205
0:11:37.419,000 --> 0:11:39,000
It's a big data opportunity.

206
0:11:40.214,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And today, it's increasingly possible to make progress

207
0:11:43.414,000 --> 0:11:45,000
on a scale that was never possible before.

208
0:11:46.234,000 --> 0:11:48,000
People are contributing to genetic studies

209
0:11:48.663,000 --> 0:11:49,000
in record numbers,

210
0:11:51.085,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and scientists around the world are sharing the data with one another

211
0:11:55.196,000 --> 0:11:56,000
to speed progress.

212
0:11:57.514,000 --> 0:12:,000
I want to tell you a short story about a discovery we recently made

213
0:12:00.777,000 --> 0:12:01,000
about the genetics of schizophrenia.

214
0:12:03.506,000 --> 0:12:07,000
It was made possible by 50,000 people from 30 countries,

215
0:12:08.126,000 --> 0:12:12,000
who contributed their DNA to genetic research on schizophrenia.

216
0:12:14.406,000 --> 0:12:16,000
It had been known for several years

217
0:12:16.526,000 --> 0:12:2,000
that the human genome's largest influence on risk of schizophrenia

218
0:12:20.661,000 --> 0:12:21,000
comes from a part of the genome

219
0:12:22.487,000 --> 0:12:25,000
that encodes many of the molecules in our immune system.

220
0:12:25.855,000 --> 0:12:28,000
But it wasn't clear which gene was responsible.

221
0:12:29.746,000 --> 0:12:33,000
A scientist in my lab developed a new way to analyze DNA with computers,

222
0:12:33.81,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and he discovered something very surprising.

223
0:12:36.929,000 --> 0:12:39,000
He found that a gene called "complement component 4" --

224
0:12:40.204,000 --> 0:12:41,000
it's called "C4" for short --

225
0:12:43.036,000 --> 0:12:46,000
comes in dozens of different forms in different people's genomes,

226
0:12:46.949,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and these different forms make different amounts

227
0:12:50.17,000 --> 0:12:52,000
of C4 protein in our brains.

228
0:12:52.957,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And he found that the more C4 protein our genes make,

229
0:12:56.966,000 --> 0:12:58,000
the greater our risk for schizophrenia.

230
0:12:59.919,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Now, C4 is still just one risk factor in a complex system.

231
0:13:04.85,000 --> 0:13:05,000
This isn't big B,

232
0:13:06.863,000 --> 0:13:09,000
but it's an insight about a molecule that matters.

233
0:13:11.492,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Complement proteins like C4 were known for a long time

234
0:13:15.153,000 --> 0:13:16,000
for their roles in the immune system,

235
0:13:17.13,000 --> 0:13:19,000
where they act as a kind of molecular Post-it note

236
0:13:19.932,000 --> 0:13:2,000
that says, "Eat me."

237
0:13:22.475,000 --> 0:13:24,000
And that Post-it note gets put on lots of debris

238
0:13:25.166,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and dead cells in our bodies

239
0:13:27.547,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and invites immune cells to eliminate them.

240
0:13:30.779,000 --> 0:13:33,000
But two colleagues of mine found that the C4 Post-it note

241
0:13:35.183,000 --> 0:13:38,000
also gets put on synapses in the brain

242
0:13:38.505,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and prompts their elimination.

243
0:13:41.154,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Now, the creation and elimination of synapses is a normal part

244
0:13:44.444,000 --> 0:13:45,000
of human development and learning.

245
0:13:46.322,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Our brains create and eliminate synapses all the time.

246
0:13:49.921,000 --> 0:13:51,000
But our genetic results suggest that in schizophrenia,

247
0:13:52.905,000 --> 0:13:55,000
the elimination process may go into overdrive.

248
0:13:57.185,000 --> 0:14:,000
Scientists at many drug companies tell me they're excited about this discovery,

249
0:14:01.138,000 --> 0:14:04,000
because they've been working on complement proteins for years

250
0:14:04.401,000 --> 0:14:05,000
in the immune system,

251
0:14:05.965,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and they've learned a lot about how they work.

252
0:14:08.885,000 --> 0:14:11,000
They've even developed molecules that interfere with complement proteins,

253
0:14:12.803,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and they're starting to test them in the brain as well as the immune system.

254
0:14:17.124,000 --> 0:14:21,000
It's potentially a path toward a drug that might address a root cause

255
0:14:21.869,000 --> 0:14:23,000
rather than an individual symptom,

256
0:14:24.542,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and we hope very much that this work by many scientists over many years

257
0:14:28.614,000 --> 0:14:29,000
will be successful.

258
0:14:31.689,000 --> 0:14:34,000
But C4 is just one example

259
0:14:34.727,000 --> 0:14:37,000
of the potential for data-driven scientific approaches

260
0:14:37.863,000 --> 0:14:4,000
to open new fronts on medical problems that are centuries old.

261
0:14:42.144,000 --> 0:14:44,000
There are hundreds of places in our genomes

262
0:14:44.913,000 --> 0:14:46,000
that shape risk for brain illnesses,

263
0:14:47.522,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and any one of them could lead us to the next molecular insight

264
0:14:51.612,000 --> 0:14:53,000
about a molecule that matters.

265
0:14:53.656,000 --> 0:14:56,000
And there are hundreds of cell types that use these genes in different combinations.

266
0:14:57.667,000 --> 0:14:59,000
As we and other scientists work to generate

267
0:14:59.76,000 --> 0:15:01,000
the rest of the data that's needed

268
0:15:01.853,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and to learn all that we can from that data,

269
0:15:04.27,000 --> 0:15:06,000
we hope to open many more new fronts.

270
0:15:08.483,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Genetics and single-cell analysis are just two ways

271
0:15:13.586,000 --> 0:15:16,000
of trying to turn the brain into a big data problem.

272
0:15:18.424,000 --> 0:15:2,000
There is so much more we can do.

273
0:15:21.235,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Scientists in my lab are creating a technology

274
0:15:24.333,000 --> 0:15:27,000
for quickly mapping the synaptic connections in the brain

275
0:15:27.553,000 --> 0:15:29,000
to tell which neurons are talking to which other neurons

276
0:15:30.515,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and how that conversation changes throughout life and during illness.

277
0:15:35.467,000 --> 0:15:39,000
And we're developing a way to test in a single tube

278
0:15:40.011,000 --> 0:15:42,000
how cells with hundreds of different people's genomes

279
0:15:42.753,000 --> 0:15:44,000
respond differently to the same stimulus.

280
0:15:46.248,000 --> 0:15:5,000
These projects bring together people with diverse backgrounds

281
0:15:51.175,000 --> 0:15:53,000
and training and interests --

282
0:15:53.692,000 --> 0:15:58,000
biology, computers, chemistry, math, statistics, engineering.

283
0:16:00.205,000 --> 0:16:04,000
But the scientific possibilities rally people with diverse interests

284
0:16:04.461,000 --> 0:16:06,000
into working intensely together.

285
0:16:08.871,000 --> 0:16:1,000
What's the future that we could hope to create?

286
0:16:12.267,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Consider cancer.

287
0:16:14.193,000 --> 0:16:17,000
We've moved from an era of ignorance about what causes cancer,

288
0:16:18.139,000 --> 0:16:24,000
in which cancer was commonly ascribed to personal psychological characteristics,

289
0:16:26.238,000 --> 0:16:31,000
to a modern molecular understanding of the true biological causes of cancer.

290
0:16:32.1,000 --> 0:16:35,000
That understanding today leads to innovative medicine

291
0:16:35.198,000 --> 0:16:36,000
after innovative medicine,

292
0:16:36.918,000 --> 0:16:38,000
and although there's still so much work to do,

293
0:16:39.781,000 --> 0:16:42,000
we're already surrounded by people who have been cured of cancers

294
0:16:43.199,000 --> 0:16:46,000
that were considered untreatable a generation ago.

295
0:16:48.254,000 --> 0:16:51,000
And millions of cancer survivors like my sister

296
0:16:51.654,000 --> 0:16:55,000
find themselves with years of life that they didn't take for granted

297
0:16:56.079,000 --> 0:16:57,000
and new opportunities

298
0:16:57.872,000 --> 0:17:,000
for work and joy and human connection.

299
0:17:03.358,000 --> 0:17:07,000
That is the future that we are determined to create around mental illness --

300
0:17:08.581,000 --> 0:17:12,000
one of real understanding and empathy

301
0:17:12.724,000 --> 0:17:13,000
and limitless possibility.

302
0:17:15.159,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Thank you.

303
0:17:16.374,000 --> 0:17:2,000
(Applause)

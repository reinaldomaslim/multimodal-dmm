1
0:00:12.439,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Hi everybody. So my name is Mac.

2
0:00:14.531,000 --> 0:00:18,000
My job is that I lie to children,

3
0:00:18.589,000 --> 0:00:2,000
but they're honest lies.

4
0:00:20.605,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I write children's books,

5
0:00:22.373,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and there's a quote from Pablo Picasso,

6
0:00:25.601,000 --> 0:00:28,000
"We all know that Art is not truth.

7
0:00:28.787,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Art is a lie that makes us realize truth

8
0:00:32.429,000 --> 0:00:34,000
or at least the truth that is given us to understand.

9
0:00:35.127,000 --> 0:00:37,000
The artist must know the manner whereby

10
0:00:37.237,000 --> 0:00:41,000
to convince others of the truthfulness of his lies."

11
0:00:42.074,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I first heard this when I was a kid,

12
0:00:44.932,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and I loved it,

13
0:00:46.623,000 --> 0:00:48,000
but I had no idea what it meant.

14
0:00:49.415,000 --> 0:00:5,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:50.992,000 --> 0:00:51,000
So I thought, you know what, it's what I'm here

16
0:00:52.889,000 --> 0:00:53,000
to talk to you today about, though,

17
0:00:54.508,000 --> 0:00:56,000
truth and lies, fiction and reality.

18
0:00:56.721,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So how could I untangle

19
0:00:58.573,000 --> 0:01:,000
this knotted bunch of sentences?

20
0:01:01.1,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And I said, I've got PowerPoint. Let's do a Venn diagram.

21
0:01:04.527,000 --> 0:01:06,000
["Truth. Lies."] (Laughter)

22
0:01:07.02,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So there it is, right there, boom.

23
0:01:08.78,000 --> 0:01:09,000
We've got truth and lies

24
0:01:10.485,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and then there's this little space,

25
0:01:11.557,000 --> 0:01:12,000
the edge, in the middle.

26
0:01:13.118,000 --> 0:01:19,000
That liminal space, that's art.

27
0:01:19.918,000 --> 0:01:23,000
All right. Venn diagram. (Laughter) (Applause)

28
0:01:24.915,000 --> 0:01:27,000
But that's actually not very helpful either.

29
0:01:27.941,000 --> 0:01:31,000
The thing that made me understand

30
0:01:32.316,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that quote and really kind of what art,

31
0:01:34.806,000 --> 0:01:36,000
at least the art of fiction, was,

32
0:01:37.023,000 --> 0:01:38,000
was working with kids.

33
0:01:38.463,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I used to be a summer camp counselor.

34
0:01:40.723,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I would do it on my summers off from college,

35
0:01:43.01,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and I loved it.

36
0:01:46.389,000 --> 0:01:47,000
It was a sports summer camp

37
0:01:48.148,000 --> 0:01:49,000
for four- to six-year-olds.

38
0:01:49.982,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I was in charge of the four-year-olds,

39
0:01:51.628,000 --> 0:01:52,000
which is good, because

40
0:01:53.431,000 --> 0:01:56,000
four-year-olds can't play sports, and neither can I.

41
0:01:56.78,000 --> 0:01:57,000
(Laughter)

42
0:01:58.355,000 --> 0:02:,000
I play sports at a four-year-old level,

43
0:02:01.28,000 --> 0:02:04,000
so what would happen is the kids would

44
0:02:04.997,000 --> 0:02:05,000
dribble around some cones, and then got hot,

45
0:02:06.696,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and then they would go sit underneath the tree

46
0:02:08.959,000 --> 0:02:1,000
where I was already sitting — (Laughter) —

47
0:02:11.804,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and I would just make up stories and tell them to them

48
0:02:14.349,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and I would tell them stories about my life.

49
0:02:16.168,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I would tell them about how, on the weekends,

50
0:02:17.911,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I would go home and I would spy for the Queen of England.

51
0:02:21.126,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And soon, other kids

52
0:02:24.447,000 --> 0:02:25,000
who weren't even in my group of kids,

53
0:02:26.287,000 --> 0:02:27,000
they would come up to me, and they would say,

54
0:02:27.756,000 --> 0:02:28,000
"You're Mac Barnett, right?

55
0:02:29.668,000 --> 0:02:32,000
You're the guy who spies for the Queen of England."

56
0:02:32.737,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And I had been waiting my whole life for strangers

57
0:02:35.959,000 --> 0:02:37,000
to come up and ask me that question.

58
0:02:38.389,000 --> 0:02:4,000
In my fantasy, they were svelte Russian women,

59
0:02:40.662,000 --> 0:02:41,000
but, you know, four-year-olds —

60
0:02:41.899,000 --> 0:02:45,000
you take what you can get in Berkeley, California.

61
0:02:46.528,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And I realized that the stories that I was telling

62
0:02:50.956,000 --> 0:02:53,000
were real in this way that was familiar to me

63
0:02:54.453,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and really exciting.

64
0:02:55.658,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I think the pinnacle of this for me — I'll never forget this —

65
0:02:57.864,000 --> 0:02:59,000
there was this little girl named Riley. She was tiny,

66
0:03:00.687,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and she used to always take out her lunch every day

67
0:03:03.126,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and she would throw out her fruit.

68
0:03:05.466,000 --> 0:03:06,000
She would just take her fruit,

69
0:03:06.874,000 --> 0:03:07,000
her mom packed her a melon every day,

70
0:03:08.222,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and she would just throw it in the ivy

71
0:03:09.971,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and then she would eat fruit snacks

72
0:03:12.284,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and pudding cups, and I was like, "Riley,

73
0:03:14.657,000 --> 0:03:17,000
you can't do that, you have to eat the fruit."

74
0:03:17.713,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And she was like, "Why?"

75
0:03:19.53,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And I was like, "Well, when you throw the fruit in the ivy,

76
0:03:21.362,000 --> 0:03:24,000
pretty soon, it's going to be overgrown with melons,"

77
0:03:25.254,000 --> 0:03:27,000
which is why I think I ended up

78
0:03:27.256,000 --> 0:03:32,000
telling stories to children and not being a nutritionist for children.

79
0:03:32.875,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And so Riley was like, "That will never happen.

80
0:03:34.763,000 --> 0:03:35,000
That's not going to happen."

81
0:03:35.863,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And so, on the last day of camp,

82
0:03:38.914,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I got up early and I got a big cantaloupe

83
0:03:41.367,000 --> 0:03:43,000
from the grocery store

84
0:03:43.393,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and I hid it in the ivy,

85
0:03:45.495,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and then at lunchtime, I was like,

86
0:03:46.946,000 --> 0:03:48,000
"Riley, why don't you go over there and see what you've done."

87
0:03:49.621,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And — (Laughter) —

88
0:03:52.796,000 --> 0:03:54,000
she went trudging through the ivy, and then her eyes

89
0:03:55.474,000 --> 0:03:57,000
just got so wide, and she pointed out this melon

90
0:03:57.566,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that was bigger than her head,

91
0:03:59.68,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and then all the kids ran over there and rushed around her,

92
0:04:02.65,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and one of the kids was like, "Hey,

93
0:04:04.237,000 --> 0:04:05,000
why is there a sticker on this?"

94
0:04:06.126,000 --> 0:04:09,000
(Laughter)

95
0:04:09.35,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And I was like, "That is also why I say

96
0:04:11.819,000 --> 0:04:13,000
do not throw your stickers in the ivy.

97
0:04:14.811,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Put them in the trash can. It ruins nature when you do this."

98
0:04:20.283,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And Riley carried that melon around with her all day,

99
0:04:25.633,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and she was so proud.

100
0:04:27.661,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And Riley knew she didn't grow a melon in seven days,

101
0:04:32.505,000 --> 0:04:34,000
but she also knew that she did,

102
0:04:35.441,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and it's a weird place,

103
0:04:37.657,000 --> 0:04:39,000
but it's not just a place that kids can get to.

104
0:04:40.402,000 --> 0:04:43,000
It's anything. Art can get us to that place.

105
0:04:43.934,000 --> 0:04:44,000
She was right in that place in the middle,

106
0:04:45.891,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that place which you could call art or fiction.

107
0:04:49.316,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I'm going to call it wonder.

108
0:04:51.381,000 --> 0:04:53,000
It's what Coleridge called the willing suspension of disbelief

109
0:04:54.01,000 --> 0:04:55,000
or poetic faith,

110
0:04:55.69,000 --> 0:04:57,000
for those moments where a story, no matter how strange,

111
0:04:58.1,000 --> 0:05:,000
has some semblance of the truth,

112
0:05:00.14,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and then you're able to believe it.

113
0:05:02.117,000 --> 0:05:03,000
It's not just kids who can get there.

114
0:05:03.747,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Adults can too, and we get there when we read.

115
0:05:06.436,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It's why in two days, people will be

116
0:05:08.686,000 --> 0:05:11,000
descending on Dublin to take the walking tour

117
0:05:12.22,000 --> 0:05:17,000
of Bloomsday and see everything that happened in "Ulysses,"

118
0:05:17.825,000 --> 0:05:19,000
even though none of that happened.

119
0:05:20.08,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Or people go to London and they visit Baker Street

120
0:05:22.337,000 --> 0:05:23,000
to see Sherlock Holmes' apartment,

121
0:05:23.809,000 --> 0:05:25,000
even though 221B is just a number that was painted

122
0:05:25.936,000 --> 0:05:28,000
on a building that never actually had that address.

123
0:05:29.082,000 --> 0:05:3,000
We know these characters aren't real,

124
0:05:30.807,000 --> 0:05:32,000
but we have real feelings about them,

125
0:05:33.427,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and we're able to do that.

126
0:05:34.471,000 --> 0:05:35,000
We know these characters aren't real,

127
0:05:36.364,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and yet we also know that they are.

128
0:05:39.682,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Kids can get there a lot more easily than adults can,

129
0:05:43.338,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and that's why I love writing for kids.

130
0:05:44.891,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I think kids are the best audience

131
0:05:46.871,000 --> 0:05:5,000
for serious literary fiction.

132
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
When I was a kid,

133
0:05:54.084,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I was obsessed with secret door novels,

134
0:05:56.71,000 --> 0:05:57,000
things like "Narnia,"

135
0:05:57.871,000 --> 0:06:,000
where you would open a wardrobe and go through to a magical land.

136
0:06:01.574,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And I was convinced that secret doors really did exist

137
0:06:04.304,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and I would look for them and try to go through them.

138
0:06:06.332,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I wanted to live and cross over into that fictional world, which is —

139
0:06:10.076,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I would always just open people's closet doors. (Laughter)

140
0:06:15.771,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I would just go through my mom's boyfriend's closet,

141
0:06:18.548,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and there was not a secret magical land there.

142
0:06:20.798,000 --> 0:06:22,000
There was some other weird stuff that I think my mom should know about.

143
0:06:23.386,000 --> 0:06:24,000
(Laughter)

144
0:06:25.107,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And I was happy to tell her all about it.

145
0:06:31.545,000 --> 0:06:35,000
After college, my first job was working

146
0:06:35.683,000 --> 0:06:37,000
behind one of these secret doors.

147
0:06:38.231,000 --> 0:06:39,000
This is a place called 826 Valencia.

148
0:06:40.188,000 --> 0:06:42,000
It's at 826 Valencia Street

149
0:06:42.28,000 --> 0:06:44,000
in the Mission in San Francisco,

150
0:06:44.766,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and when I worked there, there was a publishing company

151
0:06:46.792,000 --> 0:06:48,000
headquartered there called McSweeney's,

152
0:06:49.431,000 --> 0:06:52,000
a nonprofit writing center called 826 Valencia,

153
0:06:52.585,000 --> 0:06:54,000
but then the front of it

154
0:06:54.79,000 --> 0:06:55,000
was a strange shop.

155
0:06:56.36,000 --> 0:06:57,000
You see, this place was zoned retail,

156
0:06:57.787,000 --> 0:07:,000
and in San Francisco, they were not going to give us a variance,

157
0:07:00.903,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and so the writer who founded it, a writer named Dave Eggers,

158
0:07:03.79,000 --> 0:07:05,000
to come into compliance with code, he said, "Fine,

159
0:07:06.129,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I'm just going to build a pirate supply store."

160
0:07:10.505,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And that's what he did. (Laughter)

161
0:07:13.583,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And it's beautiful. It's all wood.

162
0:07:15.534,000 --> 0:07:16,000
There's drawers you can pull out and get citrus

163
0:07:17.464,000 --> 0:07:2,000
so you don't get scurvy.

164
0:07:20.483,000 --> 0:07:22,000
They have eyepatches in lots of colors,

165
0:07:22.631,000 --> 0:07:24,000
because when it's springtime, pirates want to go wild.

166
0:07:25.331,000 --> 0:07:29,000
You don't know. Black is boring. Pastel.

167
0:07:29.674,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Or eyes, also in lots of colors,

168
0:07:31.67,000 --> 0:07:32,000
just glass eyes, depending on how you want

169
0:07:33.475,000 --> 0:07:36,000
to deal with that situation.

170
0:07:37.187,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And the store, strangely,

171
0:07:40.312,000 --> 0:07:44,000
people came to them and bought things,

172
0:07:44.324,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and they ended up paying the rent

173
0:07:46.151,000 --> 0:07:48,000
for our tutoring center, which was behind it,

174
0:07:48.215,000 --> 0:07:51,000
but to me, more important was the fact

175
0:07:51.267,000 --> 0:07:53,000
that I think the quality of work you do,

176
0:07:53.918,000 --> 0:07:55,000
kids would come and get instruction in writing,

177
0:07:56.404,000 --> 0:08:,000
and when you have to walk this weird, liminal, fictional space like this to go do your writing,

178
0:08:00.67,000 --> 0:08:03,000
it's going to affect the kind of work that you make.

179
0:08:04.42,000 --> 0:08:06,000
It's a secret door that you can walk through.

180
0:08:06.607,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So I ran the 826 in Los Angeles,

181
0:08:09.358,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and it was my job to build the store down there.

182
0:08:12.84,000 --> 0:08:15,000
So we have The Echo Park Time Travel Mart.

183
0:08:16.4,000 --> 0:08:18,000
That's our motto: "Whenever you are, we're already then."

184
0:08:19.24,000 --> 0:08:22,000
(Laughter)

185
0:08:23.1,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And it's on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.

186
0:08:27.857,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Our friendly staff is ready to help you.

187
0:08:29.967,000 --> 0:08:31,000
They're from all eras,

188
0:08:32.11,000 --> 0:08:35,000
including just the 1980s, that guy on the end,

189
0:08:35.719,000 --> 0:08:37,000
he's from the very recent past.

190
0:08:37.916,000 --> 0:08:38,000
There's our Employees of the Month,

191
0:08:39.618,000 --> 0:08:41,000
including Genghis Khan, Charles Dickens.

192
0:08:42.604,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Some great people have come up through our ranks.

193
0:08:45.596,000 --> 0:08:47,000
This is our kind of pharmacy section.

194
0:08:47.947,000 --> 0:08:48,000
We have some patent medicines,

195
0:08:49.286,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Canopic jars for your organs,

196
0:08:51.637,000 --> 0:08:52,000
communist soap that says,

197
0:08:53.271,000 --> 0:08:57,000
"This is your soap for the year." (Laughter)

198
0:08:57.722,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Our slushy machine broke

199
0:08:59.938,000 --> 0:09:01,000
on the opening night and we didn't know what to do.

200
0:09:02.571,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Our architect was covered in red syrup.

201
0:09:04.81,000 --> 0:09:06,000
It looked like he had just murdered somebody,

202
0:09:07.284,000 --> 0:09:08,000
which it was not out of the question

203
0:09:08.971,000 --> 0:09:1,000
for this particular architect,

204
0:09:11.021,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and we didn't know what to do.

205
0:09:12.607,000 --> 0:09:13,000
It was going to be the highlight of our store.

206
0:09:13.639,000 --> 0:09:14,000
So we just put that sign on it that said,

207
0:09:14.984,000 --> 0:09:18,000
"Out of order. Come back yesterday." (Laughter)

208
0:09:19.489,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And that ended up being a better joke than slushies,

209
0:09:21.525,000 --> 0:09:25,000
so we just left it there forever.

210
0:09:25.621,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Mammoth Chunks. These things weigh, like, seven pounds each.

211
0:09:29.934,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Barbarian repellent. It's full of salad

212
0:09:32.134,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and potpourri — things that barbarians hate.

213
0:09:36.712,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Dead languages.

214
0:09:38.67,000 --> 0:09:4,000
(Laughter)

215
0:09:41.37,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Leeches, nature's tiny doctors.

216
0:09:44.45,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And Viking Odorant, which comes in lots of great scents:

217
0:09:47.59,000 --> 0:09:51,000
toenails, sweat and rotten vegetables, pyre ash.

218
0:09:51.595,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Because we believe that Axe Body Spray

219
0:09:53.703,000 --> 0:09:54,000
is something that you should only find on the battlefield,

220
0:09:55.366,000 --> 0:09:59,000
not under your arms. (Laughter)

221
0:09:59.56,000 --> 0:10:,000
And these are robot emotion chips,

222
0:10:01.544,000 --> 0:10:03,000
so robots can feel love or fear.

223
0:10:03.771,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Our biggest seller is Schadenfreude,

224
0:10:05.481,000 --> 0:10:06,000
which we did not expect.

225
0:10:06.782,000 --> 0:10:07,000
(Laughter)

226
0:10:07.793,000 --> 0:10:09,000
We did not think that was going to happen.

227
0:10:10.24,000 --> 0:10:12,000
But there's a nonprofit behind it,

228
0:10:12.501,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and kids go through a door that says "Employees Only"

229
0:10:14.481,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and they end up in this space

230
0:10:15.696,000 --> 0:10:17,000
where they do homework and write stories

231
0:10:17.87,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and make films and this is a book release party

232
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
where kids will read.

233
0:10:21.814,000 --> 0:10:22,000
There's a quarterly that's published

234
0:10:23.716,000 --> 0:10:24,000
with just writing that's done by the kids

235
0:10:25.145,000 --> 0:10:26,000
who come every day after school,

236
0:10:26.202,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and we have release parties

237
0:10:27.73,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and they eat cake and read for their parents

238
0:10:30.677,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and drink milk out of champagne glasses.

239
0:10:33.529,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And it's a very special space,

240
0:10:36.777,000 --> 0:10:39,000
because it's this weird space in the front.

241
0:10:39.996,000 --> 0:10:42,000
The joke isn't a joke.

242
0:10:43.295,000 --> 0:10:45,000
You can't find the seams on the fiction,

243
0:10:45.695,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and I love that. It's this little bit of fiction

244
0:10:48.603,000 --> 0:10:51,000
that's colonized the real world.

245
0:10:51.865,000 --> 0:10:55,000
I see it as kind of a book in three dimensions.

246
0:10:55.922,000 --> 0:10:57,000
There's a term called metafiction,

247
0:10:58.162,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and that's just stories about stories,

248
0:11:02.245,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and meta's having a moment now.

249
0:11:03.82,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Its last big moment was probably in the 1960s

250
0:11:05.845,000 --> 0:11:07,000
with novelists like John Barth and William Gaddis,

251
0:11:08.522,000 --> 0:11:09,000
but it's been around.

252
0:11:09.77,000 --> 0:11:12,000
It's almost as old as storytelling itself.

253
0:11:13.311,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And one metafictive technique

254
0:11:15.851,000 --> 0:11:16,000
is breaking the fourth wall. Right?

255
0:11:17.645,000 --> 0:11:2,000
It's when an actor will turn to the audience

256
0:11:20.895,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and say, "I am an actor,

257
0:11:21.961,000 --> 0:11:23,000
these are just rafters."

258
0:11:24.552,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And even that supposedly honest moment,

259
0:11:26.577,000 --> 0:11:28,000
I would argue, is in service of the lie,

260
0:11:28.803,000 --> 0:11:3,000
but it's supposed to foreground the artificiality

261
0:11:31.559,000 --> 0:11:32,000
of the fiction.

262
0:11:33.246,000 --> 0:11:35,000
For me, I kind of prefer the opposite.

263
0:11:35.395,000 --> 0:11:37,000
If I'm going to break down the fourth wall,

264
0:11:37.529,000 --> 0:11:39,000
I want fiction to escape

265
0:11:39.872,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and come into the real world.

266
0:11:41.955,000 --> 0:11:45,000
I want a book to be a secret door that opens

267
0:11:46.554,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and lets the stories out into reality.

268
0:11:49.446,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And so I try to do this in my books.

269
0:11:52.427,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And here's just one example.

270
0:11:53.97,000 --> 0:11:54,000
This is the first book that I ever made.

271
0:11:55.892,000 --> 0:11:57,000
It's called "Billy Twitters and his Blue Whale Problem."

272
0:11:58.513,000 --> 0:12:,000
And it's about a kid who gets a blue whale as a pet

273
0:12:00.643,000 --> 0:12:01,000
but it's a punishment

274
0:12:02.229,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and it ruins his life.

275
0:12:04.704,000 --> 0:12:06,000
So it's delivered overnight by FedUp.

276
0:12:07.516,000 --> 0:12:09,000
(Laughter)

277
0:12:10.106,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And he has to take it to school with him.

278
0:12:12.1,000 --> 0:12:13,000
He lives in San Francisco —

279
0:12:13.454,000 --> 0:12:15,000
very tough city to own a blue whale in.

280
0:12:15.985,000 --> 0:12:19,000
A lot of hills, real estate is at a premium.

281
0:12:20.419,000 --> 0:12:22,000
This market's crazy, everybody.

282
0:12:22.927,000 --> 0:12:25,000
But underneath the jacket is this case,

283
0:12:26.718,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and that's the cover underneath the book, the jacket,

284
0:12:30.904,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and there's an ad

285
0:12:32.284,000 --> 0:12:35,000
that offers a free 30-day risk-free trial

286
0:12:35.527,000 --> 0:12:36,000
for a blue whale.

287
0:12:37.426,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And you can just send in a self-addressed stamped envelope

288
0:12:40.42,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and we'll send you a whale.

289
0:12:44.27,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And kids do write in.

290
0:12:48.61,000 --> 0:12:51,000
So here's a letter. It says, "Dear people,

291
0:12:52.018,000 --> 0:12:55,000
I bet you 10 bucks you won't send me a blue whale.

292
0:12:55.199,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Eliot Gannon (age 6)."

293
0:12:57.676,000 --> 0:13:,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

294
0:13:02.838,000 --> 0:13:04,000
So what Eliot and the other kids

295
0:13:04.96,000 --> 0:13:06,000
who send these in get back

296
0:13:07.451,000 --> 0:13:09,000
is a letter in very small print from a Norwegian law firm —

297
0:13:10.376,000 --> 0:13:13,000
(Laughter) —

298
0:13:14.337,000 --> 0:13:17,000
that says that due to a change in customs laws,

299
0:13:17.698,000 --> 0:13:19,000
their whale has been held up in Sognefjord,

300
0:13:19.905,000 --> 0:13:2,000
which is a very lovely fjord,

301
0:13:21.129,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and then it just kind of talks about Sognefjord

302
0:13:22.593,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and Norwegian food for a little while. It digresses.

303
0:13:25.073,000 --> 0:13:26,000
(Laughter)

304
0:13:28.767,000 --> 0:13:29,000
But it finishes off by saying that

305
0:13:30.68,000 --> 0:13:32,000
your whale would love to hear from you.

306
0:13:33.414,000 --> 0:13:34,000
He's got a phone number,

307
0:13:35,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and you can call and leave him a message.

308
0:13:39.714,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And when you call and leave him a message,

309
0:13:42.29,000 --> 0:13:43,000
you just, on the outgoing message,

310
0:13:44.281,000 --> 0:13:49,000
it's just whale sounds and then a beep,

311
0:13:49.399,000 --> 0:13:52,000
which actually sounds a lot like a whale sound.

312
0:13:52.954,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And they get a picture of their whale too.

313
0:13:54.934,000 --> 0:13:56,000
So this is Randolph,

314
0:13:57.465,000 --> 0:14:,000
and Randolph belongs to a kid named Nico

315
0:14:00.806,000 --> 0:14:04,000
who was one of the first kids to ever call in,

316
0:14:05.088,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and I'll play you some of Nico's message.

317
0:14:07.398,000 --> 0:14:11,000
This is the first message I ever got from Nico.

318
0:14:11.53,000 --> 0:14:13,000
(Audio) Nico: Hello, this is Nico.

319
0:14:13.769,000 --> 0:14:17,000
I am your owner, Randolph. Hello.

320
0:14:17.803,000 --> 0:14:2,000
So this is the first time I can ever talk to you,

321
0:14:21.279,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and I might talk to you soon another day. Bye.

322
0:14:27.523,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Mac Barnett: So Nico called back, like, an hour later.

323
0:14:30.11,000 --> 0:14:32,000
(Laughter)

324
0:14:32.36,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And here's another one of Nico's messages.

325
0:14:36.297,000 --> 0:14:39,000
(Audio) Nico: Hello, Randolph, this is Nico.

326
0:14:39.84,000 --> 0:14:44,000
I haven't talked to you for a long time,

327
0:14:44.993,000 --> 0:14:48,000
but I talked to you on Saturday or Sunday,

328
0:14:49.688,000 --> 0:14:51,000
yeah, Saturday or Sunday,

329
0:14:51.938,000 --> 0:14:54,000
so now I'm calling you again

330
0:14:54.953,000 --> 0:14:58,000
to say hello and I wonder what you're doing right now,

331
0:14:59.869,000 --> 0:15:01,000
and I'm going to probably call you again

332
0:15:02.805,000 --> 0:15:04,000
tomorrow or today,

333
0:15:04.988,000 --> 0:15:08,000
so I'll talk to you later. Bye.

334
0:15:09.184,000 --> 0:15:13,000
MB: So he did, he called back that day again.

335
0:15:13.492,000 --> 0:15:16,000
He's left over 25 messages for Randolph

336
0:15:17.373,000 --> 0:15:19,000
over four years.

337
0:15:20.125,000 --> 0:15:22,000
You find out all about him

338
0:15:22.216,000 --> 0:15:23,000
and the grandma that he loves

339
0:15:23.852,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and the grandma that he likes a little bit less —

340
0:15:26.207,000 --> 0:15:28,000
(Laughter) —

341
0:15:28.4,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and the crossword puzzles that he does,

342
0:15:30.827,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and this is — I'll play you one more message from Nico.

343
0:15:34.607,000 --> 0:15:37,000
This is the Christmas message from Nico.

344
0:15:37.91,000 --> 0:15:39,000
[Beep] (Audio) Nico: Hello, Randolph,

345
0:15:40.273,000 --> 0:15:43,000
sorry I haven't talked to you in a long time.

346
0:15:43.528,000 --> 0:15:45,000
It's just that I've been so busy

347
0:15:46.194,000 --> 0:15:48,000
because school started,

348
0:15:48.893,000 --> 0:15:51,000
as you might not know, probably,

349
0:15:51.926,000 --> 0:15:54,000
since you're a whale, you don't know,

350
0:15:55.807,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and I'm calling you to just say,

351
0:16:00.487,000 --> 0:16:03,000
to wish you a merry Christmas.

352
0:16:04.177,000 --> 0:16:08,000
So have a nice Christmas,

353
0:16:08.778,000 --> 0:16:14,000
and bye-bye, Randolph. Goodbye.

354
0:16:15.651,000 --> 0:16:16,000
MB: I actually got Nico,

355
0:16:17.175,000 --> 0:16:2,000
I hadn't heard from in 18 months,

356
0:16:20.306,000 --> 0:16:24,000
and he just left a message two days ago.

357
0:16:24.424,000 --> 0:16:26,000
His voice is completely different,

358
0:16:26.85,000 --> 0:16:29,000
but he put his babysitter on the phone,

359
0:16:30.35,000 --> 0:16:33,000
and she was very nice to Randolph as well.

360
0:16:34.211,000 --> 0:16:38,000
But Nico's the best reader I could hope for.

361
0:16:38.561,000 --> 0:16:41,000
I would want anyone I was writing for

362
0:16:42.287,000 --> 0:16:44,000
to be in that place emotionally

363
0:16:44.428,000 --> 0:16:46,000
with the things that I create.

364
0:16:46.664,000 --> 0:16:49,000
I feel lucky. Kids like Nico are the best readers,

365
0:16:50.365,000 --> 0:16:53,000
and they deserve the best stories we can give them.

366
0:16:53.96,000 --> 0:16:55,000
Thank you very much.

367
0:16:56.162,000 --> 0:16:58,000
(Applause)

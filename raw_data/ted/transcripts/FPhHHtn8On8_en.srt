YR: I was born and raised near Manchester,

12
0:00:54.583,000 --> 0:00:54,000
in England,

13
0:00:55.55,000 --> 0:00:58,000
but I'm not going to say it in English to you,

14
0:00:59.122,000 --> 0:01:01,000
because I'm trying to avoid any assumptions

15
0:01:01.883,000 --> 0:01:04,000
that might be made from my northern accent.

19
0:01:19.487,000 --> 0:01:2,000
with Chinese Mandarin

20
0:01:21.037,000 --> 0:01:23,000
is I can only speak this paragraph,

21
0:01:23.755,000 --> 0:01:24,000
which I have learned by heart

22
0:01:25.534,000 --> 0:01:27,000
when I was visiting in China. (Laughter)

23
0:01:28.204,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So all I can do is keep repeating it in different tones

24
0:01:32.092,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and hope you won't notice.

25

to any Mandarin speakers in the audience.

30
0:01:54.214,000 --> 0:01:56,000
As a child, I would hate being made

31
0:01:56.887,000 --> 0:01:58,000
to wear the Indian kurta pajama,

32
0:01:59.515,000 --> 0:02:01,000
because I didn't think it was very cool.

33
0:02:02.513,000 --> 0:02:05,000
It felt a bit girly to me, like a dress,

34
0:02:05.814,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and it had this baggy trouser part

35
0:02:08.472,000 --> 0:02:1,000
you had to tie really tight

36
0:02:10.715,000 --> 0:02:13,000
to avoid the embarrassment of them falling down.

37

My dad never wore it,

38
0:02:16.175,000 --> 0:02:18,000
so I didn't see why I had to.

39
0:02:19.1,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Also, it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable,

40
0:02:22.453,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that people assume I represent something

41
0:02:25.148,000 --> 0:02:27,000
genuinely Indian when I wear it,

42
0:02:27.474,000 --> 0:02:3,000
because that's not how I feel.

HP: (In Chinese)

44

YR: Actually, the only way I feel comfortable

45
0:02:39.702,000 --> 0:02:41,000
wearing it is by pretending

46
0:02:42.11,000 --> 0:02:45,000
they are the robes of a kung fu warrior

47
0:02:45.321,000 --> 0:02:47,000
like Li Mu Bai from that film,

48

"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."

Okay.

51
0:03:36.992,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So my artwork is about identity and language,

52
0:03:44.063,000 --> 0:03:46,000
challenging common assumptions

53
0:03:46.793,000 --> 0:03:5,000
based on how we look like or where we come from,

54

gender, race, class.

55
0:03:55.082,000 --> 0:03:58,000
What makes us who we are anyway?

take philosophy lessons from Bruce Lee.

Be formless, shapeless, like water.

64
0:04:22.429,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Now you put water into a cup.

65
0:04:24.419,000 --> 0:04:26,000
It becomes the cup.

You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle.

67

Put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot.

68

Now, water can flow

69

the same age Bruce Lee was when he died.

73
0:04:49.676,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I have been wondering recently,

74
0:04:52.27,000 --> 0:04:53,000
if he were alive today,

75
0:04:54.2,000 --> 0:04:56,000
what advice he would give me

0:04:56.226,000 --> 0:04:59,000
about making this TED Talk.

77
0:05:00.17,000 --> 0:05:03,000
HP: Don't imitate my voice.

78
0:05:03.908,000 --> 0:05:05,000
It offends me.

0:05:05.979,000 --> 0:05:07,000
(Laughter)

0:05:08.009,000 --> 0:05:09,000
YR: Good advice,

81
0:05:09.76,000 --> 0:05:12,000
but I still think that we learn who we are

82
0:05:13.472,000 --> 0:05:15,000
by copying others.

83
0:05:15.575,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Who here hasn't imitated their childhood hero

84
0:05:19.792,000 --> 0:05:22,000
in the playground, or mum or father?

85
0:05:23.687,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I have.

86
0:05:25.948,000 --> 0:05:29,000
HP: A few years ago, in order to make this video

87
0:05:30.49,000 --> 0:05:34,000
for my artwork, I shaved off all my hair

88
0:05:34.495,000 --> 0:05:37,000
so that I could grow it back as my father had it

89
0:05:37.638,000 --> 0:05:39,000
when he first emigrated from India

90
0:05:40.404,000 --> 0:05:43,000
to the U.K. in the 1960s.

91
0:05:43.668,000 --> 0:05:47,000
He had a side parting and a neat mustache.

92
0:05:47.798,000 --> 0:05:49,000
At first, it was going very well.

93
0:05:50.417,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I even started to get discounts in Indian shops.

94
0:05:53.467,000 --> 0:05:57,000
(Laughter)

95
0:05:57.468,000 --> 0:05:58,000
But then very quickly,

96
0:05:59.092,000 --> 0:06:,000
I started to underestimate

97
0:06:00.839,000 --> 0:06:01,000
my mustache growing ability,

98
0:06:02.519,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and it got way too big.

99
0:06:05.921,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It didn't look Indian anymore.

100
0:06:08.668,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Instead, people from across the road,

101
0:06:10.511,000 --> 0:06:11,000
they would shout things like --

102
0:06:12.402,000 --> 0:06:14,000
HP and YR: Arriba! Arriba! Ándale! Ándale!

103
0:06:14.618,000 --> 0:06:16,000
(Laughter)

104
0:06:16.619,000 --> 0:06:18,000
HP: Actually, I don't know why I am even talking like this.

105
0:06:18.983,000 --> 0:06:21,000
My dad doesn't even have an Indian accent anymore.

106
0:06:21.987,000 --> 0:06:23,000
He talks like this now.

107
0:06:24.514,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So it's not just my father that I've imitated.

108
0:06:28.542,000 --> 0:06:31,000
A few years ago I went to China for a few months,

109
0:06:32.14,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and I couldn't speak Chinese,

110
0:06:34.974,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and this frustrated me,

111
0:06:36.786,000 --> 0:06:39,000
so I wrote about this and had it translated

112
0:06:40.738,000 --> 0:06:46,000
into Chinese, and then I learned this by heart,

113
0:06:47.225,000 --> 0:06:5,000
like music, I guess.

114
0:06:50.422,000 --> 0:06:53,000
YR: This phrase is now etched into my mind

115
0:06:53.763,000 --> 0:06:55,000
clearer than the pin number to my bank card,

116
0:06:56.642,000 --> 0:06:59,000
so I can pretend I speak Chinese fluently.

117
0:07:00.57,000 --> 0:07:02,000
When I had learned this phrase,

118
0:07:02.618,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I had an artist over there hear me out

119
0:07:05.354,000 --> 0:07:07,000
to see how accurate it sounded.

120
0:07:07.823,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I spoke the phrase, and then he laughed

121
0:07:10.309,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and told me, "Oh yeah, that's great,

122
0:07:13.12,000 --> 0:07:15,000
only it kind of sounds like a woman."

123
0:07:15.493,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I said, "What?"

124
0:07:16.955,000 --> 0:07:19,000
He said, "Yeah, you learned from a woman?"

125
0:07:20.877,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I said, "Yes. So?"

126
0:07:22.881,000 --> 0:07:24,000
He then explained the tonal differences

127
0:07:25.522,000 --> 0:07:27,000
between male and female voices

128
0:07:27.772,000 --> 0:07:3,000
are very different and distinct, and that I had learned it very well,

129
0:07:31.574,000 --> 0:07:32,000
but in a woman's voice.

130
0:07:33.567,000 --> 0:07:35,000
(Laughter)

131
0:07:35.79,000 --> 0:07:42,000
(Applause)

132
0:07:43.1,000 --> 0:07:46,000
HP: Okay. So this imitation business

133
0:07:46.519,000 --> 0:07:47,000
does come with risk.

134
0:07:48.204,000 --> 0:07:5,000
It doesn't always go as you plan it,

135
0:07:50.912,000 --> 0:07:53,000
even with a talented translator.

136
0:07:54.382,000 --> 0:07:56,000
But I am going to stick with it,

137
0:07:56.668,000 --> 0:08:,000
because contrary to what we might usually assume,

138
0:08:01.033,000 --> 0:08:05,000
imitating somebody can reveal something unique.

139
0:08:05.132,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So every time I fail

140
0:08:08.387,000 --> 0:08:1,000
to become more like my father,

141
0:08:10.943,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I become more like myself.

142
0:08:14.838,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Every time I fail to become Bruce Lee,

143
0:08:19.42,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I become more authentically me.

144
0:08:23.066,000 --> 0:08:24,000
This is my art.

145
0:08:24.551,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I strive for authenticity,

146
0:08:27.871,000 --> 0:08:29,000
even if it comes in a shape

147
0:08:30.106,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that we might not usually expect.

148
0:08:33.802,000 --> 0:08:37,000
It's only recently that I've started to understand

149
0:08:38.038,000 --> 0:08:41,000
that I didn't learn to sit like this

150
0:08:41.745,000 --> 0:08:43,000
through being Indian.

151
0:08:43.891,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I learned this from Spider-Man.

152
0:08:47.167,000 --> 0:08:48,000
(Laughter)

153
0:08:48.905,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Thank you.

154
0:08:50.462,000 --> 0:08:56,000
(Applause)

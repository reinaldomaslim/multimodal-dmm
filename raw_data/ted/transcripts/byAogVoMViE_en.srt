1
0:00:13.667,000 --> 0:00:14,000
When I was young,

2
0:00:15.125,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I wanted to be on TV:

3
0:00:17.5,000 --> 0:00:19,000
the lights, the cameras,

4
0:00:20.333,000 --> 0:00:21,000
the makeup,

5
0:00:22,000 --> 0:00:23,000
the glamorous life.

6
0:00:24.417,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And from my vantage point,

7
0:00:26.125,000 --> 0:00:29,000
just outside of a military base in Lawton, Oklahoma,

8
0:00:29.75,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I didn't make the distinction between TV reporter or actor.

9
0:00:33.75,000 --> 0:00:34,000
It was all the same to me.

10
0:00:35.375,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It was either,

11
0:00:36.667,000 --> 0:00:37,000
"Reporting live from Berlin"

12
0:00:38.083,000 --> 0:00:42,000
or "I shall attend her here and woo her with such spirit when she comes."

13
0:00:42.542,000 --> 0:00:43,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:43.833,000 --> 0:00:44,000
It was all special,

15
0:00:45.458,000 --> 0:00:46,000
it was all the spotlight,

16
0:00:47.208,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and I just knew that it was for me.

17
0:00:50.833,000 --> 0:00:52,000
But somewhere along my journey,

18
0:00:54.625,000 --> 0:00:55,000
life happened.

19
0:02:30.083,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Ah, much better.

20
0:02:32.167,000 --> 0:02:35,000
(Applause)

21
0:02:36.125,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I have a disease called vitiligo.

22
0:02:38.5,000 --> 0:02:4,000
It started early in my career.

23
0:02:42.542,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It's an autoimmune disorder.

24
0:02:45.875,000 --> 0:02:48,000
It's where it looks like your skin is getting white patches,

25
0:02:49.208,000 --> 0:02:5,000
but it's actually void of color.

26
0:02:51.625,000 --> 0:02:53,000
It affects all ethnicities,

27
0:02:54.042,000 --> 0:02:55,000
it affects all ages,

28
0:02:56.625,000 --> 0:02:57,000
all genders,

29
0:02:58.25,000 --> 0:02:59,000
it's not contagious,

30
0:02:59.667,000 --> 0:03:01,000
it's not life-threatening,

31
0:03:01.875,000 --> 0:03:03,000
but it is mental warfare.

32
0:03:05.458,000 --> 0:03:06,000
It's tough.

33
0:03:07.417,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Now, I was diagnosed with this disease

34
0:03:09.292,000 --> 0:03:11,000
when I was working on "Eyewitness News" in New York City.

35
0:03:12.875,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I was in the biggest city in the country,

36
0:03:15.958,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I was on their flagship station

37
0:03:18.75,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and I was on their top-rated 5pm newscast.

38
0:03:23.042,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And the doctor looked me right in the eye and said,

39
0:03:25.667,000 --> 0:03:26,000
"You have a disease called vitiligo.

40
0:03:27.458,000 --> 0:03:3,000
It's a skin disorder where you lose your pigment.

41
0:03:31.75,000 --> 0:03:34,000
There is no cure, but there a-la-la-la-la".

42
0:03:34.875,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Charlie Brown's teacher.

43
0:03:36.417,000 --> 0:03:37,000
(Laughter)

44
0:03:37.458,000 --> 0:03:42,000
He said there is no cure. All I heard was, "My career is over."

45
0:03:44.042,000 --> 0:03:45,000
But I just couldn't give up.

46
0:03:47.125,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I couldn't quit,

47
0:03:49.458,000 --> 0:03:52,000
because we put too much into this.

48
0:03:53.208,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And by "we" I mean Mr. Moss,

49
0:03:55.5,000 --> 0:03:59,000
who sent me to speech and drama club instead of to detention,

50
0:03:59.875,000 --> 0:04:03,000
or my sister who paid part of my college expenses,

51
0:04:03.958,000 --> 0:04:04,000
or my mom,

52
0:04:06.667,000 --> 0:04:1,000
who simply gave me everything.

53
0:04:15.667,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I would not quit.

54
0:04:18.625,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So I decided to just put on makeup and keep it moving.

55
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I had to wear makeup anyway. It's TV, baby, right?

56
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I just put on a little more makeup, and everything's cool.

57
0:04:32.708,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And that actually went very well for years.

58
0:04:36.5,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I went from being a reporter in New York City

59
0:04:40.042,000 --> 0:04:42,000
to being a morning show anchor in Detroit,

60
0:04:42.75,000 --> 0:04:43,000
the Motor City.

61
0:04:44.667,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And as the disease got worse,

62
0:04:47.583,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I just put on more makeup.

63
0:04:49.667,000 --> 0:04:5,000
It was easy.

64
0:04:51.542,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Except for my hands.

65
0:04:55.458,000 --> 0:04:58,000
See, this disease is progressive and ever-changing.

66
0:04:58.833,000 --> 0:05:,000
That means it comes and goes.

67
0:05:01.333,000 --> 0:05:04,000
At one point, for about a year and a half,

68
0:05:04.5,000 --> 0:05:06,000
my face was completely white.

69
0:05:10.5,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Yeah, it trips me out too.

70
0:05:11.792,000 --> 0:05:12,000
(Laughter)

71
0:05:13.125,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Yeah.

72
0:05:14.958,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And then, with a little help,

73
0:05:18.792,000 --> 0:05:2,000
some of the pigment came back,

74
0:05:21.792,000 --> 0:05:23,000
but living through this process

75
0:05:24.583,000 --> 0:05:25,000
was like two sides of a coin.

76
0:05:28.125,000 --> 0:05:3,000
When I'm at work and I'm wearing the makeup

77
0:05:30.208,000 --> 0:05:32,000
or wearing the makeup outside, I'm the TV guy.

78
0:05:32.542,000 --> 0:05:34,000
"Hey, how you doing everybody? Great."

79
0:05:34.75,000 --> 0:05:35,000
At home without the makeup,

80
0:05:36.25,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I'd take it off and it was like being a leper.

81
0:05:41.083,000 --> 0:05:43,000
The stares, constantly staring at me,

82
0:05:44.042,000 --> 0:05:47,000
the comments under their breath.

83
0:05:47.417,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Some people refused to shake my hand.

84
0:05:49.458,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Some people moved to the other side of the sidewalk,

85
0:05:52.208,000 --> 0:05:53,000
moved to the other side of the elevator.

86
0:05:54.167,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I felt like they were moving to the other side of life.

87
0:05:59.125,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It was tough,

88
0:06:01.542,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and those were some tough years.

89
0:06:06.417,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And honestly,

90
0:06:07.833,000 --> 0:06:1,000
sometimes I just had to shelter in place.

91
0:06:10.875,000 --> 0:06:11,000
You know what I mean?

92
0:06:12.208,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Kind of just stay at home till I get my mind right.

93
0:06:17.25,000 --> 0:06:19,000
But then I'd put my blinders back on,

94
0:06:20.25,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I'd get back out there,

95
0:06:22.75,000 --> 0:06:23,000
do my thing,

96
0:06:24.458,000 --> 0:06:25,000
but in the process of doing that,

97
0:06:26.417,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I developed this --

98
0:06:30.167,000 --> 0:06:32,000
angry, grumpy demeanor.

99
0:06:33.833,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Anger is an easy go-to,

100
0:06:35.625,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and people would leave me alone,

101
0:06:37.875,000 --> 0:06:39,000
but it just wasn't me.

102
0:06:41.417,000 --> 0:06:42,000
It wasn't me.

103
0:06:43,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I was allowing this disease to turn me into this angry, grumpy, spotted guy.

104
0:06:49.208,000 --> 0:06:5,000
It just wasn't me.

105
0:06:51.583,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So I had to change.

106
0:06:54.583,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I knew I could not change other people.

107
0:06:58.75,000 --> 0:07:,000
People are going to react and do what they gonna do.

108
0:07:02.708,000 --> 0:07:04,000
But there was a cold hard reality as well.

109
0:07:08.5,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I was the one

110
0:07:10.125,000 --> 0:07:14,000
that was showing anger, sadness

111
0:07:14.167,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and isolating myself.

112
0:07:16.125,000 --> 0:07:17,000
It was actually a choice.

113
0:07:19.25,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I was walking out the door every day

114
0:07:21.583,000 --> 0:07:25,000
expecting the world to react with negativity,

115
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
so I just gave them that mean face first.

116
0:07:30.958,000 --> 0:07:34,000
If I wanted change, the change had to start with me.

117
0:07:37.417,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So I came up with a plan.

118
0:07:41.667,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Two-parter, not that deep.

119
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Number one: I would just let people stare,

120
0:07:48.542,000 --> 0:07:5,000
drink it in, stare all you want,

121
0:07:51.292,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and not react.

122
0:07:53.375,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Because the truth is when I got this disease,

123
0:07:56.042,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I was all up in the mirror staring at every new spot

124
0:07:59.625,000 --> 0:08:01,000
trying to figure out what is going on.

125
0:08:02.292,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So I needed to let other people have that same opportunity

126
0:08:07.083,000 --> 0:08:09,000
to get that visual understanding.

127
0:08:11.25,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Number two:

128
0:08:14.625,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I would react with positivity,

129
0:08:18.125,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and that was simply a smile,

130
0:08:20.25,000 --> 0:08:22,000
or, at the very least,

131
0:08:22.417,000 --> 0:08:25,000
a nonjudgmental, kind face.

132
0:08:26.875,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Simple plan.

133
0:08:29.042,000 --> 0:08:31,000
But it turned out to be more difficult than I thought.

134
0:08:33.333,000 --> 0:08:34,000
But over time,

135
0:08:35.458,000 --> 0:08:36,000
things started to go OK.

136
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Like this one time, I'm at the store and this dude is like staring at me,

137
0:08:43.167,000 --> 0:08:45,000
like burning a hole in the side of my head.

138
0:08:45.25,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I'm shopping, he's staring at me,

139
0:08:46.875,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I'm going to the checkout, he's staring at me,

140
0:08:49.082,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I'm checking out, he's on the other line checking out, he's staring at me,

141
0:08:52.625,000 --> 0:08:54,000
we go to the exit, he's still staring at me,

142
0:08:54.75,000 --> 0:08:56,000
so I see he's staring

143
0:08:56.875,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and finally I turn to him and I go, "Hey buddy, what's up!"

144
0:08:59.75,000 --> 0:09:,000
And he goes ...

145
0:09:01.042,000 --> 0:09:02,000
(Mumbles nervously) "Hi!"

146
0:09:02.667,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Laughter)

147
0:09:03.708,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Awkward.

148
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So to relieve the tension, I say,

149
0:09:08.542,000 --> 0:09:09,000
"It's just a skin disorder.

150
0:09:10.333,000 --> 0:09:12,000
It's not contagious, it's not life-threatening,

151
0:09:12.583,000 --> 0:09:14,000
it just makes me look a little different."

152
0:09:14.667,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I end up talking to that guy for like five minutes.

153
0:09:17.333,000 --> 0:09:19,000
It was kind of cool, right?

154
0:09:19.75,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And at the end of our conversation, he says,

155
0:09:23.833,000 --> 0:09:25,000
"You know, if you didn't have 'vitilargo'" --

156
0:09:26.75,000 --> 0:09:29,000
it's actually vitiligo, but he was trying, so --

157
0:09:29.833,000 --> 0:09:3,000
(Laughter)

158
0:09:31.333,000 --> 0:09:34,000
"if you didn't have vitilargo, you'd look just like that guy on TV."

159
0:09:35.042,000 --> 0:09:36,000
(Laughter)

160
0:09:36.333,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And I was like, "Haha, yeah, I get that, I get that, yeah."

161
0:09:40.458,000 --> 0:09:41,000
(Laughter)

162
0:09:41.958,000 --> 0:09:42,000
So things were going OK.

163
0:09:45.208,000 --> 0:09:47,000
I was having more good exchanges than bad,

164
0:09:49.542,000 --> 0:09:52,000
until that day.

165
0:09:54.792,000 --> 0:09:55,000
I had a little time before work

166
0:09:56.333,000 --> 0:09:58,000
so I like to stop by the park to watch the kids play.

167
0:09:58.875,000 --> 0:09:59,000
They're funny.

168
0:10:00.167,000 --> 0:10:03,000
So I got a little too close, this little girl wasn't paying attention,

169
0:10:03.5,000 --> 0:10:04,000
she's about two or three years old,

170
0:10:05.25,000 --> 0:10:08,000
she's running, she runs directly into my leg and falls down, pretty hard.

171
0:10:08.708,000 --> 0:10:09,000
I thought she hurt herself,

172
0:10:10.083,000 --> 0:10:12,000
so I reach out to try and help the little girl

173
0:10:12.5,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and she looks at my vitiligo

174
0:10:14.167,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and she screams!

175
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Now kids are pure honesty.

176
0:10:28.167,000 --> 0:10:29,000
She's like two or three.

177
0:10:30.125,000 --> 0:10:34,000
This little girl, she wasn't trying to be mean.

178
0:10:34.208,000 --> 0:10:36,000
She didn't have any malice in her heart.

179
0:10:36.708,000 --> 0:10:37,000
This little girl was afraid.

180
0:10:39.875,000 --> 0:10:4,000
She was just afraid.

181
0:10:44.75,000 --> 0:10:45,000
I didn't know what to do.

182
0:10:46.083,000 --> 0:10:48,000
I just took a step back and put my hands by my side.

183
0:10:52.75,000 --> 0:10:56,000
I stayed in the house for two weeks and three days on that one.

184
0:10:59.458,000 --> 0:11:02,000
It took me a second to get my mind around the fact

185
0:11:02.708,000 --> 0:11:04,000
that I scare small children.

186
0:11:06.583,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And that was something that I could not smile away.

187
0:11:15.125,000 --> 0:11:16,000
But I jumped back on my plan

188
0:11:19.875,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and just put on my blinders,

189
0:11:23.542,000 --> 0:11:24,000
started going back out.

190
0:11:26.25,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Two months later, I'm in a grocery store reaching on the bottom shelf,

191
0:11:29.583,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and I hear a little voice go, "You've got a boo-boo?"

192
0:11:33.583,000 --> 0:11:36,000
It's like a two-year-old, three-year-old, same age, little girl,

193
0:11:37.292,000 --> 0:11:38,000
but she's not crying,

194
0:11:39.875,000 --> 0:11:41,000
so I kneel down in front of her

195
0:11:42.792,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and I don't speak two-year-old so I look up at the mom,

196
0:11:45.417,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and I say, "What did she say?"

197
0:11:46.917,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And she says, "She thinks you have a boo-boo."

198
0:11:49.625,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So I go, "No, I don't have a boo-boo, no, not at all."

199
0:11:53.083,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And the little girl says,

200
0:11:54.875,000 --> 0:11:55,000
"Duh-duh-hoy?"

201
0:11:57.167,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And so I look to mom for the translation,

202
0:11:59.625,000 --> 0:12:,000
and she says,

203
0:12:01,000 --> 0:12:02,000
"She thinks you're hurt."

204
0:12:03.542,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And I say, "No, sweetie, I'm not hurt at all, I'm fine."

205
0:12:08.083,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And the little girl reaches out with that little hand

206
0:12:11.375,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and touches my face.

207
0:12:13.708,000 --> 0:12:15,000
She's trying to rub the chocolate into the vanilla

208
0:12:16.125,000 --> 0:12:17,000
or whatever she was doing.

209
0:12:17.458,000 --> 0:12:18,000
It was amazing!

210
0:12:19.667,000 --> 0:12:2,000
It was awesome.

211
0:12:21.875,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Because she thought she knew what it was,

212
0:12:23.958,000 --> 0:12:24,000
she was giving me everything I wanted:

213
0:12:25.958,000 --> 0:12:27,000
kindness, compassion.

214
0:12:28.708,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And with the touch of that little hand,

215
0:12:31.792,000 --> 0:12:34,000
she healed a grown man's pain.

216
0:12:35.25,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Yee-ha.

217
0:12:37.833,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Healed.

218
0:12:42.333,000 --> 0:12:44,000
I smiled for a long time on that one.

219
0:12:47.708,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Positivity is something worth fighting for,

220
0:12:52.958,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and the fight is not with others --

221
0:12:55.958,000 --> 0:12:56,000
it's internal.

222
0:12:58.458,000 --> 0:13:01,000
If you want to make positive changes in your life,

223
0:13:03.625,000 --> 0:13:07,000
you have to consistently be positive.

224
0:13:13.167,000 --> 0:13:15,000
My blood type is actually B positive.

225
0:13:15.5,000 --> 0:13:18,000
(Laughter)

226
0:13:18.875,000 --> 0:13:2,000
I know, corny TV guy dad joke,

227
0:13:21.292,000 --> 0:13:22,000
my daughter hates it, but I don't care!

228
0:13:23.292,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Be positive!

229
0:13:25.042,000 --> 0:13:27,000
(Laughs)

230
0:13:32.583,000 --> 0:13:34,000
A 14-year-old boy years ago --

231
0:13:35.25,000 --> 0:13:37,000
this kid had vitiligo --

232
0:13:37.333,000 --> 0:13:4,000
he asked me to show my face on television.

233
0:13:41.292,000 --> 0:13:42,000
I wasn't going to do it,

234
0:13:42.75,000 --> 0:13:44,000
we've been over this, I thought I was going to lose my job,

235
0:13:45.583,000 --> 0:13:47,000
but the kid convinced me by saying,

236
0:13:48.875,000 --> 0:13:52,000
"If you show people what you look like and explain this to them,

237
0:13:53.25,000 --> 0:13:55,000
maybe they will treat me differently."

238
0:13:56.458,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Boom! Blinders off.

239
0:13:59.833,000 --> 0:14:01,000
I did a TV report,

240
0:14:02.208,000 --> 0:14:04,000
got an overwhelming response.

241
0:14:05.375,000 --> 0:14:06,000
So I didn't know what to do.

242
0:14:06.958,000 --> 0:14:08,000
I took the attention and focused it back on the kid

243
0:14:09.708,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and other people that have vitiligo.

244
0:14:12.417,000 --> 0:14:13,000
I started a support group.

245
0:14:15.125,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Pretty soon, we noticed "VITFriends"

246
0:14:18.083,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and "V-Strong" support groups all over the country.

247
0:14:24.333,000 --> 0:14:29,000
In 2016, we all came together and celebrated World Vitiligo Day.

248
0:14:32.833,000 --> 0:14:34,000
This past June 25,

249
0:14:35.083,000 --> 0:14:37,000
we had over 300 people,

250
0:14:38,000 --> 0:14:42,000
all in celebration of our annual event.

251
0:14:42.917,000 --> 0:14:43,000
It was amazing.

252
0:14:44.792,000 --> 0:14:45,000
(Applause)

253
0:14:46.375,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Thanks.

254
0:14:52.208,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Now, I'm not going to lie to you

255
0:14:54.792,000 --> 0:14:56,000
and say it was quick or easy

256
0:14:57.792,000 --> 0:15:01,000
for me to find a positive place living with this disease,

257
0:15:03.417,000 --> 0:15:04,000
but I found it.

258
0:15:06.708,000 --> 0:15:07,000
But I also got much more.

259
0:15:10.083,000 --> 0:15:12,000
I became a better man,

260
0:15:13.042,000 --> 0:15:15,000
the man I always wanted to be,

261
0:15:15.333,000 --> 0:15:2,000
the kind of guy who can stand up in front of a room full of strangers

262
0:15:21.042,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and tell some of the toughest stories in his life

263
0:15:25.625,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and end it all with a smile,

264
0:15:29.458,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and find happiness in the fact that you all just smiled back.

265
0:15:35.25,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Thank you.

266
0:15:36.542,000 --> 0:15:38,000
(Applause)

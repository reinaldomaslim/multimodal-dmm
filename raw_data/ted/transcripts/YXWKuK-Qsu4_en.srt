1
0:00:12.975,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Today 40 million Americans are indebted for their passage to the new economy.

2
0:00:20.039,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Too poor to pay their way through college,

3
0:00:22.167,000 --> 0:00:26,000
they now owe lenders more than one trillion US dollars.

4
0:00:27.709,000 --> 0:00:29,000
They do find what jobs they can get

5
0:00:29.972,000 --> 0:00:31,000
to pay off a debt that is secured on their person.

6
0:00:33.201,000 --> 0:00:35,000
In America,

7
0:00:35.273,000 --> 0:00:4,000
even a bankrupt gambler gets a second chance.

8
0:00:42.351,000 --> 0:00:44,000
But it is nearly impossible

9
0:00:45.177,000 --> 0:00:48,000
for an American to get discharged their student loan debts.

10
0:00:52.421,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Once upon a time in America,

11
0:00:55.165,000 --> 0:00:57,000
going to college did not mean graduating with debt.

12
0:00:59.299,000 --> 0:01:04,000
My friend Paul's father graduated from Colorado State University

13
0:01:04.609,000 --> 0:01:05,000
on the GI Bill.

14
0:01:07.546,000 --> 0:01:08,000
For his generation,

15
0:01:09.158,000 --> 0:01:11,000
higher education was free or almost free,

16
0:01:12.03,000 --> 0:01:14,000
because it was thought of as a public good.

17
0:01:15.676,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Not anymore.

18
0:01:18.171,000 --> 0:01:22,000
When Paul also graduated from Colorado State University,

19
0:01:22.291,000 --> 0:01:25,000
he paid for his English degree by working part-time.

20
0:01:26.164,000 --> 0:01:27,000
30 years ago,

21
0:01:27.339,000 --> 0:01:29,000
higher education tuition was affordable, reasonable,

22
0:01:30.03,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and what debts you accumulated, you paid off by graduation date.

23
0:01:33.952,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Not anymore.

24
0:01:35.829,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Paul's daughter followed in his footsteps,

25
0:01:39.227,000 --> 0:01:4,000
but with one difference:

26
0:01:40.552,000 --> 0:01:42,000
when she graduated five years ago,

27
0:01:43.068,000 --> 0:01:44,000
it was with a whopping debt.

28
0:01:45.179,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Students like Kate have to take on a loan

29
0:01:48.545,000 --> 0:01:51,000
because the cost of higher education has become unaffordable

30
0:01:51.768,000 --> 0:01:54,000
for many if not most American families.

31
0:01:56.427,000 --> 0:01:57,000
But so what?

32
0:01:58.117,000 --> 0:02:,000
Getting into debt to buy an expensive education

33
0:02:00.689,000 --> 0:02:02,000
is not all bad if you could pay it off

34
0:02:03.475,000 --> 0:02:06,000
with the increased income that you earned from it.

35
0:02:07.266,000 --> 0:02:09,000
But that's where the rubber meets the road.

36
0:02:11.652,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Even a college grad earned 10 percent more in 2001

37
0:02:17.272,000 --> 0:02:18,000
than she did in 2013.

38
0:02:19.984,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So ...

39
0:02:21.779,000 --> 0:02:22,000
tuition costs up,

40
0:02:23.462,000 --> 0:02:24,000
public funding down,

41
0:02:25.009,000 --> 0:02:27,000
family incomes diminished,

42
0:02:27.47,000 --> 0:02:29,000
personal incomes weak.

43
0:02:30.241,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Is it any wonder that more than a quarter of those who must

44
0:02:34.67,000 --> 0:02:36,000
cannot make their student loan payments?

45
0:02:38.852,000 --> 0:02:4,000
The worst of times can be the best of times,

46
0:02:41.853,000 --> 0:02:44,000
because certain truths flash up in ways that you can't ignore.

47
0:02:46.446,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I want to speak of three of them today.

48
0:02:49.571,000 --> 0:02:52,000
1.2 trillion dollars of debts for diplomas

49
0:02:53.469,000 --> 0:02:55,000
make it abundantly obvious

50
0:02:55.958,000 --> 0:02:58,000
that higher education is a consumer product you can buy.

51
0:03:00.283,000 --> 0:03:04,000
All of us talk about education just as the economists do now,

52
0:03:05.125,000 --> 0:03:09,000
as an investment that you make to improve the human stock

53
0:03:09.63,000 --> 0:03:1,000
by training them for work.

54
0:03:11.812,000 --> 0:03:15,000
As an investment you make to sort and classify people

55
0:03:16.559,000 --> 0:03:18,000
so that employers can hire them more easily.

56
0:03:20.396,000 --> 0:03:23,000
The U.S. News & World Report ranks colleges

57
0:03:23.818,000 --> 0:03:26,000
just as the consumer report rates washing machines.

58
0:03:27.095,000 --> 0:03:3,000
The language is peppered with barbarisms.

59
0:03:30.882,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Teachers are called "service providers,"

60
0:03:34.287,000 --> 0:03:35,000
students are called "consumers."

61
0:03:37.509,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Sociology and Shakespeare and soccer and science,

62
0:03:41.414,000 --> 0:03:42,000
all of these are "content."

63
0:03:45.318,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Student debt is profitable.

64
0:03:46.723,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Only not on you.

65
0:03:49.961,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Your debt fattens the profit of the student loan industry.

66
0:03:54.04,000 --> 0:03:56,000
The two 800-pound gorillas of which --

67
0:03:56.501,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Sallie Mae and Navient --

68
0:03:58.588,000 --> 0:04:03,000
posted last year a combined profit of 1.2 billion dollars.

69
0:04:04.568,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And just like home mortgages,

70
0:04:07.164,000 --> 0:04:1,000
student loans can be bundled and packaged and sliced and diced,

71
0:04:10.374,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and sold on Wall Street.

72
0:04:12.369,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And colleges and universities

73
0:04:13.989,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that invest in these securitized loans

74
0:04:18.17,000 --> 0:04:19,000
profit twice.

75
0:04:19.735,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Once from your tuition,

76
0:04:21.18,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and then again from the interest on debt.

77
0:04:25.108,000 --> 0:04:27,000
With all that money to be made,

78
0:04:27.498,000 --> 0:04:32,000
are we surprised that some in the higher education business

79
0:04:33.109,000 --> 0:04:35,000
have begun to engage in false advertising,

80
0:04:35.205,000 --> 0:04:36,000
in bait and switch ...

81
0:04:38.585,000 --> 0:04:42,000
in exploiting the very ignorance that they pretend to educate?

82
0:04:44.144,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Third:

83
0:04:45.678,000 --> 0:04:46,000
diplomas are a brand.

84
0:04:47.741,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Many years ago my teacher wrote,

85
0:04:50.116,000 --> 0:04:52,000
"When students are treated as consumers,

86
0:04:52.681,000 --> 0:04:55,000
they're made prisoners of addiction and envy."

87
0:04:59.794,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Just as consumers can be sold and resold upgraded versions of an iPhone,

88
0:05:04.359,000 --> 0:05:06,000
so also people can be sold more and more education.

89
0:05:08.807,000 --> 0:05:09,000
College is the new high school,

90
0:05:10.697,000 --> 0:05:11,000
we already say that.

91
0:05:13.408,000 --> 0:05:14,000
But why stop there?

92
0:05:14.831,000 --> 0:05:17,000
People can be upsold on certifications and recertifications,

93
0:05:18.332,000 --> 0:05:2,000
master's degrees, doctoral degrees.

94
0:05:23.436,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Higher education is also marketed as a status object.

95
0:05:28.634,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Buy a degree,

96
0:05:29.809,000 --> 0:05:32,000
much like you do a Lexus of a Louis Vuitton bag,

97
0:05:33.02,000 --> 0:05:34,000
to distinguish yourself from others.

98
0:05:34.838,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So you can be the object of envy of others.

99
0:05:38.669,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Diplomas are a brand.

100
0:05:41.034,000 --> 0:05:47,000
But these truths are often times hidden by a very noisy sales pitch.

101
0:05:48.535,000 --> 0:05:49,000
There is not a day that goes by

102
0:05:50.195,000 --> 0:05:55,000
without some policy guy on television telling us,

103
0:05:55.256,000 --> 0:05:57,000
"A college degree is absolutely essential

104
0:05:57.304,000 --> 0:05:59,000
to get on that up escalator to a middle-class life."

105
0:06:00.89,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And the usual evidence offered is the college premium:

106
0:06:04.592,000 --> 0:06:09,000
a college grad who makes on average 56 percent more than a high school grad.

107
0:06:10.425,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Let's look at that number more carefully,

108
0:06:12.497,000 --> 0:06:13,000
because on the face of it,

109
0:06:13.847,000 --> 0:06:16,000
it seems to belie the stories we all hear

110
0:06:17.215,000 --> 0:06:21,000
about college grads working as baristas and cashiers.

111
0:06:22.545,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Of 100 people who enroll in any form of post-secondary education,

112
0:06:27.72,000 --> 0:06:3,000
45 do not complete it in a timely fashion,

113
0:06:30.792,000 --> 0:06:33,000
for a number of reasons, including financial.

114
0:06:34.275,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Of the 55 that do graduate,

115
0:06:36.212,000 --> 0:06:38,000
two will remain unemployed,

116
0:06:38.284,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and another 18 are underemployed.

117
0:06:42.058,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So, college grads earn more than high school grads,

118
0:06:45.757,000 --> 0:06:47,000
but does it pay for the exorbitant tuition

119
0:06:48.774,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and the lost wages while at college?

120
0:06:51.661,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Now even economists admit

121
0:06:54.281,000 --> 0:06:59,000
going to college pays off for only those who complete it.

122
0:07:00.095,000 --> 0:07:04,000
But that's only because high school wages have been cut to the bone,

123
0:07:04.151,000 --> 0:07:05,000
for decades now.

124
0:07:07.369,000 --> 0:07:08,000
For decades,

125
0:07:09.282,000 --> 0:07:11,000
workers with a high school degree

126
0:07:11.663,000 --> 0:07:15,000
have been denied a fair share of what they have produced.

127
0:07:16.48,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And had they received as they should have,

128
0:07:19.409,000 --> 0:07:22,000
then going to college would have been a bad investment for many.

129
0:07:23.386,000 --> 0:07:25,000
College premium?

130
0:07:25.941,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I think it's a high school discount.

131
0:07:28.688,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Two out of three people who enroll are not going to find an adequate job.

132
0:07:33.756,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And the future, for them, doesn't look particularly promising --

133
0:07:36.891,000 --> 0:07:37,000
in fact, it's downright bleak.

134
0:07:38.637,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And it is they who are going to suffer

135
0:07:42.541,000 --> 0:07:44,000
the most punishing forms of student debt.

136
0:07:46.002,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And it is they,

137
0:07:47.177,000 --> 0:07:48,000
curiously and sadly,

138
0:07:48.582,000 --> 0:07:51,000
who are marketed most loudly about this college premium thing.

139
0:07:53.986,000 --> 0:07:55,000
That's not just cynical marketing,

140
0:07:56.407,000 --> 0:07:57,000
that's cruel.

141
0:07:59.277,000 --> 0:08:,000
So what do we do?

142
0:08:01.279,000 --> 0:08:06,000
What if students and parents treated higher education as a consumer product?

143
0:08:08.199,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Everybody else seems to.

144
0:08:10.686,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Then, like any other consumer product,

145
0:08:12.972,000 --> 0:08:14,000
you would demand to know what you're paying for.

146
0:08:15.495,000 --> 0:08:16,000
When you buy medicines,

147
0:08:16.734,000 --> 0:08:17,000
you get a list of side effects.

148
0:08:18.673,000 --> 0:08:2,000
When you buy a higher educational product,

149
0:08:20.809,000 --> 0:08:21,000
you should have a warning label

150
0:08:22.467,000 --> 0:08:24,000
that allows consumers to choose,

151
0:08:24.683,000 --> 0:08:25,000
make informed choices.

152
0:08:26.838,000 --> 0:08:27,000
When you buy a car,

153
0:08:28.054,000 --> 0:08:3,000
it tells you how many miles per gallon to expect.

154
0:08:31.188,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Who knows what to expect

155
0:08:32.658,000 --> 0:08:35,000
from a degree say, in Canadian Studies.

156
0:08:36.806,000 --> 0:08:37,000
There is such a thing, by the way.

157
0:08:40.989,000 --> 0:08:42,000
What if there was an app for that?

158
0:08:46.402,000 --> 0:08:5,000
One that linked up the cost of a major to the expected income.

159
0:08:52.208,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Let's call it Income-Based Tuition or IBT.

160
0:08:54.598,000 --> 0:08:55,000
One of you make this.

161
0:08:56.144,000 --> 0:08:57,000
(Laughter)

162
0:08:57.707,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Discover your reality.

163
0:08:59.463,000 --> 0:09:01,000
(Laughter)

164
0:09:01.796,000 --> 0:09:02,000
There are three advantages,

165
0:09:03.249,000 --> 0:09:05,000
three benefits to Income-Based Tuition.

166
0:09:07.232,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Any user can figure out

167
0:09:09.145,000 --> 0:09:12,000
how much money he or she will make from a given college and major.

168
0:09:13.105,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Such informed users

169
0:09:14.471,000 --> 0:09:17,000
are unlikely to fall victim to the huckster's ploy,

170
0:09:18.44,000 --> 0:09:19,000
to the sales pitch.

171
0:09:19.874,000 --> 0:09:2,000
But also to choose wisely.

172
0:09:21.604,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Why would anybody pay more for college

173
0:09:24.03,000 --> 0:09:27,000
than let's say, 15 percent of the additional income they earn?

174
0:09:29.04,000 --> 0:09:31,000
There's a second benefit to Income-Based Tuition.

175
0:09:31.78,000 --> 0:09:33,000
By tying the cost to the income,

176
0:09:34.764,000 --> 0:09:38,000
college administrators would be forced to manage costs better,

177
0:09:39.209,000 --> 0:09:41,000
to find innovative ways to do so.

178
0:09:41.573,000 --> 0:09:42,000
For instance,

179
0:09:42.751,000 --> 0:09:46,000
all of you students here pay roughly the same tuition for every major.

180
0:09:47.478,000 --> 0:09:51,000
That is manifestly unfair, and should change.

181
0:09:52.295,000 --> 0:09:55,000
An engineering student uses more resources

182
0:09:56.24,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and facilities and labs and faculty

183
0:09:58.673,000 --> 0:09:59,000
than a philosophy student.

184
0:10:01.581,000 --> 0:10:03,000
But the philosophy student, as a consequence,

185
0:10:03.709,000 --> 0:10:05,000
is subsidizing the engineering student.

186
0:10:06.3,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Who then, by the way, goes on and earns more money.

187
0:10:09.015,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Why should two people buy the same product,

188
0:10:12.746,000 --> 0:10:13,000
pay the same,

189
0:10:13.945,000 --> 0:10:15,000
but one person receive half or a third of the service.

190
0:10:18.448,000 --> 0:10:22,000
In fact, college grads, some majors,

191
0:10:22.543,000 --> 0:10:25,000
pay 25 percent of their income servicing their student debt,

192
0:10:26.187,000 --> 0:10:27,000
while others pay five percent.

193
0:10:29.51,000 --> 0:10:33,000
That kind if inequity would end when majors are priced more correctly.

194
0:10:35.042,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Now of course, all this data --

195
0:10:37.225,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and one of you is going to do this, right?

196
0:10:39.323,000 --> 0:10:4,000
All this data has to be well designed,

197
0:10:41.194,000 --> 0:10:43,000
maybe audited by public accounting firms

198
0:10:43.316,000 --> 0:10:44,000
to avoid statistical lies.

199
0:10:45.292,000 --> 0:10:46,000
We know about statistics, right?

200
0:10:48.766,000 --> 0:10:49,000
But be that as it may,

201
0:10:50.013,000 --> 0:10:54,000
the third and biggest benefit of Income-Based Tuition,

202
0:10:54.418,000 --> 0:10:59,000
is it would free Americans from the fear and the fact of financial ruin

203
0:10:59.871,000 --> 0:11:01,000
because they bought a defective product.

204
0:11:02.813,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Perhaps, in time,

205
0:11:05.156,000 --> 0:11:07,000
young and old Americans may rediscover,

206
0:11:07.428,000 --> 0:11:09,000
as the gentleman said earlier,

207
0:11:09.649,000 --> 0:11:11,000
their curiosity, their love of learning --

208
0:11:11.712,000 --> 0:11:12,000
begin to study what they love,

209
0:11:13.173,000 --> 0:11:14,000
love what they study,

210
0:11:14.376,000 --> 0:11:15,000
follow their passion ...

211
0:11:16.577,000 --> 0:11:18,000
getting stimulated by their intelligence,

212
0:11:19.07,000 --> 0:11:22,000
follow paths of inquiry that they really want to.

213
0:11:22.848,000 --> 0:11:26,000
After all, it was Eric and Kevin,

214
0:11:27.322,000 --> 0:11:28,000
two years ago,

215
0:11:29.498,000 --> 0:11:32,000
just exactly these kinds of young men,

216
0:11:32.954,000 --> 0:11:34,000
who prompted me and worked with me,

217
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and still do,

218
0:11:36.585,000 --> 0:11:39,000
in the study of indebted students in America.

219
0:11:41.272,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Thank you for your attention.

220
0:11:42.827,000 --> 0:11:46,000
(Applause)

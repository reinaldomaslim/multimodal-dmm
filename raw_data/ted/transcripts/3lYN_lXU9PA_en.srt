1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
So, I want to start out with

2
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
this beautiful picture from my childhood.

3
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I love the science fiction movies.

4
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Here it is: "This Island Earth."

5
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And leave it to Hollywood to get it just right.

6
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Two-and-a-half years in the making.

7
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I mean, even the creationists give us 6,000,

9
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but Hollywood goes to the chase.

10
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And in this movie, we see what we think is out there:

11
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
flying saucers and aliens.

12
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Every world has an alien, and every alien world has a flying saucer,

13
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and they move about with great speed. Aliens.

14
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Well, Don Brownlee, my friend, and I finally got to the point

15
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
where we got tired of turning on the TV

16
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and seeing the spaceships and seeing the aliens every night,

17
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and tried to write a counter-argument to it,

18
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and put out what does it really take for an Earth to be habitable,

19
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
for a planet to be an Earth, to have a place

20
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
where you could probably get not just life, but complexity,

21
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
which requires a huge amount of evolution,

22
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and therefore constancy of conditions.

23
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So, in 2000 we wrote "Rare Earth." In 2003, we then asked,

24
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
let's not think about where Earths are in space, but how long has Earth been Earth?

25
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
If you go back two billion years,

26
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
you're not on an Earth-like planet any more.

27
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
What we call an Earth-like planet is actually a very short interval of time.

28
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Well, "Rare Earth" actually

29
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
taught me an awful lot about meeting the public.

30
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Right after, I got an invitation to go to a science fiction convention,

31
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and with all great earnestness walked in.

32
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
David Brin was going to debate me on this,

33
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and as I walked in, the crowd of a hundred started booing lustily.

34
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I had a girl who came up who said, "My dad says you're the devil."

35
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
You cannot take people's aliens away from them

36
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and expect to be anybody's friends.

37
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Well, the second part of that, soon after --

38
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and I was talking to Paul Allen; I saw him in the audience,

39
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and I handed him a copy of "Rare Earth."

40
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And Jill Tarter was there, and she turned to me,

41
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and she looked at me just like that girl in "The Exorcist."

42
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
It was, "It burns! It burns!"

43
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Because SETI doesn't want to hear this.

44
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
SETI wants there to be stuff out there.

45
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I really applaud the SETI efforts, but we have not heard anything yet.

46
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And I really do think we have to start thinking

47
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
about what's a good planet and what isn't.

48
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Now, I throw this slide up because it indicates to me that,

49
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
even if SETI does hear something, can we figure out what they said?

50
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Because this was a slide that was passed

51
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
between the two major intelligences on Earth -- a Mac to a PC --

52
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and it can't even get the letters right --

53
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
-- so how are we going to talk to the aliens?

55
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And if they're 50 light years away, and we call them up,

56
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and you blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

57
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
and then 50 years later it comes back and they say, Please repeat?

58
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I mean, there we are.

59
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Our planet is a good planet because it can keep water.

60
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Mars is a bad planet, but it's still good enough for us to go there

61
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and to live on its surface if we're protected.

62
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
But Venus is a very bad -- the worst -- planet.

63
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Even though it's Earth-like, and even though early in its history

64
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
it may very well have harbored Earth-like life,

65
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
it soon succumbed to runaway greenhouse --

66
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that's an 800 degrees [Fahrenheit] surface --

67
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
because of rampant carbon dioxide.

68
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Well, we know from astrobiology that we can really now predict

69
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
what's going to happen to our particular planet.

70
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
We are right now in the beautiful Oreo

71
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
of existence -- of at least life on Planet Earth --

72
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
following the first horrible microbial age.

73
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
In the Cambrian explosion, life emerged from the swamps,

74
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
complexity arose,

75
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and from what we can tell, we're halfway through.

76
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
We have as much time for animals to exist on this planet

77
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
as they have been here now,

78
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
till we hit the second microbial age.

79
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
And that will happen, paradoxically --

80
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
everything you hear about global warming --

81
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
when we hit CO2 down to 10 parts per million,

82
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
we are no longer going to have to have plants

83
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that are allowed to have any photosynthesis, and there go animals.

84
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So, after that we probably have seven billion years.

85
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
The Sun increases in its intensity, in its brightness,

86
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and finally, at about 12 billion years after it first started,

87
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
the Earth is consumed by a large Sun,

88
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and this is what's left.

89
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So, a planet like us is going to have an age and an old age,

90
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and we are in its golden summer age right now.

91
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
But there's two fates to everything, isn't there?

92
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Now, a lot of you are going to die of old age,

93
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
but some of you, horribly enough, are going to die in an accident.

94
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And that's the fate of a planet, too.

95
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Earth, if we're lucky enough -- if it doesn't get hit by a Hale-Bopp,

96
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
or gets blasted by some supernova nearby

97
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
in the next seven billion years -- we'll find under your feet.

98
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
But what about accidental death?

99
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
Well, paleontologists for the last 200 years

100
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
have been charting death. It's strange --

101
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
extinction as a concept wasn't even thought about

102
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
until Baron Cuvier in France found this first mastodon.

103
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
He couldn't match it up to any bones on the planet,

104
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and he said, Aha! It's extinct.

105
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And very soon after, the fossil record started yielding

106
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
a very good idea of how many plants and animals there have been

107
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
since complex life really began to leave

108
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
a very interesting fossil record.

109
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
In that complex record of fossils,

110
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
there were times when lots of stuff

111
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
seemed to be dying out very quickly,

112
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and the father/mother geologists

113
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
called these "mass extinctions."

114
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
All along it was thought to be either an act of God

115
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
or perhaps long, slow climate change,

116
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and that really changed in 1980,

117
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
in this rocky outcrop near Gubbio,

118
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
where Walter Alvarez, trying to figure out

119
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
what was the time difference between these white rocks,

120
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
which held creatures of the Cretaceous period,

121
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and the pink rocks above, which held Tertiary fossils.

122
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
How long did it take to go from one system to the next?

123
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And what they found was something unexpected.

124
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
They found in this gap, in between, a very thin clay layer,

125
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and that clay layer -- this very thin red layer here --

126
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
is filled with iridium.

127
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And not just iridium; it's filled with glassy spherules,

128
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and it's filled with quartz grains

129
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
that have been subjected to enormous pressure: shock quartz.

130
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Now, in this slide the white is chalk,

131
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and this chalk was deposited in a warm ocean.

132
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
The chalk itself's composed by plankton

133
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
which has fallen down from the sea surface onto the sea floor,

134
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
so that 90 percent of the sediment here is skeleton of living stuff,

135
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and then you have that millimeter-thick red layer,

136
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and then you have black rock.

137
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And the black rock is the sediment on the sea bottom

138
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
in the absence of plankton.

139
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And that's what happens in an asteroid catastrophe,

140
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:46,000
because that's what this was, of course. This is the famous K-T.

141
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
A 10-kilometer body hit the planet.

142
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
The effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet,

143
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and we had very quickly the death of the dinosaurs,

144
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
the death of these beautiful ammonites,

145
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Leconteiceras here, and Celaeceras over here,

146
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and so much else.

147
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I mean, it must be true,

148
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
because we've had two Hollywood blockbusters since that time,

149
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and this paradigm, from 1980 to about 2000,

150
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
totally changed how we geologists thought about catastrophes.

151
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Prior to that, uniformitarianism was the dominant paradigm:

152
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
the fact that if anything happens on the planet in the past,

153
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
there are present-day processes that will explain it.

154
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
But we haven't witnessed a big asteroid impact,

155
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
so this is a type of neo-catastrophism,

156
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and it took about 20 years for the scientific establishment

157
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
to finally come to grips: yes, we were hit;

158
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and yes, the effects of that hit caused a major mass extinction.

159
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Well, there are five major mass extinctions

160
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
over the last 500 million years, called the Big Five.

161
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
They range from 450 million years ago

162
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
to the last, the K-T, number four,

163
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
but the biggest of all was the P, or the Permian extinction,

164
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
sometimes called the mother of all mass extinctions.

165
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And every one of these has been subsequently blamed

166
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
on large-body impact.

167
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
But is this true?

168
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
The most recent, the Permian, was thought to have been an impact

169
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
because of this beautiful structure on the right.

170
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
This is a Buckminsterfullerene, a carbon-60.

171
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Because it looks like those terrible geodesic domes

172
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
of my late beloved '60s,

173
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
they're called "buckyballs."

174
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
This evidence was used to suggest

175
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
that at the end of the Permian, 250 million years ago, a comet hit us.

176
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And when the comet hits, the pressure produces the buckyballs,

177
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and it captures bits of the comet.

178
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Helium-3: very rare on the surface of the Earth, very common in space.

179
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
But is this true?

180
0:08:36.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
In 1990, working on the K-T extinction for 10 years,

181
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
I moved to South Africa to begin work twice a year

182
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
in the great Karoo desert.

183
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I was so lucky to watch the change of that South Africa

184
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
into the new South Africa as I went year by year.

185
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And I worked on this Permian extinction,

186
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
camping by this Boer graveyard for months at a time.

187
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And the fossils are extraordinary.

188
0:08:59.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
You know, you're gazing upon your very distant ancestors.

189
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
These are mammal-like reptiles.

190
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
They are culturally invisible. We do not make movies about these.

191
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
This is a Gorgonopsian, or a Gorgon.

192
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
That's an 18-inch long skull of an animal

193
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that was probably seven or eight feet, sprawled like a lizard,

194
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
probably had a head like a lion.

195
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
This is the top carnivore, the T-Rex of its time.

196
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
But there's lots of stuff.

197
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
This is my poor son, Patrick.

198
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
(Laughter)

199
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
This is called paleontological child abuse.

200
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Hold still, you're the scale.

201
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
(Laughter)

202
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
There was big stuff back then.

203
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Fifty-five species of mammal-like reptiles.

204
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
The age of mammals had well and truly started

205
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
250 million years ago ...

206
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
... and then a catastrophe happened.

207
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And what happens next is the age of dinosaurs.

208
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
It was all a mistake; it should have never happened. But it did.

209
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Now, luckily,

210
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
this Thrinaxodon, the size of a robin egg here:

211
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
this is a skull I've discovered just before taking this picture --

212
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
there's a pen for scale; it's really tiny --

213
0:10:06.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
this is in the Lower Triassic, after the mass extinction has finished.

214
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
You can see the eye socket and you can see the little teeth in the front.

215
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
If that does not survive, I'm not the thing giving this talk.

216
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Something else is, because if that doesn't survive, we are not here;

217
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
there are no mammals. It's that close; one species ekes through.

218
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Well, can we say anything about the pattern of who survives and who doesn't?

219
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Here's sort of the end of that 10 years of work.

220
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
The ranges of stuff -- the red line is the mass extinction.

221
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
But we've got survivors and things that get through,

222
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and it turns out the things that get through preferentially are cold bloods.

223
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Warm-blooded animals take a huge hit at this time.

224
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
The survivors that do get through

225
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:5,000
produce this world of crocodile-like creatures.

226
0:10:50.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
There's no dinosaurs yet; just this slow, saurian, scaly, nasty,

227
0:10:54.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
swampy place with a couple of tiny mammals hiding in the fringes.

228
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And there they would hide for 160 million years,

229
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
until liberated by that K-T asteroid.

230
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
So, if not impact, what?

231
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And the what, I think, is that we returned, over and over again,

232
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
to the Pre-Cambrian world, that first microbial age,

233
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and the microbes are still out there.

234
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
They hate we animals.

235
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
They really want their world back.

236
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And they've tried over and over and over again.

237
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
This suggests to me that life causing these mass extinctions

238
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:3,000
because it did is inherently anti-Gaian.

239
0:11:30.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
This whole Gaia idea, that life makes the world better for itself --

240
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
anybody been on a freeway on a Friday afternoon in Los Angeles

241
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
believing in the Gaia theory? No.

242
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
So, I really suspect there's an alternative,

243
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and that life does actually try to do itself in --

244
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
not consciously, but just because it does.

245
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And here's the weapon, it seems, that it did so over the last 500 million years.

246
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
There are microbes which, through their metabolism,

247
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
produce hydrogen sulfide,

248
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
and they do so in large amounts.

249
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Hydrogen sulfide is very fatal to we humans.

250
0:12:03.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
As small as 200 parts per million will kill you.

251
0:12:09.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
You only have to go to the Black Sea and a few other places -- some lakes --

252
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and get down, and you'll find that the water itself turns purple.

253
0:12:17.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
It turns purple from the presence of numerous microbes

254
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:23,000
which have to have sunlight and have to have hydrogen sulfide,

255
0:12:23.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and we can detect their presence today -- we can see them --

256
0:12:27.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
but we can also detect their presence in the past.

257
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And the last three years have seen

258
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
an enormous breakthrough in a brand-new field.

259
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
I am almost extinct --

260
0:12:36.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
I'm a paleontologist who collects fossils.

261
0:12:38.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
But the new wave of paleontologists -- my graduate students --

262
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
collect biomarkers.

263
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:47,000
They take the sediment itself, they extract the oil from it,

264
0:12:47.33,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and from that they can produce compounds

265
0:12:49.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
which turn out to be very specific to particular microbial groups.

266
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
It's because lipids are so tough, they can get preserved in sediment

267
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:13:,000
and last the hundreds of millions of years necessary,

268
0:13:00.33,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and be extracted and tell us who was there.

269
0:13:02.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And we know who was there. At the end of the Permian,

270
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
at many of these mass extinction boundaries,

271
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
this is what we find: isorenieratene. It's very specific.

272
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
It can only occur if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen,

273
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and is totally saturated with hydrogen sulfide --

274
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
enough, for instance, to come out of solution.

275
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
This led Lee Kump, and others from Penn State and my group,

276
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
to propose what I call the Kump Hypothesis:

277
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
many of the mass extinctions were caused by lowering oxygen,

278
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
by high CO2. And the worst effect of global warming, it turns out:

279
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
hydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans.

280
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Well, what's the source of this?

281
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:44,000
In this particular case, the source over and over has been flood basalts.

282
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
This is a view of the Earth now, if we extract a lot of it.

283
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:49,000
And each of these looks like a hydrogen bomb;

284
0:13:49.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
actually, the effects are even worse.

285
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:54,000
This is when deep-Earth material comes to the surface,

286
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
spreads out over the surface of the planet.

287
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Well, it's not the lava that kills anything,

288
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
it's the carbon dioxide that comes out with it.

289
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
This isn't Volvos; this is volcanoes.

290
0:14:04.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
But carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide.

291
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:1,000
So, these are new data Rob Berner and I -- from Yale -- put together,

292
0:14:10.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and what we try to do now is

293
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
track the amount of carbon dioxide in the entire rock record --

294
0:14:15.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and we can do this from a variety of means --

295
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and put all the red lines here,

296
0:14:20.33,000 --> 0:14:23,000
when these -- what I call greenhouse mass extinctions -- took place.

297
0:14:23.33,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And there's two things that are really evident here to me,

298
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
is that these extinctions take place when CO2 is going up.

299
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
But the second thing that's not shown on here:

300
0:14:31.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
the Earth has never had any ice on it

301
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
when we've had 1,000 parts per million CO2.

302
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
We are at 380 and climbing.

303
0:14:40.33,000 --> 0:14:43,000
We should be up to a thousand in three centuries at the most,

304
0:14:43.33,000 --> 0:14:47,000
but my friend David Battisti in Seattle says he thinks a 100 years.

305
0:14:47.33,000 --> 0:14:49,000
So, there goes the ice caps,

306
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and there comes 240 feet of sea level rise.

307
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:55,000
I live in a view house now;

308
0:14:55.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
I'm going to have waterfront.

309
0:14:57.33,000 --> 0:15:01,000
All right, what's the consequence? The oceans probably turn purple.

310
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And we think this is the reason that complexity took so long

311
0:15:04.33,000 --> 0:15:06,000
to take place on planet Earth.

312
0:15:06.33,000 --> 0:15:09,000
We had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period.

313
0:15:09.33,000 --> 0:15:13,000
They stop complex life from existing.

314
0:15:13.33,000 --> 0:15:18,000
We know hydrogen sulfide is erupting presently a few places on the planet.

315
0:15:18.33,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And I throw this slide in -- this is me, actually, two months ago --

316
0:15:22.33,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and I throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal, chambered nautilus.

317
0:15:26.33,000 --> 0:15:3,000
It's been on this planet since the animals first started -- 500 million years.

318
0:15:30.33,000 --> 0:15:33,000
This is a tracking experiment, and any of you scuba divers,

319
0:15:33.33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
if you want to get involved in one of the coolest projects ever,

320
0:15:36.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
this is off the Great Barrier Reef.

321
0:15:38.33,000 --> 0:15:39,000
And as we speak now,

322
0:15:39.33,000 --> 0:15:42,000
these nautilus are tracking out their behaviors to us.

323
0:15:42.33,000 --> 0:15:46,000
But the thing about this is that every once in a while

324
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:48,000
we divers can run into trouble,

325
0:15:48.33,000 --> 0:15:5,000
so I'm going to do a little thought experiment here.

326
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:53,000
This is a Great White Shark that ate some of my traps.

327
0:15:53.33,000 --> 0:15:56,000
We pulled it up; up it comes. So, it's out there with me at night.

328
0:15:56.33,000 --> 0:15:59,000
So, I'm swimming along, and it takes off my leg.

329
0:15:59.33,000 --> 0:16:02,000
I'm 80 miles from shore, what's going to happen to me?

330
0:16:02.33,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Well now, I die.

331
0:16:04.33,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Five years from now, this is what I hope happens to me:

332
0:16:06.33,000 --> 0:16:09,000
I'm taken back to the boat, I'm given a gas mask:

333
0:16:09.33,000 --> 0:16:12,000
80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide.

334
0:16:12.33,000 --> 0:16:16,000
I'm then thrown in an ice pond, I'm cooled 15 degrees lower

335
0:16:16.33,000 --> 0:16:2,000
and I could be taken to a critical care hospital.

336
0:16:20.33,000 --> 0:16:22,000
And the reason I could do that is because we mammals

337
0:16:22.33,000 --> 0:16:25,000
have gone through a series of these hydrogen sulfide events,

338
0:16:25.33,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and our bodies have adapted.

339
0:16:27.33,000 --> 0:16:31,000
And we can now use this as what I think will be a major medical breakthrough.

340
0:16:31.33,000 --> 0:16:33,000
This is Mark Roth. He was funded by DARPA.

341
0:16:33.33,000 --> 0:16:37,000
Tried to figure out how to save Americans after battlefield injuries.

342
0:16:37.33,000 --> 0:16:39,000
He bleeds out pigs.

343
0:16:39.33,000 --> 0:16:42,000
He puts in 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide --

344
0:16:42.33,000 --> 0:16:45,000
the same stuff that survived these past mass extinctions --

345
0:16:45.33,000 --> 0:16:47,000
and he turns a mammal into a reptile.

346
0:16:47.33,000 --> 0:16:51,000
"I believe we are seeing in this response the result of mammals and reptiles

347
0:16:51.33,000 --> 0:16:54,000
having undergone a series of exposures to H2S."

348
0:16:54.33,000 --> 0:16:56,000
I got this email from him two years ago;

349
0:16:56.33,000 --> 0:16:59,000
he said, "I think I've got an answer to some of your questions."

350
0:16:59.33,000 --> 0:17:01,000
So, he now has taken mice down

351
0:17:01.33,000 --> 0:17:05,000
for as many as four hours, sometimes six hours,

352
0:17:05.33,000 --> 0:17:07,000
and these are brand-new data he sent me on the way over here.

353
0:17:07.33,000 --> 0:17:12,000
On the top, now, that is a temperature record of a mouse who has gone through --

354
0:17:12.33,000 --> 0:17:14,000
the dotted line, the temperatures.

355
0:17:14.33,000 --> 0:17:16,000
So, the temperature starts at 25 centigrade,

356
0:17:16.33,000 --> 0:17:17,000
and down it goes, down it goes.

357
0:17:17.33,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Six hours later, up goes the temperature.

358
0:17:19.33,000 --> 0:17:24,000
Now, the same mouse is given 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide

359
0:17:24.33,000 --> 0:17:26,000
in this solid graph,

360
0:17:26.33,000 --> 0:17:28,000
and look what happens to its temperature.

361
0:17:28.33,000 --> 0:17:3,000
Its temperature drops.

362
0:17:30.33,000 --> 0:17:34,000
It goes down to 15 degrees centigrade from 35,

363
0:17:34.33,000 --> 0:17:37,000
and comes out of this perfectly fine.

364
0:17:37.33,000 --> 0:17:4,000
Here is a way we can get people to critical care.

365
0:17:40.33,000 --> 0:17:45,000
Here's how we can bring people cold enough to last till we get critical care.

366
0:17:46.33,000 --> 0:17:5,000
Now, you're all thinking, yeah, what about the brain tissue?

367
0:17:50.33,000 --> 0:17:53,000
And so this is one of the great challenges that is going to happen.

368
0:17:53.33,000 --> 0:17:55,000
You're in an accident. You've got two choices:

369
0:17:55.33,000 --> 0:17:58,000
you're going to die, or you're going to take the hydrogen sulfide

370
0:17:58.33,000 --> 0:18:01,000
and, say, 75 percent of you is saved, mentally.

371
0:18:01.33,000 --> 0:18:03,000
What are you going to do?

372
0:18:03.33,000 --> 0:18:06,000
Do we all have to have a little button saying, Let me die?

373
0:18:06.33,000 --> 0:18:08,000
This is coming towards us,

374
0:18:08.33,000 --> 0:18:1,000
and I think this is going to be a revolution.

375
0:18:10.33,000 --> 0:18:13,000
We're going to save lives, but there's going to be a cost to it.

376
0:18:13.33,000 --> 0:18:15,000
The new view of mass extinctions is, yes, we were hit,

377
0:18:15.33,000 --> 0:18:17,000
and, yes, we have to think about the long term,

378
0:18:17.33,000 --> 0:18:19,000
because we will get hit again.

379
0:18:19.33,000 --> 0:18:21,000
But there's a far worse danger confronting us.

380
0:18:21.33,000 --> 0:18:24,000
We can easily go back to the hydrogen sulfide world.

381
0:18:24.33,000 --> 0:18:26,000
Give us a few millennia --

382
0:18:26.33,000 --> 0:18:28,000
and we humans should last those few millennia --

383
0:18:28.33,000 --> 0:18:32,000
will it happen again? If we continue, it'll happen again.

384
0:18:32.33,000 --> 0:18:34,000
How many of us flew here?

385
0:18:34.33,000 --> 0:18:36,000
How many of us have gone through

386
0:18:36.33,000 --> 0:18:39,000
our entire Kyoto quota

387
0:18:39.33,000 --> 0:18:41,000
just for flying this year?

388
0:18:41.33,000 --> 0:18:44,000
How many of you have exceeded it? Yeah, I've certainly exceeded it.

389
0:18:44.33,000 --> 0:18:47,000
We have a huge problem facing us as a species.

390
0:18:47.33,000 --> 0:18:49,000
We have to beat this.

391
0:18:49.33,000 --> 0:18:53,000
I want to be able to go back to this reef. Thank you.

392
0:18:53.33,000 --> 0:18:59,000
(Applause)

393
0:18:59.33,000 --> 0:19:01,000
Chris Anderson: I've just got one question for you, Peter.

394
0:19:01.33,000 --> 0:19:03,000
Am I understanding you right, that what you're saying here

395
0:19:03.33,000 --> 0:19:05,000
is that we have in our own bodies

396
0:19:05.33,000 --> 0:19:09,000
a biochemical response to hydrogen sulfide

397
0:19:09.33,000 --> 0:19:12,000
that in your mind proves that there have been past mass extinctions

398
0:19:12.33,000 --> 0:19:14,000
due to climate change?

399
0:19:14.33,000 --> 0:19:16,000
Peter Ward: Yeah, every single cell in us

400
0:19:16.33,000 --> 0:19:19,000
can produce minute quantities of hydrogen sulfide in great crises.

401
0:19:20.33,000 --> 0:19:21,000
This is what Roth has found out.

402
0:19:21.33,000 --> 0:19:23,000
So, what we're looking at now: does it leave a signal?

403
0:19:23.33,000 --> 0:19:25,000
Does it leave a signal in bone or in plant?

404
0:19:25.33,000 --> 0:19:28,000
And we go back to the fossil record and we could try to detect

405
0:19:28.33,000 --> 0:19:3,000
how many of these have happened in the past.

406
0:19:30.33,000 --> 0:19:32,000
CA: It's simultaneously

407
0:19:32.33,000 --> 0:19:35,000
an incredible medical technique, but also a terrifying ...

408
0:19:35.33,000 --> 0:19:38,000
PW: Blessing and curse.

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So a couple of years ago I started a program

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
to try to get the rockstar tech and design people

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
to take a year off

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and work in the one environment

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that represents pretty much everything they're supposed to hate;

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
we have them work in government.

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
The program is called Code for America,

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and it's a little bit like a Peace Corps for geeks.

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
We select a few fellows every year

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and we have them work with city governments.

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Instead of sending them off into the Third World,

12
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
we send them into the wilds of City Hall.

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And there they make great apps, they work with city staffers.

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
But really what they're doing is they're showing what's possible

15
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
with technology today.

16
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So meet Al.

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
Al is a fire hydrant in the city of Boston.

18
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Here it kind of looks like he's looking for a date,

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
but what he's really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in,

20
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
because he knows he's not very good at fighting fires

21
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
when he's covered in four feet of snow.

22
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Now how did he come to be looking for help

23
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
in this very unique manner?

24
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
We had a team of fellows in Boston last year

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
through the Code for America program.

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
They were there in February, and it snowed a lot in February last year.

27
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And they noticed that the city never gets

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to digging out these fire hydrants.

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
But one fellow in particular,

30
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
a guy named Erik Michaels-Ober,

31
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
noticed something else,

32
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and that's that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
right in front of these things.

34
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So he did what any good developer would do,

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
he wrote an app.

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
It's a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant.

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
So you agree to dig it out when it snows.

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
If you do, you get to name it,

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and he called the first one Al.

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And if you don't, someone can steal it from you.

41
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So it's got cute little game dynamics on it.

42
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
This is a modest little app.

43
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
It's probably the smallest

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year.

45
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
But it's doing something

46
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that no other government technology does.

47
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It's spreading virally.

48
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
There's a guy in the I.T. department of the City of Honolulu

49
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
who saw this app and realized

50
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that he could use it, not for snow,

51
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens.

52
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
It's very important that these tsunami sirens work,

53
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
but people steal the batteries out of them.

54
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So he's getting citizens to check on them.

55
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And then Seattle decided to use it

56
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains.

57
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And Chicago just rolled it out

58
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows.

59
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So we now know of nine cities

60
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
that are planning to use this.

61
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And this has spread just frictionlessly,

62
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
organically, naturally.

63
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
If you know anything about government technology,

64
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
you know that this isn't how it normally goes.

65
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Procuring software usually takes a couple of years.

66
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
We had a team that worked on a project in Boston last year

67
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
that took three people about two and a half months.

68
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
It was a way that parents could figure out

69
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
which were the right public schools for their kids.

70
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
We were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels,

71
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
it would have taken at least two years

72
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and it would have cost about two million dollars.

73
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And that's nothing.

74
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
There is one project in the California court system right now

75
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that so far cost taxpayers

76
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
two billion dollars,

77
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and it doesn't work.

78
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And there are projects like this

79
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
at every level of government.

80
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So an app that takes a couple of days to write

81
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and then spreads virally,

82
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that's sort of a shot across the bow

83
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to the institution of government.

84
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It suggests how government could work better --

85
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
not more like a private company,

86
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
as many people think it should.

87
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And not even like a tech company,

88
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
but more like the Internet itself.

89
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And that means permissionless,

90
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
it means open, it means generative.

91
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And that's important.

92
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
But what's more important about this app

93
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
is that it represents how a new generation

94
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
is tackling the problem of government --

95
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
not as the problem of an ossified institution,

96
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
but as a problem of collective action.

97
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And that's great news,

98
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
because, it turns out, we're very good at collective action

99
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
with digital technology.

100
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Now there's a very large community of people

101
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that are building the tools that we need

102
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
to do things together effectively.

103
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
It's not just Code for America fellows,

104
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
there are hundreds of people all over the country

105
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that are standing and writing civic apps

106
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
every day in their own communities.

107
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
They haven't given up on government.

108
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
They are frustrated as hell with it,

109
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
but they're not complaining about it,

110
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
they're fixing it.

111
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And these folks know something

112
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that we've lost sight of.

113
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And that's that when you strip away all your feelings

114
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
about politics and the line at the DMV

115
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and all those other things

116
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that we're really mad about,

117
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
government is, at its core,

118
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
in the words of Tim O'Reilly,

119
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
"What we do together that we can't do alone."

120
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
Now a lot of people have given up on government.

121
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And if you're one of those people,

122
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I would ask that you reconsider,

123
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
because things are changing.

124
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Politics is not changing;

125
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
government is changing.

126
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And because government

127
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
ultimately derives its power from us --

128
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
remember "We the people?" --

129
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
how we think about it

130
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
is going to effect how that change happens.

131
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Now I didn't know very much about government when I started this program.

132
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And like a lot of people,

133
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I thought government was basically about getting people elected to office.

134
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Well after two years, I've come to the conclusion

135
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
that, especially local government,

136
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
is about opossums.

137
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
This is the call center for the services and information line.

138
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
It's generally where you will get

139
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
if you call 311 in your city.

140
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
If you should ever have the chance

141
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
to staff your city's call center,

142
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
as our fellow Scott Silverman did as part of the program --

143
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
in fact, they all do that --

144
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
you will find that people call government

145
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
with a very wide range of issues,

146
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
including having an opossum stuck in your house.

147
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So Scott gets this call.

148
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
He types "Opossum" into this official knowledge base.

149
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
He doesn't really come up with anything. He starts with animal control.

150
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And finally, he says, "Look, can you just open all the doors to your house

151
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and play music really loud

152
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and see if the thing leaves?"

153
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So that worked. So booya for Scott.

154
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But that wasn't the end of the opossums.

155
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Boston doesn't just have a call center.

156
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
It has an app, a Web and mobile app,

157
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
called Citizens Connect.

158
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Now we didn't write this app.

159
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
This is the work of the very smart people

160
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
at the Office of New Urban Mechanics in Boston.

161
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in:

162
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
"Opossum in my trashcan. Can't tell if it's dead.

163
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
How do I get this removed?"

164
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
But what happens with Citizens Connect is different.

165
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So Scott was speaking person-to-person.

166
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
But on Citizens Connect everything is public,

167
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
so everybody can see this.

168
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And in this case, a neighbor saw it.

169
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And the next report we got said,

170
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
"I walked over to this location,

171
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
found the trashcan behind the house.

172
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Opossum? Check. Living? Yep.

173
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Turned trashcan on its side. Walked home.

174
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Goodnight sweet opossum."

175
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
(Laughter)

176
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Pretty simple.

177
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So this is great. This is the digital meeting the physical.

178
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And it's also a great example

179
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
of government getting in on the crowd-sourcing game.

180
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.

181
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And I don't mean necessarily

182
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
a technological definition of platform here.

183
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I'm just talking about a platform for people

184
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
to help themselves and to help others.

185
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So one citizen helped another citizen,

186
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
but government played a key role here.

187
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
It connected those two people.

188
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And it could have connected them with government services if they'd been needed,

189
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative

190
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
to government services.

191
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
When one neighbor helps another,

192
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
we strengthen our communities.

193
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
We call animal control, it just costs a lot of money.

194
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Now one of the important things we need to think about government

195
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
is that it's not the same thing as politics.

196
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And most people get that,

197
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
but they think that one is the input to the other.

198
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
That our input to the system of government

199
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
is voting.

200
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Now how many times have we elected a political leader --

201
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and sometimes we spend a lot of energy

202
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
getting a new political leader elected --

203
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and then we sit back and we expect government

204
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
to reflect our values and meet our needs,

205
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and then not that much changes?

206
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
That's because government is like a vast ocean

207
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and politics is the six-inch layer on top.

208
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And what's under that

209
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
is what we call bureaucracy.

210
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And we say that word with such contempt.

211
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
But it's that contempt

212
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that keeps this thing that we own

213
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and we pay for

214
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
as something that's working against us, this other thing,

215
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and then we're disempowering ourselves.

216
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
People seem to think politics is sexy.

217
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
If we want this institution to work for us,

218
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
we're going to have to make bureaucracy sexy.

219
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Because that's where the real work of government happens.

220
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
We have to engage with the machinery of government.

221
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
So that's OccupytheSEC movement has done.

222
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Have you seen these guys?

223
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
It's a group of concerned citizens

224
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that have written a very detailed

225
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
325-page report

226
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
that's a response to the SEC's request for comment

227
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
on the Financial Reform Bill.

228
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
That's not being politically active,

229
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that's being bureaucratically active.

230
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Now for those of us who've given up on government,

231
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
it's time that we asked ourselves

232
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
about the world that we want to leave for our children.

233
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
You have to see the enormous challenges

234
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
that they're going to face.

235
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Do we really think we're going to get where we need to go

236
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
without fixing the one institution

237
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
that can act on behalf of all of us?

238
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
We can't do without government,

239
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
but we do need it

240
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
to be more effective.

241
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
The good news is that technology is making it possible

242
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
to fundamentally reframe

243
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
the function of government

244
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
in a way that can actually scale

245
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
by strengthening civil society.

246
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And there's a generation out there that's grown up on the Internet,

247
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and they know that it's not that hard

248
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
to do things together,

249
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
you just have to architect the systems the right way.

250
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Now the average age of our fellows is 28,

251
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
so I am, begrudgingly,

252
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
almost a generation older than most of them.

253
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
This is a generation

254
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
that's grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted.

255
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
They're not fighting that battle that we're all fighting

256
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
about who gets to speak;

257
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
they all get to speak.

258
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
They can express their opinion

259
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
on any channel at any time,

260
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and they do.

261
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
So when they're faced with the problem of government,

262
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
they don't care as much

263
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
about using their voices.

264
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
They're using their hands.

265
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
They're using their hands

266
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
to write applications that make government work better.

267
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And those applications let us use our hands

268
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
to make our communities better.

269
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
That could be shoveling out a hydrant, pulling a weed,

270
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
turning over a garbage can with an opossum in it.

271
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And certainly, we could have been shoveling out those fire hydrants all along,

272
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and many people do.

273
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
But these apps are like little digital reminders

274
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
that we're not just consumers,

275
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and we're not just consumers of government,

276
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
putting in our taxes and getting back services.

277
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
We're more than that,

278
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
we're citizens.

279
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And we're not going to fix government

280
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
until we fix citizenship.

281
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
So the question I have for all of you here:

282
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
When it comes to the big, important things

283
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
that we need to do together,

284
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
all of us together,

285
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
are we just going to be a crowd of voices,

286
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
or are we also going to be

287
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
a crowd of hands?

288
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Thank you.

289
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
(Applause)

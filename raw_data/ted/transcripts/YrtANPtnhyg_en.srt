1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:16,000
We grew up

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
interacting with the physical objects around us.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
There are an enormous number of them that we use every day.

4
0:00:24.553,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Unlike most of our computing devices,

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
these objects are much more fun to use.

6
0:00:31.18,000 --> 0:00:33,000
When you talk about objects,

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
one other thing automatically comes attached to that thing,

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and that is gestures:

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
how we manipulate these objects,

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
how we use these objects in everyday life.

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
We use gestures not only to interact with these objects,

12
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
but we also use them to interact with each other.

13
0:00:48.57,000 --> 0:00:51,000
A gesture of "Namaste!", maybe, to respect someone, or maybe,

14
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
in India I don't need to teach a kid that this means

15
0:00:54.713,000 --> 0:00:55,000
"four runs" in cricket.

16
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It comes as a part of our everyday learning.

17
0:00:59.716,000 --> 0:01:02,000
So, I am very interested, from the beginning,

18
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
how our knowledge about everyday objects and gestures,

19
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and how we use these objects,

20
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
can be leveraged to our interactions with the digital world.

21
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Rather than using a keyboard and mouse,

22
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
why can I not use my computer

23
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
in the same way that I interact in the physical world?

24
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
So, I started this exploration around eight years back,

25
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and it literally started with a mouse on my desk.

26
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Rather than using it for my computer, I actually opened it.

27
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Most of you might be aware that, in those days,

28
0:01:35.475,000 --> 0:01:37,000
the mouse used to come with a ball inside,

29
0:01:37.499,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and there were two rollers

30
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that actually guide the computer where the ball is moving,

31
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and, accordingly, where the mouse is moving.

32
0:01:44.38,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So, I was interested in these two rollers,

33
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and I actually wanted more, so I borrowed another mouse from a friend --

34
0:01:50.665,000 --> 0:01:51,000
never returned to him --

35
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and I now had four rollers.

36
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Interestingly, what I did with these rollers is,

37
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
basically, I took them off of these mouses and then put them in one line.

38
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
It had some strings and pulleys and some springs.

39
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
What I got is basically a gesture-interface device

40
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that actually acts as a motion-sensing device

41
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
made for two dollars.

42
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So, here, whatever movement I do in my physical world

43
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
is actually replicated inside the digital world

44
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
just using this small device that I made, around eight years back,

45
0:02:23.38,000 --> 0:02:24,000
in 2000.

46
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Because I was interested in integrating these two worlds,

47
0:02:27.951,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I thought of sticky notes.

48
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I thought, "Why can I not connect

49
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
the normal interface of a physical sticky note

50
0:02:34.427,000 --> 0:02:35,000
to the digital world?"

51
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
A message written on a sticky note to my mom,

52
0:02:38.432,000 --> 0:02:39,000
on paper,

53
0:02:39.66,000 --> 0:02:4,000
can come to an SMS,

54
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
or maybe a meeting reminder

55
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
automatically syncs with my digital calendar --

56
0:02:45.475,000 --> 0:02:47,000
a to-do list that automatically syncs with you.

57
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
But you can also search in the digital world,

58
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
or maybe you can write a query, saying,

59
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
"What is Dr. Smith's address?"

60
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and this small system actually prints it out --

61
0:02:57.475,000 --> 0:02:59,000
so it actually acts like a paper input-output system,

62
0:02:59.976,000 --> 0:03:01,000
just made out of paper.

63
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
In another exploration,

64
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I thought of making a pen that can draw in three dimensions.

65
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So, I implemented this pen that can help designers and architects

66
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
not only think in three dimensions,

67
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
but they can actually draw,

68
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
so that it's more intuitive to use that way.

69
0:03:20.332,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Then I thought, "Why not make a Google Map,

70
0:03:22.404,000 --> 0:03:23,000
but in the physical world?"

71
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Rather than typing a keyword to find something,

72
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I put my objects on top of it.

73
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
If I put a boarding pass, it will show me where the flight gate is.

74
0:03:32.475,000 --> 0:03:34,000
A coffee cup will show where you can find more coffee,

75
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
or where you can trash the cup.

76
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So, these were some of the earlier explorations I did

77
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
because the goal was to connect these two worlds seamlessly.

78
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Among all these experiments,

79
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
there was one thing in common:

80
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I was trying to bring a part of the physical world

81
0:03:51.789,000 --> 0:03:52,000
to the digital world.

82
0:03:53.311,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I was taking some part of the objects,

83
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
or any of the intuitiveness of real life,

84
0:03:58.261,000 --> 0:04:,000
and bringing them to the digital world,

85
0:04:00.474,000 --> 0:04:04,000
because the goal was to make our computing interfaces more intuitive.

86
0:04:04.523,000 --> 0:04:08,000
But then I realized that we humans are not actually interested in computing.

87
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
What we are interested in is information.

88
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
We want to know about things.

89
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
We want to know about dynamic things going around.

90
0:04:16.665,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So I thought, around last year -- in the beginning of the last year --

91
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I started thinking, "Why can I not take this approach in the reverse way?"

92
0:04:25.379,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Maybe, "How about I take my digital world

93
0:04:27.46,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and paint the physical world with that digital information?"

94
0:04:33.414,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Because pixels are actually, right now, confined in these rectangular devices

95
0:04:37.06,000 --> 0:04:38,000
that fit in our pockets.

96
0:04:38.831,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Why can I not remove this confine

97
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and take that to my everyday objects, everyday life

98
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
so that I don't need to learn the new language

99
0:04:46.427,000 --> 0:04:47,000
for interacting with those pixels?

100
0:04:49.474,000 --> 0:04:51,000
So, in order to realize this dream,

101
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I actually thought of putting a big-size projector on my head.

102
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I think that's why this is called a head-mounted projector, isn't it?

103
0:04:58.523,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I took it very literally,

104
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and took my bike helmet,

105
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
put a little cut over there so that the projector actually fits nicely.

106
0:05:05.665,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So now, what I can do --

107
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I can augment the world around me with this digital information.

108
0:05:11.918,000 --> 0:05:12,000
But later,

109
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I realized that I actually wanted to interact

110
0:05:15.343,000 --> 0:05:16,000
with those digital pixels, also.

111
0:05:16.96,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So I put a small camera over there that acts as a digital eye.

112
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Later, we moved to a much better,

113
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
consumer-oriented pendant version of that,

114
0:05:24.284,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that many of you now know as the SixthSense device.

115
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
But the most interesting thing about this particular technology

116
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
is that you can carry your digital world with you

117
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
wherever you go.

118
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
You can start using any surface, any wall around you,

119
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
as an interface.

120
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
The camera is actually tracking all your gestures.

121
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Whatever you're doing with your hands,

122
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
it's understanding that gesture.

123
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And, actually, if you see, there are some color markers

124
0:05:50.86,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that in the beginning version we are using with it.

125
0:05:53.36,000 --> 0:05:54,000
You can start painting on any wall.

126
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
You stop by a wall, and start painting on that wall.

127
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
But we are not only tracking one finger, here.

128
0:06:00.427,000 --> 0:06:03,000
We are giving you the freedom of using all of both of your hands,

129
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
so you can actually use both of your hands to zoom into or zoom out

130
0:06:07.427,000 --> 0:06:08,000
of a map just by pinching all present.

131
0:06:09.427,000 --> 0:06:12,000
The camera is actually doing -- just, getting all the images --

132
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
is doing the edge recognition and also the color recognition

133
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and so many other small algorithms are going on inside.

134
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
So, technically, it's a little bit complex,

135
0:06:21.284,000 --> 0:06:24,000
but it gives you an output which is more intuitive to use, in some sense.

136
0:06:24.784,000 --> 0:06:26,000
But I'm more excited that you can actually take it outside.

137
0:06:27.66,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Rather than getting your camera out of your pocket,

138
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
you can just do the gesture of taking a photo,

139
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and it takes a photo for you.

140
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
(Applause)

141
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Thank you.

142
0:06:40.859,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And later I can find a wall, anywhere,

143
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and start browsing those photos

144
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
or maybe, "OK, I want to modify this photo a little bit

145
0:06:47.96,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and send it as an email to a friend."

146
0:06:49.97,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So, we are looking for an era

147
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
where computing will actually merge with the physical world.

148
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And, of course, if you don't have any surface,

149
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
you can start using your palm for simple operations.

150
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Here, I'm dialing a phone number just using my hand.

151
0:07:07.14,000 --> 0:07:1,000
The camera is actually not only understanding your hand movements,

152
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
but, interestingly,

153
0:07:11.46,000 --> 0:07:14,000
is also able to understand what objects you are holding in your hand.

154
0:07:15.269,000 --> 0:07:18,000
For example, in this case,

155
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
the book cover is matched

156
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
with so many thousands, or maybe millions of books online,

157
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and checking out which book it is.

158
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Once it has that information,

159
0:07:27.76,000 --> 0:07:28,000
it finds out more reviews about that,

160
0:07:29.66,000 --> 0:07:31,000
or maybe New York Times has a sound overview on that,

161
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
so you can actually hear, on a physical book,

162
0:07:34.38,000 --> 0:07:35,000
a review as sound.

163
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
(Video) Famous talk at Harvard University --

164
0:07:38.46,000 --> 0:07:41,000
This was Obama's visit last week to MIT.

165
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
(Video) And particularly I want to thank two outstanding MIT --

166
0:07:45.749,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Pranav Mistry: So, I was seeing the live [video] of his talk,

167
0:07:48.807,000 --> 0:07:49,000
outside, on just a newspaper.

168
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Your newspaper will show you live weather information

169
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
rather than having it updated.

170
0:07:56.89,000 --> 0:07:58,000
You have to check your computer in order to do that, right?

171
0:07:59.761,000 --> 0:08:03,000
(Applause)

172
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
When I'm going back, I can just use my boarding pass

173
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
to check how much my flight has been delayed,

174
0:08:09.38,000 --> 0:08:1,000
because at that particular time,

175
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I'm not feeling like opening my iPhone,

176
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and checking out a particular icon.

177
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And I think this technology will not only change the way --

178
0:08:18.418,000 --> 0:08:18,000
(Laughter)

179
0:08:19.418,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Yes.

180
0:08:20.46,000 --> 0:08:22,000
It will change the way we interact with people, also,

181
0:08:22.962,000 --> 0:08:23,000
not only the physical world.

182
0:08:24.501,000 --> 0:08:26,000
The fun part is, I'm going to the Boston metro,

183
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and playing a pong game inside the train on the ground, right?

184
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
(Laughter)

185
0:08:33.36,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And I think the imagination is the only limit

186
0:08:35.48,000 --> 0:08:36,000
of what you can think of

187
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
when this kind of technology merges with real life.

188
0:08:39.76,000 --> 0:08:4,000
But many of you argue, actually,

189
0:08:41.66,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that all of our work is not only about physical objects.

190
0:08:44.36,000 --> 0:08:46,000
We actually do lots of accounting and paper editing

191
0:08:47.36,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and all those kinds of things; what about that?

192
0:08:49.675,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And many of you are excited about the next-generation tablet computers

193
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to come out in the market.

194
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So, rather than waiting for that,

195
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
I actually made my own, just using a piece of paper.

196
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
So, what I did here is remove the camera --

197
0:09:02.284,000 --> 0:09:05,000
All the webcam cameras have a microphone inside the camera.

198
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
I removed the microphone from that,

199
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and then just pinched that --

200
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
like I just made a clip out of the microphone --

201
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and clipped that to a piece of paper, any paper that you found around.

202
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So now the sound of the touch

203
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
is getting me when exactly I'm touching the paper.

204
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
But the camera is actually tracking where my fingers are moving.

205
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
You can of course watch movies.

206
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
(Video) Good afternoon. My name is Russell,

207
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54."

208
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
PM: And you can of course play games.

209
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
(Car engine)

210
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Here, the camera is actually understanding how you're holding the paper

211
0:09:46.618,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and playing a car-racing game.

212
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
(Applause)

213
0:09:52.656,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Many of you already must have thought, OK, you can browse.

214
0:09:55.458,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Yeah. Of course you can browse to any websites

215
0:09:57.76,000 --> 0:09:59,000
or you can do all sorts of computing on a piece of paper

216
0:10:00.46,000 --> 0:10:01,000
wherever you need it.

217
0:10:01.66,000 --> 0:10:03,000
So, more interestingly,

218
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I'm interested in how we can take that in a more dynamic way.

219
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
When I come back to my desk, I can just pinch that information

220
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
back to my desktop

221
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
so I can use my full-size computer.

222
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
(Applause)

223
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And why only computers? We can just play with papers.

224
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Paper world is interesting to play with.

225
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Here, I'm taking a part of a document,

226
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and putting over here a second part from a second place,

227
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and I'm actually modifying the information that I have over there.

228
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Yeah. And I say, "OK, this looks nice, let me print it out, that thing."

229
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
So I now have a print-out of that thing.

230
0:10:41.665,000 --> 0:10:43,000
So the workflow is more intuitive,

231
0:10:44.013,000 --> 0:10:47,000
the way we used to do it maybe 20 years back,

232
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
rather than now switching between these two worlds.

233
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
So, as a last thought,

234
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
I think that integrating information to everyday objects

235
0:10:57.66,000 --> 0:11:,000
will not only help us to get rid of the digital divide,

236
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
the gap between these two worlds,

237
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
but will also help us, in some way,

238
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
to stay human,

239
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
to be more connected to our physical world.

240
0:11:13.668,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And it will actually help us not end up being machines

241
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
sitting in front of other machines.

242
0:11:18.767,000 --> 0:11:2,000
That's all. Thank you.

243
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
(Applause)

244
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Thank you.

245
0:11:36.46,000 --> 0:11:38,000
(Applause)

246
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Chris Anderson: So, Pranav, first of all, you're a genius.

247
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
This is incredible, really.

248
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
What are you doing with this? Is there a company being planned?

249
0:11:49.384,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Or is this research forever, or what?

250
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Pranav Mistry: So, there are lots of companies,

251
0:11:53.56,000 --> 0:11:55,000
sponsor companies of Media Lab interested in taking this ahead

252
0:11:56.58,000 --> 0:11:57,000
in one or another way.

253
0:11:57.79,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Companies like mobile-phone operators

254
0:11:59.787,000 --> 0:12:01,000
want to take this in a different way than the NGOs in India,

255
0:12:02.685,000 --> 0:12:04,000
thinking, "Why can we only have 'Sixth Sense'?

256
0:12:04.885,000 --> 0:12:07,000
We should have a 'Fifth Sense' for missing-sense people who cannot speak.

257
0:12:08.36,000 --> 0:12:11,000
This technology can be used for them to speak out in a different way

258
0:12:11.675,000 --> 0:12:12,000
maybe a speaker system."

259
0:12:12.975,000 --> 0:12:14,000
CA: What are your own plans? Are you staying at MIT,

260
0:12:15.46,000 --> 0:12:17,000
or are you going to do something with this?

261
0:12:17.56,000 --> 0:12:19,000
PM: I'm trying to make this more available to people

262
0:12:20.113,000 --> 0:12:22,000
so that anyone can develop their own SixthSense device,

263
0:12:22.813,000 --> 0:12:25,000
because the hardware is actually not that hard to manufacture

264
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
or hard to make your own.

265
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
We will provide all the open source software for them,

266
0:12:30.856,000 --> 0:12:31,000
maybe starting next month.

267
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
CA: Open source? Wow.

268
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
(Applause)

269
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
CA: Are you going to come back to India with some of this, at some point?

270
0:12:42.713,000 --> 0:12:43,000
PM: Yeah. Yes, yes, of course.

271
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
CA: What are your plans? MIT? India?

272
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
How are you going to split your time going forward?

273
0:12:48.76,000 --> 0:12:5,000
PM: There is a lot of energy here. Lots of learning.

274
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
All of this work that you have seen is all about my learning in India.

275
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And now, if you see, it's more about the cost-effectiveness:

276
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
this system costs you $300

277
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
compared to the $20,000 surface tables, or anything like that.

278
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Or maybe even the $2 mouse gesture system at that time was costing around $5,000?

279
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
I showed that, at a conference, to President Abdul Kalam, at that time,

280
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and then he said, "OK, we should use this in Bhabha Atomic Research Centre

281
0:13:18.808,000 --> 0:13:19,000
for some use of that."

282
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
So I'm excited about how I can bring the technology to the masses

283
0:13:23.38,000 --> 0:13:26,000
rather than just keeping that technology in the lab environment.

284
0:13:26.404,000 --> 0:13:29,000
(Applause)

285
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
CA: Based on the people we've seen at TED,

286
0:13:32.402,000 --> 0:13:34,000
I would say you're truly one of the two or three

287
0:13:34.76,000 --> 0:13:35,000
best inventors in the world right now.

288
0:13:36.66,000 --> 0:13:37,000
It's an honor to have you at TED.

289
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Thank you so much.

290
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
That's fantastic.

291
0:13:41.46,000 --> 0:13:44,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.56,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Half of the human workforce is expected to be replaced

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
by software and robots in the next 20 years.

3
0:00:19.48,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And many corporate leaders welcome that as a chance to increase profits.

4
0:00:24.6,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Machines are more efficient;

5
0:00:26.84,000 --> 0:00:29,000
humans are complicated and difficult to manage.

6
0:00:31.72,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Well, I want our organizations to remain human.

7
0:00:37.2,000 --> 0:00:39,000
In fact, I want them to become beautiful.

8
0:00:41.12,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Because as machines take our jobs and do them more efficiently,

9
0:00:44.759,000 --> 0:00:48,000
soon the only work left for us humans will be the kind of work

10
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that must be done beautifully rather than efficiently.

11
0:00:53.76,000 --> 0:00:56,000
To maintain our humanity in the this second Machine Age,

12
0:00:56.96,000 --> 0:01:,000
we may have no other choice than to create beauty.

13
0:01:02.24,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Beauty is an elusive concept.

14
0:01:04.48,000 --> 0:01:07,000
For the writer Stendhal it was the promise of happiness.

15
0:01:08.52,000 --> 0:01:1,000
For me it's a goal by Lionel Messi.

16
0:01:10.88,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:12.32,000 --> 0:01:13,000
So bear with me

18
0:01:13.92,000 --> 0:01:17,000
as I am proposing four admittedly very subjective principles

19
0:01:18.32,000 --> 0:01:2,000
that you can use to build a beautiful organization.

20
0:01:21.96,000 --> 0:01:23,000
First: do the unnecessary.

21
0:01:24.52,000 --> 0:01:25,000
[Do the Unnecessary]

22
0:01:25.76,000 --> 0:01:26,000
A few months ago, Hamdi Ulukaya,

23
0:01:27.32,000 --> 0:01:3,000
the CEO and founder of the yogurt company Chobani,

24
0:01:30.48,000 --> 0:01:34,000
made headlines when he decided to grant stock to all of his 2,000 employees.

25
0:01:35.6,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Some called it a PR stunt,

26
0:01:37.56,000 --> 0:01:39,000
others -- a genuine act of giving back.

27
0:01:39.8,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But there is something else that was remarkable about it.

28
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:45,000
It came completely out of the blue.

29
0:01:45.08,000 --> 0:01:47,000
There had been no market or stakeholder pressure,

30
0:01:47.72,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and employees were so surprised

31
0:01:49.72,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that they burst into tears when they heard the news.

32
0:01:53.6,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Actions like Ulukaya's are beautiful because they catch us off guard.

33
0:01:57.48,000 --> 0:01:59,000
They create something out of nothing

34
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:02,000
because they're completely unnecessary.

35
0:02:04.04,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I once worked at a company

36
0:02:06.12,000 --> 0:02:07,000
that was the result of a merger

37
0:02:07.72,000 --> 0:02:1,000
of a large IT outsourcing firm and a small design firm.

38
0:02:11.4,000 --> 0:02:12,000
We were merging 9,000 software engineers

39
0:02:13.4,000 --> 0:02:14,000
with 1,000 creative types.

40
0:02:15.8,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And to unify these immensely different cultures,

41
0:02:18.56,000 --> 0:02:21,000
we were going to launch a third, new brand.

42
0:02:21.639,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And the new brand color was going to be orange.

43
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And as we were going through the budget for the rollouts,

44
0:02:28.6,000 --> 0:02:3,000
we decided last minute

45
0:02:30.68,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to cut the purchase of 10,000 orange balloons,

46
0:02:34.36,000 --> 0:02:36,000
which we had meant to distribute to all staff worldwide.

47
0:02:37.8,000 --> 0:02:4,000
They just seemed unnecessary and cute in the end.

48
0:02:41.92,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I didn't know back then

49
0:02:43.84,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that our decision marked the beginning of the end --

50
0:02:46.4,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that these two organizations would never become one.

51
0:02:49.92,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And sure enough, the merger eventually failed.

52
0:02:52.64,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Now, was it because there weren't any orange balloons?

53
0:02:55.48,000 --> 0:02:56,000
No, of course not.

54
0:02:57.88,000 --> 0:03:01,000
But the kill-the-orange-balloons mentality permeated everything else.

55
0:03:03.12,000 --> 0:03:06,000
You might not always realize it, but when you cut the unnecessary,

56
0:03:06.92,000 --> 0:03:07,000
you cut everything.

57
0:03:09.28,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Leading with beauty means rising above what is merely necessary.

58
0:03:14.76,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So do not kill your orange balloons.

59
0:03:19.04,000 --> 0:03:2,000
The second principle:

60
0:03:20.72,000 --> 0:03:21,000
create intimacy.

61
0:03:22.08,000 --> 0:03:23,000
[Create Intimacy]

62
0:03:23.48,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Studies show that how we feel about our workplace

63
0:03:26.32,000 --> 0:03:28,000
very much depends on the relationships with our coworkers.

64
0:03:29.68,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And what are relationships other than a string of microinteractions?

65
0:03:33.12,000 --> 0:03:36,000
There are hundreds of these every day in our organizations

66
0:03:36.36,000 --> 0:03:4,000
that have the potential to distinguish a good life from a beautiful one.

67
0:03:41.48,000 --> 0:03:42,000
The marriage researcher John Gottman says

68
0:03:43.48,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that the secret of a healthy relationship

69
0:03:46.12,000 --> 0:03:49,000
is not the great gesture or the lofty promise,

70
0:03:49.2,000 --> 0:03:51,000
it's small moments of attachment.

71
0:03:52.2,000 --> 0:03:53,000
In other words, intimacy.

72
0:03:55.12,000 --> 0:03:56,000
In our networked organizations,

73
0:03:56.68,000 --> 0:03:58,000
we tout the strength of weak ties

74
0:03:59.32,000 --> 0:04:01,000
but we underestimate the strength of strong ones.

75
0:04:02.2,000 --> 0:04:04,000
We forget the words of the writer Richard Bach who once said,

76
0:04:05.12,000 --> 0:04:06,000
"Intimacy --

77
0:04:06.36,000 --> 0:04:07,000
not connectedness --

78
0:04:07.6,000 --> 0:04:09,000
intimacy is the opposite of loneliness."

79
0:04:10.92,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So how do we design for organizational intimacy?

80
0:04:15.48,000 --> 0:04:16,000
The humanitarian organization CARE

81
0:04:17.36,000 --> 0:04:19,000
wanted to launch a campaign on gender equality

82
0:04:19.76,000 --> 0:04:2,000
in villages in northern India.

83
0:04:22.12,000 --> 0:04:23,000
But it realized quickly

84
0:04:23.4,000 --> 0:04:25,000
that it had to have this conversation first with its own staff.

85
0:04:26.96,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So it invited all 36 team members and their partners

86
0:04:32.04,000 --> 0:04:33,000
to one of the Khajuraho Temples,

87
0:04:33.8,000 --> 0:04:35,000
known for their famous erotic sculptures.

88
0:04:37.52,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And there they openly discussed their personal relationships --

89
0:04:41.12,000 --> 0:04:43,000
their own experiences of gender equality

90
0:04:44.52,000 --> 0:04:46,000
with the coworkers and the partners.

91
0:04:47.04,000 --> 0:04:49,000
It was eye-opening for the participants.

92
0:04:49.36,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Not only did it allow them to relate to the communities they serve,

93
0:04:53.4,000 --> 0:04:55,000
it also broke down invisible barriers

94
0:04:55.96,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and created a lasting bond amongst themselves.

95
0:04:58.2,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Not a single team member quit in the next four years.

96
0:05:03.2,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So this is how you create intimacy.

97
0:05:05.72,000 --> 0:05:06,000
No masks ...

98
0:05:07.92,000 --> 0:05:08,000
or lots of masks.

99
0:05:09.56,000 --> 0:05:1,000
(Laughter)

100
0:05:10.8,000 --> 0:05:11,000
When Danone, the food company,

101
0:05:12.28,000 --> 0:05:15,000
wanted to translate its new company manifesto into product initiatives,

102
0:05:16.52,000 --> 0:05:18,000
it gathered the management team

103
0:05:18.72,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and 100 employees from across different departments,

104
0:05:22.36,000 --> 0:05:23,000
seniority levels and regions

105
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:26,000
for a three-day strategy retreat.

106
0:05:26.8,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And it asked everybody to wear costumes for the entire meeting:

107
0:05:30.28,000 --> 0:05:33,000
wigs, crazy hats, feather boas,

108
0:05:33.4,000 --> 0:05:34,000
huge glasses and so on.

109
0:05:35.56,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And they left with concrete outcomes

110
0:05:37.84,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and full of enthusiasm.

111
0:05:40.04,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And when I asked the woman who had designed this experience

112
0:05:43.04,000 --> 0:05:44,000
why it worked,

113
0:05:44.28,000 --> 0:05:47,000
she simply said, "Never underestimate the power of a ridiculous wig."

114
0:05:48.12,000 --> 0:05:49,000
(Laughter)

115
0:05:49.32,000 --> 0:05:51,000
(Applause)

116
0:05:52.88,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Because wigs erase hierarchy,

117
0:05:56.08,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and hierarchy kills intimacy --

118
0:05:57.96,000 --> 0:05:58,000
both ways,

119
0:05:59.2,000 --> 0:06:,000
for the CEO and the intern.

120
0:06:01.44,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Wigs allow us to use the disguise of the false

121
0:06:05.6,000 --> 0:06:07,000
to show something true about ourselves.

122
0:06:09.12,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And that's not easy in our everyday work lives,

123
0:06:11.36,000 --> 0:06:13,000
because the relationship with our organizations

124
0:06:13.72,000 --> 0:06:16,000
is often like that of a married couple that has grown apart,

125
0:06:18.24,000 --> 0:06:21,000
suffered betrayals and disappointments,

126
0:06:21.28,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and is now desperate to be beautiful for one another once again.

127
0:06:25.88,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And for either of us the first step towards beauty involves a huge risk.

128
0:06:30.52,000 --> 0:06:31,000
The risk to be ugly.

129
0:06:31.76,000 --> 0:06:32,000
[Be Ugly]

130
0:06:33.12,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So many organizations these days are keen on designing beautiful workplaces

131
0:06:37.4,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that look like anything but work:

132
0:06:39.04,000 --> 0:06:43,000
vacation resorts, coffee shops, playgrounds or college campuses --

133
0:06:43.08,000 --> 0:06:44,000
(Laughter)

134
0:06:44.32,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Based on the promises of positive psychology,

135
0:06:46.52,000 --> 0:06:49,000
we speak of play and gamification,

136
0:06:49.92,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and one start-up even says that when someone gets fired,

137
0:06:53.48,000 --> 0:06:54,000
they have graduated.

138
0:06:54.8,000 --> 0:06:55,000
(Laughter)

139
0:06:56.8,000 --> 0:06:59,000
That kind of beautiful language only goes "skin deep,

140
0:07:00.32,000 --> 0:07:03,000
but ugly cuts clean to the bone,"

141
0:07:04.24,000 --> 0:07:06,000
as the writer Dorothy Parker once put it.

142
0:07:06.48,000 --> 0:07:09,000
To be authentic is to be ugly.

143
0:07:10.8,000 --> 0:07:14,000
It doesn't mean that you can't have fun or must give in to the vulgar or cynical,

144
0:07:15.24,000 --> 0:07:18,000
but it does mean that you speak the actual ugly truth.

145
0:07:19.76,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Like this manufacturer

146
0:07:21.04,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that wanted to transform one of its struggling business units.

147
0:07:24.8,000 --> 0:07:27,000
It identified, named and pinned on large boards all the issues --

148
0:07:28.24,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and there were hundreds of them --

149
0:07:29.92,000 --> 0:07:31,000
that had become obstacles to better performance.

150
0:07:32.24,000 --> 0:07:34,000
They put them on boards, moved them all into one room,

151
0:07:34.84,000 --> 0:07:36,000
which they called "the ugly room."

152
0:07:37.12,000 --> 0:07:39,000
The ugly became visible for everyone to see --

153
0:07:39.52,000 --> 0:07:4,000
it was celebrated.

154
0:07:41.36,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And the ugly room served as a mix of mirror exhibition and operating room --

155
0:07:45.24,000 --> 0:07:48,000
a biopsy on the living flesh to cut out all the bureaucracy.

156
0:07:50.64,000 --> 0:07:53,000
The ugliest part of our body is our brain.

157
0:07:54.64,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Literally and neurologically.

158
0:07:57.2,000 --> 0:08:,000
Our brain renders ugly what is unfamiliar ...

159
0:08:01.44,000 --> 0:08:02,000
modern art, atonal music,

160
0:08:03.44,000 --> 0:08:04,000
jazz, maybe --

161
0:08:04.68,000 --> 0:08:05,000
VR goggles for that matter --

162
0:08:06.4,000 --> 0:08:09,000
strange objects, sounds and people.

163
0:08:10.32,000 --> 0:08:12,000
But we've all been ugly once.

164
0:08:12.52,000 --> 0:08:13,000
We were a weird-looking baby,

165
0:08:14.88,000 --> 0:08:16,000
a new kid on the block, a foreigner.

166
0:08:17.96,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And we will be ugly again when we don't belong.

167
0:08:23.32,000 --> 0:08:24,000
The Center for Political Beauty,

168
0:08:25.24,000 --> 0:08:26,000
an activist collective in Berlin,

169
0:08:26.88,000 --> 0:08:28,000
recently staged an extreme artistic intervention.

170
0:08:30.2,000 --> 0:08:31,000
With the permission of relatives,

171
0:08:32.12,000 --> 0:08:36,000
it exhumed the corpses of refugees who had drowned at Europe's borders,

172
0:08:36.28,000 --> 0:08:37,000
transported them all the way to Berlin,

173
0:08:38.2,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and then reburied them at the heart of the German capital.

174
0:08:42.4,000 --> 0:08:45,000
The idea was to allow them to reach their desired destination,

175
0:08:46.12,000 --> 0:08:47,000
if only after their death.

176
0:08:48.96,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Such acts of beautification may not be pretty,

177
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:53,000
but they are much needed.

178
0:08:53.28,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Because things tend to get ugly when there's only one meaning, one truth,

179
0:08:56.76,000 --> 0:08:57,000
only answers and no questions.

180
0:08:58.88,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Beautiful organizations keep asking questions.

181
0:09:02.48,000 --> 0:09:04,000
They remain incomplete,

182
0:09:05.275,000 --> 0:09:07,000
which is the fourth and the last of the principles.

183
0:09:07.68,000 --> 0:09:08,000
[Remain Incomplete]

184
0:09:09.24,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Recently I was in Paris,

185
0:09:11.4,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and a friend of mine took me to Nuit Debout,

186
0:09:14.4,000 --> 0:09:15,000
which stands for "up all night,"

187
0:09:15.96,000 --> 0:09:16,000
the self-organized protest movement

188
0:09:17.92,000 --> 0:09:2,000
that had formed in response to the proposed labor laws in France.

189
0:09:22.68,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Every night, hundreds gathered at the Place de la République.

190
0:09:25.92,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Every night they set up a small, temporary village

191
0:09:28.52,000 --> 0:09:3,000
to deliberate their own vision of the French Republic.

192
0:09:32.12,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And at the core of this adhocracy

193
0:09:34.8,000 --> 0:09:36,000
was a general assembly where anybody could speak

194
0:09:37.08,000 --> 0:09:39,000
using a specially designed sign language.

195
0:09:40.92,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Like Occupy Wall Street and other protest movements,

196
0:09:44.2,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Nuit Debout was born in the face of crisis.

197
0:09:47.12,000 --> 0:09:48,000
It was messy --

198
0:09:48.6,000 --> 0:09:5,000
full of controversies and contradictions.

199
0:09:51.92,000 --> 0:09:53,000
But whether you agreed with the movement's goals or not,

200
0:09:54.72,000 --> 0:09:57,000
every gathering was a beautiful lesson in raw humanity.

201
0:09:59.64,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And how fitting that Paris --

202
0:10:01.68,000 --> 0:10:03,000
the city of ideals, the city of beauty --

203
0:10:04.48,000 --> 0:10:05,000
was it's stage.

204
0:10:05.72,000 --> 0:10:06,000
It reminds us that like great cities,

205
0:10:07.56,000 --> 0:10:11,000
the most beautiful organizations are ideas worth fighting for --

206
0:10:11.76,000 --> 0:10:14,000
even and especially when their outcome is uncertain.

207
0:10:15.48,000 --> 0:10:16,000
They are movements;

208
0:10:16.8,000 --> 0:10:18,000
they are always imperfect, never fully organized,

209
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
so they avoid ever becoming banal.

210
0:10:21.88,000 --> 0:10:23,000
They have something but we don't know what it is.

211
0:10:24.24,000 --> 0:10:26,000
They remain mysterious; we can't take our eyes off them.

212
0:10:27.2,000 --> 0:10:28,000
We find them beautiful.

213
0:10:31.24,000 --> 0:10:32,000
So to do the unnecessary,

214
0:10:33.12,000 --> 0:10:34,000
to create intimacy,

215
0:10:34.8,000 --> 0:10:35,000
to be ugly,

216
0:10:36.32,000 --> 0:10:37,000
to remain incomplete --

217
0:10:38.56,000 --> 0:10:4,000
these are not only the qualities of beautiful organizations,

218
0:10:41.56,000 --> 0:10:43,000
these are inherently human characteristics.

219
0:10:44.6,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And these are also the qualities of what we call home.

220
0:10:49.52,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And as we disrupt, and are disrupted,

221
0:10:51.96,000 --> 0:10:53,000
the least we can do is to ensure

222
0:10:54.28,000 --> 0:10:58,000
that we still feel at home in our organizations,

223
0:10:58.32,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and that we use our organizations to create that feeling for others.

224
0:11:02.6,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Beauty can save the world when we embrace these principles

225
0:11:05.72,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and design for them.

226
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
In the face of artificial intelligence and machine learning,

227
0:11:11.4,000 --> 0:11:13,000
we need a new radical humanism.

228
0:11:13.76,000 --> 0:11:17,000
We must acquire and promote a new aesthetic and sentimental education.

229
0:11:19.32,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Because if we don't,

230
0:11:21.36,000 --> 0:11:23,000
we might end up feeling like aliens

231
0:11:23.84,000 --> 0:11:27,000
in organizations and societies that are full of smart machines

232
0:11:27.88,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that have no appreciation whatsoever

233
0:11:30.72,000 --> 0:11:31,000
for the unnecessary,

234
0:11:32.36,000 --> 0:11:33,000
the intimate,

235
0:11:33.64,000 --> 0:11:34,000
the incomplete

236
0:11:35.36,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and definitely not for the ugly.

237
0:11:37.76,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Thank you.

238
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:43,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.799,000 --> 0:00:13,000
This picture

2
0:00:14.699,000 --> 0:00:15,000
is from my metro card

3
0:00:16.373,000 --> 0:00:2,000
when I spent a year abroad in Paris in college in the mid-'90s.

4
0:00:20.799,000 --> 0:00:23,000
My friend says I look like a French anarchist --

5
0:00:23.994,000 --> 0:00:24,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:25.025,000 --> 0:00:26,000
But this is still what I see

7
0:00:26.396,000 --> 0:00:28,000
when I look in the mirror in the morning.

8
0:00:28.587,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Within a month of living in Paris, I'd lost 15 pounds

9
0:00:31.71,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and I was in the best shape of my life

10
0:00:33.769,000 --> 0:00:34,000
because I was eating fresh food

11
0:00:35.79,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and I was walking wherever I went.

12
0:00:38.828,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Having grown up in suburban Atlanta,

13
0:00:40.663,000 --> 0:00:43,000
a region built largely by highways and automobiles

14
0:00:44.092,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and with a reputation as a poster child for sprawl,

15
0:00:47.777,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Paris fundamentally changed the way I understood

16
0:00:50.363,000 --> 0:00:52,000
the construction of the world around me,

17
0:00:53.107,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and I got obsessed with the role of infrastructure --

18
0:00:56.619,000 --> 0:01:,000
that it's not just the way to move people from point A to point B,

19
0:01:00.737,000 --> 0:01:04,000
it's not just the way to convey water or sewage or energy,

20
0:01:04.85,000 --> 0:01:06,000
but it's the foundation for our economy.

21
0:01:07.444,000 --> 0:01:1,000
It's the foundation for our social life and for our culture,

22
0:01:10.831,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and it really matters to the way that we live.

23
0:01:14.118,000 --> 0:01:16,000
When I came home, I was instantly frustrated,

24
0:01:16.726,000 --> 0:01:19,000
stuck in traffic as I crossed the top end of our perimeter highway.

25
0:01:20.676,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Not only was I not moving a muscle,

26
0:01:22.967,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I had no social interaction

27
0:01:24.636,000 --> 0:01:27,000
with the hundreds of thousands of people that were hurtling past me,

28
0:01:27.899,000 --> 0:01:3,000
like me, with their eyes faced forward and their music blaring.

29
0:01:32.765,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I wondered if this was an inevitable outcome,

30
0:01:35.586,000 --> 0:01:36,000
or could we do something about it.

31
0:01:37.817,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Was it possible to transform this condition in Atlanta

32
0:01:41.069,000 --> 0:01:43,000
into the kind of place that I wanted to live in?

33
0:01:43.949,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I went back to grad school in architecture and city planning,

34
0:01:47.069,000 --> 0:01:49,000
developed this interest in infrastructure,

35
0:01:49.425,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and in 1999 came up with an idea

36
0:01:52.042,000 --> 0:01:53,000
for my thesis project:

37
0:01:53.631,000 --> 0:01:57,000
the adaptation of an obsolete loop of old railroad circling downtown

38
0:01:57.972,000 --> 0:02:,000
as a new infrastructure for urban revitalization.

39
0:02:01.036,000 --> 0:02:02,000
It was just an idea.

40
0:02:02.8,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I never thought we would actually build it.

41
0:02:06.215,000 --> 0:02:08,000
But I went to work at an architecture firm,

42
0:02:08.723,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and eventually talked to my coworkers about it,

43
0:02:11.27,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and they loved the idea.

44
0:02:13.062,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And as we started talking to more people about it,

45
0:02:15.472,000 --> 0:02:17,000
more people wanted to hear about it.

46
0:02:17.889,000 --> 0:02:18,000
In the summer of 2001,

47
0:02:20.269,000 --> 0:02:21,000
we connected with Cathy Woolard,

48
0:02:21.92,000 --> 0:02:23,000
who was soon elected city council president.

49
0:02:24.075,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And we built a citywide vision around this idea:

50
0:02:27.525,000 --> 0:02:29,000
the Atlanta BeltLine, a 22-mile loop

51
0:02:30.48,000 --> 0:02:32,000
of transit and trails and transformation.

52
0:02:33.746,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I was doing two and three meetings a week for two and a half years,

53
0:02:38.083,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and so was Cathy and her staff and a handful of volunteers.

54
0:02:41.552,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Together, we built this amazing movement of people and ideas.

55
0:02:46.287,000 --> 0:02:49,000
It included community advocates who were used to fighting against things,

56
0:02:50.022,000 --> 0:02:53,000
but found the Atlanta BeltLine as something that they could fight for;

57
0:02:53.359,000 --> 0:02:54,000
developers who saw the opportunity

58
0:02:55.108,000 --> 0:02:57,000
to take advantage of a lot of new growth in the city;

59
0:02:58.067,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and dozens of nonprofit partners who saw their mission

60
0:03:02.737,000 --> 0:03:05,000
at least partly accomplished by the shared vision.

61
0:03:07.293,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Now, usually these groups of people aren't at the same table

62
0:03:11.142,000 --> 0:03:12,000
wanting the same outcome.

63
0:03:13.923,000 --> 0:03:15,000
But there we were, and it was kind of weird,

64
0:03:17.318,000 --> 0:03:19,000
but it was really, really powerful.

65
0:03:19.937,000 --> 0:03:21,000
The people of Atlanta fell in love with a vision

66
0:03:22.794,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that was better than what they saw through their car windshields,

67
0:03:26.122,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and the people of Atlanta made it happen,

68
0:03:28.648,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and I guarantee you we would not be building it otherwise.

69
0:03:32.476,000 --> 0:03:34,000
From the beginning, our coalition was diverse.

70
0:03:35.343,000 --> 0:03:38,000
People of all stripes were part of our story.

71
0:03:38.49,000 --> 0:03:41,000
People on the lower end of the economic spectrum loved it, too.

72
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
They were just afraid they weren't going to be able to be there

73
0:03:45.544,000 --> 0:03:47,000
when it got built, that they'd be priced out.

74
0:03:47.737,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And we've all heard that kind of story before, right?

75
0:03:51.852,000 --> 0:03:54,000
But we promised that the Atlanta BeltLine would be different,

76
0:03:54.938,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and people took ownership of the idea,

77
0:03:56.996,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and they made it better than anything we ever imagined

78
0:03:59.594,000 --> 0:04:,000
in the beginning,

79
0:04:00.819,000 --> 0:04:02,000
including significant subsidies for housing,

80
0:04:03.606,000 --> 0:04:08,000
new parks, art, an arboretum -- a list that continues to grow.

81
0:04:08.936,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And we put in place

82
0:04:10.126,000 --> 0:04:13,000
the organizations and agencies that were required to make it happen.

83
0:04:13.773,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And importantly, it is.

84
0:04:16.126,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Now we're in the early stages of implementation, and it's working.

85
0:04:19.918,000 --> 0:04:23,000
The first mainline section of trail was opened in 2012,

86
0:04:24.735,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and it's already generated over three billion dollars

87
0:04:27.416,000 --> 0:04:28,000
of private-sector investment.

88
0:04:30.784,000 --> 0:04:32,000
But it's not only changing the physical form of the city,

89
0:04:33.524,000 --> 0:04:35,000
it's changing the way we think about the city,

90
0:04:35.958,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and what our expectations are for living there.

91
0:04:40.171,000 --> 0:04:41,000
About a month ago,

92
0:04:41.838,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I had to take my kids with me to the grocery store

93
0:04:44.697,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and they were complaining about it,

94
0:04:46.393,000 --> 0:04:48,000
because they didn't want to get in the car.

95
0:04:48.465,000 --> 0:04:52,000
They were saying, "Dad, if we have to go,

96
0:04:52.489,000 --> 0:04:53,000
can we at least ride our bikes?"

97
0:04:54.242,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And I said, "Of course we can.

98
0:04:56.572,000 --> 0:04:58,000
That's what people in Atlanta do.

99
0:04:58.631,000 --> 0:05:,000
We ride our bikes to the grocery store."

100
0:05:01.074,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Laughter)

101
0:05:02.331,000 --> 0:05:03,000
(Applause)

102
0:05:03.955,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Thank you, yeah.

103
0:05:05.234,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Now, they don't know how ridiculous that is,

104
0:05:08.497,000 --> 0:05:09,000
but I do.

105
0:05:09.684,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And I also understand that their expectations for Atlanta

106
0:05:13.717,000 --> 0:05:14,000
are really powerful.

107
0:05:15.642,000 --> 0:05:18,000
This kind of transformation is exactly like sprawl

108
0:05:19.02,000 --> 0:05:2,000
in the last century,

109
0:05:20.647,000 --> 0:05:23,000
the movement where our investment in highways and automobiles

110
0:05:24.091,000 --> 0:05:26,000
fundamentally changed American life.

111
0:05:26.686,000 --> 0:05:28,000
That wasn't some grand conspiracy.

112
0:05:29.12,000 --> 0:05:31,000
There were conspiracies within it, of course.

113
0:05:32.044,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But it was a cultural momentum.

114
0:05:34.161,000 --> 0:05:36,000
It was millions of people making millions of decisions

115
0:05:36.754,000 --> 0:05:37,000
over an extended period of time,

116
0:05:38.37,000 --> 0:05:41,000
that fundamentally changed not only the way that we build cities,

117
0:05:42.156,000 --> 0:05:44,000
but it changed our expectations

118
0:05:44.194,000 --> 0:05:45,000
for our lives.

119
0:05:46.613,000 --> 0:05:49,000
These changes were the foundations for urban sprawl.

120
0:05:49.888,000 --> 0:05:51,000
We didn't call it sprawl at that time.

121
0:05:52.026,000 --> 0:05:53,000
We called it the future.

122
0:05:53.577,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And it was.

123
0:05:54.991,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And we got all the highways and strip malls and cul-de-sacs we wanted.

124
0:05:59.43,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It was a radical transformation,

125
0:06:01.82,000 --> 0:06:03,000
but it was built by a cultural momentum.

126
0:06:04.457,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So it's important to not separate

127
0:06:06.055,000 --> 0:06:08,000
the physical construction of the places we live

128
0:06:08.553,000 --> 0:06:1,000
from other things that are happening at that time.

129
0:06:11.268,000 --> 0:06:12,000
At that time,

130
0:06:12.82,000 --> 0:06:14,000
in the second half of the last century,

131
0:06:15.105,000 --> 0:06:16,000
science was curing disease

132
0:06:17.121,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and lifting us to the moon,

133
0:06:19.014,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and the sexual revolution was breaking down barriers,

134
0:06:21.569,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and the Civil Rights Movement began its march

135
0:06:23.705,000 --> 0:06:25,000
toward the fulfillment of our nation's promise.

136
0:06:26.664,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Television, entertainment, food, travel, business -- everything was changing,

137
0:06:31.425,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and both the public and private sectors were colluding

138
0:06:34.749,000 --> 0:06:36,000
to give us the lives we wanted.

139
0:06:38.041,000 --> 0:06:39,000
The Federal Highway Administration,

140
0:06:39.774,000 --> 0:06:42,000
for example, didn't exist before there were highways.

141
0:06:43.794,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Think about it.

142
0:06:44.996,000 --> 0:06:45,000
(Laughter)

143
0:06:46.044,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Of course, today it's important to understand and acknowledge

144
0:06:49.055,000 --> 0:06:51,000
that those benefits accrued to some groups of people

145
0:06:51.874,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and not to others.

146
0:06:53.17,000 --> 0:06:55,000
It was not an equitable cultural momentum.

147
0:06:56.692,000 --> 0:06:59,000
But when we look today in wonder and disgust, maybe,

148
0:07:00.382,000 --> 0:07:02,000
at the metropolis sprawl before us,

149
0:07:02.869,000 --> 0:07:03,000
we wonder if we're stuck.

150
0:07:05.067,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Are we stuck with the legacy of that inequity?

151
0:07:08.234,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Are we stuck with this dystopian traffic hellscape?

152
0:07:12.329,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Are we stuck with rampant urban displacement,

153
0:07:15.479,000 --> 0:07:17,000
with environmental degradation?

154
0:07:18.504,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Are we stuck with social isolation

155
0:07:21.061,000 --> 0:07:22,000
or political polarization?

156
0:07:23.399,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Are these the inevitable and permanent outcomes?

157
0:07:26.744,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Or are they the result of our collective cultural decisions

158
0:07:29.746,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that we've made for ourselves?

159
0:07:32.535,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And if they are,

160
0:07:34.658,000 --> 0:07:35,000
can't we change them?

161
0:07:36.803,000 --> 0:07:38,000
What I have learned from our experience in Atlanta

162
0:07:39.461,000 --> 0:07:4,000
is not an anomaly.

163
0:07:40.994,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Similar stories are playing out everywhere,

164
0:07:43.389,000 --> 0:07:45,000
where people are reclaiming not only old railroads,

165
0:07:46.226,000 --> 0:07:49,000
but also degraded urban waterways and obsolete roadways,

166
0:07:50.109,000 --> 0:07:52,000
reinventing all of the infrastructure

167
0:07:52.473,000 --> 0:07:53,000
in their lives.

168
0:07:53.836,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Whether here in New York

169
0:07:55.784,000 --> 0:07:56,000
or in Houston

170
0:07:57.044,000 --> 0:07:58,000
or Miami,

171
0:07:58.371,000 --> 0:08:,000
Detroit, Philadelphia,

172
0:08:01.058,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Seoul, Hong Kong, Singapore,

173
0:08:03.394,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Toronto and Paris,

174
0:08:05.055,000 --> 0:08:09,000
cities big and small all over the world are reclaiming and reinventing

175
0:08:09.207,000 --> 0:08:1,000
this infrastructure for themselves,

176
0:08:10.904,000 --> 0:08:14,000
including the mother of all catalyst infrastructure projects,

177
0:08:15.489,000 --> 0:08:16,000
the Los Angeles River,

178
0:08:17.485,000 --> 0:08:19,000
the revitalization effort for which similarly started

179
0:08:20.279,000 --> 0:08:21,000
as a grassroots movement,

180
0:08:21.677,000 --> 0:08:23,000
has developed into a cultural momentum,

181
0:08:24.037,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and is now in the early stages of being transformed

182
0:08:27.503,000 --> 0:08:3,000
into some kind of life-affirming infrastructure again,

183
0:08:30.832,000 --> 0:08:34,000
this one with trails and parks and fishing and boating

184
0:08:35.251,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and community revitalization,

185
0:08:37.21,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and of course, water quality and flood control.

186
0:08:40.29,000 --> 0:08:42,000
It's already improving the lives of people.

187
0:08:42.794,000 --> 0:08:45,000
It's already changing the way the rest of us think about Los Angeles.

188
0:08:47.246,000 --> 0:08:49,000
This is more than just infrastructure.

189
0:08:49.729,000 --> 0:08:51,000
We're building new lives for ourselves.

190
0:08:52.214,000 --> 0:08:55,000
It's a movement that includes local food, urban agriculture,

191
0:08:55.792,000 --> 0:08:57,000
craft beer, the maker movement,

192
0:08:58.062,000 --> 0:09:02,000
tech and design -- all of these things, early indicators of a really radical shift

193
0:09:02.865,000 --> 0:09:03,000
in the way we build cities.

194
0:09:05.132,000 --> 0:09:06,000
We're taking places like this

195
0:09:08.534,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and transforming them into this.

196
0:09:12.669,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And soon this.

197
0:09:15.063,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And this is all exciting and good.

198
0:09:18.436,000 --> 0:09:19,000
We're changing the world for the better.

199
0:09:20.426,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Good for us!

200
0:09:22.263,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And it is awesome -- I mean that.

201
0:09:24.956,000 --> 0:09:25,000
But our history of sprawl,

202
0:09:26.95,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and from what we can already see with these catalyst projects today,

203
0:09:30.91,000 --> 0:09:32,000
we know and must remember

204
0:09:33.118,000 --> 0:09:36,000
that big changes like this don't usually benefit everyone.

205
0:09:36.999,000 --> 0:09:39,000
The market forces unleashed by this cultural momentum

206
0:09:40.574,000 --> 0:09:42,000
often include the seemingly unstoppable

207
0:09:43.023,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and inevitable cycle of rising taxes, prices and rents.

208
0:09:47.933,000 --> 0:09:48,000
This is urgent.

209
0:09:49.332,000 --> 0:09:51,000
If we care, we have to stand up

210
0:09:51.498,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and speak out.

211
0:09:52.839,000 --> 0:09:53,000
This should be a call to action,

212
0:09:54.646,000 --> 0:09:57,000
because the answer can't be to not improve communities.

213
0:09:58.717,000 --> 0:10:02,000
The answer can't be to not build parks and transit and grocery stores.

214
0:10:03.215,000 --> 0:10:05,000
The answer can't be to hold communities down

215
0:10:06.152,000 --> 0:10:07,000
just to keep them affordable.

216
0:10:08.523,000 --> 0:10:11,000
But we do have to follow through and address the financial realities

217
0:10:11.824,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that we're facing.

218
0:10:13.078,000 --> 0:10:15,000
This is hard, and it won't happen on its own.

219
0:10:15.897,000 --> 0:10:17,000
We can do it, and I'm committed to this goal in Atlanta,

220
0:10:18.794,000 --> 0:10:22,000
to sticking up again for people who made it possible in the first place.

221
0:10:23.52,000 --> 0:10:25,000
We can't call it a success without them.

222
0:10:26.105,000 --> 0:10:27,000
I certainly can't,

223
0:10:27.436,000 --> 0:10:29,000
because the people I made commitments to all those years

224
0:10:30.392,000 --> 0:10:31,000
weren't abstract populations.

225
0:10:32.615,000 --> 0:10:33,000
They're my friends and neighbors.

226
0:10:34.459,000 --> 0:10:35,000
They're people that I love.

227
0:10:36.974,000 --> 0:10:38,000
So even though it started as my graduate thesis

228
0:10:39.532,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and I'm working hard for 16 years with thousands of people

229
0:10:42.528,000 --> 0:10:44,000
to help make this thing come to life,

230
0:10:44.702,000 --> 0:10:47,000
I know and believe that who the BeltLine is being built for

231
0:10:48.643,000 --> 0:10:5,000
is just as important as whether it's built at all.

232
0:10:52.065,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Not just in Atlanta,

233
0:10:53.944,000 --> 0:10:54,000
but locally and globally,

234
0:10:55.437,000 --> 0:10:56,000
we have to understand

235
0:10:57.606,000 --> 0:11:,000
this accountability to the people whose lives we are changing,

236
0:11:01.287,000 --> 0:11:02,000
because this is us.

237
0:11:03.418,000 --> 0:11:05,000
We are the lives we're talking about.

238
0:11:06.431,000 --> 0:11:07,000
These places aren't inevitable.

239
0:11:08.092,000 --> 0:11:1,000
The places we live aren't inevitable,

240
0:11:10.797,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and if we want something different, we just need to speak up.

241
0:11:13.839,000 --> 0:11:15,000
We have to ensure that change comes on our terms.

242
0:11:16.437,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And to do that,

243
0:11:17.616,000 --> 0:11:21,000
we have to participate actively in the process of shaping change.

244
0:11:22.547,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Thank you.

245
0:11:23.723,000 --> 0:11:24,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.884,000 --> 0:00:17,000
"Where are you from?" said the pale, tattooed man.

2
0:00:19.583,000 --> 0:00:22,000
"Where are you from?"

3
0:00:24.453,000 --> 0:00:27,000
It's September 21, 2001,

4
0:00:28.533,000 --> 0:00:33,000
10 days after the worst attack on America since World War II.

5
0:00:34.715,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Everyone wonders about the next plane.

6
0:00:38.94,000 --> 0:00:4,000
People are looking for scapegoats.

7
0:00:42.762,000 --> 0:00:45,000
The president, the night before, pledges to

8
0:00:46.49,000 --> 0:00:51,000
"bring our enemies to justice or bring justice to our enemies."

9
0:00:52.934,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And in the Dallas mini-mart,

10
0:00:58.493,000 --> 0:01:03,000
a Dallas mini-part surrounded by tire shops and strip joints

11
0:01:04.266,000 --> 0:01:08,000
a Bangladeshi immigrant works the register.

12
0:01:08.273,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Back home, Raisuddin Bhuiyan was a big man, an Air Force officer.

13
0:01:15.315,000 --> 0:01:18,000
But he dreamed of a fresh start in America.

14
0:01:18.919,000 --> 0:01:23,000
If he had to work briefly in a mini-mart to save up for I.T. classes

15
0:01:24.217,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and his wedding in two months, so be it.

16
0:01:27.605,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Then, on September 21, that tattooed man enters the mart.

17
0:01:32.785,000 --> 0:01:34,000
He holds a shotgun.

18
0:01:36.496,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Raisuddin knows the drill:

19
0:01:38.159,000 --> 0:01:4,000
puts cash on the counter.

20
0:01:42.058,000 --> 0:01:46,000
This time, the man doesn't touch the money.

21
0:01:46.519,000 --> 0:01:5,000
"Where are you from?" he asks.

22
0:01:50.99,000 --> 0:01:55,000
"Excuse me?" Raisuddin answers.

23
0:01:56.192,000 --> 0:02:,000
His accent betrays him.

24
0:02:00.317,000 --> 0:02:05,000
The tattooed man, a self-styled true American vigilante,

25
0:02:05.334,000 --> 0:02:09,000
shoots Raisuddin in revenge for 9/11.

26
0:02:10.083,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Raisuddin feels millions of bees stinging his face.

27
0:02:15.982,000 --> 0:02:21,000
In fact, dozens of scalding, birdshot pellets puncture his head.

28
0:02:22.279,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Behind the counter, he lays in blood.

29
0:02:25.859,000 --> 0:02:29,000
He cups a hand over his forehead to keep in the brains

30
0:02:30.35,000 --> 0:02:32,000
on which he'd gambled everything.

31
0:02:34.298,000 --> 0:02:4,000
He recites verses from the Koran, begging his God to live.

32
0:02:40.857,000 --> 0:02:44,000
He senses he is dying.

33
0:02:45.172,000 --> 0:02:47,000
He didn't die.

34
0:02:47.69,000 --> 0:02:5,000
His right eye left him.

35
0:02:51.006,000 --> 0:02:54,000
His fiancée left him.

36
0:02:54.591,000 --> 0:02:58,000
His landlord, the mini-mart owner, kicked him out.

37
0:02:58.691,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Soon he was homeless and 60,000 dollars in medical debt,

38
0:03:04.004,000 --> 0:03:08,000
including a fee for dialing for an ambulance.

39
0:03:09.996,000 --> 0:03:11,000
But Raisuddin lived.

40
0:03:12.458,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And years later, he would ask what he could do to repay his God

41
0:03:18.453,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and become worthy of this second chance.

42
0:03:21.792,000 --> 0:03:23,000
He would come to believe, in fact,

43
0:03:23.883,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that this chance called for him to give a second chance

44
0:03:29.611,000 --> 0:03:33,000
to a man we might think deserved no chance at all.

45
0:03:35.544,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Twelve years ago, I was a fresh graduate seeking my way in the world.

46
0:03:41.632,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Born in Ohio to Indian immigrants,

47
0:03:44.132,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I settled on the ultimate rebellion against my parents,

48
0:03:47.399,000 --> 0:03:52,000
moving to the country they had worked so damn hard to get out of.

49
0:03:52.429,000 --> 0:03:57,000
What I thought might be a six-month stint in Mumbai stretched to six years.

50
0:03:58.02,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I became a writer and found myself amid a magical story:

51
0:04:02.665,000 --> 0:04:06,000
the awakening of hope across much of the so-called Third World.

52
0:04:07.182,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Six years ago, I returned to America and realized something:

53
0:04:12.238,000 --> 0:04:15,000
The American Dream was thriving,

54
0:04:15.302,000 --> 0:04:18,000
but only in India.

55
0:04:18.825,000 --> 0:04:21,000
In America, not so much.

56
0:04:22.27,000 --> 0:04:25,000
In fact, I observed that America was fracturing

57
0:04:26.093,000 --> 0:04:28,000
into two distinct societies:

58
0:04:28.327,000 --> 0:04:32,000
a republic of dreams and a republic of fears.

59
0:04:32.966,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And then, I stumbled onto this incredible tale of two lives

60
0:04:36.317,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and of these two Americas that brutally collided in that Dallas mini-mart.

61
0:04:43.64,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I knew at once I wanted to learn more,

62
0:04:46.041,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and eventually that I would write a book about them,

63
0:04:48.812,000 --> 0:04:51,000
for their story was the story of America's fracturing

64
0:04:52.694,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and of how it might be put back together.

65
0:04:58.28,000 --> 0:05:01,000
After he was shot, Raisuddin's life grew no easier.

66
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
The day after admitting him, the hospital discharged him.

67
0:05:06.96,000 --> 0:05:07,000
His right eye couldn't see.

68
0:05:08.938,000 --> 0:05:09,000
He couldn't speak.

69
0:05:10.546,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Metal peppered his face.

70
0:05:13.665,000 --> 0:05:17,000
But he had no insurance, so they bounced him.

71
0:05:17.846,000 --> 0:05:21,000
His family in Bangladesh begged him, "Come home."

72
0:05:23.07,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But he told them he had a dream to see about.

73
0:05:27.148,000 --> 0:05:29,000
He found telemarketing work,

74
0:05:29.699,000 --> 0:05:32,000
then he became an Olive Garden waiter,

75
0:05:32.974,000 --> 0:05:36,000
because where better to get over his fear of white people than the Olive Garden?

76
0:05:37.094,000 --> 0:05:4,000
(Laughter)

77
0:05:40.434,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Now, as a devout Muslim, he refused alcohol,

78
0:05:44.991,000 --> 0:05:46,000
didn't touch the stuff.

79
0:05:47.188,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Then he learned that not selling it would slash his pay.

80
0:05:52.215,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So he reasoned, like a budding American pragmatist,

81
0:05:56.006,000 --> 0:06:,000
"Well, God wouldn't want me to starve, would he?"

82
0:06:00.138,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And before long, in some months, Raisuddin was that Olive Garden's

83
0:06:03.406,000 --> 0:06:07,000
highest grossing alcohol pusher.

84
0:06:07.477,000 --> 0:06:1,000
He found a man who taught him database administration.

85
0:06:11.364,000 --> 0:06:13,000
He got part-time I.T. gigs.

86
0:06:13.486,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Eventually, he landed a six-figure job at a blue chip tech company in Dallas.

87
0:06:20.048,000 --> 0:06:24,000
But as America began to work for Raisuddin,

88
0:06:24.816,000 --> 0:06:28,000
he avoided the classic error of the fortunate:

89
0:06:28.853,000 --> 0:06:31,000
assuming you're the rule, not the exception.

90
0:06:32.777,000 --> 0:06:37,000
In fact, he observed that many with the fortune of being born American

91
0:06:38.576,000 --> 0:06:44,000
were nonetheless trapped in lives that made second chances like his impossible.

92
0:06:45.298,000 --> 0:06:48,000
He saw it at the Olive Garden itself,

93
0:06:48.729,000 --> 0:06:51,000
where so many of his colleagues had childhood horror stories

94
0:06:52.239,000 --> 0:06:56,000
of family dysfunction, chaos, addiction, crime.

95
0:06:56.956,000 --> 0:07:,000
He'd heard a similar tale about the man who shot him

96
0:07:01.407,000 --> 0:07:03,000
back when he attended his trial.

97
0:07:04.059,000 --> 0:07:09,000
The closer Raisuddin got to the America he had coveted from afar,

98
0:07:09.789,000 --> 0:07:13,000
the more he realized there was another, equally real, America

99
0:07:13.973,000 --> 0:07:17,000
that was stingier with second chances.

100
0:07:19.595,000 --> 0:07:25,000
The man who shot Raisuddin grew up in that stingier America.

101
0:07:25.89,000 --> 0:07:3,000
From a distance, Mark Stroman was always the spark of parties,

102
0:07:30.98,000 --> 0:07:33,000
always making girls feel pretty.

103
0:07:34.543,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Always working, no matter what drugs or fights he'd had the night before.

104
0:07:39.139,000 --> 0:07:43,000
But he'd always wrestled with demons.

105
0:07:43.244,000 --> 0:07:45,000
He entered the world through the three gateways

106
0:07:45.749,000 --> 0:07:47,000
that doom so many young American men:

107
0:07:48.471,000 --> 0:07:52,000
bad parents, bad schools, bad prisons.

108
0:07:53.34,000 --> 0:07:56,000
His mother told him, regretfully, as a boy

109
0:07:56.871,000 --> 0:08:01,000
that she'd been just 50 dollars short of aborting him.

110
0:08:02.214,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Sometimes, that little boy would be at school,

111
0:08:08.078,000 --> 0:08:12,000
he'd suddenly pull a knife on his fellow classmates.

112
0:08:12.579,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Sometimes that same little boy would be at his grandparents',

113
0:08:16.187,000 --> 0:08:18,000
tenderly feeding horses.

114
0:08:18.934,000 --> 0:08:2,000
He was getting arrested before he shaved,

115
0:08:21.379,000 --> 0:08:23,000
first juvenile, then prison.

116
0:08:23.805,000 --> 0:08:26,000
He became a casual white supremacist

117
0:08:26.944,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and, like so many around him, a drug-addled and absent father.

118
0:08:32.656,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And then, before long, he found himself on death row,

119
0:08:37.564,000 --> 0:08:43,000
for in his 2001 counter-jihad, he had shot not one mini-mart clerk,

120
0:08:43.688,000 --> 0:08:44,000
but three.

121
0:08:45.596,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Only Raisuddin survived.

122
0:08:48.944,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Strangely, death row was the first institution

123
0:08:53.808,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that left Stroman better.

124
0:08:57.341,000 --> 0:08:59,000
His old influences quit him.

125
0:08:59.569,000 --> 0:09:02,000
The people entering his life were virtuous and caring:

126
0:09:03.225,000 --> 0:09:07,000
pastors, journalists, European pen-pals.

127
0:09:07.989,000 --> 0:09:13,000
They listened to him, prayed with him, helped him question himself.

128
0:09:14.282,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And sent him on a journey of introspection and betterment.

129
0:09:19.428,000 --> 0:09:23,000
He finally faced the hatred that had defined his life.

130
0:09:24.362,000 --> 0:09:26,000
He read Viktor Frankl, the Holocaust survivor

131
0:09:27.253,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and regretted his swastika tattoos.

132
0:09:30.633,000 --> 0:09:32,000
He found God.

133
0:09:32.925,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Then one day in 2011, 10 years after his crimes,

134
0:09:37.152,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Stroman received news.

135
0:09:39.591,000 --> 0:09:46,000
One of the men he'd shot, the survivor, was fighting to save his life.

136
0:09:47.384,000 --> 0:09:52,000
You see, late in 2009, eight years after that shooting,

137
0:09:53.173,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Raisuddin had gone on his own journey, a pilgrimage to Mecca.

138
0:09:59.196,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Amid its crowds, he felt immense gratitude,

139
0:10:03.45,000 --> 0:10:04,000
but also duty.

140
0:10:05.245,000 --> 0:10:08,000
He recalled promising God, as he lay dying in 2001,

141
0:10:09.034,000 --> 0:10:14,000
that if he lived, he would serve humanity all his days.

142
0:10:14.234,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Then, he'd gotten busy relaying the bricks of a life.

143
0:10:19.529,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Now it was time to pay his debts.

144
0:10:23.982,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And he decided, upon reflection, that his method of payment

145
0:10:27.872,000 --> 0:10:3,000
would be an intervention in the cycle of vengeance

146
0:10:31.135,000 --> 0:10:33,000
between the Muslim and Western worlds.

147
0:10:33.994,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And how would he intervene?

148
0:10:36.689,000 --> 0:10:4,000
By forgiving Stroman publicly in the name of Islam

149
0:10:40.991,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and its doctrine of mercy.

150
0:10:42.731,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And then suing the state of Texas and its governor Rick Perry

151
0:10:49.292,000 --> 0:10:52,000
to prevent them from executing Stroman,

152
0:10:52.997,000 --> 0:10:55,000
exactly like most people shot in the face do.

153
0:10:56.111,000 --> 0:10:58,000
(Laughter)

154
0:10:58.475,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Yet Raisuddin's mercy was inspired not only by faith.

155
0:11:05.701,000 --> 0:11:11,000
A newly minted American citizen, he had come to believe that Stroman

156
0:11:11.759,000 --> 0:11:17,000
was the product of a hurting America that couldn't just be lethally injected away.

157
0:11:18.739,000 --> 0:11:22,000
That insight is what moved me to write my book "The True American."

158
0:11:23.204,000 --> 0:11:27,000
This immigrant begging America to be as merciful to a native son

159
0:11:27.851,000 --> 0:11:3,000
as it had been to an adopted one.

160
0:11:32.768,000 --> 0:11:34,000
In the mini-mart, all those years earlier,

161
0:11:35.621,000 --> 0:11:39,000
not just two men, but two Americas collided.

162
0:11:40.047,000 --> 0:11:42,000
An America that still dreams, still strives,

163
0:11:42.968,000 --> 0:11:46,000
still imagines that tomorrow can build on today,

164
0:11:47.047,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and an America that has resigned to fate,

165
0:11:50.146,000 --> 0:11:53,000
buckled under stress and chaos, lowered expectations,

166
0:11:53.28,000 --> 0:11:56,000
an ducked into the oldest of refuges:

167
0:11:56.418,000 --> 0:11:59,000
the tribal fellowship of one's own narrow kind.

168
0:12:00.218,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And it was Raisuddin, despite being a newcomer,

169
0:12:02.888,000 --> 0:12:03,000
despite being attacked,

170
0:12:04.215,000 --> 0:12:06,000
despite being homeless and traumatized,

171
0:12:07.088,000 --> 0:12:1,000
who belonged to that republic of dreams

172
0:12:10.492,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and Stroman who belonged to that other wounded country,

173
0:12:15.103,000 --> 0:12:2,000
despite being born with the privilege of a native white man.

174
0:12:20.418,000 --> 0:12:26,000
I realized these men's stories formed an urgent parable about America.

175
0:12:26.704,000 --> 0:12:3,000
The country I am so proud to call my own

176
0:12:30.723,000 --> 0:12:33,000
wasn't living through a generalized decline

177
0:12:34.589,000 --> 0:12:41,000
as seen in Spain or Greece, where prospects were dimming for everyone.

178
0:12:41.683,000 --> 0:12:45,000
America is simultaneously the most and the least successful country

179
0:12:46.68,000 --> 0:12:48,000
in the industrialized world.

180
0:12:49.027,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Launching the world's best companies,

181
0:12:51.571,000 --> 0:12:54,000
even as record numbers of children go hungry.

182
0:12:54.97,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Seeing life-expectancy drop for large groups,

183
0:12:59.125,000 --> 0:13:02,000
even as it polishes the world's best hospitals.

184
0:13:02.831,000 --> 0:13:06,000
America today is a sprightly young body,

185
0:13:07.134,000 --> 0:13:12,000
hit by one of those strokes that sucks the life from one side,

186
0:13:12.952,000 --> 0:13:15,000
while leaving the other worryingly perfect.

187
0:13:17.43,000 --> 0:13:23,000
On July 20, 2011, right after a sobbing Raisuddin

188
0:13:24.056,000 --> 0:13:26,000
testified in defense of Stroman's life,

189
0:13:26.355,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Stroman was killed by lethal injection by the state he so loved.

190
0:13:32.679,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Hours earlier, when Raisuddin still thought he could still save Stroman,

191
0:13:37.232,000 --> 0:13:39,000
the two men got to speak for the second time ever.

192
0:13:40.2,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Here is an excerpt from their phone call.

193
0:13:43.592,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Raisuddin: "Mark, you should know that I am praying for God,

194
0:13:49.45,000 --> 0:13:52,000
the most compassionate and gracious.

195
0:13:52.493,000 --> 0:13:54,000
I forgive you and I do not hate you.

196
0:13:54.961,000 --> 0:13:56,000
I never hated you."

197
0:13:57.952,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Stroman: "You are a remarkable person.

198
0:14:02.396,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Thank you from my heart.

199
0:14:04.513,000 --> 0:14:06,000
I love you, bro."

200
0:14:07.4,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Even more amazingly, after the execution,

201
0:14:11.318,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Raisuddin reached out to Stroman's eldest daughter, Amber,

202
0:14:15.53,000 --> 0:14:17,000
an ex-convinct and an addict.

203
0:14:18.273,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and offered his help.

204
0:14:20.06,000 --> 0:14:22,000
"You may have lost a father," he told her,

205
0:14:23.058,000 --> 0:14:26,000
"but you've gained an uncle."

206
0:14:26.6,000 --> 0:14:31,000
He wanted her, too, to have a second chance.

207
0:14:32.483,000 --> 0:14:37,000
If human history were a parade,

208
0:14:37.618,000 --> 0:14:43,000
America's float would be a neon shrine to second chances.

209
0:14:44.325,000 --> 0:14:49,000
But America, generous with second chances to the children of other lands,

210
0:14:50.025,000 --> 0:14:56,000
today grows miserly with first chances to the children of its own.

211
0:14:56.241,000 --> 0:15:,000
America still dazzles at allowing anybody to become an American.

212
0:15:01.168,000 --> 0:15:07,000
But it is losing its luster at allowing every American to become a somebody.

213
0:15:07.811,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Over the last decade, seven million foreigners gained American citizenship.

214
0:15:12.583,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Remarkable.

215
0:15:14.607,000 --> 0:15:19,000
In the meanwhile, how many Americans gained a place in the middle class?

216
0:15:19.912,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Actually, the net influx was negative.

217
0:15:23.682,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Go back further, and it's even more striking:

218
0:15:25.981,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Since the 60s, the middle class has shrunk by 20 percent,

219
0:15:31.212,000 --> 0:15:34,000
mainly because of the people tumbling out of it.

220
0:15:34.564,000 --> 0:15:37,000
And my reporting around the country tells me the problem is grimmer

221
0:15:38.226,000 --> 0:15:4,000
than simple inequality.

222
0:15:40.639,000 --> 0:15:45,000
What I observe is a pair of secessions from the unifying center of American life.

223
0:15:46.574,000 --> 0:15:49,000
An affluent secession of up, up and away,

224
0:15:50.102,000 --> 0:15:53,000
into elite enclaves of the educated and into a global matrix

225
0:15:53.534,000 --> 0:15:55,000
of work, money and connections,

226
0:15:56.317,000 --> 0:16:,000
and an impoverished secession of down and out

227
0:16:00.415,000 --> 0:16:02,000
into disconnected, dead-end lives

228
0:16:03.159,000 --> 0:16:07,000
that the fortunate scarcely see.

229
0:16:07.183,000 --> 0:16:12,000
And don't console yourself that you are the 99 percent.

230
0:16:13.918,000 --> 0:16:17,000
If you live near a Whole Foods,

231
0:16:18.504,000 --> 0:16:21,000
if no one in your family serves in the military,

232
0:16:22.167,000 --> 0:16:27,000
if you're paid by the year, not the hour,

233
0:16:27.386,000 --> 0:16:3,000
if most people you know finished college,

234
0:16:30.783,000 --> 0:16:32,000
if no one you know uses meth,

235
0:16:33.105,000 --> 0:16:35,000
if you married once and remain married,

236
0:16:35.285,000 --> 0:16:39,000
if you're not one of 65 million Americans with a criminal record --

237
0:16:39.627,000 --> 0:16:42,000
if any or all of these things describe you,

238
0:16:43.409,000 --> 0:16:45,000
then accept the possibility that actually,

239
0:16:46.276,000 --> 0:16:48,000
you may not know what's going on

240
0:16:48.699,000 --> 0:16:53,000
and you may be part of the problem.

241
0:16:54.588,000 --> 0:16:59,000
Other generations had to build a fresh society after slavery,

242
0:17:00.576,000 --> 0:17:04,000
pull through a depression, defeat fascism,

243
0:17:04.84,000 --> 0:17:06,000
freedom-ride in Mississippi.

244
0:17:07.569,000 --> 0:17:09,000
The moral challenge of my generation, I believe,

245
0:17:10.096,000 --> 0:17:13,000
is to reacquaint these two Americas,

246
0:17:13.213,000 --> 0:17:18,000
to choose union over secession once again.

247
0:17:18.392,000 --> 0:17:21,000
This ins't a problem we can tax or tax-cut away.

248
0:17:22.337,000 --> 0:17:26,000
It won't be solved by tweeting harder, building slicker apps,

249
0:17:26.527,000 --> 0:17:3,000
or starting one more artisanal coffee roasting service.

250
0:17:30.965,000 --> 0:17:36,000
It is a moral challenge that begs each of us in the flourishing America

251
0:17:37.232,000 --> 0:17:41,000
to take on the wilting America as our own,

252
0:17:41.327,000 --> 0:17:44,000
as Raisuddin tried to do.

253
0:17:44.342,000 --> 0:17:46,000
Like him, we can make pilgrimages.

254
0:17:46.923,000 --> 0:17:49,000
And there, in Baltimore and Oregon and Appalachia,

255
0:17:50.446,000 --> 0:17:52,000
find new purpose, as he did.

256
0:17:52.938,000 --> 0:17:55,000
We can immerse ourselves in that other country,

257
0:17:56.197,000 --> 0:17:59,000
bear witness to its hopes and sorrows,

258
0:17:59.974,000 --> 0:18:05,000
and, like Raisuddin, ask what we can do.

259
0:18:06.829,000 --> 0:18:09,000
What can you do?

260
0:18:09.955,000 --> 0:18:1,000
What can you do?

261
0:18:11.706,000 --> 0:18:12,000
What can we do?

262
0:18:13.679,000 --> 0:18:18,000
How might we build a more merciful country?

263
0:18:18.726,000 --> 0:18:22,000
We, the greatest inventors in the world,

264
0:18:22.933,000 --> 0:18:27,000
can invent solutions to the problems of that America, not only our own.

265
0:18:27.948,000 --> 0:18:3,000
We, the writers and the journalists, can cover that America's stories,

266
0:18:31.35,000 --> 0:18:34,000
instead of shutting down bureaus in its midst.

267
0:18:34.946,000 --> 0:18:37,000
We can finance that America's ideas,

268
0:18:38.19,000 --> 0:18:41,000
instead of ideas from New York and San Francisco.

269
0:18:41.405,000 --> 0:18:43,000
We can put our stethoscopes to its backs,

270
0:18:44.25,000 --> 0:18:5,000
teach there, go to court there, make there, live there, pray there.

271
0:18:50.475,000 --> 0:18:54,000
This, I believe, is the calling of a generation.

272
0:18:55.272,000 --> 0:18:58,000
An America whose two halves learn again

273
0:18:58.758,000 --> 0:19:03,000
to stride, to plow, to forge, to dare together.

274
0:19:06.374,000 --> 0:19:11,000
A republic of chances, rewoven, renewed,

275
0:19:12.099,000 --> 0:19:15,000
begins with us.

276
0:19:15.777,000 --> 0:19:16,000
Thank you.

277
0:19:17.616,000 --> 0:19:21,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Why can't we solve these problems?

2
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
We know what they are.

3
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Something always seems to stop us.

4
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Why?

5
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I remember March the 15th, 2000.

6
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
The B15 iceberg broke off the Ross Ice Shelf.

7
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
In the newspaper it said

8
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
"it was all part of a normal process."

9
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
A little bit further on in the article

10
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
it said "a loss that would normally take

11
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
the ice shelf 50-100 years to replace."

12
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
That same word, "normal,"

13
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
had two different,

14
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
almost opposite meanings.

15
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
If we walk into the B15 iceberg

16
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
when we leave here today,

17
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
we're going to bump into something

18
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
a thousand feet tall,

19
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
76 miles long,

20
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
17 miles wide,

21
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and it's going to weigh two gigatons.

22
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I'm sorry, there's nothing normal about this.

23
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And yet I think it's this perspective of us

24
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
as humans to look at our world

25
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
through the lens of normal

26
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
is one of the forces

27
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
that stops us developing real solutions.

28
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Only 90 days after this,

29
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
arguably the greatest discovery

30
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
of the last century occurred.

31
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
It was the sequencing for the first time

32
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
of the human genome.

33
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
This is the code that's in every single one

34
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
of our 50 trillion cells

35
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
that makes us who we are and what we are.

36
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And if we just take one cell's worth

37
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
of this code and unwind it,

38
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
it's a meter long,

39
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
two nanometers thick.

40
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Two nanometers is 20 atoms in thickness.

41
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And I wondered,

42
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
what if the answer to some of our biggest problems

43
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
could be found in the smallest of places,

44
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
where the difference between what is

45
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
valuable and what is worthless

46
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
is merely the addition or subtraction

47
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
of a few atoms?

48
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And what

49
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
if we could get exquisite control

50
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
over the essence of energy,

51
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
the electron?

52
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So I started to go around the world

53
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
finding the best and brightest scientists

54
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I could at universities

55
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
whose collective discoveries have the chance

56
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
to take us there,

57
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and we formed a company to build

58
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
on their extraordinary ideas.

59
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Six and a half years later,

60
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
a hundred and eighty researchers,

61
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
they have some amazing developments

62
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
in the lab,

63
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and I will show you three of those today,

64
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
such that we can stop burning up our planet

65
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and instead,

66
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
we can generate all the energy we need

67
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
right where we are,

68
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
cleanly, safely, and cheaply.

69
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Think of the space that we spend

70
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
most of our time.

71
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
A tremendous amount of energy

72
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
is coming at us from the sun.

73
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We like the light that comes into the room,

74
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
but in the middle of summer,

75
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
all that heat is coming into the room

76
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that we're trying to keep cool.

77
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
In winter, exactly the opposite is happening.

78
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
We're trying to heat up

79
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
the space that we're in,

80
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and all that is trying to get out through the window.

81
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Wouldn't it be really great

82
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
if the window could flick back the heat

83
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
into the room if we needed it

84
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
or flick it away before it came in?

85
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
One of the materials that can do this

86
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
is a remarkable material, carbon,

87
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that has changed its form in this incredibly beautiful reaction

88
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
where graphite is blasted by a vapor,

89
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and when the vaporized carbon condenses,

90
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
it condenses back into a different form:

91
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
chickenwire rolled up.

92
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
But this chickenwire carbon,

93
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
called a carbon nanotube,

94
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
is a hundred thousand times smaller

95
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
than the width of one of your hairs.

96
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
It's a thousand times

97
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
more conductive than copper.

98
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
How is that possible?

99
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
One of the things about working at the nanoscale

100
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
is things look and act very differently.

101
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
You think of carbon as black.

102
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Carbon at the nanoscale

103
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
is actually transparent

104
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and flexible.

105
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And when it's in this form,

106
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
if I combine it with a polymer

107
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and affix it to your window

108
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
when it's in its colored state,

109
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
it will reflect away all heat and light,

110
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and when it's in its bleached state

111
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
it will let all the light and heat through

112
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and any combination in between.

113
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
To change its state, by the way,

114
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
takes two volts from a millisecond pulse.

115
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And once you've changed its state, it stays there

116
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
until you change its state again.

117
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
As we were working on this incredible

118
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
discovery at University of Florida,

119
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
we were told to go down the corridor

120
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
to visit another scientist,

121
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and he was working

122
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
on a pretty incredible thing.

123
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Imagine

124
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
if we didn't have to rely

125
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
on artificial lighting to get around at night.

126
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
We'd have to see at night, right?

127
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
This lets you do it.

128
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
It's a nanomaterial, two nanomaterials,

129
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
a detector and an imager.

130
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
The total width of it

131
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
is 600 times smaller

132
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
than the width of a decimal place.

133
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And it takes all the infrared available at night,

134
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
converts it into an electron

135
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
in the space of two small films,

136
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and is enabling you to play an image

137
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
which you can see through.

138
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I'm going to show to TEDsters,

139
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
the first time, this operating.

140
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Firstly I'm going to show you

141
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
the transparency.

142
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Transparency is key.

143
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
It's a film that you can look through.

144
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And then I'm going to turn the lights out.

145
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And you can see, off a tiny film,

146
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
incredible clarity.

147
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
As we were working on this, it dawned on us:

148
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
this is taking infrared radiation, wavelengths,

149
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and converting it into electrons.

150
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
What if we combined it

151
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
with this?

152
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Suddenly you've converted energy

153
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
into an electron on a plastic surface

154
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
that you can stick on your window.

155
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
But because it's flexible,

156
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
it can be on any surface whatsoever.

157
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
The power plant of tomorrow

158
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
is no power plant.

159
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
We talked about generating and using.

160
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
We want to talk about storing energy,

161
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and unfortunately

162
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
the best thing we've got going

163
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
is something that was developed in France

164
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
a hundred and fifty years ago,

165
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
the lead acid battery.

166
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
In terms of dollars per what's stored,

167
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
it's simply the best.

168
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Knowing that we're not going to put fifty of

169
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
these in our basements to store our power,

170
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
we went to a group at University of Texas at Dallas,

171
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and we gave them this diagram.

172
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
It was in actually a diner

173
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
outside of Dallas/Fort Worth Airport.

174
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
We said, "Could you build this?"

175
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And these scientists,

176
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
instead of laughing at us, said, "Yeah."

177
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And what they built was eBox.

178
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
EBox is testing new nanomaterials

179
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
to park an electron on the outside,

180
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
hold it until you need it,

181
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and then be able to release it and pass it off.

182
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Being able to do that means

183
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
that I can generate energy

184
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
cleanly, efficiently and cheaply

185
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
right where I am.

186
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
It's my energy.

187
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And if I don't need it, I can convert it

188
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
back up on the window

189
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to energy, light, and beam it,

190
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
line of site, to your place.

191
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And for that I do not need

192
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
an electric grid between us.

193
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
The grid of tomorrow is no grid,

194
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and energy, clean efficient energy,

195
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
will one day be free.

196
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
If you do this, you get the last puzzle piece,

197
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
which is water.

198
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Each of us, every day,

199
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
need just eight glasses of this,

200
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
because we're human.

201
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
When we run out of water,

202
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
as we are in some parts of the world

203
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and soon to be in other parts of the world,

204
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
we're going to have to get this from the sea,

205
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and that's going to require us to build desalination plants.

206
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
19 trillion dollars is what we're going to have to spend.

207
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
These also require tremendous amounts of energy.

208
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
In fact, it's going to require twice the world's

209
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
supply of oil to run the pumps

210
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
to generate the water.

211
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
We're simply not going to do that.

212
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
But in a world where energy is freed

213
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and transmittable

214
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
easily and cheaply, we can take any water

215
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
wherever we are

216
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and turn it into whatever we need.

217
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I'm glad to be working with

218
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
incredibly brilliant and kind scientists,

219
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
no kinder than

220
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
many of the people in the world,

221
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
but they have a magic look at the world.

222
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
And I'm glad to see their discoveries

223
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
coming out of the lab and into the world.

224
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
It's been a long time in coming for me.

225
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
18 years ago,

226
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
I saw a photograph in the paper.

227
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
It was taken by Kevin Carter

228
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
who went to the Sudan

229
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
to document their famine there.

230
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
I've carried this photograph with me

231
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
every day since then.

232
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
It's a picture of a little girl dying of thirst.

233
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
By any standard this is wrong.

234
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
It's just wrong.

235
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
We can do better than this.

236
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
We should do better than this.

237
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And whenever I go round

238
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
to somebody who says,

239
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
"You know what, you're working on something that's too difficult.

240
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
It'll never happen. You don't have enough money.

241
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
You don't have enough time.

242
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
There's something much more interesting around the corner,"

243
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
I say, "Try saying that to her."

244
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
That's what I say in my mind. And I just say

245
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
"thank you," and I go on to the next one.

246
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
This is why we have to solve our problems,

247
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and I know the answer as to how

248
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
is to be able to get exquisite control

249
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
over a building block of nature,

250
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
the stuff of life:

251
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
the simple electron.

252
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Thank you.

253
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
(Applause)

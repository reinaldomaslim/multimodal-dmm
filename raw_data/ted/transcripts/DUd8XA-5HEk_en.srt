1
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I want to start my talk today with two observations

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
about the human species.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
The first observation is something that you might think is quite obvious,

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and that's that our species, Homo sapiens,

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
is actually really, really smart --

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
like, ridiculously smart --

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
like you're all doing things

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
that no other species on the planet does right now.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And this is, of course,

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
not the first time you've probably recognized this.

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Of course, in addition to being smart, we're also an extremely vain species.

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So we like pointing out the fact that we're smart.

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
You know, so I could turn to pretty much any sage

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
from Shakespeare to Stephen Colbert

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
to point out things like the fact that

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
we're noble in reason and infinite in faculties

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and just kind of awesome-er than anything else on the planet

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
when it comes to all things cerebral.

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
But of course, there's a second observation about the human species

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that I want to focus on a little bit more,

21
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and that's the fact that

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
even though we're actually really smart, sometimes uniquely smart,

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
we can also be incredibly, incredibly dumb

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
when it comes to some aspects of our decision making.

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Now I'm seeing lots of smirks out there.

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Don't worry, I'm not going to call anyone in particular out

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
on any aspects of your own mistakes.

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
But of course, just in the last two years

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
we see these unprecedented examples of human ineptitude.

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And we've watched as the tools we uniquely make

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
to pull the resources out of our environment

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
kind of just blow up in our face.

33
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
We've watched the financial markets that we uniquely create --

34
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
these markets that were supposed to be foolproof --

35
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
we've watched them kind of collapse before our eyes.

36
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
But both of these two embarrassing examples, I think,

37
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
don't highlight what I think is most embarrassing

38
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
about the mistakes that humans make,

39
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
which is that we'd like to think that the mistakes we make

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
are really just the result of a couple bad apples

41
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
or a couple really sort of FAIL Blog-worthy decisions.

42
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
But it turns out, what social scientists are actually learning

43
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
is that most of us, when put in certain contexts,

44
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
will actually make very specific mistakes.

45
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
The errors we make are actually predictable.

46
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
We make them again and again.

47
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And they're actually immune to lots of evidence.

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
When we get negative feedback,

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
we still, the next time we're face with a certain context,

50
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
tend to make the same errors.

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And so this has been a real puzzle to me

52
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
as a sort of scholar of human nature.

53
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
What I'm most curious about is,

54
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
how is a species that's as smart as we are

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
capable of such bad

56
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and such consistent errors all the time?

57
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
You know, we're the smartest thing out there, why can't we figure this out?

58
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
In some sense, where do our mistakes really come from?

59
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And having thought about this a little bit, I see a couple different possibilities.

60
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
One possibility is, in some sense, it's not really our fault.

61
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Because we're a smart species,

62
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
we can actually create all kinds of environments

63
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that are super, super complicated,

64
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
sometimes too complicated for us to even actually understand,

65
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
even though we've actually created them.

66
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
We create financial markets that are super complex.

67
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
We create mortgage terms that we can't actually deal with.

68
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And of course, if we are put in environments where we can't deal with it,

69
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
in some sense makes sense that we actually

70
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
might mess certain things up.

71
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
If this was the case, we'd have a really easy solution

72
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
to the problem of human error.

73
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
We'd actually just say, okay, let's figure out

74
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
the kinds of technologies we can't deal with,

75
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
the kinds of environments that are bad --

76
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
get rid of those, design things better,

77
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and we should be the noble species

78
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
that we expect ourselves to be.

79
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But there's another possibility that I find a little bit more worrying,

80
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
which is, maybe it's not our environments that are messed up.

81
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Maybe it's actually us that's designed badly.

82
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
This is a hint that I've gotten

83
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
from watching the ways that social scientists have learned about human errors.

84
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And what we see is that people tend to keep making errors

85
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
exactly the same way, over and over again.

86
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
It feels like we might almost just be built

87
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
to make errors in certain ways.

88
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
This is a possibility that I worry a little bit more about,

89
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
because, if it's us that's messed up,

90
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
it's not actually clear how we go about dealing with it.

91
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
We might just have to accept the fact that we're error prone

92
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and try to design things around it.

93
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So this is the question my students and I wanted to get at.

94
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
How can we tell the difference between possibility one and possibility two?

95
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
What we need is a population

96
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
that's basically smart, can make lots of decisions,

97
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
but doesn't have access to any of the systems we have,

98
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
any of the things that might mess us up --

99
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
no human technology, human culture,

100
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
maybe even not human language.

101
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And so this is why we turned to these guys here.

102
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
These are one of the guys I work with. This is a brown capuchin monkey.

103
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
These guys are New World primates,

104
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
which means they broke off from the human branch

105
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
about 35 million years ago.

106
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
This means that your great, great, great great, great, great --

107
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
with about five million "greats" in there --

108
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
grandmother was probably the same great, great, great, great

109
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
grandmother with five million "greats" in there

110
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
as Holly up here.

111
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
You know, so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really distant,

112
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
but albeit evolutionary, relative.

113
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
The good news about Holly though is that

114
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
she doesn't actually have the same kinds of technologies we do.

115
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
You know, she's a smart, very cut creature, a primate as well,

116
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
but she lacks all the stuff we think might be messing us up.

117
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
So she's the perfect test case.

118
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
What if we put Holly into the same context as humans?

119
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Does she make the same mistakes as us?

120
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Does she not learn from them? And so on.

121
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
And so this is the kind of thing we decided to do.

122
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
My students and I got very excited about this a few years ago.

123
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
We said, all right, let's, you know, throw so problems at Holly,

124
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
see if she messes these things up.

125
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
First problem is just, well, where should we start?

126
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Because, you know, it's great for us, but bad for humans.

127
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
We make a lot of mistakes in a lot of different contexts.

128
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
You know, where are we actually going to start with this?

129
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And because we started this work around the time of the financial collapse,

130
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
around the time when foreclosures were hitting the news,

131
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
we said, hhmm, maybe we should

132
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
actually start in the financial domain.

133
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Maybe we should look at monkey's economic decisions

134
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and try to see if they do the same kinds of dumb things that we do.

135
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Of course, that's when we hit a sort second problem --

136
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
a little bit more methodological --

137
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
which is that, maybe you guys don't know,

138
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
but monkeys don't actually use money. I know, you haven't met them.

139
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
But this is why, you know, they're not in the queue behind you

140
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
at the grocery store or the ATM -- you know, they don't do this stuff.

141
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So now we faced, you know, a little bit of a problem here.

142
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
How are we actually going to ask monkeys about money

143
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
if they don't actually use it?

144
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So we said, well, maybe we should just, actually just suck it up

145
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and teach monkeys how to use money.

146
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So that's just what we did.

147
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
What you're looking at over here is actually the first unit that I know of

148
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
of non-human currency.

149
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
We weren't very creative at the time we started these studies,

150
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
so we just called it a token.

151
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
But this is the unit of currency that we've taught our monkeys at Yale

152
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
to actually use with humans,

153
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
to actually buy different pieces of food.

154
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
It doesn't look like much -- in fact, it isn't like much.

155
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Like most of our money, it's just a piece of metal.

156
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
As those of you who've taken currencies home from your trip know,

157
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
once you get home, it's actually pretty useless.

158
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It was useless to the monkeys at first

159
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
before they realized what they could do with it.

160
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
When we first gave it to them in their enclosures,

161
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
they actually kind of picked them up, looked at them.

162
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
They were these kind of weird things.

163
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
But very quickly, the monkeys realized

164
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that they could actually hand these tokens over

165
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
to different humans in the lab for some food.

166
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And so you see one of our monkeys, Mayday, up here doing this.

167
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
This is A and B are kind of the points where she's sort of a little bit

168
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
curious about these things -- doesn't know.

169
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
There's this waiting hand from a human experimenter,

170
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and Mayday quickly figures out, apparently the human wants this.

171
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Hands it over, and then gets some food.

172
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
It turns out not just Mayday, all of our monkeys get good

173
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
at trading tokens with human salesman.

174
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
So here's just a quick video of what this looks like.

175
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Here's Mayday. She's going to be trading a token for some food

176
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and waiting happily and getting her food.

177
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Here's Felix, I think. He's our alpha male; he's a kind of big guy.

178
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
But he too waits patiently, gets his food and goes on.

179
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So the monkeys get really good at this.

180
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
They're surprisingly good at this with very little training.

181
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
We just allowed them to pick this up on their own.

182
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
The question is: is this anything like human money?

183
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Is this a market at all,

184
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
or did we just do a weird psychologist's trick

185
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
by getting monkeys to do something,

186
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
looking smart, but not really being smart.

187
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And so we said, well, what would the monkeys spontaneously do

188
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
if this was really their currency, if they were really using it like money?

189
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Well, you might actually imagine them

190
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
to do all the kinds of smart things

191
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that humans do when they start exchanging money with each other.

192
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
You might have them start paying attention to price,

193
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
paying attention to how much they buy --

194
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
sort of keeping track of their monkey token, as it were.

195
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Do the monkeys do anything like this?

196
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And so our monkey marketplace was born.

197
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
The way this works is that

198
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
our monkeys normally live in a kind of big zoo social enclosure.

199
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
When they get a hankering for some treats,

200
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
we actually allowed them a way out

201
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
into a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market.

202
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Upon entering the market --

203
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
it was actually a much more fun market for the monkeys than most human markets

204
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
because, as the monkeys entered the door of the market,

205
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
a human would give them a big wallet full of tokens

206
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
so they could actually trade the tokens

207
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
with one of these two guys here --

208
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
two different possible human salesmen

209
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that they could actually buy stuff from.

210
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
The salesmen were students from my lab.

211
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
They dressed differently; they were different people.

212
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And over time, they did basically the same thing

213
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
so the monkeys could learn, you know,

214
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
who sold what at what price -- you know, who was reliable, who wasn't, and so on.

215
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And you can see that each of the experimenters

216
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
is actually holding up a little, yellow food dish.

217
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and that's what the monkey can for a single token.

218
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So everything costs one token,

219
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
but as you can see, sometimes tokens buy more than others,

220
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
sometimes more grapes than others.

221
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So I'll show you a quick video of what this marketplace actually looks like.

222
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Here's a monkey-eye-view. Monkeys are shorter, so it's a little short.

223
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
But here's Honey.

224
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
She's waiting for the market to open a little impatiently.

225
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
All of a sudden the market opens. Here's her choice: one grapes or two grapes.

226
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
You can see Honey, very good market economist,

227
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
goes with the guy who gives more.

228
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
She could teach our financial advisers a few things or two.

229
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So not just Honey,

230
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
most of the monkeys went with guys who had more.

231
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Most of the monkeys went with guys who had better food.

232
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
When we introduced sales, we saw the monkeys paid attention to that.

233
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
They really cared about their monkey token dollar.

234
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
The more surprising thing was that when we collaborated with economists

235
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
to actually look at the monkeys' data using economic tools,

236
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
they basically matched, not just qualitatively,

237
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
but quantitatively with what we saw

238
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
humans doing in a real market.

239
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
So much so that, if you saw the monkeys' numbers,

240
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
you couldn't tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same market.

241
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And what we'd really thought we'd done

242
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
is like we'd actually introduced something

243
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
that, at least for the monkeys and us,

244
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
works like a real financial currency.

245
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Question is: do the monkeys start messing up in the same ways we do?

246
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Well, we already saw anecdotally a couple of signs that they might.

247
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
One thing we never saw in the monkey marketplace

248
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
was any evidence of saving --

249
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
you know, just like our own species.

250
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
The monkeys entered the market, spent their entire budget

251
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and then went back to everyone else.

252
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
The other thing we also spontaneously saw,

253
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
embarrassingly enough,

254
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
is spontaneous evidence of larceny.

255
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
The monkeys would rip-off the tokens at every available opportunity --

256
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
from each other, often from us --

257
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
you know, things we didn't necessarily think we were introducing,

258
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
but things we spontaneously saw.

259
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
So we said, this looks bad.

260
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Can we actually see if the monkeys

261
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
are doing exactly the same dumb things as humans do?

262
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
One possibility is just kind of let

263
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
the monkey financial system play out,

264
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
you know, see if they start calling us for bailouts in a few years.

265
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
We were a little impatient so we wanted

266
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
to sort of speed things up a bit.

267
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
So we said, let's actually give the monkeys

268
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
the same kinds of problems

269
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
that humans tend to get wrong

270
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
in certain kinds of economic challenges,

271
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
or certain kinds of economic experiments.

272
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And so, since the best way to see how people go wrong

273
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
is to actually do it yourself,

274
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I'm going to give you guys a quick experiment

275
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
to sort of watch your own financial intuitions in action.

276
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So imagine that right now

277
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
I handed each and every one of you

278
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
a thousand U.S. dollars -- so 10 crisp hundred dollar bills.

279
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Take these, put it in your wallet

280
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and spend a second thinking about what you're going to do with it.

281
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Because it's yours now; you can buy whatever you want.

282
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Donate it, take it, and so on.

283
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Sounds great, but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money.

284
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And here's your choice: you can either be risky,

285
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
in which case I'm going to flip one of these monkey tokens.

286
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
If it comes up heads, you're going to get a thousand dollars more.

287
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
If it comes up tails, you get nothing.

288
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
So it's a chance to get more, but it's pretty risky.

289
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Your other option is a bit safe. Your just going to get some money for sure.

290
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
I'm just going to give you 500 bucks.

291
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
You can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately.

292
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
So see what your intuition is here.

293
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Most people actually go with the play-it-safe option.

294
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Most people say, why should I be risky when I can get 1,500 dollars for sure?

295
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
This seems like a good bet. I'm going to go with that.

296
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
You might say, eh, that's not really irrational.

297
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
People are a little risk-averse. So what?

298
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Well, the "so what?" comes when start thinking

299
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
about the same problem

300
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
set up just a little bit differently.

301
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
So now imagine that I give each and every one of you

302
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
2,000 dollars -- 20 crisp hundred dollar bills.

303
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Now you can buy double to stuff you were going to get before.

304
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
Think about how you'd feel sticking it in your wallet.

305
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And now imagine that I have you make another choice

306
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
But this time, it's a little bit worse.

307
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Now, you're going to be deciding how you're going to lose money,

308
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
but you're going to get the same choice.

309
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
You can either take a risky loss --

310
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
so I'll flip a coin. If it comes up heads, you're going to actually lose a lot.

311
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
If it comes up tails, you lose nothing, you're fine, get to keep the whole thing --

312
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
or you could play it safe, which means you have to reach back into your wallet

313
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and give me five of those $100 bills, for certain.

314
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And I'm seeing a lot of furrowed brows out there.

315
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
So maybe you're having the same intuitions

316
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
as the subjects that were actually tested in this,

317
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
which is when presented with these options,

318
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
people don't choose to play it safe.

319
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
They actually tend to go a little risky.

320
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
The reason this is irrational is that we've given people in both situations

321
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
the same choice.

322
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
It's a 50/50 shot of a thousand or 2,000,

323
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
or just 1,500 dollars with certainty.

324
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
But people's intuitions about how much risk to take

325
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
varies depending on where they started with.

326
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
So what's going on?

327
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Well, it turns out that this seems to be the result

328
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
of at least two biases that we have at the psychological level.

329
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
One is that we have a really hard time thinking in absolute terms.

330
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
You really have to do work to figure out,

331
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
well, one option's a thousand, 2,000;

332
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
one is 1,500.

333
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Instead, we find it very easy to think in very relative terms

334
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
as options change from one time to another.

335
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
So we think of things as, "Oh, I'm going to get more," or "Oh, I'm going to get less."

336
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
This is all well and good, except that

337
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
changes in different directions

338
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
actually effect whether or not we think

339
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
options are good or not.

340
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And this leads to the second bias,

341
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
which economists have called loss aversion.

342
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
The idea is that we really hate it when things go into the red.

343
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
We really hate it when we have to lose out on some money.

344
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And this means that sometimes we'll actually

345
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
switch our preferences to avoid this.

346
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
What you saw in that last scenario is that

347
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
subjects get risky

348
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
because they want the small shot that there won't be any loss.

349
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
That means when we're in a risk mindset --

350
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
excuse me, when we're in a loss mindset,

351
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
we actually become more risky,

352
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
which can actually be really worrying.

353
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
These kinds of things play out in lots of bad ways in humans.

354
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
They're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer --

355
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
because they're evaluating them in relative terms.

356
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
They're why people in the housing market refused to sell their house --

357
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
because they don't want to sell at a loss.

358
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
The question we were interested in

359
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
is whether the monkeys show the same biases.

360
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
If we set up those same scenarios in our little monkey market,

361
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
would they do the same thing as people?

362
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
And so this is what we did, we gave the monkeys choices

363
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
between guys who were safe -- they did the same thing every time --

364
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
or guys who were risky --

365
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
they did things differently half the time.

366
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And then we gave them options that were bonuses --

367
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
like you guys did in the first scenario --

368
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
so they actually have a chance more,

369
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
or pieces where they were experiencing losses --

370
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
they actually thought they were going to get more than they really got.

371
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And so this is what this looks like.

372
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
We introduced the monkeys to two new monkey salesmen.

373
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
The guy on the left and right both start with one piece of grape,

374
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
so it looks pretty good.

375
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
But they're going to give the monkeys bonuses.

376
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
The guy on the left is a safe bonus.

377
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
All the time, he adds one, to give the monkeys two.

378
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
The guy on the right is actually a risky bonus.

379
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Sometimes the monkeys get no bonus -- so this is a bonus of zero.

380
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Sometimes the monkeys get two extra.

381
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
For a big bonus, now they get three.

382
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
But this is the same choice you guys just faced.

383
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Do the monkeys actually want to play it safe

384
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and then go with the guy who's going to do the same thing on every trial,

385
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
or do they want to be risky

386
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and try to get a risky, but big, bonus,

387
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
but risk the possibility of getting no bonus.

388
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
People here played it safe.

389
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Turns out, the monkeys play it safe too.

390
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
Qualitatively and quantitatively,

391
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
they choose exactly the same way as people,

392
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
when tested in the same thing.

393
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
You might say, well, maybe the monkeys just don't like risk.

394
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Maybe we should see how they do with losses.

395
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And so we ran a second version of this.

396
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Now, the monkeys meet two guys

397
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
who aren't giving them bonuses;

398
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
they're actually giving them less than they expect.

399
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
So they look like they're starting out with a big amount.

400
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
These are three grapes; the monkey's really psyched for this.

401
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
But now they learn these guys are going to give them less than they expect.

402
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
They guy on the left is a safe loss.

403
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Every single time, he's going to take one of these away

404
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
and give the monkeys just two.

405
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
the guy on the right is the risky loss.

406
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Sometimes he gives no loss, so the monkeys are really psyched,

407
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
but sometimes he actually gives a big loss,

408
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
taking away two to give the monkeys only one.

409
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
And so what do the monkeys do?

410
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
Again, same choice; they can play it safe

411
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
for always getting two grapes every single time,

412
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
or they can take a risky bet and choose between one and three.

413
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
The remarkable thing to us is that, when you give monkeys this choice,

414
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
they do the same irrational thing that people do.

415
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
They actually become more risky

416
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
depending on how the experimenters started.

417
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
This is crazy because it suggests that the monkeys too

418
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
are evaluating things in relative terms

419
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
and actually treating losses differently than they treat gains.

420
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
So what does all of this mean?

421
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Well, what we've shown is that, first of all,

422
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
we can actually give the monkeys a financial currency,

423
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
and they do very similar things with it.

424
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
They do some of the smart things we do,

425
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
some of the kind of not so nice things we do,

426
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
like steal it and so on.

427
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
But they also do some of the irrational things we do.

428
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
They systematically get things wrong

429
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and in the same ways that we do.

430
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
This is the first take-home message of the Talk,

431
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
which is that if you saw the beginning of this and you thought,

432
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
oh, I'm totally going to go home and hire a capuchin monkey financial adviser.

433
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
They're way cuter than the one at ... you know --

434
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
Don't do that; they're probably going to be just as dumb

435
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
as the human one you already have.

436
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
So, you know, a little bad -- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

437
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
A little bad for monkey investors.

438
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
But of course, you know, the reason you're laughing is bad for humans too.

439
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
Because we've answered the question we started out with.

440
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
We wanted to know where these kinds of errors came from.

441
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
And we started with the hope that maybe we can

442
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
sort of tweak our financial institutions,

443
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
tweak our technologies to make ourselves better.

444
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
But what we've learn is that these biases might be a deeper part of us than that.

445
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
In fact, they might be due to the very nature

446
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
of our evolutionary history.

447
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
You know, maybe it's not just humans

448
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
at the right side of this chain that's duncey.

449
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
Maybe it's sort of duncey all the way back.

450
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
And this, if we believe the capuchin monkey results,

451
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
means that these duncey strategies

452
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
might be 35 million years old.

453
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
That's a long time for a strategy

454
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
to potentially get changed around -- really, really old.

455
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
What do we know about other old strategies like this?

456
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
Well, one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome.

457
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
You know, think of our evolutionary predilection

458
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
for eating sweet things, fatty things like cheesecake.

459
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
You can't just shut that off.

460
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
You can't just look at the dessert cart as say, "No, no, no. That looks disgusting to me."

461
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
We're just built differently.

462
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
We're going to perceive it as a good thing to go after.

463
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
My guess is that the same thing is going to be true

464
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
when humans are perceiving

465
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
different financial decisions.

466
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
When you're watching your stocks plummet into the red,

467
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
when you're watching your house price go down,

468
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
you're not going to be able to see that

469
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:13,000
in anything but old evolutionary terms.

470
0:18:13.26,000 --> 0:18:15,000
This means that the biases

471
0:18:15.26,000 --> 0:18:17,000
that lead investors to do badly,

472
0:18:17.26,000 --> 0:18:19,000
that lead to the foreclosure crisis

473
0:18:19.26,000 --> 0:18:21,000
are going to be really hard to overcome.

474
0:18:21.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
So that's the bad news. The question is: is there any good news?

475
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
I'm supposed to be up here telling you the good news.

476
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:27,000
Well, the good news, I think,

477
0:18:27.26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
is what I started with at the beginning of the Talk,

478
0:18:29.26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
which is that humans are not only smart;

479
0:18:31.26,000 --> 0:18:33,000
we're really inspirationally smart

480
0:18:33.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
to the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom.

481
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:39,000
We're so good at overcoming our biological limitations --

482
0:18:39.26,000 --> 0:18:41,000
you know, I flew over here in an airplane.

483
0:18:41.26,000 --> 0:18:43,000
I didn't have to try to flap my wings.

484
0:18:43.26,000 --> 0:18:46,000
I'm wearing contact lenses now so that I can see all of you.

485
0:18:46.26,000 --> 0:18:49,000
I don't have to rely on my own near-sightedness.

486
0:18:49.26,000 --> 0:18:51,000
We actually have all of these cases

487
0:18:51.26,000 --> 0:18:54,000
where we overcome our biological limitations

488
0:18:54.26,000 --> 0:18:57,000
through technology and other means, seemingly pretty easily.

489
0:18:57.26,000 --> 0:19:,000
But we have to recognize that we have those limitations.

490
0:19:00.26,000 --> 0:19:02,000
And here's the rub.

491
0:19:02.26,000 --> 0:19:04,000
It was Camus who once said that, "Man is the only species

492
0:19:04.26,000 --> 0:19:07,000
who refuses to be what he really is."

493
0:19:07.26,000 --> 0:19:09,000
But the irony is that

494
0:19:09.26,000 --> 0:19:11,000
it might only be in recognizing our limitations

495
0:19:11.26,000 --> 0:19:13,000
that we can really actually overcome them.

496
0:19:13.26,000 --> 0:19:16,000
The hope is that you all will think about your limitations,

497
0:19:16.26,000 --> 0:19:19,000
not necessarily as unovercomable,

498
0:19:19.26,000 --> 0:19:21,000
but to recognize them, accept them

499
0:19:21.26,000 --> 0:19:24,000
and then use the world of design to actually figure them out.

500
0:19:24.26,000 --> 0:19:27,000
That might be the only way that we will really be able

501
0:19:27.26,000 --> 0:19:29,000
to achieve our own human potential

502
0:19:29.26,000 --> 0:19:32,000
and really be the noble species we hope to all be.

503
0:19:32.26,000 --> 0:19:34,000
Thank you.

504
0:19:34.26,000 --> 0:19:39,000
(Applause)

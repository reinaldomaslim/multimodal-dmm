1
0:00:12.58,000 --> 0:00:14,000
No one will ever pay you what you're worth.

2
0:00:17.7,000 --> 0:00:19,000
No one will ever pay you

3
0:00:20.06,000 --> 0:00:21,000
what you're worth.

4
0:00:23.66,000 --> 0:00:24,000
They'll only ever pay you

5
0:00:25.62,000 --> 0:00:26,000
what they think you're worth.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And you control their thinking,

7
0:00:31.42,000 --> 0:00:32,000
not like this,

8
0:00:33.34,000 --> 0:00:34,000
although that would be cool.

9
0:00:34.7,000 --> 0:00:35,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:36.34,000 --> 0:00:37,000
That would be really cool.

11
0:00:39.22,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Instead, like this:

12
0:00:41.22,000 --> 0:00:45,000
clearly defining and communicating your value are essential

13
0:00:45.98,000 --> 0:00:46,000
to being paid well for your excellence.

14
0:00:48.62,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Anyone here want to be paid well?

15
0:00:51.18,000 --> 0:00:52,000
OK, good,

16
0:00:52.5,000 --> 0:00:53,000
then this talk is for everyone.

17
0:00:54.82,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It's got universal applicability.

18
0:00:56.82,000 --> 0:00:59,000
It's true if you're a business owner, if you're an employee,

19
0:01:00.34,000 --> 0:01:01,000
if you're a job seeker.

20
0:01:01.82,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It's true if you're a man or a woman.

21
0:01:04.42,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Now, I approach this today through the lens of the woman business owner,

22
0:01:07.98,000 --> 0:01:1,000
because in my work I've observed that women underprice more so than men.

23
0:01:12.38,000 --> 0:01:15,000
The gender wage gap is a well-traveled narrative in this country.

24
0:01:15.58,000 --> 0:01:17,000
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,

25
0:01:17.7,000 --> 0:01:22,000
a woman employee earns just 83 cents for every dollar a man earns.

26
0:01:22.98,000 --> 0:01:23,000
What may surprise you

27
0:01:24.42,000 --> 0:01:27,000
is that this trend continues even into the entrepreneurial sphere.

28
0:01:28.06,000 --> 0:01:33,000
A woman business owner earns just 80 cents for every dollar a man earns.

29
0:01:33.18,000 --> 0:01:35,000
In my work, I've often heard women express

30
0:01:35.54,000 --> 0:01:37,000
that they're uncomfortable communicating their value,

31
0:01:38.34,000 --> 0:01:4,000
especially early on in business ownership.

32
0:01:41.78,000 --> 0:01:42,000
They say things like,

33
0:01:43.34,000 --> 0:01:44,000
"I don't like to toot my own horn."

34
0:01:45.86,000 --> 0:01:47,000
"I'd rather let the work speak for itself."

35
0:01:48.82,000 --> 0:01:49,000
"I don't like to sing my own praises."

36
0:01:51.42,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I hear very different narratives in working with male business owners,

37
0:01:54.94,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and I think this difference is costing women 20 cents on the dollar.

38
0:01:59.5,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I'd like to tell you the story of a consulting firm

39
0:02:01.94,000 --> 0:02:04,000
that helps their clients dramatically improve their profitability.

40
0:02:05.18,000 --> 0:02:06,000
That company is my company.

41
0:02:07.7,000 --> 0:02:1,000
After my first year in business, I saw the profit increases

42
0:02:10.9,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that my clients were realizing in working with me,

43
0:02:14.3,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and I realized that I needed to reevaluate my pricing.

44
0:02:17.78,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I was really underpriced relative to the value I was delivering.

45
0:02:21.5,000 --> 0:02:24,000
It's hard for me to admit to you, because I'm a pricing consultant.

46
0:02:25.18,000 --> 0:02:26,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:26.9,000 --> 0:02:27,000
It's what I do.

48
0:02:28.14,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I help companies price for value.

49
0:02:30.98,000 --> 0:02:31,000
But nonetheless, it's what I saw,

50
0:02:32.62,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and so I sat down to evaluate my pricing, evaluate my value,

51
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and I did that by asking key value questions.

52
0:02:40.9,000 --> 0:02:42,000
What are my clients' needs and how do I meet them?

53
0:02:43.62,000 --> 0:02:46,000
What is my unique skill set that makes me better qualified to serve my clients?

54
0:02:48.5,000 --> 0:02:49,000
What do I do that no one else does?

55
0:02:51.06,000 --> 0:02:53,000
What problems do I solve for clients?

56
0:02:53.66,000 --> 0:02:54,000
What value do I add?

57
0:02:56.7,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I answered these questions

58
0:02:58.5,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and defined the value that my clients get from working with me,

59
0:03:02.14,000 --> 0:03:03,000
calculated their return on investment,

60
0:03:04.02,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and what I saw was that I needed to double my price,

61
0:03:07.78,000 --> 0:03:08,000
double it.

62
0:03:09.02,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Now, I confess to you, this terrified me.

63
0:03:14.18,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I'm supposed to be the expert in this, but I'm not cured.

64
0:03:17.66,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I knew the value was there.

65
0:03:19.22,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I was convinced the value was there,

66
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and I was still scared out of my wits.

67
0:03:23.82,000 --> 0:03:24,000
What if nobody would pay me that?

68
0:03:25.82,000 --> 0:03:27,000
What if clients said, "That's ridiculous.

69
0:03:28.1,000 --> 0:03:29,000
You're ridiculous."

70
0:03:30.3,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Was I really worth that?

71
0:03:33.02,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Not my work, mind you, but me.

72
0:03:36.38,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Was I worth that?

73
0:03:38.5,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I'm the mother of two beautiful little girls who depend upon me.

74
0:03:41.58,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I'm a single mom.

75
0:03:43.1,000 --> 0:03:44,000
What if my business fails?

76
0:03:45.18,000 --> 0:03:46,000
What if I fail?

77
0:03:48.06,000 --> 0:03:49,000
But I know how to take my own medicine,

78
0:03:50.86,000 --> 0:03:52,000
the medicine that I prescribe to my clients.

79
0:03:53.42,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I had done the homework.

80
0:03:55.14,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I knew the value was there.

81
0:03:57.5,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So when prospects came,

82
0:04:00.18,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I prepared the proposals with the new higher pricing

83
0:04:03.22,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and sent them out

84
0:04:04.54,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and communicated the value.

85
0:04:07.3,000 --> 0:04:08,000
How's the story end?

86
0:04:09.66,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Clients continued to hire me

87
0:04:11.66,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and refer me and recommend me, and I'm still here.

88
0:04:15.86,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And I share this story

89
0:04:17.14,000 --> 0:04:19,000
because doubts and fears are natural and normal.

90
0:04:20.22,000 --> 0:04:22,000
But they don't define our value,

91
0:04:22.7,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and they shouldn't limit our earning potential.

92
0:04:27.38,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I'd like to share another story,

93
0:04:29.18,000 --> 0:04:31,000
about a woman who learned to communicate her value

94
0:04:32.02,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and found her own voice.

95
0:04:34.78,000 --> 0:04:36,000
She runs a successful web development company

96
0:04:37.18,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and employs several people.

97
0:04:39.42,000 --> 0:04:42,000
When she first started her firm and for several years thereafter,

98
0:04:42.66,000 --> 0:04:44,000
she would say, "I have a little web design company."

99
0:04:46.66,000 --> 0:04:48,000
She'd actually use those words with clients.

100
0:04:49.22,000 --> 0:04:5,000
"I have a little web design company."

101
0:04:52.18,000 --> 0:04:53,000
In this and in many other small ways,

102
0:04:54.02,000 --> 0:04:57,000
she was diminishing her company in the eyes of prospects and clients,

103
0:04:57.94,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and diminishing herself.

104
0:05:00.86,000 --> 0:05:03,000
It was really impacting her ability to earn what she was worth.

105
0:05:04.9,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I believe her language and her style

106
0:05:07.82,000 --> 0:05:09,000
communicated that she didn't believe

107
0:05:10.1,000 --> 0:05:11,000
she had much value to offer.

108
0:05:13.62,000 --> 0:05:15,000
In her own words, she was practically giving her services away.

109
0:05:17.86,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And so she began her journey

110
0:05:20.18,000 --> 0:05:23,000
to take responsibility for communicating value to clients

111
0:05:23.38,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and changing her message.

112
0:05:26.38,000 --> 0:05:27,000
One thing I shared with her

113
0:05:27.9,000 --> 0:05:29,000
is that it's so important

114
0:05:29.98,000 --> 0:05:3,000
to find your own voice,

115
0:05:31.5,000 --> 0:05:33,000
a voice that's authentic and true to you.

116
0:05:33.58,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Don't try to channel your sister-in-law just because she's a great salesperson

117
0:05:37.3,000 --> 0:05:4,000
or your neighbor who tells a great joke if that's not who you are.

118
0:05:41.5,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Give up this notion that it's tooting your own horn.

119
0:05:43.98,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Make it about the other party.

120
0:05:45.74,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Focus on serving and adding value, and it won't feel like bragging.

121
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
What do you love about what you do?

122
0:05:52.9,000 --> 0:05:54,000
What excites you about the work that you do?

123
0:05:55.02,000 --> 0:05:58,000
If you connect with that, communicating your value will come naturally.

124
0:06:00.34,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So she embraced her natural style,

125
0:06:02.62,000 --> 0:06:04,000
found her voice and changed her message.

126
0:06:05.94,000 --> 0:06:08,000
For one thing, she stopped calling herself a little web design company.

127
0:06:09.94,000 --> 0:06:12,000
She really found a lot of strength and power in communicating her message.

128
0:06:15.1,000 --> 0:06:17,000
She's now charging three times as much for web design,

129
0:06:18.06,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and her business is growing.

130
0:06:20.7,000 --> 0:06:21,000
She told me about a recent meeting

131
0:06:22.38,000 --> 0:06:24,000
with a gruff and sometimes difficult client

132
0:06:24.58,000 --> 0:06:27,000
who had called a meeting questioning progress on search engine optimization.

133
0:06:29.3,000 --> 0:06:3,000
She said in the old days,

134
0:06:30.54,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that would have been a really intimidating meeting for her,

135
0:06:33.34,000 --> 0:06:34,000
but her mindset was different.

136
0:06:34.82,000 --> 0:06:37,000
She said, she prepared the information, sat down with the client,

137
0:06:38.54,000 --> 0:06:4,000
said this isn't about me, it's not personal,

138
0:06:41.34,000 --> 0:06:42,000
it's about the client.

139
0:06:42.7,000 --> 0:06:44,000
She took them through the data, through the numbers,

140
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
laid out the trends and the progress in her own voice and in her own way,

141
0:06:50.22,000 --> 0:06:52,000
but very directly said, "Here's what we've done for you."

142
0:06:52.94,000 --> 0:06:54,000
The client sat up and took notice, and said, "OK, I got it."

143
0:06:57.78,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And she said in describing that meeting,

144
0:06:59.74,000 --> 0:07:01,000
"I didn't feel scared or panicky

145
0:07:03.38,000 --> 0:07:04,000
or small,

146
0:07:05.62,000 --> 0:07:06,000
which is how I used to feel.

147
0:07:07.62,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Instead I feel like, 'OK, I got this.

148
0:07:12.1,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I know what I'm doing. I'm confident.'"

149
0:07:17.62,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Being properly valued is so important.

150
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
You can hear in this story

151
0:07:21.94,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that the implications range far beyond just finances

152
0:07:25.18,000 --> 0:07:28,000
into the realm of self-respect and self-confidence.

153
0:07:30.18,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Today I've told two stories, one about defining our value

154
0:07:33.74,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and the other about communicating our value,

155
0:07:36.58,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and these are the two elements to realizing our full earning potential.

156
0:07:40.38,000 --> 0:07:41,000
That's the equation.

157
0:07:42.66,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And if you're sitting in the audience today

158
0:07:45.38,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and you're not being paid what you're worth,

159
0:07:47.86,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I'd like to welcome you into this equation.

160
0:07:50.42,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Just imagine what life could be like,

161
0:07:52.82,000 --> 0:07:53,000
how much more we could do,

162
0:07:54.7,000 --> 0:07:56,000
how much more we could give back,

163
0:07:56.82,000 --> 0:07:58,000
how much more we could plan for the future,

164
0:07:59.38,000 --> 0:08:01,000
how validated and respected we would feel

165
0:08:02.58,000 --> 0:08:04,000
if we could earn our full potential,

166
0:08:05.3,000 --> 0:08:06,000
realize our full value.

167
0:08:08.54,000 --> 0:08:1,000
No one will ever pay you what you're worth.

168
0:08:11.14,000 --> 0:08:13,000
They'll only ever pay you what they think you're worth,

169
0:08:13.78,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and you control their thinking.

170
0:08:16.06,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Thank you.

171
0:08:17.46,000 --> 0:08:2,000

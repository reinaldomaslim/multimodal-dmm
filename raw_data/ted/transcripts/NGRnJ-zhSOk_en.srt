1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:27,000
A fact

2
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:3,000
came out of MIT,

3
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:32,000
couple of years ago. Ken Hale,

4
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:34,000
who's a linguist,

5
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:37,000
said that of the 6,000 languages

6
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:39,000
spoken on Earth right now,

7
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:42,000
3,000 aren't spoken by the children.

8
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So that in one generation,

9
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:48,000
we're going to halve our cultural diversity.

10
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:51,000
He went on to say

11
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that every two weeks,

12
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:55,000
an elder goes to the grave

13
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:57,000
carrying the last spoken word

14
0:00:57,000 --> 0:00:59,000
of that culture.

15
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So an entire philosophy,

16
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:06,000
a body of knowledge about the natural world

17
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:1,000
that had been empirically gleaned over centuries,

18
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:12,000
goes away.

19
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And this happens every two weeks.

20
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So for the last 20 years,

21
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:21,000
since my dental experience,

22
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I have been traveling the world

23
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and coming back

24
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
with stories about some of these people.

25
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:3,000
What I'd like to do right now

26
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:33,000
is share some of those stories with you.

27
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
This is Tamdin.

28
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:38,000
She is a 69-year-old nun.

29
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:42,000
She was thrown in prison in Tibet for two years

30
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:44,000
for putting up a little tiny placard

31
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:47,000
protesting the occupation of her country.

32
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And when I met her, she had just

33
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:53,000
taken a walk over the Himalayas

34
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:56,000
from Lhasa, the capital of Tibet,

35
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:58,000
into Nepal, across to India --

36
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:,000
30 days --

37
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:03,000
to meet her leader, the Dalai Lama.

38
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:05,000
The Dalai Lama lives in Dharamsala, India.

39
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So I took this picture three days

40
0:02:07,000 --> 0:02:09,000
after she arrived,

41
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and she had this beat-up pair of tennis shoes on,

42
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:13,000
with her toes sticking out.

43
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And she crossed in March,

44
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and there's a lot of snow at 18,500 feet in March.

45
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:22,000
This is Paldin.

46
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Paldin is a 62-year-old monk.

47
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And he spent 33 years in prison.

48
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:31,000
His whole monastery was thrown into prison

49
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:34,000
at the time of the uprising,

50
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:37,000
when the Dalai Lama had to leave

51
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Tibet.

52
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And

53
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:44,000
he was beaten, starved,

54
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:46,000
tortured -- lost all his teeth while in prison.

55
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And when I met him, he was a kind gentle old man.

56
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And it really impressed me --

57
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I met him two weeks after he got out of prison --

58
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:57,000
that he went through that experience, and ended up

59
0:02:57,000 --> 0:03:,000
with the demeanor that he had.

60
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So I was in Dharamsala meeting these people,

61
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and I'd spent about five weeks there,

62
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and I was hearing these similar stories

63
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:11,000
of these refugees that had poured out of Tibet

64
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:13,000
into Dharamsala.

65
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And it just so happened, on the fifth week,

66
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
there was a public teaching by the Dalai Lama.

67
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And

68
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I was watching this crowd of monks and nuns,

69
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:27,000
many of which I had just interviewed,

70
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and heard their stories,

71
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and I watched their faces,

72
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and they gave us a little FM radio,

73
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and we could listen to the translation of his teachings.

74
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And what he said was:

75
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:43,000
treat your enemies as if they were precious jewels,

76
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:45,000
because it's your enemies

77
0:03:45,000 --> 0:03:48,000
that build your tolerance and patience

78
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:52,000
on the road to your enlightenment.

79
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:55,000
That hit me so hard,

80
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:59,000
telling these people that had been through this experience.

81
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So, two months later, I went into

82
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Tibet, and I started

83
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:08,000
interviewing the people there, taking my photographs. That's what I do.

84
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I interview and do portraits.

85
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And this is a little girl.

86
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I took her portrait up on top of the Jokhang Temple.

87
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And I'd snuck in --

88
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:23,000
because it's totally illegal to have a picture of the Dalai Lama in Tibet --

89
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:26,000
it's the quickest way you can get arrested.

90
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So I snuck in a bunch of little wallet-sized pictures of the Dalai Lama,

91
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and I would hand them out.

92
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And when I gave them to the people,

93
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:36,000
they'd either hold them to their heart,

94
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:39,000
or they'd hold them up to their head and just stay there.

95
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And this is --

96
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:43,000
well, at the time -- I did this 10 years ago --

97
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:46,000
that was 36 years after the Dalai Lama had left.

98
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So

99
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I was going in, interviewing these people and doing their portraits.

100
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:55,000
This is Jigme and her sister, Sonam.

101
0:04:55,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And they live up on the Chang Tang, the Tibetan Plateau,

102
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:01,000
way in the western part of the country.

103
0:05:01,000 --> 0:05:03,000
This is at 17,000 feet.

104
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And they had just come down from the high pastures,

105
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:08,000
at 18,000 feet.

106
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Same thing: gave her a picture,

107
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:12,000
she held it up to her forehead.

108
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And I usually hand out Polaroids

109
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:17,000
when I do these, because I'm setting up lights,

110
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and checking my lights,

111
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and when I showed her her Polaroid, she screamed and ran into her tent.

112
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:26,000
This is Tenzin Gyatso;

113
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
he was found to be the Buddha of Compassion at the age of two,

114
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:33,000
out in a peasant's house,

115
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
way out in the middle of nowhere.

116
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:37,000
At the age of four, he was installed

117
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:4,000
as the 14th Dalai Lama.

118
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:42,000
As a teenager, he faced

119
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:44,000
the invasion of his country,

120
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and had to deal with it -- he was the leader of the country.

121
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Eight years later, when they discovered there was a plot

122
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:51,000
to kill him,

123
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:53,000
they dressed him up like a beggar

124
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and snuck him out of the country on horseback,

125
0:05:56,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and took the same trip that Tamdin did.

126
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And he's never been back to his country since.

127
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And

128
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:07,000
if you think about this man,

129
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:09,000
46 years later,

130
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:11,000
still sticking

131
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:15,000
to this non-violent response

132
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:19,000
to a severe political and human rights issue.

133
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And the young people,

134
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:24,000
young Tibetans, are starting to say, listen, this doesn't work.

135
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:26,000
You know, violence as a political tool

136
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
is all the rage right now.

137
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And

138
0:06:31,000 --> 0:06:33,000
he still is holding this line.

139
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So this is our icon

140
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:38,000
to non-violence in our world --

141
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:4,000
one of our living icons.

142
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:43,000
This is another leader of his people.

143
0:06:43,000 --> 0:06:46,000
This is Moi. This is in the Ecuadorian Amazon.

144
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And Moi is 35 years old.

145
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And

146
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:53,000
this area of the Ecuadorian Amazon --

147
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:56,000
oil was discovered in 1972.

148
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And in this period of time -- since that time --

149
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:02,000
as much oil, or twice as much oil

150
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:05,000
as was spilled in the Exxon Valdez accident,

151
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:08,000
was spilled in this little area of the Amazon,

152
0:07:08,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and the tribes in this area have constantly had to move.

153
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And Moi

154
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:16,000
belongs to the Huaorani tribe,

155
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and they're known as

156
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:2,000
very fierce, they're known as "auca."

157
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And they've managed to keep out

158
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:25,000
the seismologists and the oil workers

159
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:28,000
with spears and blowguns.

160
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And we spent --

161
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:33,000
I was with a team --

162
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
two weeks with these guys out in the jungle

163
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:38,000
watching them hunt.

164
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:4,000
This was on a monkey hunt,

165
0:07:4,000 --> 0:07:43,000
hunting with curare-tipped darts.

166
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And the knowledge that these people have

167
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:48,000
about the natural environment is incredible.

168
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:52,000
They could hear things, smell things, see things I couldn't see.

169
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And I couldn't even see the monkeys

170
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:56,000
that they were

171
0:07:56,000 --> 0:08:,000
getting with these darts.

172
0:08:,000 --> 0:08:02,000
This is Yadira,

173
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and Yadira is

174
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:07,000
five years old. She's in a

175
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:1,000
tribe that's neighboring the Huaorani.

176
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And her tribe has had to move

177
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:16,000
three times in the last 10 years because of the oil spills.

178
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And we never hear about that. And the latest

179
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:22,000
infraction against these people is,

180
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:24,000
as part of Plan Colombia,

181
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:27,000
we're spraying Paraquat or Round Up, whatever it is --

182
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:3,000
we're defoliating thousands of acres

183
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:32,000
of the Ecuadorian Amazon

184
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:34,000
in our war on drugs.

185
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And these people are the people who take the brunt of it.

186
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:4,000
This is Mengatoue.

187
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:42,000
He's the shaman of the Huaorani,

188
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and

189
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:48,000
he said to us, you know, I'm an older man now;

190
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I'm getting tired, you know; I'm tired

191
0:08:5,000 --> 0:08:52,000
of spearing these oil workers.

192
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I wish they would just go away.

193
0:08:57,000 --> 0:09:,000
And I was -- I usually travel alone

194
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:03,000
when I do my work, but I did this --

195
0:09:03,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I hosted a program for Discovery,

196
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and when I went down with the team,

197
0:09:08,000 --> 0:09:11,000
I was quite concerned about

198
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:14,000
going in with a whole bunch of people, especially into the Huaorani,

199
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:16,000
deep into the Huaorani tribe.

200
0:09:16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And

201
0:09:18,000 --> 0:09:2,000
as it turned out, these guys really

202
0:09:2,000 --> 0:09:23,000
taught me a thing or two about blending in

203
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:25,000
with the locals.

204
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:28,000
(Laughter)

205
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:31,000
One of the things I did

206
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:34,000
just before 9/11 --

207
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:36,000
August of 2001 --

208
0:09:36,000 --> 0:09:38,000
I took my son, Dax,

209
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:41,000
who was 16 at the time,

210
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and I took him to Pakistan.

211
0:09:43,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Because at first I wanted --

212
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:47,000
you know, I've taken him on a couple of trips,

213
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:49,000
but I wanted him to see

214
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:52,000
people that live on a dollar a day or less.

215
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:54,000
I wanted him to get an experience

216
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:56,000
in the Islamic world

217
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and I also wanted him to --

218
0:09:59,000 --> 0:10:01,000
I was going there to work with a group,

219
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:03,000
do a story on a group called the Kalash,

220
0:10:03,000 --> 0:10:05,000
that are a group of animists, 3,000 animists,

221
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:09,000
that live -- very small area --

222
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:12,000
surrounded by Islam -- there's 3,000

223
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:16,000
of these Kalash left; they're incredible people.

224
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
So it was a great experience for him. He stayed up all night with them,

225
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:21,000
drumming and dancing.

226
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And he brought a soccer ball,

227
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and we had soccer every night in this little village.

228
0:10:26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And then we went up

229
0:10:28,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and met their shaman.

230
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:32,000
By the way, Mengatoue was the shaman

231
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:34,000
of his tribe as well.

232
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And this is John Doolikahn,

233
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:39,000
who's the shaman of the Kalash.

234
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And he's up in the mountains,

235
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:43,000
right on the border with Afghanistan.

236
0:10:43,000 --> 0:10:46,000
In fact, on that other side is the area, Tora Bora,

237
0:10:46,000 --> 0:10:49,000
the area where

238
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Osama bin Laden's supposed to be. This is the tribal area.

239
0:10:52,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And we watched

240
0:10:55,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and stayed with

241
0:10:57,000 --> 0:10:59,000
John Doolikahn.

242
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And the shaman -- I did a whole series on shamanism,

243
0:11:02,000 --> 0:11:04,000
which is

244
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:06,000
an interesting phenomenon.

245
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:08,000
But around the world,

246
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:1,000
they go into trance in different ways,

247
0:11:1,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and in Pakistan,

248
0:11:12,000 --> 0:11:15,000
the way they do it is they burn juniper leaves

249
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and they sacrifice an animal,

250
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:2,000
pour the blood of the animal on the leaves

251
0:11:2,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and then inhale the smoke.

252
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And they're all praying

253
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:28,000
to the mountain gods

254
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:31,000
as they go into trance.

255
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:34,000
You know,

256
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:38,000
getting kids used to different realities,

257
0:11:38,000 --> 0:11:41,000
I think, is so important. What Dan Dennett said the other day --

258
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:45,000
having a curriculum where they study different religions,

259
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:47,000
just to make a mental flexibility,

260
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:49,000
give them a mental flexibility

261
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:51,000
in different belief systems --

262
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:54,000
I think this is so necessary in our world today

263
0:11:54,000 --> 0:11:58,000
as you see these clash of beliefs taking place.

264
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And all the security issues they cause us.

265
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:05,000
So, one thing we did five years ago:

266
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:07,000
we started a program that links kids

267
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:1,000
in indigenous communities with kids in the United States.

268
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:13,000
So we first hooked up

269
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:18,000
a spot in the Navajo Nation with a classroom in Seattle.

270
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:21,000
We now have 15 sites.

271
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:24,000
We have one in Kathmandu, Nepal;

272
0:12:24,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Dharamsala, India; Takaungu, Kenya --

273
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Takaungu is one-third Christian, one-third Muslim

274
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and one-third animist, the community is --

275
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Ollantaytambo, Peru,

276
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and Arctic Village, Alaska.

277
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:38,000
This is Daniel; he's one of our students

278
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:4,000
in Arctic Village, Alaska.

279
0:12:4,000 --> 0:12:42,000
He lives in this log cabin --

280
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:45,000
no running water, no heat other than --

281
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:47,000
no windows

282
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and high-speed Internet connection.

283
0:12:49,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And this is --

284
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:53,000
I see this rolling out all over --

285
0:12:53,000 --> 0:12:55,000
this is our site in Ollantaytambo, Peru, four years ago,

286
0:12:56,000 --> 0:12:58,000
where they first saw their first computers;

287
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:01,000
now they have computers in their classrooms.

288
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And the way we've done this --

289
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:06,000
we teach digital storytelling to these kids.

290
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And we have them tell stories about issues in their community

291
0:13:09,000 --> 0:13:11,000
in their community that they care about.

292
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And this is in Peru, where the kids told the story

293
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:15,000
about a river that they cleaned up.

294
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:18,000
And the way we do it is, we do it in workshops,

295
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and we bring people who want to learn

296
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:24,000
digital workflow and storytelling,

297
0:13:25,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and have them

298
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:29,000
work with the kids.

299
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And just this last year we've taken a group of teenagers in,

300
0:13:33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and this has worked the best.

301
0:13:35,000 --> 0:13:37,000
So our dream is to bring teenagers together,

302
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:4,000
so they'll have a community service experience

303
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:43,000
as well as a cross-cultural experience,

304
0:13:43,000 --> 0:13:45,000
as they teach kids in these areas

305
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and help them build their communication infrastructure.

306
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:51,000
This is teaching Photoshop

307
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:55,000
in the Tibetan children's village in Dharamsala.

308
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:58,000
We have the website, where the kids all get their homepage.

309
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:,000
This is all their movies. We've got about 60 movies

310
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:02,000
that these kids have made,

311
0:14:02,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and they're quite incredible.

312
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:06,000
The one I want to show you --

313
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:09,000
after we get them to make the movies,

314
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:12,000
we have a night where we show the movies to the community.

315
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And this is in Takaungu --

316
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:16,000
we've got a generator and a digital projector,

317
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and we're projecting it up against a barn,

318
0:14:18,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and showing one of the movies that they made.

319
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And if you get a chance, you can go to our website, and you'll see

320
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:27,000
the incredible work these kids do.

321
0:14:27,000 --> 0:14:3,000
The other thing:

322
0:14:3,000 --> 0:14:32,000
I wanted to give indigenous people a voice.

323
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:35,000
That was one of the big motivating factors.

324
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:37,000
But the other motivating factor is

325
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:4,000
the insular nature of our country.

326
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:43,000
National Geographic just did a Roper Study

327
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:46,000
of 18 to 26 year olds

328
0:14:46,000 --> 0:14:48,000
in our country

329
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and in nine other industrialized countries.

330
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:53,000
It was a two million dollar study.

331
0:14:53,000 --> 0:14:56,000
United States came in second to last

332
0:14:56,000 --> 0:14:58,000
in geographic knowledge.

333
0:14:58,000 --> 0:15:,000
70 percent of the kids couldn't find

334
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Afghanistan or Iraq on a map;

335
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:06,000
60 percent couldn't find India;

336
0:15:06,000 --> 0:15:09,000
30 percent couldn't find the Pacific Ocean.

337
0:15:09,000 --> 0:15:11,000
And this is a study

338
0:15:11,000 --> 0:15:14,000
that was just done a couple of years ago.

339
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:17,000
So what I'd like to show you now,

340
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:2,000
in the couple of minutes I have left,

341
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:22,000
is a film that a student made in Guatemala.

342
0:15:22,000 --> 0:15:25,000
We just had a workshop in Guatemala.

343
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:28,000
A week before we got to the workshop,

344
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:32,000
a massive landslide, caused by Hurricane Stan,

345
0:15:32,000 --> 0:15:34,000
last October, came in and buried

346
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:36,000
600 people alive in their village.

347
0:15:36,000 --> 0:15:38,000
And this kid lived in the village --

348
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:4,000
he wasn't there at the time --

349
0:15:4,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and this is the little movie he put together about that.

350
0:15:44,000 --> 0:15:46,000
And he hadn't seen a computer before

351
0:15:46,000 --> 0:15:5,000
we did this movie. We taught him Photoshop and --

352
0:15:5,000 --> 0:15:52,000
yeah, we can play it.

353
0:16:15,000 --> 0:16:18,000
This is an old Mayan funeral chant

354
0:16:18,000 --> 0:16:2,000
that he got from his grandfather.

355
0:18:38,000 --> 0:18:4,000
Thank you very much.

356
0:18:4,000 --> 0:18:41,000
(Applause)

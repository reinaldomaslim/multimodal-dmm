1
0:00:12.08,000 --> 0:00:17,000
let's say that you wanted to conduct an

2
0:00:15.24,000 --> 0:00:2,000
experiment in this experiment you

3
0:00:18.06,000 --> 0:00:24,000
randomly assign people to live in

4
0:00:20.43,000 --> 0:00:26,000
blasting zones or in control locations

5
0:00:24.24,000 --> 0:00:29,000
without explosives going off over their

6
0:00:26.58,000 --> 0:00:31,000
heads they live in a community for years

7
0:00:29.67,000 --> 0:00:34,000
just downwind and downstream from sites

8
0:00:32.55,000 --> 0:00:36,000
where tons of explosives are used almost

9
0:00:35.04,000 --> 0:00:4,000
daily and millions of gallons of water

10
0:00:37.44,000 --> 0:00:43,000
contaminated with random assignment you

11
0:00:40.739,000 --> 0:00:44,000
could carefully study the long-term

12
0:00:43.71,000 --> 0:00:47,000
health effects of living in these

13
0:00:45.69,000 --> 0:00:49,000
blasting communities without a bunch of

14
0:00:47.82,000 --> 0:00:54,000
annoying confounders in Co various

15
0:00:50.27,000 --> 0:00:57,000
random assignment does wonders that

16
0:00:54.93,000 --> 0:00:58,000
would be a rigorous powerful scientific

17
0:00:57.78,000 --> 0:01:01,000
inquiry into the effects of these

18
0:00:59.789,000 --> 0:01:03,000
environmental exposures of course such a

19
0:01:02.579,000 --> 0:01:05,000
study could never be done

20
0:01:04.129,000 --> 0:01:08,000
most scientists wouldn't have the

21
0:01:06.299,000 --> 0:01:1,000
stomach for it the institutional review

22
0:01:08.85,000 --> 0:01:11,000
board would never approve it it would

23
0:01:10.5,000 --> 0:01:16,000
never pass human subjects review because

24
0:01:12.54,000 --> 0:01:2,000
it would be unethical immoral and yet in

25
0:01:16.74,000 --> 0:01:22,000
effect it is happening right now in my

26
0:01:20.79,000 --> 0:01:24,000
mind is prompts and questions what is

27
0:01:23.1,000 --> 0:01:27,000
the ethical obligation of the scientist

28
0:01:24.99,000 --> 0:01:29,000
who believes populations are in danger

29
0:01:27.71,000 --> 0:01:32,000
how much evidence is enough to be

30
0:01:30.63,000 --> 0:01:35,000
confident of our conclusions where is

31
0:01:33.54,000 --> 0:01:39,000
the line between scientific certainty

32
0:01:35.909,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and the need to act the unplanned

33
0:01:39.6,000 --> 0:01:43,000
experiment that is happening right now

34
0:01:41.189,000 --> 0:01:46,000
is called mountaintop removal the

35
0:01:43.68,000 --> 0:01:48,000
abbreviation for it is MTR it is a form

36
0:01:46.979,000 --> 0:01:5,000
of surface coal mining that takes place

37
0:01:49.02,000 --> 0:01:55,000
in Appalachia here in the United States

38
0:01:51.71,000 --> 0:01:58,000
MTR occurs in four states Virginia West

39
0:01:55.11,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Virginia Kentucky and Tennessee over 1.2

40
0:01:59.189,000 --> 0:02:03,000
million acres have been mined in this

41
0:02:01.979,000 --> 0:02:04,000
way this is an area about the size of

42
0:02:04.049,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Delaware but it is spread over a

43
0:02:05.939,000 --> 0:02:1,000
footprint as large as Vermont and New

44
0:02:08.7,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Hampshire combined

45
0:02:11.11,000 --> 0:02:16,000
the process involves clear-cutting

46
0:02:13.54,000 --> 0:02:17,000
ancient Appalachian forests home to some

47
0:02:16.15,000 --> 0:02:2,000
of the richest biodiversity on the

48
0:02:17.62,000 --> 0:02:23,000
planet the trees are typically burned or

49
0:02:20.8,000 --> 0:02:26,000
dumped into adjacent valleys then to

50
0:02:24.58,000 --> 0:02:3,000
reach the Buried coal scenes explosives

51
0:02:27.28,000 --> 0:02:34,000
are used to remove up to 800 feet of

52
0:02:31.09,000 --> 0:02:37,000
mountain elevation over 1,500 tons of

53
0:02:35.2,000 --> 0:02:42,000
explosives are used for coal mining in

54
0:02:37.39,000 --> 0:02:43,000
West Virginia alone every day rock and

55
0:02:42.52,000 --> 0:02:45,000
soil debris is dumped over the valley

56
0:02:44.08,000 --> 0:02:49,000
sides where it permanently buries

57
0:02:45.82,000 --> 0:02:52,000
headwater streams so far over 500

58
0:02:49.959,000 --> 0:02:54,000
mountains have been destroyed about

59
0:02:53.35,000 --> 0:02:57,000
2,000 miles of streams have been

60
0:02:55.18,000 --> 0:02:59,000
permanently buried water emerging from

61
0:02:57.82,000 --> 0:03:01,000
the base of the valley fills is highly

62
0:02:59.56,000 --> 0:03:03,000
contaminated and remains contaminated

63
0:03:01.9,000 --> 0:03:05,000
for decades the coal then has to be

64
0:03:04.51,000 --> 0:03:07,000
chemically treated crushed and washed

65
0:03:06.37,000 --> 0:03:1,000
before it can be transported to power

66
0:03:08.38,000 --> 0:03:14,000
plants and burned this cleaning takes

67
0:03:11.05,000 --> 0:03:17,000
place on site the process produces more

68
0:03:14.56,000 --> 0:03:19,000
air pollution and contaminates billions

69
0:03:17.53,000 --> 0:03:22,000
of gallons of water with metals sulfates

70
0:03:20.23,000 --> 0:03:28,000
cleaning chemicals and other impurities

71
0:03:23.25,000 --> 0:03:3,000
all of this to produce 3 percent of u.s.

72
0:03:28.54,000 --> 0:03:34,000
electricity demand only 3 percent of

73
0:03:30.989,000 --> 0:03:35,000
u.s. electricity demand as you can

74
0:03:34.93,000 --> 0:03:37,000
appreciate this prompts all sorts of

75
0:03:36.82,000 --> 0:03:39,000
other questions what are the health

76
0:03:38.62,000 --> 0:03:42,000
impacts of mountaintop removal mining

77
0:03:40.57,000 --> 0:03:45,000
there are over a million people who live

78
0:03:43.42,000 --> 0:03:48,000
in counties where MTR takes place and

79
0:03:45.58,000 --> 0:03:51,000
millions more downstream and downwind

80
0:03:49.35,000 --> 0:03:53,000
what has been the response of industry

81
0:03:52.12,000 --> 0:03:57,000
in government when these issues are

82
0:03:53.68,000 --> 0:03:58,000
documented and again what is the ethical

83
0:03:57.37,000 --> 0:04:03,000
obligation of science when faced with

84
0:03:59.47,000 --> 0:04:05,000
this disturbing situation I began to

85
0:04:03.37,000 --> 0:04:07,000
research this issue in 2006 I had just

86
0:04:06.34,000 --> 0:04:09,000
taken a job at West Virginia University

87
0:04:07.87,000 --> 0:04:12,000
before then I hadn't done any research

88
0:04:10.06,000 --> 0:04:16,000
related to coal but I started to hear

89
0:04:13.81,000 --> 0:04:17,000
stories from people who lived in these

90
0:04:16.239,000 --> 0:04:21,000
mining communities they said that the

91
0:04:18.7,000 --> 0:04:23,000
water they drank was not clean that the

92
0:04:21.459,000 --> 0:04:24,000
air they breathed was polluted

93
0:04:23.72,000 --> 0:04:26,000
they would tell me about their own

94
0:04:25.4,000 --> 0:04:29,000
illnesses or illnesses in their family

95
0:04:27.62,000 --> 0:04:32,000
they were worried about how common

96
0:04:29.72,000 --> 0:04:33,000
cancer was in their neighborhoods I met

97
0:04:32.69,000 --> 0:04:35,000
with many people in southern West

98
0:04:33.95,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Virginia and Eastern Kentucky to listen

99
0:04:35.93,000 --> 0:04:39,000
to those stories and hear their concerns

100
0:04:37.85,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I searched the scientific literature and

101
0:04:40.49,000 --> 0:04:44,000
was surprised to learn that nothing had

102
0:04:42.98,000 --> 0:04:46,000
been published on the public health

103
0:04:45.02,000 --> 0:04:49,000
effects of coal mining in the United

104
0:04:47.3,000 --> 0:04:5,000
States let me say that again nothing had

105
0:04:49.49,000 --> 0:04:53,000
been published on the public health

106
0:04:51.17,000 --> 0:04:57,000
effects of coal mining in the US so I

107
0:04:54.29,000 --> 0:04:59,000
thought I can make a new contribution no

108
0:04:57.44,000 --> 0:05:02,000
matter what I find to either confirm

109
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
these concerns or to alleviate them I

110
0:05:03.23,000 --> 0:05:09,000
had no personal or organizational agenda

111
0:05:06.7,000 --> 0:05:1,000
many of my colleagues initially were

112
0:05:09.23,000 --> 0:05:13,000
skeptical that there would be any link

113
0:05:11.09,000 --> 0:05:15,000
between public health and mining they

114
0:05:13.37,000 --> 0:05:17,000
predicted that the health problems could

115
0:05:15.2,000 --> 0:05:21,000
be explained by poverty or by lifestyle

116
0:05:18.32,000 --> 0:05:23,000
issues like smoking and obesity when I

117
0:05:21.38,000 --> 0:05:26,000
started I thought maybe they would be

118
0:05:23.48,000 --> 0:05:28,000
right we started by analyzing existing

119
0:05:27.2,000 --> 0:05:31,000
databases that allowed us to link

120
0:05:28.94,000 --> 0:05:33,000
population health to mining activity and

121
0:05:31.28,000 --> 0:05:36,000
to control statistically for age sex

122
0:05:34.07,000 --> 0:05:39,000
race smoking obesity poverty education

123
0:05:37.19,000 --> 0:05:43,000
health insurance and others we could

124
0:05:39.979,000 --> 0:05:44,000
measure we found evidence that confirmed

125
0:05:43.7,000 --> 0:05:47,000
the concerns of the residents and we

126
0:05:45.65,000 --> 0:05:5,000
started to publish our findings as a

127
0:05:48.65,000 --> 0:05:52,000
very brief summary we found that people

128
0:05:50.96,000 --> 0:05:55,000
who live where mountaintop removal takes

129
0:05:52.91,000 --> 0:05:57,000
place have significantly higher levels

130
0:05:56,000 --> 0:06:02,000
of cardiovascular disease kidney disease

131
0:05:58.49,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and chronic lung disease like COPD death

132
0:06:02.66,000 --> 0:06:06,000
rates from cancer are significantly

133
0:06:04.64,000 --> 0:06:08,000
elevated especially for lung cancer

134
0:06:06.85,000 --> 0:06:1,000
we've seen evidence for higher rates of

135
0:06:09.169,000 --> 0:06:14,000
birth defects and for babies born at low

136
0:06:11.51,000 --> 0:06:16,000
birth weight the difference in total

137
0:06:14.27,000 --> 0:06:19,000
mortality equates to about 1,200 excess

138
0:06:17.18,000 --> 0:06:23,000
deaths every year in Mt our areas

139
0:06:19.69,000 --> 0:06:25,000
controlling for other risks 1,200 excess

140
0:06:23.54,000 --> 0:06:28,000
deaths every year not only our death

141
0:06:26.57,000 --> 0:06:29,000
rates higher but they increase as levels

142
0:06:28.79,000 --> 0:06:32,000
of mining go up in a dose-response

143
0:06:30.14,000 --> 0:06:35,000
manner next we started to conduct

144
0:06:33.56,000 --> 0:06:37,000
community door-to-door health surveys we

145
0:06:35.63,000 --> 0:06:39,000
surveyed people living within a few

146
0:06:37.94,000 --> 0:06:42,000
miles of MTR versus similar rural

147
0:06:40.13,000 --> 0:06:44,000
communities without mine survey results

148
0:06:43.04,000 --> 0:06:47,000
show higher levels of personal and

149
0:06:44.9,000 --> 0:06:48,000
family illness self-reported health

150
0:06:47.09,000 --> 0:06:51,000
status is poorer and illness symptoms

151
0:06:49.19,000 --> 0:06:56,000
across a broad spectrum are more common

152
0:06:52.03,000 --> 0:06:58,000
these studies are only associational we

153
0:06:56.42,000 --> 0:07:,000
all know the correlation does not prove

154
0:06:58.58,000 --> 0:07:02,000
causation these studies did not include

155
0:07:01.37,000 --> 0:07:05,000
data on the actual environmental

156
0:07:03.11,000 --> 0:07:09,000
conditions in mining communities so we

157
0:07:06.23,000 --> 0:07:11,000
started to collect and report on that we

158
0:07:09.71,000 --> 0:07:12,000
found that violations of public drinking

159
0:07:11.42,000 --> 0:07:15,000
water standards are seven times more

160
0:07:13.31,000 --> 0:07:19,000
common in MTR areas versus non mining

161
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
areas we collected air samples and found

162
0:07:19.58,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that particulate matter is elevated in

163
0:07:21.29,000 --> 0:07:25,000
mining communities especially in the

164
0:07:22.88,000 --> 0:07:26,000
ultrafine range the dust and mining

165
0:07:25.79,000 --> 0:07:29,000
communities contains a complex mixture

166
0:07:27.86,000 --> 0:07:32,000
but includes high levels of silica a

167
0:07:30.56,000 --> 0:07:35,000
known lung carcinogen and potentially

168
0:07:33.59,000 --> 0:07:38,000
harmful organic compounds we use the

169
0:07:36.23,000 --> 0:07:4,000
dust in laboratory experiments and found

170
0:07:38.66,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that it induced cardiovascular

171
0:07:40.43,000 --> 0:07:44,000
dysfunction in rats the dust also

172
0:07:43.07,000 --> 0:07:49,000
promoted the development of lung cancer

173
0:07:45.169,000 --> 0:07:5,000
in human in vitro lung cells this is

174
0:07:49.46,000 --> 0:07:55,000
just a quick summary of some of our

175
0:07:51.05,000 --> 0:07:58,000
studies the coal industry does not like

176
0:07:55.52,000 --> 0:08:01,000
what we have to say neither does the

177
0:07:58.88,000 --> 0:08:03,000
government in coal country just like the

178
0:08:01.76,000 --> 0:08:06,000
tobacco industry paid for research to

179
0:08:04.4,000 --> 0:08:08,000
defend the safety of smoking so the coal

180
0:08:06.98,000 --> 0:08:09,000
industry has tried to do the same by

181
0:08:08.66,000 --> 0:08:13,000
paying people to write papers claiming

182
0:08:10.73,000 --> 0:08:15,000
that MTR is safe lawyers have sent me

183
0:08:13.97,000 --> 0:08:17,000
harassing demands under the Freedom of

184
0:08:15.74,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Information Act eventually denied by the

185
0:08:18.2,000 --> 0:08:23,000
courts I've been attacked at public

186
0:08:20.9,000 --> 0:08:24,000
testimony at a congressional hearing by

187
0:08:23.27,000 --> 0:08:28,000
a congressman with ties to the energy

188
0:08:25.25,000 --> 0:08:3,000
industry one governor has publicly

189
0:08:28.58,000 --> 0:08:33,000
declared that he refuses to read the

190
0:08:30.71,000 --> 0:08:35,000
research and after a meeting with a

191
0:08:34.31,000 --> 0:08:38,000
member of Congress in which I

192
0:08:36.44,000 --> 0:08:4,000
specifically shared my research I later

193
0:08:38.659,000 --> 0:08:42,000
heard that representatives say they knew

194
0:08:40.76,000 --> 0:08:44,000
nothing about it I worked with

195
0:08:43.339,000 --> 0:08:46,000
scientists at the US Geological Survey

196
0:08:45.05,000 --> 0:08:49,000
on environmental sampling for more than

197
0:08:47.15,000 --> 0:08:5,000
two years and just as they were starting

198
0:08:49.52,000 --> 0:08:51,000
to publish their findings they were

199
0:08:50.93,000 --> 0:08:53,000
suddenly instruct

200
0:08:51.83,000 --> 0:08:57,000
to by their superiors to stop work on

201
0:08:54.05,000 --> 0:08:59,000
this project in August of this year the

202
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
National Academies of Sciences was

203
0:09:00.02,000 --> 0:09:03,000
suddenly instructed by the federal

204
0:09:01.79,000 --> 0:09:05,000
government to stop their independent

205
0:09:03.65,000 --> 0:09:08,000
review of the public health consequences

206
0:09:06.08,000 --> 0:09:12,000
of surface mining these actions are

207
0:09:08.75,000 --> 0:09:14,000
politically motivated in my view but

208
0:09:12.44,000 --> 0:09:17,000
there is opposition from researchers to

209
0:09:15.34,000 --> 0:09:21,000
at conferences or meetings they express

210
0:09:18.35,000 --> 0:09:24,000
skepticism okay we're all taught as

211
0:09:21.89,000 --> 0:09:26,000
scientists to be skeptical they ask what

212
0:09:25.13,000 --> 0:09:29,000
about this possible explanation have you

213
0:09:27.65,000 --> 0:09:31,000
considered that alternative

214
0:09:29.15,000 --> 0:09:34,000
interpretation they wonder there must be

215
0:09:32.18,000 --> 0:09:36,000
some confounder that we missed some

216
0:09:34.58,000 --> 0:09:39,000
other variable we haven't accounted for

217
0:09:36.89,000 --> 0:09:42,000
an in vitro study what does that prove a

218
0:09:40.1,000 --> 0:09:46,000
rat study how do we know the same

219
0:09:43.55,000 --> 0:09:49,000
effects would be found in people maybe

220
0:09:46.67,000 --> 0:09:5,000
so technically you have to acknowledge

221
0:09:49.64,000 --> 0:09:54,000
that they could be right but you know

222
0:09:51.59,000 --> 0:09:58,000
maybe these health problems are not the

223
0:09:55.31,000 --> 0:10:,000
result of some unmeasured confound maybe

224
0:09:58.82,000 --> 0:10:03,000
they result from blowing up mountains

225
0:10:01.07,000 --> 0:10:04,000
over people's heads

226
0:10:11.34,000 --> 0:10:16,000
there can always be doubt if doubt is

227
0:10:14.2,000 --> 0:10:19,000
what you seek because we can never do

228
0:10:16.72,000 --> 0:10:22,000
that defining experiment any next study

229
0:10:19.3,000 --> 0:10:24,000
must always be associational so perhaps

230
0:10:23.14,000 --> 0:10:27,000
you can understand why I've started to

231
0:10:24.91,000 --> 0:10:29,000
wonder how much evidence is in doff I've

232
0:10:28,000 --> 0:10:33,000
published over 30 papers on this topic

233
0:10:30.22,000 --> 0:10:34,000
so far along with my co-authors other

234
0:10:33.19,000 --> 0:10:36,000
researchers have added to the evidence

235
0:10:34.99,000 --> 0:10:37,000
yet government doesn't want to listen

236
0:10:36.49,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and the industry says it's only

237
0:10:38.74,000 --> 0:10:42,000
correlational they say Appalachian self

238
0:10:41.44,000 --> 0:10:45,000
lifestyle issues as though it had never

239
0:10:43.57,000 --> 0:10:47,000
occurred to us to control for smoking or

240
0:10:46.03,000 --> 0:10:5,000
obesity or poverty or education or

241
0:10:47.71,000 --> 0:10:52,000
health insurance we controlled for all

242
0:10:50.32,000 --> 0:10:56,000
of those and more there comes a point

243
0:10:53.38,000 --> 0:10:59,000
where we don't need more research where

244
0:10:56.92,000 --> 0:11:01,000
we can't ask people to be unwilling

245
0:10:59.41,000 --> 0:11:05,000
research subjects so we can do the next

246
0:11:02.41,000 --> 0:11:07,000
study as scientists we follow the data

247
0:11:06.13,000 --> 0:11:09,000
wherever it goes but sometimes data can

248
0:11:08.08,000 --> 0:11:12,000
only take us so far and we have to

249
0:11:09.76,000 --> 0:11:13,000
decide as thinking feeling human beings

250
0:11:12.31,000 --> 0:11:17,000
what it means and when it is time to act

251
0:11:14.53,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I think that is true not only for MTR

252
0:11:17.68,000 --> 0:11:22,000
but for other situations where evidence

253
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
is strong and concerning but imperfect

254
0:11:23.08,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and when failing to act if you're wrong

255
0:11:25.8,000 --> 0:11:32,000
means people's lives it may seem strange

256
0:11:30.31,000 --> 0:11:34,000
that there is any controversy over the

257
0:11:32.89,000 --> 0:11:36,000
health effects of mountaintop removal

258
0:11:34.69,000 --> 0:11:38,000
mining but somehow this subject has

259
0:11:37.75,000 --> 0:11:4,000
wound up in a scientific and political

260
0:11:39.22,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Twilight Zone alongside the debate over

261
0:11:41.56,000 --> 0:11:45,000
climate change or the argument years ago

262
0:11:44.02,000 --> 0:11:49,000
about whether or not smoking caused

263
0:11:45.79,000 --> 0:11:5,000
cancer in this Twilight Zone much of the

264
0:11:49.3,000 --> 0:11:53,000
data seems to point to one conclusion

265
0:11:50.98,000 --> 0:11:54,000
with the economics or the politics or

266
0:11:53.35,000 --> 0:11:58,000
the prevailing public view insists on

267
0:11:55.72,000 --> 0:11:59,000
the opposite conclusion when your

268
0:11:58.48,000 --> 0:12:01,000
scientist and you think you have a valid

269
0:12:00.19,000 --> 0:12:03,000
insight where the health of entire

270
0:12:01.72,000 --> 0:12:06,000
populations is at stake but you find

271
0:12:04.06,000 --> 0:12:09,000
yourself trapped in this twilight zone

272
0:12:06.97,000 --> 0:12:13,000
of denial and disbelief what is your

273
0:12:09.79,000 --> 0:12:15,000
moral and ethical obligation obviously

274
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
scientists are responsible for telling

275
0:12:16.3,000 --> 0:12:2,000
the truth as they see it based on

276
0:12:18.07,000 --> 0:12:22,000
evidence simply stated we have an

277
0:12:20.47,000 --> 0:12:24,000
obligation to stand up for the data

278
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:26,000
it can be extremely frustrating to wait

279
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
around for public opinion or political

280
0:12:26.9,000 --> 0:12:3,000
consensus to catch up to the scientific

281
0:12:28.82,000 --> 0:12:32,000
understanding but the more controversial

282
0:12:31.07,000 --> 0:12:35,000
the subject and the more frustrating the

283
0:12:33.2,000 --> 0:12:36,000
debate the more critical it is for

284
0:12:35.36,000 --> 0:12:4,000
scientists to preserve our objectivity

285
0:12:37.1,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and our reputation for integrity because

286
0:12:40.94,000 --> 0:12:44,000
integrity is the coin of the realm in

287
0:12:43.43,000 --> 0:12:47,000
scientific and public policy debate in

288
0:12:45.62,000 --> 0:12:49,000
the long run our reputation for

289
0:12:48.02,000 --> 0:12:52,000
integrity is the most powerful tool that

290
0:12:50.18,000 --> 0:12:55,000
we have even more powerful than the data

291
0:12:52.91,000 --> 0:12:56,000
itself without an acknowledged integrity

292
0:12:56.06,000 --> 0:12:59,000
on the part of scientists no amount of

293
0:12:57.71,000 --> 0:13:02,000
data will ever convince people to

294
0:12:59.66,000 --> 0:13:05,000
believe painful or difficult truths but

295
0:13:03.11,000 --> 0:13:08,000
when we cultivate and guard our

296
0:13:05.68,000 --> 0:13:09,000
reputation for integrity when we

297
0:13:08.39,000 --> 0:13:11,000
patiently stand up for the data and keep

298
0:13:10.4,000 --> 0:13:13,000
doing the studies and keep calmly

299
0:13:11.93,000 --> 0:13:16,000
bringing the results to the public

300
0:13:13.4,000 --> 0:13:2,000
that's when we have our greatest impact

301
0:13:17.53,000 --> 0:13:25,000
eventually scientific truth does and

302
0:13:20.87,000 --> 0:13:28,000
will win out how many lives will be lost

303
0:13:26.27,000 --> 0:13:33,000
while we wait too many already

304
0:13:29.38,000 --> 0:13:41,000
but prevail we will

305
0:13:33.32,000 --> 0:13:45,000

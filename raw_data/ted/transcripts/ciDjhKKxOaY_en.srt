1
0:00:12.968,000 --> 0:00:14,000
We live in a world where the collection of data

2
0:00:15.19,000 --> 0:00:17,000
is happening 24 hours a day, seven days a week,

3
0:00:17.762,000 --> 0:00:19,000
365 days a year.

4
0:00:20.73,000 --> 0:00:24,000
This data is usually collected by what we call a front-desk specialist now.

5
0:00:25.077,000 --> 0:00:28,000
These are the retail clerks at your favorite department stores,

6
0:00:28.221,000 --> 0:00:3,000
the cashiers at the grocery stores,

7
0:00:30.688,000 --> 0:00:32,000
the registration specialists at the hospital

8
0:00:33.317,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and even the person that sold you your last movie ticket.

9
0:00:36.908,000 --> 0:00:39,000
They ask discreet questions, like: "May I please have your zip code?"

10
0:00:40.807,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Or, "Would you like to use your savings card today?"

11
0:00:44.369,000 --> 0:00:46,000
All of which gives us data.

12
0:00:46.702,000 --> 0:00:5,000
However, the conversation becomes a little bit more complex

13
0:00:51.313,000 --> 0:00:54,000
when the more difficult questions need to be asked.

14
0:00:54.655,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Let me tell you a story, see.

15
0:00:56.75,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Once upon a time, there was a woman named Miss Margaret.

16
0:00:59.792,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Miss Margaret had been a front-desk specialist

17
0:01:01.967,000 --> 0:01:02,000
for almost 20 years.

18
0:01:03.451,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And in all that time, she has never, and I do mean never,

19
0:01:07.292,000 --> 0:01:1,000
had to ask a patient their gender, race or ethnicity.

20
0:01:10.836,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Because, see, now Miss Margaret has the ability to just look at you.

21
0:01:14.083,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Uh-huh.

22
0:01:15.265,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And she can tell if you are a boy or a girl,

23
0:01:18.066,000 --> 0:01:21,000
black or white, American or non-American.

24
0:01:21.327,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And in her mind, those were the only categories.

25
0:01:24.589,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So imagine that grave day,

26
0:01:26.629,000 --> 0:01:3,000
when her sassy supervisor invited her to this "change everything" meeting

27
0:01:31.546,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and told her that would have to ask each and every last one of her patients

28
0:01:35.204,000 --> 0:01:36,000
to self-identify.

29
0:01:36.633,000 --> 0:01:4,000
She gave her six genders, eight races and over 100 ethnicities.

30
0:01:41.427,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Well, now, Miss Margaret was appalled.

31
0:01:44.039,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I mean, highly offended.

32
0:01:45.46,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So much so that she marched down to that human-resource department

33
0:01:48.815,000 --> 0:01:5,000
to see if she was eligible for an early retirement.

34
0:01:51.363,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And she ended her rant by saying

35
0:01:53.347,000 --> 0:01:57,000
that her sassy supervisor invited her to this "change everything" meeting

36
0:01:58.241,000 --> 0:02:,000
and didn't, didn't, even, even

37
0:02:00.289,000 --> 0:02:03,000
bring, bring food, food, food, food.

38
0:02:03.341,000 --> 0:02:04,000
(Laughter)

39
0:02:04.519,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Applause) (Cheers)

40
0:02:10.681,000 --> 0:02:12,000
You know you've got to bring food to these meetings.

41
0:02:13.139,000 --> 0:02:15,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:15.506,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Anyway.

43
0:02:16.689,000 --> 0:02:17,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:18.221,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Now, that was an example of a healthcare setting,

45
0:02:21.014,000 --> 0:02:24,000
but of course, all businesses collect some form of data.

46
0:02:24.371,000 --> 0:02:27,000
True story: I was going to wire some money.

47
0:02:28.165,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And the customer service representative asked me

48
0:02:30.744,000 --> 0:02:32,000
if I was born in the United States.

49
0:02:33.419,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Now, I hesitated to answer her question,

50
0:02:35.824,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and before she even realized why I hesitated,

51
0:02:38.978,000 --> 0:02:41,000
she began to throw the company she worked for under the bus.

52
0:02:42.017,000 --> 0:02:47,000
She said, "Girl, I know it's stupid, but they makin' us ask this question."

53
0:02:47.113,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:48.288,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Because of the way she presented it to me,

55
0:02:50.385,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I was like, "Girl, why?

56
0:02:52.561,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Why they makin' you ask this question?

57
0:02:54.815,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Is they deportin' people?"

58
0:02:56.641,000 --> 0:02:58,000
(Laughter)

59
0:02:58.807,000 --> 0:03:,000
But then I had to turn on the other side of me,

60
0:03:01.053,000 --> 0:03:03,000
the more professional speaker-poet side of me.

61
0:03:04.164,000 --> 0:03:08,000
The one that understood that there were little Miss Margarets all over the place.

62
0:03:08.871,000 --> 0:03:1,000
People who were good people, maybe even good employees,

63
0:03:11.863,000 --> 0:03:13,000
but lacked the ability to ask their questions properly

64
0:03:14.439,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and unfortunately, that made her look bad,

65
0:03:16.998,000 --> 0:03:19,000
but the worst, that made the business look even worse

66
0:03:20.268,000 --> 0:03:21,000
than how she was looking.

67
0:03:22.236,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Because she had no idea who I was.

68
0:03:24.027,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I mean, I literally could have been a woman who was scheduled to do a TED Talk

69
0:03:27.736,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and would use her as an example.

70
0:03:29.538,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Imagine that.

71
0:03:30.862,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Applause)

72
0:03:35.148,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And unfortunately,

73
0:03:36.355,000 --> 0:03:38,000
what happens is people would decline to answer the questions,

74
0:03:39.274,000 --> 0:03:41,000
because they feel like you would use the information

75
0:03:41.807,000 --> 0:03:42,000
to discriminate against them,

76
0:03:43.256,000 --> 0:03:45,000
all because of how you presented the information.

77
0:03:45.671,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And at that point, we get bad data.

78
0:03:47.473,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And everybody knows what bad data does.

79
0:03:49.608,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Bad data costs you time, it costs you money

80
0:03:52.425,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and it costs you resources.

81
0:03:54.395,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Unfortunately, when you have bad data,

82
0:03:56.982,000 --> 0:03:59,000
it also costs you a lot more,

83
0:04:00.085,000 --> 0:04:02,000
because we have health disparities,

84
0:04:02.504,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and we have social determinants of health,

85
0:04:04.742,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and we have the infant mortality,

86
0:04:06.424,000 --> 0:04:08,000
all of which depends on the data that we collect,

87
0:04:09.091,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and if we have bad data, than we have those issues still.

88
0:04:12.363,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And we have underprivileged populations

89
0:04:14.286,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that remain unfortunate and underprivileged,

90
0:04:17.101,000 --> 0:04:2,000
because the data that we're using is either outdated,

91
0:04:21.051,000 --> 0:04:24,000
or is not good at all or we don't have anything at all.

92
0:04:24.987,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Now, wouldn't it be amazing if people like Miss Margaret

93
0:04:27.647,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and the customer-service representative at the wiring place

94
0:04:30.821,000 --> 0:04:34,000
were graced to collect data with compassionate care?

95
0:04:35.562,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Can I explain to you what I mean by "graced?"

96
0:04:38.324,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I wrote an acrostic poem.

97
0:04:40.3,000 --> 0:04:44,000
G: Getting the front desk specialist involved and letting them know

98
0:04:45.097,000 --> 0:04:48,000
R: the Relevance of their role as they become

99
0:04:49.074,000 --> 0:04:52,000
A: Accountable for the accuracy of data while implementing

100
0:04:52.629,000 --> 0:04:56,000
C: Compassionate care within all encounters by becoming

101
0:04:56.697,000 --> 0:04:59,000
E: Equipped with the education needed to inform people

102
0:05:00.022,000 --> 0:05:03,000
of why data collection is so important.

103
0:05:04.315,000 --> 0:05:06,000
(Applause)

104
0:05:07.288,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Now, I'm an artist.

105
0:05:09.408,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And so what happens with me

106
0:05:11.106,000 --> 0:05:13,000
is that when I create something artistically,

107
0:05:13.304,000 --> 0:05:14,000
the trainer in me is awakened as well.

108
0:05:15.251,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So what I did was, I began to develop that acrostic poem into a full training

109
0:05:19.347,000 --> 0:05:2,000
entitled "I'm G.R.A.C.E.D."

110
0:05:20.919,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Because I remember, being the front-desk specialist,

111
0:05:23.784,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and when I went to the office of equity to start working,

112
0:05:26.482,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I was like, "Is that why they asked us to ask that question?"

113
0:05:30.061,000 --> 0:05:31,000
It all became a bright light to me,

114
0:05:31.853,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and I realized that I asked people and I told people about --

115
0:05:35.514,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I called them by the wrong gender, I called them by the wrong race,

116
0:05:38.822,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I called them by the wrong ethnicity,

117
0:05:40.649,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and the environment became hostile,

118
0:05:42.68,000 --> 0:05:46,000
people was offended and I was frustrated because I was not graced.

119
0:05:46.988,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I remember my computerized training,

120
0:05:49.599,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and unfortunately, that training did not prepare me to deescalate a situation.

121
0:05:55.249,000 --> 0:05:58,000
It did not prepare me to have teachable moments when I had questions

122
0:05:58.649,000 --> 0:05:59,000
about asking the questions.

123
0:06:00.331,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I would look at the computer and say, "So, what do I do when this happens?"

124
0:06:03.919,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And the computer would say ...

125
0:06:05.801,000 --> 0:06:08,000
nothing, because a computer cannot talk back to you.

126
0:06:09.093,000 --> 0:06:12,000
(Laughter)

127
0:06:12.324,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So that's the importance of having someone there

128
0:06:14.919,000 --> 0:06:16,000
who was trained to teach you and tell you what you do

129
0:06:17.72,000 --> 0:06:18,000
in situations like that.

130
0:06:20.03,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So, when I created the "I'm G.R.A.C.E.D" training,

131
0:06:22.68,000 --> 0:06:24,000
I created it with that experience that I had in mind,

132
0:06:25.698,000 --> 0:06:27,000
but also that conviction that I had in mind.

133
0:06:28.238,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Because I wanted the instructional design of it

134
0:06:30.515,000 --> 0:06:32,000
to be a safe space for open dialogue for people.

135
0:06:33.317,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I wanted to talk about biases,

136
0:06:35.236,000 --> 0:06:37,000
the unconscious ones and the conscious ones,

137
0:06:37.657,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and what we do.

138
0:06:38.847,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Because now I know that when you engage people in the why,

139
0:06:42.815,000 --> 0:06:45,000
it challenges their perspective, and it changes their attitudes.

140
0:06:46.315,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Now I know that data that we have at the front desk

141
0:06:49.498,000 --> 0:06:53,000
translates into research that eliminates disparities and finds cures.

142
0:06:54.335,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Now I know that teaching people transitional change

143
0:06:58.065,000 --> 0:07:,000
instead of shocking them into change

144
0:07:00.935,000 --> 0:07:03,000
is always a better way of implementing change.

145
0:07:04.214,000 --> 0:07:07,000
See, now I know people are more likely to share information

146
0:07:07.284,000 --> 0:07:1,000
when they are treated with respect by knowledgeable staff members.

147
0:07:11.167,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Now I know that you don't have to be a statistician

148
0:07:14.212,000 --> 0:07:17,000
to understand the power and the purpose of data,

149
0:07:17.237,000 --> 0:07:21,000
but you do have to treat people with respect and have compassionate care.

150
0:07:21.625,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Now I know that when you've been graced,

151
0:07:24.474,000 --> 0:07:27,000
it is your responsibility to empower somebody else.

152
0:07:27.874,000 --> 0:07:29,000
But most importantly, now I know

153
0:07:30.323,000 --> 0:07:32,000
that when teaching human beings

154
0:07:32.76,000 --> 0:07:35,000
to communicate with other human beings,

155
0:07:35.863,000 --> 0:07:38,000
it should be delivered by a human being.

156
0:07:40.117,000 --> 0:07:46,000
(Applause)

157
0:07:46.933,000 --> 0:07:47,000

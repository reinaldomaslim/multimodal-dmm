1
0:00:15.825,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm an Iranian-American Muslim female,

2
0:00:18.167,000 --> 0:00:19,000
like all of you.

3
0:00:19.455,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And I'm also a social justice comedian,

4
0:00:21.788,000 --> 0:00:23,000
something that I insist is an actual job.

5
0:00:24.127,000 --> 0:00:26,000
To explain what that is, let me tell you how I got here.

6
0:00:26.818,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I've performed all over the country.

7
0:00:28.597,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And let me tell you, America is majestic, right?

8
0:00:30.918,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It's got breathtaking nature,

9
0:00:32.667,000 --> 0:00:33,000
waffle houses

10
0:00:33.841,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and diabetes as far as the eye can see.

11
0:00:35.848,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It is really something.

12
0:00:37.784,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Now, the American population can be broken up

13
0:00:40.047,000 --> 0:00:41,000
into three main categories:

14
0:00:41.612,000 --> 0:00:42,000
there's mostly wonderful people,

15
0:00:43.374,000 --> 0:00:44,000
haters

16
0:00:44.549,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and Florida.

17
0:00:45.724,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Laughter)

18
0:00:47.331,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Besides Florida, the most troubling category here are the Haters.

19
0:00:50.669,000 --> 0:00:52,000
They are a minority,

20
0:00:52.882,000 --> 0:00:54,000
but they overcompensate by being extra loud.

21
0:00:55.409,000 --> 0:00:57,000
They have the Napoleon complex of demographics,

22
0:00:57.742,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and yes, some of the men do wear heels.

23
0:00:59.834,000 --> 0:01:01,000
As a social justice comedian,

24
0:01:01.961,000 --> 0:01:02,000
it's my goal to convert these haters,

25
0:01:03.853,000 --> 0:01:06,000
because they hate a lot of things, which leads to negative outcomes,

26
0:01:07.083,000 --> 0:01:1,000
like racism, violence and Ted Nugent.

27
0:01:11.4,000 --> 0:01:12,000
This is not an exhaustive list;

28
0:01:13.306,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I'm probably missing 3-7 items.

29
0:01:15.004,000 --> 0:01:16,000
But the point is,

30
0:01:16.25,000 --> 0:01:17,000
we have to reckon with the haters.

31
0:01:18.003,000 --> 0:01:19,000
But there's variance within this group

32
0:01:19.838,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and it's not efficient to go after all of them, right?

33
0:01:22.883,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So what I've done is created a highly scientific Taxonomy of Haters.

34
0:01:26.42,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I basically took all of the haters,

35
0:01:28.167,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I put them in a petri dish, like a scientist,

36
0:01:31.037,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and this is what I found.

37
0:01:32.52,000 --> 0:01:33,000
(Laughter)

38
0:01:33.695,000 --> 0:01:35,000
First off, we have the trolls.

39
0:01:36.013,000 --> 0:01:38,000
These are your garden-variety digital haters.

40
0:01:38.42,000 --> 0:01:39,000
They're the people who quit their jobs

41
0:01:40.31,000 --> 0:01:43,000
so they can post on YouTube videos all day long.

42
0:01:43.448,000 --> 0:01:45,000
There's also the drive-by haters.

43
0:01:46.133,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Now, these people will be at a stoplight,

44
0:01:48.449,000 --> 0:01:49,000
they'll wait for the light to turn green

45
0:01:50.442,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and when it does, they yell, "Go back to your own country!"

46
0:01:53.288,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Now back in the day, they would've actually gotten out of their cars

47
0:01:56.529,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and hated you to your face.

48
0:01:57.845,000 --> 0:01:59,000
But they just don't make them like they used to --

49
0:02:00.247,000 --> 0:02:02,000
which is another sign of the decline in America.

50
0:02:02.556,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Laughter)

51
0:02:04.293,000 --> 0:02:05,000
The next category

52
0:02:05.468,000 --> 0:02:07,000
is the mission-oriented-bigot- whose-group-affiliation-

53
0:02:08.135,000 --> 0:02:09,000
gives-them-cover-for-hating hater.

54
0:02:09.827,000 --> 0:02:12,000
These guys like to hate via a seemingly nice organization,

55
0:02:13.389,000 --> 0:02:15,000
like a church or a nonprofit,

56
0:02:15.586,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and they oftentimes like to speak in an old-timey voice.

57
0:02:18.324,000 --> 0:02:22,000
But the group I'm most interested in is the swing hater.

58
0:02:22.888,000 --> 0:02:25,000
The swing hater is sister to the swing voter --

59
0:02:26.499,000 --> 0:02:27,000
they just can't decide!

60
0:02:28.252,000 --> 0:02:29,000
They're like ideological sluts

61
0:02:30.154,000 --> 0:02:31,000
who move from hating to not hating.

62
0:02:32.168,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And they do it because they don't have enough information.

63
0:02:34.947,000 --> 0:02:36,000
This is the group I like to target with social justice comedy.

64
0:02:37.949,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Why comedy?

65
0:02:39.283,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Because on a scale of comedy to brochure,

66
0:02:41.836,000 --> 0:02:44,000
the average American prefers comedy, as you can see from this graph.

67
0:02:45.558,000 --> 0:02:46,000
(Laughter)

68
0:02:46.733,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Comedy is very popular.

69
0:02:48.117,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And by the way,

70
0:02:49.292,000 --> 0:02:5,000
this is a mathematically accurate graph,

71
0:02:51.262,000 --> 0:02:52,000
generated from fake numbers.

72
0:02:52.81,000 --> 0:02:53,000
(Laughter)

73
0:02:54.311,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Now, the question is:

74
0:02:55.52,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Why does social justice comedy work?

75
0:02:58.329,000 --> 0:03:,000
Because, first off, it makes you laugh.

76
0:03:01.052,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And when you're laughing, you enter into a state of openness.

77
0:03:04.238,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And in that moment of openness,

78
0:03:05.82,000 --> 0:03:08,000
a good social justice comedian can stick in a whole bunch of information,

79
0:03:09.508,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and if they're really skilled,

80
0:03:11.062,000 --> 0:03:12,000
a rectal exam.

81
0:03:12.237,000 --> 0:03:14,000
(Laughter)

82
0:03:14.794,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Here are some ground rules for social justice comedy:

83
0:03:18.019,000 --> 0:03:19,000
first off, it's not partisan.

84
0:03:20.002,000 --> 0:03:22,000
This isn't political comedy, this is about justice,

85
0:03:22.567,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and no one is against justice.

86
0:03:24.288,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Two, it's inviting and warm,

87
0:03:26.305,000 --> 0:03:28,000
it makes you feel like you're sitting inside of a burrito.

88
0:03:29.09,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Three, it's funny but sneaky,

89
0:03:31.519,000 --> 0:03:33,000
like you could be hearing an interesting treatise

90
0:03:34.339,000 --> 0:03:35,000
on income inequality,

91
0:03:35.577,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that's encased in a really sophisticated poop joke.

92
0:03:38.515,000 --> 0:03:39,000
(Laughter)

93
0:03:40.158,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Here's how I see social justice comedy working.

94
0:03:43.205,000 --> 0:03:46,000
A few years ago, I rounded up a bunch of Muslim-American comedians --

95
0:03:46.527,000 --> 0:03:47,000
in a non-violent way --

96
0:03:47.717,000 --> 0:03:48,000
(Laughter)

97
0:03:49.265,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And we went around the country

98
0:03:50.761,000 --> 0:03:52,000
to places like Alabama, Arizona, Tennessee, Georgia --

99
0:03:53.722,000 --> 0:03:55,000
places where they love the Muzzies --

100
0:03:55.945,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and we did stand-up shows.

101
0:03:58.657,000 --> 0:04:,000
We called the tour "The Muslims Are Coming!"

102
0:04:00.995,000 --> 0:04:02,000
(Laughter)

103
0:04:03.284,000 --> 0:04:04,000
We turned this into a movie,

104
0:04:05.014,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and then after the movie came out,

105
0:04:07.262,000 --> 0:04:1,000
a known hate group spent 300,000 dollars

106
0:04:10.689,000 --> 0:04:12,000
on an anti-Muslim poster campaign

107
0:04:12.834,000 --> 0:04:14,000
with the MTA -- that's the New York City subway system.

108
0:04:15.729,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Now, the posters were truly offensive,

109
0:04:17.599,000 --> 0:04:18,000
not to mentioned poorly designed --

110
0:04:19.384,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I mean, if you're going to be bigoted,

111
0:04:21.242,000 --> 0:04:22,000
you might as well use a better font.

112
0:04:23.018,000 --> 0:04:24,000
(Laughter)

113
0:04:24.043,000 --> 0:04:27,000
But we decided, why not launch our own poster campaign

114
0:04:28.019,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that says nice things about Muslims,

115
0:04:29.917,000 --> 0:04:3,000
while promoting the movie.

116
0:04:31.188,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So myself and fellow comedian Dean Obeidallah

117
0:04:33.337,000 --> 0:04:36,000
decided to launch the fighting-bigotry- with-delightful-posters campaign.

118
0:04:36.857,000 --> 0:04:39,000
We raised the money, worked with the MTA for over 5 months,

119
0:04:40.631,000 --> 0:04:41,000
got the posters approved,

120
0:04:41.966,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and two days after they were supposed to go up,

121
0:04:44.869,000 --> 0:04:47,000
the MTA decided to ban the posters,

122
0:04:48.04,000 --> 0:04:49,000
citing political content.

123
0:04:49.9,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Let's take a look at a couple of those posters.

124
0:04:52.157,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Here's one.

125
0:04:53.475,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Facts about Muslims:

126
0:04:54.713,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Muslims invented the concept of a hospital.

127
0:04:56.834,000 --> 0:04:57,000
OK.

128
0:04:58.009,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Fact: Grown-up Muslims can do more push-ups than baby Muslims.

129
0:05:02.04,000 --> 0:05:03,000
(Laughter)

130
0:05:03.603,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Fact: Muslims invented Justin Timberlake.

131
0:05:06.475,000 --> 0:05:07,000
(Laughter)

132
0:05:07.578,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Let's take a look at another one.

133
0:05:09.484,000 --> 0:05:1,000
The ugly truth about Muslims:

134
0:05:10.937,000 --> 0:05:12,000
they have great frittata recipes.

135
0:05:13.549,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Now clearly, frittatas are considered political by the MTA.

136
0:05:18.08,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Either that, or the mere mention of Muslims in a positive light

137
0:05:21.561,000 --> 0:05:23,000
was considered political -- but it isn't.

138
0:05:23.609,000 --> 0:05:24,000
It's about justice.

139
0:05:24.886,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So we decided to change

140
0:05:26.069,000 --> 0:05:28,000
our fighting-bigortry- with-delightful-posters campaign

141
0:05:28.701,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and turn it into the fighting-bigotry- with-a-delightful-lawsuit campaign.

142
0:05:32.224,000 --> 0:05:33,000
(Laughter)

143
0:05:33.863,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So basically, what I'm saying is a couple of dirt-bag comedians

144
0:05:36.851,000 --> 0:05:38,000
took on a major New York City agency

145
0:05:39.406,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and the comedians won.

146
0:05:40.97,000 --> 0:05:42,000
(Applause and cheers)

147
0:05:43.57,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Thank you.

148
0:05:44.745,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Victory was a very weird feeling.

149
0:05:46.492,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I was like, "Is this what blonde girls feel like all the time?

150
0:05:49.452,000 --> 0:05:5,000
'Cause this is amazing!"

151
0:05:50.795,000 --> 0:05:52,000
(Laughter)

152
0:05:53.702,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Here's another example.

153
0:05:55.999,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I'm asked everywhere I go: "Why don't Muslims denounce terrorism?"

154
0:05:59.252,000 --> 0:06:01,000
We do. But OK, I'll take the bait.

155
0:06:01.467,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So I decided to launch thedailydenouncer.com.

156
0:06:04.137,000 --> 0:06:06,000
It's a website that denounces terrorism every day of the week,

157
0:06:07.121,000 --> 0:06:08,000
while taking the weekends off.

158
0:06:08.626,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Let's take a look at an example.

159
0:06:11.008,000 --> 0:06:13,000
They generally appear as single-panel cartoons,

160
0:06:13.429,000 --> 0:06:17,000
"I denounce terrorism! I also denounce people who never fill the paper tray!"

161
0:06:17.872,000 --> 0:06:19,000
The point of the website is that it denounces terrorism

162
0:06:20.711,000 --> 0:06:22,000
while recognizing that it's ridiculous

163
0:06:22.871,000 --> 0:06:24,000
that we have to constantly denounce terrorism.

164
0:06:25.656,000 --> 0:06:27,000
But if bigotry isn't your thing,

165
0:06:27.931,000 --> 0:06:3,000
social justice comedy is useful for all sorts of issues.

166
0:06:31.346,000 --> 0:06:33,000
For example, myself and fellow comedian Lee Camp

167
0:06:34.261,000 --> 0:06:37,000
went to the Cayman Islands to investigate offshore banking.

168
0:06:37.75,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Now, the United States loses something like 300 billion dollars a year

169
0:06:42.679,000 --> 0:06:43,000
in these offshore tax havens.

170
0:06:44.528,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Not to brag,

171
0:06:45.806,000 --> 0:06:46,000
but at the end of every month,

172
0:06:47.298,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I have something like 5-15 dollars in disposable income.

173
0:06:49.966,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So we walked into these banks in the Cayman Islands

174
0:06:52.462,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and asked if we could open up a bank account

175
0:06:54.642,000 --> 0:06:56,000
with eight dollars and 27 cents.

176
0:06:56.712,000 --> 0:06:57,000
(Laughter)

177
0:06:58.539,000 --> 0:07:03,000
The bank managers would indulge us for 30-45 seconds before calling security.

178
0:07:03.994,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Security would come out, brandish their weapons,

179
0:07:06.59,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and then we would squeal with fear and run away,

180
0:07:09.384,000 --> 0:07:12,000
because -- and this is the last rule of social justice comedy --

181
0:07:12.437,000 --> 0:07:14,000
sometimes it makes you want to take a dump in your pants.

182
0:07:15.175,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Most of my work is meant to be fun.

183
0:07:18.046,000 --> 0:07:21,000
It's meant to generate a connection and laughter.

184
0:07:21.157,000 --> 0:07:24,000
But yes, sometimes I get run off the grounds by security.

185
0:07:24.513,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Sometimes I get mean tweets and hate mail.

186
0:07:27.504,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Sometimes I get voice mails saying that if I continue telling my jokes,

187
0:07:32.403,000 --> 0:07:35,000
they'll kill me and they'll kill my family.

188
0:07:35.489,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And those death threats are definitely not funny.

189
0:07:39.287,000 --> 0:07:41,000
But despite the occasional danger,

190
0:07:41.445,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I still think that social justice comedy is one of our best weapons.

191
0:07:45.369,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I mean, we've tried a lot of approaches to social justice,

192
0:07:48.448,000 --> 0:07:5,000
like war and competitive ice dancing.

193
0:07:50.994,000 --> 0:07:53,000
But still, a lot of things are still kind of awful.

194
0:07:55.265,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So I think it's time we try and tell a really good poop joke.

195
0:07:59.033,000 --> 0:08:,000
Thank you.

196
0:08:00.208,000 --> 0:08:04,000
(Applause)

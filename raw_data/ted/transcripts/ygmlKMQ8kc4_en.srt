1
0:00:12.81,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I'd like to tell you a story about death and architecture.

2
0:00:16.841,000 --> 0:00:2,000
A hundred years ago, we tended to die of infectious diseases like pneumonia,

3
0:00:21.471,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that, if they took hold, would take us away quite quickly.

4
0:00:24.768,000 --> 0:00:27,000
We tended to die at home, in our own beds, looked after by family,

5
0:00:28.502,000 --> 0:00:29,000
although that was the default option

6
0:00:30.294,000 --> 0:00:32,000
because a lot of people lacked access to medical care.

7
0:00:33.614,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And then in the 20th century a lot of things changed.

8
0:00:36.393,000 --> 0:00:38,000
We developed new medicines like penicillin

9
0:00:38.49,000 --> 0:00:4,000
so we could treat those infectious diseases.

10
0:00:40.975,000 --> 0:00:43,000
New medical technologies like x-ray machines were invented.

11
0:00:44.249,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And because they were so big and expensive,

12
0:00:46.501,000 --> 0:00:49,000
we needed large, centralized buildings to keep them in,

13
0:00:49.519,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and they became our modern hospitals.

14
0:00:51.818,000 --> 0:00:52,000
After the Second World War,

15
0:00:53.241,000 --> 0:00:55,000
a lot of countries set up universal healthcare systems

16
0:00:55.881,000 --> 0:00:57,000
so that everyone who needed treatment could get it.

17
0:00:58.528,000 --> 0:01:02,000
The result was that lifespans extended from about 45 at the start of the century

18
0:01:02.777,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to almost double that today.

19
0:01:04.96,000 --> 0:01:08,000
The 20th century was this time of huge optimism about what science could offer,

20
0:01:09.058,000 --> 0:01:12,000
but with all of the focus on life, death was forgotten,

21
0:01:12.785,000 --> 0:01:14,000
even as our approach to death changed dramatically.

22
0:01:15.58,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Now, I'm an architect,

23
0:01:16.783,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and for the past year and a half I've been looking at these changes

24
0:01:20.025,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and at what they mean for architecture related to death and dying.

25
0:01:23.179,000 --> 0:01:26,000
We now tend to die of cancer and heart disease,

26
0:01:26.412,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and what that means is that many of us will have a long period of chronic illness

27
0:01:30.408,000 --> 0:01:31,000
at the end of our lives.

28
0:01:32.382,000 --> 0:01:33,000
During that period,

29
0:01:33.495,000 --> 0:01:38,000
we'll likely spend a lot of time in hospitals and hospices and care homes.

30
0:01:38.558,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Now, we've all been in a modern hospital.

31
0:01:40.764,000 --> 0:01:43,000
You know those fluorescent lights and the endless corridors

32
0:01:44.154,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and those rows of uncomfortable chairs.

33
0:01:47.172,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Hospital architecture has earned its bad reputation.

34
0:01:50.934,000 --> 0:01:53,000
But the surprising thing is, it wasn't always like this.

35
0:01:54.091,000 --> 0:01:58,000
This is L'Ospedale degli Innocenti, built in 1419 by Brunelleschi,

36
0:01:58.425,000 --> 0:02:01,000
who was one of the most famous and influential architects of his time.

37
0:02:02.172,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And when I look at this building and then think about hospitals today,

38
0:02:05.515,000 --> 0:02:08,000
what amazes me is this building's ambition.

39
0:02:08.603,000 --> 0:02:09,000
It's just a really great building.

40
0:02:10.252,000 --> 0:02:11,000
It has these courtyards in the middle

41
0:02:12.086,000 --> 0:02:14,000
so that all of the rooms have daylight and fresh air,

42
0:02:14.619,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and the rooms are big and they have high ceilings,

43
0:02:17.032,000 --> 0:02:19,000
so they just feel more comfortable to be in.

44
0:02:19.516,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And it's also beautiful.

45
0:02:21.281,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Somehow, we've forgotten that that's even possible for a hospital.

46
0:02:25.112,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Now, if we want better buildings for dying, then we have to talk about it,

47
0:02:29.135,000 --> 0:02:31,000
but because we find the subject of death uncomfortable,

48
0:02:31.706,000 --> 0:02:32,000
we don't talk about it,

49
0:02:33.146,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and we don't question how we as a society approach death.

50
0:02:36.458,000 --> 0:02:39,000
One of the things that surprised me most in my research, though,

51
0:02:39.632,000 --> 0:02:41,000
is how changeable attitudes actually are.

52
0:02:42.317,000 --> 0:02:44,000
This is the first crematorium in the U.K.,

53
0:02:44.709,000 --> 0:02:46,000
which was built in Woking in the 1870s.

54
0:02:47.518,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And when this was first built, there were protests in the local village.

55
0:02:50.925,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Cremation wasn't socially acceptable, and 99.8 percent of people got buried.

56
0:02:55.808,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And yet, only a hundred years later, three quarters of us get cremated.

57
0:02:59.584,000 --> 0:03:01,000
People are actually really open to changing things

58
0:03:02.111,000 --> 0:03:04,000
if they're given the chance to talk about them.

59
0:03:04.512,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So this conversation about death and architecture

60
0:03:07.835,000 --> 0:03:1,000
was what I wanted to start when I did my first exhibition on it

61
0:03:10.994,000 --> 0:03:13,000
in Venice in June, which was called "Death in Venice."

62
0:03:14.22,000 --> 0:03:17,000
It was designed to be quite playful

63
0:03:17.494,000 --> 0:03:19,000
so that people would literally engage with it.

64
0:03:19.692,000 --> 0:03:22,000
This is one of our exhibits, which is an interactive map of London

65
0:03:22.947,000 --> 0:03:24,000
that shows just how much of the real estate in the city

66
0:03:25.622,000 --> 0:03:26,000
is given over to death and dying,

67
0:03:27.501,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and as you wave your hand across the map,

68
0:03:29.87,000 --> 0:03:33,000
the name of that piece of real estate, the building or cemetery, is revealed.

69
0:03:34.699,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Another of our exhibits was a series of postcards

70
0:03:37.207,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that people could take away with them.

71
0:03:39.204,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And they showed people's homes and hospitals

72
0:03:41.665,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and cemeteries and mortuaries,

73
0:03:44.08,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and they tell the story of the different spaces

74
0:03:46.541,000 --> 0:03:48,000
that we pass through on either side of death.

75
0:03:49.374,000 --> 0:03:51,000
We wanted to show that where we die

76
0:03:51.719,000 --> 0:03:54,000
is a key part of how we die.

77
0:03:54.97,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Now, the strangest thing was the way that visitors reacted to the exhibition,

78
0:03:59.753,000 --> 0:04:01,000
especially the audio-visual works.

79
0:04:02.121,000 --> 0:04:05,000
We had people dancing and running and jumping

80
0:04:05.813,000 --> 0:04:07,000
as they tried to activate the exhibits in different ways,

81
0:04:08.808,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and at a certain point they would kind of stop

82
0:04:11.252,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and remember that they were in an exhibition about death,

83
0:04:13.986,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and that maybe that's not how you're supposed to act.

84
0:04:16.61,000 --> 0:04:18,000
But actually, I would question whether there is one way

85
0:04:19.257,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that you're supposed to act around death,

86
0:04:21.532,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and if there's not, I'd ask you to think about what you think a good death is,

87
0:04:26.083,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and what you think that architecture that supports a good death might be like,

88
0:04:29.752,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and mightn't it be a little less like this and a little more like this?

89
0:04:34.48,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Thank you.

90
0:04:36.694,000 --> 0:04:38,000
(Applause)

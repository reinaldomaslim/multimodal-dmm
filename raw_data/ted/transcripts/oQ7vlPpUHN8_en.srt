1
0:00:13.568,000 --> 0:00:16,000
(Cello music)

2
0:01:03.012,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Music ends)

3
0:01:09.373,000 --> 0:01:11,000
On the flight here,

4
0:01:13.071,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I was reminded about my mom.

5
0:01:15.437,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I'm a self-taught cellist, I've never had a lesson.

6
0:01:18.093,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I studied double bass, but I just picked up the cello and started playing

7
0:01:21.693,000 --> 0:01:22,000
because I love doing it.

8
0:01:22.907,000 --> 0:01:23,000
But my mom was an inspiration to me.

9
0:01:24.717,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I did not realize she was an inspiration,

10
0:01:26.805,000 --> 0:01:3,000
because she got her music degree through a mail-order course,

11
0:01:30.958,000 --> 0:01:31,000
the US School of Music.

12
0:01:32.45,000 --> 0:01:33,000
While raising two kids,

13
0:01:34.863,000 --> 0:01:37,000
she received a lesson a week in the mail,

14
0:01:37.99,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and practiced.

15
0:01:39.165,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And at the end of a couple of years, she put on a recital.

16
0:01:42.751,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And I'll be 50 this month, and it took me that long to realize

17
0:01:46.799,000 --> 0:01:47,000
that she was that big of an inspiration.

18
0:01:49.357,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I'm just going to keep -- yeah, thanks, mom.

19
0:01:52.06,000 --> 0:01:58,000
(Applause)

20
0:01:58.532,000 --> 0:02:,000
She's also one of the most extraordinary people I know,

21
0:02:01.217,000 --> 0:02:03,000
beyond being a wonderful musician.

22
0:02:03.913,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I want to play a little bit for mom and your moms as well, actually.

23
0:02:07.968,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Cello music)

24
0:02:22.066,000 --> 0:02:24,000
(Music ends)

25
0:02:24.307,000 --> 0:02:26,000
You know, when you normally hear a cello, you think of this.

26
0:02:27.221,000 --> 0:02:29,000
(Plays Bach Cello Suite No.1)

27
0:02:29.77,000 --> 0:02:31,000
We're not going to do that today.

28
0:02:31.996,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Laughter and applause)

29
0:02:35.328,000 --> 0:02:37,000
(Drums)

30
0:02:41.684,000 --> 0:02:43,000
(Cello)

31
0:02:46.489,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Hey!

32
0:02:48.076,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Looped samples of onstage sounds)

33
0:03:05.282,000 --> 0:03:06,000
(Cello music and looped samples)

34
0:03:54.911,000 --> 0:03:56,000
(Music ends)

35
0:03:57.805,000 --> 0:04:03,000
(Applause and cheers)

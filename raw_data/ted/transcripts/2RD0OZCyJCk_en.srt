1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm going to talk about a very fundamental change that is going on

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
in the very fabric of the modern economy.

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And to talk about that, I'm going to go back to the beginning,

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
because in the beginning were commodities.

5
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Commodities are things that you grow in the ground, raise on the ground or pull out of the ground:

6
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
basically, animal, mineral, vegetable.

7
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And then you extract them out of the ground,

8
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and sell them on the open marketplace.

9
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Commodities were the basis of the agrarian economy

10
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that lasted for millennia.

11
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
But then along came the industrial revolution,

12
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and then goods became the predominant economic offering,

13
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
where we used commodities as a raw material

14
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
to be able to make or manufacture goods.

15
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So, we moved from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy.

16
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Well, what then happened over the last 50 or 60 years,

17
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
is that goods have become commoditized.

18
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Commoditized: where they're treated like a commodity,

19
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
where people don't care who makes them.

20
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
They just care about three things and three things only:

21
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
price, price and price.

22
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Now, there's an antidote to commoditization,

23
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and that is customization.

24
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
My first book was called "Mass Customization" --

25
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
it came up a couple of times yesterday --

26
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and how I discovered this progression of economic value

27
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
was realizing that customizing a good

28
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
automatically turned it into a service,

29
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
because it was done just for a particular person,

30
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
because it wasn't inventoried,

31
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
it was delivered on demand to that individual person.

32
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So, we moved from an industrial economy to a service-based economy.

33
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
But over the past 10 or 20 years, what's happened is that

34
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
services are being commoditized as well.

35
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Long-distance telephone service sold on price, price, price;

36
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
fast-food restaurants with all their value pricing;

37
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and even the Internet is commoditizing not just goods,

38
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
but services as well.

39
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
What that means is that it's time

40
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
to move to a new level of economic value.

41
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Time to go beyond the goods and the services,

42
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and use, in that same heuristic, what happens when you customize a service?

43
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
What happens when you design a service that is so appropriate for a particular person --

44
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
that's exactly what they need at this moment in time?

45
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Then you can't help but make them go "wow";

46
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
you can't help but turn it into a memorable event --

47
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
you can't help but turn it into an experience.

48
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So we're shifting to an experience economy,

49
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
where experiences are becoming the predominant economic offering.

50
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Now most places that I talk to,

51
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
when I talk about experience, I talk about Disney --

52
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
the world's premier experience-stager.

53
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I talk about theme restaurants, and experiential retail,

54
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and boutique hotels, and Las Vegas --

55
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
the experience capital of the world.

56
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
But here, when you think about experiences,

57
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
think about Thomas Dolby and his group, playing music.

58
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Think about meaningful places.

59
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Think about drinking wine,

60
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
about a journey to the Clock of the Long Now.

61
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Those are all experiences. Think about TED itself.

62
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
The experience capital in the world of conferences.

63
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
All of these are experiences.

64
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Now, over the last several years I spent a lot of time in Europe,

65
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and particularly in the Netherlands,

66
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and whenever I talk about the experience economy there,

67
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I'm always greeted at the end with one particular question,

68
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
almost invariably.

69
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And the question isn't really so much a question

70
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
as an accusation.

71
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And the Dutch, when they usually put it,

72
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
it always starts with the same two words.

73
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
You know the words I mean?

74
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
You Americans.

75
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
They say, you Americans.

76
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
You like your fantasy environments,

77
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
your fake, your Disneyland experiences.

78
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
They say, we Dutch, we like real,

79
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
natural, authentic experiences.

80
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So much has that happened that I've developed a fairly praticed response,

81
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
which is: I point out that first of all,

82
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
you have to understand that there is no such thing

83
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
as an inauthentic experience.

84
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Why? Because the experience happens inside of us.

85
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
It's our reaction to the events that are staged in front of us.

86
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So, as long as we are in any sense authentic human beings,

87
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
then every experience we have is authentic.

88
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Now, there may be more or less natural or artificial

89
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
stimuli for the experience,

90
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
but even that is a matter of degree, not kind.

91
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And there's no such thing as a 100 percent natural experience.

92
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Even if you go for a walk in the proverbial woods,

93
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
there is a company that manufactured the car

94
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that delivered you to the edge of the woods;

95
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
there's a company that manufactured the shoes that you have

96
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
to protect yourself from the ground of the woods.

97
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
There's a company that provides a cell phone service you have

98
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
in case you get lost in the woods.

99
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Right? All of those are man-made,

100
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
artificiality brought into the woods by you,

101
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and by the very nature of being there.

102
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And then I always finish off

103
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
by talking about -- the thing that amazes me the most about this question,

104
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
particularly coming from the Dutch,

105
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
is that the Netherlands

106
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
is every bit as manufactured as Disneyland.

107
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
(Laughter)

108
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And the Dutch, they always go ...

109
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and they realize, I'm right!

110
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
There isn't a square meter of ground in the entire country

111
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that hasn't been reclaimed from the sea,

112
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
or otherwise moved, modified and manicured

113
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
to look as if it had always been there.

114
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
It's the only place you ever go for a walk in the woods and all the trees are lined up in rows.

115
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
(Laughter)

116
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
But nonetheless, not just the Dutch,

117
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
but everyone has this desire for the authentic.

118
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And authenticity is therefore

119
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
becoming the new consumer sensibility --

120
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
the buying criteria by which consumers

121
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
are choosing who are they going to buy from,

122
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and what they're going to buy.

123
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Becoming the basis of the economy.

124
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
In fact, you can look at how each of these economies developed,

125
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that each one has their own business imperative,

126
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
matched with a consumer sensibility.

127
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
We're the agrarian economy, and we're supplying commodities.

128
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
It's about supply and availability.

129
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Getting the commodities to market.

130
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
With the industrial economy, it is about controlling costs --

131
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
getting the costs down as low as possible

132
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
so we can offer them to the masses.

133
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
With the service economy, it is about

134
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
improving quality.

135
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
That has -- the whole quality movement has risen

136
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
with the service economy over the past 20 or 30 years.

137
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
And now, with the experience economy,

138
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
it's about rendering authenticity.

139
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Rendering authenticity -- and the keyword is "rendering."

140
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Right? Rendering, because you have to get your consumers --

141
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
as business people --

142
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
to percieve your offerings as authentic.

143
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Because there is a basic paradox:

144
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
no one can have an inauthentic experience,

145
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
but no business can supply one.

146
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Because all businesses are man-made objects; all business is involved with money;

147
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
all business is a matter of using machinery,

148
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and all those things make something inauthentic.

149
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So, how do you render authenticity,

150
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
is the question.

151
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Are you rendering authenticity?

152
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
When you think about that, let me go back to

153
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
what Lionel Trilling, in his seminal book on authenticity,

154
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
"Sincerity and Authenticity" -- came out in 1960 --

155
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
points to as the seminal point

156
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
at which authenticity entered the lexicon,

157
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
if you will.

158
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And that is, to no surprise, in Shakespeare,

159
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and in his play, Hamlet.

160
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And there is one part in this play, Hamlet,

161
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
where the most fake of all the characters in Hamlet, Polonius,

162
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
says something profoundly real.

163
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
At the end of a laundry list of advice

164
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
he's giving to his son, Laertes,

165
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
he says this:

166
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And this above all: to thine own self be true.

167
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And it doth follow, as night the day,

168
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that thou canst not then be false to any man.

169
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And those three verses are the core of authenticity.

170
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
There are two dimensions to authenticity:

171
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
one, being true to yourself, which is very self-directed.

172
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Two, is other-directed:

173
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
being what you say you are to others.

174
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And I don't know about you, but whenever I encounter two dimensions,

175
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I immediately go, ahh, two-by-two!

176
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
All right? Anybody else like that, no?

177
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Well, if you think about that, you do, in fact, get

178
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
a two-by-two.

179
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Where, on one dimension it's a matter of being true to yourself.

180
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
As businesses, are the economic offerings you are providing --

181
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
are they true to themselves?

182
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And the other dimension is:

183
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
are they what they say they are to others?

184
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
If not, you have,

185
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
"is not true to itself," and "is not what it says it is,"

186
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
yielding a two-by-two matrix.

187
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And of course, if you are both true to yourself,

188
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and are what you say you are, then you're real real!

189
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
(Laughter)

190
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
The opposite, of course, is -- fake fake.

191
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
All right, now, there is value for fake.

192
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
There will always be companies around to supply the fake,

193
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
because there will always be desire for the fake.

194
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Fact is, there's a general rule: if you don't like it, it's fake;

195
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
if you do like it, it's faux.

196
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
(Laughter)

197
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Now, the other two sides of the coin are:

198
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
being a real fake --

199
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
is what it says it is,

200
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
but is not true to itself,

201
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
or being a fake real:

202
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
is true to itself, but not what it says it is.

203
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
You can think about those two -- you know, both of these

204
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
better than being fake fake -- not quite as good as being real real.

205
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
You can contrast them by thinking about

206
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Universal City Walk versus

207
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Disney World, or Disneyland.

208
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Universal City Walk is a real fake --

209
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
in fact, we got this very term

210
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
from Ada Louise Huxtable's book, "The Unreal America."

211
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
A wonderful book, where she talks about Universal City Walk as --

212
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
you know, she decries the fake, but she says, at least that's a real fake,

213
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
right, because you can see behind the facade, right?

214
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
It is what it says it is: It's Universal Studio;

215
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
it's in the city of Los Angeles; you're going to walk a lot.

216
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Right? You don't tend to walk a lot in Los Angeles,

217
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
well, here's a place where you are going to walk a lot,

218
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
outside in this city.

219
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
But is it really true to itself?

220
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Right? Is it really in the city?

221
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Is it --

222
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
you can see behind all of it,

223
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and see what is going on in the facades of it.

224
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
So she calls it a real fake.

225
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Disney World, on the other hand, is a fake real,

226
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
or a fake reality.

227
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Right? It's not what it says it is. It's not really the magic kingdom.

228
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
(Laughter)

229
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
But it is -- oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to --

230
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
(Laughter)

231
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
-- sorry.

232
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
We won't talk about Santa Claus then.

233
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
(Laughter)

234
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
But Disney World is wonderfully true to itself.

235
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Right? Just wonderfully true to itself.

236
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
When you are there you are just immersed

237
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
in this wonderful environment.

238
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
So, it's a fake real.

239
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Now the easiest way

240
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
to fall down in this,

241
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and not be real real,

242
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
right, the easiest way not to be true to yourself

243
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
is not to understand your heritage,

244
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and thereby repudiate that heritage.

245
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Right, the key of being true to yourself is knowing who you are as a business.

246
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Knowing where your heritage is: what you have done in the past.

247
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And what you have done in the past limits what you can do,

248
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
what you can get away with, essentially, in the future.

249
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
So, you have to understand that past.

250
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Think about Disney again.

251
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Disney,

252
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
10 or 15 years ago, right,

253
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
the Disney -- the company that is probably

254
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
best-known for family values out there,

255
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Disney bought the ABC network.

256
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
The ABC network, affectionately known in the trade

257
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
as the T&A network, right --

258
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
that's not too much jargon, is it?

259
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Right, the T&A network. Then it bought Miramax,

260
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
known for its NC-17 fare,

261
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and all of a sudden, families everywhere

262
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
couldn't really trust what they were getting from Disney.

263
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
It was no longer true to its heritage;

264
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
no longer true to Walt Disney.

265
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
That's one of the reasons why they're having such trouble today,

266
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and why Roy Disney is out to get Michael Eisner.

267
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Because it is no longer true to itself.

268
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
So, understand what -- your past limits what you can do in the future.

269
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
When it comes to being what you say you are, the easiest mistake that companies make

270
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
is that they advertise

271
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
things that they are not.

272
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
That's when you're perceived as fake, as a phony company --

273
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
advertizing things that you're not.

274
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Think about any hotel, any airline,

275
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
any hospital.

276
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Right, if you could check into the ads, you'd have a great experience.

277
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
(Laughter)

278
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
But unfortunately, you have to experience the actual hotel,

279
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
airline and hospital, and then you have that disconnect.

280
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Then you have that perception that you are phony.

281
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
So, the number one thing to do when it comes to being what you say you are,

282
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
is to provide places for people to experience

283
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
who you are.

284
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
For people to experience who you are.

285
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Right, it's not advertising does it.

286
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
That's why you have companies like Starbucks,

287
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
right, that doesn't advertise at all.

288
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
They said, you want to know who we are, you have to come experience us.

289
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And think about the economic value they have provided

290
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
by that experience.

291
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Right? Coffee, at its core, is what?

292
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Right? It's beans; right? It's coffee beans.

293
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
You know how much coffee is worth, when treated as a commodity as a bean?

294
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Two or three cents per cup -- that's what coffee is worth.

295
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
But grind it, roast it, package it, put it on a grocery store shelf,

296
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and now it'll cost five, 10, 15 cents,

297
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
when you treat it as a good.

298
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Take that same good,

299
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and perform the service of actually brewing it for a customer,

300
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
in a corner diner, in a bodega, a kiosk somewhere,

301
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
you get 50 cents, maybe a buck

302
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:1,000
per cup of coffee.

303
0:13:10.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
But surround the brewing of that coffee

304
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
with the ambiance of a Starbucks,

305
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
with the authentic cedar that goes inside of there,

306
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and now, because of that authentic experience,

307
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
you can charge two, three, four, five dollars

308
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
for a cup of coffee.

309
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
So, authenticity is becoming

310
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
the new consumer sensibility.

311
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Let me summarize it, for the business people in the audience,

312
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
with three rules, three basic rules.

313
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
One, don't say you're authentic

314
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
unless you really are authentic.

315
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Two, it's easier to be authentic

316
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
if you don't say you're authentic.

317
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And three, if you say you're authentic,

318
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
you better be authentic.

319
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And then for the consumers, for everyone else in the audience,

320
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
let me simply summarize it by saying, increasingly,

321
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
what we -- what will make us happy,

322
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
is spending our time and our money

323
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
satisfying the desire for authenticity.

324
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Thank you.

1
0:00:12.587,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Humanity takes center stage at TED,

2
0:00:15.65,000 --> 0:00:18,000
but I would like to add a voice for the animals,

3
0:00:19.313,000 --> 0:00:24,000
whose bodies and minds and spirits shaped us.

4
0:00:25.112,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Some years ago, it was my good fortune

5
0:00:28.358,000 --> 0:00:29,000
to meet a tribal elder on an island

6
0:00:30.306,000 --> 0:00:32,000
not far from Vancouver.

7
0:00:32.86,000 --> 0:00:34,000
His name is Jimmy Smith,

8
0:00:35.238,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and he shared a story with me

9
0:00:37.487,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that is told among his people,

10
0:00:39.84,000 --> 0:00:42,000
who call themselves the Kwikwasut'inuxw.

11
0:00:43.035,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Once upon a time, he told me,

12
0:00:45.73,000 --> 0:00:47,000
all animals on Earth were one.

13
0:00:48.587,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Even though they look different on the outside,

14
0:00:51.511,000 --> 0:00:54,000
inside, they're all the same,

15
0:00:54.751,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and from time to time they would gather

16
0:00:57.406,000 --> 0:00:59,000
at a sacred cave deep inside the forest

17
0:01:00.156,000 --> 0:01:02,000
to celebrate their unity.

18
0:01:02.648,000 --> 0:01:03,000
When they arrived,

19
0:01:04.392,000 --> 0:01:06,000
they would all take off their skins.

20
0:01:06.92,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Raven shed his feathers, bear his fur,

21
0:01:10.444,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and salmon her scales,

22
0:01:12.907,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and then, they would dance.

23
0:01:15.829,000 --> 0:01:18,000
But one day, a human made it to the cave

24
0:01:19.13,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and laughed at what he saw

25
0:01:20.714,000 --> 0:01:23,000
because he did not understand.

26
0:01:23.838,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Embarrassed, the animals fled,

27
0:01:26.707,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and that was the last time

28
0:01:28.934,000 --> 0:01:31,000
they revealed themselves this way.

29
0:01:32.556,000 --> 0:01:34,000
The ancient understanding that underneath

30
0:01:35.24,000 --> 0:01:37,000
their separate identities, all animals are one,

31
0:01:38.143,000 --> 0:01:41,000
has been a powerful inspiration to me.

32
0:01:41.881,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I like to get past the fur, the feathers

33
0:01:44.944,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and the scales.

34
0:01:46.573,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I want to get under the skin.

35
0:01:48.801,000 --> 0:01:5,000
No matter whether I'm facing a giant elephant

36
0:01:51.601,000 --> 0:01:53,000
or a tiny tree frog,

37
0:01:53.749,000 --> 0:01:59,000
my goal is to connect us with them, eye to eye.

38
0:02:00.641,000 --> 0:02:03,000
You may wonder, do I ever photograph people?

39
0:02:03.78,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Sure. People are always present in my photos,

40
0:02:07.615,000 --> 0:02:09,000
no matter whether they appear

41
0:02:09.742,000 --> 0:02:11,000
to portray tortoises

42
0:02:12.561,000 --> 0:02:13,000
or cougars

43
0:02:14.374,000 --> 0:02:15,000
or lions.

44
0:02:16.253,000 --> 0:02:2,000
You just have to learn how to look past their disguise.

45
0:02:20.751,000 --> 0:02:21,000
As a photographer,

46
0:02:22.485,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I try to reach beyond the differences

47
0:02:25.3,000 --> 0:02:26,000
in our genetic makeup

48
0:02:27.264,000 --> 0:02:3,000
to appreciate all we have in common

49
0:02:30.861,000 --> 0:02:33,000
with every other living thing.

50
0:02:34.239,000 --> 0:02:36,000
When I use my camera,

51
0:02:36.568,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I drop my skin

52
0:02:38.491,000 --> 0:02:4,000
like the animals at that cave

53
0:02:41.191,000 --> 0:02:44,000
so I can show who they really are.

54
0:02:45.128,000 --> 0:02:47,000
As animals blessed

55
0:02:47.378,000 --> 0:02:5,000
with the power of rational thought,

56
0:02:50.752,000 --> 0:02:54,000
we can marvel at the intricacies of life.

57
0:02:55.285,000 --> 0:02:57,000
As citizens of a planet in trouble,

58
0:02:58.121,000 --> 0:03:,000
it is our moral responsibility

59
0:03:00.685,000 --> 0:03:05,000
to deal with the dramatic loss in diversity of life.

60
0:03:06.24,000 --> 0:03:07,000
But as humans with hearts,

61
0:03:08.107,000 --> 0:03:11,000
we can all rejoice in the unity of life,

62
0:03:12.04,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and perhaps we can change

63
0:03:14.88,000 --> 0:03:17,000
what once happened in that sacred cave.

64
0:03:18.76,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Let's find a way to join the dance.

65
0:03:23.992,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Thank you.

66
0:03:26.775,000 --> 0:03:28,000
(Applause)

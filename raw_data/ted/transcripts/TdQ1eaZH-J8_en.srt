1
0:00:12.36,000 --> 0:00:14,000
What does a working mother look like?

2
0:00:15.24,000 --> 0:00:18,000
If you ask the Internet, this is what you'll be told.

3
0:00:18.52,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Never mind that this is what you'll actually produce

4
0:00:22.97,000 --> 0:00:24,000
if you attempt to work at a computer with a baby on your lap.

5
0:00:25.88,000 --> 0:00:26,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:27.44,000 --> 0:00:29,000
But no, this isn't a working mother.

7
0:00:30.36,000 --> 0:00:33,000
You'll notice a theme in these photos. We'll look at a lot of them.

8
0:00:33.56,000 --> 0:00:35,000
That theme is amazing natural lighting,

9
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:39,000
which, as we all know,

10
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
is the hallmark of every American workplace.

11
0:00:43.36,000 --> 0:00:46,000
There are thousands of images like these.

12
0:00:46.84,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Just put the term "working mother" into any Google image search engine,

13
0:00:50.28,000 --> 0:00:51,000
stock photo site.

14
0:00:51.56,000 --> 0:00:52,000
They're all over the Internet,

15
0:00:53.04,000 --> 0:00:55,000
they're topping blog posts and news pieces,

16
0:00:55.44,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and I've become kind of obsessed with them and the lie that they tell us

17
0:00:59.8,000 --> 0:01:,000
and the comfort that they give us,

18
0:01:01.8,000 --> 0:01:04,000
that when it comes to new working motherhood in America,

19
0:01:05.24,000 --> 0:01:06,000
everything's fine.

20
0:01:07.04,000 --> 0:01:08,000
But it's not fine.

21
0:01:08.64,000 --> 0:01:11,000
As a country, we are sending millions of women back to work

22
0:01:12.08,000 --> 0:01:15,000
every year, incredibly and kind of horrifically soon

23
0:01:16.04,000 --> 0:01:17,000
after they give birth.

24
0:01:17.72,000 --> 0:01:18,000
That's a moral problem

25
0:01:19.44,000 --> 0:01:22,000
but today I'm also going to tell you why it's an economic problem.

26
0:01:23.36,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I got so annoyed and obsessed with the unreality of these images,

27
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:29,000
which look nothing like my life,

28
0:01:29.04,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that I recently decided to shoot and star in a parody series of stock photos

29
0:01:34.24,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that I hoped the world would start to use

30
0:01:36.4,000 --> 0:01:4,000
just showing the really awkward reality of going back to work

31
0:01:40.68,000 --> 0:01:43,000
when your baby's food source is attached to your body.

32
0:01:45.32,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I'm just going to show you two of them.

33
0:01:47.72,000 --> 0:01:49,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:49.8,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Nothing says "Give that girl a promotion" like leaking breast milk

35
0:01:52.92,000 --> 0:01:54,000
through your dress during a presentation.

36
0:01:55.08,000 --> 0:01:57,000
You'll notice that there's no baby in this photo,

37
0:01:57.52,000 --> 0:01:59,000
because that's not how this works,

38
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
not for most working mothers.

39
0:02:02.52,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Did you know, and this will ruin your day,

40
0:02:04.6,000 --> 0:02:07,000
that every time a toilet is flushed, its contents are aerosolized

41
0:02:07.8,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and they'll stay airborne for hours?

42
0:02:10.24,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And yet, for many new working mothers,

43
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:16,000
this is the only place during the day that they can find to make food

44
0:02:16.28,000 --> 0:02:17,000
for their newborn babies.

45
0:02:18.88,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I put these things, a whole dozen of them, into the world.

46
0:02:22.36,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I wanted to make a point.

47
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I didn't know what I was also doing was opening a door,

48
0:02:27.44,000 --> 0:02:3,000
because now, total strangers from all walks of life

49
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:32,000
write to me all the time

50
0:02:32.96,000 --> 0:02:35,000
just to tell me what it's like for them to go back to work

51
0:02:36.84,000 --> 0:02:39,000
within days or weeks of having a baby.

52
0:02:39.88,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I'm going to share 10 of their stories with you today.

53
0:02:42.48,000 --> 0:02:45,000
They are totally real, some of them are very raw,

54
0:02:45.88,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and not one of them looks anything like this.

55
0:02:50.36,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Here's the first.

56
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
"I was an active duty service member at a federal prison.

57
0:02:55.88,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I returned to work after the maximum allowed eight weeks for my C-section.

58
0:03:00.28,000 --> 0:03:04,000
A male coworker was annoyed that I had been out on 'vacation,'

59
0:03:04.36,000 --> 0:03:07,000
so he intentionally opened the door on me while I was pumping breast milk

60
0:03:07.813,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and stood in the doorway with inmates in the hallway."

61
0:03:11.88,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Most of the stories that these women, total strangers, send to me now,

62
0:03:15.2,000 --> 0:03:17,000
are not actually even about breastfeeding.

63
0:03:17.48,000 --> 0:03:18,000
A woman wrote to me to say,

64
0:03:19.4,000 --> 0:03:23,000
"I gave birth to twins and went back to work after seven unpaid weeks.

65
0:03:24.2,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Emotionally, I was a wreck.

66
0:03:25.88,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Physically, I had a severe hemorrhage during labor, and major tearing,

67
0:03:30.24,000 --> 0:03:32,000
so I could barely get up, sit or walk.

68
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
My employer told me I wasn't allowed to use my available vacation days

69
0:03:36.88,000 --> 0:03:37,000
because it was budget season."

70
0:03:39.8,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I've come to believe that we can't look situations like these in the eye

71
0:03:44.44,000 --> 0:03:45,000
because then we'd be horrified,

72
0:03:46.28,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and if we get horrified then we have to do something about it.

73
0:03:49.36,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So we choose to look at, and believe, this image.

74
0:03:53.24,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I don't really know what's going on in this picture,

75
0:03:55.72,000 --> 0:03:57,000
because I find it weird and slightly creepy.

76
0:03:58.4,000 --> 0:03:59,000
(Laughter)

77
0:03:59.84,000 --> 0:04:,000
Like, what is she doing?

78
0:04:01.08,000 --> 0:04:05,000
But I know what it tells us.

79
0:04:05.12,000 --> 0:04:07,000
It tells us that everything's fine.

80
0:04:07.68,000 --> 0:04:1,000
This working mother, all working mothers and all of their babies, are fine.

81
0:04:11.44,000 --> 0:04:12,000
There's nothing to see here.

82
0:04:13.44,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And anyway, women have made a choice,

83
0:04:16.88,000 --> 0:04:18,000
so none of it's even our problem.

84
0:04:19.2,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I want to break this choice thing down into two parts.

85
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
The first choice says that women have chosen to work.

86
0:04:25.8,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So, that's not true.

87
0:04:28.04,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Today in America, women make up 47 percent of the workforce,

88
0:04:33.279,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and in 40 percent of American households

89
0:04:35.28,000 --> 0:04:38,000
a woman is the sole or primary breadwinner.

90
0:04:38.84,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Our paid work is a part, a huge part, of the engine of this economy,

91
0:04:43.4,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and it is essential for the engines of our families.

92
0:04:46.2,000 --> 0:04:5,000
On a national level, our paid work is not optional.

93
0:04:50.4,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Choice number two says that women are choosing to have babies,

94
0:04:53.36,000 --> 0:04:56,000
so women alone should bear the consequences of those choices.

95
0:04:58.2,000 --> 0:04:59,000
You know, that's one of those things

96
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:02,000
that when you hear it in passing, can sound correct.

97
0:05:02.48,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I didn't make you have a baby.

98
0:05:03.933,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I certainly wasn't there when that happened.

99
0:05:06.04,000 --> 0:05:12,000
But that stance ignores a fundamental truth,

100
0:05:12.08,000 --> 0:05:16,000
which is that our procreation on a national scale is not optional.

101
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:21,000
The babies that women, many of them working women, are having today,

102
0:05:21.52,000 --> 0:05:24,000
will one day fill our workforce, protect our shores,

103
0:05:24.76,000 --> 0:05:25,000
make up our tax base.

104
0:05:26.6,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Our procreation on a national scale is not optional.

105
0:05:30.8,000 --> 0:05:31,000
These aren't choices.

106
0:05:32.2,000 --> 0:05:35,000
We need women to work. We need working women to have babies.

107
0:05:36.04,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So we should make doing those things at the same time

108
0:05:38.541,000 --> 0:05:39,000
at least palatable, right?

109
0:05:40.96,000 --> 0:05:42,000
OK, this is pop quiz time:

110
0:05:43.68,000 --> 0:05:45,000
what percentage of working women in America do you think

111
0:05:46.64,000 --> 0:05:49,000
have no access to paid maternity leave?

112
0:05:51.44,000 --> 0:05:52,000
88 percent.

113
0:05:53.873,000 --> 0:05:56,000
88 percent of working mothers will not get one minute of paid leave

114
0:05:57.04,000 --> 0:05:58,000
after they have a baby.

115
0:05:58.68,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So now you're thinking about unpaid leave.

116
0:06:02.32,000 --> 0:06:05,000
It exists in America. It's called FMLA. It does not work.

117
0:06:05.92,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Because of the way it's structured, all kinds of exceptions,

118
0:06:08.92,000 --> 0:06:12,000
half of new mothers are ineligible for it.

119
0:06:12.96,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Here's what that looks like.

120
0:06:16.32,000 --> 0:06:17,000
"We adopted our son.

121
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
When I got the call, the day he was born, I had to take off work.

122
0:06:22.4,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I had not been there long enough to qualify for FMLA,

123
0:06:25.56,000 --> 0:06:27,000
so I wasn't eligible for unpaid leave.

124
0:06:28.32,000 --> 0:06:3,000
When I took time off to meet my newborn son,

125
0:06:30.76,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I lost my job."

126
0:06:33.84,000 --> 0:06:37,000
These corporate stock photos hide another reality, another layer.

127
0:06:38.76,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Of those who do have access to just that unpaid leave,

128
0:06:42.4,000 --> 0:06:45,000
most women can't afford to take much of it at all.

129
0:06:45.6,000 --> 0:06:48,000
A nurse told me, "I didn't qualify for short-term disability

130
0:06:49.12,000 --> 0:06:53,000
because my pregnancy was considered a preexisting condition.

131
0:06:53.2,000 --> 0:06:55,000
We used up all of our tax returns and half of our savings

132
0:06:55.891,000 --> 0:06:56,000
during my six unpaid weeks.

133
0:06:57.76,000 --> 0:06:58,000
We just couldn't manage any longer.

134
0:06:59.52,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Physically it was hard, but emotionally it was worse.

135
0:07:02.08,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I struggled for months being away from my son."

136
0:07:05.08,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So this decision to go back to work so early,

137
0:07:08,000 --> 0:07:12,000
it's a rational economic decision driven by family finances,

138
0:07:12.2,000 --> 0:07:14,000
but it's often physically horrific

139
0:07:14.48,000 --> 0:07:17,000
because putting a human into the world is messy.

140
0:07:18.04,000 --> 0:07:19,000
A waitress told me,

141
0:07:19.48,000 --> 0:07:22,000
"With my first baby, I was back at work five weeks postpartum.

142
0:07:23.04,000 --> 0:07:26,000
With my second, I had to have major surgery after giving birth,

143
0:07:26.12,000 --> 0:07:29,000
so I waited until six weeks to go back.

144
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
I had third degree tears."

145
0:07:32.88,000 --> 0:07:35,000
23 percent of new working mothers in America

146
0:07:35.96,000 --> 0:07:39,000
will be back on the job within two weeks of giving birth.

147
0:07:42.32,000 --> 0:07:46,000
"I worked as a bartender and cook, average of 75 hours a week while pregnant.

148
0:07:47,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I had to return to work before my baby was a month old,

149
0:07:49.64,000 --> 0:07:51,000
working 60 hours a week.

150
0:07:51.68,000 --> 0:07:56,000
One of my coworkers was only able to afford 10 days off with her baby."

151
0:07:56.76,000 --> 0:08:,000
Of course, this isn't just a scenario with economic and physical implications.

152
0:08:00.96,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Childbirth is, and always will be, an enormous psychological event.

153
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
A teacher told me,

154
0:08:08.28,000 --> 0:08:1,000
"I returned to work eight weeks after my son was born.

155
0:08:11.28,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I already suffer from anxiety,

156
0:08:13.2,000 --> 0:08:18,000
but the panic attacks I had prior to returning to work were unbearable."

157
0:08:18.32,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Statistically speaking,

158
0:08:20.44,000 --> 0:08:22,000
the shorter a woman's leave after having a baby,

159
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
the more likely she will be to suffer from postpartum mood disorders

160
0:08:26.4,000 --> 0:08:28,000
like depression and anxiety,

161
0:08:28.52,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and among many potential consequences of those disorders,

162
0:08:32.56,000 --> 0:08:35,000
suicide is the second most common cause of death

163
0:08:35.72,000 --> 0:08:36,000
in a woman's first year postpartum.

164
0:08:39.24,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Heads up that this next story --

165
0:08:40.84,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I've never met this woman, but I find it hard to get through.

166
0:08:45.44,000 --> 0:08:49,000
"I feel tremendous grief and rage that I lost an essential,

167
0:08:49.64,000 --> 0:08:52,000
irreplaceable and formative time with my son.

168
0:08:53.52,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Labor and delivery left me feeling absolutely broken.

169
0:08:56.96,000 --> 0:09:,000
For months, all I remember is the screaming: colic, they said.

170
0:09:01.64,000 --> 0:09:03,000
On the inside, I was drowning.

171
0:09:03.8,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Every morning, I asked myself how much longer I could do it.

172
0:09:07.52,000 --> 0:09:1,000
I was allowed to bring my baby to work.

173
0:09:10.72,000 --> 0:09:13,000
I closed my office door while I rocked and shushed

174
0:09:13.88,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and begged him to stop screaming so I wouldn't get in trouble.

175
0:09:17.4,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I hid behind that office door every damn day

176
0:09:19.48,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and cried while he screamed.

177
0:09:21.44,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I cried in the bathroom while I washed out the pump equipment.

178
0:09:25.12,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Every day, I cried all the way to work and all the way home again.

179
0:09:28.28,000 --> 0:09:31,000
I promised my boss that the work I didn't get done during the day,

180
0:09:31.44,000 --> 0:09:32,000
I'd make up at night from home.

181
0:09:33.12,000 --> 0:09:36,000
I thought, there's just something wrong with me that I can't swing this."

182
0:09:38.52,000 --> 0:09:4,000
So those are the mothers.

183
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
What of the babies?

184
0:09:42.96,000 --> 0:09:44,000
As a country, do we care about the millions of babies

185
0:09:45.48,000 --> 0:09:46,000
born every year to working mothers?

186
0:09:47.36,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I say we don't,

187
0:09:48.72,000 --> 0:09:51,000
not until they're of working and tax-paying and military-serving age.

188
0:09:52.2,000 --> 0:09:53,000
We tell them we'll see them in 18 years,

189
0:09:54.129,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and getting there is kind of on them.

190
0:09:57.854,000 --> 0:09:59,000
One of the reasons I know this is that babies whose mothers

191
0:10:00.64,000 --> 0:10:02,000
have 12 or more weeks at home with them

192
0:10:02.96,000 --> 0:10:05,000
are more likely to get their vaccinations and their well checks in their first year,

193
0:10:06.96,000 --> 0:10:1,000
so those babies are more protected from deadly and disabling diseases.

194
0:10:11.68,000 --> 0:10:14,000
But those things are hidden behind images like this.

195
0:10:18.28,000 --> 0:10:23,000
America has a message for new mothers who work and for their babies.

196
0:10:23.8,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Whatever time you get together, you should be grateful for it,

197
0:10:27.6,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and you're an inconvenience

198
0:10:30.36,000 --> 0:10:33,000
to the economy and to your employers.

199
0:10:33.4,000 --> 0:10:37,000
That narrative of gratitude runs through a lot of the stories I hear.

200
0:10:37.96,000 --> 0:10:38,000
A woman told me,

201
0:10:39.64,000 --> 0:10:41,000
"I went back at eight weeks after my C-section

202
0:10:41.84,000 --> 0:10:42,000
because my husband was out of work.

203
0:10:43.68,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Without me, my daughter had failure to thrive.

204
0:10:46.44,000 --> 0:10:47,000
She wouldn't take a bottle.

205
0:10:47.76,000 --> 0:10:48,000
She started losing weight.

206
0:10:49.4,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Thankfully, my manager was very understanding.

207
0:10:52.24,000 --> 0:10:53,000
He let my mom bring my baby,

208
0:10:53.8,000 --> 0:10:55,000
who was on oxygen and a monitor,

209
0:10:56.12,000 --> 0:10:58,000
four times a shift so I could nurse her."

210
0:10:59.96,000 --> 0:11:02,000
There's a little club of countries in the world

211
0:11:03.36,000 --> 0:11:06,000
that offer no national paid leave to new mothers.

212
0:11:07.24,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Care to guess who they are?

213
0:11:09.72,000 --> 0:11:12,000
The first eight make up eight million in total population.

214
0:11:13.68,000 --> 0:11:16,000
They are Papua New Guinea, Suriname and the tiny island nations

215
0:11:17.2,000 --> 0:11:23,000
of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau and Tonga.

216
0:11:23.44,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Number nine is the United States of America,

217
0:11:25.84,000 --> 0:11:27,000
with 320 million people.

218
0:11:29.32,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Oh, that's it.

219
0:11:31.68,000 --> 0:11:33,000
That's the end of the list.

220
0:11:34.28,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Every other economy on the planet

221
0:11:35.92,000 --> 0:11:38,000
has found a way to make some level of national paid leave work

222
0:11:39.84,000 --> 0:11:41,000
for the people doing the work of the future of those countries,

223
0:11:42.84,000 --> 0:11:46,000
but we say, "We couldn't possibly do that."

224
0:11:46.92,000 --> 0:11:48,000
We say that the market will solve this problem,

225
0:11:49.44,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and then we cheer when corporations offer even more paid leave to the women

226
0:11:53.8,000 --> 0:11:56,000
who are already the highest-educated and highest-paid among us.

227
0:11:57.08,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Remember that 88 percent?

228
0:11:58.92,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Those middle- and low-income women are not going to participate in that.

229
0:12:03.88,000 --> 0:12:08,000
We know that there are staggering economic, financial, physical

230
0:12:09.36,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and emotional costs to this approach.

231
0:12:11.92,000 --> 0:12:15,000
We have decided -- decided, not an accident,

232
0:12:15.96,000 --> 0:12:18,000
to pass these costs directly on to working mothers and their babies.

233
0:12:19.92,000 --> 0:12:21,000
We know the price tag is higher for low-income women,

234
0:12:22.6,000 --> 0:12:24,000
therefore disproportionately for women of color.

235
0:12:25.4,000 --> 0:12:27,000
We pass them on anyway.

236
0:12:27.88,000 --> 0:12:29,000
All of this is to America's shame.

237
0:12:30.52,000 --> 0:12:33,000
But it's also to America's risk.

238
0:12:34.44,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Because what would happen

239
0:12:36.36,000 --> 0:12:4,000
if all of these individual so-called choices to have babies

240
0:12:40.44,000 --> 0:12:44,000
started to turn into individual choices not to have babies.

241
0:12:45.32,000 --> 0:12:46,000
One woman told me,

242
0:12:47.04,000 --> 0:12:5,000
"New motherhood is hard. It shouldn't be traumatic.

243
0:12:50.32,000 --> 0:12:52,000
When we talk about expanding our family now,

244
0:12:52.6,000 --> 0:12:56,000
we focus on how much time I would have to care for myself and a new baby.

245
0:12:56.92,000 --> 0:12:59,000
If we were to have to do it again the same way as with our first,

246
0:13:00.24,000 --> 0:13:01,000
we might stick with one kid."

247
0:13:03.8,000 --> 0:13:05,000
The birthrate needed in America to keep the population stable

248
0:13:06.72,000 --> 0:13:08,000
is 2.1 live births per woman.

249
0:13:08.88,000 --> 0:13:11,000
In America today, we are at 1.86.

250
0:13:12.88,000 --> 0:13:14,000
We need women to have babies,

251
0:13:15.2,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and we are actively disincentivizing working women from doing that.

252
0:13:19.76,000 --> 0:13:22,000
What would happen to work force, to innovation, to GDP,

253
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:27,000
if one by one, the working mothers of this country were to decide

254
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
that they can't bear to do this thing more than once?

255
0:13:31.68,000 --> 0:13:34,000
I'm here today with only one idea worth spreading,

256
0:13:35.2,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and you've guessed what it is.

257
0:13:37.36,000 --> 0:13:4,000
It is long since time for the most powerful country on Earth

258
0:13:41.08,000 --> 0:13:43,000
to offer national paid leave

259
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
to the people doing the work of the future of this country

260
0:13:45.899,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and to the babies who represent that future.

261
0:13:48.8,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Childbirth is a public good.

262
0:13:50.96,000 --> 0:13:52,000
This leave should be state-subsidized.

263
0:13:53.52,000 --> 0:13:55,000
It should have no exceptions for small businesses,

264
0:13:56.04,000 --> 0:13:58,000
length of employment or entrepreneurs.

265
0:13:58.52,000 --> 0:14:,000
It should be able to be shared between partners.

266
0:14:00.92,000 --> 0:14:01,000
I've talked today a lot about mothers,

267
0:14:02.92,000 --> 0:14:04,000
but co-parents matter on so many levels.

268
0:14:07.52,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Not one more woman should have to go back to work

269
0:14:10.64,000 --> 0:14:13,000
while she is hobbling and bleeding.

270
0:14:13.84,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Not one more family should have to drain their savings account

271
0:14:17.52,000 --> 0:14:2,000
to buy a few days of rest and recovery and bonding.

272
0:14:21.2,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Not one more fragile infant

273
0:14:23.52,000 --> 0:14:25,000
should have to go directly from the incubator to day care

274
0:14:26.48,000 --> 0:14:28,000
because his parents have used up all of their meager time

275
0:14:29.2,000 --> 0:14:3,000
sitting in the NICU.

276
0:14:30.84,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Not one more working family should be told that the collision

277
0:14:33.722,000 --> 0:14:37,000
of their work, their needed work and their needed parenthood,

278
0:14:38.08,000 --> 0:14:39,000
is their problem alone.

279
0:14:40.76,000 --> 0:14:44,000
The catch is that when this is happening to a new family, it is consuming,

280
0:14:45.44,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and a family with a new baby is more financially vulnerable

281
0:14:48.24,000 --> 0:14:49,000
than they've ever been before,

282
0:14:49.72,000 --> 0:14:52,000
so that new mother cannot afford to speak up on her own behalf.

283
0:14:53.68,000 --> 0:14:55,000
But all of us have voices.

284
0:14:55.92,000 --> 0:14:58,000
I am done, done having babies,

285
0:14:59.52,000 --> 0:15:,000
and you might be pre-baby,

286
0:15:01.4,000 --> 0:15:02,000
you might be post-baby,

287
0:15:02.8,000 --> 0:15:03,000
you might be no baby.

288
0:15:04.44,000 --> 0:15:05,000
It should not matter.

289
0:15:06.32,000 --> 0:15:08,000
We have to stop framing this as a mother's issue,

290
0:15:08.76,000 --> 0:15:09,000
or even a women's issue.

291
0:15:10.48,000 --> 0:15:11,000
This is an American issue.

292
0:15:14.2,000 --> 0:15:17,000
We need to stop buying the lie that these images tell us.

293
0:15:17.72,000 --> 0:15:19,000
We need to stop being comforted by them.

294
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:22,000
We need to question why we're told that this can't work

295
0:15:22.68,000 --> 0:15:25,000
when we see it work everywhere all over the world.

296
0:15:26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
We need to recognize that this American reality

297
0:15:29.8,000 --> 0:15:32,000
is to our dishonor and to our peril.

298
0:15:33.44,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Because this is not,

299
0:15:35.64,000 --> 0:15:36,000
this is not,

300
0:15:37.28,000 --> 0:15:4,000
and this is not what a working mother looks like.

301
0:15:42.2,000 --> 0:15:43,000
(Applause)

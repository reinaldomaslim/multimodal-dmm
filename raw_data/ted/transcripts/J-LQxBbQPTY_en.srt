2
0:00:15.93,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Evidence suggests that humans in all ages and from all cultures

3
0:00:20.596,000 --> 0:00:24,000
create their identity in some kind of narrative form.

4
0:00:24.746,000 --> 0:00:26,000
From mother to daughter, preacher to congregant,

5
0:00:27.487,000 --> 0:00:3,000
teacher to pupil, storyteller to audience.

6
0:00:30.551,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Whether in cave paintings

7
0:00:32.341,000 --> 0:00:34,000
or the latest uses of the Internet,

8
0:00:34.971,000 --> 0:00:37,000
human beings have always told their histories and truths

9
0:00:38.802,000 --> 0:00:4,000
through parable and fable.

10
0:00:41.259,000 --> 0:00:44,000
We are inveterate storytellers.

11
0:00:44.736,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But where, in our increasingly secular and fragmented world,

12
0:00:49.119,000 --> 0:00:53,000
do we offer communality of experience,

13
0:00:53.217,000 --> 0:00:57,000
unmediated by our own furious consumerism?

14
0:00:57.567,000 --> 0:01:,000
And what narrative, what history,

15
0:01:01.067,000 --> 0:01:03,000
what identity, what moral code

16
0:01:03.748,000 --> 0:01:06,000
are we imparting to our young?

17
0:01:07.1,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Cinema is arguably

18
0:01:09.982,000 --> 0:01:11,000
the 20th century's most influential art form.

19
0:01:12.567,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Its artists told stories

20
0:01:14.617,000 --> 0:01:15,000
across national boundaries,

21
0:01:15.899,000 --> 0:01:17,000
in as many languages, genres and philosophies

22
0:01:18.767,000 --> 0:01:19,000
as one can imagine.

23
0:01:20.017,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Indeed, it is hard to find a subject

24
0:01:22.649,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that film has yet to tackle.

25
0:01:24.666,000 --> 0:01:25,000
During the last decade

26
0:01:26.317,000 --> 0:01:28,000
we've seen a vast integration of global media,

27
0:01:28.733,000 --> 0:01:31,000
now dominated by a culture of the Hollywood blockbuster.

28
0:01:32.117,000 --> 0:01:34,000
We are increasingly offered a diet

29
0:01:34.533,000 --> 0:01:37,000
in which sensation, not story, is king.

30
0:01:38.017,000 --> 0:01:4,000
What was common to us all 40 years ago --

31
0:01:40.45,000 --> 0:01:42,000
the telling of stories between generations --

32
0:01:43.249,000 --> 0:01:45,000
is now rarified.

33
0:01:45.334,000 --> 0:01:47,000
As a filmmaker, it worried me.

34
0:01:47.582,000 --> 0:01:5,000
As a human being, it puts the fear of God in me.

35
0:01:51.449,000 --> 0:01:53,000
What future could the young build

36
0:01:53.866,000 --> 0:01:54,000
with so little grasp

37
0:01:55.233,000 --> 0:01:56,000
of where they've come from

38
0:01:57.017,000 --> 0:02:,000
and so few narratives of what's possible?

39
0:02:00.075,000 --> 0:02:01,000
The irony is palpable;

40
0:02:01.723,000 --> 0:02:04,000
technical access has never been greater,

41
0:02:05.224,000 --> 0:02:08,000
cultural access never weaker.

42
0:02:08.291,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And so in 2006 we set up FILMCLUB,

43
0:02:12.624,000 --> 0:02:16,000
an organization that ran weekly film screenings in schools

44
0:02:16.659,000 --> 0:02:18,000
followed by discussions.

45
0:02:18.741,000 --> 0:02:21,000
If we could raid the annals of 100 years of film,

46
0:02:22.474,000 --> 0:02:24,000
maybe we could build a narrative

47
0:02:24.542,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that would deliver meaning

48
0:02:26.09,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to the fragmented and restless world of the young.

49
0:02:29.173,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Given the access to technology,

50
0:02:30.776,000 --> 0:02:33,000
even a school in a tiny rural hamlet

51
0:02:34.507,000 --> 0:02:37,000
could project a DVD onto a white board.

52
0:02:38.208,000 --> 0:02:39,000
In the first nine months

53
0:02:40.042,000 --> 0:02:42,000
we ran 25 clubs across the U.K.,

54
0:02:42.39,000 --> 0:02:45,000
with kids in age groups between five and 18

55
0:02:45.458,000 --> 0:02:48,000
watching a film uninterrupted for 90 minutes.

56
0:02:48.49,000 --> 0:02:5,000
The films were curated and contextualized.

57
0:02:51.374,000 --> 0:02:52,000
But the choice was theirs,

58
0:02:53.125,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and our audience quickly grew

59
0:02:54.941,000 --> 0:02:58,000
to choose the richest and most varied diet that we could provide.

60
0:02:59.174,000 --> 0:03:01,000
The outcome, immediate.

61
0:03:01.973,000 --> 0:03:06,000
It was an education of the most profound and transformative kind.

62
0:03:07.559,000 --> 0:03:1,000
In groups as large as 150 and as small as three,

63
0:03:10.891,000 --> 0:03:12,000
these young people discovered new places,

64
0:03:13.607,000 --> 0:03:14,000
new thoughts, new perspectives.

65
0:03:15.524,000 --> 0:03:17,000
By the time the pilot had finished,

66
0:03:17.658,000 --> 0:03:19,000
we had the names of a thousand schools

67
0:03:20.491,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that wished to join.

68
0:03:24.31,000 --> 0:03:25,000
The film that changed my life

69
0:03:25.931,000 --> 0:03:29,000
is a 1951 film by Vittorio De Sica, "Miracle in Milan."

70
0:03:30.898,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It's a remarkable comment

71
0:03:32.651,000 --> 0:03:35,000
on slums, poverty and aspiration.

72
0:03:35.981,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I had seen the film on the occasion of my father's 50th birthday.

73
0:03:40.215,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Technology then meant we had to hire a viewing cinema,

74
0:03:44.177,000 --> 0:03:46,000
find and pay for the print and the projectionist.

75
0:03:47.154,000 --> 0:03:48,000
But for my father,

76
0:03:48.826,000 --> 0:03:53,000
the emotional and artistic importance of De Sica's vision was so great

77
0:03:54.612,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that he chose to celebrate his half-century

78
0:03:57.243,000 --> 0:04:,000
with his three teenage children and 30 of their friends,

79
0:04:01.108,000 --> 0:04:02,000
"In order," he said,

80
0:04:02.46,000 --> 0:04:05,000
"to pass the baton of concern and hope

81
0:04:05.927,000 --> 0:04:07,000
on to the next generation."

82
0:04:08.41,000 --> 0:04:1,000
In the last shot of "Miracle in Milan,"

83
0:04:11.177,000 --> 0:04:14,000
slum-dwellers float skyward on flying brooms.

84
0:04:15.127,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Sixty years after the film was made

85
0:04:17.659,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and 30 years after I first saw it,

86
0:04:19.86,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I see young faces tilt up in awe,

87
0:04:22.41,000 --> 0:04:24,000
their incredulity matching mine.

88
0:04:24.678,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And the speed with which they associate it

89
0:04:27.176,000 --> 0:04:3,000
with "Slumdog Millionaire" or the favelas in Rio

90
0:04:30.8,000 --> 0:04:32,000
speaks to the enduring nature.

91
0:04:33.748,000 --> 0:04:36,000
In a FILMCLUB season about democracy and government,

92
0:04:36.865,000 --> 0:04:37,000
we screened "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."

93
0:04:38.781,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Made in 1939, the film is older than most of our members' grandparents.

94
0:04:45.2,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Frank Capra's classic values independence and propriety.

95
0:04:49.341,000 --> 0:04:5,000
It shows how to do right,

96
0:04:50.9,000 --> 0:04:51,000
how to be heroically awkward.

97
0:04:52.634,000 --> 0:04:54,000
It is also an expression of faith

98
0:04:55.384,000 --> 0:04:58,000
in the political machine as a force of honor.

99
0:04:58.909,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Shortly after "Mr. Smith" became a FILMCLUB classic,

100
0:05:02.392,000 --> 0:05:06,000
there was a week of all-night filibustering in the House of Lords.

101
0:05:07.058,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And it was with great delight

102
0:05:08.342,000 --> 0:05:1,000
that we found young people up and down the country

103
0:05:10.993,000 --> 0:05:11,000
explaining with authority

104
0:05:12.826,000 --> 0:05:14,000
what filibustering was

105
0:05:14.842,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and why the Lords might defy their bedtime on a point of principle.

106
0:05:20.359,000 --> 0:05:24,000
After all, Jimmy Stewart filibustered for two entire reels.

107
0:05:24.493,000 --> 0:05:27,000
In choosing "Hotel Rwanda,"

108
0:05:27.56,000 --> 0:05:3,000
they explored genocide of the most brutal kind.

109
0:05:30.843,000 --> 0:05:33,000
It provoked tears as well as incisive questions

110
0:05:34.376,000 --> 0:05:35,000
about unarmed peace-keeping forces

111
0:05:36.176,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and the double-dealing of a Western society

112
0:05:38.859,000 --> 0:05:41,000
that picks its moral fights with commodities in mind.

113
0:05:42.793,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And when "Schindler's List" demanded that they never forget,

114
0:05:46.859,000 --> 0:05:5,000
one child, full of the pain of consciousness, remarked,

115
0:05:50.976,000 --> 0:05:51,000
"We already forgot,

116
0:05:52.245,000 --> 0:05:56,000
otherwise how did 'Hotel Rwanda' happen?"

117
0:05:56.259,000 --> 0:05:59,000
As they watch more films their lives got palpably richer.

118
0:06:00.026,000 --> 0:06:04,000
"Pickpocket" started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement.

119
0:06:04.659,000 --> 0:06:07,000
"To Sir, with Love" ignited its teen audience.

120
0:06:08.526,000 --> 0:06:1,000
They celebrated a change in attitude

121
0:06:11.175,000 --> 0:06:12,000
towards non-white Britons,

122
0:06:12.875,000 --> 0:06:15,000
but railed against our restless school system

123
0:06:16.295,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that does not value collective identity,

124
0:06:19.343,000 --> 0:06:25,000
unlike that offered by Sidney Poitier's careful tutelage.

125
0:06:25.41,000 --> 0:06:29,000
By now, these thoughtful, opinionated, curious young people

126
0:06:29.525,000 --> 0:06:31,000
thought nothing of tackling films of all forms --

127
0:06:32.36,000 --> 0:06:33,000
black and white, subtitled,

128
0:06:33.675,000 --> 0:06:35,000
documentary, non-narrative, fantasy --

129
0:06:36.409,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and thought nothing of writing detailed reviews

130
0:06:39.108,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that competed to favor one film over another

131
0:06:42.592,000 --> 0:06:45,000
in passionate and increasingly sophisticated prose.

132
0:06:46.416,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Six thousand reviews each school week

133
0:06:49.582,000 --> 0:06:53,000
vying for the honor of being review of the week.

134
0:06:54.1,000 --> 0:06:58,000
From 25 clubs, we became hundreds, then thousands,

135
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
until we were nearly a quarter of a million kids

136
0:07:01.242,000 --> 0:07:04,000
in 7,000 clubs right across the country.

137
0:07:04.658,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And although the numbers were, and continue to be, extraordinary,

138
0:07:07.542,000 --> 0:07:09,000
what became more extraordinary

139
0:07:09.825,000 --> 0:07:12,000
was how the experience of critical and curious questioning

140
0:07:13.375,000 --> 0:07:15,000
translated into life.

141
0:07:15.893,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Some of our kids started talking with their parents,

142
0:07:18.76,000 --> 0:07:19,000
others with their teachers,

143
0:07:20.526,000 --> 0:07:2,000
or with their friends.

144
0:07:21.509,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And those without friends

145
0:07:23.209,000 --> 0:07:25,000
started making them.

146
0:07:25.41,000 --> 0:07:3,000
The films provided communality across all manner of divide.

147
0:07:30.726,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And the stories they held provided a shared experience.

148
0:07:33.843,000 --> 0:07:37,000
"Persepolis" brought a daughter closer to her Iranian mother,

149
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and "Jaws" became the way in which one young boy

150
0:07:42.061,000 --> 0:07:45,000
was able to articulate the fear he'd experienced

151
0:07:45.626,000 --> 0:07:46,000
in flight from violence

152
0:07:47.176,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that killed first his father then his mother,

153
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
the latter thrown overboard on a boat journey.

154
0:07:55.042,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Who was right, who wrong?

155
0:07:57.001,000 --> 0:07:59,000
What would they do under the same conditions?

156
0:07:59.117,000 --> 0:08:,000
Was the tale told well?

157
0:08:00.666,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Was there a hidden message?

158
0:08:02.267,000 --> 0:08:04,000
How has the world changed? How could it be different?

159
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:09,000
A tsunami of questions flew out of the mouths of children

160
0:08:09.884,000 --> 0:08:1,000
who the world didn't think were interested.

161
0:08:11.634,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And they themselves had not known they cared.

162
0:08:15.105,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And as they wrote and debated,

163
0:08:17.017,000 --> 0:08:19,000
rather than seeing the films as artifacts,

164
0:08:19.983,000 --> 0:08:24,000
they began to see themselves.

165
0:08:25.049,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I have an aunt who is a wonderful storyteller.

166
0:08:28.214,000 --> 0:08:3,000
In a moment she can invoke images

167
0:08:30.368,000 --> 0:08:33,000
of running barefoot on Table Mountain and playing cops and robbers.

168
0:08:34.333,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Quite recently she told me

169
0:08:35.899,000 --> 0:08:38,000
that in 1948, two of her sisters and my father

170
0:08:39.298,000 --> 0:08:41,000
traveled on a boat to Israel without my grandparents.

171
0:08:41.946,000 --> 0:08:45,000
When the sailors mutinied at sea in a demand for humane conditions,

172
0:08:46.412,000 --> 0:08:49,000
it was these teenagers that fed the crew.

173
0:08:50.146,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I was past 40 when my father died.

174
0:08:52.296,000 --> 0:08:54,000
He never mentioned that journey.

175
0:08:54.848,000 --> 0:08:57,000
My mother's mother left Europe in a hurry

176
0:08:58.533,000 --> 0:09:01,000
without her husband, but with her three-year-old daughter

177
0:09:01.93,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and diamonds sewn into the hem of her skirt.

178
0:09:05.761,000 --> 0:09:06,000
After two years in hiding,

179
0:09:07.045,000 --> 0:09:09,000
my grandfather appeared in London.

180
0:09:09.879,000 --> 0:09:11,000
He was never right again.

181
0:09:12.179,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And his story was hushed as he assimilated.

182
0:09:16.88,000 --> 0:09:19,000
My story started in England

183
0:09:20.818,000 --> 0:09:24,000
with a clean slate and the silence of immigrant parents.

184
0:09:25.081,000 --> 0:09:27,000
I had "Anne Frank," "The Great Escape,"

185
0:09:27.232,000 --> 0:09:29,000
"Shoah," "Triumph of the Will."

186
0:09:29.746,000 --> 0:09:31,000
It was Leni Riefenstahl

187
0:09:31.801,000 --> 0:09:33,000
in her elegant Nazi propaganda

188
0:09:34.584,000 --> 0:09:37,000
who gave context to what the family had to endure.

189
0:09:38.492,000 --> 0:09:43,000
These films held what was too hurtful to say out loud,

190
0:09:44.142,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and they became more useful to me

191
0:09:46.492,000 --> 0:09:48,000
than the whispers of survivors

192
0:09:49.209,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and the occasional glimpse of a tattoo

193
0:09:52.144,000 --> 0:09:54,000
on a maiden aunt's wrist.

194
0:09:54.992,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Purists may feel that fiction dissipates

195
0:09:57.775,000 --> 0:10:,000
the quest of real human understanding,

196
0:10:00.776,000 --> 0:10:01,000
that film is too crude

197
0:10:02.275,000 --> 0:10:04,000
to tell a complex and detailed history,

198
0:10:04.709,000 --> 0:10:08,000
or that filmmakers always serve drama over truth.

199
0:10:08.959,000 --> 0:10:11,000
But within the reels lie purpose and meaning.

200
0:10:12.093,000 --> 0:10:15,000
As one 12-year-old said after watching "Wizard of Oz,"

201
0:10:15.36,000 --> 0:10:17,000
"Every person should watch this,

202
0:10:17.659,000 --> 0:10:18,000
because unless you do

203
0:10:19.509,000 --> 0:10:23,000
you may not know that you too have a heart."

204
0:10:24.176,000 --> 0:10:28,000
We honor reading, why not honor watching with the same passion?

205
0:10:28.575,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Consider "Citizen Kane" as valuable as Jane Austen.

206
0:10:31.869,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Agree that "Boyz n the Hood," like Tennyson,

207
0:10:35.068,000 --> 0:10:39,000
offers an emotional landscape and a heightened understanding

208
0:10:39.086,000 --> 0:10:4,000
that work together.

209
0:10:40.835,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Each a piece of memorable art,

210
0:10:42.369,000 --> 0:10:45,000
each a brick in the wall of who we are.

211
0:10:45.818,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And it's okay if we remember Tom Hanks

212
0:10:48.685,000 --> 0:10:5,000
better than astronaut Jim Lovell

213
0:10:50.735,000 --> 0:10:54,000
or have Ben Kingsley's face superimposed onto that of Gandhi's.

214
0:10:55.299,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And though not real, Eve Harrington, Howard Beale, Mildred Pierce

215
0:10:58.855,000 --> 0:11:,000
are an opportunity to discover

216
0:11:01.552,000 --> 0:11:03,000
what it is to be human,

217
0:11:03.968,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and no less helpful to understanding our life and times

218
0:11:08.002,000 --> 0:11:13,000
as Shakespeare is in illuminating the world of Elizabethan England.

219
0:11:13.752,000 --> 0:11:14,000
We guessed that film,

220
0:11:15.32,000 --> 0:11:16,000
whose stories are a meeting place

221
0:11:17.319,000 --> 0:11:19,000
of drama, music, literature and human experience,

222
0:11:19.548,000 --> 0:11:23,000
would engage and inspire the young people participating in FILMCLUB.

223
0:11:24.053,000 --> 0:11:25,000
What we could not have foreseen

224
0:11:25.585,000 --> 0:11:26,000
was the measurable improvements

225
0:11:27.218,000 --> 0:11:3,000
in behavior, confidence and academic achievement.

226
0:11:30.936,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Once-reluctant students now race to school, talk to their teachers,

227
0:11:35.218,000 --> 0:11:36,000
fight, not on the playground,

228
0:11:36.703,000 --> 0:11:38,000
but to choose next week's film --

229
0:11:38.836,000 --> 0:11:41,000
young people who have found self-definition, ambition

230
0:11:42.422,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and an appetite for education and social engagement

231
0:11:46.669,000 --> 0:11:48,000
from the stories they have witnessed.

232
0:11:49.635,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Our members defy the binary description

233
0:11:53.018,000 --> 0:11:55,000
of how we so often describe our young.

234
0:11:55.836,000 --> 0:11:59,000
They are neither feral nor myopically self-absorbed.

235
0:12:00.819,000 --> 0:12:01,000
They are, like other young people,

236
0:12:02.586,000 --> 0:12:05,000
negotiating a world with infinite choice,

237
0:12:06.053,000 --> 0:12:1,000
but little culture of how to find meaningful experience.

238
0:12:10.753,000 --> 0:12:12,000
We appeared surprised at the behaviors

239
0:12:13.387,000 --> 0:12:14,000
of those who define themselves

240
0:12:15.385,000 --> 0:12:17,000
by the size of the tick on their shoes,

241
0:12:17.586,000 --> 0:12:21,000
yet acquisition has been the narrative we have offered.

242
0:12:21.835,000 --> 0:12:22,000
If we want different values

243
0:12:23.652,000 --> 0:12:26,000
we have to tell a different story,

244
0:12:27.119,000 --> 0:12:31,000
a story that understands that an individual narrative

245
0:12:31.121,000 --> 0:12:34,000
is an essential component of a person's identity,

246
0:12:34.984,000 --> 0:12:35,000
that a collective narrative

247
0:12:36.753,000 --> 0:12:39,000
is an essential component of a cultural identity,

248
0:12:40.734,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and without it it is impossible to imagine yourself

249
0:12:44.468,000 --> 0:12:45,000
as part of a group.

250
0:12:45.869,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Because when these people get home

251
0:12:48.925,000 --> 0:12:5,000
after a screening of "Rear Window"

252
0:12:51.444,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and raise their gaze to the building next door,

253
0:12:54.193,000 --> 0:12:57,000
they have the tools to wonder who, apart from them,

254
0:12:57.858,000 --> 0:12:58,000
is out there

255
0:12:59.425,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and what is their story.

256
0:13:01.958,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Thank you.

257
0:13:03.609,000 --> 0:13:05,000
(Applause)

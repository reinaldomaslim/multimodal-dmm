1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Pat Mitchell: You have brought us images from the Yemen Times.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And take us through those,

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and introduce us to another Yemen.

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Nadia Al-Sakkaf: Well, I'm glad to be here.

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And I would like to share with you all

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
some of the pictures that are happening today in Yemen.

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
This picture shows a revolution

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
started by women,

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and it shows women and men

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
leading a mixed protest.

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
The other picture

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
is the popularity of the real need for change.

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
So many people are there.

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
The intensity of the upspring.

15
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
This picture shows that the revolution

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
has allowed opportunities for training,

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
for education.

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
These women are learning about first aid

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and their rights according to the constitution.

20
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I love this picture.

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I just wanted to show

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
that over 60 percent of the Yemeni population

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
are 15 years and below.

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And they were excluded from decision-making,

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and now they are in the forefront of the news,

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
raising the flag.

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
English --

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
you will see, this is jeans

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and tights,

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and an English expression --

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
the ability to share with the world

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
what is going on in our own country.

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And expression also,

34
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
it has brought talents.

35
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Yemenis are using cartoons

36
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and art,

37
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
paintings, comics,

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
to tell the world and each other

39
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
about what's going on.

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Obviously, there's always the dark side of it.

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And this is just one of the less-gruesome pictures

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
of the revolution

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
and the cost that we have to pay.

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
The solidarity

45
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
of millions of Yemenis across the country

46
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
just demanding the one thing.

47
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And finally, lots of people are saying

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that Yemen's revolution

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
is going to break the country.

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Is it going to be so many different countries?

51
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Is it going to be another Somalia?

52
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
But we want to tell the world that, no,

53
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
under the one flag, we'll still remain as Yemeni people.

54
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
PM: Thank you for those images, Nadia.

55
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And they do, in many ways,

56
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
tell a different story

57
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
than the story of Yemen,

58
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
the one that is often in the news.

59
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And yet, you yourself

60
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
defy all those characterizations.

61
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
So let's talk about the personal story for a moment.

62
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Your father is murdered.

63
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
The Yemen Times already has

64
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
a strong reputation in Yemen

65
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
as an independent English language newspaper.

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
How did you then

67
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
make the decision and assume the responsibilities

68
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
of running a newspaper,

69
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
especially in such times of conflict?

70
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
NA: Well, let me first warn you

71
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that I'm not the traditional Yemeni girl.

72
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I've guessed you've already noticed this by now.

73
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
In Yemen, most women are veiled

75
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and they are sitting behind doors

76
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and not very much part of the public life.

77
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
But there's so much potential.

78
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I wish I could show you my Yemen.

79
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I wish you could see

80
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Yemen through my eyes.

81
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Then you would know

82
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that there's so much to it.

83
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And I was privileged because I was born into a family,

84
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
my father would always encourage the boys and the girls.

85
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
He would say we are equal.

86
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And he was such an extraordinary man.

87
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And even my mother -- I owe it to my family.

88
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
A story:

89
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I studied in India.

90
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And in my third year, I started becoming confused

91
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
because I was Yemeni,

92
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
but I was also mixing up

93
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
with a lot of my friends in college.

94
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And I went back home and I said,

95
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
"Daddy, I don't know who I am.

96
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I'm not a Yemeni; I'm not an Indian."

97
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And he said, "You are the bridge."

98
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And that is something I will keep in my heart forever.

99
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
So since then I've been the bridge,

100
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and a lot of people have walked over me.

101
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
PM: I don't think so. (Laughter)

102
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
NA: But it just helps tell

103
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
that some people are change agents

104
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
in the society.

105
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And when I became editor-in-chief

106
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
after my brother actually --

107
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
my father passed away in 1999,

108
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and then my brother until 2005 --

109
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and everybody was betting that I will not be able to do it.

110
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
"What's this young girl coming in and showing off

111
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
because it's her family business," or something.

112
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It was very hard at first.

113
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I didn't want to clash with people.

114
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
But with all due respect

115
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
to all the men, and the older men especially,

116
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
they did not want me around.

117
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
It was very hard, you know,

118
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
to impose my authority.

119
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
But a woman's got to do what a woman's got to do.

120
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
(Applause)

121
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And in the first year,

122
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I had to fire half of the men.

123
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
(Laughter)

124
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
(Applause)

125
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Brought in more women.

126
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Brought in younger men.

127
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And we have a more gender-balanced newsroom today.

128
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
The other thing is that it's about professionalism.

129
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
It's about proving who you are and what you can do.

130
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And I don't know if I'm going to be boasting now,

131
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
but in 2006 alone,

132
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
we won three international awards.

133
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
One of them is the IPI

134
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Free Media Pioneer Award.

135
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So that was the answer

136
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
to all the Yemeni people.

137
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And I want to score a point here,

138
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
because my husband is in the room over there.

139
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
If you could please stand up, [unclear].

140
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
He has been very supportive of me.

141
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
(Applause)

142
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
PM: And we should point out

143
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
that he works with you as well at the paper.

144
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
But in assuming this responsibility

145
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and going about it as you have,

146
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
you have become a bridge

147
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
between an older and traditional society

148
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and the one that you are now creating at the paper.

149
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And so along with changing who worked there,

150
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
you must have come up against another positioning

151
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
that we always run into, in particular with women,

152
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and it has to do with outside image,

153
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
dress, the veiled woman.

154
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So how have you dealt with this

155
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
on a personal level

156
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
as well as the women who worked for you?

157
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
NA: As you know,

158
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
the image of a lot of Yemeni women is a lot of black

159
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and covered, veiled women.

160
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And this is true.

161
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And a lot of it is

162
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
because women are not able, are not free,

163
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
to show their face to their self.

164
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
It's a lot of traditional imposing

165
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
coming by authority figures

166
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
such as the men, the grandparents and so on.

167
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And it's economic empowerment

168
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and the ability for a woman to say,

169
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
"I am as much contributing to this family, or more,

170
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
than you are."

171
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And the more empowered the women become,

172
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
the more they are able to remove the veil, for example,

173
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
or to drive their own car

174
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
or to have a job or to be able to travel.

175
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So the other face of Yemen

176
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
is actually one

177
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
that lies behind the veil,

178
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and it's economic empowerment mostly

179
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
that allows the woman to just uncover it.

180
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And I have done this throughout my work.

181
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I've tried to encourage young girls.

182
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
We started with, you can take it off in the office.

183
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And then after that, you can take it off on assignments.

184
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Because I didn't believe a journalist can be a journalist with --

185
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
how can you talk to people if you have your face covered? --

186
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and so on; it's just a movement.

187
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And I am a role model in Yemen.

188
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
A lot of people look up to me.

189
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
A lot of young girls look up to me.

190
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And I need to prove to them that, yes, you can still be married,

191
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
you can still be a mother,

192
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and you can still be respected within the society,

193
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
but at the same time,

194
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that doesn't mean you [should] just be one of the crowd.

195
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
You can be yourself and have your face.

196
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
PM: But by putting yourself personally out there --

197
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
both projecting a different image

198
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
of Yemeni women,

199
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
but also what you have made possible

200
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
for the women who work at the paper --

201
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
has this put you in personal danger?

202
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
NA: Well the Yemen Times, across 20 years,

203
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
has been through so much.

204
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
We've suffered prosecution;

205
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
the paper was closed down more than three times.

206
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
It's an independent newspaper,

207
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
but tell that to the people in charge.

208
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
They think that if there's anything against them,

209
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
then we are being an opposition newspaper.

210
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
And very, very difficult times.

211
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Some of my reporters were arrested.

212
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
We had some court cases.

213
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
My father was assassinated.

214
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Today, we are in a much better situation.

215
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
We've created the credibility.

216
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And in times of revolution or change like today,

217
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
it is very important for independent media to have a voice.

218
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
It's very important

219
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
for you to go to YemenTimes.com,

220
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and it's very important

221
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
to listen to our voice.

222
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And this is probably something

223
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
I'm going to share with you

224
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
in Western media probably --

225
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and how there's a lot of stereotypes --

226
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
thinking of Yemen in one single frame:

227
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
this is what Yemen is all about.

228
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And that's not fair.

229
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
It's not fair for me; it's not fair for my country.

230
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
A lot of reporters come to Yemen

231
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and they want to write a story on Al-Qaeda or terrorism.

232
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And I just wanted to share with you:

233
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
there's one reporter that came.

234
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
He wanted to do a documentary

235
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
on what his editors wanted.

236
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And he ended up writing about a story that even surprised me --

237
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
hip hop --

238
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that there are young Yemeni men

239
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
who express themselves

240
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
through dancing and puchu puchu.

241
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
(Laughter)

242
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
That thing. (PM: Rap. Break dancing.)

243
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Yeah, break dancing.

244
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
I'm not so old.

245
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I'm just not in touch.

246
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
(Laughter)

247
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
(Applause)

248
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
PM: Yes, you are.

249
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Actually, that's a documentary

250
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
that's available online; the video's online.

251
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
NA: ShaketheDust.org.

252
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
PM: "Shake the Dust." (NA: "Shake the Dust.")

253
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
PM: ShaketheDust.org.

254
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And it definitely does give a different image of Yemen.

255
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
You spoke about the responsibility of the press.

256
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And certainly, when we look

257
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
at the ways in which we have separated ourselves from others

258
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and we've created fear

259
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and danger,

260
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
often from lack of knowledge,

261
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
lack of real understanding,

262
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
how do you see

263
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
the way that the Western press in particular

264
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
is covering this and all other stories out of the region,

265
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
but in particular, in your country?

266
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
NA: Well there is a saying that says,

267
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
"You fear what you don't know,

268
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and you hate what you fear."

269
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
So it's about the lack of research, basically.

270
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
It's almost, "Do your homework," --

271
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
some involvement.

272
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And you cannot do parachute reporting --

273
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
just jump into a country for two days

274
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and think that you've done your homework and a story.

275
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
So I wish

276
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
that the world would know my Yemen,

277
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
my country, my people.

278
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
I am an example, and there are others like me.

279
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
We may not be that many,

280
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
but if we are promoted

281
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
as a good, positive example,

282
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
there will be others -- men and women --

283
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
who can eventually bridge the gap --

284
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
again, coming to the bridge --

285
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
between Yemen and the world

286
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and telling first

287
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
about recognition

288
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and then about communication

289
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and compassion.

290
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
I think Yemen is going to be

291
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
in a very bad situation

292
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
in the next two or three years.

293
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
It's natural.

294
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
But after the two years, which is a price we are willing to pay,

295
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
we are going to stand up again on our feet,

296
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
but in the new Yemen

297
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
with a younger and more empowered people --

298
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
democratic.

299
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
(Applause)

300
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
PM: Nadia, I think you've just given us

301
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
a very different view of Yemen.

302
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And certainly you yourself and what you do

303
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
have given us a view of the future

304
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
that we will embrace

305
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and be grateful for.

306
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And the very best of luck to you.

307
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
YemenTimes.com.

308
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
NA: On Twitter also.

309
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
PM: So you are plugged in.

310
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.111,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Cancer.

2
0:00:14.476,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It's a devastating disease that takes an enormous emotional toll.

3
0:00:19.317,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Not only on the patient, but the patient's loved ones, as well.

4
0:00:24.081,000 --> 0:00:28,000
It is a battle that the human race has been fighting for centuries.

5
0:00:28.835,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And while we've made some advancements,

6
0:00:31.692,000 --> 0:00:33,000
we still haven't beaten it.

7
0:00:35.033,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Two out of five people in the US will develop cancer in their lifetime.

8
0:00:40.89,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Of those, 90 percent will succumb to the disease due to metastases.

9
0:00:46.554,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Metastasis is a spread of cancer from a primary site to a distal site,

10
0:00:52.101,000 --> 0:00:55,000
through the circulatory or the lymphatic system.

11
0:00:55.879,000 --> 0:00:58,000
For instance, a female patient with breast cancer

12
0:00:59.673,000 --> 0:01:03,000
doesn't succumb to the disease simply because she has a mass on her breast.

13
0:01:04.228,000 --> 0:01:06,000
She succumbs to the disease because it spreads

14
0:01:07.046,000 --> 0:01:11,000
to the lungs, liver, lymph nodes, brain, bone,

15
0:01:11.514,000 --> 0:01:14,000
where it becomes unresectable or untreatable.

16
0:01:15.927,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Metastasis is a complicated process.

17
0:01:18.8,000 --> 0:01:2,000
One that I've studied for several years now.

18
0:01:21.879,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And something that my team and I discovered recently

19
0:01:25.355,000 --> 0:01:28,000
was that cancer cells are able to communicate with each other

20
0:01:29.133,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and coordinate their movement,

21
0:01:31.3,000 --> 0:01:35,000
based on how closely packed they are in the tumor microenvironment.

22
0:01:36.887,000 --> 0:01:39,000
They communicate with each other through two signaling molecules

23
0:01:40.394,000 --> 0:01:42,000
called Interleukin-6 and Interleukin-8.

24
0:01:43.839,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Now, like anything else in nature,

25
0:01:46.934,000 --> 0:01:5,000
when things get a little too tight, the signal is enhanced,

26
0:01:51.601,000 --> 0:01:55,000
causing the cancer cells to move away faster from the primary site

27
0:01:56.141,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and spread to a new site.

28
0:01:59.18,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So, if we block this signal, using a drug cocktail that we developed,

29
0:02:04.919,000 --> 0:02:07,000
we can stop the communication between cancer cells

30
0:02:08.617,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and slow down the spread of cancer.

31
0:02:12.514,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Let me pause here for a second

32
0:02:14.3,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and take you back to when this all began for me in 2010,

33
0:02:19.125,000 --> 0:02:21,000
when I was just a sophomore in college.

34
0:02:22.346,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I had just started working in Dr Danny Wirtz's lab

35
0:02:25.776,000 --> 0:02:26,000
at Johns Hopkins University.

36
0:02:28.347,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And I'll be honest: I was a young, naive, Sri Lankan girl,

37
0:02:33.696,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:34.879,000 --> 0:02:37,000
who had no previous research experience.

39
0:02:38.537,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And I was tasked to look at how cancer cells move

40
0:02:42.157,000 --> 0:02:44,000
in a 3D collagen I matrix

41
0:02:44.839,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that recapsulated, in a dish,

42
0:02:47.252,000 --> 0:02:51,000
the conditions that cancer cells are exposed to in our bodies.

43
0:02:52.117,000 --> 0:02:53,000
This was new and exciting for me,

44
0:02:53.927,000 --> 0:02:58,000
because previous work had been done on 2D, flat, plastic dishes

45
0:02:58.974,000 --> 0:03:,000
that really weren't representative

46
0:03:01.553,000 --> 0:03:04,000
of what the cancer cells are exposed to in our bodies.

47
0:03:05.665,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Because, let's face it,

48
0:03:07.975,000 --> 0:03:11,000
the cancer cells in our bodies aren't stuck onto plastic dishes.

49
0:03:13.006,000 --> 0:03:16,000
It was during this time that I attended a seminar

50
0:03:16.307,000 --> 0:03:2,000
conducted by Dr Bonnie Bassler from Princeton University,

51
0:03:20.371,000 --> 0:03:24,000
where she talked about how bacteria cells communicate with each other,

52
0:03:25.061,000 --> 0:03:29,000
based on their population density, and perform a specific action.

53
0:03:30.236,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It was at this moment that a light bulb went off in my head, and I thought,

54
0:03:35.209,000 --> 0:03:38,000
"Wow, I see this in my cancer cells every day,

55
0:03:38.765,000 --> 0:03:39,000
when it comes to their movement."

56
0:03:40.908,000 --> 0:03:42,000
The idea for my project was thus born.

57
0:03:44.307,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I hypothesized that cancer cells are able to communicate with each other

58
0:03:49.323,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and coordinate their movement,

59
0:03:51.537,000 --> 0:03:55,000
based on how closely packed they are in the tumor microenvironment.

60
0:03:57.22,000 --> 0:04:,000
I became obsessed with pursuing this hypothesis.

61
0:04:01.243,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And fortunately, I work for someone

62
0:04:04.054,000 --> 0:04:06,000
who is open to running with my crazy ideas.

63
0:04:07.466,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So, I threw myself into this project.

64
0:04:10.665,000 --> 0:04:12,000
However, I couldn't do it by myself.

65
0:04:13.958,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I needed help.

66
0:04:15.442,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I definitely needed help.

67
0:04:17.593,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So we recruited undergraduate students, graduate students,

68
0:04:20.839,000 --> 0:04:22,000
postdoctoral fellows and professors

69
0:04:23.458,000 --> 0:04:26,000
from different institutions and multiple disciplines

70
0:04:27.371,000 --> 0:04:3,000
to come together and work on this idea

71
0:04:30.509,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that I conceived as a sophomore in college.

72
0:04:33.935,000 --> 0:04:36,000
After years of conducting experiments together

73
0:04:37.262,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and merging different ideas and perspectives,

74
0:04:40.818,000 --> 0:04:43,000
we discovered a new signaling pathway

75
0:04:44.165,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that controls how cancer cells communicate with each other and move,

76
0:04:49.284,000 --> 0:04:5,000
based on their cell density.

77
0:04:52.331,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Some of you might have heard this,

78
0:04:54.039,000 --> 0:04:58,000
because most of social media knows it as the Hasini effect.

79
0:04:58.411,000 --> 0:05:,000
(Laughter)

80
0:05:01.253,000 --> 0:05:07,000
(Applause)

81
0:05:08.28,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And we weren't done yet.

82
0:05:09.994,000 --> 0:05:13,000
We then decided that we wanted to block this signaling pathway

83
0:05:14.042,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and see if we could slow down the spread of cancer.

84
0:05:17.307,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Which we did, in preclinical animal models.

85
0:05:20.458,000 --> 0:05:24,000
We came up with a drug cocktail consisting of tocilizumab,

86
0:05:24.553,000 --> 0:05:26,000
which is currently used to treat rheumatoid arthritis,

87
0:05:27.562,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and reparixin, which is currently in clinical trials against breast cancer.

88
0:05:33.061,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And interestingly, what we found was that this cocktail of drugs

89
0:05:38.022,000 --> 0:05:4,000
really had no effect on tumor growth,

90
0:05:40.624,000 --> 0:05:42,000
but directly targeted metastases.

91
0:05:43.982,000 --> 0:05:45,000
This was a significant finding,

92
0:05:46.784,000 --> 0:05:5,000
because currently, there aren't any FDA-approved therapeutics

93
0:05:51.077,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that directly target the spread of cancer.

94
0:05:54.149,000 --> 0:05:57,000
In fact, the spread of cancer, metastasis,

95
0:05:57.66,000 --> 0:06:,000
is thought of as a byproduct of tumor growth.

96
0:06:01.168,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Where the idea is, if we can stop the tumor from growing,

97
0:06:04.986,000 --> 0:06:06,000
we can stop the tumor from spreading.

98
0:06:07.744,000 --> 0:06:11,000
However, most of us know that this is not true.

99
0:06:12.776,000 --> 0:06:15,000
We, on the other hand, came up with the drug cocktail

100
0:06:16.506,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that targets metastasis not by targeting tumor growth,

101
0:06:20.609,000 --> 0:06:23,000
but by targeting the complex mechanisms that govern it,

102
0:06:24.3,000 --> 0:06:27,000
through the targeting of the Hasini effect.

103
0:06:27.471,000 --> 0:06:28,000
(Laughter)

104
0:06:29.244,000 --> 0:06:33,000
This work was recently published in "Nature Communications,"

105
0:06:33.539,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and my team and I received an overwhelming response from around the world.

106
0:06:38.95,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Nobody on my team could have predicted this sort of response.

107
0:06:42.934,000 --> 0:06:43,000
We seem to have struck a nerve.

108
0:06:45.267,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Looking back, I am extremely grateful for the positive response that I received,

109
0:06:50.797,000 --> 0:06:53,000
not only from academia, but also patients,

110
0:06:53.885,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and people around the world affected by this terrible disease.

111
0:06:58.807,000 --> 0:07:03,000
As I reflect on this success I've encountered with the Hasini effect,

112
0:07:03.927,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I keep coming back to the people that I was fortunate enough to work with.

113
0:07:09.678,000 --> 0:07:1,000
The undergraduate students

114
0:07:11.338,000 --> 0:07:16,000
who demonstrated superhuman powers through their hard work and dedication.

115
0:07:16.886,000 --> 0:07:19,000
The graduate students and the postdoctoral fellows,

116
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
my fellow Avengers, who taught me new techniques

117
0:07:23.832,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and always made sure I stayed on track.

118
0:07:26.95,000 --> 0:07:3,000
The professors, my Yodas and my Obi-Wan Kenobis,

119
0:07:31.284,000 --> 0:07:36,000
who brought their expertise into making this work into what it is today.

120
0:07:37.371,000 --> 0:07:4,000
The support staff, the friends and family,

121
0:07:40.593,000 --> 0:07:42,000
people who lifted our spirits,

122
0:07:43.157,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and never let us give up on our ambitious endeavors.

123
0:07:47.196,000 --> 0:07:5,000
The best kind of sidekicks we could have asked for.

124
0:07:50.966,000 --> 0:07:53,000
It took a village to help me study metastasis.

125
0:07:54.347,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And believe me, without my village, I wouldn't be here.

126
0:07:59.205,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Today, our team has grown,

127
0:08:01.673,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and we are using the Hasini effect to develop combination therapies

128
0:08:06.355,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that will effectively target tumor growth and metastases.

129
0:08:10.458,000 --> 0:08:13,000
We are engineering new anticancer therapeutics,

130
0:08:13.847,000 --> 0:08:16,000
to limit toxicity and to reduce drug resistance.

131
0:08:17.958,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And we are developing groundbreaking systems

132
0:08:21.284,000 --> 0:08:25,000
that will help for the development of better human clinical trials.

133
0:08:26.474,000 --> 0:08:3,000
It blows my mind to think that all this,

134
0:08:30.903,000 --> 0:08:32,000
the incredible work that I'm pursuing --

135
0:08:33.682,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and the fact that I'm standing here, talking to you today --

136
0:08:36.857,000 --> 0:08:39,000
all came from this tiny idea

137
0:08:40.048,000 --> 0:08:42,000
that I had when I was sitting at the back of a seminar

138
0:08:43.032,000 --> 0:08:44,000
when I was just 20 years old.

139
0:08:46.325,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I recognize that right now, I am on this incredible journey

140
0:08:50.738,000 --> 0:08:54,000
that allows me to pursue work that I am extremely passionate about,

141
0:08:55.022,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and something that feeds my curiosity on a daily basis.

142
0:08:59.879,000 --> 0:09:04,000
But I have to say, my favorite part of all of this --

143
0:09:05.002,000 --> 0:09:08,000
other than, of course, being here, talking to you, today --

144
0:09:08.033,000 --> 0:09:12,000
is the fact that I get to work with a diverse group of people,

145
0:09:12.99,000 --> 0:09:17,000
who make my work stronger, better and just so much more fun.

146
0:09:19.694,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And because of this, I have to say

147
0:09:22.416,000 --> 0:09:25,000
that collaboration is my favorite superhuman power.

148
0:09:26.94,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And what I love about this power is that it's not unique to me.

149
0:09:31.415,000 --> 0:09:32,000
It's within all of us.

150
0:09:33.7,000 --> 0:09:36,000
My work shows that even cancer cells

151
0:09:36.947,000 --> 0:09:4,000
use collaboration to invade our bodies and spread their wrath.

152
0:09:41.958,000 --> 0:09:46,000
For us humans, it is a superpower that has produced incredible discoveries

153
0:09:47.18,000 --> 0:09:49,000
in the medical and scientific field.

154
0:09:49.958,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And it is the superpower that we can all turn to

155
0:09:53.387,000 --> 0:09:56,000
to inspire us to create something bigger than ourselves,

156
0:09:57.101,000 --> 0:10:,000

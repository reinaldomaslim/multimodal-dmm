1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So the Awesome story:

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It begins about 40 years ago,

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
when my mom and my dad came to Canada.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
My mom left Nairobi, Kenya.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
My dad left a small village outside of Amritsar, India.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And they got here in the late 1960s.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
They settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of Toronto,

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and they settled into a new life.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
They saw their first dentist,

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
they ate their first hamburger,

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and they had their first kids.

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
My sister and I

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
grew up here,

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and we had quiet, happy childhoods.

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
We had close family,

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
good friends, a quiet street.

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
We grew up taking for granted

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
a lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
when they grew up --

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
things like power always on

21
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
in our houses,

22
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
things like schools across the street

23
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and hospitals down the road

24
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and popsicles in the backyard.

25
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
We grew up, and we grew older.

26
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I went to high school.

27
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I graduated.

28
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I moved out of the house, I got a job,

29
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I found a girl, I settled down --

30
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and I realize it sounds like a bad sitcom or a Cat Stevens' song --

31
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
but life was pretty good.

33
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Life was pretty good.

34
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
2006 was a great year.

35
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Under clear blue skies in July in the wine region of Ontario,

36
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I got married,

37
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
surrounded by 150 family and friends.

38
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
2007 was a great year.

39
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I graduated from school,

40
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends.

41
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Here's a picture of me and my friend, Chris,

42
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
on the coast of the Pacific Ocean.

43
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
We actually saw seals out of our car window,

44
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them

45
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
and then blocked them with our giant heads.

46
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So you can't actually see them,

48
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
but it was breathtaking,

49
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
believe me.

50
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
(Laughter)

51
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
2008 and 2009 were a little tougher.

52
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I know that they were tougher for a lot of people,

53
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
not just me.

54
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
First of all, the news was so heavy.

55
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
It's still heavy now, and it was heavy before that,

56
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
but when you flipped open a newspaper, when you turned on the TV,

57
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
it was about ice caps melting,

58
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
wars going on around the world,

59
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
earthquakes, hurricanes

60
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse,

61
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and then eventually did collapse,

62
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and so many of us losing our homes,

63
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
or our jobs,

64
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
or our retirements,

65
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
or our livelihoods.

66
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
2008, 2009 were heavy years for me for another reason, too.

67
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I was going through a lot of personal problems at the time.

68
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
My marriage wasn't going well,

69
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
and we just were growing further and further apart.

70
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
One day my wife came home from work

71
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and summoned the courage, through a lot of tears,

72
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to have a very honest conversation.

73
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And she said, "I don't love you anymore,"

74
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and it was one of the most painful things I'd ever heard

75
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and certainly the most heartbreaking thing I'd ever heard,

76
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
until only a month later,

77
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
when I heard something even more heartbreaking.

78
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
My friend Chris, who I just showed you a picture of,

79
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
had been battling mental illness for some time.

80
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And for those of you

81
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
whose lives have been touched by mental illness,

82
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
you know how challenging it can be.

83
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I spoke to him on the phone at 10:30 p.m.

84
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
on a Sunday night.

85
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
We talked about the TV show we watched that evening.

86
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And Monday morning, I found out that he disappeared.

87
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Very sadly, he took his own life.

88
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And it was a really heavy time.

89
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And as these dark clouds were circling me,

90
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and I was finding it really, really difficult

91
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
to think of anything good,

92
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I said to myself that I really needed a way

93
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
to focus on the positive somehow.

94
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So I came home from work one night,

95
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and I logged onto the computer,

96
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and I started up a tiny website

97
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
called 1000awesomethings.com.

98
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I was trying to remind myself

99
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
of the simple, universal, little pleasures that we all love,

100
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
but we just don't talk about enough --

101
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
things like waiters and waitresses

102
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
who bring you free refills without asking,

103
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
being the first table to get called up

104
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
to the dinner buffet at a wedding,

105
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer,

106
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
or when cashiers open up a new check-out lane at the grocery store

107
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and you get to be first in line --

108
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
even if you were last at the other line, swoop right in there.

109
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
(Laughter)

110
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And slowly over time,

111
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I started putting myself in a better mood.

112
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I mean, 50,000 blogs

113
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
are started a day,

114
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and so my blog was just one of those 50,000.

115
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And nobody read it except for my mom.

116
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Although I should say that my traffic did skyrocket

117
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and go up by 100 percent

118
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
when she forwarded it to my dad.

119
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Laughter)

120
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And then I got excited

121
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
when it started getting tens of hits,

122
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens

123
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and then hundreds and then thousands

124
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and then millions.

125
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
It started getting bigger and bigger and bigger.

126
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And then I got a phone call,

127
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and the voice at the other end of the line said,

128
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
"You've just won the Best Blog In the World award."

129
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I was like, that sounds totally fake.

130
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
(Laughter)

131
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
(Applause)

132
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Which African country do you want me to wire all my money to?

133
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
(Laughter)

134
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
But it turns out, I jumped on a plane,

135
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and I ended up walking a red carpet

136
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
between Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart.

137
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And I went onstage to accept a Webby award for Best Blog.

138
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And the surprise

139
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and just the amazement of that

140
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
was only overshadowed by my return to Toronto,

141
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
when, in my inbox,

142
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
10 literary agents were waiting for me

143
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
to talk about putting this into a book.

144
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Flash-forward to the next year

145
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and "The Book of Awesome" has now been

146
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
number one on the bestseller list for 20 straight weeks.

147
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
(Applause)

148
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
But look, I said I wanted to do three things with you today.

149
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I said I wanted to tell you the Awesome story,

150
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I wanted to share with you the three As of Awesome,

151
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and I wanted to leave you with a closing thought.

152
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So let's talk about those three As.

153
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Over the last few years,

154
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I haven't had that much time to really think.

155
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
But lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back

156
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and ask myself: "What is it over the last few years

157
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that helped me grow my website,

158
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
but also grow myself?"

159
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And I've summarized those things, for me personally,

160
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
as three As.

161
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
They are Attitude, Awareness

162
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and Authenticity.

163
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I'd love to just talk about each one briefly.

164
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
So Attitude:

165
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Look, we're all going to get lumps,

166
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and we're all going to get bumps.

167
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
None of us can predict the future, but we do know one thing about it

168
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and that's that it ain't gonna go according to plan.

169
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
We will all have high highs

170
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and big days and proud moments

171
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
of smiles on graduation stages,

172
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
father-daughter dances at weddings

173
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and healthy babies screeching in the delivery room,

174
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
but between those high highs,

175
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
we may also have some lumps and some bumps too.

176
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
It's sad, and it's not pleasant to talk about,

177
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
but your husband might leave you,

178
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
your girlfriend could cheat,

179
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
your headaches might be more serious than you thought,

180
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
or your dog could get hit by a car on the street.

181
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
It's not a happy thought,

182
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
but your kids could get mixed up in gangs

183
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
or bad scenes.

184
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Your mom could get cancer,

185
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
your dad could get mean.

186
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And there are times in life

187
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
when you will be tossed in the well, too,

188
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart,

189
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
and when that bad news washes over you,

190
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and when that pain sponges and soaks in,

191
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I just really hope you feel

192
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
like you've always got two choices.

193
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
One, you can swirl and twirl

194
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and gloom and doom forever,

195
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
or two, you can grieve

196
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and then face the future

197
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
with newly sober eyes.

198
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Having a great attitude is about choosing option number two,

199
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and choosing, no matter how difficult it is,

200
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
no matter what pain hits you,

201
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
choosing to move forward and move on

202
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and take baby steps into the future.

203
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
The second "A" is Awareness.

204
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I love hanging out with three year-olds.

205
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I love the way that they see the world,

206
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
because they're seeing the world for the first time.

207
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk.

208
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I love the way that they'll stare slack-jawed

209
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
at their first baseball game

210
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
with wide eyes and a mitt on their hand,

211
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts

212
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and the smell of the hotdogs.

213
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I love the way that they'll spend hours picking dandelions in the backyard

214
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
and putting them into a nice centerpiece

215
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
for Thanksgiving dinner.

216
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I love the way that they see the world,

217
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
because they're seeing the world

218
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
for the first time.

219
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Having a sense of awareness

220
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
is just about embracing your inner three year-old.

221
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Because you all used to be three years old.

222
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
That three-year-old boy is still part of you.

223
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
That three-year-old girl is still part of you.

224
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
They're in there.

225
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And being aware is just about remembering

226
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that you saw everything you've seen

227
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
for the first time once, too.

228
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
So there was a time when it was your first time ever

229
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work.

230
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
There was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery

231
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and smelt the bakery air,

232
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
or the first time you pulled a 20-dollar bill out of your old jacket pocket

233
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and said, "Found money."

234
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
The last "A" is Authenticity.

235
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And for this one, I want to tell you a quick story.

236
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Let's go all the way back to 1932

237
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
when, on a peanut farm in Georgia,

238
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
a little baby boy named Roosevelt Grier was born.

239
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Roosevelt Grier, or Rosey Grier, as people used to call him,

240
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
grew up and grew into

241
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
a 300-pound, six-foot-five linebacker in the NFL.

242
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
He's number 76 in the picture.

243
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Here he is pictured with the "fearsome foursome."

244
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
These were four guys on the L.A. Rams in the 1960s

245
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
you did not want to go up against.

246
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
They were tough football players doing what they love,

247
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
which was crushing skulls

248
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and separating shoulders on the football field.

249
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
But Rosey Grier also had

250
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
another passion.

251
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
In his deeply authentic self,

252
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
he also loved needlepoint. (Laughter)

253
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
He loved knitting.

254
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
He said that it calmed him down, it relaxed him,

255
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
it took away his fear of flying and helped him meet chicks.

256
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
That's what he said.

257
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I mean, he loved it so much that, after he retired from the NFL,

258
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
he started joining clubs.

259
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And he even put out a book

260
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
called "Rosey Grier's Needlepoint for Men."

261
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
(Laughter)

262
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
(Applause)

263
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
It's a great cover.

264
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
If you notice, he's actually needlepointing his own face.

265
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
(Laughter)

266
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And so what I love about this story

267
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
is that Rosey Grier

268
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
is just such an authentic person,

269
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and that's what authenticity is all about.

270
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
It's just about being you and being cool with that.

271
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And I think when you're authentic,

272
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
you end up following your heart,

273
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and you put yourself in places

274
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and situations and in conversations

275
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
that you love and that you enjoy.

276
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
You meet people that you like talking to.

277
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
You go places you've dreamt about.

278
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And you end you end up following your heart

279
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and feeling very fulfilled.

280
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
So those are the three A's.

281
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
For the closing thought, I want to take you all the way back

282
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
to my parents coming to Canada.

283
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
I don't know what it would feel like

284
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
coming to a new country when you're in your mid-20s.

285
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
I don't know, because I never did it,

286
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
but I would imagine that it would take a great attitude.

287
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
I would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your surroundings

288
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and appreciating the small wonders

289
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
that you're starting to see in your new world.

290
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And I think you'd have to be really authentic,

291
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
you'd have to be really true to yourself

292
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
in order to get through what you're being exposed to.

293
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
I'd like to pause my TEDTalk

294
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
for about 10 seconds right now,

295
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
because you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this,

296
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and my parents are sitting in the front row.

297
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
So I wanted to ask them to, if they don't mind, stand up.

298
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And I just wanted to say thank you to you guys.

299
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
(Applause)

300
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
When I was growing up, my dad used to love telling the story

301
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
of his first day in Canada.

302
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And it's a great story, because what happened was

303
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
he got off the plane at the Toronto airport,

304
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and he was welcomed by a non-profit group,

305
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
which I'm sure someone in this room runs.

306
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
(Laughter)

307
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And this non-profit group had a big welcoming lunch

308
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
for all the new immigrants to Canada.

309
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And my dad says he got off the plane and he went to this lunch

310
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and there was this huge spread.

311
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
There was bread, there was those little, mini dill pickles,

312
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
there was olives, those little white onions.

313
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
There was rolled up turkey cold cuts,

314
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
rolled up ham cold cuts, rolled up roast beef cold cuts

315
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and little cubes of cheese.

316
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
There was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches

317
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and salmon salad sandwiches.

318
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
There was lasagna, there was casseroles,

319
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
there was brownies, there was butter tarts,

320
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and there was pies, lots and lots of pies.

321
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And when my dad tells the story, he says,

322
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
"The craziest thing was, I'd never seen any of that before, except bread.

323
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
(Laughter)

324
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
I didn't know what was meat, what was vegetarian.

325
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
I was eating olives with pie.

326
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
(Laughter)

327
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
I just couldn't believe how many things you can get here."

328
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
(Laughter)

329
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
When I was five years old,

330
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
my dad used to take me grocery shopping,

331
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and he would stare in wonder

332
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
at the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables.

333
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
He would say, "Look, can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico?

334
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
They've got an apple here from South Africa.

335
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Can you believe they've got a date from Morocco?"

336
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
He's like, "Do you know where Morocco even is?"

337
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And I'd say, "I'm five. I don't even know where I am.

338
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Is this A&P?"

339
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And he'd say, "I don't know where Morocco is either, but let's find out."

340
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
And so we'd buy the date, and we'd go home.

341
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf,

342
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
and we'd flip through until we found this mysterious country.

343
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
And when we did, my dad would say,

344
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
"Can you believe someone climbed a tree over there,

345
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
picked this thing off it, put it in a truck,

346
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
drove it all the way to the docks

347
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and then sailed it all the way

348
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
across the Atlantic Ocean

349
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and then put it in another truck

350
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house,

351
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
so they could sell it to us for 25 cents?"

352
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And I'd say, "I don't believe that."

353
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
And he's like, "I don't believe it either.

354
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Things are amazing. There's just so many things to be happy about."

355
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
When I stop to think about it, he's absolutely right.

356
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
There are so many things to be happy about.

357
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
We are the only species

358
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
on the only life-giving rock

359
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
in the entire universe that we've ever seen,

360
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
capable of experiencing

361
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
so many of these things.

362
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
I mean, we're the only ones with architecture and agriculture.

363
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
We're the only ones with jewelry and democracy.

364
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
We've got airplanes, highway lanes,

365
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
interior design and horoscope signs.

366
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
We've got fashion magazines, house party scenes.

367
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
You can watch a horror movie with monsters.

368
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
You can go to a concert and hear guitars jamming.

369
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
We've got books, buffets and radio waves,

370
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
wedding brides and rollercoaster rides.

371
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
You can sleep in clean sheets.

372
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
You can go to the movies and get good seats.

373
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
You can smell bakery air, walk around with rain hair,

374
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
pop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap.

375
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
We've got all that,

376
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
but we've only got 100 years to enjoy it.

377
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
And that's the sad part.

378
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
The cashiers at your grocery store,

379
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
the foreman at your plant,

380
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
the guy tailgating you home on the highway,

381
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
the telemarketer calling you during dinner,

382
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
every teacher you've ever had,

383
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
everyone that's ever woken up beside you,

384
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
every politician in every country,

385
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
every actor in every movie,

386
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
every single person in your family, everyone you love,

387
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
everyone in this room and you

388
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
will be dead in a hundred years.

389
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
Life is so great that we only get such a short time

390
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
to experience and enjoy

391
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet.

392
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
And that moment is right now,

393
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
and those moments are counting down,

394
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
and those moments are always, always, always fleeting.

395
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
You will never be as young as you are right now.

396
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
And that's why I believe that if you live your life

397
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
with a great attitude,

398
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
choosing to move forward and move on

399
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
whenever life deals you a blow,

400
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
living with a sense of awareness of the world around you,

401
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
embracing your inner three year-old

402
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
and seeing the tiny joys that make life so sweet

403
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
and being authentic to yourself,

404
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
being you and being cool with that,

405
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
letting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you,

406
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
then I think you'll live a life

407
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
that is rich and is satisfying,

408
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
and I think you'll live a life that is truly awesome.

409
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
Thank you.

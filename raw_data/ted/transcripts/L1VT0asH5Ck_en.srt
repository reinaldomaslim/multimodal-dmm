1
0:00:12.725,000 --> 0:00:15,000
On Tuesday, January 16, 1996,

2
0:00:17.737,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I walked into the office of the president

3
0:00:21.174,000 --> 0:00:24,000
as head of state of the Republic of Sierra Leone.

4
0:00:25.905,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I had not been elected.

5
0:00:28.906,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Four years earlier,

6
0:00:30.9,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I was one of 30 heavily armed military officers,

7
0:00:35.324,000 --> 0:00:36,000
all in our 20s,

8
0:00:37.212,000 --> 0:00:39,000
who had driven from the war front

9
0:00:39.611,000 --> 0:00:41,000
into the capital city, Freetown.

10
0:00:43.321,000 --> 0:00:44,000
We had only one objective:

11
0:00:46.57,000 --> 0:00:52,000
to overthrow a corrupt, repressive and single-party dictatorship

12
0:00:53.023,000 --> 0:00:57,000
that had kept itself in power for over 25 years.

13
0:00:58.43,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But in the end, it wasn't a violent coup.

14
0:01:02.854,000 --> 0:01:06,000
After we fired a few shots and seized the radio station,

15
0:01:07.79,000 --> 0:01:12,000
hundreds of thousands of citizens jumped onto the streets

16
0:01:14.662,000 --> 0:01:16,000
to welcome us as liberators.

17
0:01:18.891,000 --> 0:01:21,000
If you are thinking this seems like a movie script, I'm with you.

18
0:01:24.515,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I was part of the ruling military government,

19
0:01:26.672,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and I served in several roles.

20
0:01:29.279,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Our goal was always to return the country to democratic civilian rule.

21
0:01:35.597,000 --> 0:01:36,000
But after four years,

22
0:01:37.346,000 --> 0:01:41,000
those multiparty democratic elections had still not happened.

23
0:01:43.301,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Citizens were beginning to lose faith in our promise.

24
0:01:47.459,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But you know what?

25
0:01:48.665,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I like to keep my promises.

26
0:01:52.165,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Some of my comrades and I staged another military coup,

27
0:01:55.991,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and this time, against our own head of state and commander.

28
0:02:00.292,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Again, it was a bloodless coup.

29
0:02:03.512,000 --> 0:02:06,000
That is how I became the new military head of state

30
0:02:08.32,000 --> 0:02:11,000
on January 16, 1996.

31
0:02:12.284,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I was still only 31 years old.

32
0:02:15.262,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Of course, power was sweet.

33
0:02:17.588,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I felt invulnerable.

34
0:02:20.132,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I had thousands of heavily armed men

35
0:02:24.905,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and aircraft at my command.

36
0:02:27.905,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I was heavily protected,

37
0:02:30.187,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and I lived in luxury.

38
0:02:33.021,000 --> 0:02:37,000
But my obligations to my nation were always superior.

39
0:02:37.814,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Millions of fellow citizens were either displaced

40
0:02:41.623,000 --> 0:02:44,000
or fleeing the violence and pillage of war.

41
0:02:45.873,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So I engaged in a series of diplomatic activities

42
0:02:51.244,000 --> 0:02:53,000
right across the subregion

43
0:02:53.406,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and convinced the reclusive rebel leader to initiate peace talks

44
0:03:00.043,000 --> 0:03:01,000
for the very first time.

45
0:03:02.351,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I also called a national consultative conference

46
0:03:05.5,000 --> 0:03:08,000
of civil society organizations and stakeholders

47
0:03:09.122,000 --> 0:03:11,000
to advise on the best way forward.

48
0:03:13.546,000 --> 0:03:16,000
In both cases, I shared with them

49
0:03:16.664,000 --> 0:03:19,000
what I believed in then and now:

50
0:03:20.68,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that Sierra Leone is bigger than all of us,

51
0:03:24.999,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and that Sierra Leone must be a secure, peaceful and just society

52
0:03:31.842,000 --> 0:03:34,000
where every person can thrive

53
0:03:34.94,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and contribute to national development.

54
0:03:38.475,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And so, I initiated peace talks with the rebels.

55
0:03:42.898,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I organized the first multiparty democratic elections in nearly 30 years.

56
0:03:48.794,000 --> 0:03:53,000
(Applause)

57
0:03:54.902,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I handed over power

58
0:03:56.854,000 --> 0:03:58,000
to the newly elected president,

59
0:03:58.999,000 --> 0:04:,000
I retired from the army,

60
0:04:01.091,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and I left my country for the United States of America

61
0:04:04.701,000 --> 0:04:05,000
to study --

62
0:04:06.113,000 --> 0:04:07,000
all in three months.

63
0:04:08.523,000 --> 0:04:11,000
(Applause)

64
0:04:12.465,000 --> 0:04:13,000
In many a long walk,

65
0:04:14.962,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I wondered how we could get it right again as a nation.

66
0:04:21.756,000 --> 0:04:22,000
More than 20 years later,

67
0:04:23.673,000 --> 0:04:25,000
in April 2018,

68
0:04:26.359,000 --> 0:04:3,000
with a few more wrinkles and grey hair,

69
0:04:30.615,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I was again head of state.

70
0:04:33.317,000 --> 0:04:34,000
But guess what?

71
0:04:34.519,000 --> 0:04:36,000
This time I have been democratically elected.

72
0:04:37.876,000 --> 0:04:41,000
(Applause)

73
0:04:43.256,000 --> 0:04:45,000
At the polling stations last year,

74
0:04:45.783,000 --> 0:04:48,000
my three-year-old daughter, Amina, was in my arm.

75
0:04:50.591,000 --> 0:04:54,000
She insisted on holding on to my ballot paper with me.

76
0:04:56.298,000 --> 0:04:58,000
She was intent and focused.

77
0:04:59.98,000 --> 0:05:,000
At that moment,

78
0:05:01.767,000 --> 0:05:04,000
with my ballot papers in both our hands,

79
0:05:04.937,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I fully understood the one priority for me

80
0:05:08.638,000 --> 0:05:11,000
if I was elected president of the Republic of Sierra Leone;

81
0:05:13.195,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that is: How could I make the lives of Amina

82
0:05:16.898,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and millions of other young girls and boys

83
0:05:20.06,000 --> 0:05:21,000
better in our country?

84
0:05:24.256,000 --> 0:05:29,000
See, I believe that leadership is about creating possibilities that everyone,

85
0:05:30.114,000 --> 0:05:31,000
especially the young people,

86
0:05:31.895,000 --> 0:05:32,000
can believe in,

87
0:05:33.772,000 --> 0:05:34,000
own,

88
0:05:35.062,000 --> 0:05:36,000
work to actualize,

89
0:05:36.917,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and which they can actively fight to protect.

90
0:05:41.878,000 --> 0:05:43,000
The pathway to power and leadership

91
0:05:44.68,000 --> 0:05:45,000
can be littered with impediments,

92
0:05:46.701,000 --> 0:05:51,000
but more often, with funny questions that may seemingly defy answers:

93
0:05:53.355,000 --> 0:05:57,000
How does one take on the unique challenges of a country like Sierra Leone?

94
0:05:58.709,000 --> 0:06:01,000
We had mined mineral resources for over a hundred years,

95
0:06:01.971,000 --> 0:06:02,000
but we still are poor.

96
0:06:04.097,000 --> 0:06:08,000
We had collected foreign aid for 58 years, but we are still poor.

97
0:06:09.695,000 --> 0:06:14,000
The secret to economic development is in nature's best resource:

98
0:06:15.86,000 --> 0:06:19,000
skilled, healthy and productive human beings.

99
0:06:22.681,000 --> 0:06:26,000
The secret to changing our country lay in enhancing and supporting

100
0:06:27.233,000 --> 0:06:3,000
the limitless potential of the next generation

101
0:06:30.858,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and challenging them to change our country.

102
0:06:34.82,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Human capital development was the key to national development

103
0:06:39.764,000 --> 0:06:4,000
in Sierra Leone.

104
0:06:41.509,000 --> 0:06:42,000
As a candidate,

105
0:06:43.698,000 --> 0:06:46,000
I met with and listened to many young men and women

106
0:06:46.984,000 --> 0:06:47,000
right across the country

107
0:06:48.397,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and in the diaspora

108
0:06:50.78,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that were feeling disconnected from political leadership

109
0:06:54.227,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and cared little about the future of our country.

110
0:06:59.653,000 --> 0:07:,000
How could we engage them

111
0:07:01.503,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and make them believe that the answers to transforming our nation

112
0:07:05.194,000 --> 0:07:06,000
was right in their hands?

113
0:07:08.44,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Immediately after becoming president,

114
0:07:11.347,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I appointed some of Sierra Leone's brightest young people as leaders,

115
0:07:17.457,000 --> 0:07:2,000
with responsibility to realize our shared vision

116
0:07:21.125,000 --> 0:07:22,000
of transforming Sierra Leone.

117
0:07:23.907,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I am grateful many of them said yes.

118
0:07:28.404,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Let me give you a few examples.

119
0:07:31.496,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Corruption had been endemic in governance, institutions

120
0:07:35.079,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and in public life in Sierra Leone,

121
0:07:37.403,000 --> 0:07:39,000
undermining public trust

122
0:07:39.655,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and the country's international reputation.

123
0:07:43.218,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I appointed a young attorney as Commissioner

124
0:07:46.252,000 --> 0:07:48,000
for the Anti-Corruption Commission.

125
0:07:48.296,000 --> 0:07:49,000
In less than a year,

126
0:07:49.625,000 --> 0:07:51,000
he had a hundred percent conviction rate

127
0:07:52.309,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and recovered over 1.5 million dollars of stolen money.

128
0:07:58.366,000 --> 0:08:01,000
That is seed money for building the country's first-ever

129
0:08:02.027,000 --> 0:08:05,000
national medical diagnostic center in Sierra Leone.

130
0:08:06.87,000 --> 0:08:09,000
(Applause)

131
0:08:10.719,000 --> 0:08:14,000
The Millennium Challenge Corporation recently gave us a green scorecard

132
0:08:15.236,000 --> 0:08:17,000
for the Control of Corruption indicator,

133
0:08:17.955,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and multilateral development partners that had left Sierra Leone

134
0:08:21.726,000 --> 0:08:22,000
are now beginning to return.

135
0:08:24.376,000 --> 0:08:27,000
We are determined to break a culture of corruption

136
0:08:28.134,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and the culture of impunity

137
0:08:31.22,000 --> 0:08:32,000
that is associated with corruption.

138
0:08:34.207,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Before I became president,

139
0:08:37.396,000 --> 0:08:43,000
I met a skinny, dreadlocked MIT/Harvard-trained inventor

140
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
in London.

141
0:08:47.031,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Over coffee, I challenged him to think and plan along with me

142
0:08:53.636,000 --> 0:08:56,000
how innovation could help to drive national development

143
0:08:57.366,000 --> 0:09:01,000
in the areas of governance, revenue mobilization, health care,

144
0:09:01.866,000 --> 0:09:03,000
education, delivering public services

145
0:09:04.743,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and supporting private sector growth.

146
0:09:08.829,000 --> 0:09:11,000
How could Sierra Leone participate in the digital economy

147
0:09:12.036,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and become an innovation hub?

148
0:09:15.752,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Guess what?

149
0:09:16.927,000 --> 0:09:19,000
He left his cozy job at IBM,

150
0:09:20.002,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and he now leads a team of young men and women

151
0:09:23.275,000 --> 0:09:28,000
within the newly established Directorate of Science, Technology and Innovation

152
0:09:28.733,000 --> 0:09:29,000
in my own office.

153
0:09:30.974,000 --> 0:09:33,000
(Applause)

154
0:09:35.674,000 --> 0:09:36,000
That young man is right in here.

155
0:09:38.225,000 --> 0:09:41,000
I challenged another young Sierra Leonean woman

156
0:09:41.575,000 --> 0:09:45,000
to set up and lead the new Ministry of Planning and Economic Development.

157
0:09:46.812,000 --> 0:09:51,000
She consulted widely with Sierra Leoneans and produced, in record time,

158
0:09:52.533,000 --> 0:09:55,000
the medium-term national development plan,

159
0:09:55.694,000 --> 0:09:58,000
titled, "Education For Development."

160
0:10:00.117,000 --> 0:10:02,000
We now have our national development needs

161
0:10:02.535,000 --> 0:10:04,000
in easily understandable clusters,

162
0:10:05.364,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and we can now plan our budgets,

163
0:10:07.525,000 --> 0:10:09,000
align development partner contributions

164
0:10:10.006,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and measure our own progress.

165
0:10:13.632,000 --> 0:10:16,000
But the story of my government's flagship program

166
0:10:17.389,000 --> 0:10:18,000
is even more daring,

167
0:10:18.902,000 --> 0:10:19,000
if I can call it that.

168
0:10:21.232,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Today, three out of five adults in Sierra Leone cannot read or write.

169
0:10:29.582,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Thousands of children were not able to go to school

170
0:10:33.283,000 --> 0:10:34,000
or had dropped out of school

171
0:10:34.872,000 --> 0:10:39,000
because their parents could just not afford the $20 school fees per year.

172
0:10:42.51,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Women and girls, who constitute 51 percent of our population,

173
0:10:46.548,000 --> 0:10:49,000
were not given equal opportunity to be educated.

174
0:10:50.933,000 --> 0:10:54,000
So the obvious answer is to put in place free, quality education

175
0:10:55.106,000 --> 0:10:56,000
for every Sierra Leonean child,

176
0:10:57.023,000 --> 0:11:,000
regardless of gender, ability or ethnicity.

177
0:11:00.661,000 --> 0:11:06,000
(Applause)

178
0:11:07.167,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Great idea you've clapped for.

179
0:11:09.759,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Right?

180
0:11:10.935,000 --> 0:11:14,000
But the only problem is we had no money to start the program.

181
0:11:15.087,000 --> 0:11:16,000
(Laughter)

182
0:11:16.386,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Absolutely nothing.

183
0:11:19.853,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Development partners wanted to see data before associating with my vision.

184
0:11:25.057,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Of course, political opponents laughed at me.

185
0:11:29.304,000 --> 0:11:31,000
But I campaigned that a nation

186
0:11:31.335,000 --> 0:11:33,000
that invests in human capital development

187
0:11:34.244,000 --> 0:11:36,000
through free, quality education,

188
0:11:36.622,000 --> 0:11:39,000
affordable and high-quality health care services

189
0:11:39.9,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and food security

190
0:11:41.367,000 --> 0:11:45,000
will accelerate its national development program.

191
0:11:47.111,000 --> 0:11:5,000
I argued that for Sierra Leone to produce a highly skilled,

192
0:11:50.78,000 --> 0:11:52,000
innovative and productive workforce

193
0:11:53.631,000 --> 0:11:56,000
fit for the 21st century global economy,

194
0:11:57.089,000 --> 0:12:01,000
we needed to invest heavily in human capital development in Sierra Leone.

195
0:12:03.204,000 --> 0:12:04,000
But we had no money,

196
0:12:04.434,000 --> 0:12:08,000
because the previous government had virtually emptied the coffers.

197
0:12:10.794,000 --> 0:12:12,000
We clamped down on corruption,

198
0:12:14.112,000 --> 0:12:18,000
closed up the loopholes for fraud and waste,

199
0:12:18.271,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and we watched the money build up.

200
0:12:22.569,000 --> 0:12:25,000
We successfully launched a free, quality education program

201
0:12:26.059,000 --> 0:12:27,000
in August last year,

202
0:12:27.558,000 --> 0:12:29,000
four years, four months later.

203
0:12:30.396,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Today, two million children are going to school.

204
0:12:34.432,000 --> 0:12:39,000
(Applause)

205
0:12:40.732,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Twenty-one percent of the national budget

206
0:12:43.087,000 --> 0:12:45,000
supports free, quality education.

207
0:12:46.282,000 --> 0:12:5,000
In close collaboration and in partnership with development partners,

208
0:12:51.309,000 --> 0:12:54,000
we have now provided teaching and learning materials,

209
0:12:55.312,000 --> 0:12:57,000
safe spaces for girls,

210
0:12:57.338,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and started implementing school feeding programs

211
0:13:00.204,000 --> 0:13:01,000
across the entire country.

212
0:13:03.183,000 --> 0:13:07,000
We have even paid backlogs of salaries for teachers.

213
0:13:08.075,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Any girl admitted to university to study science, technology,

214
0:13:12.374,000 --> 0:13:16,000
engineering, mathematics and other related disciplines

215
0:13:16.502,000 --> 0:13:19,000
receives a full scholarship in Sierra Leone today.

216
0:13:20.155,000 --> 0:13:24,000
(Applause)

217
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And here is why this matters:

218
0:13:27.612,000 --> 0:13:3,000
in a few years, we will have a healthier, better educated

219
0:13:31.631,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and highly skilled young population

220
0:13:33.725,000 --> 0:13:36,000
that will lead and drive the country's national development.

221
0:13:38.115,000 --> 0:13:42,000
They will be well-equipped to deploy science, technology and innovation.

222
0:13:44.685,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Then we'll attract investment in diversified areas of our economy,

223
0:13:49.436,000 --> 0:13:5,000
from tourism to fisheries

224
0:13:51.236,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and from renewable energy to manufacturing.

225
0:13:56.438,000 --> 0:13:57,000
That is my biggest bet.

226
0:13:59.085,000 --> 0:14:03,000
In my mind, this is what leadership is all about:

227
0:14:04.659,000 --> 0:14:06,000
a mission to listen with empathy

228
0:14:08.442,000 --> 0:14:09,000
to the craziest of ideas,

229
0:14:11.237,000 --> 0:14:14,000
the hopes and aspirations of a younger generation,

230
0:14:14.594,000 --> 0:14:17,000
who are just looking for a chance to be better

231
0:14:18.434,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and to make our country better.

232
0:14:21.242,000 --> 0:14:23,000
It is about letting them know

233
0:14:24.223,000 --> 0:14:25,000
that their dreams matter.

234
0:14:26.665,000 --> 0:14:29,000
It is about standing with them and asking, "Why not?"

235
0:14:30.196,000 --> 0:14:33,000
when they ask seemingly impossible questions.

236
0:14:35.014,000 --> 0:14:38,000
It is about exploring, making

237
0:14:38.231,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and owning a shared vision.

238
0:14:42.118,000 --> 0:14:45,000
The most audacious and nation-changing events

239
0:14:45.905,000 --> 0:14:48,000
or policies or even personal choices

240
0:14:49.086,000 --> 0:14:51,000
happen when we ask, "Why not?"

241
0:14:51.893,000 --> 0:14:55,000
then make bold choices and ensure those bold choices happen.

242
0:14:59.701,000 --> 0:15:,000
I wake up every day believing

243
0:15:01.293,000 --> 0:15:06,000
that our country should no longer be defined by the stigma of the past.

244
0:15:07.255,000 --> 0:15:1,000
The future offers hope and opportunity for all.

245
0:15:12.047,000 --> 0:15:16,000
It matters to me that young men and women right across the country

246
0:15:16.851,000 --> 0:15:19,000
can imagine for themselves that they, too, can be and are

247
0:15:20.715,000 --> 0:15:22,000
part of the story of our nation.

248
0:15:23.961,000 --> 0:15:25,000
I want to challenge them to build a nation

249
0:15:26.887,000 --> 0:15:3,000
where three-year-olds like my daughter, Yie Amie,

250
0:15:31.818,000 --> 0:15:33,000
can grow up in good governance,

251
0:15:34.424,000 --> 0:15:35,000
quality education,

252
0:15:36.139,000 --> 0:15:37,000
health care

253
0:15:37.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and good infrastructure.

254
0:15:40.031,000 --> 0:15:43,000
I want our children to become young men and women

255
0:15:43.983,000 --> 0:15:47,000
who can continue nourishing the trees that will grow

256
0:15:48.684,000 --> 0:15:5,000
from the seeds that we are planting today.

257
0:15:52.507,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Now can someone tell me

258
0:15:54.592,000 --> 0:15:59,000
why we should not dare imagine that future in Sierra Leone?

259
0:16:02.921,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Thank you.

260
0:16:04.163,000 --> 0:16:1,000
(Applause)

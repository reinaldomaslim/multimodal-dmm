1
0:00:13.863,000 --> 0:00:16,000
What does it mean to spend our time well?

2
0:00:20.111,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I spend a lot of my time

3
0:00:22.463,000 --> 0:00:25,000
thinking about how to spend my time.

4
0:00:26.914,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Probably too much -- I probably obsess over it.

5
0:00:29.225,000 --> 0:00:3,000
My friends think I do.

6
0:00:30.694,000 --> 0:00:34,000
But I feel like I kind of have to, because these days,

7
0:00:35.205,000 --> 0:00:38,000
it feels like little bits of my time kind of slip away from me,

8
0:00:39.11,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and when that happens, it feels like parts of my life are slipping away.

9
0:00:45.086,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Specifically,

10
0:00:46.261,000 --> 0:00:48,000
it feels like little bits of my time get slipped away

11
0:00:49.134,000 --> 0:00:5,000
to various things like this,

12
0:00:50.762,000 --> 0:00:51,000
like technology -- I check things.

13
0:00:53.515,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I'll give you an example.

14
0:00:55.586,000 --> 0:00:56,000
If this email shows up --

15
0:00:57.601,000 --> 0:00:59,000
how many of you have gotten an email like this, right?

16
0:01:00.31,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I've been tagged in a photo.

17
0:01:03.684,000 --> 0:01:04,000
When this appears,

18
0:01:05.511,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I can't help but click on it right now.

19
0:01:08.946,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Right? Because, like, what if it's a bad photo?

20
0:01:11.511,000 --> 0:01:12,000
So I have to click it right now.

21
0:01:13.582,000 --> 0:01:15,000
But I'm not just going to click "See photo,"

22
0:01:16.053,000 --> 0:01:18,000
what I'm actually going to do is spend the next 20 minutes.

23
0:01:18.975,000 --> 0:01:19,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:20.176,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But the worst part is that I know this is what's going to happen,

25
0:01:24.237,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and even knowing that's what's going to happen

26
0:01:27.706,000 --> 0:01:29,000
doesn't stop me from doing it again the next time.

27
0:01:31.871,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Or I find myself in a situation like this,

28
0:01:36.097,000 --> 0:01:39,000
where I check my email and I pull down to refresh,

29
0:01:41.164,000 --> 0:01:44,000
But the thing is that 60 seconds later,

30
0:01:44.539,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I'll pull down to refresh again.

31
0:01:50.145,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Why am I doing this?

32
0:01:51.971,000 --> 0:01:52,000
This doesn't make any sense.

33
0:01:55.01,000 --> 0:01:58,000
But I'll give you a hint why this is happening.

34
0:02:00.357,000 --> 0:02:04,000
What do you think makes more money in the United States

35
0:02:05.547,000 --> 0:02:1,000
than movies, game parks and baseball combined?

36
0:02:13.742,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Slot machines.

37
0:02:17.195,000 --> 0:02:19,000
How can slot machines make all this money

38
0:02:20.799,000 --> 0:02:24,000
when we play with such small amounts of money?

39
0:02:26.022,000 --> 0:02:27,000
We play with coins.

40
0:02:27.704,000 --> 0:02:28,000
How is this possible?

41
0:02:30.137,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Well, the thing is ...

42
0:02:33.49,000 --> 0:02:36,000
my phone is a slot machine.

43
0:02:37.809,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Every time I check my phone,

44
0:02:39.821,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I'm playing the slot machine to see,

45
0:02:42.162,000 --> 0:02:43,000
what am I going to get?

46
0:02:43.925,000 --> 0:02:44,000
What am I going to get?

47
0:02:45.109,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Every time I check my email,

48
0:02:46.974,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I'm playing the slot machine,

49
0:02:48.45,000 --> 0:02:49,000
saying, "What am I going to get?"

50
0:02:50.085,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Every time I scroll a news feed,

51
0:02:53.334,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I'm playing the slot machine to see,

52
0:02:55.3,000 --> 0:02:56,000
what am I going to get next?

53
0:02:58.346,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And the thing is that,

54
0:02:59.521,000 --> 0:03:02,000
again, knowing exactly how this works -- and I'm a designer,

55
0:03:02.637,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I know exactly how the psychology of this works,

56
0:03:04.938,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I know exactly what's going on --

57
0:03:06.817,000 --> 0:03:08,000
but it doesn't leave me with any choice,

58
0:03:09.083,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I still just get sucked into it.

59
0:03:12.173,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So what are we going to do?

60
0:03:14.991,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Because it leaves us with this all-or-nothing relationship

61
0:03:18.036,000 --> 0:03:19,000
with technology, right?

62
0:03:20.478,000 --> 0:03:21,000
You're either on,

63
0:03:22.51,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and you're connected and distracted all the time,

64
0:03:24.909,000 --> 0:03:25,000
or you're off,

65
0:03:26.783,000 --> 0:03:27,000
but then you're wondering,

66
0:03:28.061,000 --> 0:03:29,000
am I missing something important?

67
0:03:30.352,000 --> 0:03:32,000
In other words, you're either distracted

68
0:03:33.443,000 --> 0:03:35,000
or you have fear of missing out.

69
0:03:36.363,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Right?

70
0:03:38.822,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So we need to restore choice.

71
0:03:43.942,000 --> 0:03:45,000
We want to have a relationship with technology

72
0:03:46.486,000 --> 0:03:5,000
that gives us back choice about how we spend time with it,

73
0:03:50.716,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and we're going to need help from designers,

74
0:03:54.662,000 --> 0:03:56,000
because knowing this stuff doesn't help.

75
0:03:57.491,000 --> 0:03:59,000
We're going to need design help.

76
0:03:59.567,000 --> 0:04:,000
So what would that look like?

77
0:04:02.656,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So let's take an example that we all face:

78
0:04:05.487,000 --> 0:04:07,000
chat -- text messaging.

79
0:04:08.089,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So let's say there's two people.

80
0:04:09.69,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Nancy's on the left and she's working on a document,

81
0:04:12.87,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and John's on the right.

82
0:04:14.669,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And John suddenly remembers,

83
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
"I need to ask Nancy for that document before I forget."

84
0:04:22.291,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So when he sends her that message,

85
0:04:23.982,000 --> 0:04:25,000
it blows away her attention.

86
0:04:27.436,000 --> 0:04:3,000
That's what we're doing all the time, bulldozing each other's attention,

87
0:04:30.868,000 --> 0:04:31,000
left and right.

88
0:04:32.306,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And there's serious cost to this,

89
0:04:34.534,000 --> 0:04:36,000
because every time we interrupt each other,

90
0:04:38.729,000 --> 0:04:41,000
it takes us about 23 minutes, on average,

91
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:43,000
to refocus our attention.

92
0:04:43.864,000 --> 0:04:46,000
We actually cycle through two different projects

93
0:04:47.236,000 --> 0:04:49,000
before we come back to the original thing we were doing.

94
0:04:50.806,000 --> 0:04:54,000
This is Gloria Mark's research combined with Microsoft research,

95
0:04:55.171,000 --> 0:04:56,000
that showed this.

96
0:04:56.553,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And her research also shows that it actually trains bad habits.

97
0:05:00.532,000 --> 0:05:02,000
The more interruptions we get externally,

98
0:05:03.482,000 --> 0:05:07,000
it's conditioning and training us to interrupt ourselves.

99
0:05:08.303,000 --> 0:05:11,000
We actually self-interrupt every three-and-a-half minutes.

100
0:05:13.176,000 --> 0:05:14,000
This is crazy.

101
0:05:14.351,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So how do we fix this?

102
0:05:15.676,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Because Nancy and John are in this all-or-nothing relationship.

103
0:05:18.95,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Nancy might want to disconnect,

104
0:05:20.475,000 --> 0:05:21,000
but then she'd be worried:

105
0:05:21.852,000 --> 0:05:23,000
What if I'm missing something important?

106
0:05:24.296,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Design can fix this problem.

107
0:05:27.311,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Let's say you have Nancy again on the left,

108
0:05:29.368,000 --> 0:05:3,000
John on the right.

109
0:05:30.564,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And John remembers, "I need to send Nancy that document."

110
0:05:33.279,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Except this time,

111
0:05:34.532,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Nancy can mark that she's focused.

112
0:05:36.493,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Let's say she drags a slider and says,

113
0:05:38.485,000 --> 0:05:39,000
"I want to be focused for 30 minutes,"

114
0:05:40.432,000 --> 0:05:41,000
so -- bam -- she's focused.

115
0:05:42.771,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Now when John wants to message her,

116
0:05:45.415,000 --> 0:05:47,000
he can get the thought off of his mind --

117
0:05:47.566,000 --> 0:05:49,000
because he has a need, he has this thought,

118
0:05:49.663,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and he needs to dump it out before he forgets.

119
0:05:52.744,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Except this time,

120
0:05:54.29,000 --> 0:05:58,000
it holds the messages so that Nancy can still focus,

121
0:05:58.618,000 --> 0:06:,000
but John can get the thought off of his mind.

122
0:06:02.875,000 --> 0:06:05,000
But this only works if one last thing is true,

123
0:06:06.098,000 --> 0:06:1,000
which is that Nancy needs to know that if something is truly important,

124
0:06:11.564,000 --> 0:06:12,000
John can still interrupt.

125
0:06:16.158,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But instead of having constant accidental or mindless interruptions,

126
0:06:20.295,000 --> 0:06:22,000
we're now only creating conscious interruptions,

127
0:06:24.985,000 --> 0:06:25,000
So we're doing two things here.

128
0:06:26.53,000 --> 0:06:29,000
We're creating a new choice for both Nancy and John,

129
0:06:30.436,000 --> 0:06:32,000
But there's a second, subtle thing we're doing here, too.

130
0:06:34.022,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And it's that we're changing the question we're answering.

131
0:06:37.922,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Instead of the goal of chat being:

132
0:06:42.056,000 --> 0:06:45,000
"Let's design it so it's easy to send a message" --

133
0:06:45.277,000 --> 0:06:46,000
that's the goal of chat,

134
0:06:46.731,000 --> 0:06:48,000
it should be really easy to send a message to someone --

135
0:06:49.808,000 --> 0:06:52,000
we change the goal to something deeper and a human value,

136
0:06:52.912,000 --> 0:06:56,000
which is: "Let's create the highest possible quality communication

137
0:06:57.14,000 --> 0:06:59,000
in a relationship between two people.

138
0:07:00.162,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So we upgraded the goal.

139
0:07:03.832,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Now, do designers actually care about this?

140
0:07:06.667,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Do we want to have conversations about what these deeper human goals are?

141
0:07:12.538,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Well, I'll tell you one story.

142
0:07:14.321,000 --> 0:07:17,000
A little over a year ago,

143
0:07:17.415,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I got to help organize a meeting

144
0:07:20.519,000 --> 0:07:24,000
between some of technology's leading designers and Thich Nhat Hanh.

145
0:07:26.297,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Thich Nhat Hanh is an international spokesperson for mindfulness meditation.

146
0:07:31.158,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And it was the most amazing meeting.

147
0:07:32.933,000 --> 0:07:34,000
You have to imagine -- picture a room --

148
0:07:34.977,000 --> 0:07:37,000
on one side of the room, you have a bunch of tech geeks;

149
0:07:38.854,000 --> 0:07:39,000
on the other side of the room,

150
0:07:40.374,000 --> 0:07:44,000
you have a bunch of long brown robes, shaved heads, Buddhist monks.

151
0:07:46.442,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And the questions were about the deepest human values,

152
0:07:49.697,000 --> 0:07:51,000
like what does the future of technology look like

153
0:07:52.039,000 --> 0:07:54,000
when you're designing for the deepest questions

154
0:07:54.278,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and the deepest human values?

155
0:07:56.445,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And our conversation centered on listening more deeply

156
0:08:00.159,000 --> 0:08:01,000
to what those values might be.

157
0:08:02.929,000 --> 0:08:03,000
He joked in our conversation

158
0:08:04.66,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that what if, instead of a spell check,

159
0:08:07.551,000 --> 0:08:09,000
you had a compassion check,

160
0:08:09.606,000 --> 0:08:13,000
meaning, you might highlight a word that might be accidentally abrasive --

161
0:08:13.993,000 --> 0:08:14,000
perceived as abrasive by someone else.

162
0:08:16.844,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So does this kind of conversation happen in the real world,

163
0:08:20.839,000 --> 0:08:22,000
not just in these design meetings?

164
0:08:23.917,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Well, the answer is yes,

165
0:08:25.116,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and one of my favorites is Couchsurfing.

166
0:08:28.413,000 --> 0:08:3,000
If you didn't know, Couchsurfing is a website

167
0:08:30.89,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that matches people who are looking for a place to stay

168
0:08:34.799,000 --> 0:08:36,000
with a free couch, from someone who's trying to offer it.

169
0:08:38.185,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So, great service --

170
0:08:39.752,000 --> 0:08:4,000
what would their design goal be?

171
0:08:41.44,000 --> 0:08:43,000
What are you designing for if you work at Couchsurfing?

172
0:08:44.211,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Well, you would think it's to match guests with hosts.

173
0:08:49.589,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Right?

174
0:08:50.763,000 --> 0:08:51,000
That's a pretty good goal.

175
0:08:52.042,000 --> 0:08:54,000
But that would kind of be like our goal with messaging before,

176
0:08:54.985,000 --> 0:08:56,000
where we're just trying to deliver a message.

177
0:08:57.374,000 --> 0:08:59,000
So what's the deeper, human goal?

178
0:09:00.175,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Well, they set their goal

179
0:09:02.144,000 --> 0:09:07,000
as the need to create lasting, positive experiences and relationships

180
0:09:07.822,000 --> 0:09:09,000
between people who've never met before.

181
0:09:11.343,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And the most amazing thing about this was in 2007,

182
0:09:13.95,000 --> 0:09:15,000
they introduced a way to measure this,

183
0:09:16.615,000 --> 0:09:17,000
which is incredible.

184
0:09:18.09,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I'll tell you how it works.

185
0:09:19.421,000 --> 0:09:2,000
For every design goal you have,

186
0:09:20.992,000 --> 0:09:22,000
you have to have a corresponding measurement

187
0:09:23.084,000 --> 0:09:24,000
to know how you're doing --

188
0:09:24.657,000 --> 0:09:25,000
a way of measuring success.

189
0:09:26.016,000 --> 0:09:27,000
So what they do is,

190
0:09:27.336,000 --> 0:09:29,000
let's say you take two people who meet up,

191
0:09:32.12,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and they take the number of days those two people spent together,

192
0:09:37.01,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and then they estimate how many hours were in those days --

193
0:09:41.136,000 --> 0:09:43,000
how many hours did those two people spend together?

194
0:09:43.977,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And then after they spend that time together,

195
0:09:46.136,000 --> 0:09:47,000
they ask both of them:

196
0:09:47.35,000 --> 0:09:48,000
How positive was your experience?

197
0:09:49.332,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Did you have a good experience with this person that you met?

198
0:09:52.952,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And they subtract from those positive hours

199
0:09:56.346,000 --> 0:09:59,000
the amount of time people spent on the website,

200
0:10:00.425,000 --> 0:10:02,000
because that's a cost to people's lives.

201
0:10:03.661,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Why should we value that as success?

202
0:10:06.066,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And what you were left with

203
0:10:07.546,000 --> 0:10:11,000
is something they refer to as "net orchestrated conviviality,"

204
0:10:12.311,000 --> 0:10:14,000
or, really, just a net "Good Times" created.

205
0:10:15.017,000 --> 0:10:2,000
The net hours that would have never existed, had Couchsurfing not existed.

206
0:10:20.799,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Can you imagine how inspiring it would be to come to work every day

207
0:10:24.783,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and measure your success

208
0:10:26.3,000 --> 0:10:31,000
in the actual net new contribution of hours in people's lives

209
0:10:31.353,000 --> 0:10:33,000
that are positive, that would have never existed

210
0:10:33.978,000 --> 0:10:35,000
if you didn't do what you were about to do at work today?

211
0:10:37.692,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Can you imagine a whole world that worked this way?

212
0:10:43.564,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Can you imagine a social network that --

213
0:10:46.343,000 --> 0:10:47,000
let's say you care about cooking,

214
0:10:47.95,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and it measured its success in terms of cooking nights organized

215
0:10:51.005,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and the cooking articles that you were glad you read,

216
0:10:53.994,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and subtracted from that the articles you weren't glad you read

217
0:10:56.995,000 --> 0:10:58,000
or the time you spent scrolling that you didn't like?

218
0:11:00.009,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Imagine a professional social network

219
0:11:03.529,000 --> 0:11:06,000
that, instead of measuring its success in terms of connections created

220
0:11:07.468,000 --> 0:11:08,000
or messages sent,

221
0:11:09.081,000 --> 0:11:13,000
instead measured its success in terms of the job offers that people got

222
0:11:13.417,000 --> 0:11:14,000
that they were excited to get.

223
0:11:16.281,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And subtracted the amount of time people spent on the website.

224
0:11:20.643,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Or imagine dating services,

225
0:11:23.702,000 --> 0:11:24,000
like maybe Tinder or something,

226
0:11:25.464,000 --> 0:11:28,000
where instead of measuring the number of swipes left and right people did,

227
0:11:28.966,000 --> 0:11:3,000
which is how they measure success today,

228
0:11:31.074,000 --> 0:11:37,000
instead measured the deep, romantic, fulfilling connections people created.

229
0:11:38.613,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Whatever that was for them, by the way.

230
0:11:43.886,000 --> 0:11:46,000
But can you imagine a whole world that worked this way,

231
0:11:47.138,000 --> 0:11:49,000
that was helping you spend your time well?

232
0:11:51.009,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Now to do this you also need a new system,

233
0:11:53.062,000 --> 0:11:54,000
because you're probably thinking,

234
0:11:54.764,000 --> 0:11:55,000
today's Internet economy --

235
0:11:56.343,000 --> 0:11:57,000
today's economy in general --

236
0:11:57.8,000 --> 0:11:58,000
is measured in time spent.

237
0:11:59.094,000 --> 0:12:01,000
The more users you have,

238
0:12:01.165,000 --> 0:12:02,000
the more usage you have,

239
0:12:02.567,000 --> 0:12:03,000
the more time people spend,

240
0:12:03.909,000 --> 0:12:04,000
that's how we measure success.

241
0:12:06.419,000 --> 0:12:07,000
But we've solved this problem before.

242
0:12:09.335,000 --> 0:12:11,000
We solved it with organic,

243
0:12:11.925,000 --> 0:12:13,000
when we said we need to value things a different way.

244
0:12:14.883,000 --> 0:12:16,000
We said this is a different kind of food.

245
0:12:19.067,000 --> 0:12:21,000
So we can't compare it just based on price;

246
0:12:21.14,000 --> 0:12:22,000
this is a different category of food.

247
0:12:23.004,000 --> 0:12:25,000
We solved it with Leed Certification,

248
0:12:25.761,000 --> 0:12:28,000
where we said this is a different kind of building

249
0:12:29.232,000 --> 0:12:33,000
that stood for different values of environmental sustainability.

250
0:12:34.5,000 --> 0:12:38,000
What if we had something like that for technology?

251
0:12:39.772,000 --> 0:12:44,000
What if we had something whose entire purpose and goal

252
0:12:44.993,000 --> 0:12:48,000
was to help create net new positive contributions to human life?

253
0:12:50.971,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And what if we could value it a different way,

254
0:12:54.35,000 --> 0:12:55,000
so it would actually work?

255
0:12:56.634,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Imagine you gave this different premium shelf space on app stores.

256
0:13:00.589,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Imagine you had web browsers that helped route you

257
0:13:02.948,000 --> 0:13:04,000
to these kinds of design products.

258
0:13:07.475,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Can you imagine how exciting it would be to live and create that world?

259
0:13:13.211,000 --> 0:13:15,000
We can create this world today.

260
0:13:16.978,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Company leaders, all you have to do --

261
0:13:19.774,000 --> 0:13:21,000
only you can prioritize a new metric,

262
0:13:23.146,000 --> 0:13:27,000
which is your metric for net positive contribution to human life.

263
0:13:27.573,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And have an honest conversation about that.

264
0:13:29.648,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Maybe you're not doing so well to start with,

265
0:13:31.833,000 --> 0:13:32,000
but let's start that conversation.

266
0:13:35.035,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Designers, you can redefine success; you can redefine design.

267
0:13:40.754,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Arguably, you have more power than many people in your organization

268
0:13:44.711,000 --> 0:13:46,000
to create the choices that all of us live by.

269
0:13:48.311,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Maybe like in medicine,

270
0:13:49.736,000 --> 0:13:5,000
where we have a Hippocratic oath

271
0:13:51.618,000 --> 0:13:55,000
to recognize the responsibility and this higher value

272
0:13:55.764,000 --> 0:13:56,000
that we have to treat patients.

273
0:13:57.355,000 --> 0:13:59,000
What if designers had something like that,

274
0:13:59.419,000 --> 0:14:,000
in terms of this new kind of design?

275
0:14:02.668,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And users, for all of us --

276
0:14:04.697,000 --> 0:14:07,000
we can demand technology that works this way.

277
0:14:09.176,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Now it may seem hard,

278
0:14:10.867,000 --> 0:14:14,000
but McDonald's didn't have salads until the consumer demand was there.

279
0:14:16.529,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Walmart didn't have organic food until the consumer demand was there.

280
0:14:20.746,000 --> 0:14:24,000
We have to demand this new kind of technology.

281
0:14:26.194,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And we can do that.

282
0:14:28.092,000 --> 0:14:29,000
And doing that

283
0:14:29.628,000 --> 0:14:32,000
would amount to shifting from a world that's driven and run

284
0:14:33.169,000 --> 0:14:35,000
entirely on time spent,

285
0:14:37.151,000 --> 0:14:41,000
to world that's driven by time well spent.

286
0:14:43.569,000 --> 0:14:45,000
I want to live in this world,

287
0:14:45.68,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and I want this conversation to happen.

288
0:14:48.586,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Let's start that conversation now.

289
0:14:51.707,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Thank you.

290
0:14:52.882,000 --> 0:14:53,000
(Applause)

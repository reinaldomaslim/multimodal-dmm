1
0:00:12.717,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I'd like to take you on the epic quest of the Rosetta spacecraft.

2
0:00:17.514,000 --> 0:00:21,000
To escort and land the probe on a comet,

3
0:00:21.54,000 --> 0:00:24,000
this has been my passion for the past two years.

4
0:00:25.45,000 --> 0:00:26,000
In order to do that,

5
0:00:26.545,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I need to explain to you something about the origin of the solar system.

6
0:00:30.015,000 --> 0:00:32,000
When we go back four and a half billion years,

7
0:00:32.238,000 --> 0:00:33,000
there was a cloud of gas and dust.

8
0:00:33.957,000 --> 0:00:37,000
In the center of this cloud, our sun formed and ignited.

9
0:00:38.484,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Along with that, what we now know as planets, comets and asteroids formed.

10
0:00:44.195,000 --> 0:00:47,000
What then happened, according to theory,

11
0:00:47.608,000 --> 0:00:51,000
is that when the Earth had cooled down a bit after its formation,

12
0:00:51.625,000 --> 0:00:55,000
comets massively impacted the Earth and delivered water to Earth.

13
0:00:57.082,000 --> 0:01:01,000
They probably also delivered complex organic material to Earth,

14
0:01:01.516,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and that may have bootstrapped the emergence of life.

15
0:01:04.906,000 --> 0:01:07,000
You can compare this to having to solve a 250-piece puzzle

16
0:01:08.366,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and not a 2,000-piece puzzle.

17
0:01:11.57,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Afterwards, the big planets like Jupiter and Saturn,

18
0:01:15.053,000 --> 0:01:17,000
they were not in their place where they are now,

19
0:01:17.631,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and they interacted gravitationally,

20
0:01:20.278,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and they swept the whole interior of the solar system clean,

21
0:01:23.83,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and what we now know as comets

22
0:01:25.432,000 --> 0:01:27,000
ended up in something called the Kuiper Belt,

23
0:01:27.545,000 --> 0:01:3,000
which is a belt of objects beyond the orbit of Neptune.

24
0:01:31.213,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And sometimes these objects run into each other,

25
0:01:34.906,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and they gravitationally deflect,

26
0:01:37.971,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and then the gravity of Jupiter pulls them back into the solar system.

27
0:01:42.428,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And they then become the comets as we see them in the sky.

28
0:01:46.12,000 --> 0:01:49,000
The important thing here to note is that in the meantime,

29
0:01:49.394,000 --> 0:01:51,000
the four and a half billion years,

30
0:01:51.693,000 --> 0:01:54,000
these comets have been sitting on the outside of the solar system,

31
0:01:54.875,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and haven't changed --

32
0:01:56.29,000 --> 0:01:58,000
deep, frozen versions of our solar system.

33
0:01:59.193,000 --> 0:02:01,000
In the sky, they look like this.

34
0:02:01.282,000 --> 0:02:02,000
We know them for their tails.

35
0:02:03.233,000 --> 0:02:04,000
There are actually two tails.

36
0:02:04.904,000 --> 0:02:07,000
One is a dust tail, which is blown away by the solar wind.

37
0:02:08.759,000 --> 0:02:11,000
The other one is an ion tail, which is charged particles,

38
0:02:12.404,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and they follow the magnetic field in the solar system.

39
0:02:15.143,000 --> 0:02:16,000
There's the coma,

40
0:02:16.292,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and then there is the nucleus, which here is too small to see,

41
0:02:19.199,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and you have to remember that in the case of Rosetta,

42
0:02:21.689,000 --> 0:02:23,000
the spacecraft is in that center pixel.

43
0:02:23.866,000 --> 0:02:27,000
We are only 20, 30, 40 kilometers away from the comet.

44
0:02:27.976,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So what's important to remember?

45
0:02:30.297,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Comets contain the original material from which our solar system was formed,

46
0:02:35.166,000 --> 0:02:37,000
so they're ideal to study the components

47
0:02:37.526,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that were present at the time when Earth, and life, started.

48
0:02:41.791,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Comets are also suspected

49
0:02:43.673,000 --> 0:02:47,000
of having brought the elements which may have bootstrapped life.

50
0:02:47.944,000 --> 0:02:51,000
In 1983, ESA set up its long-term Horizon 2000 program,

51
0:02:52.309,000 --> 0:02:55,000
which contained one cornerstone, which would be a mission to a comet.

52
0:02:56.233,000 --> 0:03:,000
In parallel, a small mission to a comet, what you see here, Giotto, was launched,

53
0:03:01.123,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and in 1986, flew by the comet of Halley with an armada of other spacecraft.

54
0:03:07.329,000 --> 0:03:1,000
From the results of that mission, it became immediately clear

55
0:03:10.9,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that comets were ideal bodies to study to understand our solar system.

56
0:03:16.087,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And thus, the Rosetta mission was approved in 1993,

57
0:03:20.599,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and originally it was supposed to be launched in 2003,

58
0:03:24.234,000 --> 0:03:26,000
but a problem arose with an Ariane rocket.

59
0:03:26.858,000 --> 0:03:29,000
However, our P.R. department, in its enthusiasm,

60
0:03:29.923,000 --> 0:03:31,000
had already made 1,000 Delft Blue plates

61
0:03:32.145,000 --> 0:03:34,000
with the name of the wrong comets.

62
0:03:34.535,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So I've never had to buy any china since. That's the positive part.

63
0:03:38.102,000 --> 0:03:39,000
(Laughter)

64
0:03:39.821,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Once the whole problem was solved,

65
0:03:41.701,000 --> 0:03:44,000
we left Earth in 2004

66
0:03:44.882,000 --> 0:03:47,000
to the newly selected comet, Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

67
0:03:47.97,000 --> 0:03:49,000
This comet had to be specially selected

68
0:03:50.826,000 --> 0:03:52,000
because A, you have to be able to get to it,

69
0:03:53.48,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and B, it shouldn't have been in the solar system too long.

70
0:03:56.261,000 --> 0:03:59,000
This particular comet has been in the solar system since 1959.

71
0:04:00.208,000 --> 0:04:03,000
That's the first time when it was deflected by Jupiter,

72
0:04:03.523,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and it got close enough to the sun to start changing.

73
0:04:06.5,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So it's a very fresh comet.

74
0:04:08.611,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Rosetta made a few historic firsts.

75
0:04:11.502,000 --> 0:04:13,000
It's the first satellite to orbit a comet,

76
0:04:14.018,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and to escort it throughout its whole tour through the solar system --

77
0:04:17.64,000 --> 0:04:2,000
closest approach to the sun, as we will see in August,

78
0:04:20.938,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and then away again to the exterior.

79
0:04:23.259,000 --> 0:04:25,000
It's the first ever landing on a comet.

80
0:04:25.86,000 --> 0:04:28,000
We actually orbit the comet using something which is not

81
0:04:29.552,000 --> 0:04:3,000
normally done with spacecraft.

82
0:04:31.001,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Normally, you look at the sky and you know where you point and where you are.

83
0:04:34.636,000 --> 0:04:36,000
In this case, that's not enough.

84
0:04:36.772,000 --> 0:04:39,000
We navigated by looking at landmarks on the comet.

85
0:04:40.07,000 --> 0:04:42,000
We recognized features -- boulders, craters --

86
0:04:42.545,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and that's how we know where we are respective to the comet.

87
0:04:46.562,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And, of course, it's the first satellite to go beyond the orbit of Jupiter

88
0:04:51.091,000 --> 0:04:52,000
on solar cells.

89
0:04:52.292,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Now, this sounds more heroic than it actually is,

90
0:04:54.619,000 --> 0:04:59,000
because the technology to use radio isotope thermal generators

91
0:04:59.715,000 --> 0:05:02,000
wasn't available in Europe at that time, so there was no choice.

92
0:05:03.013,000 --> 0:05:04,000
But these solar arrays are big.

93
0:05:04.59,000 --> 0:05:07,000
This is one wing, and these are not specially selected small people.

94
0:05:07.865,000 --> 0:05:08,000
They're just like you and me.

95
0:05:09.699,000 --> 0:05:11,000
(Laughter)

96
0:05:12.09,000 --> 0:05:16,000
We have two of these wings, 65 square meters.

97
0:05:16.291,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Now later on, of course, when we got to the comet,

98
0:05:19.31,000 --> 0:05:22,000
you find out that 65 square meters of sail

99
0:05:22.839,000 --> 0:05:27,000
close to a body which is outgassing is not always a very handy choice.

100
0:05:28.481,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Now, how did we get to the comet?

101
0:05:30.525,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Because we had to go there for the Rosetta scientific objectives

102
0:05:34.193,000 --> 0:05:37,000
very far away -- four times the distance of the Earth to the sun --

103
0:05:38.001,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and also at a much higher velocity than we could achieve with fuel,

104
0:05:42.111,000 --> 0:05:46,000
because we'd have to take six times as much fuel as the whole spacecraft weighed.

105
0:05:46.43,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So what do you do?

106
0:05:47.84,000 --> 0:05:5,000
You use gravitational flybys, slingshots,

107
0:05:51.323,000 --> 0:05:54,000
where you pass by a planet at very low altitude,

108
0:05:54.69,000 --> 0:05:55,000
a few thousand kilometers,

109
0:05:56.455,000 --> 0:06:,000
and then you get the velocity of that planet around the sun for free.

110
0:06:01.168,000 --> 0:06:03,000
We did that a few times.

111
0:06:03.211,000 --> 0:06:05,000
We did Earth, we did Mars, we did twice Earth again,

112
0:06:05.69,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and we also flew by two asteroids, Lutetia and Steins.

113
0:06:10.318,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Then in 2011, we got so far from the sun that if the spacecraft got into trouble,

114
0:06:14.983,000 --> 0:06:17,000
we couldn't actually save the spacecraft anymore,

115
0:06:18.792,000 --> 0:06:19,000
so we went into hibernation.

116
0:06:20.765,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Everything was switched off except for one clock.

117
0:06:24.103,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Here you see in white the trajectory, and the way this works.

118
0:06:27.614,000 --> 0:06:29,000
You see that from the circle where we started,

119
0:06:30.057,000 --> 0:06:33,000
the white line, actually you get more and more and more elliptical,

120
0:06:33.873,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and then finally we approached the comet

121
0:06:36.822,000 --> 0:06:4,000
in May 2014, and we had to start doing the rendezvous maneuvers.

122
0:06:41.187,000 --> 0:06:45,000
On the way there, we flew by Earth and we took a few pictures to test our cameras.

123
0:06:45.784,000 --> 0:06:47,000
This is the moon rising over Earth,

124
0:06:47.962,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and this is what we now call a selfie,

125
0:06:49.917,000 --> 0:06:52,000
which at that time, by the way, that word didn't exist. (Laughter)

126
0:06:53.609,000 --> 0:06:55,000
It's at Mars. It was taken by the CIVA camera.

127
0:06:56.58,000 --> 0:06:58,000
That's one of the cameras on the lander,

128
0:06:58.762,000 --> 0:07:,000
and it just looks under the solar arrays,

129
0:07:01.177,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and you see the planet Mars and the solar array in the distance.

130
0:07:05.45,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Now, when we got out of hibernation in January 2014,

131
0:07:11.118,000 --> 0:07:12,000
we started arriving at a distance

132
0:07:12.903,000 --> 0:07:14,000
of two million kilometers from the comet in May.

133
0:07:15.736,000 --> 0:07:19,000
However, the velocity the spacecraft had was much too fast.

134
0:07:19.845,000 --> 0:07:25,000
We were going 2,800 kilometers an hour faster than the comet, so we had to brake.

135
0:07:25.906,000 --> 0:07:26,000
We had to do eight maneuvers,

136
0:07:27.763,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and you see here, some of them were really big.

137
0:07:30.34,000 --> 0:07:36,000
We had to brake the first one by a few hundred kilometers per hour,

138
0:07:36.364,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and actually, the duration of that was seven hours,

139
0:07:40.674,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and it used 218 kilos of fuel,

140
0:07:43.622,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and those were seven nerve-wracking hours, because in 2007,

141
0:07:47.572,000 --> 0:07:5,000
there was a leak in the system of the propulsion of Rosetta,

142
0:07:50.762,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and we had to close off a branch,

143
0:07:52.909,000 --> 0:07:54,000
so the system was actually operating at a pressure

144
0:07:55.487,000 --> 0:07:58,000
which it was never designed or qualified for.

145
0:07:59.795,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Then we got in the vicinity of the comet, and these were the first pictures we saw.

146
0:08:04.704,000 --> 0:08:06,000
The true comet rotation period is 12 and a half hours,

147
0:08:07.277,000 --> 0:08:09,000
so this is accelerated,

148
0:08:09.366,000 --> 0:08:12,000
but you will understand that our flight dynamics engineers thought,

149
0:08:12.617,000 --> 0:08:15,000
this is not going to be an easy thing to land on.

150
0:08:16.471,000 --> 0:08:2,000
We had hoped for some kind of spud-like thing

151
0:08:21.115,000 --> 0:08:23,000
where you could easily land.

152
0:08:23.281,000 --> 0:08:26,000
But we had one hope: maybe it was smooth.

153
0:08:26.572,000 --> 0:08:29,000
No. That didn't work either. (Laughter)

154
0:08:30.31,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So at that point in time, it was clearly unavoidable:

155
0:08:33.003,000 --> 0:08:36,000
we had to map this body in all the detail you could get,

156
0:08:36.534,000 --> 0:08:41,000
because we had to find an area which is 500 meters in diameter and flat.

157
0:08:41.687,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Why 500 meters? That's the error we have on landing the probe.

158
0:08:46.286,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So we went through this process, and we mapped the comet.

159
0:08:49.467,000 --> 0:08:51,000
We used a technique called photoclinometry.

160
0:08:51.834,000 --> 0:08:53,000
You use shadows thrown by the sun.

161
0:08:54.064,000 --> 0:08:57,000
What you see here is a rock sitting on the surface of the comet,

162
0:08:57.151,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and the sun shines from above.

163
0:09:00.077,000 --> 0:09:02,000
From the shadow, we, with our brain,

164
0:09:02.236,000 --> 0:09:05,000
can immediately determine roughly what the shape of that rock is.

165
0:09:05.88,000 --> 0:09:07,000
You can program that in a computer,

166
0:09:07.922,000 --> 0:09:11,000
you then cover the whole comet, and you can map the comet.

167
0:09:12.176,000 --> 0:09:15,000
For that, we flew special trajectories starting in August.

168
0:09:15.856,000 --> 0:09:17,000
First, a triangle of 100 kilometers on a side

169
0:09:18.765,000 --> 0:09:19,000
at 100 kilometers' distance,

170
0:09:20.428,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and we repeated the whole thing at 50 kilometers.

171
0:09:23.432,000 --> 0:09:26,000
At that time, we had seen the comet at all kinds of angles,

172
0:09:27.079,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and we could use this technique to map the whole thing.

173
0:09:31.752,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Now, this led to a selection of landing sites.

174
0:09:35.019,000 --> 0:09:39,000
This whole process we had to do, to go from the mapping of the comet

175
0:09:39.279,000 --> 0:09:42,000
to actually finding the final landing site, was 60 days.

176
0:09:42.844,000 --> 0:09:43,000
We didn't have more.

177
0:09:44.23,000 --> 0:09:46,000
To give you an idea, the average Mars mission

178
0:09:46.35,000 --> 0:09:49,000
takes hundreds of scientists for years to meet

179
0:09:50.134,000 --> 0:09:52,000
about where shall we go?

180
0:09:52.201,000 --> 0:09:54,000
We had 60 days, and that was it.

181
0:09:54.359,000 --> 0:09:57,000
We finally selected the final landing site

182
0:09:57.402,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and the commands were prepared for Rosetta to launch Philae.

183
0:10:02.455,000 --> 0:10:06,000
The way this works is that Rosetta has to be at the right point in space,

184
0:10:06.83,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and aiming towards the comet, because the lander is passive.

185
0:10:09.653,000 --> 0:10:12,000
The lander is then pushed out and moves towards the comet.

186
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Rosetta had to turn around

187
0:10:15.12,000 --> 0:10:19,000
to get its cameras to actually look at Philae while it was departing

188
0:10:19.677,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and to be able to communicate with it.

189
0:10:22.146,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Now, the landing duration of the whole trajectory was seven hours.

190
0:10:26.72,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Now do a simple calculation:

191
0:10:29.507,000 --> 0:10:33,000
if the velocity of Rosetta is off by one centimeter per second,

192
0:10:33.546,000 --> 0:10:37,000
seven hours is 25,000 seconds.

193
0:10:37.888,000 --> 0:10:41,000
That means 252 meters wrong on the comet.

194
0:10:42.253,000 --> 0:10:45,000
So we had to know the velocity of Rosetta

195
0:10:45.597,000 --> 0:10:47,000
much better than one centimeter per second,

196
0:10:48.104,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and its location in space better than 100 meters

197
0:10:52.168,000 --> 0:10:55,000
at 500 million kilometers from Earth.

198
0:10:55.372,000 --> 0:10:57,000
That's no mean feat.

199
0:10:57.74,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Let me quickly take you through some of the science and the instruments.

200
0:11:02.129,000 --> 0:11:05,000
I won't bore you with all the details of all the instruments,

201
0:11:05.565,000 --> 0:11:06,000
but it's got everything.

202
0:11:07.214,000 --> 0:11:1,000
We can sniff gas, we can measure dust particles,

203
0:11:10.348,000 --> 0:11:12,000
the shape of them, the composition,

204
0:11:12.6,000 --> 0:11:14,000
there are magnetometers, everything.

205
0:11:15.108,000 --> 0:11:18,000
This is one of the results from an instrument which measures gas density

206
0:11:18.707,000 --> 0:11:19,000
at the position of Rosetta,

207
0:11:20.565,000 --> 0:11:22,000
so it's gas which has left the comet.

208
0:11:22.794,000 --> 0:11:24,000
The bottom graph is September of last year.

209
0:11:25.278,000 --> 0:11:28,000
There is a long-term variation, which in itself is not surprising,

210
0:11:28.575,000 --> 0:11:29,000
but you see the sharp peaks.

211
0:11:30.456,000 --> 0:11:32,000
This is a comet day.

212
0:11:32.546,000 --> 0:11:36,000
You can see the effect of the sun on the evaporation of gas

213
0:11:36.656,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and the fact that the comet is rotating.

214
0:11:39.604,000 --> 0:11:4,000
So there is one spot, apparently,

215
0:11:41.312,000 --> 0:11:43,000
where there is a lot of stuff coming from,

216
0:11:43.459,000 --> 0:11:46,000
it gets heated in the Sun, and then cools down on the back side.

217
0:11:46.756,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And we can see the density variations of this.

218
0:11:50.262,000 --> 0:11:54,000
These are the gases and the organic compounds

219
0:11:54.395,000 --> 0:11:55,000
that we already have measured.

220
0:11:56.09,000 --> 0:11:57,000
You will see it's an impressive list,

221
0:11:57.878,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and there is much, much, much more to come,

222
0:12:00.362,000 --> 0:12:01,000
because there are more measurements.

223
0:12:02.308,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Actually, there is a conference going on in Houston at the moment

224
0:12:05.656,000 --> 0:12:07,000
where many of these results are presented.

225
0:12:08.827,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Also, we measured dust particles.

226
0:12:10.448,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Now, for you, this will not look very impressive,

227
0:12:13.25,000 --> 0:12:16,000
but the scientists were thrilled when they saw this.

228
0:12:16.523,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Two dust particles:

229
0:12:17.94,000 --> 0:12:19,000
the right one they call Boris, and they shot it with tantalum

230
0:12:20.934,000 --> 0:12:22,000
in order to be able to analyze it.

231
0:12:23.048,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Now, we found sodium and magnesium.

232
0:12:25.439,000 --> 0:12:29,000
What this tells you is this is the concentration of these two materials

233
0:12:29.688,000 --> 0:12:31,000
at the time the solar system was formed,

234
0:12:32.404,000 --> 0:12:35,000
so we learned things about which materials were there

235
0:12:35.771,000 --> 0:12:38,000
when the planet was made.

236
0:12:38.859,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Of course, one of the important elements is the imaging.

237
0:12:41.577,000 --> 0:12:44,000
This is one of the cameras of Rosetta, the OSIRIS camera,

238
0:12:44.943,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and this actually was the cover of Science magazine

239
0:12:47.938,000 --> 0:12:49,000
on January 23 of this year.

240
0:12:50.608,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Nobody had expected this body to look like this.

241
0:12:54.046,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Boulders, rocks -- if anything, it looks more like the Half Dome in Yosemite

242
0:12:57.644,000 --> 0:12:59,000
than anything else.

243
0:13:00.151,000 --> 0:13:02,000
We also saw things like this:

244
0:13:02.729,000 --> 0:13:06,000
dunes, and what look to be, on the righthand side, wind-blown shadows.

245
0:13:07.651,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Now we know these from Mars, but this comet doesn't have an atmosphere,

246
0:13:11.575,000 --> 0:13:13,000
so it's a bit difficult to create a wind-blown shadow.

247
0:13:14.454,000 --> 0:13:15,000
It may be local outgassing,

248
0:13:16.439,000 --> 0:13:18,000
stuff which goes up and comes back.

249
0:13:18.622,000 --> 0:13:21,000
We don't know, so there is a lot to investigate.

250
0:13:21.803,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Here, you see the same image twice.

251
0:13:23.893,000 --> 0:13:25,000
On the left-hand side, you see in the middle a pit.

252
0:13:26.41,000 --> 0:13:28,000
On the right-hand side, if you carefully look,

253
0:13:28.627,000 --> 0:13:31,000
there are three jets coming out of the bottom of that pit.

254
0:13:31.858,000 --> 0:13:33,000
So this is the activity of the comet.

255
0:13:34.155,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Apparently, at the bottom of these pits is where the active regions are,

256
0:13:38.172,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and where the material evaporates into space.

257
0:13:40.935,000 --> 0:13:43,000
There is a very intriguing crack in the neck of the comet.

258
0:13:44.545,000 --> 0:13:45,000
You see it on the right-hand side.

259
0:13:46.541,000 --> 0:13:49,000
It's a kilometer long, and it's two and a half meters wide.

260
0:13:50.237,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Some people suggest that actually,

261
0:13:52.483,000 --> 0:13:54,000
when we get close to the sun,

262
0:13:54.551,000 --> 0:13:55,000
the comet may split in two,

263
0:13:56.409,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and then we'll have to choose,

264
0:13:58.089,000 --> 0:14:,000
which comet do we go for?

265
0:14:00.341,000 --> 0:14:03,000
The lander -- again, lots of instruments,

266
0:14:03.514,000 --> 0:14:08,000
mostly comparable except for the things which hammer in the ground and drill, etc.

267
0:14:08.855,000 --> 0:14:11,000
But much the same as Rosetta, and that is because you want to compare

268
0:14:12.732,000 --> 0:14:15,000
what you find in space with what you find on the comet.

269
0:14:16.238,000 --> 0:14:18,000
These are called ground truth measurements.

270
0:14:18.931,000 --> 0:14:21,000
These are the landing descent images

271
0:14:22.162,000 --> 0:14:24,000
that were taken by the OSIRIS camera.

272
0:14:24.21,000 --> 0:14:28,000
You see the lander getting further and further away from Rosetta.

273
0:14:28.436,000 --> 0:14:31,000
On the top right, you see an image taken at 60 meters by the lander,

274
0:14:32.244,000 --> 0:14:34,000
60 meters above the surface of the comet.

275
0:14:35.1,000 --> 0:14:37,000
The boulder there is some 10 meters.

276
0:14:37.514,000 --> 0:14:41,000
So this is one of the last images we took before we landed on the comet.

277
0:14:42.228,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Here, you see the whole sequence again, but from a different perspective,

278
0:14:45.786,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and you see three blown-ups from the bottom-left to the middle

279
0:14:49.971,000 --> 0:14:53,000
of the lander traveling over the surface of the comet.

280
0:14:54.156,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Then, at the top, there is a before and an after image of the landing.

281
0:14:58.342,000 --> 0:15:01,000
The only problem with the after image is, there is no lander.

282
0:15:02.269,000 --> 0:15:05,000
But if you carefully look at the right-hand side of this image,

283
0:15:05.54,000 --> 0:15:09,000
we saw the lander still there, but it had bounced.

284
0:15:09.569,000 --> 0:15:1,000
It had departed again.

285
0:15:11.23,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Now, on a bit of a comical note here

286
0:15:14.317,000 --> 0:15:18,000
is that originally Rosetta was designed to have a lander which would bounce.

287
0:15:18.937,000 --> 0:15:2,000
That was discarded because it was way too expensive.

288
0:15:21.51,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Now, we forgot, but the lander knew.

289
0:15:23.784,000 --> 0:15:24,000
(Laughter)

290
0:15:25.388,000 --> 0:15:27,000
During the first bounce, in the magnetometers,

291
0:15:27.895,000 --> 0:15:3,000
you see here the data from them, from the three axes, x, y and z.

292
0:15:31.725,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Halfway through, you see a red line.

293
0:15:33.931,000 --> 0:15:34,000
At that red line, there is a change.

294
0:15:35.765,000 --> 0:15:38,000
What happened, apparently, is during the first bounce,

295
0:15:39.69,000 --> 0:15:43,000
somewhere, we hit the edge of a crater with one of the legs of the lander,

296
0:15:44.416,000 --> 0:15:46,000
and the rotation velocity of the lander changed.

297
0:15:47.236,000 --> 0:15:48,000
So we've been rather lucky

298
0:15:49.209,000 --> 0:15:51,000
that we are where we are.

299
0:15:51.485,000 --> 0:15:54,000
This is one of the iconic images of Rosetta.

300
0:15:55.154,000 --> 0:15:58,000
It's a man-made object, a leg of the lander,

301
0:15:59.077,000 --> 0:16:,000
standing on a comet.

302
0:16:01.028,000 --> 0:16:06,000
This, for me, is one of the very best images of space science I have ever seen.

303
0:16:06.159,000 --> 0:16:11,000
(Applause)

304
0:16:11.34,000 --> 0:16:14,000
One of the things we still have to do is to actually find the lander.

305
0:16:15.191,000 --> 0:16:18,000
The blue area here is where we know it must be.

306
0:16:18.887,000 --> 0:16:21,000
We haven't been able to find it yet, but the search is continuing,

307
0:16:22.505,000 --> 0:16:25,000
as are our efforts to start getting the lander to work again.

308
0:16:26.27,000 --> 0:16:27,000
We listen every day,

309
0:16:28.012,000 --> 0:16:3,000
and we hope that between now and somewhere in April,

310
0:16:30.57,000 --> 0:16:31,000
the lander will wake up again.

311
0:16:32.308,000 --> 0:16:34,000
The findings of what we found on the comet:

312
0:16:35.795,000 --> 0:16:37,000
This thing would float in water.

313
0:16:38.251,000 --> 0:16:4,000
It's half the density of water.

314
0:16:40.875,000 --> 0:16:43,000
So it looks like a very big rock, but it's not.

315
0:16:43.893,000 --> 0:16:46,000
The activity increase we saw in June, July, August last year

316
0:16:47.539,000 --> 0:16:49,000
was a four-fold activity increase.

317
0:16:49.93,000 --> 0:16:5,000
By the time we will be at the sun,

318
0:16:51.673,000 --> 0:16:55,000
there will be 100 kilos a second leaving this comet:

319
0:16:56.246,000 --> 0:16:57,000
gas, dust, whatever.

320
0:16:57.802,000 --> 0:16:59,000
That's 100 million kilos a day.

321
0:17:01.603,000 --> 0:17:03,000
Then, finally, the landing day.

322
0:17:03.978,000 --> 0:17:08,000
I will never forget -- absolute madness, 250 TV crews in Germany.

323
0:17:09.366,000 --> 0:17:11,000
The BBC was interviewing me,

324
0:17:11.385,000 --> 0:17:13,000
and another TV crew who was following me all day

325
0:17:14.357,000 --> 0:17:16,000
were filming me being interviewed,

326
0:17:16.493,000 --> 0:17:18,000
and it went on like that for the whole day.

327
0:17:18.931,000 --> 0:17:19,000
The Discovery Channel crew

328
0:17:20.742,000 --> 0:17:22,000
actually caught me when leaving the control room,

329
0:17:23.064,000 --> 0:17:25,000
and they asked the right question,

330
0:17:25.177,000 --> 0:17:28,000
and man, I got into tears, and I still feel this.

331
0:17:28.802,000 --> 0:17:29,000
For a month and a half,

332
0:17:30.485,000 --> 0:17:32,000
I couldn't think about landing day without crying,

333
0:17:33.319,000 --> 0:17:35,000
and I still have the emotion in me.

334
0:17:36.034,000 --> 0:17:38,000
With this image of the comet, I would like to leave you.

335
0:17:38.983,000 --> 0:17:4,000
Thank you.

336
0:17:41.096,000 --> 0:17:45,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.618,000 --> 0:00:14,000
There's this fact that I love that I read somewhere once,

2
0:00:15.476,000 --> 0:00:19,000
that one of the things that's contributed to homo sapiens' success

3
0:00:20.15,000 --> 0:00:21,000
as a species

4
0:00:21.517,000 --> 0:00:23,000
is our lack of body hair --

5
0:00:23.597,000 --> 0:00:25,000
that our hairlessness, our nakedness

6
0:00:26.045,000 --> 0:00:28,000
combined with our invention of clothing,

7
0:00:28.375,000 --> 0:00:31,000
gives us the ability to modulate our body temperature

8
0:00:31.693,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and thus be able to survive in any climate we choose.

9
0:00:35.797,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And now we've evolved to the point where we can't survive without clothing.

10
0:00:39.346,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And it's more than just utility,

11
0:00:40.9,000 --> 0:00:41,000
now it's a communication.

12
0:00:42.245,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Everything that we choose to put on is a narrative,

13
0:00:45.077,000 --> 0:00:47,000
a story about where we've been,

14
0:00:47.122,000 --> 0:00:48,000
what we're doing,

15
0:00:48.738,000 --> 0:00:49,000
who we want to be.

16
0:00:51.048,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I was a lonely kid.

17
0:00:52.82,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I didn't have an easy time finding friends to play with,

18
0:00:55.676,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and I ended up making a lot of my own play.

19
0:00:58.423,000 --> 0:01:,000
I made a lot of my own toys.

20
0:01:00.926,000 --> 0:01:01,000
It began with ice cream.

21
0:01:02.589,000 --> 0:01:05,000
There was a Baskin-Robbins in my hometown,

22
0:01:05.737,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and they served ice cream from behind the counter

23
0:01:08.113,000 --> 0:01:1,000
in these giant, five-gallon, cardboard tubs.

24
0:01:10.744,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And someone told me -- I was eight years old --

25
0:01:13.03,000 --> 0:01:15,000
someone told me that when they were done with those tubs,

26
0:01:15.754,000 --> 0:01:17,000
they washed them out and kept them in the back,

27
0:01:17.992,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and if you asked they would give you one.

28
0:01:19.97,000 --> 0:01:21,000
It took me a couple of weeks to work up the courage,

29
0:01:22.428,000 --> 0:01:23,000
but I did, and they did.

30
0:01:23.603,000 --> 0:01:26,000
They gave me one -- I went home with this beautiful cardboard tub.

31
0:01:26.94,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I was trying to figure out what I could do with this exotic material --

32
0:01:30.36,000 --> 0:01:31,000
metal ring, top and bottom.

33
0:01:31.769,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I started turning it over in my head, and I realized, "Wait a minute --

34
0:01:35.178,000 --> 0:01:37,000
my head actually fits inside this thing."

35
0:01:37.344,000 --> 0:01:38,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:38.931,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Yeah, I cut a hole out,

37
0:01:40.648,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I put some acetate in there

38
0:01:42.191,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and I made myself a space helmet.

39
0:01:43.929,000 --> 0:01:44,000
(Laughter)

40
0:01:45.106,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I needed a place to wear the space helmet,

41
0:01:48.09,000 --> 0:01:5,000
so I found a refrigerator box a couple blocks from home.

42
0:01:50.818,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I pushed it home,

43
0:01:52.129,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and in my parents' guest room closet,

44
0:01:54.921,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I turned it into a spaceship.

45
0:01:57.336,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I started with a control panel out of cardboard.

46
0:01:59.659,000 --> 0:02:,000
I cut a hole for a radar screen

47
0:02:01.481,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and put a flashlight underneath it to light it.

48
0:02:03.728,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I put a view screen up, which I offset off the back wall --

49
0:02:06.802,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and this is where I thought I was being really clever --

50
0:02:09.459,000 --> 0:02:12,000
without permission, I painted the back wall of the closet black

51
0:02:12.53,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and put a star field,

52
0:02:13.713,000 --> 0:02:17,000
which I lit up with some Christmas lights I found in the attic,

53
0:02:18.267,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and I went on some space missions.

54
0:02:21.214,000 --> 0:02:22,000
A couple years later,

55
0:02:22.389,000 --> 0:02:23,000
the movie "Jaws" came out.

56
0:02:23.815,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I was way too young to see it, but I was caught up in "Jaws" fever,

57
0:02:27.085,000 --> 0:02:29,000
like everyone else in America at the time.

58
0:02:29.709,000 --> 0:02:32,000
There was a store in my town that had a "Jaws" costume in their window,

59
0:02:33.185,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and my mom must have overheard me talking to someone

60
0:02:35.777,000 --> 0:02:37,000
about how awesome I thought this costume was,

61
0:02:37.921,000 --> 0:02:38,000
because a couple days before Halloween,

62
0:02:39.803,000 --> 0:02:43,000
she blew my freaking mind by giving me this "Jaws" costume.

63
0:02:44.365,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Now, I recognize it's a bit of a trope

64
0:02:46.789,000 --> 0:02:47,000
for people of a certain age to complain

65
0:02:48.686,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that kids these days have no idea how good they have it,

66
0:02:52.246,000 --> 0:02:54,000
but let me just show you a random sampling

67
0:02:54.315,000 --> 0:02:57,000
of entry-level kids' costumes you can buy online right now ...

68
0:02:58.037,000 --> 0:03:01,000
... and this is the "Jaws" costume my mom bought for me.

69
0:03:01.883,000 --> 0:03:03,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:04.639,000 --> 0:03:07,000
This is a paper-thin shark face

71
0:03:07.914,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and a vinyl bib with the poster of "Jaws" on it.

72
0:03:11.476,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Laughter)

73
0:03:12.548,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And I loved it.

74
0:03:14.411,000 --> 0:03:15,000
A couple years later,

75
0:03:15.826,000 --> 0:03:17,000
my dad took me to a film called "Excalibur."

76
0:03:18.667,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I actually got him to take me to it twice,

77
0:03:20.733,000 --> 0:03:24,000
which is no small thing, because it is a hard, R-rated film.

78
0:03:25.024,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But it wasn't the blood and guts or the boobs

79
0:03:27.204,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that made me want to go see it again.

80
0:03:29.125,000 --> 0:03:3,000
They helped --

81
0:03:30.307,000 --> 0:03:31,000
(Laughter)

82
0:03:31.333,000 --> 0:03:32,000
It was the armor.

83
0:03:32.522,000 --> 0:03:36,000
The armor in "Excalibur" was intoxicatingly beautiful to me.

84
0:03:36.66,000 --> 0:03:4,000
These were literally knights in shining, mirror-polished armor.

85
0:03:41.301,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And moreover, the knights in "Excalibur" wear their armor everywhere.

86
0:03:45.502,000 --> 0:03:48,000
All the time -- they wear it at dinner, they wear it to bed.

87
0:03:49.049,000 --> 0:03:5,000
(Laughter)

88
0:03:50.124,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I was like, "Are they reading my mind?

89
0:03:52.018,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I want to wear armor all the time!"

90
0:03:54.51,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Laughter)

91
0:03:55.549,000 --> 0:03:57,000
So I went back to my favorite material,

92
0:03:57.772,000 --> 0:03:58,000
the gateway drug for making,

93
0:03:59.345,000 --> 0:04:,000
corrugated cardboard,

94
0:04:00.789,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and I made myself a suit of armor,

95
0:04:03.675,000 --> 0:04:06,000
replete with the neck shields and a white horse.

96
0:04:07.144,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Now that I've oversold it,

97
0:04:08.434,000 --> 0:04:1,000
here's a picture of the armor that I made.

98
0:04:10.484,000 --> 0:04:11,000
(Laughter)

99
0:04:11.849,000 --> 0:04:13,000
(Applause)

100
0:04:16.736,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Now, this is only the first suit of armor I made

101
0:04:19.351,000 --> 0:04:2,000
inspired by "Excalibur."

102
0:04:20.719,000 --> 0:04:21,000
A couple of years later,

103
0:04:21.996,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I convinced my dad to embark on making me a proper suit of armor.

104
0:04:26.118,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Over about a month,

105
0:04:27.787,000 --> 0:04:31,000
he graduated me from cardboard to roofing aluminum called flashing

106
0:04:32.105,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and still, one of my all-time favorite attachment materials,

107
0:04:34.945,000 --> 0:04:35,000
POP rivets.

108
0:04:36.136,000 --> 0:04:37,000
We carefully, over that month,

109
0:04:37.872,000 --> 0:04:39,000
constructed an articulated suit of aluminum armor

110
0:04:40.47,000 --> 0:04:41,000
with compound curves.

111
0:04:41.655,000 --> 0:04:43,000
We drilled holes in the helmet so that I could breathe,

112
0:04:44.584,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and I finished just in time for Halloween and wore it to school.

113
0:04:47.655,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Now, this is the one thing in this talk

114
0:04:49.833,000 --> 0:04:5,000
that I don't have a slide to show you,

115
0:04:51.674,000 --> 0:04:53,000
because no photo exists of this armor.

116
0:04:53.7,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I did wear it to school,

117
0:04:55.087,000 --> 0:04:57,000
there was a yearbook photographer patrolling the halls,

118
0:04:57.715,000 --> 0:05:,000
but he never found me, for reasons that are about to become clear.

119
0:05:01.129,000 --> 0:05:03,000
There were things I didn't anticipate

120
0:05:03.231,000 --> 0:05:07,000
about wearing a complete suit of aluminum armor to school.

121
0:05:08.061,000 --> 0:05:1,000
In third period math, I was standing in the back of class,

122
0:05:10.846,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and I'm standing in the back of class

123
0:05:12.671,000 --> 0:05:14,000
because the armor did not allow me to sit down.

124
0:05:14.891,000 --> 0:05:15,000
(Laughter)

125
0:05:16.37,000 --> 0:05:18,000
This is the first thing I didn't anticipate.

126
0:05:19.351,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And then my teacher looks at me sort of concerned

127
0:05:21.89,000 --> 0:05:23,000
about halfway through the class and says, "Are you feeling OK?"

128
0:05:24.906,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I'm thinking, "Are you kidding? Am I feeling OK?

129
0:05:27.176,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I'm wearing a suit of armor! I am having the time of my --"

130
0:05:30.068,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And I'm just about to tell her how great I feel,

131
0:05:32.752,000 --> 0:05:34,000
when the classroom starts to list to the left

132
0:05:35.169,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and disappear down this long tunnel,

133
0:05:37.91,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and then I woke up in the nurse's office.

134
0:05:42.275,000 --> 0:05:44,000
I had passed out from heat exhaustion,

135
0:05:45.293,000 --> 0:05:46,000
wearing the armor.

136
0:05:46.743,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And when I woke up,

137
0:05:47.918,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I wasn't embarrassed about having passed out in front of my class,

138
0:05:51.087,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I was wondering, "Who took my armor? Where's my armor?"

139
0:05:53.71,000 --> 0:05:55,000
OK, fast-forward a whole bunch of years,

140
0:05:55.924,000 --> 0:05:58,000
some colleagues and I get hired to make a show for Discovery Channel,

141
0:05:59.282,000 --> 0:06:,000
called "MythBusters."

142
0:06:00.457,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And over 14 years,

143
0:06:01.647,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I learn on the job how to build experimental methodologies

144
0:06:04.845,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and how to tell stories about them for television.

145
0:06:07.796,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I also learn early on

146
0:06:09.523,000 --> 0:06:11,000
that costuming can play a key role in this storytelling.

147
0:06:12.406,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I use costumes to add humor, comedy, color

148
0:06:16.465,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and narrative clarity to the stories we're telling.

149
0:06:19.935,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And then we do an episode called "Dumpster Diving,"

150
0:06:22.718,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and I learn a little bit more

151
0:06:25.009,000 --> 0:06:28,000
about the deeper implications of what costuming means to me.

152
0:06:28.464,000 --> 0:06:29,000
In the episode "Dumpster Diving,"

153
0:06:30.084,000 --> 0:06:31,000
the question we were trying to answer is:

154
0:06:32.063,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Is jumping into a dumpster as safe

155
0:06:33.73,000 --> 0:06:34,000
as the movies would lead you to believe?

156
0:06:35.73,000 --> 0:06:36,000
(Laughter)

157
0:06:37.528,000 --> 0:06:39,000
The episode was going to have two distinct parts to it.

158
0:06:40.187,000 --> 0:06:43,000
One was where we get trained to jump off buildings by a stuntman

159
0:06:43.266,000 --> 0:06:44,000
into an air bag.

160
0:06:44.623,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And the second was the graduation to the experiment:

161
0:06:47.128,000 --> 0:06:49,000
we'd fill a dumpster full of material and we'd jump into it.

162
0:06:49.997,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I wanted to visually separate these two elements,

163
0:06:52.308,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and I thought,

164
0:06:53.489,000 --> 0:06:56,000
"Well, for the first part we're training, so we should wear sweatsuits --

165
0:06:57.197,000 --> 0:07:,000
Oh! Let's put 'Stunt Trainee' on the back of the sweatsuits.

166
0:07:00.969,000 --> 0:07:01,000
That's for the training."

167
0:07:02.337,000 --> 0:07:05,000
But for the second part, I wanted something really visually striking --

168
0:07:05.726,000 --> 0:07:07,000
"I know! I'll dress as Neo from 'The Matrix.'"

169
0:07:08.228,000 --> 0:07:09,000
(Laughter)

170
0:07:09.326,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So I went to Haight Street.

171
0:07:10.66,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I bought some beautiful knee-high, buckle boots.

172
0:07:13.263,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I found a long, flowing coat on eBay.

173
0:07:15.729,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I got sunglasses, which I had to wear contact lenses in order to wear.

174
0:07:19.474,000 --> 0:07:2,000
The day of the experiment shoot comes up,

175
0:07:21.478,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and I step out of my car in this costume,

176
0:07:23.47,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and my crew takes a look at me ...

177
0:07:25.99,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and start suppressing their church giggles.

178
0:07:28.893,000 --> 0:07:31,000
They're like, "(Laugh sound)."

179
0:07:32.011,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And I feel two distinct things at this moment.

180
0:07:34.466,000 --> 0:07:35,000
I feel total embarrassment

181
0:07:36.187,000 --> 0:07:38,000
over the fact that it's so nakedly clear to my crew

182
0:07:38.957,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that I'm completely into wearing this costume.

183
0:07:41.623,000 --> 0:07:42,000
(Laughter)

184
0:07:43.328,000 --> 0:07:46,000
But the producer in my mind reminds myself

185
0:07:46.572,000 --> 0:07:48,000
that in the high-speed shot in slow-mo,

186
0:07:49.023,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that flowing coat is going to look beautiful behind me.

187
0:07:52.14,000 --> 0:07:53,000
(Laughter)

188
0:07:54.012,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Five years into the "MythBusters" run,

189
0:07:55.907,000 --> 0:07:57,000
we got invited to appear at San Diego Comic-Con.

190
0:07:58.587,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I'd known about Comic-Con for years and never had time to go.

191
0:08:02.007,000 --> 0:08:05,000
This was the big leagues -- this was costuming mecca.

192
0:08:05.635,000 --> 0:08:07,000
People fly in from all over the world

193
0:08:07.699,000 --> 0:08:1,000
to show their amazing creations on the floor in San Diego.

194
0:08:10.845,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And I wanted to participate.

195
0:08:12.394,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I decided that I would put together an elaborate costume

196
0:08:15.48,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that covered me completely,

197
0:08:16.938,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and I would walk the floor of San Diego Comic-Con anonymously.

198
0:08:20.581,000 --> 0:08:21,000
The costume I chose?

199
0:08:21.923,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Hellboy.

200
0:08:23.493,000 --> 0:08:24,000
That's not my costume,

201
0:08:24.668,000 --> 0:08:25,000
that's actually Hellboy.

202
0:08:25.843,000 --> 0:08:26,000
(Laughter)

203
0:08:26.886,000 --> 0:08:27,000
But I spent months

204
0:08:28.068,000 --> 0:08:3,000
assembling the most screen-accurate Hellboy costume I could,

205
0:08:30.932,000 --> 0:08:31,000
from the boots to the belt to the pants

206
0:08:32.891,000 --> 0:08:33,000
to the right hand of doom.

207
0:08:34.303,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I found a guy who made a prosthetic Hellboy head and chest

208
0:08:37.718,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and I put them on.

209
0:08:39.031,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I even had contact lenses made in my prescription.

210
0:08:42.786,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I wore it onto the floor at Comic-Con

211
0:08:45.14,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and I can't even tell you how balls hot it was in that costume.

212
0:08:49.793,000 --> 0:08:5,000
(Laughter)

213
0:08:50.857,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Sweating! I should've remembered this.

214
0:08:52.916,000 --> 0:08:54,000
I'm sweating buckets and the contact lenses hurt my eyes,

215
0:08:55.829,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and none of it matters because I'm totally in love.

216
0:08:59.402,000 --> 0:09:,000
(Laughter)

217
0:09:01.066,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Not just with the process of putting on this costume and walking the floor,

218
0:09:04.653,000 --> 0:09:07,000
but also with the community of other costumers.

219
0:09:08.256,000 --> 0:09:09,000
It's not called costuming at Cons,

220
0:09:10.176,000 --> 0:09:11,000
it's called "cosplay."

221
0:09:12.026,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Now ostensibly, cosplay means people who dress up

222
0:09:14.574,000 --> 0:09:16,000
as their favorite characters from film and television

223
0:09:17.161,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and especially anime,

224
0:09:18.369,000 --> 0:09:2,000
but it is so much more than that.

225
0:09:21.134,000 --> 0:09:24,000
These aren't just people who find a costume and put it on --

226
0:09:24.219,000 --> 0:09:25,000
they mash them up.

227
0:09:25.64,000 --> 0:09:26,000
They bend them to their will.

228
0:09:27.124,000 --> 0:09:3,000
They change them to be the characters they want to be in those productions.

229
0:09:30.94,000 --> 0:09:31,000
They're super clever and genius.

230
0:09:32.88,000 --> 0:09:34,000
They let their freak flag fly and it's beautiful.

231
0:09:35.567,000 --> 0:09:36,000
(Laughter)

232
0:09:36.63,000 --> 0:09:37,000
But more than that,

233
0:09:37.805,000 --> 0:09:38,000
they rehearse their costumes.

234
0:09:39.282,000 --> 0:09:4,000
At Comic-Con or any other Con,

235
0:09:40.782,000 --> 0:09:42,000
you don't just take pictures of people walking around.

236
0:09:43.353,000 --> 0:09:44,000
You go up and say,

237
0:09:44.532,000 --> 0:09:46,000
"Hey, I like your costume, can I take your picture?"

238
0:09:47.008,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And then you give them time to get into their pose.

239
0:09:49.828,000 --> 0:09:5,000
They've worked hard on their pose

240
0:09:51.522,000 --> 0:09:53,000
to make their costume look great for your camera.

241
0:09:54.166,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And it's so beautiful to watch.

242
0:09:57.178,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And I take this to heart.

243
0:09:58.633,000 --> 0:09:59,000
At subsequent Cons,

244
0:10:00.163,000 --> 0:10:04,000
I learn Heath Ledger's shambling walk as the Joker from "The Dark Knight."

245
0:10:04.58,000 --> 0:10:07,000
I learn how to be a scary Ringwraith from "Lord of the Rings,"

246
0:10:07.654,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and I actually frighten some children.

247
0:10:09.739,000 --> 0:10:1,000
I learned that "hrr hrr hrr" --

248
0:10:11.663,000 --> 0:10:13,000
that head laugh that Chewbacca does.

249
0:10:14.625,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And then I dressed up as No-Face from "Spirited Away."

250
0:10:17.623,000 --> 0:10:2,000
If you don't know about "Spirited Away" and its director, Hayao Miyazaki,

251
0:10:21.098,000 --> 0:10:22,000
first of all, you're welcome.

252
0:10:22.573,000 --> 0:10:23,000
(Laughter)

253
0:10:24.136,000 --> 0:10:27,000
This is a masterpiece, and one of my all-time favorite films.

254
0:10:27.6,000 --> 0:10:31,000
It's about a young girl named Chihiro who gets lost in the spirit world

255
0:10:31.967,000 --> 0:10:33,000
in an abandoned Japanese theme park.

256
0:10:34.324,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And she finds her way back out again

257
0:10:36.244,000 --> 0:10:38,000
with the help of a couple of friends she makes --

258
0:10:38.584,000 --> 0:10:39,000
a captured dragon named Haku

259
0:10:40.098,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and a lonely demon named No-Face.

260
0:10:42.386,000 --> 0:10:44,000
No-Face is lonely and he wants to make friends,

261
0:10:45.28,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and he thinks the way to do it is by luring them to him

262
0:10:48.469,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and producing gold in his hand.

263
0:10:50.563,000 --> 0:10:51,000
But this doesn't go very well,

264
0:10:52.338,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and so he ends up going on kind of a rampage

265
0:10:55.179,000 --> 0:10:57,000
until Chihiro saves him,

266
0:10:57.459,000 --> 0:10:58,000
rescues him.

267
0:10:59.081,000 --> 0:11:01,000
So I put together a No-Face costume,

268
0:11:02.731,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and I wore it on the floor at Comic-Con.

269
0:11:05.012,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And I very carefully practiced No-Face's gestures.

270
0:11:09.757,000 --> 0:11:12,000
I resolved I would not speak in this costume at all.

271
0:11:13.395,000 --> 0:11:15,000
When people asked to take my picture,

272
0:11:15.458,000 --> 0:11:16,000
I would nod

273
0:11:17.107,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and I would shyly stand next to them.

274
0:11:19.552,000 --> 0:11:2,000
They would take the picture

275
0:11:21.242,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and then I would secret out from behind my robe

276
0:11:23.98,000 --> 0:11:24,000
a chocolate gold coin.

277
0:11:25.526,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And at the end of the photo process, I'd make it appear for them.

278
0:11:28.918,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Ah, ah ah! -- like that.

279
0:11:31.651,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And people were freaking out.

280
0:11:33.058,000 --> 0:11:36,000
"Holy crap! Gold from No-Face! Oh my god, this is so cool!"

281
0:11:36.115,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And I'm feeling and I'm walking the floor and it's fantastic.

282
0:11:40.006,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And about 15 minutes in something happens.

283
0:11:43.368,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Somebody grabs my hand,

284
0:11:46.014,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and they put a coin back into it.

285
0:11:48.116,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And I think maybe they're giving me a coin as a return gift,

286
0:11:51.336,000 --> 0:11:53,000
but no, this is one of the coins that I'd given away.

287
0:11:54.229,000 --> 0:11:55,000
I don't know why.

288
0:11:55.704,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And I keep on going, I take some more pictures.

289
0:11:57.976,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And then it happens again.

290
0:11:59.939,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Understand, I can't see anything inside this costume.

291
0:12:03.174,000 --> 0:12:04,000
I can see through the mouth --

292
0:12:04.685,000 --> 0:12:05,000
I can see people's shoes.

293
0:12:06.328,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I can hear what they're saying and I can see their feet.

294
0:12:09.167,000 --> 0:12:11,000
But the third time someone gives me back a coin,

295
0:12:11.461,000 --> 0:12:12,000
I want to know what's going on.

296
0:12:13.612,000 --> 0:12:16,000
So I sort of tilt my head back to get a better view,

297
0:12:16.695,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and what I see is someone walking away from me going like this.

298
0:12:22.271,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And then it hits me:

299
0:12:24.6,000 --> 0:12:27,000
it's bad luck to take gold from No-Face.

300
0:12:28.257,000 --> 0:12:29,000
In the film "Spirited Away,"

301
0:12:30.193,000 --> 0:12:33,000
bad luck befalls those who take gold from No-Face.

302
0:12:34.351,000 --> 0:12:4,000
This isn't a performer-audience relationship; this is cosplay.

303
0:12:41.855,000 --> 0:12:43,000
We are, all of us on that floor,

304
0:12:44.092,000 --> 0:12:47,000
injecting ourselves into a narrative that meant something to us.

305
0:12:47.763,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And we're making it our own.

306
0:12:49.632,000 --> 0:12:53,000
We're connecting with something important inside of us.

307
0:12:54.333,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And the costumes are how we reveal ourselves

308
0:12:58.116,000 --> 0:12:59,000
to each other.

309
0:12:59.984,000 --> 0:13:,000
Thank you.

310
0:13:01.164,000 --> 0:13:06,000
(Applause)

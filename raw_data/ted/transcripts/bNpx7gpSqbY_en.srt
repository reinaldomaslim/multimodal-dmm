1
0:00:12.961,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm really excited to share with you

2
0:00:14.944,000 --> 0:00:16,000
some findings that really surprise me

3
0:00:17.534,000 --> 0:00:19,000
about what makes companies succeed the most,

4
0:00:20.085,000 --> 0:00:23,000
what factors actually matter the most for startup success.

5
0:00:25.063,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I believe that the startup organization

6
0:00:27.212,000 --> 0:00:3,000
is one of the greatest forms to make the world a better place.

7
0:00:31.63,000 --> 0:00:34,000
If you take a group of people with the right equity incentives

8
0:00:34.756,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and organize them in a startup,

9
0:00:36.635,000 --> 0:00:39,000
you can unlock human potential in a way never before possible.

10
0:00:40.609,000 --> 0:00:42,000
You get them to achieve unbelievable things.

11
0:00:43.679,000 --> 0:00:45,000
But if the startup organization is so great,

12
0:00:45.799,000 --> 0:00:46,000
why do so many fail?

13
0:00:47.281,000 --> 0:00:48,000
That's what I wanted to find out.

14
0:00:48.878,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I wanted to find out what actually matters most

15
0:00:51.363,000 --> 0:00:52,000
for startup success.

16
0:00:52.573,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And I wanted to try to be systematic about it,

17
0:00:54.782,000 --> 0:00:57,000
avoid some of my instincts and maybe misperceptions I have

18
0:00:57.935,000 --> 0:00:59,000
from so many companies I've seen over the years.

19
0:01:00.201,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I wanted to know this

20
0:01:01.428,000 --> 0:01:04,000
because I've been starting businesses since I was 12 years old

21
0:01:04.476,000 --> 0:01:06,000
when I sold candy at the bus stop in junior high school,

22
0:01:07.131,000 --> 0:01:09,000
to high school, when I made solar energy devices,

23
0:01:09.442,000 --> 0:01:1,000
to college, when I made loudspeakers.

24
0:01:11.229,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And when I graduated from college, I started software companies.

25
0:01:14.255,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And 20 years ago, I started Idealab,

26
0:01:16.064,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and in the last 20 years, we started more than 100 companies,

27
0:01:19.305,000 --> 0:01:21,000
many successes, and many big failures.

28
0:01:21.629,000 --> 0:01:22,000
We learned a lot from those failures.

29
0:01:23.988,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So I tried to look across what factors

30
0:01:26.735,000 --> 0:01:29,000
accounted the most for company success and failure.

31
0:01:29.898,000 --> 0:01:3,000
So I looked at these five.

32
0:01:31.458,000 --> 0:01:31,000
First, the idea.

33
0:01:32.418,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I used to think that the idea was everything.

34
0:01:34.574,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I named my company Idealab for how much I worship

35
0:01:36.881,000 --> 0:01:38,000
the "aha!" moment when you first come up with the idea.

36
0:01:39.474,000 --> 0:01:39,000
But then over time,

37
0:01:40.385,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I came to think that maybe the team, the execution, adaptability,

38
0:01:43.97,000 --> 0:01:45,000
that mattered even more than the idea.

39
0:01:46.121,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I never thought I'd be quoting boxer Mike Tyson on the TED stage,

40
0:01:50.483,000 --> 0:01:51,000
but he once said,

41
0:01:52.342,000 --> 0:01:56,000
"Everybody has a plan, until they get punched in the face." (Laughter)

42
0:01:56.945,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And I think that's so true about business as well.

43
0:01:59.864,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So much about a team's execution

44
0:02:02.14,000 --> 0:02:05,000
is its ability to adapt to getting punched in the face by the customer.

45
0:02:05.9,000 --> 0:02:06,000
The customer is the true reality.

46
0:02:07.588,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And that's why I came to think

47
0:02:09.039,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that the team maybe was the most important thing.

48
0:02:12.036,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Then I started looking at the business model.

49
0:02:14.148,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Does the company have a very clear path generating customer revenues?

50
0:02:17.398,000 --> 0:02:19,000
That started rising to the top in my thinking

51
0:02:19.502,000 --> 0:02:21,000
about maybe what mattered most for success.

52
0:02:21.819,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Then I looked at the funding.

53
0:02:23.216,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Sometimes companies received intense amounts of funding.

54
0:02:25.916,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Maybe that's the most important thing?

55
0:02:27.754,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And then of course, the timing.

56
0:02:29.3,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Is the idea way too early and the world's not ready for it?

57
0:02:32.11,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Is it early, as in, you're in advance and you have to educate the world?

58
0:02:35.557,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Is it just right?

59
0:02:36.366,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Or is it too late, and there's already too many competitors?

60
0:02:39.229,000 --> 0:02:41,000
So I tried to look very carefully at these five factors

61
0:02:41.818,000 --> 0:02:42,000
across many companies.

62
0:02:42.869,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And I looked across all 100 Idealab companies,

63
0:02:45.064,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and 100 non-Idealab companies

64
0:02:46.518,000 --> 0:02:48,000
to try and come up with something scientific about it.

65
0:02:49.574,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So first, on these Idealab companies,

66
0:02:51.899,000 --> 0:02:52,000
the top five companies --

67
0:02:53.772,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Citysearch, CarsDirect, GoTo, NetZero, Tickets.com --

68
0:02:57.188,000 --> 0:02:59,000
those all became billion-dollar successes.

69
0:02:59.262,000 --> 0:03:,000
And the five companies on the bottom --

70
0:03:01.175,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Z.com, Insider Pages, MyLife, Desktop Factory, Peoplelink --

71
0:03:03.985,000 --> 0:03:05,000
we all had high hopes for, but didn't succeed.

72
0:03:06.888,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So I tried to rank across all of those attributes

73
0:03:09.833,000 --> 0:03:12,000
how I felt those companies scored on each of those dimensions.

74
0:03:13.075,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And then for non-Idealab companies, I looked at wild successes,

75
0:03:16.54,000 --> 0:03:19,000
like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and Youtube and LinkedIn.

76
0:03:20.133,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And some failures:

77
0:03:21.385,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Webvan, Kozmo, Pets.com

78
0:03:23.185,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Flooz and Friendster.

79
0:03:24.465,000 --> 0:03:26,000
The bottom companies had intense funding,

80
0:03:26.469,000 --> 0:03:28,000
they even had business models in some cases,

81
0:03:28.548,000 --> 0:03:29,000
but they didn't succeed.

82
0:03:29.695,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I tried to look at what factors actually accounted the most

83
0:03:32.556,000 --> 0:03:34,000
for success and failure across all of these companies,

84
0:03:35.109,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and the results really surprised me.

85
0:03:37.338,000 --> 0:03:38,000
The number one thing was timing.

86
0:03:39.638,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Timing accounted for 42 percent

87
0:03:42.14,000 --> 0:03:44,000
of the difference between success and failure.

88
0:03:44.64,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Team and execution came in second,

89
0:03:46.742,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and the idea,

90
0:03:47.564,000 --> 0:03:49,000
the differentiability of the idea, the uniqueness of the idea,

91
0:03:50.481,000 --> 0:03:51,000
that actually came in third.

92
0:03:51.884,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Now, this isn't absolutely definitive,

93
0:03:53.849,000 --> 0:03:55,000
it's not to say that the idea isn't important,

94
0:03:56.066,000 --> 0:03:59,000
but it very much surprised me that the idea wasn't the most important thing.

95
0:03:59.706,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Sometimes it mattered more when it was actually timed.

96
0:04:02.306,000 --> 0:04:05,000
The last two, business model and funding, made sense to me actually.

97
0:04:05.681,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I think business model makes sense to be that low

98
0:04:08.048,000 --> 0:04:1,000
because you can start out without a business model

99
0:04:10.428,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and add one later if your customers are demanding what you're creating.

100
0:04:13.895,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And funding, I think as well,

101
0:04:15.301,000 --> 0:04:17,000
if you're underfunded at first but you're gaining traction,

102
0:04:18.076,000 --> 0:04:19,000
especially in today's age,

103
0:04:19.365,000 --> 0:04:21,000
it's very, very easy to get intense funding.

104
0:04:21.426,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So now let me give you some specific examples about each of these.

105
0:04:24.546,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So take a wild success like Airbnb that everybody knows about.

106
0:04:27.459,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Well, that company was famously passed on by many smart investors

107
0:04:30.524,000 --> 0:04:31,000
because people thought,

108
0:04:31.666,000 --> 0:04:34,000
"No one's going to rent out a space in their home to a stranger."

109
0:04:34.719,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Of course, people proved that wrong.

110
0:04:36.444,000 --> 0:04:37,000
But one of the reasons it succeeded,

111
0:04:38.298,000 --> 0:04:4,000
aside from a good business model, a good idea, great execution,

112
0:04:41.283,000 --> 0:04:41,000
is the timing.

113
0:04:42.02,000 --> 0:04:45,000
That company came out right during the height of the recession

114
0:04:45.299,000 --> 0:04:46,000
when people really needed extra money,

115
0:04:47.117,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and that maybe helped people overcome

116
0:04:48.931,000 --> 0:04:5,000
their objection to renting out their own home to a stranger.

117
0:04:51.777,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Same thing with Uber.

118
0:04:52.896,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Uber came out,

119
0:04:53.949,000 --> 0:04:55,000
incredible company, incredible business model,

120
0:04:56.11,000 --> 0:04:57,000
great execution, too.

121
0:04:57.174,000 --> 0:04:58,000
But the timing was so perfect

122
0:04:58.656,000 --> 0:05:,000
for their need to get drivers into the system.

123
0:05:00.805,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Drivers were looking for extra money; it was very, very important.

124
0:05:03.927,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Some of our early successes, Citysearch, came out when people needed web pages.

125
0:05:07.705,000 --> 0:05:09,000
GoTo.com, which we announced actually at TED in 1998,

126
0:05:10.182,000 --> 0:05:13,000
was when companies were looking for cost-effective ways to get traffic.

127
0:05:13.513,000 --> 0:05:14,000
We thought the idea was so great,

128
0:05:15.085,000 --> 0:05:17,000
but actually, the timing was probably maybe more important.

129
0:05:17.846,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And then some of our failures.

130
0:05:19.284,000 --> 0:05:22,000
We started a company called Z.com, it was an online entertainment company.

131
0:05:22.761,000 --> 0:05:23,000
We were so excited about it --

132
0:05:24.204,000 --> 0:05:26,000
we raised enough money, we had a great business model,

133
0:05:26.746,000 --> 0:05:29,000
we even signed incredibly great Hollywood talent to join the company.

134
0:05:29.994,000 --> 0:05:31,000
But broadband penetration was too low in 1999-2000.

135
0:05:32.382,000 --> 0:05:34,000
It was too hard to watch video content online,

136
0:05:34.538,000 --> 0:05:36,000
you had to put codecs in your browser and do all this stuff,

137
0:05:37.347,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and the company eventually went out of business in 2003.

138
0:05:39.978,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Just two years later,

139
0:05:41.074,000 --> 0:05:43,000
when the codec problem was solved by Adobe Flash

140
0:05:43.959,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and when broadband penetration crossed 50 percent in America,

141
0:05:47.633,000 --> 0:05:48,000
YouTube was perfectly timed.

142
0:05:49.59,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Great idea, but unbelievable timing.

143
0:05:51.319,000 --> 0:05:54,000
In fact, YouTube didn't even have a business model when it first started.

144
0:05:54.759,000 --> 0:05:56,000
It wasn't even certain that that would work out.

145
0:05:57.042,000 --> 0:05:59,000
But that was beautifully, beautifully timed.

146
0:05:59.177,000 --> 0:06:,000
So what I would say, in summary,

147
0:06:00.728,000 --> 0:06:02,000
is execution definitely matters a lot.

148
0:06:03.513,000 --> 0:06:04,000
The idea matters a lot.

149
0:06:04.757,000 --> 0:06:05,000
But timing might matter even more.

150
0:06:06.516,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And the best way to really assess timing

151
0:06:08.562,000 --> 0:06:1,000
is to really look at whether consumers are really ready

152
0:06:11.179,000 --> 0:06:12,000
for what you have to offer them.

153
0:06:12.715,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And to be really, really honest about it,

154
0:06:14.677,000 --> 0:06:16,000
not be in denial about any results that you see,

155
0:06:16.938,000 --> 0:06:19,000
because if you have something you love, you want to push it forward,

156
0:06:20.149,000 --> 0:06:23,000
but you have to be very, very honest about that factor on timing.

157
0:06:23.219,000 --> 0:06:23,000
As I said earlier,

158
0:06:24.089,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I think startups can change the world and make the world a better place.

159
0:06:27.478,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I hope some of these insights

160
0:06:28.876,000 --> 0:06:3,000
can maybe help you have a slightly higher success ratio,

161
0:06:31.528,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and thus make something great come to the world

162
0:06:33.748,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that wouldn't have happened otherwise.

163
0:06:35.594,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Thank you very much, you've been a great audience.

164
0:06:37.931,000 --> 0:06:38,000

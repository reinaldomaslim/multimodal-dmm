0:00:17.415,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Hi.

3
0:00:19.622,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Thank you.

4
0:00:20.983,000 --> 0:00:21,000
[Jennifer Brea is sound-sensitive.

5
0:00:22.704,000 --> 0:00:25,000
The live audience was asked to applaud ASL-style, in silence.]

6
0:00:25.873,000 --> 0:00:28,000
So, five years ago, this was me.

7
0:00:29.747,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I was a PhD student at Harvard,

8
0:00:31.776,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and I loved to travel.

9
0:00:34.472,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I had just gotten engaged to marry the love of my life.

10
0:00:39.072,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I was 28, and like so many of us when we are in good health,

11
0:00:43.071,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I felt like I was invincible.

12
0:00:46.477,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Then one day I had a fever of 104.7 degrees.

13
0:00:50.758,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I probably should have gone to the doctor,

14
0:00:52.831,000 --> 0:00:54,000
but I'd never really been sick in my life,

15
0:00:55.419,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and I knew that usually, if you have a virus,

16
0:00:57.796,000 --> 0:01:,000
you stay home and you make some chicken soup,

17
0:01:00.953,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and in a few days, everything will be fine.

18
0:01:04.499,000 --> 0:01:05,000
But this time it wasn't fine.

19
0:01:07.56,000 --> 0:01:08,000
After the fever broke,

20
0:01:09.121,000 --> 0:01:12,000
for three weeks I was so dizzy, I couldn't leave my house.

21
0:01:13.467,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I would walk straight into door frames.

22
0:01:16.335,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I had to hug the walls just to make it to the bathroom.

23
0:01:20.613,000 --> 0:01:22,000
That spring I got infection after infection,

24
0:01:23.825,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and every time I went to the doctor,

25
0:01:25.676,000 --> 0:01:27,000
he said there was absolutely nothing wrong.

26
0:01:29.533,000 --> 0:01:3,000
He had his laboratory tests,

27
0:01:31.182,000 --> 0:01:32,000
which always came back normal.

28
0:01:33.875,000 --> 0:01:34,000
All I had were my symptoms,

29
0:01:35.866,000 --> 0:01:36,000
which I could describe,

30
0:01:37.82,000 --> 0:01:38,000
but no one else can see.

31
0:01:41.37,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I know it sounds silly,

32
0:01:42.617,000 --> 0:01:45,000
but you have to find a way to explain things like this to yourself,

33
0:01:45.909,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and so I thought maybe I was just aging.

34
0:01:50.114,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Maybe this is what it's like to be on the other side of 25.

35
0:01:53.691,000 --> 0:01:55,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:56.808,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Then the neurological symptoms started.

37
0:01:59.59,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Sometimes I would find that I couldn't draw the right side of a circle.

38
0:02:04.325,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Other times I wouldn't be able to speak or move at all.

39
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I saw every kind of specialist:

40
0:02:12.088,000 --> 0:02:15,000
infectious disease doctors, dermatologists, endocrinologists,

41
0:02:15.184,000 --> 0:02:16,000
cardiologists.

42
0:02:16.945,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I even saw a psychiatrist.

43
0:02:19.679,000 --> 0:02:22,000
My psychiatrist said, "It's clear you're really sick,

44
0:02:22.947,000 --> 0:02:24,000
but not with anything psychiatric.

45
0:02:26.045,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I hope they can find out what's wrong with you."

46
0:02:30.094,000 --> 0:02:34,000
The next day, my neurologist diagnosed me with conversion disorder.

47
0:02:34.842,000 --> 0:02:35,000
He told me that everything --

48
0:02:37.255,000 --> 0:02:39,000
the fevers, the sore throats, the sinus infection,

49
0:02:40.916,000 --> 0:02:43,000
all of the gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiac symptoms --

50
0:02:44.715,000 --> 0:02:46,000
were being caused by some distant emotional trauma

51
0:02:47.457,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that I could not remember.

52
0:02:50.069,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The symptoms were real, he said,

53
0:02:52.546,000 --> 0:02:54,000
but they had no biological cause.

54
0:02:56.527,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I was training to be a social scientist.

55
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I had studied statistics, probability theory,

56
0:03:02.416,000 --> 0:03:04,000
mathematical modeling, experimental design.

57
0:03:07.058,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I felt like I couldn't just reject my neurologist's diagnosis.

58
0:03:11.599,000 --> 0:03:12,000
It didn't feel true,

59
0:03:13.215,000 --> 0:03:16,000
but I knew from my training that the truth is often counterintuitive,

60
0:03:17.356,000 --> 0:03:19,000
so easily obscured by what we want to believe.

61
0:03:20.514,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So I had to consider the possibility that he was right.

62
0:03:25.603,000 --> 0:03:27,000
That day, I ran a small experiment.

63
0:03:28.919,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I walked back the two miles from my neurologist's office to my house,

64
0:03:33.229,000 --> 0:03:37,000
my legs wrapped in this strange, almost electric kind of pain.

65
0:03:38.475,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I meditated on that pain,

66
0:03:40.102,000 --> 0:03:44,000
contemplating how my mind could have possibly generated all this.

67
0:03:45.32,000 --> 0:03:46,000
As soon as I walked through the door,

68
0:03:47.219,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I collapsed.

69
0:03:48.837,000 --> 0:03:5,000
My brain and my spinal cord were burning.

70
0:03:52.696,000 --> 0:03:55,000
My neck was so stiff I couldn't touch my chin to my chest,

71
0:03:57.324,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and the slightest sound --

72
0:03:59.099,000 --> 0:04:,000
the rustling of the sheets,

73
0:04:00.958,000 --> 0:04:02,000
my husband walking barefoot in the next room --

74
0:04:03.737,000 --> 0:04:05,000
could cause excruciating pain.

75
0:04:07.832,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I would spend most of the next two years in bed.

76
0:04:11.235,000 --> 0:04:13,000
How could my doctor have gotten it so wrong?

77
0:04:14.939,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I thought I had a rare disease,

78
0:04:17.144,000 --> 0:04:18,000
something doctors had never seen.

79
0:04:19.926,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And then I went online

80
0:04:21.145,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and found thousands of people all over the world

81
0:04:23.98,000 --> 0:04:24,000
living with the same symptoms,

82
0:04:26.087,000 --> 0:04:27,000
similarly isolated,

83
0:04:27.675,000 --> 0:04:28,000
similarly disbelieved.

84
0:04:29.854,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Some could still work,

85
0:04:31.161,000 --> 0:04:33,000
but had to spend their evenings and weekends in bed,

86
0:04:33.67,000 --> 0:04:35,000
just so they could show up the next Monday.

87
0:04:36.364,000 --> 0:04:38,000
On the other end of the spectrum,

88
0:04:38.468,000 --> 0:04:39,000
some were so sick

89
0:04:40.23,000 --> 0:04:42,000
they had to live in complete darkness,

90
0:04:42.56,000 --> 0:04:45,000
unable to tolerate the sound of a human voice

91
0:04:45.956,000 --> 0:04:46,000
or the touch of a loved one.

92
0:04:49.469,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I was diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis.

93
0:04:54.554,000 --> 0:04:57,000
You've probably heard it called "chronic fatigue syndrome."

94
0:04:58.987,000 --> 0:04:59,000
For decades, that's a name

95
0:05:00.933,000 --> 0:05:01,000
that's meant that this

96
0:05:03.578,000 --> 0:05:04,000
has been the dominant image

97
0:05:04.985,000 --> 0:05:07,000
of a disease that can be as serious as this.

98
0:05:09.468,000 --> 0:05:1,000
The key symptom we all share

99
0:05:11.016,000 --> 0:05:14,000
is that whenever we exert ourselves -- physically, mentally --

100
0:05:15.296,000 --> 0:05:16,000
we pay and we pay hard.

101
0:05:17.807,000 --> 0:05:2,000
If my husband goes for a run, he might be sore for a couple of days.

102
0:05:21.325,000 --> 0:05:24,000
If I try to walk half a block, I might be bedridden for a week.

103
0:05:25.323,000 --> 0:05:27,000
It is a perfect custom prison.

104
0:05:28.261,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I know ballet dancers who can't dance,

105
0:05:31.033,000 --> 0:05:33,000
accountants who can't add,

106
0:05:33.23,000 --> 0:05:35,000
medical students who never became doctors.

107
0:05:36.421,000 --> 0:05:38,000
It doesn't matter what you once were;

108
0:05:39.056,000 --> 0:05:4,000
you can't do it anymore.

109
0:05:41.475,000 --> 0:05:42,000
It's been four years,

110
0:05:43.389,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and I've still never been as well as I was

111
0:05:46.009,000 --> 0:05:49,000
the minute before I walked home from my neurologist's office.

112
0:05:50.683,000 --> 0:05:53,000
It's estimated that about 15 to 30 million people around the world

113
0:05:53.902,000 --> 0:05:54,000
have this disease.

114
0:05:55.604,000 --> 0:05:58,000
In the US, where I'm from, it's about one million people.

115
0:05:58.891,000 --> 0:06:01,000
That makes it roughly twice as common as multiple sclerosis.

116
0:06:03.797,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Patients can live for decades with the physical function

117
0:06:06.563,000 --> 0:06:08,000
of someone with congestive heart failure.

118
0:06:09.31,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Twenty-five percent of us are homebound or bedridden,

119
0:06:12.927,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and 75 to 85 percent of us can't even work part-time.

120
0:06:17.385,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Yet doctors do not treat us

121
0:06:20.064,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and science does not study us.

122
0:06:23.116,000 --> 0:06:26,000
How could a disease this common and this devastating

123
0:06:27.325,000 --> 0:06:28,000
have been forgotten by medicine?

124
0:06:31.264,000 --> 0:06:33,000
When my doctor diagnosed me with conversion disorder,

125
0:06:33.812,000 --> 0:06:35,000
he was invoking a lineage of ideas about women's bodies

126
0:06:36.524,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that are over 2,500 years old.

127
0:06:39.215,000 --> 0:06:4,000
The Roman physician Galen thought

128
0:06:40.972,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that hysteria was caused by sexual deprivation

129
0:06:43.967,000 --> 0:06:45,000
in particularly passionate women.

130
0:06:47.125,000 --> 0:06:49,000
The Greeks thought the uterus would literally dry up

131
0:06:49.913,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and wander around the body in search of moisture,

132
0:06:52.364,000 --> 0:06:53,000
pressing on internal organs --

133
0:06:54.284,000 --> 0:06:55,000
yes --

134
0:06:56.648,000 --> 0:06:58,000
causing symptoms from extreme emotions

135
0:06:59.367,000 --> 0:07:01,000
to dizziness and paralysis.

136
0:07:02.715,000 --> 0:07:04,000
The cure was marriage and motherhood.

137
0:07:06.898,000 --> 0:07:1,000
These ideas went largely unchanged for several millennia until the 1880s,

138
0:07:11.482,000 --> 0:07:14,000
when neurologists tried to modernize the theory of hysteria.

139
0:07:15.764,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Sigmund Freud developed a theory

140
0:07:17.441,000 --> 0:07:19,000
that the unconscious mind could produce physical symptoms

141
0:07:20.261,000 --> 0:07:22,000
when dealing with memories or emotions

142
0:07:22.3,000 --> 0:07:24,000
too painful for the conscious mind to handle.

143
0:07:24.635,000 --> 0:07:26,000
It converted these emotions into physical symptoms.

144
0:07:29.46,000 --> 0:07:31,000
This meant that men could now get hysteria,

145
0:07:31.68,000 --> 0:07:33,000
but of course women were still the most susceptible.

146
0:07:35.448,000 --> 0:07:38,000
When I began investigating the history of my own disease,

147
0:07:39.089,000 --> 0:07:42,000
I was amazed to find how deep these ideas still run.

148
0:07:43.011,000 --> 0:07:44,000
In 1934,

149
0:07:44.221,000 --> 0:07:48,000
198 doctors, nurses and staff at the Los Angeles County General Hospital

150
0:07:49.02,000 --> 0:07:5,000
became seriously ill.

151
0:07:50.585,000 --> 0:07:54,000
They had muscle weakness, stiffness in the neck and back, fevers --

152
0:07:55.02,000 --> 0:07:58,000
all of the same symptoms I had when I first got diagnosed.

153
0:07:58.928,000 --> 0:08:,000
Doctors thought it was a new form of polio.

154
0:08:02.133,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Since then, there have been more than 70 outbreaks documented

155
0:08:05.088,000 --> 0:08:06,000
around the world,

156
0:08:06.273,000 --> 0:08:08,000
of a strikingly similar post-infectious disease.

157
0:08:09.419,000 --> 0:08:12,000
All of these outbreaks have tended to disproportionately affect women,

158
0:08:13.482,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and in time, when doctors failed to find the one cause of the disease,

159
0:08:17.433,000 --> 0:08:2,000
they thought that these outbreaks were mass hysteria.

160
0:08:21.115,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Why has this idea had such staying power?

161
0:08:25.567,000 --> 0:08:26,000
I do think it has to do with sexism,

162
0:08:27.387,000 --> 0:08:3,000
but I also think that fundamentally, doctors want to help.

163
0:08:30.852,000 --> 0:08:31,000
They want to know the answer,

164
0:08:32.646,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and this category allows doctors to treat what would otherwise be untreatable,

165
0:08:37.561,000 --> 0:08:39,000
to explain illnesses that have no explanation.

166
0:08:41.079,000 --> 0:08:43,000
The problem is that this can cause real harm.

167
0:08:44.382,000 --> 0:08:47,000
In the 1950s, a psychiatrist named Eliot Slater

168
0:08:48.002,000 --> 0:08:52,000
studied a cohort of 85 patients who had been diagnosed with hysteria.

169
0:08:52.766,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Nine years later, 12 of them were dead and 30 had become disabled.

170
0:08:56.787,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Many had undiagnosed conditions like multiple sclerosis,

171
0:09:00.244,000 --> 0:09:01,000
epilepsy, brain tumors.

172
0:09:03.259,000 --> 0:09:06,000
In 1980, hysteria was officially renamed "conversion disorder."

173
0:09:07.563,000 --> 0:09:1,000
When my neurologist gave me that diagnosis in 2012,

174
0:09:10.911,000 --> 0:09:12,000
he was echoing Freud's words verbatim,

175
0:09:13.552,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and even today,

176
0:09:14.727,000 --> 0:09:18,000
women are 2 to 10 times more likely to receive that diagnosis.

177
0:09:20.487,000 --> 0:09:23,000
The problem with the theory of hysteria or psychogenic illness

178
0:09:24.51,000 --> 0:09:26,000
is that it can never be proven.

179
0:09:26.568,000 --> 0:09:28,000
It is by definition the absence of evidence,

180
0:09:30.192,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and in the case of ME,

181
0:09:31.591,000 --> 0:09:35,000
psychological explanations have held back biological research.

182
0:09:35.62,000 --> 0:09:38,000
All around the world, ME is one of the least funded diseases.

183
0:09:39.321,000 --> 0:09:45,000
In the US, we spend each year roughly 2,500 dollars per AIDS patient,

184
0:09:46.809,000 --> 0:09:48,000
250 dollars per MS patient

185
0:09:50.1,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and just 5 dollars per year per ME patient.

186
0:09:54.125,000 --> 0:09:56,000
This was not just lightning.

187
0:09:56.23,000 --> 0:09:57,000
I was not just unlucky.

188
0:09:58.494,000 --> 0:10:01,000
The ignorance surrounding my disease has been a choice,

189
0:10:01.609,000 --> 0:10:05,000
a choice made by the institutions that were supposed to protect us.

190
0:10:07.535,000 --> 0:10:09,000
We don't know why ME sometimes runs in families,

191
0:10:10.43,000 --> 0:10:12,000
why you can get it after almost any infection,

192
0:10:12.919,000 --> 0:10:15,000
from enteroviruses to Epstein-Barr virus to Q fever,

193
0:10:17.123,000 --> 0:10:2,000
or why it affects women at two to three times the rate of men.

194
0:10:21.058,000 --> 0:10:23,000
This issue is much bigger than just my disease.

195
0:10:24.356,000 --> 0:10:25,000
When I first got sick,

196
0:10:25.563,000 --> 0:10:27,000
old friends were reaching out to me.

197
0:10:28.18,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I soon found myself a part of a cohort of women in their late 20s

198
0:10:31.333,000 --> 0:10:32,000
whose bodies were falling apart.

199
0:10:34.012,000 --> 0:10:36,000
What was striking was just how much trouble we were having

200
0:10:36.891,000 --> 0:10:37,000
being taken seriously.

201
0:10:38.577,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I learned of one woman with scleroderma,

202
0:10:40.559,000 --> 0:10:42,000
an autoimmune connective tissue disease,

203
0:10:42.683,000 --> 0:10:44,000
who was told for years that it was all in her head.

204
0:10:45.417,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Between the time of onset and diagnosis,

205
0:10:47.953,000 --> 0:10:49,000
her esophagus was so thoroughly damaged,

206
0:10:50.404,000 --> 0:10:52,000
she will never be able to eat again.

207
0:10:52.673,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Another woman with ovarian cancer,

208
0:10:55.376,000 --> 0:10:57,000
who for years was told that it was just early menopause.

209
0:10:59.188,000 --> 0:11:,000
A friend from college,

210
0:11:00.78,000 --> 0:11:03,000
whose brain tumor was misdiagnosed for years as anxiety.

211
0:11:06.222,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Here's why this worries me:

212
0:11:09.125,000 --> 0:11:12,000
since the 1950s, rates of many autoimmune diseases

213
0:11:12.6,000 --> 0:11:13,000
have doubled to tripled.

214
0:11:14.818,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Forty-five percent of patients who are eventually diagnosed

215
0:11:17.782,000 --> 0:11:18,000
with a recognized autoimmune disease

216
0:11:19.8,000 --> 0:11:21,000
are initially told they're hypochondriacs.

217
0:11:22.783,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Like the hysteria of old, this has everything to do with gender

218
0:11:25.957,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and with whose stories we believe.

219
0:11:28.974,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Seventy-five percent of autoimmune disease patients are women,

220
0:11:32.649,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and in some diseases, it's as high as 90 percent.

221
0:11:37.076,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Even though these diseases disproportionately affect women,

222
0:11:39.957,000 --> 0:11:4,000
they are not women's diseases.

223
0:11:41.633,000 --> 0:11:44,000
ME affects children and ME affects millions of men.

224
0:11:45.345,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And as one patient told me,

225
0:11:47.154,000 --> 0:11:48,000
we get it coming and going --

226
0:11:48.686,000 --> 0:11:51,000
if you're a woman, you're told you're exaggerating your symptoms,

227
0:11:52.318,000 --> 0:11:55,000
but if you're a guy, you're told to be strong, to buck up.

228
0:11:56.676,000 --> 0:12:,000
And men may even have a more difficult time getting diagnosed.

229
0:12:09.419,000 --> 0:12:11,000
My brain is not what it used to be.

230
0:12:25.914,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Here's the good part:

231
0:12:28.645,000 --> 0:12:3,000
despite everything, I still have hope.

232
0:12:31.903,000 --> 0:12:34,000
So many diseases were once thought of as psychological

233
0:12:35.827,000 --> 0:12:37,000
until science uncovered their biological mechanisms.

234
0:12:39.323,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Patients with epilepsy could be forcibly institutionalized

235
0:12:42.441,000 --> 0:12:46,000
until the EEG was able to measure abnormal electrical activity in the brain.

236
0:12:47.5,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Multiple sclerosis could be misdiagnosed as hysterical paralysis

237
0:12:51.8,000 --> 0:12:54,000
until the CAT scan and the MRI discovered brain lesions.

238
0:12:55.945,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And recently, we used to think

239
0:12:57.484,000 --> 0:12:59,000
that stomach ulcers were just caused by stress,

240
0:13:00.328,000 --> 0:13:03,000
until we discovered that H. pylori was the culprit.

241
0:13:04.801,000 --> 0:13:06,000
ME has never benefited from the kind of science

242
0:13:07.719,000 --> 0:13:09,000
that other diseases have had,

243
0:13:10.053,000 --> 0:13:11,000
but that's starting to change.

244
0:13:12.661,000 --> 0:13:15,000
In Germany, scientists are starting to find evidence of autoimmunity,

245
0:13:16.226,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and in Japan, of brain inflammation.

246
0:13:19.406,000 --> 0:13:22,000
In the US, scientists at Stanford are finding abnormalities

247
0:13:22.484,000 --> 0:13:23,000
in energy metabolism

248
0:13:24.404,000 --> 0:13:27,000
that are 16 standard deviations away from normal.

249
0:13:28.64,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And in Norway, researchers are running a phase-3 clinical trial

250
0:13:32.709,000 --> 0:13:35,000
on a cancer drug that in some patients causes complete remission.

251
0:13:37.798,000 --> 0:13:38,000
What also gives me hope

252
0:13:40.316,000 --> 0:13:42,000
is the resilience of patients.

253
0:13:43.968,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Online we came together,

254
0:13:46.251,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and we shared our stories.

255
0:13:49.449,000 --> 0:13:51,000
We devoured what research there was.

256
0:13:52.743,000 --> 0:13:54,000
We experimented on ourselves.

257
0:13:55.496,000 --> 0:13:57,000
We became our own scientists and our own doctors

258
0:13:57.893,000 --> 0:13:58,000
because we had to be.

259
0:14:00.378,000 --> 0:14:03,000
And slowly I added five percent here, five percent there,

260
0:14:04.141,000 --> 0:14:06,000
until eventually, on a good day,

261
0:14:06.398,000 --> 0:14:07,000
I was able to leave my home.

262
0:14:09.815,000 --> 0:14:11,000
I still had to make ridiculous choices:

263
0:14:12.568,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Will I sit in the garden for 15 minutes, or will I wash my hair today?

264
0:14:16.924,000 --> 0:14:18,000
But it gave me hope that I could be treated.

265
0:14:19.693,000 --> 0:14:21,000
I had a sick body; that was all.

266
0:14:22.789,000 --> 0:14:26,000
And with the right kind of help, maybe one day I could get better.

267
0:14:27.74,000 --> 0:14:3,000
I came together with patients around the world,

268
0:14:31.466,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and we started to fight.

269
0:14:33.863,000 --> 0:14:36,000
We have filled the void with something wonderful,

270
0:14:37.698,000 --> 0:14:38,000
but it is not enough.

271
0:14:40.662,000 --> 0:14:44,000
I still don't know if I will ever be able to run again,

272
0:14:44.723,000 --> 0:14:45,000
or walk at any distance,

273
0:14:46.644,000 --> 0:14:49,000
or do any of those kinetic things that I now only get to do in my dreams.

274
0:14:51.143,000 --> 0:14:54,000
But I am so grateful for how far I have come.

275
0:14:55.955,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Progress is slow,

276
0:14:57.464,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and it is up

277
0:14:59.31,000 --> 0:15:,000
and it is down,

278
0:15:01.222,000 --> 0:15:03,000
but I am getting a little better each day.

279
0:15:06.013,000 --> 0:15:09,000
I remember what it was like when I was stuck in that bedroom,

280
0:15:10.548,000 --> 0:15:12,000
when it had been months since I had seen the sun.

281
0:15:15.226,000 --> 0:15:17,000
I thought that I would die there.

282
0:15:18.961,000 --> 0:15:19,000
But here I am today,

283
0:15:21.255,000 --> 0:15:22,000
with you,

284
0:15:23.513,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and that is a miracle.

285
0:15:28.606,000 --> 0:15:31,000
I don't know what would have happened had I not been one of the lucky ones,

286
0:15:32.377,000 --> 0:15:34,000
had I gotten sick before the internet,

287
0:15:34.995,000 --> 0:15:35,000
had I not found my community.

288
0:15:37.777,000 --> 0:15:39,000
I probably would have already taken my own life,

289
0:15:41.028,000 --> 0:15:42,000
as so many others have done.

290
0:15:44.094,000 --> 0:15:47,000
How many lives could we have saved, decades ago,

291
0:15:47.957,000 --> 0:15:48,000
if we had asked the right questions?

292
0:15:50.626,000 --> 0:15:52,000
How many lives could we save today

293
0:15:53.592,000 --> 0:15:55,000
if we decide to make a real start?

294
0:15:57.205,000 --> 0:16:,000
Even once the true cause of my disease is discovered,

295
0:16:00.881,000 --> 0:16:03,000
if we don't change our institutions and our culture,

296
0:16:04.38,000 --> 0:16:06,000
we will do this again to another disease.

297
0:16:07.658,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Living with this illness has taught me

298
0:16:09.676,000 --> 0:16:11,000
that science and medicine are profoundly human endeavors.

299
0:16:13.153,000 --> 0:16:15,000
Doctors, scientists and policy makers

300
0:16:15.768,000 --> 0:16:17,000
are not immune to the same biases

301
0:16:19.568,000 --> 0:16:2,000
that affect all of us.

302
0:16:23.377,000 --> 0:16:26,000
We need to think in more nuanced ways about women's health.

303
0:16:27.119,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Our immune systems are just as much a battleground for equality

304
0:16:31.245,000 --> 0:16:32,000
as the rest of our bodies.

305
0:16:33.253,000 --> 0:16:35,000
We need to listen to patients' stories,

306
0:16:36.542,000 --> 0:16:38,000
and we need to be willing to say, "I don't know."

307
0:16:40.024,000 --> 0:16:42,000
"I don't know" is a beautiful thing.

308
0:16:43.235,000 --> 0:16:45,000
"I don't know" is where discovery starts.

309
0:16:47.365,000 --> 0:16:48,000
And if we can do that,

310
0:16:49.447,000 --> 0:16:52,000
if we can approach the great vastness of all that we do not know,

311
0:16:53.166,000 --> 0:16:54,000
and then, rather than fear uncertainty,

312
0:16:55.142,000 --> 0:16:57,000
maybe we can greet it with a sense of wonder.

313
0:16:58.342,000 --> 0:16:59,000

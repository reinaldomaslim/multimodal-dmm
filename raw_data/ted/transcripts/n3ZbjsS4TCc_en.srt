1
0:00:12.655,000 --> 0:00:13,000
A few years ago,

2
0:00:14.302,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I was taking care of a woman who was a victim of violence.

3
0:00:18.654,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I wanted her to be seen in a clinic that specialized in trauma survivors.

4
0:00:24.431,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I made the appointment myself because, being the director of the department,

5
0:00:29.295,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I knew if I did it,

6
0:00:30.781,000 --> 0:00:32,000
she would get an appointment right away.

7
0:00:33.886,000 --> 0:00:36,000
The clinic was about an hour and a half away from where she lived.

8
0:00:37.823,000 --> 0:00:4,000
But she took down the address and agreed to go.

9
0:00:42.794,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Unfortunately, she didn't make it to the clinic.

10
0:00:47.339,000 --> 0:00:51,000
When I spoke to the psychiatrist, he explained to me

11
0:00:51.657,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that trauma survivors are often resistant

12
0:00:55.047,000 --> 0:00:57,000
to dealing with the difficult issues that they face

13
0:00:57.898,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and often miss appointments.

14
0:01:00.298,000 --> 0:01:01,000
For this reason,

15
0:01:01.504,000 --> 0:01:05,000
they don't generally allow the doctors to make appointments for the patients.

16
0:01:06.892,000 --> 0:01:08,000
They had made a special exception for me.

17
0:01:10.409,000 --> 0:01:12,000
When I spoke to my patient,

18
0:01:12.562,000 --> 0:01:16,000
she had a much simpler and less Freudian explanation

19
0:01:16.631,000 --> 0:01:18,000
of why she didn't go to that appointment:

20
0:01:19.714,000 --> 0:01:2,000
her ride didn't show.

21
0:01:22.996,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Now, some of you may be thinking,

22
0:01:25.167,000 --> 0:01:28,000
"Didn't she have some other way of getting to that clinic appointment?"

23
0:01:29.347,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Couldn't she have taken an Uber or called another friend?

24
0:01:34.327,000 --> 0:01:35,000
If you're thinking that,

25
0:01:35.791,000 --> 0:01:38,000
it's probably because you have resources.

26
0:01:39.385,000 --> 0:01:42,000
But she didn't have enough money for an Uber,

27
0:01:42.538,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and she didn't have another friend to call.

28
0:01:45.858,000 --> 0:01:46,000
But she did have me,

29
0:01:47.594,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and I was able to get her another appointment,

30
0:01:50.623,000 --> 0:01:52,000
which she kept without difficulty.

31
0:01:53.65,000 --> 0:01:54,000
She wasn't resistant,

32
0:01:55.361,000 --> 0:01:56,000
it's just that her ride didn't show.

33
0:01:58.669,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I wish I could say that this was an isolated incident,

34
0:02:02.612,000 --> 0:02:05,000
but I know from running the safety net systems

35
0:02:05.662,000 --> 0:02:09,000
in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and now New York City,

36
0:02:11.181,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that health care is built on a middle-class model

37
0:02:14.803,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that often doesn't meet the needs of low-income patients.

38
0:02:19.807,000 --> 0:02:23,000
That's one of the reasons why it's been so difficult

39
0:02:23.866,000 --> 0:02:26,000
for us to close the disparity in health care

40
0:02:27.533,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that exists along economic lines,

41
0:02:30.953,000 --> 0:02:33,000
despite the expansion of health insurance

42
0:02:34.624,000 --> 0:02:37,000
under the ACA, or Obamacare.

43
0:02:38.908,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Health care in the United States

44
0:02:41.265,000 --> 0:02:47,000
assumes that, besides getting across the large land expanse of Los Angeles,

45
0:02:49.39,000 --> 0:02:51,000
it also assumes that you can take off from work

46
0:02:52.246,000 --> 0:02:54,000
in the middle of the day to get care.

47
0:02:55.434,000 --> 0:02:59,000
One of the patients who came to my East Los Angeles clinic

48
0:02:59.738,000 --> 0:03:01,000
on a Thursday afternoon

49
0:03:01.984,000 --> 0:03:05,000
presented with partial blindness in both eyes.

50
0:03:07.449,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Very concerned, I said to him,

51
0:03:09.594,000 --> 0:03:1,000
"When did this develop?"

52
0:03:11.952,000 --> 0:03:12,000
He said, "Sunday."

53
0:03:14.457,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I said, "Sunday?

54
0:03:15.952,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Did you think of coming sooner to clinic?"

55
0:03:19.326,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And he said, "Well, I have to work in order to pay the rent."

56
0:03:23.598,000 --> 0:03:25,000
A second patient to that same clinic,

57
0:03:26.285,000 --> 0:03:27,000
a trucker,

58
0:03:27.758,000 --> 0:03:3,000
drove three days with a raging infection,

59
0:03:31.479,000 --> 0:03:35,000
only coming to see me after he had delivered his merchandise.

60
0:03:36.487,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Both patients' care was jeopardized by their delays in seeking care.

61
0:03:43.839,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Health care in the United States assumes that you speak English

62
0:03:47.472,000 --> 0:03:5,000
or can bring someone with you who can.

63
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
In San Francisco, I took care of a patient on the inpatient service

64
0:03:56.029,000 --> 0:04:01,000
who was from West Africa and spoke a dialect so unusual

65
0:04:01.183,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that we could only find one translator on the telephonic line

66
0:04:06.765,000 --> 0:04:07,000
who could understand him.

67
0:04:08.608,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And that translator only worked one afternoon a week.

68
0:04:12.695,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Unfortunately, my patient needed translation services every day.

69
0:04:18.526,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Health care in the United States assumes that you are literate.

70
0:04:22.476,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I learned that a patient of mine who spoke English without accent

71
0:04:27.717,000 --> 0:04:28,000
was illiterate,

72
0:04:29.249,000 --> 0:04:34,000
when he asked me to please sign a social security disability form for him

73
0:04:34.958,000 --> 0:04:35,000
right away.

74
0:04:36.298,000 --> 0:04:39,000
The form needed to go to the office that same day,

75
0:04:39.615,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and I wasn't in clinic,

76
0:04:41.526,000 --> 0:04:42,000
so trying to help him out,

77
0:04:43.128,000 --> 0:04:46,000
knowing that he was the sole caretaker of his son,

78
0:04:46.909,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I said, "Well, bring the form to my administrative office.

79
0:04:51.154,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I'll sign it and I'll fax it in for you."

80
0:04:54.084,000 --> 0:04:56,000
He took the two buses to my office,

81
0:04:56.603,000 --> 0:04:58,000
dropped off the form,

82
0:04:58.783,000 --> 0:05:,000
went back home to take care of his son ...

83
0:05:01.173,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I got to the office, and what did I find next to the big "X" on the form?

84
0:05:06.621,000 --> 0:05:07,000
The word "applicant."

85
0:05:09.561,000 --> 0:05:1,000
He needed to sign the form.

86
0:05:12.255,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And so now I had to have him take the two buses back to the office

87
0:05:15.731,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and sign the form so that we could then fax it in for him.

88
0:05:20.58,000 --> 0:05:22,000
It completely changed how I took care of him.

89
0:05:22.772,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I made sure that I always went over instructions verbally with him.

90
0:05:29.096,000 --> 0:05:31,000
It also made me think about all of the patients

91
0:05:31.97,000 --> 0:05:34,000
who receive reams and reams of paper

92
0:05:35.295,000 --> 0:05:39,000
spit out by our modern electronic health record systems,

93
0:05:39.372,000 --> 0:05:41,000
explaining their diagnoses and their treatments,

94
0:05:42.029,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and wondering how many people actually can understand

95
0:05:44.975,000 --> 0:05:46,000
what's on those pieces of paper.

96
0:05:47.954,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Health care in the United States assumes that you have a working telephone

97
0:05:52.579,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and an accurate address.

98
0:05:54.781,000 --> 0:05:57,000
The proliferation of inexpensive cell phones

99
0:05:58.156,000 --> 0:05:59,000
has actually helped quite a lot.

100
0:06:00.377,000 --> 0:06:03,000
But still, my patients run out of minutes,

101
0:06:03.407,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and their phones get disconnected.

102
0:06:06.918,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Low-income people often have to move around a lot by necessity.

103
0:06:11.365,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I remember reviewing a chart of a woman with an abnormality on her mammogram.

104
0:06:17.85,000 --> 0:06:22,000
That chart assiduously documents that three letters were sent to her home,

105
0:06:23.359,000 --> 0:06:26,000
asking her to please come in for follow-up.

106
0:06:27.127,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Of course, if the address isn't accurate,

107
0:06:29.397,000 --> 0:06:33,000
it doesn't much matter how many letters you send to that same address.

108
0:06:35.397,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Health care in the United States assumes that you have a steady supply of food.

109
0:06:41.035,000 --> 0:06:44,000
This is particularly an issue for diabetics.

110
0:06:44.591,000 --> 0:06:47,000
We give them medications that lower their blood sugar.

111
0:06:48.388,000 --> 0:06:5,000
On days when they don't have enough food,

112
0:06:51.018,000 --> 0:06:54,000
it puts them at risk for a life-threatening side effect

113
0:06:54.811,000 --> 0:06:56,000
of hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar.

114
0:06:58.935,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Health care in the United States assumes that you have a home

115
0:07:02.213,000 --> 0:07:04,000
with a refrigerator for your insulin,

116
0:07:04.714,000 --> 0:07:06,000
a bathroom where you can wash up,

117
0:07:07.377,000 --> 0:07:09,000
a bed where you can sleep

118
0:07:09.403,000 --> 0:07:13,000
without worrying about violence while you're resting.

119
0:07:14.385,000 --> 0:07:15,000
But what if you don't have that?

120
0:07:16.692,000 --> 0:07:18,000
What if you live on the street,

121
0:07:18.952,000 --> 0:07:2,000
you live under the freeway,

122
0:07:21.229,000 --> 0:07:23,000
you live in a congregant shelter,

123
0:07:23.544,000 --> 0:07:26,000
where every morning you have to leave at 7 or 8am?

124
0:07:28.029,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Where do you store your medicines?

125
0:07:32.851,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Where do you use the bathroom?

126
0:07:36.209,000 --> 0:07:4,000
How do you put your legs up if you have congestive heart failure?

127
0:07:41.056,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Is it any wonder that providing people with health insurance who are homeless

128
0:07:47.393,000 --> 0:07:5,000
does not erase the huge disparity

129
0:07:50.449,000 --> 0:07:52,000
between the homeless and the housed?

130
0:07:53.862,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Health care in the United States assumes that you prioritize your health care.

131
0:07:59.974,000 --> 0:08:,000
But what about all of you?

132
0:08:02.467,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Let me assume for a moment that you're all taking a medication.

133
0:08:06.741,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Maybe it's for high blood pressure.

134
0:08:08.998,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Maybe it's for diabetes or depression.

135
0:08:13.272,000 --> 0:08:15,000
What if tonight you had a choice:

136
0:08:16.626,000 --> 0:08:2,000
you could have your medication but live on the street,

137
0:08:22.507,000 --> 0:08:27,000
or you could be housed in your home but not have your medication.

138
0:08:29.879,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Which would you choose?

139
0:08:33.289,000 --> 0:08:34,000
I know which one I would choose.

140
0:08:36.538,000 --> 0:08:4,000
This is just a graphic example of the kinds of choices

141
0:08:40.658,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that low-income patients have to make every day.

142
0:08:44.418,000 --> 0:08:46,000
So when my doctors shake their heads and say,

143
0:08:47.368,000 --> 0:08:51,000
"I don't know why that patient didn't keep his follow-up appointments,"

144
0:08:52.549,000 --> 0:08:56,000
"I don't know why she didn't go for that exam that I ordered,"

145
0:08:57.466,000 --> 0:09:,000
I think, well, maybe her ride didn't show,

146
0:09:01.171,000 --> 0:09:02,000
or maybe he had to work.

147
0:09:03.509,000 --> 0:09:08,000
But also, maybe there was something more important that day

148
0:09:09.39,000 --> 0:09:12,000
than their high blood pressure or a screening colonoscopy.

149
0:09:13.873,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Maybe that patient was dealing with an abusive spouse

150
0:09:18.252,000 --> 0:09:21,000
or a daughter who is pregnant and drug-addicted

151
0:09:22.144,000 --> 0:09:25,000
or a son who was kicked out of school.

152
0:09:25.872,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Or even maybe they were riding their bicycle through an intersection

153
0:09:31.316,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and got hit by a truck,

154
0:09:33.499,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and now they're using a wheelchair and have very limited mobility.

155
0:09:39.619,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Obviously, these things also happen to middle-class people.

156
0:09:44.161,000 --> 0:09:45,000
But when they do,

157
0:09:45.949,000 --> 0:09:49,000
we have resources that enable us to deal with these problems.

158
0:09:50.838,000 --> 0:09:55,000
We also have the belief that we will live out our normal lifespans.

159
0:09:56.678,000 --> 0:09:58,000
That's not true for low-income people.

160
0:09:59.578,000 --> 0:10:03,000
They've seen their friends and relatives die young

161
0:10:03.73,000 --> 0:10:04,000
of accidents,

162
0:10:05.163,000 --> 0:10:06,000
of violence,

163
0:10:06.384,000 --> 0:10:1,000
of cancers that should have been diagnosed at an earlier stage.

164
0:10:11.206,000 --> 0:10:13,000
It can lead to a sense of hopelessness,

165
0:10:13.947,000 --> 0:10:15,000
that it doesn't really matter what you do.

166
0:10:18.128,000 --> 0:10:23,000
I know I've painted a bleak picture of the care of low-income patients.

167
0:10:23.268,000 --> 0:10:26,000
But I want you to know how rewarding I find it

168
0:10:26.325,000 --> 0:10:28,000
to work in a safety net system,

169
0:10:28.807,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and my deep belief is that we can make the system responsive

170
0:10:33.184,000 --> 0:10:35,000
to the needs of low-income patients.

171
0:10:36.935,000 --> 0:10:4,000
The starting point has to be to meet patients where they are,

172
0:10:41.075,000 --> 0:10:43,000
provide services without obstacles

173
0:10:44.678,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and provide patients what they need --

174
0:10:48.257,000 --> 0:10:49,000
not what we think they need.

175
0:10:51.625,000 --> 0:10:54,000
It's impossible for me to take good care of a patient

176
0:10:55.532,000 --> 0:10:57,000
who is homeless and living on the street.

177
0:10:58.933,000 --> 0:11:02,000
The right prescription for a homeless patient is housing.

178
0:11:04.474,000 --> 0:11:05,000
In Los Angeles,

179
0:11:06.312,000 --> 0:11:12,000
we housed 4,700 chronically homeless persons

180
0:11:12.366,000 --> 0:11:16,000
suffering from medical illness, mental illness, addiction.

181
0:11:18.06,000 --> 0:11:22,000
When we housed them, we found that overall health care costs,

182
0:11:22.699,000 --> 0:11:23,000
including the housing,

183
0:11:24.61,000 --> 0:11:25,000
decreased.

184
0:11:26.22,000 --> 0:11:3,000
That's because they had many fewer hospital visits,

185
0:11:30.719,000 --> 0:11:34,000
both in the emergency room and on the inpatient service.

186
0:11:36.106,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And we gave them back their dignity.

187
0:11:39.374,000 --> 0:11:4,000
No extra charge for that.

188
0:11:42.652,000 --> 0:11:46,000
For people who do not have a steady supply of food,

189
0:11:47.297,000 --> 0:11:5,000
especially those who are diabetic,

190
0:11:50.984,000 --> 0:11:55,000
safety net systems are experimenting with a variety of solutions,

191
0:11:56.417,000 --> 0:12:,000
including food pantries at primary care clinics

192
0:12:00.575,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and distributing maps of community food banks and soup kitchens.

193
0:12:05.835,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And in New York City,

194
0:12:07.681,000 --> 0:12:09,000
we've hired a bunch of enrollers

195
0:12:10.264,000 --> 0:12:15,000
to get our patients into the supplemental nutrition program

196
0:12:15.505,000 --> 0:12:18,000
known as "food stamps" to most people.

197
0:12:20.671,000 --> 0:12:23,000
When patients and doctors don't understand each other,

198
0:12:24.332,000 --> 0:12:25,000
mistakes will occur.

199
0:12:26.717,000 --> 0:12:27,000
For non-English-speaking patients,

200
0:12:28.689,000 --> 0:12:31,000
translation is as important as a prescription pad.

201
0:12:33.208,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Perhaps more important.

202
0:12:35.274,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And, you know, it doesn't cost anything more

203
0:12:38.167,000 --> 0:12:42,000
to put all of the materials at the level of fourth-grade reading,

204
0:12:43.008,000 --> 0:12:47,000
so that everybody can understand what's being said.

205
0:12:47.935,000 --> 0:12:5,000
But more than anything else, I think low-income patients

206
0:12:51.366,000 --> 0:12:54,000
benefit from having a primary care doctor.

207
0:12:55.68,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Mind you, I think middle-class people also benefit

208
0:12:58.33,000 --> 0:13:,000
from having somebody to quarterback their care.

209
0:13:01.631,000 --> 0:13:04,000
But when they don't, they have others who can advocate for them,

210
0:13:04.786,000 --> 0:13:07,000
who can get them that disability placard

211
0:13:08.166,000 --> 0:13:12,000
or make sure the disability application is completed.

212
0:13:12.739,000 --> 0:13:17,000
But low-income people really need a team of people who can help them

213
0:13:18.065,000 --> 0:13:22,000
to access the medical and non-medical services that they need.

214
0:13:23.226,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Also, many low-income people are disenfranchised

215
0:13:26.553,000 --> 0:13:28,000
from other community supports,

216
0:13:28.969,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and they really benefit from the care and continuity provided by primary care.

217
0:13:35.615,000 --> 0:13:37,000
A primary care doctor I particularly admire

218
0:13:38.504,000 --> 0:13:43,000
once told me how she believed that her relationship with a patient

219
0:13:43.602,000 --> 0:13:44,000
over a decade

220
0:13:45.113,000 --> 0:13:49,000
was the only healthy relationship that that patient had in her life.

221
0:13:50.793,000 --> 0:13:53,000
The good news is, you don't actually have to be a doctor

222
0:13:54.751,000 --> 0:13:58,000
to provide that special sauce of care and continuity.

223
0:13:59.713,000 --> 0:14:03,000
This was really brought home to me when one of my own long-term patients

224
0:14:03.957,000 --> 0:14:05,000
died at an outside hospital.

225
0:14:06.887,000 --> 0:14:09,000
I had to tell the other doctors and nurses in my clinic

226
0:14:10.648,000 --> 0:14:11,000
that he had passed.

227
0:14:12.465,000 --> 0:14:16,000
But I didn't know that in another part of our clinic,

228
0:14:16.498,000 --> 0:14:18,000
on a different floor,

229
0:14:18.546,000 --> 0:14:2,000
there was a registration clerk

230
0:14:21.093,000 --> 0:14:25,000
who had developed a very special relationship with my patient

231
0:14:25.132,000 --> 0:14:27,000
every time he came in for an appointment.

232
0:14:28.849,000 --> 0:14:31,000
When she learned three weeks later that he had died,

233
0:14:32.559,000 --> 0:14:34,000
she came and found me in my examining room,

234
0:14:35.323,000 --> 0:14:37,000
tears streaming down her cheeks,

235
0:14:38.274,000 --> 0:14:43,000
talking about my patient and the memories that she had of him,

236
0:14:43.899,000 --> 0:14:47,000
the kinds of discussions that they had had about their lives together.

237
0:14:50.072,000 --> 0:14:51,000
My patient had a hard life.

238
0:14:52.705,000 --> 0:14:55,000
He was by his own admission a gangbanger.

239
0:14:56.234,000 --> 0:14:59,000
He had spent a substantial amount of time in prison.

240
0:15:00.893,000 --> 0:15:02,000
He suffered from a very serious illness.

241
0:15:04.318,000 --> 0:15:05,000
He was a drug addict.

242
0:15:06.53,000 --> 0:15:09,000
But despite all that, he rarely missed a visit,

243
0:15:10.692,000 --> 0:15:15,000
and I like to believe that was because he knew at our clinic that he was loved.

244
0:15:17.793,000 --> 0:15:22,000
When our health care systems have the same commitment to low-income patients

245
0:15:23.178,000 --> 0:15:24,000
that that man had to us,

246
0:15:25.099,000 --> 0:15:26,000
two things will happen.

247
0:15:27.638,000 --> 0:15:31,000
First, the system will be responsive to the needs of low-income people.

248
0:15:32.467,000 --> 0:15:35,000
It will speak their language, it will meet their schedules,

249
0:15:36.462,000 --> 0:15:37,000
it will fulfill their needs.

250
0:15:39.169,000 --> 0:15:42,000
Second, we will be providing the kind of care

251
0:15:43.138,000 --> 0:15:45,000
that we went into this profession to do --

252
0:15:45.962,000 --> 0:15:47,000
not just checking the boxes,

253
0:15:48.795,000 --> 0:15:51,000
but really taking care of those we serve.

254
0:15:53.404,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Thank you.

255
0:15:54.666,000 --> 0:15:58,000
(Applause)

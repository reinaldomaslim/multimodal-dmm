1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Jambo, bonjour, zdravstvujtye, dayo: these are a few of the languages

2
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that I've spoken little bits of over the course of the last six weeks,

3
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
as I've been to 17 countries I think I'm up to, on this crazy tour I've been doing,

4
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
checking out various aspects of the project that we're doing.

5
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And I'm going to tell you a little bit about later on.

6
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And visiting some pretty incredible places,

7
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
places like Mongolia, Cambodia, New Guinea, South Africa, Tanzania twice --

8
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I was here a month ago.

9
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And the opportunity to make a whirlwind tour of the world like that

10
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
is utterly amazing, for lots of reasons.

11
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
You see some incredible stuff.

12
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And you get to make these spot comparisons

13
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
between people all around the globe.

14
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And the thing that you really take away from that,

15
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
the kind of surface thing that you take away from it,

16
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
is not that we're all one, although I'm going to tell you about that,

17
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
but rather how different we are.

18
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
There is so much diversity around the globe.

19
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
6,000 different languages spoken by six and a half billion people,

20
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
all different colors, shapes, sizes.

21
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
You walk down the street in any big city, you travel like that,

22
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and you are amazed at the diversity in the human species.

23
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
How do we explain that diversity?

24
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Well, that's what I'm going to talk about today,

25
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
is how we're using the tools of genetics,

26
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
population genetics in particular, to tell us how we generated this diversity,

27
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and how long it took.

28
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Now, the problem of human diversity,

29
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
like all big scientific questions --

30
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
how do you explain something like that --

31
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
can be broken down into sub-questions.

32
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And you can ferret away at those little sub-questions.

33
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
First one is really a question of origins.

34
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Do we all share a common origin, in fact?

35
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And given that we do -- and that's the assumption

36
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
everybody, I think, in this room would make -- when was that?

37
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
When did we originate as a species?

38
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
How long have we been divergent from each other?

39
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And the second question is related, but slightly different.

40
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
If we do spring from a common source,

41
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
how did we come to occupy every corner of the globe,

42
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and in the process generate all of this diversity,

43
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
the different ways of life, the different appearances,

44
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
the different languages around the world?

45
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Well, the question of origins, as with so many other questions in biology,

46
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
seems to have been answered by Darwin over a century ago.

47
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
In "The Descent of Man," he wrote,

48
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
"In each great region of the world, the living mammals

49
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
are closely related to the extinct species of the same region.

50
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
It's therefore probable that Africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes

51
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
closely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee,

52
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and as these two species are now man's nearest allies,

53
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
it's somewhat more probable that our early progenitors

54
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
lived on the African continent than elsewhere."

55
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
So we're done, we can go home -- finished the origin question.

56
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Well, not quite. Because Darwin was talking about our distant ancestry,

57
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
our common ancestry with apes.

58
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And it is quite clear that apes originated on the African continent.

59
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Around 23 million years ago, they appear in the fossil record.

60
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Africa was actually disconnected from the other landmasses at that time,

61
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
due to the vagaries of plate tectonics, floating around the Indian Ocean.

62
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Bumped into Eurasia around 16 million years ago,

63
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and then we had the first African exodus, as we call it.

64
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
The apes that left at that time ended up in Southeast Asia,

65
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
became the gibbons and the orangutans.

66
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And the ones that stayed on in Africa

67
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
evolved into the gorillas, the chimpanzees and us.

68
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So, yes, if you're talking about our common ancestry with apes,

69
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
it's very clear, by looking at the fossil record, we started off here.

70
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
But that's not really the question I'm asking.

71
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I'm asking about our human ancestry,

72
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
things that we would recognize as being like us

73
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
if they were sitting here in the room.

74
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
If they were peering over your shoulder,

75
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
you wouldn't leap back, like that. What about our human ancestry?

76
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Because if we go far enough back,

77
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
we share a common ancestry with every living thing on Earth.

78
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
DNA ties us all together, so we share ancestry with barracuda

79
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and bacteria and mushrooms, if you go far enough back -- over a billion years.

80
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
What we're asking about though is human ancestry.

81
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
How do we study that?

82
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Well, historically, it has been studied using the science of paleoanthropology.

83
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Digging things up out of the ground,

84
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and largely on the basis of morphology --

85
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
the way things are shaped, often skull shape -- saying,

86
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
"This looks a little bit more like us than that, so this must be my ancestor.

87
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
This must be who I'm directly descended from."

88
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
The field of paleoanthropology, I'll argue,

89
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
gives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our ancestry,

90
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
but it doesn't give us the probabilities that we really want as scientists.

91
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
What do I mean by that?

92
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
You're looking at a great example here.

93
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
These are three extinct species of hominids,

94
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
potential human ancestors.

95
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
All dug up just west of here in Olduvai Gorge, by the Leakey family.

96
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And they're all dating to roughly the same time.

97
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
From left to right, we've got Homo erectus, Homo habilis,

98
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and Australopithecus -- now called Paranthropus boisei,

99
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
the robust australopithecine. Three extinct species, same place, same time.

100
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
That means that not all three could be my direct ancestor.

101
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Which one of these guys am I actually related to?

102
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Possibilities about our ancestry, but not the probabilities that we're really looking for.

103
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Well, a different approach has been to look at morphology in humans

104
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
using the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently --

105
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
again, largely skull shape.

106
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
The first person to do this systematically was Linnaeus,

107
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Carl von Linne, a Swedish botanist,

108
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
who in the eighteenth century took it upon himself

109
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
to categorize every living organism on the planet.

110
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
You think you've got a tough job?

111
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And he did a pretty good job.

112
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
He categorized about 12,000 species in "Systema Naturae."

113
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
He actually coined the term Homo sapiens -- it means wise man in Latin.

114
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
But looking around the world at the diversity of humans, he said,

115
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
"Well, you know, we seem to come in discreet sub-species or categories."

116
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And he talked about Africans and Americans and Asians and Europeans,

117
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and a blatantly racist category he termed "Monstrosus,"

118
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
which basically included all the people he didn't like,

119
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
including imaginary folk like elves.

120
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It's easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well-intentioned

121
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
but ultimately benighted musings of an eighteenth century scientist

122
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
working in the pre-Darwinian era.

123
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Except, if you had taken physical anthropology

124
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
as recently as 20 or 30 years ago, in many cases you would have learned

125
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
basically that same classification of humanity.

126
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Human races that according to physical anthropologists of 30, 40 years ago --

127
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Carlton Coon is the best example --

128
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
had been diverging from each other -- this was in the post-Darwinian era --

129
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
for over a million years, since the time of Homo erectus.

130
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
But based on what data?

131
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Very little. Very little. Morphology and a lot of guesswork.

132
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Well, what I'm going to talk about today,

133
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
what I'm going to talk about now is a new approach to this problem.

134
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Instead of going out and guessing about our ancestry,

135
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
digging things up out of the ground, possible ancestors,

136
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and saying it on the basis of morphology --

137
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
which we still don't completely understand,

138
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
we don't know the genetic causes underlying this morphological variation --

139
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
what we need to do is turn the problem on its head.

140
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Because what we're really asking is a genealogical problem,

141
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
or a genealogical question.

142
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
What we're trying to do is construct a family tree for everybody alive today.

143
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And as any genealogist will tell you --

144
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
anybody have a member of the family, or maybe you

145
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
have tried to construct a family tree, trace back in time?

146
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
You start in the present, with relationships you're certain about.

147
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
You and your siblings, you have a parent in common.

148
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
You and your cousins share a grandparent in common.

149
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
You gradually trace further and further back into the past,

150
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
adding these ever more distant relationships.

151
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
But eventually, no matter how good you are at digging up the church records,

152
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and all that stuff, you hit what the genealogists call a brick wall.

153
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
A point beyond which you don't know anything else about your ancestors,

154
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and you enter this dark and mysterious realm we call history

155
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
that we have to feel our way through with whispered guidance.

156
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Who were these people who came before?

157
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
We have no written record. Well, actually, we do.

158
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Written in our DNA, in our genetic code --

159
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:57,000
we have a historical document that takes us back in time

160
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
to the very earliest days of our species. And that's what we study.

161
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Now, a quick primer on DNA.

162
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist.

163
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
It is a very long, linear molecule, a coded version

164
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
of how to make another copy of you. It's your blueprint.

165
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
It's composed of four subunits: A, C, G and T, we call them.

166
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And it's the sequence of those subunits that defines that blueprint.

167
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
How long is it? Well, it's billions of these subunits in length.

168
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
A haploid genome -- we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes --

169
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
a haploid genome is around 3.2 billion nucleotides in length.

170
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And the whole thing, if you add it all together,

171
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
is over six billion nucleotides long.

172
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
If you take all the DNA out of one cell in your body,

173
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and stretch it end to end, it's around two meters long.

174
0:08:41.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
If you take all the DNA out of every cell in your body,

175
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and you stretch it end to end, it would reach from here to the moon and back,

176
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
thousands of times. It's a lot of information.

177
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And so when you're copying this DNA molecule to pass it on, it's a pretty tough job.

178
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
Imagine the longest book you can think of, "War and Peace."

179
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Now multiply it by 100.

180
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And imagine copying that by hand.

181
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And you're working away until late at night,

182
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and you're very, very careful, and you're drinking coffee

183
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and you're paying attention, but, occasionally,

184
0:09:10.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
when you're copying this by hand,

185
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
you're going to make a little typo, a spelling mistake --

186
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
substitute an I for an E, or a C for a T.

187
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Same thing happens to our DNA as it's being passed on through the generations.

188
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
It doesn't happen very often. We have a proofreading mechanism built in.

189
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
But when it does happen, and these changes get transmitted down

190
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
through the generations, they become markers of descent.

191
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
If you share a marker with someone,

192
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
it means you share an ancestor at some point in the past,

193
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
the person who first had that change in their DNA.

194
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And it's by looking at the pattern of genetic variation,

195
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:43,000
the pattern of these markers in people all over the world,

196
0:09:43.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and assessing the relative ages when they occurred throughout our history,

197
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
that we've been able to construct a family tree for everybody alive today.

198
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
These are two pieces of DNA that we use quite widely in our work.

199
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Mitochondrial DNA, tracing a purely maternal line of descent.

200
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:59,000
You get your mtDNA from your mother, and your mother's mother,

201
0:09:59.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
all the way back to the very first woman.

202
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
The Y chromosome, the piece of DNA that makes men men,

203
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
traces a purely paternal line of descent.

204
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Everybody in this room, everybody in the world,

205
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
falls into a lineage somewhere on these trees.

206
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Now, even though these are simplified versions of the real trees,

207
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
they're still kind of complicated, so let's simplify them.

208
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Turn them on their sides, combine them so that they look like a tree

209
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
with the root at the bottom and the branches going up.

210
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
What's the take-home message?

211
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Well, the thing that jumps out at you first

212
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:32,000
is that the deepest lineages in our family trees

213
0:10:32.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
are found within Africa, among Africans.

214
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
That means that Africans have been accumulating

215
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
this mutational diversity for longer.

216
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And what that means is that we originated in Africa. It's written in our DNA.

217
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Every piece of DNA we look at has greater diversity within Africa than outside of Africa.

218
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And at some point in the past, a sub-group of Africans

219
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
left the African continent to go out and populate the rest of the world.

220
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Now, how recently do we share this ancestry?

221
0:11:01.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Was it millions of years ago, which we might suspect

222
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
by looking at all this incredible variation around the world?

223
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
No, the DNA tells a story that's very clear.

224
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Within the last 200,000 years, we all share an ancestor, a single person --

225
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Mitochondrial Eve, you might have heard about her -- in Africa,

226
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:23,000
an African woman who gave rise to all the mitochondrial diversity in the world today.

227
0:11:23.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
But what's even more amazing

228
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
is that if you look at the Y-chromosome side,

229
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
the male side of the story, the Y-chromosome Adam

230
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
only lived around 60,000 years ago.

231
0:11:33.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
That's only about 2,000 human generations,

232
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
the blink of an eye in an evolutionary sense.

233
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
That tells us we were all still living in Africa at that time.

234
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
This was an African man who gave rise

235
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
to all the Y chromosome diversity around the world.

236
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
It's only within the last 60,000 years

237
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
that we have started to generate this incredible diversity we see around the world.

238
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Such an amazing story.

239
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
We're all effectively part of an extended African family.

240
0:11:59.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Now, that seems so recent. Why didn't we start to leave earlier?

241
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Why didn't Homo erectus evolve into separate species,

242
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
or sub-species rather, human races around the world?

243
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Why was it that we seem to have come out of Africa so recently?

244
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Well, that's a big question. These "why" questions,

245
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
particularly in genetics and the study of history in general, are always the big ones,

246
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
the ones that are tough to answer.

247
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And so when all else fails, talk about the weather.

248
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
What was going on to the world's weather around 60,000 years ago?

249
0:12:27.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Well, we were going into the worst part of the last ice age.

250
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
The last ice age started roughly 120,000 years ago.

251
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
It went up and down, and it really started to accelerate around 70,000 years ago.

252
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Lots of evidence from sediment cores

253
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and the pollen types, oxygen isotopes and so on.

254
0:12:42.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
We hit the last glacial maximum around 16,000 years ago,

255
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:49,000
but basically, from 70,000 years on, things were getting really tough,

256
0:12:49.33,000 --> 0:12:54,000
getting very cold. The Northern Hemisphere had massive growing ice sheets.

257
0:12:54.33,000 --> 0:12:58,000
New York City, Chicago, Seattle, all under a sheet of ice.

258
0:12:58.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Most of Britain, all of Scandinavia, covered by ice several kilometers thick.

259
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Now, Africa is the most tropical continent on the planet --

260
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
about 85 percent of it lies between Cancer and Capricorn --

261
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and there aren't a lot of glaciers here,

262
0:13:12.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
except on the high mountains here in East Africa.

263
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
So what was going on here? We weren't covered in ice in Africa.

264
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Rather, Africa was drying out at that time.

265
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:22,000
This is a paleo-climatological map

266
0:13:22.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
of what Africa looked like between 60,000 and 70,000 years ago,

267
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
reconstructed from all these pieces of evidence that I mentioned before.

268
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
The reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere.

269
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
If you think about Antarctica, it's technically a desert, it gets so little precipitation.

270
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:39,000
So the whole world was drying out.

271
0:13:39.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
The sea levels were dropping. And Africa was turning to desert.

272
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
The Sahara was much bigger then than it is now.

273
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:49,000
And the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets,

274
0:13:49.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
compared to what we have today.

275
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
The evidence from genetic data

276
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
is that the human population around this time, roughly 70,000 years ago,

277
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
crashed to fewer than 2,000 individuals.

278
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
We nearly went extinct. We were hanging on by our fingernails.

279
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And then something happened. A great illustration of it.

280
0:14:06.33,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Look at some stone tools.

281
0:14:08.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
The ones on the left are from Africa, from around a million years ago.

282
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
The ones on the right were made by Neanderthals, our distant cousins,

283
0:14:15.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
not our direct ancestors, living in Europe,

284
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and they date from around 50,000 or 60,000 years ago.

285
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Now, at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists

286
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
or physical anthropologists in the audience,

287
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
basically there's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups.

288
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
The ones on the left are pretty similar to the ones on the right.

289
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:39,000
We are in a period of long cultural stasis from a million years ago

290
0:14:39.33,000 --> 0:14:41,000
until around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago.

291
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:43,000
The tool styles don't change that much.

292
0:14:43.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
The evidence is that the human way of life

293
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:47,000
didn't change that much during that period.

294
0:14:47.33,000 --> 0:14:52,000
But then 50, 60, 70 thousand years ago, somewhere in that region,

295
0:14:52.33,000 --> 0:14:55,000
all hell breaks loose. Art makes its appearance.

296
0:14:55.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
The stone tools become much more finely crafted.

297
0:14:58.33,000 --> 0:15:,000
The evidence is that humans begin to specialize in particular prey species,

298
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:03,000
at particular times of the year.

299
0:15:03.33,000 --> 0:15:06,000
The population size started to expand.

300
0:15:06.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Probably, according to what many linguists believe,

301
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:12,000
fully modern language, syntactic language -- subject, verb, object --

302
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:16,000
that we use to convey complex ideas, like I'm doing now, appeared around that time.

303
0:15:16.33,000 --> 0:15:2,000
We became much more social. The social networks expanded.

304
0:15:20.33,000 --> 0:15:25,000
This change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in Africa,

305
0:15:25.33,000 --> 0:15:29,000
and they allowed us to start to expand around the world.

306
0:15:30.33,000 --> 0:15:33,000
We've been talking at this conference about African success stories.

307
0:15:33.33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Well, you want the ultimate African success story?

308
0:15:36.33,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Look in the mirror. You're it. The reason you're alive today

309
0:15:39.33,000 --> 0:15:43,000
is because of those changes in our brains that took place in Africa --

310
0:15:43.33,000 --> 0:15:46,000
probably somewhere in the region where we're sitting right now,

311
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:49,000
around 60, 70 thousand years ago --

312
0:15:49.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
allowing us not only to survive in Africa, but to expand out of Africa.

313
0:15:52.33,000 --> 0:15:55,000
An early coastal migration along the south coast of Asia,

314
0:15:55.33,000 --> 0:15:57,000
leaving Africa around 60,000 years ago,

315
0:15:57.33,000 --> 0:16:01,000
reaching Australia very rapidly, by 50,000 years ago.

316
0:16:01.33,000 --> 0:16:03,000
A slightly later migration up into the Middle East.

317
0:16:03.33,000 --> 0:16:05,000
These would have been savannah hunters.

318
0:16:05.33,000 --> 0:16:07,000
So those of you who are going on one of the post-conference tours,

319
0:16:07.33,000 --> 0:16:09,000
you'll get to see what a real savannah is like.

320
0:16:09.33,000 --> 0:16:11,000
And it's basically a meat locker.

321
0:16:11.33,000 --> 0:16:14,000
People who would have specialized in killing the animals,

322
0:16:14.33,000 --> 0:16:17,000
hunting the animals on those meat locker savannahs, moving up,

323
0:16:17.33,000 --> 0:16:21,000
following the grasslands into the Middle East around 45,000 years ago,

324
0:16:21.33,000 --> 0:16:23,000
during one of the rare wet phases in the Sahara.

325
0:16:23.33,000 --> 0:16:26,000
Migrating eastward, following the grasslands,

326
0:16:26.33,000 --> 0:16:28,000
because that's what they were adapted to live on.

327
0:16:28.33,000 --> 0:16:3,000
And when they reached Central Asia,

328
0:16:30.33,000 --> 0:16:33,000
they reached what was effectively a steppe super-highway,

329
0:16:33.33,000 --> 0:16:35,000
a grassland super-highway.

330
0:16:35.33,000 --> 0:16:37,000
The grasslands at that time -- this was during the last ice age --

331
0:16:37.33,000 --> 0:16:4,000
stretched basically from Germany all the way over to Korea,

332
0:16:40.33,000 --> 0:16:42,000
and the entire continent was open to them.

333
0:16:42.33,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Entering Europe around 35,000 years ago,

334
0:16:44.33,000 --> 0:16:46,000
and finally, a small group migrating up

335
0:16:46.33,000 --> 0:16:5,000
through the worst weather imaginable, Siberia,

336
0:16:50.33,000 --> 0:16:52,000
inside the Arctic Circle, during the last ice age --

337
0:16:52.33,000 --> 0:16:56,000
temperature was at -70, -80, even -100, perhaps --

338
0:16:56.33,000 --> 0:17:,000
migrating into the Americas, ultimately reaching that final frontier.

339
0:17:00.33,000 --> 0:17:04,000
An amazing story, and it happened first in Africa.

340
0:17:04.33,000 --> 0:17:06,000
The changes that allowed us to do that,

341
0:17:06.33,000 --> 0:17:09,000
the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us,

342
0:17:09.33,000 --> 0:17:11,000
allowing us to create novel cultures,

343
0:17:11.33,000 --> 0:17:14,000
allowing us to develop the diversity

344
0:17:14.33,000 --> 0:17:17,000
that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one I've just been on.

345
0:17:18.33,000 --> 0:17:22,000
Now, that story I just told you is literally a whirlwind tour

346
0:17:22.33,000 --> 0:17:27,000
of how we populated the world, the great Paleolithic wanderings of our species.

347
0:17:27.33,000 --> 0:17:29,000
And that's the story that I told a couple of years ago

348
0:17:29.33,000 --> 0:17:33,000
in my book, "The Journey of Man," and a film that we made with the same title.

349
0:17:33.33,000 --> 0:17:36,000
And as we were finishing up that film --

350
0:17:36.33,000 --> 0:17:38,000
it was co-produced with National Geographic --

351
0:17:38.33,000 --> 0:17:41,000
I started talking to the folks at NG about this work.

352
0:17:41.33,000 --> 0:17:45,000
And they got really excited about it. They liked the film, but they said,

353
0:17:45.33,000 --> 0:17:47,000
"You know, we really see this as kind of

354
0:17:47.33,000 --> 0:17:51,000
the next wave in the study of human origins, where we all came from,

355
0:17:51.33,000 --> 0:17:56,000
using the tools of DNA to map the migrations around the world.

356
0:17:56.33,000 --> 0:17:58,000
You know, the study of human origins is kind of in our DNA,

357
0:17:58.33,000 --> 0:18:,000
and we want to take it to the next level.

358
0:18:00.33,000 --> 0:18:02,000
What do you want to do next?"

359
0:18:02.33,000 --> 0:18:04,000
Which is a great question to be asked by National Geographic.

360
0:18:04.33,000 --> 0:18:08,000
And I said, "Well, you know, what I've sketched out here is just that.

361
0:18:08.33,000 --> 0:18:12,000
It is a very coarse sketch of how we migrated around the planet.

362
0:18:12.33,000 --> 0:18:15,000
And it's based on a few thousand people we've sampled from,

363
0:18:15.33,000 --> 0:18:17,000
you know, a handful of populations around the world.

364
0:18:17.33,000 --> 0:18:21,000
Studied a few genetic markers, and there are lots of gaps on this map.

365
0:18:21.33,000 --> 0:18:23,000
We've just connected the dots. What we need to do

366
0:18:23.33,000 --> 0:18:27,000
is increase our sample size by an order of magnitude or more --

367
0:18:27.33,000 --> 0:18:31,000
hundreds of thousands of DNA samples from people all over the world."

368
0:18:31.33,000 --> 0:18:34,000
And that was the genesis of the Genographic Project.

369
0:18:34.33,000 --> 0:18:37,000
The project launched in April 2005.

370
0:18:37.33,000 --> 0:18:41,000
It has three core components. Obviously, science is a big part of it.

371
0:18:41.33,000 --> 0:18:44,000
The field research that we're doing around the world with indigenous peoples.

372
0:18:44.33,000 --> 0:18:47,000
People who have lived in the same location for a long period of time

373
0:18:47.33,000 --> 0:18:49,000
retain a connection to the place where they live

374
0:18:49.33,000 --> 0:18:51,000
that many of the rest of us have lost.

375
0:18:52.33,000 --> 0:18:54,000
So my ancestors come from all over northern Europe.

376
0:18:54.33,000 --> 0:18:57,000
I live in the Eastern Seaboard of North America when I'm not traveling.

377
0:18:57.33,000 --> 0:19:,000
Where am I indigenous to? Nowhere really. My genes are all jumbled up.

378
0:19:00.33,000 --> 0:19:03,000
But there are people who retain that link to their ancestors

379
0:19:03.33,000 --> 0:19:06,000
that allows us to contextualize the DNA results.

380
0:19:06.33,000 --> 0:19:08,000
That's the focus of the field research,

381
0:19:08.33,000 --> 0:19:1,000
the centers that we've set up all over the world --

382
0:19:10.33,000 --> 0:19:13,000
10 of them, top population geneticists.

383
0:19:13.33,000 --> 0:19:16,000
But, in addition, we wanted to open up this study to anybody around the world.

384
0:19:16.33,000 --> 0:19:2,000
How often do you get to participate in a big scientific project?

385
0:19:20.33,000 --> 0:19:22,000
The Human Genome Project, or a Mars Rover mission.

386
0:19:22.33,000 --> 0:19:24,000
In this case, you actually can.

387
0:19:24.33,000 --> 0:19:28,000
You can go onto our website, Nationalgeographic.com/genographic.

388
0:19:28.33,000 --> 0:19:31,000
You can order a kit. You can test your own DNA.

389
0:19:31.33,000 --> 0:19:34,000
And you can actually submit those results to the database,

390
0:19:34.33,000 --> 0:19:36,000
and tell us a little about your genealogical background,

391
0:19:36.33,000 --> 0:19:4,000
have the data analyzed as part of the scientific effort.

392
0:19:40.33,000 --> 0:19:44,000
Now, this is all a nonprofit enterprise, and so the money that we raise,

393
0:19:44.33,000 --> 0:19:47,000
after we cover the cost of doing the testing and making the kit components,

394
0:19:47.33,000 --> 0:19:49,000
gets plowed back into the project.

395
0:19:49.33,000 --> 0:19:51,000
The majority going to something we call the Legacy Fund.

396
0:19:51.33,000 --> 0:19:55,000
It's a charitable entity, basically a grant-giving entity

397
0:19:55.33,000 --> 0:19:57,000
that gives money back to indigenous groups around the world

398
0:19:57.33,000 --> 0:20:01,000
for educational, cultural projects initiated by them.

399
0:20:01.33,000 --> 0:20:03,000
They apply to this fund in order to do various projects,

400
0:20:03.33,000 --> 0:20:05,000
and I'll show you a couple of examples.

401
0:20:05.33,000 --> 0:20:08,000
So how are we doing on the project? We've got about 25,000 samples

402
0:20:08.33,000 --> 0:20:1,000
collected from indigenous people around the world.

403
0:20:10.33,000 --> 0:20:13,000
The most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public;

404
0:20:13.33,000 --> 0:20:16,000
210,000 people have ordered these participation kits

405
0:20:16.33,000 --> 0:20:18,000
since we launched two years ago,

406
0:20:18.33,000 --> 0:20:21,000
which has raised around five million dollars,

407
0:20:21.33,000 --> 0:20:24,000
the majority of which, at least half, is going back into the Legacy Fund.

408
0:20:24.33,000 --> 0:20:28,000
We've just awarded the first Legacy Grants totaling around 500,000 dollars.

409
0:20:28.33,000 --> 0:20:31,000
Projects around the world -- documenting oral poetry in Sierra Leone,

410
0:20:31.33,000 --> 0:20:34,000
preserving traditional weaving patterns in Gaza,

411
0:20:34.33,000 --> 0:20:37,000
language revitalization in Tajikistan, etc., etc.

412
0:20:37.33,000 --> 0:20:4,000
So the project is going very, very well,

413
0:20:40.33,000 --> 0:20:44,000
and I urge you to check out the website and watch this space.

414
0:20:44.33,000 --> 0:20:46,000
Thank you very much.

415
0:20:46.33,000 --> 0:20:48,000
(Applause)

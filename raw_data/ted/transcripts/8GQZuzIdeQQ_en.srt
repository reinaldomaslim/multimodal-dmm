1
0:00:12.817,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Think of a hard choice you'll face in the near future.

2
0:00:16.391,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It might be between two careers --

3
0:00:18.236,000 --> 0:00:19,000
artist and accountant --

4
0:00:20.286,000 --> 0:00:22,000
or places to live -- the city or the country --

5
0:00:23.123,000 --> 0:00:24,000
or even between two people to marry --

6
0:00:25.021,000 --> 0:00:27,000
you could marry Betty or you could marry Lolita.

7
0:00:28.572,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Or it might be a choice about whether to have children,

8
0:00:31.589,000 --> 0:00:33,000
to have an ailing parent move in with you,

9
0:00:33.96,000 --> 0:00:36,000
to raise your child in a religion that your partner lives by

10
0:00:37.201,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but leaves you cold.

11
0:00:39.236,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Or whether to donate your life savings to charity.

12
0:00:42.622,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Chances are, the hard choice you thought of was something big,

13
0:00:45.56,000 --> 0:00:47,000
something momentous, something that matters to you.

14
0:00:48.763,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Hard choices seem to be occasions

15
0:00:51.053,000 --> 0:00:54,000
for agonizing, hand-wringing, the gnashing of teeth.

16
0:00:56.073,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But I think we've misunderstood hard choices

17
0:00:58.162,000 --> 0:01:,000
and the role they play in our lives.

18
0:01:00.253,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Understanding hard choices

19
0:01:02.155,000 --> 0:01:05,000
uncovers a hidden power each of us possesses.

20
0:01:06.972,000 --> 0:01:09,000
What makes a choice hard is the way the alternatives relate.

21
0:01:10.909,000 --> 0:01:11,000
In any easy choice,

22
0:01:12.383,000 --> 0:01:14,000
one alternative is better than the other.

23
0:01:14.91,000 --> 0:01:15,000
In a hard choice,

24
0:01:16.403,000 --> 0:01:18,000
one alternative is better in some ways,

25
0:01:18.955,000 --> 0:01:2,000
the other alternative is better in other ways,

26
0:01:21.18,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and neither is better than the other overall.

27
0:01:24.732,000 --> 0:01:28,000
You agonize over whether to stay in your current job in the city

28
0:01:29.003,000 --> 0:01:33,000
or uproot your life for more challenging work in the country,

29
0:01:33.479,000 --> 0:01:35,000
because staying is better in some ways,

30
0:01:35.705,000 --> 0:01:36,000
moving is better in others,

31
0:01:37.329,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and neither is better than the other overall.

32
0:01:41.368,000 --> 0:01:44,000
We shouldn't think that all hard choices are big.

33
0:01:45.023,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Let's say you're deciding what to have for breakfast.

34
0:01:47.654,000 --> 0:01:49,000
You could have high fiber bran cereal

35
0:01:50.534,000 --> 0:01:51,000
or a chocolate donut.

36
0:01:52.199,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Suppose what matters in the choice is tastiness and healthfulness.

37
0:01:56.563,000 --> 0:01:58,000
The cereal is better for you,

38
0:01:58.829,000 --> 0:02:,000
the donut tastes way better,

39
0:02:01.01,000 --> 0:02:03,000
but neither is better than the other overall,

40
0:02:03.236,000 --> 0:02:04,000
a hard choice.

41
0:02:05.348,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Realizing that small choices can also be hard,

42
0:02:09.372,000 --> 0:02:12,000
may make big hard choices seem less intractable.

43
0:02:13.563,000 --> 0:02:15,000
After all, we manage to figure out what to have for breakfast,

44
0:02:16.493,000 --> 0:02:19,000
so maybe we can figure out whether to stay in the city

45
0:02:19.648,000 --> 0:02:21,000
or uproot for the new job in the country.

46
0:02:23.789,000 --> 0:02:27,000
We also shouldn't think that hard choices are hard

47
0:02:28.365,000 --> 0:02:29,000
because we are stupid.

48
0:02:30.692,000 --> 0:02:31,000
When I graduated from college,

49
0:02:32.632,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I couldn't decide between two careers, philosophy and law.

50
0:02:36.158,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I really loved philosophy.

51
0:02:39.6,000 --> 0:02:41,000
There are amazing things you can learn as a philosopher,

52
0:02:42.576,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and all from the comfort of an armchair.

53
0:02:46.106,000 --> 0:02:48,000
But I came from a modest immigrant family

54
0:02:49.008,000 --> 0:02:5,000
where my idea of luxury

55
0:02:50.481,000 --> 0:02:52,000
was having a pork tongue and jelly sandwich

56
0:02:52.99,000 --> 0:02:53,000
in my school lunchbox,

57
0:02:55.232,000 --> 0:02:57,000
so the thought of spending my whole life

58
0:02:57.621,000 --> 0:02:59,000
sitting around in armchairs just thinking ...

59
0:03:01.335,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Well, that struck me as the height of extravagance and frivolity.

60
0:03:05.357,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So I got out my yellow pad,

61
0:03:07.127,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I drew a line down the middle,

62
0:03:09.034,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and I tried my best to think of the reasons

63
0:03:11.455,000 --> 0:03:13,000
for and against each alternative.

64
0:03:15.199,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I remember thinking to myself,

65
0:03:17.413,000 --> 0:03:21,000
if only I knew what my life in each career would be like.

66
0:03:22.428,000 --> 0:03:27,000
If only God or Netflix would send me a DVD of my two possible future careers,

67
0:03:28.439,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I'd be set.

68
0:03:29.635,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I'd compare them side by side,

69
0:03:31.561,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I'd see that one was better,

70
0:03:33.492,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and the choice would be easy.

71
0:03:35.867,000 --> 0:03:36,000
But I got no DVD,

72
0:03:37.976,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and because I couldn't figure out which was better,

73
0:03:40.843,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I did what many of us do in hard choices:

74
0:03:43.58,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I took the safest option.

75
0:03:46.466,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Fear of being an unemployed philosopher led me to become a lawyer,

76
0:03:52.256,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and as I discovered, lawyering didn't quite fit.

77
0:03:55.61,000 --> 0:03:56,000
It wasn't who I was.

78
0:03:57.889,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So now I'm a philosopher,

79
0:03:59.527,000 --> 0:04:,000
and I study hard choices,

80
0:04:01.489,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and I can tell you, that fear of the unknown,

81
0:04:04.838,000 --> 0:04:08,000
while a common motivational default in dealing with hard choices,

82
0:04:09.958,000 --> 0:04:11,000
rests on a misconception of them.

83
0:04:12.505,000 --> 0:04:14,000
It's a mistake to think that in hard choices,

84
0:04:15.459,000 --> 0:04:17,000
one alternative really is better than the other,

85
0:04:18.477,000 --> 0:04:19,000
but we're too stupid to know which,

86
0:04:20.46,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and since we don't know which,

87
0:04:21.927,000 --> 0:04:23,000
we might as well take the least risky option.

88
0:04:24.825,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Even taking two alternatives side by side

89
0:04:27.207,000 --> 0:04:3,000
with full information, a choice can still be hard.

90
0:04:32.099,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Hard choices are hard not because of us or our ignorance;

91
0:04:36.179,000 --> 0:04:39,000
they're hard because there is no best option.

92
0:04:41.231,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Now, if there's no best option,

93
0:04:43.179,000 --> 0:04:47,000
if the scales don't tip in favor of one alternative over another,

94
0:04:48.06,000 --> 0:04:5,000
then surely the alternatives must be equally good.

95
0:04:51.797,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So maybe the right thing to say in hard choices

96
0:04:54.092,000 --> 0:04:56,000
is that they're between equally good options.

97
0:04:56.77,000 --> 0:04:57,000
But that can't be right.

98
0:04:57.955,000 --> 0:05:,000
If alternatives are equally good, you should just flip a coin between them,

99
0:05:01.898,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and it seems a mistake to think,

100
0:05:04.333,000 --> 0:05:06,000
here's how you should decide between careers,

101
0:05:06.907,000 --> 0:05:07,000
places to live, people to marry:

102
0:05:08.501,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Flip a coin.

103
0:05:11.156,000 --> 0:05:12,000
There's another reason for thinking

104
0:05:12.891,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that hard choices aren't choices between equally good options.

105
0:05:18.063,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Suppose you have a choice between two jobs:

106
0:05:21.744,000 --> 0:05:23,000
you could be an investment banker

107
0:05:24.708,000 --> 0:05:25,000
or a graphic artist.

108
0:05:27.22,000 --> 0:05:29,000
There are a variety of things that matter in such a choice,

109
0:05:30.036,000 --> 0:05:32,000
like the excitement of the work,

110
0:05:32.615,000 --> 0:05:33,000
achieving financial security,

111
0:05:34.376,000 --> 0:05:36,000
having time to raise a family, and so on.

112
0:05:36.75,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Maybe the artist's career puts you on the cutting edge

113
0:05:41.209,000 --> 0:05:43,000
of new forms of pictorial expression.

114
0:05:44.049,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Maybe the banking career puts you on the cutting edge

115
0:05:46.869,000 --> 0:05:49,000
of new forms of financial manipulation.

116
0:05:50.012,000 --> 0:05:51,000
(Laughter)

117
0:05:51.62,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Imagine the two jobs however you like,

118
0:05:54.584,000 --> 0:05:55,000
so that neither is better than the other.

119
0:05:57.696,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Now suppose we improve one of them, a bit.

120
0:06:00.673,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Suppose the bank, wooing you,

121
0:06:03.612,000 --> 0:06:05,000
adds 500 dollars a month to your salary.

122
0:06:06.432,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Does the extra money

123
0:06:07.806,000 --> 0:06:11,000
now make the banking job better than the artist one?

124
0:06:12.94,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Not necessarily.

125
0:06:15.049,000 --> 0:06:19,000
A higher salary makes the banking job better than it was before,

126
0:06:19.18,000 --> 0:06:2,000
but it might not be enough

127
0:06:20.822,000 --> 0:06:23,000
to make being a banker better than being an artist.

128
0:06:25.299,000 --> 0:06:29,000
But if an improvement in one of the jobs doesn't make it better than the other,

129
0:06:29.79,000 --> 0:06:32,000
then the two original jobs could not have been equally good.

130
0:06:33.812,000 --> 0:06:35,000
If you start with two things that are equally good,

131
0:06:36.233,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and you improve one of them,

132
0:06:37.598,000 --> 0:06:39,000
it now must be better than the other.

133
0:06:40.653,000 --> 0:06:42,000
That's not the case with options in hard choices.

134
0:06:45.393,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So now we've got a puzzle.

135
0:06:47.755,000 --> 0:06:48,000
We've got two jobs.

136
0:06:49.387,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Neither is better than the other, nor are they equally good.

137
0:06:53.526,000 --> 0:06:55,000
So how are we supposed to choose?

138
0:06:55.955,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Something seems to have gone wrong here.

139
0:07:00.303,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Maybe the choice itself is problematic, and comparison is impossible.

140
0:07:06.184,000 --> 0:07:07,000
But that can't be right.

141
0:07:07.748,000 --> 0:07:1,000
It's not like we're trying to choose between two things that can't be compared.

142
0:07:12.234,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We're weighing the merits of two jobs, after all,

143
0:07:15.135,000 --> 0:07:18,000
not the merits of the number nine and a plate of fried eggs.

144
0:07:20.052,000 --> 0:07:23,000
A comparison of the overall merits of two jobs

145
0:07:23.42,000 --> 0:07:24,000
is something we can make,

146
0:07:25.331,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and one we often do make.

147
0:07:29.407,000 --> 0:07:31,000
I think the puzzle arises

148
0:07:31.487,000 --> 0:07:34,000
because of an unreflective assumption we make about value.

149
0:07:35.995,000 --> 0:07:4,000
We unwittingly assume that values like justice, beauty, kindness,

150
0:07:42.006,000 --> 0:07:47,000
are akin to scientific quantities, like length, mass and weight.

151
0:07:49.247,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Take any comparative question not involving value,

152
0:07:52.362,000 --> 0:07:54,000
such as which of two suitcases is heavier.

153
0:07:55.907,000 --> 0:07:57,000
There are only three possibilities.

154
0:07:58.648,000 --> 0:08:03,000
The weight of one is greater, lesser or equal to the weight of the other.

155
0:08:04.605,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Properties like weight can be represented by real numbers --

156
0:08:07.803,000 --> 0:08:08,000
one, two, three and so on --

157
0:08:09.765,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and there are only three possible comparisons

158
0:08:12.847,000 --> 0:08:13,000
between any two real numbers.

159
0:08:15.24,000 --> 0:08:18,000
One number is greater, lesser, or equal to the other.

160
0:08:20.475,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Not so with values.

161
0:08:23.44,000 --> 0:08:24,000
As post-Enlightenment creatures,

162
0:08:25.291,000 --> 0:08:26,000
we tend to assume

163
0:08:27.265,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that scientific thinking holds the key to everything of importance in our world,

164
0:08:33.05,000 --> 0:08:36,000
but the world of value is different from the world of science.

165
0:08:36.64,000 --> 0:08:39,000
The stuff of the one world can be quantified by real numbers.

166
0:08:40.252,000 --> 0:08:42,000
The stuff of the other world can't.

167
0:08:43.712,000 --> 0:08:47,000
We shouldn't assume that the world of is, of lengths and weights,

168
0:08:48.008,000 --> 0:08:5,000
has the same structure as the world of ought,

169
0:08:50.939,000 --> 0:08:51,000
of what we should do.

170
0:08:52.904,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So if what matters to us --

171
0:08:55.009,000 --> 0:08:58,000
a child's delight, the love you have for your partner —

172
0:08:58.547,000 --> 0:09:,000
can't be represented by real numbers,

173
0:09:01.375,000 --> 0:09:02,000
then there's no reason to believe

174
0:09:03.341,000 --> 0:09:06,000
that in choice, there are only three possibilities --

175
0:09:07.181,000 --> 0:09:1,000
that one alternative is better, worse or equal to the other.

176
0:09:12.464,000 --> 0:09:16,000
We need to introduce a new, fourth relation

177
0:09:16.73,000 --> 0:09:19,000
beyond being better, worse or equal,

178
0:09:20.369,000 --> 0:09:23,000
that describes what's going on in hard choices.

179
0:09:23.96,000 --> 0:09:25,000
I like to say that the alternatives are "on a par."

180
0:09:27.151,000 --> 0:09:28,000
When alternatives are on a par,

181
0:09:29.075,000 --> 0:09:32,000
it may matter very much which you choose,

182
0:09:32.465,000 --> 0:09:34,000
but one alternative isn't better than the other.

183
0:09:35.404,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Rather, the alternatives are in the same neighborhood of value,

184
0:09:39.806,000 --> 0:09:41,000
in the same league of value,

185
0:09:41.877,000 --> 0:09:45,000
while at the same time being very different in kind of value.

186
0:09:46.444,000 --> 0:09:48,000
That's why the choice is hard.

187
0:09:49.754,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Understanding hard choices in this way

188
0:09:52.187,000 --> 0:09:55,000
uncovers something about ourselves we didn't know.

189
0:09:56.266,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Each of us has the power to create reasons.

190
0:10:02.172,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Imagine a world in which every choice you face

191
0:10:05.51,000 --> 0:10:06,000
is an easy choice,

192
0:10:06.907,000 --> 0:10:08,000
that is, there's always a best alternative.

193
0:10:09.207,000 --> 0:10:12,000
If there's a best alternative, then that's the one you should choose,

194
0:10:12.614,000 --> 0:10:13,000
because part of being rational

195
0:10:14.4,000 --> 0:10:16,000
is doing the better thing rather than the worse thing,

196
0:10:17.139,000 --> 0:10:19,000
choosing what you have most reason to choose.

197
0:10:20.567,000 --> 0:10:21,000
In such a world,

198
0:10:22.297,000 --> 0:10:24,000
we'd have most reason

199
0:10:24.722,000 --> 0:10:26,000
to wear black socks instead of pink socks,

200
0:10:27.193,000 --> 0:10:28,000
to eat cereal instead of donuts,

201
0:10:29.153,000 --> 0:10:31,000
to live in the city rather than the country,

202
0:10:31.231,000 --> 0:10:32,000
to marry Betty instead of Lolita.

203
0:10:33.126,000 --> 0:10:38,000
A world full of only easy choices would enslave us to reasons.

204
0:10:39.963,000 --> 0:10:4,000
When you think about it,

205
0:10:41.29,000 --> 0:10:42,000
(Laughter)

206
0:10:42.504,000 --> 0:10:47,000
it's nuts to believe that the reasons given to you

207
0:10:48.235,000 --> 0:10:52,000
dictated that you had most reason to pursue

208
0:10:53.006,000 --> 0:10:54,000
the exact hobbies you do,

209
0:10:55.952,000 --> 0:10:57,000
to live in the exact house you do,

210
0:10:58.173,000 --> 0:10:59,000
to work at the exact job you do.

211
0:11:01.471,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Instead, you faced alternatives that were on a par --

212
0:11:05.959,000 --> 0:11:06,000
hard choices --

213
0:11:07.149,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and you made reasons for yourself

214
0:11:10.186,000 --> 0:11:13,000
to choose that hobby, that house and that job.

215
0:11:15.004,000 --> 0:11:17,000
When alternatives are on a par,

216
0:11:17.261,000 --> 0:11:18,000
the reasons given to us,

217
0:11:18.813,000 --> 0:11:2,000
the ones that determine whether we're making a mistake,

218
0:11:21.793,000 --> 0:11:23,000
are silent as to what to do.

219
0:11:24.989,000 --> 0:11:27,000
It's here, in the space of hard choices,

220
0:11:28.702,000 --> 0:11:31,000
that we get to exercise our normative power --

221
0:11:33.28,000 --> 0:11:35,000
the power to create reasons for yourself,

222
0:11:35.816,000 --> 0:11:39,000
to make yourself into the kind of person

223
0:11:40.226,000 --> 0:11:43,000
for whom country living is preferable to the urban life.

224
0:11:45.337,000 --> 0:11:48,000
When we choose between options that are on a par,

225
0:11:48.743,000 --> 0:11:51,000
we can do something really rather remarkable.

226
0:11:52.495,000 --> 0:11:54,000
We can put our very selves behind an option.

227
0:11:56.325,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Here's where I stand.

228
0:11:58.91,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Here's who I am, I am for banking.

229
0:12:02.132,000 --> 0:12:04,000
I am for chocolate donuts.

230
0:12:04.291,000 --> 0:12:05,000
(Laughter)

231
0:12:06.37,000 --> 0:12:1,000
This response in hard choices is a rational response,

232
0:12:10.721,000 --> 0:12:12,000
but it's not dictated by reasons given to us.

233
0:12:13.421,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Rather, it's supported by reasons created by us.

234
0:12:19.765,000 --> 0:12:21,000
When we create reasons for ourselves

235
0:12:22.356,000 --> 0:12:25,000
to become this kind of person rather than that,

236
0:12:25.646,000 --> 0:12:28,000
we wholeheartedly become the people that we are.

237
0:12:29.62,000 --> 0:12:32,000
You might say that we become the authors of our own lives.

238
0:12:35.047,000 --> 0:12:39,000
So when we face hard choices, we shouldn't beat our head against a wall

239
0:12:39.668,000 --> 0:12:41,000
trying to figure out which alternative is better.

240
0:12:42.045,000 --> 0:12:43,000
There is no best alternative.

241
0:12:44.502,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Instead of looking for reasons out there,

242
0:12:47.062,000 --> 0:12:49,000
we should be looking for reasons in here:

243
0:12:49.823,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Who am I to be?

244
0:12:52.278,000 --> 0:12:55,000
You might decide to be a pink sock-wearing,

245
0:12:55.744,000 --> 0:12:58,000
cereal-loving, country-living banker,

246
0:12:59.657,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and I might decide to be a black sock-wearing,

247
0:13:02.873,000 --> 0:13:04,000
urban, donut-loving artist.

248
0:13:06.132,000 --> 0:13:1,000
What we do in hard choices is very much up to each of us.

249
0:13:12.887,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Now, people who don't exercise their normative powers in hard choices

250
0:13:17.736,000 --> 0:13:18,000
are drifters.

251
0:13:19.513,000 --> 0:13:2,000
We all know people like that.

252
0:13:21.125,000 --> 0:13:23,000
I drifted into being a lawyer.

253
0:13:23.445,000 --> 0:13:25,000
I didn't put my agency behind lawyering.

254
0:13:25.603,000 --> 0:13:26,000
I wasn't for lawyering.

255
0:13:28.542,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Drifters allow the world to write the story of their lives.

256
0:13:33.439,000 --> 0:13:36,000
They let mechanisms of reward and punishment --

257
0:13:37.291,000 --> 0:13:4,000
pats on the head, fear, the easiness of an option --

258
0:13:41.23,000 --> 0:13:42,000
to determine what they do.

259
0:13:43.936,000 --> 0:13:44,000
So the lesson of hard choices:

260
0:13:46.373,000 --> 0:13:5,000
reflect on what you can put your agency behind,

261
0:13:50.861,000 --> 0:13:52,000
on what you can be for,

262
0:13:53.53,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and through hard choices,

263
0:13:55.769,000 --> 0:13:56,000
become that person.

264
0:13:59.199,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Far from being sources of agony and dread,

265
0:14:02.056,000 --> 0:14:05,000
hard choices are precious opportunities

266
0:14:05.432,000 --> 0:14:08,000
for us to celebrate what is special about the human condition,

267
0:14:09.37,000 --> 0:14:13,000
that the reasons that govern our choices as correct or incorrect

268
0:14:13.997,000 --> 0:14:14,000
sometimes run out,

269
0:14:15.687,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and it is here, in the space of hard choices,

270
0:14:18.786,000 --> 0:14:22,000
that we have the power to create reasons for ourselves

271
0:14:22.927,000 --> 0:14:24,000
to become the distinctive people that we are.

272
0:14:26.496,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And that's why hard choices are not a curse

273
0:14:29.246,000 --> 0:14:3,000
but a godsend.

274
0:14:30.967,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Thank you.

275
0:14:32.162,000 --> 0:14:35,000
(Applause)

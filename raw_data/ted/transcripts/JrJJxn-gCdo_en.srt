1
0:00:12.864,000 --> 0:00:14,000
We live in a very complex environment:

2
0:00:15.187,000 --> 0:00:16,000
complexity and dynamism

3
0:00:17.091,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and patterns of evidence

4
0:00:19.154,000 --> 0:00:21,000
from satellite photographs, from videos.

5
0:00:22.039,000 --> 0:00:25,000
You can even see it outside your window.

6
0:00:25.05,000 --> 0:00:28,000
It's endlessly complex, but somehow familiar,

7
0:00:28.91,000 --> 0:00:29,000
but the patterns kind of repeat,

8
0:00:30.87,000 --> 0:00:32,000
but they never repeat exactly.

9
0:00:33.36,000 --> 0:00:37,000
It's a huge challenge to understand.

10
0:00:37.487,000 --> 0:00:39,000
The patterns that you see

11
0:00:39.619,000 --> 0:00:42,000
are there at all of the different scales,

12
0:00:43.339,000 --> 0:00:45,000
but you can't chop it into one little bit and say,

13
0:00:46.245,000 --> 0:00:48,000
"Oh, well let me just make a smaller climate."

14
0:00:48.908,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I can't use the normal products of reductionism

15
0:00:53.12,000 --> 0:00:55,000
to get a smaller and smaller thing that I can study

16
0:00:55.842,000 --> 0:00:57,000
in a laboratory and say, "Oh,

17
0:00:58.15,000 --> 0:01:,000
now that's something I now understand."

18
0:01:00.546,000 --> 0:01:03,000
It's the whole or it's nothing.

19
0:01:03.913,000 --> 0:01:05,000
The different scales that give you

20
0:01:06.465,000 --> 0:01:08,000
these kinds of patterns

21
0:01:08.587,000 --> 0:01:11,000
range over an enormous range of magnitude,

22
0:01:12.044,000 --> 0:01:14,000
roughly 14 orders of magnitude,

23
0:01:14.46,000 --> 0:01:16,000
from the small microscopic particles

24
0:01:16.951,000 --> 0:01:18,000
that seed clouds

25
0:01:19.327,000 --> 0:01:21,000
to the size of the planet itself,

26
0:01:21.887,000 --> 0:01:22,000
from 10 to the minus six

27
0:01:23.163,000 --> 0:01:24,000
to 10 to the eight,

28
0:01:24.24,000 --> 0:01:26,000
14 orders of spatial magnitude.

29
0:01:26.532,000 --> 0:01:29,000
In time, from milliseconds to millennia,

30
0:01:29.943,000 --> 0:01:32,000
again around 14 orders of magnitude.

31
0:01:32.998,000 --> 0:01:33,000
What does that mean?

32
0:01:34.385,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Okay, well if you think about how

33
0:01:36.324,000 --> 0:01:38,000
you can calculate these things,

34
0:01:38.984,000 --> 0:01:39,000
you can take what you can see,

35
0:01:40.944,000 --> 0:01:41,000
okay, I'm going to chop it up

36
0:01:41.97,000 --> 0:01:42,000
into lots of little boxes,

37
0:01:43.349,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and that's the result of physics, right?

38
0:01:45.704,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And if I think about a weather model,

39
0:01:47.429,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that spans about five orders of magnitude,

40
0:01:49.923,000 --> 0:01:52,000
from the planet to a few kilometers,

41
0:01:53.05,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and the time scale

42
0:01:54.588,000 --> 0:01:58,000
from a few minutes to 10 days, maybe a month.

43
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:,000
We're interested in more than that.

44
0:02:00.395,000 --> 0:02:01,000
We're interested in the climate.

45
0:02:01.7,000 --> 0:02:03,000
That's years, that's millennia,

46
0:02:03.841,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and we need to go to even smaller scales.

47
0:02:06.414,000 --> 0:02:07,000
The stuff that we can't resolve,

48
0:02:08.015,000 --> 0:02:09,000
the sub-scale processes,

49
0:02:09.98,000 --> 0:02:1,000
we need to approximate in some way.

50
0:02:11.96,000 --> 0:02:12,000
That is a huge challenge.

51
0:02:13.722,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Climate models in the 1990s

52
0:02:15.91,000 --> 0:02:16,000
took an even smaller chunk of that,

53
0:02:17.88,000 --> 0:02:19,000
only about three orders of magnitude.

54
0:02:19.898,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Climate models in the 2010s,

55
0:02:21.993,000 --> 0:02:22,000
kind of what we're working with now,

56
0:02:23.767,000 --> 0:02:25,000
four orders of magnitude.

57
0:02:26.707,000 --> 0:02:28,000
We have 14 to go,

58
0:02:29.01,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and we're increasing our capability

59
0:02:31.21,000 --> 0:02:32,000
of simulating those at about

60
0:02:33.08,000 --> 0:02:36,000
one extra order of magnitude every decade.

61
0:02:36.626,000 --> 0:02:37,000
One extra order of magnitude in space

62
0:02:38.521,000 --> 0:02:41,000
is 10,000 times more calculations.

63
0:02:41.77,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And we keep adding more things,

64
0:02:44.15,000 --> 0:02:46,000
more questions to these different models.

65
0:02:46.524,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So what does a climate model look like?

66
0:02:49.257,000 --> 0:02:51,000
This is an old climate model, admittedly,

67
0:02:51.598,000 --> 0:02:55,000
a punch card, a single line of Fortran code.

68
0:02:55.678,000 --> 0:02:56,000
We no longer use punch cards.

69
0:02:57.656,000 --> 0:02:59,000
We do still use Fortran.

70
0:02:59.897,000 --> 0:03:,000
New-fangled ideas like C

71
0:03:01.854,000 --> 0:03:04,000
really haven't had a big impact

72
0:03:05.089,000 --> 0:03:07,000
on the climate modeling community.

73
0:03:07.456,000 --> 0:03:08,000
But how do we go about doing it?

74
0:03:08.856,000 --> 0:03:12,000
How do we go from that complexity that you saw

75
0:03:13.48,000 --> 0:03:15,000
to a line of code?

76
0:03:16.01,000 --> 0:03:17,000
We do it one piece at a time.

77
0:03:17.583,000 --> 0:03:18,000
This is a picture of sea ice

78
0:03:19.461,000 --> 0:03:21,000
taken flying over the Arctic.

79
0:03:21.559,000 --> 0:03:23,000
We can look at all of the different equations

80
0:03:23.597,000 --> 0:03:26,000
that go into making the ice grow

81
0:03:26.709,000 --> 0:03:28,000
or melt or change shape.

82
0:03:28.823,000 --> 0:03:29,000
We can look at the fluxes.

83
0:03:29.954,000 --> 0:03:3,000
We can look at the rate at which

84
0:03:31.906,000 --> 0:03:33,000
snow turns to ice, and we can code that.

85
0:03:34.751,000 --> 0:03:36,000
We can encapsulate that in code.

86
0:03:37.08,000 --> 0:03:38,000
These models are around

87
0:03:38.306,000 --> 0:03:4,000
a million lines of code at this point,

88
0:03:40.389,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and growing by tens of thousands of lines of code

89
0:03:43.859,000 --> 0:03:44,000
every year.

90
0:03:45.05,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So you can look at that piece,

91
0:03:46.703,000 --> 0:03:47,000
but you can look at the other pieces too.

92
0:03:48.625,000 --> 0:03:49,000
What happens when you have clouds?

93
0:03:50.558,000 --> 0:03:52,000
What happens when clouds form,

94
0:03:52.717,000 --> 0:03:53,000
when they dissipate, when they rain out?

95
0:03:54.599,000 --> 0:03:55,000
That's another piece.

96
0:03:56.341,000 --> 0:03:57,000
What happens when we have radiation

97
0:03:58.187,000 --> 0:04:,000
coming from the sun, going through the atmosphere,

98
0:04:00.721,000 --> 0:04:01,000
being absorbed and reflected?

99
0:04:02.647,000 --> 0:04:05,000
We can code each of those very small pieces as well.

100
0:04:06.626,000 --> 0:04:07,000
There are other pieces:

101
0:04:08.042,000 --> 0:04:11,000
the winds changing the ocean currents.

102
0:04:11.502,000 --> 0:04:14,000
We can talk about the role of vegetation

103
0:04:15.272,000 --> 0:04:17,000
in transporting water from the soils

104
0:04:17.601,000 --> 0:04:18,000
back into the atmosphere.

105
0:04:19.57,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And each of these different elements

106
0:04:22.484,000 --> 0:04:25,000
we can encapsulate and put into a system.

107
0:04:26.108,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Each of those pieces ends up adding to the whole.

108
0:04:31.256,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And you get something like this.

109
0:04:33.553,000 --> 0:04:35,000
You get a beautiful representation

110
0:04:36.401,000 --> 0:04:38,000
of what's going on in the climate system,

111
0:04:39.023,000 --> 0:04:42,000
where each and every one of those

112
0:04:42.412,000 --> 0:04:44,000
emergent patterns that you can see,

113
0:04:45.194,000 --> 0:04:47,000
the swirls in the Southern Ocean,

114
0:04:47.197,000 --> 0:04:49,000
the tropical cyclone in the Gulf of Mexico,

115
0:04:49.953,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and there's two more that are going to pop up

116
0:04:51.594,000 --> 0:04:53,000
in the Pacific at any point now,

117
0:04:53.948,000 --> 0:04:55,000
those rivers of atmospheric water,

118
0:04:56.661,000 --> 0:04:58,000
all of those are emergent properties

119
0:04:59.518,000 --> 0:05:01,000
that come from the interactions

120
0:05:01.642,000 --> 0:05:04,000
of all of those small-scale processes I mentioned.

121
0:05:05.137,000 --> 0:05:06,000
There's no code that says,

122
0:05:07.042,000 --> 0:05:08,000
"Do a wiggle in the Southern Ocean."

123
0:05:08.899,000 --> 0:05:1,000
There's no code that says, "Have two

124
0:05:11.567,000 --> 0:05:13,000
tropical cyclones that spin around each other."

125
0:05:14.465,000 --> 0:05:17,000
All of those things are emergent properties.

126
0:05:18.277,000 --> 0:05:2,000
This is all very good. This is all great.

127
0:05:20.423,000 --> 0:05:21,000
But what we really want to know

128
0:05:21.693,000 --> 0:05:22,000
is what happens to these emergent properties

129
0:05:23.642,000 --> 0:05:24,000
when we kick the system?

130
0:05:25.347,000 --> 0:05:28,000
When something changes, what happens to those properties?

131
0:05:28.88,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And there's lots of different ways to kick the system.

132
0:05:31.869,000 --> 0:05:33,000
There are wobbles in the Earth's orbit

133
0:05:33.902,000 --> 0:05:34,000
over hundreds of thousands of years

134
0:05:35.781,000 --> 0:05:37,000
that change the climate.

135
0:05:37.807,000 --> 0:05:39,000
There are changes in the solar cycles,

136
0:05:39.943,000 --> 0:05:42,000
every 11 years and longer, that change the climate.

137
0:05:43.048,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Big volcanoes go off and change the climate.

138
0:05:46.622,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Changes in biomass burning, in smoke,

139
0:05:49.86,000 --> 0:05:5,000
in aerosol particles, all of those things

140
0:05:51.723,000 --> 0:05:52,000
change the climate.

141
0:05:53.545,000 --> 0:05:57,000
The ozone hole changed the climate.

142
0:05:57.604,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Deforestation changes the climate

143
0:05:59.821,000 --> 0:06:,000
by changing the surface properties

144
0:06:01.747,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and how water is evaporated

145
0:06:03.737,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and moved around in the system.

146
0:06:06.203,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Contrails change the climate

147
0:06:08.488,000 --> 0:06:1,000
by creating clouds where there were none before,

148
0:06:11.355,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and of course greenhouse gases change the system.

149
0:06:15.953,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Each of these different kicks

150
0:06:18.974,000 --> 0:06:2,000
provides us with a target

151
0:06:21.125,000 --> 0:06:23,000
to evaluate whether we understand

152
0:06:23.96,000 --> 0:06:25,000
something about this system.

153
0:06:26.121,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So we can go to look at

154
0:06:28.513,000 --> 0:06:3,000
what model skill is.

155
0:06:31.217,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Now I use the word "skill" advisedly:

156
0:06:33.25,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Models are not right or wrong; they're always wrong.

157
0:06:35.661,000 --> 0:06:36,000
They're always approximations.

158
0:06:37.381,000 --> 0:06:38,000
The question you have to ask

159
0:06:39.275,000 --> 0:06:42,000
is whether a model tells you more information

160
0:06:42.354,000 --> 0:06:43,000
than you would have had otherwise.

161
0:06:44.279,000 --> 0:06:47,000
If it does, it's skillful.

162
0:06:47.66,000 --> 0:06:49,000
This is the impact of the ozone hole

163
0:06:50.114,000 --> 0:06:52,000
on sea level pressure, so low pressure, high pressures,

164
0:06:52.974,000 --> 0:06:54,000
around the southern oceans, around Antarctica.

165
0:06:55.569,000 --> 0:06:56,000
This is observed data.

166
0:06:57.482,000 --> 0:06:59,000
This is modeled data.

167
0:06:59.57,000 --> 0:07:,000
There's a good match

168
0:07:01.164,000 --> 0:07:02,000
because we understand the physics

169
0:07:03.115,000 --> 0:07:06,000
that controls the temperatures in the stratosphere

170
0:07:06.253,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and what that does to the winds

171
0:07:07.999,000 --> 0:07:09,000
around the southern oceans.

172
0:07:10.18,000 --> 0:07:11,000
We can look at other examples.

173
0:07:11.699,000 --> 0:07:13,000
The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991

174
0:07:14.555,000 --> 0:07:16,000
put an enormous amount of aerosols, small particles,

175
0:07:17.354,000 --> 0:07:18,000
into the stratosphere.

176
0:07:18.941,000 --> 0:07:21,000
That changed the radiation balance of the whole planet.

177
0:07:22.088,000 --> 0:07:24,000
There was less energy coming in than there was before,

178
0:07:24.87,000 --> 0:07:25,000
so that cooled the planet,

179
0:07:26.528,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and those red lines and those green lines,

180
0:07:28.547,000 --> 0:07:3,000
those are the differences between what we expected

181
0:07:31.112,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and what actually happened.

182
0:07:32.8,000 --> 0:07:33,000
The models are skillful,

183
0:07:34.583,000 --> 0:07:35,000
not just in the global mean,

184
0:07:36.276,000 --> 0:07:39,000
but also in the regional patterns.

185
0:07:39.32,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I could go through a dozen more examples:

186
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
the skill associated with solar cycles,

187
0:07:45.01,000 --> 0:07:47,000
changing the ozone in the stratosphere;

188
0:07:47.08,000 --> 0:07:49,000
the skill associated with orbital changes

189
0:07:49.427,000 --> 0:07:51,000
over 6,000 years.

190
0:07:51.483,000 --> 0:07:53,000
We can look at that too, and the models are skillful.

191
0:07:53.881,000 --> 0:07:56,000
The models are skillful in response to the ice sheets

192
0:07:56.975,000 --> 0:07:57,000
20,000 years ago.

193
0:07:58.495,000 --> 0:07:59,000
The models are skillful

194
0:08:00.166,000 --> 0:08:02,000
when it comes to the 20th-century trends

195
0:08:03.07,000 --> 0:08:04,000
over the decades.

196
0:08:04.585,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Models are successful at modeling

197
0:08:06.867,000 --> 0:08:08,000
lake outbursts into the North Atlantic

198
0:08:09.472,000 --> 0:08:1,000
8,000 years ago.

199
0:08:11.237,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And we can get a good match to the data.

200
0:08:15.463,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Each of these different targets,

201
0:08:17.85,000 --> 0:08:19,000
each of these different evaluations,

202
0:08:19.98,000 --> 0:08:21,000
leads us to add more scope

203
0:08:22.371,000 --> 0:08:23,000
to these models,

204
0:08:23.522,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and leads us to more and more

205
0:08:26.266,000 --> 0:08:29,000
complex situations that we can ask

206
0:08:30.254,000 --> 0:08:32,000
more and more interesting questions,

207
0:08:32.823,000 --> 0:08:34,000
like, how does dust from the Sahara,

208
0:08:35.533,000 --> 0:08:36,000
that you can see in the orange,

209
0:08:37.267,000 --> 0:08:4,000
interact with tropical cyclones in the Atlantic?

210
0:08:40.71,000 --> 0:08:43,000
How do organic aerosols from biomass burning,

211
0:08:44.187,000 --> 0:08:46,000
which you can see in the red dots,

212
0:08:46.91,000 --> 0:08:48,000
intersect with clouds and rainfall patterns?

213
0:08:49.844,000 --> 0:08:5,000
How does pollution, which you can see

214
0:08:51.631,000 --> 0:08:54,000
in the white wisps of sulfate pollution in Europe,

215
0:08:55.53,000 --> 0:08:58,000
how does that affect the temperatures at the surface

216
0:08:58.865,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and the sunlight that you get at the surface?

217
0:09:02.353,000 --> 0:09:05,000
We can look at this across the world.

218
0:09:05.841,000 --> 0:09:08,000
We can look at the pollution from China.

219
0:09:09.501,000 --> 0:09:12,000
We can look at the impacts of storms

220
0:09:13.099,000 --> 0:09:16,000
on sea salt particles in the atmosphere.

221
0:09:16.543,000 --> 0:09:18,000
We can see the combination

222
0:09:19.104,000 --> 0:09:21,000
of all of these different things

223
0:09:21.275,000 --> 0:09:22,000
happening all at once,

224
0:09:22.743,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and we can ask much more interesting questions.

225
0:09:25.15,000 --> 0:09:29,000
How do air pollution and climate coexist?

226
0:09:29.774,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Can we change things

227
0:09:31.283,000 --> 0:09:33,000
that affect air pollution and climate at the same time?

228
0:09:33.872,000 --> 0:09:35,000
The answer is yes.

229
0:09:36.216,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So this is a history of the 20th century.

230
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
The first one is the model.

231
0:09:41.503,000 --> 0:09:42,000
The weather is a little bit different

232
0:09:42.91,000 --> 0:09:43,000
to what actually happened.

233
0:09:44.199,000 --> 0:09:46,000
The second one are the observations.

234
0:09:46.231,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And we're going through the 1930s.

235
0:09:48.556,000 --> 0:09:5,000
There's variability, there are things going on,

236
0:09:51.38,000 --> 0:09:53,000
but it's all kind of in the noise.

237
0:09:53.562,000 --> 0:09:55,000
As you get towards the 1970s,

238
0:09:56.424,000 --> 0:09:58,000
things are going to start to change.

239
0:09:58.433,000 --> 0:10:,000
They're going to start to look more similar,

240
0:10:00.495,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and by the time you get to the 2000s,

241
0:10:03.063,000 --> 0:10:05,000
you're already seeing the patterns of global warming,

242
0:10:05.705,000 --> 0:10:07,000
both in the observations and in the model.

243
0:10:08.454,000 --> 0:10:1,000
We know what happened over the 20th century.

244
0:10:10.581,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Right? We know that it's gotten warmer.

245
0:10:12.341,000 --> 0:10:13,000
We know where it's gotten warmer.

246
0:10:13.952,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And if you ask the models why did that happen,

247
0:10:16.692,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and you say, okay, well, yes,

248
0:10:18.817,000 --> 0:10:19,000
basically it's because of the carbon dioxide

249
0:10:20.683,000 --> 0:10:21,000
we put into the atmosphere.

250
0:10:22.662,000 --> 0:10:23,000
We have a very good match

251
0:10:24.344,000 --> 0:10:26,000
up until the present day.

252
0:10:26.971,000 --> 0:10:29,000
But there's one key reason why we look at models,

253
0:10:30.391,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and that's because of this phrase here.

254
0:10:32.612,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Because if we had observations of the future,

255
0:10:35.107,000 --> 0:10:38,000
we obviously would trust them more than models,

256
0:10:38.436,000 --> 0:10:39,000
But unfortunately,

257
0:10:40.38,000 --> 0:10:45,000
observations of the future are not available at this time.

258
0:10:45.92,000 --> 0:10:47,000
So when we go out into the future, there's a difference.

259
0:10:48.625,000 --> 0:10:5,000
The future is unknown, the future is uncertain,

260
0:10:51.187,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and there are choices.

261
0:10:53.591,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Here are the choices that we have.

262
0:10:55.424,000 --> 0:10:57,000
We can do some work to mitigate

263
0:10:57.563,000 --> 0:10:59,000
the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

264
0:11:00.358,000 --> 0:11:01,000
That's the top one.

265
0:11:02.284,000 --> 0:11:03,000
We can do more work

266
0:11:04.19,000 --> 0:11:06,000
to really bring it down

267
0:11:06.366,000 --> 0:11:08,000
so that by the end of the century,

268
0:11:08.584,000 --> 0:11:1,000
it's not much more than there is now.

269
0:11:11.048,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Or we can just leave it to fate

270
0:11:14.815,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and continue on

271
0:11:16.308,000 --> 0:11:19,000
with a business-as-usual type of attitude.

272
0:11:20.054,000 --> 0:11:23,000
The differences between these choices

273
0:11:23.51,000 --> 0:11:27,000
can't be answered by looking at models.

274
0:11:28.307,000 --> 0:11:29,000
There's a great phrase

275
0:11:29.946,000 --> 0:11:3,000
that Sherwood Rowland,

276
0:11:31.739,000 --> 0:11:34,000
who won the Nobel Prize for the chemistry

277
0:11:35.603,000 --> 0:11:37,000
that led to ozone depletion,

278
0:11:37.876,000 --> 0:11:39,000
when he was accepting his Nobel Prize,

279
0:11:40.273,000 --> 0:11:41,000
he asked this question:

280
0:11:41.652,000 --> 0:11:43,000
"What is the use of having developed a science

281
0:11:43.963,000 --> 0:11:46,000
well enough to make predictions if, in the end,

282
0:11:47.224,000 --> 0:11:49,000
all we're willing to do is stand around

283
0:11:50.053,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and wait for them to come true?"

284
0:11:52.76,000 --> 0:11:54,000
The models are skillful,

285
0:11:55.497,000 --> 0:11:58,000
but what we do with the information from those models

286
0:11:58.815,000 --> 0:12:,000
is totally up to you.

287
0:12:00.986,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Thank you.

288
0:12:02.924,000 --> 0:12:04,000
(Applause)

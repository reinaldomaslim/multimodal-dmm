1
0:00:12.817,000 --> 0:00:14,000
About 12 years ago,

2
0:00:14.993,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I gave up my career in banking

3
0:00:17.245,000 --> 0:00:2,000
to try to make the world a safer place.

4
0:00:20.356,000 --> 0:00:24,000
This involved a journey into national and global advocacy

5
0:00:24.565,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and meeting some of the most extraordinary people in the world.

6
0:00:29.388,000 --> 0:00:34,000
In the process, I became a civil society diplomat.

7
0:00:34.566,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Civil society diplomats do three things:

8
0:00:38.072,000 --> 0:00:4,000
They voice the concerns of the people,

9
0:00:40.603,000 --> 0:00:43,000
are not pinned down by national interests,

10
0:00:43.691,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and influence change through citizen networks,

11
0:00:46.528,000 --> 0:00:48,000
not only state ones.

12
0:00:49.084,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And if you want to change the world, we need more of them.

13
0:00:53.683,000 --> 0:00:55,000
But many people still ask,

14
0:00:56.19,000 --> 0:01:,000
"Can civil society really make a big difference?

15
0:01:00.741,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Can citizens influence and shape national and global policy?"

16
0:01:06.012,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I never thought I would ask myself these questions,

17
0:01:08.961,000 --> 0:01:11,000
but here I am to share some lessons

18
0:01:12.211,000 --> 0:01:17,000
about two powerful civil society movements that I've been involved in.

19
0:01:17.227,000 --> 0:01:2,000
They are in issues that I'm passionate about:

20
0:01:21.035,000 --> 0:01:25,000
gun control and drug policy.

21
0:01:25.214,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And these are issues that matter here.

22
0:01:28.859,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Latin America is ground zero for both of them.

23
0:01:34.253,000 --> 0:01:36,000
For example, Brazil --

24
0:01:36.296,000 --> 0:01:42,000
this beautiful country hosting TEDGlobal has the world's ugliest record.

25
0:01:42.55,000 --> 0:01:47,000
We are the number one champion in homicidal violence.

26
0:01:48.448,000 --> 0:01:54,000
One in every 10 people killed around the world is a Brazilian.

27
0:01:54.569,000 --> 0:01:59,000
This translates into over 56,000 people

28
0:01:59.678,000 --> 0:02:02,000
dying violently each year.

29
0:02:03.161,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Most of them are young, black boys dying by guns.

30
0:02:09.082,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Brazil is also one of the world's largest consumers of drugs,

31
0:02:14.213,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and the War on Drugs has been especially painful here.

32
0:02:19.066,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Around 50 percent of the homicides in the streets in Brazil

33
0:02:22.339,000 --> 0:02:25,000
are related to the War on Drugs.

34
0:02:25.776,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The same is true for about 25 percent of people in jail.

35
0:02:31.464,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And it's not just Brazil that is affected by the twin problems of guns and drugs.

36
0:02:36.596,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Virtually every country and city across Central and South America is in trouble.

37
0:02:43.62,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Latin America has nine percent of the world's population,

38
0:02:47.869,000 --> 0:02:52,000
but 25 percent of its global violent deaths.

39
0:02:52.93,000 --> 0:02:55,000
These are not problems we can run away from.

40
0:02:55.972,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I certainly could not.

41
0:02:58.271,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So the first campaign I got involved with started here in 2003

42
0:03:03.147,000 --> 0:03:05,000
to change Brazil's gun law

43
0:03:05.19,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and to create a program to buy back weapons.

44
0:03:08.278,000 --> 0:03:09,000
In just a few years,

45
0:03:09.857,000 --> 0:03:11,000
we not only changed national legislation

46
0:03:12.295,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that made it much more difficult for civilians to buy a gun,

47
0:03:16.033,000 --> 0:03:21,000
but we collected and destroyed almost half a million weapons.

48
0:03:21.683,000 --> 0:03:25,000
This was one of the biggest buyback programs in history --

49
0:03:26.262,000 --> 0:03:28,000
(Applause) --

50
0:03:28.921,000 --> 0:03:31,000
but we also suffered some setbacks.

51
0:03:32.542,000 --> 0:03:37,000
We lost a referendum to ban gun sales to civilians in 2005.

52
0:03:38.324,000 --> 0:03:41,000
The second initiative was also home-grown,

53
0:03:41.597,000 --> 0:03:46,000
but is today a global movement to reform the international drug control regime.

54
0:03:47.147,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I am the executive coordinator

55
0:03:48.938,000 --> 0:03:52,000
of something called the Global Commission on Drug Policy.

56
0:03:53.416,000 --> 0:03:55,000
The commission is a high-level group

57
0:03:55.854,000 --> 0:03:58,000
of global leaders brought together to identify more humane

58
0:03:59.755,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and effective approaches to the issue of drugs.

59
0:04:03.911,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Since we started in 2008, the taboo on drugs is broken.

60
0:04:08.479,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Across the Americas, from the US and Mexico to Colombia and Uruguay,

61
0:04:13.431,000 --> 0:04:15,000
change is in the air.

62
0:04:15.579,000 --> 0:04:18,000
But rather than tell you the whole story about these two movements,

63
0:04:19.381,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I just want to share with you four key insights.

64
0:04:23.189,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I call them lessons to change the world.

65
0:04:26.788,000 --> 0:04:28,000
There are certainly many more,

66
0:04:29.017,000 --> 0:04:32,000
but these are the ones that stand out to me.

67
0:04:32.314,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So the first lesson is:

68
0:04:34.496,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Change and control the narrative.

69
0:04:37.77,000 --> 0:04:38,000
It may seem obvious,

70
0:04:39.604,000 --> 0:04:42,000
but a key ingredient to civil society diplomacy

71
0:04:42.646,000 --> 0:04:46,000
is first changing and then controlling the narrative.

72
0:04:46.733,000 --> 0:04:49,000
This is something that veteran politicians understand,

73
0:04:49.89,000 --> 0:04:53,000
but that civil society groups generally do not do very well.

74
0:04:54.813,000 --> 0:04:56,000
In the case of drug policy,

75
0:04:57.158,000 --> 0:05:,000
our biggest success has been to change the discussion

76
0:05:00.618,000 --> 0:05:02,000
away from prosecuting a War on Drugs

77
0:05:03.427,000 --> 0:05:06,000
to putting people's health and safety first.

78
0:05:07.398,000 --> 0:05:1,000
In a cutting-edge report we just launched in New York,

79
0:05:10.834,000 --> 0:05:17,000
we also showed that the groups benefiting most from this $320 billion market

80
0:05:18.403,000 --> 0:05:21,000
are criminal gangs and cartels.

81
0:05:21.724,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So in order to undermine the power and profit of these groups,

82
0:05:25.462,000 --> 0:05:27,000
we need to change the conversation.

83
0:05:28.434,000 --> 0:05:34,000
We need to make illegal drugs legal.

84
0:05:34.726,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But before I get you too excited,

85
0:05:37.559,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I don't mean drugs should be a free-for-all.

86
0:05:40.702,000 --> 0:05:44,000
What I'm talking about, and what the Global Commission advocates for

87
0:05:44.827,000 --> 0:05:48,000
is creating a highly regulated market,

88
0:05:49.354,000 --> 0:05:54,000
where different drugs would have different degrees of regulation.

89
0:05:54.579,000 --> 0:05:58,000
As for gun control, we were successful in changing,

90
0:05:58.619,000 --> 0:06:,000
but not so much in controlling, the narrative.

91
0:06:01.544,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And this brings me to my next lesson:

92
0:06:04.4,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Never underestimate your opponents.

93
0:06:08.324,000 --> 0:06:1,000
If you want to succeed in changing the world,

94
0:06:10.553,000 --> 0:06:12,000
you need to know who you're up against.

95
0:06:12.922,000 --> 0:06:15,000
You need to learn their motivations and points of view.

96
0:06:16.59,000 --> 0:06:18,000
In the case of gun control,

97
0:06:18.796,000 --> 0:06:21,000
we really underestimated our opponents.

98
0:06:22.349,000 --> 0:06:24,000
After a very successful gun-collection program,

99
0:06:25.274,000 --> 0:06:26,000
we were elated.

100
0:06:26.618,000 --> 0:06:28,000
We had support from 80 percent of Brazilians,

101
0:06:29.454,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and thought that this could help us win the referendum

102
0:06:32.335,000 --> 0:06:34,000
to ban gun sales to civilians.

103
0:06:34.747,000 --> 0:06:37,000
But we were dead wrong.

104
0:06:37.928,000 --> 0:06:4,000
During a televised 20-day public debate,

105
0:06:41.249,000 --> 0:06:44,000
our opponent used our own arguments against us.

106
0:06:45.103,000 --> 0:06:47,000
We ended up losing the popular vote.

107
0:06:47.332,000 --> 0:06:49,000
It was really terrible.

108
0:06:49.677,000 --> 0:06:55,000
The National Rifle Association -- yes, the American NRA --

109
0:06:55.836,000 --> 0:06:56,000
came to Brazil.

110
0:06:57.595,000 --> 0:07:,000
They inundated our campaign with their propaganda,

111
0:07:00.695,000 --> 0:07:01,000
that as you know,

112
0:07:02.238,000 --> 0:07:06,000
links the right to own guns to ideas of freedom and democracy.

113
0:07:06.581,000 --> 0:07:09,000
They simply threw everything at us.

114
0:07:10.458,000 --> 0:07:11,000
They used our national flag,

115
0:07:12.385,000 --> 0:07:13,000
our independence anthem.

116
0:07:14.08,000 --> 0:07:15,000
They invoked women's rights

117
0:07:15.915,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and misused images of Mandela, Tiananmen Square, and even Hitler.

118
0:07:21.302,000 --> 0:07:24,000
They won by playing with people's fears.

119
0:07:25.272,000 --> 0:07:29,000
In fact, guns were almost completely ignored in their campaign.

120
0:07:29.916,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Their focus was on individual rights.

121
0:07:33.213,000 --> 0:07:34,000
But I ask you,

122
0:07:34.792,000 --> 0:07:36,000
which right is more important,

123
0:07:37.021,000 --> 0:07:38,000
the right to life

124
0:07:38.832,000 --> 0:07:41,000
or the right to have a gun that takes life away?

125
0:07:41.897,000 --> 0:07:45,000
(Applause)

126
0:07:46.15,000 --> 0:07:49,000
We thought people would vote in defense of life,

127
0:07:49.972,000 --> 0:07:53,000
but in a country with a recent past of military dictatorship,

128
0:07:54.756,000 --> 0:07:58,000
the anti-government message of our opponents resonated,

129
0:07:59.027,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and we were not prepared to respond.

130
0:08:02.626,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Lesson learned.

131
0:08:04.715,000 --> 0:08:07,000
We've been more successful in the case of drug policy.

132
0:08:08.005,000 --> 0:08:12,000
If you asked most people 10 years ago if an end to the War on Drugs was possible,

133
0:08:12.719,000 --> 0:08:14,000
they would have laughed.

134
0:08:14.731,000 --> 0:08:17,000
After all, there are huge military police prisons

135
0:08:18.229,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and financial establishments benefiting from this war.

136
0:08:22.325,000 --> 0:08:27,000
But today, the international drug control regime is starting to crumble.

137
0:08:28.097,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Governments and civil societies are experimenting with new approaches.

138
0:08:32.926,000 --> 0:08:34,000
The Global Commission on Drug Policy

139
0:08:35.248,000 --> 0:08:37,000
really knew its opposition,

140
0:08:37.315,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and rather than fighting them,

141
0:08:39.149,000 --> 0:08:43,000
our chair -- former Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso --

142
0:08:43.793,000 --> 0:08:47,000
reached out to leaders from across the political spectrum,

143
0:08:48.065,000 --> 0:08:5,000
from liberals to conservatives.

144
0:08:50.875,000 --> 0:08:54,000
This high level group agreed to honestly discuss

145
0:08:55.751,000 --> 0:08:56,000
the merits and flaws of drug policies.

146
0:08:57.701,000 --> 0:09:01,000
It was this reasoned, informed and strategic discussion

147
0:09:02.461,000 --> 0:09:05,000
that revealed the sad truth about the War on Drugs.

148
0:09:06.222,000 --> 0:09:12,000
The War on Drugs has simply failed across every metric.

149
0:09:12.538,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Drugs are cheaper and more available than ever,

150
0:09:15.44,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and consumption has risen globally.

151
0:09:18.227,000 --> 0:09:2,000
But even worse,

152
0:09:20.409,000 --> 0:09:26,000
it also generated massive negative unintended consequences.

153
0:09:26.98,000 --> 0:09:29,000
It is true that some people have made these arguments before,

154
0:09:30.626,000 --> 0:09:31,000
but we've made a difference

155
0:09:32.366,000 --> 0:09:35,000
by anticipating the arguments of our opponents

156
0:09:35.378,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and by leveraging powerful voices

157
0:09:37.484,000 --> 0:09:41,000
that a few years ago would probably have resisted change.

158
0:09:42.374,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Third lesson: Use data to drive your argument.

159
0:09:46.461,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Guns and drugs are emotive issues,

160
0:09:49.456,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and as we've painfully learned in the gun referendum campaign in Brazil,

161
0:09:53.357,000 --> 0:09:56,000
sometimes it's impossible to cut through the emotions

162
0:09:56.422,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and get to the facts.

163
0:09:58.512,000 --> 0:10:01,000
But this doesn't mean that we shouldn't try.

164
0:10:01.6,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Until quite recently,

165
0:10:03.251,000 --> 0:10:07,000
we simply didn't know how many Brazilians were killed by guns.

166
0:10:07.265,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Amazingly, it was a local soap opera called "Mulheres Apaixonadas" --

167
0:10:12.78,000 --> 0:10:13,000
or "Women in Love" --

168
0:10:14.498,000 --> 0:10:17,000
that kicked off Brazil's national gun control campaign.

169
0:10:18.41,000 --> 0:10:2,000
In one highly viewed episode,

170
0:10:20.872,000 --> 0:10:24,000
a soap opera lead actress was killed by a stray bullet.

171
0:10:25.074,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Brazilian grannies and housewives were outraged,

172
0:10:29.37,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and in a case of art imitating life,

173
0:10:32.644,000 --> 0:10:37,000
this episode also included footage of a real gun control march

174
0:10:37.938,000 --> 0:10:39,000
that we had organized right here,

175
0:10:40.422,000 --> 0:10:42,000
outside in Copacabana Beach.

176
0:10:43.255,000 --> 0:10:48,000
The televised death and march had a huge impact on public opinion.

177
0:10:48.699,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Within weeks, our national congress approved the disarmament bill

178
0:10:53.483,000 --> 0:10:56,000
that had been languishing for years.

179
0:10:56.571,000 --> 0:10:59,000
We were then able to mobilize data

180
0:10:59.586,000 --> 0:11:02,000
to show the successful outcomes of the change in the law

181
0:11:02.886,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and gun collection program.

182
0:11:05.007,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Here is what I mean:

183
0:11:06.769,000 --> 0:11:09,000
We could prove that in just one year,

184
0:11:10.293,000 --> 0:11:14,000
we saved more than 5,000 lives.

185
0:11:15.099,000 --> 0:11:18,000
(Applause)

186
0:11:18.862,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And in the case of drugs,

187
0:11:21.276,000 --> 0:11:26,000
in order to undermine this fear and prejudice that surrounds the issue,

188
0:11:26.57,000 --> 0:11:31,000
we managed to gather and present data that shows that today's drug policies

189
0:11:31.678,000 --> 0:11:34,000
cause much more harm than drug use per se,

190
0:11:35.549,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and people are starting to get it.

191
0:11:39.682,000 --> 0:11:41,000
My fourth insight is:

192
0:11:41.818,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Don't be afraid to bring together odd bedfellows.

193
0:11:46.044,000 --> 0:11:47,000
What we've learned in Brazil --

194
0:11:48.018,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and this doesn't only apply to my country --

195
0:11:50.363,000 --> 0:11:54,000
is the importance of bringing diverse and eclectic folks together.

196
0:11:54.995,000 --> 0:11:56,000
If you want to change the world,

197
0:11:57.131,000 --> 0:12:01,000
it helps to have a good cross-section of society on your side.

198
0:12:01.427,000 --> 0:12:03,000
In both the case of guns and drugs,

199
0:12:04.027,000 --> 0:12:07,000
we brought together a wonderful mix of people.

200
0:12:07.463,000 --> 0:12:11,000
We mobilized the elite and got huge support from the media.

201
0:12:11.667,000 --> 0:12:15,000
We gathered the victims, human rights champions, cultural icons.

202
0:12:16.124,000 --> 0:12:18,000
We also assembled the professional classes --

203
0:12:18.701,000 --> 0:12:2,000
doctors, lawyers, academia and more.

204
0:12:21.697,000 --> 0:12:23,000
What I've learned over the last years

205
0:12:24.437,000 --> 0:12:29,000
is that you need coalitions of the willing and of the unwilling to make change.

206
0:12:30.337,000 --> 0:12:31,000
In the case of drugs,

207
0:12:32.204,000 --> 0:12:35,000
we needed libertarians, anti-prohibitionists, legalizers,

208
0:12:35.791,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and liberal politicians.

209
0:12:38.136,000 --> 0:12:4,000
They may not agree on everything;

210
0:12:40.597,000 --> 0:12:44,000
in fact, they disagree on almost everything.

211
0:12:44.846,000 --> 0:12:49,000
But the legitimacy of the campaign is based on their diverse points of view.

212
0:12:51.521,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Over a decade ago,

213
0:12:53.762,000 --> 0:12:57,000
I had a comfortable future working for an investment bank.

214
0:12:58.22,000 --> 0:13:02,000
I was as far removed from the world of civil society diplomacy

215
0:13:02.492,000 --> 0:13:04,000
as you can imagine.

216
0:13:04.768,000 --> 0:13:06,000
But I took a chance.

217
0:13:06.927,000 --> 0:13:07,000
I changed course,

218
0:13:08.924,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and on the way, I helped to create social movements

219
0:13:12.284,000 --> 0:13:16,000
that I believe have made some parts of the world safer.

220
0:13:17.004,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Each and every one of us has the power to change the world.

221
0:13:22.178,000 --> 0:13:26,000
No matter what the issue, and no matter how hard the fight,

222
0:13:26.79,000 --> 0:13:3,000
civil society is central to the blueprint for change.

223
0:13:31.504,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Thank you.

224
0:13:33.815,000 --> 0:13:37,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.506,000 --> 0:00:14,000
When I arrived in Kiev,

2
0:00:15.335,000 --> 0:00:17,000
on February 1 this year,

3
0:00:17.731,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Independence Square was under siege,

4
0:00:20.35,000 --> 0:00:23,000
surrounded by police loyal to the government.

5
0:00:23.988,000 --> 0:00:25,000
The protesters who occupied Maidan,

6
0:00:26.529,000 --> 0:00:27,000
as the square is known,

7
0:00:28.361,000 --> 0:00:29,000
prepared for battle,

8
0:00:29.981,000 --> 0:00:31,000
stockpiling homemade weapons

9
0:00:32.24,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and mass-producing improvised body armor.

10
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
The Euromaidan protests began peacefully at the end of 2013,

11
0:00:41.133,000 --> 0:00:44,000
after the president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych,

12
0:00:44.364,000 --> 0:00:47,000
rejected a far-reaching accord with the European Union

13
0:00:47.85,000 --> 0:00:49,000
in favor of stronger ties with Russia.

14
0:00:50.847,000 --> 0:00:53,000
In response, tens of thousands of dissatisfied citizens

15
0:00:54.204,000 --> 0:00:58,000
poured into central Kiev to demonstrate against this allegiance.

16
0:00:59.656,000 --> 0:01:,000
As the months passed,

17
0:01:01.291,000 --> 0:01:04,000
confrontations between police and civilians intensified.

18
0:01:05.858,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I set up a makeshift portrait studio by the barricades on Hrushevsky Street.

19
0:01:12.248,000 --> 0:01:16,000
There, I photographed the fighters against a black curtain,

20
0:01:16.551,000 --> 0:01:2,000
a curtain that obscured the highly seductive and visual backdrop

21
0:01:20.949,000 --> 0:01:22,000
of fire, ice and smoke.

22
0:01:24.858,000 --> 0:01:27,000
In order to tell the individual human stories here,

23
0:01:28.242,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I felt that I needed to remove the dramatic visuals

24
0:01:31.376,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that had become so familiar and repetitive within the mainstream media.

25
0:01:36.455,000 --> 0:01:4,000
What I was witnessing was not only news, but also history.

26
0:01:40.593,000 --> 0:01:41,000
With this realization,

27
0:01:41.928,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I was free from the photojournalistic conventions

28
0:01:44.864,000 --> 0:01:46,000
of the newspaper and the magazine.

29
0:01:47.869,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Oleg, Vasiliy and Maxim were all ordinary men,

30
0:01:52.895,000 --> 0:01:54,000
with ordinary lives from ordinary towns.

31
0:01:56.309,000 --> 0:01:59,000
But the elaborate costumes that they had bedecked themselves in

32
0:01:59.623,000 --> 0:02:,000
were quite extraordinary.

33
0:02:00.953,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I say the word "costume"

34
0:02:02.744,000 --> 0:02:04,000
because these were not clothes that had been issued

35
0:02:05.194,000 --> 0:02:06,000
or coordinated by anyone.

36
0:02:07.179,000 --> 0:02:09,000
They were improvised uniforms

37
0:02:09.483,000 --> 0:02:11,000
made up of decommissioned military equipment,

38
0:02:12.363,000 --> 0:02:17,000
irregular combat fatigues and trophies taken from the police.

39
0:02:17.725,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I became interested in the way they were choosing to represent themselves,

40
0:02:22.297,000 --> 0:02:25,000
this outward expression of masculinity,

41
0:02:25.843,000 --> 0:02:26,000
the ideal of the warrior.

42
0:02:28.724,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I worked slowly, using an analog film camera

43
0:02:32.009,000 --> 0:02:35,000
with a manual focusing loop and a handheld light meter.

44
0:02:35.764,000 --> 0:02:36,000
The process is old-fashioned.

45
0:02:38.279,000 --> 0:02:4,000
It gives me time to speak with each person

46
0:02:41.268,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and to look at them, in silence, while they look back at me.

47
0:02:47.755,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Rising tensions culminated in the worst day of violence

48
0:02:50.982,000 --> 0:02:51,000
on February 20,

49
0:02:52.711,000 --> 0:02:54,000
which became known as Bloody Thursday.

50
0:02:55.663,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Snipers, loyal to the government,

51
0:02:57.717,000 --> 0:03:02,000
started firing on the civilians and protesters on Institutskaya Street.

52
0:03:03.12,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Many were killed in a very short space of time.

53
0:03:07.123,000 --> 0:03:11,000
The reception of the Hotel Ukraine became a makeshift morgue.

54
0:03:11.236,000 --> 0:03:14,000
There were lines of bodies laid in the street.

55
0:03:14.282,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And there was blood all over the pavements.

56
0:03:17.908,000 --> 0:03:21,000
The following day, President Yanukovych fled Ukraine.

57
0:03:22.146,000 --> 0:03:23,000
In all, three months of protests

58
0:03:23.929,000 --> 0:03:26,000
resulted in more than 120 confirmed dead

59
0:03:27.398,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and many more missing.

60
0:03:29.913,000 --> 0:03:31,000
History unfolded quickly,

61
0:03:31.956,000 --> 0:03:33,000
but celebration remained elusive in Maidan.

62
0:03:35.488,000 --> 0:03:37,000
As the days passed in Kiev's central square,

63
0:03:38.289,000 --> 0:03:39,000
streams of armed fighters

64
0:03:39.828,000 --> 0:03:42,000
were joined by tens of thousands of ordinary people,

65
0:03:43.254,000 --> 0:03:45,000
filling the streets in an act of collective mourning.

66
0:03:47.174,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Many were women who often carried flowers

67
0:03:49.588,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that they had brought to lay as marks of respect for the dead.

68
0:03:53.768,000 --> 0:03:54,000
They came day after day

69
0:03:55.339,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and they covered the square with millions of flowers.

70
0:04:00.517,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Sadness enveloped Maidan.

71
0:04:03.281,000 --> 0:04:05,000
It was quiet and I could hear the birds singing.

72
0:04:05.895,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I hadn't heard that before.

73
0:04:08.141,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I stopped women as they approached the barricades

74
0:04:10.639,000 --> 0:04:11,000
to lay their tributes

75
0:04:11.807,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and asked to make their picture.

76
0:04:14.478,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Most women cried when I photographed them.

77
0:04:17.592,000 --> 0:04:19,000
On the first day, my fixer, Emine, and I cried

78
0:04:19.768,000 --> 0:04:22,000
with almost every woman who visited our studio.

79
0:04:24.876,000 --> 0:04:27,000
There had been such a noticeable absence of women

80
0:04:27.882,000 --> 0:04:28,000
up until that point.

81
0:04:29.625,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And the color of their pastel coats,

82
0:04:31.918,000 --> 0:04:32,000
their shiny handbags,

83
0:04:33.656,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and the bunches of red carnations,

84
0:04:35.746,000 --> 0:04:38,000
white tulips and yellow roses that they carried

85
0:04:38.977,000 --> 0:04:4,000
jarred with the blackened square

86
0:04:41.113,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and the blackened men who were encamped there.

87
0:04:45.105,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It is clear to me that these two sets of pictures

88
0:04:47.956,000 --> 0:04:49,000
don't make much sense without the other.

89
0:04:50.694,000 --> 0:04:52,000
They are about men and women and the way we are --

90
0:04:53.091,000 --> 0:04:55,000
not the way we look, but the way we are.

91
0:04:55.831,000 --> 0:04:57,000
They speak about different gender roles in conflict,

92
0:04:58.663,000 --> 0:05:,000
not only in Maidan, and not only in Ukraine.

93
0:05:02.597,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Men fight most wars and women mourn them.

94
0:05:06.399,000 --> 0:05:08,000
If the men showed the ideal of the warrior,

95
0:05:08.835,000 --> 0:05:1,000
then the women showed the implications of such violence.

96
0:05:13.256,000 --> 0:05:14,000
When I made these pictures,

97
0:05:15.02,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I believed that I was documenting the end of violent events in Ukraine.

98
0:05:18.824,000 --> 0:05:21,000
But now I understand that it is a record of the beginning.

99
0:05:22.317,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Today, the death toll stands around 3,000,

100
0:05:25.73,000 --> 0:05:27,000
while hundreds of thousands have been displaced.

101
0:05:29.847,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I was in Ukraine again six weeks ago.

102
0:05:32.547,000 --> 0:05:35,000
In Maidan, the barricades have been dismantled,

103
0:05:36.035,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and the paving stones which were used as weapons during the protests replaced,

104
0:05:39.917,000 --> 0:05:43,000
so that traffic flows freely through the center of the square.

105
0:05:44.129,000 --> 0:05:47,000
The fighters, the women and the flowers are gone.

106
0:05:48.737,000 --> 0:05:51,000
A huge billboard depicting geese flying over a wheat field

107
0:05:52.538,000 --> 0:05:55,000
covers the burned-out shell of the trade union's building

108
0:05:55.806,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and proclaims,

109
0:05:57.234,000 --> 0:05:58,000
"Glory to Ukraine.

110
0:05:58.685,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Glory to heroes."

111
0:06:00.383,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Thank you.

112
0:06:01.383,000 --> 0:06:04,000
(Applause).

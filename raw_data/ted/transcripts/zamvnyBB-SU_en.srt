1
0:00:13.6,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Probably not a surprise to you,

2
0:00:16.2,000 --> 0:00:18,000
but I don't like to be in a hospital

3
0:00:18.36,000 --> 0:00:19,000
or go to a hospital.

4
0:00:20.039,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Do you?

5
0:00:21.84,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I'm sure many of you feel the same way, right?

6
0:00:24.32,000 --> 0:00:28,000
But why? Why is it that we hate hospitals so much?

7
0:00:28.36,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Or is it just a fact of life we have to live with?

8
0:00:31.68,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Is it the crappy food?

9
0:00:34.48,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Is it the expensive parking?

10
0:00:36.56,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Is it the intense smell?

11
0:00:38.36,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Or is it the fear of the unknown?

12
0:00:41.04,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Well, it's all of that, and it's more.

13
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Patients often have to travel long distances

14
0:00:47.68,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to get to their nearest hospital,

15
0:00:50.92,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and access to hospital care is becoming more and more an issue

16
0:00:54.28,000 --> 0:00:55,000
in rural areas,

17
0:00:55.96,000 --> 0:00:56,000
in the US,

18
0:00:57.28,000 --> 0:00:59,000
but also in sparsely populated countries like Sweden.

19
0:01:01.24,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And even when hospitals are more abundant,

20
0:01:05.04,000 --> 0:01:07,000
typically the poor and the elderly

21
0:01:07.08,000 --> 0:01:1,000
have trouble getting care because they lack transportation

22
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that is convenient and affordable to them.

23
0:01:13.84,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And many people are avoiding hospital care altogether,

24
0:01:18.4,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and they miss getting proper treatment

25
0:01:20.44,000 --> 0:01:21,000
due to cost.

26
0:01:22.72,000 --> 0:01:25,000
We see that 64 percent of Americans

27
0:01:26.44,000 --> 0:01:28,000
are avoiding care due to cost.

28
0:01:30.76,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And even when you do get treatment,

29
0:01:33.84,000 --> 0:01:35,000
hospitals often make us sicker.

30
0:01:37.32,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Medical errors are reported to be the third cause of death in the US,

31
0:01:43.12,000 --> 0:01:46,000
just behind cancer and heart disease,

32
0:01:46.56,000 --> 0:01:47,000
the third cause of death.

33
0:01:49.68,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I'm in health care for over 20 years now,

34
0:01:51.8,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and I witness every day how broken and how obsolete our hospital system is.

35
0:01:58.44,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Let me give you two examples.

36
0:02:00.2,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Four in 10 Japanese medical doctors

37
0:02:03.48,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and five in 10 American medical doctors

38
0:02:06.32,000 --> 0:02:07,000
are burnt out.

39
0:02:08.52,000 --> 0:02:1,000
In my home country, the Netherlands,

40
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:13,000
only 17 million people live there.

41
0:02:13.2,000 --> 0:02:17,000
We are short 125,000 nurses over the coming years.

42
0:02:19.92,000 --> 0:02:2,000
But how did we even end up here,

43
0:02:21.68,000 --> 0:02:23,000
in this idea of placing all kinds of sick people

44
0:02:24.52,000 --> 0:02:25,000
together in one big building?

45
0:02:27.68,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Well, we have to go back to the Ancient Greeks.

46
0:02:31.2,000 --> 0:02:34,000
In 400 BC, temples for cure were erected

47
0:02:34.36,000 --> 0:02:36,000
where people could go to get their diagnosis,

48
0:02:36.88,000 --> 0:02:38,000
their treatment and their healing.

49
0:02:39.36,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And then really for about 2,000 years,

50
0:02:42.8,000 --> 0:02:44,000
we've seen religious care centers

51
0:02:45.32,000 --> 0:02:48,000
all the way up to the Industrial Revolution,

52
0:02:48.92,000 --> 0:02:53,000
where we've seen hospitals being set up as assembly lines

53
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:58,000
based on the principles of the Industrial Revolution,

54
0:02:58.52,000 --> 0:02:59,000
to produce efficiently

55
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and get the products, the patients in this case,

56
0:03:02.76,000 --> 0:03:04,000
out of the hospital as soon as possible.

57
0:03:06.52,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Over the last century, we've seen lots of interesting innovations.

58
0:03:10.84,000 --> 0:03:12,000
We figured out how to make insulin.

59
0:03:13.32,000 --> 0:03:15,000
We invented pacemakers and X-ray,

60
0:03:16.12,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and we even came into this wonderful new era of cell and gene therapies.

61
0:03:21.8,000 --> 0:03:25,000
But the biggest change to fix our hospital system altogether

62
0:03:26.32,000 --> 0:03:28,000
is still ahead of us.

63
0:03:28.36,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And I believe it's time now, we have the opportunity,

64
0:03:31.24,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to revolutionize the system altogether

65
0:03:34.32,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and forget about our current hospital system.

66
0:03:37.12,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I believe it's time to create a new system

67
0:03:39.36,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that revolves around health care at home.

68
0:03:43.84,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Recent research has shown

69
0:03:46.44,000 --> 0:03:49,000
that 46 percent of hospital care

70
0:03:49.72,000 --> 0:03:5,000
can move to the patient's home.

71
0:03:52.4,000 --> 0:03:53,000
That's a lot.

72
0:03:54.2,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And that's mainly for those patients who suffer from chronic diseases.

73
0:03:58.56,000 --> 0:04:,000
With that, hospitals can and should

74
0:04:01.56,000 --> 0:04:04,000
reduce to smaller, agile and mobile care centers

75
0:04:05.52,000 --> 0:04:06,000
focused on acute care.

76
0:04:07.84,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So things like neonatology, intensive care, surgery and imaging

77
0:04:13.96,000 --> 0:04:15,000
will still remain at the hospitals,

78
0:04:16.04,000 --> 0:04:18,000
at least I believe for the foreseeable future.

79
0:04:20.6,000 --> 0:04:21,000
A few weeks ago, I met a colleague

80
0:04:22.6,000 --> 0:04:25,000
whose mom was diagnosed with incurable cancer,

81
0:04:25.88,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and she said, "Niels, it's hard.

82
0:04:27.72,000 --> 0:04:3,000
It's so hard when we know that she's got only months to live.

83
0:04:32.56,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Instead of playing with the grandchildren,

84
0:04:34.64,000 --> 0:04:37,000
she now has to travel three times a week

85
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
two hours up and down to Amsterdam

86
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
just to get her treatment and tests."

87
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And that really breaks my heart,

88
0:04:45.6,000 --> 0:04:48,000
because we all know that a professional nurse

89
0:04:49.12,000 --> 0:04:51,000
could draw her blood at home as well, right?

90
0:04:51.72,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And if she could get her tests and treatment at home as well,

91
0:04:55.36,000 --> 0:04:58,000
she could do the things that are really important to her

92
0:04:58.76,000 --> 0:04:59,000
in her last months.

93
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
My own mom, 82 years old now -- God bless her --

94
0:05:06.72,000 --> 0:05:07,000
she's avoiding to go to the hospital

95
0:05:08.6,000 --> 0:05:11,000
because she finds it difficult to plan and manage the journey.

96
0:05:12.56,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So my sisters and I, we help her out.

97
0:05:15.56,000 --> 0:05:18,000
But there's many elderly people who are avoiding care

98
0:05:18.8,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and are waiting that long that it becomes life-threatening,

99
0:05:22.24,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and it's straight to the costly, intensive care.

100
0:05:26.24,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Dr. Covinsky, a clinical researcher at the University of California,

101
0:05:30.12,000 --> 0:05:33,000
he concludes that a third of patients over 70

102
0:05:33.68,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and more than half of patients over 85,

103
0:05:36.8,000 --> 0:05:39,000
leave the hospital more disabled than when they came in.

104
0:05:41.36,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And a very practical problem

105
0:05:44.92,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that many patients face when they have to go to a hospital is:

106
0:05:48.4,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Where do I go with my main companion in life,

107
0:05:52.96,000 --> 0:05:53,000
where do I go with my dog?

108
0:05:57.24,000 --> 0:05:59,000
That's our dog, by the way. Isn't she cute?

109
0:05:59.32,000 --> 0:06:01,000
(Laughter)

110
0:06:02.88,000 --> 0:06:03,000
But it's not only about convenience.

111
0:06:04.88,000 --> 0:06:08,000
It's also about unnecessary health care stays and costs.

112
0:06:09.8,000 --> 0:06:1,000
A friend of mine, Art,

113
0:06:11.28,000 --> 0:06:14,000
he recently needed to be hospitalized for just a minor surgery,

114
0:06:15.12,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and he had to stay in the hospital for over two weeks,

115
0:06:17.88,000 --> 0:06:2,000
just because he needed a specific kind of IV antibiotics.

116
0:06:21.84,000 --> 0:06:24,000
So he occupied a bed for two weeks

117
0:06:25.04,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that cost over a thousand euros a day.

118
0:06:27.84,000 --> 0:06:28,000
It's just ridiculous.

119
0:06:29.84,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And these costs are really at the heart of the issue.

120
0:06:32.88,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So we've seen over many of our global economies,

121
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
health care expense grow as a percentage of GDP

122
0:06:38.36,000 --> 0:06:39,000
over the last years.

123
0:06:40.08,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So here we see that over the last 50 years,

124
0:06:43.04,000 --> 0:06:47,000
health care expense has grown from about five percent in Germany

125
0:06:47.08,000 --> 0:06:48,000
to about 11 percent now.

126
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:54,000
In the US, we've seen growth from six percent to over 17 percent now.

127
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And a large portion of these costs are driven by investments

128
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
in large, shiny hospital buildings.

129
0:07:03.72,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And these buildings are not flexible,

130
0:07:05.56,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and they maintain a system where hospital beds need to be filled

131
0:07:08.72,000 --> 0:07:09,000
for a hospital to run efficiently.

132
0:07:11.48,000 --> 0:07:14,000
There's no incentive for a hospital to run with less beds.

133
0:07:15.88,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Just the thought of that makes you sick, right?

134
0:07:18.96,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And here's the thing: the cost for treating my buddy Art at home

135
0:07:22.72,000 --> 0:07:25,000
can be up to 10 times cheaper than hospital care.

136
0:07:27.24,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And that is where we're headed.

137
0:07:29.64,000 --> 0:07:32,000
The hospital bed of the future will be in our own homes.

138
0:07:34.24,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And it's already starting.

139
0:07:35.6,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Global home care is growing 10 percent year over year.

140
0:07:39.64,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And from my own experience, I see that logistics and technology

141
0:07:44.24,000 --> 0:07:46,000
are making these home health care solutions work.

142
0:07:48.24,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Technology is already allowing us to do things

143
0:07:50.56,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that were once exclusive to hospitals.

144
0:07:53.72,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Diagnosis tests like blood,

145
0:07:56.4,000 --> 0:08:,000
glucose tests, urine tests, can now be taken in the comfort of our homes.

146
0:08:01.08,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And more and more connected devices

147
0:08:05.4,000 --> 0:08:07,000
we see like pacemakers and insulin pumps

148
0:08:08.12,000 --> 0:08:11,000
that will proactively signal if help is needed soon.

149
0:08:12.84,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And all that technology is coming together

150
0:08:14.92,000 --> 0:08:17,000
in much more insights into the patients' health,

151
0:08:18.24,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and that insight and all of the information leads to better control

152
0:08:22.28,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and to less medical errors --

153
0:08:24.36,000 --> 0:08:26,000
remember, the third cause of death

154
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
in the US.

155
0:08:29.6,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And I see it every day at work.

156
0:08:31.36,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I work in logistics

157
0:08:33.08,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and for me, home health care works.

158
0:08:38.04,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So we see a delivery driver deliver the medicine

159
0:08:42.2,000 --> 0:08:43,000
to the patient's home.

160
0:08:44.48,000 --> 0:08:47,000
A nurse joins him and actually administers the drug

161
0:08:47.96,000 --> 0:08:48,000
at the patient's home.

162
0:08:50.679,000 --> 0:08:51,000
It's that simple.

163
0:08:52.4,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Remember my buddy, Art?

164
0:08:54.039,000 --> 0:08:57,000
He can now get the IV antibiotics in the comfort of his home:

165
0:08:57.84,000 --> 0:09:,000
no hospital pajamas, no crappy food

166
0:09:01.6,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and no risk of these antibiotic-resistant superbugs

167
0:09:06.48,000 --> 0:09:08,000
that only bite you in these hospitals.

168
0:09:08.88,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And it goes further.

169
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
So now the elderly people can get the treatment that they need

170
0:09:14.68,000 --> 0:09:15,000
in the comfort of their own home

171
0:09:16.68,000 --> 0:09:18,000
while with their best companion in life.

172
0:09:19.2,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And there's no need anymore to drive hours and hours

173
0:09:22.56,000 --> 0:09:23,000
just to get your treatment and tests.

174
0:09:25.56,000 --> 0:09:26,000
In the Netherlands and in Denmark,

175
0:09:27.24,000 --> 0:09:29,000
we've seen very good successes in cancer clinics

176
0:09:29.96,000 --> 0:09:32,000
organizing chemotherapies at the patient's homes,

177
0:09:34.36,000 --> 0:09:36,000
sometimes even together with fellow patients.

178
0:09:38.08,000 --> 0:09:4,000
The best improvements for these patients

179
0:09:40.64,000 --> 0:09:43,000
have been improvements in reduction in stress,

180
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
anxiety disorders and depression.

181
0:09:47.92,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Home health care also helped them to get back a sense of normality

182
0:09:51.6,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and freedom in their lives,

183
0:09:53.96,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and they've actually helped them to forget about their disease.

184
0:09:59.6,000 --> 0:10:01,000
But home health care, Niels --

185
0:10:02.24,000 --> 0:10:05,000
what if I don't even have a home, when I'm homeless,

186
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
or when I do have a home but there's no one to take care of me

187
0:10:09.56,000 --> 0:10:1,000
or even open up the door?

188
0:10:12.04,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Well, in comes our sharing economy,

189
0:10:15.44,000 --> 0:10:18,000
or, as I like to call it, the Airbnb for home care.

190
0:10:19.36,000 --> 0:10:22,000
In the Netherlands, we see churches and care organizations

191
0:10:22.72,000 --> 0:10:24,000
match people in need of care and company

192
0:10:25.6,000 --> 0:10:27,000
with people who actually have a home for them

193
0:10:27.76,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and can provide care and company to them.

194
0:10:30.52,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Home health care is cheaper,

195
0:10:32.44,000 --> 0:10:35,000
it's easier to facilitate, and it's quick to set up --

196
0:10:36.08,000 --> 0:10:4,000
in these rural areas we talked about, but also in humanitarian crisis situations

197
0:10:40.68,000 --> 0:10:45,000
where it's often safer, quicker and cheaper to set things up at home.

198
0:10:48.08,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Home health care is very applicable in prosperous areas

199
0:10:52.32,000 --> 0:10:55,000
but also very much in underserved communities.

200
0:10:55.92,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Home health care works in developed countries

201
0:10:58.08,000 --> 0:10:59,000
as well as in developing countries.

202
0:11:00.76,000 --> 0:11:05,000
So I'm passionate to help facilitate improvements in patients' lives

203
0:11:06.6,000 --> 0:11:07,000
due to home health care.

204
0:11:08.56,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I'm passionate to help facilitate

205
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:13,000
that the elderly people get the treatment that they need

206
0:11:13.76,000 --> 0:11:14,000
in the comfort of their own homes,

207
0:11:15.52,000 --> 0:11:17,000
together with their best companion in life.

208
0:11:18.64,000 --> 0:11:2,000
I'm passionate to make the change

209
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and help ensure that patients, and not their disease,

210
0:11:24.76,000 --> 0:11:25,000
are in control of their lives.

211
0:11:27.08,000 --> 0:11:29,000
To me, that is health care delivered at home.

212
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Thank you.

213
0:11:31.24,000 --> 0:11:34,000
(Applause)

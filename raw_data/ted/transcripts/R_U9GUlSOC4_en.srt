2
0:00:15.49,000 --> 0:00:19,000
two years ago I was invited as an artist

3
0:00:18.92,000 --> 0:00:22,000
to participate in an exhibition

4
0:00:20.45,000 --> 0:00:25,000
commemorating 100 years of Islamic art

5
0:00:23.09,000 --> 0:00:28,000
in Europe the curator had only one

6
0:00:25.79,000 --> 0:00:31,000
condition I had to use the Arabic script

7
0:00:28.43,000 --> 0:00:34,000
for my art work now as an artist a woman

8
0:00:32.15,000 --> 0:00:38,000
an Arab or a human being living in the

9
0:00:35.15,000 --> 0:00:43,000
world in 2010 I only had one thing to

10
0:00:38.78,000 --> 0:00:46,000
say I wanted to say no and in Arabic to

11
0:00:43.82,000 --> 0:00:49,000
say no we say no and a thousand times no

12
0:00:46.809,000 --> 0:00:51,000
so I decided to look for a thousand

13
0:00:50.12,000 --> 0:00:54,000
different nose on everything ever

14
0:00:52.309,000 --> 0:00:58,000
produced under Islamic or Arab patronage

15
0:00:55.07,000 --> 0:01:02,000
in the past 1400 years from Spain to the

16
0:00:59.12,000 --> 0:01:05,000
borders of China I collected my findings

17
0:01:02.78,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and a book placed them chronologically

18
0:01:05.47,000 --> 0:01:11,000
stating the name the patron the medium

19
0:01:08.48,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and the date now the book sat on a small

20
0:01:11.96,000 --> 0:01:15,000
shelf next to the installation which

21
0:01:13.97,000 --> 0:01:2,000
stood three by seven meters in Munich

22
0:01:16.7,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Germany in September of 2010 now in

23
0:01:21.59,000 --> 0:01:29,000
January 2011 the Revolution started and

24
0:01:26.66,000 --> 0:01:3,000
life stopped for eighteen days and on

25
0:01:29.96,000 --> 0:01:32,000
the 12th of February we naively

26
0:01:31.31,000 --> 0:01:35,000
celebrated on the streets of Cairo

27
0:01:33.73,000 --> 0:01:38,000
believing that the revolution had

28
0:01:36.2,000 --> 0:01:41,000
succeeded nine months later I found

29
0:01:39.41,000 --> 0:01:46,000
myself spraying messages in Tahrir

30
0:01:42.11,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Square the reason for this act was this

31
0:01:46.43,000 --> 0:01:51,000
image that I saw in my newsfeed I did

32
0:01:50.24,000 --> 0:01:54,000
not feel that I could live in a city

33
0:01:52.21,000 --> 0:01:57,000
where people were being killed and

34
0:01:54.98,000 --> 0:01:58,000
thrown like garbage on the street so I

35
0:01:57.83,000 --> 0:02:01,000
took one know of a tombstone from the

36
0:01:59.96,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Islamic Museum in Cairo and I added a

37
0:02:02.15,000 --> 0:02:07,000
message to it no to military rule and I

38
0:02:05.6,000 --> 0:02:08,000
started spraying that occur on the

39
0:02:07.28,000 --> 0:02:1,000
streets in Cairo but that led to a

40
0:02:09.259,000 --> 0:02:13,000
series of no coming out of the book like

41
0:02:11.239,000 --> 0:02:15,000
a munition and adding messages to them

42
0:02:13.97,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and I started spraying them on the walls

43
0:02:15.769,000 --> 0:02:19,000
so I'll be sharing some of these nose

44
0:02:18.23,000 --> 0:02:22,000
with you note a new Pharaoh because

45
0:02:20.66,000 --> 0:02:24,000
whoever comes next should understand

46
0:02:22.43,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that you will never be ruled by another

47
0:02:24.71,000 --> 0:02:3,000
dictator no to violence romneyís some

48
0:02:27.65,000 --> 0:02:32,000
came to the Herald on the second day of

49
0:02:30.71,000 --> 0:02:35,000
the Revolution and he sat there with his

50
0:02:33.17,000 --> 0:02:4,000
guitar singing one month after Mubarak

51
0:02:36.65,000 --> 0:02:41,000
stepped down this was his reward no -

52
0:02:40.91,000 --> 0:02:43,000
blinding heroes

53
0:02:42.17,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Ahmed Herrera lost his right eye on the

54
0:02:44.78,000 --> 0:02:49,000
28th of January and he lost his left eye

55
0:02:47.9,000 --> 0:02:54,000
on the 19th of November by two different

56
0:02:50.51,000 --> 0:02:56,000
snipers no to killing in this case no to

57
0:02:54.98,000 --> 0:02:59,000
killing men of religion because she can

58
0:02:57.05,000 --> 0:03:03,000
imagine a life that was shot on December

59
0:03:00.74,000 --> 0:03:06,000
16th during a demonstration leaving

60
0:03:03.38,000 --> 0:03:09,000
behind three orphans and the widow not

61
0:03:07.58,000 --> 0:03:12,000
two burning books the Institute of Egypt

62
0:03:09.65,000 --> 0:03:16,000
was burned on December 17th a huge

63
0:03:12.59,000 --> 0:03:18,000
cultural loss no to stripping the people

64
0:03:16.67,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and the blue bra is to remind us of our

65
0:03:19.37,000 --> 0:03:25,000
shame as a nation when we allow a veiled

66
0:03:22.88,000 --> 0:03:28,000
woman to be stripped and beaten on the

67
0:03:25.76,000 --> 0:03:3,000
street and the footprint reads long live

68
0:03:28.94,000 --> 0:03:33,000
a peaceful revolution because we will

69
0:03:31.13,000 --> 0:03:38,000
never retaliate with violence no to

70
0:03:34.31,000 --> 0:03:41,000
barrier walls On February 5th concrete

71
0:03:38.65,000 --> 0:03:44,000
roadblocks were set up in Cairo to

72
0:03:41.77,000 --> 0:03:47,000
protect the Ministry of Defense from

73
0:03:45.11,000 --> 0:03:5,000
protesters now speaking of words I want

74
0:03:48.68,000 --> 0:03:54,000
to share with you the story of one wall

75
0:03:50.42,000 --> 0:03:56,000
in Cairo a group of artists decided to

76
0:03:54.92,000 --> 0:03:59,000
paint a life-size tank on a wall it's

77
0:03:57.41,000 --> 0:04:02,000
one to one in front of this tank there's

78
0:04:00.68,000 --> 0:04:05,000
a man on a bicycle with a bread basket

79
0:04:02.96,000 --> 0:04:08,000
on his head to any passerby there's no

80
0:04:05.87,000 --> 0:04:09,000
problem with this visual after acts of

81
0:04:09.65,000 --> 0:04:13,000
violence

82
0:04:10.22,000 --> 0:04:16,000
another artist came painted blood

83
0:04:13.99,000 --> 0:04:18,000
protesters being run over by the tank

84
0:04:16.84,000 --> 0:04:21,000
demonstrators and the message that read

85
0:04:19.57,000 --> 0:04:25,000
starting tomorrow I wear the new face

86
0:04:22.55,000 --> 0:04:28,000
the face of every martyr I exist

87
0:04:26.35,000 --> 0:04:32,000
authority comes paints the worldwide

88
0:04:29.03,000 --> 0:04:37,000
leaves the tank and adds a message army

89
0:04:32.75,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and people one-hand Egypt for Egyptians

90
0:04:37.309,000 --> 0:04:42,000
now the artist comes paints the head of

91
0:04:40.519,000 --> 0:04:44,000
the military as a monster eating a

92
0:04:42.559,000 --> 0:04:48,000
maiden in a river of blood in front of

93
0:04:45.379,000 --> 0:04:51,000
the tank authority comes paints the

94
0:04:48.709,000 --> 0:04:52,000
worldwide leaves the tank leaves the

95
0:04:51.559,000 --> 0:04:54,000
food and throws a bucket of black paint

96
0:04:53.659,000 --> 0:04:57,000
just to hide the face of the monster

97
0:04:55.459,000 --> 0:05:,000
so I come with my stencils and I spray

98
0:04:58.309,000 --> 0:05:02,000
them on the suit on the tank and on the

99
0:05:01.099,000 --> 0:05:06,000
whole world and this is how it stands

100
0:05:03.049,000 --> 0:05:09,000
today until further notice now I want to

101
0:05:06.649,000 --> 0:05:11,000
leave you with a final with a final know

102
0:05:09.199,000 --> 0:05:14,000

103
0:05:12.619,000 --> 0:05:17,000
of paper in a field hospital and the

104
0:05:14.629,000 --> 0:05:21,000
idea and I decided to take a now of

105
0:05:18.399,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Mameluke mausoleum in Cairo the message

106

0:05:31.699,000 --> 0:05:33,000

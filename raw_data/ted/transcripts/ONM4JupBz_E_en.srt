2
0:00:15.965,000 --> 0:00:17,000
In System D, this

3
0:00:18.19,000 --> 0:00:2,000
is a store,

4
0:00:20.237,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and what I mean by that is that this is a photograph

5
0:00:22.564,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I took in Makoko, shantytown in Lagos, Nigeria.

6
0:00:27.879,000 --> 0:00:29,000
It's built over the lagoon, and there are no streets

7
0:00:30.262,000 --> 0:00:31,000
where there can be stores to shop,

8
0:00:32.078,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and so the store comes to you.

9
0:00:33.968,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And in the same community,

10
0:00:35.753,000 --> 0:00:36,000
this is business synergy.

11
0:00:37.505,000 --> 0:00:41,000
This is the boat that that lady was paddling around in,

12
0:00:41.611,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and this artisan makes the boat and the paddles

13
0:00:44.351,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and sells directly

14
0:00:45.656,000 --> 0:00:47,000
to the people who need the boat and the paddles.

15
0:00:47.82,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And this is a global business.

16
0:00:50.002,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Ogandiro smokes fish in Makoko in Lagos,

17
0:00:54.128,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and I asked her, "Where does the fish come from?"

18
0:00:57.089,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And I thought she'd say, "Oh, you know,

19
0:00:59.815,000 --> 0:01:01,000
up the lagoon somewhere, or maybe across Africa,"

20
0:01:02.716,000 --> 0:01:03,000
but you'll be happy to know she said

21
0:01:04.147,000 --> 0:01:06,000
it came from here, it comes from the North Sea.

22
0:01:06.204,000 --> 0:01:08,000
It's caught here, frozen, shipped down to Lagos,

23
0:01:08.53,000 --> 0:01:11,000
smoked, and sold for a tiny increment of profit

24
0:01:11.617,000 --> 0:01:12,000
on the streets of Lagos.

25
0:01:13.139,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And this is a business incubator.

26
0:01:14.99,000 --> 0:01:17,000
This is Olusosun dump, the largest garbage dump in Lagos,

27
0:01:18.692,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and 2,000 people work here, and I found this out

28
0:01:21.763,000 --> 0:01:23,000
from this fellow, Andrew Saboru.

29
0:01:24.181,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Andrew spent 16 years scavenging materials on the dump,

30
0:01:28.341,000 --> 0:01:31,000
earned enough money to turn himself into a contract scaler,

31
0:01:31.569,000 --> 0:01:33,000
which meant he carried a scale and went around and

32
0:01:34.179,000 --> 0:01:36,000
weighed all the materials that people had scavenged

33
0:01:36.403,000 --> 0:01:39,000
from the dump. Now he's a scrap dealer.

34
0:01:39.426,000 --> 0:01:41,000
That's his little depot behind him,

35
0:01:41.827,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and he earns twice the Nigerian minimum wage.

36
0:01:46.338,000 --> 0:01:48,000
This is a shopping mall.

37
0:01:48.6,000 --> 0:01:5,000
This is Oshodi Market in Lagos.

38
0:01:50.775,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Jorge Luis Borges had a story called "The Aleph,"

39
0:01:53.121,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and the Aleph is a point in the world

40
0:01:54.944,000 --> 0:01:56,000
where absolutely everything exists,

41
0:01:57.239,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and for me, this image is a point in the world

42
0:01:59.584,000 --> 0:02:01,000
where absolutely everything exists.

43
0:02:02.048,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So, what am I talking about when I talk about System D?

44
0:02:04.897,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It's traditionally called the informal economy,

45
0:02:07.196,000 --> 0:02:1,000
the underground economy, the black market.

46
0:02:10.824,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I don't conceive of it that way.

47
0:02:13.117,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I think it's really important to understand that something like

48
0:02:15.874,000 --> 0:02:19,000
this is totally open. It's right there for you to find.

49
0:02:20.354,000 --> 0:02:22,000
All of this is happening openly, and aboveboard.

50
0:02:23.081,000 --> 0:02:25,000
There's nothing underground about it.

51
0:02:25.603,000 --> 0:02:28,000
It's our prejudgment that it's underground.

52
0:02:28.985,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I've pirated the term System D from the former French colonies.

53
0:02:33.49,000 --> 0:02:36,000
There's a word in French that is débrouillardise,

54
0:02:36.586,000 --> 0:02:38,000
that means to be self-reliant,

55
0:02:38.706,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and the former French colonies have turned that into

56
0:02:42.069,000 --> 0:02:44,000
System D for the economy of self-reliance,

57
0:02:44.626,000 --> 0:02:47,000
or the DIY economy.

58
0:02:47.884,000 --> 0:02:5,000
But governments hate the DIY economy,

59
0:02:51.013,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and that's why -- I took this picture in 2007,

60
0:02:54.257,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and this is the same market in 2009 --

61
0:02:58.809,000 --> 0:03:,000
and I think, when the organizers of this conference

62
0:03:01.115,000 --> 0:03:02,000
were talking about radical openness,

63
0:03:02.542,000 --> 0:03:04,000
they didn't mean that the streets should be open

64
0:03:05.098,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and the people should be gone.

65
0:03:06.841,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I think what we have is a pickle problem.

66
0:03:10.784,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I had a friend who worked at a pickle factory,

67
0:03:13.724,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and the cucumbers would come flying down

68
0:03:15.625,000 --> 0:03:19,000
this conveyer belt, and his job was to pick off the ones

69
0:03:19.628,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that didn't look so good and throw them in the bin

70
0:03:21.977,000 --> 0:03:22,000
labeled "relish" where they'd be crushed and mixed

71
0:03:23.883,000 --> 0:03:26,000
with vinegar and used for other kinds of profit.

72
0:03:27.209,000 --> 0:03:29,000
This is the pickle economy.

73
0:03:29.52,000 --> 0:03:31,000
We're all focusing on — this is a statistic from

74
0:03:32.025,000 --> 0:03:34,000
earlier this month in the Financial Times —

75
0:03:34.604,000 --> 0:03:37,000
we're all focusing on the luxury economy.

76
0:03:38.147,000 --> 0:03:4,000
It's worth 1.5 trillion dollars every year, and that's

77
0:03:40.89,000 --> 0:03:41,000
a vast amount of money, right?

78
0:03:42.634,000 --> 0:03:45,000
That's three times the Gross Domestic Product of Switzerland.

79
0:03:45.882,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So it's vast. But it should come with an asterisk,

80
0:03:50.68,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and the asterisk is that it excludes two thirds of the workers

81
0:03:54.873,000 --> 0:03:55,000
of the world.

82
0:03:55.926,000 --> 0:03:58,000
1.8 billion people around the world work

83
0:03:59.315,000 --> 0:04:04,000
in the economy that is unregulated and informal.

84
0:04:04.851,000 --> 0:04:07,000
That's a huge number, and what does that mean?

85
0:04:08.131,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Well, it means if it were united in a single political system,

86
0:04:12.884,000 --> 0:04:16,000
one country, call it

87
0:04:17.139,000 --> 0:04:2,000
"The United Street Sellers Republic," the U.S.S.R.,

88
0:04:20.14,000 --> 0:04:21,000
or "Bazaaristan,"

89
0:04:21.973,000 --> 0:04:25,000
it would be worth 10 trillion dollars every year,

90
0:04:26.249,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and that would make it the second largest economy

91
0:04:28.305,000 --> 0:04:3,000
in the world, after the United States.

92
0:04:30.786,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And given that projections are that the bulk

93
0:04:33.626,000 --> 0:04:36,000
of economic growth over the next 15 years will come

94
0:04:37.291,000 --> 0:04:4,000
from emerging economies in the developing world,

95
0:04:40.663,000 --> 0:04:42,000
it could easily overtake the United States

96
0:04:42.794,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and become the largest economy in the world.

97
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So the implications of that are vast, because it means

98
0:04:49.695,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that this is where employment is — 1.8 billion people —

99
0:04:53.218,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and this is where we can create a more egalitarian world,

100
0:04:57.84,000 --> 0:05:,000
because people are actually able to earn money and live

101
0:05:01.811,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and thrive, as Andrew Saboru did.

102
0:05:04.806,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Big businesses have recognized this,

103
0:05:06.967,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and what's fascinating about this slide,

104
0:05:08.946,000 --> 0:05:1,000
it's not that the guys can carry boxes on their heads

105
0:05:11.204,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and run around without dropping them off.

106
0:05:13.719,000 --> 0:05:16,000
it's that the Gala sausage roll is a product that's made

107
0:05:16.814,000 --> 0:05:18,000
by a global company called UAC foods

108
0:05:19.524,000 --> 0:05:21,000
that's active throughout Africa and the Middle East,

109
0:05:22.091,000 --> 0:05:25,000
but the Gala sausage roll is not sold in stores.

110
0:05:25.78,000 --> 0:05:28,000
UAC foods has recognized that it won't sell if it's in stores.

111
0:05:29.117,000 --> 0:05:33,000
It's only sold by a phalanx of street hawkers

112
0:05:33.222,000 --> 0:05:35,000
who run around the streets of Lagos at bus stations

113
0:05:36.035,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and in traffic jams and sell it as a snack,

114
0:05:40.508,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and it's been sold that way for 40 years.

115
0:05:43.53,000 --> 0:05:45,000
It's a business plan for a corporation.

116
0:05:45.7,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And it's not just in Africa.

117
0:05:48.193,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Here's Mr. Clean looking amorously at all the other

118
0:05:51.306,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Procter & Gamble products,

119
0:05:53.226,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and Procter & Gamble, you know,

120
0:05:55.674,000 --> 0:05:57,000
the statistic always cited is that Wal-Mart

121
0:05:58.251,000 --> 0:06:02,000
is their largest customer, and it's true, as one store,

122
0:06:03.107,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Wal-Mart buys 15 percent, thus 15 percent

123
0:06:06.294,000 --> 0:06:09,000
of Procter & Gamble's business is with Wal-Mart,

124
0:06:09.394,000 --> 0:06:12,000
but their largest market segment is something that they call

125
0:06:12.955,000 --> 0:06:14,000
"high frequency stores," which is all these tiny kiosks

126
0:06:15.875,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and the lady in the canoe and all these other businesses

127
0:06:19.186,000 --> 0:06:24,000
that exist in System D, the informal economy,

128
0:06:24.533,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and Procter & Gamble makes 20 percent of its money

129
0:06:27.931,000 --> 0:06:29,000
from that market segment,

130
0:06:29.98,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and it's the only market segment that's growing.

131
0:06:33.416,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So Procter & Gamble says, "We don't care whether a store

132
0:06:36.524,000 --> 0:06:38,000
is incorporated or registered or anything like that.

133
0:06:39.418,000 --> 0:06:42,000
We want our products in that store."

134
0:06:43.251,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And then there's mobile phones.

135
0:06:45.423,000 --> 0:06:46,000
This is an ad for MTN,

136
0:06:47.263,000 --> 0:06:49,000
which is a South African multinational

137
0:06:49.905,000 --> 0:06:51,000
active in about 25 countries,

138
0:06:52.654,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and when they came into Nigeria —

139
0:06:54.215,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Nigeria is the big dog in Africa.

140
0:06:56.172,000 --> 0:06:58,000
One in seven Africans is a Nigerian,

141
0:06:58.496,000 --> 0:07:,000
and so everyone wants in to the mobile phone market

142
0:07:01.198,000 --> 0:07:03,000
in Nigeria. And when MTN came in, they wanted

143
0:07:03.232,000 --> 0:07:05,000
to sell the mobile service like I get in the United States

144
0:07:06.192,000 --> 0:07:09,000
or like people get here in the U.K. or in Europe --

145
0:07:09.966,000 --> 0:07:12,000
expensive monthly plans, you get a phone,

146
0:07:13.855,000 --> 0:07:15,000
you pay overages,

147
0:07:15.855,000 --> 0:07:17,000
you're killed with fees --

148
0:07:17.983,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and their plan crashed and burned.

149
0:07:19.787,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And they went back to the drawing board, and they retooled,

150
0:07:21.827,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and they came up with another plan:

151
0:07:23.331,000 --> 0:07:25,000
We don't sell you the phone,

152
0:07:25.517,000 --> 0:07:26,000
we don't sell you the monthly plan.

153
0:07:27.347,000 --> 0:07:3,000
We only sell you airtime.

154
0:07:30.483,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And where's the airtime sold?

155
0:07:32.396,000 --> 0:07:36,000
It's sold at umbrella stands all over the streets,

156
0:07:36.489,000 --> 0:07:39,000
where people are unregistered, unlicensed,

157
0:07:40.213,000 --> 0:07:42,000
but MTN makes most of its profits,

158
0:07:42.918,000 --> 0:07:44,000
perhaps 90 percent of its profits,

159
0:07:45.605,000 --> 0:07:49,000
from selling through System D, the informal economy.

160
0:07:50.267,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And where do the phones come from?

161
0:07:52.103,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Well, they come from here. This is in Guangzhou, China,

162
0:07:54.977,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and if you go upstairs in this rather sleepy looking

163
0:07:58.413,000 --> 0:08:02,000
electronics mall, you find the Guangzhou Dashatou

164
0:08:03.039,000 --> 0:08:05,000
second-hand trade center,

165
0:08:05.912,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and if you go in there, you follow the guys with the muscles

166
0:08:09.096,000 --> 0:08:11,000
who are carrying the boxes, and where are they going?

167
0:08:11.758,000 --> 0:08:13,000
They're going to Eddy in Lagos.

168
0:08:14.575,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Now, most of the phones there are not second-hand at all.

169
0:08:17.279,000 --> 0:08:18,000
The name is a misnomer.

170
0:08:18.586,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Most of them are pirated. They have the name brand

171
0:08:21.494,000 --> 0:08:24,000
on them, but they're not manufactured by the name brand.

172
0:08:24.575,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Now, are there downsides to that?

173
0:08:27.231,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Well, I guess. You know, China has no —

174
0:08:30.479,000 --> 0:08:33,000
(Laughter) — no intellectual property, right?

175
0:08:33.771,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Versace without the vowels.

176
0:08:35.672,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Zhuomani instead of Armani.

177
0:08:37.734,000 --> 0:08:42,000
S. Guuuci, and -- (Laughter) (Applause)

178
0:08:42.741,000 --> 0:08:45,000
All around the world this is how products

179
0:08:45.87,000 --> 0:08:47,000
are being distributed, so, for instance,

180
0:08:48.39,000 --> 0:08:51,000
in one street market on Rua 25 de Março

181
0:08:51.549,000 --> 0:08:52,000
in São Paulo, Brazil,

182
0:08:53.518,000 --> 0:08:56,000
you can buy fake designer glasses.

183
0:08:56.814,000 --> 0:08:58,000
You can buy cloned cologne.

184
0:08:58.877,000 --> 0:09:,000
You can buy pirated DVDs, of course.

185
0:09:01.652,000 --> 0:09:03,000
You can buy New York Yankees caps

186
0:09:04.509,000 --> 0:09:07,000
in all sorts of unauthorized patterns.

187
0:09:07.715,000 --> 0:09:1,000
You can buy cuecas baratas, designer underwear

188
0:09:10.804,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that isn't really manufactured by a designer,

189
0:09:13.101,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and even pirated evangelical mixtapes. (Laughter)

190
0:09:17.475,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Now, businesses tend to complain about this,

191
0:09:20.229,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and their, they, I don't want to take away from their

192
0:09:23.768,000 --> 0:09:25,000
entire validity of complaining about it,

193
0:09:25.806,000 --> 0:09:29,000
but I did ask a major sneaker manufacturer earlier this year

194
0:09:30.304,000 --> 0:09:32,000
what they thought about piracy,

195
0:09:33.201,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and they told me, "Well, you can't quote me on this,

196
0:09:34.548,000 --> 0:09:36,000
because if you quote me on this, I have to kill you,"

197
0:09:36.648,000 --> 0:09:41,000
but they use piracy as market research.

198
0:09:42.352,000 --> 0:09:45,000
The sneaker manufacturer told me that if

199
0:09:45.576,000 --> 0:09:48,000
they find that Pumas are being pirated, or Adidas

200
0:09:49.263,000 --> 0:09:52,000
are being pirated and their sneakers aren't being pirated,

201
0:09:52.549,000 --> 0:09:54,000
they know they've done something wrong. (Laughter)

202
0:09:55.434,000 --> 0:09:58,000
So it's very important to them to track piracy

203
0:09:58.511,000 --> 0:10:,000
exactly because of this, and the people who are buying,

204
0:10:00.875,000 --> 0:10:02,000
the pirates, are not their customers anyway,

205
0:10:02.995,000 --> 0:10:04,000
because their customers want the real deal.

206
0:10:05.727,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Now, there's another problem.

207
0:10:07.22,000 --> 0:10:1,000
This is a real street sign in Lagos, Nigeria.

208
0:10:10.552,000 --> 0:10:13,000
All of System D really doesn't pay taxes, right?

209
0:10:13.616,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And when I think about that, first of all I think that

210
0:10:15.421,000 --> 0:10:18,000
government is a social contract between the people and

211
0:10:19.135,000 --> 0:10:21,000
the government, and if the government isn't transparent,

212
0:10:21.651,000 --> 0:10:23,000
then the people aren't going to be transparent either,

213
0:10:23.872,000 --> 0:10:26,000
but also that we're blaming the little guy

214
0:10:26.92,000 --> 0:10:27,000
who doesn't pay his taxes, and we're not recognizing

215
0:10:28.857,000 --> 0:10:3,000
that everyone's fudging things all over the world,

216
0:10:31.63,000 --> 0:10:35,000
including some extremely respected businesses,

217
0:10:35.663,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and I'll give you one example.

218
0:10:36.803,000 --> 0:10:4,000
There was one company that paid 4,000 bribes

219
0:10:40.954,000 --> 0:10:42,000
in the first decade of this millennium, and

220
0:10:43.352,000 --> 0:10:47,000
a million dollars in bribes every business day, right?

221
0:10:48.253,000 --> 0:10:5,000
All over the world. And that company

222
0:10:50.548,000 --> 0:10:52,000
was the big German electronics giant Siemens.

223
0:10:53.454,000 --> 0:10:56,000
So this goes on in the formal economy

224
0:10:57.332,000 --> 0:10:59,000
as well as the informal economy,

225
0:10:59.53,000 --> 0:11:01,000
so it's wrong of us to blame — and I'm not singling out

226
0:11:01.66,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Siemens, I'm saying everyone does it. Okay?

227
0:11:05.379,000 --> 0:11:08,000
I just want to end by saying that if Adam Smith

228
0:11:08.828,000 --> 0:11:1,000
had framed out a theory of the flea market

229
0:11:11.668,000 --> 0:11:14,000
instead of the free market, what would be some

230
0:11:14.979,000 --> 0:11:16,000
of the principles?

231
0:11:16.988,000 --> 0:11:19,000
First, it would be to understand that it could be

232
0:11:20.748,000 --> 0:11:22,000
considered a cooperative, and this is a thought

233
0:11:22.939,000 --> 0:11:26,000
from the Brazilian legal scholar Roberto Mangabeira Unger.

234
0:11:27.524,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Cooperative development is a way forward.

235
0:11:30.117,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Secondly, from the [Austrian] anarchist philosopher Paul Feyerabend,

236
0:11:34.795,000 --> 0:11:38,000
facts are relative, and what is a massive right

237
0:11:39.083,000 --> 0:11:41,000
of self-reliance to a Nigerian businessperson

238
0:11:42.068,000 --> 0:11:46,000
is considered unauthorized and horrible to other people,

239
0:11:46.079,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and we have to recognize that there are differences

240
0:11:48.096,000 --> 0:11:5,000
in how people define things and what their facts are.

241
0:11:50.153,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And third is, and I'm taking this from

242
0:11:53.253,000 --> 0:11:56,000
the great American beat poet Allen Ginsberg,

243
0:11:56.533,000 --> 0:11:59,000
that alternate economies barter and

244
0:11:59.685,000 --> 0:12:01,000
different kinds of currency, alternate currencies

245
0:12:02.436,000 --> 0:12:04,000
are also very important, and he talked about

246
0:12:05.278,000 --> 0:12:07,000
buying what he needed just with his good looks.

247
0:12:08.269,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And so I just want to leave you there, and say that

248
0:12:11.9,000 --> 0:12:15,000
this economy is a tremendous force for global development

249
0:12:16.116,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and we need to think about it that way.

250
0:12:18.083,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Thank you very much. (Applause)

251
0:12:21.099,000 --> 0:12:24,000
(Applause)

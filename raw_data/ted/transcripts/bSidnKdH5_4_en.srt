1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
OK. We've heard a lot of people

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
speak at this conference

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
about the power of the human mind.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And what I'd like to do today

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
is give you a vivid example

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
of how that power can be unleashed

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
when someone is in a survival situation,

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
how the will to survive can bring that out in people.

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
This is an incident which occurred on Mount Everest;

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
it was the worst disaster in the history of Everest.

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And when it occurred, I was the only doctor on the mountain.

12
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
So I'll take you through that

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and we'll see what it's like

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
when someone really

15
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
summons the will to survive.

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
OK, this is Mount Everest.

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
It's 29,035 feet high.

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I've been there six times: Four times I did work with National Geographic,

19
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
making tectonic plate measurements;

20
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
twice, I went with NASA

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
doing remote sensing devices.

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
It was on my fourth trip to Everest

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that a comet passed over the mountain. Hyakutake.

24
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And the Sherpas told us then

25
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
that was a very bad omen,

26
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and we should have listened to them.

27
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Everest is an extreme environment.

28
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
There's only one-third as much oxygen at the summit as there is at sea level.

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Near the summit, temperatures

30
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
can be 40 degrees below zero.

31
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
You can have winds 20 to 40 miles an hour.

32
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
It's actually a wind-chill factor

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
which is lower than a summer day on Mars.

34
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I remember one time being up near the summit,

35
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I reached into my down jacket

36
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
for a drink from my water bottle,

37
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
inside my down jacket,

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
only to discover that the water was already frozen solid.

39
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
That gives you an idea of just how severe

40
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
things are near the summit.

41
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
OK, this is the route up Everest.

42
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
It starts at base camp, at 17,500 feet.

43
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Camp One, 2,000 feet higher.

44
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Camp Two, another 2,000 feet higher up,

45
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
what's called the Western Cwm.

46
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
CampThree is at the base of Lhotse,

47
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
which is the fourth highest mountain in the world, but it's dwarfed by Everest.

48
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And then Camp Four is the highest camp;

49
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that's 3,000 feet short of the summit.

50
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
This is a view of base camp.

51
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
This is pitched on a glacier at 17,500 feet.

52
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
It's the highest point you can bring your yaks

53
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
before you have to unload.

54
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And this is what they unloaded for me:

55
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I had four yak loads of medical supplies,

56
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
which are dumped in a tent,

57
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and here I am trying to arrange things.

58
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
This was our expedition.

59
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
It was a National Geographic expedition,

60
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
but it was organized by The Explorers Club.

61
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
There were three other expeditions on the mountain,

62
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
an American team, a New Zealand team

63
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and an IMAX team.

64
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And, after actually two months of preparation,

65
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
we built our camps all the way up the mountain.

66
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
This is a view looking up the icefall,

67
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
the first 2,000 feet of the climb

68
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
up from base camp.

69
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And here's a picture in the icefall;

70
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
it's a waterfall, but it's frozen, but it moves very slowly,

71
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and it actually changes every day.

72
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
When you're in it, you're like a rat in a maze;

73
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
you can't even see over the top.

74
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
This is near the top of the icefall.

75
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
You want to climb through at night when the ice is frozen.

76
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
That way, it's less likely to tumble down on you.

77
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
These are some climbers reaching the top of the icefall just at sun-up.

78
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
This is me crossing a crevasse.

79
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
We cross on aluminum ladders with safety ropes attached.

80
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
That's another crevasse.

81
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Some of these things are 10 stories deep or more,

82
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and one of my climbing friends says that

83
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
the reason we actually climb at night

84
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
is because if we ever saw the bottom

85
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
of what we're climbing over,

86
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
we would never do it.

87
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Okay. This is Camp One.

88
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
It's the first flat spot you can reach

89
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
after you get up to the top of the icefall.

90
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And from there we climb up to Camp Two,

91
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
which is sort of the foreground.

92
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
These are climbers moving up the Lhotse face,

93
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that mountain toward Camp Three.

94
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
They're on fixed ropes here.

95
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
A fall here, if you weren't roped in,

96
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
would be 5,000 feet down.

97
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
This is a view taken from camp three.

98
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
You can see the Lhotse face is in profile,

99
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
it's about a 45 degree angle. It takes two days to climb it,

100
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
so you put the camp halfway through.

101
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
If you notice, the summit of Everest is black.

102
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
There's no ice over it.

103
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And that's because Everest is so high,

104
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
it's in the jet stream,

105
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and winds are constantly scouring the face,

106
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
so no snow gets to accumulate.

107
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
What looks like a cloud behind the summit ridge

108
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
is actually snow being blown off the summit.

109
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
This is on the way up from Camp Three to Camp Four,

110
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
moving in, up through the clouds.

111
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And this is at Camp Four.

112
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Once you get to Camp Four, you have maybe 24 hours

113
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to decide if you're going to go for the summit or not.

114
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Everybody's on oxygen, your supplies are limited,

115
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and you either have to go up or go down,

116
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
make that decision very quickly.

117
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
This is a picture of Rob Hall.

118
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
He was the leader of the New Zealand team.

119
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
This is a radio he used later to call his wife

120
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that I'll tell you about.

121
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
These are some climbers waiting to go to the summit.

122
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
They're up at Camp Four, and you can see that there's wind blowing off the summit.

123
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
This is not good weather to climb in,

124
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
so the climbers are just waiting, hoping that the wind's going to die down.

125
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And, in fact, the wind does die down at night.

126
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
It becomes very calm, there's no wind at all.

127
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
This looks like a good chance to go for the summit.

128
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So here are some climbers starting out for the summit

129
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
on what's called the Triangular Face.

130
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
It's the first part of climb.

131
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
It's done in the dark, because it's actually less steep than what comes next,

132
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and you can gain daylight hours if you do this in the dark.

133
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So that's what happened.

134
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
The climbers got on the southeast ridge.

135
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
This is the view looking at the southeast ridge.

136
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
The summit would be in the foreground.

137
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
From here, it's about 1,500 feet

138
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
up at a 30-degree angle to the summit.

139
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
But what happened that year was

140
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
the wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up.

141
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
A storm blew in that no one was anticipating.

142
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
You can see here some ferocious winds

143
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
blowing snow way high off the summit.

144
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And there were climbers on that summit ridge.

145
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
This is a picture of me in that area

146
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
taken a year before,

147
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and you can see I've got an oxygen mask on

148
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
with a rebreather.

149
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I have an oxygen hose connected here.

150
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
You can see on this climber, we have two oxygen tanks in the backpack --

151
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
little titanium tanks, very lightweight --

152
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and we're not carrying much else.

153
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
This is all you've got. You're very exposed on the summit ridge.

154
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
OK, this is a view taken on the summit ridge itself.

155
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
This is on the way toward the summit,

156
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
on that 1,500-foot bridge.

157
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
All the climbers here are climbing unroped,

158
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and the reason is because

159
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
the drop off is so sheer on either side

160
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
that if you were roped to somebody,

161
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
you'd wind up just pulling them off with you.

162
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So each person climbs individually.

163
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And it's not a straight path at all,

164
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
it's very difficult climbing,

165
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and there's always the risk

166
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
of falling on either side.

167
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
If you fall to your left, you're going to fall

168
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
8,000 feet into Nepal;

169
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
if you fall to your right,

170
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
you're going to fall 12,000 feet into Tibet.

171
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So it's probably better to fall into Tibet

172
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
because you'll live longer.

173
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
(Laughter)

174
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
But, either way, you fall for the rest of your life.

175
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
OK. Those climbers were up near the summit,

176
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
along that summit ridge that you see up there,

177
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and I was down here in Camp Three.

178
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
My expedition was down in Camp Three,

179
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
while these guys were up there in the storm.

180
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
The storm was so fierce that we had to lay,

181
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
fully dressed, fully equipped,

182
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
laid out on the tent floor

183
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
to stop the tent from blowing off the mountain.

184
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
It was the worst winds I've ever seen.

185
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
And the climbers up on the ridge

186
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
were that much higher, 2,000 feet higher,

187
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and completely exposed to the elements.

188
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
We were in radio contact with some of them.

189
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
This is a view taken along the summit ridge.

190
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Rob Hall, we heard by radio,

191
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
was up here, at this point in the storm

192
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
with Doug Hansen.

193
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And we heard that Rob was OK,

194
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
but Doug was too weak to come down.

195
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
He was exhausted, and Rob was staying with him.

196
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
We also got some bad news in the storm

197
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that Beck Weathers, another climber,

198
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
had collapsed in the snow and was dead.

199
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
There were still 18 other climbers

200
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
that we weren't aware of their condition.

201
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
They were lost. There was total confusion on the mountain;

202
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
all the stories were confusing, most of them were conflicting.

203
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
We really had no idea what was going on during that storm.

204
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
We were just hunkered down

205
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
in our tents at Camp Three.

206
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Our two strongest climbers, Todd Burleson and Pete Athans,

207
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
decided to go up to try to rescue who they could

208
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
even though there was a ferocious storm going.

209
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
They tried to radio a message to Rob Hall,

210
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
who was a superb climber

211
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
stuck, sort of, with a weak climber

212
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
up near the summit.

213
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
I expected them to say to Rob,

214
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
"Hold on. We're coming."

215
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
But in fact, what they said was,

216
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
"Leave Doug and come down yourself.

217
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
There's no chance of saving him,

218
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and just try to save yourself at this point."

219
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And Rob got that message,

220
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
but his answer was,

221
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
"We're both listening."

222
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Todd and Pete got up to the summit ridge, up in here,

223
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and it was a scene of complete chaos up there.

224
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
But they did what they could to stabilize the people.

225
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
I gave them radio advice from Camp Three,

226
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and we sent down the climbers that could make it down

227
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
under their own power.

228
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
The ones that couldn't we just sort of decided to leave up at Camp Four.

229
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
So the climbers were coming down along this route.

230
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
This is taken from Camp Three, where I was.

231
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And they all came by me

232
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
so I could take a look at them and see what I could do for them,

233
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
which is really not much, because Camp Three

234
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
is a little notch cut in the ice

235
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
in the middle of a 45-degree angle.

236
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
You can barely stand outside the tent.

237
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
It's really cold; it's 24,000 feet.

238
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
The only supplies I had at that altitude

239
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
were two plastic bags

240
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
with preloaded syringes

241
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
of painkiller and steroids.

242
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
So, as the climbers came by me,

243
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
I sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition

244
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
to continue on further down.

245
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
The ones that weren't that lucid or were not that well coordinated,

246
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
I would give an injection of steroids

247
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
to try to give them some period

248
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
of lucidity and coordination

249
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
where they could then work their way further down the mountain.

250
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
It's so awkward to work up there that sometimes

251
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
I even gave the injections right through their clothes.

252
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
It was just too hard to maneuver

253
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
any other way up there.

254
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
While I was taking care of them,

255
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
we got more news about Rob Hall.

256
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
There was no way we could get up high enough to rescue him.

257
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
He called in to say that he was alone now.

258
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Apparently, Doug had died higher up on the mountain.

259
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
But Rob was now too weak to come down himself,

260
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and with the fierce winds and up at that altitude,

261
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
he was just beyond rescue

262
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and he knew it.

263
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
At that point, he asked

264
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
to be paged into his wife.

265
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
He was carrying a radio.

266
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
His wife was home in New Zealand,

267
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
seven months pregnant with their first child,

268
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and Rob asked to be patched into her. That was done,

269
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and Rob and his wife

270
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
had their last conversation.

271
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
They picked the name for their baby.

272
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Rob then signed off,

273
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and that was the last we ever heard of him.

274
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
I was faced with treating a lot of critically ill patients

275
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
at 24,000 feet,

276
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
which was an impossibility.

277
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
So what we did was, we got the victims

278
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
down to 21,000 feet, where it was easier for me to treat them.

279
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
This was my medical kit.

280
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
It's a tackle box filled with medical supplies.

281
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
This is what I carried up the mountain.

282
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
I had more supplies lower down,

283
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
which I asked to be brought up to meet me at the lower camp.

284
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And this was scene at the lower camp.

285
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
The survivors came in one by one.

286
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Some of them were hypothermic,

287
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
some of them were frostbitten, some were both.

288
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
What we did was try to warm them up as best we could,

289
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
put oxygen on them and try to revive them,

290
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
which is difficult to do at 21,000 feet,

291
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
when the tent is freezing.

292
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
This is some severe frostbite on the feet,

293
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
severe frostbite on the nose.

294
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
This climber was snow blind.

295
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
As I was taking care of these climbers,

296
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
we got a startling experience.

297
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Out of nowhere, Beck Weathers,

298
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
who we had already been told was dead,

299
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
stumbled into the tent,

300
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
just like a mummy, he walked into the tent.

301
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
I expected him to be incoherent,

302
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
but, in fact, he walked into the tent and said to me,

303
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
"Hi, Ken. Where should I sit?"

304
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And then he said,

305
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
"Do you accept my health insurance?"

306
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
(Laughter)

307
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
He really said that.

308
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
(Laughter)

309
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
So he was completely lucid, but he was very severely frostbitten.

310
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
You can see his hand is completely white;

311
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
his face, his nose, is burned.

312
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
First, it turns white, and then when it's completed necrosis,

313
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
it turns black, and then it falls off.

314
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
It's the last stage, just like a scar.

315
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
So, as I was taking care of Beck,

316
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
he related what had been going on up there.

317
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
He said he had gotten lost in the storm,

318
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
collapsed in the snow,

319
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and just laid there, unable to move.

320
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Some climbers had come by and looked at him,

321
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and he heard them say, "He's dead."

322
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
But Beck wasn't dead; he heard that,

323
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
but he was completely unable to move.

324
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
He was in some sort of catatonic state

325
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
where he could be aware of his surroundings,

326
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
but couldn't even blink to indicate that he was alive.

327
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
So the climbers passed him by,

328
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and Beck lay there for a day, a night

329
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and another day,

330
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
in the snow.

331
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And then he said to himself,

332
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
"I don't want to die.

333
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
I have a family to come back to."

334
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And the thoughts of his family,

335
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
his kids and his wife,

336
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
generated enough energy,

337
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
enough motivation in him,

338
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
so that he actually got up.

339
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
After laying in the snow that long a time,

340
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
he got up and found his way back to the camp.

341
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And Beck told me that story very quietly,

342
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
but I was absolutely stunned by it.

343
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
I couldn't imagine anybody laying in the snow

344
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
that long a time

345
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and then getting up.

346
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
He apparently reversed

347
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
an irreversible hypothermia.

348
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And I can only try to speculate

349
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
on how he did it.

350
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
So, what if we had Beck

351
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
hooked up to a SPECT scan,

352
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
something that could actually measure brain function?

353
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Just very simply, the three parts of the brain:

354
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
the frontal lobe, where you focus

355
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
your attention and concentration;

356
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
you have the temporal lobe,

357
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
where you form images and keep memories;

358
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and the posterior part of your brain,

359
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
which contains the cerebellum, which controls motion;

360
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
and the brain stem,

361
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
where you have your basic maintenance functions,

362
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
like heartbeat and respiration.

363
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
So let's take a cut through the brain here,

364
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and imagine that Beck

365
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
was hooked up to a SPECT scan.

366
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
This measures dynamic blood flow

367
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and therefore energy flow within the brain.

368
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
So you have the prefrontal cortex here,

369
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
lighting up in red.

370
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
This is a pretty evenly distributed scan.

371
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
You have the middle area,

372
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
where the temporal lobe might be, in here,

373
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and the posterior portion, where the maintenance functions are in the back.

374
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
This is a roughly normal scan,

375
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
showing equal distribution of energy.

376
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Now, you go to this one and you see how much more

377
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
the frontal lobes are lighting up.

378
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
This might be what Beck would be experiencing

379
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
when he realizes he's in danger.

380
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
He's focusing all his attention

381
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
on getting himself out of trouble.

382
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
These parts of the brain are quieting down.

383
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
He's not thinking about his family or anybody else at this point,

384
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
and he's working pretty hard.

385
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
He's trying to get his muscles going and get out of this.

386
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
OK, but he's losing ground here.

387
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
He's running out of energy.

388
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
It's too cold; he can't keep his metabolic fires going,

389
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and, you see, there's no more red here;

390
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
his brain is quieting down.

391
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
He's collapsed in the snow here. Everything is quiet,

392
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
there's very little red anywhere.

393
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Beck is powering down.

394
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
He's dying.

395
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
You go on to the next scan,

396
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
but, in Beck's case,

397
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
you can see that the middle part of his brain

398
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
is beginning to light up again.

399
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
He's beginning to think about his family.

400
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
He's beginning to have images

401
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
that are motivating him to get up.

402
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
He's developing energy in this area

403
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
through thought.

404
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
And this is how he's going to turn thought

405
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
back into action.

406
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
This part of the brain is called the anterior cingulate gyrus.

407
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
It's an area in which

408
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
a lot of neuroscientists believe

409
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
the seat of will exists.

410
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
This is where people make decisions, where they develop willpower.

411
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
And, you can see, there's an energy flow

412
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
going from the mid portion of his brain,

413
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
where he's got images of his family,

414
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
into this area, which is powering his will.

415
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
Okay. This is getting stronger and stronger

416
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
to the point where it's actually

417
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
going to be a motivating factor.

418
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
He's going to develop enough energy in that area --

419
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
after a day, a night and a day --

420
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
to actually motivate himself to get up.

421
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
And you can see here,

422
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
he's starting to get more energy into the frontal lobe.

423
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
He's beginning to focus, he can concentrate now.

424
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:06,000
He's thinking about what he's got to do to save himself.

425
0:18:06.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
So this energy has been transmitted

426
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
up toward the front of his brain,

427
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
and it's getting quieter down here,

428
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
but he's using this energy

429
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:17,000
to think about what he has to do to get himself going.

430
0:18:17.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
And then, that energy is sort of spreading

431
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
throughout his thought areas.

432
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
He's not thinking about his family now, and he's getting himself motivated.

433
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
This is the posterior part, where his muscles are going to be moving,

434
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
and he's going to be pacing himself.

435
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:18:33,000
His heart and lungs are going to pick up speed.

436
0:18:33.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
So this is what I can speculate might have been going on

437
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:39,000
had we been able to do a SPECT scan on Beck

438
0:18:39.26,000 --> 0:18:42,000
during this survival epic.

439
0:18:43.26,000 --> 0:18:46,000
So here I am taking care of Beck at 21,000 feet,

440
0:18:46.26,000 --> 0:18:49,000
and I felt what I was doing was completely trivial

441
0:18:49.26,000 --> 0:18:51,000
compared to what he had done for himself.

442
0:18:51.26,000 --> 0:18:54,000
It just shows you what the power of the mind can do.

443
0:18:56.26,000 --> 0:18:58,000
He was critically ill, there were other critically ill patients;

444
0:18:58.26,000 --> 0:19:,000
luckily, we were able to get a helicopter

445
0:19:00.26,000 --> 0:19:03,000
in to rescue these guys.

446
0:19:03.26,000 --> 0:19:06,000
A helicopter came in at 21,000 feet

447
0:19:06.26,000 --> 0:19:09,000
and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history.

448
0:19:10.26,000 --> 0:19:12,000
It was able to land on the ice, take away Beck

449
0:19:12.26,000 --> 0:19:15,000
and the other survivors, one by one,

450
0:19:15.26,000 --> 0:19:18,000
and get them off to Kathmandu in a clinic

451
0:19:18.26,000 --> 0:19:21,000
before we even got back to base camp.

452
0:19:21.26,000 --> 0:19:23,000
This is a scene at base camp,

453
0:19:23.26,000 --> 0:19:25,000
at one of the camps

454
0:19:25.26,000 --> 0:19:27,000
where some of the climbers were lost.

455
0:19:27.26,000 --> 0:19:29,000
And we had a memorial service there

456
0:19:29.26,000 --> 0:19:31,000
a few days later.

457
0:19:31.26,000 --> 0:19:34,000
These are Serphas lighting juniper branches.

458
0:19:34.26,000 --> 0:19:37,000
They believe juniper smoke is holy.

459
0:19:37.26,000 --> 0:19:41,000
And the climbers stood around on the high rocks

460
0:19:41.26,000 --> 0:19:44,000
and spoke of the climbers who were lost

461
0:19:44.26,000 --> 0:19:46,000
up near the summit,

462
0:19:46.26,000 --> 0:19:49,000
turning to the mountain, actually, to talk to them directly.

463
0:19:51.26,000 --> 0:19:53,000
There were five climbers lost here.

464
0:19:53.26,000 --> 0:19:56,000
This was Scott Fischer,

465
0:19:58.26,000 --> 0:20:,000
Rob Hall,

466
0:20:00.26,000 --> 0:20:02,000
Andy Harris,

467
0:20:02.26,000 --> 0:20:04,000
Doug Hansen

468
0:20:04.26,000 --> 0:20:06,000
and Yasuko Namba.

469
0:20:06.26,000 --> 0:20:08,000
And one more climber

470
0:20:08.26,000 --> 0:20:11,000
should have died that day, but didn't,

471
0:20:11.26,000 --> 0:20:14,000
and that's Beck Weathers.

472
0:20:14.26,000 --> 0:20:16,000
He was able to survive

473
0:20:16.26,000 --> 0:20:19,000
because he was able to generate that incredible willpower,

474
0:20:19.26,000 --> 0:20:22,000
he was able to use all the power of his mind

475
0:20:22.26,000 --> 0:20:25,000
to save himself.

476
0:20:25.26,000 --> 0:20:27,000
These are Tibetan prayer flags.

477
0:20:27.26,000 --> 0:20:29,000
These Sherpas believe that

478
0:20:29.26,000 --> 0:20:31,000
if you write prayers on these flags,

479
0:20:31.26,000 --> 0:20:34,000
the message will be carried up to the gods,

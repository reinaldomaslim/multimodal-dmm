1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Ten years ago, on a Tuesday morning,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I conducted a parachute jump at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It was a routine training jump, like many more I'd done

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
since I became a paratrooper

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
27 years before.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
We went down to the airfield early

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
because this is the Army and you always go early.

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
You do some routine refresher training,

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you.

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And you put on the T-10 parachute.

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And you're very careful how you put the straps,

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
particularly the leg straps because they go between your legs.

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And then you put on your reserve, and then you put on your heavy rucksack.

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And then a jumpmaster comes,

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and he's an experienced NCO in parachute operations.

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
He checks you out, he grabs your adjusting straps

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and he tightens everything

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
so that your chest is crushed,

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
your shoulders are crushed down,

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and, of course, he's tightened so your voice goes up a couple octaves as well.

21
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Then you sit down, and you wait a little while,

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
because this is the Army.

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Then you load the aircraft, and then you stand up and you get on,

24
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and you kind of lumber to the aircraft like this, in a line of people,

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and you sit down on canvas seats on either side of the aircraft.

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And you wait a little bit longer,

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
because this is the Air Force teaching the Army how to wait.

28
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Then you take off.

29
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And it's painful enough now --

30
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and I think it's designed this way --

31
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
it's painful enough so you want to jump.

32
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
You didn't really want to jump, but you want out.

33
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So you get in the aircraft, you're flying along,

34
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and at 20 minutes out, these jumpmasters start giving you commands.

35
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
They give 20 minutes -- that's a time warning.

36
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
You sit there, OK.

37
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Then they give you 10 minutes.

38
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And of course, you're responding with all of these.

39
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And that's to boost everybody's confidence, to show that you're not scared.

40
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Then they give you, "Get ready."

41
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Then they go, "Outboard personnel, stand up."

42
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
If you're an outboard personnel, now you stand up.

43
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
If you're an inboard personnel, stand up.

44
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And then you hook up, and you hook up your static line.

45
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And at that point, you think, "Hey, guess what?

46
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I'm probably going to jump.

47
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
There's no way to get out of this at this point."

48
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
You go through some additional checks, and then they open the door.

49
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And this was that Tuesday morning in September,

50
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and it was pretty nice outside.

51
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So nice air comes flowing in.

52
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
The jumpmasters start to check the door.

53
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And then when it's time to go,

54
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
a green light goes and the jumpmaster goes, "Go."

55
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The first guy goes, and you're just in line,

56
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and you just kind of lumber to the door.

57
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Jump is a misnomer; you fall.

58
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
You fall outside the door,

59
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
you're caught in the slipstream.

60
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
The first thing you do is lock into a tight body position --

61
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
head down in your chest, your arms extended,

62
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
put over your reserve parachute.

63
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
You do that because, 27 years before,

64
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
an airborne sergeant had taught me to do that.

65
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I have no idea whether it makes any difference,

66
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
but he seemed to make sense,

67
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and I wasn't going to test the hypothesis that he'd be wrong.

68
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And then you wait for the opening shock

69
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
for your parachute to open.

70
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
If you don't get an opening shock, you don't get a parachute --

71
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
you've got a whole new problem set.

72
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
But typically you do; typically it opens.

73
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And of course, if your leg straps aren't set right,

74
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
at that point you get another little thrill.

75
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Boom.

76
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So then you look around,

77
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
you're under a canopy and you say, "This is good."

78
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Now you prepare for the inevitable.

79
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
You are going to hit the ground.

80
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
You can't delay that much.

81
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And you really can't decide where you hit very much,

82
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
because they pretend you can steer,

83
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
but you're being delivered.

84
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So you look around, where you're going to land,

85
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
you try to make yourself ready.

86
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And then as you get close, you lower your rucksack below you on a lowering line,

87
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
so that it's not on you when you land,

88
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and you prepare to do a parachute-landing fall.

89
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Now the Army teaches you

90
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
to do five points of performance --

91
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
the toes of your feet,

92
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
your calves, your thighs,

93
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
your buttocks and your push-up muscles.

94
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
It's this elegant little land, twist and roll.

95
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And that's not going to hurt.

96
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
In 30-some years of jumping, I never did one.

97
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
(Laughter)

98
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I always landed like a watermelon out of a third floor window.

99
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
(Laughter)

100
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And as soon as I hit,

101
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
the first thing I did is I'd see if I'd broken anything that I needed.

102
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I'd shake my head,

103
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and I'd ask myself the eternal question:

104
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
"Why didn't I go into banking?"

105
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
(Laughter)

106
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And I'd look around,

107
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and then I'd see another paratrooper,

108
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
a young guy or girl,

109
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and they'd have pulled out their M4 carbine

110
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and they'd be picking up their equipment.

111
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
They'd be doing everything

112
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that we had taught them.

113
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And I realized

114
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that, if they had to go into combat,

115
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
they would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders.

116
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And I realized that, if they came out of combat,

117
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
it would be because we led them well.

118
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And I was hooked again on the importance of what I did.

119
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So now I do that Tuesday morning jump,

120
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
but it's not any jump --

121
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that was September 11th, 2001.

122
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And when we took off from the airfield, America was at peace.

123
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
When we landed on the drop-zone, everything had changed.

124
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And what we thought

125
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
about the possibility of those young soldiers going into combat

126
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
as being theoretical

127
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
was now very, very real --

128
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and leadership seemed important.

129
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But things had changed;

130
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I was a 46-year-old brigadier general.

131
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I'd been successful,

132
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
but things changed so much

133
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
that I was going to have to make some significant changes,

134
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and on that morning, I didn't know it.

135
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I was raised with traditional stories of leadership:

136
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Robert E. Lee, John Buford at Gettysburg.

137
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And I also was raised

138
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
with personal examples of leadership.

139
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
This was my father in Vietnam.

140
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And I was raised to believe

141
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
that soldiers were strong and wise

142
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and brave and faithful;

143
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
they didn't lie, cheat, steal

144
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
or abandon their comrades.

145
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And I still believe real leaders are like that.

146
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
But in my first 25 years of career,

147
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I had a bunch of different experiences.

148
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
One of my first battalion commanders,

149
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I worked in his battalion for 18 months

150
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and the only conversation he ever had with Lt. McChrystal

151
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
was at mile 18 of a 25-mile road march,

152
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and he chewed my ass for about 40 seconds.

153
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And I'm not sure that was real interaction.

154
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
But then a couple of years later, when I was a company commander,

155
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I went out to the National Training Center.

156
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And we did an operation,

157
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and my company did a dawn attack --

158
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
you know, the classic dawn attack:

159
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
you prepare all night, move to the line of departure.

160
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And I had an armored organization at that point.

161
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
We move forward, and we get wiped out --

162
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I mean, wiped out immediately.

163
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
The enemy didn't break a sweat doing it.

164
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And after the battle,

165
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
they bring this mobile theater and they do what they call an "after action review"

166
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
to teach you what you've done wrong.

167
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Sort of leadership by humiliation.

168
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
They put a big screen up, and they take you through everything:

169
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
"and then you didn't do this, and you didn't do this, etc."

170
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I walked out feeling as low

171
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
as a snake's belly in a wagon rut.

172
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And I saw my battalion commander, because I had let him down.

173
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And I went up to apologize to him,

174
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and he said, "Stanley, I thought you did great."

175
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And in one sentence,

176
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
he lifted me, put me back on my feet,

177
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and taught me that leaders can let you fail

178
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and yet not let you be a failure.

179
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
When 9/11 came,

180
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
46-year-old Brig. Gen. McChrystal sees a whole new world.

181
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
First, the things that are obvious, that you're familiar with:

182
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
the environment changed --

183
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
the speed, the scrutiny,

184
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
the sensitivity of everything now is so fast,

185
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
sometimes it evolves faster

186
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
than people have time to really reflect on it.

187
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
But everything we do

188
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
is in a different context.

189
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
More importantly, the force that I led

190
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
was spread over more than 20 countries.

191
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And instead of being able to get all the key leaders

192
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
for a decision together in a single room

193
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and look them in the eye and build their confidence

194
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and get trust from them,

195
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I'm now leading a force that's dispersed,

196
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and I've got to use other techniques.

197
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
I've got to use video teleconferences, I've got to use chat,

198
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I've got to use email, I've got to use phone calls --

199
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I've got to use everything I can,

200
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
not just for communication,

201
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
but for leadership.

202
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
A 22-year-old individual

203
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
operating alone,

204
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
thousands of miles from me,

205
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
has got to communicate to me with confidence.

206
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I have to have trust in them and vice versa.

207
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And I also have to build their faith.

208
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And that's a new kind of leadership

209
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
for me.

210
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
We had one operation

211
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
where we had to coordinate it from multiple locations.

212
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
An emerging opportunity came --

213
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
didn't have time to get everybody together.

214
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So we had to get complex intelligence together,

215
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
we had to line up the ability to act.

216
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
It was sensitive, we had to go up the chain of command,

217
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
convince them that this was the right thing to do

218
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and do all of this

219
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
on electronic medium.

220
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
We failed.

221
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
The mission didn't work.

222
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And so now what we had to do

223
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
is I had to reach out

224
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
to try to rebuild the trust of that force,

225
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
rebuild their confidence --

226
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
me and them, and them and me,

227
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and our seniors and us as a force --

228
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
all without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder.

229
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Entirely new requirement.

230
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Also, the people had changed.

231
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
You probably think that the force that I led

232
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
was all steely-eyed commandos with big knuckle fists

233
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
carrying exotic weapons.

234
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
In reality,

235
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
much of the force I led

236
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
looked exactly like you.

237
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
It was men, women, young, old --

238
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
not just from military; from different organizations,

239
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
many of them detailed to us just from a handshake.

240
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And so instead of giving orders,

241
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
you're now building consensus

242
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and you're building a sense of shared purpose.

243
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Probably the biggest change

244
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
was understanding that the generational difference,

245
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
the ages, had changed so much.

246
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
I went down to be with a Ranger platoon

247
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
on an operation in Afghanistan,

248
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and on that operation,

249
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
a sergeant in the platoon

250
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
had lost about half his arm

251
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
throwing a Taliban hand grenade

252
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
back at the enemy

253
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
after it had landed in his fire team.

254
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
We talked about the operation,

255
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and then at the end I did what I often do with a force like that.

256
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I asked, "Where were you on 9/11?"

257
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And one young Ranger in the back --

258
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
his hair's tousled and his face is red and windblown

259
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
from being in combat in the cold Afghan wind --

260
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
he said, "Sir, I was in the sixth grade."

261
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
And it reminded me

262
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
that we're operating a force

263
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
that must have shared purpose

264
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and shared consciousness,

265
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and yet he has different experiences,

266
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
in many cases a different vocabulary,

267
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
a completely different skill set

268
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
in terms of digital media

269
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
than I do and many of the other senior leaders.

270
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And yet, we need to have that shared sense.

271
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
It also produced something

272
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
which I call an inversion of expertise,

273
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
because we had so many changes at the lower levels

274
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
in technology and tactics and whatnot,

275
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
that suddenly the things that we grew up doing

276
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
wasn't what the force was doing anymore.

277
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
So how does a leader

278
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
stay credible and legitimate

279
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
when they haven't done

280
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
what the people you're leading are doing?

281
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And it's a brand new leadership challenge.

282
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And it forced me to become a lot more transparent,

283
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
a lot more willing to listen,

284
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
a lot more willing to be reverse-mentored from lower.

285
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And yet, again, you're not all in one room.

286
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Then another thing.

287
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
There's an effect on you and on your leaders.

288
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
There's an impact, it's cumulative.

289
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
You don't reset, or recharge your battery every time.

290
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
I stood in front of a screen one night in Iraq

291
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
with one of my senior officers

292
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and we watched a firefight from one of our forces.

293
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And I remembered his son was in our force.

294
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And I said, "John, where's your son? And how is he?"

295
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And he said, "Sir, he's fine. Thanks for asking."

296
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
I said, "Where is he now?"

297
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And he pointed at the screen, he said, "He's in that firefight."

298
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Think about watching your brother, father,

299
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
daughter, son, wife

300
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
in a firefight in real time

301
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and you can't do anything about it.

302
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Think about knowing that over time.

303
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
And it's a new cumulative pressure on leaders.

304
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And you have to watch and take care of each other.

305
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
I probably learned the most about relationships.

306
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
I learned they are the sinew

307
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
which hold the force together.

308
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
I grew up much of my career in the Ranger regiment.

309
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And every morning in the Ranger regiment,

310
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
every Ranger -- and there are more than 2,000 of them --

311
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
says a six-stanza Ranger creed.

312
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
You may know one line of it, it says,

313
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
"I'll never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy."

314
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And it's not a mindless mantra,

315
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and it's not a poem.

316
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
It's a promise.

317
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Every Ranger promises every other Ranger,

318
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
"No matter what happens, no matter what it costs me,

319
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
if you need me, I'm coming."

320
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And every Ranger gets that same promise

321
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
from every other Ranger.

322
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Think about it. It's extraordinarily powerful.

323
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
It's probably more powerful than marriage vows.

324
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And they've lived up to it, which gives it special power.

325
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And so the organizational relationship that bonds them

326
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
is just amazing.

327
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
And I learned personal relationships

328
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
were more important than ever.

329
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
We were in a difficult operation in Afghanistan in 2007,

330
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and an old friend of mine,

331
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
that I had spent many years

332
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
at various points of my career with --

333
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
godfather to one of their kids --

334
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
he sent me a note, just in an envelope,

335
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
that had a quote from Sherman to Grant

336
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
that said, "I knew if I ever got in a tight spot,

337
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
that you would come, if alive."

338
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
And having that kind of relationship, for me,

339
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
turned out to be critical at many points in my career.

340
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And I learned that you have to give that

341
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
in this environment,

342
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
because it's tough.

343
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
That was my journey.

344
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
I hope it's not over.

345
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
I came to believe

346
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
that a leader isn't good because they're right;

347
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
they're good because they're willing to learn and to trust.

348
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
This isn't easy stuff.

349
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
It's not like that electronic abs machine

350
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
where, 15 minutes a month, you get washboard abs.

351
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
(Laughter)

352
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And it isn't always fair.

353
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
You can get knocked down,

354
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and it hurts

355
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and it leaves scars.

356
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
But if you're a leader,

357
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
the people you've counted on

358
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
will help you up.

359
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
And if you're a leader,

360
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
the people who count on you need you on your feet.

361
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
Thank you.

362
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Who are we?

2
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
That is the big question.

3
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And essentially we are just an upright-walking, big-brained,

4
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
super-intelligent ape.

5
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
This could be us.

6
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
We belong to the family called the Hominidae.

7
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
We are the species called Homo sapiens sapiens,

8
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and it's important to remember that,

9
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
in terms of our place in the world today

10
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and our future on planet Earth.

11
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
We are one species

12
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
of about five and a half thousand mammalian species

13
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
that exist on planet Earth today.

14
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
And that's just a tiny fraction of all species

15
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that have ever lived on the planet in past times.

16
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
We're one species out of approximately,

17
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
or let's say, at least 16 upright-walking apes

18
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that have existed over the past six to eight million years.

19
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
But as far as we know, we're the only upright-walking ape

20
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
that exists on planet Earth today, except for the bonobos.

21
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And it's important to remember that,

22
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
because the bonobos are so human,

23
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and they share 99 percent of their genes with us.

24
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes.

25
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
It's important to remember that we evolved.

26
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Now, I know that's a dirty word for some people,

27
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
but we evolved from common ancestors

28
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
with the gorillas, the chimpanzee and also the bonobos.

29
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
We have a common past, and we have a common future.

30
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And it is important to remember that all of these great apes

31
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
have come on as long and as interesting evolutionary journey

32
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
as we ourselves have today.

33
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity,

34
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and it's this journey that has been the focus

35
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
of the past three generations of my family,

36
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
as we've been in East Africa looking for the fossil remains

37
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
of our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past.

38
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And this is how we look for them.

39
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
A group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly

40
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
out across vast areas of Africa,

41
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
looking for small fragments of bone, fossil bone, that may be on the surface.

42
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And that's an example of what we may do as we walk across

43
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
the landscape in Northern Kenya, looking for fossils.

44
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I doubt many of you in the audience can see

45
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
the fossil that's in this picture,

46
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
but if you look very carefully, there is a jaw, a lower jaw,

47
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
of a 4.1-million-year-old upright-walking ape

48
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
as it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side.

49
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Laughter)

50
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
It's extremely time-consuming, labor-intensive

51
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and it is something that is going to involve a lot more people,

52
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
to begin to piece together our past.

53
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We still really haven't got a very complete picture of it.

54
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
When we find a fossil, we mark it.

55
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Today, we've got great technology: we have GPS.

56
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
We mark it with a GPS fix,

57
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen,

58
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
so we could essentially put it back on the surface,

59
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
exactly where we found it.

60
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And we can bring all this information into big GIS packages, today.

61
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
When we then find something very important,

62
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
like the bones of a human ancestor,

63
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly,

64
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
using dental picks and fine paintbrushes.

65
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And all the sediment is then put through these screens,

66
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and where we go again through it very carefully,

67
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
looking for small bone fragments, and it's then washed.

68
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And these things are so exciting. They are so often the only,

69
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
or the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains.

70
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And here's a very special moment, when my mother and myself

71
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
were digging up some remains of human ancestors.

72
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And it is one of the most special things

73
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to ever do with your mother.

74
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
(Laughter)

75
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Not many people can say that.

76
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
But now, let me take you back to Africa, two million years ago.

77
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I'd just like to point out, if you look at the map of Africa,

78
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
it does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape.

79
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Now we're going to go to the East African and the Rift Valley.

80
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
It essentially runs up from the Gulf of Aden,

81
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
or runs down to Lake Malawi.

82
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And the Rift Valley is a depression.

83
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
It's a basin, and rivers flow down from the highlands into the basin,

84
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
carrying sediment, preserving the bones of animals that lived there.

85
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
If you want to become a fossil, you actually need to die somewhere

86
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
where your bones will be rapidly buried.

87
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
You then hope that the earth moves in such a way

88
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
as to bring the bones back up to the surface.

89
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And then you hope that one of us lot

90
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
will walk around and find small pieces of you.

91
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
(Laughter)

92
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
OK, so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much

93
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
as we do know today about our ancestors,

94
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
because it's incredibly difficult,

95
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
A, for these things to become -- to be -- preserved,

96
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and secondly, for them to have been brought back up to the surface.

97
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And we really have only spent 50 years looking for these remains,

98
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story.

99
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So, let's go to Lake Turkana, which is one such lake basin

100
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
in the very north of our country, Kenya.

101
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And if you look north here, there's a big river that flows into the lake

102
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
that's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains

103
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
of the animals that lived there.

104
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Fossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin,

105
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
which represents some 20,000 square miles.

106
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
That's a huge job that we've got on our hands.

107
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Two million years ago at Lake Turkana,

108
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Homo erectus, one of our human ancestors,

109
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
actually lived in this region.

110
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
You can see some of the major fossil sites that we've been working

111
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
in the north. But, essentially, two million years ago,

112
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Homo erectus, up in the far right corner,

113
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
lived alongside three other species of human ancestor.

114
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
And here is a skull of a Homo erectus,

115
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
which I just pulled off the shelf there.

116
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
(Laughter)

117
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
But it is not to say that being a single species on planet Earth is the norm.

118
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
In fact, if you go back in time,

119
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
it is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids

120
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
or of human ancestors that coexist at any one time.

121
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Where did these things come from?

122
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
That's what we're still trying to find answers to,

123
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and it is important to realize that there is diversity

124
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
in all different species, and our ancestors are no exception.

125
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Here's some reconstructions of some of the fossils

126
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
that have been found from Lake Turkana.

127
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
But I was very lucky to have been brought up in Kenya,

128
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
essentially accompanying my parents to Lake Turkana

129
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
in search of human remains.

130
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And we were able to dig up, when we got old enough,

131
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
fossils such as this, a slender-snouted crocodile.

132
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And we dug up giant tortoises, and elephants and things like that.

133
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
But when I was 12, as I was in this picture,

134
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
a very exciting expedition was in place on the west side,

135
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
when they found essentially the skeleton of this Homo erectus.

136
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I could relate to this Homo erectus skeleton very well,

137
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
because I was the same age that he was when he died.

138
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And I imagined him to be tall, dark-skinned.

139
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:39,000
His brothers certainly were able to run long distances

140
0:08:39.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
chasing prey, probably sweating heavily as they did so.

141
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
He was very able to use stones effectively as tools.

142
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And this individual himself, this one that I'm holding up here,

143
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
actually had a bad back. He'd probably had an injury as a child.

144
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
He had a scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after

145
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
quite carefully by other female, and probably much smaller,

146
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
members of his family group, to have got to where he did in life, age 12.

147
0:09:10.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Unfortunately for him, he fell into a swamp

148
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and couldn't get out.

149
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Essentially, his bones were rapidly buried

150
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and beautifully preserved.

151
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And he remained there until 1.6 million years later,

152
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
when this very famous fossil hunter, Kamoya Kimeu,

153
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:31,000
walked along a small hillside

154
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface

155
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
amongst the pebbles, recognized it as being hominid.

156
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
It's actually this little piece up here on the top.

157
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Well, an excavation was begun immediately,

158
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and more and more little bits of skull

159
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
started to be extracted from the sediment.

160
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And what was so fun about it was this:

161
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
the skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree,

162
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and fairly recently the tree had grown up,

163
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
but it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside,

164
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this,

165
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:17,000
holding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope.

166
0:10:17.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
We began to find limb bones; we found finger bones,

167
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
the bones of the pelvis, vertebrae, ribs, the collar bones,

168
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
things that had never, ever been seen before in Homo erectus.

169
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:32,000
It was truly exciting.

170
0:10:32.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
He had a body very similar to our own,

171
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and he was on the threshold of becoming human.

172
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Well, shortly afterwards, members of his species

173
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:48,000
started to move northwards out of Africa,

174
0:10:48.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and you start to see fossils of Homo erectus

175
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
in Georgia, China and also in parts of Indonesia.

176
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
So, Homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave Africa

177
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and begin its spread across the globe.

178
0:11:04.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Some exciting finds, again, as I mentioned,

179
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
from Dmanisi, in the Republic of Georgia.

180
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
But also, surprising finds

181
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
recently announced from the Island of Flores in Indonesia,

182
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated,

183
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and have become dwarfed, and they're only about a meter in height.

184
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:3,000
But they lived only 18,000 years ago,

185
0:11:30.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and that is truly extraordinary to think about.

186
0:11:33.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Just to put this in terms of generations,

187
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
because people do find it hard to think of time,

188
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Homo erectus left Africa 90,000 generations ago.

189
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
We evolved essentially from an African stock.

190
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Again, at about 200,000 years as a fully-fledged us.

191
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And we only left Africa about 70,000 years ago.

192
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
And until 30,000 years ago, at least three upright-walking apes

193
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
shared the planet Earth.

194
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
The question now is, well, who are we?

195
0:12:05.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
We're certainly a polluting, wasteful, aggressive species,

196
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
with a few nice things thrown in, perhaps.

197
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
(Laughter)

198
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
For the most part, we're not particularly pleasant at all.

199
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:23,000
We have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors.

200
0:12:23.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Is this a good evolutionary adaptation, or is it going to lead us

201
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
to being the shortest-lived hominid species on planet Earth?

202
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And what is it that really makes us us?

203
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
I think it's our collective intelligence.

204
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:42,000
It's our ability to write things down,

205
0:12:42.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
our language and our consciousness.

206
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:51,000
From very primitive beginnings, with a very crude tool kit of stones,

207
0:12:51.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
we now have a very advanced tool kit, and our tool use

208
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
has really reached unprecedented levels:

209
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
we've got buggies to Mars; we've mapped the human genome;

210
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and recently even created synthetic life, thanks to Craig Venter.

211
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And we've also managed to communicate with people

212
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
all over the world, from extraordinary places.

213
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Even from within an excavation in northern Kenya,

214
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
we can talk to people about what we're doing.

215
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:24,000
As Al Gore so clearly has reminded us,

216
0:13:24.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
we have reached extraordinary numbers

217
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:3,000
of people on this planet.

218
0:13:30.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Human ancestors really only survive on planet Earth,

219
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
if you look at the fossil record,

220
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
for about, on average, a million years at a time.

221
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:42,000
We've only been around for the past 200,000 years as a species,

222
0:13:42.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
yet we've reached a population of more than six and a half billion people.

223
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And last year, our population grew by 80 million.

224
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
I mean, these are extraordinary numbers.

225
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:58,000
You can see here, again, taken from Al Gore's book.

226
0:13:58.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
But what's happened is our technology

227
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
has removed the checks and balances on our population growth.

228
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
We have to control our numbers, and I think this is as important

229
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
as anything else that's being done in the world today.

230
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:13,000
But we have to control our numbers,

231
0:14:13.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
because we can't really hold it together as a species.

232
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
My father so appropriately put it,

233
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:25,000
that "We are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices

234
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
that are bad for our survival as a species."

235
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Can we hold it together?

236
0:14:33.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
It's important to remember that we all evolved in Africa.

237
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
We all have an African origin.

238
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
We have a common past and we share a common future.

239
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Evolutionarily speaking, we're just a blip.

240
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:52,000
We're sitting on the edge of a precipice,

241
0:14:52.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
and we have the tools and the technology at our hands

242
0:14:59.33,000 --> 0:15:01,000
to communicate what needs to be done

243
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:03,000
to hold it together today.

244
0:15:05.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
We could tell every single human being out there, if we really wanted to.

245
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
But will we do that, or will we just let nature take its course?

246
0:15:15.33,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Well, to end on a very positive note,

247
0:15:18.33,000 --> 0:15:2,000
I think evolutionarily speaking,

248
0:15:20.33,000 --> 0:15:23,000
this is probably a fairly good thing, in the end.

249
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:25,000
I'll leave it at that, thank you very much.

250
0:15:25.33,000 --> 0:15:3,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.68,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I must have been about 12 years old

2
0:00:15.12,000 --> 0:00:19,000
when my dad took me to an exhibition on space,

3
0:00:19.2,000 --> 0:00:2,000
not far from here, in Brussels.

4
0:00:21.84,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And the year was about -- I think it was 1988,

5
0:00:24.68,000 --> 0:00:25,000
so it was the end of the Cold War.

6
0:00:27.28,000 --> 0:00:3,000
There was a bit of an upmanship going on between the Americans and the Russians

7
0:00:31.04,000 --> 0:00:33,000
bringing bits to that exhibition.

8
0:00:34.24,000 --> 0:00:36,000
NASA brought a big blow-up space shuttle,

9
0:00:37.8,000 --> 0:00:41,000
but the Russians, they brought a Mir space station.

10
0:00:42.76,000 --> 0:00:44,000
It was actually the training module,

11
0:00:44.84,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and you could go inside and check it all out.

12
0:00:47.36,000 --> 0:00:48,000
It was the real thing --

13
0:00:48.96,000 --> 0:00:5,000
where the buttons were, where the wires were,

14
0:00:51.12,000 --> 0:00:54,000
where the astronauts were eating, where they were working.

15
0:00:54.24,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And when I came home,

16
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
the first thing I did, I started drawing spaceships.

17
0:01:00.32,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Now, these weren't science fiction spaceships, no.

18
0:01:04.4,000 --> 0:01:05,000
They were actually technical drawings.

19
0:01:06.32,000 --> 0:01:08,000
They were cutaway sections

20
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:11,000
of what kind of structure would be made out of,

21
0:01:11.96,000 --> 0:01:13,000
where the wires were, where the screws were.

22
0:01:15.6,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So fortunately, I didn't become a space engineer,

23
0:01:18.72,000 --> 0:01:2,000
but I did become an architect.

24
0:01:21.92,000 --> 0:01:23,000
These are some of the projects that I've been involved with

25
0:01:24.72,000 --> 0:01:26,000
over the last decade and a half.

26
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:3,000
All these projects are quite different, quite different shapes,

27
0:01:30.48,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and it is because they are built for different environments.

28
0:01:33.36,000 --> 0:01:34,000
They have different constraints.

29
0:01:36.04,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And I think design becomes really interesting

30
0:01:39.48,000 --> 0:01:42,000
when you get really harsh constraints.

31
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Now, these projects have been all over the world.

32
0:01:48.32,000 --> 0:01:51,000
A few years ago, this map wasn't good enough.

33
0:01:51.64,000 --> 0:01:52,000
It was too small.

34
0:01:53.08,000 --> 0:01:54,000
We had to add this one,

35
0:01:55.6,000 --> 0:01:58,000
because we were going to do a project on the Moon

36
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
for the European Space Agency;

37
0:02:00.92,000 --> 0:02:02,000
they asked us to design a Moon habitat --

38
0:02:03.44,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and one on Mars with NASA,

39
0:02:06.6,000 --> 0:02:1,000
a competition to look at a habitation on Mars.

40
0:02:12.28,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Whenever you go to another place,

41
0:02:15.96,000 --> 0:02:16,000
as an architect

42
0:02:17.44,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and try to design something,

43
0:02:20.36,000 --> 0:02:23,000
you look at the local architecture, the precedents that are there.

44
0:02:23.84,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Now, on the Moon, it's kind of difficult, of course,

45
0:02:26.32,000 --> 0:02:27,000
because there's only this.

46
0:02:27.6,000 --> 0:02:29,000
There's only the Apollo missions.

47
0:02:31.4,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So last that we went there, I wasn't even born yet,

48
0:02:34.56,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and we only spent about three days there.

49
0:02:38.68,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So for me, that's kind of a long camping trip, isn't it,

50
0:02:42.96,000 --> 0:02:43,000
but a rather expensive one.

51
0:02:46.48,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Now, the tricky thing,

52
0:02:48.8,000 --> 0:02:51,000
when you're going to build on another planet or a moon,

53
0:02:52.76,000 --> 0:02:55,000
is how to get it there, how to get it there.

54
0:02:56.32,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So first of all,

55
0:02:59.36,000 --> 0:03:02,000
to get a kilogram, for example, to the Moon's surface,

56
0:03:02.6,000 --> 0:03:04,000
it will cost about 200,000 dollars,

57
0:03:06.84,000 --> 0:03:07,000
very expensive.

58
0:03:08.24,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So you want to keep it very light.

59
0:03:11.44,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Second, space. Space is limited. Right?

60
0:03:14.44,000 --> 0:03:16,000
This is the Ariane 5 rocket.

61
0:03:16.48,000 --> 0:03:17,000
The space you have there

62
0:03:17.76,000 --> 0:03:21,000
is about four and a half meters by seven meters, not that much.

63
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So it needs to be an architectural system

64
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that is both compact, or compactable, and light,

65
0:03:30.44,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and I think I've got one right here.

66
0:03:34.32,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It's very compact,

67
0:03:36.48,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and it's very light.

68
0:03:39.08,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And actually,

69
0:03:40.76,000 --> 0:03:43,000
this is one I made earlier.

70
0:03:45.44,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Now, there's one problem with it,

71
0:03:48.96,000 --> 0:03:5,000
that inflatables

72
0:03:52.52,000 --> 0:03:53,000
are quite fragile.

73
0:03:55.36,000 --> 0:03:56,000
They need to be protected,

74
0:03:58.84,000 --> 0:04:02,000
specifically, when you go to a very harsh environment like the Moon.

75
0:04:05.6,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Look at it like this.

76
0:04:09.08,000 --> 0:04:11,000
The temperature difference on a Moon base

77
0:04:11.36,000 --> 0:04:13,000
could be anything up to 200 degrees.

78
0:04:13.44,000 --> 0:04:16,000
On one side of the base, it could be 100 degrees Celsius

79
0:04:17.36,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and on the other side, it could be minus 100 degrees.

80
0:04:20.4,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We need to protect ourselves from that.

81
0:04:23.72,000 --> 0:04:27,000
The Moon also does not have any magnetic fields,

82
0:04:29.12,000 --> 0:04:33,000
which means that any radiation -- solar radiation, cosmic radiation --

83
0:04:34.12,000 --> 0:04:35,000
will hit the surface.

84
0:04:36.32,000 --> 0:04:38,000
We need to protect ourselves from that as well,

85
0:04:38.56,000 --> 0:04:39,000
protect the astronauts from that.

86
0:04:41.04,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And then third,

87
0:04:42.64,000 --> 0:04:43,000
but definitely not last,

88
0:04:44.44,000 --> 0:04:46,000
the Moon does not have any atmosphere,

89
0:04:48.12,000 --> 0:04:52,000
which means any meteorites coming into it will not get burned up,

90
0:04:52.92,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and they'll hit the surface.

91
0:04:54.32,000 --> 0:04:56,000
That's why the Moon is full of craters.

92
0:04:57.56,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Again, we need to protect the astronauts from that.

93
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So what kind of structure do we need?

94
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Well, the best thing is really a cave,

95
0:05:07.84,000 --> 0:05:09,000
because a cave has a lot of mass, and we need mass.

96
0:05:10.28,000 --> 0:05:12,000
We need mass to protect ourselves from the temperatures,

97
0:05:13.28,000 --> 0:05:14,000
from the radiation

98
0:05:14.92,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and from the meteorites.

99
0:05:17.08,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So this is how we solved it.

100
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:23,000
We have indeed the blue part, as you can see.

101
0:05:23.04,000 --> 0:05:25,000
That's an inflatable for our Moon base.

102
0:05:25.8,000 --> 0:05:28,000
It gives a lot of living space and a lot of lab space,

103
0:05:29.96,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and attached to it you have a cylinder,

104
0:05:32.8,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and that has all the support structures in,

105
0:05:35.88,000 --> 0:05:38,000
all the life support and also the airlock.

106
0:05:40.08,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And on top of that, we have a structure, that domed structure,

107
0:05:44.4,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that protects ourselves,

108
0:05:45.8,000 --> 0:05:46,000
has a lot of mass in it.

109
0:05:48.44,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Where are we going to get this material from?

110
0:05:50.6,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Are we going to bring concrete and cement from Earth to the Moon?

111
0:05:53.72,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Well, of course not, because it's way too heavy.

112
0:05:56.28,000 --> 0:05:57,000
It's too expensive.

113
0:05:57.56,000 --> 0:06:,000
So we're going to go and use local materials.

114
0:06:01.44,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Now, local materials are something we deal with on Earth as well.

115
0:06:04.56,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Wherever we build or whatever country we build in,

116
0:06:06.96,000 --> 0:06:08,000
we always look at, what are the local materials here?

117
0:06:09.48,000 --> 0:06:11,000
The problem with the Moon is, what are the local materials?

118
0:06:12.36,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Well, there's not that many.

119
0:06:14.6,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Actually, we have one.

120
0:06:16.2,000 --> 0:06:17,000
It's moondust,

121
0:06:18.48,000 --> 0:06:23,000
or, fancier scientific name, regolith, Moon regolith.

122
0:06:25.08,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Great thing is, it's everywhere, right?

123
0:06:27.4,000 --> 0:06:29,000
The surface is covered with it.

124
0:06:29.44,000 --> 0:06:32,000
It's about 20 centimeters up to a few meters everywhere.

125
0:06:34.04,000 --> 0:06:36,000
But how are we going to build with it?

126
0:06:36.76,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Well, we're going to use a 3D printer.

127
0:06:40.56,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Whenever I ask any of you what a 3D printer is,

128
0:06:42.8,000 --> 0:06:45,000
you're probably all thinking, well, probably something about this size

129
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and it would print things that are about this size.

130
0:06:50.8,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So of course I'm not going to bring a massive 3D printer to the Moon

131
0:06:54.04,000 --> 0:06:55,000
to print my Moon base.

132
0:06:55.32,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I'm going to use a much smaller device, something like this one here.

133
0:07:00.64,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So this is a small device, a small robot rover,

134
0:07:03.88,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that has a little scoop,

135
0:07:06.08,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and it brings the regolith to the dome

136
0:07:09.84,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and then it lays down a thin layer of regolith,

137
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and then you would have the robot that will solidify it,

138
0:07:17.44,000 --> 0:07:19,000
layer by layer,

139
0:07:19.48,000 --> 0:07:21,000
until it creates, after a few months,

140
0:07:22.44,000 --> 0:07:23,000
the full base.

141
0:07:25.6,000 --> 0:07:26,000
You might have noticed

142
0:07:27.2,000 --> 0:07:31,000
that it's quite a particular structure that we're printing,

143
0:07:31.44,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and I've got a little example here.

144
0:07:35.28,000 --> 0:07:4,000
What we call this is a closed-cell foam structure.

145
0:07:40.64,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Looks quite natural.

146
0:07:42.84,000 --> 0:07:43,000
The reason why we're using this

147
0:07:44.52,000 --> 0:07:46,000
as part of that shell structure

148
0:07:46.6,000 --> 0:07:49,000
is that we only need to solidify certain parts,

149
0:07:51.12,000 --> 0:07:54,000
which means we have to bring less binder from Earth,

150
0:07:54.4,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and it becomes much lighter.

151
0:07:56.84,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Now --

152
0:07:59.64,000 --> 0:08:01,000
that approach of designing something

153
0:08:02.56,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and then covering it with a protective dome

154
0:08:05.52,000 --> 0:08:07,000
we also did for our Mars project.

155
0:08:08.76,000 --> 0:08:1,000
You can see it here, three domes.

156
0:08:10.8,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And you see the printers printing these dome structures.

157
0:08:15.2,000 --> 0:08:17,000
There's a big difference between Mars and the Moon,

158
0:08:17.64,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and let me explain it.

159
0:08:19.04,000 --> 0:08:22,000
This diagram shows you to scale

160
0:08:22.56,000 --> 0:08:25,000
the size of Earth and the Moon and the real distance,

161
0:08:26.28,000 --> 0:08:27,000
about 400,000 kilometers.

162
0:08:28.92,000 --> 0:08:29,000
If we then go to Mars,

163
0:08:31.72,000 --> 0:08:32,000
the distance from Mars to Earth --

164
0:08:33.4,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and this picture here

165
0:08:34.64,000 --> 0:08:39,000
is taken by the rover on Mars, Curiosity, looking back at Earth.

166
0:08:39.68,000 --> 0:08:43,000
You kind of see the little speckle there, that's Earth, 400 million kilometers away.

167
0:08:45.039,000 --> 0:08:46,000
The problem with that distance

168
0:08:46.52,000 --> 0:08:5,000
is that it's a thousand times the distance of the Earth to the Moon, pretty far away,

169
0:08:50.559,000 --> 0:08:56,000
but there's no direct radio contact with, for example, the Curiosity rover.

170
0:08:57.08,000 --> 0:09:,000
So I cannot teleoperate it from Earth.

171
0:09:00.96,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I can't say, "Oh, Mars rover, go left,"

172
0:09:05.2,000 --> 0:09:08,000
because that signal would take 20 minutes to get to Mars.

173
0:09:09.36,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Then the rover might go left,

174
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and then it will take another 20 minutes before it can tell me,

175
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:16,000
"Oh yeah, I went left."

176
0:09:16.96,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So the distance,

177
0:09:18.76,000 --> 0:09:21,000
so rovers and robots

178
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and going to have to work autonomously.

179
0:09:25.12,000 --> 0:09:26,000
The only issue with it

180
0:09:27.04,000 --> 0:09:31,000
is that missions to Mars are highly risky.

181
0:09:31.48,000 --> 0:09:34,000
We've only seen it a few weeks ago.

182
0:09:34.96,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So what if half the mission doesn't arrive at Mars.

183
0:09:38.44,000 --> 0:09:39,000
What do we do?

184
0:09:39.72,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Well, instead of building just one or two rovers

185
0:09:42.84,000 --> 0:09:43,000
like we did on the Moon,

186
0:09:44.24,000 --> 0:09:46,000
we're going to build hundreds of them.

187
0:09:46.88,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And it's a bit like a termite's mound, you know?

188
0:09:50.44,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Termites, I would take half of the colony of the termites away,

189
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:56,000
they would still be able to build the mound.

190
0:09:56.52,000 --> 0:09:58,000
It might take a little bit longer.

191
0:09:58.56,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Same here.

192
0:09:59.8,000 --> 0:10:02,000
If half of our rovers or robots don't arrive,

193
0:10:02.84,000 --> 0:10:05,000
well, it will take a bit longer, but you will still be able to do it.

194
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So here we even have three different rovers.

195
0:10:09.24,000 --> 0:10:1,000
In the back, you see the digger.

196
0:10:11.52,000 --> 0:10:13,000
It's really good at digging regolith.

197
0:10:14.96,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Then we have the transporter,

198
0:10:18.52,000 --> 0:10:21,000
great at taking regolith and bringing it to the structure.

199
0:10:22.36,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And the last ones, the little ones with the little legs,

200
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:26,000
they don't need to move a lot.

201
0:10:26.48,000 --> 0:10:28,000
What they do is they go and sit on a layer of regolith

202
0:10:29.44,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and then microwave it together,

203
0:10:31.4,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and layer by layer create that dome structure.

204
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Now --

205
0:10:39.44,000 --> 0:10:4,000
we also want to try that out,

206
0:10:40.88,000 --> 0:10:42,000
so we went out on a road trip,

207
0:10:43.24,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and we created our own swarm of robots.

208
0:10:49.64,000 --> 0:10:5,000
There you go.

209
0:10:50.92,000 --> 0:10:52,000
So we built 10 of those. It's a small swarm.

210
0:10:53.48,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And we took six tons of sand,

211
0:10:56.52,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and we tried out how these little robots

212
0:10:59.92,000 --> 0:11:01,000
would actually be able to move sand around,

213
0:11:02.28,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Earth sand in this case.

214
0:11:04.4,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And they were not teleoperated. Right?

215
0:11:07.68,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Nobody was telling them go left, go right, or giving them a predescribed path.

216
0:11:12.08,000 --> 0:11:14,000
No. They were given a task:

217
0:11:14.32,000 --> 0:11:17,000
move sand from this area to that area.

218
0:11:18.28,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And if they came across an obstacle, like a rock,

219
0:11:21.12,000 --> 0:11:23,000
they had to sort it out themselves.

220
0:11:23.52,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Or they came across another robot,

221
0:11:25.2,000 --> 0:11:27,000
they had to be able to make decisions.

222
0:11:28.08,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Or even if half of them fell out, their batteries died,

223
0:11:31.2,000 --> 0:11:34,000
they still had to be able to finish that task.

224
0:11:36.12,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Now, I've talked about redundancy.

225
0:11:40.96,000 --> 0:11:41,000
But that was not only with the robots.

226
0:11:42.84,000 --> 0:11:43,000
It was also with the habitats.

227
0:11:44.32,000 --> 0:11:47,000
On the Mars project, we decided to do three domes,

228
0:11:50.28,000 --> 0:11:52,000
because if one didn't arrive,

229
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
the other two could still form a base,

230
0:11:55.2,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and that was mainly because each of the domes

231
0:11:57.36,000 --> 0:12:,000
actually have a life support system built in the floor,

232
0:12:01.32,000 --> 0:12:03,000
so they can work independently.

233
0:12:04.04,000 --> 0:12:08,000
So in a way, you might think, well, this is pretty crazy.

234
0:12:09.72,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Why would you, as an architect, get involved in space?

235
0:12:14.24,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Because it's such a technical field.

236
0:12:18.4,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Well, I'm actually really convinced

237
0:12:21.48,000 --> 0:12:25,000
that from a creative view or a design view,

238
0:12:26.12,000 --> 0:12:32,000
you are able to solve really hard and really constrained problems.

239
0:12:32.2,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And I really feel that there is a place for design and architecture

240
0:12:36.04,000 --> 0:12:39,000
in projects like interplanetary habitation.

241
0:12:40.32,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Thank you.

242
0:12:41.56,000 --> 0:12:43,000
(Applause)

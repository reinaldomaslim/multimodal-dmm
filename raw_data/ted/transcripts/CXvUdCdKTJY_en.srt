1
0:00:12.786,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Every group of female friends has the funny one,

2
0:00:16.403,000 --> 0:00:18,000
the one you go to when you need a good cry,

3
0:00:19.166,000 --> 0:00:22,000
the one who tells you to suck it up when you've had a hard day.

4
0:00:22.841,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And this group was no different.

5
0:00:25.524,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Except that this was a community of groundbreaking women

6
0:00:29.203,000 --> 0:00:3,000
who came together --

7
0:00:30.48,000 --> 0:00:33,000
first to become teammates, then friends, and then family --

8
0:00:34.003,000 --> 0:00:36,000
in the least likely of places:

9
0:00:36.548,000 --> 0:00:38,000
on the Special Operations battlefield.

10
0:00:39.765,000 --> 0:00:42,000
This was a group of women whose friendship and valor was cemented

11
0:00:43.026,000 --> 0:00:47,000
not only by what they had seen and done at the tip of the spear,

12
0:00:47.508,000 --> 0:00:48,000
but by the fact that they were there

13
0:00:49.503,000 --> 0:00:51,000
at a time when women -- officially, at least --

14
0:00:52.045,000 --> 0:00:54,000
remained banned from ground combat,

15
0:00:54.604,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and America had no idea they existed.

16
0:00:59.546,000 --> 0:01:01,000
This story begins with Special Operations leaders,

17
0:01:02.432,000 --> 0:01:05,000
some of the most tested men in the United States military, saying,

18
0:01:06.033,000 --> 0:01:09,000
"We need women to help us wage this war."

19
0:01:10.358,000 --> 0:01:13,000
"America would never kill its way to the end of its wars," it argued.

20
0:01:13.771,000 --> 0:01:15,000
"Needed more knowledge and more understanding."

21
0:01:16.763,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And as everyone knows,

22
0:01:18.243,000 --> 0:01:21,000
if you want to understand what's happening in a community and in a home,

23
0:01:21.814,000 --> 0:01:22,000
you talk to women,

24
0:01:23.411,000 --> 0:01:25,000
whether you're talking about Southern Afghanistan,

25
0:01:26.125,000 --> 0:01:27,000
or Southern California.

26
0:01:28.558,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But in this case, men could not talk to women,

27
0:01:31.154,000 --> 0:01:34,000
because in a conservative and traditional society like Afghanistan,

28
0:01:34.577,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that would cause grave offense.

29
0:01:36.809,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So you needed women soldiers out there.

30
0:01:41.045,000 --> 0:01:44,000
That meant, at this time in the war, that the women who would be recruited

31
0:01:45.042,000 --> 0:01:47,000
to serve alongside Army Rangers and Navy SEALs,

32
0:01:47.929,000 --> 0:01:51,000
would be seeing the kind of combat experienced by less than five percent

33
0:01:52.413,000 --> 0:01:54,000
of the entire United States military.

34
0:01:55.579,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Less than five percent.

35
0:01:58.587,000 --> 0:01:59,000
So the call went out.

36
0:02:00.145,000 --> 0:02:02,000
"Female soldiers: Become a part of history.

37
0:02:02.58,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Join Special Operations on the battlefield in Afghanistan."

38
0:02:06.727,000 --> 0:02:07,000
This is in 2011.

39
0:02:08.525,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And from Alabama to Alaska,

40
0:02:10.738,000 --> 0:02:13,000
a group of women who had always wanted to do something that mattered

41
0:02:14.695,000 --> 0:02:15,000
alongside the best of the best,

42
0:02:16.697,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and to make a difference for their country,

43
0:02:18.974,000 --> 0:02:19,000
answered that call to serve.

44
0:02:22.294,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And for them it was not about politics, it was about serving with purpose.

45
0:02:28.858,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And so, the women who came to North Carolina

46
0:02:31.34,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to compete for a spot on these teams

47
0:02:34.067,000 --> 0:02:37,000
which would put women on the Special Operations front lines,

48
0:02:37.288,000 --> 0:02:4,000
landed and found very quickly a community,

49
0:02:40.659,000 --> 0:02:42,000
the likes of which they had never seen.

50
0:02:43.304,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Full of women who were as fierce and as fit as they were,

51
0:02:46.896,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and as driven to make a difference.

52
0:02:49.128,000 --> 0:02:51,000
They didn't have to apologize for who they were,

53
0:02:51.591,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and in fact, they could celebrate it.

54
0:02:54.589,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And what they found when they were there was that all of a sudden,

55
0:02:58.706,000 --> 0:03:,000
there were lots of people like them.

56
0:03:01.501,000 --> 0:03:02,000
As one of them said,

57
0:03:02.89,000 --> 0:03:04,000
"It was like you looked around and realized

58
0:03:04.96,000 --> 0:03:06,000
there was more than one giraffe at the zoo."

59
0:03:09.212,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Among this team of standouts was Cassie,

60
0:03:11.953,000 --> 0:03:15,000
a young woman who managed to be an ROTC cadet, a sorority sister

61
0:03:16.447,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and a Women's Studies minor, all in one person.

62
0:03:20.385,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Tristan, a West Point track star, who always ran and road marched

63
0:03:24.995,000 --> 0:03:25,000
with no socks,

64
0:03:26.256,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and had shoes whose smell proved it.

65
0:03:28.43,000 --> 0:03:29,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:29.897,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Amber, a Heidi look-alike, who had always wanted to be in the infantry,

67
0:03:33.895,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and when she found out that women couldn't be,

68
0:03:36.395,000 --> 0:03:38,000
she decided to become an intel officer.

69
0:03:39.626,000 --> 0:03:4,000
She served in Bosnia,

70
0:03:40.88,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and later helped the FBI to bust drug gangs in Pennsylvania.

71
0:03:44.979,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And then there was Kate, who played high school football

72
0:03:48.482,000 --> 0:03:49,000
all four years,

73
0:03:49.718,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and actually wanted to drop out after the first,

74
0:03:52.324,000 --> 0:03:53,000
to go into the glee club,

75
0:03:53.825,000 --> 0:03:55,000
but when boys told her that girls couldn't play football,

76
0:03:56.732,000 --> 0:03:57,000
she decided to stay

77
0:03:58.013,000 --> 0:04:,000
for all the little girls who would come after her.

78
0:04:02.268,000 --> 0:04:04,000
For them, biology had shaped part of their destiny,

79
0:04:04.973,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and put, as Cassie once said,

80
0:04:07.079,000 --> 0:04:09,000
"everything noble out of reach for girls."

81
0:04:10.353,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And yet, here was a chance to serve with the best of the best

82
0:04:13.673,000 --> 0:04:15,000
on a mission that mattered to their country,

83
0:04:15.757,000 --> 0:04:17,000
not despite the fact that they were female,

84
0:04:18.456,000 --> 0:04:19,000
but because of it.

85
0:04:20.769,000 --> 0:04:23,000
This team of women, in many ways, was like women everywhere.

86
0:04:24.76,000 --> 0:04:25,000
They wore makeup, and in fact,

87
0:04:26.355,000 --> 0:04:29,000
they would bond in the ladies' room over eyeliner and eye pencil.

88
0:04:30.531,000 --> 0:04:31,000
They also wore body armor.

89
0:04:32.543,000 --> 0:04:34,000
They would put 50 pounds of weight on their backs,

90
0:04:34.955,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and board the helicopter for an operation,

91
0:04:37.005,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and they would come back and watch a movie called "Bridesmaids."

92
0:04:40.061,000 --> 0:04:41,000
(Laughter)

93
0:04:41.936,000 --> 0:04:43,000
They even wore a thing called Spanx,

94
0:04:44.669,000 --> 0:04:45,000
because, as they found very quickly,

95
0:04:46.633,000 --> 0:04:49,000
the uniforms made for men were big where they should be small,

96
0:04:50.549,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and small where they should be big.

97
0:04:52.623,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So Lane, an Iraq War veteran -- you see her here on my left --

98
0:04:56.184,000 --> 0:04:58,000
decided she was going to go on Amazon

99
0:04:58.264,000 --> 0:05:,000
and order a pair of Spanx to her base,

100
0:05:00.407,000 --> 0:05:03,000
so that her pants would fit better when she went out on mission each night.

101
0:05:04.822,000 --> 0:05:06,000
These women would get together over video conference

102
0:05:07.247,000 --> 0:05:09,000
from all around Afghanistan from their various bases,

103
0:05:09.728,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and they would talk about what it was like

104
0:05:11.76,000 --> 0:05:13,000
to be one of the only women doing what they were doing.

105
0:05:14.435,000 --> 0:05:15,000
They would swap jokes,

106
0:05:15.636,000 --> 0:05:17,000
they would talk about what was working, what wasn't,

107
0:05:18.112,000 --> 0:05:21,000
what they had learned to do well, what they needed to do better.

108
0:05:21.183,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And they would talk about some of the lighter moments of being women

109
0:05:24.63,000 --> 0:05:26,000
out on the Special Operations front lines,

110
0:05:27.146,000 --> 0:05:28,000
including the Shewee,

111
0:05:28.535,000 --> 0:05:3,000
which was a tool that let you pee like a guy,

112
0:05:30.874,000 --> 0:05:34,000
although it's said to have had only a 40 percent accuracy rate out there.

113
0:05:35.326,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Laughter)

114
0:05:38.441,000 --> 0:05:4,000
These women lived in the "and."

115
0:05:41.139,000 --> 0:05:44,000
They proved you could be fierce and you could be feminine.

116
0:05:44.325,000 --> 0:05:46,000
You could wear mascara and body armor.

117
0:05:47.221,000 --> 0:05:51,000
You could love CrossFit, and really like cross-stitch.

118
0:05:51.301,000 --> 0:05:55,000
You could love to climb out of helicopters and you could also love to bake cookies.

119
0:05:56.578,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Women live in the and every single day,

120
0:06:00.031,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and these women brought that to this mission as well.

121
0:06:04.547,000 --> 0:06:06,000
On this life and death battlefield they never forgot

122
0:06:07.466,000 --> 0:06:1,000
that being female may have brought them to the front lines,

123
0:06:10.581,000 --> 0:06:12,000
but being a soldier is what would prove themselves there.

124
0:06:14.272,000 --> 0:06:16,000
There was the night Amber went out on mission,

125
0:06:16.46,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and in talking to the women of the house,

126
0:06:18.454,000 --> 0:06:2,000
realized that there was a barricaded shooter lying in wait

127
0:06:21.303,000 --> 0:06:24,000
for the Afghan and American forces who were waiting to enter the home.

128
0:06:25.418,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Another night it was Tristan who found out

129
0:06:28.237,000 --> 0:06:3,000
that there were pieces that make up explosives

130
0:06:30.425,000 --> 0:06:32,000
all around the house in which they were standing,

131
0:06:32.746,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and that in fact, explosives lay all the way between there

132
0:06:35.549,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and where they were about to head that night.

133
0:06:38.061,000 --> 0:06:41,000
There was the night another one of their teammates proved herself

134
0:06:41.156,000 --> 0:06:43,000
to a decidedly skeptical team of SEALs,

135
0:06:43.647,000 --> 0:06:45,000
when she found the intel item they were looking for

136
0:06:46.067,000 --> 0:06:48,000
wrapped up in a baby's wet diaper.

137
0:06:49.309,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And there was the night that Isabel, another one of their teammates,

138
0:06:52.57,000 --> 0:06:54,000
found the things that they were looking for,

139
0:06:54.692,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and received an Impact Award from the Rangers

140
0:06:56.832,000 --> 0:06:57,000
who said that without her,

141
0:06:58.582,000 --> 0:07:,000
the things and the people they were looking for that night

142
0:07:01.36,000 --> 0:07:02,000
would never have been found.

143
0:07:03.553,000 --> 0:07:04,000
That night and so many others,

144
0:07:05.405,000 --> 0:07:08,000
they went out to prove themselves, not only for one another,

145
0:07:08.52,000 --> 0:07:1,000
but for everybody who would come after them.

146
0:07:11.519,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And also for the men alongside whom they served.

147
0:07:15.209,000 --> 0:07:19,000
We talk a lot about how behind every great man is a good woman.

148
0:07:20.354,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And in this case,

149
0:07:21.535,000 --> 0:07:24,000
next to these women stood men who wanted to see them succeed.

150
0:07:25.666,000 --> 0:07:28,000
The Army Ranger who trained them had served 12 deployments.

151
0:07:29.406,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And when they told him that he had to go train girls,

152
0:07:32.424,000 --> 0:07:34,000
he had no idea what to expect.

153
0:07:35.361,000 --> 0:07:39,000
But at the end of eight days with these women in the summer of 2011,

154
0:07:39.715,000 --> 0:07:43,000
he told his fellow Ranger, "We have just witnessed history.

155
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
These may well be our own Tuskegee Airmen."

156
0:07:49.666,000 --> 0:07:55,000
(Applause)

157
0:07:56.39,000 --> 0:07:58,000
At the heart of this team was the one person

158
0:07:59.04,000 --> 0:08:01,000
who everyone called "the best of us."

159
0:08:01.675,000 --> 0:08:03,000
She was a petite blonde dynamo,

160
0:08:04.164,000 --> 0:08:06,000
who barely reached five-foot-three.

161
0:08:06.772,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And she was this wild mix of Martha Stewart,

162
0:08:09.927,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and what we know as G.I. Jane.

163
0:08:12.665,000 --> 0:08:14,000
She was someone who loved to make dinner for her husband,

164
0:08:15.513,000 --> 0:08:19,000
her Kent State ROTC sweetheart who pushed her to be her best,

165
0:08:19.64,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and to trust herself,

166
0:08:20.993,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and to test every limit she could.

167
0:08:23.944,000 --> 0:08:27,000
She also loved to put 50 pounds of weight on her back and run for miles,

168
0:08:28.138,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and she loved to be a soldier.

169
0:08:31.08,000 --> 0:08:34,000
She was somebody who had a bread maker in her office in Kandahar,

170
0:08:34.338,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and would bake a batch of raisin bread, and then go to the gym

171
0:08:37.294,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and bust out 25 or 30 pull-ups from a dead hang.

172
0:08:41.092,000 --> 0:08:43,000
She was the person who, if you needed an extra pair of boots

173
0:08:44.017,000 --> 0:08:46,000
or a home-cooked dinner, would be on your speed dial.

174
0:08:47.404,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Because she never, ever would talk to you

175
0:08:49.666,000 --> 0:08:5,000
about how good she was,

176
0:08:50.841,000 --> 0:08:52,000
but let her character speak through action.

177
0:08:54.45,000 --> 0:08:59,000
She was famous for taking the hard right over the easy wrong.

178
0:09:00.487,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And she was also famous for walking up to a 15-foot rope,

179
0:09:03.901,000 --> 0:09:05,000
climbing it using only her arms,

180
0:09:06.085,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and then shuffling away and apologizing,

181
0:09:08.11,000 --> 0:09:11,000
because she knew she was supposed to use both her arms and her legs,

182
0:09:11.524,000 --> 0:09:12,000
as the Rangers had trained them.

183
0:09:13.245,000 --> 0:09:14,000
(Laughter)

184
0:09:15.145,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Some of our heroes return home to tell their stories.

185
0:09:19.346,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And some of them don't.

186
0:09:21.958,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And on October 22, 2011,

187
0:09:24.527,000 --> 0:09:27,000
First Lieutenant Ashley White was killed alongside two Rangers,

188
0:09:28.119,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Christopher Horns

189
0:09:29.498,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and Kristoffer Domeij.

190
0:09:31.998,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Her death threw this program built for the shadows

191
0:09:35.271,000 --> 0:09:37,000
into a very public spotlight.

192
0:09:37.322,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Because after all,

193
0:09:38.499,000 --> 0:09:41,000
the ban on women in combat was still very much in place.

194
0:09:42.856,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And at her funeral,

195
0:09:44.294,000 --> 0:09:48,000
the head of Army Special Operations came, and gave a public testimony

196
0:09:48.722,000 --> 0:09:5,000
not just to the courage of Ashley White,

197
0:09:50.961,000 --> 0:09:52,000
but to all her team of sisters.

198
0:09:53.746,000 --> 0:09:57,000
"Make no mistake about it," he said, "these women are warriors,

199
0:09:58.198,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and they have written a new chapter in what it means to be a female

200
0:10:01.538,000 --> 0:10:02,000
in the United States Army."

201
0:10:04.989,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Ashley's mom is a teacher's aide and a school bus driver,

202
0:10:08.691,000 --> 0:10:09,000
who bakes cookies on the side.

203
0:10:11.34,000 --> 0:10:14,000
She doesn't remember much about that overwhelming set of days,

204
0:10:14.546,000 --> 0:10:16,000
in which grief -- enormous grief --

205
0:10:17.339,000 --> 0:10:18,000
mixed with pride.

206
0:10:19.359,000 --> 0:10:21,000
But she does remember one moment.

207
0:10:21.913,000 --> 0:10:24,000
A stranger with a child in her hand came up to her

208
0:10:25.343,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and she said, "Mrs. White,

209
0:10:28.049,000 --> 0:10:3,000
I brought my daughter here today,

210
0:10:30.371,000 --> 0:10:32,000
because I wanted her to know what a hero was.

211
0:10:34.49,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And I wanted her to know that heroes could be women, too."

212
0:10:39.749,000 --> 0:10:42,000
It is time to celebrate all the unsung heroines

213
0:10:43.387,000 --> 0:10:44,000
who reach into their guts

214
0:10:45.136,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and find the heart and the grit to keep going and to test every limit.

215
0:10:50.1,000 --> 0:10:55,000
This very unlikely band of sisters bound forever in life and afterward

216
0:10:55.844,000 --> 0:10:57,000
did indeed become part of history,

217
0:10:58.19,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and they paved the way for so many who would come after them,

218
0:11:01.345,000 --> 0:11:05,000
as much as they stood on the shoulders of those who had come before.

219
0:11:06.303,000 --> 0:11:1,000
These women showed that warriors come in all shapes and sizes.

220
0:11:11.454,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And women can be heroes, too.

221
0:11:14.648,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Thank you so much.

222
0:11:15.824,000 --> 0:11:21,000
(Applause)

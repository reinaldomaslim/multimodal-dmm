1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Today I want to talk about design,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
but not design as we usually think about it.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I want to talk about what is happening now

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
in our scientific, biotechnological culture,

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
where, for really the first time in history,

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
we have the power to design bodies,

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
to design animal bodies,

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
to design human bodies.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
In the history of our planet,

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
there have been three great waves of evolution.

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
The first wave of evolution

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
is what we think of as Darwinian evolution.

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
So, as you all know,

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
species lived in particular ecological niches

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and particular environments,

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and the pressures of those environments

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
selected which changes,

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
through random mutation in species,

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
were going to be preserved.

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Then human beings stepped out

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
of the Darwinian flow of evolutionary history

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and created the second great wave of evolution,

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
which was we changed the environment

24
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
in which we evolved.

25
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
We altered our ecological niche

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
by creating civilization.

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And that has been the second great --

28
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
couple 100,000 years, 150,000 years --

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
flow of our evolution.

30
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
By changing our environment,

31
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
we put new pressures

32
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
on our bodies to evolve.

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Whether it was through settling down in agricultural communities,

34
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
all the way through modern medicine,

35
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
we have changed our own evolution.

36
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Now we're entering a third great wave

37
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
of evolutionary history,

38
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
which has been called many things:

39
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
"intentional evolution,"

40
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
"evolution by design" --

41
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
very different than intelligent design --

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
whereby we are actually now

43
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
intentionally designing and altering

44
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
the physiological forms that inhabit our planet.

45
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So I want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that

46
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and then at the end talk a little bit

47
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
about what some of the implications are for us

48
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and for our species, as well as our cultures,

49
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
because of this change.

50
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Now we actually have been doing it for a long time.

51
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
We started selectively breeding animals

52
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
many, many thousands of years ago.

53
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And if you think of dogs for example,

54
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
dogs are now intentionally-designed creatures.

55
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
There isn't a dog on this earth that's a natural creature.

56
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Dogs are the result

57
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
of selectively breeding traits that we like.

58
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
But we had to do it the hard way in the old days

59
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
by choosing offspring that looked a particular way

60
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and then breeding them.

61
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
We don't have to do it that way anymore.

62
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
This is a beefalo.

63
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
A beefalo is a buffalo-cattle hybrid.

64
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And they are now making them,

65
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and someday, perhaps pretty soon,

66
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
you will have beefalo patties

67
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
in your local supermarket.

68
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
This is a geep,

69
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
a goat-sheep hybrid.

70
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
The scientists that made this cute little creature

71
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
ended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards.

72
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I think they said it tasted like chicken.

73
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
This is a cama.

74
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
A cama is a camel-llama hybrid,

75
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
created to try to get the hardiness of a camel

76
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
with some of the personality traits

77
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
of a llama.

78
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And they are now using these in certain cultures.

79
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Then there's the liger.

80
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
This is the largest cat in the world --

81
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
the lion-tiger hybrid.

82
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It's bigger than a tiger.

83
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And in the case of the liger,

84
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
there actually have been one or two that have been seen in the wild.

85
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
But these were created by scientists

86
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
using both selective breeding and genetic technology.

87
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And then finally, everybody's favorite,

88
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
the zorse.

89
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
None of this is Photoshopped. These are real creatures.

90
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And so one of the things we've been doing

91
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
is using genetic enhancement,

92
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
or genetic manipulation,

93
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
of normal selective breeding

94
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
pushed a little bit through genetics.

95
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And if that were all this was about,

96
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
then it would be an interesting thing.

97
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
But something much, much more powerful

98
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
is happening now.

99
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
These are normal mammalian cells

100
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
genetically engineered with a bioluminescent gene

101
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
taken out of deep-sea jellyfish.

102
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
We all know that some deep-sea creatures glow.

103
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Well, they've now taken that gene, that bioluminescent gene,

104
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and put it into mammal cells.

105
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
These are normal cells.

106
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And what you see here

107
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
is these cells glowing in the dark

108
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
under certain wavelengths of light.

109
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
Once they could do that with cells, they could do it with organisms.

110
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So they did it with mouse pups,

111
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
kittens.

112
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And by the way, the reason the kittens here are orange and these are green

113
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
is because that's a bioluminescent gene from coral,

114
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
while this is from jellyfish.

115
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
They did it with pigs.

116
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
They did it with puppies.

117
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And, in fact,

118
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
they did it with monkeys.

119
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And if you can do it with monkeys --

120
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
though the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate

121
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
is actually between monkeys and apes --

122
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
if they can do it in monkeys,

123
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
they can probably figure out how to do it in apes,

124
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
which means they can do it in human beings.

125
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
In other words, it is theoretically possible

126
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that before too long we will be biotechnologically capable

127
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
of creating human beings

128
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that glow in the dark.

129
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Be easier to find us at night.

130
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And in fact, right now in many states,

131
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
you can go out and you can buy bioluminescent pets.

132
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
These are zebra fish. They're normally black and silver.

133
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
These are zebra fish that have been genetically engineered

134
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
to be yellow, green, red,

135
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and they are actually available now in certain states.

136
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Other states have banned them.

137
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures.

138
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
There is no area of the government -- not the EPA or the FDA --

139
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
that controls genetically-engineered pets.

140
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And so some states have decided to allow them,

141
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
some states have decided to ban them.

142
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Some of you may have read

143
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
about the FDA's consideration right now

144
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
of genetically-engineered salmon.

145
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
The salmon on top

146
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
is a genetically engineered Chinook salmon,

147
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
using a gene from these salmon

148
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and from one other fish that we eat,

149
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
to make it grow much faster

150
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
using a lot less feed.

151
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And right now the FDA is trying to make a final decision

152
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
on whether, pretty soon, you could be eating this fish --

153
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
it'll be sold in the stores.

154
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And before you get too worried about it,

155
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
here in the United States,

156
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
the majority of food you buy in the supermarket

157
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
already has genetically-modified components to it.

158
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So even as we worry about it,

159
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
we have allowed it to go on in this country -- much different in Europe --

160
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
without any regulation,

161
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and even without any identification on the package.

162
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
These are all the first cloned animals

163
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
of their type.

164
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So in the lower right here,

165
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
you have Dolly, the first cloned sheep --

166
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
now happily stuffed in a museum in Edinburgh;

167
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Ralph the rat, the first cloned rat;

168
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
CC the cat, for cloned cat;

169
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Snuppy, the first cloned dog --

170
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Snuppy for Seoul National University puppy --

171
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
created in South Korea

172
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
by the very same man that some of you may remember

173
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
had to end up resigning in disgrace

174
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
because he claimed he had cloned a human embryo, which he had not.

175
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
He actually was the first person

176
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
to clone a dog, which is a very difficult thing to do,

177
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
because dog genomes are very plastic.

178
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
This is Prometea, the first cloned horse.

179
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
It's a Haflinger horse cloned in Italy,

180
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
a real "gold ring" of cloning,

181
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
because there are many horses that win important races

182
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
who are geldings.

183
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
In other words, the equipment to put them out to stud

184
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
has been removed.

185
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
But if you can clone that horse,

186
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
you can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race

187
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and his identical genetic duplicate

188
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
can then be put out to stud.

189
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
These were the first cloned calves,

190
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
the first cloned grey wolves,

191
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and then, finally,

192
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
the first cloned piglets:

193
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Alexis, Chista, Carrel, Janie and Dotcom.

194
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
(Laughter)

195
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
In addition, we've started to use cloning technology

196
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
to try to save endangered species.

197
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
This is the use of animals now

198
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to create drugs and other things in their bodies

199
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
that we want to create.

200
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
So with antithrombin in that goat --

201
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that goat has been genetically modified

202
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
so that the molecules of its milk

203
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
actually include the molecule of antithrombin

204
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
that GTC Genetics wants to create.

205
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And then in addition, transgenic pigs, knockout pigs,

206
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
from the National Institute of Animal Science in South Korea,

207
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
are pigs that they are going to use, in fact,

208
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
to try to create all kinds of drugs

209
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and other industrial types of chemicals

210
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
that they want the blood and the milk

211
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
of these animals

212
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
to produce for them,

213
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
instead of producing them in an industrial way.

214
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
These are two creatures

215
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
that were created

216
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
in order to save endangered species.

217
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
The guar

218
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
is an endangered Southeast Asian ungulate.

219
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
A somatic cell, a body cell,

220
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
was taken from its body,

221
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
gestated in the ovum of a cow,

222
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and then that cow gave birth to a guar.

223
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Same thing happened with the mouflon,

224
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
where it's an endangered species of sheep.

225
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
It was gestated in a regular sheep body,

226
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
which actually raises an interesting biological problem.

227
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
We have two kinds of DNA in our bodies.

228
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
We have our nucleic DNA

229
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
that everybody thinks of as our DNA,

230
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
but we also have DNA in our mitochondria,

231
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
which are the energy packets of the cell.

232
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
That DNA is passed down through our mothers.

233
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
So really, what you end up having here

234
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
is not a guar and not a mouflon,

235
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
but a guar

236
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
with cow mitochondria,

237
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and therefore cow mitochondrial DNA,

238
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and a mouflon with another species of sheep's

239
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
mitochondrial DNA.

240
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
These are really hybrids, not pure animals.

241
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And it raises the question of how we're going to define animal species

242
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
in the age of biotechnology --

243
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
a question that we're not really sure yet

244
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
how to solve.

245
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
This lovely creature

246
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
is an Asian cockroach.

247
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And what they've done here

248
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
is they've put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain

249
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and then a transmitter on top,

250
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and it's on a big computer tracking ball.

251
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And now, using a joystick,

252
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
they can send this creature

253
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
around the lab

254
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and control whether it goes left or right,

255
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
forwards or backwards.

256
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
They've created a kind of insect bot,

257
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
or bugbot.

258
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
It gets worse than that -- or perhaps better than that.

259
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
This actually is one of DARPA's very important --

260
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
DARPA is the Defense Research Agency --

261
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
one of their projects.

262
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
These goliath beetles

263
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
are wired in their wings.

264
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
They have a computer chip strapped to their backs,

265
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and they can fly these creatures around the lab.

266
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
They can make them go left, right. They can make them take off.

267
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
They can't actually make them land.

268
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
They put them about one inch above the ground,

269
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and then they shut everything off and they go pfft.

270
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
But it's the closest they can get to a landing.

271
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And in fact, this technology has gotten so developed

272
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
that this creature --

273
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
this is a moth --

274
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
this is the moth in its pupa stage,

275
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and that's when they put the wires in

276
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and they put in the computer technology,

277
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
so that when the moth actually emerges as a moth,

278
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
it is already prewired.

279
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
The wires are already in its body,

280
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and they can just hook it up to their technology,

281
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and now they've got these bugbots

282
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
that they can send out for surveillance.

283
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
They can put little cameras on them

284
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and perhaps someday deliver

285
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
other kinds of ordinance

286
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
to warzones.

287
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
It's not just insects.

288
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
This is the ratbot, or the robo-rat

289
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
by Sanjiv Talwar at SUNY Downstate.

290
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Again, it's got technology --

291
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
it's got electrodes going into its left and right hemispheres;

292
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
it's got a camera on top of its head.

293
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
The scientists can make this creature

294
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
go left, right.

295
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
They have it running through mazes, controlling where it's going.

296
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
They've now created an organic robot.

297
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
The graduate students

298
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
in Sanjiv Talwar's lab

299
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
said, "Is this ethical?

300
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
We've taken away the autonomy of this animal."

301
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
I'll get back to that in a minute.

302
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
There's also been work done with monkeys.

303
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
This is Miguel Nicolelis of Duke.

304
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
He took owl monkeys,

305
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
wired them up

306
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
so that a computer watched their brains while they moved,

307
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
especially looking at the movement of their right arm.

308
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
The computer learned what the monkey brain did

309
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
to move its arm in various ways.

310
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
They then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm,

311
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
which you see here in the picture,

312
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
put the arm in another room.

313
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Pretty soon, the computer learned, by reading the monkey's brainwaves,

314
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
to make that arm in the other room

315
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
do whatever the monkey's arm did.

316
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Then he put a video monitor

317
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
in the monkey's cage

318
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
that showed the monkey this prosthetic arm,

319
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and the monkey got fascinated.

320
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
The monkey recognized that whatever she did with her arm,

321
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
this prosthetic arm would do.

322
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And eventually she was moving it and moving it,

323
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and eventually stopped moving her right arm

324
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and, staring at the screen,

325
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
could move the prosthetic arm in the other room

326
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
only with her brainwaves --

327
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
which means that monkey

328
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
became the first primate in the history of the world

329
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
to have three independent functional arms.

330
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And it's not just technology

331
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
that we're putting into animals.

332
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
This is Thomas DeMarse at the University of Florida.

333
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
He took 20,000 and then 60,000

334
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
disaggregated rat neurons --

335
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
so these are just individual neurons from rats --

336
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
put them on a chip.

337
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
They self-aggregated into a network,

338
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
became an integrated chip.

339
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
And he used that

340
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
as the IT piece

341
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator.

342
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
So now we have organic computer chips

343
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
made out of living, self-aggregating neurons.

344
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Finally, Mussa-Ivaldi of Northwestern

345
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
took a completely intact,

346
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
independent lamprey eel brain.

347
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
This is a brain from a lamprey eel.

348
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
It is living --

349
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
fully-intact brain in a nutrient medium

350
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
with these electrodes going off to the sides,

351
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
attached photosensitive sensors to the brain,

352
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
put it into a cart --

353
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
here's the cart, the brain is sitting there in the middle --

354
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
and using this brain as the sole processor for this cart,

355
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
when you turn on a light and shine it at the cart,

356
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
the cart moves toward the light;

357
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
when you turn it off, it moves away.

358
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
It's photophilic.

359
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
So now we have a complete

360
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
living lamprey eel brain.

361
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
Is it thinking lamprey eel thoughts,

362
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
sitting there in its nutrient medium?

363
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
I don't know,

364
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
but in fact it is a fully living brain

365
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
that we have managed to keep alive

366
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
to do our bidding.

367
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
So, we are now at the stage

368
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
where we are creating creatures

369
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
for our own purposes.

370
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
This is a mouse created by Charles Vacanti

371
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
of the University of Massachusetts.

372
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
He altered this mouse

373
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
so that it was genetically engineered

374
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin,

375
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it

376
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse

377
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
and transplanted onto a human being.

378
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
Genetic engineering

379
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
coupled with polymer physiotechnology

380
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
coupled with xenotransplantation.

381
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
This is where we are in this process.

382
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
Finally, not that long ago,

383
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Craig Venter created the first artificial cell,

384
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
where he took a cell, took a DNA synthesizer,

385
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
which is a machine,

386
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
created an artificial genome,

387
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
put it in a different cell --

388
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
the genome was not of the cell he put it in --

389
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
and that cell then reproduced

390
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
as the other cell.

391
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
In other words,

392
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
that was the first creature in the history of the world

393
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
that had a computer as its parent --

394
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
it did not have an organic parent.

395
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
And so, asks The Economist:

396
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
"The first artificial organism and its consequences."

397
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
So you may have thought

398
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
that the creation of life

399
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
was going to happen in something that looked like that.

400
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
(Laughter)

401
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
But in fact, that's not what Frankenstein's lab looks like.

402
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
This is what Frankenstein's lab looks like.

403
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
This is a DNA synthesizer,

404
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
and here at the bottom

405
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
are just bottles of A, T, C and G --

406
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
the four chemicals

407
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
that make up our DNA chain.

408
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
And so, we need to ask ourselves some questions.

409
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
For the first time in the history of this planet,

410
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
we are able to directly design organisms.

411
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
We can manipulate the plasmas of life

412
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
with unprecedented power,

413
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
and it confers on us a responsibility.

414
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
Is everything okay?

415
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
Is it okay to manipulate and create

416
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
whatever creatures we want?

417
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
Do we have free reign

418
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
to design animals?

419
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
Do we get to go someday to Pets 'R' Us

420
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
and say, "Look, I want a dog.

421
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
I'd like it to have the head of a Dachshund,

422
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
the body of a retriever,

423
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
maybe some pink fur,

424
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
and let's make it glow in the dark"?

425
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
Does industry get to create creatures

426
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
who, in their milk, in their blood, and in their saliva

427
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
and other bodily fluids,

428
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
create the drugs and industrial molecules we want

429
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
and then warehouse them

430
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:18:33,000
as organic manufacturing machines?

431
0:18:33.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
Do we get to create organic robots,

432
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:39,000
where we remove the autonomy from these animals

433
0:18:39.26,000 --> 0:18:42,000
and turn them just into our playthings?

434
0:18:42.26,000 --> 0:18:45,000
And then the final step of this,

435
0:18:45.26,000 --> 0:18:47,000
once we perfect these technologies in animals

436
0:18:47.26,000 --> 0:18:49,000
and we start using them in human beings,

437
0:18:49.26,000 --> 0:18:51,000
what are the ethical guidelines

438
0:18:51.26,000 --> 0:18:54,000
that we will use then?

439
0:18:54.26,000 --> 0:18:57,000
It's already happening. It's not science fiction.

440
0:18:57.26,000 --> 0:19:,000
We are not only already using these things in animals,

441
0:19:00.26,000 --> 0:19:03,000
some of them we're already beginning to use

442
0:19:03.26,000 --> 0:19:05,000
on our own bodies.

443
0:19:05.26,000 --> 0:19:08,000
We are now taking control of our own evolution.

444
0:19:08.26,000 --> 0:19:1,000
We are directly designing

445
0:19:10.26,000 --> 0:19:13,000
the future of the species of this planet.

446
0:19:13.26,000 --> 0:19:16,000
It confers upon us an enormous responsibility

447
0:19:16.26,000 --> 0:19:18,000
that is not just the responsibility

448
0:19:18.26,000 --> 0:19:2,000
of the scientists and the ethicists

449
0:19:20.26,000 --> 0:19:22,000
who are thinking about it and writing about it now.

450
0:19:22.26,000 --> 0:19:25,000
It is the responsibility of everybody

451
0:19:25.26,000 --> 0:19:28,000
because it will determine what kind of planet and what kind of bodies

452
0:19:28.26,000 --> 0:19:3,000
we will have in the future.

453
0:19:30.26,000 --> 0:19:32,000
Thanks.

454
0:19:32.26,000 --> 0:19:36,000
(Applause)

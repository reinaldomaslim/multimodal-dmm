1
0:00:13.595,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Thirteen point eight billion years ago,

2
0:00:17.872,000 --> 0:00:2,000
the universe as we know it began with a big bang,

3
0:00:21.699,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and everything that we know and are and are made of was created.

4
0:00:29.301,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Fifty thousand years ago,

5
0:00:31.555,000 --> 0:00:34,000
our brains underwent a major genetic mutation,

6
0:00:35.301,000 --> 0:00:39,000
which resulted in the biological reorganization of the brain.

7
0:00:40.494,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Some scientists call this "The Big Brain Bang."

8
0:00:45.887,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Others call it "The Great Leap Forward,"

9
0:00:49.042,000 --> 0:00:5,000
which I prefer.

10
0:00:50.22,000 --> 0:00:51,000
It's so much more poetic.

11
0:00:52.29,000 --> 0:00:58,000
This is when Homo sapiens began to evolve into the modern species that we are today.

12
0:00:59.778,000 --> 0:01:03,000
The Great Leap Forward activated most of our modern abilities:

13
0:01:04.533,000 --> 0:01:06,000
abstract thought, planning,

14
0:01:08.124,000 --> 0:01:1,000
cooking, competitive labor,

15
0:01:10.511,000 --> 0:01:13,000
language, art, music

16
0:01:13.598,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and self-decoration.

17
0:01:15.591,000 --> 0:01:16,000
After the Great Leap Forward,

18
0:01:17.248,000 --> 0:01:21,000
there was an explosion of stone toolmaking,

19
0:01:21.608,000 --> 0:01:23,000
more sophisticated weaponry

20
0:01:24.059,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and, 32,000 years ago,

21
0:01:27.226,000 --> 0:01:33,000
the creation of our first sophisticated mark-making on the cave walls of Lascaux.

22
0:01:35.183,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It's not a coincidence that we've gone from documenting our reality

23
0:01:39.586,000 --> 0:01:41,000
on the cave walls of Lascaux

24
0:01:42.057,000 --> 0:01:44,000
to the walls of Facebook.

25
0:01:45.311,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And, in a very meta experience,

26
0:01:48.432,000 --> 0:01:52,000
you can now a book a trip to see the walls of Lascaux

27
0:01:53.022,000 --> 0:01:54,000
on the walls of Facebook.

28
0:01:56.114,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Approximately 10,000 years ago,

29
0:01:58.962,000 --> 0:02:02,000
men and women began to array themselves with makeup.

30
0:02:04.048,000 --> 0:02:05,000
They started to self-decorate.

31
0:02:06.233,000 --> 0:02:11,000
But this wasn't for seductive purposes; this was for religious convictions.

32
0:02:11.951,000 --> 0:02:15,000
We wanted to be more beautiful, purer, cleaner

33
0:02:16.098,000 --> 0:02:19,000
in the eyes of something or someone

34
0:02:19.182,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that we believed had more power than we did.

35
0:02:22.585,000 --> 0:02:23,000
There is no culture

36
0:02:25.276,000 --> 0:02:27,000
in recorded human history

37
0:02:27.757,000 --> 0:02:31,000
that has not practiced some form of organized worship,

38
0:02:32.68,000 --> 0:02:34,000
which we now call "religion."

39
0:02:36.308,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Six thousand years ago, in an effort to unite people,

40
0:02:40.494,000 --> 0:02:46,000
our ancestors began to design telegraphic symbols to represent beliefs

41
0:02:47.038,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and to identify affiliations.

42
0:02:49.95,000 --> 0:02:52,000
These symbols connected like-minded people,

43
0:02:53.786,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and they are all extraordinary.

44
0:02:56.4,000 --> 0:03:,000
These affiliations allowed us to feel safer and more secure in groups,

45
0:03:01.23,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and the sharing created consensus around what the symbols represented.

46
0:03:06.948,000 --> 0:03:09,000
With these marks, you knew where you fit in,

47
0:03:10.174,000 --> 0:03:13,000
both for the people that were in the in crowd

48
0:03:13.384,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and those, as importantly, that were excluded.

49
0:03:17.085,000 --> 0:03:23,000
These symbols were created in what I consider to be a very bottom-up manner:

50
0:03:23.337,000 --> 0:03:26,000
they were made by people for people

51
0:03:26.432,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and then shared for free among people

52
0:03:30.046,000 --> 0:03:33,000
to honor the higher power that they ascribed to.

53
0:03:34.232,000 --> 0:03:39,000
What's ironic is that the higher power actually had nothing to do with this.

54
0:03:40.721,000 --> 0:03:42,000
These early affiliations,

55
0:03:42.806,000 --> 0:03:45,000
they often shared identical characteristics,

56
0:03:45.87,000 --> 0:03:46,000
which is rather baffling

57
0:03:47.774,000 --> 0:03:5,000
given how scattered we were all over the planet.

58
0:03:51.287,000 --> 0:03:55,000
We constructed similar rituals, practices and behaviors

59
0:03:55.352,000 --> 0:04:,000
no matter where we were anywhere on the globe.

60
0:04:00.483,000 --> 0:04:05,000
We constructed rituals to create symbolic logos.

61
0:04:06.149,000 --> 0:04:08,000
We built environments for worship.

62
0:04:08.638,000 --> 0:04:12,000
We developed strict rules on how to engage with each other

63
0:04:12.855,000 --> 0:04:14,000
with food, with hair,

64
0:04:15.109,000 --> 0:04:16,000
with birth, with death,

65
0:04:17.068,000 --> 0:04:19,000
with marriage and procreation.

66
0:04:19.968,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Some of the symbols have eerie commonalities.

67
0:04:24.315,000 --> 0:04:29,000
The hand of God shows up over and over and over again.

68
0:04:30.21,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It shows up as the hamsa hand in Mesopotamia.

69
0:04:33.815,000 --> 0:04:36,000
It shows us as the hand of Fatima in Islam.

70
0:04:37.258,000 --> 0:04:4,000
It shows up as the hand of Miriam in Judaism.

71
0:04:40.864,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Now, when we didn't agree on what our beliefs and behaviors were

72
0:04:46.593,000 --> 0:04:47,000
in regards to others,

73
0:04:47.831,000 --> 0:04:51,000
if we felt that somebody else's were incorrect,

74
0:04:52.142,000 --> 0:04:54,000
we began to fight,

75
0:04:54.174,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and many of our first wars were religious.

76
0:04:57.269,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Our flags were used on the battlefield

77
0:04:59.604,000 --> 0:05:03,000
to signify which side of the battlefield we belonged to,

78
0:05:03.898,000 --> 0:05:07,000
because that was the only way to be able to tell friend from foe.

79
0:05:08.196,000 --> 0:05:09,000
We all looked alike.

80
0:05:10.054,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And now our flags are on mass-manufactured uniforms

81
0:05:15.158,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that we are making.

82
0:05:16.745,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Logos on products to identify a maker came next,

83
0:05:19.779,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and brands were given legal recognition on January 1, 1876,

84
0:05:26.287,000 --> 0:05:28,000
with the advent of the Trademarks Registration Act.

85
0:05:29.102,000 --> 0:05:33,000
The first trademarked brand was Bass Ale,

86
0:05:33.59,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and I kind of wonder what that says about our humanity

87
0:05:37.558,000 --> 0:05:41,000
that first trademarked brand was an alcoholic beverage.

88
0:05:42.808,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Now, here is what I consider to be

89
0:05:44.839,000 --> 0:05:47,000
the first case of branded product placement.

90
0:05:48.604,000 --> 0:05:52,000
There are bottles of Bass Ale behind me

91
0:05:52.937,000 --> 0:05:54,000
with the logo accurately presented here

92
0:05:55.534,000 --> 0:06:,000
in this very famous painting in 1882 by Édouard Manet.

93
0:06:01.719,000 --> 0:06:06,000
One of the most widely recognized logos in the world today

94
0:06:07.596,000 --> 0:06:08,000
is the Nike swoosh,

95
0:06:09.312,000 --> 0:06:12,000
which was introduced in 1971.

96
0:06:12.757,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Carolyn Davidson, a graphic design student,

97
0:06:15.379,000 --> 0:06:19,000
originally created the logo for 35 dollars.

98
0:06:21.396,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Upon seeing it, Nike CEO Phil Knight stated,

99
0:06:26.789,000 --> 0:06:27,000
"I don't love it

100
0:06:28.511,000 --> 0:06:31,000
but maybe it will grow on me."

101
0:06:31.934,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Maybe it will grow on me.

102
0:06:34.621,000 --> 0:06:36,000
But why is the swoosh so popular?

103
0:06:36.982,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Why is the swoosh so popular?

104
0:06:38.83,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Is it the mark?

105
0:06:41.2,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Or is the marketing?

106
0:06:43.961,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And what can we make of the fact

107
0:06:47.085,000 --> 0:06:51,000
that the Nike swoosh seems to be

108
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
the Newport logo upside down

109
0:06:56.459,000 --> 0:06:59,000
or the Capital One logo on its side?

110
0:07:00.57,000 --> 0:07:03,000
That is not the only logo with a shared identity.

111
0:07:06.347,000 --> 0:07:11,000
This next logo is a logo that has a shared identity

112
0:07:11.989,000 --> 0:07:13,000
with wholly different meanings.

113
0:07:15.108,000 --> 0:07:16,000
As a Jewish person,

114
0:07:16.697,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I believe that this logo,

115
0:07:19.515,000 --> 0:07:21,000
this swastika,

116
0:07:21.589,000 --> 0:07:24,000
is the most heinous logo of all time.

117
0:07:25.448,000 --> 0:07:28,000
But it actually has a rather surprising trajectory.

118
0:07:29.453,000 --> 0:07:32,000
The word "swastika" originally comes from

119
0:07:33.18,000 --> 0:07:37,000
the ancient Sanskrit word "svastika,"

120
0:07:37.211,000 --> 0:07:39,000
which actually means "good fortune,"

121
0:07:39.66,000 --> 0:07:41,000
"luck" and "well-being."

122
0:07:42.701,000 --> 0:07:46,000
In the early 1900s, before it was appropriated by Hitler,

123
0:07:47.496,000 --> 0:07:49,000
it was used by Coca-Cola

124
0:07:50.517,000 --> 0:07:52,000
on a good luck bottle opener.

125
0:07:53.163,000 --> 0:07:57,000
The American Biscuit Company prominently registered the mark

126
0:07:57.611,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and put it on boxes of cookies.

127
0:07:59.849,000 --> 0:08:03,000
The US Playing Card Company registered the mark in 1921

128
0:08:04.233,000 --> 0:08:06,000
for Fortune Playing Cards.

129
0:08:06.363,000 --> 0:08:1,000
The Boy Scouts used the mark on shoes in 1910,

130
0:08:10.994,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and the symbol was also featured on cigar labels, boxtops, road signs

131
0:08:17.63,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and even poker chips.

132
0:08:19.559,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Even the Jain made use of the logo along with a hand of God

133
0:08:24.939,000 --> 0:08:25,000
many millennia ago.

134
0:08:27.372,000 --> 0:08:29,000
These marks were identical,

135
0:08:29.564,000 --> 0:08:31,000
but with use as a Nazi symbol,

136
0:08:31.764,000 --> 0:08:33,000
the impact became very, very different.

137
0:08:35.322,000 --> 0:08:36,000
The hand of God,

138
0:08:37.314,000 --> 0:08:39,000
the Nike swoosh

139
0:08:39.344,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and the swastika:

140
0:08:41.289,000 --> 0:08:46,000
they all demonstrate how we've been manufacturing meaning with visual language

141
0:08:46.991,000 --> 0:08:47,000
over millennia.

142
0:08:49.524,000 --> 0:08:51,000
It's a behavior that's almost as old as we are.

143
0:08:53.039,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Today, in the United States,

144
0:08:55.41,000 --> 0:09:,000
there are over 116,000 malls,

145
0:09:00.533,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and they all look pretty much the same.

146
0:09:03.527,000 --> 0:09:06,000
There are more than 40,000 supermarkets,

147
0:09:07.264,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and they each have over 40,000 items.

148
0:09:11.323,000 --> 0:09:13,000
If you went shopping for bottled water,

149
0:09:13.655,000 --> 0:09:16,000
you'd have over 80 options to choose from.

150
0:09:17.259,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Since their launch in 1912,

151
0:09:20.342,000 --> 0:09:26,000
you could choose from over 100 flavors and variants of Oreo cookies.

152
0:09:27.495,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Now, is this a good thing

153
0:09:30.27,000 --> 0:09:31,000
or is it a bad thing?

154
0:09:33.05,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Is a plethora of choice necessary in a free market?

155
0:09:36.967,000 --> 0:09:39,000
I believe it is both a good and bad thing,

156
0:09:40.505,000 --> 0:09:42,000
as humans are both good and bad,

157
0:09:42.896,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and we're the ones creating and using and buying these brands.

158
0:09:47.608,000 --> 0:09:49,000
However, I think that the question

159
0:09:50.117,000 --> 0:09:55,000
of whether this behavior is good or bad is actually secondary

160
0:09:55.763,000 --> 0:09:56,000
to understanding why --

161
0:09:58.545,000 --> 0:10:02,000
why we behave this way in the first place.

162
0:10:04.552,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Here's the thing:

163
0:10:06.917,000 --> 0:10:08,000
every one of our mass-marketed products

164
0:10:09.64,000 --> 0:10:12,000
are what I consider to be top-down brands.

165
0:10:13.368,000 --> 0:10:15,000
They're still created by people,

166
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
but they are owned, operated, manufactured, advertised,

167
0:10:20.998,000 --> 0:10:23,000
designed, promoted and distributed by the corporation

168
0:10:24.649,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and pushed down and sold to the consumer for financial gain.

169
0:10:29.458,000 --> 0:10:32,000
These corporations have a responsibility to a P and L

170
0:10:32.81,000 --> 0:10:34,000
with an expectation of an ROI

171
0:10:35.271,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and have names like P and G and AT and T and J and J.

172
0:10:42.715,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And that's pretty much the way it's been for the last couple of hundred years:

173
0:10:47.61,000 --> 0:10:5,000
a top-down model controlled by the corporation.

174
0:10:52.641,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Until 2011.

175
0:10:56.264,000 --> 0:10:59,000
That's when we began to see evidence

176
0:10:59.845,000 --> 0:11:03,000
of real, significant, far-reaching change.

177
0:11:04.437,000 --> 0:11:07,000
The Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street

178
0:11:07.578,000 --> 0:11:1,000
proved how the internet could amplify messages

179
0:11:11.205,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and connect like-minded people

180
0:11:13.582,000 --> 0:11:15,000
with powerful beliefs to inspire change.

181
0:11:16.6,000 --> 0:11:19,000
We witnessed a cultural shift via social media

182
0:11:19.991,000 --> 0:11:23,000
with hashtags like #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter.

183
0:11:24.721,000 --> 0:11:26,000
In its wake, the discipline of branding

184
0:11:27.566,000 --> 0:11:31,000
has transformed more in the last 10 years

185
0:11:31.84,000 --> 0:11:35,000
than it has in the last 10,000,

186
0:11:35.945,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and for the first time in modern history,

187
0:11:39.166,000 --> 0:11:41,000
the most popular, influential brands

188
0:11:41.871,000 --> 0:11:45,000
are not brands being pushed down by the corporation.

189
0:11:46.193,000 --> 0:11:5,000
They are brands being pushed up by the people, for the people,

190
0:11:50.812,000 --> 0:11:55,000
for the sole purpose of changing the world and making it a better place.

191
0:11:55.847,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Our greatest innovations aren't brands providing a different form

192
0:12:00.354,000 --> 0:12:02,000
or a different flavor of our favorite snack.

193
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Our greatest innovations are the creation of brands

194
0:12:06.91,000 --> 0:12:08,000
that can make a difference in our lives

195
0:12:09.008,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and reflect the kind of world that we want to live in.

196
0:12:12.9,000 --> 0:12:14,000
In November of 2016,

197
0:12:15.387,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Krista Suh, Jayna Zweiman and Kat Coyle

198
0:12:18.194,000 --> 0:12:23,000
created a hat to be worn at the Women's March in Washington, DC.

199
0:12:23.389,000 --> 0:12:25,000
(Applause)

200
0:12:26.653,000 --> 0:12:29,000
This was the day after the presidential inauguration.

201
0:12:30.133,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Two months later, on January 21, 2017,

202
0:12:34.763,000 --> 0:12:4,000
millions of people all over the world wore handmade pink pussyhats

203
0:12:40.908,000 --> 0:12:43,000
in support of the Women's March all over the world.

204
0:12:44.967,000 --> 0:12:47,000
The hat was not created for any financial benefit.

205
0:12:48.105,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Like our religious symbols created thousands of years ago,

206
0:12:51.991,000 --> 0:12:53,000
the hat was created by the people, for the people

207
0:12:55.012,000 --> 0:13:,000
to serve what I believe is the highest benefit of branding:

208
0:13:00.963,000 --> 0:13:02,000
to unite people in the communication

209
0:13:03.45,000 --> 0:13:04,000
of shared ideals.

210
0:13:06.002,000 --> 0:13:09,000
The pink pussyhat became a mark for a movement.

211
0:13:09.256,000 --> 0:13:12,000
In a very short time, two months,

212
0:13:13.169,000 --> 0:13:15,000
it became universally recognizable.

213
0:13:16.642,000 --> 0:13:19,000
It connected an audience in an unprecedented way.

214
0:13:21.042,000 --> 0:13:22,000
It is a brand,

215
0:13:23.001,000 --> 0:13:24,000
but it is more than that.

216
0:13:25.414,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Today, the pink pussyhat is proof positive

217
0:13:28.58,000 --> 0:13:31,000
that branding is not just a tool of capitalism.

218
0:13:33.162,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Branding is the profound manifestation of the human spirit.

219
0:13:37.957,000 --> 0:13:43,000
The condition of branding has always reflected the condition of our culture.

220
0:13:45.699,000 --> 0:13:47,000
It is our responsibility

221
0:13:47.81,000 --> 0:13:51,000
to continue to leverage the democratic power branding provides,

222
0:13:52.815,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and it is our responsibility

223
0:13:55.654,000 --> 0:13:57,000
to design a culture that reflects

224
0:13:58.911,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and honors

225
0:14:01.317,000 --> 0:14:02,000
the kind of world we want to live in.

226
0:14:03.741,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Thank you.

227
0:14:04.93,000 --> 0:14:07,000
(Applause)

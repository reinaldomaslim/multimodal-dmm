1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I'm really scared. I don't think we're going to make it.

2
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Probably by now most of you have seen Al Gore's amazing talk.

3
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Shortly after I saw that, we had some friends over for dinner

4
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:44,000
with the family. The conversation turned to global warming,

5
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and everybody agreed, there's a real problem.

6
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:5,000
We've got a climate crisis.

7
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So, we went around the table to talk about what we should do.

8
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:58,000
The conversation came to my 15-year-old daughter, Mary.

9
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:03,000
She said, "I agree with everything that's been said.

10
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I'm scared and I'm angry." And then she turned to me and said,

11
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:17,000
"Dad, your generation created this problem; you'd better fix it." Wow.

12
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:21,000
All the conversation stopped. All the eyes turned to me.

13
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:26,000
(Laughter)

14
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I didn't know what to say. Kleiner's second law is,

15
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:36,000
"There is a time when panic is the appropriate response."

16
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And we've reached that time. We cannot afford to underestimate

18
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:51,000
this problem. If we face irreversible and catastrophic consequences,

19
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:53,000
we must act, and we must act decisively.

20
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I've got to tell you, for me, everything changed that evening.

21
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And so, my partners and I, we set off on this mission to learn more,

22
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:06,000
to try to do much more. So, we mobilized. We got on airplanes.

23
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:09,000
We went to Brazil. We went to China and to India,

24
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:14,000
to Bentonville, Arkansas, to Washington, D.C. and to Sacramento.

25
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And so, what I'd like to do now is to tell you

26
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:2,000
about what we've learned in those journeys.

27
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Because the more we learned, the more concerned we grew.

28
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:25,000
You know, my partners at Kleiner and I were compulsive networkers,

29
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and so when we see a big problem or an opportunity

30
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:31,000
like avian flu or personalized medicine,

31
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:34,000
we just get together the smartest people we know.

32
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:38,000
For this climate crisis, we assembled a network, really,

33
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:43,000
of superstars, from policy activists to scientists and entrepreneurs

34
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and business leaders. Fifty or so of them.

35
0:02:45,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And so, I want to tell you about what we've learned in doing that

36
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and four lessons I've learned in the last year.

37
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:55,000
The first lesson is that companies are really powerful,

38
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and that matters a lot. This is a story about

39
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:02,000
how Wal-Mart went green, and what that means.

40
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Two years ago, the CEO, Lee Scott, believed that green is

41
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:12,000
the next big thing, and so Wal-Mart made going green a top priority.

42
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:15,000
They committed that they're going to take their existing stores

43
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and reduce their energy consumption by 20 percent,

44
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and their new stores by 30 percent, and do all that in seven years.

45
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:27,000
The three biggest uses of energy in a store are heating

46
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and air conditioning, then lighting, and then refrigeration.

47
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So, look what they did.

48
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
They painted the roofs of all their stores white.

49
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:38,000
They put smart skylights through their stores

50
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:42,000
so they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands.

51
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And, third, they put the refrigerated goods

52
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:46,000
behind closed doors with LED lighting.

53
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I mean, why would you try to refrigerate a whole store?

54
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:54,000
These are really simple, smart solutions based on existing technology.

55
0:03:55,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Why does Wal-Mart matter? Well, it's massive.

56
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:01,000
They're the largest private employer in America.

57
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:03,000
They're the largest private user of electricity.

58
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:07,000
They have the second-largest vehicle fleet on the road.

59
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And they have one of the world's most amazing supply chains,

60
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:13,000
60,000 suppliers. If Wal-Mart were a country,

61
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:17,000
it would be the sixth-largest trading partner with China.

62
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And maybe most important, they have a big effect on other companies.

63
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:27,000
When Wal-Mart declares it's going to go green and be profitable,

64
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:3,000
it has a powerful impact on other great institutions.

65
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So, let me tell you this:

66
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:34,000
when Wal-Mart achieves 20 percent energy reductions,

67
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that's going to be a very big deal. But I'm afraid it's not enough.

68
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:45,000
We need Wal-Mart and every other company to do the same.

69
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:48,000
The second thing that we learned is that individuals matter,

70
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and they matter enormously.

71
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I've got another Wal-Mart story for you, OK?

72
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Wal-Mart has over 125 million U.S. customers.

73
0:04:56,000 --> 0:04:58,000
That's a third of the U.S. population.

74
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:04,000
65 million compact fluorescent light bulbs were sold last year.

75
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And Wal-Mart has committed they're going to sell

76
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:12,000
another 100 million light bulbs in the coming year. But it's not easy.

77
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Consumers don't really like these light bulbs.

78
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:17,000
The light's kind of funny, they won't dim,

79
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:19,000
takes a while for them to start up.

80
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:22,000
But the pay-off is really enormous.

81
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:25,000
100 million compact fluorescent light bulbs means

82
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:29,000
that we'll save 600 million dollars in energy bills,

83
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and 20 million tons of CO2 every year, year in and year out.

84
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:39,000
It does seem really hard to get consumers to do the right thing.

85
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:45,000
It is stupid that we use two tons of steel, glass and plastic

86
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:47,000
to haul our sorry selves to the shopping mall.

87
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:52,000
It's stupid that we put water in plastic bottles

88
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:55,000
in Fiji and ship it here.

89
0:05:56,000 --> 0:05:58,000
(Laughter)

90
0:05:58,000 --> 0:06:,000
It's hard to change consumer behavior

91
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:04,000
because consumers don't know how much this stuff costs. Do you know?

92
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Do you know how much CO2 you generated to drive here or fly here?

93
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I don't know, and I should.

94
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Those of us who care about all this would act better

95
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:18,000
if we knew what the real costs were.

96
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:21,000
But as long as we pretend that CO2 is free,

97
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:26,000
as long as these uses are nearly invisible, how can we expect change?

98
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I'm really afraid, because I think the kinds of changes

99
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:32,000
we can reasonably expect from individuals

100
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
are going to be clearly not enough.

101
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:41,000
The third lesson we learned is that policy matters. It really matters.

102
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:43,000
In fact, policy is paramount.

103
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:46,000
I've got a behind-the-scenes story for you

104
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:47,000
about that green tech network I described.

105
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:5,000
At the end of our first meeting, we got together to talk about

106
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:53,000
what the action items would be, how we'd follow up.

107
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And Bob Epstein raised a hand. He stood up.

108
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:01,000
You know, Bob's that Berkeley techie type who started Sybase.

109
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Well, Bob said the most important thing we could do right now

110
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:08,000
is to make it clear in Sacramento, California

111
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:12,000
that we need a market-based system of mandates

112
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in California.

113
0:07:17,000 --> 0:07:2,000
It's necessary and, just as important,

114
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:22,000
it's good for the California economy.

115
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:25,000
So, eight of us went to Sacramento in August and we met

116
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:3,000
with the seven undecided legislators and we lobbied for AB32.

117
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:33,000
You know what? Six of those seven voted yes in favor of the bill,

118
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
so it passed, and it passed by a vote of 47 to 32.

119
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:42,000
(Applause)

120
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Please. Thank you.

121
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I think it's the most important legislation of 2006. Why?

122
0:07:47,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Because California was the first state in this country

123
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:55,000
to mandate 25 percent reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020.

124
0:07:55,000 --> 0:08:,000
And the result of that is, we're going to generate 83,000 new jobs,

125
0:08:,000 --> 0:08:04,000
four billion dollars a year in annual income, and reduce the CO2 emissions

126
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:07,000
by 174 million tons a year.

127
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:14,000
California emits only seven percent of U.S. CO2 emissions.

128
0:08:14,000 --> 0:08:17,000
It's only a percent and a half of the country's CO2 emissions. It's a great start,

129
0:08:17,000 --> 0:08:21,000
but I've got to tell you -- where I started -- I'm really afraid.

130
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:25,000
In fact, I'm certain California's not enough.

131
0:08:26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Here's a story about national policy that we could all learn from.

132
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:33,000
You know Tom Friedman says, "If you don't go, you don't know"?

133
0:08:33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Well, we went to Brazil to meet Dr. Jose Goldemberg.

134
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:4,000
He's the father of the ethanol revolution.

135
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:43,000
He told us that Brazil's government mandated

136
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:47,000
that every gasoline station in the country would carry ethanol.

137
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And they mandated that their new vehicles

138
0:08:5,000 --> 0:08:52,000
would be flex-fuel compatible, right?

139
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:55,000
They'd run ethanol or ordinary gasoline.

140
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And so, here's what's happened in Brazil.

141
0:08:57,000 --> 0:09:,000
They now have 29,000 ethanol pumps --

142
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:04,000
this versus 700 in the U.S., and a paltry two in California --

143
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and in three years their new car fleet

144
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:1,000
has gone from four percent to 85 percent flex-fuel.

145
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Compare that to the U.S.: five percent are flex-fuel.

146
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And you know what? Most consumers who have them don't even know it.

147
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:22,000
So, what's happened in Brazil is, they've replaced

148
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:26,000
40 percent of the gasoline consumed by their automotive fleet with ethanol.

149
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
That's 59 billion dollars since 1975

150
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:32,000
that they didn't ship to the Middle East.

151
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:35,000
It's created a million jobs inside that country,

152
0:09:35,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and it's saved 32 million tons of CO2. It's really substantial.

153
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:42,000
That's 10 percent of the CO2 emissions across their entire country.

154
0:09:43,000 --> 0:09:47,000
But Brazil's only 1.3 percent of the world's CO2 emission.

155
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So, Brazil's ethanol miracle, I'm really afraid, is not enough.

156
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:57,000
In fact, I'm afraid all of the best policies we have

157
0:09:57,000 --> 0:10:,000
are not going to be enough.

158
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:03,000
The fourth and final lesson we've learned

159
0:10:03,000 --> 0:10:05,000
is about the potential of radical innovation.

160
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:07,000
So, I want to tell you about a tragic problem

161
0:10:07,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and a breakthrough technology.

162
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Every year a million and a half people die of

163
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:16,000
a completely preventable disease. That's malaria. 6,000 people a day.

164
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:19,000
All for want of two dollars' worth of medications

165
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:21,000
that we can buy at the corner drugstore.

166
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Well, two dollars, two dollars is too much for Africa.

167
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:29,000
So, a team of Berkeley researchers with 15 million dollars

168
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:35,000
from the Gates Foundation is engineering, designing a radical new way

169
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:38,000
to make the key ingredient, called artemisinin,

170
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and they're going to make that drug 10 times cheaper.

171
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And in doing so, they'll save a million lives --

172
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:46,000
at least a million lives a year. A million lives.

173
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Their breakthrough technology is synthetic biology.

174
0:10:51,000 --> 0:10:53,000
This leverages millions of years of evolution

175
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:56,000
by redesigning bugs to make really useful products.

176
0:10:56,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Now, what you do is, you get inside the microbe,

177
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:04,000
you change its metabolic pathways, and you end up with a living chemical factory.

178
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Now, you may ask,

179
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:09,000
John, what has this got to go with green and with climate crisis?

180
0:11:09,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Well, I'll tell you -- a lot.

181
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:15,000
We've now formed a company called Amyris, and this technology

182
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:19,000
that they're using can be used to make better biofuels.

183
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Don't let me skip over that. Better biofuels are a really big deal.

184
0:11:23,000 --> 0:11:27,000
That means we can precisely engineer the molecules in the fuel chain

185
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and optimize them along the way.

186
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:35,000
So, if all goes well, they're going to have designer bugs in warm vats

187
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:42,000
that are eating and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels.

188
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:45,000
I guess that's better living through bugs.

189
0:11:46,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Alan Kay is famous for saying

190
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:5,000
the best way to predict the future is to invent it.

191
0:11:5,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And, of course, at Kleiner we, kind of, apologize and say

192
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:55,000
the second best way is to finance it.

193
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And that's why we're investing 200 million dollars

194
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:02,000
in a wide range of really disruptive new technologies

195
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:04,000
for innovation in green technologies.

196
0:12:04,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And we're encouraging others to do it as well.

197
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:08,000
We're talking a lot about this.

198
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:13,000
In 2005, there were 600 million dollars invested in new technologies

199
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:18,000
of the sort you see here. It doubled in 2006 to 1.2 billion dollars.

200
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:23,000
But I'm really afraid we need much, much more.

201
0:12:24,000 --> 0:12:25,000
For reference, fact one:

202
0:12:25,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Exxon's revenues in 2005 were a billion dollars a day.

203
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Do you know, they only invested 0.2 percent of revenues in R&D?

204
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Second fact: the President's new budget for renewable energy

205
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:38,000
is barely a billion dollars in total.

206
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Less than one day of Exxon's revenues.

207
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Third fact: I bet you didn't know that there's enough energy

208
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:5,000
in hot rocks under the country to supply America's energy needs

209
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:54,000
for the next thousand years. And the federal budget

210
0:12:54,000 --> 0:12:59,000
calls for a measly 20 million dollars of R&D in geothermal energy.

211
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:02,000
It is almost criminal that we are not investing more

212
0:13:02,000 --> 0:13:05,000
in energy research in this country.

213
0:13:05,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And I am really afraid that it's absolutely not enough.

214
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:13,000
So, in a year's worth of learning we found a bunch of surprises.

215
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Who would have thought that a mass retailer

216
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:17,000
could make money by going green? Who would have thought that

217
0:13:17,000 --> 0:13:21,000
a database entrepreneur could transform California with legislation?

218
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Who would have thought that the ethanol biofuel miracle

219
0:13:25,000 --> 0:13:28,000
would come from a developing country in South America?

220
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And who would have thought that scientists

221
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:34,000
trying to cure malaria could come up with breakthroughs in biofuels?

222
0:13:35,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And who would have thought that all that is not enough?

223
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Not enough to stabilize the climate.

224
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Not enough to keep the ice in Greenland from crashing into the ocean.

225
0:13:46,000 --> 0:13:48,000
The scientists tell us -- and they're only guessing --

226
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:52,000
that we've got to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by one half,

227
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and do it as fast as possible.

228
0:13:53,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Now, we may have the political will to do this in the U.S.,

229
0:13:56,000 --> 0:13:59,000
but I've got to tell you, we've got only one atmosphere,

230
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and so somehow we're going to have to find the political will

231
0:14:02,000 --> 0:14:09,000
to do this all around the world. The wild card in this deck is China.

232
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:15,000
To size the problem, China's CO2 emissions today are 3.3 gigatons;

233
0:14:15,000 --> 0:14:19,000
the U.S. is 5.8. Business as usual means

234
0:14:19,000 --> 0:14:22,000
we'll have 23 gigatons from China by 2050.

235
0:14:22,000 --> 0:14:25,000
That's about as much CO2 as there is in the whole world.

236
0:14:25,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And if it's business as usual, we're going out of business.

237
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:31,000
When I was in Davos, China's Mayor of Dalian was pressed

238
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:34,000
about their CO2 strategy, and he said the following,

239
0:14:34,000 --> 0:14:39,000
"You know, Americans use seven times the CO2 per capita as Chinese."

240
0:14:39,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Then he asked, "Why should China sacrifice our growth

241
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:47,000
so that the West can continue to be profligate and stupid?"

242
0:14:47,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Does anybody here have an answer for him? I don't.

243
0:14:52,000 --> 0:14:58,000
We've got to make this economic so that all people and all nations

244
0:14:59,000 --> 0:15:01,000
make the right outcome, the profitable outcome,

245
0:15:01,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and therefore the likely outcome.

246
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Energy's a six-trillion-dollar business worldwide.

247
0:15:05,000 --> 0:15:09,000
It is the mother of all markets. You remember that Internet?

248
0:15:09,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Well, I'll tell you what. Green technologies -- going green --

249
0:15:13,000 --> 0:15:14,000
is bigger than the Internet.

250
0:15:14,000 --> 0:15:18,000
It could be the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century.

251
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:2,000
Moreover, if we succeed, it's going to be

252
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:24,000
the most important transformation for life on the planet since,

253
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:27,000
as Bill Joy says, we went from methane to oxygen in the atmosphere.

254
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Now, here's the hard question, if the trajectory of all the world's

255
0:15:33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
companies and individuals and policies and innovation

256
0:15:37,000 --> 0:15:44,000
is not going to be enough, what are we going to do? I don't know.

257
0:15:45,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Everyone here cares about changing the world

258
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:5,000
and has made a difference in that one way or another.

259
0:15:51,000 --> 0:15:55,000
So, our call to action -- my call to you --

260
0:15:55,000 --> 0:16:01,000
is for you to make going green your next big thing, your gig.

261
0:16:02,000 --> 0:16:08,000
What can you do? You can personally get carbon neutral.

262
0:16:08,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Go to ClimateCrisis.org or CarbonCalculator.com

263
0:16:12,000 --> 0:16:17,000
and buy carbon credits. You could join other leaders in mandating,

264
0:16:17,000 --> 0:16:22,000
lobbying for mandated cap and trade in U.S. greenhouse gas reductions.

265
0:16:22,000 --> 0:16:26,000
There's six bills right now in Congress. Let's get one of them passed.

266
0:16:27,000 --> 0:16:29,000
And the most important thing you can do, I think,

267
0:16:29,000 --> 0:16:31,000
is to use your personal power and your Rolodex

268
0:16:31,000 --> 0:16:35,000
to lead your business, your institution, in going green.

269
0:16:35,000 --> 0:16:37,000
Do it like Wal-Mart, get it to go green

270
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:42,000
for its customers and its suppliers and for itself.

271
0:16:42,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Really think outside the box.

272
0:16:44,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Can you imagine what it would be like if Amazon or eBay or Google

273
0:16:49,000 --> 0:16:54,000
or Microsoft or Apple really went green and you caused that to happen?

274
0:16:54,000 --> 0:16:57,000
It could be bigger than Wal-Mart.

275
0:16:59,000 --> 0:17:05,000
I can't wait to see what we TEDsters do about this crisis.

276
0:17:05,000 --> 0:17:09,000
And I really, really hope that we multiply all of our energy,

277
0:17:09,000 --> 0:17:13,000
all of our talent and all of our influence to solve this problem.

278
0:17:24,000 --> 0:17:3,000
Because if we do, I can look forward

279
0:17:3,000 --> 0:17:34,000
to the conversation I'm going to have with my daughter in 20 years.

280
0:17:34,000 --> 0:17:55,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.291,000 --> 0:00:2,000
My students often ask me, "What is sociology?"

2
0:00:20.818,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And I tell them it's the study of the way in which human beings are shaped

3
0:00:25.194,000 --> 0:00:26,000
by things that they don't see.

4
0:00:27.761,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And they say, "So, how can I be a sociologist?

5
0:00:31.92,000 --> 0:00:33,000
How can I understand those invisible forces?"

6
0:00:34.062,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And I say, "Empathy.

7
0:00:35.614,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Start with empathy.

8
0:00:37.738,000 --> 0:00:39,000
It all begins with empathy.

9
0:00:40.544,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Take yourself out of your shoes,

10
0:00:42.324,000 --> 0:00:44,000
put yourself into the shoes of another person."

11
0:00:44.992,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Here, I'll give you an example.

12
0:00:47.523,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So I imagine my life if, a hundred years ago,

13
0:00:50.951,000 --> 0:00:52,000
China had been the most powerful nation in the world

14
0:00:53.825,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and they came to the United States in search of coal.

15
0:00:57.336,000 --> 0:01:,000
And they found it, and, in fact, they found lots of it right here.

16
0:01:00.551,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And pretty soon, they began shipping that coal,

17
0:01:04.101,000 --> 0:01:05,000
ton by ton,

18
0:01:05.901,000 --> 0:01:08,000
railcar by railcar, boatload by boatload,

19
0:01:09.363,000 --> 0:01:12,000
back to China and elsewhere around the world.

20
0:01:13.329,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And they got fabulously wealthy in doing so.

21
0:01:15.603,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And they built beautiful cities

22
0:01:17.96,000 --> 0:01:2,000
all powered on that coal.

23
0:01:22.872,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And back here in the United States,

24
0:01:26.317,000 --> 0:01:28,000
we saw economic despair, deprivation.

25
0:01:28.488,000 --> 0:01:29,000
This is what I saw.

26
0:01:29.96,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I saw people struggling to get by,

27
0:01:32.615,000 --> 0:01:35,000
not knowing what was what and what was next.

28
0:01:35.734,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And I asked myself the question:

29
0:01:38.025,000 --> 0:01:41,000
How is it possible that we could be so poor here in the United States,

30
0:01:41.379,000 --> 0:01:44,000
because coal is such a wealthy resource; it's so much money?

31
0:01:45.108,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And I realize:

32
0:01:46.292,000 --> 0:01:49,000
because the Chinese ingratiated themselves

33
0:01:49.721,000 --> 0:01:51,000
with a small ruling class here in the United States,

34
0:01:52.504,000 --> 0:01:55,000
who stole all of that money and all of that wealth for themselves.

35
0:01:56.69,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And the rest of us, the vast majority of us,

36
0:01:58.88,000 --> 0:01:59,000
struggle to get by.

37
0:02:00.649,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And the Chinese gave this small ruling elite

38
0:02:03.777,000 --> 0:02:06,000
loads of military weapons and sophisticated technology

39
0:02:07.17,000 --> 0:02:09,000
in order to ensure that people like me

40
0:02:09.96,000 --> 0:02:12,000
would not speak out against this relationship.

41
0:02:13.833,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Does this sound familiar?

42
0:02:16.705,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And they did things like train Americans to help protect the coal.

43
0:02:20.316,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And everywhere, there were symbols of the Chinese --

44
0:02:23.578,000 --> 0:02:25,000
everywhere, a constant reminder.

45
0:02:27.191,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And back in China,

46
0:02:29.358,000 --> 0:02:3,000
what do they say in China?

47
0:02:30.708,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Nothing! They don't talk about us. They don't talk about the coal.

48
0:02:34.331,000 --> 0:02:35,000
If you ask them,

49
0:02:35.545,000 --> 0:02:37,000
they'll say, "Well, you know, we need the coal.

50
0:02:37.96,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I mean, come on, I'm not going to turn down my thermostat.

51
0:02:41.682,000 --> 0:02:42,000
You can't expect that."

52
0:02:43.634,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And so, I get angry, and I get pissed,

53
0:02:46.833,000 --> 0:02:48,000
as do lots of average people.

54
0:02:49.17,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And we fight back, and it gets really ugly.

55
0:02:51.736,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And the Chinese respond in a very ugly way.

56
0:02:55.88,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And before we know it, they send in the tanks

57
0:02:58.299,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and they send in the troops.

58
0:03:00.642,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And lots of people are dying.

59
0:03:02.96,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And it's a very, very difficult situation.

60
0:03:07.936,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Can you imagine what you would feel

61
0:03:11.007,000 --> 0:03:13,000
if you were in my shoes?

62
0:03:13.196,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Can you imagine walking out of this building

63
0:03:15.545,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and seeing a tank sitting out there,

64
0:03:17.387,000 --> 0:03:19,000
or a truck full of soldiers?

65
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Just imagine what you would feel, because you know why they're here;

66
0:03:24.404,000 --> 0:03:25,000
you know what they're doing here.

67
0:03:26.074,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And you just feel the anger and you feel the fear.

68
0:03:29.634,000 --> 0:03:31,000
If you can, that's empathy. That's empathy.

69
0:03:32.424,000 --> 0:03:35,000
You've left your shoes, and you've stood in mine.

70
0:03:36.398,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And you've got to feel that.

71
0:03:38.237,000 --> 0:03:39,000
OK, so that's the warm-up.

72
0:03:40.316,000 --> 0:03:41,000
That's the warm-up.

73
0:03:41.512,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Now we're going to have the real radical experiment.

74
0:03:45.27,000 --> 0:03:48,000
So, for the remainder of my talk, what I want you to do

75
0:03:48.96,000 --> 0:03:52,000
is put yourselves in the shoes of an ordinary Arab Muslim

76
0:03:53.572,000 --> 0:03:54,000
living in the Middle East --

77
0:03:55.325,000 --> 0:03:57,000
in particular, in Iraq.

78
0:03:59.603,000 --> 0:04:,000
And so to help you,

79
0:04:01.531,000 --> 0:04:04,000
perhaps you're a member of this middle-class family in Baghdad.

80
0:04:05.864,000 --> 0:04:07,000
What you want is the best for your kids.

81
0:04:08.582,000 --> 0:04:09,000
You want your kids to have a better life.

82
0:04:10.583,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And you watch the news, you pay attention.

83
0:04:12.694,000 --> 0:04:15,000
You read the newspaper, you go down to the coffee shop with your friends,

84
0:04:16.272,000 --> 0:04:18,000
you read the newspapers from around the world.

85
0:04:18.517,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Sometimes you even watch satellite, CNN, from the United States.

86
0:04:21.577,000 --> 0:04:23,000
You have a sense of what the Americans are thinking.

87
0:04:24.088,000 --> 0:04:27,000
But really, you just want a better life for yourself.

88
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
That's what you want.

89
0:04:28.705,000 --> 0:04:31,000
You're Arab Muslim living in Iraq.

90
0:04:31.793,000 --> 0:04:32,000
You want a better life for yourself.

91
0:04:33.564,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So here, let me help you.

92
0:04:34.802,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Let me help you with some things that you might be thinking.

93
0:04:38.317,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Number one:

94
0:04:39.61,000 --> 0:04:43,000
this incursion into your land these past 20 years and before --

95
0:04:43.96,000 --> 0:04:45,000
the reason anyone is interested in your land,

96
0:04:46.103,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and particularly the United States, is oil.

97
0:04:48.271,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It's all about oil; you know that, everybody knows that.

98
0:04:51.404,000 --> 0:04:54,000
People back in the United States know it's about oil.

99
0:04:54.719,000 --> 0:04:59,000
It's because somebody else has a design for your resource.

100
0:04:59.841,000 --> 0:05:01,000
It's your resource -- it's not somebody else's.

101
0:05:02.418,000 --> 0:05:04,000
It's your land; it's your resource.

102
0:05:05.42,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Somebody else has a design for it.

103
0:05:08.038,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And you know why they have a design?

104
0:05:09.915,000 --> 0:05:11,000
You know why they have their eyes set on it?

105
0:05:12.036,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Because they have an entire economic system

106
0:05:14.134,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that's dependent on that oil -- foreign oil,

107
0:05:17.367,000 --> 0:05:19,000
oil from other parts of the world that they don't own.

108
0:05:20.507,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And what else do you think about these people?

109
0:05:23.098,000 --> 0:05:24,000
The Americans, they're rich.

110
0:05:24.53,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Come on, they live in big houses, they have big cars.

111
0:05:27.075,000 --> 0:05:29,000
They all have blond hair, blue eyes. They're happy.

112
0:05:29.499,000 --> 0:05:32,000
You think that. It's not true, of course, but that's the media impression.

113
0:05:33.032,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And that's what you get.

114
0:05:34.252,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And they have big cities,

115
0:05:35.484,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and the cities are all dependent on oil.

116
0:05:39.96,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And back home, what do you see?

117
0:05:41.96,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Poverty, despair, struggle.

118
0:05:44.476,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Look, you don't live in a wealthy country.

119
0:05:46.892,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I mean -- this is Iraq.

120
0:05:50.535,000 --> 0:05:51,000
This is what you see.

121
0:05:52.472,000 --> 0:05:54,000
You see people struggling to get by.

122
0:05:55.133,000 --> 0:05:57,000
It's not easy; you see a lot of poverty.

123
0:05:57.226,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And you feel something about this.

124
0:05:58.917,000 --> 0:06:,000
These people have designs for your resource,

125
0:06:01.038,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and this is what you see?

126
0:06:03.242,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Something else you see that you talk about --

127
0:06:05.378,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Americans don't talk about this, but you do --

128
0:06:07.612,000 --> 0:06:09,000
there's this thing, this militarization of the world,

129
0:06:10.163,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and it's centered right in the United States.

130
0:06:12.331,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And the United States is responsible

131
0:06:14.229,000 --> 0:06:18,000
for almost one half of the world's military spending.

132
0:06:19.524,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Four percent of the world's population!

133
0:06:21.54,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And you feel it; you see it every day.

134
0:06:24.108,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It's part of your life.

135
0:06:25.454,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And you talk about it with your friends.

136
0:06:28.256,000 --> 0:06:29,000
You read about it.

137
0:06:29.868,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And back when Saddam Hussein was in power,

138
0:06:33.746,000 --> 0:06:35,000
the Americans didn't care about his crimes.

139
0:06:36.671,000 --> 0:06:38,000
When he was gassing the Kurds and gassing Iran,

140
0:06:39.112,000 --> 0:06:4,000
they didn't care about it.

141
0:06:40.611,000 --> 0:06:42,000
When oil was at stake,

142
0:06:42.714,000 --> 0:06:45,000
somehow, suddenly, things mattered.

143
0:06:47.745,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And what you see, something else:

144
0:06:50.171,000 --> 0:06:51,000
the United States,

145
0:06:51.981,000 --> 0:06:53,000
the hub of democracy around the world --

146
0:06:54.114,000 --> 0:06:57,000
they don't seem to really be supporting democratic countries

147
0:06:57.777,000 --> 0:06:58,000
all around the world.

148
0:06:59.688,000 --> 0:07:01,000
There are a lot of countries, oil-producing countries,

149
0:07:02.431,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that aren't very democratic, but supported by the United States.

150
0:07:06.39,000 --> 0:07:07,000
That's odd.

151
0:07:07.577,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Oh -- these incursions, these two wars,

152
0:07:10.402,000 --> 0:07:12,000
the 10 years of sanctions,

153
0:07:12.738,000 --> 0:07:15,000
the eight years of occupation,

154
0:07:16.433,000 --> 0:07:19,000
the insurgency that's been unleashed on your people,

155
0:07:20.111,000 --> 0:07:22,000
the tens of thousands, the hundreds of thousands

156
0:07:22.96,000 --> 0:07:24,000
of civilian deaths?

157
0:07:28.174,000 --> 0:07:29,000
All because of oil.

158
0:07:30.888,000 --> 0:07:31,000
You can't help but think that.

159
0:07:32.848,000 --> 0:07:33,000
You talk about it.

160
0:07:34.96,000 --> 0:07:36,000
It's in the forefront of your mind, always.

161
0:07:37.96,000 --> 0:07:39,000
You say, "How is that possible?"

162
0:07:40.467,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And this man, he's everyman --

163
0:07:43.96,000 --> 0:07:45,000
your grandfather, your uncle,

164
0:07:46.035,000 --> 0:07:48,000
your father, your son, your neighbor,

165
0:07:48.122,000 --> 0:07:49,000
your professor, your student.

166
0:07:50.352,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Once a life of happiness and joy

167
0:07:53.255,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and suddenly, pain and sorrow.

168
0:07:57.36,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Everyone in your country has been touched by the violence,

169
0:08:03.598,000 --> 0:08:06,000
the bloodshed, the pain, the horror -- everybody.

170
0:08:06.707,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Not a single person in your country has not been touched.

171
0:08:12.384,000 --> 0:08:13,000
But there's something else.

172
0:08:13.96,000 --> 0:08:16,000
There's something else about these people, these Americans who are there.

173
0:08:17.96,000 --> 0:08:19,000
There's something else about them that you see

174
0:08:20.185,000 --> 0:08:21,000
that they don't see themselves.

175
0:08:21.783,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And what do you see? They're Christians!

176
0:08:23.959,000 --> 0:08:24,000
They're Christians.

177
0:08:25.451,000 --> 0:08:28,000
They worship the Christian God, they have crosses, they carry Bibles.

178
0:08:28.976,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Their Bibles have a little insignia

179
0:08:31.158,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that says "US Army" on them.

180
0:08:34.96,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And their leaders, their leaders:

181
0:08:37.96,000 --> 0:08:41,000
before they send their sons and daughters off to war in your country --

182
0:08:42.277,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and you know the reason --

183
0:08:43.639,000 --> 0:08:44,000
before they send them off,

184
0:08:45.23,000 --> 0:08:48,000
they go to a Christian church, and they pray to their Christian God,

185
0:08:48.556,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and they ask for protection and guidance from that god.

186
0:08:51.364,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Why?

187
0:08:52.565,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Well, obviously, when people die in the war,

188
0:08:56.642,000 --> 0:09:,000
they are Muslims, they are Iraqis -- they're not Americans.

189
0:09:01.245,000 --> 0:09:03,000
You don't want Americans to die -- "Protect Our Troops."

190
0:09:04.089,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And you feel something about that --

191
0:09:06.444,000 --> 0:09:07,000
of course you do.

192
0:09:07.671,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And they do wonderful things.

193
0:09:09.622,000 --> 0:09:1,000
You read about it, you hear about it.

194
0:09:11.46,000 --> 0:09:13,000
They're there to build schools and help people.

195
0:09:13.702,000 --> 0:09:14,000
That's what they want to do.

196
0:09:15.095,000 --> 0:09:17,000
They do wonderful things, but they also do the bad things,

197
0:09:17.887,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and you can't tell the difference.

198
0:09:19.546,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And this guy, you get a guy like Lt. Gen. William Boykin.

199
0:09:22.337,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Here's a guy who says that your god is a false god.

200
0:09:24.858,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Your god's an idol; his god is the true god.

201
0:09:26.96,000 --> 0:09:29,000
The solution to the problem in the Middle East, according to him,

202
0:09:30.08,000 --> 0:09:31,000
is to convert you all to Christianity --

203
0:09:32.038,000 --> 0:09:33,000
just get rid of your religion.

204
0:09:33.96,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And you know that. Americans don't read about this guy.

205
0:09:36.695,000 --> 0:09:38,000
They don't know anything about him, but you do.

206
0:09:38.96,000 --> 0:09:4,000
You pass it around. You pass his words around.

207
0:09:41.175,000 --> 0:09:43,000
I mean, this is serious. You're afraid.

208
0:09:43.771,000 --> 0:09:46,000
He was one of the leading commanders in the second invasion of Iraq.

209
0:09:47.035,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And you're thinking, "My God, if this guy is saying that,

210
0:09:49.773,000 --> 0:09:51,000
then all the soldiers must be saying that."

211
0:09:52.372,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And this word here --

212
0:09:53.881,000 --> 0:09:54,000
George Bush called this war a crusade.

213
0:09:55.818,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Man, the Americans, they're just like, "Ah, crusade.

214
0:09:58.32,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Whatever. I don't know what that means."

215
0:10:00.29,000 --> 0:10:03,000
You know what it means -- it's a holy war against Muslims.

216
0:10:03.339,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Look, invade, subdue them, take their resources.

217
0:10:07.192,000 --> 0:10:08,000
If they won't submit, kill them.

218
0:10:09.465,000 --> 0:10:1,000
That's what this is about.

219
0:10:10.84,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And you're thinking, "My God, these Christians are coming to kill us."

220
0:10:14.492,000 --> 0:10:15,000
This is frightening.

221
0:10:15.96,000 --> 0:10:17,000
You feel frightened. Of course you feel frightened.

222
0:10:18.738,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And this man, Terry Jones:

223
0:10:21.459,000 --> 0:10:23,000
I mean here's a guy who wants to burn Qurans, right?

224
0:10:24.23,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And the Americans: "Ah, he's a knucklehead.

225
0:10:26.907,000 --> 0:10:29,000
He's a former hotel manager; he's got three dozen members of his church ..."

226
0:10:30.56,000 --> 0:10:31,000
They laugh him off.

227
0:10:31.751,000 --> 0:10:34,000
You don't laugh him off, because in the context of everything else,

228
0:10:34.961,000 --> 0:10:35,000
all the pieces fit.

229
0:10:36.136,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Of course this is how Americans think.

230
0:10:38.044,000 --> 0:10:41,000
So people all over the Middle East, not just in your country,

231
0:10:41.071,000 --> 0:10:42,000
are protesting.

232
0:10:42.251,000 --> 0:10:43,000
"He wants to burn Qurans, our holy book.

233
0:10:44.206,000 --> 0:10:46,000
These Christians -- who are these Christians?

234
0:10:46.358,000 --> 0:10:49,000
They're so evil, they're so mean -- this is what they're about?"

235
0:10:49.797,000 --> 0:10:51,000
This is what you're thinking as an Arab Muslim,

236
0:10:52.436,000 --> 0:10:53,000
as an Iraqi.

237
0:10:53.869,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Of course you're going to think this.

238
0:10:55.87,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And then your cousin says, "Hey coz, check out this website.

239
0:10:59.818,000 --> 0:11:01,000
You've got to see this -- Bible Boot Camp.

240
0:11:02.116,000 --> 0:11:03,000
These Christians are nuts!

241
0:11:03.418,000 --> 0:11:05,000
They're training their little kids to be soldiers for Jesus.

242
0:11:06.309,000 --> 0:11:08,000
They take little kids and run them through these things

243
0:11:08.918,000 --> 0:11:1,000
till they teach them how to say, 'Sir! Yes, sir!'

244
0:11:11.244,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and things like 'grenade toss' and 'weapons care and maintenance.'

245
0:11:14.38,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And go to the website -- it says 'US Army' right on it.

246
0:11:17.436,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I mean, these Christians, they're nuts.

247
0:11:19.37,000 --> 0:11:21,000
How can they do this to their little kids?"

248
0:11:21.404,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And you're reading this website.

249
0:11:22.959,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And of course, Christians in the United States, or anybody,

250
0:11:25.804,000 --> 0:11:27,000
says, "This is some little church in the middle of nowhere."

251
0:11:28.709,000 --> 0:11:29,000
You don't know that.

252
0:11:29.884,000 --> 0:11:31,000
For you, this is like, all Christians.

253
0:11:32.317,000 --> 0:11:34,000
It's all over the Web: "Bible Boot Camp."

254
0:11:34.643,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And look at this.

255
0:11:36.417,000 --> 0:11:37,000
They even teach their kids --

256
0:11:37.836,000 --> 0:11:39,000
they train them in the same way the US Marines train.

257
0:11:41.167,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Isn't that interesting.

258
0:11:42.658,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And it scares you, and it frightens you.

259
0:11:44.96,000 --> 0:11:45,000
So these guys, you see them.

260
0:11:46.96,000 --> 0:11:49,000
You see, I, Sam Richards -- I know who these guys are.

261
0:11:50.168,000 --> 0:11:52,000
They're my students, my friends; I know what they're thinking.

262
0:11:53.125,000 --> 0:11:54,000
You don't know.

263
0:11:54.357,000 --> 0:11:56,000
When you see them, they're something else.

264
0:11:57.686,000 --> 0:11:58,000
They're something else.

265
0:11:59.39,000 --> 0:12:,000
That's what they are to you.

266
0:12:02.168,000 --> 0:12:04,000
We don't see it that way in the United States,

267
0:12:04.659,000 --> 0:12:05,000
but you see it that way.

268
0:12:09.96,000 --> 0:12:1,000
So here.

269
0:12:11.761,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Of course, you've got it wrong.

270
0:12:13.817,000 --> 0:12:15,000
You're generalizing. It's wrong.

271
0:12:16.324,000 --> 0:12:18,000
You don't understand the Americans.

272
0:12:18.635,000 --> 0:12:19,000
It's not a Christian invasion.

273
0:12:20.339,000 --> 0:12:22,000
We're not just there for oil; we're there for lots of reasons.

274
0:12:23.336,000 --> 0:12:25,000
You have it wrong. You've missed it.

275
0:12:25.373,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And of course, most of you don't support the insurgency;

276
0:12:28.174,000 --> 0:12:29,000
you don't support killing Americans;

277
0:12:29.956,000 --> 0:12:3,000
you don't support the terrorists.

278
0:12:31.96,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Of course you don't. Very few people do.

279
0:12:33.96,000 --> 0:12:35,000
But -- some of you do.

280
0:12:37.232,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And this is a perspective.

281
0:12:39.041,000 --> 0:12:41,000
OK. So now, here's what we're going to do.

282
0:12:41.797,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Step outside of your shoes that you're in right now,

283
0:12:45.782,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and step back into your normal shoes.

284
0:12:47.596,000 --> 0:12:48,000
So everyone's back in the room. OK?

285
0:12:50.525,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Now here comes the radical experiment.

286
0:12:52.45,000 --> 0:12:53,000
So we're all back home.

287
0:12:54.476,000 --> 0:12:56,000
This photo: this woman --

288
0:12:56.592,000 --> 0:12:57,000
man, I feel her.

289
0:12:58.489,000 --> 0:12:59,000
I feel her.

290
0:13:00.086,000 --> 0:13:01,000
She's my sister,

291
0:13:01.59,000 --> 0:13:04,000
my wife, my cousin, my neighbor.

292
0:13:04.798,000 --> 0:13:05,000
She's anybody to me.

293
0:13:06.218,000 --> 0:13:08,000
These guys standing there, everybody in the photo --

294
0:13:08.949,000 --> 0:13:09,000
I feel this photo, man.

295
0:13:12.092,000 --> 0:13:13,000
So here's what I want you to do.

296
0:13:13.751,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Let's go back to my first example, of the Chinese.

297
0:13:17.76,000 --> 0:13:18,000
I want you to go there.

298
0:13:19.606,000 --> 0:13:22,000
It's all about coal, and the Chinese are here in the United States.

299
0:13:22.86,000 --> 0:13:23,000
What I want you to do is picture her

300
0:13:24.63,000 --> 0:13:26,000
as a Chinese woman receiving a Chinese flag

301
0:13:27.582,000 --> 0:13:31,000
because her loved one has died in America in the coal uprising.

302
0:13:32.872,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And the soldiers are Chinese,

303
0:13:34.525,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and everybody else is Chinese.

304
0:13:36.88,000 --> 0:13:39,000
As an American, how do you feel about this picture?

305
0:13:42.19,000 --> 0:13:43,000
What do you think about that scene?

306
0:13:46.96,000 --> 0:13:48,000
OK, try this. Bring it back.

307
0:13:49.506,000 --> 0:13:5,000
This is the scene here.

308
0:13:50.96,000 --> 0:13:51,000
It's an American, American soldiers,

309
0:13:52.85,000 --> 0:13:55,000
American woman who lost her loved one in the Middle East,

310
0:13:55.929,000 --> 0:13:57,000
in Iraq or Afghanistan.

311
0:13:58.156,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Now, put yourself in the shoes,

312
0:14:00.156,000 --> 0:14:03,000
go back to the shoes of an Arab Muslim living in Iraq.

313
0:14:06.265,000 --> 0:14:1,000
What are you feeling and thinking about this photo,

314
0:14:11.087,000 --> 0:14:12,000
about this woman?

315
0:14:21.261,000 --> 0:14:22,000
OK,

316
0:14:22.96,000 --> 0:14:23,000
now follow me on this,

317
0:14:24.96,000 --> 0:14:26,000
because I'm taking a big risk here.

318
0:14:27.115,000 --> 0:14:29,000
And so I'm going to invite you to take a risk with me.

319
0:14:29.878,000 --> 0:14:3,000
These gentlemen here, they're insurgents.

320
0:14:31.879,000 --> 0:14:35,000
They were caught by the American soldiers, trying to kill Americans.

321
0:14:35.912,000 --> 0:14:38,000
And maybe they succeeded. Maybe they succeeded.

322
0:14:39.346,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Put yourself in the shoes of the Americans who caught them.

323
0:14:44.467,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Can you feel the rage?

324
0:14:46.571,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Can you feel that you just want to take these guys

325
0:14:48.977,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and wring their necks?

326
0:14:50.451,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Can you go there?

327
0:14:52.595,000 --> 0:14:53,000
It shouldn't be that difficult.

328
0:14:54.649,000 --> 0:14:56,000
You just -- oh, man.

329
0:14:58.534,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Now, put yourself in their shoes.

330
0:15:06.031,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Are they brutal killers

331
0:15:08.032,000 --> 0:15:09,000
or patriotic defenders?

332
0:15:11.961,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Which one?

333
0:15:13.751,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Can you feel their anger,

334
0:15:16.96,000 --> 0:15:17,000
their fear,

335
0:15:18.415,000 --> 0:15:19,000
their rage

336
0:15:21.084,000 --> 0:15:23,000
at what has happened in their country?

337
0:15:23.305,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Can you imagine that maybe one of them, in the morning,

338
0:15:27.732,000 --> 0:15:3,000
bent down to their child and hugged their child

339
0:15:30.888,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and said, "Dear, I'll be back later.

340
0:15:34.889,000 --> 0:15:37,000
I'm going out to defend your freedom, your lives.

341
0:15:38.242,000 --> 0:15:4,000
I'm going out to look out for us,

342
0:15:41.729,000 --> 0:15:42,000
the future of our country."

343
0:15:44.34,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Can you imagine that?

344
0:15:45.661,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Can you imagine saying that?

345
0:15:48.388,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Can you go there?

346
0:15:52.96,000 --> 0:15:53,000
What do you think they're feeling?

347
0:16:02.983,000 --> 0:16:03,000
You see, that's empathy.

348
0:16:05.142,000 --> 0:16:06,000
It's also understanding.

349
0:16:06.61,000 --> 0:16:07,000
[understand]

350
0:16:08.262,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Now, you might ask,

351
0:16:09.594,000 --> 0:16:12,000
"OK, Sam, so why do you do this sort of thing?

352
0:16:12.885,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Why would you use this example of all examples?"

353
0:16:15.269,000 --> 0:16:17,000
And I say, because.

354
0:16:17.96,000 --> 0:16:18,000
You're allowed to hate these people.

355
0:16:19.785,000 --> 0:16:24,000
You're allowed to just hate them with every fiber of your being.

356
0:16:24.96,000 --> 0:16:27,000
And if I can get you to step into their shoes

357
0:16:28.761,000 --> 0:16:31,000
and walk an inch -- one tiny inch --

358
0:16:33.14,000 --> 0:16:35,000
then imagine the kind of sociological analysis

359
0:16:35.878,000 --> 0:16:38,000
that you can do in all other aspects of your life.

360
0:16:40.528,000 --> 0:16:41,000
You can walk a mile

361
0:16:41.96,000 --> 0:16:46,000
when it comes to understanding why that person's driving 40 miles per hour

362
0:16:47.055,000 --> 0:16:48,000
in the passing lane;

363
0:16:49.253,000 --> 0:16:5,000
or your teenage son;

364
0:16:51.634,000 --> 0:16:54,000
or your neighbor who annoys you by cutting his lawn on Sunday mornings.

365
0:16:55.301,000 --> 0:16:57,000
Whatever it is, you can go so far.

366
0:16:58.761,000 --> 0:17:,000
And this is what I tell my students:

367
0:17:00.88,000 --> 0:17:03,000
step outside of your tiny, little world.

368
0:17:04.396,000 --> 0:17:08,000
Step inside of the tiny, little world of somebody else.

369
0:17:09.149,000 --> 0:17:1,000
And then do it again

370
0:17:10.614,000 --> 0:17:11,000
and do it again and do it again.

371
0:17:12.337,000 --> 0:17:14,000
And suddenly, all these tiny, little worlds,

372
0:17:14.47,000 --> 0:17:16,000
they come together in this complex web.

373
0:17:16.746,000 --> 0:17:19,000
And they build a big, complex world.

374
0:17:19.84,000 --> 0:17:21,000
And suddenly, without realizing it,

375
0:17:22.243,000 --> 0:17:24,000
you're seeing the world differently.

376
0:17:24.444,000 --> 0:17:25,000
Everything has changed.

377
0:17:26.231,000 --> 0:17:27,000
Everything in your life has changed.

378
0:17:29.081,000 --> 0:17:32,000
And that's, of course, what this is about.

379
0:17:32.178,000 --> 0:17:35,000
Attend to other lives,

380
0:17:35.324,000 --> 0:17:36,000
other visions.

381
0:17:36.706,000 --> 0:17:38,000
Listen to other people,

382
0:17:39.155,000 --> 0:17:4,000
enlighten ourselves.

383
0:17:41.769,000 --> 0:17:44,000
I'm not saying that I support the terrorists in Iraq.

384
0:17:46.039,000 --> 0:17:49,000
But as a sociologist, what I am saying is:

385
0:17:49.96,000 --> 0:17:51,000
I understand.

386
0:17:53.96,000 --> 0:17:57,000
And now perhaps -- perhaps -- you do, too.

387
0:17:58.212,000 --> 0:17:59,000
Thank you.

388
0:17:59.388,000 --> 0:18:01,000
(Applause)

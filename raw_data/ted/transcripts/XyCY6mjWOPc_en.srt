1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Cities are the crucible of civilization.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
They have been expanding,

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
urbanization has been expanding,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
at an exponential rate in the last 200 years

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
so that by the second part of this century,

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
the planet will be completely dominated

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
by cities.

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Cities are the origins of global warming,

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
impact on the environment,

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
health, pollution, disease,

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
finance,

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
economies, energy --

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
they're all problems

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that are confronted by having cities.

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
That's where all these problems come from.

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And the tsunami of problems that we feel we're facing

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
in terms of sustainability questions

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
are actually a reflection

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
of the exponential increase

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
in urbanization across the planet.

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Here's some numbers.

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Two hundred years ago, the United States

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
was less than a few percent urbanized.

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
It's now more than 82 percent.

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
The planet has crossed the halfway mark a few years ago.

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
China's building 300 new cities

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
in the next 20 years.

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Now listen to this:

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Every week for the foreseeable future,

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
until 2050,

31
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
every week more than a million people

32
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
are being added to our cities.

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
This is going to affect everything.

34
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Everybody in this room, if you stay alive,

35
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
is going to be affected

36
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
by what's happening in cities

37
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
in this extraordinary phenomenon.

38
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
However, cities,

39
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
despite having this negative aspect to them,

40
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
are also the solution.

41
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Because cities are the vacuum cleaners and the magnets

42
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
that have sucked up creative people,

43
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
creating ideas, innovation,

44
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
wealth and so on.

45
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
So we have this kind of dual nature.

46
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And so there's an urgent need

47
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
for a scientific theory of cities.

48
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Now these are my comrades in arms.

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
This work has been done with an extraordinary group of people,

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and they've done all the work,

51
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and I'm the great bullshitter

52
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that tries to bring it all together.

53
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So here's the problem: This is what we all want.

55
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
The 10 billion people on the planet in 2050

56
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
want to live in places like this,

57
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
having things like this,

58
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
doing things like this,

59
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
with economies that are growing like this,

60
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
not realizing that entropy

61
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
produces things like this,

62
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
this, this

63
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and this.

64
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And the question is:

65
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Is that what Edinburgh and London and New York

66
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
are going to look like in 2050,

67
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
or is it going to be this?

68
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
That's the question.

69
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I must say, many of the indicators

70
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
look like this is what it's going to look like,

71
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
but let's talk about it.

72
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So my provocative statement

73
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
is that we desperately need a serious scientific theory of cities.

74
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And scientific theory means quantifiable --

75
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
relying on underlying generic principles

76
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that can be made into a predictive framework.

77
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
That's the quest.

78
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Is that conceivable?

79
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Are there universal laws?

80
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
So here's two questions

81
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
that I have in my head when I think about this problem.

82
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
The first is:

83
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Are cities part of biology?

84
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Is London a great big whale?

85
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Is Edinburgh a horse?

86
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Is Microsoft a great big anthill?

87
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
What do we learn from that?

88
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
We use them metaphorically --

89
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
the DNA of a company, the metabolism of a city, and so on --

90
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
is that just bullshit, metaphorical bullshit,

91
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
or is there serious substance to it?

92
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And if that is the case,

93
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
how come that it's very hard to kill a city?

94
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
You could drop an atom bomb on a city,

95
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and 30 years later it's surviving.

96
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Very few cities fail.

97
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
All companies die, all companies.

98
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And if you have a serious theory, you should be able to predict

99
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
when Google is going to go bust.

100
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So is that just another version

101
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
of this?

102
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Well we understand this very well.

103
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
That is, you ask any generic question about this --

104
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
how many trees of a given size,

105
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
how many branches of a given size does a tree have,

106
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
how many leaves,

107
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
what is the energy flowing through each branch,

108
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
what is the size of the canopy,

109
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
what is its growth, what is its mortality?

110
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
We have a mathematical framework

111
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
based on generic universal principles

112
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that can answer those questions.

113
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And the idea is can we do the same for this?

114
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So the route in is recognizing

115
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
one of the most extraordinary things about life,

116
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
is that it is scalable,

117
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
it works over an extraordinary range.

118
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
This is just a tiny range actually:

119
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
It's us mammals;

120
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
we're one of these.

121
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
The same principles, the same dynamics,

122
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
the same organization is at work

123
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
in all of these, including us,

124
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and it can scale over a range of 100 million in size.

125
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And that is one of the main reasons

126
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
life is so resilient and robust --

127
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
scalability.

128
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
We're going to discuss that in a moment more.

129
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
But you know, at a local level,

130
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
you scale; everybody in this room is scaled.

131
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
That's called growth.

132
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Here's how you grew.

133
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Rat, that's a rat -- could have been you.

134
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
We're all pretty much the same.

135
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And you see, you're very familiar with this.

136
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
You grow very quickly and then you stop.

137
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And that line there

138
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
is a prediction from the same theory,

139
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
based on the same principles,

140
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
that describes that forest.

141
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And here it is for the growth of a rat,

142
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and those points on there are data points.

143
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
This is just the weight versus the age.

144
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And you see, it stops growing.

145
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Very, very good for biology --

146
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
also one of the reasons for its great resilience.

147
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Very, very bad

148
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
for economies and companies and cities

149
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
in our present paradigm.

150
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
This is what we believe.

151
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
This is what our whole economy

152
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
is thrusting upon us,

153
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
particularly illustrated in that left-hand corner:

154
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
hockey sticks.

155
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
This is a bunch of software companies --

156
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and what it is is their revenue versus their age --

157
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
all zooming away,

158
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and everybody making millions and billions of dollars.

159
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Okay, so how do we understand this?

160
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So let's first talk about biology.

161
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
This is explicitly showing you

162
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
how things scale,

163
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and this is a truly remarkable graph.

164
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
What is plotted here is metabolic rate --

165
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
how much energy you need per day to stay alive --

166
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
versus your weight, your mass,

167
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
for all of us bunch of organisms.

168
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And it's plotted in this funny way by going up by factors of 10,

169
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
otherwise you couldn't get everything on the graph.

170
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And what you see if you plot it

171
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
in this slightly curious way

172
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
is that everybody lies on the same line.

173
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Despite the fact that this is the most complex and diverse system

174
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
in the universe,

175
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
there's an extraordinary simplicity

176
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
being expressed by this.

177
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
It's particularly astonishing

178
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
because each one of these organisms,

179
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
each subsystem, each cell type, each gene,

180
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
has evolved in its own unique environmental niche

181
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
with its own unique history.

182
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And yet, despite all of that Darwinian evolution

183
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and natural selection,

184
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
they've been constrained to lie on a line.

185
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Something else is going on.

186
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Before I talk about that,

187
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I've written down at the bottom there

188
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
the slope of this curve, this straight line.

189
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
It's three-quarters, roughly,

190
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
which is less than one -- and we call that sublinear.

191
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And here's the point of that.

192
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
It says that, if it were linear,

193
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
the steepest slope,

194
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
then doubling the size

195
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
you would require double the amount of energy.

196
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
But it's sublinear, and what that translates into

197
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
is that, if you double the size of the organism,

198
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
you actually only need 75 percent more energy.

199
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
So a wonderful thing about all of biology

200
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
is that it expresses an extraordinary economy of scale.

201
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
The bigger you are systematically,

202
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
according to very well-defined rules,

203
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
less energy per capita.

204
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Now any physiological variable you can think of,

205
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
any life history event you can think of,

206
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
if you plot it this way, looks like this.

207
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
There is an extraordinary regularity.

208
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So you tell me the size of a mammal,

209
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I can tell you at the 90 percent level everything about it

210
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
in terms of its physiology, life history, etc.

211
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And the reason for this is because of networks.

212
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
All of life is controlled by networks --

213
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
from the intracellular through the multicellular

214
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
through the ecosystem level.

215
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And you're very familiar with these networks.

216
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
That's a little thing that lives inside an elephant.

217
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And here's the summary of what I'm saying.

218
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
If you take those networks,

219
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
this idea of networks,

220
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and you apply universal principles,

221
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
mathematizable, universal principles,

222
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
all of these scalings

223
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and all of these constraints follow,

224
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
including the description of the forest,

225
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
the description of your circulatory system,

226
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
the description within cells.

227
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
One of the things I did not stress in that introduction

228
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
was that, systematically, the pace of life

229
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
decreases as you get bigger.

230
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Heart rates are slower; you live longer;

231
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
diffusion of oxygen and resources

232
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
across membranes is slower, etc.

233
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
The question is: Is any of this true

234
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
for cities and companies?

235
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
So is London a scaled up Birmingham,

236
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
which is a scaled up Brighton, etc., etc.?

237
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Is New York a scaled up San Francisco,

238
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
which is a scaled up Santa Fe?

239
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Don't know. We will discuss that.

240
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
But they are networks,

241
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and the most important network of cities

242
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
is you.

243
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Cities are just a physical manifestation

244
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
of your interactions,

245
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
our interactions,

246
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and the clustering and grouping of individuals.

247
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Here's just a symbolic picture of that.

248
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And here's scaling of cities.

249
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
This shows that in this very simple example,

250
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
which happens to be a mundane example

251
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
of number of petrol stations

252
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
as a function of size --

253
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
plotted in the same way as the biology --

254
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
you see exactly the same kind of thing.

255
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
There is a scaling.

256
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
That is that the number of petrol stations in the city

257
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
is now given to you

258
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
when you tell me its size.

259
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
The slope of that is less than linear.

260
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
There is an economy of scale.

261
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Less petrol stations per capita the bigger you are -- not surprising.

262
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
But here's what's surprising.

263
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
It scales in the same way everywhere.

264
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
This is just European countries,

265
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
but you do it in Japan or China or Colombia,

266
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
always the same

267
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
with the same kind of economy of scale

268
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
to the same degree.

269
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And any infrastructure you look at --

270
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
whether it's the length of roads, length of electrical lines --

271
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
anything you look at

272
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
has the same economy of scale scaling in the same way.

273
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
It's an integrated system

274
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
that has evolved despite all the planning and so on.

275
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
But even more surprising

276
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
is if you look at socio-economic quantities,

277
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
quantities that have no analog in biology,

278
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
that have evolved when we started forming communities

279
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
eight to 10,000 years ago.

280
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
The top one is wages as a function of size

281
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
plotted in the same way.

282
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And the bottom one is you lot --

283
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
super-creatives plotted in the same way.

284
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And what you see

285
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
is a scaling phenomenon.

286
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
But most important in this,

287
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
the exponent, the analog to that three-quarters

288
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
for the metabolic rate,

289
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
is bigger than one -- it's about 1.15 to 1.2.

290
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Here it is,

291
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
which says that the bigger you are

292
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
the more you have per capita, unlike biology --

293
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
higher wages, more super-creative people per capita as you get bigger,

294
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
more patents per capita, more crime per capita.

295
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And we've looked at everything:

296
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
more AIDS cases, flu, etc.

297
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And here, they're all plotted together.

298
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Just to show you what we plotted,

299
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
here is income, GDP --

300
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
GDP of the city --

301
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
crime and patents all on one graph.

302
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And you can see, they all follow the same line.

303
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And here's the statement.

304
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
If you double the size of a city from 100,000 to 200,000,

305
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
from a million to two million, 10 to 20 million,

306
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
it doesn't matter,

307
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
then systematically

308
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
you get a 15 percent increase

309
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
in wages, wealth, number of AIDS cases,

310
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
number of police,

311
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
anything you can think of.

312
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
It goes up by 15 percent,

313
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and you have a 15 percent savings

314
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
on the infrastructure.

315
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
This, no doubt, is the reason

316
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
why a million people a week are gathering in cities.

317
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Because they think that all those wonderful things --

318
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
like creative people, wealth, income --

319
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
is what attracts them,

320
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
forgetting about the ugly and the bad.

321
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
What is the reason for this?

322
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Well I don't have time to tell you about all the mathematics,

323
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
but underlying this is the social networks,

324
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
because this is a universal phenomenon.

325
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
This 15 percent rule

326
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
is true

327
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
no matter where you are on the planet --

328
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Japan, Chile,

329
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Portugal, Scotland, doesn't matter.

330
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Always, all the data shows it's the same,

331
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
despite the fact that these cities have evolved independently.

332
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Something universal is going on.

333
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
The universality, to repeat, is us --

334
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
that we are the city.

335
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And it is our interactions and the clustering of those interactions.

336
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
So there it is, I've said it again.

337
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
So if it is those networks and their mathematical structure,

338
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
unlike biology, which had sublinear scaling,

339
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
economies of scale,

340
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
you had the slowing of the pace of life

341
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
as you get bigger.

342
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
If it's social networks with super-linear scaling --

343
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
more per capita --

344
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
then the theory says

345
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
that you increase the pace of life.

346
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
The bigger you are, life gets faster.

347
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
On the left is the heart rate showing biology.

348
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
On the right is the speed of walking

349
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
in a bunch of European cities,

350
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
showing that increase.

351
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
Lastly, I want to talk about growth.

352
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
This is what we had in biology, just to repeat.

353
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Economies of scale

354
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
gave rise to this sigmoidal behavior.

355
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
You grow fast and then stop --

356
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
part of our resilience.

357
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
That would be bad for economies and cities.

358
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And indeed, one of the wonderful things about the theory

359
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
is that if you have super-linear scaling

360
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
from wealth creation and innovation,

361
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
then indeed you get, from the same theory,

362
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
a beautiful rising exponential curve -- lovely.

363
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And in fact, if you compare it to data,

364
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
it fits very well

365
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
with the development of cities and economies.

366
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
But it has a terrible catch,

367
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and the catch

368
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
is that this system is destined to collapse.

369
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And it's destined to collapse for many reasons --

370
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
kind of Malthusian reasons -- that you run out of resources.

371
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And how do you avoid that? Well we've done it before.

372
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
What we do is,

373
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
as we grow and we approach the collapse,

374
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
a major innovation takes place

375
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
and we start over again,

376
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and we start over again as we approach the next one, and so on.

377
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
So there's this continuous cycle of innovation

378
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
that is necessary

379
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
in order to sustain growth and avoid collapse.

380
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
The catch, however, to this

381
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
is that you have to innovate

382
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
faster and faster and faster.

383
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
So the image

384
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
is that we're not only on a treadmill that's going faster,

385
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
but we have to change the treadmill faster and faster.

386
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
We have to accelerate on a continuous basis.

387
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And the question is: Can we, as socio-economic beings,

388
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
avoid a heart attack?

389
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
So lastly, I'm going to finish up in this last minute or two

390
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
asking about companies.

391
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
See companies, they scale.

392
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
The top one, in fact, is Walmart on the right.

393
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
It's the same plot.

394
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
This happens to be income and assets

395
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
versus the size of the company as denoted by its number of employees.

396
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
We could use sales, anything you like.

397
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
There it is: after some little fluctuations at the beginning,

398
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
when companies are innovating,

399
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
they scale beautifully.

400
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
And we've looked at 23,000 companies

401
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
in the United States, may I say.

402
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
And I'm only showing you a little bit of this.

403
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
What is astonishing about companies

404
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
is that they scale sublinearly

405
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
like biology,

406
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
indicating that they're dominated,

407
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
not by super-linear

408
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
innovation and ideas;

409
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
they become dominated

410
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
by economies of scale.

411
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
In that interpretation,

412
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
by bureaucracy and administration,

413
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
and they do it beautifully, may I say.

414
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
So if you tell me the size of some company, some small company,

415
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
I could have predicted the size of Walmart.

416
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
If it has this sublinear scaling,

417
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
the theory says

418
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
we should have sigmoidal growth.

419
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
There's Walmart. Doesn't look very sigmoidal.

420
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
That's what we like, hockey sticks.

421
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
But you notice, I've cheated,

422
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
because I've only gone up to '94.

423
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
Let's go up to 2008.

424
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
That red line is from the theory.

425
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
So if I'd have done this in 1994,

426
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
I could have predicted what Walmart would be now.

427
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
And then this is repeated

428
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
across the entire spectrum of companies.

429
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
There they are. That's 23,000 companies.

430
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
They all start looking like hockey sticks,

431
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
they all bend over,

432
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
and they all die like you and me.

433
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
Thank you.

434
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
(Applause)

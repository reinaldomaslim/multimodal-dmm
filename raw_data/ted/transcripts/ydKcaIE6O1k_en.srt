1
0:00:13.395,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I'd like to start with a simple question:

2
0:00:17.82,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Why do the poor make so many poor decisions?

3
0:00:23.672,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I know it's a harsh question,

4
0:00:25.247,000 --> 0:00:26,000
but take a look at the data.

5
0:00:27.236,000 --> 0:00:28,000
The poor borrow more, save less,

6
0:00:29.103,000 --> 0:00:31,000
smoke more, exercise less, drink more

7
0:00:31.786,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and eat less healthfully.

8
0:00:34.192,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Why?

9
0:00:36.271,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Well, the standard explanation

10
0:00:37.822,000 --> 0:00:4,000
was once summed up by the British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.

11
0:00:41.226,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And she called poverty "a personality defect."

12
0:00:44.635,000 --> 0:00:45,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:46.499,000 --> 0:00:47,000
A lack of character, basically.

14
0:00:49.285,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Now, I'm sure not many of you would be so blunt.

15
0:00:54.317,000 --> 0:00:57,000
But the idea that there's something wrong with the poor themselves

16
0:00:58.191,000 --> 0:00:59,000
is not restricted to Mrs. Thatcher.

17
0:01:01.105,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Some of you may believe that the poor should be held responsible

18
0:01:04.332,000 --> 0:01:05,000
for their own mistakes.

19
0:01:06.109,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And others may argue that we should help them to make better decisions.

20
0:01:10.674,000 --> 0:01:13,000
But the underlying assumption is the same:

21
0:01:14.47,000 --> 0:01:16,000
there's something wrong with them.

22
0:01:17.877,000 --> 0:01:18,000
If we could just change them,

23
0:01:19.759,000 --> 0:01:21,000
if we could just teach them how to live their lives,

24
0:01:22.275,000 --> 0:01:23,000
if they would only listen.

25
0:01:25.053,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And to be honest,

26
0:01:26.774,000 --> 0:01:29,000
this was what I thought for a long time.

27
0:01:30.898,000 --> 0:01:32,000
It was only a few years ago that I discovered

28
0:01:33.036,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that everything I thought I knew about poverty was wrong.

29
0:01:38.106,000 --> 0:01:4,000
It all started when I accidentally stumbled upon a paper

30
0:01:40.781,000 --> 0:01:41,000
by a few American psychologists.

31
0:01:42.413,000 --> 0:01:44,000
They had traveled 8,000 miles, all the way to India,

32
0:01:44.99,000 --> 0:01:45,000
for a fascinating study.

33
0:01:47.065,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And it was an experiment with sugarcane farmers.

34
0:01:50.658,000 --> 0:01:53,000
You should know that these farmers collect about 60 percent

35
0:01:54.03,000 --> 0:01:56,000
of their annual income all at once,

36
0:01:56.187,000 --> 0:01:57,000
right after the harvest.

37
0:01:57.919,000 --> 0:02:,000
This means that they're relatively poor one part of the year

38
0:02:01.483,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and rich the other.

39
0:02:04.415,000 --> 0:02:08,000
The researchers asked them to do an IQ test before and after the harvest.

40
0:02:09.722,000 --> 0:02:13,000
What they subsequently discovered completely blew my mind.

41
0:02:14.979,000 --> 0:02:18,000
The farmers scored much worse on the test before the harvest.

42
0:02:20.277,000 --> 0:02:22,000
The effects of living in poverty, it turns out,

43
0:02:22.601,000 --> 0:02:25,000
correspond to losing 14 points of IQ.

44
0:02:25.993,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Now, to give you an idea,

45
0:02:27.886,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that's comparable to losing a night's sleep

46
0:02:30.351,000 --> 0:02:32,000
or the effects of alcoholism.

47
0:02:34.505,000 --> 0:02:36,000
A few months later, I heard that Eldar Shafir,

48
0:02:36.788,000 --> 0:02:39,000
a professor at Princeton University and one of the authors of this study,

49
0:02:40.359,000 --> 0:02:42,000
was coming over to Holland, where I live.

50
0:02:42.702,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So we met up in Amsterdam

51
0:02:44.128,000 --> 0:02:47,000
to talk about his revolutionary new theory of poverty.

52
0:02:48.21,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And I can sum it up in just two words:

53
0:02:51.235,000 --> 0:02:53,000
scarcity mentality.

54
0:02:54.467,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It turns out that people behave differently

55
0:02:56.645,000 --> 0:02:58,000
when they perceive a thing to be scarce.

56
0:02:59.155,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And what that thing is doesn't much matter --

57
0:03:01.394,000 --> 0:03:04,000
whether it's not enough time, money or food.

58
0:03:04.9,000 --> 0:03:05,000
You all know this feeling,

59
0:03:06.582,000 --> 0:03:07,000
when you've got too much to do,

60
0:03:08.569,000 --> 0:03:1,000
or when you've put off breaking for lunch

61
0:03:10.609,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and your blood sugar takes a dive.

62
0:03:12.296,000 --> 0:03:14,000
This narrows your focus to your immediate lack --

63
0:03:15.148,000 --> 0:03:17,000
to the sandwich you've got to have now,

64
0:03:17.182,000 --> 0:03:19,000
the meeting that's starting in five minutes

65
0:03:19.468,000 --> 0:03:21,000
or the bills that have to be paid tomorrow.

66
0:03:22.868,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So the long-term perspective goes out the window.

67
0:03:27.655,000 --> 0:03:29,000
You could compare it to a new computer

68
0:03:30.21,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that's running 10 heavy programs at once.

69
0:03:33.021,000 --> 0:03:35,000
It gets slower and slower, making errors.

70
0:03:35.818,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Eventually, it freezes --

71
0:03:37.664,000 --> 0:03:39,000
not because it's a bad computer,

72
0:03:39.794,000 --> 0:03:41,000
but because it has too much to do at once.

73
0:03:43.279,000 --> 0:03:45,000
The poor have the same problem.

74
0:03:46.654,000 --> 0:03:48,000
They're not making dumb decisions because they are dumb,

75
0:03:49.468,000 --> 0:03:5,000
but because they're living in a context

76
0:03:51.414,000 --> 0:03:53,000
in which anyone would make dumb decisions.

77
0:03:54.362,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So suddenly I understood

78
0:03:57.334,000 --> 0:04:,000
why so many of our anti-poverty programs don't work.

79
0:04:02.467,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Investments in education, for example, are often completely ineffective.

80
0:04:07.015,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Poverty is not a lack of knowledge.

81
0:04:10.58,000 --> 0:04:12,000
A recent analysis of 201 studies

82
0:04:13.159,000 --> 0:04:15,000
on the effectiveness of money-management training

83
0:04:15.495,000 --> 0:04:18,000
came to the conclusion that it has almost no effect at all.

84
0:04:19.268,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Now, don't get me wrong --

85
0:04:20.737,000 --> 0:04:22,000
this is not to say the poor don't learn anything --

86
0:04:23.257,000 --> 0:04:24,000
they can come out wiser for sure.

87
0:04:25.832,000 --> 0:04:26,000
But it's not enough.

88
0:04:27.494,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Or as Professor Shafir told me,

89
0:04:30.52,000 --> 0:04:31,000
"It's like teaching someone to swim

90
0:04:32.528,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and then throwing them in a stormy sea."

91
0:04:36.508,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I still remember sitting there,

92
0:04:39.023,000 --> 0:04:4,000
perplexed.

93
0:04:41.111,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And it struck me

94
0:04:42.292,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that we could have figured this all out decades ago.

95
0:04:44.829,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I mean, these psychologists didn't need any complicated brain scans;

96
0:04:48.104,000 --> 0:04:5,000
they only had to measure the farmer's IQ,

97
0:04:50.137,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and IQ tests were invented more than 100 years ago.

98
0:04:53.039,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Actually, I realized I had read about the psychology of poverty before.

99
0:04:57.367,000 --> 0:05:,000
George Orwell, one of the greatest writers who ever lived,

100
0:05:01.065,000 --> 0:05:03,000
experienced poverty firsthand in the 1920s.

101
0:05:04.676,000 --> 0:05:06,000
"The essence of poverty," he wrote back then,

102
0:05:06.878,000 --> 0:05:08,000
is that it "annihilates the future."

103
0:05:10.967,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And he marveled at, quote,

104
0:05:13.746,000 --> 0:05:16,000
"How people take it for granted they have the right to preach at you

105
0:05:17.056,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and pray over you

106
0:05:18.231,000 --> 0:05:2,000
as soon as your income falls below a certain level."

107
0:05:20.727,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Now, those words are every bit as resonant today.

108
0:05:26.965,000 --> 0:05:27,000
The big question is, of course:

109
0:05:28.97,000 --> 0:05:29,000
What can be done?

110
0:05:30.334,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Modern economists have a few solutions up their sleeves.

111
0:05:33.153,000 --> 0:05:35,000
We could help the poor with their paperwork

112
0:05:35.236,000 --> 0:05:37,000
or send them a text message to remind them to pay their bills.

113
0:05:38.242,000 --> 0:05:42,000
This type of solution is hugely popular with modern politicians,

114
0:05:42.973,000 --> 0:05:43,000
mostly because,

115
0:05:44.7,000 --> 0:05:46,000
well, they cost next to nothing.

116
0:05:47.955,000 --> 0:05:51,000
These solutions are, I think, a symbol of this era

117
0:05:51.989,000 --> 0:05:53,000
in which we so often treat the symptoms,

118
0:05:54.19,000 --> 0:05:55,000
but ignore the underlying cause.

119
0:05:57.494,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So I wonder:

120
0:05:59.606,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Why don't we just change the context in which the poor live?

121
0:06:03.545,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Or, going back to our computer analogy:

122
0:06:05.694,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Why keep tinkering around with the software

123
0:06:07.855,000 --> 0:06:11,000
when we can easily solve the problem by installing some extra memory instead?

124
0:06:11.944,000 --> 0:06:14,000
At that point, Professor Shafir responded with a blank look.

125
0:06:16.112,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And after a few seconds, he said,

126
0:06:18.742,000 --> 0:06:2,000
"Oh, I get it.

127
0:06:21.48,000 --> 0:06:24,000
You mean you want to just hand out more money to the poor

128
0:06:25.964,000 --> 0:06:26,000
to eradicate poverty.

129
0:06:27.839,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Uh, sure, that'd be great.

130
0:06:31.734,000 --> 0:06:33,000
But I'm afraid that brand of left-wing politics

131
0:06:34.059,000 --> 0:06:35,000
you've got in Amsterdam --

132
0:06:35.927,000 --> 0:06:36,000
it doesn't exist in the States."

133
0:06:38.342,000 --> 0:06:41,000
But is this really an old-fashioned, leftist idea?

134
0:06:43.214,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I remembered reading about an old plan --

135
0:06:45.225,000 --> 0:06:48,000
something that has been proposed by some of history's leading thinkers.

136
0:06:48.733,000 --> 0:06:51,000
The philosopher Thomas More first hinted at it in his book, "Utopia,"

137
0:06:52.573,000 --> 0:06:53,000
more than 500 years ago.

138
0:06:55.025,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And its proponents have spanned the spectrum from the left to the right,

139
0:06:58.599,000 --> 0:07:,000
from the civil rights campaigner, Martin Luther King,

140
0:07:01.393,000 --> 0:07:03,000
to the economist Milton Friedman.

141
0:07:05.093,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And it's an incredibly simple idea:

142
0:07:09.063,000 --> 0:07:11,000
basic income guarantee.

143
0:07:13.285,000 --> 0:07:14,000
What it is?

144
0:07:14.824,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Well, that's easy.

145
0:07:16.547,000 --> 0:07:18,000
It's a monthly grant, enough to pay for your basic needs:

146
0:07:19.302,000 --> 0:07:2,000
food, shelter, education.

147
0:07:21.503,000 --> 0:07:22,000
It's completely unconditional,

148
0:07:23.348,000 --> 0:07:25,000
so no one's going to tell you what you have to do for it,

149
0:07:26.132,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and no one's going to tell you what you have to do with it.

150
0:07:28.974,000 --> 0:07:3,000
The basic income is not a favor, but a right.

151
0:07:31.288,000 --> 0:07:33,000
There's absolutely no stigma attached.

152
0:07:34.192,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So as I learned about the true nature of poverty,

153
0:07:36.846,000 --> 0:07:37,000
I couldn't stop wondering:

154
0:07:39.028,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Is this the idea we've all been waiting for?

155
0:07:42.518,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Could it really be that simple?

156
0:07:46.168,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And in the three years that followed,

157
0:07:47.992,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I read everything I could find about basic income.

158
0:07:50.554,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I researched the dozens of experiments

159
0:07:52.515,000 --> 0:07:54,000
that have been conducted all over the globe,

160
0:07:54.66,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and it didn't take long before I stumbled upon a story of a town

161
0:07:57.752,000 --> 0:07:59,000
that had done it -- had actually eradicated poverty.

162
0:08:00.248,000 --> 0:08:01,000
But then ...

163
0:08:02.298,000 --> 0:08:03,000
nearly everyone forgot about it.

164
0:08:05.406,000 --> 0:08:07,000
This story starts in Dauphin, Canada.

165
0:08:08.871,000 --> 0:08:13,000
In 1974, everybody in this small town was guaranteed a basic income,

166
0:08:14.475,000 --> 0:08:16,000
ensuring that no one fell below the poverty line.

167
0:08:17.234,000 --> 0:08:18,000
At the start of the experiment,

168
0:08:18.854,000 --> 0:08:21,000
an army of researchers descended on the town.

169
0:08:23.187,000 --> 0:08:25,000
For four years, all went well.

170
0:08:26.331,000 --> 0:08:29,000
But then a new government was voted into power,

171
0:08:29.787,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and the new Canadian cabinet saw little point to the expensive experiment.

172
0:08:33.321,000 --> 0:08:37,000
So when it became clear there was no money left to analyze the results,

173
0:08:37.598,000 --> 0:08:41,000
the researchers decided to pack their files away in some 2,000 boxes.

174
0:08:43.995,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Twenty-five years went by,

175
0:08:46.809,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and then Evelyn Forget, a Canadian professor,

176
0:08:49.521,000 --> 0:08:5,000
found the records.

177
0:08:50.761,000 --> 0:08:53,000
For three years, she subjected the data to all manner of statistical analysis,

178
0:08:54.752,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and no matter what she tried,

179
0:08:56.362,000 --> 0:08:58,000
the results were the same every time:

180
0:08:59.788,000 --> 0:09:02,000
the experiment had been a resounding success.

181
0:09:05.131,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Evelyn Forget discovered

182
0:09:06.315,000 --> 0:09:08,000
that the people in Dauphin had not only become richer

183
0:09:08.923,000 --> 0:09:09,000
but also smarter and healthier.

184
0:09:10.478,000 --> 0:09:13,000
The school performance of kids improved substantially.

185
0:09:14.976,000 --> 0:09:18,000
The hospitalization rate decreased by as much as 8.5 percent.

186
0:09:19.942,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Domestic violence incidents were down,

187
0:09:21.776,000 --> 0:09:22,000
as were mental health complaints.

188
0:09:23.973,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And people didn't quit their jobs.

189
0:09:26.329,000 --> 0:09:29,000
The only ones who worked a little less were new mothers and students --

190
0:09:30.087,000 --> 0:09:31,000
who stayed in school longer.

191
0:09:32.708,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Similar results have since been found

192
0:09:34.607,000 --> 0:09:36,000
in countless other experiments around the globe,

193
0:09:37.027,000 --> 0:09:39,000
from the US to India.

194
0:09:41.433,000 --> 0:09:42,000
So ...

195
0:09:43.5,000 --> 0:09:44,000
here's what I've learned.

196
0:09:45.815,000 --> 0:09:47,000
When it comes to poverty,

197
0:09:47.995,000 --> 0:09:52,000
we, the rich, should stop pretending we know best.

198
0:09:54.031,000 --> 0:09:56,000
We should stop sending shoes and teddy bears to the poor,

199
0:09:56.809,000 --> 0:09:57,000
to people we have never met.

200
0:09:58.354,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And we should get rid of the vast industry of paternalistic bureaucrats

201
0:10:01.911,000 --> 0:10:03,000
when we could simply hand over their salaries

202
0:10:04.116,000 --> 0:10:05,000
to the poor they're supposed to help.

203
0:10:05.946,000 --> 0:10:07,000
(Applause)

204
0:10:08.266,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Because, I mean, the great thing about money

205
0:10:11.163,000 --> 0:10:13,000
is that people can use it to buy things they need

206
0:10:13.538,000 --> 0:10:16,000
instead of things that self-appointed experts think they need.

207
0:10:17.702,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Just imagine how many brilliant scientists and entrepreneurs and writers,

208
0:10:22.13,000 --> 0:10:23,000
like George Orwell,

209
0:10:23.305,000 --> 0:10:25,000
are now withering away in scarcity.

210
0:10:26.119,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Imagine how much energy and talent we would unleash

211
0:10:28.599,000 --> 0:10:3,000
if we got rid of poverty once and for all.

212
0:10:31.362,000 --> 0:10:35,000
I believe that a basic income would work like venture capital for the people.

213
0:10:36.913,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And we can't afford not to do it,

214
0:10:38.981,000 --> 0:10:4,000
because poverty is hugely expensive.

215
0:10:42.366,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Just look at the cost of child poverty in the US, for example.

216
0:10:45.782,000 --> 0:10:49,000
It's estimated at 500 billion dollars each year,

217
0:10:50.038,000 --> 0:10:52,000
in terms of higher health care spending, higher dropout rates,

218
0:10:53.01,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and more crime.

219
0:10:54.417,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Now, this is an incredible waste of human potential.

220
0:11:00.185,000 --> 0:11:02,000
But let's talk about the elephant in the room.

221
0:11:03.146,000 --> 0:11:06,000
How could we ever afford a basic income guarantee?

222
0:11:06.872,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Well, it's actually a lot cheaper than you may think.

223
0:11:09.995,000 --> 0:11:12,000
What they did in Dauphin is finance it with a negative income tax.

224
0:11:13.583,000 --> 0:11:15,000
This means that your income is topped up

225
0:11:15.615,000 --> 0:11:17,000
as soon as you fall below the poverty line.

226
0:11:18.051,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And in that scenario,

227
0:11:19.437,000 --> 0:11:21,000
according to our economists' best estimates,

228
0:11:21.975,000 --> 0:11:24,000
for a net cost of 175 billion --

229
0:11:25.024,000 --> 0:11:29,000
a quarter of US military spending, one percent of GDP --

230
0:11:29.955,000 --> 0:11:32,000
you could lift all impoverished Americans above the poverty line.

231
0:11:34.386,000 --> 0:11:37,000
You could actually eradicate poverty.

232
0:11:37.962,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Now, that should be our goal.

233
0:11:40.536,000 --> 0:11:41,000
(Applause)

234
0:11:41.644,000 --> 0:11:43,000
The time for small thoughts and little nudges is past.

235
0:11:44.6,000 --> 0:11:47,000
I really believe that the time has come for radical new ideas,

236
0:11:47.932,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and basic income is so much more than just another policy.

237
0:11:51.156,000 --> 0:11:55,000
It is also a complete rethink of what work actually is.

238
0:11:55.818,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And in that sense,

239
0:11:57.512,000 --> 0:11:58,000
it will not only free the poor,

240
0:12:00.352,000 --> 0:12:01,000
but also the rest of us.

241
0:12:03.081,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Nowadays, millions of people feel

242
0:12:05.351,000 --> 0:12:07,000
that their jobs have little meaning or significance.

243
0:12:07.881,000 --> 0:12:09,000
A recent poll among 230,000 employees

244
0:12:10.722,000 --> 0:12:11,000
in 142 countries

245
0:12:12.652,000 --> 0:12:16,000
found that only 13 percent of workers actually like their job.

246
0:12:18.42,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And another poll found that as much as 37 percent of British workers

247
0:12:22.111,000 --> 0:12:24,000
have a job that they think doesn't even need to exist.

248
0:12:26.207,000 --> 0:12:28,000
It's like Brad Pitt says in "Fight Club,"

249
0:12:28.525,000 --> 0:12:31,000
"Too often we're working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need."

250
0:12:32.205,000 --> 0:12:33,000
(Laughter)

251
0:12:33.707,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Now, don't get me wrong --

252
0:12:35.128,000 --> 0:12:37,000
I'm not talking about the teachers and the garbagemen

253
0:12:37.706,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and the care workers here.

254
0:12:39.212,000 --> 0:12:4,000
If they stopped working,

255
0:12:40.85,000 --> 0:12:41,000
we'd be in trouble.

256
0:12:42.81,000 --> 0:12:45,000
I'm talking about all those well-paid professionals with excellent résumés

257
0:12:46.459,000 --> 0:12:47,000
who earn their money doing ...

258
0:12:48.288,000 --> 0:12:5,000
strategic transactor peer-to-peer meetings

259
0:12:50.348,000 --> 0:12:53,000
while brainstorming the value add-on of disruptive co-creation

260
0:12:53.404,000 --> 0:12:54,000
in the network society.

261
0:12:54.601,000 --> 0:12:55,000
(Laughter)

262
0:12:55.648,000 --> 0:12:56,000
(Applause)

263
0:12:56.69,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Or something like that.

264
0:12:57.916,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Just imagine again how much talent we're wasting,

265
0:13:00.864,000 --> 0:13:03,000
simply because we tell our kids they'll have to "earn a living."

266
0:13:05.458,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Or think of what a math whiz working at Facebook lamented a few years ago:

267
0:13:09.224,000 --> 0:13:1,000
"The best minds of my generation

268
0:13:11.11,000 --> 0:13:14,000
are thinking about how to make people click ads."

269
0:13:16.519,000 --> 0:13:17,000
I'm a historian.

270
0:13:18.812,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And if history teaches us anything,

271
0:13:20.905,000 --> 0:13:22,000
it is that things could be different.

272
0:13:23.721,000 --> 0:13:24,000
There is nothing inevitable

273
0:13:25.136,000 --> 0:13:27,000
about the way we structured our society and economy right now.

274
0:13:28.117,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Ideas can and do change the world.

275
0:13:30.497,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And I think that especially in the past few years,

276
0:13:33.032,000 --> 0:13:34,000
it has become abundantly clear

277
0:13:34.485,000 --> 0:13:35,000
that we cannot stick to the status quo --

278
0:13:36.462,000 --> 0:13:37,000
that we need new ideas.

279
0:13:40.319,000 --> 0:13:43,000
I know that many of you may feel pessimistic

280
0:13:43.556,000 --> 0:13:45,000
about a future of rising inequality,

281
0:13:45.643,000 --> 0:13:46,000
xenophobia

282
0:13:46.944,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and climate change.

283
0:13:48.806,000 --> 0:13:5,000
But it's not enough to know what we're against.

284
0:13:51.048,000 --> 0:13:52,000
We also need to be for something.

285
0:13:52.684,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Martin Luther King didn't say, "I have a nightmare."

286
0:13:55.242,000 --> 0:13:56,000
(Laughter)

287
0:13:57.139,000 --> 0:13:58,000
He had a dream.

288
0:13:58.322,000 --> 0:13:59,000
(Applause)

289
0:13:59.425,000 --> 0:14:,000
So ...

290
0:14:01.655,000 --> 0:14:02,000
here's my dream:

291
0:14:04.123,000 --> 0:14:05,000
I believe in a future

292
0:14:05.785,000 --> 0:14:07,000
where the value of your work is not determined

293
0:14:08.162,000 --> 0:14:09,000
by the size of your paycheck,

294
0:14:09.663,000 --> 0:14:11,000
but by the amount of happiness you spread

295
0:14:11.719,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and the amount of meaning you give.

296
0:14:13.72,000 --> 0:14:14,000
I believe in a future

297
0:14:14.976,000 --> 0:14:17,000
where the point of education is not to prepare you for another useless job

298
0:14:18.66,000 --> 0:14:19,000
but for a life well-lived.

299
0:14:21.024,000 --> 0:14:22,000
I believe in a future

300
0:14:22.327,000 --> 0:14:25,000
where an existence without poverty is not a privilege

301
0:14:25.445,000 --> 0:14:27,000
but a right we all deserve.

302
0:14:27.482,000 --> 0:14:28,000
So here we are.

303
0:14:28.971,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Here we are.

304
0:14:30.146,000 --> 0:14:32,000
We've got the research, we've got the evidence

305
0:14:32.36,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and we've got the means.

306
0:14:33.547,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Now, more than 500 years after Thomas More first wrote about a basic income,

307
0:14:37.48,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and 100 years after George Orwell discovered the true nature of poverty,

308
0:14:41.559,000 --> 0:14:43,000
we all need to change our worldview,

309
0:14:44.024,000 --> 0:14:46,000
because poverty is not a lack of character.

310
0:14:47.652,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Poverty is a lack of cash.

311
0:14:51.141,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Thank you.

312
0:14:52.349,000 --> 0:14:56,000
(Applause)

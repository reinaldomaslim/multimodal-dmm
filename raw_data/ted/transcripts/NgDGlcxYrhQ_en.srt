1
0:00:13.19,000 --> 0:00:14,000
This is a map of New York State

2
0:00:14.875,000 --> 0:00:17,000
that was made in 1937 by the General Drafting Company.

3
0:00:18.417,000 --> 0:00:21,000
It's an extremely famous map among cartography nerds,

4
0:00:21.938,000 --> 0:00:23,000
because down here at the bottom of the Catskill Mountains,

5
0:00:24.683,000 --> 0:00:25,000
there is a little town called Roscoe --

6
0:00:26.586,000 --> 0:00:28,000
actually, this will go easier if I just put it up here --

7
0:00:29.308,000 --> 0:00:32,000
There's Roscoe, and then right above Roscoe is Rockland, New York,

8
0:00:32.862,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and then right above that is the tiny town of Agloe, New York.

9
0:00:36.699,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Agloe, New York, is very famous to cartographers,

10
0:00:39.782,000 --> 0:00:41,000
because it's a paper town.

11
0:00:42.082,000 --> 0:00:44,000
It's also known as a copyright trap.

12
0:00:44.328,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Mapmakers -- because my map of New York and your map of New York

13
0:00:47.706,000 --> 0:00:5,000
are going to look very similar, on account of the shape of New York --

14
0:00:51.396,000 --> 0:00:55,000
often, mapmakers will insert fake places onto their maps,

15
0:00:56.193,000 --> 0:00:57,000
in order to protect their copyright.

16
0:00:57.979,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Because then, if my fake place shows up on your map,

17
0:01:00.891,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I can be well and truly sure that you have robbed me.

18
0:01:04.57,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Agloe is a scrabblization of the initials of the two guys who made this map,

19
0:01:09.235,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Ernest Alpers and Otto [G.] Lindberg,

20
0:01:12.18,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and they released this map in 1937.

21
0:01:15.48,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Decades later, Rand McNally releases a map

22
0:01:18.823,000 --> 0:01:22,000
with Agloe, New York, on it, at the same exact intersection

23
0:01:22.871,000 --> 0:01:24,000
of two dirt roads in the middle of nowhere.

24
0:01:26.205,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Well, you can imagine the delight over at General Drafting.

25
0:01:29.49,000 --> 0:01:32,000
They immediately call Rand McNally, and they say,

26
0:01:32.726,000 --> 0:01:35,000
"We've caught you! We made Agloe, New York, up.

27
0:01:36.344,000 --> 0:01:38,000
It is a fake place. It's a paper town.

28
0:01:38.422,000 --> 0:01:39,000
We're going to sue your pants off!"

29
0:01:41.003,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And Rand McNally says, "No, no, no, no, Agloe is real."

30
0:01:46.616,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Because people kept going to that intersection of two dirt roads --

31
0:01:51.184,000 --> 0:01:52,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:52.232,000 --> 0:01:56,000
in the middle of nowhere, expecting there to be a place called Agloe --

33
0:01:56.752,000 --> 0:01:59,000
someone built a place called Agloe, New York.

34
0:02:00.009,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Laughter)

35
0:02:01.072,000 --> 0:02:04,000
It had a gas station, a general store, two houses at its peak.

36
0:02:04.477,000 --> 0:02:06,000
(Laughter)

37
0:02:07.596,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And this is of course a completely irresistible metaphor to a novelist,

38
0:02:12.098,000 --> 0:02:16,000
because we would all like to believe that the stuff that we write down on paper

39
0:02:16.733,000 --> 0:02:18,000
can change the actual world in which we're actually living,

40
0:02:19.549,000 --> 0:02:21,000
which is why my third book is called "Paper Towns".

41
0:02:21.962,000 --> 0:02:25,000
But what interests me ultimately more than the medium in which this happened,

42
0:02:26.525,000 --> 0:02:28,000
is the phenomenon itself.

43
0:02:29.521,000 --> 0:02:33,000
It's easy enough to say that the world shapes our maps of the world, right?

44
0:02:33.622,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Like the overall shape of the world is obviously going to affect our maps.

45
0:02:38.503,000 --> 0:02:41,000
But what I find a lot more interesting is the way

46
0:02:41.842,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that the manner in which we map the world changes the world.

47
0:02:45.872,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Because the world would truly be a different place if North were down.

48
0:02:50.587,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And the world would be a truly different place

49
0:02:52.789,000 --> 0:02:55,000
if Alaska and Russia weren't on opposite sides of the map.

50
0:02:55.832,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And the world would be a different place

51
0:02:57.782,000 --> 0:03:,000
if we projected Europe to show it in its actual size.

52
0:03:01.93,000 --> 0:03:05,000
The world is changed by our maps of the world.

53
0:03:06.41,000 --> 0:03:1,000
The way that we choose -- sort of, our personal cartographic enterprise,

54
0:03:11.289,000 --> 0:03:13,000
also shapes the map of our lives,

55
0:03:13.948,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and that in turn shapes our lives.

56
0:03:16.09,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I believe that what we map changes the life we lead.

57
0:03:20.769,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And I don't mean that in some, like, secret-y Oprah's Angels network, like,

58
0:03:25.207,000 --> 0:03:27,000
you-can-think-your-way- out-of-cancer sense.

59
0:03:28.201,000 --> 0:03:34,000
But I do believe that while maps don't show you where you will go in your life,

60
0:03:34.758,000 --> 0:03:35,000
they show you where you might go.

61
0:03:36.773,000 --> 0:03:4,000
You very rarely go to a place that isn't on your personal map.

62
0:03:41.853,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So I was a really terrible student when I was a kid.

63
0:03:44.992,000 --> 0:03:46,000
My GPA was consistently in the low 2s.

64
0:03:48.535,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And I think the reason that I was such a terrible student

65
0:03:51.32,000 --> 0:03:54,000
is that I felt like education was just a series of hurdles

66
0:03:54.499,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that had been erected before me,

67
0:03:56.68,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and I had to jump over in order to achieve adulthood.

68
0:04:00.331,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And I didn't really want to jump over these hurdles,

69
0:04:02.839,000 --> 0:04:04,000
because they seemed completely arbitrary, so I often wouldn't,

70
0:04:05.797,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and then people would threaten me, you know,

71
0:04:07.898,000 --> 0:04:09,000
they'd threaten me with this "going on [my] permanent record,"

72
0:04:10.851,000 --> 0:04:12,000
or "You'll never get a good job."

73
0:04:13.084,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I didn't want a good job!

74
0:04:15.003,000 --> 0:04:17,000
As far as I could tell at eleven or twelve years old,

75
0:04:17.623,000 --> 0:04:2,000
like, people with good jobs woke up very early in the morning,

76
0:04:20.799,000 --> 0:04:22,000
(Laughter)

77
0:04:22.828,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and the men who had good jobs, one of the first things they did

78
0:04:27.424,000 --> 0:04:3,000
was tie a strangulation item of clothing around their necks.

79
0:04:31.924,000 --> 0:04:33,000
They literally put nooses on themselves,

80
0:04:33.996,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and then they went off to their jobs, whatever they were.

81
0:04:37.455,000 --> 0:04:39,000
That's not a recipe for a happy life.

82
0:04:39.918,000 --> 0:04:42,000
These people -- in my, symbol-obsessed, twelve year-old imagination --

83
0:04:43.861,000 --> 0:04:45,000
these people who are strangling themselves

84
0:04:46.444,000 --> 0:04:48,000
as one of the first things they do each morning,

85
0:04:48.824,000 --> 0:04:49,000
they can't possibly be happy.

86
0:04:50.608,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Why would I want to jump over all of these hurdles

87
0:04:53.044,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and have that be the end?

88
0:04:55.068,000 --> 0:04:56,000
That's a terrible end!

89
0:04:57.454,000 --> 0:05:,000
And then, when I was in tenth grade, I went to this school,

90
0:05:00.656,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Indian Springs School, a small boarding school,

91
0:05:03.442,000 --> 0:05:04,000
outside of Birmingham, Alabama.

92
0:05:05.276,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And all at once I became a learner.

93
0:05:08.815,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And I became a learner, because I found myself

94
0:05:11.035,000 --> 0:05:13,000
in a community of learners.

95
0:05:13.083,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I found myself surrounded by people

96
0:05:14.87,000 --> 0:05:17,000
who celebrated intellectualism and engagement,

97
0:05:18.124,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and who thought that my ironic oh-so-cool disengagement

98
0:05:22.321,000 --> 0:05:23,000
wasn't clever, or funny,

99
0:05:24.199,000 --> 0:05:27,000
but, like, it was a simple and unspectacular response

100
0:05:27.985,000 --> 0:05:29,000
to very complicated and compelling problems.

101
0:05:30.692,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And so I started to learn, because learning was cool.

102
0:05:33.209,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I learned that some infinite sets are bigger than other infinite sets,

103
0:05:36.536,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and I learned that iambic pentameter is and why it sounds so good to human ears.

104
0:05:40.654,000 --> 0:05:43,000
I learned that the Civil War was a nationalizing conflict,

105
0:05:44.12,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I learned some physics,

106
0:05:45.311,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I learned that correlation shouldn't be confused with causation --

107
0:05:48.491,000 --> 0:05:49,000
all of these things, by the way,

108
0:05:50.308,000 --> 0:05:54,000
enriched my life on a literally daily basis.

109
0:05:54.584,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And it's true that I don't use most of them for my "job,"

110
0:05:58.194,000 --> 0:05:59,000
but that's not what it's about for me.

111
0:06:00.132,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It's about cartography.

112
0:06:02.107,000 --> 0:06:04,000
What is the process of cartography?

113
0:06:04.392,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It's, you know, sailing upon some land, and thinking,

114
0:06:07.577,000 --> 0:06:09,000
"I think I'll draw that bit of land,"

115
0:06:09.702,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and then wondering, "Maybe there's some more land to draw."

116
0:06:13.049,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And that's when learning really began for me.

117
0:06:15.28,000 --> 0:06:17,000
It's true that I had teachers that didn't give up on me,

118
0:06:17.94,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and I was very fortunate to have those teachers,

119
0:06:20.282,000 --> 0:06:24,000
because I often gave them cause to think there was no reason to invest in me.

120
0:06:24.924,000 --> 0:06:27,000
But a lot of the learning that I did in high school

121
0:06:28.054,000 --> 0:06:31,000
wasn't about what happened inside the classroom,

122
0:06:31.257,000 --> 0:06:33,000
it was about what happened outside of the classroom.

123
0:06:33.739,000 --> 0:06:34,000
For instance, I can tell you

124
0:06:35.12,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that "There's a certain Slant of light, Winter Afternoons --

125
0:06:37.977,000 --> 0:06:39,000
That oppresses, like the Heft Of Cathedral Tunes --"

126
0:06:40.454,000 --> 0:06:43,000
not because I memorized Emily Dickinson in school

127
0:06:43.794,000 --> 0:06:44,000
when I was in high school,

128
0:06:45.094,000 --> 0:06:47,000
but because there was a girl when I was in high school,

129
0:06:47.713,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and her name was Amanda, and I had a crush on her,

130
0:06:50.224,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and she liked Emily Dickinson poetry.

131
0:06:52.622,000 --> 0:06:54,000
The reason I can tell you what opportunity cost is,

132
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
is because one day when I was playing Super Mario Kart on my couch,

133
0:06:59.006,000 --> 0:07:,000
my friend Emmet walked in, and he said,

134
0:07:00.902,000 --> 0:07:02,000
"How long have you been playing Super Mario Kart?"

135
0:07:03.284,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And I said, "I don't know, like, six hours?" and he said,

136
0:07:06.778,000 --> 0:07:09,000
"Do you realize that if you'd worked at Baskin-Robbins those six hours,

137
0:07:10.17,000 --> 0:07:12,000
you could have made 30 dollars, so in some ways,

138
0:07:12.452,000 --> 0:07:14,000
you just paid thirty dollars to play Super Mario Kart."

139
0:07:15.396,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And I was, like, "I'll take that deal."

140
0:07:17.678,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Laughter)

141
0:07:20.051,000 --> 0:07:23,000
But I learned what opportunity cost is.

142
0:07:25.079,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And along the way, the map of my life got better.

143
0:07:28.785,000 --> 0:07:3,000
It got bigger; it contained more places.

144
0:07:31.666,000 --> 0:07:32,000
There were more things that might happen,

145
0:07:33.655,000 --> 0:07:34,000
more futures I might have.

146
0:07:36.662,000 --> 0:07:39,000
It wasn't a formal, organized learning process,

147
0:07:39.973,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and I'm happy to admit that.

148
0:07:41.728,000 --> 0:07:44,000
It was spotty, it was inconsistent, there was a lot I didn't know.

149
0:07:44.884,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I might know, you know, Cantor's idea

150
0:07:47.202,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that some infinite sets are larger than other infinite sets,

151
0:07:50.059,000 --> 0:07:52,000
but I didn't really understand the calculus behind that idea.

152
0:07:52.98,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I might know the idea of opportunity cost,

153
0:07:55.019,000 --> 0:07:57,000
but I didn't know the law of diminishing returns.

154
0:07:57.353,000 --> 0:07:59,000
But the great thing about imagining learning as cartography,

155
0:08:00.35,000 --> 0:08:02,000
instead of imagining it as arbitrary hurdles

156
0:08:02.462,000 --> 0:08:03,000
that you have to jump over,

157
0:08:03.844,000 --> 0:08:06,000
is that you see a bit of coastline, and that makes you want to see more.

158
0:08:07.34,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And so now I do know at least some of the calculus

159
0:08:09.801,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that underlies all of that stuff.

160
0:08:11.557,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So, I had one learning community

161
0:08:13.351,000 --> 0:08:15,000
in high school, then I went to another for college,

162
0:08:15.989,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and then I went to another,

163
0:08:17.313,000 --> 0:08:19,000
when I started working at a magazine called "Booklist,"

164
0:08:19.933,000 --> 0:08:22,000
where I was an assistant, surrounded by astonishingly well-read people.

165
0:08:23.31,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And then I wrote a book.

166
0:08:24.86,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And like all authors dream of doing,

167
0:08:27.084,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I promptly quit my job.

168
0:08:29.037,000 --> 0:08:3,000
(Laughter)

169
0:08:30.65,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And for the first time since high school,

170
0:08:32.65,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I found myself without a learning community, and it was miserable.

171
0:08:37.277,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I hated it.

172
0:08:38.735,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I read many, many books during this two-year period.

173
0:08:42.133,000 --> 0:08:43,000
I read books about Stalin,

174
0:08:43.92,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and books about how the Uzbek people came to identify as Muslims,

175
0:08:47.435,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and I read books about how to make atomic bombs,

176
0:08:49.809,000 --> 0:08:52,000
but it just felt like I was creating my own hurdles,

177
0:08:52.982,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and then jumping over them myself, instead of feeling the excitement

178
0:08:56.362,000 --> 0:08:59,000
of being part of a community of learners, a community of people

179
0:09:00.035,000 --> 0:09:02,000
who are engaged together in the cartographic enterprise

180
0:09:03.042,000 --> 0:09:06,000
of trying to better understand and map the world around us.

181
0:09:06.979,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And then, in 2006, I met that guy.

182
0:09:10.092,000 --> 0:09:11,000
His name is Ze Frank.

183
0:09:11.267,000 --> 0:09:13,000
I didn't actually meet him, just on the Internet.

184
0:09:14.455,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Ze Frank was running, at the time, a show called "The Show with Ze Frank,"

185
0:09:19.482,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and I discovered the show,

186
0:09:20.98,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and that was my way back into being a community learner again.

187
0:09:24.238,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Here's Ze talking about Las Vegas:

188
0:09:27.823,000 --> 0:09:3,000
(Video) Ze Frank: Las Vegas was built in the middle of a huge, hot desert.

189
0:09:31.366,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Almost everything here was brought from somewhere else --

190
0:09:34.086,000 --> 0:09:36,000
the sort of rocks, the trees, the waterfalls.

191
0:09:36.286,000 --> 0:09:39,000
These fish are almost as out of place as my pig that flew.

192
0:09:39.319,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Contrasted to the scorching desert that surrounds this place,

193
0:09:42.209,000 --> 0:09:43,000
so are these people.

194
0:09:43.387,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Things from all over the world have been rebuilt here, away from their histories,

195
0:09:47.342,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and away from the people that experience them differently.

196
0:09:50.114,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Sometimes improvements were made -- even the Sphinx got a nose job.

197
0:09:53.318,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Here, there's no reason to feel like you're missing anything.

198
0:09:56.233,000 --> 0:09:58,000
This New York means the same to me as it does to everyone else.

199
0:09:59.227,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Everything is out of context, and that means context allows for everything:

200
0:10:02.808,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Self Parking, Events Center, Shark Reef.

201
0:10:04.762,000 --> 0:10:07,000
This fabrication of place could be one of the world's greatest achievements,

202
0:10:08.384,000 --> 0:10:1,000
because no one belongs here; everyone does.

203
0:10:10.429,000 --> 0:10:13,000
As I walked around this morning, I noticed most of the buildings

204
0:10:13.477,000 --> 0:10:15,000
were huge mirrors reflecting the sun back into the desert.

205
0:10:16.241,000 --> 0:10:17,000
But unlike most mirrors,

206
0:10:17.426,000 --> 0:10:2,000
which present you with an outside view of yourself embedded in a place,

207
0:10:20.825,000 --> 0:10:21,000
these mirrors come back empty.

208
0:10:22.294,000 --> 0:10:24,000
John Green: Makes me nostalgic for the days

209
0:10:24.497,000 --> 0:10:26,000
when you could see the pixels in online video.

210
0:10:26.703,000 --> 0:10:27,000
(Laughter)

211
0:10:27.734,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Ze isn't just a great public intellectual, he's also a brilliant community builder,

212
0:10:31.844,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and the community of people that built up around these videos

213
0:10:34.729,000 --> 0:10:36,000
was in many ways a community of learners.

214
0:10:36.765,000 --> 0:10:39,000
So we played Ze Frank at chess collaboratively, and we beat him.

215
0:10:40.313,000 --> 0:10:44,000
We organized ourselves to take a young man on a road trip across the United States.

216
0:10:44.75,000 --> 0:10:45,000
We turned the Earth into a sandwich,

217
0:10:46.725,000 --> 0:10:49,000
by having one person hold a piece of bread at one point on the Earth,

218
0:10:50.458,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and on the exact opposite point of the Earth,

219
0:10:52.611,000 --> 0:10:54,000
have another person holding a piece of bread.

220
0:10:55.593,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I realize that these are silly ideas, but they are also "learny" ideas,

221
0:11:01.625,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and that was what was so exciting to me,

222
0:11:03.571,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and if you go online, you can find communities like this all over the place.

223
0:11:07.185,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Follow the calculus tag on Tumblr,

224
0:11:09.09,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and yes, you will see people complaining about calculus,

225
0:11:11.765,000 --> 0:11:13,000
but you'll also see people re-blogging those complaints,

226
0:11:14.459,000 --> 0:11:17,000
making the argument that calculus is interesting and beautiful,

227
0:11:17.667,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and here's a way in to thinking about the problem that you find unsolvable.

228
0:11:21.644,000 --> 0:11:23,000
You can go to places like Reddit, and find sub-Reddits,

229
0:11:24.264,000 --> 0:11:26,000
like "Ask a Historian" or "Ask Science,"

230
0:11:26.906,000 --> 0:11:29,000
where you can ask people who are in these fields

231
0:11:30.161,000 --> 0:11:31,000
a wide range of questions,

232
0:11:31.653,000 --> 0:11:33,000
from very serious ones to very silly ones.

233
0:11:34.018,000 --> 0:11:36,000
But to me, the most interesting communities of learners

234
0:11:36.974,000 --> 0:11:38,000
that are growing up on the Internet right now are on YouTube,

235
0:11:39.861,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and admittedly, I am biased.

236
0:11:41.481,000 --> 0:11:45,000
But I think in a lot of ways, the YouTube page resembles a classroom.

237
0:11:46.039,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Look for instance at "Minute Physics,"

238
0:11:47.887,000 --> 0:11:49,000
a guy who's teaching the world about physics:

239
0:11:50.704,000 --> 0:11:51,000
(Video) Let's cut to the chase.

240
0:11:52.229,000 --> 0:11:55,000
As of July 4, 2012, the Higgs boson is the last fundamental piece

241
0:11:55.611,000 --> 0:11:58,000
of the standard model of particle physics to be discovered experimentally.

242
0:11:59.115,000 --> 0:12:01,000
But, you might ask, why was the Higgs boson

243
0:12:01.193,000 --> 0:12:02,000
included in the standard model,

244
0:12:02.703,000 --> 0:12:05,000
alongside well-known particles like electrons and photons and quarks,

245
0:12:05.997,000 --> 0:12:07,000
if it hadn't been discovered back then in the 1970s?

246
0:12:08.541,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Good question. There are two main reasons.

247
0:12:10.565,000 --> 0:12:13,000
First, just like the electron is an excitation in the electron field,

248
0:12:13.848,000 --> 0:12:15,000
the Higgs boson is simply a particle which is an excitation

249
0:12:16.666,000 --> 0:12:17,000
of the everywhere-permeating Higgs field.

250
0:12:18.673,000 --> 0:12:2,000
The Higgs field in turn plays an integral role

251
0:12:20.941,000 --> 0:12:21,000
in our model for the weak nuclear force.

252
0:12:22.894,000 --> 0:12:25,000
In particular, the Higgs field helps explain why it's so weak.

253
0:12:26.078,000 --> 0:12:28,000
We'll talk more about this in a later video,

254
0:12:28.166,000 --> 0:12:31,000
but even though weak nuclear theory was confirmed in the 1980s, in the equations,

255
0:12:32.024,000 --> 0:12:35,000
the Higgs field is so inextricably jumbled with the weak force, that until now

256
0:12:35.76,000 --> 0:12:38,000
we've been unable to confirm its actual and independent existence.

257
0:12:38.951,000 --> 0:12:39,000
JG: Or here's a video that I made

258
0:12:40.75,000 --> 0:12:43,000
as part of my show "Crash Course," talking about World War I:

259
0:12:43.983,000 --> 0:12:46,000
(Video) The immediate cause was of course the assassination in Sarajevo

260
0:12:47.378,000 --> 0:12:49,000
of the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand,

261
0:12:49.413,000 --> 0:12:53,000
on June 28, 1914, by a Bosnian-Serb nationalist named Gavrilo Princip.

262
0:12:53.863,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Quick aside: It's worth noting

263
0:12:55.329,000 --> 0:12:57,000
that the first big war of the twentieth century began

264
0:12:57.845,000 --> 0:12:58,000
with an act of terrorism.

265
0:12:59.09,000 --> 0:13:01,000
So Franz Ferdinand wasn't particularly well-liked

266
0:13:01.445,000 --> 0:13:04,000
by his uncle, the emperor Franz Joseph -- now that is a mustache!

267
0:13:05.103,000 --> 0:13:08,000
But even so, the assassination led Austria to issue an ultimatum to Serbia,

268
0:13:08.902,000 --> 0:13:11,000
whereupon Serbia accepted some, but not all, of Austria's demands,

269
0:13:12.138,000 --> 0:13:14,000
leading Austria to declare war against Serbia.

270
0:13:14.722,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And then Russia, due to its alliance with the Serbs, mobilized its army.

271
0:13:18.127,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Germany, because it had an alliance with Austria,

272
0:13:20.461,000 --> 0:13:21,000
told Russia to stop mobilizing,

273
0:13:21.982,000 --> 0:13:24,000
which Russia failed to do, so then Germany mobilized its own army,

274
0:13:25.265,000 --> 0:13:28,000
declared war on Russia, cemented an alliance with the Ottomans,

275
0:13:28.358,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and then declared war on France, because, you know, France.

276
0:13:31.961,000 --> 0:13:34,000
(Laughter)

277
0:13:35.438,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And it's not just physics and world history

278
0:13:37.706,000 --> 0:13:4,000
that people are choosing to learn through YouTube.

279
0:13:40.862,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Here's a video about abstract mathematics.

280
0:13:45.914,000 --> 0:13:47,000
(Video) So you're me, and you're in math class yet again,

281
0:13:48.622,000 --> 0:13:5,000
because they make you go every single day.

282
0:13:50.648,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And you're learning about, I don't know, the sums of infinite series.

283
0:13:53.939,000 --> 0:13:54,000
That's a high school topic, right?

284
0:13:55.589,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Which is odd, because it's a cool topic, but they somehow manage to ruin it anyway.

285
0:13:59.529,000 --> 0:14:02,000
So I guess that's why they allow infinite series in the curriculum.

286
0:14:02.711,000 --> 0:14:05,000
So, in a quite understandable need for distraction, you're doodling

287
0:14:05.887,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and thinking more about what the plural of "series" should be

288
0:14:08.843,000 --> 0:14:11,000
than about the topic at hand: "serieses," "seriese," "seriesen," and "serii?"

289
0:14:12.509,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Or is it that the singular should be changed: one "serie," or "serum,"

290
0:14:15.832,000 --> 0:14:17,000
just like the singular of "sheep" should be "shoop."

291
0:14:18.3,000 --> 0:14:19,000
But the whole concept of things

292
0:14:19.817,000 --> 0:14:22,000
like 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 and so on approaches one, is useful if, say,

293
0:14:23.302,000 --> 0:14:24,000
you want to draw a line of elephants,

294
0:14:25.089,000 --> 0:14:26,000
each holding the tail of the next one:

295
0:14:26.929,000 --> 0:14:29,000
normal elephant, young elephant, baby elephant, dog-sized elephant,

296
0:14:30.121,000 --> 0:14:32,000
puppy-sized elephant, all the way down to Mr. Tusks and beyond.

297
0:14:33.116,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Which is at least a tiny bit awesome,

298
0:14:34.921,000 --> 0:14:36,000
because you can get an infinite number of elephants in a line,

299
0:14:37.892,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and still have it fit across a single notebook page.

300
0:14:40.369,000 --> 0:14:42,000
JG: And lastly, here's Destin, from "Smarter Every Day,"

301
0:14:43.015,000 --> 0:14:45,000
talking about the conservation of angular momentum,

302
0:14:45.448,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and, since it's YouTube, cats:

303
0:14:46.949,000 --> 0:14:49,000
(Video) Hey, it's me, Destin. Welcome back to "Smarter Every Day."

304
0:14:50.084,000 --> 0:14:53,000
So you've probably observed that cats almost always land on their feet.

305
0:14:53.45,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Today's question is: why?

306
0:14:55.434,000 --> 0:14:57,000
Like most simple questions, there's a very complex answer.

307
0:14:58.214,000 --> 0:15:,000
For instance, let me reword this question:

308
0:15:00.248,000 --> 0:15:05,000
How does a cat go from feet-up to feet-down in a falling reference frame,

309
0:15:05.467,000 --> 0:15:07,000
without violating the conservation of angular momentum?

310
0:15:08.456,000 --> 0:15:09,000
(Laughter)

311
0:15:09.491,000 --> 0:15:12,000
JG: So, here's something all four of these videos have in common:

312
0:15:13.397,000 --> 0:15:16,000
They all have more than half a million views on YouTube.

313
0:15:16.54,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And those are people watching not in classrooms,

314
0:15:19.633,000 --> 0:15:22,000
but because they are part of the communities of learning

315
0:15:23.298,000 --> 0:15:25,000
that are being set up by these channels.

316
0:15:25.686,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And I said earlier that YouTube is like a classroom to me,

317
0:15:28.441,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and in many ways it is, because here is the instructor --

318
0:15:31.148,000 --> 0:15:34,000
it's like the old-fashioned classroom: here's the instructor,

319
0:15:34.19,000 --> 0:15:36,000
and then beneath the instructor are the students,

320
0:15:36.537,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and they're all having a conversation.

321
0:15:38.632,000 --> 0:15:42,000
And I know that YouTube comments have a very bad reputation

322
0:15:42.685,000 --> 0:15:43,000
in the world of the Internet,

323
0:15:44.104,000 --> 0:15:47,000
but in fact, if you go on comments for these channels,

324
0:15:47.199,000 --> 0:15:5,000
what you'll find is people engaging the subject matter,

325
0:15:50.378,000 --> 0:15:54,000
asking difficult, complicated questions that are about the subject matter,

326
0:15:54.649,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and then other people answering those questions.

327
0:15:57.411,000 --> 0:16:01,000
And because the YouTube page is set up so that the page in which I'm talking to you

328
0:16:02.269,000 --> 0:16:05,000
is on the exact -- the place where I'm talking to you is on the exact same page

329
0:16:06.136,000 --> 0:16:07,000
as your comments,

330
0:16:07.318,000 --> 0:16:12,000
you are participating in a live and real and active way in the conversation.

331
0:16:12.974,000 --> 0:16:15,000
And because I'm in comments usually, I get to participate with you.

332
0:16:16.569,000 --> 0:16:18,000
And you find this whether it's world history,

333
0:16:19.047,000 --> 0:16:22,000
or mathematics, or science, or whatever it is.

334
0:16:22.133,000 --> 0:16:27,000
You also see young people using the tools and the sort of genres of the Internet

335
0:16:27.775,000 --> 0:16:3,000
in order to create places for intellectual engagement,

336
0:16:30.876,000 --> 0:16:31,000
instead of the ironic detachment

337
0:16:32.5,000 --> 0:16:36,000
that maybe most of us associate with memes and other Internet conventions --

338
0:16:37.221,000 --> 0:16:39,000
you know, "Got bored. Invented calculus."

339
0:16:39.769,000 --> 0:16:42,000
Or, here's Honey Boo Boo criticizing industrial capitalism:

340
0:16:43.244,000 --> 0:16:45,000
["Liberal capitalism is not at all the Good of humanity.

341
0:16:45.934,000 --> 0:16:48,000
Quite the contrary; it is the vehicle of savage, destructive nihilism."]

342
0:16:49.517,000 --> 0:16:51,000
In case you can't see what she says ... yeah.

343
0:16:52.325,000 --> 0:16:55,000
I really believe that these spaces,

344
0:16:56.006,000 --> 0:17:01,000
these communities, have become for a new generation of learners,

345
0:17:01.063,000 --> 0:17:05,000
the kind of communities, the kind of cartographic communities

346
0:17:05.452,000 --> 0:17:09,000
that I had when I was in high school, and then again when I was in college.

347
0:17:10.019,000 --> 0:17:13,000
And as an adult, re-finding these communities

348
0:17:13.312,000 --> 0:17:16,000
has re-introduced me to a community of learners,

349
0:17:16.646,000 --> 0:17:2,000
and has encouraged me to continue to be a learner even in my adulthood,

350
0:17:21.568,000 --> 0:17:25,000
so that I no longer feel like learning is something reserved for the young.

351
0:17:26.303,000 --> 0:17:28,000
Vi Hart and "Minute Physics" introduced me

352
0:17:28.55,000 --> 0:17:3,000
to all kinds of things that I didn't know before.

353
0:17:31.754,000 --> 0:17:32,000
And I know that we all hearken back

354
0:17:33.457,000 --> 0:17:36,000
to the days of the Parisian salon in the Enlightenment,

355
0:17:36.567,000 --> 0:17:38,000
or to the Algonquin Round Table, and wish,

356
0:17:38.62,000 --> 0:17:4,000
"Oh, I wish I could have been a part of that,

357
0:17:40.769,000 --> 0:17:42,000
I wish I could have laughed at Dorothy Parker's jokes."

358
0:17:43.638,000 --> 0:17:47,000
But I'm here to tell you that these places exist, they still exist.

359
0:17:48.44,000 --> 0:17:52,000
They exist in corners of the Internet, where old men fear to tread.

360
0:17:52.993,000 --> 0:17:53,000
(Laughter)

361
0:17:54.02,000 --> 0:18:,000
And I truly, truly believe that when we invented Agloe, New York, in the 1960s,

362
0:18:00.869,000 --> 0:18:03,000
when we made Agloe real, we were just getting started.

363
0:18:05.246,000 --> 0:18:06,000
Thank you.

364
0:18:06.422,000 --> 0:18:08,000
(Applause)

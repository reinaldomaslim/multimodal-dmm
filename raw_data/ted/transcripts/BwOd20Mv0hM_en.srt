1
0:00:15.33,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I would like to talk today

2
0:00:17.33,000 --> 0:00:19,000
about what I think is one of the greatest adventures

3
0:00:19.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
human beings have embarked upon,

4
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
which is the quest to understand the universe

5
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and our place in it.

6
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
My own interest in this subject, and my passion for it,

7
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
began rather accidentally.

8
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I had bought a copy of this book,

9
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
"The Universe and Dr. Einstein" --

10
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
a used paperback from a secondhand bookstore in Seattle.

11
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
A few years after that, in Bangalore,

12
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I was finding it hard to fall asleep one night,

13
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and I picked up this book,

14
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
thinking it would put me to sleep in 10 minutes.

15
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And as it happened,

16
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot.

17
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And I was left with this intense feeling

18
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
of awe and exhilaration

19
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
at the universe

20
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and our own ability to understand as much as we do.

21
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And that feeling hasn't left me yet.

22
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
That feeling was the trigger for me

23
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
to actually change my career --

24
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
from being a software engineer to become a science writer --

25
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
so that I could partake in the joy of science,

26
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and also the joy of communicating it to others.

27
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And that feeling also led me

28
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
to a pilgrimage of sorts,

29
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
to go literally to the ends of the earth

30
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
to see telescopes, detectors,

31
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
instruments that people are building, or have built,

32
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
in order to probe the cosmos

33
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
in greater and greater detail.

34
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So it took me from places like Chile --

35
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
the Atacama Desert in Chile --

36
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
to Siberia,

37
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
to underground mines

38
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
in the Japanese Alps, in Northern America,

39
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
all the way to Antarctica

40
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and even to the South Pole.

41
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And today I would like to share with you

42
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
some images, some stories of these trips.

43
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I have been basically spending the last few years

44
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
documenting the efforts

45
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
of some extremely intrepid men and women

46
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
who are putting,

47
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
literally at times, their lives at stake

48
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
working in some very remote and very hostile places

49
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
so that they may gather the faintest signals from the cosmos

50
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
in order for us to understand this universe.

51
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And I first begin with a pie chart --

52
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and I promise this is the only pie chart

53
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
in the whole presentation --

54
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
but it sets up the state of our knowledge of the cosmos.

55
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
All the theories in physics that we have today

56
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
properly explain what is called normal matter --

57
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
the stuff that we're all made of --

58
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and that's four percent of the universe.

59
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Astronomers and cosmologists and physicists think

60
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
that there is something called dark matter in the universe,

61
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
which makes up 23 percent of the universe,

62
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and something called dark energy,

63
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
which permeates the fabric of space-time,

64
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that makes up another 73 percent.

65
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So if you look at this pie chart, 96 percent of the universe,

66
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
at this point in our exploration of it,

67
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
is unknown or not well understood.

68
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And most of the experiments, telescopes that I went to see

69
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
are in some way addressing this question,

70
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
these two twin mysteries of dark matter and dark energy.

71
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I will take you first to an underground mine

72
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
in Northern Minnesota

73
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
where people are looking

74
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
for something called dark matter.

75
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And the idea here is that they are looking for a sign

76
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
of a dark matter particle hitting one of their detectors.

77
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And the reason why they have to go underground

78
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
is that, if you did this experiment on the surface of the Earth,

79
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
the same experiment would be swamped by signals

80
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that could be created by things like cosmic rays,

81
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
ambient radio activity,

82
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
even our own bodies. You might not believe it,

83
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
but even our own bodies are radioactive enough to disturb this experiment.

84
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So they go deep inside mines

85
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
to find a kind of environmental silence

86
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that will allow them to hear

87
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
the ping of a dark matter particle hitting their detector.

88
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And I went to see one of these experiments,

89
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and this is actually -- you can barely see it,

90
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and the reason for that is it's entirely dark in there --

91
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
this is a cavern that was left behind by the miners

92
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
who left this mine in 1960.

93
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
And physicists came and started using it

94
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
sometime in the 1980s.

95
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And the miners in the early part of the last century

96
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
worked, literally, in candlelight.

97
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And today, you would see this inside the mine,

98
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
half a mile underground.

99
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
This is one of the largest underground labs in the world.

100
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And, among other things, they're looking for dark matter.

101
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
There is another way to search for dark matter,

102
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
which is indirectly.

103
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
If dark matter exists in our universe,

104
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
in our galaxy,

105
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
then these particles should be smashing together

106
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and producing other particles that we know about --

107
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
one of them being neutrinos.

108
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And neutrinos you can detect

109
0:04:33.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
by the signature they leave

110
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
when they hit water molecules.

111
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
When a neutrino hits a water molecule

112
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
it emits a kind of blue light,

113
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
a flash of blue light,

114
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and by looking for this blue light,

115
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
you can essentially understand something about the neutrino

116
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and then, indirectly, something about the dark matter

117
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that might have created this neutrino.

118
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
But you need very, very large volumes of water

119
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
in order to do this.

120
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
You need something like tens of megatons of water --

121
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
almost a gigaton of water --

122
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
in order to have any chance of catching this neutrino.

123
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And where in the world would you find such water?

124
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Well the Russians have a tank in their own backyard.

125
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
This is Lake Baikal.

126
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
It is the largest lake in the world. It's 800 km long.

127
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
It's about 40 to 50 km wide

128
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
in most places,

129
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and one to two kilometers deep.

130
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And what the Russians are doing

131
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
is they're building these detectors

132
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and immersing them about a kilometer beneath the surface of the lake

133
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
so that they can watch for these flashes of blue light.

134
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And this is the scene that greeted me when I landed there.

135
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
This is Lake Baikal

136
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
in the peak of the Siberian winter.

137
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
The lake is entirely frozen.

138
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And the line of black dots

139
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
that you see in the background,

140
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that's the ice camp where the physicists are working.

141
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
The reason why they have to work in winter

142
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
is because they don't have the money to work in summer and spring,

143
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
which, if they did that,

144
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
they would need ships and submersibles to do their work.

145
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So they wait until winter --

146
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
the lake is completely frozen over --

147
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and they use this meter-thick ice

148
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
as a platform on which to establish their ice camp and do their work.

149
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So this is the Russians working on the ice

150
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
in the peak of the Siberian winter.

151
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
They have to drill holes in the ice,

152
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
dive down into the water -- cold, cold water --

153
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
to get hold of the instrument, bring it up,

154
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
do any repairs and maintenance that they need to do,

155
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
put it back and get out before the ice melts.

156
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Because that phase of solid ice lasts for two months

157
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and it's full of cracks.

158
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And you have to imagine, there's an entire sea-like lake

159
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
underneath, moving.

160
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I still don't understand this one Russian man

161
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
working in his bare chest,

162
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
but that tells you how hard he was working.

163
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And these people, a handful of people,

164
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
have been working for 20 years,

165
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
looking for particles that may or may not exist.

166
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And they have dedicated their lives to it.

167
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And just to give you an idea,

168
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
they have spent 20 million over 20 years.

169
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
It's very harsh conditions.

170
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
They work on a shoestring budget.

171
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
The toilets there are literally holes in the ground

172
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
covered with a wooden shack.

173
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And it's that basic,

174
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
but they do this every year.

175
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
From Siberia to the Atacama Desert in Chile,

176
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
to see something called The Very Large Telescope.

177
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
The Very Large Telescope

178
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
is one of these things that astronomers do --

179
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
they name their telescopes rather unimaginatively.

180
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I can tell you for a fact,

181
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that the next one that they're planning is called The Extremely Large Telescope.

182
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
(Laughter)

183
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And you wouldn't believe it,

184
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
but the one after that is going to be called The Overwhelmingly Large Telescope.

185
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
But nonetheless,

186
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
it's an extraordinary piece of engineering.

187
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
These are four 8.2 meter telescopes.

188
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And these telescopes, among other things,

189
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
they're being used to study

190
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
how the expansion of the universe is changing with time.

191
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And the more you understand that,

192
0:07:45.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
the better you would understand

193
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
what this dark energy that the universe is made of is all about.

194
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And one piece of engineering that I want to leave you with

195
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
as regards this telescope

196
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:57,000
is the mirror.

197
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Each mirror, there are four of them,

198
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
is made of a single piece of glass,

199
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
a monolithic piece of high-tech ceramic,

200
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
that has been ground down and polished to such accuracy

201
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that the only way to understand what that is

202
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
is [to] imagine a city like Paris,

203
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
with all its buildings and the Eiffel Tower,

204
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
if you grind down Paris to that kind of accuracy,

205
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
you would be left with bumps that are one millimeter high.

206
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And that's the kind of polishing that these mirrors have endured.

207
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
An extraordinary set of telescopes.

208
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Here's another view of the same.

209
0:08:28.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
The reason why you have to build these telescopes

210
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
in places like the Atacama Desert

211
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
is because of the high altitude desert.

212
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
The dry air is really good for telescopes,

213
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and also, the cloud cover is below the summit of these mountains

214
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
so that the telescopes have

215
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
about 300 days of clear skies.

216
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Finally, I want to take you to Antarctica.

217
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I want to spend most of my time on this part of the world.

218
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
This is cosmology's final frontier.

219
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Some of the most amazing experiments,

220
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
some of the most extreme experiments,

221
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
are being done in Antarctica.

222
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I was there to view something called a long-duration balloon flight,

223
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
which basically takes telescopes and instruments

224
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
all the way to the upper atmosphere,

225
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
the upper stratosphere, 40 km up.

226
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And that's where they do their experiments,

227
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and then the balloon, the payload, is brought down.

228
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So this is us landing on the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica.

229
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
That's an American C-17 cargo plane

230
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
that flew us from New Zealand

231
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
to McMurdo in Antarctica.

232
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And here we are about to board our bus.

233
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And I don't know if you can read the lettering,

234
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
but it says, "Ivan the Terribus."

235
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And that's taking us to McMurdo.

236
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And this is the scene that greets you in McMurdo.

237
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And you barely might be able to make out

238
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
this hut here.

239
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:43,000
This hut was built by Robert Falcon Scott and his men

240
0:09:43.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
when they first came to Antarctica

241
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
on their first expedition to go to the South Pole.

242
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Because it's so cold,

243
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
the entire contents of that hut is still as they left it,

244
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
with the remnants of the last meal they cooked still there.

245
0:09:55.33,000 --> 0:09:57,000
It's an extraordinary place.

246
0:09:57.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
This is McMurdo itself. About a thousand people work here in summer,

247
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and about 200 in winter

248
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
when it's completely dark for six months.

249
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I was here to see the launch

250
0:10:06.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
of this particular type of instrument.

251
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
This is a cosmic ray experiment

252
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
that has been launched all the way to the upper-stratosphere

253
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
to an altitude of 40 km.

254
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
What I want you to imagine is this is two tons in weight.

255
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So you're using a balloon

256
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
to carry something that is two tons

257
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
all the way to an altitude of 40 km.

258
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And the engineers, the technicians, the physicists

259
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
have all got to assemble on the Ross Ice Shelf,

260
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
because Antarctica -- I won't go into the reasons why --

261
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
but it's one of the most favorable places for doing these balloon launches,

262
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
except for the weather.

263
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
The weather, as you can imagine,

264
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:42,000
this is summer, and you're standing on 200 ft of ice.

265
0:10:42.33,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And there's a volcano behind,

266
0:10:44.33,000 --> 0:10:46,000
which has glaciers at the very top.

267
0:10:46.33,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And what they have to do

268
0:10:48.33,000 --> 0:10:5,000
is they have to assemble the entire balloon --

269
0:10:50.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
the fabric, parachute and everything -- on the ice

270
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and then fill it up with helium.

271
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And that process takes about two hours.

272
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
And the weather can change as they're putting together this whole assembly.

273
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:03,000
For instance, here they are laying down the balloon fabric behind,

274
0:11:03.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
which is eventually going to be filled up with helium.

275
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Those two trucks you see at the very end

276
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
carry 12 tanks each of compressed helium.

277
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Now, in case the weather changes before the launch,

278
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
they have to actually pack everything back up into their boxes

279
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and take it out back to McMurdo Station.

280
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And this particular balloon,

281
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
because it has to launch two tons of weight,

282
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
is an extremely huge balloon.

283
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
The fabric alone weighs two tons.

284
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:32,000
In order to minimize the weight,

285
0:11:32.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
it's very thin, it's as thin as a sandwich wrapper.

286
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And if they have to pack it back,

287
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
they have to put it into boxes

288
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and stamp on it so that it fits into the box again --

289
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
except, when they did it first,

290
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
it would have been done in Texas.

291
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Here, they can't do it with the kind shoes they're wearing,

292
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:5,000
so they have to take their shoes off,

293
0:11:50.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
get barefoot into the boxes, in this cold,

294
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and do that kind of work.

295
0:11:54.33,000 --> 0:11:56,000
That's the kind of dedication these people have.

296
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Here's the balloon being filled up with helium,

297
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
and you can see it's a gorgeous sight.

298
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Here's a scene

299
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
that shows you the balloon and the payload end-to-end.

300
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So the balloon is being filled up with helium on the left-hand side,

301
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and the fabric actually runs all the way to the middle

302
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
where there's a piece of electronics and explosives

303
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
being connected to a parachute,

304
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and then the parachute is then connected to the payload.

305
0:12:17.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And remember, all this wiring is being done

306
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
by people in extreme cold, in sub-zero temperatures.

307
0:12:22.33,000 --> 0:12:25,000
They're wearing about 15 kg of clothing and stuff,

308
0:12:25.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
but they have to take their gloves off in order to do that.

309
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And I would like to share with you a launch.

310
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
(Video) Radio: Okay, release the balloon,

311
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
release the balloon, release the balloon.

312
0:13:04.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Anil Ananthaswamy: And I'll finally like to leave you with two images.

313
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
This is an observatory in the Himalayas, in Ladakh in India.

314
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And the thing I want you to look at here

315
0:13:12.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
is the telescope on the right-hand side.

316
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And on the far left there

317
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
is a 400 year-old Buddhist monastery.

318
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
This is a close-up of the Buddhist monastery.

319
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And I was struck by the juxtaposition

320
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
of these two enormous disciplines that humanity has.

321
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
One is exploring the cosmos on the outside,

322
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and the other one is exploring our interior being.

323
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And both require silence of some sort.

324
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And what struck me was

325
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
every place that I went to to see these telescopes,

326
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
the astronomers and cosmologists

327
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:42,000
are in search of a certain kind of silence,

328
0:13:42.33,000 --> 0:13:44,000
whether it's silence from radio pollution

329
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
or light pollution or whatever.

330
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:49,000
And it was very obvious

331
0:13:49.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
that, if we destroy these silent places on Earth,

332
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:54,000
we will be stuck on a planet without the ability to look outwards,

333
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
because we will not be able to understand the signals that come from outer space.

334
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Thank you.

335
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000

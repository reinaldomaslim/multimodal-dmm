1
0:00:12.772,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Today I'm here, actually, to pose you a question.

2
0:00:15.876,000 --> 0:00:16,000
What is life?

3
0:00:17.56,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It has been really puzzling me for more than 25 years,

4
0:00:21.247,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and will probably continue doing so for the next 25 years.

5
0:00:25.594,000 --> 0:00:29,000
This is the thesis I did when I was still in undergraduate school.

6
0:00:31.255,000 --> 0:00:37,000
While my colleagues still treated computers as big calculators,

7
0:00:38.221,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I started to teach computers to learn.

8
0:00:41.381,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I built digital lady beetles

9
0:00:44.788,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and tried to learn from real lady beetles, just to do one thing:

10
0:00:49.399,000 --> 0:00:5,000
search for food.

11
0:00:51.141,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And after very simple neural network --

12
0:00:53.939,000 --> 0:00:55,000
genetic algorithms and so on --

13
0:00:56.234,000 --> 0:00:57,000
look at the pattern.

14
0:00:57.615,000 --> 0:01:,000
They're almost identical to real life.

15
0:01:01.797,000 --> 0:01:04,000
A very striking learning experience for a twenty-year-old.

16
0:01:07.423,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Life is a learning program.

17
0:01:12.079,000 --> 0:01:15,000
When you look at all of this wonderful world,

18
0:01:15.636,000 --> 0:01:18,000
every species has its own learning program.

19
0:01:19.405,000 --> 0:01:21,000
The learning program is genome,

20
0:01:22.19,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and the code of that program is DNA.

21
0:01:26.977,000 --> 0:01:31,000
The different genomes of each species represent different survival strategies.

22
0:01:33.438,000 --> 0:01:37,000
They represent hundreds of millions of years of evolution.

23
0:01:38.699,000 --> 0:01:41,000
The interaction between every species' ancestor

24
0:01:42.515,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and the environment.

25
0:01:45.97,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I was really fascinated about the world,

26
0:01:48.433,000 --> 0:01:49,000
about the DNA,

27
0:01:49.639,000 --> 0:01:51,000
about, you know, the language of life,

28
0:01:52.606,000 --> 0:01:53,000
the program of learning.

29
0:01:54.587,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So I decided to co-found the institute to read them.

30
0:01:59.344,000 --> 0:02:,000
I read many of them.

31
0:02:01.409,000 --> 0:02:05,000
We probably read more than half of the prior animal genomes in the world.

32
0:02:06.135,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I mean, up to date.

33
0:02:09.263,000 --> 0:02:1,000
We did learn a lot.

34
0:02:11.117,000 --> 0:02:14,000
We did sequence, also, one species many, many times ...

35
0:02:15.009,000 --> 0:02:16,000
human genome.

36
0:02:16.192,000 --> 0:02:17,000
We sequenced the first Asian.

37
0:02:17.978,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I sequenced it myself many, many times,

38
0:02:20.84,000 --> 0:02:22,000
just to take advantage of that platform.

39
0:02:24.788,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Look at all those repeating base pairs:

40
0:02:27.718,000 --> 0:02:28,000
ATCG.

41
0:02:29.21,000 --> 0:02:3,000
You don't understand anything there.

42
0:02:31.148,000 --> 0:02:32,000
But look at that one base pair.

43
0:02:32.766,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Those five letters, the AGGAA.

44
0:02:35.704,000 --> 0:02:38,000
These five SNPs represent a very specific haplotype

45
0:02:39.205,000 --> 0:02:4,000
in the Tibetan population

46
0:02:41.07,000 --> 0:02:42,000
around the gene called EPAS1.

47
0:02:43.093,000 --> 0:02:44,000
That gene has been proved --

48
0:02:44.848,000 --> 0:02:45,000
it's highly selective --

49
0:02:46.135,000 --> 0:02:5,000
it's the most significant signature of positive selection of Tibetans

50
0:02:50.506,000 --> 0:02:51,000
for the higher altitude adaptation.

51
0:02:52.922,000 --> 0:02:53,000
You know what?

52
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
These five SNPs were the result of integration of Denisovans,

53
0:02:59.971,000 --> 0:03:02,000
or Denisovan-like individuals into humans.

54
0:03:04.049,000 --> 0:03:06,000
This is the reason why we need to read those genomes.

55
0:03:06.604,000 --> 0:03:07,000
To understand history,

56
0:03:08.009,000 --> 0:03:12,000
to understand what kind of learning process

57
0:03:12.131,000 --> 0:03:15,000
the genome has been through for the millions of years.

58
0:03:17.318,000 --> 0:03:19,000
By reading a genome, it can give you a lot of information --

59
0:03:20.265,000 --> 0:03:21,000
tells you the bugs in the genome --

60
0:03:21.962,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I mean, birth defects, monogenetic disorders.

61
0:03:25.166,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Reading a drop of blood

62
0:03:26.496,000 --> 0:03:28,000
could tell you why you got a fever,

63
0:03:28.628,000 --> 0:03:31,000
or it tells you which medicine and dosage needs to be used

64
0:03:31.756,000 --> 0:03:33,000
when you're sick, especially for cancer.

65
0:03:35.495,000 --> 0:03:38,000
A lot of things could be studied, but look at that:

66
0:03:38.639,000 --> 0:03:4,000
30 years ago, we were still poor in China.

67
0:03:42.928,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Only .67 percent of the Chinese adult population had diabetes.

68
0:03:47.007,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Look at now: 11 percent.

69
0:03:49.697,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Genetics cannot change over 30 years --

70
0:03:52.849,000 --> 0:03:53,000
only one generation.

71
0:03:54.725,000 --> 0:03:55,000
It must be something different.

72
0:03:56.376,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Diet?

73
0:03:57.598,000 --> 0:03:58,000
The environment?

74
0:03:59.372,000 --> 0:04:,000
Lifestyle?

75
0:04:01.219,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Even identical twins could develop totally differently.

76
0:04:06.879,000 --> 0:04:08,000
It could be one becomes very obese, the other is not.

77
0:04:10.854,000 --> 0:04:12,000
One develops a cancer and the other does not.

78
0:04:13.38,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Not mentioning living in a very stressed environment.

79
0:04:19.386,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I moved to Shenzhen 10 years ago ...

80
0:04:22.005,000 --> 0:04:24,000
for some reason, people may know.

81
0:04:25.789,000 --> 0:04:26,000
If the gene's under stress,

82
0:04:27.752,000 --> 0:04:28,000
it behaves totally differently.

83
0:04:30.683,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Life is a journey.

84
0:04:32.637,000 --> 0:04:34,000
A gene is just a starting point,

85
0:04:35.169,000 --> 0:04:36,000
not the end.

86
0:04:37.106,000 --> 0:04:41,000
You have this statistical risk of certain diseases when you are born.

87
0:04:42.212,000 --> 0:04:45,000
But every day you make different choices,

88
0:04:45.799,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and those choices will increase or decrease the risk of certain diseases.

89
0:04:51.248,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But do you know where you are on the curve?

90
0:04:54.263,000 --> 0:04:56,000
What's the past curve look like?

91
0:04:56.779,000 --> 0:04:58,000
What kind of decisions are you facing every day?

92
0:04:59.581,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And what kind of decision is the right one

93
0:05:02.072,000 --> 0:05:06,000
to make your own right curve over your life journey?

94
0:05:07.265,000 --> 0:05:08,000
What's that?

95
0:05:09.14,000 --> 0:05:1,000
The only thing you cannot change,

96
0:05:11.133,000 --> 0:05:13,000
you cannot reverse back,

97
0:05:13.338,000 --> 0:05:14,000
is time.

98
0:05:14.59,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Probably not yet; maybe in the future.

99
0:05:16.615,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Laughter)

100
0:05:17.749,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Well, you cannot change the decision you've made,

101
0:05:20.592,000 --> 0:05:21,000
but can we do something there?

102
0:05:22.463,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Can we actually try to run multiple options on me,

103
0:05:27.589,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and try to predict right on the consequence,

104
0:05:31.172,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and be able to make the right choice?

105
0:05:33.973,000 --> 0:05:34,000
After all,

106
0:05:35.169,000 --> 0:05:36,000
we are our choices.

107
0:05:38.233,000 --> 0:05:4,000
These lady beetles came to me afterwards.

108
0:05:41.462,000 --> 0:05:44,000
25 years ago, I made the digital lady beetles

109
0:05:44.949,000 --> 0:05:45,000
to try to simulate real lady beetles.

110
0:05:47.323,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Can I make a digital me ...

111
0:05:49.717,000 --> 0:05:5,000
to simulate me?

112
0:05:51.775,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I understand the neural network could become

113
0:05:54.36,000 --> 0:05:57,000
much more sophisticated and complicated there.

114
0:05:57.47,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Can I make that one,

115
0:05:59.048,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and try to run multiple options on that digital me --

116
0:06:02.954,000 --> 0:06:03,000
to compute that?

117
0:06:04.845,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Then I could live in different universes,

118
0:06:07.832,000 --> 0:06:09,000
in parallel, at the same time.

119
0:06:10.968,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Then I would choose whatever is good for me.

120
0:06:14.063,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I probably have the most comprehensive digital me on the planet.

121
0:06:17.929,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I've spent a lot of dollars on me, on myself.

122
0:06:21.807,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And the digital me told me I have a genetic risk of gout

123
0:06:27.037,000 --> 0:06:28,000
by all of those things there.

124
0:06:29.074,000 --> 0:06:31,000
You need different technology to do that.

125
0:06:31.209,000 --> 0:06:32,000
You need the proteins, genes,

126
0:06:32.803,000 --> 0:06:34,000
you need metabolized antibodies,

127
0:06:35.353,000 --> 0:06:37,000
you need to screen all your body

128
0:06:37.869,000 --> 0:06:4,000
about the bacterias and viruses covering you, or in you.

129
0:06:41.517,000 --> 0:06:43,000
You need to have all the smart devices there --

130
0:06:44.329,000 --> 0:06:47,000
smart cars, smart house, smart tables,

131
0:06:47.769,000 --> 0:06:5,000
smart watch, smart phone to track all of your activities there.

132
0:06:51.122,000 --> 0:06:52,000
The environment is important --

133
0:06:52.623,000 --> 0:06:53,000
everything's important --

134
0:06:53.868,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and don't forget the smart toilet.

135
0:06:55.638,000 --> 0:06:56,000
(Laughter)

136
0:06:56.693,000 --> 0:06:57,000
It's such a waste, right?

137
0:06:58.491,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Every day, so much invaluable information just has been flushed into the water.

138
0:07:04.616,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And you need them.

139
0:07:05.876,000 --> 0:07:06,000
You need to measure all of them.

140
0:07:07.424,000 --> 0:07:09,000
You need to be able to measure everything around you

141
0:07:10.071,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and compute them.

142
0:07:11.933,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And the digital me told me I have a genetic defect.

143
0:07:16.617,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I have a very high risk of gout.

144
0:07:19.688,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I don't feel anything now,

145
0:07:21.309,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I'm still healthy.

146
0:07:22.705,000 --> 0:07:23,000
But look at my uric acid level.

147
0:07:24.23,000 --> 0:07:25,000
It's double the normal range.

148
0:07:26.739,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And the digital me searched all the medicine books,

149
0:07:29.584,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and it tells me, "OK, you could drink burdock tea" --

150
0:07:33.776,000 --> 0:07:34,000
I cannot even pronounce it right --

151
0:07:35.498,000 --> 0:07:36,000
(Laughter)

152
0:07:36.557,000 --> 0:07:37,000
That is from old Chinese wisdom.

153
0:07:38.896,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And I drank that tea for three months.

154
0:07:41.679,000 --> 0:07:43,000
My uric acid has now gone back to normal.

155
0:07:44.938,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I mean, it worked for me.

156
0:07:46.637,000 --> 0:07:48,000
All those thousands of years of wisdom worked for me.

157
0:07:49.177,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I was lucky.

158
0:07:50.684,000 --> 0:07:53,000
But I'm probably not lucky for you.

159
0:07:55.009,000 --> 0:07:57,000
All of this existing knowledge in the world

160
0:07:57.198,000 --> 0:08:02,000
cannot possibly be efficient enough or personalized enough for yourself.

161
0:08:03.692,000 --> 0:08:05,000
The only way to make that digital me work ...

162
0:08:07.244,000 --> 0:08:09,000
is to learn from yourself.

163
0:08:10.913,000 --> 0:08:12,000
You have to ask a lot of questions about yourself:

164
0:08:13.341,000 --> 0:08:14,000
"What if?" --

165
0:08:15.038,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I'm being jet-lagged now here.

166
0:08:16.865,000 --> 0:08:17,000
You don't probably see it, but I do.

167
0:08:19.893,000 --> 0:08:2,000
What if I eat less?

168
0:08:21.709,000 --> 0:08:23,000
When I took metformin, supposedly to live longer?

169
0:08:25.394,000 --> 0:08:26,000
What if I climb Mt. Everest?

170
0:08:26.765,000 --> 0:08:27,000
It's not that easy.

171
0:08:28.091,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Or run a marathon?

172
0:08:29.952,000 --> 0:08:31,000
What if I drink a bottle of mao-tai,

173
0:08:32.29,000 --> 0:08:33,000
which is a Chinese liquor,

174
0:08:33.65,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and I get really drunk?

175
0:08:34.868,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I was doing a video rehearsal last time with the folks here,

176
0:08:39.321,000 --> 0:08:4,000
when I was drunk,

177
0:08:40.614,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and I totally delivered a different speech.

178
0:08:42.727,000 --> 0:08:44,000
(Laughter)

179
0:08:45.62,000 --> 0:08:47,000
What if I work less, right?

180
0:08:47.945,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I have been less stressed, right?

181
0:08:49.851,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So that probably never happened to me,

182
0:08:51.685,000 --> 0:08:53,000
I was really stressed every day,

183
0:08:53.807,000 --> 0:08:54,000
but I hope I could be less stressed.

184
0:08:56.111,000 --> 0:08:58,000
These early studies told us,

185
0:08:58.314,000 --> 0:08:59,000
even with the same banana,

186
0:09:00.321,000 --> 0:09:02,000
we have totally different glucose-level reactions

187
0:09:03.332,000 --> 0:09:04,000
over different individuals.

188
0:09:04.742,000 --> 0:09:05,000
How about me?

189
0:09:06.236,000 --> 0:09:07,000
What is the right breakfast for me?

190
0:09:08.258,000 --> 0:09:1,000
I need to do two weeks of controlled experiments,

191
0:09:11.2,000 --> 0:09:14,000
of testing all kinds of different food ingredients on me,

192
0:09:14.969,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and check my body's reaction.

193
0:09:17.281,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And I don't know the precise nutrition for me,

194
0:09:20.422,000 --> 0:09:21,000
for myself.

195
0:09:23.013,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Then I wanted to search all the Chinese old wisdom

196
0:09:27.401,000 --> 0:09:29,000
about how I can live longer, and healthier.

197
0:09:30.709,000 --> 0:09:31,000
I did it.

198
0:09:31.961,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Some of them are really unachievable.

199
0:09:34.562,000 --> 0:09:36,000
I did this once last October,

200
0:09:37.451,000 --> 0:09:38,000
by not eating for seven days.

201
0:09:39.969,000 --> 0:09:43,000
I did a fast for seven days with six partners of mine.

202
0:09:44.598,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Look at those people.

203
0:09:45.881,000 --> 0:09:46,000
One smile.

204
0:09:47.056,000 --> 0:09:48,000
You know why he smiled?

205
0:09:48.231,000 --> 0:09:49,000
He cheated.

206
0:09:49.422,000 --> 0:09:5,000
(Laughter)

207
0:09:50.446,000 --> 0:09:53,000
He drank one cup of coffee at night,

208
0:09:53.606,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and we caught it from the data.

209
0:09:55.115,000 --> 0:09:56,000
(Laughter)

210
0:09:56.184,000 --> 0:09:58,000
We measured everything from the data.

211
0:09:58.668,000 --> 0:10:,000
We were able to track them,

212
0:10:00.906,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and we could really see --

213
0:10:02.488,000 --> 0:10:04,000
for example, my immune system,

214
0:10:04.513,000 --> 0:10:05,000
just to give you a little hint there.

215
0:10:06.299,000 --> 0:10:1,000
My immune system changed dramatically over 24 hours there.

216
0:10:11.738,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And my antibody regulates my proteins

217
0:10:14.895,000 --> 0:10:15,000
for that dramatic change.

218
0:10:16.455,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And everybody was doing that.

219
0:10:17.86,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Even if we're essentially totally different at the very beginning.

220
0:10:21.216,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And that probably will be an interesting treatment in the future

221
0:10:24.285,000 --> 0:10:25,000
for cancer and things like that.

222
0:10:25.952,000 --> 0:10:26,000
It becomes very, very interesting.

223
0:10:28.106,000 --> 0:10:3,000
But something you probably don't want to try,

224
0:10:30.831,000 --> 0:10:33,000
like drinking fecal water from a healthier individual,

225
0:10:34.531,000 --> 0:10:35,000
which will make you feel healthier.

226
0:10:36.222,000 --> 0:10:37,000
This is from old Chinese wisdom.

227
0:10:37.961,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Look at that, right?

228
0:10:39.421,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Like 1,700 years ago,

229
0:10:41.611,000 --> 0:10:43,000
it's already there, in the book.

230
0:10:44.428,000 --> 0:10:45,000
But I still hate the smell.

231
0:10:46.057,000 --> 0:10:47,000
(Laughter)

232
0:10:47.231,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I want to find out the true way to do it,

233
0:10:49.661,000 --> 0:10:53,000
maybe find a combination of cocktails of bacterias and drink it,

234
0:10:54.039,000 --> 0:10:55,000
it probably will make me better.

235
0:10:55.587,000 --> 0:10:56,000
So I'm trying to do that.

236
0:10:56.802,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Even though I'm trying this hard,

237
0:10:59.828,000 --> 0:11:04,000
it's so difficult to test out all possible conditions.

238
0:11:04.878,000 --> 0:11:09,000
It's not possible to do all kinds of experiments at all ...

239
0:11:11.161,000 --> 0:11:14,000
but we do have seven billion learning programs on this planet.

240
0:11:14.998,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Seven billion.

241
0:11:16.288,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And every program is running in different conditions

242
0:11:19.963,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and doing different experiments.

243
0:11:21.768,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Can we all measure them?

244
0:11:24.782,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Seven years ago, I wrote an essay in "Science"

245
0:11:28.021,000 --> 0:11:31,000
to celebrate the human genome's 10-year anniversary.

246
0:11:31.995,000 --> 0:11:32,000
I said, "Sequence yourself,

247
0:11:33.673,000 --> 0:11:34,000
for one and for all."

248
0:11:35.618,000 --> 0:11:36,000
But now I'm going to say,

249
0:11:37.51,000 --> 0:11:4,000
"Digitalize yourself for one and for all."

250
0:11:42.095,000 --> 0:11:47,000
When we make this digital me into a digital we,

251
0:11:47.719,000 --> 0:11:5,000
when we try to form an internet of life,

252
0:11:51.495,000 --> 0:11:53,000
when people can learn from each other,

253
0:11:54.38,000 --> 0:11:56,000
when people can learn from their experience,

254
0:11:57.111,000 --> 0:11:58,000
their data,

255
0:11:58.866,000 --> 0:12:01,000
when people can really form a digital me by themselves

256
0:12:02.491,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and we learn from it,

257
0:12:05.236,000 --> 0:12:1,000
the digital we will be totally different with a digital me.

258
0:12:10.992,000 --> 0:12:13,000
But it can only come from the digital me.

259
0:12:15.923,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And this is what I try to propose here.

260
0:12:19.941,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Join me --

261
0:12:21.764,000 --> 0:12:22,000
become we,

262
0:12:23.612,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and everybody should build up their own digital me,

263
0:12:28.574,000 --> 0:12:32,000
because only by that will you learn more about you,

264
0:12:33.117,000 --> 0:12:34,000
about me,

265
0:12:34.565,000 --> 0:12:35,000
about us ...

266
0:12:36.498,000 --> 0:12:39,000
about the question I just posed at the very beginning:

267
0:12:40.202,000 --> 0:12:41,000
"What is life?"

268
0:12:41.886,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Thank you.

269
0:12:43.079,000 --> 0:12:48,000
(Applause)

270
0:12:49.053,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Chris Anderson: One quick question for you.

271
0:12:52.638,000 --> 0:12:53,000
I mean, the work is amazing.

272
0:12:54.636,000 --> 0:12:57,000
I suspect one question people have is,

273
0:12:57.858,000 --> 0:13:,000
as we look forward to these amazing technical possibilities

274
0:13:01.163,000 --> 0:13:02,000
of personalized medicine,

275
0:13:02.548,000 --> 0:13:05,000
in the near-term it feels like they're only going to be affordable

276
0:13:05.875,000 --> 0:13:06,000
for a few people, right?

277
0:13:07.175,000 --> 0:13:09,000
It costs many dollars to do all the sequencing and so forth.

278
0:13:10.709,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Is this going to lead to a kind of,

279
0:13:13.645,000 --> 0:13:15,000
you know, increasing inequality?

280
0:13:15.986,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Or do you have this vision that the knowledge that you get

281
0:13:19.921,000 --> 0:13:2,000
from the pioneers

282
0:13:21.297,000 --> 0:13:23,000
can actually be pretty quickly disseminated

283
0:13:23.417,000 --> 0:13:27,000
to help a broader set of recipients?

284
0:13:27.565,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Jun Wang: Well, good question.

285
0:13:29.123,000 --> 0:13:32,000
I'll tell you that seven years ago, when I co-founded BGI,

286
0:13:32.698,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and served as the CEO of the company there,

287
0:13:36.127,000 --> 0:13:38,000
the only goal there for me to do

288
0:13:38.532,000 --> 0:13:39,000
was to drive the sequencing cost down.

289
0:13:40.864,000 --> 0:13:42,000
It started from 100 million dollars per human genome.

290
0:13:43.663,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Now, it's a couple hundred dollars for a human genome.

291
0:13:46.278,000 --> 0:13:49,000
The only reason to do it is to get more people to benefit from it.

292
0:13:50.198,000 --> 0:13:52,000
So for the digital me, it's the same thing.

293
0:13:52.379,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Now, you probably need,

294
0:13:53.892,000 --> 0:13:56,000
you know, one million dollars to digitize a person.

295
0:13:57.621,000 --> 0:13:58,000
I think it has to be 100 dollars.

296
0:13:59.807,000 --> 0:14:03,000
It has to be free for many of those people that urgently need that.

297
0:14:04.192,000 --> 0:14:05,000
So this is our goal.

298
0:14:05.813,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And it seems that with all this merging of the technology,

299
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
I'm thinking that in the very near future,

300
0:14:11.876,000 --> 0:14:13,000
let's say three to five years,

301
0:14:14.265,000 --> 0:14:15,000
it will come to reality.

302
0:14:15.771,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And this is the whole idea of why I founded iCarbonX,

303
0:14:19.774,000 --> 0:14:2,000
my second company.

304
0:14:21.017,000 --> 0:14:23,000
It's really trying to get the cost down

305
0:14:23.909,000 --> 0:14:26,000
to a level where every individual could have the benefit.

306
0:14:27.353,000 --> 0:14:3,000
CA: All right, so the dream is not elite health services for few,

307
0:14:30.425,000 --> 0:14:31,000
it's to really try

308
0:14:31.683,000 --> 0:14:34,000
and actually make overall health care much more cost effective --

309
0:14:34.818,000 --> 0:14:36,000
JW: But we started from some early adopters,

310
0:14:37.272,000 --> 0:14:39,000
people believing ideas and so on,

311
0:14:39.802,000 --> 0:14:42,000
but eventually, it will become everybody's benefit.

312
0:14:44.123,000 --> 0:14:46,000
CA: Well, Jun, I think it's got to be true to say

313
0:14:46.48,000 --> 0:14:48,000
you're one of the most amazing scientific minds on the planet,

314
0:14:49.462,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and it's an honor to have you.

315
0:14:50.915,000 --> 0:14:51,000
JW: Thank you.

316
0:14:52.097,000 --> 0:14:53,000
(Applause)

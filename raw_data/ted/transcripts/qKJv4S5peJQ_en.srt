1
0:00:12.58,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Paying close attention to something:

2
0:00:15.1,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Not that easy, is it?

3
0:00:17.34,000 --> 0:00:22,000
It's because our attention is pulled in so many different directions at a time,

4
0:00:22.38,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and it's in fact pretty impressive if you can stay focused.

5
0:00:28.18,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Many people think that attention is all about what we are focusing on,

6
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
but it's also about what information our brain is trying to filter out.

7
0:00:38.14,000 --> 0:00:4,000
There are two ways you direct your attention.

8
0:00:41.42,000 --> 0:00:42,000
First, there's overt attention.

9
0:00:43.46,000 --> 0:00:47,000
In overt attention, you move your eyes towards something

10
0:00:47.62,000 --> 0:00:48,000
in order to pay attention to it.

11
0:00:50.18,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Then there's covert attention.

12
0:00:52.18,000 --> 0:00:56,000
In covert attention, you pay attention to something,

13
0:00:56.22,000 --> 0:00:57,000
but without moving your eyes.

14
0:00:58.86,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Think of driving for a second.

15
0:01:02.78,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Your overt attention, your direction of the eyes,

16
0:01:05.82,000 --> 0:01:06,000
are in front,

17
0:01:07.5,000 --> 0:01:08,000
but that's your covert attention

18
0:01:09.3,000 --> 0:01:12,000
which is constantly scanning the surrounding area,

19
0:01:13.42,000 --> 0:01:14,000
where you don't actually look at them.

20
0:01:17.339,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I'm a computational neuroscientist,

21
0:01:19.3,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and I work on cognitive brain-machine interfaces,

22
0:01:22.42,000 --> 0:01:25,000
or bringing together the brain and the computer.

23
0:01:26.54,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I love brain patterns.

24
0:01:28.54,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Brain patterns are important for us

25
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
because based on them we can build models for the computers,

26
0:01:33.78,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and based on these models

27
0:01:35.22,000 --> 0:01:39,000
computers can recognize how well our brain functions.

28
0:01:39.46,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And if it doesn't function well,

29
0:01:41.9,000 --> 0:01:44,000
then these computers themselves can be used as assistive devices

30
0:01:46.58,000 --> 0:01:47,000
for therapies.

31
0:01:48.3,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But that also means something,

32
0:01:51.18,000 --> 0:01:53,000
because choosing the wrong patterns

33
0:01:53.7,000 --> 0:01:54,000
will give us the wrong models

34
0:01:55.62,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and therefore the wrong therapies.

35
0:01:57.3,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Right?

36
0:01:59.46,000 --> 0:02:,000
In case of attention,

37
0:02:01.14,000 --> 0:02:02,000
the fact that we can

38
0:02:03.62,000 --> 0:02:06,000
shift our attention not only by our eyes

39
0:02:07.14,000 --> 0:02:08,000
but also by thinking --

40
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that makes covert attention an interesting model for computers.

41
0:02:14.1,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So I wanted to know what are the brainwave patterns

42
0:02:17.58,000 --> 0:02:2,000
when you look overtly or when you look covertly.

43
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I set up an experiment for that.

44
0:02:24.78,000 --> 0:02:26,000
In this experiment there are two flickering squares,

45
0:02:27.54,000 --> 0:02:3,000
one of them flickering at a slower rate than the other one.

46
0:02:32.42,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Depending on which of these flickers you are paying attention to,

47
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
certain parts of your brain will start resonating in the same rate

48
0:02:41.02,000 --> 0:02:42,000
as that flickering rate.

49
0:02:43.82,000 --> 0:02:45,000
So by analyzing your brain signals,

50
0:02:46.78,000 --> 0:02:49,000
we can track where exactly you are watching

51
0:02:50.58,000 --> 0:02:51,000
or you are paying attention to.

52
0:02:54.82,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So to see what happens in your brain when you pay overt attention,

53
0:02:59.06,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I asked people to look directly in one of the squares

54
0:03:02.34,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and pay attention to it.

55
0:03:04.58,000 --> 0:03:09,000
In this case, not surprisingly, we saw that these flickering squares

56
0:03:09.9,000 --> 0:03:1,000
appeared in their brain signals

57
0:03:11.86,000 --> 0:03:13,000
which was coming from the back of their head,

58
0:03:15.38,000 --> 0:03:18,000
which is responsible for the processing of your visual information.

59
0:03:20.1,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But I was really interested

60
0:03:22.46,000 --> 0:03:25,000
to see what happens in your brain when you pay covert attention.

61
0:03:26.3,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So this time I asked people to look in the middle of the screen

62
0:03:30.22,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and without moving their eyes,

63
0:03:32.94,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to pay attention to either of these squares.

64
0:03:36.94,000 --> 0:03:37,000
When we did that,

65
0:03:38.58,000 --> 0:03:41,000
we saw that both of these flickering rates appeared in their brain signals,

66
0:03:42.54,000 --> 0:03:43,000
but interestingly,

67
0:03:44.46,000 --> 0:03:47,000
only one of them, which was paid attention to,

68
0:03:48.02,000 --> 0:03:49,000
had stronger signals,

69
0:03:49.7,000 --> 0:03:51,000
so there was something in the brain

70
0:03:51.98,000 --> 0:03:53,000
which was handling this information

71
0:03:54.54,000 --> 0:04:,000
so that thing in the brain was basically the activation of the frontal area.

72
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
The front part of your brain is responsible

73
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
for higher cognitive functions as a human.

74
0:04:08.98,000 --> 0:04:12,000
The frontal part, it seems that it works as a filter

75
0:04:14.46,000 --> 0:04:18,000
trying to let information come in only from the right flicker

76
0:04:18.86,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that you are paying attention to

77
0:04:21.22,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and trying to inhibit the information coming from the ignored one.

78
0:04:27.22,000 --> 0:04:32,000
The filtering ability of the brain is indeed a key for attention,

79
0:04:32.54,000 --> 0:04:34,000
which is missing in some people,

80
0:04:35.34,000 --> 0:04:37,000
for example in people with ADHD.

81
0:04:38.46,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So a person with ADHD cannot inhibit these distractors,

82
0:04:43.5,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and that's why they can't focus for a long time on a single task.

83
0:04:49.42,000 --> 0:04:5,000
But what if this person

84
0:04:50.98,000 --> 0:04:53,000
could play a specific computer game

85
0:04:54.54,000 --> 0:04:56,000
with his brain connected to the computer,

86
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
and then train his own brain

87
0:05:01.18,000 --> 0:05:03,000
to inhibit these distractors?

88
0:05:05.5,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Well, ADHD is just one example.

89
0:05:09.02,000 --> 0:05:12,000
We can use these cognitive brain-machine interfaces

90
0:05:12.3,000 --> 0:05:14,000
for many other cognitive fields.

91
0:05:15.58,000 --> 0:05:16,000
It was just a few years ago

92
0:05:17.38,000 --> 0:05:22,000
that my grandfather had a stroke, and he lost complete ability to speak.

93
0:05:24.46,000 --> 0:05:27,000
He could understand everybody, but there was no way to respond,

94
0:05:27.82,000 --> 0:05:29,000
even not writing because he was illiterate.

95
0:05:31.82,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So he passed away in silence.

96
0:05:36.62,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I remember thinking at that time:

97
0:05:38.98,000 --> 0:05:41,000
What if we could have a computer

98
0:05:42.9,000 --> 0:05:43,000
which could speak for him?

99
0:05:45.66,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Now, after years that I am in this field,

100
0:05:47.9,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I can see that this might be possible.

101
0:05:52.06,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Imagine if we can find brainwave patterns

102
0:05:54.94,000 --> 0:05:57,000
when people think about images or even letters,

103
0:05:59.54,000 --> 0:06:01,000
like the letter A generates a different brainwave pattern

104
0:06:02.5,000 --> 0:06:03,000
than the letter B, and so on.

105
0:06:04.78,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Could a computer one day communicate for people who can't speak?

106
0:06:09.46,000 --> 0:06:1,000
What if a computer

107
0:06:11.78,000 --> 0:06:15,000
can help us understand the thoughts of a person in a coma?

108
0:06:17.66,000 --> 0:06:18,000
We are not there yet,

109
0:06:19.3,000 --> 0:06:21,000
but pay close attention.

110
0:06:22.06,000 --> 0:06:23,000
We will be there soon.

111
0:06:23.78,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Thank you.

112
0:06:25.3,000 --> 0:06:3,000
(Applause)

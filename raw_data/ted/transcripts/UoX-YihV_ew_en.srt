1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So, if you're in the audience today,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
or maybe you're watching this talk in some other time or place,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
you are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Whether you're an artist, a technologist,

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
a lawyer or a fan,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
the handling of copyright directly impacts your life.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Rights management is no longer

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
simply a question of ownership,

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
it's a complex web of relationships

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and a critical part of our cultural landscape.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
YouTube cares deeply about the rights of content owners,

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
but in order to give them choices about what they can do

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
with copies, mashups and more,

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
we need to first identify

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
when copyrighted material is uploaded to our site.

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Let's look at a specific video so you can see how it works.

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Two years ago, recording artist Chris Brown

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
released the official video of his single "Forever."

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
A fan saw it on TV,

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
recorded it with her camera phone,

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and uploaded it to YouTube.

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Because Sony Music had registered Chris Brown's video

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
in our Content ID system,

24
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
within seconds of attempting to upload the video,

25
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
the copy was detected,

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
giving Sony the choice of what to do next.

27
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
But how do we know that the user's video was a copy?

28
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Well, it starts with content owners

29
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
delivering assets into our database,

30
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
along with a usage policy

31
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that tells us what to do when we find a match.

32
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
We compare each upload

33
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
against all of the reference files in our database.

34
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
This heat map is going to show you

35
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
how the brain of the system works.

36
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Here we can see the original reference file

37
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
being compared to the user generated content.

38
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
The system compares every moment

39
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
of one to the other to see if there's a match.

40
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
This means that we can identify a match

41
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
even if the copy used is just a portion of the original file,

42
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
plays it in slow motion

43
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and has degraded audio and video quality.

44
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And we do this every time

45
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that a video is uploaded to YouTube.

46
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And that's over 20 hours of video every minute.

47
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
When we find a match,

48
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
we apply the policy that the rights owner has set down.

49
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And the scale and the speed of this system

50
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
is truly breathtaking.

51
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
We're not just talking about a few videos,

52
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
we're talking about over

53
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
100 years of video every day,

54
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
between new uploads and the legacy scans

55
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
we regularly do across all of the content on the site.

56
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
When we compare those hundred years of video,

57
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
we're comparing it against millions

58
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
of reference files in our database.

59
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
It would be like 36,000 people

60
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
staring at 36,000 monitors

61
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
each and every day, without so much as a coffee break.

62
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Now, what do we do when we find a match?

63
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Well, most rights owners, instead of blocking,

64
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
will allow the copy to be published.

65
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And then they benefit through the exposure,

66
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
advertising and linked sales.

67
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Remember Chris Brown's video "Forever"?

68
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Well, it had its day in the sun and then it dropped off the charts,

69
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and that looked like the end of the story,

70
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
but sometime last year, a young couple got married.

71
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
This is their wedding video.

72
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
You may have seen it.

73
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
(Music)

74
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
What's amazing about this is,

75
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
if the processional of the wedding was this much fun,

76
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
can you imagine how much fun the reception must have been?

77
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I mean, who are these people?

78
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I totally want to go to that wedding.

79
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So their little wedding video went on

80
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
to get over 40 million views.

81
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And instead of Sony blocking,

82
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
they allowed the upload to occur.

83
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And they put advertising against it

84
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and linked from it to iTunes.

85
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And the song, 18 months old,

86
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
went back to number four on the iTunes charts.

87
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So Sony is generating revenue from both of these.

88
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And Jill and Kevin, the happy couple,

89
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
they came back from their honeymoon

90
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and found that their video had gone crazy viral.

91
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And they've ended up on a bunch of talk shows,

92
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
and they've used it as an opportunity to make a difference.

93
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
The video's inspired over 26,000 dollars in donations

94
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
to end domestic violence.

95
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
The "JK Wedding [Entrance] Dance" became so popular

96
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that NBC parodied it on the season finale of "The Office,"

97
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
which just goes to show,

98
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
it's truly an ecosystem of culture.

99
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Because it's not just amateurs borrowing from big studios,

100
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
but sometimes big studios borrowing back.

101
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
By empowering choice, we can create a culture of opportunity.

102
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And all it took to change things around

103
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
was to allow for choice through rights identification.

104
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So why has no one ever solved this problem before?

105
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
It's because it's a big problem,

106
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and it's complicated and messy.

107
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
It's not uncommon for a single video

108
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
to have multiple rights owners.

109
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
There's musical labels.

110
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
There's multiple music publishers.

111
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And each of these can vary by country.

112
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
There's lots of cases

113
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
where we have more than one work mashed together.

114
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So we have to manage many claims

115
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to the same video.

116
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
YouTube's Content ID system addresses all of these cases.

117
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
But the system only works through

118
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
the participation of rights owners.

119
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
If you have content that others are uploading to YouTube,

120
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
you should register in the Content ID system,

121
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and then you'll have the choice

122
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
about how your content is used.

123
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And think carefully about the policies that you attach to that content.

124
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
By simply blocking all reuse,

125
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
you'll miss out on new art forms,

126
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
new audiences,

127
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
new distribution channels

128
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and new revenue streams.

129
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
But it's not just about dollars and impressions.

130
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Just look at all the joy

131
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that was spread through progressive rights management

132
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and new technology.

133
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And I think we can all agree that joy is definitely an idea worth spreading.

134
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Thank you.

135
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
(Applause)

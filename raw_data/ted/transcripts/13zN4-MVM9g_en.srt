1
0:00:13.25,000 --> 0:00:15,000
By October 2018,

2
0:00:15.417,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Juan Carlos Rivera could no longer afford

3
0:00:18.833,000 --> 0:00:2,000
to live in his home in Copan, Honduras.

4
0:00:22.333,000 --> 0:00:23,000
As the "Dallas Morning News" reported,

5
0:00:24.25,000 --> 0:00:28,000
a gang was taking 10 percent of his earnings from his barber shop.

6
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:33,000
His wife was assaulted going to her pre-K teaching job.

7
0:00:33.333,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And they were concerned about the safety of their young daughter.

8
0:00:36.75,000 --> 0:00:37,000
What could they do?

9
0:00:38.583,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Run away?

10
0:00:39.875,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Seek asylum in another country?

11
0:00:42.333,000 --> 0:00:43,000
They didn't want to do that.

12
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:47,000
They just wanted to live in their country safely.

13
0:00:47.875,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But their options were limited.

14
0:00:49.833,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So that month,

15
0:00:51.125,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Juan Carlos moved his family to a safer location

16
0:00:54.875,000 --> 0:00:58,000
while he joined a group of migrants on the long and perilous journey

17
0:00:59.583,000 --> 0:01:,000
from Central America

18
0:01:01.458,000 --> 0:01:07,000
to a job a family member said was open for him in the United States.

19
0:01:07.833,000 --> 0:01:09,000
By now we're all familiar with what awaited them

20
0:01:10.417,000 --> 0:01:12,000
at the US-Mexico border.

21
0:01:12.75,000 --> 0:01:16,000
The harsher and harsher penalties doled out to those crossing there.

22
0:01:16.792,000 --> 0:01:19,000
The criminal prosecutions for crossing illegally.

23
0:01:20.208,000 --> 0:01:21,000
The inhumane detention.

24
0:01:22.208,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And most terribly, separation of families.

25
0:01:26.375,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I'm here to tell you that not only is this treatment wrong,

26
0:01:29.708,000 --> 0:01:3,000
it's unnecessary.

27
0:01:31.667,000 --> 0:01:35,000
This belief that the only way to maintain order

28
0:01:36.125,000 --> 0:01:38,000
is with inhumane means

29
0:01:38.708,000 --> 0:01:39,000
is inaccurate.

30
0:01:40.167,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And in fact, the opposite is true.

31
0:01:43.833,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Only a humane system will create order at the border.

32
0:01:51.167,000 --> 0:01:56,000
When safe, orderly, legal travel to the United States is available,

33
0:01:56.708,000 --> 0:01:59,000
very few people choose travel that is unsafe,

34
0:02:00.083,000 --> 0:02:02,000
disorderly or illegal.

35
0:02:03.292,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Now, I appreciate the idea

36
0:02:04.792,000 --> 0:02:08,000
that legal immigration could just resolve the border crisis

37
0:02:09.333,000 --> 0:02:11,000
might sound a bit fanciful.

38
0:02:11.792,000 --> 0:02:12,000
But here is the good news:

39
0:02:13.75,000 --> 0:02:15,000
We have done this before.

40
0:02:17.042,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I've been working on immigration for years

41
0:02:19.25,000 --> 0:02:2,000
at the Cato Institute

42
0:02:20.958,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and other think tanks in Washington DC

43
0:02:23.458,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and as the senior policy adviser for a republican member of Congress,

44
0:02:27.167,000 --> 0:02:31,000
negotiating bipartisan immigration reform.

45
0:02:31.792,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And I've seen firsthand

46
0:02:33.667,000 --> 0:02:38,000
how America has implemented a system of humane order at the border

47
0:02:39.25,000 --> 0:02:4,000
for Mexico.

48
0:02:41.125,000 --> 0:02:43,000
It's called a guest worker program.

49
0:02:44.333,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And here's the even better news.

50
0:02:46.333,000 --> 0:02:5,000
We can replicate this success for Central America.

51
0:02:51.542,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Of course, some people

52
0:02:53.458,000 --> 0:02:56,000
will still need to seek asylum at the border.

53
0:02:56.833,000 --> 0:03:,000
But to understand how successful

54
0:03:01.125,000 --> 0:03:04,000
this could be for immigrants like Juan Carlos,

55
0:03:04.792,000 --> 0:03:06,000
understand that until recently,

56
0:03:07.208,000 --> 0:03:12,000
nearly every immigrant arrested by Border Patrol was Mexican.

57
0:03:13.583,000 --> 0:03:15,000
In 1986,

58
0:03:16.083,000 --> 0:03:21,000
each Border Patrol agent arrested 510 Mexicans.

59
0:03:22.042,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Well over one per day.

60
0:03:24.667,000 --> 0:03:26,000
By 2019, this number was just eight.

61
0:03:27.625,000 --> 0:03:29,000
That's one every 43 days.

62
0:03:30.292,000 --> 0:03:32,000
It is a 98 percent reduction.

63
0:03:34.75,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So where have all the Mexicans gone?

64
0:03:38.25,000 --> 0:03:4,000
The most significant change

65
0:03:40.583,000 --> 0:03:42,000
is that the US began issuing

66
0:03:42.875,000 --> 0:03:46,000
hundreds of thousands of guest worker visas to Mexicans,

67
0:03:47.125,000 --> 0:03:49,000
so that they can come legally.

68
0:03:49.875,000 --> 0:03:53,000
José Vásquez Cabrera was among the first Mexican guest workers

69
0:03:54.833,000 --> 0:03:56,000
to take advantage of this visa expansion.

70
0:03:58.458,000 --> 0:04:01,000
He told "The New York Times" that before his visa

71
0:04:01.917,000 --> 0:04:04,000
he'd made terrifying illegal border crossings,

72
0:04:05.875,000 --> 0:04:08,000
braving near deadly heat and the treachery of the landscape.

73
0:04:10.458,000 --> 0:04:15,000
One time, a snake killed a member of his group.

74
0:04:16.958,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Thousands of other Mexicans also didn't make it,

75
0:04:20.417,000 --> 0:04:24,000
dying of dehydration in the deserts or drowning in the Rio Grande.

76
0:04:24.708,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Millions more were chased down and arrested.

77
0:04:28.917,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Guest worker visas have nearly ended this inhumane chaos.

78
0:04:33.875,000 --> 0:04:35,000
As Vásquez Cabrera put it,

79
0:04:36.458,000 --> 0:04:39,000
"I no longer have to risk my life

80
0:04:39.75,000 --> 0:04:4,000
to support my family.

81
0:04:41.75,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And when I'm here, I don't have to live in hiding."

82
0:04:45.5,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Guest worker visas actually reduced the number of illegal crossings

83
0:04:49.708,000 --> 0:04:51,000
more than the number of visas issued.

84
0:04:53.25,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Jose Bacilio, another Mexican guest worker, explained why

85
0:04:57.083,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to the "Washington Post" in April.

86
0:04:59.667,000 --> 0:05:04,000
He said, even though he hadn't received a visa this year,

87
0:05:04.875,000 --> 0:05:07,000
he wouldn't risk all of his future chances

88
0:05:08.667,000 --> 0:05:09,000
by crossing illegally.

89
0:05:11.417,000 --> 0:05:13,000
This likely helps explain why

90
0:05:14.042,000 --> 0:05:17,000
from 1996 to 2019

91
0:05:17.542,000 --> 0:05:21,000
for every guest worker admitted legally from Mexico,

92
0:05:22.5,000 --> 0:05:27,000
there was a decline in two arrests of Mexicans crossing illegally.

93
0:05:28.875,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Now, it's true,

94
0:05:30.375,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Mexican guest workers do some really tough jobs.

95
0:05:34.917,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Picking fruit, cleaning crabs,

96
0:05:37.667,000 --> 0:05:39,000
landscaping in a 100-degree heat.

97
0:05:40.792,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And some critics maintain that guest worker visas

98
0:05:43.792,000 --> 0:05:45,000
are not actually humane

99
0:05:45.958,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and that the workers are just abused slaves.

100
0:05:49.333,000 --> 0:05:54,000
But Vásquez Cabrera thought a guest worker visa was liberating.

101
0:05:55.292,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Not enslavement.

102
0:05:57.042,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And he, like nearly all other guest workers,

103
0:05:59.833,000 --> 0:06:04,000
chose the legal path over the illegal one, repeatedly.

104
0:06:07.292,000 --> 0:06:11,000
The expansion of guest worker visas to Mexicans

105
0:06:11.625,000 --> 0:06:15,000
has been among the most significant humane changes

106
0:06:16.458,000 --> 0:06:18,000
in US immigration policy ever.

107
0:06:20.25,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And that humane change

108
0:06:22.625,000 --> 0:06:25,000
imposed order on chaos.

109
0:06:27.625,000 --> 0:06:3,000
So where does this leave Central Americans,

110
0:06:31.458,000 --> 0:06:32,000
like Juan Carlos?

111
0:06:34.333,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Well, Central Americans received

112
0:06:36.625,000 --> 0:06:42,000
just three percent of the guest worker visas issued in 2019,

113
0:06:42.875,000 --> 0:06:47,000
even as their share of border arrests has risen to 74 percent.

114
0:06:49.25,000 --> 0:06:54,000
The US issued just one guest worker visa to a Central American

115
0:06:54.333,000 --> 0:06:59,000
for every 78 who crossed the border illegally in 2019.

116
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So if they can't get their papers at home,

117
0:07:04.417,000 --> 0:07:06,000
many take their chances,

118
0:07:06.833,000 --> 0:07:09,000
coming up through Mexico to claim asylum at the border

119
0:07:10.375,000 --> 0:07:11,000
or cross illegally,

120
0:07:12.042,000 --> 0:07:15,000
even if, like Juan Carlos, they prefer to come to work.

121
0:07:16.75,000 --> 0:07:18,000
The US can do better.

122
0:07:19.5,000 --> 0:07:22,000
It needs to create new guest worker visas

123
0:07:23.208,000 --> 0:07:25,000
specifically for Central Americans.

124
0:07:26.667,000 --> 0:07:28,000
This would create an incentive for US businesses

125
0:07:29.5,000 --> 0:07:32,000
to seek out and hire Central Americans,

126
0:07:32.75,000 --> 0:07:35,000
paying for their flights to the United States,

127
0:07:35.792,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and diverting them from the illegal, dangerous trek north.

128
0:07:40.708,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Central Americans could build flourishing lives at home,

129
0:07:44.583,000 --> 0:07:46,000
without the need to seek asylum at the border

130
0:07:47.167,000 --> 0:07:48,000
or cross illegally,

131
0:07:48.458,000 --> 0:07:5,000
freeing up an overwhelmed system.

132
0:07:52.417,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Some people might say

133
0:07:54.292,000 --> 0:07:57,000
that letting the workers go back and forth

134
0:07:57.375,000 --> 0:07:59,000
will never work in Central America

135
0:08:00.125,000 --> 0:08:01,000
where violence is so high.

136
0:08:02.917,000 --> 0:08:05,000
But again, it worked in Mexico,

137
0:08:06.25,000 --> 0:08:11,000
even as Mexico's murder rate more than tripled over the last decade,

138
0:08:11.292,000 --> 0:08:14,000
to a level higher than much of Central America.

139
0:08:15.833,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And it would work for Juan Carlos,

140
0:08:18.417,000 --> 0:08:2,000
who said, despite the threats

141
0:08:20.625,000 --> 0:08:23,000
he only wants to live in the United States temporarily,

142
0:08:24.5,000 --> 0:08:25,000
to make enough money

143
0:08:25.792,000 --> 0:08:27,000
to sustain his family in their new home.

144
0:08:29.25,000 --> 0:08:33,000
He even suggested that a guest worker program

145
0:08:33.375,000 --> 0:08:36,000
would be one of the best things to help Hondurans like him.

146
0:08:38.5,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Cintia, a 29-year-old single mother of three from Honduras,

147
0:08:45.167,000 --> 0:08:46,000
seems to agree.

148
0:08:46.833,000 --> 0:08:5,000
She told the "Wall Street Journal" that she came for a job

149
0:08:51.083,000 --> 0:08:53,000
to support her kids and her mom.

150
0:08:54.708,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Surveys of Central Americans traveling through Mexico,

151
0:08:58.625,000 --> 0:09:,000
by the College of the Northern Border in Mexico,

152
0:09:01.542,000 --> 0:09:05,000
confirm that Juan and Cintia are the norm.

153
0:09:06.792,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Most, not all, but most do come for jobs,

154
0:09:10.833,000 --> 0:09:12,000
even if, like the Riveras,

155
0:09:12.958,000 --> 0:09:15,000
they may also face some real threats at home.

156
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:22,000
How much would a low-wage job help

157
0:09:22.333,000 --> 0:09:24,000
a Honduran, like Juan or Cintia?

158
0:09:25.833,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Hondurans like them make as much

159
0:09:29.583,000 --> 0:09:32,000
in one month in the United States

160
0:09:32.917,000 --> 0:09:37,000
as they do in an entire year working in Honduras.

161
0:09:39.417,000 --> 0:09:41,000
A few years' work in the United States

162
0:09:41.833,000 --> 0:09:45,000
can propel a Central American into its upper middle class

163
0:09:46.25,000 --> 0:09:48,000
where safety is easier to come by.

164
0:09:49.375,000 --> 0:09:52,000
What Central Americans lack is not the desire to work.

165
0:09:53.167,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Not the desire to contribute to the US economy,

166
0:09:57.083,000 --> 0:10:,000
to contribute to the lives of Americans.

167
0:10:00.708,000 --> 0:10:04,000
What Central Americans lack is a legal alternative to asylum.

168
0:10:05.125,000 --> 0:10:06,000
To be able to do so legally.

169
0:10:08.458,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Of course, a new guest worker program

170
0:10:11.333,000 --> 0:10:16,000
will not resolve 100 percent of this complex phenomenon.

171
0:10:18.375,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Many asylum seekers will still need to seek safety

172
0:10:22.75,000 --> 0:10:23,000
at the US border.

173
0:10:24.917,000 --> 0:10:25,000
But with the flows reduced,

174
0:10:26.75,000 --> 0:10:29,000
we can more easily work out ways to deal with them humanely.

175
0:10:31.667,000 --> 0:10:32,000
But ultimately,

176
0:10:33.292,000 --> 0:10:38,000
no single policy has proven to do more

177
0:10:38.333,000 --> 0:10:42,000
to create an immigration system that is both humane

178
0:10:42.958,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and orderly

179
0:10:44.875,000 --> 0:10:47,000
than to let the workers come legally.

180
0:10:49.167,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Thank you.

181
0:10:50.458,000 --> 0:10:54,000

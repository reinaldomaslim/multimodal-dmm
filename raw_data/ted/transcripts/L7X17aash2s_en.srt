1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'd like you all to close your eyes, please ...

2
0:00:17.44,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and imagine yourself sitting in the middle of a large, open field

3
0:00:21.68,000 --> 0:00:22,000
with the sun setting on your right.

4
0:00:24.08,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And as the sun sets,

5
0:00:25.32,000 --> 0:00:27,000
imagine that tonight you don't just see the stars appear,

6
0:00:28.28,000 --> 0:00:3,000
but you're able to hear the stars appear

7
0:00:30.32,000 --> 0:00:32,000
with the brightest stars being the loudest notes

8
0:00:33.24,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and the hotter, bluer stars producing the higher-pitched notes.

9
0:00:37.84,000 --> 0:00:43,000
(Music)

10
0:00:59.84,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And since each constellation is made up of different types of stars,

11
0:01:03.12,000 --> 0:01:05,000
they'll each produce their own unique melody,

12
0:01:05.84,000 --> 0:01:08,000
such as Aries, the ram.

13
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:12,000
(Music)

14
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Or Orion, the hunter.

15
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
(Music)

16
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Or even Taurus, the bull.

17
0:01:20.92,000 --> 0:01:22,000
(Music)

18
0:01:26.12,000 --> 0:01:28,000
We live in a musical universe,

19
0:01:28.52,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and we can use that to experience it from a new perspective,

20
0:01:32.08,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and to share that perspective with a wider range of people.

21
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Let me show you what I mean.

22
0:01:37.52,000 --> 0:01:38,000
(Music ends)

23
0:01:38.84,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Now, when I tell people I'm an astrophysicist,

24
0:01:41.04,000 --> 0:01:42,000
they're usually pretty impressed.

25
0:01:42.68,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And then I say I'm also a musician -- they're like, "Yeah, we know."

26
0:01:45.92,000 --> 0:01:46,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:46.96,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So everyone seems to know

28
0:01:48.28,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that there's this deep connection between music and astronomy.

29
0:01:51.24,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And it's actually a very old idea;

30
0:01:52.92,000 --> 0:01:55,000
it goes back over 2,000 years to Pythagoras.

31
0:01:55.96,000 --> 0:01:57,000
You might remember Pythagoras from such theorems

32
0:01:58.24,000 --> 0:01:59,000
as the Pythagorean theorem --

33
0:02:00.12,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Laughter)

34
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And he said:

35
0:02:03.64,000 --> 0:02:05,000
"There is geometry in the humming of the strings,

36
0:02:06.2,000 --> 0:02:08,000
there is music in the spacing of the spheres."

37
0:02:08.72,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And so he literally thought

38
0:02:10.08,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that the motions of the planets along the celestial sphere

39
0:02:12.84,000 --> 0:02:13,000
created harmonious music.

40
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And if you asked him, "Why don't we hear anything?"

41
0:02:17.44,000 --> 0:02:18,000
he'd say you can't hear it

42
0:02:18.76,000 --> 0:02:2,000
because you don't know what it's like to not hear it;

43
0:02:21.28,000 --> 0:02:22,000
you don't know what true silence is.

44
0:02:23.039,000 --> 0:02:25,000
It's like how you have to wait for your power to go out

45
0:02:25.68,000 --> 0:02:27,000
to hear how annoying your refrigerator was.

46
0:02:28.36,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Maybe you buy that,

47
0:02:29.6,000 --> 0:02:32,000
but not everybody else was buying it, including such names as Aristotle.

48
0:02:34.24,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:37.04,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Exact words.

50
0:02:38.28,000 --> 0:02:39,000
(Laughter)

51
0:02:39.32,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So I'll paraphrase his exact words.

52
0:02:41.04,000 --> 0:02:42,000
He said it's a nice idea,

53
0:02:42.44,000 --> 0:02:45,000
but if something as large and vast as the heavens themselves

54
0:02:45.8,000 --> 0:02:46,000
were moving and making sounds,

55
0:02:47.4,000 --> 0:02:48,000
it wouldn't just be audible,

56
0:02:48.8,000 --> 0:02:5,000
it would be earth-shatteringly loud.

57
0:02:51.24,000 --> 0:02:54,000
We exist, therefore there is no music of the spheres.

58
0:02:55.76,000 --> 0:02:58,000
He also thought that the brain's only purpose was to cool down the blood,

59
0:02:59.24,000 --> 0:03:,000
so there's that ...

60
0:03:00.52,000 --> 0:03:01,000
(Laughter)

61
0:03:01.76,000 --> 0:03:04,000
But I'd like to show you that in some way they were actually both right.

62
0:03:05.2,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And we're going to start by understanding what makes music musical.

63
0:03:10.04,000 --> 0:03:12,000
It may sound like a silly question,

64
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
but have you ever wondered why it is

65
0:03:13.92,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that certain notes, when played together, sound relatively pleasing or consonant,

66
0:03:18.2,000 --> 0:03:19,000
such as these two --

67
0:03:19.44,000 --> 0:03:21,000
(Music)

68
0:03:22.04,000 --> 0:03:24,000
while others are a lot more tense or dissonant,

69
0:03:24.72,000 --> 0:03:25,000
such as these two.

70
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
(Music)

71
0:03:28.36,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Right?

72
0:03:29.6,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Why is that? Why are there notes at all?

73
0:03:31.56,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Why can you be in or out of tune?

74
0:03:33.88,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Well, the answer to that question

75
0:03:35.52,000 --> 0:03:38,000
was actually solved by Pythagoras himself.

76
0:03:40.36,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Take a look at the string on the far left.

77
0:03:43.96,000 --> 0:03:44,000
If you bow that string,

78
0:03:45.68,000 --> 0:03:48,000
it will produce a note as it oscillates very fast back and forth.

79
0:03:49.36,000 --> 0:03:52,000
(Musical note)

80
0:03:52.76,000 --> 0:03:54,000
But now if you cut the string in half, you'll get two strings,

81
0:03:55.72,000 --> 0:03:57,000
each oscillating twice as fast.

82
0:03:57.84,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And that will produce a related note.

83
0:04:00.8,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Or three times as fast,

84
0:04:03.04,000 --> 0:04:04,000
or four times --

85
0:04:04.28,000 --> 0:04:08,000
(Musical notes)

86
0:04:11.28,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And so the secret to musical harmony really is simple ratios:

87
0:04:15.24,000 --> 0:04:17,000
the simpler the ratio,

88
0:04:17.4,000 --> 0:04:2,000
the more pleasing or consonant those two notes will sound together.

89
0:04:20.6,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And the more complex the ratio, the more dissonant they will sound.

90
0:04:23.8,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And it's this interplay between tension and release,

91
0:04:26.44,000 --> 0:04:27,000
or consonance and dissonance,

92
0:04:28.2,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that makes what we call music.

93
0:04:31.8,000 --> 0:04:34,000
(Music)

94
0:04:46.52,000 --> 0:04:47,000
(Music ends)

95
0:04:47.76,000 --> 0:04:48,000
(Applause)

96
0:04:48.84,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Thank you.

97
0:04:50.08,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Applause)

98
0:04:53.08,000 --> 0:04:54,000
But there's more.

99
0:04:55.04,000 --> 0:04:56,000
(Laughter)

100
0:04:57.68,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So the two features of music we like to think of as pitch and rhythms,

101
0:05:01.76,000 --> 0:05:03,000
they're actually two versions of the same thing,

102
0:05:04.28,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and I can show you.

103
0:05:05.52,000 --> 0:05:06,000
(Slow rhythm)

104
0:05:06.76,000 --> 0:05:07,000
That's a rhythm right?

105
0:05:09.478,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Watch what happens when we speed it up.

106
0:05:11.36,000 --> 0:05:14,000
(Rhythm gets gradually faster)

107
0:05:14.6,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(High pitch)

108
0:05:18.04,000 --> 0:05:21,000
(Lowering pitch)

109
0:05:21.52,000 --> 0:05:23,000
(Slow Rhythm)

110
0:05:25.32,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So once a rhythm starts happening more than about 20 times per second,

111
0:05:28.64,000 --> 0:05:29,000
your brain flips.

112
0:05:29.88,000 --> 0:05:32,000
It stops hearing it as a rhythm and starts hearing it as a pitch.

113
0:05:34.76,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So what does this have to do with astronomy?

114
0:05:36.88,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Well, that's when we get to the TRAPPIST-1 system.

115
0:05:40.76,000 --> 0:05:45,000
This is an exoplanetary system discovered last February of 2017,

116
0:05:46.28,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and it got everyone excited

117
0:05:47.64,000 --> 0:05:51,000
because it is seven Earth-sized planets all orbiting a very near red dwarf star.

118
0:05:52.44,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And we think that three of the planets

119
0:05:54.32,000 --> 0:05:56,000
have the right temperature for liquid water.

120
0:05:56.44,000 --> 0:05:58,000
It's also so close that in the next few years,

121
0:05:58.64,000 --> 0:06:,000
we should be able to detect elements in their atmospheres

122
0:06:01.36,000 --> 0:06:03,000
such as oxygen and methane -- potential signs of life.

123
0:06:05.92,000 --> 0:06:08,000
But one thing about the TRAPPIST system is that it is tiny.

124
0:06:09.24,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So here we have the orbits of the inner rocky planets

125
0:06:12.08,000 --> 0:06:13,000
in our solar system:

126
0:06:13.36,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars,

127
0:06:14.88,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and all seven Earth-sized planets of TRAPPIST-1

128
0:06:17.48,000 --> 0:06:19,000
are tucked well inside the orbit of Mercury.

129
0:06:21.04,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I have to expand this by 25 times

130
0:06:23.96,000 --> 0:06:25,000
for you to see the orbits of the TRAPPIST-1 planets.

131
0:06:28.36,000 --> 0:06:32,000
It's actually much more similar in size to our planet Jupiter and its moons,

132
0:06:32.92,000 --> 0:06:35,000
even though it's seven Earth-size planets orbiting a star.

133
0:06:36.92,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Another reason this got everyone excited was artist renderings like this.

134
0:06:42.8,000 --> 0:06:45,000
You got some liquid water, some ice, maybe some land,

135
0:06:45.88,000 --> 0:06:47,000
maybe you can go for a dive in this amazing orange sunset.

136
0:06:49.92,000 --> 0:06:5,000
It got everyone excited,

137
0:06:51.28,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and then a few months later, some other papers came out

138
0:06:54.76,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that said, actually, it probably looks more like this.

139
0:06:58.08,000 --> 0:07:01,000
(Laughter)

140
0:07:02.4,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So there were signs

141
0:07:04.32,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that some of the surfaces might actually be molten lava

142
0:07:08.04,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and that there were very damaging X-rays coming from the central star --

143
0:07:11.56,000 --> 0:07:15,000
X-rays that will sterilize the surface of life and even strip off atmospheres.

144
0:07:16.72,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Luckily, just a few months ago in 2018,

145
0:07:19.68,000 --> 0:07:22,000
some new papers came out with more refined measurements,

146
0:07:23.64,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and they found actually it does look something like that.

147
0:07:26.48,000 --> 0:07:28,000
(Laughter)

148
0:07:28.52,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So we now know that several of them have huge supplies of water --

149
0:07:32.04,000 --> 0:07:33,000
global oceans --

150
0:07:33.28,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and several of them have thick atmospheres,

151
0:07:36.04,000 --> 0:07:39,000
so it's the right place to look for potential life.

152
0:07:4,000 --> 0:07:42,000
But there's something even more exciting about this system,

153
0:07:42.8,000 --> 0:07:43,000
especially for me.

154
0:07:44.72,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And that's that TRAPPIST-1 is a resonant chain.

155
0:07:48.12,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And so that means for every two orbits of the outer planet,

156
0:07:51.8,000 --> 0:07:53,000
the next one in orbits three times,

157
0:07:54.28,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and the next one in four,

158
0:07:56.08,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and then six, nine, 15 and 24.

159
0:08:01.36,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So you see a lot of very simple ratios among the orbits of these planets.

160
0:08:06.84,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Clearly, if you speed up their motion, you can get rhythms, right?

161
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:12,000
One beat, say, for every time a planet goes around.

162
0:08:12.72,000 --> 0:08:14,000
But now we know if you speed that motion up even more,

163
0:08:15.48,000 --> 0:08:17,000
you'll actually produce musical pitches,

164
0:08:17.84,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and in this case alone,

165
0:08:20.2,000 --> 0:08:21,000
those pitches will work together,

166
0:08:21.8,000 --> 0:08:23,000
making harmonious, even human-like harmony.

167
0:08:25.88,000 --> 0:08:27,000
So let's hear TRAPPIST-1.

168
0:08:28.88,000 --> 0:08:31,000
The first thing you'll hear will be a note for every orbit of each planet,

169
0:08:32.4,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and just keep in mind,

170
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
this music is coming from the system itself.

171
0:08:36.28,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I'm not creating the pitches or rhythms,

172
0:08:38.36,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I'm just bringing them into the human hearing range.

173
0:08:41.4,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And after all seven planets have entered,

174
0:08:43.4,000 --> 0:08:44,000
you're going to see --

175
0:08:44.88,000 --> 0:08:47,000
well, you're going to hear a drum for every time two planets align.

176
0:08:48.159,000 --> 0:08:5,000
That's when they kind of get close to each other

177
0:08:50.44,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and give each other a gravitational tug.

178
0:08:57.6,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Tone)

179
0:09:05.64,000 --> 0:09:11,000
(Two tones)

180
0:09:14.36,000 --> 0:09:2,000
(Three tones)

181
0:09:22.08,000 --> 0:09:27,000
(Four tones)

182
0:09:29.8,000 --> 0:09:35,000
(Five tones)

183
0:09:37.52,000 --> 0:09:4,000
(Six tones)

184
0:09:45.48,000 --> 0:09:5,000
(Seven tones)

185
0:09:53.72,000 --> 0:09:57,000
(Drum beats)

186
0:10:31.306,000 --> 0:10:32,000
(Music ends)

187
0:10:32.48,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And that's the sound of the star itself -- its light converted into sound.

188
0:10:37.24,000 --> 0:10:39,000
So you may wonder how this is even possible.

189
0:10:40.64,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And it's good to think of the analogy of an orchestra.

190
0:10:44.48,000 --> 0:10:46,000
When everyone gets together to start playing in an orchestra,

191
0:10:47.4,000 --> 0:10:48,000
they can't just dive into it, right?

192
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
They have to all get in tune;

193
0:10:50.6,000 --> 0:10:51,000
they have to make sure

194
0:10:51.88,000 --> 0:10:53,000
their instruments resonate with their neighbors' instruments,

195
0:10:54.8,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and something very similar happened to TRAPPIST-1 early in its existence.

196
0:10:58.28,000 --> 0:10:59,000
When the planets were first forming,

197
0:11:00.12,000 --> 0:11:03,000
they were orbiting within a disc of gas,

198
0:11:03.6,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and while inside that disc,

199
0:11:05.92,000 --> 0:11:06,000
they can actually slide around

200
0:11:07.44,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and adjust their orbits to their neighbors

201
0:11:09.8,000 --> 0:11:11,000
until they're perfectly in tune.

202
0:11:11.92,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And it's a good thing they did because this system is so compact --

203
0:11:15.12,000 --> 0:11:16,000
a lot of mass in a tight space --

204
0:11:17.08,000 --> 0:11:2,000
if every aspect of their orbits wasn't very finely tuned,

205
0:11:20.32,000 --> 0:11:22,000
they would very quickly disrupt each other's orbits,

206
0:11:22.8,000 --> 0:11:23,000
destroying the whole system.

207
0:11:24.96,000 --> 0:11:27,000
So it's really music that is keeping this system alive --

208
0:11:28.04,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and any of its potential inhabitants.

209
0:11:32.92,000 --> 0:11:34,000
But what does our solar system sound like?

210
0:11:36.96,000 --> 0:11:38,000
I hate to be the one to show you this, but it's not pretty.

211
0:11:39.76,000 --> 0:11:4,000
(Laughter)

212
0:11:41.68,000 --> 0:11:42,000
So for one thing,

213
0:11:43,000 --> 0:11:46,000
our solar system is on a much, much larger scale,

214
0:11:46.2,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and so to hear all eight planets,

215
0:11:47.92,000 --> 0:11:5,000
we have to start with Neptune near the bottom of our hearing range,

216
0:11:51.12,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and then Mercury's going to be all the way up

217
0:11:53.28,000 --> 0:11:54,000
near the very top of our hearing range.

218
0:11:55.2,000 --> 0:11:57,000
But also, since our planets are not very compact --

219
0:11:57.8,000 --> 0:11:59,000
they're very spread out --

220
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
they didn't have to adjust their orbits to each other,

221
0:12:02.76,000 --> 0:12:05,000
so they're kind of just all playing their own random note at random times.

222
0:12:06.4,000 --> 0:12:08,000
So, I'm sorry, but here it is.

223
0:12:09.92,000 --> 0:12:1,000
(Tone)

224
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
That's Neptune.

225
0:12:12.6,000 --> 0:12:13,000
(Two tones)

226
0:12:13.64,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Uranus.

227
0:12:15.56,000 --> 0:12:16,000
(Three tones)

228
0:12:17.28,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Saturn.

229
0:12:18.52,000 --> 0:12:19,000
(Four tones)

230
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Jupiter.

231
0:12:21.52,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And then tucked in, that's Mars.

232
0:12:23.92,000 --> 0:12:24,000
(Five tones)

233
0:12:24.96,000 --> 0:12:25,000
(Six tones)

234
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Earth.

235
0:12:27.586,000 --> 0:12:28,000
(Seven tones)

236
0:12:28.76,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Venus.

237
0:12:30.626,000 --> 0:12:31,000
(Eight tones)

238
0:12:31.8,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And that's Mercury --

239
0:12:33.04,000 --> 0:12:34,000
OK, OK, I'll stop.

240
0:12:34.28,000 --> 0:12:35,000
(Laughter)

241
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
So this was actually Kepler's dream.

242
0:12:39.68,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Johannes Kepler is the person

243
0:12:41.12,000 --> 0:12:43,000
that figured out the laws of planetary motion.

244
0:12:43.32,000 --> 0:12:45,000
He was completely fascinated by this idea

245
0:12:45.4,000 --> 0:12:48,000
that there's a connection between music, astronomy and geometry.

246
0:12:49.24,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And so he actually spent an entire book

247
0:12:51.8,000 --> 0:12:56,000
just searching for any kind of musical harmony amongst the solar system's planets

248
0:12:56.84,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and it was really, really hard.

249
0:12:59.36,000 --> 0:13:01,000
It would have been much easier had he lived on TRAPPIST-1,

250
0:13:02.92,000 --> 0:13:03,000
or for that matter ...

251
0:13:04.76,000 --> 0:13:05,000
K2-138.

252
0:13:07.08,000 --> 0:13:1,000
This is a new system discovered in January of 2018

253
0:13:10.84,000 --> 0:13:11,000
with five planets,

254
0:13:12.12,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and just like TRAPPIST,

255
0:13:13.4,000 --> 0:13:16,000
early on in their existence, they were all finely tuned.

256
0:13:16.68,000 --> 0:13:17,000
They were actually tuned

257
0:13:17.92,000 --> 0:13:2,000
into a tuning structure proposed by Pythagoras himself,

258
0:13:20.96,000 --> 0:13:21,000
over 2,000 years before.

259
0:13:23.84,000 --> 0:13:25,000
But the system's actually named after Kepler,

260
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
discovered by the Kepler space telescope.

261
0:13:28.48,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And so, in the last few billion years,

262
0:13:30.76,000 --> 0:13:31,000
they've actually lost their tuning,

263
0:13:32.48,000 --> 0:13:33,000
quite a bit more than TRAPPIST has,

264
0:13:34.2,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and so what we're going to do is go back in time

265
0:13:37.08,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and imagine what they would've sounded like

266
0:13:39.52,000 --> 0:13:4,000
just as they were forming.

267
0:14:02.04,000 --> 0:14:06,000
(Music)

268
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:21,000
(Music ends)

269
0:15:22.88,000 --> 0:15:25,000
(Applause)

270
0:15:30.28,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Thank you.

271
0:15:32.2,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Now, you may be wondering: How far does this go?

272
0:15:34.48,000 --> 0:15:35,000
How much music actually is out there?

273
0:15:37.32,000 --> 0:15:38,000
And that's what I was wondering last fall

274
0:15:39.32,000 --> 0:15:41,000
when I was working at U of T's planetarium,

275
0:15:41.48,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and I was contacted by an artist named Robyn Rennie and her daughter Erin.

276
0:15:46.36,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Robyn loves the night sky,

277
0:15:48.48,000 --> 0:15:5,000
but she hasn't been able to fully see it for 13 years

278
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
because of vision loss.

279
0:15:53.32,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And so they wondered if there was anything I could do.

280
0:15:55.92,000 --> 0:15:58,000
So I collected all the sounds I could think of from the universe

281
0:15:59.52,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and packaged them into what became "Our Musical Universe."

282
0:16:04.68,000 --> 0:16:06,000
This is a sound-based planetarium show

283
0:16:06.96,000 --> 0:16:09,000
exploring the rhythm and harmony of the cosmos.

284
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:12,000
And Robyn was so moved by this presentation

285
0:16:12.44,000 --> 0:16:13,000
that when she went home,

286
0:16:13.72,000 --> 0:16:16,000
she painted this gorgeous representation of her experience.

287
0:16:18.08,000 --> 0:16:2,000
And then I defaced it by putting Jupiter on it for the poster.

288
0:16:21.04,000 --> 0:16:22,000
(Laughter)

289
0:16:23.84,000 --> 0:16:24,000
So ...

290
0:16:27.04,000 --> 0:16:3,000
in this show, I take people of all vision levels

291
0:16:30.44,000 --> 0:16:32,000
and bring them on an audio tour of the universe,

292
0:16:33.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
from the night sky all the way out to the edge of the observable universe.

293
0:16:38.24,000 --> 0:16:4,000
But even this is just the start of a musical odyssey

294
0:16:40.76,000 --> 0:16:43,000
to experience the universe with new eyes and with new ears,

295
0:16:44.68,000 --> 0:16:45,000
and I hope you'll join me.

296
0:16:46.28,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Thank you.

297
0:16:47.52,000 --> 0:16:49,000
(Applause)

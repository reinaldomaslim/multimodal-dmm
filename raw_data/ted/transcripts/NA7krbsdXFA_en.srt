1
0:00:12.879,000 --> 0:00:15,000
What I'd like to do is talk to you a little bit about fear

2
0:00:16.667,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and the cost of fear

3
0:00:18.38,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and the age of fear from which we are now emerging.

4
0:00:22.072,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I would like you to feel comfortable with my doing that

5
0:00:26.071,000 --> 0:00:31,000
by letting you know that I know something about fear and anxiety.

6
0:00:31.388,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I'm a Jewish guy from New Jersey.

7
0:00:33.599,000 --> 0:00:34,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:35.107,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I could worry before I could walk.

9
0:00:37.999,000 --> 0:00:38,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:39.529,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Please, applaud that.

11
0:00:41.995,000 --> 0:00:43,000
(Applause)

12
0:00:44.407,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Thank you.

13
0:00:46.954,000 --> 0:00:5,000
But I also grew up in a time where there was something to fear.

14
0:00:52.915,000 --> 0:00:55,000
We were brought out in the hall when I was a little kid

15
0:00:56.2,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and taught how to put our coats over our heads

16
0:00:59.674,000 --> 0:01:02,000
to protect us from global thermonuclear war.

17
0:01:03.838,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Now even my seven-year-old brain knew that wasn't going to work.

18
0:01:09.179,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But I also knew

19
0:01:10.361,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that global thermonuclear war was something to be concerned with.

20
0:01:15.109,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And yet, despite the fact that we lived for 50 years

21
0:01:19.294,000 --> 0:01:21,000
with the threat of such a war,

22
0:01:21.681,000 --> 0:01:24,000
the response of our government and of our society

23
0:01:25.686,000 --> 0:01:26,000
was to do wonderful things.

24
0:01:28.22,000 --> 0:01:3,000
We created the space program in response to that.

25
0:01:31.242,000 --> 0:01:34,000
We built our highway system in response to that.

26
0:01:34.363,000 --> 0:01:37,000
We created the Internet in response to that.

27
0:01:37.934,000 --> 0:01:41,000
So sometimes fear can produce a constructive response.

28
0:01:42.847,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But sometimes it can produce an un-constructive response.

29
0:01:47.066,000 --> 0:01:49,000
On September 11, 2001,

30
0:01:49.999,000 --> 0:01:53,000
19 guys took over four airplanes

31
0:01:54.534,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and flew them into a couple of buildings.

32
0:01:57.667,000 --> 0:01:59,000
They exacted a horrible toll.

33
0:02:00.151,000 --> 0:02:04,000
It is not for us to minimize what that toll was.

34
0:02:04.965,000 --> 0:02:1,000
But the response that we had was clearly disproportionate --

35
0:02:11.972,000 --> 0:02:15,000
disproportionate to the point of verging on the unhinged.

36
0:02:16.874,000 --> 0:02:19,000
We rearranged the national security apparatus of the United States

37
0:02:20.8,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and of many governments

38
0:02:22.664,000 --> 0:02:26,000
to address a threat that, at the time that those attacks took place,

39
0:02:27.406,000 --> 0:02:28,000
was quite limited.

40
0:02:28.733,000 --> 0:02:31,000
In fact, according to our intelligence services,

41
0:02:32.188,000 --> 0:02:35,000
on September 11, 2001,

42
0:02:35.58,000 --> 0:02:38,000
there were 100 members of core Al-Qaeda.

43
0:02:39.414,000 --> 0:02:41,000
There were just a few thousand terrorists.

44
0:02:42.357,000 --> 0:02:45,000
They posed an existential threat

45
0:02:45.495,000 --> 0:02:46,000
to no one.

46
0:02:47.561,000 --> 0:02:51,000
But we rearranged our entire national security apparatus

47
0:02:52.161,000 --> 0:02:56,000
in the most sweeping way since the end of the Second World War.

48
0:02:56.577,000 --> 0:02:57,000
We launched two wars.

49
0:02:58.44,000 --> 0:03:,000
We spent trillions of dollars.

50
0:03:00.797,000 --> 0:03:02,000
We suspended our values.

51
0:03:02.998,000 --> 0:03:03,000
We violated international law.

52
0:03:04.873,000 --> 0:03:05,000
We embraced torture.

53
0:03:06.129,000 --> 0:03:07,000
We embraced the idea

54
0:03:07.826,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that if these 19 guys could do this, anybody could do it.

55
0:03:11.385,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And therefore, for the first time in history,

56
0:03:14.265,000 --> 0:03:16,000
we were seeing everybody as a threat.

57
0:03:17.237,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And what was the result of that?

58
0:03:19.113,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Surveillance programs that listened in on the emails and phone calls

59
0:03:23.145,000 --> 0:03:25,000
of entire countries --

60
0:03:25.334,000 --> 0:03:27,000
hundreds of millions of people --

61
0:03:27.764,000 --> 0:03:3,000
setting aside whether those countries were our allies,

62
0:03:30.811,000 --> 0:03:32,000
setting aside what our interests were.

63
0:03:34.735,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I would argue that 15 years later,

64
0:03:38.037,000 --> 0:03:4,000
since today there are more terrorists,

65
0:03:40.454,000 --> 0:03:43,000
more terrorist attacks, more terrorist casualties --

66
0:03:44.02,000 --> 0:03:47,000
this by the count of the U.S. State Department --

67
0:03:47.384,000 --> 0:03:5,000
since today the region from which those attacks emanate

68
0:03:50.477,000 --> 0:03:53,000
is more unstable than at any time in its history,

69
0:03:54.19,000 --> 0:03:57,000
since the Flood, perhaps,

70
0:03:57.894,000 --> 0:04:,000
we have not succeeded in our response.

71
0:04:02.206,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Now you have to ask, where did we go wrong?

72
0:04:04.237,000 --> 0:04:06,000
What did we do? What was the mistake that was made?

73
0:04:06.711,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And you might say, well look, Washington is a dysfunctional place.

74
0:04:10.864,000 --> 0:04:11,000
There are political food fights.

75
0:04:12.582,000 --> 0:04:15,000
We've turned our discourse into a cage match.

76
0:04:16.169,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And that's true.

77
0:04:18.039,000 --> 0:04:21,000
But there are bigger problems, believe it or not, than that dysfunction,

78
0:04:21.477,000 --> 0:04:22,000
even though I would argue

79
0:04:23.369,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that dysfunction that makes it impossible to get anything done

80
0:04:28.044,000 --> 0:04:31,000
in the richest and most powerful country in the world

81
0:04:31.749,000 --> 0:04:36,000
is far more dangerous than anything that a group like ISIS could do,

82
0:04:37.422,000 --> 0:04:4,000
because it stops us in our tracks and it keeps us from progress.

83
0:04:42.183,000 --> 0:04:43,000
But there are other problems.

84
0:04:44.127,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And the other problems

85
0:04:45.315,000 --> 0:04:48,000
came from the fact that in Washington and in many capitals right now,

86
0:04:48.895,000 --> 0:04:49,000
we're in a creativity crisis.

87
0:04:51.108,000 --> 0:04:53,000
In Washington, in think tanks,

88
0:04:53.779,000 --> 0:04:56,000
where people are supposed to be thinking of new ideas,

89
0:04:56.921,000 --> 0:04:58,000
you don't get bold new ideas,

90
0:04:59.011,000 --> 0:05:01,000
because if you offer up a bold new idea,

91
0:05:01.902,000 --> 0:05:02,000
not only are you attacked on Twitter,

92
0:05:03.778,000 --> 0:05:06,000
but you will not get confirmed in a government job.

93
0:05:07.153,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Because we are reactive to the heightened venom of the political debate,

94
0:05:12.406,000 --> 0:05:15,000
you get governments that have an us-versus-them mentality,

95
0:05:15.54,000 --> 0:05:17,000
tiny groups of people making decisions.

96
0:05:17.961,000 --> 0:05:2,000
When you sit in a room with a small group of people making decisions,

97
0:05:21.267,000 --> 0:05:22,000
what do you get?

98
0:05:22.45,000 --> 0:05:23,000
You get groupthink.

99
0:05:24.114,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Everybody has the same worldview,

100
0:05:25.727,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and any view from outside of the group is seen as a threat.

101
0:05:29.366,000 --> 0:05:3,000
That's a danger.

102
0:05:31.258,000 --> 0:05:35,000
You also have processes that become reactive to news cycles.

103
0:05:35.543,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And so the parts of the U.S. government that do foresight, that look forward,

104
0:05:39.86,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that do strategy --

105
0:05:41.039,000 --> 0:05:43,000
the parts in other governments that do this -- can't do it,

106
0:05:43.826,000 --> 0:05:45,000
because they're reacting to the news cycle.

107
0:05:46.383,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And so we're not looking ahead.

108
0:05:48.311,000 --> 0:05:51,000
On 9/11, we had a crisis because we were looking the wrong way.

109
0:05:52.527,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Today we have a crisis because, because of 9/11,

110
0:05:55.978,000 --> 0:05:57,000
we are still looking in the wrong direction,

111
0:05:58.653,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and we know because we see transformational trends on the horizon

112
0:06:04.525,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that are far more important than what we saw on 9/11;

113
0:06:09.401,000 --> 0:06:12,000
far more important than the threat posed by these terrorists;

114
0:06:13.227,000 --> 0:06:16,000
far more important even than the instability that we've got

115
0:06:16.501,000 --> 0:06:2,000
in some areas of the world that are racked by instability today.

116
0:06:21.161,000 --> 0:06:25,000
In fact, the things that we are seeing in those parts of the world

117
0:06:25.845,000 --> 0:06:27,000
may be symptoms.

118
0:06:28.883,000 --> 0:06:31,000
They may be a reaction to bigger trends.

119
0:06:32.385,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And if we are treating the symptom and ignoring the bigger trend,

120
0:06:37.113,000 --> 0:06:4,000
then we've got far bigger problems to deal with.

121
0:06:41.415,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And so what are those trends?

122
0:06:43.51,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Well, to a group like you,

123
0:06:45.311,000 --> 0:06:46,000
the trends are apparent.

124
0:06:48.444,000 --> 0:06:53,000
We are living at a moment in which the very fabric of human society

125
0:06:53.723,000 --> 0:06:54,000
is being rewoven.

126
0:06:57.057,000 --> 0:07:,000
If you saw the cover of The Economist a couple of days ago --

127
0:07:00.301,000 --> 0:07:03,000
it said that 80 percent of the people on the planet,

128
0:07:03.871,000 --> 0:07:05,000
by the year 2020, would have a smartphone.

129
0:07:07.564,000 --> 0:07:1,000
They would have a small computer connected to the Internet in their pocket.

130
0:07:11.808,000 --> 0:07:15,000
In most of Africa, the cell phone penetration rate is 80 percent.

131
0:07:17.749,000 --> 0:07:19,000
We passed the point last October

132
0:07:20.437,000 --> 0:07:23,000
when there were more mobile cellular devices, SIM cards,

133
0:07:24.432,000 --> 0:07:26,000
out in the world than there were people.

134
0:07:27.166,000 --> 0:07:32,000
We are within years of a profound moment in our history,

135
0:07:33.086,000 --> 0:07:38,000
when effectively every single human being on the planet

136
0:07:38.467,000 --> 0:07:42,000
is going to be part of a man-made system for the first time,

137
0:07:43.099,000 --> 0:07:45,000
able to touch anyone else --

138
0:07:45.164,000 --> 0:07:47,000
touch them for good, touch them for ill.

139
0:07:47.999,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And the changes associated with that are changing the very nature

140
0:07:53.849,000 --> 0:07:56,000
of every aspect of governance and life on the planet

141
0:07:57.474,000 --> 0:08:,000
in ways that our leaders ought to be thinking about,

142
0:08:00.944,000 --> 0:08:02,000
when they're thinking about these immediate threats.

143
0:08:03.824,000 --> 0:08:04,000
On the security side,

144
0:08:05.614,000 --> 0:08:1,000
we've come out of a Cold War in which it was too costly to fight a nuclear war,

145
0:08:11.142,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and so we didn't,

146
0:08:12.7,000 --> 0:08:15,000
to a period that I call Cool War, cyber war,

147
0:08:16.541,000 --> 0:08:21,000
where the costs of conflict are actually so low, that we may never stop.

148
0:08:22.137,000 --> 0:08:24,000
We may enter a period of constant warfare,

149
0:08:24.887,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and we know this because we've been in it for several years.

150
0:08:29.322,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And yet, we don't have the basic doctrines to guide us in this regard.

151
0:08:35.255,000 --> 0:08:37,000
We don't have the basic ideas formulated.

152
0:08:37.37,000 --> 0:08:39,000
If someone attacks us with a cyber attack,

153
0:08:39.934,000 --> 0:08:42,000
do have the ability to respond with a kinetic attack?

154
0:08:43.787,000 --> 0:08:44,000
We don't know.

155
0:08:45.573,000 --> 0:08:49,000
If somebody launches a cyber attack, how do we deter them?

156
0:08:49.682,000 --> 0:08:51,000
When China launched a series of cyber attacks,

157
0:08:51.893,000 --> 0:08:52,000
what did the U.S. government do?

158
0:08:53.444,000 --> 0:08:56,000
It said, we're going to indict a few of these Chinese guys,

159
0:08:57.453,000 --> 0:08:58,000
who are never coming to America.

160
0:08:59.897,000 --> 0:09:02,000
They're never going to be anywhere near a law enforcement officer

161
0:09:03.87,000 --> 0:09:05,000
who's going to take them into custody.

162
0:09:06.252,000 --> 0:09:08,000
It's a gesture -- it's not a deterrent.

163
0:09:09.678,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Special forces operators out there in the field today

164
0:09:13.5,000 --> 0:09:17,000
discover that small groups of insurgents with cell phones

165
0:09:18.395,000 --> 0:09:23,000
have access to satellite imagery that once only superpowers had.

166
0:09:23.69,000 --> 0:09:25,000
In fact, if you've got a cell phone,

167
0:09:25.881,000 --> 0:09:28,000
you've got access to power that a superpower didn't have,

168
0:09:29.221,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and would have highly classified 10 years ago.

169
0:09:31.4,000 --> 0:09:33,000
In my cell phone, I have an app that tells me

170
0:09:34.315,000 --> 0:09:38,000
where every plane in the world is, and its altitude, and its speed,

171
0:09:38.879,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and what kind of aircraft it is,

172
0:09:40.725,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and where it's going and where it's landing.

173
0:09:44.429,000 --> 0:09:48,000
They have apps that allow them to know

174
0:09:49.002,000 --> 0:09:51,000
what their adversary is about to do.

175
0:09:51.245,000 --> 0:09:53,000
They're using these tools in new ways.

176
0:09:53.645,000 --> 0:09:57,000
When a cafe in Sydney was taken over by a terrorist,

177
0:09:57.783,000 --> 0:09:59,000
he went in with a rifle...

178
0:10:00.1,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and an iPad.

179
0:10:01.936,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And the weapon was the iPad.

180
0:10:04.999,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Because he captured people, he terrorized them,

181
0:10:08.322,000 --> 0:10:1,000
he pointed the iPad at them,

182
0:10:11.051,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and then he took the video and he put it on the Internet,

183
0:10:13.747,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and he took over the world's media.

184
0:10:17.861,000 --> 0:10:2,000
But it doesn't just affect the security side.

185
0:10:22.132,000 --> 0:10:23,000
The relations between great powers --

186
0:10:23.985,000 --> 0:10:25,000
we thought we were past the bipolar era.

187
0:10:27.259,000 --> 0:10:28,000
We thought we were in a unipolar world,

188
0:10:29.157,000 --> 0:10:3,000
where all the big issues were resolved.

189
0:10:31.075,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Remember? It was the end of history.

190
0:10:34.129,000 --> 0:10:35,000
But we're not.

191
0:10:35.449,000 --> 0:10:39,000
We're now seeing that our basic assumptions about the Internet --

192
0:10:39.861,000 --> 0:10:43,000
that it was going to connect us, weave society together --

193
0:10:43.946,000 --> 0:10:44,000
are not necessarily true.

194
0:10:46.083,000 --> 0:10:49,000
In countries like China, you have the Great Firewall of China.

195
0:10:49.303,000 --> 0:10:52,000
You've got countries saying no, if the Internet happens within our borders

196
0:10:52.847,000 --> 0:10:53,000
we control it within our borders.

197
0:10:54.446,000 --> 0:10:56,000
We control the content. We are going to control our security.

198
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:10:58,000
We are going to manage that Internet.

199
0:10:59.12,000 --> 0:11:,000
We are going to say what can be on it.

200
0:11:00.957,000 --> 0:11:02,000
We're going to set a different set of rules.

201
0:11:03.032,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Now you might think, well, that's just China.

202
0:11:05.153,000 --> 0:11:06,000
But it's not just China.

203
0:11:07.651,000 --> 0:11:09,000
It's China, India, Russia.

204
0:11:10.708,000 --> 0:11:13,000
It's Saudi Arabia, it's Singapore, it's Brazil.

205
0:11:13.832,000 --> 0:11:17,000
After the NSA scandal, the Russians, the Chinese, the Indians, the Brazilians,

206
0:11:18.37,000 --> 0:11:21,000
they said, let's create a new Internet backbone,

207
0:11:21.449,000 --> 0:11:23,000
because we can't be dependent on this other one.

208
0:11:23.955,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And so all of a sudden, what do you have?

209
0:11:26.4,000 --> 0:11:28,000
You have a new bipolar world

210
0:11:28.923,000 --> 0:11:3,000
in which cyber-internationalism,

211
0:11:31.138,000 --> 0:11:32,000
our belief,

212
0:11:32.313,000 --> 0:11:34,000
is challenged by cyber-nationalism,

213
0:11:35.174,000 --> 0:11:36,000
another belief.

214
0:11:37.593,000 --> 0:11:4,000
We are seeing these changes everywhere we look.

215
0:11:41.629,000 --> 0:11:42,000
We are seeing the advent of mobile money.

216
0:11:43.631,000 --> 0:11:45,000
It's happening in the places you wouldn't expect.

217
0:11:45.952,000 --> 0:11:47,000
It's happening in Kenya and Tanzania,

218
0:11:48.353,000 --> 0:11:51,000
where millions of people who haven't had access to financial services

219
0:11:51.646,000 --> 0:11:53,000
now conduct all those services on their phones.

220
0:11:54.702,000 --> 0:11:58,000
There are 2.5 million people who don't have financial service access

221
0:11:59.226,000 --> 0:12:01,000
that are going to get it soon.

222
0:12:01.74,000 --> 0:12:03,000
A billion of them are going to have the ability to access it

223
0:12:04.577,000 --> 0:12:05,000
on their cell phone soon.

224
0:12:05.796,000 --> 0:12:07,000
It's not just going to give them the ability to bank.

225
0:12:08.957,000 --> 0:12:1,000
It's going to change what monetary policy is.

226
0:12:11.858,000 --> 0:12:13,000
It's going to change what money is.

227
0:12:15.262,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Education is changing in the same way.

228
0:12:18.43,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Healthcare is changing in the same way.

229
0:12:20.915,000 --> 0:12:23,000
How government services are delivered is changing in the same way.

230
0:12:25.607,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And yet, in Washington, we are debating

231
0:12:29.893,000 --> 0:12:34,000
whether to call the terrorist group that has taken over Syria and Iraq

232
0:12:35.382,000 --> 0:12:39,000
ISIS or ISIL or Islamic State.

233
0:12:40.54,000 --> 0:12:43,000
We are trying to determine

234
0:12:43.675,000 --> 0:12:48,000
how much we want to give in a negotiation with the Iranians

235
0:12:48.988,000 --> 0:12:52,000
on a nuclear deal which deals with the technologies of 50 years ago,

236
0:12:53.811,000 --> 0:12:58,000
when in fact, we know that the Iranians right now are engaged in cyber war with us

237
0:12:59.193,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and we're ignoring it, partially because businesses are not willing

238
0:13:05.251,000 --> 0:13:08,000
to talk about the attacks that are being waged on them.

239
0:13:09.399,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And that gets us to another breakdown

240
0:13:12.232,000 --> 0:13:13,000
that's crucial,

241
0:13:13.48,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and another breakdown that couldn't be more important to a group like this,

242
0:13:17.215,000 --> 0:13:2,000
because the growth of America and real American national security

243
0:13:20.891,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and all of the things that drove progress even during the Cold War,

244
0:13:25.356,000 --> 0:13:29,000
was a public-private partnership between science, technology and government

245
0:13:30.131,000 --> 0:13:33,000
that began when Thomas Jefferson sat alone in his laboratory

246
0:13:33.663,000 --> 0:13:34,000
inventing new things.

247
0:13:36.528,000 --> 0:13:39,000
But it was the canals and railroads and telegraph;

248
0:13:40.362,000 --> 0:13:42,000
it was radar and the Internet.

249
0:13:43.129,000 --> 0:13:45,000
It was Tang, the breakfast drink --

250
0:13:45.437,000 --> 0:13:47,000
probably not the most important of those developments.

251
0:13:48.795,000 --> 0:13:5,000
But what you had was a partnership and a dialogue,

252
0:13:51.698,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and the dialogue has broken down.

253
0:13:53.987,000 --> 0:13:55,000
It's broken down because in Washington,

254
0:13:56.39,000 --> 0:13:57,000
less government is considered more.

255
0:13:58.18,000 --> 0:14:,000
It's broken down because there is, believe it or not,

256
0:14:00.683,000 --> 0:14:01,000
in Washington, a war on science --

257
0:14:02.547,000 --> 0:14:05,000
despite the fact that in all of human history,

258
0:14:05.61,000 --> 0:14:07,000
every time anyone has waged a war on science,

259
0:14:08.594,000 --> 0:14:09,000
science has won.

260
0:14:11.463,000 --> 0:14:15,000
(Applause)

261
0:14:16.712,000 --> 0:14:2,000
But we have a government that doesn't want to listen,

262
0:14:20.932,000 --> 0:14:22,000
that doesn't have people at the highest levels

263
0:14:23.115,000 --> 0:14:24,000
that understand this.

264
0:14:24.293,000 --> 0:14:25,000
In the nuclear age,

265
0:14:25.468,000 --> 0:14:28,000
when there were people in senior national security jobs,

266
0:14:28.659,000 --> 0:14:31,000
they were expected to speak throw-weight.

267
0:14:32.005,000 --> 0:14:35,000
They were expected to know the lingo, the vocabulary.

268
0:14:35.047,000 --> 0:14:37,000
If you went to the highest level of the U.S. government now

269
0:14:37.87,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and said, "Talk to me about cyber, about neuroscience,

270
0:14:40.427,000 --> 0:14:43,000
about the things that are going to change the world of tomorrow,"

271
0:14:43.591,000 --> 0:14:44,000
you'd get a blank stare.

272
0:14:44.766,000 --> 0:14:45,000
I know, because when I wrote this book,

273
0:14:46.711,000 --> 0:14:49,000
I talked to 150 people, many from the science and tech side,

274
0:14:49.775,000 --> 0:14:52,000
who felt like they were being shunted off to the kids' table.

275
0:14:53.389,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Meanwhile, on the tech side,

276
0:14:55.495,000 --> 0:14:58,000
we have lots of wonderful people creating wonderful things,

277
0:14:59.324,000 --> 0:15:01,000
but they started in garages and they didn't need the government

278
0:15:02.305,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and they don't want the government.

279
0:15:04.002,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Many of them have a political view that's somewhere between

280
0:15:06.793,000 --> 0:15:07,000
libertarian and anarchic:

281
0:15:08.711,000 --> 0:15:09,000
leave me alone.

282
0:15:11.305,000 --> 0:15:12,000
But the world's coming apart.

283
0:15:13.668,000 --> 0:15:16,000
All of a sudden, there are going to be massive regulatory changes

284
0:15:17.081,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and massive issues associated with conflict

285
0:15:20.023,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and massive issues associated with security and privacy.

286
0:15:24.332,000 --> 0:15:26,000
And we haven't even gotten to the next set of issues,

287
0:15:26.841,000 --> 0:15:27,000
which are philosophical issues.

288
0:15:29.601,000 --> 0:15:31,000
If you can't vote, if you can't have a job,

289
0:15:32.447,000 --> 0:15:34,000
if you can't bank, if you can't get health care,

290
0:15:34.963,000 --> 0:15:36,000
if you can't be educated without Internet access,

291
0:15:37.429,000 --> 0:15:41,000
is Internet access a fundamental right that should be written into constitutions?

292
0:15:42.364,000 --> 0:15:45,000
If Internet access is a fundamental right,

293
0:15:45.559,000 --> 0:15:49,000
is electricity access for the 1.2 billion who don't have access to electricity

294
0:15:49.741,000 --> 0:15:5,000
a fundamental right?

295
0:15:51.5,000 --> 0:15:54,000
These are fundamental issues. Where are the philosophers?

296
0:15:54.553,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Where's the dialogue?

297
0:15:57.59,000 --> 0:15:59,000
And that brings me to the reason that I'm here.

298
0:16:00.559,000 --> 0:16:02,000
I live in Washington. Pity me.

299
0:16:03.101,000 --> 0:16:04,000
(Laughter)

300
0:16:04.895,000 --> 0:16:06,000
The dialogue isn't happening there.

301
0:16:07.932,000 --> 0:16:09,000
These big issues that will change the world,

302
0:16:10.351,000 --> 0:16:12,000
change national security, change economics,

303
0:16:13.023,000 --> 0:16:15,000
create hope, create threats,

304
0:16:15.93,000 --> 0:16:17,000
can only be resolved when you bring together

305
0:16:18.668,000 --> 0:16:21,000
groups of people who understand science and technology

306
0:16:22.073,000 --> 0:16:23,000
back together with government.

307
0:16:23.77,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Both sides need each other.

308
0:16:26.486,000 --> 0:16:3,000
And until we recreate that connection,

309
0:16:31.262,000 --> 0:16:36,000
until we do what helped America grow and helped other countries grow,

310
0:16:36.717,000 --> 0:16:39,000
then we are going to grow ever more vulnerable.

311
0:16:40.547,000 --> 0:16:43,000
The risks associated with 9/11 will not be measured

312
0:16:44.382,000 --> 0:16:47,000
in terms of lives lost by terror attacks

313
0:16:47.412,000 --> 0:16:51,000
or buildings destroyed or trillions of dollars spent.

314
0:16:52.04,000 --> 0:16:56,000
They'll be measured in terms of the costs of our distraction from critical issues

315
0:16:56.967,000 --> 0:16:59,000
and our inability to get together

316
0:17:00.724,000 --> 0:17:04,000
scientists, technologists, government leaders,

317
0:17:04.944,000 --> 0:17:09,000
at a moment of transformation akin to the beginning of the Renaissance,

318
0:17:10.103,000 --> 0:17:13,000
akin to the beginning of the major transformational eras

319
0:17:13.845,000 --> 0:17:15,000
that have happened on Earth,

320
0:17:16.358,000 --> 0:17:2,000
and start coming up with, if not the right answers,

321
0:17:20.828,000 --> 0:17:22,000
then at least the right questions.

322
0:17:23.205,000 --> 0:17:25,000
We are not there yet,

323
0:17:25.272,000 --> 0:17:28,000
but discussions like this and groups like you

324
0:17:28.36,000 --> 0:17:31,000
are the places where those questions can be formulated and posed.

325
0:17:32.553,000 --> 0:17:36,000
And that's why I believe that groups like TED,

326
0:17:37.131,000 --> 0:17:39,000
discussions like this around the planet,

327
0:17:39.748,000 --> 0:17:43,000
are the place where the future of foreign policy, of economic policy,

328
0:17:44.482,000 --> 0:17:49,000
of social policy, of philosophy, will ultimately take place.

329
0:17:50.394,000 --> 0:17:52,000
And that's why it's been a pleasure speaking to you.

330
0:17:52.848,000 --> 0:17:53,000
Thank you very, very much.

331
0:17:54.127,000 --> 0:17:58,000

1
0:00:13.506,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I feel so fortunate that my first job

2
0:00:15.708,000 --> 0:00:17,000
was working at the Museum of Modern Art

3
0:00:18.14,000 --> 0:00:21,000
on a retrospective of painter Elizabeth Murray.

4
0:00:21.594,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I learned so much from her.

5
0:00:23.98,000 --> 0:00:24,000
After the curator Robert Storr

6
0:00:25.748,000 --> 0:00:26,000
selected all the paintings

7
0:00:27.267,000 --> 0:00:29,000
from her lifetime body of work,

8
0:00:30.019,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I loved looking at the paintings from the 1970s.

9
0:00:33.661,000 --> 0:00:35,000
There were some motifs and elements

10
0:00:36.217,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that would come up again later in her life.

11
0:00:39.723,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I remember asking her

12
0:00:41.362,000 --> 0:00:43,000
what she thought of those early works.

13
0:00:43.92,000 --> 0:00:44,000
If you didn't know they were hers,

14
0:00:45.384,000 --> 0:00:47,000
you might not have been able to guess.

15
0:00:47.954,000 --> 0:00:49,000
She told me that a few didn't quite meet

16
0:00:50.877,000 --> 0:00:53,000
her own mark for what she wanted them to be.

17
0:00:54.484,000 --> 0:00:55,000
One of the works, in fact,

18
0:00:55.913,000 --> 0:00:56,000
so didn't meet her mark,

19
0:00:57.434,000 --> 0:00:59,000
she had set it out in the trash in her studio,

20
0:01:00.406,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and her neighbor had taken it

21
0:01:02.247,000 --> 0:01:04,000
because she saw its value.

22
0:01:04.817,000 --> 0:01:06,000
In that moment, my view of success

23
0:01:07.766,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and creativity changed.

24
0:01:10.282,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I realized that success is a moment,

25
0:01:13.17,000 --> 0:01:14,000
but what we're always celebrating

26
0:01:15.106,000 --> 0:01:19,000
is creativity and mastery.

27
0:01:19.114,000 --> 0:01:22,000
But this is the thing: What gets us to convert success

28
0:01:22.751,000 --> 0:01:24,000
into mastery?

29
0:01:24.98,000 --> 0:01:26,000
This is a question I've long asked myself.

30
0:01:27.771,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I think it comes when we start to value

31
0:01:30.352,000 --> 0:01:33,000
the gift of a near win.

32
0:01:33.944,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I started to understand this when I went

33
0:01:36.139,000 --> 0:01:37,000
on one cold May day

34
0:01:38.122,000 --> 0:01:4,000
to watch a set of varsity archers,

35
0:01:40.673,000 --> 0:01:42,000
all women as fate would have it,

36
0:01:42.97,000 --> 0:01:44,000
at the northern tip of Manhattan

37
0:01:45.05,000 --> 0:01:48,000
at Columbia's Baker Athletics Complex.

38
0:01:48.469,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I wanted to see what's called archer's paradox,

39
0:01:52.138,000 --> 0:01:54,000
the idea that in order to actually hit your target,

40
0:01:54.969,000 --> 0:01:58,000
you have to aim at something slightly skew from it.

41
0:01:59.411,000 --> 0:02:,000
I stood and watched as the coach

42
0:02:01.404,000 --> 0:02:03,000
drove up these women in this gray van,

43
0:02:04.118,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and they exited with this kind of relaxed focus.

44
0:02:07.096,000 --> 0:02:09,000
One held a half-eaten ice cream cone in one hand

45
0:02:09.99,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and arrows in the left with yellow fletching.

46
0:02:12.507,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And they passed me and smiled,

47
0:02:15.19,000 --> 0:02:16,000
but they sized me up as they

48
0:02:16.99,000 --> 0:02:17,000
made their way to the turf,

49
0:02:18.609,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and spoke to each other not with words

50
0:02:20.363,000 --> 0:02:22,000
but with numbers, degrees, I thought,

51
0:02:23.08,000 --> 0:02:24,000
positions for how they might plan

52
0:02:24.378,000 --> 0:02:26,000
to hit their target.

53
0:02:26.911,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I stood behind one archer as her coach

54
0:02:29.294,000 --> 0:02:31,000
stood in between us to maybe assess

55
0:02:31.316,000 --> 0:02:33,000
who might need support, and watched her,

56
0:02:33.773,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and I didn't understand how even one

57
0:02:35.86,000 --> 0:02:37,000
was going to hit the ten ring.

58
0:02:38.711,000 --> 0:02:4,000
The ten ring from the standard 75-yard distance,

59
0:02:41.359,000 --> 0:02:43,000
it looks as small as a matchstick tip

60
0:02:44.269,000 --> 0:02:46,000
held out at arm's length.

61
0:02:46.366,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And this is while holding 50 pounds of draw weight

62
0:02:49.645,000 --> 0:02:51,000
on each shot.

63
0:02:52.352,000 --> 0:02:54,000
She first hit a seven, I remember, and then a nine,

64
0:02:55.044,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and then two tens,

65
0:02:56.324,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and then the next arrow

66
0:02:57.56,000 --> 0:02:59,000
didn't even hit the target.

67
0:02:59.779,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And I saw that gave her more tenacity,

68
0:03:01.78,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and she went after it again and again.

69
0:03:04.566,000 --> 0:03:06,000
For three hours this went on.

70
0:03:07.512,000 --> 0:03:09,000
At the end of the practice, one of the archers

71
0:03:09.933,000 --> 0:03:11,000
was so taxed that she lied out on the ground

72
0:03:12.519,000 --> 0:03:13,000
just star-fished,

73
0:03:14.46,000 --> 0:03:16,000
her head looking up at the sky,

74
0:03:16.492,000 --> 0:03:18,000
trying to find what T.S. Eliot might call

75
0:03:19.104,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that still point of the turning world.

76
0:03:22.99,000 --> 0:03:24,000
It's so rare in American culture,

77
0:03:25.005,000 --> 0:03:28,000
there's so little that's vocational about it anymore,

78
0:03:28.015,000 --> 0:03:3,000
to look at what doggedness looks like

79
0:03:30.609,000 --> 0:03:32,000
with this level of exactitude,

80
0:03:32.72,000 --> 0:03:34,000
what it means to align your body posture

81
0:03:35.101,000 --> 0:03:38,000
for three hours in order to hit a target,

82
0:03:38.468,000 --> 0:03:42,000
pursuing a kind of excellence in obscurity.

83
0:03:42.538,000 --> 0:03:44,000
But I stayed because I realized I was witnessing

84
0:03:44.763,000 --> 0:03:46,000
what's so rare to glimpse,

85
0:03:47.098,000 --> 0:03:5,000
that difference between success and mastery.

86
0:03:50.971,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So success is hitting that ten ring,

87
0:03:53.595,000 --> 0:03:55,000
but mastery is knowing that it means nothing

88
0:03:55.711,000 --> 0:03:58,000
if you can't do it again and again.

89
0:03:59.267,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Mastery is not just the same as excellence, though.

90
0:04:02.988,000 --> 0:04:03,000
It's not the same as success,

91
0:04:04.821,000 --> 0:04:06,000
which I see as an event,

92
0:04:07.054,000 --> 0:04:08,000
a moment in time,

93
0:04:08.64,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and a label that the world confers upon you.

94
0:04:11.938,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Mastery is not a commitment to a goal

95
0:04:15.072,000 --> 0:04:17,000
but to a constant pursuit.

96
0:04:17.977,000 --> 0:04:18,000
What gets us to do this,

97
0:04:19.854,000 --> 0:04:21,000
what get us to forward thrust more

98
0:04:22.4,000 --> 0:04:25,000
is to value the near win.

99
0:04:26.057,000 --> 0:04:28,000
How many times have we designated something

100
0:04:28.209,000 --> 0:04:3,000
a classic, a masterpiece even,

101
0:04:31.08,000 --> 0:04:34,000
while its creator considers it hopelessly unfinished,

102
0:04:34.658,000 --> 0:04:36,000
riddled with difficulties and flaws,

103
0:04:36.881,000 --> 0:04:39,000
in other words, a near win?

104
0:04:39.899,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Elizabeth Murray surprised me

105
0:04:41.793,000 --> 0:04:44,000
with her admission about her earlier paintings.

106
0:04:45.013,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Painter Paul Cézanne so often thought his works were incomplete

107
0:04:48.665,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that he would deliberately leave them aside

108
0:04:50.487,000 --> 0:04:52,000
with the intention of picking them back up again,

109
0:04:53.037,000 --> 0:04:54,000
but at the end of his life,

110
0:04:54.78,000 --> 0:04:56,000
the result was that he had only signed

111
0:04:56.995,000 --> 0:04:58,000
10 percent of his paintings.

112
0:04:59.735,000 --> 0:05:03,000
His favorite novel was "The [Unknown] Masterpiece" by Honoré de Balzac,

113
0:05:03.885,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and he felt the protagonist was the painter himself.

114
0:05:09.481,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Franz Kafka saw incompletion

115
0:05:11.415,000 --> 0:05:14,000
when others would find only works to praise,

116
0:05:14.666,000 --> 0:05:16,000
so much so that he wanted all of his diaries,

117
0:05:17.099,000 --> 0:05:19,000
manuscripts, letters and even sketches

118
0:05:19.196,000 --> 0:05:21,000
burned upon his death.

119
0:05:21.525,000 --> 0:05:23,000
His friend refused to honor the request,

120
0:05:24.32,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and because of that, we now have all the works

121
0:05:25.998,000 --> 0:05:26,000
we now do by Kafka:

122
0:05:27.767,000 --> 0:05:3,000
"America," "The Trial" and "The Castle,"

123
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
a work so incomplete it even stops mid-sentence.

124
0:05:34.785,000 --> 0:05:36,000
The pursuit of mastery, in other words,

125
0:05:37.32,000 --> 0:05:41,000
is an ever-onward almost.

126
0:05:41.958,000 --> 0:05:42,000
"Lord, grant that I desire

127
0:05:43.934,000 --> 0:05:45,000
more than I can accomplish,"

128
0:05:46.01,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Michelangelo implored,

129
0:05:47.569,000 --> 0:05:5,000
as if to that Old Testament God on the Sistine Chapel,

130
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and he himself was that Adam

131
0:05:52.949,000 --> 0:05:53,000
with his finger outstretched

132
0:05:54.455,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and not quite touching that God's hand.

133
0:05:59.028,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Mastery is in the reaching, not the arriving.

134
0:06:03.616,000 --> 0:06:06,000
It's in constantly wanting to close that gap

135
0:06:06.921,000 --> 0:06:1,000
between where you are and where you want to be.

136
0:06:11.119,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Mastery is about sacrificing for your craft

137
0:06:14.707,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and not for the sake of crafting your career.

138
0:06:18.925,000 --> 0:06:2,000
How many inventors and untold entrepreneurs

139
0:06:21.59,000 --> 0:06:23,000
live out this phenomenon?

140
0:06:24.359,000 --> 0:06:25,000
We see it even in the life

141
0:06:25.864,000 --> 0:06:27,000
of the indomitable Arctic explorer Ben Saunders,

142
0:06:28.674,000 --> 0:06:29,000
who tells me that his triumphs

143
0:06:30.348,000 --> 0:06:31,000
are not merely the result

144
0:06:32.271,000 --> 0:06:33,000
of a grand achievement,

145
0:06:34.066,000 --> 0:06:38,000
but of the propulsion of a lineage of near wins.

146
0:06:39.06,000 --> 0:06:42,000
We thrive when we stay at our own leading edge.

147
0:06:42.796,000 --> 0:06:44,000
It's a wisdom understood by Duke Ellington,

148
0:06:45.491,000 --> 0:06:47,000
who said that his favorite song out of his repertoire

149
0:06:48.417,000 --> 0:06:5,000
was always the next one,

150
0:06:50.552,000 --> 0:06:53,000
always the one he had yet to compose.

151
0:06:54.211,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Part of the reason that the near win

152
0:06:56.34,000 --> 0:06:58,000
is inbuilt to mastery

153
0:06:58.632,000 --> 0:07:,000
is because the greater our proficiency,

154
0:07:00.985,000 --> 0:07:02,000
the more clearly we might see

155
0:07:03.145,000 --> 0:07:06,000
that we don't know all that we thought we did.

156
0:07:06.363,000 --> 0:07:08,000
It's called the DunningKruger effect.

157
0:07:08.994,000 --> 0:07:1,000
The Paris Review got it out of James Baldwin

158
0:07:11.921,000 --> 0:07:12,000
when they asked him,

159
0:07:12.949,000 --> 0:07:14,000
"What do you think increases with knowledge?"

160
0:07:15.646,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and he said, "You learn how little you know."

161
0:07:20.328,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Success motivates us, but a near win

162
0:07:22.652,000 --> 0:07:24,000
can propel us in an ongoing quest.

163
0:07:25.527,000 --> 0:07:27,000
One of the most vivid examples of this comes

164
0:07:27.646,000 --> 0:07:28,000
when we look at the difference

165
0:07:29.436,000 --> 0:07:3,000
between Olympic silver medalists

166
0:07:31.382,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and bronze medalists after a competition.

167
0:07:34.333,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Thomas Gilovich and his team from Cornell

168
0:07:36.946,000 --> 0:07:38,000
studied this difference and found

169
0:07:39.092,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that the frustration silver medalists feel

170
0:07:41.616,000 --> 0:07:42,000
compared to bronze, who are typically a bit

171
0:07:43.577,000 --> 0:07:45,000
more happy to have just not received fourth place

172
0:07:46.05,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and not medaled at all,

173
0:07:47.729,000 --> 0:07:48,000
gives silver medalists a focus

174
0:07:49.684,000 --> 0:07:51,000
on follow-up competition.

175
0:07:52.107,000 --> 0:07:54,000
We see it even in the gambling industry

176
0:07:54.389,000 --> 0:07:55,000
that once picked up on this phenomenon

177
0:07:56.375,000 --> 0:07:57,000
of the near win

178
0:07:57.867,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and created these scratch-off tickets

179
0:08:00.13,000 --> 0:08:03,000
that had a higher than average rate of near wins

180
0:08:03.458,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and so compelled people to buy more tickets

181
0:08:06.267,000 --> 0:08:07,000
that they were called heart-stoppers,

182
0:08:08.216,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and were set on a gambling industry set of abuses

183
0:08:11.279,000 --> 0:08:14,000
in Britain in the 1970s.

184
0:08:14.67,000 --> 0:08:16,000
The reason the near win has a propulsion

185
0:08:16.919,000 --> 0:08:18,000
is because it changes our view of the landscape

186
0:08:19.803,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and puts our goals, which we tend to put

187
0:08:22.454,000 --> 0:08:24,000
at a distance, into more proximate vicinity

188
0:08:25.059,000 --> 0:08:26,000
to where we stand.

189
0:08:26.905,000 --> 0:08:29,000
If I ask you to envision what a great day looks like next week,

190
0:08:30.083,000 --> 0:08:33,000
you might describe it in more general terms.

191
0:08:33.788,000 --> 0:08:36,000
But if I ask you to describe a great day at TED tomorrow,

192
0:08:37.439,000 --> 0:08:4,000
you might describe it with granular, practical clarity.

193
0:08:40.9,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And this is what a near win does.

194
0:08:42.563,000 --> 0:08:44,000
It gets us to focus on what, right now,

195
0:08:45.109,000 --> 0:08:49,000
we plan to do to address that mountain in our sights.

196
0:08:49.89,000 --> 0:08:52,000
It's Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who in 1984

197
0:08:53.046,000 --> 0:08:55,000
missed taking the gold in the heptathlon

198
0:08:55.052,000 --> 0:08:57,000
by one third of a second,

199
0:08:57.313,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and her husband predicted that would give her

200
0:08:59.194,000 --> 0:09:02,000
the tenacity she needed in follow-up competition.

201
0:09:03.156,000 --> 0:09:06,000
In 1988, she won the gold in the heptathlon

202
0:09:06.528,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and set a record of 7,291 points,

203
0:09:10.703,000 --> 0:09:15,000
a score that no athlete has come very close to since.

204
0:09:15.81,000 --> 0:09:17,000
We thrive not when we've done it all,

205
0:09:18.521,000 --> 0:09:21,000
but when we still have more to do.

206
0:09:21.928,000 --> 0:09:23,000
I stand here thinking and wondering

207
0:09:24.01,000 --> 0:09:25,000
about all the different ways

208
0:09:25.708,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that we might even manufacture a near win

209
0:09:28.105,000 --> 0:09:29,000
in this room,

210
0:09:29.37,000 --> 0:09:31,000
how your lives might play this out,

211
0:09:31.439,000 --> 0:09:35,000
because I think on some gut level we do know this.

212
0:09:36.23,000 --> 0:09:37,000
We know that we thrive when we stay

213
0:09:37.982,000 --> 0:09:38,000
at our own leading edge,

214
0:09:39.499,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and it's why the deliberate incomplete

215
0:09:41.965,000 --> 0:09:43,000
is inbuilt into creation myths.

216
0:09:44.458,000 --> 0:09:46,000
In Navajo culture, some craftsmen and women

217
0:09:46.98,000 --> 0:09:48,000
would deliberately put an imperfection

218
0:09:49.423,000 --> 0:09:5,000
in textiles and ceramics.

219
0:09:51.07,000 --> 0:09:53,000
It's what's called a spirit line,

220
0:09:53.861,000 --> 0:09:55,000
a deliberate flaw in the pattern

221
0:09:55.97,000 --> 0:09:58,000
to give the weaver or maker a way out,

222
0:09:58.998,000 --> 0:10:02,000
but also a reason to continue making work.

223
0:10:03.67,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Masters are not experts because they take

224
0:10:05.447,000 --> 0:10:07,000
a subject to its conceptual end.

225
0:10:08.065,000 --> 0:10:09,000
They're masters because they realize

226
0:10:09.774,000 --> 0:10:11,000
that there isn't one.

227
0:10:12.352,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Now it occurred to me, as I thought about this,

228
0:10:15.462,000 --> 0:10:16,000
why the archery coach

229
0:10:17.25,000 --> 0:10:19,000
told me at the end of that practice,

230
0:10:19.42,000 --> 0:10:21,000
out of earshot of his archers,

231
0:10:21.665,000 --> 0:10:22,000
that he and his colleagues never feel

232
0:10:23.642,000 --> 0:10:25,000
they can do enough for their team,

233
0:10:25.902,000 --> 0:10:27,000
never feel there are enough visualization techniques

234
0:10:28.779,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and posture drills to help them overcome

235
0:10:31.566,000 --> 0:10:33,000
those constant near wins.

236
0:10:33.846,000 --> 0:10:35,000
It didn't sound like a complaint, exactly,

237
0:10:36.293,000 --> 0:10:38,000
but just a way to let me know,

238
0:10:38.886,000 --> 0:10:39,000
a kind of tender admission,

239
0:10:40.366,000 --> 0:10:43,000
to remind me that he knew he was giving himself over

240
0:10:43.631,000 --> 0:10:46,000
to a voracious, unfinished path

241
0:10:46.786,000 --> 0:10:48,000
that always required more.

242
0:10:49.711,000 --> 0:10:52,000
We build out of the unfinished idea,

243
0:10:52.86,000 --> 0:10:56,000
even if that idea is our former self.

244
0:10:57.316,000 --> 0:11:,000
This is the dynamic of mastery.

245
0:11:00.331,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Coming close to what you thought you wanted

246
0:11:03.364,000 --> 0:11:05,000
can help you attain more than you ever dreamed

247
0:11:06.09,000 --> 0:11:07,000
you could.

248
0:11:07.701,000 --> 0:11:09,000
It's what I have to imagine Elizabeth Murray

249
0:11:10.575,000 --> 0:11:12,000
was thinking when I saw her smiling

250
0:11:12.59,000 --> 0:11:14,000
at those early paintings one day

251
0:11:14.851,000 --> 0:11:17,000
in the galleries.

252
0:11:17.922,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Even if we created utopias, I believe

253
0:11:20.288,000 --> 0:11:23,000
we would still have the incomplete.

254
0:11:23.59,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Completion is a goal,

255
0:11:25.754,000 --> 0:11:28,000
but we hope it is never the end.

256
0:11:29.747,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Thank you.

257
0:11:32.528,000 --> 0:11:35,000
(Applause)

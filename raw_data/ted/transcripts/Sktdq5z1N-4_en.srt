1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I have had the distinct blessing in my life

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
But the coolest I ever worked on

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
was around this guy.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
This guy's name is TEMPT.

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
TEMPT was one of the foremost graffiti artists in the 80s.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And he came up home from a run one day

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and said, "Dad, my legs are tingling."

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And that was the onset of ALS.

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
So TEMPT is now completely paralyzed.

11
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
He only has use of his eyes.

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I was exposed to him.

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I have a company that does design and animation,

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part

15
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
of what we admire and respect in the art world.

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And so we decided that we were going to sponsor

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Tony, TEMPT, and his cause.

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
So I went and met with his brother and father

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and said, "We're going to give you this money.

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
What are you going to do with it?"

21
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I just want to be able to communicate with him

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and him to be able to communicate with me."

24
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And I said, "Wait a second, isn't that -- I've seen Stephen Hawking --

25
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
don't all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate

26
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
via these devices?"

27
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And he said, "No, unless you're in the upper echelon and

28
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
you've got really amazing insurance,

29
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
you can't actually do that.

30
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
These devices aren't accessible to people."

31
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And I said, "Well, how do you actually communicate?"

32
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Has everyone seen the movie "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly?"

33
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
That's how they communicate --

34
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
so run their finger along.

35
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I said, "That's archaic. How can that be?"

36
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So I showed up with the desire to just write a check,

37
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and instead, I wrote a check

38
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that I had no freaking idea how I was going to cash.

39
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I committed to his brother and his father right then and there --

40
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I'm like, "All right, here's the deal:

41
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Tony's going to speak, we're going to get him a machine,

42
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and we're going to figure out a way for him to do his art again.

43
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Because it's a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him

44
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
isn't able to communicate it."

45
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
So I spoke at a conference a couple months after that.

46
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I met these guys called GRL,

47
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Graffiti Research Lab,

48
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and they have a technology

49
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
that allows them to project a light onto any surface

50
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and then, with a laser pointer, draw on it,

51
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and it just registers the negative space.

52
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So they go around and do art installations like this.

53
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
All the things that go up there, they said there's a life cycle.

54
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
First it starts with the sexual organs,

55
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
then it starts with cuss words,

56
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
then it was Bush slanders

57
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and then people actually got to art.

58
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
But there was always a life cycle to their presentations.

59
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So I went home and was having dinner with my wife

60
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and was telling her about this,

61
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and we were like, "Well wait a second. If we know that this technology exists

62
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
where you can use your eyes to control things,

63
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
why don't we figure out a way for TEMPT to control a laser

64
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and he could do graf again? Well that would be awesome."

65
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So that started the journey.

66
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And about two years later, about a year later,

67
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
after a bunch of organization

68
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and a bunch of moving things around,

69
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
we'd accomplished a couple things.

70
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
One, we battered down the doors of the insurance companies,

71
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and we actually got TEMPT a machine

72
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that let him communicate -- a Stephen Hawking machine.

73
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
(Applause)

74
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Which was awesome.

75
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And he's seriously one of the funniest -- I call him Yoda,

76
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
because you talk to the guy, you get an email from him,

77
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and you're like, "I'm not worthy. This guy's so amazing."

78
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
The other thing we did

79
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
is we flew seven programmers from all over the world --

80
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
literally every corner of the world --

81
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
into our house.

82
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
My wife and kids and I moved to our back garage,

83
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and these hackers and programmers

84
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house.

85
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
A lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that

86
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and that we were going to come back

87
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and all the pictures on the wall would be removed and graf on the walls.

88
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
But for over two weeks,

89
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
we programmed,

90
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
we went to the Venice boardwalk,

91
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
my kids got involved,

92
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
my dog got involved,

93
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and we created this.

94
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
This is called the EyeWriter,

95
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and you can see the description.

96
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
This is a cheap pair of sunglasses

97
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that we bought at the Venice Beach boardwalk,

98
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
some copper wire

99
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and some stuff from Home Depot and Radio Shack.

100
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
We took a PS3 camera, hacked it open,

101
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
mounted it to an LED light,

102
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and now there's a device that is free --

103
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
you build this yourself, we publish the code for free,

104
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
you download the software for free.

105
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And now we've created a device

106
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that has absolutely no limitations.

107
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
There's no insurance company that can say "No."

108
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
There's no hospital that can say "No."

109
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Anybody who's paralyzed now has access

110
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes.

111
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
(Applause)

112
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Thank you.

113
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Thank you guys very much. That was awesome.

114
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So at the end of the two weeks,

115
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
we went back to TEMPT's room.

116
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I love this picture, because this is someone else's room

117
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and that's his room.

118
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So there's all this hustle and bustle going on for the big unveiling.

119
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And after over a year of planning,

120
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
two weeks of programming,

121
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
carb-fest and all-night sessions,

122
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Tony drew again for the first time in seven years.

123
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And this is an amazing picture,

124
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
because this is his life support system,

125
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and he's looking over his life support system.

126
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
We kicked his bed so that he could see out.

127
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And we set up a projector

128
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital.

129
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And he drew again for the first time,

130
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
in front of his family and friends --

131
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and you can only imagine

132
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
what the feeling in the parking lot was.

133
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
The funny thing was, we had to break into the parking lot too,

134
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
so we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too.

135
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
(Laughter)

136
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So at the end of this, he sent us an email,

137
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and this is what the email said:

138
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
"That was the first time I've drawn anything for seven years.

139
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I feel like I had been held underwater,

140
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and someone finally reached down

141
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and pulled my head up so I could breathe."

142
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Isn't that awesome?

143
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Applause)

144
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So that's kind of our battle cry.

145
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
That's what keeps us going and keeps us developing.

146
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And we've got such a long way to go with this.

147
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
This is an amazing device,

148
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
but it's the equivalent of an Etch A Sketch.

149
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more.

150
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
So we're in the process of trying to figure out

151
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
how to make it better, faster, stronger.

152
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Since that time, we've had all kinds of acknowledgment.

153
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
We've won a bunch of awards.

154
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Remember, it's free; none of us are making any money on this thing.

155
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
It's all coming out of our own pockets.

156
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
So the awards were like, "Oh, this is fantastic."

157
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Armstrong Twittered about us,

158
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and then in December, Time magazine honored us

159
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, which was really cool.

160
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
(Applause)

161
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
The coolest thing about this --

162
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and this is what's completing the whole circle --

163
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
is that in April of this year,

164
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
at the Geffen MOCA in downtown Los Angeles,

165
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
there's going to be an exhibition called "Art of the Streets."

166
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And "Art of the Streets" is going to have

167
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
pretty much the bad-asses of the street art scene --

168
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Banksy, Shepard Fairey, KAWS --

169
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
all of these guys will be there.

170
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
TEMPT's going to be in the show,

171
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
which is pretty awesome.

172
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
(Applause)

173
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So basically this is my point:

174
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
If you see something that's not possible,

175
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
make it possible.

176
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Everything in this room wasn't possible --

177
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
this stage, this computer, this mic, the EyeWriter --

178
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
wasn't possible at one point.

179
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Make it possible, everyone in this room.

180
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I'm not a programmer,

181
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
never done anything with ocular recognition technology,

182
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
but I just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people

183
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
so that we could make something happen.

184
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And this is the question I want everyone to ask yourself

185
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
every single day

186
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done:

187
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
if not now, then when? And if not me, then who?

188
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Thank you guys.

189
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.325,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I grew up in the late '70s in rural China

2
0:00:17.245,000 --> 0:00:21,000
during the final years of my country's pursuit of absolute equality

3
0:00:21.834,000 --> 0:00:23,000
at the expense of liberty.

4
0:00:24.87,000 --> 0:00:26,000
At that time, everybody had a job,

5
0:00:27.218,000 --> 0:00:29,000
but everyone was struggling.

6
0:00:29.312,000 --> 0:00:31,000
In the early '80s, my dad was an electrician,

7
0:00:32.212,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and my mom worked two shifts in the local hospital.

8
0:00:35.79,000 --> 0:00:37,000
But still, we didn't have enough food,

9
0:00:38.754,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and our living conditions were dismal.

10
0:00:41.095,000 --> 0:00:42,000
We were undoubtedly equal --

11
0:00:43.11,000 --> 0:00:44,000
we were equally poor.

12
0:00:45.114,000 --> 0:00:47,000
The state owned everything.

13
0:00:47.146,000 --> 0:00:48,000
We owned nothing.

14
0:00:49.309,000 --> 0:00:52,000
The story I'm going to share with you is about my struggles

15
0:00:53.005,000 --> 0:00:55,000
of overcoming adversity

16
0:00:55.229,000 --> 0:01:,000
with my resilience, grit and sheer determination.

17
0:01:01.151,000 --> 0:01:03,000
No, I'm just kidding, I'm not going to do that to you.

18
0:01:03.701,000 --> 0:01:05,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:06.094,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Instead, I'm going to tell you,

20
0:01:10.068,000 --> 0:01:14,000
what I'm going to talk about today is about a new form of collective poverty

21
0:01:14.238,000 --> 0:01:15,000
that many of us don't recognize

22
0:01:16.191,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and that urgently needs to be understood.

23
0:01:18.822,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I'm sure you've noticed that in the past 20 years,

24
0:01:21.304,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that asset has emerged.

25
0:01:23.104,000 --> 0:01:26,000
It's been generating wealth at a breakneck pace.

26
0:01:26.586,000 --> 0:01:3,000
As a tool, it has brought businesses deep customer insights,

27
0:01:30.687,000 --> 0:01:31,000
operational efficiency

28
0:01:32.349,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and enormous top-line growth.

29
0:01:35.018,000 --> 0:01:36,000
But for some,

30
0:01:36.67,000 --> 0:01:4,000
it has also provided a device to manipulate a democratic election

31
0:01:41.491,000 --> 0:01:46,000
or perform surveillance for profit or political purposes.

32
0:01:47.287,000 --> 0:01:49,000
What is this miracle asset?

33
0:01:49.357,000 --> 0:01:5,000
You've guessed it: it's data.

34
0:01:52.308,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Seven out of the top 10 most valuable companies in the world are tech companies

35
0:01:56.898,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that either directly generate profit from data

36
0:01:59.889,000 --> 0:02:01,000
or are empowered by data from the core.

37
0:02:03.352,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Multiple surveys show

38
0:02:04.641,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that the vast majority of business decision makers

39
0:02:07.151,000 --> 0:02:1,000
regard data as an essential asset for success.

40
0:02:10.546,000 --> 0:02:15,000
We have all experienced how data is shifting this major paradigm shift

41
0:02:16.508,000 --> 0:02:19,000
for our personal, economic and political lives.

42
0:02:20.764,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Whoever owns the data owns the future.

43
0:02:23.553,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But who's producing the data?

44
0:02:26.004,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I assume everyone in this room has a smartphone,

45
0:02:28.992,000 --> 0:02:29,000
several social media accounts

46
0:02:30.508,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and has done a Google search or two in the past week.

47
0:02:33.966,000 --> 0:02:35,000
We are all producing data. Yes.

48
0:02:36.948,000 --> 0:02:39,000
It is estimated that by 2030, 10 years from now,

49
0:02:40.38,000 --> 0:02:44,000
there will be about 125 billion connected devices in the world.

50
0:02:44.603,000 --> 0:02:48,000
That's an average of about 15 devices per person.

51
0:02:49.511,000 --> 0:02:51,000
We are already producing data every day.

52
0:02:51.562,000 --> 0:02:54,000
We'll be producing exponentially more.

53
0:02:55.529,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Google, Facebook and Tencent's combined revenue in 2018

54
0:02:59.564,000 --> 0:03:02,000
was 236 billion US dollars.

55
0:03:02.872,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Now, how many of you have received payment from them

56
0:03:05.433,000 --> 0:03:06,000
for the data you generate for them?

57
0:03:07.165,000 --> 0:03:08,000
None, right?

58
0:03:08.57,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Data has immense value but is centrally controlled and owned.

59
0:03:12.555,000 --> 0:03:16,000
You are all walking raw materials for those large data companies,

60
0:03:17.442,000 --> 0:03:18,000
but none of you are paid.

61
0:03:19.703,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Not only that,

62
0:03:20.9,000 --> 0:03:24,000
you're not even considered as part of this equation for income.

63
0:03:25.651,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So once again,

64
0:03:27.368,000 --> 0:03:28,000
we are undoubtedly equal:

65
0:03:29.129,000 --> 0:03:3,000
we're equally poor.

66
0:03:31.004,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Somebody else owns everything, and we own nothing.

67
0:03:34.067,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Sounds familiar, doesn't it?

68
0:03:36.747,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So what should we do?

69
0:03:38.158,000 --> 0:03:4,000
There might be some clues in how my life turned out

70
0:03:40.595,000 --> 0:03:41,000
after that difficult start.

71
0:03:41.957,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Things began to look up for my family in the '80s.

72
0:03:44.4,000 --> 0:03:45,000
The system evolved,

73
0:03:45.903,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and people began to be allowed to own a piece of what we created.

74
0:03:50.118,000 --> 0:03:51,000
"People diving into the ocean,"

75
0:03:51.86,000 --> 0:03:53,000
or "xia hai," the Chinese term,

76
0:03:54.232,000 --> 0:03:57,000
described those who left state-owned enterprise jobs

77
0:03:57.555,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and started their own businesses.

78
0:03:59.814,000 --> 0:04:,000
Private ownership of a business

79
0:04:01.825,000 --> 0:04:04,000
became personal ownership of cars,

80
0:04:04.929,000 --> 0:04:07,000
properties, food, clothes and things.

81
0:04:08.39,000 --> 0:04:1,000
The economic machine started rolling,

82
0:04:11.285,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and people's lives began to improve.

83
0:04:13.509,000 --> 0:04:14,000
For the first time,

84
0:04:14.777,000 --> 0:04:16,000
to get rich was glorious.

85
0:04:17.409,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So in the '90s, when I went to study in Chengdu in west China,

86
0:04:22.496,000 --> 0:04:23,000
many young individuals like myself

87
0:04:24.148,000 --> 0:04:26,000
were well-positioned to take advantage of the new system.

88
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
After I graduated from my university,

89
0:04:30.058,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I cofounded my first business and moved to Shenzhen,

90
0:04:33.265,000 --> 0:04:37,000
the brand-new special economic zone that used to be a fishing village.

91
0:04:37.768,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Twenty years later,

92
0:04:38.961,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Shenzhen has become a global innovation powerhouse.

93
0:04:44.667,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Private ownership was a form of liberty we didn't have before.

94
0:04:49.276,000 --> 0:04:53,000
It created unprecedented opportunities for our generations,

95
0:04:54.223,000 --> 0:04:57,000
motivating us to work and study incredibly hard.

96
0:04:58.317,000 --> 0:05:03,000
The result was that more than 850 million people rose out of poverty.

97
0:05:04.227,000 --> 0:05:05,000
According to the World Bank,

98
0:05:06.219,000 --> 0:05:12,000
China's extreme poverty rate in 1981, when I was a little kid, was 88 percent.

99
0:05:12.604,000 --> 0:05:15,000
By 2015, 0.7 percent.

100
0:05:16.832,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I am a product of that success,

101
0:05:18.6,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and I am very happy to share that today, I have my own AI business,

102
0:05:22.716,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and I lead a very worldly and dynamic life,

103
0:05:25.438,000 --> 0:05:29,000
a path that was unimaginable when I was a kid in west China.

104
0:05:30.252,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Of course, this prosperity came with a trade-off,

105
0:05:34.12,000 --> 0:05:38,000
with equality, the environment and freedom.

106
0:05:38.534,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And obviously I'm not here to argue that China has it all figured out.

107
0:05:42.291,000 --> 0:05:43,000
We haven't.

108
0:05:43.521,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Nor that data is fully comparable to physical assets.

109
0:05:47.731,000 --> 0:05:48,000
It is not.

110
0:05:49.726,000 --> 0:05:53,000
But my life experience allowed me to see what's hiding in plain sight.

111
0:05:54.733,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Currently, the public discourse

112
0:05:56.352,000 --> 0:06:,000
is so focused on the regulatory and privacy issue

113
0:06:00.383,000 --> 0:06:01,000
when it comes to data ownership.

114
0:06:02.138,000 --> 0:06:03,000
But I want to ask:

115
0:06:03.837,000 --> 0:06:06,000
What if we look at data ownership in completely different ways?

116
0:06:07.561,000 --> 0:06:09,000
What if data ownership is, in fact,

117
0:06:10.24,000 --> 0:06:14,000
a personal, individual and economic issue?

118
0:06:15.183,000 --> 0:06:17,000
What if, in the new digital economy,

119
0:06:17.561,000 --> 0:06:2,000
we are allowed to own a piece of what we create

120
0:06:20.641,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and give people the liberty of private data ownership?

121
0:06:26.111,000 --> 0:06:3,000
The legal concept of ownership is when you can possess,

122
0:06:30.337,000 --> 0:06:34,000
use, gift, pass on, destroy

123
0:06:34.672,000 --> 0:06:37,000
or trade it or sell your asset

124
0:06:38.609,000 --> 0:06:4,000
at a price accepted by you.

125
0:06:41.446,000 --> 0:06:45,000
What if we give that same definition to individuals' data,

126
0:06:45.569,000 --> 0:06:48,000
so individuals can use or destroy our data

127
0:06:49.051,000 --> 0:06:51,000
or we trade it at our chosen price?

128
0:06:52.013,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Now, I know some of you might say,

129
0:06:53.711,000 --> 0:06:56,000
"I would never, ever trade my data for any amount of money."

130
0:06:57.163,000 --> 0:07:,000
But that, let me remind you, is exactly what you're doing now,

131
0:07:00.472,000 --> 0:07:02,000
except you're giving your data away for free.

132
0:07:03.576,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Plus, privacy is a very personal and nuanced issue.

133
0:07:07.642,000 --> 0:07:11,000
You might have the privilege to prioritize your privacy over money,

134
0:07:12.057,000 --> 0:07:15,000
but for millions of small business owners in China

135
0:07:15.102,000 --> 0:07:17,000
who can't get bank loans easily,

136
0:07:17.465,000 --> 0:07:21,000
using their data to gain rapid loan approval from AI-powered lenders

137
0:07:22.252,000 --> 0:07:24,000
can answer their more pressing needs.

138
0:07:24.867,000 --> 0:07:25,000
What's private to you

139
0:07:26.295,000 --> 0:07:28,000
is different from what's private to others.

140
0:07:29.051,000 --> 0:07:31,000
What's private to you now

141
0:07:31.516,000 --> 0:07:34,000
is different from what was private when you were in college.

142
0:07:35.065,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Or, at least, I hope so.

143
0:07:36.487,000 --> 0:07:37,000
(Laughter)

144
0:07:38.428,000 --> 0:07:42,000
We are always, although often subconsciously,

145
0:07:42.653,000 --> 0:07:43,000
making such trade-offs

146
0:07:44.021,000 --> 0:07:48,000
based on our diverse personal beliefs and life priorities.

147
0:07:48.096,000 --> 0:07:51,000
That is why data ownership would be incomplete

148
0:07:52.041,000 --> 0:07:53,000
without a pricing power.

149
0:07:54.665,000 --> 0:07:56,000
By assigning pricing power to individuals,

150
0:07:57.359,000 --> 0:08:01,000
we gain a tool to reflect our personal and nuanced preferences.

151
0:08:01.614,000 --> 0:08:04,000
So, for example, you could choose to donate your data for free

152
0:08:05.077,000 --> 0:08:08,000
if a contribution to a particular medical research

153
0:08:08.746,000 --> 0:08:09,000
is very meaningful for you.

154
0:08:11.068,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Or, if we had the tools to set our behavior data

155
0:08:14.03,000 --> 0:08:17,000
at a price of, say, 100,000 US dollars,

156
0:08:17.337,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I doubt any political group would be able to target

157
0:08:19.791,000 --> 0:08:2,000
or manipulate your vote.

158
0:08:22.131,000 --> 0:08:24,000
You control. You decide.

159
0:08:25.403,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Now, I know this sounds probably implausible,

160
0:08:27.974,000 --> 0:08:28,000
but trends are already pointing to

161
0:08:29.678,000 --> 0:08:33,000
a growing and very powerful individual data ownership movement.

162
0:08:34.483,000 --> 0:08:36,000
First, start-ups are already creating tools

163
0:08:36.971,000 --> 0:08:38,000
to allow us to take back some control.

164
0:08:39.361,000 --> 0:08:42,000
A new browser called Brave

165
0:08:42.458,000 --> 0:08:45,000
empowers users with "Brave Shields" -- they literally call it that --

166
0:08:45.994,000 --> 0:08:5,000
by aggressively blocking data-grabbing ads and trackers,

167
0:08:51.019,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and avoid leaking data like other browsers.

168
0:08:53.527,000 --> 0:08:57,000
In return, users can take back some bargaining and pricing power.

169
0:08:58.494,000 --> 0:09:01,000
When users opt in to accept ads,

170
0:09:01.728,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Brave rewards users with "basic attention tokens"

171
0:09:05.129,000 --> 0:09:09,000
that can redeem content behind paywalls from publishers.

172
0:09:10.686,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And I've been using Brave for a few months.

173
0:09:12.763,000 --> 0:09:15,000
It has already blocked more than 200,000 ads and trackers

174
0:09:16.739,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and saved hours of my time.

175
0:09:19.695,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Now, I know some of you interact with your browser

176
0:09:22.344,000 --> 0:09:24,000
more than with your partners, so --

177
0:09:24.584,000 --> 0:09:25,000
(Laughter)

178
0:09:25.648,000 --> 0:09:29,000
you should at least find one that doesn't waste your time and is not creepy.

179
0:09:30.325,000 --> 0:09:31,000
(Laughter)

180
0:09:34.11,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Do you think Google is indispensable?

181
0:09:37.351,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Think again.

182
0:09:38.631,000 --> 0:09:41,000
A search engine is indispensable.

183
0:09:41.674,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Google just has the monopoly --

184
0:09:43.367,000 --> 0:09:44,000
for now.

185
0:09:44.544,000 --> 0:09:48,000
A search engine called DuckDuckGo doesn't store your personal information

186
0:09:48.758,000 --> 0:09:49,000
or follow you around with ads

187
0:09:50.301,000 --> 0:09:52,000
or track your personal browsing history.

188
0:09:52.984,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Instead, it gives all users the same search results

189
0:09:55.82,000 --> 0:09:58,000
instead of based on your personal browsing records.

190
0:10:00.565,000 --> 0:10:02,000
In London, a company called digi.me

191
0:10:03.363,000 --> 0:10:05,000
offers an app you can download on your smartphone

192
0:10:06.265,000 --> 0:10:1,000
that helps to import and consolidate your data generated by you

193
0:10:11.031,000 --> 0:10:13,000
from your Fitbit, Spotify,

194
0:10:13.236,000 --> 0:10:14,000
social media accounts ...

195
0:10:15.405,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And you can choose where to store your data,

196
0:10:18.439,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and digi.me will help you to make your data work for you

197
0:10:22.806,000 --> 0:10:25,000
by providing insights that used to be exclusively accessible

198
0:10:25.991,000 --> 0:10:26,000
by large data companies.

199
0:10:28.584,000 --> 0:10:32,000
In DC, a new initiative called UBDI, U-B-D-I,

200
0:10:33.505,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Universal Basic Data Income,

201
0:10:35.946,000 --> 0:10:36,000
helps people to make money

202
0:10:37.959,000 --> 0:10:41,000
by sharing anonymous insights through their data

203
0:10:42.002,000 --> 0:10:44,000
for companies that can use them for market research.

204
0:10:45.562,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And whenever a company purchases a study,

205
0:10:48.381,000 --> 0:10:52,000
users get paid in cash and UBDI points to track their contribution,

206
0:10:52.493,000 --> 0:10:55,000
potentially as much as 1,000 US dollars per year

207
0:10:55.663,000 --> 0:10:57,000
per their estimation.

208
0:10:59.42,000 --> 0:11:02,000
UBDI could be a very feasible path for universal basic income

209
0:11:03.329,000 --> 0:11:04,000
in the AI economy.

210
0:11:05.642,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Further, individual awareness of privacy and data ownership

211
0:11:11.403,000 --> 0:11:12,000
is growing fast

212
0:11:13.424,000 --> 0:11:17,000
as we all become aware of this monster we have unleashed in our pocket.

213
0:11:18.684,000 --> 0:11:2,000
I'm a mother of two preteen girls,

214
0:11:21.174,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and trust me,

215
0:11:22.793,000 --> 0:11:27,000
the single biggest source of stress and anxiety as a parent,

216
0:11:28.012,000 --> 0:11:31,000
for me, is my children's relationship with technology.

217
0:11:33.161,000 --> 0:11:36,000
This is a three-page agreement my husband and I make them sign

218
0:11:37.024,000 --> 0:11:39,000
before they receive their first [mobile phone].

219
0:11:39.325,000 --> 0:11:4,000
(Laughter)

220
0:11:41.619,000 --> 0:11:43,000
We want to help them to become

221
0:11:45.191,000 --> 0:11:47,000
digital citizens,

222
0:11:47.796,000 --> 0:11:52,000
but only if we can make them become smart and responsible ones.

223
0:11:53.513,000 --> 0:11:57,000
I help them to understand what kind of data should never be shared.

224
0:11:58.931,000 --> 0:11:59,000
So if you Google me,

225
0:12:00.524,000 --> 0:12:03,000
in fact -- actually, sorry -- if you DuckDuckGo me,

226
0:12:04.013,000 --> 0:12:07,000
you will find maybe a lot about me and my work,

227
0:12:07.317,000 --> 0:12:09,000
but you may find no information about my daughters.

228
0:12:10.71,000 --> 0:12:11,000
When they grow up,

229
0:12:11.889,000 --> 0:12:14,000
if they want to put themselves out there, it's their choice, not mine,

230
0:12:15.211,000 --> 0:12:17,000
despite that I insist they're the most beautiful,

231
0:12:17.81,000 --> 0:12:2,000
smartest and most extraordinary kids in the world, of course.

232
0:12:23.474,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And I know many people are having similar conversations

233
0:12:26.241,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and making similar decisions,

234
0:12:28.038,000 --> 0:12:29,000
which gives me hope

235
0:12:29.355,000 --> 0:12:32,000
that a truly smart data-rich future will be here soon.

236
0:12:33.592,000 --> 0:12:36,000
But I want to highlight the Clause 6 of this agreement.

237
0:12:37,000 --> 0:12:4,000
It says, "I will never, ever search for any information online

238
0:12:40.658,000 --> 0:12:43,000
if I would be embarrassed if seen by Grandma Dawnie."

239
0:12:44.145,000 --> 0:12:45,000
(Laughter)

240
0:12:45.237,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Try it. It's really effective.

241
0:12:47.126,000 --> 0:12:48,000
(Laughter)

242
0:12:49.588,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Throughout history,

243
0:12:51.573,000 --> 0:12:57,000
there has always been a trade-off between liberty and equality

244
0:12:57.612,000 --> 0:12:59,000
in the pursuit of prosperity.

245
0:13:00.657,000 --> 0:13:06,000
The world has constantly been going through the circle of wealth accumulation

246
0:13:07.047,000 --> 0:13:08,000
to wealth redistribution.

247
0:13:09.555,000 --> 0:13:12,000
As the tension between the haves and have-nots

248
0:13:12.697,000 --> 0:13:14,000
is breaking so many countries,

249
0:13:14.916,000 --> 0:13:16,000
it is in everyone's interest,

250
0:13:17.351,000 --> 0:13:19,000
including the large data companies,

251
0:13:19.875,000 --> 0:13:22,000
to prevent this new form of inequality.

252
0:13:23.997,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Of course, individual data ownership is not the perfect nor the complete answer

253
0:13:29.325,000 --> 0:13:31,000
to this profoundly complex question

254
0:13:31.77,000 --> 0:13:35,000
of what makes a good digital society.

255
0:13:36.991,000 --> 0:13:37,000
But according to McKinsey,

256
0:13:40.321,000 --> 0:13:46,000
AI will add 13 trillion US dollars of economic output in the next 10 years.

257
0:13:46.883,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Data generated by individuals will no doubt contribute

258
0:13:50.12,000 --> 0:13:52,000
to this enormous growth.

259
0:13:53.716,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Shouldn't we at least consider an economic model

260
0:13:56.686,000 --> 0:13:57,000
that empowers the people?

261
0:13:59.055,000 --> 0:14:03,000
And if private ownership helped to lift more than 850 million people

262
0:14:03.778,000 --> 0:14:04,000
out of poverty,

263
0:14:05.73,000 --> 0:14:06,000
it is our duty

264
0:14:07.751,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and we owe it to future generations

265
0:14:10.819,000 --> 0:14:13,000
to create a more inclusive AI economy

266
0:14:14.359,000 --> 0:14:18,000
that will empower the people in addition to businesses.

267
0:14:18.806,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Thank you.

268
0:14:20.008,000 --> 0:14:23,000
(Applause)

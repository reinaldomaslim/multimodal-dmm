1
0:00:13.166,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So, Ma was trying to explain something to me

2
0:00:15.463,000 --> 0:00:16,000
about Grandma and when they grew up,

3
0:00:17.278,000 --> 0:00:18,000
but I couldn't pay attention to her

4
0:00:19.009,000 --> 0:00:21,000
because I was five years old, and I was petrified.

5
0:00:21.965,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I had just seen The Green Lady.

6
0:00:24.974,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Now, about a week earlier, I'd watched that movie "Godzilla,"

7
0:00:27.997,000 --> 0:00:3,000
the one about that huge lizard-like beast storming a major city,

8
0:00:31.168,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and the thought of a green monster coming for me was stuck in my mind.

9
0:00:35.85,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And yet there I was, at the tip of Lower Manhattan with my mom,

10
0:00:39.163,000 --> 0:00:4,000
just staring at her:

11
0:00:40.968,000 --> 0:00:41,000
her horns,

12
0:00:42.151,000 --> 0:00:43,000
her muscles --

13
0:00:43.336,000 --> 0:00:44,000
all of it just frightened me.

14
0:00:44.741,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And I didn't know whether she was a monster or a hero.

15
0:00:49.138,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So I decided to consult the Google of the day --

16
0:00:52.384,000 --> 0:00:53,000
"Ma! Ma!"

17
0:00:53.688,000 --> 0:00:54,000
(Laughter)

18
0:00:55.608,000 --> 0:00:59,000
My mother explained that The Green Lady is actually the Statue of Liberty

19
0:01:00.073,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and that she was waving immigrants in.

20
0:01:02.368,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Now, the part of her explanation that really messed with my young head

21
0:01:06.687,000 --> 0:01:08,000
was the fact that, according to Ma,

22
0:01:09.346,000 --> 0:01:11,000
long before us,

23
0:01:11.403,000 --> 0:01:14,000
The Green Lady was actually brown,

24
0:01:15.202,000 --> 0:01:16,000
brown like me,

25
0:01:16.579,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and that she changed colors over the years,

26
0:01:19.904,000 --> 0:01:2,000
much like America.

27
0:01:21.262,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Now, the part that really is intriguing about this

28
0:01:26.58,000 --> 0:01:27,000
is that when she changed colors,

29
0:01:28.235,000 --> 0:01:29,000
she made me think about myself.

30
0:01:30.481,000 --> 0:01:31,000
It all made sense to me,

31
0:01:31.9,000 --> 0:01:32,000
because as a first-generation American,

32
0:01:33.921,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I was surrounded by immigrants.

33
0:01:35.422,000 --> 0:01:38,000
In fact, within my immediate social circle of the people who support me,

34
0:01:39.256,000 --> 0:01:4,000
who enrich my life,

35
0:01:40.568,000 --> 0:01:41,000
at least two are foreign-born.

36
0:01:43.199,000 --> 0:01:46,000
My life as a US citizen is in many ways shaped by newcomers,

37
0:01:46.875,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and chances are,

38
0:01:48.058,000 --> 0:01:49,000
so is yours.

39
0:01:49.534,000 --> 0:01:52,000
There are more than 40 million immigrants in the USA.

40
0:01:53.211,000 --> 0:01:54,000
According to census data,

41
0:01:54.745,000 --> 0:01:58,000
a quarter of the nation's children have at least one foreign-born parent.

42
0:01:59.431,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I know all these statistics because I study global migration patterns.

43
0:02:04.566,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I'm a journalist, and for the last few years,

44
0:02:06.752,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I've been documenting the lives of US citizens

45
0:02:09.183,000 --> 0:02:1,000
who've lost people to deportation.

46
0:02:11.135,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And the numbers are enormous.

47
0:02:14.036,000 --> 0:02:16,000
From 2008 to 2016,

48
0:02:16.608,000 --> 0:02:19,000
more than three million people were "ordered removed" --

49
0:02:19.926,000 --> 0:02:22,000
that's the technical term for being deported.

50
0:02:23.415,000 --> 0:02:28,000
There is an economic, a political, a psychological and an emotional cost

51
0:02:28.956,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to those deportations --

52
0:02:30.876,000 --> 0:02:32,000
the moments when these circles are broken.

53
0:02:33.702,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I once asked a US soldier,

54
0:02:35.472,000 --> 0:02:37,000
"Why did you volunteer to fight this war?"

55
0:02:37.831,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And she told me,

56
0:02:39.034,000 --> 0:02:4,000
"Because I'm proud to defend my country."

57
0:02:41.044,000 --> 0:02:42,000
But I pressed to know --

58
0:02:42.234,000 --> 0:02:43,000
"Really, when you're on base,

59
0:02:44.115,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and you hear bombs exploding in the distance,

60
0:02:46.378,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and you see soldiers coming back who are gravely injured,

61
0:02:50.179,000 --> 0:02:54,000
in that moment, when you know you could be next,

62
0:02:54.362,000 --> 0:02:55,000
what does 'my country' mean?"

63
0:02:56.806,000 --> 0:02:57,000
She looked at me.

64
0:02:58.568,000 --> 0:02:59,000
"My country is my wife,

65
0:03:00.459,000 --> 0:03:01,000
my family,

66
0:03:01.797,000 --> 0:03:02,000
my friends, my soldiers."

67
0:03:03.381,000 --> 0:03:04,000
What she was telling me

68
0:03:04.722,000 --> 0:03:07,000
is that "my country" is a collection of these strong relationships;

69
0:03:08.114,000 --> 0:03:09,000
these social circles.

70
0:03:10.406,000 --> 0:03:12,000
When the social circles are weakened,

71
0:03:12.65,000 --> 0:03:14,000
a country itself is weaker.

72
0:03:15.255,000 --> 0:03:18,000
We're missing a crucial aspect in the debate about immigration policy.

73
0:03:18.869,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Rather than focusing on individuals,

74
0:03:20.916,000 --> 0:03:23,000
we should focus on the circles around them,

75
0:03:23.967,000 --> 0:03:25,000
because these are the people who are left behind:

76
0:03:26.98,000 --> 0:03:27,000
the voters, the taxpayers,

77
0:03:28.884,000 --> 0:03:3,000
the ones who are suffering that loss.

78
0:03:31.186,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And it's not just the children of the deported

79
0:03:33.492,000 --> 0:03:34,000
who are impacted.

80
0:03:34.857,000 --> 0:03:36,000
You have brothers and sisters who are separated by borders.

81
0:03:37.758,000 --> 0:03:39,000
You have classmates, teachers, law enforcement officers,

82
0:03:40.589,000 --> 0:03:42,000
technologists, scientists, doctors,

83
0:03:42.845,000 --> 0:03:45,000
who are all scrambling to make sense of new realities

84
0:03:46.587,000 --> 0:03:48,000
when their social circles are broken.

85
0:03:49.885,000 --> 0:03:52,000
These are the real lives behind all these statistics

86
0:03:53.564,000 --> 0:03:55,000
that dominate discussions about immigration policy.

87
0:03:56.036,000 --> 0:03:57,000
But we don't often think about them.

88
0:03:58.021,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And I'm trying to change that.

89
0:03:59.917,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Here's just one of the real-life stories that I've collected.

90
0:04:04.55,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And it still haunts me.

91
0:04:06.482,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I met Ramon and his son in 2016,

92
0:04:10.251,000 --> 0:04:13,000
the same year both of them were being ordered out of the country.

93
0:04:14.459,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Ramon was being deported to Latin America,

94
0:04:18.373,000 --> 0:04:21,000
while his son, who was a sergeant in the US military,

95
0:04:21.722,000 --> 0:04:22,000
was being deployed.

96
0:04:24.596,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Deported ...

97
0:04:26.479,000 --> 0:04:27,000
deployed.

98
0:04:28.308,000 --> 0:04:3,000
If you just look at Ramon's case,

99
0:04:31.318,000 --> 0:04:34,000
it wouldn't be clear how deeply connected to the country he is.

100
0:04:35.307,000 --> 0:04:36,000
But consider his son:

101
0:04:37.159,000 --> 0:04:4,000
a US citizen defending a country that's banished his father.

102
0:04:41.499,000 --> 0:04:42,000
The social circle is what's key here.

103
0:04:43.955,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Here's another example that illustrates those critical bonds.

104
0:04:47.408,000 --> 0:04:5,000
A group of citizens in Philadelphia were concerned about their jobs,

105
0:04:50.77,000 --> 0:04:52,000
because the legal owner of the restaurant where they worked

106
0:04:53.785,000 --> 0:04:54,000
was an undocumented immigrant,

107
0:04:55.549,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and immigration officials had picked him up.

108
0:04:58.218,000 --> 0:04:59,000
They rallied behind him.

109
0:04:59.585,000 --> 0:05:,000
An immigration lawyer argued

110
0:05:01.032,000 --> 0:05:03,000
he was too important to the local community

111
0:05:03.23,000 --> 0:05:04,000
to be deported.

112
0:05:04.702,000 --> 0:05:08,000
At the hearing, they even submitted restaurant reviews --

113
0:05:08.784,000 --> 0:05:09,000
restaurant reviews!

114
0:05:10.645,000 --> 0:05:14,000
In the end, a judge exercised what's called "judicial discretion"

115
0:05:15.337,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and allowed him to stay in the country,

116
0:05:17.297,000 --> 0:05:2,000
but only because they considered the social circle.

117
0:05:21.647,000 --> 0:05:25,000
There are 23 million noncitizens in the USA,

118
0:05:26.434,000 --> 0:05:28,000
according to verifiable federal data.

119
0:05:28.526,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And that doesn't include the undocumented,

120
0:05:30.712,000 --> 0:05:33,000
because numbers for that population are at best complex estimates.

121
0:05:34.09,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Let's just work with what we have.

122
0:05:36.372,000 --> 0:05:39,000
That's 23 million social circles --

123
0:05:39.438,000 --> 0:05:41,000
about 100 million individuals

124
0:05:42.367,000 --> 0:05:45,000
whose lives could be impacted by deportation.

125
0:05:45.49,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And the stress of it all is trickling down through the population.

126
0:05:49.341,000 --> 0:05:52,000
A 2017 poll by UCLA of LA County residents

127
0:05:52.986,000 --> 0:05:55,000
found that 30 percent of citizens in LA County

128
0:05:56.783,000 --> 0:05:58,000
are stressed about deportation,

129
0:05:59.128,000 --> 0:06:01,000
not because they themselves could be removed,

130
0:06:02.128,000 --> 0:06:06,000
but rather, because members of their social circle were at risk.

131
0:06:07.823,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I am not suggesting that no one should ever be deported;

132
0:06:10.542,000 --> 0:06:11,000
don't confuse me with that.

133
0:06:12.417,000 --> 0:06:16,000
But what I am saying is that we need to look at the bigger picture.

134
0:06:17.692,000 --> 0:06:19,000
If you are within the sound of my voice,

135
0:06:20.069,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I want you to close your eyes for a moment

136
0:06:22.543,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and examine your own social circle.

137
0:06:25.923,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Who are your foreign-born?

138
0:06:28.12,000 --> 0:06:31,000
What would it feel like if the circle were broken?

139
0:06:32.488,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Share your story.

140
0:06:34.55,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I'm building a global archive of first-person accounts

141
0:06:37.198,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and linking them with mapping technology,

142
0:06:39.483,000 --> 0:06:42,000
so that we can see exactly where these circles break,

143
0:06:43.411,000 --> 0:06:46,000
because this is not just an American issue.

144
0:06:46.816,000 --> 0:06:49,000
There are a quarter-billion migrants around the world;

145
0:06:50.061,000 --> 0:06:54,000
people living, loving and learning in countries where they were not born.

146
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And in my career, in my life, I've been one of them:

147
0:06:56.816,000 --> 0:06:58,000
in China, in Africa, in Europe.

148
0:06:59.822,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And each time I become one of these foreigners --

149
0:07:02.996,000 --> 0:07:05,000
one of these strange-looking guys in a new land --

150
0:07:06.173,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I can't help but think back to that day

151
0:07:08.166,000 --> 0:07:1,000
when I was in Lower Manhattan with my mom

152
0:07:10.546,000 --> 0:07:11,000
all those decades ago,

153
0:07:12.474,000 --> 0:07:13,000
when I was scared,

154
0:07:14.096,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and I had just spotted that green lady.

155
0:07:17.624,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And I guess the question that I keep on thinking about

156
0:07:21.754,000 --> 0:07:22,000
when I see her

157
0:07:23.03,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and all the younger replicas of her that are so obviously brown,

158
0:07:27.314,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and even the paintings that showcase her in the beginning

159
0:07:30.151,000 --> 0:07:32,000
as not quite green --

160
0:07:33.532,000 --> 0:07:34,000
when I look at all of that,

161
0:07:36.038,000 --> 0:07:39,000
the question that my research seeks to answer

162
0:07:39.41,000 --> 0:07:43,000
becomes, to me, the same one that confounded me all those years ago:

163
0:07:44.652,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Is she a monster

164
0:07:47.011,000 --> 0:07:48,000
or a hero?

165
0:07:49.271,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Thank you.

166
0:07:50.445,000 --> 0:07:53,000

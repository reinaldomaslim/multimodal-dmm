2
0:00:15.766,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So, how many of you have ever

3
0:00:17.173,000 --> 0:00:18,000
gotten behind the wheel of a car

4
0:00:18.828,000 --> 0:00:23,000
when you really shouldn't have been driving?

5
0:00:24.515,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Maybe you're out on the road for a long day,

6
0:00:26.42,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and you just wanted to get home.

7
0:00:27.91,000 --> 0:00:29,000
You were tired, but you felt you could drive a few more miles.

8
0:00:30.557,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Maybe you thought,

9
0:00:31.756,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I've had less to drink than everybody else,

10
0:00:33.773,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I should be the one to go home.

11
0:00:35.509,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Or maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere.

12
0:00:40.1,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Does this sound familiar to you?

13
0:00:41.554,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Now, in those situations, wouldn't it be great

14
0:00:44.452,000 --> 0:00:45,000
if there was a button on your dashboard

15
0:00:46.045,000 --> 0:00:52,000
that you could push, and the car would get you home safely?

16
0:00:52.388,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Now, that's been the promise of the self-driving car,

17
0:00:54.681,000 --> 0:00:56,000
the autonomous vehicle, and it's been the dream

18
0:00:57.308,000 --> 0:01:,000
since at least 1939, when General Motors showcased

19
0:01:00.557,000 --> 0:01:03,000
this idea at their Futurama booth at the World's Fair.

20
0:01:03.859,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Now, it's been one of those dreams

21
0:01:05.802,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that's always seemed about 20 years in the future.

22
0:01:10.016,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Now, two weeks ago, that dream took a step forward,

23
0:01:12.699,000 --> 0:01:15,000
when the state of Nevada granted Google's self-driving car

24
0:01:15.964,000 --> 0:01:18,000
the very first license for an autonomous vehicle,

25
0:01:19.564,000 --> 0:01:21,000
clearly establishing that it's legal for them

26
0:01:21.809,000 --> 0:01:22,000
to test it on the roads in Nevada.

27
0:01:23.619,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Now, California's considering similar legislation,

28
0:01:27.346,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and this would make sure that the autonomous car

29
0:01:29.754,000 --> 0:01:31,000
is not one of those things that has to stay in Vegas.

30
0:01:32.731,000 --> 0:01:34,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:34.827,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Now, in my lab at Stanford, we've been working on

32
0:01:38.611,000 --> 0:01:41,000
autonomous cars too, but with a slightly different spin

33
0:01:42.098,000 --> 0:01:46,000
on things. You see, we've been developing robotic race cars,

34
0:01:46.346,000 --> 0:01:5,000
cars that can actually push themselves to the very limits

35
0:01:50.466,000 --> 0:01:52,000
of physical performance.

36
0:01:52.706,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Now, why would we want to do such a thing?

37
0:01:55.319,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Well, there's two really good reasons for this.

38
0:01:57.419,000 --> 0:02:,000
First, we believe that before people turn over control

39
0:02:01.378,000 --> 0:02:03,000
to an autonomous car, that autonomous car should be

40
0:02:04.212,000 --> 0:02:07,000
at least as good as the very best human drivers.

41
0:02:07.466,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Now, if you're like me, and the other 70 percent of the population

42
0:02:10.771,000 --> 0:02:12,000
who know that we are above-average drivers,

43
0:02:12.964,000 --> 0:02:15,000
you understand that's a very high bar.

44
0:02:16.139,000 --> 0:02:18,000
There's another reason as well.

45
0:02:18.531,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Just like race car drivers can use all of the friction

46
0:02:22.107,000 --> 0:02:23,000
between the tire and the road,

47
0:02:23.387,000 --> 0:02:26,000
all of the car's capabilities to go as fast as possible,

48
0:02:26.564,000 --> 0:02:29,000
we want to use all of those capabilities to avoid

49
0:02:29.909,000 --> 0:02:3,000
any accident we can.

50
0:02:31.497,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Now, you may push the car to the limits

51
0:02:33.547,000 --> 0:02:34,000
not because you're driving too fast,

52
0:02:35.514,000 --> 0:02:37,000
but because you've hit an icy patch of road,

53
0:02:37.674,000 --> 0:02:38,000
conditions have changed.

54
0:02:39.378,000 --> 0:02:41,000
In those situations, we want a car

55
0:02:42.139,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that is capable enough to avoid any accident

56
0:02:45.859,000 --> 0:02:47,000
that can physically be avoided.

57
0:02:48.537,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I must confess, there's kind of a third motivation as well.

58
0:02:52.804,000 --> 0:02:54,000
You see, I have a passion for racing.

59
0:02:55.06,000 --> 0:02:57,000
In the past, I've been a race car owner,

60
0:02:57.824,000 --> 0:02:59,000
a crew chief and a driving coach,

61
0:03:00.379,000 --> 0:03:03,000
although maybe not at the level that you're currently expecting.

62
0:03:04.234,000 --> 0:03:06,000
One of the things that we've developed in the lab --

63
0:03:06.938,000 --> 0:03:07,000
we've developed several vehicles --

64
0:03:08.642,000 --> 0:03:1,000
is what we believe is the world's first

65
0:03:10.877,000 --> 0:03:12,000
autonomously drifting car.

66
0:03:13.242,000 --> 0:03:15,000
It's another one of those categories

67
0:03:15.755,000 --> 0:03:17,000
where maybe there's not a lot of competition.

68
0:03:18.178,000 --> 0:03:19,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:19.586,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But this is P1. It's an entirely student-built electric vehicle,

70
0:03:23.408,000 --> 0:03:25,000
which through using its rear-wheel drive

71
0:03:25.486,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and front-wheel steer-by-wire

72
0:03:27.051,000 --> 0:03:29,000
can drift around corners.

73
0:03:29.118,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It can get sideways like a rally car driver,

74
0:03:31.318,000 --> 0:03:32,000
always able to take the tightest curve,

75
0:03:33.033,000 --> 0:03:36,000
even on slippery, changing surfaces,

76
0:03:36.337,000 --> 0:03:37,000
never spinning out.

77
0:03:37.953,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We've also worked with Volkswagen Oracle,

78
0:03:40.321,000 --> 0:03:43,000
on Shelley, an autonomous race car that has raced

79
0:03:43.745,000 --> 0:03:46,000
at 150 miles an hour through the Bonneville Salt Flats,

80
0:03:46.815,000 --> 0:03:5,000
gone around Thunderhill Raceway Park in the sun,

81
0:03:51.286,000 --> 0:03:53,000
the wind and the rain,

82
0:03:53.925,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and navigated the 153 turns and 12.4 miles

83
0:03:58.943,000 --> 0:03:59,000
of the Pikes Peak Hill Climb route

84
0:04:00.505,000 --> 0:04:03,000
in Colorado with nobody at the wheel.

85
0:04:03.978,000 --> 0:04:04,000
(Laughter)

86
0:04:05.426,000 --> 0:04:1,000
(Applause)

87
0:04:10.992,000 --> 0:04:13,000
I guess it goes without saying that we've had a lot of fun

88
0:04:14.271,000 --> 0:04:15,000
doing this.

89
0:04:15.575,000 --> 0:04:18,000
But in fact, there's something else that we've developed

90
0:04:19.232,000 --> 0:04:22,000
in the process of developing these autonomous cars.

91
0:04:22.287,000 --> 0:04:25,000
We have developed a tremendous appreciation

92
0:04:26.158,000 --> 0:04:29,000
for the capabilities of human race car drivers.

93
0:04:29.975,000 --> 0:04:33,000
As we've looked at the question of how well do these cars perform,

94
0:04:34.32,000 --> 0:04:37,000
we wanted to compare them to our human counterparts.

95
0:04:37.599,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And we discovered their human counterparts are amazing.

96
0:04:43.279,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Now, we can take a map of a race track,

97
0:04:47.302,000 --> 0:04:49,000
we can take a mathematical model of a car,

98
0:04:49.672,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and with some iteration, we can actually find

99
0:04:52.575,000 --> 0:04:53,000
the fastest way around that track.

100
0:04:54.2,000 --> 0:04:56,000
We line that up with data that we record

101
0:04:56.733,000 --> 0:04:57,000
from a professional driver,

102
0:04:58.166,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and the resemblance is absolutely remarkable.

103
0:05:02.273,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Yes, there are subtle differences here,

104
0:05:05.485,000 --> 0:05:08,000
but the human race car driver is able to go out

105
0:05:08.612,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and drive an amazingly fast line,

106
0:05:10.947,000 --> 0:05:12,000
without the benefit of an algorithm that compares

107
0:05:13.277,000 --> 0:05:15,000
the trade-off between going as fast as possible

108
0:05:15.885,000 --> 0:05:17,000
in this corner, and shaving a little bit of time

109
0:05:17.922,000 --> 0:05:18,000
off of the straight over here.

110
0:05:19.824,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Not only that, they're able to do it lap

111
0:05:23.281,000 --> 0:05:25,000
after lap after lap.

112
0:05:25.656,000 --> 0:05:27,000
They're able to go out and consistently do this,

113
0:05:28.568,000 --> 0:05:32,000
pushing the car to the limits every single time.

114
0:05:32.696,000 --> 0:05:35,000
It's extraordinary to watch.

115
0:05:35.865,000 --> 0:05:37,000
You put them in a new car,

116
0:05:37.931,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and after a few laps, they've found the fastest line in that car,

117
0:05:41.833,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and they're off to the races.

118
0:05:45.71,000 --> 0:05:46,000
It really makes you think,

119
0:05:46.856,000 --> 0:05:5,000
we'd love to know what's going on inside their brain.

120
0:05:51.727,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So as researchers, that's what we decided to find out.

121
0:05:56.268,000 --> 0:05:57,000
We decided to instrument not only the car,

122
0:05:58.08,000 --> 0:06:,000
but also the race car driver,

123
0:06:00.575,000 --> 0:06:02,000
to try to get a glimpse into what was going on

124
0:06:03.344,000 --> 0:06:05,000
in their head as they were doing this.

125
0:06:05.53,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Now, this is Dr. Lene Harbott applying electrodes

126
0:06:09.48,000 --> 0:06:1,000
to the head of John Morton.

127
0:06:10.712,000 --> 0:06:12,000
John Morton is a former Can-Am and IMSA driver,

128
0:06:13.701,000 --> 0:06:14,000
who's also a class champion at Le Mans.

129
0:06:15.501,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Fantastic driver, and very willing to put up with graduate students

130
0:06:18.997,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and this sort of research.

131
0:06:20.852,000 --> 0:06:22,000
She's putting electrodes on his head

132
0:06:23.524,000 --> 0:06:25,000
so that we can monitor the electrical activity

133
0:06:25.636,000 --> 0:06:27,000
in John's brain as he races around the track.

134
0:06:28.468,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Now, clearly we're not going to put a couple of electrodes on his head

135
0:06:31.663,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track.

136
0:06:34.933,000 --> 0:06:37,000
However, neuroscientists have identified certain patterns

137
0:06:38.34,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that let us tease out some very important aspects of this.

138
0:06:42.101,000 --> 0:06:43,000
For instance, the resting brain

139
0:06:43.948,000 --> 0:06:45,000
tends to generate a lot of alpha waves.

140
0:06:46.103,000 --> 0:06:49,000
In contrast, theta waves are associated with

141
0:06:49.855,000 --> 0:06:52,000
a lot of cognitive activity, like visual processing,

142
0:06:53.039,000 --> 0:06:56,000
things where the driver is thinking quite a bit.

143
0:06:56.087,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Now, we can measure this,

144
0:06:57.75,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and we can look at the relative power

145
0:06:59.735,000 --> 0:07:01,000
between the theta waves and the alpha waves.

146
0:07:01.935,000 --> 0:07:03,000
This gives us a measure of mental workload,

147
0:07:04.377,000 --> 0:07:07,000
how much the driver is actually challenged cognitively

148
0:07:07.944,000 --> 0:07:08,000
at any point along the track.

149
0:07:09.73,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Now, we wanted to see if we could actually record this

150
0:07:12.672,000 --> 0:07:15,000
on the track, so we headed down south to Laguna Seca.

151
0:07:15.71,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Laguna Seca is a legendary raceway

152
0:07:17.726,000 --> 0:07:19,000
about halfway between Salinas and Monterey.

153
0:07:20.027,000 --> 0:07:22,000
It has a curve there called the Corkscrew.

154
0:07:22.114,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Now, the Corkscrew is a chicane, followed by a quick

155
0:07:24.831,000 --> 0:07:26,000
right-handed turn as the road drops three stories.

156
0:07:27.577,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Now, the strategy for driving this as explained to me was,

157
0:07:31.343,000 --> 0:07:33,000
you aim for the bush in the distance,

158
0:07:33.365,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and as the road falls away, you realize it was actually the top of a tree.

159
0:07:36.39,000 --> 0:07:39,000
All right, so thanks to the Revs Program at Stanford,

160
0:07:39.694,000 --> 0:07:4,000
we were able to take John there

161
0:07:41.167,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and put him behind the wheel

162
0:07:42.131,000 --> 0:07:44,000
of a 1960 Porsche Abarth Carrera.

163
0:07:44.57,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Life is way too short for boring cars.

164
0:07:48.268,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So, here you see John on the track,

165
0:07:50.027,000 --> 0:07:52,000
he's going up the hill -- Oh! Somebody liked that --

166
0:07:52.211,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and you can see, actually, his mental workload

167
0:07:54.676,000 --> 0:07:56,000
-- measuring here in the red bar --

168
0:07:56.829,000 --> 0:07:58,000
you can see his actions as he approaches.

169
0:07:59.172,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Now watch, he has to downshift.

170
0:08:02.402,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And then he has to turn left.

171
0:08:03.163,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Look for the tree, and down.

172
0:08:07.156,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Not surprisingly, you can see this is a pretty challenging task.

173
0:08:09.994,000 --> 0:08:11,000
You can see his mental workload spike as he goes through this,

174
0:08:12.97,000 --> 0:08:14,000
as you would expect with something that requires

175
0:08:15.034,000 --> 0:08:17,000
this level of complexity.

176
0:08:17.843,000 --> 0:08:2,000
But what's really interesting is to look at areas of the track

177
0:08:21.259,000 --> 0:08:23,000
where his mental workload doesn't increase.

178
0:08:24.105,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I'm going to take you around now

179
0:08:25.6,000 --> 0:08:26,000
to the other side of the track.

180
0:08:26.689,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Turn three. And John's going to go into that corner

181
0:08:29.025,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and the rear end of the car is going to begin to slide out.

182
0:08:31.576,000 --> 0:08:33,000
He's going to have to correct for that with steering.

183
0:08:33.593,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So watch as John does this here.

184
0:08:35.824,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Watch the mental workload, and watch the steering.

185
0:08:38.146,000 --> 0:08:41,000
The car begins to slide out, dramatic maneuver to correct it,

186
0:08:41.818,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and no change whatsoever in the mental workload.

187
0:08:45.341,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Not a challenging task.

188
0:08:48.173,000 --> 0:08:51,000
In fact, entirely reflexive.

189
0:08:51.373,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Now, our data processing on this is still preliminary,

190
0:08:55.016,000 --> 0:08:57,000
but it really seems that these phenomenal feats

191
0:08:57.688,000 --> 0:08:58,000
that the race car drivers are performing

192
0:08:59.298,000 --> 0:09:,000
are instinctive.

193
0:09:01.208,000 --> 0:09:04,000
They are things that they have simply learned to do.

194
0:09:04.598,000 --> 0:09:06,000
It requires very little mental workload

195
0:09:06.88,000 --> 0:09:08,000
for them to perform these amazing feats.

196
0:09:09.704,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And their actions are fantastic.

197
0:09:12.839,000 --> 0:09:14,000
This is exactly what you want to do on the steering wheel

198
0:09:15.45,000 --> 0:09:18,000
to catch the car in this situation.

199
0:09:18.787,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Now, this has given us tremendous insight

200
0:09:22.232,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and inspiration for our own autonomous vehicles.

201
0:09:25.354,000 --> 0:09:26,000
We've started to ask the question:

202
0:09:27.282,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Can we make them a little less algorithmic

203
0:09:29.535,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and a little more intuitive?

204
0:09:31.984,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Can we take this reflexive action

205
0:09:34.265,000 --> 0:09:36,000
that we see from the very best race car drivers,

206
0:09:36.552,000 --> 0:09:37,000
introduce it to our cars,

207
0:09:38.201,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and maybe even into a system that could

208
0:09:40.185,000 --> 0:09:41,000
get onto your car in the future?

209
0:09:42.153,000 --> 0:09:43,000
That would take us a long step

210
0:09:43.764,000 --> 0:09:45,000
along the road to autonomous vehicles

211
0:09:46.273,000 --> 0:09:47,000
that drive as well as the best humans.

212
0:09:48.185,000 --> 0:09:51,000
But it's made us think a little bit more deeply as well.

213
0:09:51.625,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Do we want something more from our car

214
0:09:54.593,000 --> 0:09:55,000
than to simply be a chauffeur?

215
0:09:56.433,000 --> 0:10:,000
Do we want our car to perhaps be a partner, a coach,

216
0:10:00.668,000 --> 0:10:03,000
someone that can use their understanding of the situation

217
0:10:03.755,000 --> 0:10:07,000
to help us reach our potential?

218
0:10:08.011,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Can, in fact, the technology not simply replace humans,

219
0:10:10.284,000 --> 0:10:14,000
but allow us to reach the level of reflex and intuition

220
0:10:14.859,000 --> 0:10:17,000
that we're all capable of?

221
0:10:18.284,000 --> 0:10:19,000
So, as we move forward into this technological future,

222
0:10:20.207,000 --> 0:10:22,000
I want you to just pause and think of that for a moment.

223
0:10:23.028,000 --> 0:10:26,000
What is the ideal balance of human and machine?

224
0:10:26.803,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And as we think about that,

225
0:10:28.512,000 --> 0:10:29,000
let's take inspiration

226
0:10:30.243,000 --> 0:10:33,000
from the absolutely amazing capabilities

227
0:10:33.572,000 --> 0:10:35,000
of the human body and the human mind.

228
0:10:36.388,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Thank you.

229
0:10:38.124,000 --> 0:10:42,000
(Applause)

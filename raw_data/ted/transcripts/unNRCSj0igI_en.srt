1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
What I'm going to try and do in the next 15 minutes or so

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
is tell you about an idea

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
of how we're going to make matter come alive.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Now this may seem a bit ambitious,

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
but when you look at yourself, you look at your hands,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
you realize that you're alive.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
So this is a start.

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Now this quest started four billion years ago on planet Earth.

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
There's been four billion years

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
of organic, biological life.

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And as an inorganic chemist,

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
my friends and colleagues make this distinction

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
between the organic, living world

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and the inorganic, dead world.

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And what I'm going to try and do is plant some ideas

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
about how we can transform inorganic, dead matter

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
into living matter, into inorganic biology.

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Before we do that,

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I want to kind of put biology in its place.

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And I'm absolutely enthralled by biology.

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I love to do synthetic biology.

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I love things that are alive.

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I love manipulating the infrastructure of biology.

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But within that infrastructure,

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
we have to remember

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that the driving force of biology

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
is really coming from evolution.

28
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And evolution,

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
although it was established well over 100 years ago by Charles Darwin

30
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and a vast number of other people,

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
evolution still is a little bit intangible.

32
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And when I talk about Darwinian evolution,

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I mean one thing and one thing only,

34
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and that is survival of the fittest.

35
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And so forget about evolution

36
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
in a kind of metaphysical way.

37
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Think about evolution

38
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
in terms of offspring competing,

39
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and some winning.

40
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So bearing that in mind,

41
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
as a chemist, I wanted to ask myself

42
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
the question frustrated by biology:

43
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
What is the minimal unit of matter

44
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that can undergo Darwinian evolution?

45
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And this seems quite a profound question.

46
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
And as a chemist,

47
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
we're not used to profound questions every day.

48
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So when I thought about it,

49
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
then suddenly I realized

50
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
that biology gave us the answer.

51
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And in fact, the smallest unit of matter

52
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that can evolve independently

53
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
is, in fact, a single cell --

54
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
a bacteria.

55
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So this raises three really important questions:

56
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
What is life?

57
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Is biology special?

58
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Biologists seem to think so.

59
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Is matter evolvable?

60
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Now if we answer those questions in reverse order,

61
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
the third question -- is matter evolvable? --

62
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
if we can answer that,

63
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
then we're going to know how special biology is,

64
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and maybe, just maybe,

65
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
we'll have some idea of what life really is.

66
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So here's some inorganic life.

67
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
This is a dead crystal,

68
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and I'm going to do something to it,

69
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and it's going to become alive.

70
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And you can see,

71
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
it's kind of pollinating, germinating, growing.

72
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
This is an inorganic tube.

73
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And all these crystals here under the microscope

74
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
were dead a few minutes ago, and they look alive.

75
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Of course, they're not alive.

76
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
It's a chemistry experiment where I've made a crystal garden.

77
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
But when I saw this, I was really fascinated,

78
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
because it seemed lifelike.

79
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And as I pause for a few seconds, have a look at the screen.

80
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
You can see there's architecture growing, filling the void.

81
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And this is dead.

82
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So I was positive that,

83
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
if somehow we can make things mimic life,

84
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
let's go one step further.

85
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Let's see if we can actually make life.

86
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
But there's a problem,

87
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
because up until maybe a decade ago,

88
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
we were told that life was impossible

89
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and that we were the most incredible miracle in the universe.

90
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
In fact, we were the only people

91
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
in the universe.

92
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Now, that's a bit boring.

93
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So as a chemist,

94
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I wanted to say, "Hang on. What is going on here?

95
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Is life that improbable?"

96
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And this is really the question.

97
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I think that perhaps the emergence of the first cells

98
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
was as probable as the emergence of the stars.

99
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And in fact, let's take that one step further.

100
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Let's say

101
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
that if the physics of fusion

102
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
is encoded into the universe,

103
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
maybe the physics of life is as well.

104
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And so the problem with chemists --

105
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and this is a massive advantage as well --

106
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
is we like to focus on our elements.

107
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
In biology, carbon takes center stage.

108
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And in a universe where carbon exists

109
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and organic biology,

110
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
then we have all this wonderful diversity of life.

111
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
In fact, we have such amazing lifeforms that we can manipulate.

112
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
We're awfully careful in the lab

113
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
to try and avoid various biohazards.

114
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Well what about matter?

115
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
If we can make matter alive, would we have a matterhazard?

116
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So think, this is a serious question.

117
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
If your pen could replicate,

118
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that would be a bit of a problem.

119
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So we have to think differently

120
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
if we're going to make stuff come alive.

121
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And we also have to be aware of the issues.

122
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But before we can make life,

123
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
let's think for a second

124
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
what life really is characterized by.

125
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And forgive the complicated diagram.

126
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
This is just a collection of pathways in the cell.

127
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And the cell is obviously for us

128
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
a fascinating thing.

129
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Synthetic biologists are manipulating it.

130
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Chemists are trying to study the molecules to look at disease.

131
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And you have all these pathways going on at the same time.

132
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
You have regulation;

133
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
information is transcribed;

134
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
catalysts are made; stuff is happening.

135
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
But what does a cell do?

136
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Well it divides, it competes,

137
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
it survives.

138
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And I think that is where we have to start

139
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
in terms of thinking about

140
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
building from our ideas in life.

141
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But what else is life characterized by?

142
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Well, I like think of it

143
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
as a flame in a bottle.

144
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And so what we have here

145
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
is a description of single cells

146
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
replicating, metabolizing,

147
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
burning through chemistries.

148
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And so we have to understand

149
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
that if we're going to make artificial life or understand the origin of life,

150
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
we need to power it somehow.

151
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So before we can really start to make life,

152
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
we have to really think about where it came from.

153
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
And Darwin himself mused in a letter to a colleague

154
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that he thought that life probably emerged

155
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
in some warm little pond somewhere --

156
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
maybe not in Scotland, maybe in Africa,

157
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
maybe somewhere else.

158
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
But the real honest answer is, we just don't know,

159
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
because there is a problem with the origin.

160
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Imagine way back, four and a half billion years ago,

161
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
there is a vast chemical soup of stuff.

162
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And from this stuff we came.

163
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
So when you think about the improbable nature

164
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
of what I'm going to tell you in the next few minutes,

165
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
just remember,

166
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
we came from stuff on planet Earth.

167
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And we went through a variety of worlds.

168
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
The RNA people would talk about the RNA world.

169
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
We somehow got to proteins and DNA.

170
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
We then got to the last ancestor.

171
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Evolution kicked in -- and that's the cool bit.

172
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And here we are.

173
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
But there's a roadblock that you can't get past.

174
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
You can decode the genome, you can look back,

175
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
you can link us all together by a mitochondrial DNA,

176
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
but we can't get further than the last ancestor,

177
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
the last visible cell

178
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that we could sequence or think back in history.

179
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
So we don't know how we got here.

180
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So there are two options:

181
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
intelligent design, direct and indirect --

182
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
so God,

183
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
or my friend.

184
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Now talking about E.T. putting us there, or some other life,

185
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
just pushes the problem further on.

186
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I'm not a politician, I'm a scientist.

187
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
The other thing we need to think about

188
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
is the emergence of chemical complexity.

189
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
This seems most likely.

190
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So we have some kind of primordial soup.

191
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And this one happens to be

192
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
a good source of all 20 amino acids.

193
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And somehow

194
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
these amino acids are combined,

195
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and life begins.

196
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
But life begins, what does that mean?

197
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
What is life? What is this stuff of life?

198
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So in the 1950s,

199
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Miller-Urey did their fantastic chemical Frankenstein experiment,

200
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
where they did the equivalent in the chemical world.

201
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
They took the basic ingredients, put them in a single jar

202
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and ignited them

203
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and put a lot of voltage through.

204
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And they had a look at what was in the soup,

205
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and they found amino acids,

206
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
but nothing came out, there was no cell.

207
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
So the whole area's been stuck for a while,

208
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and it got reignited in the '80s

209
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
when analytical technologies and computer technologies were coming on.

210
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
In my own laboratory,

211
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
the way we're trying to create inorganic life

212
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
is by using many different reaction formats.

213
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
So what we're trying to do is do reactions --

214
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
not in one flask, but in tens of flasks,

215
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and connect them together,

216
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
as you can see with this flow system, all these pipes.

217
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
We can do it microfluidically, we can do it lithographically,

218
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
we can do it in a 3D printer,

219
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
we can do it in droplets for colleagues.

220
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And the key thing is to have lots of complex chemistry

221
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
just bubbling away.

222
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
But that's probably going to end in failure,

223
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
so we need to be a bit more focused.

224
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And the answer, of course, lies with mice.

225
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
This is how I remember what I need as a chemist.

226
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
I say, "Well I want molecules."

227
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
But I need a metabolism, I need some energy.

228
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I need some information, and I need a container.

229
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Because if I want evolution,

230
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I need containers to compete.

231
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
So if you have a container,

232
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
it's like getting in your car.

233
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
"This is my car,

234
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and I'm going to drive around and show off my car."

235
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And I imagine you have a similar thing

236
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
in cellular biology

237
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
with the emergence of life.

238
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
So these things together give us evolution, perhaps.

239
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And the way to test it in the laboratory

240
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
is to make it minimal.

241
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
So what we're going to try and do

242
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
is come up with an inorganic Lego kit of molecules.

243
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And so forgive the molecules on the screen,

244
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
but these are a very simple kit.

245
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
There's only maybe three or four different types of building blocks present.

246
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And we can aggregate them together

247
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and make literally thousands and thousands

248
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
of really big nano-molecular molecules

249
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
the same size of DNA and proteins,

250
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
but there's no carbon in sight.

251
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Carbon is banned.

252
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And so with this Lego kit,

253
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
we have the diversity required

254
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
for complex information storage

255
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
without DNA.

256
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
But we need to make some containers.

257
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And just a few months ago in my lab,

258
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
we were able to take these very same molecules and make cells with them.

259
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And you can see on the screen a cell being made.

260
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And we're now going to put some chemistry inside and do some chemistry in this cell.

261
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And all I wanted to show you

262
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
is we can set up molecules

263
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
in membranes, in real cells,

264
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and then it sets up a kind of molecular Darwinism,

265
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
a molecular survival of the fittest.

266
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And this movie here

267
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
shows this competition between molecules.

268
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Molecules are competing for stuff.

269
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
They're all made of the same stuff,

270
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
but they want their shape to win.

271
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
They want their shape to persist.

272
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And that is the key.

273
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
If we can somehow encourage these molecules

274
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
to talk to each other and make the right shapes and compete,

275
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
they will start to form cells

276
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
that will replicate and compete.

277
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
If we manage to do that,

278
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
forget the molecular detail.

279
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Let's zoom out to what that could mean.

280
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
So we have this special theory of evolution

281
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
that applies only to organic biology, to us.

282
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
If we could get evolution into the material world,

283
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
then I propose we should have a general theory of evolution.

284
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And that's really worth thinking about.

285
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Does evolution control

286
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
the sophistication of matter in the universe?

287
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Is there some driving force through evolution

288
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
that allows matter to compete?

289
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
So that means we could then start

290
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
to develop different platforms

291
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
for exploring this evolution.

292
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
So you imagine,

293
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
if we're able to create a self-sustaining artificial life form,

294
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
not only will this tell us about the origin of life --

295
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
that it's possible that the universe doesn't need carbon to be alive;

296
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
it can use anything --

297
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
we can then take [it] one step further and develop new technologies,

298
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
because we can then use software control

299
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
for evolution to code in.

300
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
So imagine we make a little cell.

301
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
We want to put it out in the environment,

302
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and we want it to be powered by the Sun.

303
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
What we do is we evolve it in a box with a light on.

304
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
And we don't use design anymore. We find what works.

305
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
We should take our inspiration from biology.

306
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Biology doesn't care about the design

307
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
unless it works.

308
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
So this will reorganize

309
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
the way we design things.

310
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
But not only just that,

311
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
we will start to think about

312
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
how we can start to develop a symbiotic relationship with biology.

313
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Wouldn't it be great

314
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
if you could take these artificial biological cells

315
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and fuse them with biological ones

316
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
to correct problems that we couldn't really deal with?

317
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
The real issue in cellular biology

318
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
is we are never going to understand everything,

319
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
because it's a multidimensional problem put there by evolution.

320
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Evolution cannot be cut apart.

321
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
You need to somehow find the fitness function.

322
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And the profound realization for me

323
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
is that, if this works,

324
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
the concept of the selfish gene gets kicked up a level,

325
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and we really start talking about selfish matter.

326
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And what does that mean in a universe

327
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
where we are right now the highest form of stuff?

328
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
You're sitting on chairs.

329
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
They're inanimate, they're not alive.

330
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
But you are made of stuff, and you are using stuff,

331
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and you enslave stuff.

332
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
So using evolution

333
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
in biology,

334
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and in inorganic biology,

335
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
for me is quite appealing, quite exciting.

336
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And we're really becoming very close

337
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
to understanding the key steps

338
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
that makes dead stuff come alive.

339
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And again, when you're thinking about how improbable this is,

340
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
remember, five billion years ago,

341
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
we were not here, and there was no life.

342
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
So what will that tell us

343
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
about the origin of life and the meaning of life?

344
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
But perhaps, for me as a chemist,

345
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
I want to keep away from general terms;

346
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
I want to think about specifics.

347
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
So what does it mean about defining life?

348
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
We really struggle to do this.

349
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
And I think, if we can make inorganic biology,

350
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and we can make matter become evolvable,

351
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
that will in fact define life.

352
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
I propose to you

353
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
that matter that can evolve is alive,

354
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and this gives us the idea of making evolvable matter.

355
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
Thank you very much.

356
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
(Applause)

357
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Chris Anderson: Just a quick question on timeline.

358
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
You believe you're going to be successful in this project?

359
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
When?

360
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Lee Cronin: So many people think

361
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
that life took millions of years to kick in.

362
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
We're proposing to do it in just a few hours,

363
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
once we've set up

364
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
the right chemistry.

365
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
CA: And when do you think that will happen?

366
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
LC: Hopefully within the next two years.

367
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
CA: That would be a big story.

368
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
(Laughter)

369
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
In your own mind, what do you believe the chances are

370
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
that walking around on some other planet

371
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
is non-carbon-based life,

372
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
walking or oozing or something?

373
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
LC: I think it's 100 percent.

374
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Because the thing is, we are so chauvinistic to biology,

375
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
if you take away carbon, there's other things that can happen.

376
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
So the other thing

377
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
that if we were able to create life that's not based on carbon,

378
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
maybe we can tell NASA what really to look for.

379
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
Don't go and look for carbon, go and look for evolvable stuff.

380
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
CA: Lee Cronin, good luck. (LC: Thank you very much.)

381
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.532,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I want to talk about one of the big questions,

2
0:00:16.078,000 --> 0:00:18,000
perhaps the biggest question:

3
0:00:18.636,000 --> 0:00:19,000
How should we live together?

4
0:00:20.5,000 --> 0:00:24,000
How should a group of people, who perhaps live in a city

5
0:00:24.975,000 --> 0:00:25,000
or in the continent

6
0:00:26.158,000 --> 0:00:27,000
or even the whole globe,

7
0:00:27.466,000 --> 0:00:29,000
share and manage common resources?

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
How should we make the rules that govern us?

9
0:00:33.236,000 --> 0:00:35,000
This has always been an important question.

10
0:00:35.561,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And today, I think it's even more important than ever

11
0:00:38.371,000 --> 0:00:43,000
if we want to address rising inequality, climate change, the refugee crisis,

12
0:00:43.505,000 --> 0:00:45,000
just to name a few major issues.

13
0:00:46.109,000 --> 0:00:48,000
It's also a very old question.

14
0:00:48.839,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Humans have been asking themselves this question

15
0:00:51.261,000 --> 0:00:53,000
ever since we lived in organized societies.

16
0:00:54.22,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Like this guy, Plato.

17
0:00:56.786,000 --> 0:00:58,000
He thought we needed benevolent guardians

18
0:00:58.935,000 --> 0:01:01,000
who could make decisions for the greater good of everyone.

19
0:01:02.695,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Kings and queens thought they could be those guardians,

20
0:01:06.298,000 --> 0:01:09,000
but during various revolutions, they tended to lose their heads.

21
0:01:10.473,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And this guy, you probably know.

22
0:01:12.895,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Here in Hungary, you lived for many years

23
0:01:14.99,000 --> 0:01:18,000
under one attempt to implement his answer of how to live together.

24
0:01:19.886,000 --> 0:01:22,000
His answer was brutal, cruel and inhumane.

25
0:01:23.315,000 --> 0:01:26,000
But a different answer, a different kind of answer,

26
0:01:26.522,000 --> 0:01:29,000
which went more or less into hibernation for 2,000 years,

27
0:01:30.411,000 --> 0:01:33,000
has had profound recent success.

28
0:01:33.552,000 --> 0:01:35,000
That answer is, of course, democracy.

29
0:01:36.839,000 --> 0:01:39,000
If we take a quick look at the modern history of democracy,

30
0:01:40.188,000 --> 0:01:41,000
it goes something like this.

31
0:01:41.847,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Along here, we're going to put the last 200 years.

32
0:01:45.164,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Up here, we're going to put the number of democracies.

33
0:01:48.204,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And the graph does this,

34
0:01:50.569,000 --> 0:01:51,000
the important point of which,

35
0:01:52.419,000 --> 0:01:55,000
is this extraordinary increase over time,

36
0:01:55.696,000 --> 0:01:56,000
which is why the 20th century

37
0:01:57.498,000 --> 0:02:,000
has been called the century of democracy's triumph,

38
0:02:00.665,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and why, as Francis Fukuyama said in 1989,

39
0:02:04.117,000 --> 0:02:07,000
some believe that we have reached the end of history,

40
0:02:07.146,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that the question of how to live together has been answered,

41
0:02:10.832,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and that answer is liberal democracy.

42
0:02:13.696,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Let's explore that assertion, though.

43
0:02:15.8,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I want to find out what you think.

44
0:02:17.68,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So I'm going to ask you two questions,

45
0:02:19.593,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and I want you to put your hands up

46
0:02:21.362,000 --> 0:02:22,000
if you agree.

47
0:02:22.537,000 --> 0:02:26,000
The first question is: Who thinks living in a democracy is a good thing?

48
0:02:27.246,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Who likes democracy?

49
0:02:28.732,000 --> 0:02:31,000
If you can think of a better system, keep your hands down.

50
0:02:31.756,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Don't worry about those who didn't raise their hands,

51
0:02:34.272,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I'm sure they mean very well.

52
0:02:35.696,000 --> 0:02:36,000
The second question is:

53
0:02:37.229,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Who thinks our democracies are functioning well?

54
0:02:41.908,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Come on, there must be one politician in the audience somewhere.

55
0:02:44.977,000 --> 0:02:45,000
(Laughter)

56
0:02:46.101,000 --> 0:02:47,000
No.

57
0:02:47.275,000 --> 0:02:51,000
But my point is, if liberal democracy is the end of history,

58
0:02:52.003,000 --> 0:02:55,000
then there's a massive paradox or contradiction here.

59
0:02:55.967,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Why is that?

60
0:02:57.143,000 --> 0:03:,000
Well, the first question is about the ideal of democracy,

61
0:03:01.018,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and all these qualities are very appealing.

62
0:03:04.345,000 --> 0:03:06,000
But in practice, it's not working.

63
0:03:06.385,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And that's the second question.

64
0:03:08.139,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Our politics is broken, our politicians aren't trusted,

65
0:03:12.347,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and the political system is distorted by powerful vested interests.

66
0:03:17.259,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I think there's two ways to resolve this paradox.

67
0:03:20.656,000 --> 0:03:23,000
One is to give up on democracy; it doesn't work.

68
0:03:23.959,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Let's elect a populist demagogue who will ignore democratic norms,

69
0:03:27.68,000 --> 0:03:28,000
trample on liberal freedoms

70
0:03:29.206,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and just get things done.

71
0:03:30.863,000 --> 0:03:33,000
The other option, I think, is to fix this broken system,

72
0:03:34.784,000 --> 0:03:36,000
to bring the practice closer to the ideal

73
0:03:37.665,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and put the diverse voices of society in our parliaments

74
0:03:41.173,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and get them to make considered, evidence-based laws

75
0:03:44.181,000 --> 0:03:46,000
for the long-term good of everyone.

76
0:03:46.245,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Which brings me to my epiphany,

77
0:03:48.562,000 --> 0:03:49,000
my moment of enlightenment.

78
0:03:50.221,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And I want you to get critical.

79
0:03:51.777,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I want you to ask yourselves, "Why wouldn't this work?"

80
0:03:54.6,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And then come and talk to me afterwards about it.

81
0:03:57.363,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Its technical name is "sortition."

82
0:04:00.196,000 --> 0:04:02,000
But its common name is "random selection."

83
0:04:03.029,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And the idea is actually very simple:

84
0:04:06.537,000 --> 0:04:09,000
we randomly select people and put them in parliament.

85
0:04:10.148,000 --> 0:04:11,000
(Laughter)

86
0:04:11.323,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Let's think about that for a few more minutes, shall we?

87
0:04:14.03,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Imagine we chose you and you and you and you and you down there

88
0:04:18.498,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and a bunch of other random people,

89
0:04:20.553,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and we put you in our parliament for the next couple of years.

90
0:04:23.719,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Of course, we could stratify the selection to make sure that it matched

91
0:04:28.012,000 --> 0:04:31,000
the socioeconomic and demographic profile of the country

92
0:04:31.616,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and was a truly representative sample of people.

93
0:04:35.022,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Fifty percent of them would be women.

94
0:04:37.624,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Many of them would be young, some would be old,

95
0:04:40.458,000 --> 0:04:41,000
a few would be rich,

96
0:04:41.807,000 --> 0:04:44,000
but most of them would be ordinary people like you and me.

97
0:04:46.396,000 --> 0:04:49,000
This would be a microcosm of society.

98
0:04:50.119,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And this microcosm would simulate how we would all think,

99
0:04:54.355,000 --> 0:04:57,000
if we had the time, the information

100
0:04:57.423,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and a good process to come to the moral crux of political decisions.

101
0:05:02.024,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And although you may not be in that group,

102
0:05:04.111,000 --> 0:05:06,000
someone of your age, someone of your gender,

103
0:05:06.286,000 --> 0:05:08,000
someone from your location and someone with your background

104
0:05:09.183,000 --> 0:05:1,000
would be in that room.

105
0:05:11.743,000 --> 0:05:15,000
The decisions made by these people would build on the wisdom of crowds.

106
0:05:15.887,000 --> 0:05:17,000
They would become more than the sum of their parts.

107
0:05:18.307,000 --> 0:05:2,000
They would become critical thinkers

108
0:05:20.355,000 --> 0:05:21,000
with access to experts,

109
0:05:22.199,000 --> 0:05:25,000
who would be on tap but not on top.

110
0:05:25.355,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And they could prove that diversity can trump ability

111
0:05:28.887,000 --> 0:05:32,000
when confronting the wide array of societal questions and problems.

112
0:05:34.466,000 --> 0:05:37,000
It would not be government by public opinion poll.

113
0:05:38.855,000 --> 0:05:41,000
It would not be government by referendum.

114
0:05:42.069,000 --> 0:05:47,000
These informed, deliberating people would move beyond public opinion

115
0:05:47.3,000 --> 0:05:49,000
to the making of public judgments.

116
0:05:50.866,000 --> 0:05:53,000
However, there would be one major side effect:

117
0:05:54.724,000 --> 0:05:56,000
if we replaced elections with sortition

118
0:05:57.58,000 --> 0:06:,000
and made our parliament truly representative of society,

119
0:06:01.292,000 --> 0:06:03,000
it would mean the end of politicians.

120
0:06:04.165,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And I'm sure we'd all be pretty sad to see that.

121
0:06:06.688,000 --> 0:06:08,000
(Laughter)

122
0:06:08.81,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Very interestingly,

123
0:06:10.546,000 --> 0:06:13,000
random selection was a key part of how democracy was done

124
0:06:14.259,000 --> 0:06:15,000
in ancient Athens.

125
0:06:16.149,000 --> 0:06:19,000
This machine, this device, is called a kleroteria.

126
0:06:19.546,000 --> 0:06:22,000
It's an ancient Athenian random-selection device.

127
0:06:23.053,000 --> 0:06:26,000
The ancient Athenians randomly selected citizens

128
0:06:26.3,000 --> 0:06:3,000
to fill the vast majority of their political posts.

129
0:06:30.828,000 --> 0:06:34,000
They knew that elections were aristocratic devices.

130
0:06:34.927,000 --> 0:06:38,000
They knew that career politicians were a thing to be avoided.

131
0:06:39.157,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And I think we know these things as well.

132
0:06:41.688,000 --> 0:06:44,000
But more interesting than the ancient use of random selection

133
0:06:45.505,000 --> 0:06:47,000
is its modern resurgence.

134
0:06:47.701,000 --> 0:06:51,000
The rediscovery of the legitimacy of random selection in politics

135
0:06:52.455,000 --> 0:06:53,000
has become so common lately,

136
0:06:54.343,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that there's simply too many examples to talk about.

137
0:06:57.053,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Of course, I'm very aware that it's going to be difficult

138
0:06:59.863,000 --> 0:07:01,000
to institute this in our parliaments.

139
0:07:02.514,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Try this -- say to your friend,

140
0:07:04.252,000 --> 0:07:07,000
"I think we should populate our parliament with randomly selected people."

141
0:07:08.085,000 --> 0:07:09,000
"Are you joking?

142
0:07:09.274,000 --> 0:07:1,000
What if my neighbor gets chosen?

143
0:07:10.832,000 --> 0:07:12,000
The fool can't even separate his recycling."

144
0:07:13.331,000 --> 0:07:17,000
But the perhaps surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence

145
0:07:18.101,000 --> 0:07:19,000
from all these modern examples

146
0:07:20.046,000 --> 0:07:21,000
is that it does work.

147
0:07:22.014,000 --> 0:07:26,000
If you give people responsibility, they act responsibly.

148
0:07:26.678,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Don't get me wrong -- it's not a panacea.

149
0:07:28.958,000 --> 0:07:31,000
The question is not: Would this be perfect?

150
0:07:31.99,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Of course not.

151
0:07:33.165,000 --> 0:07:34,000
People are fallibly human,

152
0:07:34.554,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and distorting influences will continue to exist.

153
0:07:37.875,000 --> 0:07:39,000
The question is: Would it be better?

154
0:07:40.6,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And the answer to that question, to me at least, is obviously yes.

155
0:07:45.252,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Which gets us back to our original question:

156
0:07:49.01,000 --> 0:07:5,000
How should we live together?

157
0:07:50.975,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And now we have an answer:

158
0:07:52.753,000 --> 0:07:55,000
with a parliament that uses sortition.

159
0:07:56.745,000 --> 0:07:58,000
But how would we get from here to there?

160
0:07:59.617,000 --> 0:08:01,000
How could we fix our broken system

161
0:08:01.982,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and remake democracy for the 21st century?

162
0:08:05.784,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Well, there are several things that we can do,

163
0:08:09.03,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and that are, in fact, happening right now.

164
0:08:12.125,000 --> 0:08:13,000
We can experiment with sortition.

165
0:08:13.991,000 --> 0:08:17,000
We can introduce it to schools and workplaces and other institutions,

166
0:08:18.244,000 --> 0:08:21,000
like Democracy In Practice is doing in Bolivia.

167
0:08:21.355,000 --> 0:08:24,000
We can hold policy juries and citizens' assemblies,

168
0:08:24.577,000 --> 0:08:27,000
like the newDemocracy Foundation is doing in Australia,

169
0:08:27.635,000 --> 0:08:29,000
like the Jefferson Center is doing in the US

170
0:08:30.071,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and like the Irish government is doing right now.

171
0:08:33.508,000 --> 0:08:35,000
We could build a social movement demanding change,

172
0:08:36.428,000 --> 0:08:39,000
which is what the Sortition Foundation is doing in the UK.

173
0:08:40.062,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And at some point, we should institute it.

174
0:08:42.506,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Perhaps the first step would be a second chamber in our parliament,

175
0:08:46.808,000 --> 0:08:48,000
full of randomly selected people --

176
0:08:49.006,000 --> 0:08:51,000
a citizens' senate, if you will.

177
0:08:51.324,000 --> 0:08:54,000
There's a campaign for a citizens' senate in France

178
0:08:54.457,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and another campaign in Scotland,

179
0:08:56.728,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and it could, of course, be done right here in Hungary.

180
0:08:59.831,000 --> 0:09:03,000
That would be kind of like a Trojan horse right into the heart of government.

181
0:09:05.136,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And then, when it becomes impossible

182
0:09:07.141,000 --> 0:09:09,000
to patch over the cracks in the current system,

183
0:09:09.72,000 --> 0:09:12,000
we must step up and replace elections with sortition.

184
0:09:13.332,000 --> 0:09:14,000
I have hope.

185
0:09:14.61,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Here in Hungary, systems have been created,

186
0:09:16.966,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and systems have been torn down and replaced

187
0:09:19.077,000 --> 0:09:2,000
in the past.

188
0:09:20.31,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Change can and does happen.

189
0:09:23.15,000 --> 0:09:25,000
It's just a matter of when and how.

190
0:09:25.786,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Thank you. (Hungarian) Thank you.

191
0:09:27.413,000 --> 0:09:29,000
(Applause)

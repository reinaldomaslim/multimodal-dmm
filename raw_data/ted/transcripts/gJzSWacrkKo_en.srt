1
0:00:12.733,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Just over a mile away from here, in Edinburgh's Old Town,

2
0:00:18.689,000 --> 0:00:19,000
is Panmure House.

3
0:00:21.775,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Panmure House

4
0:00:23.294,000 --> 0:00:29,000
was the home of the world-renowned Scottish economist

5
0:00:29.629,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Adam Smith.

6
0:00:31.761,000 --> 0:00:36,000
In his important work "The Wealth of Nations,"

7
0:00:37.193,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Adam Smith argued, amongst many other things,

8
0:00:41.04,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that the measurement of a country's wealth

9
0:00:44.041,000 --> 0:00:48,000
was not just its gold and silver reserves.

10
0:00:48.483,000 --> 0:00:53,000
It was the totality of the country's production and commerce.

11
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
I guess it was one of the earliest descriptions of what we now know today

12
0:01:00.553,000 --> 0:01:03,000
as gross domestic product, GDP.

13
0:01:05.176,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Now, in the years since, of course,

14
0:01:08.302,000 --> 0:01:13,000
that measurement of production and commerce, GDP,

15
0:01:13.739,000 --> 0:01:15,000
has become ever more important,

16
0:01:16.704,000 --> 0:01:17,000
to the point that today --

17
0:01:18.009,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and I don't believe this is what Adam Smith would have intended --

18
0:01:21.97,000 --> 0:01:26,000
that it is often seen as the most important measurement

19
0:01:27.189,000 --> 0:01:29,000
of a country's overall success.

20
0:01:30.242,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And my argument today is that it is time for that to change.

21
0:01:36.853,000 --> 0:01:4,000
You know, what we choose to measure as a country matters.

22
0:01:41.854,000 --> 0:01:45,000
It really matters, because it drives political focus,

23
0:01:46.369,000 --> 0:01:5,000
it drives public activity.

24
0:01:50.395,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And against that context,

25
0:01:52.497,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I think the limitations of GDP as a measurement of a country's success

26
0:01:59.037,000 --> 0:02:02,000
are all too obvious.

27
0:02:02.3,000 --> 0:02:07,000
You know, GDP measures the output of all of our work,

28
0:02:07.511,000 --> 0:02:1,000
but it says nothing about the nature of that work,

29
0:02:10.961,000 --> 0:02:14,000
about whether that work is worthwhile or fulfilling.

30
0:02:15.417,000 --> 0:02:21,000
It puts a value, for example, on illegal drug consumption,

31
0:02:21.98,000 --> 0:02:23,000
but not on unpaid care.

32
0:02:25.708,000 --> 0:02:29,000
It values activity in the short term

33
0:02:30.422,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that boosts the economy, even if that activity is hugely damaging

34
0:02:37.091,000 --> 0:02:41,000
to the sustainability of our planet in the longer term.

35
0:02:42.533,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And we reflect on the past decade

36
0:02:46.249,000 --> 0:02:49,000
of political and economic upheaval,

37
0:02:49.681,000 --> 0:02:52,000
of growing inequalities,

38
0:02:52.708,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and when we look ahead to the challenges of the climate emergency,

39
0:02:58.084,000 --> 0:03:,000
increasing automation,

40
0:03:00.374,000 --> 0:03:03,000
an aging population,

41
0:03:03.687,000 --> 0:03:1,000
then I think the argument for the case for a much broader definition

42
0:03:10.711,000 --> 0:03:14,000
of what it means to be successful as a country, as a society,

43
0:03:15.37,000 --> 0:03:18,000
is compelling, and increasingly so.

44
0:03:19.253,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And that is why Scotland, in 2018,

45
0:03:22.103,000 --> 0:03:26,000
took the lead, took the initiative in establishing a new network

46
0:03:27.008,000 --> 0:03:32,000
called the Wellbeing Economy Governments group,

47
0:03:32.936,000 --> 0:03:34,000
bringing together as founding members

48
0:03:35.24,000 --> 0:03:41,000
the countries of Scotland, Iceland and New Zealand, for obvious reasons.

49
0:03:41.836,000 --> 0:03:44,000
We're sometimes called the SIN countries,

50
0:03:45.439,000 --> 0:03:48,000
although our focus is very much on the common good.

51
0:03:50.445,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And the purpose of this group is to challenge that focus

52
0:03:53.797,000 --> 0:03:55,000
on the narrow measurement of GDP.

53
0:03:56.52,000 --> 0:03:59,000
To say that, yes, economic growth matters --

54
0:04:00.274,000 --> 0:04:01,000
it is important --

55
0:04:02.195,000 --> 0:04:05,000
but it is not all that is important.

56
0:04:05.94,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And growth in GDP should not be pursued at any or all cost.

57
0:04:12.903,000 --> 0:04:14,000
In fact, the argument of that group

58
0:04:15.657,000 --> 0:04:19,000
is that the goal, the objective of economic policy

59
0:04:20.332,000 --> 0:04:23,000
should be collective well-being:

60
0:04:23.465,000 --> 0:04:26,000
how happy and healthy a population is,

61
0:04:27.377,000 --> 0:04:3,000
not just how wealthy a population is.

62
0:04:30.767,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And I'll touch on the policy implications of that in a moment.

63
0:04:34.374,000 --> 0:04:36,000
But I think, particularly in the world we live in today,

64
0:04:37.319,000 --> 0:04:39,000
it has a deeper resonance.

65
0:04:39.525,000 --> 0:04:41,000
You know, when we focus on well-being,

66
0:04:42.089,000 --> 0:04:44,000
we start a conversation

67
0:04:44.948,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that provokes profound and fundamental questions.

68
0:04:48.933,000 --> 0:04:51,000
What really matters to us in our lives?

69
0:04:52.935,000 --> 0:04:56,000
What do we value in the communities we live in?

70
0:04:57.341,000 --> 0:05:,000
What kind of country, what kind of society,

71
0:05:01.11,000 --> 0:05:03,000
do we really want to be?

72
0:05:03.885,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And when we engage people in those questions,

73
0:05:07.219,000 --> 0:05:09,000
in finding the answers to those questions,

74
0:05:09.309,000 --> 0:05:12,000
then I believe that we have a much better chance

75
0:05:13.226,000 --> 0:05:18,000
of addressing the alienation and disaffection from politics

76
0:05:18.646,000 --> 0:05:2,000
that is so prevalent in so many countries

77
0:05:21.15,000 --> 0:05:23,000
across the developed world today.

78
0:05:24.36,000 --> 0:05:27,000
In policy terms, this journey for Scotland started back in 2007,

79
0:05:28.186,000 --> 0:05:31,000
when we published what we call our National Performance Framework,

80
0:05:32.087,000 --> 0:05:35,000
looking at the range of indicators that we measure ourselves against.

81
0:05:35.969,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And those indicators are as varied as income inequality,

82
0:05:40.302,000 --> 0:05:41,000
the happiness of children,

83
0:05:42.168,000 --> 0:05:45,000
access to green spaces, access to housing.

84
0:05:45.93,000 --> 0:05:48,000
None of these are captured in GDP statistics,

85
0:05:49.865,000 --> 0:05:55,000
but they are all fundamental to a healthy and a happy society.

86
0:05:56.087,000 --> 0:06:01,000
(Applause)

87
0:06:01.745,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And that broader approach is at the heart of our economic strategy,

88
0:06:05.34,000 --> 0:06:08,000
where we give equal importance to tackling inequality

89
0:06:09.223,000 --> 0:06:12,000
as we do to economic competitiveness.

90
0:06:12.495,000 --> 0:06:13,000
It drives our commitment to fair work,

91
0:06:14.409,000 --> 0:06:16,000
making sure that work is fulfilling and well-paid.

92
0:06:17.258,000 --> 0:06:21,000
It's behind our decision to establish a Just Transition Commission

93
0:06:21.425,000 --> 0:06:24,000
to guide our path to a carbon zero economy.

94
0:06:25.427,000 --> 0:06:28,000
We know from economic transformations of the past

95
0:06:28.816,000 --> 0:06:31,000
that if we're not careful, there are more losers than winners.

96
0:06:32.577,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And as we face up to the challenges of climate change and automation,

97
0:06:36.569,000 --> 0:06:39,000
we must not make those mistakes again.

98
0:06:40.608,000 --> 0:06:43,000
The work we're doing here in Scotland is, I think, significant,

99
0:06:43.713,000 --> 0:06:46,000
but we have much, much to learn from other countries.

100
0:06:46.955,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I mentioned, a moment ago, our partner nations

101
0:06:50.178,000 --> 0:06:52,000
in the Wellbeing network:

102
0:06:52.839,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Iceland and New Zealand.

103
0:06:54.721,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It's worth noting, and I'll leave it to you to decide whether this is relevant or not,

104
0:06:58.928,000 --> 0:07:01,000
that all three of these countries are currently led by women.

105
0:07:02.722,000 --> 0:07:09,000
(Applause)

106
0:07:14.001,000 --> 0:07:15,000
They, too, are doing great work.

107
0:07:15.954,000 --> 0:07:19,000
New Zealand, in 2019, publishing its first Wellbeing Budget,

108
0:07:20.805,000 --> 0:07:22,000
with mental health at its heart;

109
0:07:23.431,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Iceland leading the way on equal pay, childcare and paternity rights --

110
0:07:28.708,000 --> 0:07:31,000
not policies that we immediately think of

111
0:07:32.193,000 --> 0:07:34,000
when we talk about creating a wealthy economy,

112
0:07:35.042,000 --> 0:07:39,000
but policies that are fundamental to a healthy economy

113
0:07:39.644,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and a happy society.

114
0:07:42.176,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I started with Adam Smith and "The Wealth of Nations."

115
0:07:47.137,000 --> 0:07:52,000
In Adam Smith's earlier work, "The Theory of Moral Sentiments,"

116
0:07:52.356,000 --> 0:07:54,000
which I think is just as important,

117
0:07:54.934,000 --> 0:07:58,000
he made the observation that the value of any government

118
0:07:59.487,000 --> 0:08:,000
is judged in proportion

119
0:08:01.369,000 --> 0:08:03,000
to the extent that it makes its people happy.

120
0:08:04.83,000 --> 0:08:07,000
I think that is a good founding principle

121
0:08:08.521,000 --> 0:08:13,000
for any group of countries focused on promoting well-being.

122
0:08:14.403,000 --> 0:08:16,000
None of us have all of the answers,

123
0:08:17.015,000 --> 0:08:2,000
not even Scotland, the birthplace of Adam Smith.

124
0:08:20.716,000 --> 0:08:24,000
But in the world we live in today, with growing divides and inequalities,

125
0:08:25.472,000 --> 0:08:27,000
with disaffection and alienation,

126
0:08:28.06,000 --> 0:08:29,000
it is more important than ever

127
0:08:29.854,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that we ask and find the answers to those questions

128
0:08:33.948,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and promote a vision of society

129
0:08:37.592,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that has well-being, not just wealth, at its very heart.

130
0:08:44.347,000 --> 0:08:49,000
(Applause)

131
0:08:49.888,000 --> 0:08:54,000
You are right now in the beautiful, sunny capital city ...

132
0:08:55.357,000 --> 0:08:56,000
(Laughter)

133
0:08:57.127,000 --> 0:09:02,000
of the country that led the world in the Enlightenment,

134
0:09:02.477,000 --> 0:09:05,000
the country that helped lead the world into the industrial age,

135
0:09:05.533,000 --> 0:09:07,000
the country that right now is helping to lead the world

136
0:09:08.382,000 --> 0:09:1,000
into the low carbon age.

137
0:09:10.66,000 --> 0:09:15,000
I want, and I'm determined, that Scotland will also be the country

138
0:09:16.094,000 --> 0:09:2,000
that helps change the focus of countries and governments across the world

139
0:09:21.115,000 --> 0:09:25,000
to put well-being at the heart of everything that we do.

140
0:09:25.624,000 --> 0:09:28,000
I think we owe that to this generation.

141
0:09:29.53,000 --> 0:09:32,000
I certainly believe we owe that to the next generation

142
0:09:33.364,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and all those that come after us.

143
0:09:35.602,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And if we do that, led here from the country of the Enlightenment,

144
0:09:39.491,000 --> 0:09:43,000
then I think we create a better, healthier, fairer

145
0:09:43.809,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and happier society here at home.

146
0:09:46.264,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And we play our part in Scotland

147
0:09:48.318,000 --> 0:09:52,000
in building a fairer, happier world as well.

148
0:09:52.556,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Thank you very much.

149
0:09:53.969,000 --> 0:09:58,000
(Applause)

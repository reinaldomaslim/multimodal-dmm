[This talk contains graphic language and descriptions of sexual violence

3
0:00:16.713,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Tom Stranger: In 1996, when I was 18 years old,

4
0:00:19.693,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I had the golden opportunity to go on an international exchange program.

5
0:00:23.891,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Ironically I'm an Australian who prefers proper icy cold weather,

6
0:00:27.636,000 --> 0:00:31,000
so I was both excited and tearful when I got on a plane to Iceland,

7
0:00:32.519,000 --> 0:00:35,000
after just having farewelled my parents and brothers goodbye.

8
0:00:36.673,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I was welcomed into the home of a beautiful Icelandic family

9
0:00:39.752,000 --> 0:00:4,000
who took me hiking,

10
0:00:41.177,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and helped me get a grasp of the melodic Icelandic language.

11
0:00:45.033,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I struggled a bit with the initial period of homesickness.

12
0:00:48.045,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I snowboarded after school,

13
0:00:50.067,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and I slept a lot.

14
0:00:52.3,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Two hours of chemistry class in a language that you don't yet fully understand

15
0:00:56.262,000 --> 0:00:57,000
can be a pretty good sedative.

16
0:00:58.068,000 --> 0:00:59,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:00.456,000 --> 0:01:02,000
My teacher recommended I try out for the school play,

18
0:01:03.004,000 --> 0:01:05,000
just to get me a bit more socially active.

19
0:01:05.914,000 --> 0:01:07,000
It turns out I didn't end up being part of the play,

20
0:01:08.439,000 --> 0:01:09,000
but through it I met Thordis.

21
0:01:11.271,000 --> 0:01:13,000
We shared a lovely teenage romance,

22
0:01:13.358,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and we'd meet at lunchtimes to just hold hands

23
0:01:15.876,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and walk around old downtown Reykjavík.

24
0:01:18.475,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I met her welcoming family, and she met my friends.

25
0:01:22.495,000 --> 0:01:24,000
We'd been in a budding relationship for a bit over a month

26
0:01:25.293,000 --> 0:01:27,000
when our school's Christmas Ball was held.

27
0:01:29.872,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Thordis Elva: I was 16 and in love for the first time.

28
0:01:33.617,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Going together to the Christmas dance

29
0:01:35.438,000 --> 0:01:37,000
was a public confirmation of our relationship,

30
0:01:38.259,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and I felt like the luckiest girl in the world.

31
0:01:41.25,000 --> 0:01:43,000
No longer a child, but a young woman.

32
0:01:44.55,000 --> 0:01:45,000
High on my newfound maturity,

33
0:01:46.487,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I felt it was only natural to try drinking rum for the first time that night, too.

34
0:01:51.316,000 --> 0:01:53,000
That was a bad idea.

35
0:01:53.402,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I became very ill,

36
0:01:54.914,000 --> 0:01:55,000
drifting in and out of consciousness

37
0:01:56.758,000 --> 0:01:59,000
in between spasms of convulsive vomiting.

38
0:01:59.907,000 --> 0:02:01,000
The security guards wanted to call me an ambulance,

39
0:02:02.895,000 --> 0:02:04,000
but Tom acted as my knight in shining armor,

40
0:02:05.908,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and told them he'd take me home.

41
0:02:08.602,000 --> 0:02:09,000
It was like a fairy tale,

42
0:02:10.327,000 --> 0:02:11,000
his strong arms around me,

43
0:02:12.127,000 --> 0:02:14,000
laying me in the safety of my bed.

44
0:02:15.422,000 --> 0:02:19,000
But the gratitude that I felt towards him soon turned to horror

45
0:02:19.973,000 --> 0:02:23,000
as he proceeded to take off my clothes and get on top of me.

46
0:02:25.277,000 --> 0:02:26,000
My head had cleared up,

47
0:02:26.637,000 --> 0:02:29,000
but my body was still too weak to fight back,

48
0:02:29.788,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and the pain was blinding.

49
0:02:32.585,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I thought I'd be severed in two.

50
0:02:35.624,000 --> 0:02:36,000
In order to stay sane,

51
0:02:37.223,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I silently counted the seconds on my alarm clock.

52
0:02:41.442,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And ever since that night,

53
0:02:43.201,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I've known that there are 7,200 seconds in two hours.

54
0:02:50.96,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Despite limping for days and crying for weeks,

55
0:02:54.222,000 --> 0:02:58,000
this incident didn't fit my ideas about rape like I'd seen on TV.

56
0:02:59.181,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Tom wasn't an armed lunatic;

57
0:03:01.226,000 --> 0:03:02,000
he was my boyfriend.

58
0:03:03.013,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And it didn't happen in a seedy alleyway,

59
0:03:05.646,000 --> 0:03:07,000
it happened in my own bed.

60
0:03:08.553,000 --> 0:03:11,000
By the time I could identify what had happened to me as rape,

61
0:03:12.196,000 --> 0:03:13,000
he had completed his exchange program

62
0:03:14.211,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and left for Australia.

63
0:03:16.352,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So I told myself it was pointless to address what had happened.

64
0:03:20.019,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And besides,

65
0:03:21.228,000 --> 0:03:23,000
it had to have been my fault, somehow.

66
0:03:24.505,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I was raised in a world where girls are taught

67
0:03:26.834,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that they get raped for a reason.

68
0:03:29.604,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Their skirt was too short,

69
0:03:32.193,000 --> 0:03:34,000
their smile was too wide,

70
0:03:34.711,000 --> 0:03:36,000
their breath smelled of alcohol.

71
0:03:37.837,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And I was guilty of all of those things,

72
0:03:40.627,000 --> 0:03:42,000
so the shame had to be mine.

73
0:03:43.495,000 --> 0:03:44,000
It took me years to realize

74
0:03:44.943,000 --> 0:03:47,000
that only one thing could have stopped me from being raped that night,

75
0:03:48.878,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and it wasn't my skirt,

76
0:03:51.044,000 --> 0:03:52,000
it wasn't my smile,

77
0:03:53.018,000 --> 0:03:55,000
it wasn't my childish trust.

78
0:03:55.652,000 --> 0:03:58,000
The only thing that could've stopped me from being raped that night

79
0:03:59.41,000 --> 0:04:01,000
is the man who raped me --

80
0:04:01.484,000 --> 0:04:03,000
had he stopped himself.

81
0:04:04.549,000 --> 0:04:06,000
TS: I have vague memories of the next day:

82
0:04:07.536,000 --> 0:04:09,000
the after effects of drinking,

83
0:04:09.874,000 --> 0:04:11,000
a certain hollowness that I tried to stifle.

84
0:04:13.451,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Nothing more.

85
0:04:15.565,000 --> 0:04:17,000
But I didn't show up at Thordis's door.

86
0:04:19.229,000 --> 0:04:2,000
It is important to now state

87
0:04:21.059,000 --> 0:04:23,000
that I didn't see my deed for what it was.

88
0:04:24.478,000 --> 0:04:27,000
The word "rape" didn't echo around my mind as it should've,

89
0:04:28.459,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and I wasn't crucifying myself with memories of the night before.

90
0:04:33.344,000 --> 0:04:35,000
It wasn't so much a conscious refusal,

91
0:04:35.742,000 --> 0:04:38,000
it was more like any acknowledgment of reality was forbidden.

92
0:04:40.185,000 --> 0:04:44,000
My definition of my actions completely refuted any recognition

93
0:04:44.323,000 --> 0:04:46,000
of the immense trauma I caused Thordis.

94
0:04:48.274,000 --> 0:04:49,000
To be honest,

95
0:04:49.701,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I repudiated the entire act in the days afterwards

96
0:04:54.578,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and when I was committing it.

97
0:04:57.263,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I disavowed the truth by convincing myself it was sex and not rape.

98
0:05:02.608,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And this is a lie I've felt spine-bending guilt for.

99
0:05:07.994,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I broke up with Thordis a couple of days later,

100
0:05:10.265,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and then saw her a number of times

101
0:05:11.933,000 --> 0:05:13,000
during the remainder of my year in Iceland,

102
0:05:14.015,000 --> 0:05:16,000
feeling a sharp stab of heavyheartedness each time.

103
0:05:18.134,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Deep down, I knew I'd done something immeasurably wrong.

104
0:05:23.146,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But without planning it, I sunk the memories deep,

105
0:05:26.193,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and then I tied a rock to them.

106
0:05:30.035,000 --> 0:05:31,000
What followed is a nine-year period

107
0:05:31.805,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that can best be titled as "Denial and Running."

108
0:05:35.83,000 --> 0:05:39,000
When I got a chance to identify the real torment that I caused,

109
0:05:40.333,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I didn't stand still long enough to do so.

110
0:05:43.922,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Whether it be via distraction,

111
0:05:46.003,000 --> 0:05:47,000
substance use,

112
0:05:47.503,000 --> 0:05:48,000
thrill-seeking

113
0:05:49.145,000 --> 0:05:52,000
or the scrupulous policing of my inner speak,

114
0:05:52.518,000 --> 0:05:54,000
I refused to be static and silent.

115
0:05:56.747,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And with this noise,

116
0:05:58.231,000 --> 0:06:,000
I also drew heavily upon other parts of my life

117
0:06:01.224,000 --> 0:06:03,000
to construct a picture of who I was.

118
0:06:04.456,000 --> 0:06:05,000
I was a surfer,

119
0:06:05.71,000 --> 0:06:06,000
a social science student,

120
0:06:07.451,000 --> 0:06:09,000
a friend to good people,

121
0:06:09.561,000 --> 0:06:11,000
a loved brother and son,

122
0:06:11.843,000 --> 0:06:12,000
an outdoor recreation guide,

123
0:06:13.419,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and eventually, a youth worker.

124
0:06:15.939,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I gripped tight to the simple notion that I wasn't a bad person.

125
0:06:21.28,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I didn't think I had this in my bones.

126
0:06:23.949,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I thought I was made up of something else.

127
0:06:26.428,000 --> 0:06:27,000
In my nurtured upbringing,

128
0:06:28.012,000 --> 0:06:3,000
my loving extended family and role models,

129
0:06:31.406,000 --> 0:06:32,000
people close to me were warm and genuine

130
0:06:33.365,000 --> 0:06:34,000
in their respect shown towards women.

131
0:06:36.537,000 --> 0:06:4,000
It took me a long time to stare down this dark corner of myself,

132
0:06:41.387,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and to ask it questions.

133
0:06:46.051,000 --> 0:06:47,000
TE: Nine years after the Christmas dance,

134
0:06:48.05,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I was 25 years old,

135
0:06:49.555,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and headed straight for a nervous breakdown.

136
0:06:52.918,000 --> 0:06:55,000
My self-worth was buried under a soul-crushing load of silence

137
0:06:56.566,000 --> 0:06:59,000
that isolated me from everyone that I cared about,

138
0:06:59.882,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and I was consumed with misplaced hatred and anger

139
0:07:02.811,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that I took out on myself.

140
0:07:05.455,000 --> 0:07:07,000
One day, I stormed out of the door in tears

141
0:07:08.089,000 --> 0:07:09,000
after a fight with a loved one,

142
0:07:10.056,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and I wandered into a café,

143
0:07:11.779,000 --> 0:07:13,000
where I asked the waitress for a pen.

144
0:07:14.468,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I always had a notebook with me,

145
0:07:16.338,000 --> 0:07:19,000
claiming that it was to jot down ideas in moments of inspiration,

146
0:07:20.095,000 --> 0:07:24,000
but the truth was that I needed to be constantly fidgeting,

147
0:07:24.349,000 --> 0:07:25,000
because in moments of stillness,

148
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I found myself counting seconds again.

149
0:07:29.891,000 --> 0:07:34,000
But that day, I watched in wonder as the words streamed out of my pen,

150
0:07:34.924,000 --> 0:07:37,000
forming the most pivotal letter I've ever written,

151
0:07:38.009,000 --> 0:07:39,000
addressed to Tom.

152
0:07:40.115,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Along with an account of the violence that he subjected me to,

153
0:07:43.679,000 --> 0:07:46,000
the words, "I want to find forgiveness"

154
0:07:46.886,000 --> 0:07:47,000
stared back at me,

155
0:07:48.394,000 --> 0:07:5,000
surprising nobody more than myself.

156
0:07:51.4,000 --> 0:07:55,000
But deep down I realized that this was my way out of my suffering,

157
0:07:56.11,000 --> 0:08:,000
because regardless of whether or not he deserved my forgiveness,

158
0:08:00.171,000 --> 0:08:02,000
I deserved peace.

159
0:08:03.167,000 --> 0:08:06,000
My era of shame was over.

160
0:08:07.992,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Before sending the letter,

161
0:08:09.515,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I prepared myself for all kinds of negative responses,

162
0:08:12.286,000 --> 0:08:15,000
or what I found likeliest: no response whatsoever.

163
0:08:17.036,000 --> 0:08:19,000
The only outcome that I didn't prepare myself for

164
0:08:19.807,000 --> 0:08:21,000
was the one that I then got --

165
0:08:22.06,000 --> 0:08:26,000
a typed confession from Tom, full of disarming regret.

166
0:08:27.438,000 --> 0:08:31,000
As it turns out, he, too, had been imprisoned by silence.

167
0:08:32.174,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And this marked the start of an eight-year-long correspondence

168
0:08:36.248,000 --> 0:08:38,000
that God knows was never easy,

169
0:08:38.696,000 --> 0:08:4,000
but always honest.

170
0:08:41.537,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I relieved myself of the burdens that I'd wrongfully shouldered,

171
0:08:45.148,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and he, in turn, wholeheartedly owned up to what he'd done.

172
0:08:49.235,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Our written exchanges became a platform

173
0:08:51.531,000 --> 0:08:53,000
to dissect the consequences of that night,

174
0:08:54.272,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and they were everything from gut-wrenching

175
0:08:56.491,000 --> 0:08:58,000
to healing beyond words.

176
0:08:59.433,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And yet, it didn't bring about closure for me.

177
0:09:04.178,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Perhaps because the email format didn't feel personal enough,

178
0:09:07.684,000 --> 0:09:08,000
perhaps because it's easy to be brave

179
0:09:09.619,000 --> 0:09:13,000
when you're hiding behind a computer screen on the other side of the planet.

180
0:09:13.751,000 --> 0:09:14,000
But we'd begun a dialogue

181
0:09:15.561,000 --> 0:09:18,000
that I felt was necessary to explore to its fullest.

182
0:09:19.892,000 --> 0:09:21,000
So, after eight years of writing,

183
0:09:21.981,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and nearly 16 years after that dire night,

184
0:09:25.711,000 --> 0:09:28,000
I mustered the courage to propose a wild idea:

185
0:09:29.566,000 --> 0:09:3,000
that we'd meet up in person

186
0:09:31.25,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and face our past once and for all.

187
0:09:36.991,000 --> 0:09:39,000
TS: Iceland and Australia are geographically like this.

188
0:09:41.07,000 --> 0:09:43,000
In the middle of the two is South Africa.

189
0:09:43.866,000 --> 0:09:45,000
We decided upon the city of Cape Town,

190
0:09:46.795,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and there we met for one week.

191
0:09:50.246,000 --> 0:09:53,000
The city itself proved to be a stunningly powerful environment

192
0:09:53.74,000 --> 0:09:55,000
to focus on reconciliation and forgiveness.

193
0:09:57.667,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Nowhere else has healing and rapprochement been tested

194
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
like it has in South Africa.

195
0:10:02.856,000 --> 0:10:05,000
As a nation, South Africa sought to sit within the truth of its past,

196
0:10:06.747,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and to listen to the details of its history.

197
0:10:10.639,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Knowing this only magnified the effect that Cape Town had on us.

198
0:10:15.826,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Over the course of this week,

199
0:10:17.312,000 --> 0:10:19,000
we literally spoke our life stories to each other,

200
0:10:20.226,000 --> 0:10:21,000
from start to finish.

201
0:10:23.125,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And this was about analyzing our own history.

202
0:10:27.388,000 --> 0:10:29,000
We followed a strict policy of being honest,

203
0:10:30.245,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and this also came with a certain exposure,

204
0:10:33.194,000 --> 0:10:34,000
an open-chested vulnerability.

205
0:10:36.132,000 --> 0:10:38,000
There were gutting confessions,

206
0:10:38.283,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and moments where we just absolutely couldn't fathom

207
0:10:41.131,000 --> 0:10:42,000
the other person's experience.

208
0:10:44.078,000 --> 0:10:48,000
The seismic effects of sexual violence were spoken aloud and felt,

209
0:10:48.996,000 --> 0:10:49,000
face to face.

210
0:10:51.799,000 --> 0:10:52,000
At other times, though,

211
0:10:53.326,000 --> 0:10:55,000
we found a soaring clarity,

212
0:10:56.984,000 --> 0:11:,000
and even some totally unexpected but liberating laughter.

213
0:11:03.07,000 --> 0:11:04,000
When it came down to it,

214
0:11:04.624,000 --> 0:11:07,000
we did out best to listen to each other intently.

215
0:11:09.224,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And our individual realities were aired with an unfiltered purity

216
0:11:15.089,000 --> 0:11:17,000
that couldn't do any less than lighten the soul.

217
0:11:20.328,000 --> 0:11:24,000
TE: Wanting to take revenge is a very human emotion --

218
0:11:24.397,000 --> 0:11:25,000
instinctual, even.

219
0:11:26.649,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And all I wanted to do for years

220
0:11:28.684,000 --> 0:11:31,000
was to hurt Tom back as deeply as he had hurt me.

221
0:11:33.478,000 --> 0:11:36,000
But had I not found a way out of the hatred and anger,

222
0:11:36.555,000 --> 0:11:38,000
I'm not sure I'd be standing here today.

223
0:11:39.878,000 --> 0:11:42,000
That isn't to say that I didn't have my doubts along the way.

224
0:11:44.509,000 --> 0:11:47,000
When the plane bounced on that landing strip in Cape Town,

225
0:11:48.194,000 --> 0:11:49,000
I remember thinking,

226
0:11:49.821,000 --> 0:11:53,000
"Why did I not just get myself a therapist and a bottle of vodka

227
0:11:54.051,000 --> 0:11:56,000
like a normal person would do?"

228
0:11:56.291,000 --> 0:11:58,000
(Laughter)

229
0:11:59.235,000 --> 0:12:02,000
At times, our search for understanding in Cape Town

230
0:12:02.464,000 --> 0:12:04,000
felt like an impossible quest,

231
0:12:04.655,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and all I wanted to do was to give up

232
0:12:06.778,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and go home to my loving husband, Vidir,

233
0:12:09.018,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and our son.

234
0:12:11.814,000 --> 0:12:13,000
But despite our difficulties,

235
0:12:14.201,000 --> 0:12:18,000
this journey did result in a victorious feeling

236
0:12:18.853,000 --> 0:12:21,000
that light had triumphed over darkness,

237
0:12:22.632,000 --> 0:12:26,000
that something constructive could be built out of the ruins.

238
0:12:28.392,000 --> 0:12:29,000
I read somewhere

239
0:12:29.741,000 --> 0:12:32,000
that you should try and be the person that you needed when you were younger.

240
0:12:33.626,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And back when I was a teenager,

241
0:12:35.234,000 --> 0:12:38,000
I would have needed to know that the shame wasn't mine,

242
0:12:39.106,000 --> 0:12:41,000
that there's hope after rape,

243
0:12:41.644,000 --> 0:12:42,000
that you can even find happiness,

244
0:12:43.263,000 --> 0:12:44,000
like I share with my husband today.

245
0:12:45.681,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Which is why I started writing feverishly upon my return from Cape Town,

246
0:12:50.06,000 --> 0:12:52,000
resulting in a book co-authored by Tom,

247
0:12:52.808,000 --> 0:12:55,000
that we hope can be of use to people from both ends

248
0:12:56.017,000 --> 0:12:58,000
of the perpetrator-survivor scale.

249
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:,000
If nothing else,

250
0:13:00.478,000 --> 0:13:04,000
it's a story that we would've needed to hear when we were younger.

251
0:13:06.546,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Given the nature of our story,

252
0:13:08.391,000 --> 0:13:1,000
I know the words that inevitably accompany it --

253
0:13:11.753,000 --> 0:13:13,000
victim, rapist --

254
0:13:14.333,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and labels are a way to organize concepts,

255
0:13:16.612,000 --> 0:13:2,000
but they can also be dehumanizing in their connotations.

256
0:13:21.658,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Once someone's been deemed a victim,

257
0:13:23.782,000 --> 0:13:28,000
it's that much easier to file them away as someone damaged,

258
0:13:29.039,000 --> 0:13:3,000
dishonored,

259
0:13:30.569,000 --> 0:13:31,000
less than.

260
0:13:32.463,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And likewise, once someone has been branded a rapist,

261
0:13:35.207,000 --> 0:13:37,000
it's that much easier to call him a monster --

262
0:13:38.396,000 --> 0:13:39,000
inhuman.

263
0:13:40.434,000 --> 0:13:43,000
But how will we understand what it is in human societies

264
0:13:43.489,000 --> 0:13:44,000
that produces violence

265
0:13:45.094,000 --> 0:13:49,000
if we refuse to recognize the humanity of those who commit it?

266
0:13:50.354,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And how --

267
0:13:51.542,000 --> 0:13:53,000
(Applause)

268
0:13:53.745,000 --> 0:13:58,000
And how can we empower survivors if we're making them feel less than?

269
0:13:59.892,000 --> 0:14:02,000
How can we discuss solutions to one of the biggest threats

270
0:14:03.343,000 --> 0:14:06,000
to the lives of women and children around the world,

271
0:14:06.641,000 --> 0:14:09,000
if the very words we use are part of the problem?

272
0:14:13.606,000 --> 0:14:15,000
TS: From what I've now learnt,

273
0:14:16.122,000 --> 0:14:2,000
my actions that night in 1996 were a self-centered taking.

274
0:14:21.848,000 --> 0:14:23,000
I felt deserving of Thordis's body.

275
0:14:25.563,000 --> 0:14:27,000
I've had primarily positive social influences

276
0:14:28.452,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and examples of equitable behavior around me.

277
0:14:31.65,000 --> 0:14:32,000
But on that occasion,

278
0:14:32.871,000 --> 0:14:34,000
I chose to draw upon the negative ones.

279
0:14:35.536,000 --> 0:14:37,000
The ones that see women as having less intrinsic worth,

280
0:14:39.507,000 --> 0:14:43,000
and of men having some unspoken and symbolic claim to their bodies.

281
0:14:45.601,000 --> 0:14:48,000
These influences I speak of are external to me, though.

282
0:14:49.402,000 --> 0:14:51,000
And it was only me in that room making choices,

283
0:14:52.207,000 --> 0:14:53,000
nobody else.

284
0:14:54.789,000 --> 0:14:55,000
When you own something

285
0:14:56.598,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and really square up to your culpability,

286
0:15:00.079,000 --> 0:15:02,000
I do think a surprising thing can happen.

287
0:15:03.069,000 --> 0:15:05,000
It's what I call a paradox of ownership.

288
0:15:06.809,000 --> 0:15:08,000
I thought I'd buckle under the weight of responsibility.

289
0:15:10.197,000 --> 0:15:12,000
I thought my certificate of humanity would be burnt.

290
0:15:14.296,000 --> 0:15:17,000
Instead, I was offered to really own what I did,

291
0:15:18.968,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and found that it didn't possess the entirety of who I am.

292
0:15:23.28,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Put simply,

293
0:15:24.665,000 --> 0:15:28,000
something you've done doesn't have to constitute the sum of who you are.

294
0:15:30.479,000 --> 0:15:31,000
The noise in my head abated.

295
0:15:32.771,000 --> 0:15:36,000
The indulgent self-pity was starved of oxygen,

296
0:15:36.823,000 --> 0:15:4,000
and it was replaced with the clean air of acceptance --

297
0:15:42.478,000 --> 0:15:46,000
an acceptance that I did hurt this wonderful person standing next to me;

298
0:15:46.786,000 --> 0:15:51,000
an acceptance that I am part of a large and shockingly everyday grouping of men

299
0:15:52.409,000 --> 0:15:54,000
who have been sexually violent toward their partners.

300
0:15:56.751,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Don't underestimate the power of words.

301
0:16:00.192,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Saying to Thordis that I raped her changed my accord with myself,

302
0:16:04.857,000 --> 0:16:05,000
as well as with her.

303
0:16:07.337,000 --> 0:16:08,000
But most importantly,

304
0:16:08.833,000 --> 0:16:11,000
the blame transferred from Thordis to me.

305
0:16:13.151,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Far too often,

306
0:16:14.326,000 --> 0:16:18,000
the responsibility is attributed to female survivors of sexual violence,

307
0:16:18.934,000 --> 0:16:2,000
and not to the males who enact it.

308
0:16:22.556,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Far too often,

309
0:16:23.73,000 --> 0:16:28,000
the denial and running leaves all parties at a great distance from the truth.

310
0:16:30.804,000 --> 0:16:32,000
There's definitely a public conversation happening now,

311
0:16:34.191,000 --> 0:16:36,000
and like a lot of people,

312
0:16:36.394,000 --> 0:16:38,000
we're heartened that there's less retreating

313
0:16:39.008,000 --> 0:16:41,000
from this difficult but important discussion.

314
0:16:42.848,000 --> 0:16:45,000
I feel a real responsibility to add our voices to it.

315
0:16:49.892,000 --> 0:16:53,000
TE: What we did is not a formula that we're prescribing for others.

316
0:16:55.002,000 --> 0:17:,000
Nobody has the right to tell anyone else how to handle their deepest pain

317
0:17:00.559,000 --> 0:17:01,000
or their greatest error.

318
0:17:03.156,000 --> 0:17:05,000
Breaking your silence is never easy,

319
0:17:05.531,000 --> 0:17:07,000
and depending on where you are in the world,

320
0:17:07.769,000 --> 0:17:1,000
it can even be deadly to speak out about rape.

321
0:17:11.908,000 --> 0:17:15,000
I realize that even the most traumatic event of my life

322
0:17:15.998,000 --> 0:17:17,000
is still a testament to my privilege,

323
0:17:18.781,000 --> 0:17:21,000
because I can talk about it without getting ostracized,

324
0:17:22.035,000 --> 0:17:23,000
or even killed.

325
0:17:24.113,000 --> 0:17:26,000
But with that privilege of having a voice

326
0:17:27.066,000 --> 0:17:29,000
comes the responsibility of using it.

327
0:17:30.553,000 --> 0:17:34,000
That's the least I owe my fellow survivors who can't.

328
0:17:36.661,000 --> 0:17:39,000
The story we've just relayed is unique,

329
0:17:39.751,000 --> 0:17:43,000
and yet it is so common with sexual violence being a global pandemic.

330
0:17:44.441,000 --> 0:17:46,000
But it doesn't have to be that way.

331
0:17:47.561,000 --> 0:17:5,000
One of the things that I found useful on my own healing journey

332
0:17:50.601,000 --> 0:17:52,000
is educating myself about sexual violence.

333
0:17:53.273,000 --> 0:17:55,000
And as a result, I've been reading, writing

334
0:17:55.711,000 --> 0:17:57,000
and speaking about this issue for over a decade now,

335
0:17:58.388,000 --> 0:18:,000
going to conferences around the world.

336
0:18:00.964,000 --> 0:18:01,000
And in my experience,

337
0:18:02.967,000 --> 0:18:06,000
the attendees of such events are almost exclusively women.

338
0:18:08.833,000 --> 0:18:14,000
But it's about time that we stop treating sexual violence as a women's issue.

339
0:18:15.473,000 --> 0:18:2,000
(Applause)

340
0:18:28.889,000 --> 0:18:32,000
A majority of sexual violence against women and men

341
0:18:32.957,000 --> 0:18:33,000
is perpetrated by men.

342
0:18:34.864,000 --> 0:18:38,000
And yet their voices are sorely underrepresented in this discussion.

343
0:18:40.662,000 --> 0:18:43,000
But all of us are needed here.

344
0:18:45.564,000 --> 0:18:48,000
Just imagine all the suffering we could alleviate

345
0:18:49.473,000 --> 0:18:52,000
if we dared to face this issue together.

346
0:18:54.7,000 --> 0:18:55,000
Thank you.

347
0:18:55.882,000 --> 0:18:59,000
(Applause)

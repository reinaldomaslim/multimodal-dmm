1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
My name is Joseph, a Member of Parliament in Kenya.

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Picture a Maasai village,

3
0:00:23.329,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and one evening,

4
0:00:24.909,000 --> 0:00:26,000
government soldiers come, surround the village

5
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and ask each elder to bring one boy to school.

6
0:00:29.545,000 --> 0:00:3,000
That's how I went to school --

7
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
pretty much a government guy pointing a gun

8
0:00:33.354,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and told my father, "You have to make a choice."

9
0:00:35.617,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I walked very comfortably to this missionary school,

10
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that was run by an American missionary.

11
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
The first thing the American missionary gave me was a candy.

12
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I had never in my life ever tasted candy.

13
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So I said to myself, with all these hundred other boys,

14
0:00:47.974,000 --> 0:00:48,000
this is where I belong.

15
0:00:49.36,000 --> 0:00:5,000
(Laughter) I stayed.

16
0:00:51.186,000 --> 0:00:53,000
When everybody else was dropping out.

17
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
My family moved; we're nomads.

18
0:00:55.075,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It was a boarding school, I was seven --

19
0:00:57.052,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Every time it closed you had to travel to find them.

20
0:00:59.765,000 --> 0:01:,000
40-50 miles, it doesn't matter.

21
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
You slept in the bush, but you kept going.

22
0:01:03.849,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And I stayed. I don't know why, but I did.

23
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
All of a sudden I passed the national examination,

24
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
found myself in a very beautiful high school in Kenya.

25
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And I finished high school.

26
0:01:15.238,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And just walking, I found a man

27
0:01:17.08,000 --> 0:01:19,000
who gave me a full scholarship to the United States.

28
0:01:19.947,000 --> 0:01:21,000
My mother still lived in a cow-dung hut,

29
0:01:21.989,000 --> 0:01:23,000
none of my brothers were going to school,

30
0:01:24.036,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and this man told me, "Here, go."

31
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I got a scholarship

32
0:01:27.389,000 --> 0:01:29,000
to St. Lawrence University, Upstate New York;

33
0:01:30.053,000 --> 0:01:31,000
finished that.

34
0:01:31.655,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And after that I went to Harvard Graduate School;

35
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
finished that.

36
0:01:37.004,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Then I worked in DC a little bit:

37
0:01:38.751,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I wrote a book for National Geographic and taught U.S. history.

38
0:01:41.837,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And every time, I kept going back home,

39
0:01:44.487,000 --> 0:01:45,000
listening to their problems --

40
0:01:45.98,000 --> 0:01:47,000
sick people, people with no water, all this stuff --

41
0:01:48.55,000 --> 0:01:49,000
every time I go back to America,

42
0:01:50.494,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I kept thinking about them.

43
0:01:51.97,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Then one day, an elder gave me a story that went like this:

44
0:01:55.695,000 --> 0:01:58,000
long time ago, there was a big war between tribes.

45
0:01:59.854,000 --> 0:02:02,000
This specific tribe was really afraid of this other Luhya tribe.

46
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Every time, they sent scouts to make sure no one attacked them.

47
0:02:06.894,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So one day, the scouts came running and told the villagers,

48
0:02:09.882,000 --> 0:02:12,000
"The enemies are coming. Only half an hour away, they'll be here."

49
0:02:13.083,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So people scrambled, took their things and ready to go, move out.

50
0:02:16.909,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But there were two men:

51
0:02:18.66,000 --> 0:02:2,000
one man was blind, one man had no legs

52
0:02:21.152,000 --> 0:02:22,000
-- he was born like that.

53
0:02:22.481,000 --> 0:02:25,000
The leader of the chiefs said, "No, sorry. We can't take you. You'll slow us down.

54
0:02:26.402,000 --> 0:02:29,000
We have to flee our women and children, we have to run."

55
0:02:30.648,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And they were left behind, waiting to die.

56
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
But these two people worked something out.

57
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
The blind man said, "Look, I'm a very strong man but I can't see."

58
0:02:39.497,000 --> 0:02:42,000
The man with no legs says, "I can see as far as the end of the world,

59
0:02:42.807,000 --> 0:02:46,000
but I can't save myself from a cat, or whatever animals."

60
0:02:47.925,000 --> 0:02:5,000
The blind man went down on his knees like this,

61
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and told the man with no legs to go over his back, and stood up.

62
0:02:54.71,000 --> 0:02:56,000
The man on top can see, the blind man can walk.

63
0:02:58.121,000 --> 0:03:,000
These guys took off, followed the footsteps of the villagers

64
0:03:01.002,000 --> 0:03:03,000
until they found and passed them.

65
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So, this was told to me in a setup of elders.

66
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And it's a really poor area.

67
0:03:11.049,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I represent Northern Kenya:

68
0:03:12.529,000 --> 0:03:14,000
the most nomadic, remote areas you can even find.

69
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And that man told me, "So, here you are.

70
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
You've got a good education from America, you have a good life in America;

71
0:03:22.298,000 --> 0:03:23,000
what are you going to do for us?

72
0:03:25.417,000 --> 0:03:27,000
We want you to be our eyes, we'll give you the legs.

73
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
We'll walk you, you lead us."

74
0:03:30.742,000 --> 0:03:32,000
The opportunity came. I was always thinking about that:

75
0:03:33.376,000 --> 0:03:34,000
"What can I do to help my people?

76
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Every time you go to an area where for 43 years of independence,

77
0:03:38.701,000 --> 0:03:4,000
we still don't have basic health facilities.

78
0:03:41.267,000 --> 0:03:44,000
A man has to be transported in a wheelbarrow 30 km for a hospital.

79
0:03:44.418,000 --> 0:03:45,000
No clean drinking water.

80
0:03:46.03,000 --> 0:03:48,000
So I said, "I'm going to dedicate myself.

81
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I'm leaving America.

82
0:03:49.901,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I'm going to run for office."

83
0:03:51.734,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Last June, I moved from America,

84
0:03:55.559,000 --> 0:03:57,000
ran in July election and won.

85
0:03:58.933,000 --> 0:04:,000
And I came for them,

86
0:04:02.457,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and that's my goal.

87
0:04:03.608,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Right now I have in place, for the last nine months,

88
0:04:07.155,000 --> 0:04:09,000
a plan that in five years,

89
0:04:10.37,000 --> 0:04:12,000
every nomad will have clean drinking water.

90
0:04:13.774,000 --> 0:04:15,000
We're building dispensaries across that constituency.

91
0:04:17.82,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I'm asking my friends from America to help

92
0:04:20.074,000 --> 0:04:22,000
with bringing nurses or doctors to help us out.

93
0:04:22.621,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I'm trying to improve infrastructure.

94
0:04:25.266,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I'm using the knowledge I received from the United States

95
0:04:28.006,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and from my community

96
0:04:29.658,000 --> 0:04:3,000
to move them forward.

97
0:04:31.083,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I'm trying to develop homegrown solutions to our issues

98
0:04:34.565,000 --> 0:04:36,000
because people from outside can come and help us,

99
0:04:37.155,000 --> 0:04:39,000
but if we don't help ourselves, there's nothing to do.

100
0:04:40.258,000 --> 0:04:41,000
My plan right now

101
0:04:41.37,000 --> 0:04:44,000
as I continue with introducing students to different fields --

102
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
some become doctors, some lawyers --

103
0:04:47.204,000 --> 0:04:49,000
we want to produce a comprehensive group of people,

104
0:04:49.624,000 --> 0:04:51,000
students who can come back and help us see a community grow

105
0:04:52.504,000 --> 0:04:55,000
that is in the middle of a huge economic recession.

106
0:04:56.147,000 --> 0:04:58,000
As I continue to be a Member of Parliament

107
0:04:58.964,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and as I continue listening to all of you talking about botany,

108
0:05:02.354,000 --> 0:05:04,000
health, democracy, new inventions,

109
0:05:05.809,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I'm hoping that one day in my own little community --

110
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
which is 26,000 square km,

111
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
maybe five times Rhode Island --

112
0:05:12.491,000 --> 0:05:13,000
with no roads,

113
0:05:13.98,000 --> 0:05:16,000
we'll be able to become a model to help others develop.

114
0:05:17.933,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Thank you very much.

115
0:05:19.318,000 --> 0:05:2,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.817,000 --> 0:00:14,000
When I was only three or four,

2
0:00:15.285,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I fell in love with poetry,

3
0:00:17.777,000 --> 0:00:2,000
with the rhythms and the music of language;

4
0:00:20.912,000 --> 0:00:23,000
with the power of metaphor and of imagery,

5
0:00:24.579,000 --> 0:00:26,000
poetry being the essence of communication --

6
0:00:27.365,000 --> 0:00:29,000
the discipline, the distillation.

7
0:00:30.999,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And all these years later, the poems I'll read today

8
0:00:33.985,000 --> 0:00:36,000
are from my just-finished seventh book of poetry.

9
0:00:38.199,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Well, five years ago, I was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.

10
0:00:42.874,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Though there's no cure yet,

11
0:00:44.818,000 --> 0:00:46,000
advances in treatment are really impressive.

12
0:00:47.985,000 --> 0:00:49,000
But you can imagine that I was appalled to learn

13
0:00:50.999,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that women are largely left out of research trials,

14
0:00:55.517,000 --> 0:00:58,000
despite gender-specific medical findings having demonstrated

15
0:00:59.062,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that we are not actually just small men --

16
0:01:01.746,000 --> 0:01:03,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:03.866,000 --> 0:01:06,000
who happen to have different reproductive systems.

18
0:01:07.142,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Gender-specific medicine is good for men, too.

19
0:01:10.325,000 --> 0:01:14,000
But you bring to a crisis the person you already are,

20
0:01:15.102,000 --> 0:01:18,000
including the, yes, momentum that you've learned to invoke

21
0:01:18.999,000 --> 0:01:21,000
through passionate caring and through action,

22
0:01:22.332,000 --> 0:01:26,000
both of which require but also create energy.

23
0:01:27.47,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So as an activist, I began working with the Parkinson's Disease Foundation --

24
0:01:31.78,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that's pdf.org --

25
0:01:33.985,000 --> 0:01:39,000
to create a major initiative to put women on the Parkinson's disease map.

26
0:01:41.819,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And as a poet, I began working with this subject matter,

27
0:01:45.068,000 --> 0:01:49,000
finding it tragic, hilarious, sometimes even joyful.

28
0:01:50.136,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I do not feel diminished by Parkinson's;

29
0:01:52.747,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I feel distilled by it,

30
0:01:55.396,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and I actually very much like the woman I'm distilling into.

31
0:02:01.528,000 --> 0:02:02,000
"No Signs of Struggle"

32
0:02:04.569,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Growing small requires enormity of will:

33
0:02:08.643,000 --> 0:02:1,000
just sitting still in the doctor's waiting room

34
0:02:11.255,000 --> 0:02:14,000
watching the future shuffle in and out,

35
0:02:14.865,000 --> 0:02:16,000
watching it stoop; stare at you

36
0:02:17.632,000 --> 0:02:18,000
while you try not to look.

37
0:02:20.213,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Rare is an exchange:

38
0:02:21.88,000 --> 0:02:24,000
a smile of brief, wry recognition.

39
0:02:25.917,000 --> 0:02:26,000
You are the new kid on the block.

40
0:02:28.192,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Everyone here was you once.

41
0:02:30.791,000 --> 0:02:34,000
You are still learning that growing small requires a largeness of spirit

42
0:02:35.022,000 --> 0:02:37,000
you can't fit into yet:

43
0:02:37.505,000 --> 0:02:4,000
acceptance of irritating help from those who love you;

44
0:02:41.478,000 --> 0:02:44,000
giving way and over, but not up.

45
0:02:45.494,000 --> 0:02:48,000
You've swallowed hard the contents of the "Drink Me" bottle,

46
0:02:48.746,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and felt yourself shrink.

47
0:02:51.576,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Now, familiar furniture looms,

48
0:02:54.343,000 --> 0:02:58,000
floors tilt, and doorknobs yield only when wrestled round with both hands.

49
0:02:59.685,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It demands colossal patience, all this growing small:

50
0:03:04.579,000 --> 0:03:05,000
your diminished sleep at night,

51
0:03:06.499,000 --> 0:03:09,000
your handwriting, your voice, your height.

52
0:03:10.668,000 --> 0:03:13,000
You are more the incredible shrinking woman

53
0:03:13.917,000 --> 0:03:16,000
than the Buddhist mystic, serene, making do with less.

54
0:03:17.864,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Less is not always more.

55
0:03:21.56,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Yet in this emptying space, space glimmers,

56
0:03:26.164,000 --> 0:03:27,000
becoming visible.

57
0:03:28.115,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Here is a place behind the eyes of those accustomed

58
0:03:31.498,000 --> 0:03:34,000
by what some would call diminishment.

59
0:03:35.468,000 --> 0:03:38,000
It is a place of merciless poetry,

60
0:03:39.167,000 --> 0:03:42,000
a gift of presence previously ignored,

61
0:03:42.51,000 --> 0:03:44,000
drowned in the daily clutter.

62
0:03:45.357,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Here every gesture needs intention,

63
0:03:48.462,000 --> 0:03:5,000
is alive with consciousness.

64
0:03:50.886,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Nothing is automatic.

65
0:03:53.192,000 --> 0:03:56,000
You can spot it in the provocation of a button,

66
0:03:56.685,000 --> 0:03:58,000
an arm poking at a sleeve,

67
0:03:58.922,000 --> 0:04:02,000
a balancing act at a night-time curb while negotiating the dark.

68
0:04:04.133,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Feats of such modest valor,

69
0:04:07.191,000 --> 0:04:12,000
who would suspect them to be exercises in an intimate, fierce discipline,

70
0:04:12.519,000 --> 0:04:15,000
a metaphysics of being relentlessly aware?

71
0:04:16.667,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Such understated power here,

72
0:04:19.476,000 --> 0:04:23,000
in these tottering dancers who exert stupendous effort

73
0:04:23.788,000 --> 0:04:26,000
on tasks most view as insignificant.

74
0:04:27.572,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Such quiet beauty here, in these,

75
0:04:30.937,000 --> 0:04:34,000
my soft-voiced, stiff-limbed people;

76
0:04:35.234,000 --> 0:04:38,000
such resolve masked by each placid face.

77
0:04:39.937,000 --> 0:04:43,000
There is immensity required in growing small,

78
0:04:44.554,000 --> 0:04:47,000
so bent on such unbending grace.

79
0:04:48.02,000 --> 0:04:54,000
(Applause)

80
0:04:54.343,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Thank you.

81
0:04:55.945,000 --> 0:04:58,000
This one is called "On Donating My Brain to Science."

82
0:04:59.152,000 --> 0:05:,000
(Laughter)

83
0:05:01.058,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Not a problem.

84
0:05:03.349,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Skip over all the pages reassuring religious people.

85
0:05:07.28,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Already a universal donor: kidneys, corneas, liver, lungs,

86
0:05:11.06,000 --> 0:05:13,000
tissue, heart, veins, whatever.

87
0:05:14.097,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Odd that the modest brain never imagined its unique value in research,

88
0:05:19.599,000 --> 0:05:23,000
maybe saving someone else from what it is they're not quite sure I have.

89
0:05:23.937,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Flattering, that.

90
0:05:25.673,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So fill in the forms,

91
0:05:27.842,000 --> 0:05:28,000
drill through the answers,

92
0:05:29.725,000 --> 0:05:3,000
trill out a blithe spirit.

93
0:05:32.021,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And slice me, dice me, spread me on your slides.

94
0:05:36.703,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Find what I'm trying to tell you.

95
0:05:38.994,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Earn me, learn me, scan me, squint through your lens.

96
0:05:44.015,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Uncover what I'd hint at if I could.

97
0:05:46.718,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Be my guest, do your best, harvest me, track the clues.

98
0:05:51.206,000 --> 0:05:53,000
This was a good brain while alive.

99
0:05:53.704,000 --> 0:05:55,000
This was a brain that paid its dues.

100
0:05:56.084,000 --> 0:06:,000
So slice me, dice me, smear me on your slides,

101
0:06:00.999,000 --> 0:06:03,000
stain me, explain me, drain me like a cup.

102
0:06:04.544,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Share me, hear me:

103
0:06:06.644,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I want to be used I want to be used

104
0:06:09.268,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I want to be used up.

105
0:06:12.395,000 --> 0:06:14,000
(Applause)

106
0:06:19.435,000 --> 0:06:2,000
(Applause ends)

107
0:06:21.669,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And this one's called "The Ghost Light."

108
0:06:26.229,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Lit from within is the sole secure way

109
0:06:29.803,000 --> 0:06:3,000
to traverse dark matter.

110
0:06:32.424,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Some life forms -- certain mushrooms, snails, jellyfish, worms --

111
0:06:37.445,000 --> 0:06:39,000
glow bioluminescent,

112
0:06:39.741,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and people as well;

113
0:06:41.534,000 --> 0:06:45,000
we emit infra-red light from our most lucent selves.

114
0:06:46.676,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Our tragedy is we can't see it.

115
0:06:50.406,000 --> 0:06:51,000
We see by reflecting.

116
0:06:52.972,000 --> 0:06:55,000
We need biofluorescence to show our true colors.

117
0:06:57.4,000 --> 0:07:,000
External illumination can distort, though.

118
0:07:00.527,000 --> 0:07:02,000
When gravity bends light,

119
0:07:02.553,000 --> 0:07:05,000
huge galaxy clusters can act as telescopes,

120
0:07:06.186,000 --> 0:07:11,000
elongating background images of star systems to faint arcs --

121
0:07:11.387,000 --> 0:07:12,000
a lensing effect

122
0:07:12.565,000 --> 0:07:15,000
like viewing distant street lamps through a glass of wine.

123
0:07:17.535,000 --> 0:07:19,000
A glass of wine or two now makes me weave

124
0:07:20.266,000 --> 0:07:22,000
as if acting the drunkard's part;

125
0:07:23.152,000 --> 0:07:26,000
as if, besotted with unrequited love

126
0:07:26.522,000 --> 0:07:3,000
for the dynamic Turner canvasses spied out by the Hubble,

127
0:07:30.631,000 --> 0:07:32,000
I could lurch down a city street set

128
0:07:32.936,000 --> 0:07:35,000
without provoking every pedestrian walk-on stare.

129
0:07:37.924,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Stare as long as you need to.

130
0:07:40.442,000 --> 0:07:45,000
If you think about it, walking, even standing, is illogical --

131
0:07:45.865,000 --> 0:07:46,000
such tiny things, feet! --

132
0:07:47.865,000 --> 0:07:48,000
(Laughter)

133
0:07:49.806,000 --> 0:07:52,000
especially when one's body is not al dente anymore.

134
0:07:53.741,000 --> 0:07:56,000
(Laughter)

135
0:07:57.729,000 --> 0:08:,000
Besides, creature of extremes and excess,

136
0:08:00.875,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I've always thought Apollo beautiful but boring,

137
0:08:03.935,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and a bit of a dumb blonde.

138
0:08:06.771,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Dionysians don't do balance.

139
0:08:10.923,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Balance, in other words, has never been my strong point.

140
0:08:15.104,000 --> 0:08:16,000
But I digress.

141
0:08:16.296,000 --> 0:08:17,000
More and more these days,

142
0:08:17.535,000 --> 0:08:19,000
digression seems the most direct route through

143
0:08:20.557,000 --> 0:08:22,000
from where I've lost or found myself

144
0:08:22.658,000 --> 0:08:25,000
out of place, mind, turn, time.

145
0:08:27.222,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Place your foot just so, mind how you turn:

146
0:08:31.582,000 --> 0:08:33,000
too swift a swivel can bring you down.

147
0:08:35.206,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Take your time ushering the audience out,

148
0:08:38.158,000 --> 0:08:4,000
saying goodbye to the actors.

149
0:08:41.048,000 --> 0:08:42,000
The ghost light

150
0:08:42.223,000 --> 0:08:43,000
is what they call the single bulb

151
0:08:44.033,000 --> 0:08:47,000
hanging above the bare stage in an empty theater.

152
0:08:48.655,000 --> 0:08:5,000
In the empty theater of such a night,

153
0:08:50.992,000 --> 0:08:53,000
waking to meet no external radiance,

154
0:08:54.834,000 --> 0:08:57,000
this is the final struggle left to win,

155
0:08:58.05,000 --> 0:09:01,000
this the sole beacon to beckon the darkness in

156
0:09:01.309,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and let the rest begin,

157
0:09:03.978,000 --> 0:09:07,000
this the lens through which at last to see both Self and Other

158
0:09:08.955,000 --> 0:09:12,000
arrayed with the bright stain of original sin:

159
0:09:13.599,000 --> 0:09:14,000
lit from within.

160
0:09:16.87,000 --> 0:09:22,000
(Applause)

161
0:09:24.725,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And this is the last one.

162
0:09:26.639,000 --> 0:09:27,000
"This Dark Hour"

163
0:09:29.513,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Late summer, 4 A.M.

164
0:09:32.674,000 --> 0:09:34,000
The rain slows to a stop,

165
0:09:35.044,000 --> 0:09:37,000
dripping still from the broad leaves

166
0:09:37.316,000 --> 0:09:4,000
of blue hostas unseen in the garden's dark.

167
0:09:41.259,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Barefoot, careful on the slick slate slabs,

168
0:09:44.977,000 --> 0:09:47,000
I need no light, I know the way,

169
0:09:48.284,000 --> 0:09:49,000
stoop by the mint bed,

170
0:09:50.187,000 --> 0:09:52,000
scoop a fistful of moist earth,

171
0:09:53.016,000 --> 0:09:54,000
then grope for a chair,

172
0:09:54.748,000 --> 0:09:56,000
spread a shawl, and sit,

173
0:09:57.426,000 --> 0:10:,000
breathing in the wet green August air.

174
0:10:02.24,000 --> 0:10:04,000
This is the small, still hour

175
0:10:05.254,000 --> 0:10:08,000
before the newspaper lands in the vestibule like a grenade,

176
0:10:09.092,000 --> 0:10:13,000
the phone shrills, the computer screen blinks and glares awake.

177
0:10:14.643,000 --> 0:10:16,000
There is this hour:

178
0:10:16.847,000 --> 0:10:19,000
poem in my head, soil in my hand:

179
0:10:20.847,000 --> 0:10:21,000
unnamable fullness.

180
0:10:23.662,000 --> 0:10:25,000
This hour, when blood of my blood

181
0:10:26.269,000 --> 0:10:3,000
bone of bone, child grown to manhood now --

182
0:10:30.325,000 --> 0:10:35,000
stranger, intimate, not distant but apart --

183
0:10:35.813,000 --> 0:10:38,000
lies safe, off dreaming melodies

184
0:10:39.571,000 --> 0:10:42,000
while love sleeps, safe, in his arms.

185
0:10:43.735,000 --> 0:10:45,000
To have come to this place,

186
0:10:46.364,000 --> 0:10:48,000
lived to this moment:

187
0:10:48.479,000 --> 0:10:5,000
immeasurable lightness.

188
0:10:51.392,000 --> 0:10:53,000
The density of black starts to blur umber.

189
0:10:54.789,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Tentative, a cardinal's coloratura,

190
0:10:57.791,000 --> 0:10:59,000
then the mourning dove's elegy.

191
0:11:00.39,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Sable glimmers toward grey;

192
0:11:02.804,000 --> 0:11:05,000
objects emerge, trailing shadows;

193
0:11:05.996,000 --> 0:11:06,000
night ages toward day.

194
0:11:08.54,000 --> 0:11:09,000
The city stirs.

195
0:11:10.958,000 --> 0:11:13,000
There will be other dawns, nights, gaudy noons.

196
0:11:15.46,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Likely, I'll lose my way.

197
0:11:17.86,000 --> 0:11:19,000
There will be stumbling, falling,

198
0:11:20.296,000 --> 0:11:21,000
cursing the dark.

199
0:11:22.49,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Whatever comes,

200
0:11:24.134,000 --> 0:11:27,000
there was this hour when nothing mattered,

201
0:11:28.105,000 --> 0:11:3,000
all was unbearably dear.

202
0:11:31.89,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And when I'm done with daylights,

203
0:11:34.14,000 --> 0:11:38,000
should those who loved me grieve too long a while,

204
0:11:39.125,000 --> 0:11:42,000
let them remember that I had this hour --

205
0:11:42.378,000 --> 0:11:45,000
this dark, perfect hour --

206
0:11:46.01,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and smile.

207
0:11:48.418,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Thank you.

208
0:11:49.596,000 --> 0:11:55,000
(Applause)

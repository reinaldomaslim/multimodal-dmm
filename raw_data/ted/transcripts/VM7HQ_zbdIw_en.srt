1
0:00:20.624,000 --> 0:00:26,000
In the 1980s, in communist Eastern Germany,

2
0:00:27.349,000 --> 0:00:3,000
if you owned a typewriter,

3
0:00:30.547,000 --> 0:00:32,000
you had to register it with the government.

4
0:00:33.372,000 --> 0:00:38,000
You had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter.

5
0:00:38.86,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And this was done so the government could track

6
0:00:42.435,000 --> 0:00:43,000
where the text was coming from.

7
0:00:44.204,000 --> 0:00:49,000
If they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought,

8
0:00:49.923,000 --> 0:00:52,000
they could track down who created that thought.

9
0:00:54.369,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And we in the West

10
0:00:57.154,000 --> 0:00:59,000
couldn't understand how anybody would do this,

11
0:00:59.86,000 --> 0:01:02,000
how much this would restrict freedom of speech.

12
0:01:03.061,000 --> 0:01:06,000
We would never do that in our own countries.

13
0:01:08.319,000 --> 0:01:14,000
But today, in 2011, if you go and buy a color laser printer

14
0:01:14.76,000 --> 0:01:17,000
from any major laser printer manufacturer

15
0:01:18.623,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and print a page,

16
0:01:20.084,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that page will end up

17
0:01:21.86,000 --> 0:01:26,000
having slight yellow dots printed on every single page,

18
0:01:27.104,000 --> 0:01:32,000
in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer.

19
0:01:34.381,000 --> 0:01:37,000
This is happening to us today.

20
0:01:39.358,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And nobody seems to be making a fuss about it.

21
0:01:43.615,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And this is an example

22
0:01:46.303,000 --> 0:01:52,000
of the ways our own governments are using technology

23
0:01:53.179,000 --> 0:01:55,000
against us, the citizens.

24
0:01:57.179,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And this is one of the main three sources of online problems today.

25
0:02:01.537,000 --> 0:02:03,000
If we look at what's really happening in the online world,

26
0:02:04.551,000 --> 0:02:06,000
we can group the attacks based on the attackers.

27
0:02:08.028,000 --> 0:02:09,000
We have three main groups.

28
0:02:09.86,000 --> 0:02:1,000
We have online criminals.

29
0:02:11.323,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Like here, we have Mr. Dmitry Golubov,

30
0:02:13.55,000 --> 0:02:14,000
from the city of Kiev in Ukraine.

31
0:02:16.419,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand.

32
0:02:20.86,000 --> 0:02:21,000
These guys make money.

33
0:02:22.478,000 --> 0:02:26,000
They use online attacks to make lots of money --

34
0:02:26.756,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and lots and lots of it.

35
0:02:28.757,000 --> 0:02:33,000
We actually have several cases of millionaires online, multimillionaires,

36
0:02:34.166,000 --> 0:02:35,000
who made money with their attacks.

37
0:02:35.95,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Here's Vladimir Tsastsin, from Tartu in Estonia.

38
0:02:39.476,000 --> 0:02:4,000
This is [Albert] Gonzalez.

39
0:02:41.295,000 --> 0:02:42,000
This is Stephen Watt.

40
0:02:43.094,000 --> 0:02:44,000
This is Bjorn Sundin.

41
0:02:44.916,000 --> 0:02:45,000
This is Matthew Anderson, Tariq Al-Daour

42
0:02:46.881,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and so on and so on.

43
0:02:50.256,000 --> 0:02:54,000
These guys make their fortunes online,

44
0:02:54.499,000 --> 0:02:56,000
but they make it through the illegal means

45
0:02:56.86,000 --> 0:02:58,000
of using things like banking Trojans

46
0:02:59.579,000 --> 0:03:02,000
to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking,

47
0:03:03.056,000 --> 0:03:05,000
or with keyloggers

48
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
to collect our credit card information

49
0:03:07.612,000 --> 0:03:1,000
while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer.

50
0:03:11.197,000 --> 0:03:13,000
The US Secret Service,

51
0:03:13.575,000 --> 0:03:16,000
two months ago, froze the Swiss bank account

52
0:03:16.621,000 --> 0:03:18,000
of Mr. Sam Jain right here,

53
0:03:19.226,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and that bank account had 14.9 million US dollars in it

54
0:03:22.962,000 --> 0:03:23,000
when it was frozen.

55
0:03:24.377,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Mr. Jain himself is on the loose; nobody knows where he is.

56
0:03:28.637,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And I claim it's already today

57
0:03:32.335,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that it's more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online

58
0:03:38.081,000 --> 0:03:4,000
than here in the real world.

59
0:03:41.691,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And it's very obvious that this is only going to get worse.

60
0:03:44.66,000 --> 0:03:48,000
In the future, the majority of crime will be happening online.

61
0:03:51.488,000 --> 0:03:54,000
The second major group of attackers that we are watching today

62
0:03:54.86,000 --> 0:03:56,000
are not motivated by money.

63
0:03:57.143,000 --> 0:03:59,000
They're motivated by something else --

64
0:03:59.27,000 --> 0:04:,000
motivated by protests,

65
0:04:01.271,000 --> 0:04:03,000
motivated by an opinion,

66
0:04:03.507,000 --> 0:04:05,000
motivated by the laughs.

67
0:04:05.702,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Groups like Anonymous have risen up over the last 12 months

68
0:04:11.251,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and have become a major player in the field of online attacks.

69
0:04:16.287,000 --> 0:04:17,000
So those are the three main attackers:

70
0:04:18.143,000 --> 0:04:2,000
criminals who do it for the money,

71
0:04:20.222,000 --> 0:04:24,000
hacktivists like Anonymous doing it for the protest,

72
0:04:24.745,000 --> 0:04:27,000
but then the last group are nation states --

73
0:04:27.971,000 --> 0:04:29,000
governments doing the attacks.

74
0:04:32.551,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And then we look at cases like what happened in DigiNotar.

75
0:04:36.068,000 --> 0:04:39,000
This is a prime example of what happens when governments attack

76
0:04:39.978,000 --> 0:04:4,000
against their own citizens.

77
0:04:42.412,000 --> 0:04:46,000
DigiNotar is a certificate authority from the Netherlands --

78
0:04:47.423,000 --> 0:04:48,000
or actually, it was.

79
0:04:49.023,000 --> 0:04:54,000
It was running into bankruptcy last fall,

80
0:04:54.269,000 --> 0:04:55,000
because they were hacked into.

81
0:04:56.061,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly.

82
0:05:00.591,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And I asked last week,

83
0:05:03.19,000 --> 0:05:07,000
in a meeting with Dutch government representatives,

84
0:05:07.337,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I asked one of the leaders of the team

85
0:05:12.15,000 --> 0:05:17,000
whether he found plausible that people died

86
0:05:17.504,000 --> 0:05:18,000
because of the DigiNotar hack.

87
0:05:21.447,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And his answer was: yes.

88
0:05:26.073,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So how do people die

89
0:05:28.136,000 --> 0:05:29,000
as the result of a hack like this?

90
0:05:31.049,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Well, DigiNotar is a CA.

91
0:05:32.86,000 --> 0:05:33,000
They sell certificates.

92
0:05:34.86,000 --> 0:05:35,000
What do you do with certificates?

93
0:05:36.49,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Well, you need a certificate if you have a website

94
0:05:39.056,000 --> 0:05:42,000
that has https, SSL encrypted services,

95
0:05:43.725,000 --> 0:05:45,000
services like Gmail.

96
0:05:47.363,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Now we all, or a big part of us, use Gmail or one of their competitors,

97
0:05:51.048,000 --> 0:05:56,000
but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like Iran,

98
0:05:56.86,000 --> 0:06:,000
where dissidents use foreign services like Gmail

99
0:06:01.86,000 --> 0:06:04,000
because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services

100
0:06:05.075,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and they are encrypted over SSL connections,

101
0:06:07.86,000 --> 0:06:1,000
so the local government can't snoop on their discussions.

102
0:06:12.196,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Except they can,

103
0:06:13.564,000 --> 0:06:16,000
if they hack into a foreign CA and issue rogue certificates.

104
0:06:17.439,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And this is exactly what happened with the case of DigiNotar.

105
0:06:25.109,000 --> 0:06:26,000
What about Arab Spring

106
0:06:27.125,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and things that have been happening, for example, in Egypt?

107
0:06:30.46,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Well, in Egypt,

108
0:06:31.827,000 --> 0:06:34,000
the rioters looted the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police

109
0:06:35.558,000 --> 0:06:37,000
in April 2011,

110
0:06:38.172,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and when they were looting the building, they found lots of papers.

111
0:06:41.34,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Among those papers was this binder entitled, "FinFisher."

112
0:06:45.221,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And within that binder were notes from a company based in Germany,

113
0:06:50.081,000 --> 0:06:53,000
which had sold to the Egyptian government

114
0:06:53.627,000 --> 0:06:57,000
a set of tools for intercepting, at a very large scale,

115
0:06:58.354,000 --> 0:07:01,000
all the communication of the citizens of the country.

116
0:07:01.429,000 --> 0:07:05,000
They had sold this tool for 280,000 euros to the Egyptian government.

117
0:07:06.329,000 --> 0:07:08,000
The company headquarters are right here.

118
0:07:09.273,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So Western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools

119
0:07:13.714,000 --> 0:07:15,000
to do this against their own citizens.

120
0:07:17.293,000 --> 0:07:19,000
But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well.

121
0:07:20.294,000 --> 0:07:22,000
For example, in Germany,

122
0:07:22.489,000 --> 0:07:26,000
just a couple of weeks ago, the so-called "State Trojan" was found,

123
0:07:27.076,000 --> 0:07:3,000
which was a Trojan used by German government officials

124
0:07:30.852,000 --> 0:07:32,000
to investigate their own citizens.

125
0:07:33.079,000 --> 0:07:36,000
If you are a suspect in a criminal case,

126
0:07:36.807,000 --> 0:07:38,000
well, it's pretty obvious, your phone will be tapped.

127
0:07:39.356,000 --> 0:07:41,000
But today, it goes beyond that.

128
0:07:41.622,000 --> 0:07:42,000
They will tap your Internet connection.

129
0:07:43.565,000 --> 0:07:45,000
They will even use tools like State Trojan

130
0:07:46.325,000 --> 0:07:48,000
to infect your computer with a Trojan,

131
0:07:48.861,000 --> 0:07:52,000
which enables them to watch all your communication,

132
0:07:53.251,000 --> 0:07:55,000
to listen to your online discussions,

133
0:07:56.092,000 --> 0:07:58,000
to collect your passwords.

134
0:08:01.816,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Now, when we think deeper about things like these,

135
0:08:07.06,000 --> 0:08:12,000
the obvious response from people should be,

136
0:08:12.398,000 --> 0:08:16,000
"OK, well, that sounds bad, but that doesn't really affect me,

137
0:08:16.664,000 --> 0:08:18,000
because I'm a legal citizen.

138
0:08:18.864,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Why should I worry? Because I have nothing to hide."

139
0:08:23.373,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And this is an argument which doesn't make sense.

140
0:08:27.237,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Privacy is implied.

141
0:08:30.07,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Privacy is not up for discussion.

142
0:08:34.538,000 --> 0:08:35,000
This is not a question

143
0:08:36.434,000 --> 0:08:4,000
between privacy

144
0:08:41.007,000 --> 0:08:42,000
against security.

145
0:08:43.729,000 --> 0:08:46,000
It's a question of freedom

146
0:08:47.308,000 --> 0:08:48,000
against control.

147
0:08:50.046,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And while we might trust our governments right now, right here in 2011,

148
0:08:56.933,000 --> 0:08:59,000
any rights we give away will be given away for good.

149
0:09:00.396,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And do we trust, do we blindly trust, any future government,

150
0:09:05.001,000 --> 0:09:08,000
a government we might have 50 years from now?

151
0:09:11.46,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And these are the questions

152
0:09:14.27,000 --> 0:09:17,000
that we have to worry about for the next 50 years.

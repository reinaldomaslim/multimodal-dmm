2
0:00:15.57,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Let's begin with a story.

3
0:00:19.586,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Once upon a time --

4
0:00:21.537,000 --> 0:00:24,000
well actually less than two years ago --

5
0:00:24.603,000 --> 0:00:27,000
in a kingdom not so very far away,

6
0:00:27.636,000 --> 0:00:28,000
there was a man

7
0:00:29.387,000 --> 0:00:3,000
who traveled many miles

8
0:00:31.254,000 --> 0:00:34,000
to come to work at the jewel in the kingdom's crown --

9
0:00:34.836,000 --> 0:00:36,000
an internationally famous company.

10
0:00:37.42,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Let's call it Island Networks.

11
0:00:40.538,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Now this kingdom had many resources

12
0:00:43.386,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and mighty ambitions,

13
0:00:45.603,000 --> 0:00:47,000
but the one thing it lacked was people.

14
0:00:48.17,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And so it invited workers from around the world

15
0:00:51.603,000 --> 0:00:53,000
to come and help it build the nation.

16
0:00:54.253,000 --> 0:00:56,000
But in order to enter and to stay

17
0:00:57.22,000 --> 0:01:,000
these migrants had to pass a few tests.

18
0:01:00.755,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And so it was, our man presented himself

19
0:01:03.238,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to authorities in the kingdom,

20
0:01:05.007,000 --> 0:01:08,000
looking forward to settling into his new life.

21
0:01:08.205,000 --> 0:01:11,000
But then something unexpected happened.

22
0:01:11.455,000 --> 0:01:14,000
The medical personnel who took blood samples from the man

23
0:01:15.055,000 --> 0:01:18,000
never actually told him what they were testing for.

24
0:01:18.738,000 --> 0:01:22,000
He wasn't offered counseling before or after the test,

25
0:01:23.007,000 --> 0:01:25,000
which is best medical practice.

26
0:01:25.338,000 --> 0:01:28,000
He was never informed of the results of the test.

27
0:01:28.339,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And yet, a couple of weeks later,

28
0:01:30.455,000 --> 0:01:33,000
he was picked up and taken to prison

29
0:01:33.489,000 --> 0:01:35,000
where he was subjected to a medical exam,

30
0:01:36.023,000 --> 0:01:38,000
including a full-body search

31
0:01:38.774,000 --> 0:01:41,000
in full view of the others in the cell.

32
0:01:42.372,000 --> 0:01:45,000
He was released, but then a day or two later,

33
0:01:46.139,000 --> 0:01:5,000
he was taken to the airport and he was deported.

34
0:01:51.108,000 --> 0:01:54,000
What on earth did this man do

35
0:01:54.373,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to merit this treatment?

36
0:01:56.523,000 --> 0:01:58,000
What was his terrible crime?

37
0:01:59.125,000 --> 0:02:02,000
He was infected with HIV.

38
0:02:02.773,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Now the kingdom is one of about 50 countries

39
0:02:05.904,000 --> 0:02:09,000
that imposes restrictions on the entry or stay

40
0:02:10.176,000 --> 0:02:12,000
of people living with HIV.

41
0:02:12.776,000 --> 0:02:13,000
The kingdom argues

42
0:02:14.377,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that its laws allow it to detain or deport foreigners

43
0:02:19.577,000 --> 0:02:21,000
who pose a risk to the economy

44
0:02:22.276,000 --> 0:02:25,000
or the security or the public health

45
0:02:25.776,000 --> 0:02:27,000
or the morals of the state.

46
0:02:27.893,000 --> 0:02:3,000
But these laws, when applied to people living with HIV,

47
0:02:31.726,000 --> 0:02:34,000
are a violation of international human rights agreements

48
0:02:35.108,000 --> 0:02:38,000
to which these countries are signatories.

49
0:02:38.328,000 --> 0:02:39,000
But you know what?

50
0:02:39.576,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Matters of principle aside,

51
0:02:41.059,000 --> 0:02:45,000
practically speaking, these laws drive HIV underground.

52
0:02:46.044,000 --> 0:02:48,000
People are less likely to come forth

53
0:02:48.642,000 --> 0:02:52,000
to be tested or treated or to disclose their condition,

54
0:02:52.676,000 --> 0:02:54,000
none of which helps these individuals

55
0:02:55.508,000 --> 0:02:59,000
or the communities these laws purport to protect.

56
0:02:59.677,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Today we can prevent the transmission of HIV.

57
0:03:03.742,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And with treatment, it is a manageable condition.

58
0:03:07.161,000 --> 0:03:09,000
We are very far from the days

59
0:03:09.992,000 --> 0:03:12,000
when the only practical response to dread disease

60
0:03:13.178,000 --> 0:03:15,000
was to have banished the afflicted --

61
0:03:15.758,000 --> 0:03:17,000
like this, "The Exile of the Leper."

62
0:03:18.66,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So you tell me why, in our age of science,

63
0:03:21.877,000 --> 0:03:23,000
we still have laws and policies

64
0:03:24.443,000 --> 0:03:27,000
which come from an age of superstition.

65
0:03:27.726,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Time for a quick show of hands.

66
0:03:30.993,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Who here has been touched by HIV --

67
0:03:34.258,000 --> 0:03:37,000
either because you yourself have the virus

68
0:03:37.342,000 --> 0:03:4,000
or you have a family member or a friend or a colleague

69
0:03:40.827,000 --> 0:03:42,000
who is living with HIV?

70
0:03:42.86,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Hands up.

71
0:03:43.96,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Wow. Wow.

72
0:03:45.941,000 --> 0:03:47,000
That's a significant number of us.

73
0:03:48.86,000 --> 0:03:5,000
You know better than anyone

74
0:03:51.392,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that HIV brings out

75
0:03:53.659,000 --> 0:03:56,000
the best and the worst in humanity.

76
0:03:57.242,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And the laws reflect these attitudes.

77
0:03:59.962,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I'm not just talking about laws on the books,

78
0:04:02.642,000 --> 0:04:05,000
but laws as they are enforced on the streets

79
0:04:06.009,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and laws as they are decided in the courts.

80
0:04:08.942,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And I'm not just talking about laws

81
0:04:11.492,000 --> 0:04:13,000
as they relate to people living with HIV,

82
0:04:13.861,000 --> 0:04:16,000
but people who are at greatest risk of infection --

83
0:04:17.092,000 --> 0:04:2,000
people such as those who inject drugs or sex workers

84
0:04:20.86,000 --> 0:04:22,000
or men who have sex with men

85
0:04:23.009,000 --> 0:04:24,000
or transgendered persons

86
0:04:24.892,000 --> 0:04:26,000
or migrants or prisoners.

87
0:04:27.36,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And in many parts of the world that includes women and children

88
0:04:30.91,000 --> 0:04:32,000
who are especially vulnerable.

89
0:04:32.941,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Now there are laws in many parts of the world

90
0:04:35.743,000 --> 0:04:38,000
which reflect the best of human nature.

91
0:04:39.175,000 --> 0:04:42,000
These laws treat people touched by HIV

92
0:04:42.461,000 --> 0:04:44,000
with compassion and acceptance.

93
0:04:45.36,000 --> 0:04:48,000
These laws respect universal human rights

94
0:04:48.759,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and they are grounded in evidence.

95
0:04:51.443,000 --> 0:04:54,000
These laws ensure that people living with HIV

96
0:04:54.576,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and those at greatest risk

97
0:04:56.692,000 --> 0:04:59,000
are protected from violence and discrimination

98
0:05:00.276,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and that they get access to prevention and to treatment.

99
0:05:04.492,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Unfortunately, these good laws

100
0:05:07.288,000 --> 0:05:09,000
are counter-balanced by a mass

101
0:05:09.424,000 --> 0:05:12,000
of really bad law --

102
0:05:12.425,000 --> 0:05:16,000
law which is grounded in moral judgement

103
0:05:16.874,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and in fear and in misinformation,

104
0:05:19.727,000 --> 0:05:23,000
laws which specifically punish people living with HIV

105
0:05:23.826,000 --> 0:05:24,000
or those at greatest risk.

106
0:05:25.458,000 --> 0:05:27,000
These laws fly in the face of science,

107
0:05:28.225,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and they are grounded in prejudice

108
0:05:31.508,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and in ignorance and in a rewriting of tradition

109
0:05:35.326,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and a selective reading of religion.

110
0:05:38.608,000 --> 0:05:4,000
But you know what? You don't have to take my word for it.

111
0:05:41.225,000 --> 0:05:42,000
We're going to hear from two people

112
0:05:43.109,000 --> 0:05:45,000
who are on the sharp end of the law.

113
0:05:45.642,000 --> 0:05:47,000
The first is Nick Rhoades. He's an American.

114
0:05:47.843,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And he was convicted under the U.S. State of Iowa's law

115
0:05:51.841,000 --> 0:05:53,000
on HIV transmission and exposure --

116
0:05:54.726,000 --> 0:05:57,000
neither of which offense he actually committed.

117
0:05:58.178,000 --> 0:06:01,000
(Video) Nick Rhoades: If something is against the law

118
0:06:01.376,000 --> 0:06:02,000
then that is telling society

119
0:06:02.575,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that is unacceptable, that's bad behavior.

120
0:06:05.176,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And I think the severity of that punishment

121
0:06:07.746,000 --> 0:06:1,000
tells you how bad you are as a person.

122
0:06:11.435,000 --> 0:06:13,000
You're a class B felon,

123
0:06:13.925,000 --> 0:06:15,000
lifetime sex offender.

124
0:06:16.709,000 --> 0:06:2,000
You are a very, very, very bad person.

125
0:06:20.742,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And you did a very, very, very bad thing.

126
0:06:24.129,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And so that's just programmed into you.

127
0:06:26.684,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And you go through the correctional system

128
0:06:29.917,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and everyone's telling you the same thing.

129
0:06:31.718,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And you're just like, I'm a very bad person.

130
0:06:36.682,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Shereen El-Feki: It's not just a question

131
0:06:38.647,000 --> 0:06:41,000
of unfair or ineffective laws.

132
0:06:41.746,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Some countries have good laws,

133
0:06:43.847,000 --> 0:06:45,000
laws which could stem the tide of HIV.

134
0:06:46.497,000 --> 0:06:49,000
The problem is that these laws are flouted.

135
0:06:49.597,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Because stigma gives unofficial license

136
0:06:52.564,000 --> 0:06:54,000
to treat people living with HIV

137
0:06:54.881,000 --> 0:06:55,000
or those at greatest risk

138
0:06:56.197,000 --> 0:06:58,000
unlike other citizens.

139
0:06:58.531,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And this is exactly what happened

140
0:07:00.23,000 --> 0:07:03,000
to Helma and Dongo from Namibia.

141
0:07:03.444,000 --> 0:07:04,000
(Video) Hilma: I found out

142
0:07:05.171,000 --> 0:07:07,000
when I went to the hospital for a pregnancy check-up.

143
0:07:08.116,000 --> 0:07:11,000
The nurse announced that every pregnant woman

144
0:07:11.768,000 --> 0:07:13,000
must also be tested for HIV that day.

145
0:07:13.863,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I took the test and the result showed I was positive.

146
0:07:16.912,000 --> 0:07:18,000
That's the day I found out.

147
0:07:19.508,000 --> 0:07:21,000
The nurse said to me, "Why should you people bcome pregnant

148
0:07:22.12,000 --> 0:07:23,000
when you know you are HIV positive?

149
0:07:23.648,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Why are you pregnant when you are living positive?"

150
0:07:26.043,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I am sure now that is the reason they sterilized me.

151
0:07:29.032,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Because I am HIV positive.

152
0:07:34.164,000 --> 0:07:37,000
They didn't give the forms to me

153
0:07:37.21,000 --> 0:07:4,000
or explain what was in the form.

154
0:07:40.932,000 --> 0:07:42,000
The nurse just came with it

155
0:07:43.332,000 --> 0:07:45,000
already marked where I had to sign.

156
0:07:45.414,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And with the labor pain,

157
0:07:47.358,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I didn't have the strength to ask them to read it to me.

158
0:07:54.428,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I just signed.

159
0:07:56.972,000 --> 0:07:59,000
SE: Hilma and Nick and our man in the kingdom

160
0:08:00.11,000 --> 0:08:04,000
are among the 34 million people living with HIV

161
0:08:04.461,000 --> 0:08:06,000
according to recent estimates.

162
0:08:06.577,000 --> 0:08:07,000
They're the lucky ones

163
0:08:08.445,000 --> 0:08:09,000
because they're still alive.

164
0:08:10.129,000 --> 0:08:11,000
According to those same estimates,

165
0:08:11.994,000 --> 0:08:14,000
in 2010 1.8 million people died

166
0:08:15.978,000 --> 0:08:17,000
of AIDS related causes.

167
0:08:18.377,000 --> 0:08:21,000
These are terrible and tragic figures.

168
0:08:21.88,000 --> 0:08:25,000
But if we look a little more broadly into the statistics,

169
0:08:26.311,000 --> 0:08:29,000
we actually see some reason for hope.

170
0:08:29.512,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Looking globally, the number of new infections of HIV is declining.

171
0:08:34.912,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And looking globally as well,

172
0:08:37.363,000 --> 0:08:4,000
deaths are also starting to fall.

173
0:08:40.729,000 --> 0:08:42,000
There are many reasons for these positive developments,

174
0:08:42.762,000 --> 0:08:44,000
but one of the most remarkable

175
0:08:44.895,000 --> 0:08:47,000
is in the increase in the number of people around the world

176
0:08:48.062,000 --> 0:08:5,000
on anti-retroviral therapy,

177
0:08:50.245,000 --> 0:08:54,000
the medicines they need to keep their HIV in check.

178
0:08:54.378,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Now there are still many problems.

179
0:08:56.411,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Only about half of the people who need treatment

180
0:08:59.761,000 --> 0:09:01,000
are currently receiving it.

181
0:09:01.994,000 --> 0:09:02,000
In some parts of the world --

182
0:09:03.846,000 --> 0:09:05,000
like here in the Middle East and North Africa --

183
0:09:06.195,000 --> 0:09:09,000
new infections are rising and so are deaths.

184
0:09:09.578,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And the money, the money we need

185
0:09:12.729,000 --> 0:09:13,000
for the global response to HIV,

186
0:09:14.662,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that is shrinking.

187
0:09:17.658,000 --> 0:09:19,000
But for the first time

188
0:09:19.947,000 --> 0:09:22,000
in three decades into this epidemic

189
0:09:23.165,000 --> 0:09:27,000
we have a real chance to come to grips with HIV.

190
0:09:27.282,000 --> 0:09:28,000
But in order to do that

191
0:09:29.248,000 --> 0:09:32,000
we need to tackle an epidemic of really bad law.

192
0:09:33.147,000 --> 0:09:34,000
It's for this reason

193
0:09:34.765,000 --> 0:09:36,000
that the Global Commission on HIV and the Law,

194
0:09:36.895,000 --> 0:09:37,000
of which I'm a member,

195
0:09:38.194,000 --> 0:09:41,000
was established by the agencies of the United Nations --

196
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
to look at the ways that legal environments

197
0:09:43.91,000 --> 0:09:45,000
are affecting people living with HIV

198
0:09:45.927,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and those at greatest risk,

199
0:09:48.061,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and to recommend what should be done

200
0:09:49.811,000 --> 0:09:52,000
to make the law an ally, not an enemy,

201
0:09:53.047,000 --> 0:09:55,000
of the global response to HIV.

202
0:09:55.779,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Let me give you just one example

203
0:09:58.128,000 --> 0:10:,000
of the way a legal environment

204
0:10:00.778,000 --> 0:10:02,000
can make a positive difference.

205
0:10:03.344,000 --> 0:10:05,000
People who inject drugs

206
0:10:06.159,000 --> 0:10:07,000
are one of those groups I mentioned.

207
0:10:07.974,000 --> 0:10:09,000
They're at high risk of HIV

208
0:10:10.095,000 --> 0:10:11,000
through contaminated injection equipment

209
0:10:11.96,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and other risk-related behaviors.

210
0:10:14.642,000 --> 0:10:17,000
In fact, one in every 10 new infections of HIV

211
0:10:18.324,000 --> 0:10:2,000
is among people who inject drugs.

212
0:10:21.058,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Now drug use or possession

213
0:10:23.659,000 --> 0:10:25,000
is illegal in almost every country.

214
0:10:25.808,000 --> 0:10:29,000
But some countries take a harder line on this than others.

215
0:10:30.058,000 --> 0:10:32,000
In Thailand people who use drugs,

216
0:10:32.742,000 --> 0:10:34,000
or are merely suspected of using drugs,

217
0:10:35.593,000 --> 0:10:36,000
are placed in detention centers,

218
0:10:37.459,000 --> 0:10:38,000
like the one you see here,

219
0:10:39.376,000 --> 0:10:41,000
where they are supposed to clean up.

220
0:10:41.459,000 --> 0:10:43,000
There is absolutely no evidence

221
0:10:44.391,000 --> 0:10:46,000
to show that throwing people into detention

222
0:10:47.242,000 --> 0:10:49,000
cures their drug dependence.

223
0:10:49.575,000 --> 0:10:51,000
There is, however, ample evidence

224
0:10:51.742,000 --> 0:10:53,000
to show that incarcerating people

225
0:10:53.742,000 --> 0:10:58,000
increases their risk of HIV and other infections.

226
0:10:58.96,000 --> 0:11:03,000
We know how to reduce HIV transmission and other risks

227
0:11:04.61,000 --> 0:11:05,000
in people who inject drugs.

228
0:11:06.375,000 --> 0:11:08,000
It's called harm reduction,

229
0:11:08.506,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and it involves, among other things,

230
0:11:10.29,000 --> 0:11:13,000
providing clean needles and syringes,

231
0:11:13.421,000 --> 0:11:15,000
offering opioid substitution therapy

232
0:11:16.256,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and other evidence-based treatments

233
0:11:18.522,000 --> 0:11:2,000
to reduce drug dependence.

234
0:11:20.772,000 --> 0:11:22,000
It involves providing information

235
0:11:23.289,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and education and condoms

236
0:11:25.307,000 --> 0:11:28,000
to reduce HIV transmission,

237
0:11:28.438,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and also providing HIV testing

238
0:11:30.955,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and counseling and treatment

239
0:11:32.788,000 --> 0:11:33,000
should people become infected.

240
0:11:34.606,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Where the legal environment allows for harm reduction

241
0:11:38.139,000 --> 0:11:4,000
the results are striking.

242
0:11:40.393,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Australia and Switzerland

243
0:11:42.223,000 --> 0:11:44,000
were two countries which introduced harm reduction

244
0:11:44.824,000 --> 0:11:46,000
very early on in their HIV epidemics,

245
0:11:47.524,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and they have a very low rate of HIV

246
0:11:50.543,000 --> 0:11:52,000
among injecting drug users.

247
0:11:52.706,000 --> 0:11:54,000
The U.S. and Malaysia

248
0:11:55.057,000 --> 0:11:57,000
came to harm reduction a little later,

249
0:11:57.607,000 --> 0:12:,000
and they have higher rates of HIV in these populations.

250
0:12:01.574,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Thailand and Russia, however,

251
0:12:03.257,000 --> 0:12:04,000
have resisted harm reduction

252
0:12:05.159,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and have stringent laws

253
0:12:06.891,000 --> 0:12:07,000
which punish drug use.

254
0:12:08.457,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And hey, surprise,

255
0:12:09.957,000 --> 0:12:14,000
very high rates of HIV among people who are injecting drugs.

256
0:12:15.324,000 --> 0:12:17,000
At the Global Commission we have studied the evidence,

257
0:12:18.19,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and we've heard the experiences

258
0:12:19.941,000 --> 0:12:23,000
of over 700 people from 140 countries.

259
0:12:24.274,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And the trend? Well the trend is clear.

260
0:12:26.532,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Where you criminalize people living with HIV

261
0:12:29.857,000 --> 0:12:3,000
or those at greatest risk,

262
0:12:31.223,000 --> 0:12:33,000
you fuel the epidemic.

263
0:12:33.972,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Now coming up with a vaccine for HIV

264
0:12:38.241,000 --> 0:12:39,000
or a cure for AIDS --

265
0:12:39.442,000 --> 0:12:41,000
now that's rocket science.

266
0:12:41.94,000 --> 0:12:42,000
But changing the law isn't.

267
0:12:43.723,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And in fact, a number of countries are starting to make progress

268
0:12:46.436,000 --> 0:12:47,000
on a number of points.

269
0:12:48.019,000 --> 0:12:52,000
To begin, countries need to review their legislation

270
0:12:52.057,000 --> 0:12:55,000
as it touches HIV and vulnerable groups.

271
0:12:55.589,000 --> 0:12:57,000
On the back of those reviews,

272
0:12:57.706,000 --> 0:12:58,000
governments should repeal laws

273
0:12:59.672,000 --> 0:13:02,000
that punish or discriminate against people living with HIV

274
0:13:02.84,000 --> 0:13:04,000
or those at greatest risk.

275
0:13:05.057,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Repealing a law isn't easy,

276
0:13:07.573,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and it's particularly difficult

277
0:13:09.357,000 --> 0:13:13,000
when it relates to touchy subjects like drugs and sex.

278
0:13:13.64,000 --> 0:13:16,000
But there's plenty you can do while that process is underway.

279
0:13:17.207,000 --> 0:13:21,000
One of the key points is to reform the police

280
0:13:21.506,000 --> 0:13:23,000
so that they have better practices on the ground.

281
0:13:24.323,000 --> 0:13:25,000
So for example, outreach workers

282
0:13:26.078,000 --> 0:13:29,000
who are distributing condoms to vulnerable populations

283
0:13:29.078,000 --> 0:13:32,000
are not themselves subject to police harassment

284
0:13:32.194,000 --> 0:13:34,000
or abuse or arbitrary arrest.

285
0:13:35.144,000 --> 0:13:36,000
We can also train judges

286
0:13:36.645,000 --> 0:13:39,000
so that they find flexibilities in the law

287
0:13:39.812,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and so that they rule on the side of tolerance

288
0:13:42.962,000 --> 0:13:43,000
rather than prejudice.

289
0:13:44.861,000 --> 0:13:45,000
We can retool prisons

290
0:13:46.379,000 --> 0:13:49,000
so that HIV prevention and harm reduction

291
0:13:49.744,000 --> 0:13:51,000
is available to prisoners.

292
0:13:51.964,000 --> 0:13:55,000
The key to all this is reinforcing civil society.

293
0:13:56.479,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Because civil society is key

294
0:13:58.162,000 --> 0:14:,000
to raising awareness among vulnerable groups

295
0:14:01.028,000 --> 0:14:02,000
of their legal rights.

296
0:14:02.812,000 --> 0:14:03,000
But awareness needs action.

297
0:14:04.429,000 --> 0:14:05,000
And so we need to ensure

298
0:14:05.895,000 --> 0:14:07,000
that these people who are living with HIV

299
0:14:08.228,000 --> 0:14:09,000
or at greatest risk of HIV

300
0:14:09.895,000 --> 0:14:11,000
have access to legal services

301
0:14:12.629,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and they have equal access to the courts.

302
0:14:15.545,000 --> 0:14:17,000
And also important is talking to communities

303
0:14:18.246,000 --> 0:14:2,000
so that we change interpretations

304
0:14:20.395,000 --> 0:14:22,000
of religious or customary law,

305
0:14:22.895,000 --> 0:14:23,000
which is too often used

306
0:14:24.713,000 --> 0:14:27,000
to justify punishment and fuel stigma.

307
0:14:28.196,000 --> 0:14:29,000
For many of us here

308
0:14:29.444,000 --> 0:14:32,000
HIV is not an abstract threat.

309
0:14:32.963,000 --> 0:14:34,000
It hits very close to home.

310
0:14:35.462,000 --> 0:14:37,000
The law, on the other hand,

311
0:14:37.979,000 --> 0:14:41,000
can seem remote, arcane, the stuff of specialists,

312
0:14:42.412,000 --> 0:14:44,000
but it isn't.

313
0:14:44.494,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Because for those of us who live in democracies,

314
0:14:47.379,000 --> 0:14:49,000
or in aspiring democracies,

315
0:14:49.695,000 --> 0:14:52,000
the law begins with us.

316
0:14:52.712,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Laws that treat people living with HIV

317
0:14:55.645,000 --> 0:14:57,000
or those at greatest risk with respect

318
0:14:58.313,000 --> 0:15:02,000
start with the way that we treat them ourselves: as equals.

319
0:15:03.161,000 --> 0:15:07,000
If we are going to stop the spread of HIV in our lifetime,

320
0:15:07.795,000 --> 0:15:1,000
then that is the change we need to spread.

321
0:15:11.462,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Thank you.

322
0:15:12.861,000 --> 0:15:19,000
(Applause)

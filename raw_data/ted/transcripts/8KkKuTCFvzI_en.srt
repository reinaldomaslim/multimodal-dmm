1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:14,000
What keeps us healthy and happy

2
0:00:15.76,000 --> 0:00:16,000
as we go through life?

3
0:00:18.52,000 --> 0:00:2,000
If you were going to invest now

4
0:00:21.04,000 --> 0:00:23,000
in your future best self,

5
0:00:23.12,000 --> 0:00:25,000
where would you put your time and your energy?

6
0:00:27.12,000 --> 0:00:29,000
There was a recent survey of millennials

7
0:00:29.56,000 --> 0:00:34,000
asking them what their most important life goals were,

8
0:00:34.76,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and over 80 percent said

9
0:00:36.8,000 --> 0:00:4,000
that a major life goal for them was to get rich.

10
0:00:40.96,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And another 50 percent of those same young adults

11
0:00:45.32,000 --> 0:00:47,000
said that another major life goal

12
0:00:47.88,000 --> 0:00:48,000
was to become famous.

13
0:00:50.96,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:52.2,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And we're constantly told to lean in to work, to push harder

15
0:00:58.88,000 --> 0:01:,000
and achieve more.

16
0:01:00.96,000 --> 0:01:03,000
We're given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after

17
0:01:04.64,000 --> 0:01:05,000
in order to have a good life.

18
0:01:06.48,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Pictures of entire lives,

19
0:01:08.72,000 --> 0:01:13,000
of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them,

20
0:01:13.96,000 --> 0:01:15,000
those pictures are almost impossible to get.

21
0:01:18.08,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Most of what we know about human life

22
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
we know from asking people to remember the past,

23
0:01:24.64,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and as we know, hindsight is anything but 20/20.

24
0:01:29.44,000 --> 0:01:32,000
We forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life,

25
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and sometimes memory is downright creative.

26
0:01:36.8,000 --> 0:01:4,000
But what if we could watch entire lives

27
0:01:41.2,000 --> 0:01:43,000
as they unfold through time?

28
0:01:44.08,000 --> 0:01:47,000
What if we could study people from the time that they were teenagers

29
0:01:48.08,000 --> 0:01:5,000
all the way into old age

30
0:01:50.84,000 --> 0:01:53,000
to see what really keeps people happy and healthy?

31
0:01:55.56,000 --> 0:01:56,000
We did that.

32
0:01:57.64,000 --> 0:01:59,000
The Harvard Study of Adult Development

33
0:01:59.88,000 --> 0:02:03,000
may be the longest study of adult life that's ever been done.

34
0:02:05.72,000 --> 0:02:11,000
For 75 years, we've tracked the lives of 724 men,

35
0:02:13.36,000 --> 0:02:17,000
year after year, asking about their work, their home lives, their health,

36
0:02:17.88,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories

37
0:02:22.28,000 --> 0:02:23,000
were going to turn out.

38
0:02:25.28,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Studies like this are exceedingly rare.

39
0:02:28.92,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Almost all projects of this kind fall apart within a decade

40
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
because too many people drop out of the study,

41
0:02:36.2,000 --> 0:02:38,000
or funding for the research dries up,

42
0:02:39.12,000 --> 0:02:41,000
or the researchers get distracted,

43
0:02:41.4,000 --> 0:02:45,000
or they die, and nobody moves the ball further down the field.

44
0:02:46.28,000 --> 0:02:48,000
But through a combination of luck

45
0:02:48.56,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and the persistence of several generations of researchers,

46
0:02:52.28,000 --> 0:02:53,000
this study has survived.

47
0:02:54.52,000 --> 0:02:58,000
About 60 of our original 724 men

48
0:02:59.04,000 --> 0:03:,000
are still alive,

49
0:03:00.36,000 --> 0:03:02,000
still participating in the study,

50
0:03:02.56,000 --> 0:03:04,000
most of them in their 90s.

51
0:03:05.56,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And we are now beginning to study

52
0:03:07.48,000 --> 0:03:1,000
the more than 2,000 children of these men.

53
0:03:11.68,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And I'm the fourth director of the study.

54
0:03:15.4,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Since 1938, we've tracked the lives of two groups of men.

55
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
The first group started in the study

56
0:03:22.32,000 --> 0:03:24,000
when they were sophomores at Harvard College.

57
0:03:25.04,000 --> 0:03:27,000
They all finished college during World War II,

58
0:03:27.88,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and then most went off to serve in the war.

59
0:03:31.28,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And the second group that we've followed

60
0:03:33.44,000 --> 0:03:37,000
was a group of boys from Boston's poorest neighborhoods,

61
0:03:37.64,000 --> 0:03:39,000
boys who were chosen for the study

62
0:03:39.68,000 --> 0:03:42,000
specifically because they were from some of the most troubled

63
0:03:43.04,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and disadvantaged families

64
0:03:44.92,000 --> 0:03:46,000
in the Boston of the 1930s.

65
0:03:47.68,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Most lived in tenements, many without hot and cold running water.

66
0:03:54.52,000 --> 0:03:55,000
When they entered the study,

67
0:03:56.44,000 --> 0:03:58,000
all of these teenagers were interviewed.

68
0:03:59.4,000 --> 0:04:01,000
They were given medical exams.

69
0:04:01.64,000 --> 0:04:04,000
We went to their homes and we interviewed their parents.

70
0:04:05.2,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And then these teenagers grew up into adults

71
0:04:07.6,000 --> 0:04:09,000
who entered all walks of life.

72
0:04:10.04,000 --> 0:04:16,000
They became factory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and doctors,

73
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
one President of the United States.

74
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Some developed alcoholism. A few developed schizophrenia.

75
0:04:25.32,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Some climbed the social ladder

76
0:04:27.64,000 --> 0:04:3,000
from the bottom all the way to the very top,

77
0:04:30.88,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and some made that journey in the opposite direction.

78
0:04:35.52,000 --> 0:04:37,000
The founders of this study

79
0:04:38.48,000 --> 0:04:4,000
would never in their wildest dreams

80
0:04:40.52,000 --> 0:04:44,000
have imagined that I would be standing here today, 75 years later,

81
0:04:45.08,000 --> 0:04:48,000
telling you that the study still continues.

82
0:04:49.28,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Every two years, our patient and dedicated research staff

83
0:04:52.92,000 --> 0:04:55,000
calls up our men and asks them if we can send them

84
0:04:56,000 --> 0:04:59,000
yet one more set of questions about their lives.

85
0:05:00.04,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Many of the inner city Boston men ask us,

86
0:05:03.64,000 --> 0:05:06,000
"Why do you keep wanting to study me? My life just isn't that interesting."

87
0:05:08.6,000 --> 0:05:1,000
The Harvard men never ask that question.

88
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Laughter)

89
0:05:20.92,000 --> 0:05:22,000
To get the clearest picture of these lives,

90
0:05:23.8,000 --> 0:05:25,000
we don't just send them questionnaires.

91
0:05:26.76,000 --> 0:05:28,000
We interview them in their living rooms.

92
0:05:29.24,000 --> 0:05:31,000
We get their medical records from their doctors.

93
0:05:32.2,000 --> 0:05:34,000
We draw their blood, we scan their brains,

94
0:05:34.72,000 --> 0:05:35,000
we talk to their children.

95
0:05:36.44,000 --> 0:05:41,000
We videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns.

96
0:05:41.72,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And when, about a decade ago, we finally asked the wives

97
0:05:45.28,000 --> 0:05:47,000
if they would join us as members of the study,

98
0:05:47.68,000 --> 0:05:49,000
many of the women said, "You know, it's about time."

99
0:05:50.4,000 --> 0:05:51,000
(Laughter)

100
0:05:51.48,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So what have we learned?

101
0:05:53.2,000 --> 0:05:58,000
What are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages

102
0:05:58.44,000 --> 0:06:01,000
of information that we've generated

103
0:06:01.52,000 --> 0:06:02,000
on these lives?

104
0:06:03.72,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Well, the lessons aren't about wealth or fame or working harder and harder.

105
0:06:10.52,000 --> 0:06:16,000
The clearest message that we get from this 75-year study is this:

106
0:06:16.84,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Good relationships keep us happier and healthier. Period.

107
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:26,000
We've learned three big lessons about relationships.

108
0:06:26.84,000 --> 0:06:3,000
The first is that social connections are really good for us,

109
0:06:30.96,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and that loneliness kills.

110
0:06:33.48,000 --> 0:06:36,000
It turns out that people who are more socially connected

111
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
to family, to friends, to community,

112
0:06:40.28,000 --> 0:06:44,000
are happier, they're physically healthier, and they live longer

113
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:48,000
than people who are less well connected.

114
0:06:48.4,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic.

115
0:06:51.84,000 --> 0:06:56,000
People who are more isolated than they want to be from others

116
0:06:57,000 --> 0:07:,000
find that they are less happy,

117
0:07:00.24,000 --> 0:07:02,000
their health declines earlier in midlife,

118
0:07:03.2,000 --> 0:07:05,000
their brain functioning declines sooner

119
0:07:05.44,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely.

120
0:07:10.04,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And the sad fact is that at any given time,

121
0:07:13.28,000 --> 0:07:17,000
more than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely.

122
0:07:19.04,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd

123
0:07:21.72,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and you can be lonely in a marriage,

124
0:07:24.4,000 --> 0:07:26,000
so the second big lesson that we learned

125
0:07:26.56,000 --> 0:07:29,000
is that it's not just the number of friends you have,

126
0:07:29.68,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship,

127
0:07:33.2,000 --> 0:07:37,000
but it's the quality of your close relationships that matters.

128
0:07:38.56,000 --> 0:07:42,000
It turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health.

129
0:07:43.36,000 --> 0:07:46,000
High-conflict marriages, for example, without much affection,

130
0:07:47.36,000 --> 0:07:52,000
turn out to be very bad for our health, perhaps worse than getting divorced.

131
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And living in the midst of good, warm relationships is protective.

132
0:07:57.96,000 --> 0:08:,000
Once we had followed our men all the way into their 80s,

133
0:08:01.08,000 --> 0:08:04,000
we wanted to look back at them at midlife

134
0:08:04.12,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and to see if we could predict

135
0:08:05.72,000 --> 0:08:08,000
who was going to grow into a happy, healthy octogenarian

136
0:08:09.72,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and who wasn't.

137
0:08:11.68,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And when we gathered together everything we knew about them

138
0:08:15.92,000 --> 0:08:16,000
at age 50,

139
0:08:18.08,000 --> 0:08:2,000
it wasn't their middle age cholesterol levels

140
0:08:20.64,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that predicted how they were going to grow old.

141
0:08:23.56,000 --> 0:08:26,000
It was how satisfied they were in their relationships.

142
0:08:27.04,000 --> 0:08:31,000
The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50

143
0:08:31.96,000 --> 0:08:33,000
were the healthiest at age 80.

144
0:08:35.68,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And good, close relationships seem to buffer us

145
0:08:38.88,000 --> 0:08:4,000
from some of the slings and arrows of getting old.

146
0:08:42.48,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Our most happily partnered men and women

147
0:08:46.48,000 --> 0:08:48,000
reported, in their 80s,

148
0:08:48.559,000 --> 0:08:5,000
that on the days when they had more physical pain,

149
0:08:51.52,000 --> 0:08:52,000
their mood stayed just as happy.

150
0:08:54.4,000 --> 0:08:57,000
But the people who were in unhappy relationships,

151
0:08:57.68,000 --> 0:08:59,000
on the days when they reported more physical pain,

152
0:09:00.64,000 --> 0:09:03,000
it was magnified by more emotional pain.

153
0:09:04.36,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health

154
0:09:08.76,000 --> 0:09:11,000
is that good relationships don't just protect our bodies,

155
0:09:12.04,000 --> 0:09:13,000
they protect our brains.

156
0:09:14.44,000 --> 0:09:18,000
It turns out that being in a securely attached relationship

157
0:09:19.12,000 --> 0:09:22,000
to another person in your 80s is protective,

158
0:09:23.04,000 --> 0:09:24,000
that the people who are in relationships

159
0:09:25.04,000 --> 0:09:29,000
where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need,

160
0:09:29.2,000 --> 0:09:32,000
those people's memories stay sharper longer.

161
0:09:32.92,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And the people in relationships

162
0:09:34.44,000 --> 0:09:37,000
where they feel they really can't count on the other one,

163
0:09:37.6,000 --> 0:09:4,000
those are the people who experience earlier memory decline.

164
0:09:42.52,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And those good relationships, they don't have to be smooth all the time.

165
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other

166
0:09:49.6,000 --> 0:09:5,000
day in and day out,

167
0:09:51.36,000 --> 0:09:54,000
but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other

168
0:09:54.56,000 --> 0:09:55,000
when the going got tough,

169
0:09:56.4,000 --> 0:09:59,000
those arguments didn't take a toll on their memories.

170
0:10:01.6,000 --> 0:10:03,000
So this message,

171
0:10:04.36,000 --> 0:10:09,000
that good, close relationships are good for our health and well-being,

172
0:10:10.08,000 --> 0:10:12,000
this is wisdom that's as old as the hills.

173
0:10:13.04,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore?

174
0:10:17.56,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Well, we're human.

175
0:10:19.04,000 --> 0:10:21,000
What we'd really like is a quick fix,

176
0:10:21.88,000 --> 0:10:22,000
something we can get

177
0:10:23.6,000 --> 0:10:25,000
that'll make our lives good and keep them that way.

178
0:10:27.32,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Relationships are messy and they're complicated

179
0:10:30.68,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and the hard work of tending to family and friends,

180
0:10:34.52,000 --> 0:10:36,000
it's not sexy or glamorous.

181
0:10:37.2,000 --> 0:10:4,000
It's also lifelong. It never ends.

182
0:10:40.56,000 --> 0:10:45,000
The people in our 75-year study who were the happiest in retirement

183
0:10:45.64,000 --> 0:10:5,000
were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates.

184
0:10:51.48,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Just like the millennials in that recent survey,

185
0:10:54.48,000 --> 0:10:57,000
many of our men when they were starting out as young adults

186
0:10:58.12,000 --> 0:11:02,000
really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement

187
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
were what they needed to go after to have a good life.

188
0:11:06.12,000 --> 0:11:1,000
But over and over, over these 75 years, our study has shown

189
0:11:10.32,000 --> 0:11:15,000
that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships,

190
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
with family, with friends, with community.

191
0:11:21.08,000 --> 0:11:22,000
So what about you?

192
0:11:23.08,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Let's say you're 25, or you're 40, or you're 60.

193
0:11:27.8,000 --> 0:11:29,000
What might leaning in to relationships even look like?

194
0:11:31.76,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Well, the possibilities are practically endless.

195
0:11:35.6,000 --> 0:11:41,000
It might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time

196
0:11:41.72,000 --> 0:11:45,000
or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together,

197
0:11:46.2,000 --> 0:11:48,000
long walks or date nights,

198
0:11:49.36,000 --> 0:11:53,000
or reaching out to that family member who you haven't spoken to in years,

199
0:11:54.24,000 --> 0:11:57,000
because those all-too-common family feuds

200
0:11:57.76,000 --> 0:11:59,000
take a terrible toll

201
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:02,000
on the people who hold the grudges.

202
0:12:04,000 --> 0:12:07,000
I'd like to close with a quote from Mark Twain.

203
0:12:09.28,000 --> 0:12:11,000
More than a century ago,

204
0:12:11.68,000 --> 0:12:13,000
he was looking back on his life,

205
0:12:14.32,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and he wrote this:

206
0:12:16.84,000 --> 0:12:19,000
"There isn't time, so brief is life,

207
0:12:20.56,000 --> 0:12:25,000
for bickerings, apologies, heartburnings, callings to account.

208
0:12:26.72,000 --> 0:12:28,000
There is only time for loving,

209
0:12:29.56,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and but an instant, so to speak, for that."

210
0:12:34.76,000 --> 0:12:38,000
The good life is built with good relationships.

211
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Thank you.

212
0:12:40.4,000 --> 0:12:45,000
(Applause)

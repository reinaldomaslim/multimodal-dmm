1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Thank you.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'm thrilled to be here.

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I'm going to talk about a new, old material

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that still continues to amaze us,

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and that might impact the way we think

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
about material science, high technology --

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and maybe, along the way,

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
also do some stuff for medicine and for global health and help reforestation.

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
So that's kind of a bold statement.

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I'll tell you a little bit more.

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
This material actually has some traits that make it seem almost too good to be true.

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
It's sustainable; it's a sustainable material

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that is processed all in water and at room temperature --

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and is biodegradable with a clock,

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
so you can watch it dissolve instantaneously in a glass of water

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
or have it stable for years.

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
It's edible; it's implantable in the human body

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
without causing any immune response.

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It actually gets reintegrated in the body.

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
And it's technological,

21
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
so it can do things like microelectronics,

22
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and maybe photonics do.

23
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And the material

24
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
looks something like this.

25
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
In fact, this material you see is clear and transparent.

26
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
The components of this material are just water and protein.

27
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So this material is silk.

28
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So it's kind of different

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
from what we're used to thinking about silk.

30
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So the question is, how do you reinvent something

31
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that has been around for five millennia?

32
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
The process of discovery, generally, is inspired by nature.

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And so we marvel at silk worms --

34
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
the silk worm you see here spinning its fiber.

35
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
The silk worm does a remarkable thing:

36
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
it uses these two ingredients, protein and water,

37
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that are in its gland,

38
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
to make a material that is exceptionally tough for protection --

39
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
so comparable to technical fibers

40
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
like Kevlar.

41
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And so in the reverse engineering process

42
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that we know about,

43
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and that we're familiar with,

44
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
for the textile industry,

45
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
the textile industry goes and unwinds the cocoon

46
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and then weaves glamorous things.

47
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
We want to know how you go from water and protein

48
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
to this liquid Kevlar, to this natural Kevlar.

49
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So the insight

50
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
is how do you actually reverse engineer this

51
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and go from cocoon to gland

52
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and get water and protein that is your starting material.

53
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And this is an insight

54
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that came, about two decades ago,

55
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
from a person that I'm very fortunate to work with,

56
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
David Kaplan.

57
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And so we get this starting material.

58
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And so this starting material is back to the basic building block.

59
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And then we use this to do a variety of things --

60
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
like, for example, this film.

61
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And we take advantage of something that is very simple.

62
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
The recipe to make those films

63
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
is to take advantage of the fact

64
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that proteins are extremely smart at what they do.

65
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
They find their way to self-assemble.

66
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So the recipe is simple: you take the silk solution, you pour it,

67
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and you wait for the protein to self-assemble.

68
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And then you detach the protein and you get this film,

69
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
as the proteins find each other as the water evaporates.

70
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But I mentioned that the film is also technological.

71
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And so what does that mean?

72
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
It means that you can interface it

73
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
with some of the things that are typical of technology,

74
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
like microelectronics and nanoscale technology.

75
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And the image of the DVD here

76
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
is just to illustrate a point

77
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that silk follows very subtle topographies of the surface,

78
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
which means that it can replicate features on the nanoscale.

79
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So it would be able to replicate the information

80
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that is on the DVD.

81
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And we can store information that's film with water and protein.

82
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So we tried something out, and we wrote a message in a piece of silk,

83
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
which is right here, and the message is over there.

84
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And much like in the DVD, you can read it out optically.

85
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And this requires a stable hand,

86
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
so this is why I decided to do it onstage in front of a thousand people.

87
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So let me see.

88
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So as you see the film go in transparently through there,

89
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and then ...

90
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
(Applause)

91
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And the most remarkable feat

92
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
is that my hand actually stayed still long enough to do that.

93
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So once you have these attributes

94
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
of this material,

95
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
then you can do a lot of things.

96
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
It's actually not limited to films.

97
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And so the material can assume a lot of formats.

98
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And then you go a little crazy, and so you do various optical components

99
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
or you do microprism arrays,

100
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
like the reflective tape that you have on your running shoes.

101
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Or you can do beautiful things

102
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that, if the camera can capture, you can make.

103
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
You can add a third dimensionality to the film.

104
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And if the angle is right,

105
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
you can actually see a hologram appear in this film of silk.

106
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
But you can do other things.

107
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
You can imagine that then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light,

108
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and so we've made optical fibers.

109
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
But silk is versatile and it goes beyond optics.

110
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And you can think of different formats.

111
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So for instance, if you're afraid of going to the doctor and getting stuck with a needle,

112
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
we do microneedle arrays.

113
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
What you see there on the screen is a human hair

114
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
superimposed on the needle that's made of silk --

115
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
just to give you a sense of size.

116
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
You can do bigger things.

117
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
You can do gears and nuts and bolts --

118
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that you can buy at Whole Foods.

119
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And the gears work in water as well.

120
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So you think of alternative mechanical parts.

121
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And maybe you can use that liquid Kevlar if you need something strong

122
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
to replace peripheral veins, for example,

123
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
or maybe an entire bone.

124
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And so you have here a little example

125
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
of a small skull --

126
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
what we call mini Yorick.

127
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
(Laughter)

128
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
But you can do things like cups, for example,

129
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and so, if you add a little bit of gold, if you add a little bit of semiconductors

130
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
you could do sensors that stick on the surfaces of foods.

131
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
You can do electronic pieces

132
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
that fold and wrap.

133
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Or if you're fashion forward, some silk LED tattoos.

134
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So there's versatility, as you see,

135
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
in the material formats,

136
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that you can do with silk.

137
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
But there are still some unique traits.

138
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I mean, why would you want to do all these things for real?

139
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
I mentioned it briefly at the beginning;

140
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
the protein is biodegradable and biocompatible.

141
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And you see here a picture of a tissue section.

142
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And so what does that mean, that it's biodegradable and biocompatible?

143
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
You can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted.

144
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Which means that all the devices that you've seen before and all the formats,

145
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
in principle, can be implanted and disappear.

146
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And what you see there in that tissue section,

147
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
in fact, is you see that reflector tape.

148
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
So, much like you're seen at night by a car,

149
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
then the idea is that you can see, if you illuminate tissue,

150
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
you can see deeper parts of tissue

151
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
because there is that reflective tape there that is made out of silk.

152
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And you see there, it gets reintegrated in tissue.

153
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And reintegration in the human body

154
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
is not the only thing,

155
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
but reintegration in the environment is important.

156
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So you have a clock, you have protein,

157
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and now a silk cup like this

158
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
can be thrown away without guilt --

159
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
(Applause)

160
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
unlike the polystyrene cups

161
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
that unfortunately fill our landfills everyday.

162
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
It's edible,

163
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
so you can do smart packaging around food

164
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
that you can cook with the food.

165
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
It doesn't taste good,

166
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
so I'm going to need some help with that.

167
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
But probably the most remarkable thing is that it comes full circle.

168
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Silk, during its self-assembly process,

169
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
acts like a cocoon for biological matter.

170
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And so if you change the recipe,

171
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and you add things when you pour --

172
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
so you add things to your liquid silk solution --

173
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
where these things are enzymes

174
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
or antibodies or vaccines,

175
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
the self-assembly process

176
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
preserves the biological function of these dopants.

177
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
So it makes the materials environmentally active

178
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and interactive.

179
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
So that screw that you thought about beforehand

180
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
can actually be used

181
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
to screw a bone together -- a fractured bone together --

182
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and deliver drugs at the same,

183
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
while your bone is healing, for example.

184
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Or you could put drugs in your wallet and not in your fridge.

185
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So we've made a silk card

186
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
with penicillin in it.

187
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And we stored penicillin at 60 degrees C,

188
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
so 140 degrees Fahrenheit,

189
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
for two months without loss of efficacy of the penicillin.

190
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And so that could be ---

191
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
(Applause)

192
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
that could be potentially a good alternative

193
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
to solar powered refrigerated camels. (Laughter)

194
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And of course, there's no use in storage if you can't use [it].

195
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And so there is this other unique material trait

196
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
that these materials have, that they're programmably degradable.

197
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And so what you see there is the difference.

198
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
In the top, you have a film that has been programmed not to degrade,

199
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and in the bottom, a film that has been programmed to degrade in water.

200
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And what you see is that the film on the bottom

201
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
releases what is inside it.

202
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So it allows for the recovery of what we've stored before.

203
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And so this allows for a controlled delivery of drugs

204
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and for reintegration in the environment

205
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
in all of these formats that you've seen.

206
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So the thread of discovery that we have really is a thread.

207
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
We're impassioned with this idea that whatever you want to do,

208
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
whether you want to replace a vein or a bone,

209
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
or maybe be more sustainable in microelectronics,

210
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
perhaps drink a coffee in a cup

211
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and throw it away without guilt,

212
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
maybe carry your drugs in your pocket,

213
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
deliver them inside your body

214
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
or deliver them across the desert,

215
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
the answer may be in a thread of silk.

216
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Thank you.

217
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
(Applause)

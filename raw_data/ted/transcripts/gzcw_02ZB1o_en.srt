1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm going to talk today about saving more,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
but not today, tomorrow.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I'm going to talk about Save More Tomorrow.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
It's a program that Richard Thaler

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
from the University of Chicago and I

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
devised maybe 15 years ago.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
The program, in a sense,

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
is an example of behavioral finance

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
on steroids --

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
how we could really use behavioral finance.

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Now you might ask, what is behavioral finance?

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So let's think about how we manage our money.

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Let's start with mortgages.

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
It's kind of a recent topic,

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
at least in the U.S.

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
A lot of people buy

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
the biggest house they can afford,

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
and actually slightly bigger than that.

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And then they foreclose.

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And then they blame the banks

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
for being the bad guys who gave them the mortgages.

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Let's also think about

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
how we manage risks --

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
for example, investing in the stock market.

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Two years ago, three years ago, about four years ago,

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
markets did well.

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
We were risk takers, of course.

28
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Then market stocks seize

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and we're like, "Wow.

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
These losses, they feel, emotionally,

31
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
they feel very different

32
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
from what we actually thought about it

33
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
when markets were going up."

34
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So we're probably not doing a great job

35
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
when it comes to risk taking.

36
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
How many of you have iPhones?

37
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Anyone? Wonderful.

38
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I would bet many more of you

39
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
insure your iPhone --

40
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
you're implicitly buying insurance by having an extended warranty.

41
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
What if you lose your iPhone?

42
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
What if you do this?

43
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
How many of you have kids?

44
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Anyone?

45
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Keep your hands up

46
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
if you have sufficient life insurance.

47
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I see a lot of hands coming down.

48
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I would predict,

49
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
if you're a representative sample,

50
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that many more of you

51
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
insure your iPhones than your lives,

52
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
even when you have kids.

53
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
We're not doing that well when it comes to insurance.

54
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The average American household

55
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
spends 1,000 dollars a year

56
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
on lotteries.

57
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And I know it sounds crazy.

58
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
How many of you spend a thousand dollars a year on lotteries?

59
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
No one.

60
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So that tells us that the people not in this room

61
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
are spending more than a thousand

62
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
to get the average to a thousand.

63
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Low-income people

64
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
spend a lot more than a thousand on lotteries.

65
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So where does it take us?

66
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
We're not doing a great job managing money.

67
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Behavioral finance is really a combination

68
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
of psychology and economics,

69
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
trying to understand

70
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
the money mistakes people make.

71
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And I can keep standing here

72
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
for the 12 minutes and 53 seconds that I have left

73
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and make fun of all sorts of ways

74
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
we manage money,

75
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and at the end you're going to ask, "How can we help people?"

76
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And that's what I really want to focus on today.

77
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
How do we take an understanding

78
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
of the money mistakes people make,

79
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and then turning the behavioral challenges

80
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
into behavioral solutions?

81
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And what I'm going to talk about today

82
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
is Save More Tomorrow.

83
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I want to address the issue

84
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
of savings.

85
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
We have on the screen

86
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
a representative sample

87
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
of 100 Americans.

88
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And we're going to look at their saving behavior.

89
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
First thing to notice is,

90
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
half of them

91
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
do not even have access

92
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
to a 401(k) plan.

93
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
They cannot make savings easy.

94
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
They cannot have money go away from their paycheck

95
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
into a 401(k) plan

96
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
before they see it,

97
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
before they can touch it.

98
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
What about the remaining half of the people?

99
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Some of them elect not to save.

100
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
They're just too lazy.

101
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
They never get around to logging into a complicated website

102
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and doing 17 clicks to join the 401(k) plan.

103
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And then they have to decide how they're going to invest

104
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
in their 52 choices,

105
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and they never heard about what is a money market fund.

106
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And they get overwhelmed and the just don't join.

107
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
How many people end up saving to a 401(k) plan?

108
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
One third of Americans.

109
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Two thirds are not saving now.

110
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Are they saving enough?

111
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Take out those

112
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
who say they save too little.

113
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
One out of 10

114
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
are saving enough.

115
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Nine out of 10

116
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
either cannot save through their 401(k) plan,

117
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
decide not to save -- or don't decide --

118
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
or save too little.

119
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
We think we have a problem

120
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
of people saving too much.

121
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Let's look at that.

122
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
We have one person --

123
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
well, actually we're going to slice him in half

124
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
because it's less than one percent.

125
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Roughly half a percent of Americans

126
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
feel that they save too much.

127
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
What are we going to do about it?

128
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
That's what I really want to focus on.

129
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
We have to understand

130
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
why people are not saving,

131
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and then we can hopefully flip

132
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
the behavioral challenges

133
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
into behavioral solutions,

134
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and then see how powerful it might be.

135
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So let me divert for a second

136
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
as we're going to identify the problems,

137
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
the challenges, the behavioral challenges,

138
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
that prevent people from saving.

139
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I'm going to divert and talk about bananas and chocolate.

140
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Suppose we had another wonderful TED event next week.

141
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And during the break

142
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
there would be a snack

143
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and you could choose bananas or chocolate.

144
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
How many of you think you would like to have bananas

145
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
during this hypothetical TED event next week?

146
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Who would go for bananas?

147
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Wonderful.

148
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I predict scientifically

149
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
74 percent of you will go for bananas.

150
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Well that's at least what one wonderful study predicted.

151
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And then count down the days

152
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and see what people ended up eating.

153
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
The same people that imagined themselves

154
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
eating the bananas

155
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
ended up eating chocolates

156
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
a week later.

157
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Self-control

158
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
is not a problem in the future.

159
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
It's only a problem now

160
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
when the chocolate is next to us.

161
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
What does it have to do with time and savings,

162
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
this issue of immediate gratification?

163
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Or as some economists call it, present bias.

164
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
We think about saving. We know we should be saving.

165
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
We know we'll do it next year, but today let us go and spend.

166
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Christmas is coming,

167
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
we might as well buy a lot of gifts for everyone we know.

168
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So this issue of present bias

169
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
causes us to think about saving,

170
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
but end up spending.

171
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Let me now talk

172
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
about another behavioral obstacle to saving

173
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
having to do with inertia.

174
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
But again, a little diversion

175
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
to the topic of organ donation.

176
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Wonderful study comparing different countries.

177
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
We're going to look at two similar countries,

178
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Germany and Austria.

179
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And in Germany,

180
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
if you would like to donate your organs --

181
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
God forbid something really bad

182
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
happens to you --

183
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
when you get your driving license or an I.D.,

184
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
you check the box saying,

185
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
"I would like to donate my organs."

186
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Not many people like checking boxes.

187
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
It takes effort. You need to think.

188
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Twelve percent do.

189
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Austria, a neighboring country,

190
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
slightly similar, slightly different.

191
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
What's the difference?

192
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Well, you still have choice.

193
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
You will decide

194
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
whether you want to donate your organs or not.

195
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
But when you get your driving license,

196
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
you check the box

197
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
if you do not want to donate your organ.

198
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Nobody checks boxes.

199
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
That's kind of too much effort.

200
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
One percent check the box. The rest do nothing.

201
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Doing nothing is very common.

202
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Not many people check boxes.

203
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
What are the implications

204
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
to saving lives

205
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and having organs available?

206
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
In Germany, 12 percent check the box.

207
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Twelve percent are organ donors.

208
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Huge shortage of organs,

209
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
God forbid, if you need one.

210
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
In Austria, again, nobody checks the box.

211
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Therefore, 99 percent of people

212
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
are organ donors.

213
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Inertia, lack of action.

214
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
What is the default setting

215
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
if people do nothing,

216
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
if they keep procrastinating, if they don't check the boxes?

217
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Very powerful.

218
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
We're going to talk

219
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
about what happens if people are overwhelmed and scared

220
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
to make their 401(k) choices.

221
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Are we going to make them automatically join the plan,

222
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
or are they going to be left out?

223
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
In too many 401(k) plans,

224
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
if people do nothing,

225
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
it means they're not saving for retirement,

226
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
if they don't check the box.

227
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And checking the box takes effort.

228
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So we've chatted about a couple of behavioral challenges.

229
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
One more before we flip the challenges into solutions,

230
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
having to do with monkeys and apples.

231
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
No, no, no, this is a real study

232
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and it's got a lot to do with behavioral economics.

233
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
One group of monkeys gets an apple, they're pretty happy.

234
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
The other group gets two apples, one is taken away.

235
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
They still have an apple left.

236
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
They're really mad.

237
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Why have you taken our apple?

238
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
This is the notion of loss aversion.

239
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
We hate losing stuff,

240
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
even if it doesn't mean a lot of risk.

241
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
You would hate to go to the ATM,

242
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
take out 100 dollars

243
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and notice that you lost one of those $20 bills.

244
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
It's very painful,

245
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
even though it doesn't mean anything.

246
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Those 20 dollars might have been a quick lunch.

247
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
So this notion of loss aversion

248
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
kicks in when it comes to savings too,

249
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
because people, mentally

250
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and emotionally and intuitively

251
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
frame savings as a loss

252
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
because I have to cut my spending.

253
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
So we talked about

254
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
all sorts of behavioral challenges

255
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
having to do with savings eventually.

256
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Whether you think about immediate gratification,

257
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and the chocolates versus bananas,

258
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
it's just painful to save now.

259
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
It's a lot more fun

260
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
to spend now.

261
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
We talked about inertia and organ donations

262
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and checking the box.

263
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
If people have to check a lot of boxes

264
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
to join a 401(k) plan,

265
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
they're going to keep procrastinating

266
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and not join.

267
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And last, we talked about loss aversion,

268
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and the monkeys and the apples.

269
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
If people frame mentally

270
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
saving for retirement as a loss,

271
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
they're not going to be saving for retirement.

272
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
So we've got these challenges,

273
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and what Richard Thaler and I

274
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
were always fascinated by --

275
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
take behavioral finance,

276
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
make it behavioral finance on steroids

277
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
or behavioral finance 2.0

278
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
or behavioral finance in action --

279
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
flip the challenges into solutions.

280
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And we came up with an embarrassingly simple solution

281
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
called Save More, not today, Tomorrow.

282
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
How is it going to solve the challenges

283
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
we chatted about?

284
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
If you think about the problem

285
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
of bananas versus chocolates,

286
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
we think we're going to eat bananas next week.

287
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
We think we're going to save more next year.

288
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Save More Tomorrow

289
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
invites employees

290
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
to save more maybe next year --

291
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
sometime in the future

292
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
when we can imagine ourselves

293
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
eating bananas,

294
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
volunteering more in the community,

295
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
exercising more and doing all the right things on the planet.

296
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Now we also talked about checking the box

297
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and the difficulty of taking action.

298
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Save More Tomorrow

299
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
makes it easy.

300
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
It's an autopilot.

301
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Once you tell me you would like to save more in the future,

302
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
let's say every January

303
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
you're going to be saving more automatically

304
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
and it's going to go away from your paycheck to the 401(k) plan

305
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
before you see it, before you touch it,

306
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
before you get the issue

307
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
of immediate gratification.

308
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
But what are we going to do about the monkeys

309
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and loss aversion?

310
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Next January comes

311
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and people might feel that if they save more,

312
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
they have to spend less, and that's painful.

313
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Well, maybe it shouldn't be just January.

314
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Maybe we should make people save more

315
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
when they make more money.

316
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
That way, when they make more money, when they get a pay raise,

317
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
they don't have to cut their spending.

318
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
They take a little bit

319
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
of the increase in the paycheck home

320
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and spend more --

321
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
take a little bit of the increase

322
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and put it in a 401(k) plan.

323
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
So that is the program,

324
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
embarrassingly simple,

325
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
but as we're going to see,

326
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
extremely powerful.

327
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
We first implemented it,

328
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Richard Thaler and I,

329
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
back in 1998.

330
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Mid-sized company in the Midwest,

331
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
blue collar employees

332
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
struggling to pay their bills

333
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
repeatedly told us

334
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
they cannot save more right away.

335
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Saving more today is not an option.

336
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
We invited them to save

337
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
three percentage points more

338
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
every time they get a pay raise.

339
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
And here are the results.

340
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
We're seeing here a three and a half-year period,

341
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
four pay raises,

342
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
people who were struggling to save,

343
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
were saving three percent of their paycheck,

344
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
three and a half years later

345
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
saving almost four times as much,

346
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
almost 14 percent.

347
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And there's shoes and bicycles

348
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and things on this chart

349
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
because I don't want to just throw numbers

350
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
in a vacuum.

351
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
I want, really, to think about the fact

352
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
that saving four times more

353
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
is a huge difference

354
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
in terms of the lifestyle

355
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
that people will be able to afford.

356
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
It's real.

357
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
It's not just numbers on a piece of paper.

358
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Whereas with saving three percent,

359
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
people might have to add nice sneakers

360
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
so they can walk,

361
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
because they won't be able to afford anything else,

362
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
when they save 14 percent

363
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
they might be able to maybe have nice dress shoes

364
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
to walk to the car to drive.

365
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
This is a real difference.

366
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
By now, about 60 percent of the large companies

367
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
actually have programs like this in place.

368
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
It's been part of the Pension Protection Act.

369
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
And needless to say that Thaler and I

370
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
have been blessed to be part of this program

371
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and make a difference.

372
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Let me wrap

373
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
with two key messages.

374
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
One is behavioral finance

375
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
is extremely powerful.

376
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
This is just one example.

377
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
Message two

378
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
is there's still a lot to do.

379
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
This is really the tip of the iceberg.

380
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
If you think about people and mortgages

381
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
and buying houses and then not being able to pay for it,

382
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
we need to think about that.

383
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
If you're thinking about people taking too much risk

384
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
and not understanding how much risk they're taking

385
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
or taking too little risk,

386
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
we need to think about that.

387
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
If you think about people spending a thousand dollars a year

388
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
on lottery tickets,

389
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
we need to think about that.

390
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
The average actually,

391
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
the record is in Singapore.

392
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
The average household

393
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
spends $4,000 a year on lottery tickets.

394
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
We've got a lot to do,

395
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
a lot to solve,

396
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
also in the retirement area

397
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
when it comes to what people do with their money

398
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
after retirement.

399
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
One last question:

400
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
How many of you feel comfortable

401
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
that as you're planning for retirement

402
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
you have a really solid plan

403
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
when you're going to retire,

404
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
when you're going to claim Social Security benefits,

405
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
what lifestyle to expect,

406
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
how much to spend every month

407
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
so you're not going to run out of money?

408
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
How many of you feel you have a solid plan for the future

409
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
when it comes to post-retirement decisions.

410
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
One, two, three, four.

411
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
Less than three percent

412
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
of a very sophisticated audience.

413
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
Behavioral finance has a long way.

414
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
There's a lot of opportunities

415
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
to make it powerful again and again and again.

416
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
Thank you.

417
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
(Applause)

0:00:12.772,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Two months ago, my kids and I huddled around a cell phone

2
0:00:16.98,000 --> 0:00:18,000
watching the live stream of the Game Awards,

3
0:00:19.3,000 --> 0:00:21,000
one of the video game industry's biggest nights.

4
0:00:22.22,000 --> 0:00:25,000
They announced the nominees for the Game for Impact,

5
0:00:25.9,000 --> 0:00:28,000
an award that's given to a thought-provoking video game

6
0:00:28.98,000 --> 0:00:31,000
with a profound prosocial message or meaning.

7
0:00:32.78,000 --> 0:00:33,000
They opened the envelope

8
0:00:34.5,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and they read the title of our video game.

9
0:00:37.74,000 --> 0:00:38,000
An award ...

10
0:00:39.14,000 --> 0:00:4,000
for impact.

11
0:00:40.98,000 --> 0:00:41,000
It was almost funny, actually,

12
0:00:42.7,000 --> 0:00:44,000
because I always thought that winning an award like that

13
0:00:45.38,000 --> 0:00:47,000
would have this huge impact on my life,

14
0:00:48.06,000 --> 0:00:5,000
but I found that the opposite is true.

15
0:00:51.66,000 --> 0:00:52,000
The big nights,

16
0:00:53.1,000 --> 0:00:55,000
the accomplishments --

17
0:00:55.22,000 --> 0:00:56,000
they fade.

18
0:00:56.82,000 --> 0:00:59,000
But the hardest nights of my life have stuck with me,

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
impacting who I am

20
0:01:02.78,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and what I do.

21
0:01:05.18,000 --> 0:01:11,000
In 2010, my third son, Joel, was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive brain tumor.

22
0:01:12.3,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And before that year was finished,

23
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
doctors sat my husband and I down

24
0:01:16.82,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and let us know that his tumor had returned

25
0:01:20.1,000 --> 0:01:24,000
despite the most aggressive chemotherapy and radiation that they could offer him.

26
0:01:25.9,000 --> 0:01:26,000
On that terrible night,

27
0:01:27.82,000 --> 0:01:31,000
after learning that Joel had perhaps four months to live,

28
0:01:31.94,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I cuddled up with my two older sons in bed --

29
0:01:34.82,000 --> 0:01:36,000
they were five and three at the time --

30
0:01:37.38,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and I never really knew how much they understood,

31
0:01:40.5,000 --> 0:01:43,000
so I started telling them a bedtime story.

32
0:01:44.22,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I told them about this very brave knight named Joel

33
0:01:48.1,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and his adventure fighting a terrible dragon called cancer.

34
0:01:53.54,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Every night, I told them more of the story,

35
0:01:56.62,000 --> 0:01:58,000
but I never let the story end.

36
0:01:58.66,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I was just building up a context that they could understand

37
0:02:01.82,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and hoping that our prayers would be answered

38
0:02:04.1,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and I would never have to tell them that that knight,

39
0:02:06.62,000 --> 0:02:08,000
who had fought so bravely,

40
0:02:08.94,000 --> 0:02:09,000
was done fighting

41
0:02:10.5,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and could rest now, forever.

42
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Fortunately, I never did have to finish that bedtime story.

43
0:02:18.78,000 --> 0:02:2,000
My children outgrew it.

44
0:02:20.98,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Joel responded better than anyone expected to palliative treatment,

45
0:02:25.1,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and so instead of months,

46
0:02:26.78,000 --> 0:02:32,000
we spent years learning how to love our dying child with all of our hearts.

47
0:02:33.9,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Learning to recognize that shameful feeling

48
0:02:36.46,000 --> 0:02:38,000
of holding back just a little love

49
0:02:39.38,000 --> 0:02:41,000
to try to spare ourselves just a little pain

50
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
somewhere further down the road.

51
0:02:45.58,000 --> 0:02:47,000
We pushed past that self-preservation

52
0:02:48.06,000 --> 0:02:52,000
because Joel was worth loving even if that love could crush us.

53
0:02:54.02,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And that lesson of intense vulnerability has changed me ...

54
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
more than any award ever could.

55
0:03:02.22,000 --> 0:03:05,000
We started living like Joel could live,

56
0:03:05.58,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and we began developing a video game called "That Dragon, Cancer."

57
0:03:11.74,000 --> 0:03:13,000
It was the story of Joel.

58
0:03:14.58,000 --> 0:03:17,000
It was the story of hope in the shadow of death.

59
0:03:18.1,000 --> 0:03:19,000
It was the story of faith

60
0:03:20.46,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and doubt,

61
0:03:21.94,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and the realization that a wrestle with doubt is a part of faith --

62
0:03:27.94,000 --> 0:03:28,000
maybe the biggest part of it.

63
0:03:30.38,000 --> 0:03:33,000
It was a story that began as a miracle

64
0:03:33.86,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and ended as a memorial.

(Music)

77
0:04:15.38,000 --> 0:04:16,000
When you play "That Dragon, Cancer,"

78
0:04:17.3,000 --> 0:04:2,000
you're transformed into a witness of Joel's life,

79
0:04:21.3,000 --> 0:04:23,000
exploring an emotional landscape,

80
0:04:23.5,000 --> 0:04:28,000
clicking to discover more of what we as a family felt and experienced.

81
0:04:29.06,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It feels a little bit like analyzing interactive poetry

82
0:04:33.62,000 --> 0:04:35,000
because every game mechanic is a metaphor,

83
0:04:35.98,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and so the more the player asks themselves

84
0:04:38.38,000 --> 0:04:41,000
what we as designers were trying to express and why,

85
0:04:42.34,000 --> 0:04:44,000
the richer the experience becomes.

86
0:04:45.22,000 --> 0:04:48,000
We took that vulnerability that Joel taught us,

87
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and we encoded the game with it.

88
0:04:51.34,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Players expect their video games to offer them branching narrative

89
0:04:54.94,000 --> 0:04:57,000
so that every decision that they make feels important

90
0:04:58.5,000 --> 0:05:,000
and can change the outcome of the game.

91
0:05:01.22,000 --> 0:05:03,000
We subverted that principle of game design,

92
0:05:04.02,000 --> 0:05:07,000
collapsing the choices in on the player

93
0:05:07.42,000 --> 0:05:08,000
so that they discover for themselves

94
0:05:09.22,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that there is nothing that they can do that will change the outcome for Joel.

95
0:05:14.1,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And they feel that discovery as deeply and desperately as we felt it

96
0:05:19.9,000 --> 0:05:23,000
on nights when we held Joel in our arms praying for hours,

97
0:05:24.1,000 --> 0:05:29,000
stubbornly holding out hope for a grace that we could not create for ourselves.

98
0:05:30.78,000 --> 0:05:31,000
We'd all prefer to win,

99
0:05:32.98,000 --> 0:05:34,000
but when you discover that you can't win,

100
0:05:36.38,000 --> 0:05:37,000
what do you value instead?

101
0:05:39.42,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I never planned to write video games,

102
0:05:41.66,000 --> 0:05:43,000
but these moments that really change our lives,

103
0:05:44.22,000 --> 0:05:48,000
they often come as the result of our hardship -- and not our glory.

104
0:05:49.34,000 --> 0:05:51,000
When we thought that Joel could live,

105
0:05:51.46,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I left the game designing to my husband.

106
0:05:53.62,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I chimed in here and there

107
0:05:55.7,000 --> 0:05:57,000
with a scene or two and some suggestions.

108
0:05:58.7,000 --> 0:06:,000
But after the night that Joel died,

109
0:06:02.3,000 --> 0:06:03,000
the passion,

110
0:06:03.74,000 --> 0:06:07,000
the possibility of sharing Joel's life through our video game --

111
0:06:07.94,000 --> 0:06:09,000
it was something that I couldn't resist.

112
0:06:10.1,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I started writing more,

113
0:06:11.46,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I sat in on our team's design meetings,

114
0:06:13.9,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I added more ideas and I helped direct scenes.

115
0:06:17.02,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And I discovered that creating a video game is telling a story,

116
0:06:21.94,000 --> 0:06:23,000
but with an entirely new vocabulary.

117
0:06:24.7,000 --> 0:06:29,000
All the same elements of imagination and symbolism are there,

118
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
but they're just partnered with player agency

119
0:06:32.9,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and system responsiveness.

120
0:06:35.9,000 --> 0:06:36,000
It's challenging work.

121
0:06:37.58,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I have to think in a totally new way to do it,

122
0:06:40.62,000 --> 0:06:41,000
but I love it.

123
0:06:42.3,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And I wouldn't have known that without Joel.

124
0:06:46.1,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Maybe you're a little surprised

125
0:06:48.42,000 --> 0:06:53,000
by our choice to share our story of terminal cancer through a video game.

126
0:06:54.18,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Perhaps you're even thinking like so many people before you:

127
0:06:57.54,000 --> 0:06:59,000
cancer is not a game.

128
0:07:01.1,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Well, tell that to any pediatric cancer parent

129
0:07:03.3,000 --> 0:07:06,000
that's ever taken an exam glove and blown it up into a balloon,

130
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
or transformed a syringe into a rocket ship,

131
0:07:10.02,000 --> 0:07:14,000
or let their child ride their IV pole through the hospital halls

132
0:07:14.18,000 --> 0:07:15,000
like it was a race car.

133
0:07:16.7,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Because when you have children,

134
0:07:18.82,000 --> 0:07:19,000
everything is a game.

135
0:07:21.46,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And when your young child experiences something traumatic,

136
0:07:25.42,000 --> 0:07:29,000
you work even harder to make sure that their life feels like a game

137
0:07:29.5,000 --> 0:07:32,000
because children naturally explore their worlds through play.

138
0:07:34.14,000 --> 0:07:36,000
While cancer can steal many things from a family,

139
0:07:37.1,000 --> 0:07:38,000
it shouldn't steal play.

140
0:07:39.7,000 --> 0:07:42,000
If you're listening to me and you're trying to imagine this family

141
0:07:43.3,000 --> 0:07:47,000
that revolves entirely around a dying child,

142
0:07:47.54,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and you can't imagine joy as part of that picture,

143
0:07:51.58,000 --> 0:07:54,000
then we were right to share our story with you,

144
0:07:54.66,000 --> 0:07:57,000
because that season of our life was hard.

145
0:07:58.34,000 --> 0:08:,000
Unspeakably hard at times,

146
0:08:01.14,000 --> 0:08:03,000
but it was also pure hope,

147
0:08:03.82,000 --> 0:08:04,000
deep love

148
0:08:05.46,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and joy like I have never experienced since.

149
0:08:09.54,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Our video game was our attempt to share that world

150
0:08:13.7,000 --> 0:08:15,000
with people who hadn't experienced it before,

151
0:08:15.94,000 --> 0:08:18,000
because we never could imagine that world until it became ours.

152
0:08:21.02,000 --> 0:08:24,000
We made a video game that's hard to play.

153
0:08:25.18,000 --> 0:08:27,000
It will never be a blockbuster.

154
0:08:27.46,000 --> 0:08:3,000
People have to prepare themselves to invest emotionally

155
0:08:31.22,000 --> 0:08:34,000
in a story that they know will break their hearts.

156
0:08:35.7,000 --> 0:08:37,000
But when our hearts break,

157
0:08:38.06,000 --> 0:08:4,000
they heal a little differently.

158
0:08:41.82,000 --> 0:08:45,000
My broken heart has been healing with a new and a deeper compassion --

159
0:08:46.739,000 --> 0:08:48,000
a desire to sit with people in their pain,

160
0:08:49.7,000 --> 0:08:52,000
to hear their stories and try to help tell them

161
0:08:52.739,000 --> 0:08:53,000
so that they know that they're seen.

162
0:08:56.42,000 --> 0:09:,000
On the night when "That Dragon, Cancer" won the Game for Impact Award,

163
0:09:00.78,000 --> 0:09:01,000
we cheered,

164
0:09:02.22,000 --> 0:09:05,000
we smiled and we talked about Joel

165
0:09:05.42,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and the impact he had on our life --

166
0:09:07.7,000 --> 0:09:11,000
on all of those hard and hopeful nights that we shared with him

167
0:09:11.82,000 --> 0:09:12,000
when he changed our hearts

168
0:09:13.3,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and taught us so much more about life and love and faith and purpose.

169
0:09:20.38,000 --> 0:09:25,000
That award will never mean as much to me as even a single photograph of my son,

170
0:09:27.02,000 --> 0:09:31,000
but it does represent all of the people who his life has impacted,

171
0:09:31.7,000 --> 0:09:33,000
people I'll never meet.

172
0:09:33.82,000 --> 0:09:35,000
They write me emails sometimes.

173
0:09:36.7,000 --> 0:09:41,000
They tell me that they miss Joel, even though they never met him.

174
0:09:42.18,000 --> 0:09:46,000
They describe the tears that they've shed for my son,

175
0:09:47.74,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and it makes my burden of grief just a little bit lighter

176
0:09:51.58,000 --> 0:09:53,000
knowing that it's shared with a 10-year-old

177
0:09:53.7,000 --> 0:09:55,000
watching a YouTube playthrough,

178
0:09:55.74,000 --> 0:09:59,000
or a doctor playing on his airplane with a smartphone,

179
0:09:59.98,000 --> 0:10:04,000
or a professor introducing Joel to her first-year philosophy students.

180
0:10:06.62,000 --> 0:10:09,000
We made a video game that's hard to play.

181
0:10:11.1,000 --> 0:10:13,000
But that feels just right to me,

182
0:10:14.06,000 --> 0:10:16,000
because the hardest moments of our lives

183
0:10:16.66,000 --> 0:10:19,000
change us more than any goal we could ever accomplish.

184
0:10:21.14,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Tragedy has shifted my heart

185
0:10:23.82,000 --> 0:10:26,000
more than any dream I could ever see come true.

186
0:10:27.94,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Thank you.

187
0:10:29.18,000 --> 0:10:33,000
(Applause)

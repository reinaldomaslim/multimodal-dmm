1
0:00:12.526,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm a marine biologist

2
0:00:14.71,000 --> 0:00:17,000
here to talk to you about the crisis in our oceans,

3
0:00:17.869,000 --> 0:00:2,000
but this time perhaps not with a message you've heard before,

4
0:00:21.871,000 --> 0:00:24,000
because I want to tell you that if the survival of the oceans

5
0:00:25.189,000 --> 0:00:28,000
depended only on people like me,

6
0:00:28.799,000 --> 0:00:31,000
scientists trading in publications,

7
0:00:32.045,000 --> 0:00:34,000
we'd be in even worse trouble than we are.

8
0:00:34.815,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Because, as a scientist,

9
0:00:36.74,000 --> 0:00:38,000
the most important things that I've learned

10
0:00:39.128,000 --> 0:00:42,000
about keeping our oceans healthy and productive

11
0:00:42.632,000 --> 0:00:45,000
have come not from academia, but from fishermen and women

12
0:00:46.465,000 --> 0:00:48,000
living in some of the poorest countries on earth.

13
0:00:49.379,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I've learned that as a conservationist,

14
0:00:51.402,000 --> 0:00:54,000
the most important question is not, "How do we keep people out?"

15
0:00:55.728,000 --> 0:01:,000
but rather, "How do we make sure that coastal people throughout the world

16
0:01:00.77,000 --> 0:01:01,000
have enough to eat?"

17
0:01:03.079,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Our oceans are every bit as critical to our own survival

18
0:01:06.709,000 --> 0:01:09,000
as our atmosphere, our forests or our soils.

19
0:01:09.869,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Their staggering productivity ranks fisheries with farming

20
0:01:13.481,000 --> 0:01:15,000
as a mainstay of food production

21
0:01:15.607,000 --> 0:01:16,000
for humanity.

22
0:01:17.321,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Yet something's gone badly wrong.

23
0:01:19.976,000 --> 0:01:21,000
We're accelerating into an extinction emergency,

24
0:01:22.872,000 --> 0:01:27,000
one that my field has so far failed abysmally to tackle.

25
0:01:28.273,000 --> 0:01:32,000
At its core is a very human and humanitarian crisis.

26
0:01:33.316,000 --> 0:01:35,000
The most devastating blow we've so far dealt our oceans

27
0:01:36.226,000 --> 0:01:37,000
is through overfishing.

28
0:01:38.005,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Every year, we fish harder, deeper, further afield.

29
0:01:41.688,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Every year, we chase ever fewer fish.

30
0:01:44.912,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Yet the crisis of overfishing is a great paradox:

31
0:01:48.614,000 --> 0:01:52,000
unnecessary, avoidable and entirely reversible,

32
0:01:52.837,000 --> 0:01:56,000
because fisheries are one of the most productive resources on the planet.

33
0:01:57.631,000 --> 0:02:,000
With the right strategies, we can reverse overfishing.

34
0:02:01.846,000 --> 0:02:04,000
That we've not yet done so is, to my mind,

35
0:02:04.982,000 --> 0:02:06,000
one of humanity's greatest failures.

36
0:02:07.902,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Nowhere is this failure more apparent

37
0:02:10.623,000 --> 0:02:13,000
than in the warm waters on either side of our equator.

38
0:02:14.179,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Our tropics are home to most of the species in our ocean,

39
0:02:18.047,000 --> 0:02:21,000
most of the people whose existence depends on our seas.

40
0:02:22.445,000 --> 0:02:25,000
We call these coastal fishermen and women "small-scale fishers,"

41
0:02:26.24,000 --> 0:02:28,000
but "small-scale" is a misnomer

42
0:02:28.494,000 --> 0:02:33,000
for a fleet comprising over 90 percent of the world's fishermen and women.

43
0:02:34.198,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Their fishing is generally more selective and sustainable

44
0:02:37.964,000 --> 0:02:39,000
than the indiscriminate destruction

45
0:02:40.309,000 --> 0:02:43,000
too often wrought by bigger industrial boats.

46
0:02:43.473,000 --> 0:02:46,000
These coastal people have the most to gain from conservation

47
0:02:46.585,000 --> 0:02:47,000
because, for many of them,

48
0:02:48.246,000 --> 0:02:52,000
fishing is all that keeps them from poverty, hunger or forced migration,

49
0:02:53.22,000 --> 0:02:56,000
in countries where the state is often unable to help.

50
0:02:57.313,000 --> 0:02:59,000
We know that the outlook is grim:

51
0:02:59.568,000 --> 0:03:02,000
stocks collapsing on the front lines of climate change,

52
0:03:03.005,000 --> 0:03:06,000
warming seas, dying reefs, catastrophic storms,

53
0:03:06.695,000 --> 0:03:08,000
trawlers, factory fleets,

54
0:03:09.307,000 --> 0:03:13,000
rapacious ships from richer countries taking more than their share.

55
0:03:13.665,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Extreme vulnerability is the new normal.

56
0:03:17.692,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I first landed on the island of Madagascar two decades ago,

57
0:03:21.557,000 --> 0:03:24,000
on a mission to document its marine natural history.

58
0:03:24.872,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I was mesmerized by the coral reefs I explored,

59
0:03:28.065,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and certain I knew how to protect them,

60
0:03:30.345,000 --> 0:03:32,000
because science provided all the answers:

61
0:03:32.991,000 --> 0:03:34,000
close areas of the reef permanently.

62
0:03:35.84,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Coastal fishers simply needed to fish less.

63
0:03:38.846,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I approached elders here in the village of Andavadoaka

64
0:03:42.339,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and recommended that they close off

65
0:03:44.118,000 --> 0:03:47,000
the healthiest and most diverse coral reefs to all forms of fishing

66
0:03:47.682,000 --> 0:03:49,000
to form a refuge to help stocks recover

67
0:03:50.412,000 --> 0:03:54,000
because, as the science tells us, after five or so years,

68
0:03:55.072,000 --> 0:03:58,000
fish populations inside those refuges would be much bigger,

69
0:03:58.929,000 --> 0:04:,000
replenishing the fished areas outside,

70
0:04:01.369,000 --> 0:04:03,000
making everybody better off.

71
0:04:03.927,000 --> 0:04:05,000
That conversation didn't go so well.

72
0:04:06.758,000 --> 0:04:07,000
(Laughter)

73
0:04:07.964,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Three-quarters of Madagascar's 27 million people

74
0:04:11.314,000 --> 0:04:13,000
live on less than two dollars a day.

75
0:04:13.519,000 --> 0:04:15,000
My earnest appeal to fish less took no account

76
0:04:16.359,000 --> 0:04:17,000
of what that might actually mean

77
0:04:18.38,000 --> 0:04:2,000
for people who depend on fishing for survival.

78
0:04:20.77,000 --> 0:04:22,000
It was just another squeeze from outside,

79
0:04:23.365,000 --> 0:04:25,000
a restriction rather than a solution.

80
0:04:26.338,000 --> 0:04:3,000
What does protecting a long list of Latin species names mean to Resaxx,

81
0:04:30.615,000 --> 0:04:32,000
a woman from Andavadoaka who fishes every day

82
0:04:32.91,000 --> 0:04:33,000
to put food on the table

83
0:04:34.759,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and send her grandchildren to school?

84
0:04:37.941,000 --> 0:04:41,000
That initial rejection taught me that conservation is, at its core,

85
0:04:43.219,000 --> 0:04:46,000
a journey in listening deeply,

86
0:04:46.779,000 --> 0:04:49,000
to understand the pressures and realities that communities face

87
0:04:50.302,000 --> 0:04:51,000
through their dependence on nature.

88
0:04:52.146,000 --> 0:04:55,000
This idea became the founding principle for my work

89
0:04:55.901,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and grew into an organization that brought a new approach

90
0:04:58.957,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to ocean conservation

91
0:05:00.338,000 --> 0:05:04,000
by working to rebuild fisheries with coastal communities.

92
0:05:05.15,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Then, as now, the work started by listening,

93
0:05:08.835,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and what we learned astonished us.

94
0:05:11.644,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Back in the dry south of Madagascar,

95
0:05:13.407,000 --> 0:05:16,000
we learned that one species was immensely important for villagers:

96
0:05:16.803,000 --> 0:05:18,000
this remarkable octopus.

97
0:05:18.928,000 --> 0:05:22,000
We learned that soaring demand was depleting an economic lifeline.

98
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But we also learned that this animal grows astonishingly fast,

99
0:05:27.012,000 --> 0:05:3,000
doubling in weight every one or two months.

100
0:05:30.22,000 --> 0:05:33,000
We reasoned that protecting just a small area of fishing ground

101
0:05:33.923,000 --> 0:05:34,000
for just a few months

102
0:05:35.472,000 --> 0:05:38,000
might lead to dramatic increases in catches,

103
0:05:38.649,000 --> 0:05:41,000
enough to make a difference to this community's bottom line

104
0:05:42.016,000 --> 0:05:44,000
in a time frame that might just be acceptable.

105
0:05:45.895,000 --> 0:05:46,000
The community thought so too,

106
0:05:47.357,000 --> 0:05:51,000
opting to close a small area of reef to octopus fishing temporarily,

107
0:05:52.01,000 --> 0:05:54,000
using a customary social code,

108
0:05:54.24,000 --> 0:05:57,000
invoking blessings from the ancestors to prevent poaching.

109
0:05:58.93,000 --> 0:06:01,000
When that reef reopened to fishing six months later,

110
0:06:02.266,000 --> 0:06:05,000
none of us were prepared for what happened next.

111
0:06:05.945,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Catches soared,

112
0:06:07.846,000 --> 0:06:1,000
with men and women landing more and bigger octopus

113
0:06:11.037,000 --> 0:06:13,000
than anyone had seen for years.

114
0:06:13.251,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Neighboring villages saw the fishing boom

115
0:06:15.815,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and drew up their own closures,

116
0:06:17.355,000 --> 0:06:2,000
spreading the model virally along hundreds of miles of coastline.

117
0:06:20.935,000 --> 0:06:21,000
When we ran the numbers,

118
0:06:22.547,000 --> 0:06:25,000
we saw that these communities, among the poorest on earth,

119
0:06:25.848,000 --> 0:06:29,000
had found a way to double their money in a matter of months, by fishing less.

120
0:06:31.584,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Imagine a savings account

121
0:06:33.14,000 --> 0:06:35,000
from which you withdraw half your balance every year

122
0:06:35.627,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and your savings keep growing.

123
0:06:37.174,000 --> 0:06:4,000
There is no investment opportunity on earth

124
0:06:40.602,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that can reliably deliver what fisheries can.

125
0:06:44.244,000 --> 0:06:47,000
But the real magic went beyond profit,

126
0:06:47.625,000 --> 0:06:51,000
because a far deeper transformation was happening in these communities.

127
0:06:52.442,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Spurred on by rising catches,

128
0:06:54.408,000 --> 0:06:58,000
leaders from Andavadoaka joined force with two dozen neighboring communities

129
0:06:59.013,000 --> 0:07:04,000
to establish a vast conservation area along dozens of miles of coastline.

130
0:07:04.735,000 --> 0:07:07,000
They outlawed fishing with poison and mosquito nets

131
0:07:07.815,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and set aside permanent refuges

132
0:07:09.901,000 --> 0:07:11,000
around threatened coral reefs and mangroves,

133
0:07:12.518,000 --> 0:07:14,000
including, to my astonishment,

134
0:07:15.259,000 --> 0:07:18,000
those same sights that I'd flagged just two years earlier

135
0:07:19.022,000 --> 0:07:23,000
when my evangelism for marine protection was so roundly rejected.

136
0:07:23.449,000 --> 0:07:25,000
They created a community-led protected area,

137
0:07:26.118,000 --> 0:07:29,000
a democratic system for local marine governance

138
0:07:29.76,000 --> 0:07:32,000
that was totally unimaginable just a few years earlier.

139
0:07:33.95,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And they didn't stop there:

140
0:07:35.506,000 --> 0:07:38,000
within five years, they'd secured legal rights from the state

141
0:07:38.852,000 --> 0:07:41,000
to manage over 200 square miles of ocean,

142
0:07:41.891,000 --> 0:07:46,000
eliminating destructive industrial trawlers from the waters.

143
0:07:47.011,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Ten years on, we're seeing recovery of those critical reefs

144
0:07:50.091,000 --> 0:07:51,000
within those refuges.

145
0:07:51.726,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Communities are petitioning for greater recognition

146
0:07:54.687,000 --> 0:07:55,000
of the right to fish

147
0:07:56.377,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and fairer prices that reward sustainability.

148
0:07:59.502,000 --> 0:08:02,000
But all that is just the beginning of the story,

149
0:08:03.24,000 --> 0:08:06,000
because this handful of fishing villages taking action

150
0:08:06.828,000 --> 0:08:08,000
has sparked a marine conservation revolution

151
0:08:09.611,000 --> 0:08:11,000
that has spread over thousands of miles,

152
0:08:12.016,000 --> 0:08:14,000
impacting hundreds of thousands of people.

153
0:08:14.738,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Today in Madagascar, hundreds of sites are managed by communities

154
0:08:18.596,000 --> 0:08:2,000
applying this human rights-based approach to conservation

155
0:08:21.588,000 --> 0:08:24,000
to all kinds of fisheries, from mud crabs to mackerel.

156
0:08:25.17,000 --> 0:08:29,000
The model has crossed borders through East Africa and the Indian Ocean

157
0:08:29.794,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and is now island-hopping into Southeast Asia.

158
0:08:32.326,000 --> 0:08:36,000
From Tanzania to Timor-Leste, from India to Indonesia,

159
0:08:37.094,000 --> 0:08:39,000
we're seeing the same story unfold:

160
0:08:40.502,000 --> 0:08:42,000
that when we design it right,

161
0:08:42.558,000 --> 0:08:46,000
marine conservation reaps dividends that go far beyond protecting nature,

162
0:08:47.273,000 --> 0:08:48,000
improving catches

163
0:08:48.814,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and driving waves of social change along entire coastlines,

164
0:08:52.712,000 --> 0:08:55,000
strengthening confidence, cooperation

165
0:08:55.821,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and the resilience of communities to face the injustice of poverty

166
0:09:00.067,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and climate change.

167
0:09:02.543,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I've been privileged to spend my career

168
0:09:05.625,000 --> 0:09:09,000
catalyzing and connecting these movements throughout the tropics,

169
0:09:10.548,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and I've learned that as conservationists,

170
0:09:12.628,000 --> 0:09:14,000
our goal must be to win at scale,

171
0:09:15.365,000 --> 0:09:17,000
not just to lose more slowly.

172
0:09:18.143,000 --> 0:09:21,000
We need to step up to this global opportunity

173
0:09:21.324,000 --> 0:09:22,000
to rebuild fisheries:

174
0:09:23.294,000 --> 0:09:25,000
with field workers to stand with communities

175
0:09:26.303,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and connect them, to support them to act and learn from one another;

176
0:09:30.639,000 --> 0:09:33,000
with governments and lawyers standing with communities

177
0:09:33.791,000 --> 0:09:35,000
to secure their rights to manage their fisheries;

178
0:09:36.726,000 --> 0:09:39,000
prioritizing local food and job security

179
0:09:40.242,000 --> 0:09:43,000
above all competing interests in the ocean economy;

180
0:09:43.892,000 --> 0:09:47,000
ending subsidies for grotesquely overcapitalized industrial fleets

181
0:09:48.536,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and keeping those industrial and foreign vessels

182
0:09:51.441,000 --> 0:09:53,000
out of coastal waters.

183
0:09:53.656,000 --> 0:09:54,000
We need agile data systems

184
0:09:55.442,000 --> 0:09:57,000
that put science in the hands of communities

185
0:09:58.322,000 --> 0:10:02,000
to optimize conservation to the target species or habitat.

186
0:10:03.204,000 --> 0:10:07,000
We need development agencies, donors and the conservation establishment

187
0:10:07.76,000 --> 0:10:1,000
to raise their ambition to the scale of investment

188
0:10:11.188,000 --> 0:10:14,000
urgently required to deliver this vision.

189
0:10:14.991,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And to get there,

190
0:10:16.349,000 --> 0:10:19,000
we all need to reimagine marine conservation

191
0:10:19.506,000 --> 0:10:22,000
as a narrative of abundance and empowerment,

192
0:10:23.253,000 --> 0:10:25,000
not of austerity and alienation;

193
0:10:25.278,000 --> 0:10:29,000
a movement guided by the people who depend on healthy seas for their survival,

194
0:10:30.221,000 --> 0:10:33,000
not by abstract scientific values.

195
0:10:34.719,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Of course, fixing overfishing is just one step to fixing our oceans.

196
0:10:38.925,000 --> 0:10:43,000
The horrors of warming, acidification and pollution grow each day.

197
0:10:44.544,000 --> 0:10:45,000
But it's a big step.

198
0:10:46.481,000 --> 0:10:48,000
It's one we can take today,

199
0:10:48.734,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and it's one that will give a much-needed boost

200
0:10:51.433,000 --> 0:10:52,000
to those exploring scalable solutions

201
0:10:53.447,000 --> 0:10:55,000
to other dimensions of our ocean emergency.

202
0:10:56.241,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Our success propels theirs.

203
0:10:59.287,000 --> 0:11:01,000
If we throw up our hands in despair,

204
0:11:01.565,000 --> 0:11:02,000
it's game over.

205
0:11:03.11,000 --> 0:11:07,000
We solve these challenges by taking them on one by one.

206
0:11:08.348,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Our overwhelming dependence on our ocean is the solution

207
0:11:12.419,000 --> 0:11:15,000
that has been hiding in plain sight,

208
0:11:15.665,000 --> 0:11:18,000
because there's nothing small about small-scale fishers.

209
0:11:19.339,000 --> 0:11:22,000
They're a hundred million strong and provide nutrition to billions.

210
0:11:23.062,000 --> 0:11:26,000
It's this army of everyday conservationists

211
0:11:26.658,000 --> 0:11:27,000
who have the most at stake.

212
0:11:28.344,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Only they have the knowledge and global reach needed

213
0:11:31.991,000 --> 0:11:34,000
to reshape our relationship with our oceans.

214
0:11:35.98,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Helping them achieve this is the most powerful thing we can do

215
0:11:40.784,000 --> 0:11:42,000
to keep our oceans alive.

216
0:11:42.85,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Thank you.

217
0:11:44.025,000 --> 0:11:48,000
(Applause)

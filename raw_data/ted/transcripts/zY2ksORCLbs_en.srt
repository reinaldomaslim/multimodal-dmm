2
0:00:13.04,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm here to talk about climate change,

3
0:00:14.983,000 --> 0:00:17,000
but I'm not really an environmentalist.

4
0:00:18.563,000 --> 0:00:21,000
In fact, I've never really thought of myself as a nature person.

5
0:00:21.904,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I have never gone camping, never gone hiking,

6
0:00:25.13,000 --> 0:00:26,000
never even owned a pet.

7
0:00:27.546,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I've lived my whole life in cities,

8
0:00:29.323,000 --> 0:00:3,000
actually just one city.

9
0:00:31.046,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And while I like to take trips to visit nature,

10
0:00:33.966,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I always thought it was something that was happening elsewhere,

11
0:00:37.466,000 --> 0:00:38,000
far away,

12
0:00:38.839,000 --> 0:00:42,000
with all of modern life a fortress against its forces.

13
0:00:44.689,000 --> 0:00:45,000
In other words,

14
0:00:45.864,000 --> 0:00:47,000
like just about everybody I knew,

15
0:00:48.618,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I lived my life complacent

16
0:00:51.689,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and deluded

17
0:00:53.174,000 --> 0:00:55,000
about the threat from global warming.

18
0:00:56.099,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Which I took to be happening slowly,

19
0:00:59.329,000 --> 0:01:01,000
happening at a distance

20
0:01:01.472,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and representing only a modest threat to the way that I lived.

21
0:01:07.165,000 --> 0:01:08,000
In each of these ways,

22
0:01:09.006,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I was very, very wrong.

23
0:01:13.379,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Now most people, if they were telling you about climate change,

24
0:01:16.38,000 --> 0:01:17,000
will tell you a story about the future.

25
0:01:18.283,000 --> 0:01:19,000
If I was doing that, I would say,

26
0:01:19.966,000 --> 0:01:21,000
"According to the UN, if we don't change course,

27
0:01:22.351,000 --> 0:01:23,000
by the end of the century,

28
0:01:23.617,000 --> 0:01:25,000
we're likely to get about four degrees Celsius of warming."

29
0:01:26.403,000 --> 0:01:28,000
That would mean, some scientists believe,

30
0:01:29.383,000 --> 0:01:3,000
twice as much war,

31
0:01:31.065,000 --> 0:01:32,000
half as much food,

32
0:01:33.66,000 --> 0:01:38,000
a global GDP possibly 20 percent smaller than it would be without climate change.

33
0:01:39.125,000 --> 0:01:42,000
That's an impact that's deeper than the Great Depression,

34
0:01:42.307,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and it would be permanent.

35
0:01:44.537,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But the impacts are actually happening a lot faster than 2100.

36
0:01:48.332,000 --> 0:01:49,000
By just 2050, it's estimated,

37
0:01:50.325,000 --> 0:01:53,000
many of the biggest cities in South Asia and the Middle East

38
0:01:53.785,000 --> 0:01:56,000
will be almost literally unlivably hot in summer.

39
0:01:57.95,000 --> 0:02:03,000
These are cities that today are home to 10, 12, 15 million people.

40
0:02:04.887,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And in just three decades,

41
0:02:07.134,000 --> 0:02:09,000
you wouldn't be able to walk around outside in them

42
0:02:09.556,000 --> 0:02:11,000
without risking heatstroke or possibly death.

43
0:02:13.088,000 --> 0:02:16,000
The planet is now 1.1 degrees Celsius warmer

44
0:02:16.231,000 --> 0:02:18,000
than it was before industrialization.

45
0:02:18.616,000 --> 0:02:2,000
That may not sound like a lot,

46
0:02:20.775,000 --> 0:02:23,000
but it actually puts us entirely outside the window of temperatures

47
0:02:24.719,000 --> 0:02:26,000
that enclose all of human history.

48
0:02:28.331,000 --> 0:02:32,000
That means that everything we have ever known as a species,

49
0:02:34.109,000 --> 0:02:36,000
the evolution of the human animal,

50
0:02:36.228,000 --> 0:02:38,000
the development of agriculture,

51
0:02:38.3,000 --> 0:02:4,000
the development of rudimentary civilization

52
0:02:40.356,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and modern civilization and industrial civilization,

53
0:02:43.387,000 --> 0:02:47,000
everything we know about ourselves as biological creatures,

54
0:02:47.895,000 --> 0:02:5,000
as social creatures, as political creatures,

55
0:02:51.061,000 --> 0:02:53,000
all of it is the result of climate conditions

56
0:02:53.752,000 --> 0:02:55,000
we have already left behind.

57
0:02:57.752,000 --> 0:03:01,000
It's like we've landed on an entirely different planet,

58
0:03:02.355,000 --> 0:03:04,000
with an entirely different climate.

59
0:03:04.72,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And we now have to figure out

60
0:03:06.356,000 --> 0:03:09,000
what of the civilization that we've brought with us

61
0:03:09.434,000 --> 0:03:11,000
can endure these new conditions

62
0:03:12.395,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and what can't.

63
0:03:14.947,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And things will get worse from here.

64
0:03:17.812,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Now for a very long time,

65
0:03:19.884,000 --> 0:03:22,000
we were told that climate change was a slow saga.

66
0:03:23.455,000 --> 0:03:25,000
It started with the industrial revolution,

67
0:03:25.744,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and it had fallen to us

68
0:03:27.339,000 --> 0:03:29,000
to clean up the mess left by our grandparents

69
0:03:29.474,000 --> 0:03:31,000
so our grandchildren wouldn't be dealing with the results.

70
0:03:32.22,000 --> 0:03:33,000
It was a story of centuries.

71
0:03:35.173,000 --> 0:03:37,000
In fact, half of all of the emissions

72
0:03:37.967,000 --> 0:03:4,000
that have ever been produced from the burning of fossil fuels

73
0:03:41.189,000 --> 0:03:43,000
in the entire history of humanity

74
0:03:43.648,000 --> 0:03:46,000
have been produced in just the last 30 years.

75
0:03:47.942,000 --> 0:03:5,000
That's since Al Gore published his first book on warming.

76
0:03:51.506,000 --> 0:03:54,000
It's since the UN established its IPCC climate change body.

77
0:03:55.363,000 --> 0:03:57,000
We've done more damage since then

78
0:03:58.125,000 --> 0:04:01,000
than in all the centuries, all the millennia before.

79
0:04:02.355,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Now I'm 37 years old,

80
0:04:04.355,000 --> 0:04:07,000
which means my life contains this entire story.

81
0:04:07.863,000 --> 0:04:11,000
When I was born, the planet's climate seemed stable.

82
0:04:13.447,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Today,

83
0:04:15.344,000 --> 0:04:17,000
we are on the brink of catastrophe.

84
0:04:19.209,000 --> 0:04:22,000
The climate crisis is not the legacy of our ancestors.

85
0:04:23.387,000 --> 0:04:26,000
It is the work of a single generation.

86
0:04:27.609,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Ours.

87
0:04:29.339,000 --> 0:04:31,000
This may all sound like bad news.

88
0:04:31.723,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Which it is, really bad news.

89
0:04:33.667,000 --> 0:04:35,000
But it also contains, I think,

90
0:04:36.072,000 --> 0:04:39,000
some good news, at least relatively speaking.

91
0:04:39.429,000 --> 0:04:41,000
These impacts are terrifyingly large.

92
0:04:42.322,000 --> 0:04:45,000
But they are also, I think, exhilarating.

93
0:04:47.268,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Because they are ultimately a reflection

94
0:04:49.784,000 --> 0:04:52,000
of how much power we have over the climate.

95
0:04:53.807,000 --> 0:04:55,000
If we get to those hellish scenarios,

96
0:04:56.284,000 --> 0:04:58,000
it will be because we have made them happen,

97
0:04:58.895,000 --> 0:05:,000
because we have chosen to make them happen.

98
0:05:02.657,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Which means we can choose to make other scenarios happen, too.

99
0:05:08.56,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Now that may seem too rosy to believe

100
0:05:10.846,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and the political obstacles are in fact enormous.

101
0:05:15.02,000 --> 0:05:16,000
But it is a simple fact --

102
0:05:16.295,000 --> 0:05:18,000
the main driver of global warming is human action:

103
0:05:18.653,000 --> 0:05:2,000
How much carbon we put into the atmosphere.

104
0:05:20.728,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Our hands are on those levers.

105
0:05:23.046,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And we can write the story of the planet's climate future ourselves.

106
0:05:27.929,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Not just can -- but are.

107
0:05:30.691,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Since inaction is a kind of action,

108
0:05:33.738,000 --> 0:05:36,000
we'll be writing that story ourselves whether we like it or not.

109
0:05:39.07,000 --> 0:05:4,000
This is not just any story,

110
0:05:41.466,000 --> 0:05:44,000
all of us holding the future of the planet in our hands.

111
0:05:45.57,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It's the kind of story we used to recognize only in mythology

112
0:05:50.453,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and theology.

113
0:05:51.982,000 --> 0:05:52,000
A single generation

114
0:05:53.387,000 --> 0:05:55,000
that has brought the future of humanity into doubt

115
0:05:56.243,000 --> 0:05:59,000
now tasked with securing a new future.

116
0:06:01.657,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So what would that look like?

117
0:06:03.791,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It could mean solar arrays barnacling the planet,

118
0:06:08.033,000 --> 0:06:09,000
really everywhere you looked.

119
0:06:10.105,000 --> 0:06:12,000
It could mean if we developed better technology,

120
0:06:13.001,000 --> 0:06:15,000
we wouldn't even need to deploy them that broadly,

121
0:06:15.787,000 --> 0:06:18,000
because it's been estimated that just a sliver of the Sahara desert

122
0:06:19.23,000 --> 0:06:22,000
absorbs enough solar power to provide all the world's energy needs.

123
0:06:23.04,000 --> 0:06:25,000
But we'd probably need a new electric grid,

124
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
one that doesn't lose two-thirds of its power to waste heat,

125
0:06:29.008,000 --> 0:06:31,000
as is today the case in the US.

126
0:06:31.482,000 --> 0:06:33,000
We could use some more nuclear power, perhaps,

127
0:06:34.323,000 --> 0:06:37,000
although it would have to be an entirely different kind of nuclear power,

128
0:06:37.792,000 --> 0:06:39,000
because today's technology simply isn't cost-competitive

129
0:06:40.458,000 --> 0:06:43,000
with renewable energy whose costs are falling so rapidly.

130
0:06:44.402,000 --> 0:06:45,000
We'd need a new kind of plane,

131
0:06:46.315,000 --> 0:06:48,000
because I don't think it's particularly practical

132
0:06:48.981,000 --> 0:06:5,000
to ask the entire world to give up on air travel,

133
0:06:51.314,000 --> 0:06:52,000
especially as so much of the global South

134
0:06:53.298,000 --> 0:06:55,000
is, for the very first time, able to afford it.

135
0:06:56.558,000 --> 0:06:58,000
We need planes that won't produce carbon.

136
0:06:58.852,000 --> 0:07:,000
We need a new kind of agriculture.

137
0:07:01.233,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Because we probably can't ask people to entirely give up on meat and go vegan,

138
0:07:05.027,000 --> 0:07:06,000
it would mean a new way of raising beef.

139
0:07:06.974,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Or perhaps an old way,

140
0:07:08.791,000 --> 0:07:11,000
since we already know that traditional pasturing practices

141
0:07:12.101,000 --> 0:07:13,000
can turn cattle farms

142
0:07:14.01,000 --> 0:07:17,000
from what are called carbon sources, which produce CO2,

143
0:07:17.181,000 --> 0:07:19,000
into carbon sinks, which absorb them.

144
0:07:19.658,000 --> 0:07:2,000
If you prefer a techno solution,

145
0:07:21.214,000 --> 0:07:23,000
maybe we can grow some of that mean in the lab.

146
0:07:23.761,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Probably, we could also feed some real cattle seaweed,

147
0:07:26.373,000 --> 0:07:3,000
because that cuts their methane emissions by as much as 95 or 99 percent.

148
0:07:31.841,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Probably, we'd have to do all of these things,

149
0:07:34.044,000 --> 0:07:36,000
because as with every aspect of this puzzle,

150
0:07:36.801,000 --> 0:07:38,000
the problem is simply too vast and complicated

151
0:07:39.817,000 --> 0:07:42,000
to solve in any single silver-bullet way.

152
0:07:44.212,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And no matter how many solutions we deploy,

153
0:07:46.918,000 --> 0:07:49,000
we probably won't be able to decarbonize in time.

154
0:07:50.743,000 --> 0:07:51,000
That's the terrifying math that we face.

155
0:07:53.538,000 --> 0:07:56,000
We won't be able to beat climate change,

156
0:07:56.887,000 --> 0:07:58,000
only live with it and limit it.

157
0:07:59.776,000 --> 0:08:,000
And that means we'd probably need

158
0:08:01.403,000 --> 0:08:03,000
some amount of what are called negative emissions,

159
0:08:03.768,000 --> 0:08:05,000
which take carbon out of the atmosphere as well.

160
0:08:06.538,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Billions of new trees, maybe trillions of new trees.

161
0:08:10.385,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And whole plantations of carbon-capture machines.

162
0:08:13.845,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Perhaps an industry twice or four times the size

163
0:08:17.1,000 --> 0:08:19,000
of today's oil and gas business

164
0:08:19.305,000 --> 0:08:23,000
to undo the damage that was done by those businesses in past decades.

165
0:08:24.202,000 --> 0:08:26,000
We would need a new kind of infrastructure,

166
0:08:26.908,000 --> 0:08:28,000
poured by a different kind of cement,

167
0:08:29.064,000 --> 0:08:3,000
because today, if cement were a country,

168
0:08:31.006,000 --> 0:08:33,000
it would be the world's third biggest emitter.

169
0:08:33.919,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And China is pouring as much cement every three years

170
0:08:36.903,000 --> 0:08:39,000
as the US poured in the entire 20th century.

171
0:08:40.349,000 --> 0:08:42,000
We would need to build seawalls and levees

172
0:08:42.999,000 --> 0:08:44,000
to protect those people living on the coast,

173
0:08:45.976,000 --> 0:08:47,000
many of whom are too poor to build them today,

174
0:08:48.522,000 --> 0:08:54,000
which is why it must mean an end to a narrowly nationalistic geopolitics

175
0:08:55.14,000 --> 0:08:58,000
that allows us to define the suffering of those living elsewhere in the world

176
0:08:59.046,000 --> 0:09:,000
as insignificant,

177
0:09:00.22,000 --> 0:09:01,000
when we even acknowledge it.

178
0:09:02.157,000 --> 0:09:04,000
This better future won't be easy.

179
0:09:05.472,000 --> 0:09:07,000
But the only obstacles are human ones.

180
0:09:08.789,000 --> 0:09:09,000
That may not be much of a comfort,

181
0:09:10.599,000 --> 0:09:13,000
if you know what I know about human brutality and indifference,

182
0:09:13.76,000 --> 0:09:15,000
but I promise you, it is better than the alternative.

183
0:09:16.577,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Science isn't stopping us from taking action,

184
0:09:18.924,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and neither is technology.

185
0:09:21.593,000 --> 0:09:24,000
We have the tools we need today to begin.

186
0:09:25.585,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Of course, we also have the tools we need to end global poverty,

187
0:09:29.149,000 --> 0:09:3,000
epidemic disease

188
0:09:30.655,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and the abuse of women as well.

189
0:09:33.093,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Which is why more than new tools, we need a new politics,

190
0:09:37.538,000 --> 0:09:4,000
a way of overcoming all those human obstacles --

191
0:09:40.927,000 --> 0:09:41,000
our culture, our economics,

192
0:09:42.879,000 --> 0:09:43,000
our status quo bias,

193
0:09:44.339,000 --> 0:09:47,000
our disinterest in taking seriously anything that really scares us.

194
0:09:48.149,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Our shortsightedness.

195
0:09:49.855,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Our sense of self-interest.

196
0:09:51.974,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And the selfishness of the world's rich and powerful

197
0:09:55.347,000 --> 0:09:57,000
who have the least incentive to change anything.

198
0:09:58.717,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Now, they will suffer too,

199
0:10:01.392,000 --> 0:10:03,000
but not as much as those with the least,

200
0:10:04.177,000 --> 0:10:06,000
who have done the least to produce warming

201
0:10:06.931,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and have benefited the least

202
0:10:08.61,000 --> 0:10:11,000
from the processes that have brought us to this crisis point

203
0:10:11.784,000 --> 0:10:13,000
but will be burdened most in the decades ahead.

204
0:10:15.077,000 --> 0:10:16,000
A new politics

205
0:10:16.434,000 --> 0:10:18,000
would make the matter of managing that burden,

206
0:10:19.768,000 --> 0:10:21,000
where it falls and how heavily,

207
0:10:22.372,000 --> 0:10:24,000
the top priority of our time.

208
0:10:26.768,000 --> 0:10:3,000
No matter what we do, climate change will transform modern life.

209
0:10:33.776,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Some amount of warming is already baked in and is inevitable,

210
0:10:37.673,000 --> 0:10:4,000
which means probably some amount of additional suffering is, too.

211
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And even if we take dramatic action

212
0:10:43.331,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and avoid some of these truly terrifying worst-case scenarios,

213
0:10:46.72,000 --> 0:10:49,000
it would mean living on an entirely different planet.

214
0:10:51.193,000 --> 0:10:53,000
With a new politics, a new economics,

215
0:10:54.186,000 --> 0:10:56,000
a new relationship to technology

216
0:10:56.4,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and a new relationship to nature --

217
0:10:58.733,000 --> 0:11:,000
a whole new world.

218
0:11:02.336,000 --> 0:11:03,000
But a relatively livable one.

219
0:11:05.074,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Relatively prosperous.

220
0:11:07.987,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And green.

221
0:11:10.392,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Why not choose that one?

222
0:11:13.929,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Thank you.

223
0:11:15.103,000 --> 0:11:19,000
(Applause)

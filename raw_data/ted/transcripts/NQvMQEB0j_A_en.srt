1
0:00:26.388,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I bet you're worried.

2
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I was worried.

4
0:00:32.157,000 --> 0:00:33,000
That's why I began this piece.

5
0:00:33.853,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I was worried about vaginas.

6
0:00:37.765,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I was worried what we think about vaginas

7
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and even more worried that we don't think about them.

8
0:00:43.654,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I was worried about my own vagina.

9
0:00:45.853,000 --> 0:00:49,000
It needed a context, a culture, a community of other vaginas.

10
0:00:51.015,000 --> 0:00:54,000
There is so much darkness and secrecy surrounding them.

11
0:00:54.744,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Like the Bermuda Triangle, nobody ever reports back from there.

12
0:00:59.416,000 --> 0:01:,000
(Laughter)

13
0:01:00.542,000 --> 0:01:03,000
In the first place, it's not so easy to even find your vagina.

14
0:01:04.66,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Women go days, weeks, months, without looking at it.

15
0:01:08.136,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I interviewed a high-powered businesswoman;

16
0:01:10.485,000 --> 0:01:12,000
she told me she didn't have time.

17
0:01:13.001,000 --> 0:01:15,000
"Looking at your vagina," she said, "is a full day's work."

18
0:01:15.879,000 --> 0:01:16,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:2,000
"You've got to get down there on your back, in front of a mirror,

20
0:01:20.12,000 --> 0:01:21,000
full-length preferred.

21
0:01:21.443,000 --> 0:01:24,000
You've got to get in the perfect position with the perfect light,

22
0:01:24.569,000 --> 0:01:26,000
which then becomes shadowed by the angle you're at.

23
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:3,000
You're twisting your head up, arching your back, it's exhausting."

24
0:01:30.235,000 --> 0:01:32,000
She was busy; she didn't have time.

25
0:01:32.878,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So I decided to talk to women about their vaginas.

26
0:01:36.068,000 --> 0:01:38,000
They began as casual vagina interviews,

27
0:01:39.06,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and they turned into vagina monologues.

28
0:01:41.764,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I talked with over 200 women.

29
0:01:44.008,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I talked to older women, younger women,

30
0:01:46.433,000 --> 0:01:48,000
married women, lesbians, single women.

31
0:01:49.163,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I talked to corporate professionals, college professors, actors, sex workers.

32
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I talked to African-American women, Asian-American women,

33
0:01:57.531,000 --> 0:02:,000
Native-American women, Caucasian women, Jewish women.

34
0:02:01.762,000 --> 0:02:05,000
OK, at first women were a little shy, a little reluctant to talk.

35
0:02:07.052,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Once they got going, you couldn't stop them.

36
0:02:10.192,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Women love to talk about their vaginas, they do.

37
0:02:14.121,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Mainly because no one's ever asked them before.

38
0:02:16.584,000 --> 0:02:17,000
(Laughter)

39
0:02:17.678,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Let's just start with the word "vagina" -- vagina, vagina.

40
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:25,000
It sounds like an infection, at best.

41
0:02:25.88,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Maybe a medical instrument.

42
0:02:27.6,000 --> 0:02:28,000
"Hurry, nurse, bring the vagina!"

43
0:02:29.384,000 --> 0:02:3,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:30.469,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Vagina, vagina, vagina.

45
0:02:32.064,000 --> 0:02:34,000
It doesn't matter how many times you say the word,

46
0:02:34.627,000 --> 0:02:36,000
it never sounds like a word you want to say.

47
0:02:37.307,000 --> 0:02:41,000
It's a completely ridiculous, totally un-sexy word.

48
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:45,000
If you use it during sex, trying to be politically correct,

49
0:02:45.095,000 --> 0:02:48,000
"Darling, would you stroke my vagina,"

50
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
you kill the act right there.

51
0:02:50.447,000 --> 0:02:51,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:52.141,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I'm worried what we call them and don't call them.

53
0:02:55.817,000 --> 0:02:57,000
In Great Neck, New York, they call it a Pussycat.

54
0:02:58.575,000 --> 0:03:,000
A woman told me there her mother used to tell her,

55
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:03,000
"Don't wear panties, dear, underneath your pajamas.

56
0:03:03.432,000 --> 0:03:04,000
You need to air out your Pussycat."

57
0:03:05.242,000 --> 0:03:08,000
(Laughter)

58
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:11,000
In Westchester, they call it a Pooki,

59
0:03:11.714,000 --> 0:03:12,000
in New Jersey, a twat.

60
0:03:13.878,000 --> 0:03:17,000
There's Powderbox, derriere, a Pooky, a Poochi, a Poopi,

61
0:03:18.212,000 --> 0:03:22,000
a Poopelu, a Pooninana, a Padepachetchki, a Pal, and a Piche.

62
0:03:22.711,000 --> 0:03:23,000
(Laughter)

63
0:03:24.187,000 --> 0:03:29,000
There's Toadie, Dee Dee, Nishi, Dignity, Coochi Snorcher,

64
0:03:29.611,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Cooter, Labbe, Gladys Seagelman, VA,

65
0:03:34.481,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Wee wee, Horsespot, Nappy Dugout,

66
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Mongo, Ghoulie, Powderbox, a Mimi in Miami,

67
0:03:45.23,000 --> 0:03:47,000
a Split Knish in Philadelphia ...

68
0:03:47.361,000 --> 0:03:48,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:48.472,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and a Schmende in the Bronx.

70
0:03:50.382,000 --> 0:03:51,000
(Laughter)

71
0:03:51.598,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I am worried about vaginas.

72
0:03:54.638,000 --> 0:03:56,000
This is how the "Vagina Monologues" begins.

73
0:03:57.444,000 --> 0:03:59,000
But it really didn't begin there.

74
0:04:00.074,000 --> 0:04:03,000
It began with a conversation with a woman.

75
0:04:03.723,000 --> 0:04:05,000
We were having a conversation about menopause,

76
0:04:06.236,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and we got onto the subject of her vagina,

77
0:04:08.291,000 --> 0:04:1,000
which you'll do if you're talking about menopause.

78
0:04:10.664,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And she said things that really shocked me about her vagina --

79
0:04:13.626,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that it was dried-up and finished and dead --

80
0:04:15.769,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and I was kind of shocked.

81
0:04:17.046,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So I said to a friend casually,

82
0:04:18.744,000 --> 0:04:2,000
"Well, what do you think about your vagina?"

83
0:04:20.822,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And that woman said something more amazing,

84
0:04:22.864,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and then the next woman said something more amazing,

85
0:04:25.322,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and before I knew it, every woman was telling me

86
0:04:27.59,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I had to talk to somebody about their vagina

87
0:04:29.691,000 --> 0:04:3,000
because they had an amazing story,

88
0:04:31.342,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and I was sucked down the vagina trail.

89
0:04:33.249,000 --> 0:04:34,000
(Laughter)

90
0:04:34.583,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And I really haven't gotten off of it.

91
0:04:37.04,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I think if you had told me when I was younger

92
0:04:39.172,000 --> 0:04:41,000
that I was going to grow up, and be in shoe stores,

93
0:04:41.584,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and people would scream out, "There she is, the Vagina Lady!"

94
0:04:44.474,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I don't know that that would have been my life ambition.

95
0:04:47.135,000 --> 0:04:48,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:48.162,000 --> 0:04:5,000
But I want to talk a little bit about happiness,

97
0:04:50.433,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and the relationship to this whole vagina journey,

98
0:04:52.81,000 --> 0:04:54,000
because it has been an extraordinary journey

99
0:04:54.914,000 --> 0:04:55,000
that began eight years ago.

100
0:04:56.63,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I think before I did the "Vagina Monologues,"

101
0:04:58.92,000 --> 0:05:,000
I didn't really believe in happiness.

102
0:05:01.748,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I thought that only idiots were happy, to be honest.

103
0:05:04.798,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I remember when I started practicing Buddhism 14 years ago,

104
0:05:08.616,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and I was told that the end of this practice was to be happy,

105
0:05:11.843,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I said, "How could you be happy and live in this world of suffering

106
0:05:15.215,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and live in this world of pain?"

107
0:05:17.051,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I mistook happiness for a lot of other things,

108
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:24,000
like numbness or decadence or selfishness.

109
0:05:24.723,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And what happened through the course of the "Vagina Monologues"

110
0:05:27.714,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and this journey is, I think I have come to understand

111
0:05:30.275,000 --> 0:05:32,000
a little bit more about happiness.

112
0:05:32.538,000 --> 0:05:34,000
There are three qualities I want to talk about.

113
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:38,000
One is seeing what's right in front of you,

114
0:05:38.937,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and talking about it, and stating it.

115
0:05:41.419,000 --> 0:05:43,000
I think what I learned from talking about the vagina

116
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and speaking about the vagina, is it was the most obvious thing --

117
0:05:47.167,000 --> 0:05:5,000
it was right in the center of my body and the center of the world --

118
0:05:50.43,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and yet it was the one thing nobody talked about.

119
0:05:53.23,000 --> 0:05:57,000
The second thing is that what talking about the vagina did

120
0:05:57.507,000 --> 0:05:59,000
is it opened this door which allowed me to see

121
0:06:00.442,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that there was a way to serve the world to make it better.

122
0:06:03.487,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And that's where the deepest happiness has actually come from.

123
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And the third principle of happiness, which I've realized recently:

124
0:06:10.731,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Eight years ago, this momentum and this energy, this "V-wave" started --

125
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and I can only describe it as a "V-wave" because, to be honest,

126
0:06:18.254,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I really don't understand it completely; I feel at the service of it.

127
0:06:22,000 --> 0:06:24,000
But this wave started, and if I question the wave,

128
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:28,000
or try to stop the wave or look back at the wave,

129
0:06:28.462,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I often have the experience of whiplash

130
0:06:31,000 --> 0:06:33,000
or the potential of my neck breaking.

131
0:06:33.276,000 --> 0:06:34,000
But if I go with the wave,

132
0:06:34.65,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and I trust the wave and I move with the wave,

133
0:06:37.068,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I go to the next place, and it happens logically and organically and truthfully.

134
0:06:41.599,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And I started this piece, particularly with stories and narratives,

135
0:06:47.325,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and I was talking to one woman and that led to another woman

136
0:06:50.183,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and that led to another woman.

137
0:06:52.025,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And then I wrote those stories down,

138
0:06:53.894,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and I put them out in front of other people.

139
0:06:56.12,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And every single time I did the show at the beginning,

140
0:06:58.716,000 --> 0:07:,000
women would literally line up after the show,

141
0:07:01.418,000 --> 0:07:03,000
because they wanted to tell me their stories.

142
0:07:03.677,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And at first I thought, "Oh great, I'll hear about wonderful orgasms,

143
0:07:07.011,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and great sex lives, and how women love their vaginas."

144
0:07:09.637,000 --> 0:07:12,000
But in fact, that's not what women lined up to tell me.

145
0:07:13.31,000 --> 0:07:16,000
What women lined up to tell me was how they were raped,

146
0:07:16.426,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and how they were battered, and how they were beaten,

147
0:07:18.928,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and how they were gang-raped in parking lots,

148
0:07:21.11,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and how they were incested by their uncles.

149
0:07:23.155,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And I wanted to stop doing the "Vagina Monologues,"

150
0:07:25.877,000 --> 0:07:26,000
because it felt too daunting.

151
0:07:27.306,000 --> 0:07:3,000
I felt like a war photographer who takes pictures of terrible events,

152
0:07:30.797,000 --> 0:07:32,000
but doesn't intervene on their behalf.

153
0:07:33.18,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And so in 1997, I said, "Let's get women together.

154
0:07:37.421,000 --> 0:07:39,000
What could we do with this information

155
0:07:39.621,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that all these women are being violated?"

156
0:07:42.537,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And it turned out, after thinking and investigating,

157
0:07:45.746,000 --> 0:07:48,000
that I discovered -- and the UN has actually said this recently --

158
0:07:49.167,000 --> 0:07:51,000
that one out of every three women on this planet

159
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:54,000
will be beaten or raped in her lifetime.

160
0:07:55.103,000 --> 0:07:56,000
That's essentially a gender;

161
0:07:56.691,000 --> 0:07:59,000
that's essentially the resource of the planet, which is women.

162
0:08:00.11,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So in 1997 we got all these incredible women together and we said,

163
0:08:03.306,000 --> 0:08:07,000
"How can we use the play, this energy, to stop violence against women?"

164
0:08:07.771,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And we put on one event in New York City, in the theater,

165
0:08:10.47,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and all these great actors came -- from Susan Sarandon,

166
0:08:13.085,000 --> 0:08:14,000
to Glenn Close, to Whoopi Goldberg --

167
0:08:14.919,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and we did one performance on one evening,

168
0:08:17.783,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and that catalyzed this wave, this energy.

169
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And within five years,

170
0:08:24.075,000 --> 0:08:26,000
this extraordinary thing began to happen.

171
0:08:26.564,000 --> 0:08:29,000
One woman took that energy and she said, "I want to bring this wave,

172
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:32,000
this energy, to college campuses,"

173
0:08:32.589,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and so she took the play and she said,

174
0:08:34.631,000 --> 0:08:37,000
"Let's use the play and have performances once a year,

175
0:08:37.828,000 --> 0:08:39,000
where we can raise money to stop violence against women

176
0:08:40.441,000 --> 0:08:42,000
in local communities all around the world."

177
0:08:42.675,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And in one year, it went to 50 colleges, and then it expanded.

178
0:08:46.167,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And over the course of the last six years,

179
0:08:48.471,000 --> 0:08:51,000
it's spread and it's spread and it's spread around the world.

180
0:08:52.39,000 --> 0:08:55,000
What I have learned is two things:

181
0:08:56.005,000 --> 0:09:01,000
one, that the epidemic of violence towards women is shocking; it's global;

182
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:04,000
it is so profound and it is so devastating,

183
0:09:04.072,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and it is so in every little pocket of every little crater,

184
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:09,000
of every little society that we don't even recognize it,

185
0:09:09.691,000 --> 0:09:1,000
because it's become ordinary.

186
0:09:11.854,000 --> 0:09:13,000
This journey has taken me to Afghanistan,

187
0:09:14.779,000 --> 0:09:16,000
where I had the extraordinary honor and privilege

188
0:09:17.532,000 --> 0:09:21,000
to go into parts of Afghanistan under the Taliban.

189
0:09:21.881,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I was dressed in a burqa and I went in with an extraordinary group,

190
0:09:25.549,000 --> 0:09:28,000
called the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan.

191
0:09:28.942,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And I saw firsthand how women had been stripped

192
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:36,000
of every single right that was possible to strip women of --

193
0:09:36.189,000 --> 0:09:38,000
from being educated, to being employed,

194
0:09:38.72,000 --> 0:09:4,000
to being actually allowed to eat ice cream.

195
0:09:41.723,000 --> 0:09:42,000
For those of you who don't know,

196
0:09:43.288,000 --> 0:09:45,000
it was illegal to eat ice cream under the Taliban.

197
0:09:45.66,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And I actually saw and met women who had been flogged

198
0:09:49.46,000 --> 0:09:51,000
for being caught eating vanilla ice cream.

199
0:09:51.795,000 --> 0:09:55,000
I was taken to the secret ice cream-eating place in a little town,

200
0:09:56.221,000 --> 0:09:58,000
where we went to a back room, and women were seated

201
0:09:59.088,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and a curtain was pulled around us, and they were served vanilla ice cream.

202
0:10:02.844,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And women lifted their burqas and ate this ice cream.

203
0:10:06.284,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And I don't think I ever understood pleasure until that moment,

204
0:10:09.428,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and how women have found a way to keep their pleasure alive.

205
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:15,000
It has taken me, this journey, to Islamabad,

206
0:10:15.572,000 --> 0:10:18,000
where I have witnessed and met women with their faces melted off.

207
0:10:19.233,000 --> 0:10:22,000
It has taken me to Juarez, Mexico, where I was a week ago,

208
0:10:23.109,000 --> 0:10:25,000
where I have literally been there in parking lots,

209
0:10:25.754,000 --> 0:10:26,000
where bones of women have washed up

210
0:10:27.627,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and been dumped next to Coca-Cola bottles.

211
0:10:31.672,000 --> 0:10:34,000
It has taken me to universities all over this country,

212
0:10:34.699,000 --> 0:10:36,000
where girls are date-raped and drugged.

213
0:10:37.215,000 --> 0:10:4,000
I have seen terrible, terrible, terrible violence.

214
0:10:41.376,000 --> 0:10:44,000
But I have also recognized, in the course of seeing that violence,

215
0:10:45.303,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that being in the face of things and seeing actually what's in front of us

216
0:10:49.945,000 --> 0:10:51,000
is the antidote to depression,

217
0:10:52.805,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and to a feeling that one is worthless and has no value.

218
0:10:56,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Because before the "Vagina Monologues,"

219
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:,000
I will say that 80 percent of my consciousness was closed off

220
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:03,000
to what was really going on in this reality,

221
0:11:03.858,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and that closing-off closed off my vitality and my life energy.

222
0:11:08.707,000 --> 0:11:1,000
What has also happened is in the course of these travels --

223
0:11:11.541,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and it's been an extraordinary thing --

224
0:11:14.097,000 --> 0:11:16,000
is that every single place that I have gone to in the world,

225
0:11:17.011,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I have met a new species.

226
0:11:18.447,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And I really love hearing about all these species at the bottom of the sea.

227
0:11:22.185,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And I was thinking about how being with these extraordinary people

228
0:11:25.568,000 --> 0:11:26,000
on this particular panel,

229
0:11:27.226,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that it's beneath, beyond and between,

230
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and the vagina kind of fits into all those categories.

231
0:11:33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
(Laughter)

232
0:11:34.486,000 --> 0:11:36,000
But one of the things I've seen is this species --

233
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and it is a species, and it is a new paradigm,

234
0:11:39.999,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and it doesn't get reported in the press or in the media

235
0:11:42.657,000 --> 0:11:45,000
because I don't think good news ever is news,

236
0:11:45.719,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and I don't think people who are transforming the planet

237
0:11:48.386,000 --> 0:11:5,000
are what gets the ratings on TV shows.

238
0:11:51.291,000 --> 0:11:53,000
But every single country I have been to --

239
0:11:53.339,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and in the last six years, I've been to about 45 countries,

240
0:11:56.268,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and many tiny little villages and cities and towns --

241
0:11:59.346,000 --> 0:12:02,000
I have seen something what I've come to call "vagina warriors."

242
0:12:03.118,000 --> 0:12:07,000
A "vagina warrior" is a woman, or a vagina-friendly man,

243
0:12:07.317,000 --> 0:12:1,000
who has witnessed incredible violence or suffered it,

244
0:12:10.935,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and rather than getting an AK-47 or a weapon of mass destruction

245
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:17,000
or a machete,

246
0:12:17.794,000 --> 0:12:19,000
they hold the violence in their bodies;

247
0:12:20.555,000 --> 0:12:24,000
they grieve it; they experience it; and then they go out

248
0:12:24.683,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and devote their lives to making sure it doesn't happen to anybody else.

249
0:12:28.94,000 --> 0:12:3,000
I have met these women everywhere on the planet,

250
0:12:31.684,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and I want to tell a few stories,

251
0:12:33.47,000 --> 0:12:36,000
because I believe that stories are the way that we transmit information,

252
0:12:37,000 --> 0:12:39,000
where it goes into our bodies.

253
0:12:39.217,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And I think one of the things about being at TED that's been very interesting

254
0:12:43.208,000 --> 0:12:44,000
is that I live in my body a lot,

255
0:12:45.142,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and I don't live in my head very much anymore.

256
0:12:47.408,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And this is a very heady place.

257
0:12:49.241,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And it's been really interesting to be in my head

258
0:12:51.711,000 --> 0:12:53,000
for the last two days; I've been very disoriented --

259
0:12:54.453,000 --> 0:12:55,000
(Laughter)

260
0:12:55.478,000 --> 0:12:58,000
because I think the world, the V-world, is very much in your body.

261
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:02,000
It's a body world, and the species really exists in the body.

262
0:13:02.852,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And I think there's a real significance in us attaching our bodies to our heads,

263
0:13:07.185,000 --> 0:13:1,000
that that separation has created a divide

264
0:13:10.315,000 --> 0:13:13,000
that is often separating purpose from intent.

265
0:13:13.845,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And the connection between body and head

266
0:13:17.015,000 --> 0:13:19,000
often brings those things into union.

267
0:13:19.735,000 --> 0:13:22,000
I want to talk about three particular people that I've met,

268
0:13:22.806,000 --> 0:13:25,000
vagina warriors, who really transformed my understanding

269
0:13:26.379,000 --> 0:13:27,000
of this whole principle and species,

270
0:13:28.363,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and one is a woman named Marsha Lopez.

271
0:13:31.251,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Marsha Lopez was a woman I met in Guatemala.

272
0:13:34.336,000 --> 0:13:37,000
She was 14 years old, and she was in a marriage

273
0:13:37.388,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and her husband was beating her on a regular basis.

274
0:13:40.412,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And she couldn't get out,

275
0:13:41.905,000 --> 0:13:43,000
because she was addicted to the relationship,

276
0:13:44.047,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and she had no money.

277
0:13:45.349,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Her sister was younger than her, and she applied --

278
0:13:47.842,000 --> 0:13:51,000
we had a "Stop Rape" contest a few years ago in New York --

279
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and she applied, hoping that she would become a finalist

280
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and she could bring her sister.

281
0:13:56.866,000 --> 0:14:,000
She did become a finalist; she brought Marsha to New York.

282
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And at that time,

283
0:14:02.269,000 --> 0:14:04,000
we did this extraordinary V-Day at Madison Square Garden,

284
0:14:04.984,000 --> 0:14:07,000
where we sold out the entire testosterone-filled dome --

285
0:14:08.069,000 --> 0:14:11,000
18,000 people standing up to say "Yes" to vaginas,

286
0:14:11.68,000 --> 0:14:13,000
which was really a pretty incredible transformation.

287
0:14:14.438,000 --> 0:14:15,000
And she came, and she witnessed this,

288
0:14:16.281,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and she decided that she would go back and leave her husband,

289
0:14:19.391,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and that she would bring V-Day to Guatemala.

290
0:14:21.478,000 --> 0:14:22,000
She was 21 years old.

291
0:14:23.075,000 --> 0:14:28,000
I went to Guatemala and she had sold out the National Theater of Guatemala.

292
0:14:28.293,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And I watched her walk up on stage in her red short dress and high heels,

293
0:14:32.751,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and she stood there and said, "My name is Marsha.

294
0:14:36.256,000 --> 0:14:39,000
I was beaten by my husband for five years. He almost murdered me.

295
0:14:40.041,000 --> 0:14:42,000
I left and you can, too."

296
0:14:42.556,000 --> 0:14:45,000
And the entire 2,000 people went absolutely crazy.

297
0:14:46.325,000 --> 0:14:49,000
There's a woman named Esther Chávez who I met in Juarez, Mexico.

298
0:14:49.841,000 --> 0:14:52,000
And Esther Chávez was a brilliant accountant in Mexico City.

299
0:14:53.1,000 --> 0:14:56,000
She was 72 years old and she was planning to retire.

300
0:14:56.527,000 --> 0:14:59,000
She went to Juarez to take care of an ailing aunt,

301
0:15:00.125,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and in the course of it, she began to discover what was happening

302
0:15:03.221,000 --> 0:15:06,000
to the murdered and disappeared women of Juarez.

303
0:15:06.614,000 --> 0:15:08,000
She gave up her life; she moved to Juarez.

304
0:15:09.36,000 --> 0:15:13,000
She started to write the stories which documented the disappeared women.

305
0:15:13.477,000 --> 0:15:16,000
300 women have disappeared in a border town because they're brown and poor.

306
0:15:17.116,000 --> 0:15:19,000
There has been no response to the disappearance,

307
0:15:19.402,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and not one person has been held accountable.

308
0:15:21.663,000 --> 0:15:22,000
She began to document it.

309
0:15:23.201,000 --> 0:15:26,000
She opened a center called Casa Amiga, and in six years,

310
0:15:26.804,000 --> 0:15:29,000
she has literally brought this to the consciousness of the world.

311
0:15:30.188,000 --> 0:15:31,000
We were there a week ago,

312
0:15:31.601,000 --> 0:15:34,000
when there were 7,000 people in the street, and it was truly a miracle.

313
0:15:35.311,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And as we walked through the streets,

314
0:15:37.175,000 --> 0:15:4,000
the people of Juarez, who normally don't even come into the streets,

315
0:15:40.41,000 --> 0:15:41,000
because the streets are so dangerous,

316
0:15:42.212,000 --> 0:15:43,000
literally stood there and wept,

317
0:15:43.848,000 --> 0:15:45,000
to see that other people from the world had showed up

318
0:15:46.413,000 --> 0:15:47,000
for that particular community.

319
0:15:48.81,000 --> 0:15:49,000
There's another woman, named Agnes.

320
0:15:50.557,000 --> 0:15:54,000
And Agnes, for me, epitomizes what a vagina warrior is.

321
0:15:55.242,000 --> 0:15:57,000
I met her three years ago in Kenya.

322
0:15:58.016,000 --> 0:16:,000
And Agnes was mutilated as a little girl;

323
0:16:01,000 --> 0:16:05,000
she was circumcised against her will when she was 10 years old,

324
0:16:05.633,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and she really made a decision

325
0:16:07.157,000 --> 0:16:1,000
that she didn't want this practice to continue anymore in her community.

326
0:16:11,000 --> 0:16:14,000
So when she got older, she created this incredible thing:

327
0:16:14.135,000 --> 0:16:19,000
it's an anatomical sculpture of a woman's body, half a woman's body.

328
0:16:19.452,000 --> 0:16:21,000
And she walked through the Rift Valley,

329
0:16:21.604,000 --> 0:16:24,000
and she had vagina and vagina replacement parts,

330
0:16:25,000 --> 0:16:27,000
where she would teach girls and parents and boys and girls

331
0:16:27.853,000 --> 0:16:3,000
what a healthy vagina looks like, and what a mutilated vagina looks like.

332
0:16:31.333,000 --> 0:16:32,000
And in the course of her travel --

333
0:16:33,000 --> 0:16:36,000
she walked literally for eight years through the Rift Valley,

334
0:16:36.063,000 --> 0:16:38,000
through dust, through sleeping on the ground,

335
0:16:38.348,000 --> 0:16:4,000
because the Maasai are nomads,

336
0:16:40.547,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and she would have to find them, and they would move,

337
0:16:44,000 --> 0:16:45,000
and she would find them again --

338
0:16:45.662,000 --> 0:16:47,000
she saved 1,500 girls from being cut.

339
0:16:48.946,000 --> 0:16:5,000
And in that time, she created an alternative ritual,

340
0:16:51.551,000 --> 0:16:54,000
which involved girls coming of age without the cut.

341
0:16:54.9,000 --> 0:16:56,000
When we met her three years ago,

342
0:16:57,000 --> 0:16:58,000
we said, "What could V-Day do for you?"

343
0:16:58.937,000 --> 0:17:01,000
And she said, "Well, if you got me a jeep, I could get around a lot faster."

344
0:17:02.577,000 --> 0:17:03,000
(Laughter)

345
0:17:03.602,000 --> 0:17:04,000
So we bought her a jeep.

346
0:17:04.941,000 --> 0:17:08,000
And in the year that she had the jeep, she saved 4,500 girls from being cut.

347
0:17:09.55,000 --> 0:17:11,000
So we said to her, "What else could we do for you?"

348
0:17:12.036,000 --> 0:17:14,000
She said, "Well, Eve, if you gave me some money,

349
0:17:14.322,000 --> 0:17:16,000
I could open a house and girls could run away,

350
0:17:16.496,000 --> 0:17:17,000
and they could be saved."

351
0:17:18.224,000 --> 0:17:2,000
And I want to tell this little story about my own beginnings,

352
0:17:21.129,000 --> 0:17:25,000
because it's very interrelated to happiness and Agnes.

353
0:17:25.447,000 --> 0:17:28,000
When I was a little girl -- I grew up in a wealthy community;

354
0:17:29.155,000 --> 0:17:32,000
it was an upper-middle class white community,

355
0:17:32.4,000 --> 0:17:34,000
and it had all the trappings and the looks

356
0:17:35.283,000 --> 0:17:38,000
of a perfectly nice, wonderful, great life.

357
0:17:39.259,000 --> 0:17:41,000
And everyone was supposed to be happy in that community,

358
0:17:41.91,000 --> 0:17:42,000
and, in fact, my life was hell.

359
0:17:43.515,000 --> 0:17:44,000
I lived with an alcoholic father

360
0:17:45.072,000 --> 0:17:47,000
who beat me and molested me, and it was all inside that.

361
0:17:48,000 --> 0:17:52,000
And always as a child I had this fantasy that somebody would come and rescue me.

362
0:17:53,000 --> 0:17:56,000
And I actually made up a little character whose name was Mr. Alligator.

363
0:17:56.644,000 --> 0:17:58,000
I would call him up when things got really bad,

364
0:17:59,000 --> 0:18:01,000
and say it was time to come and pick me up.

365
0:18:01.187,000 --> 0:18:04,000
And I would pack a little bag and wait for Mr. Alligator to come.

366
0:18:05,000 --> 0:18:07,000
Now, Mr. Alligator never did come,

367
0:18:07.206,000 --> 0:18:11,000
but the idea of Mr. Alligator coming actually saved my sanity

368
0:18:11.704,000 --> 0:18:12,000
and made it OK for me to keep going,

369
0:18:13.49,000 --> 0:18:14,000
because I believed, in the distance,

370
0:18:15.245,000 --> 0:18:17,000
there would be someone coming to rescue me.

371
0:18:18,000 --> 0:18:2,000
Cut to 40-some odd years later,

372
0:18:20.493,000 --> 0:18:23,000
we go to Kenya, and we're walking,

373
0:18:23.747,000 --> 0:18:25,000
we arrive at the opening of this house.

374
0:18:26.49,000 --> 0:18:28,000
And Agnes hadn't let me come to the house for days,

375
0:18:28.931,000 --> 0:18:3,000
because they were preparing this whole ritual.

376
0:18:31.108,000 --> 0:18:32,000
I want to tell you a great story.

377
0:18:32.722,000 --> 0:18:33,000
When Agnes first started fighting

378
0:18:34.368,000 --> 0:18:36,000
to stop female genital mutilation in her community,

379
0:18:36.893,000 --> 0:18:39,000
she had become an outcast, and she was exiled and slandered,

380
0:18:40.456,000 --> 0:18:42,000
and the whole community turned against her.

381
0:18:42.511,000 --> 0:18:44,000
But being a vagina warrior, she kept going,

382
0:18:44.893,000 --> 0:18:47,000
and she kept committing herself to transforming consciousness.

383
0:18:48.266,000 --> 0:18:49,000
And in the Maasai community,

384
0:18:49.898,000 --> 0:18:51,000
goats and cows are the most valued possession.

385
0:18:52.723,000 --> 0:18:56,000
They're like the Mercedes-Benz of the Rift Valley.

386
0:18:57,000 --> 0:18:59,000
And she said two days before the house opened,

387
0:18:59.91,000 --> 0:19:01,000
two different people arrived to give her a goat each,

388
0:19:02.797,000 --> 0:19:03,000
and she said to me,

389
0:19:03.972,000 --> 0:19:07,000
"I knew then that female genital mutilation would end one day in Africa."

390
0:19:08.786,000 --> 0:19:11,000
Anyway, we arrived, and when we arrived,

391
0:19:12.508,000 --> 0:19:15,000
there were hundreds of girls dressed in red homemade dresses --

392
0:19:16.262,000 --> 0:19:18,000
which is the color of the Maasai and the color of V-Day --

393
0:19:19.196,000 --> 0:19:2,000
and they greeted us.

394
0:19:20.562,000 --> 0:19:22,000
They had made up these songs that they were singing,

395
0:19:23.038,000 --> 0:19:25,000
about the end of suffering and the end of mutilation,

396
0:19:25.615,000 --> 0:19:26,000
and they walked us down the path.

397
0:19:27.334,000 --> 0:19:29,000
It was a gorgeous day in the African sun,

398
0:19:29.723,000 --> 0:19:31,000
and the dust was flying and the girls were dancing,

399
0:19:32.2,000 --> 0:19:36,000
and there was this house, and it said, "V-Day Safe House for the Girls."

400
0:19:36.75,000 --> 0:19:41,000
And it hit me in that moment that it had taken 47 years,

401
0:19:42.076,000 --> 0:19:44,000
but that Mr. Alligator had finally shown up.

402
0:19:45.219,000 --> 0:19:46,000
And he had shown up, obviously,

403
0:19:47.125,000 --> 0:19:5,000
in a form that it took me a long time to understand,

404
0:19:50.545,000 --> 0:19:55,000
which is that when we give in the world what we want the most,

405
0:19:55.675,000 --> 0:19:58,000
we heal the broken part inside each of us.

406
0:19:59.483,000 --> 0:20:01,000
And I feel, in the last eight years,

407
0:20:01.881,000 --> 0:20:04,000
that this journey -- this miraculous vagina journey --

408
0:20:05,000 --> 0:20:07,000
has taught me this really simple thing,

409
0:20:07.826,000 --> 0:20:11,000
which is that happiness exists in action;

410
0:20:12.273,000 --> 0:20:16,000
it exists in telling the truth and saying what your truth is;

411
0:20:16.432,000 --> 0:20:19,000
and it exists in giving away what you want the most.

412
0:20:2,000 --> 0:20:23,000
And I feel that knowledge and that journey

413
0:20:24,000 --> 0:20:26,000
has been an extraordinary privilege,

414
0:20:26.477,000 --> 0:20:27,000
and I feel really blessed

415
0:20:28.095,000 --> 0:20:3,000
to have been here today to communicate that to you.

416
0:20:30.539,000 --> 0:20:31,000
Thank you very much.

417
0:20:31.728,000 --> 0:20:33,000
(Applause)

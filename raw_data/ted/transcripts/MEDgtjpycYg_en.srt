1
0:00:13.441,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Speaking up is hard to do.

2
0:00:16.588,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I understood the true meaning of this phrase exactly one month ago,

3
0:00:21.531,000 --> 0:00:23,000
when my wife and I became new parents.

4
0:00:25.113,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It was an amazing moment.

5
0:00:26.815,000 --> 0:00:28,000
It was exhilarating and elating,

6
0:00:29.024,000 --> 0:00:32,000
but it was also scary and terrifying.

7
0:00:32.369,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And it got particularly terrifying when we got home from the hospital,

8
0:00:36.595,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and we were unsure

9
0:00:38.08,000 --> 0:00:42,000
whether our little baby boy was getting enough nutrients from breastfeeding.

10
0:00:42.616,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And we wanted to call our pediatrician,

11
0:00:45.967,000 --> 0:00:47,000
but we also didn't want to make a bad first impression

12
0:00:48.566,000 --> 0:00:5,000
or come across as a crazy, neurotic parent.

13
0:00:51.054,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So we worried.

14
0:00:52.725,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And we waited.

15
0:00:54.131,000 --> 0:00:56,000
When we got to the doctor's office the next day,

16
0:00:56.45,000 --> 0:01:,000
she immediately gave him formula because he was pretty dehydrated.

17
0:01:01.312,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Our son is fine now,

18
0:01:02.77,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and our doctor has reassured us we can always contact her.

19
0:01:06.106,000 --> 0:01:07,000
But in that moment,

20
0:01:07.656,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I should've spoken up, but I didn't.

21
0:01:10.943,000 --> 0:01:13,000
But sometimes we speak up when we shouldn't,

22
0:01:14.262,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and I learned that over 10 years ago when I let my twin brother down.

23
0:01:18.579,000 --> 0:01:2,000
My twin brother is a documentary filmmaker,

24
0:01:21.245,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and for one of his first films,

25
0:01:22.799,000 --> 0:01:24,000
he got an offer from a distribution company.

26
0:01:25.438,000 --> 0:01:26,000
He was excited,

27
0:01:26.8,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and he was inclined to accept the offer.

28
0:01:29.491,000 --> 0:01:31,000
But as a negotiations researcher,

29
0:01:31.608,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I insisted he make a counteroffer,

30
0:01:34.585,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and I helped him craft the perfect one.

31
0:01:37.839,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And it was perfect --

32
0:01:39.544,000 --> 0:01:41,000
it was perfectly insulting.

33
0:01:42.423,000 --> 0:01:43,000
The company was so offended,

34
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
they literally withdrew the offer

35
0:01:46.233,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and my brother was left with nothing.

36
0:01:48.474,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And I've asked people all over the world about this dilemma of speaking up:

37
0:01:52.358,000 --> 0:01:53,000
when they can assert themselves,

38
0:01:54.216,000 --> 0:01:55,000
when they can push their interests,

39
0:01:55.954,000 --> 0:01:57,000
when they can express an opinion,

40
0:01:58.173,000 --> 0:02:,000
when they can make an ambitious ask.

41
0:02:00.887,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And the range of stories are varied and diverse,

42
0:02:05.144,000 --> 0:02:07,000
but they also make up a universal tapestry.

43
0:02:07.839,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Can I correct my boss when they make a mistake?

44
0:02:10.541,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Can I confront my coworker who keeps stepping on my toes?

45
0:02:14.996,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Can I challenge my friend's insensitive joke?

46
0:02:18.39,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Can I tell the person I love the most my deepest insecurities?

47
0:02:22.963,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And through these experiences, I've come to recognize

48
0:02:25.7,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that each of us have something called a range of acceptable behavior.

49
0:02:29.581,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Now, sometimes we're too strong; we push ourselves too much.

50
0:02:34.856,000 --> 0:02:35,000
That's what happened with my brother.

51
0:02:36.643,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Even making an offer was outside his range of acceptable behavior.

52
0:02:41.663,000 --> 0:02:42,000
But sometimes we're too weak.

53
0:02:43.211,000 --> 0:02:45,000
That's what happened with my wife and I.

54
0:02:45.299,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And this range of acceptable behaviors --

55
0:02:47.539,000 --> 0:02:5,000
when we stay within our range, we're rewarded.

56
0:02:50.658,000 --> 0:02:54,000
When we step outside that range, we get punished in a variety of ways.

57
0:02:54.851,000 --> 0:02:57,000
We get dismissed or demeaned or even ostracized.

58
0:02:58.014,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Or we lose that raise or that promotion or that deal.

59
0:03:01.929,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Now, the first thing we need to know is:

60
0:03:04.717,000 --> 0:03:05,000
What is my range?

61
0:03:06.744,000 --> 0:03:09,000
But the key thing is, our range isn't fixed;

62
0:03:11.265,000 --> 0:03:12,000
it's actually pretty dynamic.

63
0:03:12.705,000 --> 0:03:16,000
It expands and it narrows based on the context.

64
0:03:17.344,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And there's one thing that determines that range more than anything else,

65
0:03:22.038,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and that's your power.

66
0:03:23.355,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Your power determines your range.

67
0:03:25.536,000 --> 0:03:26,000
What is power?

68
0:03:26.997,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Power comes in lots of forms.

69
0:03:28.788,000 --> 0:03:31,000
In negotiations, it comes in the form of alternatives.

70
0:03:31.901,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So my brother had no alternatives;

71
0:03:33.925,000 --> 0:03:34,000
he lacked power.

72
0:03:35.136,000 --> 0:03:36,000
The company had lots of alternatives;

73
0:03:36.98,000 --> 0:03:37,000
they had power.

74
0:03:38.17,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Sometimes it's being new to a country, like an immigrant,

75
0:03:41.254,000 --> 0:03:42,000
or new to an organization

76
0:03:42.737,000 --> 0:03:43,000
or new to an experience,

77
0:03:44.32,000 --> 0:03:46,000
like my wife and I as new parents.

78
0:03:46.449,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Sometimes it's at work,

79
0:03:47.974,000 --> 0:03:49,000
where someone's the boss and someone's the subordinate.

80
0:03:50.609,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Sometimes it's in relationships,

81
0:03:52.317,000 --> 0:03:54,000
where one person's more invested than the other person.

82
0:03:55.322,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And the key thing is that when we have lots of power,

83
0:03:58.861,000 --> 0:03:59,000
our range is very wide.

84
0:04:00.714,000 --> 0:04:02,000
We have a lot of leeway in how to behave.

85
0:04:03.813,000 --> 0:04:05,000
But when we lack power, our range narrows.

86
0:04:06.537,000 --> 0:04:07,000
We have very little leeway.

87
0:04:08.947,000 --> 0:04:1,000
The problem is that when our range narrows,

88
0:04:11.753,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that produces something called the low-power double bind.

89
0:04:16.31,000 --> 0:04:18,000
The low-power double bind happens

90
0:04:19.007,000 --> 0:04:21,000
when, if we don't speak up, we go unnoticed,

91
0:04:22.576,000 --> 0:04:24,000
but if we do speak up, we get punished.

92
0:04:25.359,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Now, many of you have heard the phrase the "double bind"

93
0:04:28.094,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and connected it with one thing, and that's gender.

94
0:04:31.065,000 --> 0:04:35,000
The gender double bind is women who don't speak up go unnoticed,

95
0:04:35.299,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and women who do speak up get punished.

96
0:04:38.127,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And the key thing is that women have the same need as men to speak up,

97
0:04:43.135,000 --> 0:04:44,000
but they have barriers to doing so.

98
0:04:46.004,000 --> 0:04:49,000
But what my research has shown over the last two decades

99
0:04:49.306,000 --> 0:04:52,000
is that what looks like a gender difference

100
0:04:53.035,000 --> 0:04:55,000
is not really a gender double bind,

101
0:04:55.456,000 --> 0:04:57,000
it's a really a low-power double bind.

102
0:04:57.836,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And what looks like a gender difference

103
0:04:59.744,000 --> 0:05:02,000
are really often just power differences in disguise.

104
0:05:03.394,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Oftentimes we see a difference between a man and a woman

105
0:05:06.141,000 --> 0:05:07,000
or men and women,

106
0:05:07.363,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and think, "Biological cause. There's something fundamentally different

107
0:05:10.995,000 --> 0:05:11,000
about the sexes."

108
0:05:12.265,000 --> 0:05:13,000
But in study after study,

109
0:05:14.143,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I've found that a better explanation for many sex differences

110
0:05:18.893,000 --> 0:05:19,000
is really power.

111
0:05:20.429,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And so it's the low-power double bind.

112
0:05:23.975,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And the low-power double bind means that we have a narrow range,

113
0:05:28.815,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and we lack power.

114
0:05:30.669,000 --> 0:05:31,000
We have a narrow range,

115
0:05:31.925,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and our double bind is very large.

116
0:05:34.335,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So we need to find ways to expand our range.

117
0:05:36.715,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And over the last couple decades,

118
0:05:38.316,000 --> 0:05:4,000
my colleagues and I have found two things really matter.

119
0:05:41.887,000 --> 0:05:45,000
The first: you seem powerful in your own eyes.

120
0:05:46.284,000 --> 0:05:49,000
The second: you seem powerful in the eyes of others.

121
0:05:49.629,000 --> 0:05:5,000
When I feel powerful,

122
0:05:52.117,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I feel confident, not fearful;

123
0:05:54.016,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I expand my own range.

124
0:05:55.882,000 --> 0:05:57,000
When other people see me as powerful,

125
0:05:58.614,000 --> 0:06:,000
they grant me a wider range.

126
0:06:01.174,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So we need tools to expand our range of acceptable behavior.

127
0:06:05.952,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And I'm going to give you a set of tools today.

128
0:06:08.367,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Speaking up is risky,

129
0:06:10.503,000 --> 0:06:13,000
but these tools will lower your risk of speaking up.

130
0:06:15.067,000 --> 0:06:2,000
The first tool I'm going to give you got discovered in negotiations

131
0:06:20.925,000 --> 0:06:21,000
in an important finding.

132
0:06:22.329,000 --> 0:06:25,000
On average, women make less ambitious offers

133
0:06:26.249,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and get worse outcomes than men at the bargaining table.

134
0:06:30.2,000 --> 0:06:33,000
But Hannah Riley Bowles and Emily Amanatullah have discovered

135
0:06:33.341,000 --> 0:06:36,000
there's one situation where women get the same outcomes as men

136
0:06:37.043,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and are just as ambitious.

137
0:06:39.196,000 --> 0:06:42,000
That's when they advocate for others.

138
0:06:43.251,000 --> 0:06:45,000
When they advocate for others,

139
0:06:45.412,000 --> 0:06:49,000
they discover their own range and expand it in their own mind.

140
0:06:50.313,000 --> 0:06:51,000
They become more assertive.

141
0:06:51.746,000 --> 0:06:53,000
This is sometimes called "the mama bear effect."

142
0:06:55.483,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Like a mama bear defending her cubs,

143
0:06:57.766,000 --> 0:07:,000
when we advocate for others, we can discover our own voice.

144
0:07:02.328,000 --> 0:07:05,000
But sometimes, we have to advocate for ourselves.

145
0:07:05.469,000 --> 0:07:06,000
How do we do that?

146
0:07:06.833,000 --> 0:07:1,000
One of the most important tools we have to advocate for ourselves

147
0:07:10.862,000 --> 0:07:12,000
is something called perspective-taking.

148
0:07:13.258,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And perspective-taking is really simple:

149
0:07:16.034,000 --> 0:07:2,000
it's simply looking at the world through the eyes of another person.

150
0:07:21.014,000 --> 0:07:24,000
It's one of the most important tools we have to expand our range.

151
0:07:24.826,000 --> 0:07:25,000
When I take your perspective,

152
0:07:26.557,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and I think about what you really want,

153
0:07:29.02,000 --> 0:07:32,000
you're more likely to give me what I really want.

154
0:07:33.461,000 --> 0:07:34,000
But here's the problem:

155
0:07:34.985,000 --> 0:07:36,000
perspective-taking is hard to do.

156
0:07:37.29,000 --> 0:07:38,000
So let's do a little experiment.

157
0:07:38.844,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I want you all to hold your hand just like this:

158
0:07:41.882,000 --> 0:07:42,000
your finger -- put it up.

159
0:07:43.77,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And I want you to draw a capital letter E on your forehead

160
0:07:48.026,000 --> 0:07:49,000
as quickly as possible.

161
0:07:52.066,000 --> 0:07:55,000
OK, it turns out that we can draw this E in one of two ways,

162
0:07:55.407,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and this was originally designed as a test of perspective-taking.

163
0:07:58.916,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I'm going to show you two pictures

164
0:08:00.861,000 --> 0:08:02,000
of someone with an E on their forehead --

165
0:08:02.885,000 --> 0:08:03,000
my former student, Erika Hall.

166
0:08:05.294,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And you can see over here,

167
0:08:07.286,000 --> 0:08:08,000
that's the correct E.

168
0:08:08.577,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I drew the E so it looks like an E to another person.

169
0:08:12.051,000 --> 0:08:14,000
That's the perspective-taking E

170
0:08:14.182,000 --> 0:08:17,000
because it looks like an E from someone else's vantage point.

171
0:08:17.261,000 --> 0:08:2,000
But this E over here is the self-focused E.

172
0:08:20.856,000 --> 0:08:21,000
We often get self-focused.

173
0:08:22.533,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And we particularly get self-focused in a crisis.

174
0:08:26.064,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I want to tell you about a particular crisis.

175
0:08:28.259,000 --> 0:08:31,000
A man walks into a bank in Watsonville, California.

176
0:08:32.285,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And he says, "Give me $2,000,

177
0:08:34.748,000 --> 0:08:36,000
or I'm blowing the whole bank up with a bomb."

178
0:08:37.503,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Now, the bank manager didn't give him the money.

179
0:08:40.052,000 --> 0:08:41,000
She took a step back.

180
0:08:41.873,000 --> 0:08:42,000
She took his perspective,

181
0:08:43.353,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and she noticed something really important.

182
0:08:45.744,000 --> 0:08:47,000
He asked for a specific amount of money.

183
0:08:48.474,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So she said,

184
0:08:50.669,000 --> 0:08:52,000
"Why did you ask for $2,000?"

185
0:08:53.265,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And he said, "My friend is going to be evicted

186
0:08:55.657,000 --> 0:08:57,000
unless I get him $2,000 immediately."

187
0:08:57.944,000 --> 0:09:,000
And she said, "Oh! You don't want to rob the bank --

188
0:09:01.018,000 --> 0:09:02,000
you want to take out a loan."

189
0:09:02.53,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Laughter)

190
0:09:03.639,000 --> 0:09:04,000
"Why don't you come back to my office,

191
0:09:05.536,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and we can have you fill out the paperwork."

192
0:09:07.739,000 --> 0:09:08,000
(Laughter)

193
0:09:09.214,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Now, her quick perspective-taking defused a volatile situation.

194
0:09:14.276,000 --> 0:09:15,000
So when we take someone's perspective,

195
0:09:16.119,000 --> 0:09:2,000
it allows us to be ambitious and assertive, but still be likable.

196
0:09:21.182,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Here's another way to be assertive but still be likable,

197
0:09:24.474,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and that is to signal flexibility.

198
0:09:27.413,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Now, imagine you're a car salesperson, and you want to sell someone a car.

199
0:09:31.79,000 --> 0:09:35,000
You're going to more likely make the sale if you give them two options.

200
0:09:36.141,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Let's say option A:

201
0:09:37.588,000 --> 0:09:4,000
$24,000 for this car and a five-year warranty.

202
0:09:41.084,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Or option B:

203
0:09:42.701,000 --> 0:09:44,000
$23,000 and a three-year warranty.

204
0:09:45.845,000 --> 0:09:48,000
My research shows that when you give people a choice among options,

205
0:09:49.447,000 --> 0:09:5,000
it lowers their defenses,

206
0:09:51.36,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and they're more likely to accept your offer.

207
0:09:54.202,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And this doesn't just work with salespeople;

208
0:09:56.343,000 --> 0:09:57,000
it works with parents.

209
0:09:57.558,000 --> 0:09:58,000
When my niece was four,

210
0:09:58.861,000 --> 0:10:,000
she resisted getting dressed and rejected everything.

211
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
But then my sister-in-law had a brilliant idea.

212
0:10:05.079,000 --> 0:10:07,000
What if I gave my daughter a choice?

213
0:10:07.654,000 --> 0:10:09,000
This shirt or that shirt? OK, that shirt.

214
0:10:09.699,000 --> 0:10:11,000
This pant or that pant? OK, that pant.

215
0:10:11.845,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And it worked brilliantly.

216
0:10:13.207,000 --> 0:10:16,000
She got dressed quickly and without resistance.

217
0:10:17.498,000 --> 0:10:19,000
When I've asked the question around the world

218
0:10:19.809,000 --> 0:10:21,000
when people feel comfortable speaking up,

219
0:10:21.884,000 --> 0:10:22,000
the number one answer is:

220
0:10:23.244,000 --> 0:10:27,000
"When I have social support in my audience; when I have allies."

221
0:10:28.022,000 --> 0:10:31,000
So we want to get allies on our side.

222
0:10:31.957,000 --> 0:10:32,000
How do we do that?

223
0:10:33.841,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Well, one of the ways is be a mama bear.

224
0:10:36.034,000 --> 0:10:37,000
When we advocate for others,

225
0:10:37.534,000 --> 0:10:4,000
we expand our range in our own eyes and the eyes of others,

226
0:10:41.087,000 --> 0:10:43,000
but we also earn strong allies.

227
0:10:43.806,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Another way we can earn strong allies, especially in high places,

228
0:10:48.537,000 --> 0:10:5,000
is by asking other people for advice.

229
0:10:51.41,000 --> 0:10:56,000
When we ask others for advice, they like us because we flatter them,

230
0:10:57.315,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and we're expressing humility.

231
0:10:59.281,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And this really works to solve another double bind.

232
0:11:02.831,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And that's the self-promotion double bind.

233
0:11:05.498,000 --> 0:11:06,000
The self-promotion double bind

234
0:11:07.026,000 --> 0:11:1,000
is that if we don't advertise our accomplishments,

235
0:11:10.205,000 --> 0:11:11,000
no one notices.

236
0:11:11.439,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And if we do, we're not likable.

237
0:11:13.867,000 --> 0:11:16,000
But if we ask for advice about one of our accomplishments,

238
0:11:17.457,000 --> 0:11:21,000
we are able to be competent in their eyes but also be likeable.

239
0:11:22.495,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And this is so powerful

240
0:11:24.526,000 --> 0:11:26,000
it even works when you see it coming.

241
0:11:27.469,000 --> 0:11:31,000
There have been multiple times in life when I have been forewarned

242
0:11:31.533,000 --> 0:11:35,000
that a low-power person has been given the advice to come ask me for advice.

243
0:11:36.289,000 --> 0:11:38,000
I want you to notice three things about this:

244
0:11:38.555,000 --> 0:11:4,000
First, I knew they were going to come ask me for advice.

245
0:11:41.93,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Two, I've actually done research on the strategic benefits

246
0:11:45.956,000 --> 0:11:46,000
of asking for advice.

247
0:11:47.882,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And three, it still worked!

248
0:11:50.656,000 --> 0:11:51,000
I took their perspective,

249
0:11:51.897,000 --> 0:11:53,000
I became more invested in their cause,

250
0:11:54.108,000 --> 0:11:57,000
I became more committed to them because they asked for advice.

251
0:11:58.343,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Now, another time we feel more confident speaking up

252
0:12:01.949,000 --> 0:12:02,000
is when we have expertise.

253
0:12:04.144,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Expertise gives us credibility.

254
0:12:06.862,000 --> 0:12:08,000
When we have high power, we already have credibility.

255
0:12:09.813,000 --> 0:12:1,000
We only need good evidence.

256
0:12:11.777,000 --> 0:12:13,000
When we lack power, we don't have the credibility.

257
0:12:14.771,000 --> 0:12:16,000
We need excellent evidence.

258
0:12:17.394,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And one of the ways we can come across as an expert

259
0:12:21.165,000 --> 0:12:23,000
is by tapping into our passion.

260
0:12:23.784,000 --> 0:12:27,000
I want everyone in the next few days to go up to friend of theirs

261
0:12:27.982,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and just say to them,

262
0:12:29.251,000 --> 0:12:31,000
"I want you to describe a passion of yours to me."

263
0:12:32.738,000 --> 0:12:34,000
I've had people do this all over the world

264
0:12:35.247,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and I asked them,

265
0:12:36.527,000 --> 0:12:38,000
"What did you notice about the other person

266
0:12:38.72,000 --> 0:12:4,000
when they described their passion?"

267
0:12:40.798,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And the answers are always the same.

268
0:12:42.722,000 --> 0:12:44,000
"Their eyes lit up and got big."

269
0:12:44.754,000 --> 0:12:46,000
"They smiled a big beaming smile."

270
0:12:47.727,000 --> 0:12:48,000
"They used their hands all over --

271
0:12:49.395,000 --> 0:12:51,000
I had to duck because their hands were coming at me."

272
0:12:51.911,000 --> 0:12:53,000
"They talk quickly with a little higher pitch."

273
0:12:54.136,000 --> 0:12:54,000
(Laughter)

274
0:12:55.134,000 --> 0:12:57,000
"They leaned in as if telling me a secret."

275
0:12:57.602,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And then I said to them,

276
0:12:58.947,000 --> 0:13:01,000
"What happened to you as you listened to their passion?"

277
0:13:02.374,000 --> 0:13:04,000
They said, "My eyes lit up.

278
0:13:04.678,000 --> 0:13:05,000
I smiled.

279
0:13:05.972,000 --> 0:13:06,000
I leaned in."

280
0:13:07.369,000 --> 0:13:09,000
When we tap into our passion,

281
0:13:09.462,000 --> 0:13:12,000
we give ourselves the courage, in our own eyes, to speak up,

282
0:13:12.852,000 --> 0:13:14,000
but we also get the permission from others to speak up.

283
0:13:16.534,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Tapping into our passion even works when we come across as too weak.

284
0:13:22.533,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Both men and women get punished at work when they shed tears.

285
0:13:27.344,000 --> 0:13:33,000
But Lizzie Wolf has shown that when we frame our strong emotions as passion,

286
0:13:33.786,000 --> 0:13:39,000
the condemnation of our crying disappears for both men and women.

287
0:13:40.598,000 --> 0:13:43,000
I want to end with a few words from my late father

288
0:13:44.09,000 --> 0:13:46,000
that he spoke at my twin brother's wedding.

289
0:13:46.675,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Here's a picture of us.

290
0:13:49.664,000 --> 0:13:51,000
My dad was a psychologist like me,

291
0:13:51.945,000 --> 0:13:54,000
but his real love and his real passion was cinema,

292
0:13:55.691,000 --> 0:13:56,000
like my brother.

293
0:13:56.915,000 --> 0:13:58,000
And so he wrote a speech for my brother's wedding

294
0:13:59.505,000 --> 0:14:02,000
about the roles we play in the human comedy.

295
0:14:02.678,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And he said, "The lighter your touch,

296
0:14:04.991,000 --> 0:14:07,000
the better you become at improving and enriching your performance.

297
0:14:09.17,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Those who embrace their roles and work to improve their performance

298
0:14:14.001,000 --> 0:14:16,000
grow, change and expand the self.

299
0:14:17.067,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Play it well,

300
0:14:18.399,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and your days will be mostly joyful."

301
0:14:20.946,000 --> 0:14:21,000
What my dad was saying

302
0:14:22.595,000 --> 0:14:25,000
is that we've all been assigned ranges and roles in this world.

303
0:14:27.048,000 --> 0:14:3,000
But he was also saying the essence of this talk:

304
0:14:31.005,000 --> 0:14:36,000
those roles and ranges are constantly expanding and evolving.

305
0:14:36.77,000 --> 0:14:37,000
So when a scene calls for it,

306
0:14:39.114,000 --> 0:14:4,000
be a ferocious mama bear

307
0:14:41.251,000 --> 0:14:42,000
and a humble advice seeker.

308
0:14:43.802,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Have excellent evidence and strong allies.

309
0:14:47.91,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Be a passionate perspective taker.

310
0:14:50.77,000 --> 0:14:51,000
And if you use those tools --

311
0:14:52.514,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and each and every one of you can use these tools --

312
0:14:56.104,000 --> 0:14:59,000
you will expand your range of acceptable behavior,

313
0:14:59.994,000 --> 0:15:01,000

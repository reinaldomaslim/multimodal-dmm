0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Hi, my name is Roz Savage

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and I row across oceans.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Four years ago, I rowed solo across the Atlantic,

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and since then, I've done two out of three stages

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
across the Pacific,

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
from San Francisco to Hawaii

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and from Hawaii to Kiribati.

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And tomorrow, I'll be leaving this boat

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
to fly back to Kiribati

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
to continue with the third and final stage

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
of my row across the Pacific.

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Cumulatively, I will have rowed

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
over 8,000 miles,

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
taken over three million oar strokes

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and spent more than 312 days alone

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
on the ocean on a 23 foot rowboat.

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
This has given me a very

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
special relationship with the ocean.

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
We have a bit of a love/hate thing going on.

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I feel a bit about it like I did about

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
a very strict math teacher that I once had at school.

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I didn't always like her, but I did respect her,

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and she taught me a heck of a lot.

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
So today I'd like to share with you

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
some of my ocean adventures

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and tell you a little bit about what they've taught me,

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and how I think we can maybe take some of those lessons

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and apply them to this environmental challenge

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that we face right now.

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Now, some of you might be thinking,

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
"Hold on a minute. She doesn't look very much like an ocean rower.

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Isn't she meant to be about this tall

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and about this wide

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and maybe look a bit more like these guys?"

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
You'll notice, they've all got something that I don't.

36
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Well, I don't know what you're thinking, but I'm talking about the beards. (Laughter)

37
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And no matter how long I've spent on the ocean,

38
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I haven't yet managed to muster a decent beard,

39
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and I hope that it remains that way.

40
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
For a long time, I didn't believe that I could have a big adventure.

41
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
The story that I told myself was

42
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that adventurers looked like this.

43
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I didn't look the part.

44
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I thought there were them and there were us,

45
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and I was not one of them.

46
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So for 11 years, I conformed.

47
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I did what people from my kind of background were supposed to do.

48
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I was working in an office in London

49
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
as a management consultant.

50
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And I think I knew from day one that it wasn't the right job for me.

51
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But that kind of conditioning

52
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
just kept me there for so many years,

53
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
until I reached my mid-30s and I thought,

54
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
"You know, I'm not getting any younger.

55
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I feel like I've got a purpose in this life, and I don't know what it is,

56
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
but I'm pretty certain that management consultancy is not it.

57
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
So, fast forward a few years.

58
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I'd gone through some changes.

59
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
To try and answer that question of,

60
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
"What am I supposed to be doing with my life?"

61
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I sat down one day

62
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and wrote two versions of my own obituary,

63
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
the one that I wanted, a life of adventure,

64
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and the one that I was actually heading for

65
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
which was a nice, normal, pleasant life,

66
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
but it wasn't where I wanted to be by the end of my life.

67
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I wanted to live a life that I could be proud of.

68
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And I remember looking at these two versions of my obituary

69
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and thinking, "Oh boy,

70
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I'm on totally the wrong track here.

71
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
If I carry on living as I am now,

72
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I'm just not going to end up where I want to be

73
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
in five years, or 10 years,

74
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
or at the end of my life."

75
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I made a few changes,

76
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
let go of some loose trappings of my old life,

77
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and through a bit of a leap of logic,

78
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
decided to row across the Atlantic Ocean.

79
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
(Laughter)

80
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
The Atlantic Rowing Race runs from the Canaries to Antigua,

81
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
it's about 3,000 miles,

82
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and it turned out to be

83
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
the hardest thing I had ever done.

84
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Sure, I had wanted to get outside of my comfort zone,

85
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
but what I'd sort of failed to notice was that

86
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
getting out of your comfort zone is, by definition,

87
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
extremely uncomfortable.

88
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And my timing was not great either:

89
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
2005, when I did the Atlantic,

90
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
was the year of Hurricane Katrina.

91
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
There were more tropical storms in the North Atlantic

92
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
than ever before, since records began.

93
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And pretty early on,

94
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
those storms started making their presence known.

95
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
All four of my oars broke

96
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
before I reached halfway across.

97
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Oars are not supposed to look like this.

98
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
But what can you do? You're in the middle of the ocean.

99
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Oars are your only means of propulsion.

100
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So I just had to look around the boat

101
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and figure out what I was going to use

102
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
to fix up these oars so that I could carry on.

103
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So I found a boat hook and my trusty duct tape

104
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and splintered the boat hook

105
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
to the oars to reinforce it.

106
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Then, when that gave out,

107
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I sawed the wheel axles off my spare rowing seat

108
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and used those.

109
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And then when those gave out, I cannibalized one of the broken oars.

110
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I'd never been very good at fixing stuff

111
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
when I was living my old life,

112
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
but it's amazing how resourceful you can become

113
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
when you're in the middle of the ocean

114
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and there's only one way to get to the other side.

115
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And the oars kind of became a symbol

116
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
of just in how many ways

117
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I went beyond what I thought were my limits.

118
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I suffered from tendinitis on my shoulders

119
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and saltwater sores on my bottom.

120
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
I really struggled psychologically,

121
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
totally overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge,

122
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
realizing that, if I carried on moving at two miles an hour,

123
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
3,000 miles was going to

124
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
take me a very, very long time.

125
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
There were so many times

126
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
when I thought I'd hit that limit,

127
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
but had no choice but to just carry on

128
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and try and figure out how I was going to get to the other side

129
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
without driving myself crazy.

130
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And eventually after

131
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
103 days at sea,

132
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I arrived in Antigua.

133
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I don't think I've ever felt so happy

134
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
in my entire life.

135
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
It was a bit like finishing a marathon

136
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and getting out of solitary confinement

137
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and winning an Oscar all rolled into one.

138
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I was euphoric.

139
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And to see all the people coming out to greet me

140
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and standing along the cliff tops and clapping and cheering,

141
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I just felt like a movie star.

142
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It was absolutely wonderful.

143
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And I really learned then that, the bigger the challenge,

144
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
the bigger the sense of achievement

145
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
when you get to the end of it.

146
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So this might be a good moment to take a quick time-out

147
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
to answer a few FAQs about ocean rowing

148
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
that might be going through your mind.

149
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Number one that I get asked: What do you eat?

150
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
A few freeze-dried meals, but mostly I try and eat

151
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
much more unprocessed foods.

152
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So I grow my own beansprouts.

153
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I eat fruits and nut bars,

154
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
a lot of nuts.

155
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And generally arrive about 30 pounds lighter

156
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
at the other end.

157
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Question number two: How do you sleep?

158
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
With my eyes shut. Ha-ha.

159
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I suppose what you mean is:

160
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
What happens to the boat while I'm sleeping?

161
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Well, I plan my route so that I'm drifting

162
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
with the winds and the currents while I'm sleeping.

163
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
On a good night, I think my best ever was 11 miles

164
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
in the right direction.

165
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Worst ever, 13 miles in the wrong direction.

166
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
That's a bad day at the office.

167
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
What do I wear?

168
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Mostly, a baseball cap,

169
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
rowing gloves and a smile -- or a frown,

170
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
depending on whether I went backwards overnight --

171
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and lots of sun lotion.

172
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Do I have a chase boat?

173
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
No I don't. I'm totally self-supporting out there.

174
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I don't see anybody for the whole time

175
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that I'm at sea, generally.

176
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And finally: Am I crazy?

177
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Well, I leave that one up to you to judge.

178
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So, how do you top rowing across the Atlantic?

179
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Well, naturally, you decide to row across the Pacific.

180
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Well, I thought the Atlantic was big,

181
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
but the Pacific is really, really big.

182
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
I think we tend to do it a little bit of a disservice in our usual maps.

183
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I don't know for sure that the Brits

184
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
invented this particular view of the world, but I suspect we might have done so:

185
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
we are right in the middle,

186
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and we've cut the Pacific in half

187
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and flung it to the far corners of the world.

188
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Whereas if you look in Google Earth,

189
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
this is how the Pacific looks.

190
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
It pretty much covers half the planet.

191
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
You can just see a little bit of North America up here

192
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and a sliver of Australia down there.

193
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
It is really big --

194
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
65 million square miles --

195
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and to row in a straight line across it

196
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
would be about 8,000 miles.

197
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Unfortunately, ocean rowboats

198
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
very rarely go in a straight line.

199
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
By the time I get to Australia,

200
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
if I get to Australia,

201
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I will have rowed probably nine or 10,000 miles in all.

202
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So, because nobody in their straight mind would row

203
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
straight past Hawaii without dropping in,

204
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I decided to cut this very big undertaking

205
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
into three segments.

206
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
The first attempt didn't go so well.

207
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
In 2007, I did a rather involuntary capsize drill

208
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
three times in 24 hours.

209
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
A bit like being in a washing machine.

210
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Boat got a bit dinged up,

211
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
so did I.

212
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
I blogged about it. Unfortunately, somebody

213
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
with a bit of a hero complex decided that

214
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
this damsel was in distress and needed saving.

215
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
The first I knew about this was when the Coast Guard plane turned up overhead.

216
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I tried to tell them to go away.

217
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
We had a bit of a battle of wills.

218
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I lost and got airlifted.

219
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Awful, really awful.

220
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
It was one of the worst feelings of my life,

221
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
as I was lifted up on that winch line into the helicopter

222
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and looked down at my trusty little boat

223
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
rolling around in the 20 foot waves

224
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and wondering if I would ever see her again.

225
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So I had to launch a very expensive

226
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
salvage operation

227
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and then wait another nine months

228
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
before I could get back out onto the ocean again.

229
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
But what do you do?

230
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Fall down nine times, get up 10.

231
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
So, the following year, I set out

232
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and, fortunately, this time made it safely across to Hawaii.

233
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
But it was not without misadventure.

234
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
My watermaker broke,

235
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
only the most important piece of kit that I have on the boat.

236
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Powered by my solar panels,

237
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
it sucks in saltwater

238
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and turns it into freshwater.

239
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
But it doesn't react very well to being immersed in ocean,

240
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
which is what happened to it.

241
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Fortunately, help was at hand.

242
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
There was another unusual boat out there

243
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
at the same time, doing as I was doing,

244
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
bringing awareness to the North Pacific Garbage Patch,

245
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
that area in the North Pacific about twice the size of Texas,

246
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
with an estimated 3.5 million

247
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
tons of trash in it,

248
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
circulating at the center of

249
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
that North Pacific Gyre.

250
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
So, to make the point, these guys

251
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
had actually built their boat out of plastic trash,

252
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
15,000 empty water bottles

253
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
latched together into two pontoons.

254
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
They were going very slowly.

255
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Partly, they'd had a bit of a delay.

256
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
They'd had to pull in at Catalina Island shortly after they left Long Beach

257
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
because the lids of all the water bottles were coming undone,

258
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and they were starting to sink.

259
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
So they'd had to pull in and do all the lids up.

260
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
But, as I was approaching the end of my water reserves,

261
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
luckily, our courses were converging.

262
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
They were running out of food; I was running out of water.

263
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So we liaised by satellite phone and arranged to meet up.

264
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And it took about a week

265
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
for us to actually gradually converge.

266
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I was doing a pathetically slow speed

267
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
of about 1.3 knots,

268
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and they were doing only marginally less pathetic speed of about 1.4:

269
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
it was like two snails in a mating dance.

270
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
But, eventually, we did manage to meet up

271
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and Joel hopped overboard,

272
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
caught us a beautiful, big mahi-mahi,

273
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
which was the best food I'd had

274
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
in, ooh, at least three months.

275
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Fortunately, the one that he caught that day

276
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
was better than this one they caught a few weeks earlier.

277
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
When they opened this one up,

278
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
they found its stomach was full of plastic.

279
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And this is really bad news because plastic

280
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
is not an inert substance.

281
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
It leaches out chemicals

282
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
into the flesh of the poor critter that ate it,

283
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and then we come along and eat that poor critter,

284
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and we get some of the toxins accumulating

285
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
in our bodies as well.

286
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
So there are very real implications for human health.

287
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
I eventually made it to Hawaii still alive.

288
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And, the following year, set out

289
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
on the second stage of the Pacific,

290
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
from Hawaii down to Tarawa.

291
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
And you'll notice something about Tarawa;

292
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
it is very low-lying.

293
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
It's that little green sliver on the horizon,

294
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
which makes them very nervous

295
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
about rising oceans.

296
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
This is big trouble for these guys.

297
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
They've got no points of land more than about six feet above sea level.

298
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And also, as an increase in extreme

299
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
weather events due to climate change,

300
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
they're expecting more waves

301
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
to come in over the fringing reef,

302
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
which will contaminate their fresh water supply.

303
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
I had a meeting with the president there,

304
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
who told me about his

305
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
exit strategy for his country.

306
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
He expects that within the next 50 years,

307
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
the 100,000 people that live there

308
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
will have to relocate to

309
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
New Zealand or Australia.

310
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And that made me think about how would I feel

311
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
if Britain was going to disappear under the waves;

312
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
if the places where I'd been born

313
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and gone to school

314
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and got married,

315
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
if all those places were just going to disappear forever.

316
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
How, literally, ungrounded

317
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
that would make me feel.

318
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Very shortly, I'll be setting out to try and get to Australia,

319
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and if I'm successful, I'll be the first woman ever to row solo

320
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
all the way across the Pacific.

321
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And I try to use this to bring awareness to these environmental issues,

322
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
to bring a human face to the ocean.

323
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
If the Atlantic was about my inner journey,

324
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
discovering my own capabilities,

325
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
maybe the Pacific has been about my outer journey,

326
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
figuring out how I can use

327
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
my interesting career choice

328
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
to be of service to the world,

329
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and to take some of those things that I've learned out there

330
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and apply them to the situation

331
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
that humankind now finds itself in.

332
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
I think there are probably three key points here.

333
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
The first one is about

334
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
the stories that we tell ourselves.

335
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
For so long, I told myself

336
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
that I couldn't have an adventure

337
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
because I wasn't six foot tall

338
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and athletic and bearded.

339
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And then that story changed.

340
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
I found out that people had rowed across oceans.

341
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
I even met one of them and she was just about my size.

342
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
So even though I didn't grow any taller,

343
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
I didn't sprout a beard,

344
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
something had changed: My interior dialogue had changed.

345
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
At the moment, the story that we collectively tell ourselves

346
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
is that we need all this stuff,

347
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
that we need oil.

348
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
But what about if we just change that story?

349
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
We do have alternatives,

350
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and we have the power of free will

351
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
to choose those alternatives, those sustainable ones,

352
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
to create a greener future.

353
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
The second point is about

354
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
the accumulation of tiny actions.

355
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
We might think that anything that we do as an individual

356
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
is just a drop in the ocean, that it can't really make a difference.

357
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
But it does. Generally, we haven't

358
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
got ourselves into this mess through big disasters.

359
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Yes, there have been the Exxon Valdezes

360
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and the Chernobyls,

361
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
but mostly it's been an accumulation

362
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
of bad decisions

363
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
by billions of individuals,

364
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
day after day and year after year.

365
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And, by the same token, we can turn that tide.

366
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
We can start making better,

367
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
wiser, more sustainable decisions.

368
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
And when we do that, we're not just one person.

369
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Anything that we do spreads ripples.

370
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Other people will see if you're in the supermarket line

371
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
and you pull out your

372
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
reusable grocery bag.

373
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Maybe if we all start doing this,

374
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
we can make it socially unacceptable

375
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
to say yes to plastic in the checkout line.

376
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
That's just one example.

377
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
This is a world-wide community.

378
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
The other point:

379
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
It's about taking responsibility.

380
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
For so much of my life,

381
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
I wanted something else to make me happy.

382
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
I thought if I had the right house or the right car

383
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
or the right man in my life,

384
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
then I could be happy.

385
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
But when I wrote that obituary exercise,

386
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
I actually grew up a little bit in that moment

387
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
and realized that I needed to create my own future.

388
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
I couldn't just wait passively

389
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
for happiness to come and find me.

390
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
And I suppose I'm a selfish environmentalist.

391
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
I plan on being around for a long time,

392
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and when I'm 90 years old,

393
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
I want to be happy and healthy.

394
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
And it's very difficult to be happy

395
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
on a planet that's racked

396
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
with famine and drought.

397
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
It's very difficult to be healthy on a planet

398
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
where we've poisoned the earth

399
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
and the sea and the air.

400
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
So, shortly, I'm going to be

401
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
launching a new initiative

402
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
called Eco-Heroes.

403
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
And the idea here is that

404
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
all our Eco-Heroes will log at least one green deed every day.

405
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
It's meant to be a bit of a game.

406
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
We're going to make an iPhone app out of it.

407
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
We just want to try and create that awareness

408
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
because, sure, changing a light bulb isn't going to change the world,

409
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
but that attitude,

410
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
that awareness that leads you to change the light bulb

411
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
or take your reusable coffee mug,

412
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
that is what could change the world.

413
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
I really believe that we stand

414
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
at a very important point in history.

415
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
We have a choice. We've been blessed,

416
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
or cursed, with free will.

417
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
We can choose a greener future,

418
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
and we can get there

419
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
if we all pull together to take it one stroke at a time.

420
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
Thank you.

421
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
(Applause)

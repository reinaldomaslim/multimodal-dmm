1
0:00:12.492,000 --> 0:00:15,000
The entire model of capitalism

2
0:00:15.924,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and the economic model that you and I

3
0:00:18.103,000 --> 0:00:19,000
did business in,

4
0:00:19.782,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and, in fact, continue to do business in,

5
0:00:21.609,000 --> 0:00:24,000
was built around what probably Milton Friedman

6
0:00:25.232,000 --> 0:00:26,000
put more succinctly.

7
0:00:26.95,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And Adam Smith, of course, the father of modern economics

8
0:00:29.53,000 --> 0:00:31,000
actually said many, many years ago,

9
0:00:31.879,000 --> 0:00:32,000
the invisible hand,

10
0:00:33.397,000 --> 0:00:34,000
which is, "If you continue to operate

11
0:00:35.053,000 --> 0:00:37,000
in your own self-interest

12
0:00:37.166,000 --> 0:00:39,000
you will do the best good for society."

13
0:00:39.922,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Now, capitalism has done a lot of good things

14
0:00:44.653,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and I've talked about a lot of good things that have happened,

15
0:00:47.455,000 --> 0:00:5,000
but equally, it has not been able to meet up

16
0:00:50.841,000 --> 0:00:51,000
with some of the challenges that we've seen

17
0:00:52.777,000 --> 0:00:53,000
in society.

18
0:00:54.438,000 --> 0:00:56,000
The model that at least I was brought up in

19
0:00:56.652,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and a lot of us doing business were brought up in

20
0:00:58.932,000 --> 0:00:59,000
was one which talked about

21
0:01:00.641,000 --> 0:01:02,000
what I call the three G's of growth:

22
0:01:03.069,000 --> 0:01:04,000
growth that is consistent,

23
0:01:04.658,000 --> 0:01:05,000
quarter on quarter;

24
0:01:06.184,000 --> 0:01:07,000
growth that is competitive,

25
0:01:07.622,000 --> 0:01:08,000
better than the other person;

26
0:01:08.952,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and growth that is profitable,

27
0:01:10.514,000 --> 0:01:11,000
so you continue to make

28
0:01:12.003,000 --> 0:01:14,000
more and more shareholder value.

29
0:01:14.922,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And I'm afraid this is not going to be good enough

30
0:01:17.714,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and we have to move from this 3G model

31
0:01:20.374,000 --> 0:01:22,000
to a model of what I call

32
0:01:22.688,000 --> 0:01:23,000
the fourth G:

33
0:01:24.234,000 --> 0:01:27,000
the G of growth that is responsible.

34
0:01:28.123,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And it is this that has to become

35
0:01:31.56,000 --> 0:01:33,000
a very important part

36
0:01:33.8,000 --> 0:01:34,000
of creating value.

37
0:01:35.675,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Of not just creating economic value

38
0:01:38.4,000 --> 0:01:4,000
but creating social value.

39
0:01:40.854,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And companies that will thrive are those

40
0:01:43.654,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that will actually embrace the fourth G.

41
0:01:47.019,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And the model of 4G is quite simple:

42
0:01:50.044,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Companies cannot afford to be just innocent bystanders

43
0:01:53.816,000 --> 0:01:55,000
in what's happening around in society.

44
0:01:56.151,000 --> 0:01:59,000
They have to begin to play their role

45
0:01:59.718,000 --> 0:02:01,000
in terms of serving the communities

46
0:02:01.878,000 --> 0:02:03,000
which actually sustain them.

47
0:02:03.976,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And we have to move to a model

48
0:02:05.673,000 --> 0:02:07,000
of an and/and model which is

49
0:02:07.766,000 --> 0:02:1,000
how do we make money and do good?

50
0:02:11.248,000 --> 0:02:12,000
How do we make sure

51
0:02:13.056,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that we have a great business

52
0:02:14.636,000 --> 0:02:16,000
but we also have a great environment around us?

53
0:02:17.508,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And that model

54
0:02:18.828,000 --> 0:02:2,000
is all about doing well and doing good.

55
0:02:21.797,000 --> 0:02:23,000
But the question is easier said than done.

56
0:02:24.118,000 --> 0:02:26,000
But how do we actually get that done?

57
0:02:26.255,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And I do believe

58
0:02:27.601,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that the answer to that is going to be leadership.

59
0:02:30.691,000 --> 0:02:31,000
It is going to be to redefine

60
0:02:32.048,000 --> 0:02:33,000
the new business models

61
0:02:33.918,000 --> 0:02:34,000
which understand

62
0:02:35.264,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that the only license to operate

63
0:02:37.269,000 --> 0:02:39,000
is to combine these things.

64
0:02:39.406,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And for that you need businesses

65
0:02:41.338,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that can actually define their role

66
0:02:44.097,000 --> 0:02:46,000
in society

67
0:02:46.182,000 --> 0:02:47,000
in terms of a much larger purpose

68
0:02:47.826,000 --> 0:02:49,000
than the products and brands that they sell.

69
0:02:50.657,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And companies that actually define a true north,

70
0:02:53.89,000 --> 0:02:54,000
things that are nonnegotiable

71
0:02:55.636,000 --> 0:02:57,000
whether times are good, bad, ugly --

72
0:02:58.196,000 --> 0:02:59,000
doesn't matter.

73
0:02:59.463,000 --> 0:03:01,000
There are things that you stand for.

74
0:03:01.629,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Values and purpose are going to be the two

75
0:03:06.121,000 --> 0:03:08,000
drivers of software

76
0:03:08.256,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that are going to create

77
0:03:09.968,000 --> 0:03:11,000
the companies of tomorrow.

78
0:03:12.034,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And I'm going to now shift

79
0:03:13.44,000 --> 0:03:17,000
to talking a little bit about my own experiences.

80
0:03:17.458,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I joined Unilever in 1976

81
0:03:20.338,000 --> 0:03:23,000
as a management trainee in India.

82
0:03:23.471,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And on my first day of work

83
0:03:25.806,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I walked in and my boss tells me,

84
0:03:28.14,000 --> 0:03:3,000
"Do you know why you're here?"

85
0:03:30.247,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I said, "I'm here to sell a lot of soap."

86
0:03:33.544,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And he said, "No, you're here to change lives."

87
0:03:36.63,000 --> 0:03:38,000
You're here to change lives.

88
0:03:38.922,000 --> 0:03:39,000
You know, I thought it was rather facetious.

89
0:03:40.552,000 --> 0:03:42,000
We are a company that sells soap and soup.

90
0:03:43.367,000 --> 0:03:45,000
What are we doing about changing lives?

91
0:03:46.239,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And it's then I realized

92
0:03:50.254,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that simple acts

93
0:03:52.577,000 --> 0:03:54,000
like selling a bar of soap

94
0:03:55.009,000 --> 0:03:56,000
can save more lives

95
0:03:56.498,000 --> 0:03:57,000
than pharmaceutical companies.

96
0:03:57.975,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I don't know how many of you know

97
0:03:59.597,000 --> 0:04:02,000
that five million children don't reach the age of five

98
0:04:02.932,000 --> 0:04:04,000
because of simple infections that can be prevented

99
0:04:05.808,000 --> 0:04:07,000
by an act of washing their hands with soap.

100
0:04:08.748,000 --> 0:04:09,000
We run the largest

101
0:04:10.2,000 --> 0:04:11,000
hand-washing program

102
0:04:11.429,000 --> 0:04:11,000
in the world.

103
0:04:12.334,000 --> 0:04:14,000
We are running a program on hygiene and health

104
0:04:14.495,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that now touches half a billion people.

105
0:04:16.997,000 --> 0:04:17,000
It's not about selling soap,

106
0:04:18.597,000 --> 0:04:19,000
there is a larger purpose out there.

107
0:04:20.558,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And brands indeed can be

108
0:04:22.616,000 --> 0:04:24,000
at the forefront of social change.

109
0:04:24.623,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And the reason for that is,

110
0:04:26.28,000 --> 0:04:28,000
when two billion people use your brands

111
0:04:28.89,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that's the amplifier.

112
0:04:30.542,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Small actions can make a big difference.

113
0:04:33.743,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Take another example,

114
0:04:35.281,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I was walking around in one of our villages in India.

115
0:04:38.551,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Now those of you who have done this

116
0:04:40.194,000 --> 0:04:45,000
will realize that this is no walk in the park.

117
0:04:45.368,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And we had this lady

118
0:04:47.943,000 --> 0:04:51,000
who was one of our small distributors --

119
0:04:52.083,000 --> 0:04:55,000
beautiful, very, very modest, her home --

120
0:04:55.695,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and she was out there,

121
0:04:58.103,000 --> 0:04:59,000
dressed nicely,

122
0:04:59.655,000 --> 0:05:01,000
her husband in the back, her mother-in-law behind

123
0:05:01.815,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and her sister-in-law behind her.

124
0:05:04.041,000 --> 0:05:06,000
The social order was changing

125
0:05:06.113,000 --> 0:05:07,000
because this lady

126
0:05:07.863,000 --> 0:05:09,000
is part of our Project Shakti

127
0:05:09.999,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that is actually teaching women

128
0:05:12.283,000 --> 0:05:13,000
how to do small business

129
0:05:14.154,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and how to carry the message

130
0:05:15.333,000 --> 0:05:17,000
of nutrition and hygiene.

131
0:05:17.976,000 --> 0:05:19,000
We have 60,000 such women

132
0:05:20.183,000 --> 0:05:21,000
now in India.

133
0:05:22.035,000 --> 0:05:24,000
It's not about selling soap,

134
0:05:24.488,000 --> 0:05:25,000
it's about making sure

135
0:05:25.941,000 --> 0:05:27,000
that in the process of doing so

136
0:05:27.981,000 --> 0:05:29,000
you can change people's lives.

137
0:05:30.174,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Small actions, big difference.

138
0:05:33.371,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Our R&D folks

139
0:05:35.09,000 --> 0:05:38,000
are not only working to give us some fantastic detergents,

140
0:05:38.719,000 --> 0:05:4,000
but they're working to make sure we use less water.

141
0:05:41.488,000 --> 0:05:43,000
A product that we've just launched recently,

142
0:05:43.652,000 --> 0:05:46,000
One Rinse product that allows you to save water

143
0:05:47.18,000 --> 0:05:49,000
every time you wash your clothes.

144
0:05:49.356,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And if we can convert all our users to using this,

145
0:05:52.381,000 --> 0:05:54,000
that's 500 billion liters of water.

146
0:05:54.614,000 --> 0:05:56,000
By the way, that's equivalent to one month of water

147
0:05:56.908,000 --> 0:05:59,000
for a whole huge continent.

148
0:06:00.092,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So just think about it.

149
0:06:01.768,000 --> 0:06:04,000
There are small actions that can make a big difference.

150
0:06:05.335,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And I can go on and on.

151
0:06:06.953,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Our food chain, our brilliant products --

152
0:06:09.05,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and I'm sorry I'm giving you a word from the sponsors --

153
0:06:11.419,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Knorr, Hellman's and all those wonderful products.

154
0:06:15.121,000 --> 0:06:17,000
We are committed to making sure that

155
0:06:17.181,000 --> 0:06:18,000
all our agricultural raw materials

156
0:06:19.138,000 --> 0:06:21,000
are sourced from sustainable sources,

157
0:06:21.944,000 --> 0:06:23,000
100-percent sustainable sources.

158
0:06:24.044,000 --> 0:06:25,000
We were the first

159
0:06:25.592,000 --> 0:06:27,000
to say we are going to buy all of our palm oil

160
0:06:27.801,000 --> 0:06:28,000
from sustainable sources.

161
0:06:29.763,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I don't know how many of you know that palm oil,

162
0:06:33.683,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and not buying it from sustainable sources,

163
0:06:36.096,000 --> 0:06:38,000
can create deforestation that is responsible

164
0:06:38.701,000 --> 0:06:4,000
for 20 percent of the greenhouse gasses in the world.

165
0:06:41.243,000 --> 0:06:43,000
We were the first to embrace that,

166
0:06:43.759,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and it's all because we market soap and soup.

167
0:06:48.157,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And the point I'm making here

168
0:06:50.355,000 --> 0:06:53,000
is that companies like yours, companies like mine

169
0:06:53.878,000 --> 0:06:55,000
have to define a purpose

170
0:06:56.001,000 --> 0:06:58,000
which embraces responsibility

171
0:06:58.282,000 --> 0:07:,000
and understands that we have to play our part

172
0:07:00.982,000 --> 0:07:02,000
in the communities in which we operate.

173
0:07:03.819,000 --> 0:07:04,000
We introduced something called

174
0:07:05.719,000 --> 0:07:07,000
The Unilever Sustainable Living Plan, which said,

175
0:07:08.463,000 --> 0:07:1,000
"Our purpose is to make sustainable living commonplace,

176
0:07:11.349,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and we are gong to change the lives

177
0:07:13.176,000 --> 0:07:15,000
of one billion people over 2020."

178
0:07:15.901,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Now the question here is,

179
0:07:17.701,000 --> 0:07:18,000
where do we go from here?

180
0:07:19.225,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And the answer to that is very simple:

181
0:07:21.145,000 --> 0:07:23,000
We're not going to change the world alone.

182
0:07:23.278,000 --> 0:07:25,000
There are plenty of you and plenty of us

183
0:07:25.868,000 --> 0:07:26,000
who understand this.

184
0:07:27.338,000 --> 0:07:28,000
The question is,

185
0:07:28.503,000 --> 0:07:3,000
we need partnerships, we need coalitions

186
0:07:31.134,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and importantly, we need that leadership

187
0:07:33.59,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that will allow us to take this from here

188
0:07:36.55,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and to be the change

189
0:07:37.839,000 --> 0:07:38,000
that we want to see around us.

190
0:07:39.375,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Thank you very much.

191
0:07:40.695,000 --> 0:07:43,000
(Applause)

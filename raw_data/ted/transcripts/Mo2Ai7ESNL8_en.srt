1
0:00:12.996,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So recently, we heard a lot about how social media helps empower protest,

2
0:00:17.802,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and that's true,

3
0:00:19.181,000 --> 0:00:2,000
but after more than a decade

4
0:00:20.836,000 --> 0:00:23,000
of studying and participating in multiple social movements,

5
0:00:24.501,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I've come to realize

6
0:00:26.303,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that the way technology empowers social movements

7
0:00:29.614,000 --> 0:00:32,000
can also paradoxically help weaken them.

8
0:00:32.72,000 --> 0:00:35,000
This is not inevitable, but overcoming it requires diving deep

9
0:00:36.604,000 --> 0:00:4,000
into what makes success possible over the long term.

10
0:00:40.897,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And the lessons apply in multiple domains.

11
0:00:43.458,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Now, take Turkey's Gezi Park protests, July 2013,

12
0:00:47.453,000 --> 0:00:5,000
which I went back to study in the field.

13
0:00:50.49,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Twitter was key to its organizing.

14
0:00:52.943,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It was everywhere in the park -- well, along with a lot of tear gas.

15
0:00:56.337,000 --> 0:00:57,000
It wasn't all high tech.

16
0:00:58.175,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But the people in Turkey had already gotten used to the power of Twitter

17
0:01:02.053,000 --> 0:01:05,000
because of an unfortunate incident about a year before

18
0:01:05.994,000 --> 0:01:08,000
when military jets had bombed and killed

19
0:01:09.785,000 --> 0:01:13,000
34 Kurdish smugglers near the border region,

20
0:01:13.874,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and Turkish media completely censored this news.

21
0:01:18.618,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Editors sat in their newsrooms

22
0:01:20.456,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and waited for the government to tell them what to do.

23
0:01:23.355,000 --> 0:01:25,000
One frustrated journalist could not take this anymore.

24
0:01:25.955,000 --> 0:01:26,000
He purchased his own plane ticket,

25
0:01:27.645,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and went to the village where this had occurred.

26
0:01:29.957,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And he was confronted by this scene:

27
0:01:32.623,000 --> 0:01:37,000
a line of coffins coming down a hill, relatives wailing.

28
0:01:38.021,000 --> 0:01:4,000
He later he told me how overwhelmed he felt,

29
0:01:40.462,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and didn't know what to do,

30
0:01:42.183,000 --> 0:01:43,000
so he took out his phone,

31
0:01:44.156,000 --> 0:01:45,000
like any one of us might,

32
0:01:45.924,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and snapped that picture and tweeted it out.

33
0:01:49.122,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And voila, that picture went viral

34
0:01:52.849,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and broke the censorship and forced mass media to cover it.

35
0:01:57.237,000 --> 0:02:,000
So when, a year later, Turkey's Gezi protests happened,

36
0:02:00.418,000 --> 0:02:02,000
it started as a protest about a park being razed,

37
0:02:03.14,000 --> 0:02:05,000
but became an anti-authoritarian protest.

38
0:02:05.443,000 --> 0:02:09,000
It wasn't surprising that media also censored it,

39
0:02:09.601,000 --> 0:02:11,000
but it got a little ridiculous at times.

40
0:02:12.533,000 --> 0:02:14,000
When things were so intense,

41
0:02:14.603,000 --> 0:02:18,000
when CNN International was broadcasting live from Istanbul,

42
0:02:18.998,000 --> 0:02:24,000
CNN Turkey instead was broadcasting a documentary on penguins.

43
0:02:25.351,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Now, I love penguin documentaries, but that wasn't the news of the day.

44
0:02:29.934,000 --> 0:02:33,000
An angry viewer put his two screens together and snapped that picture,

45
0:02:34.231,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and that one too went viral,

46
0:02:36.098,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and since then, people call Turkish media the penguin media. (Laughter)

47
0:02:40.586,000 --> 0:02:42,000
But this time, people knew what to do.

48
0:02:42.751,000 --> 0:02:44,000
They just took out their phones and looked for actual news.

49
0:02:45.71,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Better, they knew to go to the park and take pictures and participate

50
0:02:50.174,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and share it more on social media.

51
0:02:52.125,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Digital connectivity was used for everything from food to donations.

52
0:02:58.675,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Everything was organized partially with the help of these new technologies.

53
0:03:03.947,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And using Internet to mobilize and publicize protests

54
0:03:08.153,000 --> 0:03:1,000
actually goes back a long way.

55
0:03:10.609,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Remember the Zapatistas,

56
0:03:12.454,000 --> 0:03:16,000
the peasant uprising in the southern Chiapas region of Mexico

57
0:03:17.089,000 --> 0:03:22,000
led by the masked, pipe-smoking, charismatic Subcomandante Marcos?

58
0:03:22.72,000 --> 0:03:23,000
That was probably the first movement

59
0:03:24.599,000 --> 0:03:26,000
that got global attention thanks to the Internet.

60
0:03:27.69,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Or consider Seattle '99,

61
0:03:29.338,000 --> 0:03:33,000
when a multinational grassroots effort brought global attention

62
0:03:34.141,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to what was then an obscure organization, the World Trade Organization,

63
0:03:38.826,000 --> 0:03:42,000
by also utilizing these digital technologies to help them organize.

64
0:03:43.367,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And more recently, movement after movement

65
0:03:45.902,000 --> 0:03:47,000
has shaken country after country:

66
0:03:48.74,000 --> 0:03:53,000
the Arab uprisings from Bahrain to Tunisia to Egypt and more;

67
0:03:53.872,000 --> 0:03:57,000
indignados in Spain, Italy, Greece; the Gezi Park protests;

68
0:03:58.744,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Taiwan; Euromaidan in Ukraine; Hong Kong.

69
0:04:02.968,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And think of more recent initiatives, like the #BringBackOurGirls hashtags.

70
0:04:07.68,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Nowadays, a network of tweets can unleash a global awareness campaign.

71
0:04:14.536,000 --> 0:04:17,000
A Facebook page can become the hub of a massive mobilization.

72
0:04:18.454,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Amazing.

73
0:04:20.224,000 --> 0:04:24,000
But think of the moments I just mentioned.

74
0:04:24.538,000 --> 0:04:28,000
The achievements they were able to have, their outcomes,

75
0:04:29.203,000 --> 0:04:33,000
are not really proportional to the size and energy they inspired.

76
0:04:34.013,000 --> 0:04:38,000
The hopes they rightfully raised are not really matched

77
0:04:38.034,000 --> 0:04:42,000
by what they were able to have as a result in the end.

78
0:04:42.502,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And this raises a question:

79
0:04:46.204,000 --> 0:04:5,000
As digital technology makes things easier for movements,

80
0:04:50.429,000 --> 0:04:54,000
why haven't successful outcomes become more likely as well?

81
0:04:54.452,000 --> 0:04:59,000
In embracing digital platforms for activism and politics,

82
0:05:00.017,000 --> 0:05:04,000
are we overlooking some of the benefits of doing things the hard way?

83
0:05:04.251,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Now, I believe so.

84
0:05:05.468,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I believe that the rule of thumb is:

85
0:05:07.273,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Easier to mobilize does not always mean easier to achieve gains.

86
0:05:12.61,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Now, to be clear,

87
0:05:15.503,000 --> 0:05:17,000
technology does empower in multiple ways.

88
0:05:18.357,000 --> 0:05:19,000
It's very powerful.

89
0:05:19.817,000 --> 0:05:23,000
In Turkey, I watched four young college students

90
0:05:23.863,000 --> 0:05:27,000
organize a countrywide citizen journalism network called 140Journos

91
0:05:28.093,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that became the central hub for uncensored news in the country.

92
0:05:32.524,000 --> 0:05:37,000
In Egypt, I saw another four young people use digital connectivity

93
0:05:37.671,000 --> 0:05:4,000
to organize the supplies and logistics for 10 field hospitals,

94
0:05:41.518,000 --> 0:05:43,000
very large operations,

95
0:05:43.529,000 --> 0:05:48,000
during massive clashes near Tahrir Square in 2011.

96
0:05:49.5,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And I asked the founder of this effort, called Tahrir Supplies,

97
0:05:53.217,000 --> 0:05:59,000
how long it took him to go from when he had the idea to when he got started.

98
0:05:59.327,000 --> 0:06:01,000
"Five minutes," he said. Five minutes.

99
0:06:01.686,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And he had no training or background in logistics.

100
0:06:04.234,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Or think of the Occupy movement which rocked the world in 2011.

101
0:06:07.957,000 --> 0:06:08,000
It started with a single email

102
0:06:09.935,000 --> 0:06:14,000
from a magazine, Adbusters, to 90,000 subscribers in its list.

103
0:06:15.176,000 --> 0:06:17,000
About two months after that first email,

104
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
there were in the United States 600 ongoing occupations and protests.

105
0:06:24.509,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Less than one month after the first physical occupation in Zuccotti Park,

106
0:06:30.333,000 --> 0:06:36,000
a global protest was held in about 82 countries, 950 cities.

107
0:06:37.174,000 --> 0:06:39,000
It was one of the largest global protests ever organized.

108
0:06:39.919,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Now, compare that to what the Civil Rights Movement had to do in 1955 Alabama

109
0:06:46.606,000 --> 0:06:52,000
to protest the racially segregated bus system, which they wanted to boycott.

110
0:06:52.743,000 --> 0:06:53,000
They'd been preparing for many years

111
0:06:54.495,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and decided it was time to swing into action

112
0:06:56.561,000 --> 0:06:58,000
after Rosa Parks was arrested.

113
0:06:58.764,000 --> 0:06:59,000
But how do you get the word out --

114
0:07:00.43,000 --> 0:07:02,000
tomorrow we're going to start the boycott --

115
0:07:02.593,000 --> 0:07:07,000
when you don't have Facebook, texting, Twitter, none of that?

116
0:07:08.001,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So they had to mimeograph 52,000 leaflets

117
0:07:13.171,000 --> 0:07:16,000
by sneaking into a university duplicating room

118
0:07:16.364,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and working all night, secretly.

119
0:07:18.905,000 --> 0:07:21,000
They then used the 68 African-American organizations

120
0:07:22.398,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that criss-crossed the city to distribute those leaflets by hand.

121
0:07:26.365,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And the logistical tasks were daunting, because these were poor people.

122
0:07:31.335,000 --> 0:07:33,000
They had to get to work, boycott or no,

123
0:07:33.425,000 --> 0:07:35,000
so a massive carpool was organized,

124
0:07:36.327,000 --> 0:07:38,000
again by meeting.

125
0:07:38.443,000 --> 0:07:4,000
No texting, no Twitter, no Facebook.

126
0:07:40.838,000 --> 0:07:43,000
They had to meet almost all the time to keep this carpool going.

127
0:07:44.407,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Today, it would be so much easier.

128
0:07:46.679,000 --> 0:07:5,000
We could create a database, available rides and what rides you need,

129
0:07:51.667,000 --> 0:07:54,000
have the database coordinate, and use texting.

130
0:07:54.949,000 --> 0:07:56,000
We wouldn't have to meet all that much.

131
0:07:57.503,000 --> 0:07:59,000
But again, consider this:

132
0:07:59.779,000 --> 0:08:01,000
the Civil Rights Movement in the United States

133
0:08:02.773,000 --> 0:08:06,000
navigated a minefield of political dangers,

134
0:08:07.267,000 --> 0:08:12,000
faced repression and overcame, won major policy concessions,

135
0:08:12.77,000 --> 0:08:15,000
navigated and innovated through risks.

136
0:08:16.006,000 --> 0:08:19,000
In contrast, three years after Occupy sparked

137
0:08:19.539,000 --> 0:08:21,000
that global conversation about inequality,

138
0:08:22.145,000 --> 0:08:25,000
the policies that fueled it are still in place.

139
0:08:25.97,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Europe was also rocked by anti-austerity protests,

140
0:08:29.115,000 --> 0:08:33,000
but the continent didn't shift its direction.

141
0:08:33.237,000 --> 0:08:35,000
In embracing these technologies,

142
0:08:36.173,000 --> 0:08:42,000
are we overlooking some of the benefits of slow and sustained?

143
0:08:42.581,000 --> 0:08:43,000
To understand this,

144
0:08:44.45,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I went back to Turkey about a year after the Gezi protests

145
0:08:47.573,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and I interviewed a range of people,

146
0:08:49.85,000 --> 0:08:52,000
from activists to politicians,

147
0:08:53.557,000 --> 0:08:57,000
from both the ruling party and the opposition party and movements.

148
0:08:58.174,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I found that the Gezi protesters were despairing.

149
0:09:01.48,000 --> 0:09:03,000
They were frustrated,

150
0:09:03.511,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and they had achieved much less than what they had hoped for.

151
0:09:06.567,000 --> 0:09:08,000
This echoed what I'd been hearing around the world

152
0:09:09.105,000 --> 0:09:12,000
from many other protesters that I'm in touch with.

153
0:09:12.891,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And I've come to realize that part of the problem

154
0:09:15.198,000 --> 0:09:2,000
is that today's protests have become a bit like climbing Mt. Everest

155
0:09:21.067,000 --> 0:09:23,000
with the help of 60 Sherpas,

156
0:09:23.524,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and the Internet is our Sherpa.

157
0:09:26.651,000 --> 0:09:3,000
What we're doing is taking the fast routes

158
0:09:30.964,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and not replacing the benefits of the slower work.

159
0:09:34.303,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Because, you see,

160
0:09:35.999,000 --> 0:09:37,000
the kind of work that went into organizing

161
0:09:38.867,000 --> 0:09:4,000
all those daunting, tedious logistical tasks

162
0:09:41.65,000 --> 0:09:43,000
did not just take care of those tasks,

163
0:09:44.279,000 --> 0:09:48,000
they also created the kind of organization that could think together collectively

164
0:09:48.963,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and make hard decisions together,

165
0:09:51.238,000 --> 0:09:54,000
create consensus and innovate, and maybe even more crucially,

166
0:09:55.175,000 --> 0:09:58,000
keep going together through differences.

167
0:09:58.542,000 --> 0:10:02,000
So when you see this March on Washington in 1963,

168
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
when you look at that picture,

169
0:10:05.014,000 --> 0:10:08,000
where this is the march where Martin Luther King gave his famous

170
0:10:08.355,000 --> 0:10:1,000
"I have a dream" speech, 1963,

171
0:10:11.207,000 --> 0:10:15,000
you don't just see a march and you don't just hear a powerful speech,

172
0:10:15.649,000 --> 0:10:2,000
you also see the painstaking, long-term work that can put on that march.

173
0:10:21.122,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And if you're in power,

174
0:10:22.917,000 --> 0:10:26,000
you realize you have to take the capacity signaled by that march,

175
0:10:27.218,000 --> 0:10:31,000
not just the march, but the capacity signaled by that march, seriously.

176
0:10:31.724,000 --> 0:10:35,000
In contrast, when you look at Occupy's global marches

177
0:10:35.727,000 --> 0:10:36,000
that were organized in two weeks,

178
0:10:37.369,000 --> 0:10:38,000
you see a lot of discontent,

179
0:10:38.753,000 --> 0:10:42,000
but you don't necessarily see teeth that can bite over the long term.

180
0:10:43.617,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And crucially, the Civil Rights Movement innovated tactically

181
0:10:47.71,000 --> 0:10:53,000
from boycotts to lunch counter sit-ins to pickets to marches to freedom rides.

182
0:10:54.496,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Today's movements scale up very quickly without the organizational base

183
0:10:58.311,000 --> 0:11:,000
that can see them through the challenges.

184
0:11:00.9,000 --> 0:11:03,000
They feel a little like startups that got very big

185
0:11:04.7,000 --> 0:11:06,000
without knowing what to do next,

186
0:11:06.705,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and they rarely manage to shift tactically

187
0:11:09.362,000 --> 0:11:11,000
because they don't have the depth of capacity

188
0:11:11.859,000 --> 0:11:13,000
to weather such transitions.

189
0:11:14.151,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Now, I want to be clear: The magic is not in the mimeograph.

190
0:11:19.668,000 --> 0:11:24,000
It's in that capacity to work together, think together collectively,

191
0:11:25.489,000 --> 0:11:28,000
which can only be built over time with a lot of work.

192
0:11:28.671,000 --> 0:11:3,000
To understand all this,

193
0:11:30.747,000 --> 0:11:33,000
I interviewed a top official from the ruling party in Turkey,

194
0:11:34.571,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and I ask him, "How do you do it?"

195
0:11:36.739,000 --> 0:11:39,000
They too use digital technology extensively, so that's not it.

196
0:11:40.442,000 --> 0:11:41,000
So what's the secret?

197
0:11:42.372,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Well, he told me.

198
0:11:43.896,000 --> 0:11:49,000
He said the key is he never took sugar with his tea.

199
0:11:50.532,000 --> 0:11:53,000
I said, what has that got to do with anything?

200
0:11:53.593,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Well, he said, his party starts getting ready for the next election

201
0:11:56.759,000 --> 0:11:57,000
the day after the last one,

202
0:11:58.3,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and he spends all day every day meeting with voters in their homes,

203
0:12:02.281,000 --> 0:12:04,000
in their wedding parties, circumcision ceremonies,

204
0:12:04.863,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and then he meets with his colleagues to compare notes.

205
0:12:07.818,000 --> 0:12:11,000
With that many meetings every day, with tea offered at every one of them,

206
0:12:12.384,000 --> 0:12:15,000
which he could not refuse, because that would be rude,

207
0:12:15.736,000 --> 0:12:19,000
he could not take even one cube of sugar per cup of tea,

208
0:12:20.379,000 --> 0:12:23,000
because that would be many kilos of sugar, he can't even calculate how many kilos,

209
0:12:24.335,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and at that point I realized why he was speaking so fast.

210
0:12:27.979,000 --> 0:12:3,000
We had met in the afternoon, and he was already way over-caffeinated.

211
0:12:32.527,000 --> 0:12:36,000
But his party won two major elections

212
0:12:37,000 --> 0:12:4,000
within a year of the Gezi protests with comfortable margins.

213
0:12:40.658,000 --> 0:12:43,000
To be sure, governments have different resources to bring to the table.

214
0:12:43.997,000 --> 0:12:46,000
It's not the same game, but the differences are instructive.

215
0:12:47.154,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And like all such stories, this is not a story just of technology.

216
0:12:51.009,000 --> 0:12:56,000
It's what technology allows us to do converging with what we want to do.

217
0:12:56.091,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Today's social movements want to operate informally.

218
0:12:59.877,000 --> 0:13:01,000
They do not want institutional leadership.

219
0:13:02.147,000 --> 0:13:06,000
They want to stay out of politics because they fear corruption and cooptation.

220
0:13:07.013,000 --> 0:13:08,000
They have a point.

221
0:13:08.546,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Modern representative democracies are being strangled in many countries

222
0:13:11.961,000 --> 0:13:12,000
by powerful interests.

223
0:13:14.244,000 --> 0:13:17,000
But operating this way makes it hard for them

224
0:13:17.518,000 --> 0:13:2,000
to sustain over the long term and exert leverage over the system,

225
0:13:21.268,000 --> 0:13:24,000
which leads to frustrated protesters dropping out,

226
0:13:24.53,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and even more corrupt politics.

227
0:13:27.889,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And politics and democracy without an effective challenge hobbles,

228
0:13:32.977,000 --> 0:13:38,000
because the causes that have inspired the modern recent movements are crucial.

229
0:13:39.37,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Climate change is barreling towards us.

230
0:13:42.465,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Inequality is stifling human growth and potential and economies.

231
0:13:47.348,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Authoritarianism is choking many countries.

232
0:13:49.633,000 --> 0:13:51,000
We need movements to be more effective.

233
0:13:52.384,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Now, some people have argued that the problem is

234
0:13:55.062,000 --> 0:14:01,000
today's movements are not formed of people who take as many risks as before,

235
0:14:01.521,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and that is not true.

236
0:14:03.569,000 --> 0:14:05,000
From Gezi to Tahrir to elsewhere,

237
0:14:06.131,000 --> 0:14:09,000
I've seen people put their lives and livelihoods on the line.

238
0:14:09.769,000 --> 0:14:11,000
It's also not true, as Malcolm Gladwell claimed,

239
0:14:12.188,000 --> 0:14:14,000
that today's protesters form weaker virtual ties.

240
0:14:14.93,000 --> 0:14:17,000
No, they come to these protests, just like before,

241
0:14:18.721,000 --> 0:14:2,000
with their friends, existing networks,

242
0:14:21.333,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and sometimes they do make new friends for life.

243
0:14:23.635,000 --> 0:14:25,000
I still see the friends that I made

244
0:14:26.221,000 --> 0:14:29,000
in those Zapatista-convened global protests more than a decade ago,

245
0:14:29.643,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and the bonds between strangers are not worthless.

246
0:14:32.615,000 --> 0:14:34,000
When I got tear-gassed in Gezi,

247
0:14:34.899,000 --> 0:14:39,000
people I didn't know helped me and one another instead of running away.

248
0:14:40.171,000 --> 0:14:43,000
In Tahrir, I saw people, protesters,

249
0:14:43.398,000 --> 0:14:45,000
working really hard to keep each other safe and protected.

250
0:14:46.208,000 --> 0:14:47,000
And digital awareness-raising is great,

251
0:14:48.097,000 --> 0:14:51,000
because changing minds is the bedrock of changing politics.

252
0:14:51.816,000 --> 0:14:58,000
But movements today have to move beyond participation at great scale very fast

253
0:14:59.216,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and figure out how to think together collectively,

254
0:15:02.715,000 --> 0:15:05,000
develop strong policy proposals, create consensus,

255
0:15:06.456,000 --> 0:15:09,000
figure out the political steps and relate them to leverage,

256
0:15:10.13,000 --> 0:15:13,000
because all these good intentions and bravery and sacrifice by itself

257
0:15:13.813,000 --> 0:15:14,000
are not going to be enough.

258
0:15:15.485,000 --> 0:15:16,000
And there are many efforts.

259
0:15:17.381,000 --> 0:15:21,000
In New Zealand, a group of young people are developing a platform called Loomio

260
0:15:21.77,000 --> 0:15:24,000
for participatory decision making at scale.

261
0:15:24.771,000 --> 0:15:27,000
In Turkey, 140Journos are holding hack-a-thons

262
0:15:28.046,000 --> 0:15:31,000
so that they support communities as well as citizen journalism.

263
0:15:32.619,000 --> 0:15:35,000
In Argentina, an open-source platform called DemocracyOS

264
0:15:35.725,000 --> 0:15:38,000
is bringing participation to parliaments and political parties.

265
0:15:39.133,000 --> 0:15:42,000
These are all great, and we need more,

266
0:15:42.518,000 --> 0:15:46,000
but the answer won't just be better online decision-making,

267
0:15:46.694,000 --> 0:15:51,000
because to update democracy, we are going to need to innovate at every level,

268
0:15:52.247,000 --> 0:15:56,000
from the organizational to the political to the social.

269
0:15:56.74,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Because to succeed over the long term,

270
0:16:00.692,000 --> 0:16:02,000
sometimes you do need tea without sugar

271
0:16:03.064,000 --> 0:16:04,000
along with your Twitter.

272
0:16:04.697,000 --> 0:16:05,000
Thank you.

273
0:16:06.209,000 --> 0:16:12,000
(Applause)

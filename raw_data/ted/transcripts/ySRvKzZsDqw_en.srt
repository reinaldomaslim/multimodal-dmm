1
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'm going to talk about a technology that we're developing at Oxford now,

2
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
that we think is going to change the way that

3
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
computer games and Hollywood movies are being made.

4
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
That technology is simulating humans.

5
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It's simulated humans with a simulated body

6
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and a simulated nervous system to control that body.

7
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Now, before I talk more about that technology,

8
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
let's have a quick look at what human characters look like

9
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
at the moment in computer games.

10
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
This is a clip from a game called "Grand Theft Auto 3."

11
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
We already saw that briefly yesterday.

12
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And what you can see is -- it is actually a very good game.

13
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It's one of the most successful games of all time.

14
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
But what you'll see is that all the animations in this game are very repetitive.

15
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
They pretty much look the same.

16
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I've made him run into a wall here, over and over again.

17
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And you can see he looks always the same.

18
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
The reason for that is that these characters

19
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
are actually not real characters.

20
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
They are a graphical visualization of a character.

21
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
To produce these animations, an animator at a studio has to anticipate

22
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
what's going to happen in the actual game,

23
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and then has to animate that particular sequence.

24
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So, he or she sits down, animates it, and tries to anticipate what's going to happen,

25
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and then these particular animations are just played back

26
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
at appropriate times in the computer game.

27
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Now, the result of that is that you can't have real interactivity.

28
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
All you have is animations that are played back

29
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
at more or less the appropriate times.

30
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
It also means that games aren't really going to be as surprising as they could be,

31
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
because you only get out of it, at least in terms of the character,

32
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
what you actually put into it.

33
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
There's no real emergence there.

34
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And thirdly, as I said, most of the animations are very repetitive because of that.

35
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Now, the only way to get around that

36
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
is to actually simulate the human body

37
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and to simulate that bit of the nervous system of the brain that controls that body.

38
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And maybe, if I could have you for a quick demonstration

39
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
to show what the difference is --

40
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
because, I mean, it's very, very trivial.

41
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
If I push Chris a bit, like this, for example, he'll react to it.

42
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
If I push him from a different angle, he'll react to it differently,

43
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and that's because he has a physical body,

44
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and because he has the motor skills to control that body.

45
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
It's a very trivial thing.

46
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
It's not something you get in computer games at the moment, at all.

47
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Thank you very much. Chris Anderson: That's it?

48
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Torsten Reil: That's it, yes.

49
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
So, that's what we're trying to simulate --

50
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
not Chris specifically, I should say, but humans in general.

51
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Now, we started working on this a while ago at Oxford University,

52
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and we tried to start very simply.

53
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
What we tried to do was teach a stick figure how to walk.

54
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
That stick figure is physically stimulated. You can see it here on the screen.

55
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So, it's subject to gravity, has joints, etc.

56
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
If you just run the simulation, it will just collapse, like this.

57
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
The tricky bit is now to put an AI controller in it

58
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that actually makes it work.

59
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And for that, we use the neural network, which we based on

60
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that part of the nervous system that we have in our spine

61
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that controls walking in humans.

62
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
It's called the central pattern generator.

63
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So, we simulated that as well, and then the really tricky bit

64
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
is to teach that network how to walk.

65
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
For that we used artificial evolution -- genetic algorithms.

66
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
We heard about those already yesterday,

67
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and I suppose that most of you are familiar with that already.

68
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
But, just briefly, the concept is that

69
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
you create a large number of different individuals --

70
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
neural networks, in this case --

71
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
all of which are random at the beginning.

72
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
You hook these up -- in this case, to the virtual muscles

73
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
of that two-legged creature here --

74
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and hope that it does something interesting.

75
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
At the beginning, they're all going to be very boring.

76
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Most of them won't move at all,

77
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
but some of them might make a tiny step.

78
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Those are then selected by the algorithm,

79
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
reproduced with mutation and recombinations to introduce sex as well.

80
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And you repeat that process over and over again,

81
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
until you have something that walks --

82
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
in this case, in a straight line, like this.

83
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So that was the idea behind this.

84
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
When we started this, I set up the simulation one evening.

85
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
It took about three to four hours to run the simulation.

86
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I got up the next morning, went to the computer and looked at the results,

87
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and was hoping for something that walked in a straight line,

88
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
like I've just demonstrated,

89
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and this is what I got instead.

90
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
(Laughter)

91
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So, it was back to the drawing board for us.

92
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
We did get it to work eventually,

93
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
after tweaking a bit here and there.

94
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And this is an example of a successful evolutionary run.

95
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So, what you'll see in a moment is a very simple biped

96
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
that's learning how to walk using artificial evolution.

97
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
At the beginning, it can't walk at all,

98
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
but it will get better and better over time.

99
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So, this is the one that can't walk at all.

100
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
(Laughter)

101
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Now, after five generations of applying evolutionary process,

102
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
the genetic algorithm is getting a tiny bit better.

103
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
(Laughter)

104
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Generation 10 and it'll take a few steps more --

105
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
still not quite there.

106
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
But now, after generation 20, it actually walks in a straight line without falling over.

107
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
That was the real breakthrough for us.

108
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
It was, academically, quite a challenging project,

109
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and once we had reached that stage, we were quite confident

110
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that we could try and do other things as well with this approach --

111
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
actually simulating the body

112
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and simulating that part of the nervous system that controls it.

113
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
Now, at this stage, it also became clear that this could be very exciting

114
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
for things like computer games or online worlds.

115
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
What you see here is the character standing there,

116
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and there's an obstacle that we put in its way.

117
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And what you see is, it's going to fall over the obstacle.

118
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Now, the interesting bit is, if I move the obstacle a tiny bit to the right,

119
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
which is what I'm doing now, here,

120
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
it will fall over it in a completely different way.

121
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And again, if you move the obstacle a tiny bit, it'll again fall differently.

122
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
(Laughter)

123
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Now, what you see, by the way, at the top there,

124
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
are some of the neural activations being fed into the virtual muscles.

125
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Okay. That's the video. Thanks.

126
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Now, this might look kind of trivial, but it's actually very important

127
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
because this is not something you get at the moment

128
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
in any interactive or any virtual worlds.

129
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Now, at this stage, we decided to start a company and move this further,

130
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
because obviously this was just a very simple, blocky biped.

131
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
What we really wanted was a full human body.

132
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So we started the company.

133
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
We hired a team of physicists, software engineers and biologists

134
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
to work on this, and the first thing we had to work on

135
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
was to create the human body, basically.

136
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
It's got to be relatively fast, so you can run it on a normal machine,

137
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
but it's got to be accurate enough, so it looks good enough, basically.

138
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So we put quite a bit of biomechanical knowledge into this thing,

139
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and tried to make it as realistic as possible.

140
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
What you see here on the screen right now

141
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
is a very simple visualization of that body.

142
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
I should add that it's very simple to add things like hair, clothes, etc.,

143
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
but what we've done here is use a very simple visualization,

144
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
so you can concentrate on the movement.

145
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Now, what I'm going to do right now, in a moment,

146
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
is just push this character a tiny bit and we'll see what happens.

147
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Nothing really interesting, basically.

148
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
It falls over, but it falls over like a rag doll, basically.

149
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
The reason for that is that there's no intelligence in it.

150
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
It becomes interesting when you put artificial intelligence into it.

151
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So, this character now has motor skills in the upper body --

152
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
nothing in the legs yet, in this particular one.

153
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
But what it will do -- I'm going to push it again.

154
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
It will realize autonomously that it's being pushed.

155
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
It's going to stick out its hands.

156
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
It's going to turn around into the fall, and try and catch the fall.

157
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
So that's what you see here.

158
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Now, it gets really interesting

159
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
if you then add the AI for the lower part of the body as well.

160
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
So here, we've got the same character.

161
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I'm going to push it a bit harder now,

162
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
harder than I just pushed Chris.

163
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
But what you'll see is -- it's going to receive a push now from the left.

164
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
What you see is it takes steps backwards,

165
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
it tries to counter-balance,

166
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
it tries to look at the place where it thinks it's going to land.

167
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
I'll show you this again.

168
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And then, finally hits the floor.

169
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Now, this becomes really exciting

170
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
when you push that character in different directions, again, just as I've done.

171
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
That's something that you cannot do right now.

172
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
At the moment, you only have empty computer graphics in games.

173
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
What this is now is a real simulation. That's what I want to show you now.

174
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
So, here's the same character with the same behavior I've just shown you,

175
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
but now I'm just going to push it from different directions.

176
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
First, starting with a push from the right.

177
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
This is all slow motion, by the way, so we can see what's going on.

178
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Now, the angle will have changed a tiny bit,

179
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
so you can see that the reaction is different.

180
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Again, a push, now this time from the front.

181
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And you see it falls differently.

182
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And now from the left --

183
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and it falls differently.

184
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
That was really exciting for us to see that.

185
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
That was the first time we've seen that.

186
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
This is the first time the public sees this as well,

187
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
because we have been in stealth mode.

188
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
I haven't shown this to anybody yet.

189
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Now, just a fun thing:

190
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
what happens if you put that character --

191
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
this is now a wooden version of it, but it's got the same AI in it --

192
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
but if you put that character on a slippery surface, like ice.

193
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
We just did that for a laugh, just to see what happens.

194
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
(Laughter)

195
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And this is what happens.

196
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
(Laughter)

197
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
(Applause)

198
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
It's nothing we had to do about this.

199
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
We just took this character that I just talked about,

200
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
put it on a slippery surface, and this is what you get out of it.

201
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And that's a really fascinating thing about this approach.

202
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Now, when we went to film studios and games developers

203
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and showed them that technology, we got a very good response.

204
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And what they said was, the first thing they need immediately is virtual stuntmen.

205
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Because stunts are obviously very dangerous, they're very expensive,

206
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and there are a lot of stunt scenes that you cannot do, obviously,

207
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:45,000
because you can't really allow the stuntman to be seriously hurt.

208
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
So, they wanted to have a digital version of a stuntman

209
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and that's what we've been working on for the past few months.

210
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And that's our first product that we're going to release in a couple of weeks.

211
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
So, here are just a few very simple scenes of the guy just being kicked.

212
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
That's what people want. That's what we're giving them.

213
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
(Laughter)

214
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
You can see, it's always reacting.

215
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
This is not a dead body. This is a body who basically, in this particular case,

216
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
feels the force and tries to protect its head.

217
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Only, I think it's quite a big blow again.

218
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
You feel kind of sorry for that thing,

219
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and we've seen it so many times now that

220
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
we don't really care any more.

221
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
(Laughter)

222
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
There are much worse videos than this, by the way, which I have taken out, but ...

223
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Now, here's another one.

224
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
What people wanted as a behavior was to have an explosion,

225
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
a strong force applied to the character,

226
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and have the character react to it in midair.

227
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
So that you don't have a character that looks limp,

228
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
but actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away,

229
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
that looks kind of alive in midair as well.

230
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So this character is going to be hit by a force,

231
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
it's going to realize it's in the air,

232
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and it's going to try and, well,

233
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
stick out its arm in the direction where it's landing.

234
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
That's one angle; here's another angle.

235
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
We now think that the realism we're achieving with this

236
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
is good enough to be used in films.

237
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And let's just have a look at a slightly different visualization.

238
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
This is something I just got last night

239
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
from an animation studio in London, who are using our software

240
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and experimenting with it right now.

241
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
So this is exactly the same behavior that you saw,

242
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
but in a slightly better rendered version.

243
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
So if you look at the character carefully,

244
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
you see there are lots of body movements going on,

245
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
none of which you have to animate like in the old days.

246
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Animators had to actually animate them.

247
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
This is all happening automatically in the simulation.

248
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
This is a slightly different angle,

249
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and again a slow motion version of this.

250
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
This is incredibly quick. This is happening in real time.

251
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
You can run this simulation in real time, in front of your eyes,

252
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
change it, if you want to, and you get the animation straight out of it.

253
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
At the moment, doing something like this by hand

254
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
would take you probably a couple of days.

255
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
This is another behavior they requested.

256
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
I'm not quite sure why, but we've done it anyway.

257
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
It's a very simple behavior that shows you the power of this approach.

258
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
In this case, the character's hands

259
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
are fixed to a particular point in space,

260
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and all we've told the character to do is to struggle.

261
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And it looks organic. It looks realistic.

262
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
You feel kind of sorry for the guy.

263
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
It's even worse -- and that is another video I just got last night --

264
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
if you render that a bit more realistically.

265
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Now, I'm showing this to you just to show you

266
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
how organic it actually can feel, how realistic it can look.

267
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And this is all a physical simulation of the body,

268
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
using AI to drive virtual muscles in that body.

269
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Now, one thing which we did for a laugh was

270
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
to create a slightly more complex stunt scene,

271
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and one of the most famous stunts is the one where James Bond

272
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
jumps off a dam in Switzerland and then is caught by a bungee.

273
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Got a very short clip here.

274
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Yes, you can just about see it here.

275
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
In this case, they were using a real stunt man. It was a very dangerous stunt.

276
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
It was just voted, I think in the Sunday Times, as one of the most impressive stunts.

277
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Now, we've just tried and -- looked at our character and asked ourselves,

278
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
"Can we do that ourselves as well?"

279
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Can we use the physical simulation of the character,

280
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
use artificial intelligence,

281
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
put that artificial intelligence into the character,

282
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
drive virtual muscles, simulate the way he jumps off the dam,

283
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and then skydive afterwards,

284
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and have him caught by a bungee afterwards?

285
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
We did that. It took about altogether just two hours,

286
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
pretty much, to create the simulation.

287
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And that's what it looks like, here.

288
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Now, this could do with a bit more work. It's still very early stages,

289
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:42,000
and we pretty much just did this for a laugh,

290
0:14:42.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
just to see what we'd get out of it.

291
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
But what we found over the past few months

292
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
is that this approach -- that we're pretty much standard upon --

293
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
is incredibly powerful.

294
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
We are ourselves surprised what you actually get out of the simulations.

295
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
There's very often very surprising behavior that you didn't predict before.

296
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
There's so many things we can do with this right now.

297
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
The first thing, as I said, is going to be virtual stuntmen.

298
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Several studios are using this software now to produce virtual stuntmen,

299
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and they're going to hit the screen quite soon, actually,

300
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
for some major productions.

301
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
The second thing is video games.

302
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
With this technology, video games will look different and they will feel very different.

303
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
For the first time, you'll have actors that really feel very interactive,

304
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
that have real bodies that really react.

305
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
I think that's going to be incredibly exciting.

306
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Probably starting with sports games,

307
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
which are going to become much more interactive.

308
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
But I particularly am really excited

309
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:35,000
about using this technology in online worlds,

310
0:15:35.16,000 --> 0:15:38,000
like there, for example, that Tom Melcher has shown us.

311
0:15:38.16,000 --> 0:15:4,000
The degree of interactivity you're going to get

312
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
is totally different, I think, from what you're getting right now.

313
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
A third thing we are looking at and very interested in is simulation.

314
0:15:49.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
We've been approached by several simulation companies,

315
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:54,000
but one project we're particularly excited about, which we're starting next month,

316
0:15:54.16,000 --> 0:15:58,000
is to use our technology -- and in particular, the walking technology --

317
0:15:58.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
to help aid surgeons who work on children with cerebral palsy,

318
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
to predict the outcome of operations on these children.

319
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
As you probably know,

320
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
it's very difficult to predict what the outcome of an operation is

321
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:12,000
if you try and correct the gait.

322
0:16:12.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
The classic quote is, I think, it's unpredictable at best,

323
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
is what people think right now, is the outcome.

324
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Now, what we want to do with our software is allow our surgeons to have a tool.

325
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
We're going to simulate the gait of a particular child

326
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
and the surgeon can then work on that simulation

327
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:3,000
and try out different ways to improve that gait,

328
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:33,000
before he actually commits to an actual surgery.

329
0:16:33.16,000 --> 0:16:35,000
That's one project we're particularly excited about,

330
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
and that's going to start next month.

331
0:16:39.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
Just finally, this is only just the beginning.

332
0:16:42.16,000 --> 0:16:44,000
We can only do several behaviors right now.

333
0:16:44.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
The AI isn't good enough to simulate a full human body.

334
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
The body yes, but not all the motor skills that we have.

335
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:53,000
And, I think, we're only there if we can have something like ballet dancing.

336
0:16:53.16,000 --> 0:16:55,000
Right now, we don't have that

337
0:16:55.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
but I'm very sure that we will be able to do that at some stage.

338
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
We do have one unintentional dancer actually,

339
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:02,000
the last thing I'm going to show you.

340
0:17:02.16,000 --> 0:17:05,000
This was an AI contour that was produced and evolved --

341
0:17:05.16,000 --> 0:17:08,000
half-evolved, I should say -- to produce balance, basically.

342
0:17:08.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
So, you kick the guy and the guy's supposed to counter-balance.

343
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:14,000
That's what we thought was going to come out of this.

344
0:17:14.16,000 --> 0:17:16,000
But this is what emerged out of it, in the end.

345
0:17:17.16,000 --> 0:17:27,000
(Music)

346
0:17:27.16,000 --> 0:17:3,000
Bizarrely, this thing doesn't have a head. I'm not quite sure why.

347
0:17:31.16,000 --> 0:17:33,000
So, this was not something we actually put in there.

348
0:17:33.16,000 --> 0:17:37,000
He just started to create that dance himself.

349
0:17:37.16,000 --> 0:17:4,000
He's actually a better dancer than I am, I have to say.

350
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:43,000
And what you see after a while --

351
0:17:43.16,000 --> 0:17:45,000
I think he even goes into a climax right at the end.

352
0:17:49.16,000 --> 0:17:52,000
And I think -- there you go.

353
0:17:52.16,000 --> 0:17:54,000
(Laughter)

354
0:17:54.16,000 --> 0:17:56,000
So, that all happened automatically. We didn't put that in there.

355
0:17:56.16,000 --> 0:17:59,000
That's just the simulation creating this itself, basically.

356
0:17:59.16,000 --> 0:18:01,000
So it's just --

357
0:18:01.16,000 --> 0:18:02,000
(Applause)

358
0:18:02.16,000 --> 0:18:04,000
Thanks.

359
0:18:05.16,000 --> 0:18:08,000
Not quite John Travolta yet, but we're working on that as well,

360
0:18:08.16,000 --> 0:18:1,000
so thanks very much for your time.

361
0:18:10.16,000 --> 0:18:11,000
Thanks.

362
0:18:11.16,000 --> 0:18:12,000
(Applause)

363
0:18:12.16,000 --> 0:18:14,000
CA: Incredible. That was really incredible.

364
0:18:14.16,000 --> 0:18:15,000
TR: Thanks.

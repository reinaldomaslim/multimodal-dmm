Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast

2
0:00:12.723,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm 150 feet down an illegal mine shaft in Ghana.

3
0:00:19.123,000 --> 0:00:23,000
The air is thick with heat and dust,

4
0:00:23.244,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and it's hard to breathe.

5
0:00:26.653,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I can feel the brush of sweaty bodies passing me

6
0:00:29.915,000 --> 0:00:33,000
in the darkness, but I can't see much else.

7
0:00:34.161,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I hear voices talking, but mostly the shaft

8
0:00:38.131,000 --> 0:00:41,000
is this cacophony of men coughing,

9
0:00:42.119,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and stone being broken with primitive tools.

10
0:00:46.03,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Like the others, I wear a flickering, cheap flashlight

11
0:00:50.085,000 --> 0:00:54,000
tied to my head with this elastic, tattered band,

12
0:00:54.881,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and I can barely make out the slick tree limbs

13
0:00:58.221,000 --> 0:01:01,000
holding up the walls of the three-foot square hole

14
0:01:01.25,000 --> 0:01:05,000
dropping hundreds of feet into the earth.

15
0:01:05.876,000 --> 0:01:08,000
When my hand slips, I suddenly remember a miner

16
0:01:08.956,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I had met days before who had lost his grip

17
0:01:13.237,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and fell countless feet down that shaft.

18
0:01:17.858,000 --> 0:01:19,000
As I stand talking to you today,

19
0:01:20.389,000 --> 0:01:23,000
these men are still deep in that hole,

20
0:01:23.893,000 --> 0:01:26,000
risking their lives without payment or compensation,

21
0:01:27.408,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and often dying.

22
0:01:30.548,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I got to climb out of that hole, and I got to go home,

23
0:01:35.736,000 --> 0:01:41,000
but they likely never will, because they're trapped in slavery.

24
0:01:41.918,000 --> 0:01:43,000
For the last 28 years, I've been documenting

25
0:01:44.825,000 --> 0:01:46,000
indigenous cultures in more than 70 countries

26
0:01:47.386,000 --> 0:01:5,000
on six continents, and in 2009 I had the great honor

27
0:01:51.181,000 --> 0:01:55,000
of being the sole exhibitor at the Vancouver Peace Summit.

28
0:01:55.593,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Amongst all the astonishing people I met there,

29
0:01:59.165,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I met a supporter of Free the Slaves, an NGO

30
0:02:02.335,000 --> 0:02:07,000
dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery.

31
0:02:07.662,000 --> 0:02:09,000
We started talking about slavery, and really,

32
0:02:10.551,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I started learning about slavery,

33
0:02:13.415,000 --> 0:02:16,000
for I had certainly known it existed in the world,

34
0:02:16.624,000 --> 0:02:19,000
but not to such a degree.

35
0:02:19.635,000 --> 0:02:22,000
After we finished talking, I felt so horrible

36
0:02:23.378,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and honestly ashamed at my own lack of knowledge

37
0:02:26.754,000 --> 0:02:29,000
of this atrocity in my own lifetime, and I thought,

38
0:02:30.264,000 --> 0:02:34,000
if I don't know, how many other people don't know?

39
0:02:35.132,000 --> 0:02:38,000
It started burning a hole in my stomach, so within weeks,

40
0:02:38.947,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I flew down to Los Angeles to meet with the director

41
0:02:41.923,000 --> 0:02:44,000
of Free the Slaves and offer them my help.

42
0:02:45.194,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Thus began my journey into modern day slavery.

43
0:02:49.764,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Oddly, I had been to many of these places before.

44
0:02:52.906,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Some I even considered like my second home.

45
0:02:56.387,000 --> 0:03:03,000
But this time, I would see the skeletons hidden in the closet.

46
0:03:03.822,000 --> 0:03:05,000
A conservative estimate tells us there are more than

47
0:03:06.127,000 --> 0:03:1,000
27 million people enslaved in the world today.

48
0:03:10.282,000 --> 0:03:13,000
That's double the amount of people taken from Africa

49
0:03:13.762,000 --> 0:03:17,000
during the entire trans-Atlantic slave trade.

50
0:03:17.887,000 --> 0:03:2,000
A hundred and fifty years ago, an agricultural slave

51
0:03:21.031,000 --> 0:03:24,000
cost about three times the annual salary

52
0:03:24.525,000 --> 0:03:26,000
of an American worker.

53
0:03:27.271,000 --> 0:03:3,000
That equates to about $50,000 in today's money.

54
0:03:31.264,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Yet today, entire families can be enslaved for generations

55
0:03:35.656,000 --> 0:03:39,000
over a debt as small as $18.

56
0:03:40.524,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Astonishingly, slavery generates profits

57
0:03:43.556,000 --> 0:03:48,000
of more than $13 billion worldwide each year.

58
0:03:49.302,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Many have been tricked by false promises

59
0:03:52.154,000 --> 0:03:56,000
of a good education, a better job, only to find

60
0:03:56.7,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that they're forced to work without pay

61
0:04:00.208,000 --> 0:04:05,000
under the threat of violence, and they cannot walk away.

62
0:04:05.876,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Today's slavery is about commerce,

63
0:04:09.158,000 --> 0:04:13,000
so the goods that enslaved people produce have value,

64
0:04:13.188,000 --> 0:04:17,000
but the people producing them are disposable.

65
0:04:18.186,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Slavery exists everywhere, nearly, in the world,

66
0:04:22.576,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world.

67
0:04:29.543,000 --> 0:04:33,000
In India and Nepal, I was introduced to the brick kilns.

68
0:04:34.333,000 --> 0:04:36,000
This strange and awesome sight was like

69
0:04:37.124,000 --> 0:04:4,000
walking into ancient Egypt or Dante's Inferno.

70
0:04:41.014,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Enveloped in temperatures of 130 degrees,

71
0:04:45.165,000 --> 0:04:49,000
men, women, children, entire families in fact,

72
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
were cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust,

73
0:04:52.411,000 --> 0:04:54,000
while mechanically stacking bricks on their head,

74
0:04:55.031,000 --> 0:04:58,000
up to 18 at a time, and carrying them

75
0:04:58.152,000 --> 0:05:02,000
from the scorching kilns to trucks hundreds of yards away.

76
0:05:03.102,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Deadened by monotony and exhaustion,

77
0:05:06.629,000 --> 0:05:11,000
they work silently, doing this task over and over

78
0:05:12.214,000 --> 0:05:15,000
for 16 or 17 hours a day.

79
0:05:15.567,000 --> 0:05:18,000
There were no breaks for food, no water breaks,

80
0:05:19.286,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and the severe dehydration made urinating

81
0:05:21.838,000 --> 0:05:23,000
pretty much inconsequential.

82
0:05:24.71,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So pervasive was the heat and the dust

83
0:05:27.142,000 --> 0:05:3,000
that my camera became too hot to even touch

84
0:05:30.893,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and ceased working.

85
0:05:33.345,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Every 20 minutes, I'd have to run back to our cruiser

86
0:05:36.117,000 --> 0:05:39,000
to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner

87
0:05:39.466,000 --> 0:05:42,000
to revive it, and as I sat there,

88
0:05:42.521,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I thought, my camera is getting far better treatment

89
0:05:47.131,000 --> 0:05:49,000
than these people.

90
0:05:49.457,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Back in the kilns, I wanted to cry,

91
0:05:52.329,000 --> 0:05:55,000
but the abolitionist next to me quickly grabbed me

92
0:05:55.507,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and he said, "Lisa, don't do that. Just don't do that here."

93
0:05:59.811,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And he very clearly explained to me that emotional displays

94
0:06:03.704,000 --> 0:06:05,000
are very dangerous in a place like this,

95
0:06:06.238,000 --> 0:06:09,000
not just for me, but for them.

96
0:06:10.092,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I couldn't offer them any direct help.

97
0:06:13.742,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I couldn't give them money, nothing.

98
0:06:16.535,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I wasn't a citizen of that country.

99
0:06:18.332,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I could get them in a worse situation

100
0:06:21.42,000 --> 0:06:23,000
than they were already in.

101
0:06:24.2,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I'd have to rely on Free the Slaves to work

102
0:06:26.456,000 --> 0:06:28,000
within the system for their liberation,

103
0:06:29.298,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and I trusted that they would.

104
0:06:32.767,000 --> 0:06:35,000
As for me, I'd have to wait until I got home

105
0:06:36.204,000 --> 0:06:39,000
to really feel my heartbreak.

106
0:06:40.166,000 --> 0:06:42,000
In the Himalayas, I found children carrying stone

107
0:06:43.039,000 --> 0:06:45,000
for miles down mountainous terrain

108
0:06:45.789,000 --> 0:06:47,000
to trucks waiting at roads below.

109
0:06:48.687,000 --> 0:06:5,000
The big sheets of slate were heavier

110
0:06:51.205,000 --> 0:06:53,000
than the children carrying them,

111
0:06:53.871,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and the kids hoisted them from their heads

112
0:06:55.9,000 --> 0:06:59,000
using these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope

113
0:07:00.344,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and torn cloth.

114
0:07:02.191,000 --> 0:07:05,000
It's difficult to witness something so overwhelming.

115
0:07:05.866,000 --> 0:07:07,000
How can we affect something so insidious,

116
0:07:08.513,000 --> 0:07:11,000
yet so pervasive?

117
0:07:11.725,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Some don't even know they're enslaved,

118
0:07:14.437,000 --> 0:07:19,000
people working 16, 17 hours a day without any pay,

119
0:07:19.443,000 --> 0:07:22,000
because this has been the case all their lives.

120
0:07:22.656,000 --> 0:07:26,000
They have nothing to compare it to.

121
0:07:26.938,000 --> 0:07:29,000
When these villagers claimed their freedom,

122
0:07:30.312,000 --> 0:07:35,000
the slaveholders burned down all of their houses.

123
0:07:35.727,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I mean, these people had nothing,

124
0:07:37.689,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and they were so petrified, they wanted to give up,

125
0:07:41.338,000 --> 0:07:45,000
but the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere,

126
0:07:45.385,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and abolitionists on the ground

127
0:07:46.881,000 --> 0:07:48,000
helped them get a quarry lease of their own,

128
0:07:49.54,000 --> 0:07:52,000
so that now they do the same back-breaking work,

129
0:07:52.653,000 --> 0:07:56,000
but they do it for themselves, and they get paid for it,

130
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
and they do it in freedom.

131
0:08:00.583,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Sex trafficking is what we often think of

132
0:08:02.651,000 --> 0:08:03,000
when we hear the word slavery,

133
0:08:04.552,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and because of this worldwide awareness,

134
0:08:06.511,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I was warned that it would be difficult for me to work safely

135
0:08:09.647,000 --> 0:08:11,000
within this particular industry.

136
0:08:12.469,000 --> 0:08:14,000
In Kathmandu, I was escorted by women who had

137
0:08:15.311,000 --> 0:08:18,000
previously been sex slaves themselves.

138
0:08:18.847,000 --> 0:08:2,000
They ushered me down a narrow set of stairs

139
0:08:21.205,000 --> 0:08:26,000
that led to this dirty, dimly fluorescent lit basement.

140
0:08:26.818,000 --> 0:08:27,000
This wasn't a brothel, per se.

141
0:08:28.65,000 --> 0:08:3,000
It was more like a restaurant.

142
0:08:30.961,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Cabin restaurants, as they're known in the trade,

143
0:08:33.221,000 --> 0:08:35,000
are venues for forced prostitution.

144
0:08:35.843,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Each has small, private rooms, where the slaves,

145
0:08:38.875,000 --> 0:08:4,000
women, along with young girls and boys,

146
0:08:41.506,000 --> 0:08:43,000
some as young as seven years old,

147
0:08:44.285,000 --> 0:08:45,000
are forced to entertain the clients,

148
0:08:46.275,000 --> 0:08:49,000
encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol.

149
0:08:50.055,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Each cubicle is dark and dingy,

150
0:08:53.094,000 --> 0:08:56,000
identified with a painted number on the wall,

151
0:08:57.033,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and partitioned by plywood and a curtain.

152
0:09:01.138,000 --> 0:09:04,000
The workers here often endure tragic sexual abuse

153
0:09:04.689,000 --> 0:09:06,000
at the hands of their customers.

154
0:09:07.271,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Standing in the near darkness, I remember feeling

155
0:09:10.337,000 --> 0:09:14,000
this quick, hot fear, and in that instant,

156
0:09:14.423,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I could only imagine what it must be like

157
0:09:16.768,000 --> 0:09:18,000
to be trapped in that hell.

158
0:09:19.431,000 --> 0:09:23,000
I had only one way out: the stairs from where I'd come in.

159
0:09:24.033,000 --> 0:09:25,000
There were no back doors.

160
0:09:25.889,000 --> 0:09:27,000
There were no windows large enough to climb through.

161
0:09:28.432,000 --> 0:09:32,000
These people have no escape at all,

162
0:09:32.692,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and as we take in such a difficult subject,

163
0:09:35.752,000 --> 0:09:39,000
it's important to note that slavery, including sex trafficking,

164
0:09:40.363,000 --> 0:09:42,000
occurs in our own backyard as well.

165
0:09:43.292,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Tens of hundreds of people are enslaved in agriculture,

166
0:09:47.916,000 --> 0:09:49,000
in restaurants, in domestic servitude,

167
0:09:50.588,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and the list can go on.

168
0:09:53.22,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Recently, the New York Times reported that

169
0:09:55.859,000 --> 0:10:,000
between 100,000 and 300,000 American children

170
0:10:01.665,000 --> 0:10:04,000
are sold into sex slavery every year.

171
0:10:05.626,000 --> 0:10:11,000
It's all around us. We just don't see it.

172
0:10:12.169,000 --> 0:10:15,000
The textile industry is another one we often think of

173
0:10:15.551,000 --> 0:10:17,000
when we hear about slave labor.

174
0:10:18.437,000 --> 0:10:22,000
I visited villages in India where entire families were enslaved

175
0:10:22.76,000 --> 0:10:24,000
in the silk trade.

176
0:10:25.405,000 --> 0:10:27,000
This is a family portrait.

177
0:10:27.697,000 --> 0:10:3,000
The dyed black hands are the father, while the blue

178
0:10:31.585,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and red hands are his sons.

179
0:10:34.374,000 --> 0:10:36,000
They mix dye in these big barrels,

180
0:10:37.098,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and they submerge the silk into the liquid up to their elbows,

181
0:10:41.063,000 --> 0:10:45,000
but the dye is toxic.

182
0:10:46.025,000 --> 0:10:49,000
My interpreter told me their stories.

183
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
"We have no freedom," they said.

184
0:10:52.932,000 --> 0:10:55,000
"We hope still, though, that we could leave this house

185
0:10:56.036,000 --> 0:10:57,000
someday and go someplace else

186
0:10:57.69,000 --> 0:11:03,000
where we actually get paid for our dyeing."

187
0:11:04.354,000 --> 0:11:08,000
It's estimated that more than 4,000 children

188
0:11:09.293,000 --> 0:11:11,000
are enslaved on Lake Volta,

189
0:11:11.45,000 --> 0:11:15,000
the largest man-made lake in the world.

190
0:11:15.536,000 --> 0:11:17,000
When we first arrived, I went to have a quick look.

191
0:11:18.51,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat,

192
0:11:21.878,000 --> 0:11:25,000
two older brothers, some younger kids, makes sense right?

193
0:11:26.043,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Wrong. They were all enslaved.

194
0:11:30.091,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Children are taken from their families

195
0:11:32.92,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and trafficked and vanished,

196
0:11:35.427,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and they're forced to work endless hours on these boats

197
0:11:38.339,000 --> 0:11:42,000
on the lake, even though they do not know how to swim.

198
0:11:42.886,000 --> 0:11:44,000
This young child is eight years old.

199
0:11:45.221,000 --> 0:11:47,000
He was trembling when our boat approached,

200
0:11:47.877,000 --> 0:11:49,000
frightened it would run over his tiny canoe.

201
0:11:50.532,000 --> 0:11:53,000
He was petrified he would be knocked in the water.

202
0:11:53.871,000 --> 0:11:56,000
The skeletal tree limbs submerged in Lake Volta

203
0:11:57.156,000 --> 0:12:,000
often catch the fishing nets, and weary,

204
0:12:01.121,000 --> 0:12:04,000
frightened children are thrown into the water

205
0:12:04.854,000 --> 0:12:06,000
to untether the lines.

206
0:12:07.005,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Many of them drown.

207
0:12:09.852,000 --> 0:12:12,000
For as long as he can recall, he's been forced to work

208
0:12:13.192,000 --> 0:12:15,000
on the lake.

209
0:12:15.365,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Terrified of his master, he will not run away,

210
0:12:18.829,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and since he's been treated with cruelty all his life,

211
0:12:22.317,000 --> 0:12:24,000
he passes that down to the younger slaves

212
0:12:24.749,000 --> 0:12:27,000
that he manages.

213
0:12:27.754,000 --> 0:12:29,000
I met these boys at five in the morning,

214
0:12:29.858,000 --> 0:12:31,000
when they were hauling in the last of their nets,

215
0:12:32.319,000 --> 0:12:34,000
but they had been working since 1 a.m.

216
0:12:35.18,000 --> 0:12:38,000
in the cold, windy night.

217
0:12:38.755,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And it's important to note that these nets weigh

218
0:12:42.021,000 --> 0:12:46,000
more than a thousand pounds when they're full of fish.

219
0:12:46.437,000 --> 0:12:5,000
I want to introduce you to Kofi.

220
0:12:50.94,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Kofi was rescued from a fishing village.

221
0:12:54.186,000 --> 0:12:56,000
I met him at a shelter where Free the Slaves

222
0:12:56.778,000 --> 0:12:59,000
rehabilitates victims of slavery.

223
0:13:00.707,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Here he's seen taking a bath at the well,

224
0:13:02.788,000 --> 0:13:04,000
pouring big buckets of water over his head,

225
0:13:05.691,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and the wonderful news is,

226
0:13:07.612,000 --> 0:13:08,000
as you and I are sitting here talking today,

227
0:13:09.61,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Kofi has been reunited with his family,

228
0:13:12.845,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and what's even better, his family has been given tools

229
0:13:15.997,000 --> 0:13:2,000
to make a living and to keep their children safe.

230
0:13:21.724,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Kofi is the embodiment of possibility.

231
0:13:26.177,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Who will he become because someone took a stand

232
0:13:30.748,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and made a difference in his life?

233
0:13:34.34,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Driving down a road in Ghana

234
0:13:36.568,000 --> 0:13:38,000
with partners of Free the Slaves,

235
0:13:38.656,000 --> 0:13:41,000
a fellow abolitionist on a moped suddenly sped up

236
0:13:41.698,000 --> 0:13:43,000
to our cruiser and tapped on the window.

237
0:13:44.645,000 --> 0:13:48,000
He told us to follow him down a dirt road into the jungle.

238
0:13:49.425,000 --> 0:13:51,000
At the end of the road, he urged us out of the car,

239
0:13:52.214,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and told the driver to quickly leave.

240
0:13:54.893,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Then he pointed toward this barely visible footpath,

241
0:13:58.238,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and said, "This is the path, this is the path. Go."

242
0:14:02.135,000 --> 0:14:05,000
As we started down the path, we pushed aside the vines

243
0:14:05.804,000 --> 0:14:08,000
blocking the way, and after about an hour of walking in,

244
0:14:09.604,000 --> 0:14:14,000
found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains,

245
0:14:15.13,000 --> 0:14:16,000
so I hoisted the photo gear above my head

246
0:14:16.946,000 --> 0:14:2,000
as we descended into these waters up to my chest.

247
0:14:21.532,000 --> 0:14:24,000
After another two hours of hiking, the winding trail

248
0:14:25.317,000 --> 0:14:29,000
abruptly ended at a clearing, and before us

249
0:14:29.613,000 --> 0:14:31,000
was a mass of holes

250
0:14:31.629,000 --> 0:14:34,000
that could fit into the size of a football field,

251
0:14:35.449,000 --> 0:14:4,000
and all of them were full of enslaved people laboring.

252
0:14:41.043,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Many women had children strapped to their backs

253
0:14:44.188,000 --> 0:14:46,000
while they were panning for gold,

254
0:14:46.228,000 --> 0:14:5,000
wading in water poisoned by mercury.

255
0:14:50.531,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Mercury is used in the extraction process.

256
0:14:55.409,000 --> 0:14:58,000
These miners are enslaved in a mine shaft

257
0:14:58.565,000 --> 0:15:01,000
in another part of Ghana.

258
0:15:01.639,000 --> 0:15:03,000
When they came out of the shaft, they were soaking wet

259
0:15:04.46,000 --> 0:15:06,000
from their own sweat.

260
0:15:06.738,000 --> 0:15:1,000
I remember looking into their tired, bloodshot eyes,

261
0:15:10.741,000 --> 0:15:15,000
for many of them had been underground for 72 hours.

262
0:15:16.482,000 --> 0:15:19,000
The shafts are up to 300 feet deep, and they carry out

263
0:15:20.457,000 --> 0:15:23,000
heavy bags of stone that later will be transported

264
0:15:24.026,000 --> 0:15:26,000
to another area, where the stone will be pounded

265
0:15:26.627,000 --> 0:15:29,000
so that they can extract the gold.

266
0:15:30.572,000 --> 0:15:34,000
At first glance, the pounding site seems full

267
0:15:34.677,000 --> 0:15:38,000
of powerful men, but when we look closer,

268
0:15:39.57,000 --> 0:15:43,000
we see some less fortunate working on the fringes,

269
0:15:44.437,000 --> 0:15:46,000
and children too.

270
0:15:46.58,000 --> 0:15:53,000
All of them are victim to injury, illness and violence.

271
0:15:53.722,000 --> 0:15:56,000
In fact, it's very likely that this muscular person

272
0:15:57.702,000 --> 0:16:01,000
will end up like this one here, racked with tuberculosis

273
0:16:02.237,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and mercury poisoning in just a few years.

274
0:16:07.208,000 --> 0:16:11,000
This is Manuru. When his father died,

275
0:16:11.485,000 --> 0:16:14,000
his uncle trafficked him to work with him in the mines.

276
0:16:14.567,000 --> 0:16:18,000
When his uncle died, Manuru inherited his uncle's debt,

277
0:16:19.163,000 --> 0:16:23,000
which further forced him into being enslaved in the mines.

278
0:16:24.105,000 --> 0:16:26,000
When I met him, he had been working in the mines

279
0:16:26.938,000 --> 0:16:3,000
for 14 years, and the leg injury that you see here

280
0:16:31.731,000 --> 0:16:33,000
is actually from a mining accident,

281
0:16:33.744,000 --> 0:16:38,000
one so severe doctors say his leg should be amputated.

282
0:16:38.877,000 --> 0:16:41,000
On top of that, Manuru has tuberculosis,

283
0:16:42.827,000 --> 0:16:45,000
yet he's still forced to work day in and day out

284
0:16:45.871,000 --> 0:16:47,000
in that mine shaft.

285
0:16:48.115,000 --> 0:16:53,000
Even still, he has a dream that he will become free

286
0:16:53.278,000 --> 0:16:56,000
and become educated with the help of local activists

287
0:16:56.391,000 --> 0:16:58,000
like Free the Slaves,

288
0:16:58.819,000 --> 0:17:,000
and it's this sort of determination,

289
0:17:01.171,000 --> 0:17:04,000
in the face of unimaginable odds,

290
0:17:05.049,000 --> 0:17:12,000
that fills me with complete awe.

291
0:17:12.409,000 --> 0:17:15,000
I want to shine a light on slavery.

292
0:17:15.709,000 --> 0:17:17,000
When I was working in the field,

293
0:17:17.964,000 --> 0:17:19,000
I brought lots of candles with me,

294
0:17:20.645,000 --> 0:17:22,000
and with the help of my interpreter,

295
0:17:23.367,000 --> 0:17:25,000
I imparted to the people I was photographing

296
0:17:25.683,000 --> 0:17:28,000
that I wanted to illuminate their stories

297
0:17:28.794,000 --> 0:17:3,000
and their plight,

298
0:17:30.861,000 --> 0:17:33,000
so when it was safe for them, and safe for me,

299
0:17:34.366,000 --> 0:17:37,000
I made these images.

300
0:17:37.707,000 --> 0:17:39,000
They knew their image would be seen

301
0:17:39.94,000 --> 0:17:4,000
by you out in the world.

302
0:17:41.769,000 --> 0:17:44,000
I wanted them to know that we will be bearing witness

303
0:17:45.513,000 --> 0:17:48,000
to them, and that we will do whatever we can

304
0:17:49.442,000 --> 0:17:53,000
to help make a difference in their lives.

305
0:17:54.132,000 --> 0:17:57,000
I truly believe, if we can see one another

306
0:17:57.612,000 --> 0:18:01,000
as fellow human beings, then it becomes very difficult

307
0:18:02.096,000 --> 0:18:07,000
to tolerate atrocities like slavery.

308
0:18:07.3,000 --> 0:18:1,000
These images are not of issues. They are of people,

309
0:18:10.984,000 --> 0:18:13,000
real people, like you and me, all deserving

310
0:18:14.249,000 --> 0:18:17,000
of the same rights, dignity and respect

311
0:18:17.729,000 --> 0:18:19,000
in their lives.

312
0:18:19.958,000 --> 0:18:22,000
There is not a day that goes by that I don't think

313
0:18:23.193,000 --> 0:18:28,000
of these many beautiful, mistreated people

314
0:18:28.472,000 --> 0:18:32,000
I've had the tremendous honor of meeting.

315
0:18:33.041,000 --> 0:18:36,000
I hope that these images awaken a force

316
0:18:36.571,000 --> 0:18:39,000
in those who view them, people like you,

317
0:18:39.617,000 --> 0:18:43,000
and I hope that force will ignite a fire,

318
0:18:43.893,000 --> 0:18:47,000
and that fire will shine a light on slavery,

319
0:18:48.816,000 --> 0:18:52,000
for without that light, the beast of bondage

320
0:18:52.825,000 --> 0:18:55,000
can continue to live in the shadows.

321
0:18:56.009,000 --> 0:18:58,000
Thank you very much.

322
0:18:58.986,000 --> 0:19:11,000

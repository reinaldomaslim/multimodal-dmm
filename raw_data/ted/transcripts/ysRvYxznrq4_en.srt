1
0:00:13.042,000 --> 0:00:16,000
When I was a teen, I had terrible periods.

2
0:00:16.75,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I had crippling cramps,

3
0:00:18.5,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I leaked blood onto my clothes and onto my bed sheets,

4
0:00:22.333,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and I had period diarrhea.

5
0:00:24.792,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And I had to miss school one to two days a month,

6
0:00:27.792,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and I remember sitting on the couch with my heating pads, thinking,

7
0:00:32.333,000 --> 0:00:34,000
"What's up with this?"

8
0:00:34.917,000 --> 0:00:38,000
When I ate food, I didn't leak saliva from my salivary glands.

9
0:00:39.458,000 --> 0:00:4,000
When I went for a walk,

10
0:00:40.75,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I didn't leak fluid from my knees, "joint fluid."

11
0:00:44.125,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Why was menstruation so different?

12
0:00:48.375,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I wanted answers to these questions

13
0:00:50.375,000 --> 0:00:51,000
but there was no one for me to ask.

14
0:00:52.167,000 --> 0:00:54,000
My mother knew nothing about menstruation

15
0:00:54.375,000 --> 0:00:57,000
except that it was dirty and shameful and I shouldn't talk about it.

16
0:00:58.083,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I asked girlfriends

17
0:00:59.958,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and everybody spoke in euphemisms.

18
0:01:02.667,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And finally, when I got the courage to go to the doctor

19
0:01:05.917,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and talk about my heavy periods,

20
0:01:07.792,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I was told to eat liver.

21
0:01:09.917,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:12.25,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And when I went to the drug store to buy my menstrual products,

23
0:01:17.25,000 --> 0:01:2,000
my 48-pack of super maxi pads,

24
0:01:20.708,000 --> 0:01:23,000
back in the day when they were the size of a tissue box, each pad --

25
0:01:24.083,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:25.125,000 --> 0:01:26,000
You know what I'm talking about.

27
0:01:26.75,000 --> 0:01:28,000
You have no idea how far absorbent technology has come.

28
0:01:29.458,000 --> 0:01:31,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:31.792,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I used to have to buy my menstrual products

30
0:01:34.5,000 --> 0:01:37,000
in the feminine hygiene aisle.

31
0:01:37.917,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And I remember standing there, thinking,

32
0:01:39.917,000 --> 0:01:42,000
"Well, why don't I buy toilet paper in the anal hygiene aisle?"

33
0:01:42.958,000 --> 0:01:43,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Like, what's up with that?

35
0:01:45.292,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Why can't we talk about periods?

36
0:01:48.417,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And it's not about the blood, as Freud would have you say,

37
0:01:52.583,000 --> 0:01:53,000
because if it were,

38
0:01:53.875,000 --> 0:01:56,000
there would be an ear, nose and throat surgeon up here right now,

39
0:01:57.042,000 --> 0:01:59,000
talking about the taboos of nose bleeds, right?

40
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And it's not even about periods,

41
0:02:02.5,000 --> 0:02:05,000
because otherwise, when we got rid of our toxic, shameful periods

42
0:02:05.625,000 --> 0:02:06,000
when we became menopausal,

43
0:02:07.083,000 --> 0:02:09,000
we'd be elevated to a higher social status.

44
0:02:09.792,000 --> 0:02:11,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:12.083,000 --> 0:02:16,000
(Applause)

46
0:02:16.958,000 --> 0:02:19,000
It's just a patriarchal society is invested in oppressing women,

47
0:02:20.542,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and at different points in our lives, different things are used.

48
0:02:23.625,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And menstruation is used

49
0:02:24.917,000 --> 0:02:27,000
during what we in medicine call the reproductive years.

50
0:02:27.958,000 --> 0:02:3,000
It's been around since pretty much the beginning of time,

51
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:34,000
many cultures thought that women could spoil crops

52
0:02:34.083,000 --> 0:02:36,000
or milk, or wilt flowers.

53
0:02:36.792,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And then when religion came along,

54
0:02:38.542,000 --> 0:02:4,000
purity myths only made that worse.

55
0:02:41.167,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And medicine wasn't any help.

56
0:02:43.5,000 --> 0:02:44,000
In the 1920s and '30s

57
0:02:45.167,000 --> 0:02:49,000
there was the idea that women elaborated something called a menotoxin.

58
0:02:49.708,000 --> 0:02:51,000
We could wilt flowers just by walking by.

59
0:02:52.292,000 --> 0:02:53,000
(Laughter)

60
0:02:53.417,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And that's what happens when there's no diversity, right.

61
0:02:56.167,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Because there was no woman to put her hand up and go,

62
0:02:58.708,000 --> 0:03:,000
"Well, actually, that doesn't happen."

63
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And when you can't talk about what's happening to your body,

64
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:07,000
how do you break these myths?

65
0:03:07.042,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Because you don't even need to be a doctor

66
0:03:09.083,000 --> 0:03:1,000
to say that periods aren't toxic.

67
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:15,000
If they were, why would an embryo implant in a toxic swill?

68
0:03:16.708,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And if we all had this secret menotoxin,

69
0:03:20.292,000 --> 0:03:23,000
we could be laying waste to crops and spoiling milk.

70
0:03:23.583,000 --> 0:03:24,000
(Laughter)

71
0:03:24.625,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Why would we have not used our X-Women powers to get the vote sooner?

72
0:03:28.625,000 --> 0:03:3,000
(Laughter)

73
0:03:30.833,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Applause)

74
0:03:35.417,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Even now,

75
0:03:36.708,000 --> 0:03:38,000
when I tweet about period diarrhea,

76
0:03:38.958,000 --> 0:03:39,000
as one does,

77
0:03:40.25,000 --> 0:03:41,000
(Laughter)

78
0:03:42.208,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I mention that it affects 28 percent of women.

79
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And every single time, someone approaches me and says,

80
0:03:49.708,000 --> 0:03:52,000
"I thought I was the only one."

81
0:03:52.875,000 --> 0:03:54,000
That's how effective that culture of shame is,

82
0:03:55.542,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that women can't even share their experiences.

83
0:03:59.333,000 --> 0:04:,000
So I began to think,

84
0:04:00.792,000 --> 0:04:03,000
"Well, what if everybody knew about periods like a gynecologist?

85
0:04:04.167,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Wouldn't that be great?"

86
0:04:05.875,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Then you would all know what I know,

87
0:04:07.625,000 --> 0:04:08,000
you'd know that menstruation

88
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:11,000
is a pretty unique phenomenon among mammals.

89
0:04:11.5,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Most mammals have estrus.

90
0:04:13.5,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Humans, some primates,

91
0:04:16.333,000 --> 0:04:17,000
some bats,

92
0:04:17.625,000 --> 0:04:2,000
the elephant shrew and the spiny mouse menstruate.

93
0:04:20.875,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And with menstruation what happens is the brain triggers the ovary

94
0:04:24.375,000 --> 0:04:26,000
to start producing an egg.

95
0:04:26.5,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Estrogen is released

96
0:04:27.792,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and it starts to build up the lining of the uterus,

97
0:04:30.25,000 --> 0:04:32,000
cell upon cell, like bricks.

98
0:04:32.417,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And what happens if you build a brick wall too high without mortar?

99
0:04:35.625,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Well, it's unstable.

100
0:04:36.917,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So what happens when you ovulate?

101
0:04:38.542,000 --> 0:04:4,000
You release a hormone called progesterone,

102
0:04:40.708,000 --> 0:04:44,000
which is progestational, it gets the uterus ready.

103
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:48,000
It acts like a mortar and it holds those bricks together.

104
0:04:48.25,000 --> 0:04:5,000
It also causes some changes

105
0:04:50.667,000 --> 0:04:53,000
to make the lining more hospitable for implantation.

106
0:04:54.375,000 --> 0:04:55,000
If there's no pregnancy,

107
0:04:55.773,000 --> 0:04:55,000
(Whoosh)

108
0:04:56.602,000 --> 0:04:57,000
lining comes out,

109
0:04:57.875,000 --> 0:05:,000
there's bleeding from the blood vessels and that's the period.

110
0:05:01,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And I always find this point really interesting.

111
0:05:03.333,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Because with estrus,

112
0:05:04.875,000 --> 0:05:07,000
the final signaling to get the lining of the uterus ready

113
0:05:08.083,000 --> 0:05:1,000
actually comes from the embryo.

114
0:05:10.833,000 --> 0:05:11,000
But with menstruation,

115
0:05:12.667,000 --> 0:05:14,000
that choice comes from the ovary.

116
0:05:15.292,000 --> 0:05:18,000
It's as if choice is coded in to our reproductive tracts.

117
0:05:19.042,000 --> 0:05:25,000
(Cheering and applause)

118
0:05:27.625,000 --> 0:05:29,000
OK, so now we know why the blood is there.

119
0:05:30.208,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And it's a pretty significant amount.

120
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:34,000
It's 30 to 90 milliliters of blood,

121
0:05:34.042,000 --> 0:05:35,000
which is one to three ounces,

122
0:05:35.625,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and it can be more,

123
0:05:36.917,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and I know it seems like it's more a lot of the times.

124
0:05:40.042,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I know.

125
0:05:41.333,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So why do we have so much blood?

126
0:05:43.25,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And why doesn't it just stay there till the next cycle, right?

127
0:05:46.458,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Like, you didn't get pregnant, so why can't it hang around?

128
0:05:49.292,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Well imagine if each month it got thicker and thicker and thicker, right,

129
0:05:52.958,000 --> 0:05:54,000
like, imagine what tsunami period that would be.

130
0:05:55.708,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Laughter)

131
0:05:57.375,000 --> 0:05:59,000
We can't reabsorb it, because it's too much.

132
0:05:59.708,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And it's too much because we need a thick uterine lining

133
0:06:02.833,000 --> 0:06:04,000
for a very specific reason.

134
0:06:05.667,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Pregnancy exerts a significant biological toll on our bodies.

135
0:06:11.167,000 --> 0:06:12,000
There is maternal mortality,

136
0:06:12.833,000 --> 0:06:13,000
there is the toll of breastfeeding

137
0:06:14.5,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and there is the toll of raising a child until it is independent.

138
0:06:18.583,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And evolution --

139
0:06:19.875,000 --> 0:06:22,000
(Laughter)

140
0:06:22.917,000 --> 0:06:24,000
That goes on longer for some of us than others.

141
0:06:25.167,000 --> 0:06:27,000
(Laughter)

142
0:06:27.667,000 --> 0:06:3,000
But evolution knows about risk-benefit ratio.

143
0:06:31.125,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And so evolution wants to maximize the chance of a beneficial outcome.

144
0:06:35.75,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And how do you maximize the chance of a beneficial outcome?

145
0:06:38.583,000 --> 0:06:4,000
You try to get the highest quality embryos.

146
0:06:40.792,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And how do you get the highest quality embryos?

147
0:06:43.042,000 --> 0:06:44,000
You make them work for it.

148
0:06:44.917,000 --> 0:06:46,000
You give them an obstacle course.

149
0:06:47.375,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So over the millennia that we have evolved,

150
0:06:50.75,000 --> 0:06:52,000
it's been a little bit like an arms race in the uterus,

151
0:06:53.417,000 --> 0:06:55,000
the lining getting thicker and thicker and thicker,

152
0:06:55.917,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and the embryo getting more invasive

153
0:06:57.708,000 --> 0:06:58,000
until we reach this détente

154
0:06:59.209,000 --> 0:07:01,000
with the lining of the uterus that we have.

155
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So we have this thick uterine lining

156
0:07:03.75,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and now it's got to come out,

157
0:07:05.958,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and how do you stop bleeding?

158
0:07:08.083,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Well, you stop a nose bleed by pinching it,

159
0:07:10.5,000 --> 0:07:12,000
if you cut your leg, you put pressure on it.

160
0:07:12.833,000 --> 0:07:13,000
We stop bleeding with pressure.

161
0:07:14.708,000 --> 0:07:15,000
When we menstruate,

162
0:07:16.333,000 --> 0:07:18,000
the lining of the uterus releases substances

163
0:07:18.458,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that are made into chemicals called prostaglandins

164
0:07:21.5,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and other inflammatory mediators.

165
0:07:23.75,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And they make the uterus cramp down,

166
0:07:25.792,000 --> 0:07:27,000
they make it squeeze on those blood vessels

167
0:07:27.875,000 --> 0:07:28,000
to stop the bleeding.

168
0:07:29.583,000 --> 0:07:31,000
They might also change blood flow to the uterus

169
0:07:31.798,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and also cause inflammation and that makes pain worse.

170
0:07:34.875,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And so you say, "OK, how much pressure is generated?"

171
0:07:38.375,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And from studies where some incredible women

172
0:07:41.458,000 --> 0:07:43,000
have volunteered to have pressure catheters

173
0:07:43.5,000 --> 0:07:44,000
put in their uterus

174
0:07:44.792,000 --> 0:07:46,000
that they wear their whole menstrual cycle --

175
0:07:47.125,000 --> 0:07:5,000
God bless them, because we wouldn't have this knowledge without,

176
0:07:50.292,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and it's very important knowledge,

177
0:07:52.25,000 --> 0:07:54,000
because the pressure that's generated in the uterus

178
0:07:55.083,000 --> 0:07:56,000
during menstruation

179
0:07:56.375,000 --> 0:07:58,000
is 120 millimeters of mercury.

180
0:07:58.5,000 --> 0:07:59,000
"Well what's that," you say.

181
0:07:59.917,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Well, it's the amount of pressure that's generated

182
0:08:02.75,000 --> 0:08:04,000
during the second stage of labor when you're pushing.

183
0:08:05.292,000 --> 0:08:06,000
(Audience gasps)

184
0:08:06.458,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Right.

185
0:08:07.75,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Which, for those of you who haven't had an unmedicated delivery,

186
0:08:10.917,000 --> 0:08:12,000
that's what it's like when the blood pressure cuff

187
0:08:13.333,000 --> 0:08:15,000
is not quite as tight as it was at the beginning,

188
0:08:15.643,000 --> 0:08:16,000
but it's still pretty tight,

189
0:08:17.042,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and you wish it would stop.

190
0:08:18.417,000 --> 0:08:2,000
So that kind of makes it different, right?

191
0:08:20.583,000 --> 0:08:23,000
If you start thinking about the pain of menstruation,

192
0:08:24.5,000 --> 0:08:26,000
we wouldn't say if someone needed to miss school

193
0:08:27.125,000 --> 0:08:29,000
because they were in the second stage of labor and pushing,

194
0:08:29.958,000 --> 0:08:3,000
we wouldn't call them weak.

195
0:08:31.333,000 --> 0:08:33,000
We'd be like, "Oh my God, you made it that far," right?

196
0:08:34.125,000 --> 0:08:35,000
(Laughter)

197
0:08:35.167,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And we wouldn't deny pain control

198
0:08:37.625,000 --> 0:08:4,000
to women who have typical pain of labor, right?

199
0:08:41.125,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So it's important for us to call this pain "typical" instead of "normal,"

200
0:08:44.583,000 --> 0:08:46,000
because when we say it's normal, it's easier to dismiss.

201
0:08:47.542,000 --> 0:08:5,000
As opposed to saying it's typical, and we should address it.

202
0:08:51.042,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And we do have some ways to address menstrual pain.

203
0:08:55.542,000 --> 0:08:57,000
One way is with something called a TENS unit,

204
0:08:57.667,000 --> 0:08:58,000
which you can wear under your clothes

205
0:08:59.5,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and it sends an electrical impulse to the nerves and muscles

206
0:09:02.625,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and no one really knows how it works,

207
0:09:04.458,000 --> 0:09:06,000
but we think it might be the gate theory of pain,

208
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:08,000
which is counterirritation.

209
0:09:08.583,000 --> 0:09:11,000
It's the same reason why, if you hurt yourself, you rub it.

210
0:09:12.375,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Vibration travels faster to your brain than pain does.

211
0:09:16.208,000 --> 0:09:17,000
We also have medications

212
0:09:17.583,000 --> 0:09:19,000
called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications.

213
0:09:20.375,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And what they do is they block the release of prostaglandins.

214
0:09:24.167,000 --> 0:09:27,000
They can reduce menstrual pain for 80 percent of women.

215
0:09:28.083,000 --> 0:09:31,000
They also reduce the volume of blood by 30 to 40 percent

216
0:09:31.875,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and they can help with period diarrhea.

217
0:09:34.292,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And we also have hormonal contraception,

218
0:09:36.875,000 --> 0:09:38,000
which gives us a thinner lining of the uterus,

219
0:09:39.167,000 --> 0:09:41,000
so there's less prostaglandins produced

220
0:09:41.5,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and with less blood, there's less need for cramping.

221
0:09:44.875,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Now, if those treatments fail you --

222
0:09:47.667,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and it's important to use that word choice,

223
0:09:49.917,000 --> 0:09:51,000
because we never fail the treatment,

224
0:09:52.333,000 --> 0:09:54,000
the treatment fails us.

225
0:09:54.958,000 --> 0:09:56,000
If that treatment fails you,

226
0:09:57.125,000 --> 0:09:58,000
you could be amongst the people

227
0:09:58.626,000 --> 0:10:02,000
who have a resistance to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories.

228
0:10:02.708,000 --> 0:10:03,000
We don't quite understand,

229
0:10:04.292,000 --> 0:10:06,000
but there are some complex mechanisms

230
0:10:06.417,000 --> 0:10:09,000
why those medications just don't work for some women.

231
0:10:1,000 --> 0:10:13,000
It's also possible that you could have

232
0:10:13.333,000 --> 0:10:15,000
another reason for painful periods.

233
0:10:15.75,000 --> 0:10:17,000
You could have a condition called endometriosis,

234
0:10:18.458,000 --> 0:10:21,000
where the lining of the uterus is growing in the pelvic cavity,

235
0:10:21.542,000 --> 0:10:24,000
causing inflammation and scar tissue and adhesions.

236
0:10:25.125,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And there may be other mechanisms we don't quite understand yet,

237
0:10:28.542,000 --> 0:10:31,000
because it's a possibility that pain thresholds could be different

238
0:10:31.75,000 --> 0:10:33,000
due to very complex biological mechanisms.

239
0:10:34.458,000 --> 0:10:37,000
But we're only going to find that out by talking about it.

240
0:10:37.667,000 --> 0:10:4,000
It shouldn't be an act of feminism

241
0:10:40.792,000 --> 0:10:42,000
to know how your body works.

242
0:10:42.958,000 --> 0:10:43,000
It shouldn't --

243
0:10:44.25,000 --> 0:10:49,000
(Applause)

244
0:10:49.792,000 --> 0:10:52,000
It shouldn't be an act of feminism

245
0:10:53.292,000 --> 0:10:55,000
to ask for help when you're suffering.

246
0:10:57.25,000 --> 0:11:01,000
The era of menstrual taboos is over.

247
0:11:02.583,000 --> 0:11:06,000
(Cheers and applause)

248
0:11:07.333,000 --> 0:11:09,000
The only curse here

249
0:11:09.5,000 --> 0:11:12,000
is the ability to convince half the population

250
0:11:13.125,000 --> 0:11:17,000
that the very biological machinery that perpetuates the species,

251
0:11:17.542,000 --> 0:11:19,000
that gives everything that we have,

252
0:11:20.042,000 --> 0:11:22,000
is somehow dirty or toxic.

253
0:11:22.625,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And I'm not going to stand for it.

254
0:11:25.208,000 --> 0:11:3,000
(Applause)

255
0:11:30.917,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And the way we break that curse?

256
0:11:33.375,000 --> 0:11:34,000
It's knowledge.

257
0:11:34.958,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Thank you.

258
0:11:36.25,000 --> 0:11:41,000
(Cheers and applause)

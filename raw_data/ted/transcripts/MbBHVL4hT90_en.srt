1
0:00:13.721,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I have a confession to make.

2
0:00:16.181,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I am addicted to adventure,

3
0:00:19.42,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and as a young boy,

4
0:00:21.859,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I would rather look outside the window

5
0:00:24.367,000 --> 0:00:26,000
at the birds in the trees and the sky

6
0:00:27.101,000 --> 0:00:29,000
than looking at that two-dimensional

7
0:00:29.237,000 --> 0:00:32,000
chalky blackboard where time stands still

8
0:00:33.208,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and even sometimes dies.

9
0:00:35.953,000 --> 0:00:36,000
My teachers thought there was something wrong

10
0:00:37.763,000 --> 0:00:4,000
with me because I wasn't paying attention in class.

11
0:00:41.15,000 --> 0:00:43,000
They didn't find anything specifically wrong with me,

12
0:00:43.17,000 --> 0:00:47,000
other than being slightly dyslexic because I'm a lefty.

13
0:00:47.692,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But they didn't test for curiosity.

14
0:00:51.807,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Curiosity, to me,

15
0:00:54.388,000 --> 0:00:55,000
is about our connection

16
0:00:56.361,000 --> 0:00:59,000
with the world, with the universe.

17
0:00:59.606,000 --> 0:01:,000
It's about seeing what's around that next coral head

18
0:01:01.496,000 --> 0:01:02,000
or what's around that next tree,

19
0:01:03.195,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and learning more not only about our environment

20
0:01:05.254,000 --> 0:01:07,000
but about ourselves.

21
0:01:07.324,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Now, my dream of dreams,

22
0:01:09.854,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I want to go explore the oceans of Mars,

23
0:01:13.128,000 --> 0:01:15,000
but until we can go there,

24
0:01:15.974,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I think the oceans still hold

25
0:01:19.44,000 --> 0:01:2,000
quite a few secrets.

26
0:01:20.879,000 --> 0:01:21,000
As a matter of fact,

27
0:01:22.243,000 --> 0:01:25,000
if you take our planet as the oasis in space that it is

28
0:01:25.798,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and dissect it into a living space,

29
0:01:29.429,000 --> 0:01:32,000
the ocean represents over 3.4 billion

30
0:01:32.824,000 --> 0:01:34,000
cubic kilometers of volume, within which

31
0:01:35.311,000 --> 0:01:39,000
we've explored less than five percent.

32
0:01:39.821,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And I look at this, and I go, well,

33
0:01:42.08,000 --> 0:01:45,000
there are tools to go deeper, longer and further:

34
0:01:45.446,000 --> 0:01:5,000
submarines, ROVs, even Scuba diving.

35
0:01:50.659,000 --> 0:01:52,000
But if we're going to explore the final frontier

36
0:01:53.267,000 --> 0:01:56,000
on this planet, we need to live there.

37
0:01:56.754,000 --> 0:01:58,000
We need to build a log cabin, if you will,

38
0:01:59.352,000 --> 0:02:02,000
at the bottom of the sea.

39
0:02:02.412,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And so there was a great curiosity in my soul

40
0:02:05.378,000 --> 0:02:07,000
when I went to go visit a TED [Prize winner]

41
0:02:08.145,000 --> 0:02:09,000
by the name of Dr. Sylvia Earle.

42
0:02:09.58,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Maybe you've heard of her.

43
0:02:11.064,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Two years ago, she was staked out

44
0:02:14.84,000 --> 0:02:16,000
at the last undersea marine laboratory

45
0:02:17.684,000 --> 0:02:18,000
to try and save it,

46
0:02:19.667,000 --> 0:02:2,000
to try and petition

47
0:02:21.355,000 --> 0:02:22,000
for us not to scrap it

48
0:02:23.145,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and bring it back on land.

49
0:02:25.546,000 --> 0:02:26,000
We've only had about a dozen or so

50
0:02:27.458,000 --> 0:02:29,000
scientific labs at the bottom of the sea.

51
0:02:29.888,000 --> 0:02:3,000
There's only one left in the world:

52
0:02:31.8,000 --> 0:02:32,000
it's nine miles offshore

53
0:02:33.021,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and 65 feet down.

54
0:02:35.355,000 --> 0:02:36,000
It's called Aquarius.

55
0:02:37.01,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Aquarius, in some fashion,

56
0:02:39.382,000 --> 0:02:41,000
is a dinosaur,

57
0:02:41.631,000 --> 0:02:43,000
an ancient robot chained to the bottom,

58
0:02:43.971,000 --> 0:02:46,000
this Leviathan.

59
0:02:47.391,000 --> 0:02:49,000
In other ways, it's a legacy.

60
0:02:49.546,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And so with that visit, I realized that my time is short

61
0:02:52.43,000 --> 0:02:54,000
if I wanted to experience

62
0:02:54.681,000 --> 0:02:59,000
what it was like to become an aquanaut.

63
0:02:59.708,000 --> 0:03:01,000
When we swam towards this after many

64
0:03:02.194,000 --> 0:03:04,000
moons of torture and two years of preparation,

65
0:03:04.94,000 --> 0:03:08,000
this habitat waiting to invite us

66
0:03:09.909,000 --> 0:03:12,000
was like a new home.

67
0:03:12.925,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And the point of going down to

68
0:03:15.12,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and living at this habitat was not to stay inside.

69
0:03:18.967,000 --> 0:03:2,000
It wasn't about living at something the size of a school bus.

70
0:03:21.566,000 --> 0:03:24,000
It was about giving us the luxury of time

71
0:03:24.772,000 --> 0:03:27,000
outside to wander, to explore,

72
0:03:27.821,000 --> 0:03:3,000
to understand more about this oceanic final frontier.

73
0:03:31.704,000 --> 0:03:33,000
We had megafauna come and visit us.

74
0:03:34.011,000 --> 0:03:37,000
This spotted eagle ray is a fairly common sight in the oceans.

75
0:03:37.551,000 --> 0:03:39,000
But why this is so important,

76
0:03:40.183,000 --> 0:03:41,000
why this picture is up,

77
0:03:41.758,000 --> 0:03:44,000
is because this particular animal brought his friends around,

78
0:03:45.223,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and instead of being the pelagic animals that they were,

79
0:03:48.37,000 --> 0:03:49,000
they started getting curious about us,

80
0:03:49.76,000 --> 0:03:52,000
these new strangers that were moving into the neighborhood,

81
0:03:53.749,000 --> 0:03:55,000
doing things with plankton.

82
0:03:56.268,000 --> 0:03:58,000
We were studying all sorts of animals and critters,

83
0:03:58.97,000 --> 0:04:,000
and they got closer and closer to us,

84
0:04:01.457,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and because of the luxury of time,

85
0:04:03.239,000 --> 0:04:05,000
these animals, these residents of the coral reef,

86
0:04:05.59,000 --> 0:04:06,000
were starting to get used to us,

87
0:04:07.004,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and these pelagics that normal travel through stopped.

88
0:04:10.681,000 --> 0:04:12,000
This particular animal actually circled

89
0:04:13.184,000 --> 0:04:17,000
for 31 full days during our mission.

90
0:04:17.335,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So mission 31 wasn't so much

91
0:04:19.675,000 --> 0:04:2,000
about breaking records.

92
0:04:21.587,000 --> 0:04:25,000
It was about that human-ocean connection.

93
0:04:26.021,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Because of the luxury of time, we were able

94
0:04:28.175,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to study animals such as sharks and grouper

95
0:04:32.134,000 --> 0:04:34,000
in aggregations that we've never seen before.

96
0:04:34.384,000 --> 0:04:38,000
It's like seeing dogs and cats behaving well together.

97
0:04:38.97,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Even being able to commune with animals

98
0:04:40.745,000 --> 0:04:41,000
that are much larger than us,

99
0:04:41.872,000 --> 0:04:43,000
such as this endangered goliath grouper

100
0:04:44.634,000 --> 0:04:47,000
who only still resides in the Florida Keys.

101
0:04:47.896,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Of course, just like any neighbor,

102
0:04:50.205,000 --> 0:04:52,000
after a while, if they get tired,

103
0:04:52.725,000 --> 0:04:53,000
the goliath grouper barks at us,

104
0:04:54.345,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and this bark is so powerful

105
0:04:56.141,000 --> 0:04:58,000
that it actually stuns its prey before it aspirates it all

106
0:04:58.8,000 --> 0:04:59,000
within a split second.

107
0:05:00.769,000 --> 0:05:01,000
For us, it's just telling us to go back

108
0:05:02.286,000 --> 0:05:06,000
into the habitat and leave them alone.

109
0:05:06.918,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Now, this wasn't just about adventure.

110
0:05:10.149,000 --> 0:05:11,000
There was actually a serious note to it.

111
0:05:11.978,000 --> 0:05:14,000
We did a lot of science, and again, because of the luxury of time,

112
0:05:15.279,000 --> 0:05:17,000
we were able to do over three years of science

113
0:05:17.845,000 --> 0:05:19,000
in 31 days.

114
0:05:20.306,000 --> 0:05:22,000
In this particular case, we were using a PAM,

115
0:05:22.522,000 --> 0:05:23,000
or, let me just see if I can get this straight,

116
0:05:24.243,000 --> 0:05:28,000
a Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorometer.

117
0:05:28.262,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And our scientists from FIU, MIT,

118
0:05:31.465,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and from Northeastern

119
0:05:33.52,000 --> 0:05:35,000
were able to get a gauge for what coral reefs do

120
0:05:36.493,000 --> 0:05:37,000
when we're not around.

121
0:05:38.181,000 --> 0:05:4,000
The Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorometer, or PAM,

122
0:05:40.734,000 --> 0:05:42,000
gauges the fluorescence of corals

123
0:05:43.24,000 --> 0:05:45,000
as it pertains to pollutants in the water

124
0:05:45.717,000 --> 0:05:48,000
as well as climate change-related issues.

125
0:05:49.103,000 --> 0:05:52,000
We used all sorts of other cutting-edge tools,

126
0:05:52.601,000 --> 0:05:54,000
such as this sonde, or what I like to call

127
0:05:54.93,000 --> 0:06:,000
the sponge proctologist, whereby the sonde

128
0:06:01.084,000 --> 0:06:03,000
itself tests for metabolism rates

129
0:06:03.887,000 --> 0:06:06,000
in what in this particular case is a barrel sponge,

130
0:06:06.987,000 --> 0:06:08,000
or the redwoods of the [ocean].

131
0:06:09.338,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And this gives us a much better gauge

132
0:06:10.61,000 --> 0:06:12,000
of what's happening underwater

133
0:06:12.928,000 --> 0:06:14,000
with regard to climate change-related issues,

134
0:06:15.863,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and how the dynamics of that

135
0:06:17.651,000 --> 0:06:19,000
affect us here on land.

136
0:06:20.261,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And finally, we looked at predator-prey behavior.

137
0:06:22.743,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And predator-prey behavior is an interesting thing,

138
0:06:24.671,000 --> 0:06:26,000
because as we take away some of the predators

139
0:06:27.168,000 --> 0:06:29,000
on these coral reefs around the world,

140
0:06:29.339,000 --> 0:06:32,000
the prey, or the forage fish, act very differently.

141
0:06:32.904,000 --> 0:06:33,000
What we realized is

142
0:06:34.558,000 --> 0:06:37,000
not only do they stop taking care of the reef,

143
0:06:37.741,000 --> 0:06:38,000
darting in, grabbing a little bit of algae

144
0:06:39.665,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and going back into their homes,

145
0:06:41.184,000 --> 0:06:42,000
they start spreading out and disappearing

146
0:06:43.163,000 --> 0:06:45,000
from those particular coral reefs.

147
0:06:45.278,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Well, within that 31 days,

148
0:06:47.606,000 --> 0:06:49,000
we were able to generate over 10 scientific papers

149
0:06:50.295,000 --> 0:06:53,000
on each one of these topics.

150
0:06:53.426,000 --> 0:06:57,000
But the point of adventure is not only to learn,

151
0:06:58.132,000 --> 0:07:,000
it's to be able to share that knowledge with the world,

152
0:07:00.525,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and with that, thanks to a couple of engineers at MIT,

153
0:07:04.507,000 --> 0:07:07,000
we were able to use a prototype camera called the Edgertronic

154
0:07:07.84,000 --> 0:07:1,000
to capture slow-motion video,

155
0:07:10.901,000 --> 0:07:12,000
up to 20,000 frames per second

156
0:07:13.673,000 --> 0:07:14,000
in a little box

157
0:07:15.052,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that's worth 3,000 dollars.

158
0:07:16.693,000 --> 0:07:18,000
It's available to every one of us.

159
0:07:18.937,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And that particular camera gives us an insight

160
0:07:21.655,000 --> 0:07:23,000
into what fairly common animals do

161
0:07:24.28,000 --> 0:07:26,000
but we can't even see it in the blink of an eye.

162
0:07:26.526,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Let me show you a quick video

163
0:07:28.836,000 --> 0:07:3,000
of what this camera does.

164
0:07:30.906,000 --> 0:07:32,000
You can see the silky bubble come out

165
0:07:33.741,000 --> 0:07:35,000
of our hard hats.

166
0:07:35.92,000 --> 0:07:37,000
It gives us an insight

167
0:07:38.252,000 --> 0:07:4,000
into some of the animals that we were sitting

168
0:07:40.613,000 --> 0:07:41,000
right next to for 31 days

169
0:07:42.571,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and never normally would have paid attention to,

170
0:07:45.28,000 --> 0:07:46,000
such as hermit crabs.

171
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Now, using a cutting-edge piece of technology

172
0:07:50.175,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that's not really meant for the oceans

173
0:07:52.3,000 --> 0:07:54,000
is not always easy.

174
0:07:54.444,000 --> 0:07:56,000
We sometimes had to put the camera upside down,

175
0:07:56.992,000 --> 0:07:58,000
cordon it back to the lab,

176
0:07:59.552,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and actually man the trigger

177
0:08:02.073,000 --> 0:08:04,000
from the lab itself.

178
0:08:04.247,000 --> 0:08:06,000
But what this gives us

179
0:08:06.441,000 --> 0:08:08,000
is the foresight to look at and analyze

180
0:08:09.275,000 --> 0:08:12,000
in scientific and engineering terms

181
0:08:12.482,000 --> 0:08:15,000
some of the most amazing behavior

182
0:08:15.646,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that the human eye just can't pick up,

183
0:08:16.901,000 --> 0:08:19,000
such as this manta shrimp

184
0:08:19.95,000 --> 0:08:2,000
trying to catch its prey,

185
0:08:21.718,000 --> 0:08:26,000
within about .3 seconds.

186
0:08:27.217,000 --> 0:08:3,000
That punch is as strong as a .22 caliber bullet,

187
0:08:30.312,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and if you ever try to catch a bullet

188
0:08:31.657,000 --> 0:08:35,000
in mid-flight with your eye, impossible.

189
0:08:35.675,000 --> 0:08:36,000
But now we can see things

190
0:08:36.978,000 --> 0:08:38,000
such as these Christmas tree worms

191
0:08:39.648,000 --> 0:08:42,000
pulling in and fanning out

192
0:08:42.809,000 --> 0:08:45,000
in a way that the eye just can't capture,

193
0:08:45.845,000 --> 0:08:46,000
or in this case,

194
0:08:47.219,000 --> 0:08:54,000
a fish throwing up grains of sand.

195
0:08:54.28,000 --> 0:08:56,000
This is an actual sailfin goby,

196
0:08:56.67,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and if you look at it in real time,

197
0:08:59.186,000 --> 0:09:02,000
it actually doesn't even show its fanning motion

198
0:09:02.191,000 --> 0:09:05,000
because it's so quick.

199
0:09:05.362,000 --> 0:09:07,000
One of the most precious gifts that we had underwater

200
0:09:07.634,000 --> 0:09:09,000
is that we had WiFi,

201
0:09:09.974,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and for 31 days straight we were able to connect

202
0:09:12.19,000 --> 0:09:14,000
with the world in real time from the bottom of the sea

203
0:09:14.903,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and share all of these experiences.

204
0:09:16.735,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Quite literally right there

205
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I am Skyping in the classroom

206
0:09:19.306,000 --> 0:09:21,000
with one of the six continents

207
0:09:21.324,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and some of the 70,000 students that we connected

208
0:09:24.28,000 --> 0:09:26,000
every single day to some of these experiences.

209
0:09:27.07,000 --> 0:09:29,000
As a matter of fact, I'm showing a picture that I took

210
0:09:29.333,000 --> 0:09:31,000
with my smartphone from underwater

211
0:09:31.977,000 --> 0:09:33,000
of a goliath grouper laying on the bottom.

212
0:09:34.508,000 --> 0:09:39,000
We had never seen that before.

213
0:09:39.532,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And I dream of the day

214
0:09:41.349,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that we have underwater cities,

215
0:09:43.844,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and maybe, just maybe, if we push the boundaries

216
0:09:46.409,000 --> 0:09:47,000
of adventure and knowledge,

217
0:09:48.343,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and we share that knowledge with others out there,

218
0:09:51.584,000 --> 0:09:54,000
we can solve all sorts of problems.

219
0:09:54.731,000 --> 0:09:55,000
My grandfather used to say,

220
0:09:56.189,000 --> 0:09:58,000
"People protect what they love."

221
0:09:59.142,000 --> 0:10:01,000
My father, "How can people protect

222
0:10:01.741,000 --> 0:10:05,000
what they don't understand?"

223
0:10:06.665,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And I've thought about this my whole life.

224
0:10:10.706,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Nothing is impossible.

225
0:10:14.014,000 --> 0:10:17,000
We need to dream, we need to be creative,

226
0:10:17.197,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and we all need to have an adventure

227
0:10:19.57,000 --> 0:10:22,000
in order to create miracles in the darkest of times.

228
0:10:23.221,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And whether it's about climate change

229
0:10:25.858,000 --> 0:10:27,000
or eradicating poverty

230
0:10:28.355,000 --> 0:10:29,000
or giving back to future generations

231
0:10:29.998,000 --> 0:10:31,000
what we've taken for granted,

232
0:10:32.596,000 --> 0:10:34,000
it's about adventure.

233
0:10:34.61,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And who knows, maybe there will be underwater cities,

234
0:10:37.298,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and maybe some of you

235
0:10:38.38,000 --> 0:10:4,000
will become the future aquanauts.

236
0:10:40.988,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Thank you very much.

237
0:10:42.866,000 --> 0:10:45,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:24.7,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I thought in getting up to my TED wish

2
0:00:30.7,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I would try to begin by putting in perspective what I try to do

3
0:00:37.7,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and how it fits with what they try to do.

4
0:00:41.7,000 --> 0:00:46,000
We live in a world that everyone knows is interdependent,

5
0:00:46.7,000 --> 0:00:52,000
but insufficient in three major ways.

6
0:00:52.7,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It is, first of all, profoundly unequal:

7
0:00:55.7,000 --> 0:00:59,000
half the world's people still living on less than two dollars a day;

8
0:00:59.7,000 --> 0:01:01,000
a billion people with no access to clean water;

9
0:01:01.7,000 --> 0:01:04,000
two and a half billion no access to sanitation;

10
0:01:04.7,000 --> 0:01:06,000
a billion going to bed hungry every night;

11
0:01:06.7,000 --> 0:01:11,000
one in four deaths every year from AIDS, TB, malaria

12
0:01:11.7,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and the variety of infections associated with dirty water --

13
0:01:15.7,000 --> 0:01:18,000
80 percent of them under five years of age.

14
0:01:18.7,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Even in wealthy countries it is common now to see inequality growing.

15
0:01:24.7,000 --> 0:01:29,000
In the United States, since 2001 we've had five years of economic growth,

16
0:01:29.7,000 --> 0:01:32,000
five years of productivity growth in the workplace,

17
0:01:32.7,000 --> 0:01:36,000
but median wages are stagnant and the percentage of working families

18
0:01:36.7,000 --> 0:01:4,000
dropping below the poverty line is up by four percent.

19
0:01:40.7,000 --> 0:01:44,000
The percentage of working families without health care up by four percent.

20
0:01:44.7,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So this interdependent world which has been pretty good to most of us --

21
0:01:48.7,000 --> 0:01:52,000
which is why we're all here in Northern California doing what we do

22
0:01:52.7,000 --> 0:01:57,000
for a living, enjoying this evening -- is profoundly unequal.

23
0:01:57.7,000 --> 0:02:,000
It is also unstable.

24
0:02:00.7,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Unstable because of the threats of terror,

25
0:02:04.7,000 --> 0:02:07,000
weapons of mass destruction, the spread of global disease

26
0:02:07.7,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and a sense that we are vulnerable to it in a way that we weren't not so many years ago.

27
0:02:14.7,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And perhaps most important of all, it is unsustainable

28
0:02:18.7,000 --> 0:02:24,000
because of climate change, resource depletion and species destruction.

29
0:02:26.7,000 --> 0:02:3,000
When I think about the world I would like to leave to my daughter

30
0:02:30.7,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and the grandchildren I hope to have,

31
0:02:32.7,000 --> 0:02:39,000
it is a world that moves away from unequal, unstable, unsustainable

32
0:02:39.7,000 --> 0:02:44,000
interdependence to integrated communities -- locally, nationally and globally --

33
0:02:44.7,000 --> 0:02:47,000
that share the characteristics of all successful communities:

34
0:02:47.7,000 --> 0:02:52,000
a broadly shared, accessible set of opportunities,

35
0:02:53.7,000 --> 0:02:57,000
a shared sense of responsibility for the success of the common enterprise

36
0:02:57.7,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and a genuine sense of belonging.

37
0:03:03.7,000 --> 0:03:06,000
All easier said than done.

38
0:03:06.7,000 --> 0:03:12,000
When the terrorist incidents occurred in the United Kingdom a couple of years ago,

39
0:03:12.7,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I think even though they didn't claim as many lives as we lost in the United States on 9/11,

40
0:03:17.7,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I think the thing that troubled the British most

41
0:03:19.7,000 --> 0:03:24,000
was that the perpetrators were not invaders, but homegrown citizens

42
0:03:24.7,000 --> 0:03:29,000
whose religious and political identities were more important to them

43
0:03:29.7,000 --> 0:03:32,000
than the people they grew up with, went to school with,

44
0:03:32.7,000 --> 0:03:35,000
worked with, shared weekends with, shared meals with.

45
0:03:35.7,000 --> 0:03:38,000
In other words, they thought their differences

46
0:03:38.7,000 --> 0:03:42,000
were more important than their common humanity.

47
0:03:42.7,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It is the central psychological plague of humankind in the 21st century.

48
0:03:49.7,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Into this mix, people like us, who are not in public office,

49
0:03:54.7,000 --> 0:03:59,000
have more power to do good than at any time in history,

50
0:03:59.7,000 --> 0:04:01,000
because more than half the world's people

51
0:04:01.7,000 --> 0:04:04,000
live under governments they voted in and can vote out.

52
0:04:04.7,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And even non-democratic governments are more sensitive to public opinion.

53
0:04:08.7,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Because primarily of the power of the Internet,

54
0:04:13.7,000 --> 0:04:19,000
people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money

55
0:04:19.7,000 --> 0:04:23,000
that can change the world for some public good if they all agree.

56
0:04:23.7,000 --> 0:04:28,000
When the tsunami hit South Asia, the United States contributed 1.2 billion dollars.

57
0:04:28.7,000 --> 0:04:3,000
30 percent of our households gave.

58
0:04:30.7,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Half of them gave over the Internet.

59
0:04:32.7,000 --> 0:04:37,000
The median contribution was somewhere around 57 dollars.

60
0:04:38.7,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And thirdly, because of the rise of non-governmental organizations.

61
0:04:43.7,000 --> 0:04:49,000
They, businesses, other citizens' groups, have enormous power

62
0:04:49.7,000 --> 0:04:53,000
to affect the lives of our fellow human beings.

63
0:04:54.7,000 --> 0:04:56,000
When I became president in 1993,

64
0:04:56.7,000 --> 0:04:58,000
there were none of these organizations in Russia.

65
0:04:58.7,000 --> 0:05:,000
There are now a couple of hundred thousand.

66
0:05:00.7,000 --> 0:05:04,000
None in India. There are now at least a half a million active.

67
0:05:04.7,000 --> 0:05:07,000
None in China. There are now 250,000 registered with the government,

68
0:05:07.7,000 --> 0:05:12,000
probably twice again that many who are not registered for political reasons.

69
0:05:13.7,000 --> 0:05:21,000
When I organized my foundation, and I thought about the world as it is

70
0:05:21.7,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and the world that I hope to leave to the next generation,

71
0:05:26.7,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and I tried to be realistic about what I had cared about all my life

72
0:05:33.7,000 --> 0:05:35,000
that I could still have an impact on.

73
0:05:35.7,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I wanted to focus on activities

74
0:05:38.7,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that would help to alleviate poverty, fight disease, combat climate change,

75
0:05:45.7,000 --> 0:05:49,000
bridge the religious, racial and other divides that torment the world,

76
0:05:49.7,000 --> 0:05:53,000
but to do it in a way that would either use

77
0:05:53.7,000 --> 0:05:59,000
whatever particular skills we could put together in our group

78
0:05:59.7,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to change the way some public good function was performed

79
0:06:04.7,000 --> 0:06:07,000
so that it would sweep across the world more.

80
0:06:07.7,000 --> 0:06:13,000
You saw one reference to that in what we were able to do with AIDS drugs.

81
0:06:13.7,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And I want to say that the head of our AIDS effort,

82
0:06:16.7,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and the person who also is primarily active in the wish I'll make tonight,

83
0:06:20.7,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Ira Magaziner, is here with me and I want to thank him for everything he's done.

84
0:06:24.7,000 --> 0:06:26,000
He's over there.

85
0:06:26.7,000 --> 0:06:3,000
(Applause)

86
0:06:30.7,000 --> 0:06:36,000
When I got out of office and was asked to work, first in the Caribbean,

87
0:06:36.7,000 --> 0:06:39,000
to try to help deal with the AIDS crisis,

88
0:06:39.7,000 --> 0:06:43,000
generic drugs were available for about 500 dollars a person a year.

89
0:06:43.7,000 --> 0:06:45,000
If you bought them in vast bulks,

90
0:06:45.7,000 --> 0:06:48,000
you could get them at a little under 400 dollars.

91
0:06:48.7,000 --> 0:06:51,000
The first country we went to work in, the Bahamas,

92
0:06:51.7,000 --> 0:06:53,000
was paying 3,500 dollars for these drugs.

93
0:06:53.7,000 --> 0:06:56,000
The market was so terribly disorganized

94
0:06:56.7,000 --> 0:07:,000
that they were buying this medicine through two agents

95
0:07:00.7,000 --> 0:07:02,000
who were gigging them sevenfold.

96
0:07:03.7,000 --> 0:07:06,000
So the very first week we were working,

97
0:07:06.7,000 --> 0:07:08,000
we got the price down to 500 dollars.

98
0:07:08.7,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And all of a sudden, they could save seven times as many lives

99
0:07:10.7,000 --> 0:07:12,000
for the same amount of money.

100
0:07:12.7,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Then we went to work with the manufacturers of AIDS medicines,

101
0:07:15.7,000 --> 0:07:17,000
one of whom was cited in the film,

102
0:07:17.7,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and negotiated a whole different change in business strategy,

103
0:07:22.7,000 --> 0:07:25,000
because even at 500 dollars, these drugs

104
0:07:25.7,000 --> 0:07:3,000
were being sold on a high-margin, low-volume, uncertain-payment basis.

105
0:07:30.7,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So we worked on improving the productivity of the operations

106
0:07:34.7,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and the supply chain, and went to a low-margin, high-volume,

107
0:07:38.7,000 --> 0:07:4,000
absolutely certain-payment business.

108
0:07:40.7,000 --> 0:07:43,000
I joked that the main contribution we made

109
0:07:43.7,000 --> 0:07:44,000
to the battle against AIDS was to get the manufacturers

110
0:07:44.7,000 --> 0:07:49,000
to change from a jewelry store to a grocery store strategy.

111
0:07:50.7,000 --> 0:07:54,000
But the price went to 140 dollars from 500.

112
0:07:54.7,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And pretty soon, the average price was 192 dollars.

113
0:07:58.7,000 --> 0:08:,000
Now we can get it for about 100 dollars.

114
0:08:00.7,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Children's medicine was 600 dollars,

115
0:08:02.7,000 --> 0:08:04,000
because nobody could afford to buy any of it.

116
0:08:04.7,000 --> 0:08:07,000
We negotiated it down to 190.

117
0:08:07.7,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Then, the French imposed their brilliantly conceived airline tax

118
0:08:11.7,000 --> 0:08:13,000
to create a something called UNITAID,

119
0:08:13.7,000 --> 0:08:15,000
got a bunch of other countries to help.

120
0:08:15.7,000 --> 0:08:18,000
That children's medicine is now 60 dollars a person a year.

121
0:08:18.7,000 --> 0:08:23,000
The only thing that is keeping us from basically saving the lives

122
0:08:23.7,000 --> 0:08:25,000
of everybody who needs the medicine to stay alive

123
0:08:25.7,000 --> 0:08:28,000
are the absence of systems necessary to diagnose, treat and care

124
0:08:28.7,000 --> 0:08:32,000
for people and deliver this medicine.

125
0:08:32.7,000 --> 0:08:36,000
We started a childhood obesity initiative with the Heart Association in America.

126
0:08:36.7,000 --> 0:08:39,000
We tried to do the same thing by negotiating industry-right deals

127
0:08:39.7,000 --> 0:08:44,000
with the soft drink and the snack food industry to cut the caloric

128
0:08:44.7,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and other dangerous content of food going to our children in the schools.

129
0:08:48.7,000 --> 0:08:51,000
We just reorganized the markets.

130
0:08:51.7,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And it occurred to me that in this whole non-governmental world,

131
0:08:56.7,000 --> 0:09:01,000
somebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets.

132
0:09:01.7,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And that is now what we're trying to do,

133
0:09:03.7,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and working with this large cities group to fight climate change,

134
0:09:06.7,000 --> 0:09:11,000
to negotiate huge, big, volume deals that will enable cities

135
0:09:11.7,000 --> 0:09:14,000
which generate 75 percent of the world's greenhouse gases,

136
0:09:14.7,000 --> 0:09:17,000
to drastically and quickly reduce greenhouse gas emissions

137
0:09:17.7,000 --> 0:09:2,000
in a way that is good economics.

138
0:09:21.7,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And this whole discussion as if it's some sort of economic burden,

139
0:09:25.7,000 --> 0:09:26,000
is a mystery to me.

140
0:09:26.7,000 --> 0:09:28,000
I think it's a bird's nest on the ground.

141
0:09:28.7,000 --> 0:09:32,000
When Al Gore won his well-deserved Oscar

142
0:09:32.7,000 --> 0:09:36,000
for the "Inconvenient Truth" movie, I was thrilled,

143
0:09:36.7,000 --> 0:09:4,000
but I had urged him to make a second movie quickly.

144
0:09:40.7,000 --> 0:09:44,000
For those of you who saw "An Inconvenient Truth,"

145
0:09:44.7,000 --> 0:09:49,000
the most important slide in the Gore lecture is the last one,

146
0:09:49.7,000 --> 0:09:52,000
which shows here's where greenhouse gases are going

147
0:09:52.7,000 --> 0:09:54,000
if we don't do anything, here's where they could go.

148
0:09:54.7,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And then there are six different categories

149
0:09:56.7,000 --> 0:09:58,000
of things we can do to change the trajectory.

150
0:09:58.7,000 --> 0:10:01,000
We need a movie on those six categories.

151
0:10:01.7,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And all of you need to have it embedded in your brains

152
0:10:04.7,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and to organize yourselves around it.

153
0:10:07.7,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So we're trying to do that.

154
0:10:09.7,000 --> 0:10:12,000
So organizing these markets is one thing we try to do.

155
0:10:12.7,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Now we have taken on a second thing, and this gets to my wish.

156
0:10:16.7,000 --> 0:10:2,000
It has been my experience in working in developing countries

157
0:10:21.7,000 --> 0:10:25,000
that while the headlines may all be -- the pessimistic headlines may say,

158
0:10:25.7,000 --> 0:10:29,000
well, we can't do this, that or the other thing because of corruption --

159
0:10:29.7,000 --> 0:10:35,000
I think incapacity is a far bigger problem in poor countries than corruption,

160
0:10:35.7,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and feeds corruption.

161
0:10:39.7,000 --> 0:10:42,000
We now have the money, given these low prices, to distribute

162
0:10:42.7,000 --> 0:10:47,000
AIDS drugs all over the world to people we cannot presently reach.

163
0:10:49.7,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Today these low prices are available in the 25 countries where we work,

164
0:10:53.7,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and in a total of 62 countries,

165
0:10:55.7,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and about 550,000 people are getting the benefits of them.

166
0:10:59.7,000 --> 0:11:02,000
But the money is there to reach others.

167
0:11:02.7,000 --> 0:11:05,000
The systems are not there to reach the people.

168
0:11:05.7,000 --> 0:11:13,000
So what we have been trying to do,

169
0:11:13.7,000 --> 0:11:19,000
working first in Rwanda and then in Malawi and other places --

170
0:11:19.7,000 --> 0:11:21,000
but I want to talk about Rwanda tonight --

171
0:11:21.7,000 --> 0:11:29,000
is to develop a model for rural health care in a very poor area

172
0:11:29.7,000 --> 0:11:33,000
that can be used to deal with AIDS, TB, malaria, other infectious diseases,

173
0:11:33.7,000 --> 0:11:36,000
maternal and child health, and a whole range of health issues

174
0:11:36.7,000 --> 0:11:39,000
poor people are grappling with in the developing world,

175
0:11:39.7,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that can first be scaled for the whole nation of Rwanda,

176
0:11:43.7,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and then will be a model that could literally

177
0:11:45.7,000 --> 0:11:47,000
be implemented in any other poor country in the world.

178
0:11:47.7,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And the test is: one, will it do the job?

179
0:11:49.7,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Will it provide high quality care?

180
0:11:52.7,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And two, will it do it at a price

181
0:11:54.7,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that will enable the country to sustain a health care system

182
0:11:58.7,000 --> 0:12:02,000
without foreign donors after five to 10 years?

183
0:12:02.7,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Because the longer I deal with these problems,

184
0:12:06.7,000 --> 0:12:08,000
the more convinced I am that we have to --

185
0:12:08.7,000 --> 0:12:11,000
whether it's economics, health, education, whatever --

186
0:12:11.7,000 --> 0:12:13,000
we have to build systems.

187
0:12:13.7,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And the absence of systems that function

188
0:12:16.7,000 --> 0:12:2,000
break the connection which got you all in this seat tonight.

189
0:12:20.7,000 --> 0:12:22,000
You think about whatever your life has been,

190
0:12:22.7,000 --> 0:12:25,000
however many obstacles you have faced in your life,

191
0:12:25.7,000 --> 0:12:28,000
at critical junctures you always knew

192
0:12:28.7,000 --> 0:12:32,000
there was a predictable connection between the effort you exerted

193
0:12:32.7,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and the result you achieved.

194
0:12:34.7,000 --> 0:12:39,000
In a world with no systems, with chaos,

195
0:12:39.7,000 --> 0:12:42,000
everything becomes a guerilla struggle,

196
0:12:42.7,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and this predictability is not there.

197
0:12:45.7,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And it becomes almost impossible to save lives,

198
0:12:48.7,000 --> 0:12:51,000
educate kids, develop economies, whatever.

199
0:12:51.7,000 --> 0:12:54,000
The person, in my view,

200
0:12:54.7,000 --> 0:12:59,000
who has done the best job of this in the health care area,

201
0:12:59.7,000 --> 0:13:03,000
of building a system in a very poor area, is Dr. Paul Farmer,

202
0:13:03.7,000 --> 0:13:08,000
who, many of you know, has worked for now 20 years with his group,

203
0:13:08.7,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Partners in Health, primarily in Haiti where he started,

204
0:13:12.7,000 --> 0:13:14,000
but they've also worked in Russia, in Peru

205
0:13:14.7,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and other places around the world.

206
0:13:16.7,000 --> 0:13:21,000
As poor as Haiti is, in the area where Farmer's clinic is active --

207
0:13:21.7,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and they serve a catchment area far greater

208
0:13:23.7,000 --> 0:13:27,000
than the medical professionals they have would indicate they could serve --

209
0:13:27.7,000 --> 0:13:34,000
since 1988, they have not lost one person to tuberculosis, not one.

210
0:13:34.7,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And they've achieved a lot of other amazing health results.

211
0:13:39.7,000 --> 0:13:43,000
So when we decided to work in Rwanda

212
0:13:43.7,000 --> 0:13:48,000
on trying to dramatically increase the income of the country and fight the AIDS problem,

213
0:13:48.7,000 --> 0:13:5,000
we wanted to build a healthcare network,

214
0:13:50.7,000 --> 0:13:54,000
because it had been totally destroyed during the genocide in 1994,

215
0:13:54.7,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and the per capita income was still under a dollar a day.

216
0:13:58.7,000 --> 0:14:02,000
So I rang up, asked Paul Farmer if he would help.

217
0:14:03.7,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Because it seemed to me if we could prove there was a model in Haiti

218
0:14:06.7,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and a model in Rwanda that we could then take all over the country,

219
0:14:10.7,000 --> 0:14:12,000
number one, it would be a wonderful thing for a country

220
0:14:12.7,000 --> 0:14:16,000
that has suffered as much as any on Earth in the last 15 years,

221
0:14:16.7,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and number two, we would have something that could then be adapted

222
0:14:20.7,000 --> 0:14:23,000
to any other poor country anywhere in the world.

223
0:14:24.7,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And so we have set about doing that.

224
0:14:28.7,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Now, we started working together 18 months ago.

225
0:14:32.7,000 --> 0:14:36,000
And we're working in an area called Southern Kayonza,

226
0:14:36.7,000 --> 0:14:4,000
which is one of the poorest areas in Rwanda,

227
0:14:40.7,000 --> 0:14:46,000
with a group that originally includes about 400,000 people.

228
0:14:46.7,000 --> 0:14:51,000
We're essentially implementing what Paul Farmer did in Haiti:

229
0:14:51.7,000 --> 0:14:56,000
he develops and trains paid community health workers

230
0:14:56.7,000 --> 0:15:,000
who are able to identify health problems,

231
0:15:00.7,000 --> 0:15:04,000
ensure that people who have AIDS or TB are properly diagnosed

232
0:15:04.7,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and take their medicine regularly,

233
0:15:06.7,000 --> 0:15:13,000
who work on bringing about health education, clean water and sanitation,

234
0:15:13.7,000 --> 0:15:18,000
providing nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care

235
0:15:18.7,000 --> 0:15:22,000
if they have problems of the severity that require it.

236
0:15:22.7,000 --> 0:15:27,000
The procedures that make this work have been perfected,

237
0:15:27.7,000 --> 0:15:3,000
as I said, by Paul Farmer and his team

238
0:15:30.7,000 --> 0:15:33,000
in their work in rural Haiti over the last 20 years.

239
0:15:33.7,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Recently we did an evaluation of the first 18 months of our efforts in Rwanda.

240
0:15:39.7,000 --> 0:15:44,000
And the results were so good that the Rwandan government

241
0:15:44.7,000 --> 0:15:47,000
has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country,

242
0:15:47.7,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it.

243
0:15:53.7,000 --> 0:15:57,000
I'll tell you a little bit about our team because it's indicative of what we do.

244
0:15:57.7,000 --> 0:16:,000
We have about 500 people around the world

245
0:16:00.7,000 --> 0:16:04,000
working in our AIDS program, some of them for nothing --

246
0:16:04.7,000 --> 0:16:06,000
just for transportation, room and board.

247
0:16:06.7,000 --> 0:16:1,000
And then we have others working in these other related programs.

248
0:16:10.7,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Our business plan in Rwanda

249
0:16:12.7,000 --> 0:16:15,000
was put together under the leadership of Diana Noble,

250
0:16:15.7,000 --> 0:16:18,000
who is an unusually gifted woman,

251
0:16:18.7,000 --> 0:16:23,000
but not unusual in the type of people who have been willing to do this kind of work.

252
0:16:23.7,000 --> 0:16:28,000
She was the youngest partner at Schroder Ventures in London in her 20s.

253
0:16:28.7,000 --> 0:16:3,000
She was CEO of a successful e-venture --

254
0:16:30.7,000 --> 0:16:34,000
she started and built Reed Elsevier Ventures --

255
0:16:34.7,000 --> 0:16:37,000
and at 45 she decided she wanted to do something different with her life.

256
0:16:37.7,000 --> 0:16:41,000
So she now works full-time on this for very little pay.

257
0:16:41.7,000 --> 0:16:45,000
She and her team of former business people have created a business plan

258
0:16:45.7,000 --> 0:16:49,000
that will enable us to scale this health system up for the whole country.

259
0:16:49.7,000 --> 0:16:54,000
And it would be worthy of the kind of private equity work

260
0:16:54.7,000 --> 0:16:58,000
she used to do when she was making a lot more money for it.

261
0:16:58.7,000 --> 0:17:03,000
When we came to this rural area, 45 percent of the children under the age of five

262
0:17:03.7,000 --> 0:17:08,000
had stunted growth due to malnutrition.

263
0:17:08.7,000 --> 0:17:14,000
23 percent of them died before they reached the age of five.

264
0:17:16.7,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Mortality at birth was over two-and-a-half percent.

265
0:17:19.7,000 --> 0:17:23,000
Over 15 percent of the deaths among adults and children occurred

266
0:17:23.7,000 --> 0:17:28,000
because of intestinal parasites and diarrhea from dirty water and inadequate sanitation --

267
0:17:28.7,000 --> 0:17:31,000
all entirely preventable and treatable.

268
0:17:31.7,000 --> 0:17:35,000
Over 13 percent of the deaths were from respiratory illnesses --

269
0:17:35.7,000 --> 0:17:38,000
again, all preventable and treatable.

270
0:17:38.7,000 --> 0:17:43,000
And not a single soul in this area was being treated for AIDS or tuberculosis.

271
0:17:44.7,000 --> 0:17:48,000
Within the first 18 months, the following things happened:

272
0:17:48.7,000 --> 0:17:52,000
we went from zero to about 2,000 people being treated for AIDS.

273
0:17:52.7,000 --> 0:17:56,000
That's 80 percent of the people who need treatment in this area.

274
0:17:56.7,000 --> 0:18:01,000
Listen to this: less than four-tenths of one percent of those being treated

275
0:18:01.7,000 --> 0:18:05,000
stopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment.

276
0:18:05.7,000 --> 0:18:08,000
That's lower than the figure in the United States.

277
0:18:08.7,000 --> 0:18:1,000
Less than three-tenths of one percent

278
0:18:10.7,000 --> 0:18:15,000
had to transfer to the more expensive second-line drugs.

279
0:18:15.7,000 --> 0:18:19,000
400,000 pregnant women were brought into counseling

280
0:18:19.7,000 --> 0:18:24,000
and will give birth for the first time within an organized healthcare system.

281
0:18:24.7,000 --> 0:18:29,000
That's about 43 percent of all the pregnancies.

282
0:18:29.7,000 --> 0:18:33,000
About 40 percent of all the people -- I said 400,000. I meant 40,000.

283
0:18:33.7,000 --> 0:18:37,000
About 40 percent of all the people who need TB treatment are now getting it --

284
0:18:37.7,000 --> 0:18:41,000
in just 18 months, up from zero when we started.

285
0:18:41.7,000 --> 0:18:44,000
43 percent of the children in need of an infant feeding program

286
0:18:44.7,000 --> 0:18:46,000
to prevent malnutrition and early death

287
0:18:46.7,000 --> 0:18:49,000
are now getting the food supplements they need to stay alive and to grow.

288
0:18:49.7,000 --> 0:18:53,000
We've started the first malaria treatment programs they've ever had there.

289
0:18:53.7,000 --> 0:18:58,000
Patients admitted to a hospital that was destroyed during the genocide

290
0:18:58.7,000 --> 0:19:03,000
that we have renovated along with four other clinics,

291
0:19:03.7,000 --> 0:19:08,000
complete with solar power generators, good lab technology.

292
0:19:08.7,000 --> 0:19:13,000
We now are treating 325 people a month,

293
0:19:13.7,000 --> 0:19:18,000
despite the fact that almost 100 percent of the AIDS patients are now treated at home.

294
0:19:19.7,000 --> 0:19:22,000
And the most important thing is

295
0:19:22.7,000 --> 0:19:27,000
because we've implemented Paul Farmer's model, using community health workers,

296
0:19:27.7,000 --> 0:19:33,000
we estimate that this system could be put into place for all of Rwanda

297
0:19:33.7,000 --> 0:19:37,000
for between five and six percent of GDP,

298
0:19:37.7,000 --> 0:19:41,000
and that the government could sustain that

299
0:19:41.7,000 --> 0:19:46,000
without depending on foreign aid after five or six years.

300
0:19:47.7,000 --> 0:19:49,000
And for those of you who understand healthcare economics

301
0:19:49.7,000 --> 0:19:54,000
you know that all wealthy countries spend between nine and 11 percent of GDP

302
0:19:54.7,000 --> 0:19:56,000
on health care, except for the United States, we spend 16 --

303
0:19:56.7,000 --> 0:19:58,000
but that's a story for another day.

304
0:19:59.7,000 --> 0:20:,000
(Laughter)

305
0:20:01.7,000 --> 0:20:06,000
We're now working with Partners in Health and the Ministry of Health in Rwanda

306
0:20:06.7,000 --> 0:20:1,000
and our Foundation folks to scale this system up.

307
0:20:10.7,000 --> 0:20:16,000
We're also beginning to do this in Malawi and Lesotho.

308
0:20:16.7,000 --> 0:20:2,000
And we have similar projects in Tanzania, Mozambique,

309
0:20:20.7,000 --> 0:20:25,000
Kenya and Ethiopia with other partners trying to achieve the same thing:

310
0:20:25.7,000 --> 0:20:27,000
to save as many lives as quickly as we can,

311
0:20:27.7,000 --> 0:20:3,000
but to do it in a systematic way that can be implemented nationwide

312
0:20:30.7,000 --> 0:20:34,000
and then with a model that can be implemented in any country in the world.

313
0:20:34.7,000 --> 0:20:38,000
We need initial upfront investment to train doctors, nurses,

314
0:20:38.7,000 --> 0:20:41,000
health administration and community health workers throughout the country,

315
0:20:41.7,000 --> 0:20:44,000
to set up the information technology, the solar energy,

316
0:20:44.7,000 --> 0:20:47,000
the water and sanitation, the transportation infrastructure.

317
0:20:47.7,000 --> 0:20:5,000
But over a five- to 10-year period,

318
0:20:50.7,000 --> 0:20:52,000
we will take down the need for outside assistance

319
0:20:52.7,000 --> 0:20:54,000
and eventually it will be phased out.

320
0:20:55.7,000 --> 0:21:03,000
My wish is that TED assist us in our work and help us to build

321
0:21:03.7,000 --> 0:21:07,000
a high-quality rural health system in a poor country, Rwanda,

322
0:21:07.7,000 --> 0:21:09,000
that can be a model for Africa,

323
0:21:09.7,000 --> 0:21:14,000
and indeed, for any poor country anywhere in the world.

324
0:21:14.7,000 --> 0:21:2,000
My belief is that this will help us to build a more integrated world

325
0:21:20.7,000 --> 0:21:23,000
with more partners and fewer terrorists,

326
0:21:23.7,000 --> 0:21:26,000
with more productive citizens and fewer haters,

327
0:21:26.7,000 --> 0:21:31,000
a place we'd all want our kids and our grandchildren to grow up in.

328
0:21:32.7,000 --> 0:21:38,000
It has been an honor for me, particularly, to work in Rwanda

329
0:21:38.7,000 --> 0:21:41,000
where we also have a major economic development project

330
0:21:41.7,000 --> 0:21:46,000
in partnership with Sir Tom Hunter, the Scottish philanthropist,

331
0:21:46.7,000 --> 0:21:49,000
where last year we, using the same thing with AIDS drugs,

332
0:21:49.7,000 --> 0:21:55,000
cut the cost of fertilizer and the interest rates on microcredit loans by 30 percent

333
0:21:55.7,000 --> 0:21:59,000
and achieved three- to four-hundred percent increases

334
0:21:59.7,000 --> 0:22:01,000
in crop yields with the farmers.

335
0:22:01.7,000 --> 0:22:07,000
These people have been through a lot and none of us, most of all me,

336
0:22:07.7,000 --> 0:22:1,000
helped them when they were on the verge of destroying each other.

337
0:22:11.7,000 --> 0:22:17,000
We're undoing that now, and they are so over it and so into their future.

338
0:22:17.7,000 --> 0:22:21,000
We're doing this in an environmentally responsible way.

339
0:22:21.7,000 --> 0:22:25,000
I'm doing my best to convince them not to run the electric grid

340
0:22:25.7,000 --> 0:22:28,000
to the 35 percent of the people that have no access,

341
0:22:28.7,000 --> 0:22:33,000
but to do it with clean energy. To have responsible reforestation projects,

342
0:22:33.7,000 --> 0:22:37,000
the Rwandans, interestingly enough, have been quite good, Mr. Wilson,

343
0:22:37.7,000 --> 0:22:39,000
in preserving their topsoil.

344
0:22:39.7,000 --> 0:22:43,000
There's a couple of guys from southern farming families --

345
0:22:43.7,000 --> 0:22:45,000
the first thing I did when I went out to this place

346
0:22:45.7,000 --> 0:22:47,000
was to get down on my hands and knees and dig in the dirt

347
0:22:47.7,000 --> 0:22:49,000
and see what they'd done with it.

348
0:22:49.7,000 --> 0:22:53,000
We have a chance here to prove that a country

349
0:22:53.7,000 --> 0:22:58,000
that almost slaughtered itself out of existence

350
0:22:59.7,000 --> 0:23:06,000
can practice reconciliation, reorganize itself, focus on tomorrow

351
0:23:06.7,000 --> 0:23:13,000
and provide comprehensive, quality health care with minimal outside help.

352
0:23:13.7,000 --> 0:23:19,000
I am grateful for this prize, and I will use it to that end.

353
0:23:19.7,000 --> 0:23:23,000
We could use some more help to do this,

354
0:23:23.7,000 --> 0:23:27,000
but think of what it would mean if we could have a world-class health system

355
0:23:27.7,000 --> 0:23:32,000
in Rwanda -- in a country with a less-than-one-dollar-a-day-per-capita income,

356
0:23:32.7,000 --> 0:23:36,000
one that could save hundreds of millions of lives

357
0:23:36.7,000 --> 0:23:43,000
over the next decade if applied to every similarly situated country on Earth.

358
0:23:43.7,000 --> 0:23:47,000
It's worth a try and I believe it would succeed.

359
0:23:47.7,000 --> 0:23:5,000
Thank you and God bless you.

360
0:23:50.7,000 --> 0:24:02,000
(Applause)

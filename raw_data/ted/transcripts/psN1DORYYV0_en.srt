1
0:00:14.048,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm going to tell you a little bit about my TEDxHouston Talk.

2
0:00:17.841,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I woke up the morning after I gave that talk

3
0:00:21.404,000 --> 0:00:25,000
with the worst vulnerability hangover of my life.

4
0:00:26.346,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And I actually didn't leave my house for about three days.

5
0:00:32.092,000 --> 0:00:35,000
The first time I left was to meet a friend for lunch.

6
0:00:35.787,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And when I walked in, she was already at the table.

7
0:00:38.233,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I sat down, and she said, "God, you look like hell."

8
0:00:41.541,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I said, "Thanks. I feel really --

9
0:00:44.54,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I'm not functioning."

10
0:00:46.152,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And she said, "What's going on?"

11
0:00:48.35,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And I said, "I just told 500 people

12
0:00:53.967,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that I became a researcher to avoid vulnerability.

13
0:00:57.586,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And that when being vulnerable emerged from my data,

14
0:01:02.066,000 --> 0:01:06,000
as absolutely essential to whole-hearted living,

15
0:01:06.669,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I told these 500 people that I had a breakdown.

16
0:01:10.716,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I had a slide that said 'Breakdown.'

17
0:01:12.502,000 --> 0:01:14,000
At what point did I think that was a good idea?"

18
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:18,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:18.145,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And she said, "I saw your talk live-streamed.

20
0:01:20.327,000 --> 0:01:22,000
It was not really you.

21
0:01:22.643,000 --> 0:01:24,000
It was a little different than what you usually do.

22
0:01:25.049,000 --> 0:01:26,000
But it was great."

23
0:01:26.885,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And I said,

24
0:01:28.401,000 --> 0:01:29,000
"This can't happen.

25
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:32,000
YouTube, they're putting this thing on YouTube.

26
0:01:32.765,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And we're going to be talking about 600, 700 people."

27
0:01:36.936,000 --> 0:01:39,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:40.746,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And she said, "Well, I think it's too late."

29
0:01:43.897,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And I said, "Let me ask you something."

30
0:01:46.201,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And she said, "Yeah."

31
0:01:47.677,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I said, "Do you remember when we were in college,

32
0:01:49.994,000 --> 0:01:51,000
really wild and kind of dumb?"

33
0:01:52.059,000 --> 0:01:53,000
She said, "Yeah."

34
0:01:53.089,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I said, "Remember when we'd leave a really bad message

35
0:01:55.739,000 --> 0:01:56,000
on our ex-boyfriend's answering machine?

36
0:01:58.137,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Then we'd have to break into his dorm room and then erase the tape?"

37
0:02:01.769,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:04.19,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And she goes, "Uh... no."

39
0:02:06.92,000 --> 0:02:08,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:09.154,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Of course, the only thing I could say at that point was,

41
0:02:11.804,000 --> 0:02:12,000
"Yeah, me neither.

42
0:02:14.133,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Yeah -- me neither."

43
0:02:16.849,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And I'm thinking to myself,

44
0:02:20.158,000 --> 0:02:21,000
"Brené, what are you doing?

45
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Why did you bring this up?

46
0:02:24.249,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Have you lost your mind?

47
0:02:25.874,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Your sisters would be perfect for this."

48
0:02:28.183,000 --> 0:02:29,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:29.612,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So I looked back up and she said,

50
0:02:32.766,000 --> 0:02:36,000
"Are you really going to try to break in and steal the video

51
0:02:37.544,000 --> 0:02:38,000
before they put it on YouTube?"

52
0:02:39.144,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:40.656,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And I said, "I'm just thinking about it a little bit."

54
0:02:43.64,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:45.426,000 --> 0:02:49,000
She said, "You're like the worst vulnerability role model ever."

56
0:02:50.003,000 --> 0:02:51,000
(Laughter)

57
0:02:52.937,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Then I looked at her and I said something

58
0:02:54.929,000 --> 0:02:55,000
that at the time felt a little dramatic,

59
0:02:56.881,000 --> 0:02:58,000
but ended up being more prophetic than dramatic.

60
0:03:00.793,000 --> 0:03:03,000
"If 500 turns into 1,000

61
0:03:04.762,000 --> 0:03:05,000
or 2,000,

62
0:03:06.246,000 --> 0:03:07,000
my life is over."

63
0:03:08.594,000 --> 0:03:1,000
(Laughter)

64
0:03:10.856,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I had no contingency plan for four million.

65
0:03:13.341,000 --> 0:03:15,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:17.883,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And my life did end when that happened.

67
0:03:20.875,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And maybe the hardest part about my life ending

68
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:28,000
is that I learned something hard about myself,

69
0:03:28.971,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and that was that,

70
0:03:31.439,000 --> 0:03:32,000
as much as I would be frustrated

71
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
about not being able to get my work out to the world,

72
0:03:35.548,000 --> 0:03:37,000
there was a part of me that was working very hard

73
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:41,000
to engineer staying small,

74
0:03:41.56,000 --> 0:03:42,000
staying right under the radar.

75
0:03:45.761,000 --> 0:03:47,000
But I want to talk about what I've learned.

76
0:03:47.918,000 --> 0:03:49,000
There's two things that I've learned in the last year.

77
0:03:51.287,000 --> 0:03:52,000
The first is:

78
0:03:54.468,000 --> 0:03:57,000
vulnerability is not weakness.

79
0:03:59.295,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And that myth is profoundly dangerous.

80
0:04:04.283,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Let me ask you honestly --

81
0:04:06.029,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and I'll give you this warning,

82
0:04:07.861,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I'm trained as a therapist,

83
0:04:09.171,000 --> 0:04:11,000
so I can out-wait you uncomfortably --

84
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
so if you could just raise your hand that would be awesome --

85
0:04:15.469,000 --> 0:04:16,000
how many of you honestly,

86
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:2,000
when you're thinking about doing or saying something vulnerable

87
0:04:20.858,000 --> 0:04:22,000
think, "God, vulnerability is weakness."

88
0:04:23.311,000 --> 0:04:26,000
How many of you think of vulnerability and weakness synonymously?

89
0:04:27.319,000 --> 0:04:28,000
The majority of people.

90
0:04:29.136,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Now let me ask you this question:

91
0:04:30.775,000 --> 0:04:32,000
This past week at TED,

92
0:04:33.374,000 --> 0:04:35,000
how many of you, when you saw vulnerability up here,

93
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:37,000
thought it was pure courage?

94
0:04:40.708,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Vulnerability is not weakness.

95
0:04:43.43,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I define vulnerability as emotional risk,

96
0:04:48.234,000 --> 0:04:5,000
exposure, uncertainty.

97
0:04:51.425,000 --> 0:04:52,000
It fuels our daily lives.

98
0:04:53.611,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And I've come to the belief --

99
0:04:55.183,000 --> 0:04:57,000
this is my 12th year doing this research --

100
0:04:57.452,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that vulnerability is our most accurate measurement of courage --

101
0:05:05.929,000 --> 0:05:07,000
to be vulnerable, to let ourselves be seen,

102
0:05:08.461,000 --> 0:05:09,000
to be honest.

103
0:05:10.663,000 --> 0:05:13,000
One of the weird things that's happened is, after the TED explosion,

104
0:05:14.342,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I got a lot of offers to speak all over the country --

105
0:05:17.999,000 --> 0:05:19,000
everyone from schools and parent meetings

106
0:05:20.385,000 --> 0:05:21,000
to Fortune 500 companies.

107
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And so many of the calls went like this,

108
0:05:25.441,000 --> 0:05:26,000
"Dr. Brown, we loved your TED talk.

109
0:05:27.215,000 --> 0:05:28,000
We'd like you to come in and speak.

110
0:05:29.557,000 --> 0:05:3,000
We'd appreciate it

111
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:33,000
if you wouldn't mention vulnerability or shame."

112
0:05:33.356,000 --> 0:05:37,000
(Laughter)

113
0:05:38.739,000 --> 0:05:4,000
What would you like for me to talk about?

114
0:05:42.089,000 --> 0:05:43,000
There's three big answers.

115
0:05:43.517,000 --> 0:05:46,000
This is mostly, to be honest with you, from the business sector:

116
0:05:46.667,000 --> 0:05:49,000
innovation, creativity and change.

117
0:05:50.482,000 --> 0:05:52,000
(Laughter)

118
0:05:52.514,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So let me go on the record and say,

119
0:05:56.458,000 --> 0:06:01,000
vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change.

120
0:06:01.652,000 --> 0:06:06,000
(Applause)

121
0:06:09.855,000 --> 0:06:13,000
To create is to make something that has never existed before.

122
0:06:15.704,000 --> 0:06:17,000
There's nothing more vulnerable than that.

123
0:06:18.681,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Adaptability to change is all about vulnerability.

124
0:06:23.466,000 --> 0:06:24,000
The second thing,

125
0:06:24.579,000 --> 0:06:27,000
in addition to really finally understanding

126
0:06:28.409,000 --> 0:06:3,000
the relationship between vulnerability and courage,

127
0:06:30.836,000 --> 0:06:31,000
the second thing I learned, is this:

128
0:06:33.972,000 --> 0:06:35,000
We have to talk about shame.

129
0:06:38.285,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And I'm going to be really honest with you.

130
0:06:40.817,000 --> 0:06:43,000
When I became a "vulnerability researcher"

131
0:06:44.365,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and that became the focus because of the TED talk --

132
0:06:47.124,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and I'm not kidding.

133
0:06:48.92,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I'll give you an example.

134
0:06:51.132,000 --> 0:06:53,000
About three months ago, I was in a sporting goods store

135
0:06:54.069,000 --> 0:06:55,000
buying goggles and shin guards

136
0:06:55.522,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and all the things that parents buy at the sporting goods store.

137
0:06:59.121,000 --> 0:07:01,000
About from a hundred feet away, this is what I hear:

138
0:07:01.994,000 --> 0:07:03,000
"Vulnerability TED! Vulnerability TED!"

139
0:07:04.649,000 --> 0:07:05,000
(Laughter)

140
0:07:10.545,000 --> 0:07:11,000
(Laughter ends)

141
0:07:11.57,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I'm a fifth-generation Texan.

142
0:07:14.669,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Our family motto is "Lock and load."

143
0:07:17.248,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I am not a natural vulnerability researcher.

144
0:07:22.43,000 --> 0:07:23,000
So I'm like,

145
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:26,000
just keep walking, she's on my six.

146
0:07:26.978,000 --> 0:07:27,000
(Laughter)

147
0:07:28.422,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And then I hear, "Vulnerability TED!"

148
0:07:32.684,000 --> 0:07:34,000
I turn around, I go, "Hi."

149
0:07:35.255,000 --> 0:07:37,000
She's right here and she said,

150
0:07:37.909,000 --> 0:07:39,000
"You're the shame researcher who had the breakdown."

151
0:07:40.719,000 --> 0:07:43,000
(Laughter)

152
0:07:44.557,000 --> 0:07:48,000
At this point, parents are, like, pulling their children close.

153
0:07:49.303,000 --> 0:07:5,000
(Laughter)

154
0:07:50.428,000 --> 0:07:51,000
"Look away."

155
0:07:54.612,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And I'm so worn out at this point in my life,

156
0:07:56.992,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I look at her and I actually say,

157
0:07:58.727,000 --> 0:08:,000
"It was a fricking spiritual awakening."

158
0:08:01.385,000 --> 0:08:02,000
(Laughter)

159
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:05,000
(Applause)

160
0:08:05.345,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And she looks back and does this,

161
0:08:08.226,000 --> 0:08:09,000
"I know."

162
0:08:09.274,000 --> 0:08:1,000
(Laughter)

163
0:08:10.299,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And she said,

164
0:08:12.114,000 --> 0:08:14,000
"We watched your TED talk in my book club.

165
0:08:15.116,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Then we read your book and we renamed ourselves

166
0:08:18.489,000 --> 0:08:19,000
'The Breakdown Babes.'"

167
0:08:20.49,000 --> 0:08:21,000
(Laughter)

168
0:08:21.753,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And she said, "Our tagline is:

169
0:08:23.789,000 --> 0:08:26,000
'We're falling apart and it feels fantastic.'"

170
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:3,000
(Laughter)

171
0:08:30.853,000 --> 0:08:33,000
You can only imagine what it's like for me in a faculty meeting.

172
0:08:34.925,000 --> 0:08:35,000
(Sighs)

173
0:08:37.433,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So when I became Vulnerability TED,

174
0:08:40.359,000 --> 0:08:41,000
like an action figure --

175
0:08:42.922,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Like Ninja Barbie, but I'm Vulnerability TED --

176
0:08:46.938,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I thought, I'm going to leave that shame stuff behind,

177
0:08:49.641,000 --> 0:08:51,000
because I spent six years studying shame

178
0:08:52.609,000 --> 0:08:54,000
before I started writing and talking about vulnerability.

179
0:08:55.474,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And I thought, thank God, because shame is this horrible topic,

180
0:08:58.566,000 --> 0:08:59,000
no one wants to talk about it.

181
0:09:00.156,000 --> 0:09:02,000
It's the best way to shut people down on an airplane.

182
0:09:02.658,000 --> 0:09:03,000
"What do you do?" "I study shame." "Oh."

183
0:09:04.621,000 --> 0:09:06,000
(Laughter)

184
0:09:06.868,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And I see you.

185
0:09:08,000 --> 0:09:12,000
(Laughter)

186
0:09:14.268,000 --> 0:09:17,000
But in surviving this last year,

187
0:09:18.278,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I was reminded of a cardinal rule --

188
0:09:20.953,000 --> 0:09:22,000
not a research rule,

189
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:27,000
but a moral imperative from my upbringing --

190
0:09:27.249,000 --> 0:09:3,000
"you've got to dance with the one who brung ya".

191
0:09:31.329,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And I did not learn about vulnerability

192
0:09:33.827,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and courage and creativity and innovation

193
0:09:36.918,000 --> 0:09:38,000
from studying vulnerability.

194
0:09:39.744,000 --> 0:09:41,000
I learned about these things from studying shame.

195
0:09:43.532,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And so I want to walk you in to shame.

196
0:09:47.77,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Jungian analysts call shame the swampland of the soul.

197
0:09:53.386,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And we're going to walk in.

198
0:09:55.1,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And the purpose is not to walk in

199
0:09:57,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and construct a home and live there.

200
0:10:00.124,000 --> 0:10:03,000
It is to put on some galoshes --

201
0:10:03.848,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and walk through and find our way around.

202
0:10:09.023,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Here's why.

203
0:10:12.387,000 --> 0:10:17,000
We heard the most compelling call ever to have a conversation in this country,

204
0:10:17.617,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and I think globally, around race, right?

205
0:10:22.184,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Yes? We heard that.

206
0:10:23.696,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Yes?

207
0:10:25.347,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Cannot have that conversation without shame.

208
0:10:28.791,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Because you cannot talk about race without talking about privilege.

209
0:10:32.281,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And when people start talking about privilege,

210
0:10:34.448,000 --> 0:10:35,000
they get paralyzed by shame.

211
0:10:36.812,000 --> 0:10:4,000
We heard a brilliant simple solution to not killing people in surgery,

212
0:10:40.986,000 --> 0:10:41,000
which is, have a checklist.

213
0:10:43.24,000 --> 0:10:45,000
You can't fix that problem without addressing shame,

214
0:10:46.006,000 --> 0:10:48,000
because when they teach those folks how to suture,

215
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:52,000
they also teach them how to stitch their self-worth

216
0:10:52.38,000 --> 0:10:53,000
to being all-powerful.

217
0:10:54.507,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And all-powerful folks don't need checklists.

218
0:10:59.577,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And I had to write down the name of this TED Fellow

219
0:11:01.982,000 --> 0:11:02,000
so I didn't mess it up here.

220
0:11:04.212,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Myshkin Ingawale,

221
0:11:06.045,000 --> 0:11:07,000
I hope I did right by you.

222
0:11:07.807,000 --> 0:11:1,000
(Applause)

223
0:11:10.919,000 --> 0:11:11,000
I saw the TED Fellows my first day here.

224
0:11:12.875,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And he got up and he explained how he was driven to create

225
0:11:16.265,000 --> 0:11:18,000
some technology to help test for anemia,

226
0:11:18.463,000 --> 0:11:2,000
because people were dying unnecessarily.

227
0:11:21.408,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And he said, "I saw this need.

228
0:11:22.929,000 --> 0:11:23,000
So you know what I did? I made it."

229
0:11:24.92,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And everybody just burst into applause, and they were like "Yes!"

230
0:11:28.199,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And he said, "And it didn't work.

231
0:11:29.918,000 --> 0:11:3,000
(Laughter)

232
0:11:31.071,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And then I made it 32 more times,

233
0:11:34.826,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and then it worked."

234
0:11:36.715,000 --> 0:11:38,000
You know what the big secret about TED is?

235
0:11:39.033,000 --> 0:11:4,000
I can't wait to tell people this.

236
0:11:40.63,000 --> 0:11:41,000
I guess I'm doing it right now.

237
0:11:42.348,000 --> 0:11:44,000
(Laughter)

238
0:11:44.476,000 --> 0:11:46,000
This is like the failure conference.

239
0:11:46.523,000 --> 0:11:47,000
(Laughter)

240
0:11:47.801,000 --> 0:11:48,000
No, it is.

241
0:11:48.97,000 --> 0:11:5,000
(Applause)

242
0:11:51.753,000 --> 0:11:52,000
You know why this place is amazing?

243
0:11:54.978,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Because very few people here are afraid to fail.

244
0:11:59.185,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And no one who gets on the stage, so far that I've seen, has not failed.

245
0:12:02.927,000 --> 0:12:04,000
I've failed miserably, many times.

246
0:12:05.768,000 --> 0:12:07,000
I don't think the world understands that,

247
0:12:08.379,000 --> 0:12:09,000
because of shame.

248
0:12:10.718,000 --> 0:12:12,000
There's a great quote that saved me this past year

249
0:12:13.101,000 --> 0:12:14,000
by Theodore Roosevelt.

250
0:12:14.518,000 --> 0:12:17,000
A lot of people refer to it as the "Man in the Arena" quote.

251
0:12:18.604,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And it goes like this:

252
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:22,000
"It is not the critic who counts.

253
0:12:22.835,000 --> 0:12:24,000
It is not the man who sits and points out

254
0:12:25.43,000 --> 0:12:27,000
how the doer of deeds could have done things better

255
0:12:27.933,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and how he falls and stumbles.

256
0:12:29.948,000 --> 0:12:32,000
The credit goes to the man in the arena

257
0:12:33.039,000 --> 0:12:37,000
whose face is marred with dust and blood and sweat.

258
0:12:37.888,000 --> 0:12:4,000
But when he's in the arena,

259
0:12:41.3,000 --> 0:12:43,000
at best, he wins,

260
0:12:43.49,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and at worst, he loses,

261
0:12:45.374,000 --> 0:12:47,000
but when he fails, when he loses,

262
0:12:47.643,000 --> 0:12:48,000
he does so daring greatly."

263
0:12:51.228,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And that's what this conference, to me, is about.

264
0:12:53.873,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Life is about daring greatly, about being in the arena.

265
0:12:57.46,000 --> 0:13:,000
When you walk up to that arena and you put your hand on the door,

266
0:13:00.533,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and you think, "I'm going in and I'm going to try this,"

267
0:13:03.208,000 --> 0:13:04,000
shame is the gremlin

268
0:13:04.607,000 --> 0:13:06,000
who says, "Uh, uh.

269
0:13:06.853,000 --> 0:13:07,000
You're not good enough.

270
0:13:08.583,000 --> 0:13:1,000
You never finished that MBA. Your wife left you.

271
0:13:11.948,000 --> 0:13:13,000
I know your dad really wasn't in Luxembourg,

272
0:13:14.02,000 --> 0:13:15,000
he was in Sing Sing.

273
0:13:17.461,000 --> 0:13:19,000
I know those things that happened to you growing up.

274
0:13:20.986,000 --> 0:13:21,000
I know you don't think

275
0:13:22.471,000 --> 0:13:24,000
that you're pretty, smart, talented or powerful enough.

276
0:13:25.352,000 --> 0:13:28,000
I know your dad never paid attention, even when you made CFO."

277
0:13:29.884,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Shame is that thing.

278
0:13:32.417,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And if we can quiet it down and walk in

279
0:13:35.861,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and say, "I'm going to do this,"

280
0:13:39.449,000 --> 0:13:42,000
we look up and the critic that we see pointing and laughing,

281
0:13:43,000 --> 0:13:45,000
99 percent of the time is who?

282
0:13:46.635,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Us.

283
0:13:49.302,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Shame drives two big tapes --

284
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:52,000
"never good enough" --

285
0:13:53.846,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and, if you can talk it out of that one,

286
0:13:55.973,000 --> 0:13:56,000
"who do you think you are?"

287
0:13:59.339,000 --> 0:14:01,000
The thing to understand about shame is, it's not guilt.

288
0:14:02.147,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Shame is a focus on self, guilt is a focus on behavior.

289
0:14:04.982,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Shame is "I am bad."

290
0:14:06.687,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Guilt is "I did something bad."

291
0:14:09.767,000 --> 0:14:1,000
How many of you,

292
0:14:11,000 --> 0:14:13,000
if you did something that was hurtful to me,

293
0:14:13.259,000 --> 0:14:15,000
would be willing to say, "I'm sorry. I made a mistake?"

294
0:14:16.124,000 --> 0:14:18,000
How many of you would be willing to say that?

295
0:14:18.641,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Guilt: I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

296
0:14:21.387,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Shame: I'm sorry. I am a mistake.

297
0:14:25.387,000 --> 0:14:27,000
There's a huge difference between shame and guilt.

298
0:14:27.974,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And here's what you need to know.

299
0:14:29.966,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Shame is highly, highly correlated

300
0:14:32.434,000 --> 0:14:35,000
with addiction, depression, violence, aggression,

301
0:14:35.685,000 --> 0:14:37,000
bullying, suicide, eating disorders.

302
0:14:39.375,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And here's what you even need to know more.

303
0:14:41.604,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Guilt, inversely correlated with those things.

304
0:14:46.623,000 --> 0:14:49,000
The ability to hold something we've done or failed to do

305
0:14:50.083,000 --> 0:14:53,000
up against who we want to be is incredibly adaptive.

306
0:14:53.495,000 --> 0:14:55,000
It's uncomfortable, but it's adaptive.

307
0:14:59.499,000 --> 0:15:01,000
The other thing you need to know about shame

308
0:15:01.571,000 --> 0:15:03,000
is it's absolutely organized by gender.

309
0:15:05.214,000 --> 0:15:07,000
If shame washes over me and washes over Chris,

310
0:15:08.06,000 --> 0:15:09,000
it's going to feel the same.

311
0:15:10.338,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Everyone sitting in here knows the warm wash of shame.

312
0:15:13.553,000 --> 0:15:16,000
We're pretty sure that the only people who don't experience shame

313
0:15:16.625,000 --> 0:15:18,000
are people who have no capacity for connection or empathy.

314
0:15:20.125,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Which means, yes, I have a little shame;

315
0:15:22.054,000 --> 0:15:23,000
no, I'm a sociopath.

316
0:15:23.57,000 --> 0:15:25,000
So I would opt for, yes, you have a little shame.

317
0:15:29.574,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Shame feels the same for men and women,

318
0:15:31.613,000 --> 0:15:32,000
but it's organized by gender.

319
0:15:34.105,000 --> 0:15:36,000
For women,

320
0:15:36.2,000 --> 0:15:4,000
the best example I can give you is Enjoli, the commercial.

321
0:15:41.91,000 --> 0:15:44,000
"I can put the wash on the line, pack the lunches, hand out the kisses

322
0:15:45.22,000 --> 0:15:47,000
and be at work at five to nine.

323
0:15:48.037,000 --> 0:15:5,000
I can bring home the bacon, fry it up in the pan

324
0:15:50.373,000 --> 0:15:51,000
and never let you forget you're a man."

325
0:15:53.483,000 --> 0:15:55,000
For women, shame is, do it all,

326
0:15:55.995,000 --> 0:15:56,000
do it perfectly

327
0:15:57.111,000 --> 0:15:58,000
and never let them see you sweat.

328
0:16:00.504,000 --> 0:16:02,000
I don't know how much perfume that commercial sold,

329
0:16:03,000 --> 0:16:04,000
but I guarantee you,

330
0:16:04.68,000 --> 0:16:06,000
it moved a lot of antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds.

331
0:16:07.691,000 --> 0:16:1,000
(Laughter)

332
0:16:11.654,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Shame, for women, is this web

333
0:16:14.376,000 --> 0:16:17,000
of unobtainable, conflicting, competing expectations

334
0:16:18.268,000 --> 0:16:19,000
about who we're supposed to be.

335
0:16:21.506,000 --> 0:16:22,000
And it's a straight-jacket.

336
0:16:23.784,000 --> 0:16:24,000
For men,

337
0:16:25,000 --> 0:16:28,000
shame is not a bunch of competing, conflicting expectations.

338
0:16:28.449,000 --> 0:16:29,000
Shame is one,

339
0:16:30.158,000 --> 0:16:31,000
do not be perceived as what?

340
0:16:33.213,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Weak.

341
0:16:35.168,000 --> 0:16:38,000
I did not interview men for the first four years of my study.

342
0:16:38.442,000 --> 0:16:41,000
It wasn't until a man looked at me after a book signing, and said,

343
0:16:41.724,000 --> 0:16:42,000
"I love what say about shame,

344
0:16:43.276,000 --> 0:16:44,000
I'm curious why you didn't mention men."

345
0:16:45.253,000 --> 0:16:46,000
And I said, "I don't study men."

346
0:16:47.258,000 --> 0:16:48,000
And he said, "That's convenient."

347
0:16:50.313,000 --> 0:16:52,000
(Laughter)

348
0:16:53.304,000 --> 0:16:54,000
And I said, "Why?"

349
0:16:54.471,000 --> 0:16:56,000
And he said, "Because you say to reach out,

350
0:16:57.326,000 --> 0:16:59,000
tell our story,

351
0:16:59.717,000 --> 0:17:,000
be vulnerable.

352
0:17:02.278,000 --> 0:17:05,000
But you see those books you just signed for my wife and my three daughters?"

353
0:17:07.139,000 --> 0:17:08,000
I said, "Yeah."

354
0:17:09.084,000 --> 0:17:11,000
"They'd rather me die on top of my white horse

355
0:17:11.305,000 --> 0:17:12,000
than watch me fall down.

356
0:17:15.235,000 --> 0:17:16,000
When we reach out and be vulnerable,

357
0:17:17,000 --> 0:17:18,000
we get the shit beat out of us.

358
0:17:20.29,000 --> 0:17:21,000
And don't tell me

359
0:17:21.632,000 --> 0:17:23,000
it's from the guys and the coaches and the dads.

360
0:17:26.033,000 --> 0:17:29,000
Because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else."

361
0:17:30.36,000 --> 0:17:32,000
So I started interviewing men and asking questions.

362
0:17:33.864,000 --> 0:17:34,000
And what I learned is this:

363
0:17:36.566,000 --> 0:17:38,000
You show me a woman who can actually sit with a man

364
0:17:38.971,000 --> 0:17:4,000
in real vulnerability and fear,

365
0:17:41.031,000 --> 0:17:43,000
I'll show you a woman who's done incredible work.

366
0:17:44.388,000 --> 0:17:46,000
You show me a man who can sit with a woman

367
0:17:46.873,000 --> 0:17:47,000
who's just had it,

368
0:17:48.68,000 --> 0:17:51,000
she can't do it all anymore,

369
0:17:52.156,000 --> 0:17:53,000
and his first response is not,

370
0:17:54.029,000 --> 0:17:55,000
"I unloaded the dishwasher!"

371
0:17:56.497,000 --> 0:17:57,000
(Laughter)

372
0:17:57.536,000 --> 0:17:58,000
But he really listens --

373
0:17:59.521,000 --> 0:18:,000
because that's all we need --

374
0:18:01,000 --> 0:18:03,000
I'll show you a guy who's done a lot of work.

375
0:18:04.006,000 --> 0:18:06,000
Shame is an epidemic in our culture.

376
0:18:08.696,000 --> 0:18:1,000
And to get out from underneath it --

377
0:18:13.44,000 --> 0:18:15,000
to find our way back to each other,

378
0:18:15.797,000 --> 0:18:16,000
we have to understand how it affects us

379
0:18:17.702,000 --> 0:18:19,000
and how it affects the way we're parenting,

380
0:18:20.429,000 --> 0:18:22,000
the way we're working, the way we're looking at each other.

381
0:18:24.851,000 --> 0:18:27,000
Very quickly, some research by Mahalik at Boston College.

382
0:18:28.279,000 --> 0:18:31,000
He asked, what do women need to do to conform to female norms?

383
0:18:31.624,000 --> 0:18:33,000
The top answers in this country:

384
0:18:35.532,000 --> 0:18:36,000
nice, thin, modest

385
0:18:37,000 --> 0:18:39,000
and use all available resources for appearance.

386
0:18:39.266,000 --> 0:18:4,000
(Laughter)

387
0:18:41.083,000 --> 0:18:42,000
When he asked about men,

388
0:18:42.42,000 --> 0:18:46,000
what do men in this country need to do to conform with male norms,

389
0:18:46.872,000 --> 0:18:47,000
the answers were:

390
0:18:48.453,000 --> 0:18:5,000
always show emotional control,

391
0:18:50.493,000 --> 0:18:51,000
work is first,

392
0:18:52.071,000 --> 0:18:54,000
pursue status and violence.

393
0:18:55.42,000 --> 0:18:57,000
If we're going to find our way back to each other,

394
0:18:57.877,000 --> 0:18:59,000
we have to understand and know empathy,

395
0:19:,000 --> 0:19:01,000
because empathy's the antidote to shame.

396
0:19:02.619,000 --> 0:19:04,000
If you put shame in a Petri dish,

397
0:19:04.936,000 --> 0:19:06,000
it needs three things to grow exponentially:

398
0:19:07.269,000 --> 0:19:08,000
secrecy, silence and judgment.

399
0:19:09.661,000 --> 0:19:12,000
If you put the same amount in a Petri dish and douse it with empathy,

400
0:19:12.939,000 --> 0:19:13,000
it can't survive.

401
0:19:14.343,000 --> 0:19:17,000
The two most powerful words when we're in struggle:

402
0:19:17.675,000 --> 0:19:18,000
me too.

403
0:19:19.707,000 --> 0:19:21,000
And so I'll leave you with this thought.

404
0:19:23.008,000 --> 0:19:27,000
If we're going to find our way back to each other,

405
0:19:27.414,000 --> 0:19:29,000
vulnerability is going to be that path.

406
0:19:31.401,000 --> 0:19:33,000
And I know it's seductive to stand outside the arena,

407
0:19:33.938,000 --> 0:19:34,000
because I think I did it my whole life,

408
0:19:35.823,000 --> 0:19:36,000
and think to myself,

409
0:19:37.1,000 --> 0:19:39,000
I'm going to go in there and kick some ass

410
0:19:39.587,000 --> 0:19:41,000
when I'm bulletproof and when I'm perfect.

411
0:19:44.102,000 --> 0:19:45,000
And that is seductive.

412
0:19:45.436,000 --> 0:19:47,000
But the truth is, that never happens.

413
0:19:48.859,000 --> 0:19:5,000
And even if you got as perfect as you could

414
0:19:51.041,000 --> 0:19:53,000
and as bulletproof as you could possibly muster

415
0:19:53.653,000 --> 0:19:54,000
when you got in there,

416
0:19:54.772,000 --> 0:19:55,000
that's not what we want to see.

417
0:19:58.743,000 --> 0:19:59,000
We want you to go in.

418
0:20:01.743,000 --> 0:20:03,000
We want to be with you and across from you.

419
0:20:05.116,000 --> 0:20:06,000
And we just want,

420
0:20:06.832,000 --> 0:20:08,000
for ourselves and the people we care about

421
0:20:09.232,000 --> 0:20:1,000
and the people we work with,

422
0:20:11.082,000 --> 0:20:12,000
to dare greatly.

423
0:20:12.463,000 --> 0:20:14,000
So thank you all very much. I really appreciate it.

424
0:20:15,000 --> 0:20:19,000
(Applause)

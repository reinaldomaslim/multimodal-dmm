1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:29,000
You'll be happy to know that I'll be talking not about my own tragedy,

2
0:00:29.956,000 --> 0:00:3,000
but other people's tragedy.

3
0:00:31.281,000 --> 0:00:34,000
It's a lot easier to be lighthearted about other people's tragedy

4
0:00:34.374,000 --> 0:00:35,000
than your own,

5
0:00:35.549,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and I want to keep it in the spirit of the conference.

6
0:00:40.069,000 --> 0:00:42,000
So, if you believe the media accounts,

7
0:00:42.262,000 --> 0:00:46,000
being a drug dealer in the height of the crack cocaine epidemic

8
0:00:46.839,000 --> 0:00:49,000
was a very glamorous life, in the words of Virginia Postrel.

9
0:00:50.689,000 --> 0:00:54,000
There was money, there was drugs, guns, women,

10
0:00:54.892,000 --> 0:00:57,000
you know, you name it -- jewelry, bling-bling -- it had it all.

11
0:00:59.181,000 --> 0:01:04,000
What I'm going to tell you today is that, in fact, based on 10 years of research,

12
0:01:04.669,000 --> 0:01:06,000
a unique opportunity to go inside a gang --

13
0:01:07.152,000 --> 0:01:09,000
to see the actual books, the financial records of the gang --

14
0:01:10.084,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that the answer turns out not to be

15
0:01:12.476,000 --> 0:01:15,000
that being in the gang was a glamorous life.

16
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
But I think, more realistically, that being in a gang --

17
0:01:18.775,000 --> 0:01:21,000
selling drugs for a gang -- is perhaps the worst job in all of America.

18
0:01:22.705,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And that's what I'd like to convince you of today.

19
0:01:25.594,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So there are three things I want to do.

20
0:01:27.529,000 --> 0:01:3,000
First, I want to explain how and why crack cocaine

21
0:01:31.261,000 --> 0:01:35,000
had such a profound influence on inner-city gangs.

22
0:01:36.794,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Secondly, I want to tell you

23
0:01:38.625,000 --> 0:01:42,000
how somebody like me came to be able to see

24
0:01:43.525,000 --> 0:01:46,000
the inner workings of a gang -- an interesting story, I think.

25
0:01:46.906,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And then third, I want to tell you, in a very superficial way,

26
0:01:49.84,000 --> 0:01:5,000
about some of the things we found

27
0:01:51.451,000 --> 0:01:53,000
when we actually got to look at the financial records,

28
0:01:54.039,000 --> 0:01:55,000
the books, of the gang.

29
0:01:55.751,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So before I do that, just one warning,

30
0:01:59.204,000 --> 0:02:02,000
which is that this presentation has been rated 'R'

31
0:02:02.962,000 --> 0:02:04,000
by the Motion Picture Association of America.

32
0:02:05.552,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It contains adult themes, adult language.

33
0:02:08.71,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Given who is up on the stage, you'll be delighted to know

34
0:02:11.434,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that, in fact, there'll be no nudity --

35
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:16,000
(Laughter)

36
0:02:16.417,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Unexpected wardrobe malfunctions aside.

37
0:02:19.024,000 --> 0:02:23,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:23.962,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So let me start by talking about crack cocaine,

39
0:02:27.519,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and how it transformed the gang.

40
0:02:29.501,000 --> 0:02:32,000
To do that, you have to actually go back to a time before crack cocaine,

41
0:02:32.929,000 --> 0:02:35,000
in the early '80s, and look at it from the perspective of a gang leader.

42
0:02:36.363,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Being a gang leader in the inner city wasn't such a bad deal in the mid-'80s --

43
0:02:42.327,000 --> 0:02:43,000
the early '80s, let me say.

44
0:02:43.844,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Now, you had a lot of power, and you got to beat people up --

45
0:02:46.767,000 --> 0:02:48,000
you got a lot of prestige, a lot of respect.

46
0:02:49.323,000 --> 0:02:51,000
But the thing is, there was no money in it.

47
0:02:51.9,000 --> 0:02:52,000
The gang had no way to make money.

48
0:02:53.585,000 --> 0:02:55,000
You couldn't charge dues to the people in the gang,

49
0:02:56.011,000 --> 0:02:58,000
because the people in the gang didn't have any money.

50
0:02:58.645,000 --> 0:03:,000
You couldn't really make any money selling marijuana --

51
0:03:01.277,000 --> 0:03:03,000
marijuana's too cheap, it turns out.

52
0:03:03.697,000 --> 0:03:04,000
You can't get rich selling marijuana.

53
0:03:05.587,000 --> 0:03:06,000
You couldn't sell cocaine;

54
0:03:07.402,000 --> 0:03:09,000
cocaine's a great product -- powdered cocaine --

55
0:03:09.84,000 --> 0:03:1,000
but you've got to know rich white people.

56
0:03:11.83,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And most of the inner-city gang members didn't know any rich white people,

57
0:03:15.347,000 --> 0:03:16,000
so couldn't sell to that market.

58
0:03:16.91,000 --> 0:03:18,000
You couldn't really do petty crime, either.

59
0:03:18.954,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Turns out, petty crime's a terrible way to make a living.

60
0:03:21.653,000 --> 0:03:24,000
As a result, as a gang leader, you had, you know, power --

61
0:03:24.832,000 --> 0:03:26,000
it's a pretty good life -- but the thing was, in the end,

62
0:03:27.547,000 --> 0:03:28,000
you were living at home with your mother.

63
0:03:29.538,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And so it wasn't really a career.

64
0:03:31.245,000 --> 0:03:33,000
There were limits to how powerful and important you could be

65
0:03:34.107,000 --> 0:03:36,000
if you had to live at home with your mother.

66
0:03:36.203,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Then along comes crack cocaine.

67
0:03:39.306,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And in the words of Malcolm Gladwell,

68
0:03:42.345,000 --> 0:03:46,000
crack cocaine was the extra-chunky version of tomato sauce

69
0:03:46.8,000 --> 0:03:47,000
for the inner city.

70
0:03:47.975,000 --> 0:03:48,000
(Laughter)

71
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Because crack cocaine was an unbelievable innovation.

72
0:03:51.528,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I don't have time to talk about it today, but if you think about it,

73
0:03:54.773,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I would say that in the last 25 years,

74
0:03:56.64,000 --> 0:03:59,000
of every invention or innovation that's occurred in this country,

75
0:03:59.8,000 --> 0:04:,000
the biggest one in terms of impact

76
0:04:01.603,000 --> 0:04:04,000
on the well-being of people who live in the inner city,

77
0:04:05.493,000 --> 0:04:06,000
was crack cocaine.

78
0:04:06.668,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And for the worse -- not for the better, but for the worse.

79
0:04:09.473,000 --> 0:04:1,000
It had a huge impact on life.

80
0:04:10.951,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So what was it about crack cocaine?

81
0:04:12.839,000 --> 0:04:16,000
It was a brilliant way of getting the brain high.

82
0:04:17.434,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Because you could smoke crack cocaine -- you can't smoke powdered cocaine --

83
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and smoking is a much more efficient mechanism of delivering a high

84
0:04:26.409,000 --> 0:04:27,000
than snorting it.

85
0:04:27.936,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And it turned out there was this audience that didn't know it wanted crack cocaine,

86
0:04:32.409,000 --> 0:04:33,000
but when it came, it really did.

87
0:04:34.205,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And it was a perfect drug;

88
0:04:35.634,000 --> 0:04:39,000
you could buy the cocaine that went into it for a dollar,

89
0:04:39.834,000 --> 0:04:4,000
sell it for five dollars.

90
0:04:41.343,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Highly addictive -- the high was very short.

91
0:04:43.695,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So for fifteen minutes, you get this great high,

92
0:04:46.391,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and then when you come down,

93
0:04:47.772,000 --> 0:04:49,000
all you want to do is get high again.

94
0:04:50.492,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It created a wonderful market.

95
0:04:52.406,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And for the people who were there running the gang,

96
0:04:55.562,000 --> 0:04:58,000
it was a great way, seemingly, to make a lot of money.

97
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:01,000
At least for the people on the top.

98
0:05:01.209,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So this is where we enter the picture.

99
0:05:03.091,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Not really me -- I'm really a bit player in all this.

100
0:05:05.62,000 --> 0:05:07,000
My co-author, Sudhir Venkatesh, is the main character.

101
0:05:08.509,000 --> 0:05:13,000
He was a math major in college who had a good heart,

102
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and decided he wanted to get a sociology PhD,

103
0:05:16.785,000 --> 0:05:17,000
came to the University of Chicago.

104
0:05:18.438,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Now, the three months before he came to Chicago,

105
0:05:21.092,000 --> 0:05:23,000
he had spent following the Grateful Dead.

106
0:05:23.647,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And in his own words, he "looked like a freak."

107
0:05:27.138,000 --> 0:05:3,000
He's a South Asian -- very dark-skinned South Asian.

108
0:05:31.35,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Big man, and he had hair, in his words, "down to his ass."

109
0:05:35.795,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Defied all kinds of boundaries:

110
0:05:37.538,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Was he black or white? Was he man or woman?

111
0:05:39.8,000 --> 0:05:41,000
He was really a curious sight to be seen.

112
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So he showed up at the University of Chicago,

113
0:05:45.159,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and the famous sociologist William Julius Wilson

114
0:05:47.866,000 --> 0:05:52,000
was doing a book that involved surveying people all across Chicago.

115
0:05:53.514,000 --> 0:05:56,000
He took one look at Sudhir, who was going to go do some surveys for him,

116
0:05:57.162,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and decided he knew exactly the place to send him,

117
0:05:59.556,000 --> 0:06:02,000
which was to one of the toughest, most notorious housing projects

118
0:06:02.704,000 --> 0:06:04,000
not just in Chicago, but in the entire United States.

119
0:06:05.219,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So Sudhir, the suburban boy who had never really been in the inner city,

120
0:06:08.912,000 --> 0:06:12,000
dutifully took his clipboard and walked down to this housing project,

121
0:06:13.839,000 --> 0:06:14,000
gets to the first building.

122
0:06:15.767,000 --> 0:06:17,000
The first building? Well, there's nobody there.

123
0:06:18.264,000 --> 0:06:21,000
But he hears some voices up in the stairwell,

124
0:06:21.418,000 --> 0:06:24,000
so he climbs up the stairwell, comes around the corner,

125
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and finds a group of young African-American men playing dice.

126
0:06:30.293,000 --> 0:06:32,000
This is about 1990, peak of the crack epidemic.

127
0:06:33.296,000 --> 0:06:35,000
This is a very dangerous job, being in a gang.

128
0:06:35.478,000 --> 0:06:36,000
You don't like to be surprised.

129
0:06:37.017,000 --> 0:06:4,000
You don't like to be surprised by people who come around the corner.

130
0:06:40.554,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And the mantra was: shoot first; ask questions later.

131
0:06:43.902,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Now, Sudhir was lucky -- he was such a freak,

132
0:06:46.108,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and that clipboard probably saved his life,

133
0:06:48.343,000 --> 0:06:5,000
because they figured no other rival gang member

134
0:06:50.59,000 --> 0:06:52,000
would be coming up to shoot at them with a clipboard.

135
0:06:53.109,000 --> 0:06:54,000
(Laughter)

136
0:06:54.134,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So his greeting was not particularly warm, but they did say,

137
0:06:57.189,000 --> 0:07:,000
well, OK -- let's hear your questions on your survey.

138
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So -- I kid you not --

139
0:07:02.489,000 --> 0:07:05,000
the first question on the survey that he was sent to ask was:

140
0:07:06.3,000 --> 0:07:08,000
"How do you feel about being poor and Black in America?"

141
0:07:09.03,000 --> 0:07:12,000
(Laughter)

142
0:07:12.185,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Makes you wonder about academics.

143
0:07:13.9,000 --> 0:07:14,000
(Laughter)

144
0:07:15.828,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So the choice of answers were:

145
0:07:17.733,000 --> 0:07:2,000
[A) Very Good B) Good C) Bad D) Very Bad]

146
0:07:21.404,000 --> 0:07:23,000
(Laughter)

147
0:07:23.429,000 --> 0:07:26,000
What Sudhir found out is, in fact, that the real answer was the following:

148
0:07:26.958,000 --> 0:07:28,000
[A) Very Good B) Good C) Bad D) Very Bad E) Fuck you]

149
0:07:29.857,000 --> 0:07:3,000
(Laughter)

150
0:07:31.478,000 --> 0:07:34,000
The survey was not, in the end, going to be what got Sudhir off the hook.

151
0:07:35.022,000 --> 0:07:38,000
He was held hostage overnight in the stairwell.

152
0:07:38.526,000 --> 0:07:39,000
There was a lot of gunfire,

153
0:07:39.855,000 --> 0:07:42,000
there were a lot of philosophical discussions he had with the gang members.

154
0:07:43.498,000 --> 0:07:44,000
By morning, the gang leader arrived,

155
0:07:45.272,000 --> 0:07:47,000
checked out Sudhir, decided he was no threat,

156
0:07:47.414,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and they let him go home.

157
0:07:48.66,000 --> 0:07:51,000
So Sudhir went home, took a shower, took a nap.

158
0:07:51.812,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And you and I, probably, faced with the situation, would think,

159
0:07:56.635,000 --> 0:07:59,000
"I guess I'm going to write my dissertation on The Grateful Dead,

160
0:07:59.731,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I've been following them for the last three months."

161
0:08:02.194,000 --> 0:08:03,000
(Laughter)

162
0:08:03.226,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Sudhir, on the other hand,

163
0:08:04.509,000 --> 0:08:06,000
got right back, walked down to the housing project,

164
0:08:06.954,000 --> 0:08:07,000
went up to the second floor,

165
0:08:08.321,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and said: "Hey, guys, I had so much fun hanging out with you last night,

166
0:08:12.247,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I wonder if I could do it again tonight."

167
0:08:14.249,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And that was the beginning of what turned out to be a beautiful relationship

168
0:08:17.904,000 --> 0:08:2,000
that involved Sudhir living in the housing project on and off for 10 years,

169
0:08:21.523,000 --> 0:08:25,000
hanging out in crack houses, going to jail with the gang members,

170
0:08:26.302,000 --> 0:08:28,000
having the windows shot out of his car,

171
0:08:28.864,000 --> 0:08:31,000
having the police break into his apartment and steal his computer disks --

172
0:08:32.386,000 --> 0:08:33,000
you name it.

173
0:08:33.568,000 --> 0:08:35,000
But ultimately, the story has a happy ending for Sudhir,

174
0:08:36.408,000 --> 0:08:39,000
who became one of the most respected sociologists in the country.

175
0:08:39.675,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And especially for me,

176
0:08:41.068,000 --> 0:08:44,000
as I sat in my office with my Excel spreadsheet open,

177
0:08:44.511,000 --> 0:08:47,000
waiting for Sudhir to come and deliver to me the latest load of data

178
0:08:47.872,000 --> 0:08:48,000
that he would get from the gang.

179
0:08:49.782,000 --> 0:08:52,000
(Laughter)

180
0:08:53.575,000 --> 0:08:56,000
It was one of the most unequal co-authoring relationships ever --

181
0:08:57.003,000 --> 0:08:58,000
(Laughter)

182
0:08:58.047,000 --> 0:09:01,000
But I was glad to be the beneficiary of it.

183
0:09:01.562,000 --> 0:09:02,000
So what did we find?

184
0:09:03.389,000 --> 0:09:04,000
What did we find in the gang?

185
0:09:05.771,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Well, let me say one thing:

186
0:09:07.481,000 --> 0:09:1,000
We really got access to everybody in the gang.

187
0:09:11.108,000 --> 0:09:15,000
We got an inside look at the gang, from the very bottom up to the very top.

188
0:09:15.456,000 --> 0:09:19,000
They trusted Sudhir, in ways that really no academic has ever --

189
0:09:20.466,000 --> 0:09:24,000
or really anybody, any outsider -- has ever earned the trust of these gangs,

190
0:09:25.042,000 --> 0:09:27,000
to the point where they actually opened up

191
0:09:27.523,000 --> 0:09:29,000
what was most interesting for me -- their books,

192
0:09:29.804,000 --> 0:09:3,000
the financial records they kept.

193
0:09:31.367,000 --> 0:09:34,000
They made them available to us, and we not only could study them,

194
0:09:34.463,000 --> 0:09:36,000
but we could ask them questions about what was in them.

195
0:09:37.083,000 --> 0:09:4,000
So if I have to kind of summarize very quickly in the short time I have

196
0:09:40.533,000 --> 0:09:43,000
what the bottom line of what I take away from the gang is,

197
0:09:44.507,000 --> 0:09:46,000
it's that, if I had to draw a parallel between the gang

198
0:09:47.241,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and any other organization,

199
0:09:49.384,000 --> 0:09:52,000
it would be that the gang is just like McDonald's,

200
0:09:52.699,000 --> 0:09:54,000
in a lot of different respects -- the restaurant McDonald's.

201
0:09:55.572,000 --> 0:09:56,000
So first, in one way,

202
0:09:57.214,000 --> 0:10:,000
which isn't maybe the most interesting way, but it's a good way to start --

203
0:10:00.853,000 --> 0:10:02,000
is in the way it's organized, the hierarchy of the gang,

204
0:10:03.523,000 --> 0:10:04,000
the way it looks.

205
0:10:04.698,000 --> 0:10:06,000
So here's what the org chart of the gang looks like.

206
0:10:07.176,000 --> 0:10:09,000
I don't know if you know much about org charts,

207
0:10:09.407,000 --> 0:10:12,000
but if you were to assign a stripped-down and simplified McDonald's org chart,

208
0:10:13.138,000 --> 0:10:14,000
this is exactly what it would look like.

209
0:10:15.116,000 --> 0:10:17,000
It's amazing, but the top level of the gang,

210
0:10:17.334,000 --> 0:10:19,000
they actually call themselves the "Board of Directors."

211
0:10:19.985,000 --> 0:10:2,000
(Laughter)

212
0:10:21.088,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And Sudhir says

213
0:10:23.059,000 --> 0:10:26,000
it's not like these guys had a very sophisticated view

214
0:10:26.477,000 --> 0:10:29,000
of what happened in American corporate life,

215
0:10:29.966,000 --> 0:10:31,000
but they had seen movies like "Wall Street,"

216
0:10:32.055,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and they had learned a little bit about what it was like

217
0:10:35.454,000 --> 0:10:36,000
to be in the real world.

218
0:10:37.429,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Now, below that board of directors,

219
0:10:39.287,000 --> 0:10:41,000
you've got essentially what are regional VPs --

220
0:10:41.716,000 --> 0:10:44,000
people who control, say, the South Side of Chicago, or the West Side of Chicago.

221
0:10:45.525,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Sudhir got to know very well the guy who had the unfortunate assignment

222
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:51,000
of trying to take the Iowa franchise,

223
0:10:51.363,000 --> 0:10:53,000
which, it turned out, for this black gang,

224
0:10:53.448,000 --> 0:10:57,000
was not one of the more brilliant financial endeavors they undertook.

225
0:10:57.57,000 --> 0:10:58,000
(Laughter)

226
0:10:58.848,000 --> 0:11:02,000
But the thing that really makes the gang seem like McDonald's is its franchisees.

227
0:11:03.168,000 --> 0:11:07,000
The guys who are running the local gangs --

228
0:11:07.532,000 --> 0:11:09,000
the four-square-block by four-square-block areas --

229
0:11:10.507,000 --> 0:11:13,000
they're just like the guys, in some sense, who are running the McDonald's.

230
0:11:14.033,000 --> 0:11:15,000
They are the entrepreneurs.

231
0:11:15.526,000 --> 0:11:18,000
They get the exclusive property rights to control the drug-selling.

232
0:11:19.286,000 --> 0:11:25,000
They get the name of the gang behind them, for merchandising and marketing.

233
0:11:26.298,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And they're the ones who basically make the profit or lose a profit,

234
0:11:29.663,000 --> 0:11:31,000
depending on how good they are at running the business.

235
0:11:32.266,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Now, the group I really want you to think about, though,

236
0:11:35.195,000 --> 0:11:37,000
are the ones at the bottom -- the foot soldiers.

237
0:11:37.472,000 --> 0:11:39,000
These are the teenagers, typically,

238
0:11:39.544,000 --> 0:11:42,000
who'd be standing out on the street corner, selling the drugs.

239
0:11:42.592,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Extremely dangerous work.

240
0:11:45.036,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And important to note is that almost all of the weight, all of the people

241
0:11:50.438,000 --> 0:11:53,000
in this organization are at the bottom -- just like McDonald's.

242
0:11:53.519,000 --> 0:11:55,000
So in some sense, the foot soldiers are a lot like the people

243
0:11:56.503,000 --> 0:11:57,000
who are taking your order at McDonald's,

244
0:11:58.493,000 --> 0:12:,000
and it's not just by chance that they're like them.

245
0:12:00.955,000 --> 0:12:02,000
In fact, in these neighborhoods, they'd be the same people.

246
0:12:03.78,000 --> 0:12:05,000
So the same kids who are working in the gang were actually,

247
0:12:06.705,000 --> 0:12:08,000
at the very same time, typically working part-time

248
0:12:09.488,000 --> 0:12:1,000
at a place like McDonald's.

249
0:12:11.043,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Which already foreshadows the main result that I've talked about,

250
0:12:14.458,000 --> 0:12:17,000
about what a crappy job it was, being in the gang.

251
0:12:17.572,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Because obviously, if being in the gang were such a wonderful, lucrative job,

252
0:12:21.247,000 --> 0:12:24,000
why in the world would these guys moonlight at McDonald's?

253
0:12:24.515,000 --> 0:12:27,000
So what do the wages look like? You might be surprised.

254
0:12:27.587,000 --> 0:12:3,000
But based on being able to talk to them and to see their records,

255
0:12:31.238,000 --> 0:12:33,000
this is what it looks like in terms of the wages.

256
0:12:33.732,000 --> 0:12:37,000
The hourly wage the foot soldiers were earning was $3.50 an hour.

257
0:12:37.846,000 --> 0:12:4,000
It was below the minimum wage. And this is well-documented.

258
0:12:41.259,000 --> 0:12:43,000
It's easy to see by the patterns of consumption they have.

259
0:12:44.146,000 --> 0:12:46,000
It really is not fiction -- it's fact.

260
0:12:47.145,000 --> 0:12:5,000
There was very little money in the gang, especially at the bottom.

261
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Now if you managed to rise up, say, and be that local leader,

262
0:12:54.409,000 --> 0:12:56,000
the guy who's the equivalent of the McDonald's franchisee,

263
0:12:57.17,000 --> 0:12:58,000
you'd be making 100,000 dollars a year.

264
0:12:59.079,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And that, in some ways, was the best job you could hope to get

265
0:13:02.429,000 --> 0:13:05,000
if you were growing up in one of these neighborhoods as a young black male.

266
0:13:06.111,000 --> 0:13:07,000
If you managed to rise to the very top,

267
0:13:08.03,000 --> 0:13:1,000
200,000 or 400,000 dollars a year is what you'd hope to make.

268
0:13:10.979,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Truly, you would be a great success story.

269
0:13:13.732,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And one of the sad parts of this is that, indeed,

270
0:13:16.832,000 --> 0:13:18,000
among the many other ramifications of crack cocaine

271
0:13:19.401,000 --> 0:13:23,000
is that the most talented individuals in these communities --

272
0:13:23.555,000 --> 0:13:24,000
this is what they were striving for.

273
0:13:25.31,000 --> 0:13:27,000
They weren't trying to make it in legitimate ways,

274
0:13:27.802,000 --> 0:13:29,000
because there were no legitimate channels out.

275
0:13:30.016,000 --> 0:13:31,000
This was the best way out.

276
0:13:31.413,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And it actually was the right choice, probably,

277
0:13:34.108,000 --> 0:13:37,000
to try to make it out this way.

278
0:13:38.117,000 --> 0:13:39,000
You look at this,

279
0:13:39.425,000 --> 0:13:41,000
the relationship to McDonald's breaks down here.

280
0:13:42.368,000 --> 0:13:43,000
The money looks about the same.

281
0:13:44.327,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Why is it such a bad job?

282
0:13:45.793,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Well, the reason it's such a bad job is that there's somebody shooting at you

283
0:13:49.533,000 --> 0:13:5,000
a lot of the time.

284
0:13:51.119,000 --> 0:13:53,000
So, with shooting at you, what are the death rates?

285
0:13:54,000 --> 0:13:55,000
We found, in our gang --

286
0:13:55.181,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and admittedly, this was not really a standard situation;

287
0:13:58.441,000 --> 0:14:02,000
this was a time of intense violence, of a lot of gang wars,

288
0:14:02.907,000 --> 0:14:04,000
as this gang actually became quite successful.

289
0:14:05.59,000 --> 0:14:06,000
But there were costs.

290
0:14:06.85,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And so the death rate --

291
0:14:08.619,000 --> 0:14:12,000
not to mention the rate of being arrested, sent to prison, being wounded --

292
0:14:13.603,000 --> 0:14:17,000
the death rate in our sample was seven percent per person per year.

293
0:14:18.332,000 --> 0:14:19,000
You're in the gang for four years,

294
0:14:20.087,000 --> 0:14:24,000
you expect to die with about a 25 percent likelihood.

295
0:14:24.627,000 --> 0:14:26,000
That is about as high as you can get.

296
0:14:26.753,000 --> 0:14:27,000
So for comparison's purposes,

297
0:14:28.624,000 --> 0:14:33,000
let's think about some other walk of life you may expect might be extremely risky.

298
0:14:33.65,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Let's say that you were a murderer

299
0:14:35.666,000 --> 0:14:38,000
and you were convicted of murder, and you're sent to death row.

300
0:14:38.891,000 --> 0:14:41,000
It turns out, the death rates on death row from all causes, including execution:

301
0:14:42.884,000 --> 0:14:43,000
two percent a year.

302
0:14:44.064,000 --> 0:14:45,000
(Laughter)

303
0:14:45.089,000 --> 0:14:48,000
So it's a lot safer being on death row

304
0:14:48.746,000 --> 0:14:5,000
than it is selling drugs out on the street.

305
0:14:51.844,000 --> 0:14:53,000
That gives you some pause, for those of you who believe

306
0:14:54.746,000 --> 0:14:58,000
that a death penalty's going to have an enormous deterrent effect on crime.

307
0:15:00.556,000 --> 0:15:03,000
To give you a sense of just how bad the inner city was during crack --

308
0:15:03.895,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and I'm not really focusing on the negatives,

309
0:15:06.653,000 --> 0:15:08,000
but really, there's another story to tell you there --

310
0:15:09.597,000 --> 0:15:12,000
if you look at the death rates just of random, young black males

311
0:15:13.359,000 --> 0:15:15,000
growing up in the inner city in the United States,

312
0:15:15.77,000 --> 0:15:17,000
the death rates during crack were about one percent.

313
0:15:18.57,000 --> 0:15:19,000
That's extremely high.

314
0:15:19.746,000 --> 0:15:21,000
And this is violent death -- it's unbelievable, in some sense.

315
0:15:22.761,000 --> 0:15:26,000
To put it into perspective: if you compare this to the soldiers in Iraq,

316
0:15:27.515,000 --> 0:15:3,000
for instance, right now fighting the war: 0.5 percent.

317
0:15:31.205,000 --> 0:15:34,000
So in some very literal way,

318
0:15:34.266,000 --> 0:15:36,000
the young black men who were growing up in this country

319
0:15:37.198,000 --> 0:15:38,000
were living in a war zone,

320
0:15:39.035,000 --> 0:15:45,000
very much in the sense that the soldiers over in Iraq are fighting in a war.

321
0:15:45.829,000 --> 0:15:48,000
So why in the world, you might ask,

322
0:15:48.868,000 --> 0:15:51,000
would anybody be willing to stand out on a street corner

323
0:15:52.687,000 --> 0:15:54,000
selling drugs for $3.50 an hour,

324
0:15:55,000 --> 0:15:57,000
with a 25 percent chance of dying over the next four years?

325
0:15:58,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Why would they do that?

326
0:15:59.959,000 --> 0:16:01,000
And I think there are a couple answers.

327
0:16:02.806,000 --> 0:16:07,000
I think the first one is that they got fooled by history.

328
0:16:08.513,000 --> 0:16:1,000
It used to be the gang was a rite of passage;

329
0:16:10.854,000 --> 0:16:12,000
that the young people controlled the gang;

330
0:16:12.912,000 --> 0:16:14,000
that as you got older, you dropped out of the gang.

331
0:16:16.463,000 --> 0:16:17,000
So what happened was,

332
0:16:17.663,000 --> 0:16:2,000
the people who happened to be in the right place at the right time --

333
0:16:20.965,000 --> 0:16:25,000
the people who happened to be leading the gang in the mid-to-late-'80s --

334
0:16:26.405,000 --> 0:16:27,000
became very, very wealthy.

335
0:16:28.388,000 --> 0:16:3,000
And so the logical thing to think

336
0:16:30.516,000 --> 0:16:33,000
was that they are going to age out of the gang

337
0:16:33.664,000 --> 0:16:34,000
like everybody else has,

338
0:16:34.885,000 --> 0:16:37,000
and the next generation is going to take over and get the wealth.

339
0:16:38.024,000 --> 0:16:4,000
There are striking similarities, I think, to the Internet boom.

340
0:16:41.033,000 --> 0:16:44,000
The first set of people in Silicon Valley got very, very rich.

341
0:16:44.283,000 --> 0:16:48,000
And then all of my friends said, "Maybe I should go do that, too."

342
0:16:48.397,000 --> 0:16:52,000
And they were willing to work very cheap for stock options that never came.

343
0:16:53.025,000 --> 0:16:55,000
In some sense, that's what happened, exactly,

344
0:16:55.423,000 --> 0:16:58,000
to the set of people we were looking at.

345
0:16:58.961,000 --> 0:17:,000
They were willing to start at the bottom,

346
0:17:01.18,000 --> 0:17:04,000
just like, say, a first-year lawyer at a law firm

347
0:17:04.261,000 --> 0:17:06,000
is willing to start at the bottom,

348
0:17:06.456,000 --> 0:17:08,000
work 80-hour weeks for not that much money,

349
0:17:08.543,000 --> 0:17:1,000
because they think they're going to make partner.

350
0:17:10.876,000 --> 0:17:12,000
But the rules changed, and they never got to make partner.

351
0:17:13.686,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Indeed, the same people who were running all of the major gangs in the late 1980s

352
0:17:17.569,000 --> 0:17:19,000
are still running the major gangs in Chicago today.

353
0:17:19.999,000 --> 0:17:2,000
They never passed on any of the wealth,

354
0:17:21.906,000 --> 0:17:23,000
So everybody got stuck at that $3.50-an-hour job,

355
0:17:24.774,000 --> 0:17:25,000
and it turned out to be a disaster.

356
0:17:27.31,000 --> 0:17:31,000
The other thing the gang was very good at was marketing and trickery.

357
0:17:31.597,000 --> 0:17:34,000
And so for instance, one thing the gang would do is --

358
0:17:35.269,000 --> 0:17:37,000
the gang leaders would have big entourages,

359
0:17:37.525,000 --> 0:17:4,000
and they'd drive fancy cars and have fancy jewelry.

360
0:17:40.761,000 --> 0:17:43,000
So what Sudhir eventually realized as he hung out with them more,

361
0:17:43.871,000 --> 0:17:46,000
is that, really, they didn't own those cars -- they just leased them,

362
0:17:47.155,000 --> 0:17:49,000
because they couldn't afford to own the fancy cars.

363
0:17:49.858,000 --> 0:17:52,000
And they didn't really have gold jewelry, they had gold-plated jewelry.

364
0:17:53.344,000 --> 0:17:56,000
It goes back to, you know, the real-real versus the fake-real.

365
0:17:56.728,000 --> 0:17:59,000
And really, they did all sorts of things to trick the young people

366
0:18:00.714,000 --> 0:18:02,000
into thinking what a great deal the gang was going to be.

367
0:18:03.531,000 --> 0:18:05,000
So for instance, they would give a 14-year-old kid

368
0:18:06.346,000 --> 0:18:09,000
a whole roll of bills to hold.

369
0:18:09.496,000 --> 0:18:11,000
That 14-year-old kid would say to his friends,

370
0:18:12.35,000 --> 0:18:14,000
"Hey, look at all the money I got in the gang."

371
0:18:14.581,000 --> 0:18:15,000
It wasn't his money -- until he spent it,

372
0:18:16.582,000 --> 0:18:17,000
and then he was in debt to the gang,

373
0:18:18.325,000 --> 0:18:2,000
and was sort of an indentured servant for a while.

374
0:18:20.738,000 --> 0:18:21,000
So I have a couple minutes.

375
0:18:22.312,000 --> 0:18:26,000
Let me do one last thing I hadn't thought I'd have time to do,

376
0:18:26.381,000 --> 0:18:31,000
which is to talk about what we learned more generally about economics,

377
0:18:31.659,000 --> 0:18:33,000
from the study of the gang.

378
0:18:33.69,000 --> 0:18:36,000
So, economists tend to talk in technical words.

379
0:18:37.269,000 --> 0:18:4,000
Often, our theories fail quite miserably when we over the data,

380
0:18:40.894,000 --> 0:18:42,000
but what's kind of interesting is that in this setting,

381
0:18:43.704,000 --> 0:18:45,000
it turned out that some of the economic theories

382
0:18:46.045,000 --> 0:18:48,000
that worked not so well in the real economy

383
0:18:48.204,000 --> 0:18:5,000
worked very well in the drug economy,

384
0:18:50.418,000 --> 0:18:52,000
in some sense, because it's unfettered capitalism.

385
0:18:52.808,000 --> 0:18:53,000
Here's an economic principle.

386
0:18:54.225,000 --> 0:18:56,000
This is one of the basic ideas in labor economics,

387
0:18:56.591,000 --> 0:18:57,000
called a "compensating differential."

388
0:18:58.399,000 --> 0:19:01,000
It's the idea that the increment to wages that a worker requires

389
0:19:01.865,000 --> 0:19:03,000
to leave him indifferent between performing two tasks,

390
0:19:04.503,000 --> 0:19:06,000
one which is more unpleasant than the other.

391
0:19:06.632,000 --> 0:19:09,000
Compensating differential -- it's why we think garbagemen might be paid more

392
0:19:10.302,000 --> 0:19:11,000
than people who work in parks.

393
0:19:11.86,000 --> 0:19:16,000
The words of one of the members of the gang, I think, make this clear.

394
0:19:17.806,000 --> 0:19:19,000
So it turns out -- I'm sort of getting ahead of myself --

395
0:19:20.52,000 --> 0:19:23,000
it turns out, in the gang, when there's a war going on,

396
0:19:23.697,000 --> 0:19:26,000
they actually pay the foot soldiers twice as much money.

397
0:19:26.738,000 --> 0:19:27,000
It's exactly this concept.

398
0:19:28.051,000 --> 0:19:3,000
Because they're not willing to be at risk.

399
0:19:30.707,000 --> 0:19:33,000
And the words of a gang member capture it quite nicely, he says:

400
0:19:33.753,000 --> 0:19:36,000
"Would you stand around here when all this shit ..." -- the shooting --

401
0:19:37.127,000 --> 0:19:39,000
"... if all this shit's going on? No, right?

402
0:19:39.264,000 --> 0:19:42,000
So if I gonna be asked to put my life on the line, then front me the cash, man."

403
0:19:43.094,000 --> 0:19:45,000
I think the gang member says it much more articulately

404
0:19:45.666,000 --> 0:19:47,000
than the economist, about what's going on.

405
0:19:47.707,000 --> 0:19:48,000
(Laughter)

406
0:19:49.346,000 --> 0:19:5,000
Here's another one.

407
0:19:51,000 --> 0:19:52,000
Economists talk about game theory,

408
0:19:52.666,000 --> 0:19:54,000
that every two-person game has a Nash equilibrium.

409
0:19:55.048,000 --> 0:19:57,000
Here's the translation you get from the gang member.

410
0:19:57.53,000 --> 0:20:,000
They're talking about the decision of why they don't go shoot --

411
0:20:00.907,000 --> 0:20:03,000
One thing that turns out to be a great business tactic in the gang:

412
0:20:04.797,000 --> 0:20:07,000
if you go and just shoot guns in the air in the other gang's territory --

413
0:20:08.703,000 --> 0:20:09,000
people are afraid to go buy drugs there,

414
0:20:10.668,000 --> 0:20:12,000
they're going to come into your neighborhood.

415
0:20:12.8,000 --> 0:20:14,000
Here's what he says about why they don't do that:

416
0:20:15.12,000 --> 0:20:18,000
"If we start shooting around there, the other gang's territory,

417
0:20:18.165,000 --> 0:20:2,000
nobody, I mean, you dig it, nobody gonna step on their turf.

418
0:20:21.072,000 --> 0:20:22,000
But we gotta be careful,

419
0:20:22.248,000 --> 0:20:24,000
'cause they can shoot around here too and then we all fucked."

420
0:20:25.198,000 --> 0:20:26,000
(Laughter)

421
0:20:26.223,000 --> 0:20:27,000
So that's the same concept.

422
0:20:27.545,000 --> 0:20:29,000
Then again, sometimes economists get it wrong.

423
0:20:29.783,000 --> 0:20:33,000
One thing we observed in the data is that it looked like --

424
0:20:34.478,000 --> 0:20:37,000
the gang leader always got paid.

425
0:20:37.782,000 --> 0:20:41,000
No matter how bad it was economically, he always got himself paid.

426
0:20:42.258,000 --> 0:20:44,000
We had some theories related to cash flow,

427
0:20:44.432,000 --> 0:20:46,000
and lack of access to capital markets, and things like that.

428
0:20:47.287,000 --> 0:20:48,000
Then we asked the gang member,

429
0:20:48.747,000 --> 0:20:51,000
"Why is it you always get paid and your workers don't always get paid?"

430
0:20:52.124,000 --> 0:20:53,000
His response is,

431
0:20:53.299,000 --> 0:20:56,000
"You got all these niggers below you who want your job, you dig?

432
0:20:56.41,000 --> 0:20:58,000
If you start taking losses, they see you as weak and shit."

433
0:20:59.217,000 --> 0:21:,000
And I thought about it and said,

434
0:21:00.789,000 --> 0:21:03,000
"CEOs often pay themselves million-dollar bonuses,

435
0:21:04.454,000 --> 0:21:06,000
even when companies are losing a lot of money.

436
0:21:06.79,000 --> 0:21:08,000
And it never would really occur to an economist

437
0:21:09.029,000 --> 0:21:11,000
that this idea of 'weak and shit' could really be important."

438
0:21:11.949,000 --> 0:21:14,000
(Laughter)

439
0:21:15.239,000 --> 0:21:2,000
Maybe "weak and shit" is an important hypothesis that needs more analysis.

440
0:21:21,000 --> 0:21:22,000
Thank you very much.

441
0:21:22.175,000 --> 0:21:23,000
(Applause)

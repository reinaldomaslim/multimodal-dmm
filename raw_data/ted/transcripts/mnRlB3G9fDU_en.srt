1
0:00:12.727,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So, imagine a company hires a new employee,

2
0:00:17.036,000 --> 0:00:18,000
best in the business,

3
0:00:18.32,000 --> 0:00:2,000
who's on a multimillion-dollar contract.

4
0:00:21.307,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Now imagine that whenever this employee went to go meet with her team members,

5
0:00:25.947,000 --> 0:00:27,000
the appointments were ignored or dismissed,

6
0:00:28.769,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and in the meetings that did happen,

7
0:00:30.509,000 --> 0:00:33,000
she was yelled at or kicked out after a few minutes.

8
0:00:34.166,000 --> 0:00:37,000
So after a while, she just went quietly back to her desk,

9
0:00:37.714,000 --> 0:00:4,000
sat there with none of her skills being put to use,

10
0:00:41.086,000 --> 0:00:43,000
of course, being ignored by most people,

11
0:00:43.282,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and of course, still getting paid millions of dollars.

12
0:00:46.467,000 --> 0:00:49,000
This hotshot employee who can't seem to catch a break

13
0:00:49.835,000 --> 0:00:51,000
is that company's technology.

14
0:00:53.308,000 --> 0:00:55,000
This scenario is not an exaggeration.

15
0:00:56.611,000 --> 0:00:58,000
In my job as a technology advisor,

16
0:00:58.809,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I've seen so many companies make the well-meaning decisions

17
0:01:02.266,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to put huge investments into technology,

18
0:01:05.03,000 --> 0:01:08,000
only to have the benefits fail to live up to the expectation.

19
0:01:08.718,000 --> 0:01:09,000
In fact, in one study I read,

20
0:01:10.512,000 --> 0:01:12,000
25 percent of technology projects

21
0:01:13.308,000 --> 0:01:17,000
are canceled or deliver things that are never used.

22
0:01:17.614,000 --> 0:01:2,000
That's like billions of dollars just being wasted each year.

23
0:01:22.138,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So why is this?

24
0:01:24.184,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Well, from what I've seen,

25
0:01:25.602,000 --> 0:01:29,000
the expectation from the top management is high but not unreasonable

26
0:01:29.645,000 --> 0:01:31,000
about the benefits from the technology.

27
0:01:31.795,000 --> 0:01:33,000
They expect people will use them,

28
0:01:34.719,000 --> 0:01:35,000
it will create time savings,

29
0:01:36.205,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and people will become genuinely better at their jobs.

30
0:01:39.568,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But the reality is that the people on the front line,

31
0:01:42.406,000 --> 0:01:44,000
who are supposed to be using these softwares and tools,

32
0:01:45.337,000 --> 0:01:47,000
they're skeptical or even afraid.

33
0:01:48.344,000 --> 0:01:5,000
We postpone the online trainings,

34
0:01:50.619,000 --> 0:01:52,000
we don't bother to learn the shortcuts,

35
0:01:52.706,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and we get frustrated at the number of tools

36
0:01:55.077,000 --> 0:01:57,000
we have to remember how to log into and use.

37
0:01:57.486,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Right?

38
0:01:58.808,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And that frustration, that guilt -- it's racking up,

39
0:02:01.995,000 --> 0:02:05,000
the more that technology is inserting itself into our daily working lives,

40
0:02:06.875,000 --> 0:02:07,000
which is a lot.

41
0:02:08.715,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Brookings says that 70 percent of jobs today in the US

42
0:02:12.434,000 --> 0:02:14,000
require at least mid-level digital skills.

43
0:02:15.768,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So basically, to work these days,

44
0:02:18.369,000 --> 0:02:21,000
you need to be able to work with technology.

45
0:02:21.586,000 --> 0:02:22,000
But from what I've seen,

46
0:02:23.057,000 --> 0:02:26,000
we are not approaching this with the right mindset.

47
0:02:27.157,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So here's the idea that I've been toying with:

48
0:02:31.096,000 --> 0:02:34,000
What if we treated technology like a team member?

49
0:02:36.004,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I've been writing my own personal experiment about this.

50
0:02:38.858,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I've spoken to people from all different industries

51
0:02:41.476,000 --> 0:02:45,000
about how they can treat their core technologies like colleagues.

52
0:02:46.816,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I've met with people from the restaurant industry,

53
0:02:49.682,000 --> 0:02:52,000
medical professionals, teachers, bankers,

54
0:02:52.826,000 --> 0:02:53,000
people from many other sectors,

55
0:02:54.635,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and the first step with anybody that I would meet with

56
0:02:57.5,000 --> 0:02:59,000
was to draw out the structure of their teams

57
0:02:59.671,000 --> 0:03:,000
in an organization chart.

58
0:03:02.242,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Now, I'm a total geek when it comes to organization charts.

59
0:03:06.658,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Org charts are really cool because, if they are drawn well,

60
0:03:10.094,000 --> 0:03:12,000
you can quickly get a sense of what individual roles are

61
0:03:13.104,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and also how a team works well together.

62
0:03:15.84,000 --> 0:03:17,000
But if you look at a typical org chart,

63
0:03:18.343,000 --> 0:03:21,000
it only includes the boxes and lines that represent people.

64
0:03:22.286,000 --> 0:03:25,000
None of the technology team members are there.

65
0:03:25.457,000 --> 0:03:26,000
They're all invisible.

66
0:03:27.137,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So for each of the organizations that I met with for my experiment,

67
0:03:31.718,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I had to draw a new type of org chart,

68
0:03:34.412,000 --> 0:03:36,000
one that also included the technology.

69
0:03:37.434,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And when I did this, people I spoke to

70
0:03:39.695,000 --> 0:03:42,000
could actually visualize their technologies as coworkers,

71
0:03:43.566,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and they could ask things like:

72
0:03:45.485,000 --> 0:03:47,000
"Is this software reporting to the right person?"

73
0:03:48.098,000 --> 0:03:51,000
"Does this man and machine team work well together?"

74
0:03:51.268,000 --> 0:03:53,000
"Is that technology actually the team member

75
0:03:54.016,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that everybody's awkwardly avoiding?"

76
0:03:56.964,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So I will walk you through an example of a small catering company

77
0:04:00.923,000 --> 0:04:01,000
to bring this experiment to life.

78
0:04:03.579,000 --> 0:04:07,000
This is the top layer of people who work at Bovingdons Catering Company.

79
0:04:08.075,000 --> 0:04:11,000
There's a sales director, who manages all of the customer interactions,

80
0:04:12.064,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and there's an operations director, who manages all the internal activities.

81
0:04:16.222,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And here's the people who report to the sales and operations directors.

82
0:04:20.552,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And finally, here's the view

83
0:04:22.258,000 --> 0:04:24,000
where we've overlaid the software and the hardware

84
0:04:24.921,000 --> 0:04:25,000
that's used by the Bovingdons staff.

85
0:04:27.44,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Using this amazing org chart, we can now explore

86
0:04:31.113,000 --> 0:04:33,000
how the human team members and the technology team members

87
0:04:33.87,000 --> 0:04:34,000
are interacting.

88
0:04:35.84,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So the first thing that I'm going to look for

89
0:04:38.04,000 --> 0:04:4,000
is where there's a human and machine relationship

90
0:04:41.032,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that's extra critical.

91
0:04:42.921,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Usually, it's somebody using a technology

92
0:04:45.339,000 --> 0:04:47,000
on a day-to-day basis to do his or her job.

93
0:04:48.564,000 --> 0:04:49,000
At Bovingdons,

94
0:04:49.773,000 --> 0:04:52,000
the finance director with the accounting platform would be one.

95
0:04:53.387,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Next, I would check on the status of their collaboration.

96
0:04:57.254,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Are they working well together?

97
0:04:58.763,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Getting along?

98
0:05:00.017,000 --> 0:05:03,000
In this case, it turned out to be a tenuous relationship.

99
0:05:03.937,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So, what to do?

100
0:05:05.696,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Well, if the accounting platform were actually a person,

101
0:05:10.396,000 --> 0:05:13,000
the finance director would feel responsible for managing it

102
0:05:13.717,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and taking care of it.

103
0:05:15.068,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Well, in the same way,

104
0:05:16.537,000 --> 0:05:19,000
my first suggestion was to think about a team-building activity,

105
0:05:19.911,000 --> 0:05:22,000
maybe getting together on a specialist course.

106
0:05:23.565,000 --> 0:05:27,000
My second suggestion was to think about scheduling regular performance reviews

107
0:05:28.354,000 --> 0:05:29,000
for the accounting platform,

108
0:05:30.141,000 --> 0:05:33,000
where the finance director would literally give feedback

109
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
to the company who sold it.

110
0:05:35.642,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Now, there will be several of these really important human and machine teams

111
0:05:40.077,000 --> 0:05:41,000
in every organization.

112
0:05:41.743,000 --> 0:05:43,000
So if you're in one, it's worth taking the time

113
0:05:44.003,000 --> 0:05:47,000
to think about ways to make those relationships truly collaborative.

114
0:05:48.927,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Next, I'll look on the chart for any human role

115
0:05:52.654,000 --> 0:05:54,000
which might be overloaded by technology,

116
0:05:55.601,000 --> 0:05:59,000
let's say, interacting with four or more types of applications.

117
0:06:00.487,000 --> 0:06:04,000
At Bovingdons, the operations director was interacting with five technologies.

118
0:06:05.403,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Now, he told me that he'd always felt overwhelmed by his job,

119
0:06:08.871,000 --> 0:06:1,000
but it wasn't until our conversation

120
0:06:11.18,000 --> 0:06:15,000
that he thought it might be because of the technologies he was overseeing.

121
0:06:15.29,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And we were talking that,

122
0:06:16.7,000 --> 0:06:2,000
if the operations director had actually had a lot of people reporting to him,

123
0:06:21.431,000 --> 0:06:23,000
he probably would have done something about it,

124
0:06:23.664,000 --> 0:06:24,000
because it was stretching him too thin,

125
0:06:25.576,000 --> 0:06:27,000
like, move some of them to report to somebody else.

126
0:06:28.07,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So in the same way, we talked about moving some of the technologies

127
0:06:31.578,000 --> 0:06:32,000
to report to someone else,

128
0:06:32.996,000 --> 0:06:34,000
like the food inventory to go to the chef.

129
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
The last thing that I'll look for is any technology

130
0:06:40.736,000 --> 0:06:44,000
that seems to be on the org chart without a real home.

131
0:06:44.836,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Sometimes they're floating around without an owner.

132
0:06:47.649,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Sometimes they're reporting to so many different areas

133
0:06:50.735,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that you can't tell who's actually using it.

134
0:06:53.648,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Now, at Bovingdons,

135
0:06:54.858,000 --> 0:06:57,000
nobody appeared to be looking after the marketing software.

136
0:06:58.746,000 --> 0:07:01,000
It was like someone had hired it and then didn't give it a desk

137
0:07:02.292,000 --> 0:07:03,000
or any instructions on what to do.

138
0:07:04.806,000 --> 0:07:06,000
So clearly, it needed a job description,

139
0:07:07.195,000 --> 0:07:08,000
maybe someone to manage it.

140
0:07:09.497,000 --> 0:07:1,000
But in other companies,

141
0:07:10.717,000 --> 0:07:14,000
you might find that a technology has been sidelined for a reason,

142
0:07:15.117,000 --> 0:07:18,000
like it's time for it to leave or be retired.

143
0:07:18.74,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Now, retiring applications is something that all companies do.

144
0:07:23.327,000 --> 0:07:27,000
But maybe taking the mindset that those applications are actually coworkers

145
0:07:28.342,000 --> 0:07:31,000
could help them to decide when and how to retire those applications

146
0:07:31.802,000 --> 0:07:34,000
in the way that would be least destructive to the rest of the team.

147
0:07:36.552,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I did this experiment with 15 different professionals,

148
0:07:40.082,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and each time it sparked an idea.

149
0:07:42.932,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Sometimes, a bit more.

150
0:07:44.996,000 --> 0:07:46,000
You remember that hotshot employee I was telling you about,

151
0:07:47.883,000 --> 0:07:48,000
that everybody was ignoring?

152
0:07:49.728,000 --> 0:07:52,000
That was a real story told to me by Christopher,

153
0:07:52.996,000 --> 0:07:56,000
a very energetic human resources manager at a big consumer goods company.

154
0:07:57.99,000 --> 0:08:,000
Technology was a new HR platform,

155
0:08:01.467,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and it had been installed for 14 months at great expense,

156
0:08:05.779,000 --> 0:08:06,000
but nobody was using it.

157
0:08:08.375,000 --> 0:08:1,000
So we were talking about how,

158
0:08:11.046,000 --> 0:08:16,000
if this had really been such a hotshot employee with amazing credentials,

159
0:08:16.264,000 --> 0:08:18,000
you would go out of your way to get to know it,

160
0:08:18.537,000 --> 0:08:2,000
maybe invite them for coffee,

161
0:08:20.671,000 --> 0:08:22,000
get to know their background.

162
0:08:23.016,000 --> 0:08:26,000
So in the spirit of experimentation,

163
0:08:26.425,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Christopher set up one-hour appointments,

164
0:08:29.289,000 --> 0:08:3,000
coffee optional,

165
0:08:30.829,000 --> 0:08:35,000
for his team members to have no agenda but to get to know their HR system.

166
0:08:37.279,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Some people, they clicked around menu item by menu item.

167
0:08:40.716,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Other people, they searched online for things that they weren't clear about.

168
0:08:44.593,000 --> 0:08:47,000
A couple of them got together, gossiped about the new software in town.

169
0:08:48.896,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And a few weeks later, Christopher called to tell me

170
0:08:51.583,000 --> 0:08:54,000
that people were using the system in new ways,

171
0:08:54.965,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and he thought it was going to save them weeks of effort in the future.

172
0:08:59.025,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And they also reported feeling less intimidated by the software.

173
0:09:03.564,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I found that pretty amazing,

174
0:09:05.232,000 --> 0:09:08,000
that taking this mindset helped Christopher's team

175
0:09:08.332,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and others that I spoke to these past few months

176
0:09:10.731,000 --> 0:09:13,000
actually feel happier about working with technology.

177
0:09:14.268,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And I later found out this is backed up by research.

178
0:09:17.406,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Studies have shown that people who work in organizations

179
0:09:20.911,000 --> 0:09:23,000
that encourage them to talk about and learn about the technologies

180
0:09:24.178,000 --> 0:09:25,000
in the workplace

181
0:09:25.357,000 --> 0:09:27,000
have 20 percent lower stress levels

182
0:09:27.573,000 --> 0:09:29,000
than those in organizations that don't.

183
0:09:30.607,000 --> 0:09:34,000
I also found it really cool that when I started to do this experiment,

184
0:09:34.752,000 --> 0:09:36,000
I started with what was happening between a person

185
0:09:37.577,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and an individual technology,

186
0:09:39.523,000 --> 0:09:42,000
but then it ultimately led to ideas about how to manage tech

187
0:09:43.109,000 --> 0:09:45,000
across entire companies.

188
0:09:45.156,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Like, when I did this for my own job and extended it,

189
0:09:48.562,000 --> 0:09:5,000
I thought about how our data analysis tools

190
0:09:51.135,000 --> 0:09:54,000
should go on the equivalent of a job rotation program,

191
0:09:54.524,000 --> 0:09:56,000
where different parts of the company could get to know it.

192
0:09:57.401,000 --> 0:10:,000
And I also thought about suggesting to our recruiting team

193
0:10:00.597,000 --> 0:10:02,000
that some of the technologies we work with every day

194
0:10:03.21,000 --> 0:10:05,000
should come with us on our big recruiting events.

195
0:10:05.788,000 --> 0:10:06,000
If you were a university student,

196
0:10:07.414,000 --> 0:10:09,000
how cool would it be to not only get to know the people

197
0:10:10.053,000 --> 0:10:11,000
you might be working with,

198
0:10:11.336,000 --> 0:10:12,000
but also the technologies?

199
0:10:13.637,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Now, all of this begs the question:

200
0:10:15.941,000 --> 0:10:16,000
What have we been missing

201
0:10:17.472,000 --> 0:10:2,000
by keeping the technologies that we work with day to day invisible,

202
0:10:21.263,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and what, beyond those billions of dollars in value,

203
0:10:24.434,000 --> 0:10:25,000
might we be leaving on the table?

204
0:10:27.189,000 --> 0:10:28,000
The good news is,

205
0:10:28.537,000 --> 0:10:3,000
you don't need to be an org chart geek like me

206
0:10:31.045,000 --> 0:10:32,000
to take this experiment forward.

207
0:10:33.267,000 --> 0:10:35,000
It will take a matter of minutes for most people

208
0:10:35.627,000 --> 0:10:37,000
to draw out a structure of who they work with,

209
0:10:37.828,000 --> 0:10:39,000
a little bit longer to add in the technologies

210
0:10:40.075,000 --> 0:10:41,000
to get a view of the entire team,

211
0:10:41.815,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and then you can have fun asking questions like,

212
0:10:44.641,000 --> 0:10:47,000
"Which are the technologies that I'll be taking out for coffee?"

213
0:10:48.067,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Now, I didn't do this experiment for kicks

214
0:10:51.319,000 --> 0:10:52,000
or for the coffee.

215
0:10:52.897,000 --> 0:10:56,000
I did it because the critical skill in the 21st-century workplace

216
0:10:57.555,000 --> 0:10:59,000
is going to be to collaborate with the technologies

217
0:11:00.195,000 --> 0:11:03,000
that are becoming such a big and costly part of our daily working lives.

218
0:11:04.137,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And from what I was seeing, we are struggling to cope with that.

219
0:11:08.276,000 --> 0:11:1,000
So it might sound counterintuitive,

220
0:11:11.022,000 --> 0:11:16,000
but by embracing the idea that these machines are actually valuable colleagues,

221
0:11:16.158,000 --> 0:11:17,000
we as people will perform better

222
0:11:18.134,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and be happier.

223
0:11:19.674,000 --> 0:11:22,000
So let's all share a bit of humanity

224
0:11:22.715,000 --> 0:11:25,000
towards the technologies and the softwares and the algorithms

225
0:11:26.267,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and the robots who we work with,

226
0:11:28.27,000 --> 0:11:3,000
because we will all be the better for it.

227
0:11:31.372,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Thank you.

228
0:11:33.077,000 --> 0:11:35,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:12,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I want to talk to you about,

3
0:00:15.561,000 --> 0:00:18,000
or share with you, a breakthrough new approach

4
0:00:19.122,000 --> 0:00:22,000
for managing items of inventory inside of a warehouse.

5
0:00:22.464,000 --> 0:00:24,000
We're talking about a pick, pack and ship setting here.

6
0:00:25.022,000 --> 0:00:27,000
So as a hint,

7
0:00:27.845,000 --> 0:00:31,000
this solution involves hundreds of mobile robots,

8
0:00:31.998,000 --> 0:00:33,000
sometimes thousands of mobile robots,

9
0:00:34.422,000 --> 0:00:36,000
moving around a warehouse. And I'll get to the solution.

10
0:00:37.02,000 --> 0:00:38,000
But for a moment, just think

11
0:00:38.24,000 --> 0:00:4,000
about the last time that you ordered something online.

12
0:00:40.766,000 --> 0:00:42,000
You were sitting on your couch

13
0:00:42.83,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and you decided that you absolutely had to have this red t-shirt.

14
0:00:46.89,000 --> 0:00:48,000
So — click! — you put it into your shopping cart.

15
0:00:49.186,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And then you decided that green pair of pants

16
0:00:51.084,000 --> 0:00:52,000
looks pretty good too — click!

17
0:00:52.982,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And maybe a blue pair of shoes — click!

18
0:00:54.882,000 --> 0:00:56,000
So at this point you've assembled your order.

19
0:00:56.932,000 --> 0:00:57,000
You didn't stop to think for a moment that

20
0:00:58.7,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that might not be a great outfit.

21
0:01:00.468,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But you hit "submit order."

22
0:01:02.238,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And two days later, this package shows up on your doorstep.

23
0:01:06.412,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And you open the box and you're like, wow, there's my goo.

24
0:01:09.366,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Did you ever stop to think about how those items of inventory

25
0:01:12.327,000 --> 0:01:16,000
actually found their way inside that box in the warehouse?

26
0:01:16.54,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So I'm here to tell you it's that guy right there.

27
0:01:20.358,000 --> 0:01:23,000
So deep in the middle of that picture,

28
0:01:23.978,000 --> 0:01:25,000
you see a classic pick-pack worker

29
0:01:26.493,000 --> 0:01:29,000
in a distribution or order fulfillments setting.

30
0:01:29.718,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Classically these pick workers will spend 60 or 70 percent of their day

31
0:01:33.6,000 --> 0:01:34,000
wandering around the warehouse.

32
0:01:35.512,000 --> 0:01:37,000
They'll often walk as much as 5 or 10 miles

33
0:01:38.223,000 --> 0:01:4,000
in pursuit of those items of inventory.

34
0:01:40.884,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Not only is this an unproductive way to fill orders,

35
0:01:45.305,000 --> 0:01:49,000
it also turns out to be an unfulfilling way to fill orders.

36
0:01:49.362,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So let me tell you where I first bumped into this problem.

37
0:01:52.993,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I was out in the Bay area in '99, 2000, the dot com boom.

38
0:01:57.047,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I worked for a fabulously spectacular flame-out called Webvan.

39
0:02:01.109,000 --> 0:02:02,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:02.93,000 --> 0:02:04,000
This company raised hundreds of millions of dollars with the notion that

41
0:02:05.66,000 --> 0:02:07,000
we will deliver grocery orders online.

42
0:02:08.442,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And it really came down to the fact that we couldn't do it cost effectively.

43
0:02:12.615,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Turns out e-commerce was something that was very hard and very costly.

44
0:02:16.577,000 --> 0:02:2,000
In this particular instance we were trying to assemble 30 items of inventory

45
0:02:20.828,000 --> 0:02:23,000
into a few totes, onto a van to deliver to the home.

46
0:02:24.8,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And when you think about it, it was costing us 30 dollars.

47
0:02:28.6,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Imagine, we had an 89¢ can of soup

48
0:02:31.686,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that was costing us one dollar to pick and pack into that tote.

49
0:02:35.362,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And that's before we actually tried to deliver it to the home.

50
0:02:38.57,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So long story short, during my one year at Webvan,

51
0:02:41.357,000 --> 0:02:44,000
what I realized by talking to all the material-handling providers

52
0:02:44.593,000 --> 0:02:48,000
was that there was no solution designed specifically to solve each base picking.

53
0:02:49.231,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Red item, green, blue, getting those three things in a box.

54
0:02:53.254,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So we said, there's just got to be a better way to do this.

55
0:02:56.239,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Existing material handling was set up to pump

56
0:02:58.766,000 --> 0:03:01,000
pallets and cases of goo to retail stores.

57
0:03:02.533,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Of course Webvan went out of business, and about a year and a half later,

58
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I was still noodling on this problem. It was still nagging at me.

59
0:03:09.91,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And I started thinking about it again.

60
0:03:11.778,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And I said, let me just focus briefly on what I wanted as a pick worker,

61
0:03:16.905,000 --> 0:03:18,000
or my vision for how it should work.

62
0:03:19.236,000 --> 0:03:2,000
(Laughter)

63
0:03:20.65,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I said, let's focus on the problem.

64
0:03:22.572,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I have an order here and what I want to do is I want to put

65
0:03:26.427,000 --> 0:03:28,000
red, green and blue in this box right here.

66
0:03:28.647,000 --> 0:03:3,000
What I need is a system where I put out my hand and — poof! —

67
0:03:31.499,000 --> 0:03:33,000
the product shows up and I pack it into the order,

68
0:03:34.022,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and now we're thinking,

69
0:03:35.715,000 --> 0:03:39,000
this would be a very operator-centric approach to solving the problem.

70
0:03:39.729,000 --> 0:03:43,000
This is what I need. What technology is available to solve this problem?

71
0:03:43.956,000 --> 0:03:46,000
But as you can see, orders can come and go, products can come and go.

72
0:03:47.897,000 --> 0:03:51,000
It allows us to focus on making the pick worker the center of the problem,

73
0:03:52.58,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and providing them the tools to make them as productive as possible.

74
0:03:57.204,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So how did I arrive at this notion?

75
0:03:59.304,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Well, actually it came from a brainstorming exercise,

76
0:04:02.837,000 --> 0:04:04,000
probably a technique that many of you use,

77
0:04:05.677,000 --> 0:04:07,000
It's this notion of testing your ideas.

78
0:04:07.833,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Take a blank sheet, of course,

79
0:04:09.563,000 --> 0:04:13,000
but then test your ideas at the limits — infinity, zero.

80
0:04:13.593,000 --> 0:04:16,000
In this particular case, we challenged ourselves with the idea:

81
0:04:16.775,000 --> 0:04:18,000
What if we had to build a distribution center in China,

82
0:04:19.751,000 --> 0:04:21,000
where it's a very, very low-cost market?

83
0:04:22.365,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And say, labor is cheap, land is cheap.

84
0:04:25.578,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And we said specifically,

85
0:04:27.224,000 --> 0:04:3,000
"What if it was zero dollars an hour for direct labor

86
0:04:30.23,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and we could build a million- square-foot distribution center?"

87
0:04:32.946,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So naturally that led to ideas that said,

88
0:04:35.021,000 --> 0:04:36,000
"Let's put lots of people in the warehouse."

89
0:04:36.829,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And I said, "Hold on, zero dollars per hour,

90
0:04:39.374,000 --> 0:04:41,000
what I would do is 'hire'

91
0:04:42.231,000 --> 0:04:46,000
10,000 workers to come to the warehouse every morning at 8 a.m.,

92
0:04:46.358,000 --> 0:04:49,000
walk into the warehouse and pick up one item of inventory

93
0:04:49.477,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and then just stand there.

94
0:04:51.21,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So you hold Captain Crunch, you hold the Mountain Dew,

95
0:04:53.749,000 --> 0:04:54,000
you hold the Diet Coke.

96
0:04:55.172,000 --> 0:04:57,000
If I need it, I'll call you, otherwise just stand there.

97
0:04:57.428,000 --> 0:05:,000
But when I need Diet Coke and I call it, you guys talk amongst yourselves.

98
0:05:00.815,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Diet Coke walks up to the front — pick it, put it in the tote, away it goes."

99
0:05:04.936,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Wow, what if the products could walk and talk on their own?

100
0:05:09.588,000 --> 0:05:11,000
That's a very interesting, very powerful way

101
0:05:11.926,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that we could potentially organize this warehouse.

102
0:05:14.52,000 --> 0:05:16,000
So of course, labor isn't free,

103
0:05:16.868,000 --> 0:05:19,000
on that practical versus awesome spectrum.

104
0:05:20.176,000 --> 0:05:21,000
(Laughter)

105
0:05:21.866,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So we said mobile shelving — We'll put them on mobile shelving.

106
0:05:24.983,000 --> 0:05:28,000
We'll use mobile robots and we'll move the inventory around.

107
0:05:29.776,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And so we got underway on that and then I'm sitting on my couch in 2008.

108
0:05:34.194,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Did any of you see the Beijing Olympics, the opening ceremonies?

109
0:05:38.013,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I about fell out of my couch when I saw this.

110
0:05:41.054,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I'm like, that was the idea!

111
0:05:42.527,000 --> 0:05:46,000
(Laughter and Applause)

112
0:05:47.026,000 --> 0:05:5,000
We'll put thousands of people on the warehouse floor, the stadium floor.

113
0:05:50.917,000 --> 0:05:54,000
But interestingly enough, this actually relates to the idea

114
0:05:54.952,000 --> 0:05:59,000
in that these guys were creating some incredibly powerful, impressive digital art,

115
0:06:00.364,000 --> 0:06:02,000
all without computers, I'm told,

116
0:06:02.44,000 --> 0:06:04,000
it was all peer-to-peer coordination and communication.

117
0:06:04.886,000 --> 0:06:05,000
You stand up, I'll squat down.

118
0:06:06.462,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And they made some fabulous art.

119
0:06:08.107,000 --> 0:06:1,000
It speaks to the power of emergence

120
0:06:10.795,000 --> 0:06:13,000
in systems when you let things start to talk with each other.

121
0:06:14.763,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So that was a little bit of the journey.

122
0:06:18.541,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So of course, now what became the practical reality of this idea?

123
0:06:22.579,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Here is a warehouse.

124
0:06:24.385,000 --> 0:06:27,000
It's a pick, pack and ship center that has about 10,000 different SKUs.

125
0:06:28.161,000 --> 0:06:32,000
We'll call them red pens, green pens, yellow Post-It Notes.

126
0:06:32.298,000 --> 0:06:35,000
We send the little orange robots out to pick up the blue shelving pods.

127
0:06:35.677,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And we deliver them to the side of the building.

128
0:06:37.845,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So all the pick workers now get to stay on the perimeter.

129
0:06:40.981,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And the game here is to pick up the shelves,

130
0:06:43.323,000 --> 0:06:46,000
take them down the highway and deliver them straight to the pick worker.

131
0:06:46.647,000 --> 0:06:48,000
This pick worker's life is completely different.

132
0:06:48.784,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Rather than wandering around the warehouse, she gets to stay still

133
0:06:52.201,000 --> 0:06:53,000
in a pick station like this

134
0:06:53.789,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and every product in the building can now come to her.

135
0:06:57.787,000 --> 0:07:,000
So the process is very productive.

136
0:07:01.065,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Reach in, pick an item, scan the bar code, pack it out.

137
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
By the time you turn around,

138
0:07:06.909,000 --> 0:07:09,000
there's another product there ready to be picked and packed.

139
0:07:09.948,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So what we've done is take out all of the non-value added

140
0:07:12.958,000 --> 0:07:14,000
walking, searching, wasting, waited time,

141
0:07:15.642,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and we've developed a very high-fidelity way to pick these orders,

142
0:07:19.92,000 --> 0:07:23,000
where you point at it with a laser, scan the UPC barcode,

143
0:07:24.084,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and then indicate with a light which box it needs to go into.

144
0:07:27.278,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So more productive, more accurate and, it turns out,

145
0:07:30.764,000 --> 0:07:34,000
it's a more interesting office environment for these pick workers.

146
0:07:35.07,000 --> 0:07:37,000
They actually complete the whole order.

147
0:07:37.507,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So they do red, green and blue, not just a part of the order.

148
0:07:40.034,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And they feel a little bit more in control of their environment.

149
0:07:43.648,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So the side effects of this approach

150
0:07:46.846,000 --> 0:07:47,000
are what really surprised us.

151
0:07:48.414,000 --> 0:07:49,000
We knew it was going to be more productive.

152
0:07:49.992,000 --> 0:07:53,000
But we didn't realize just how pervasive this way of thinking

153
0:07:54.062,000 --> 0:07:59,000
extended to other functions in the warehouse.

154
0:07:59.292,000 --> 0:08:03,000
But what effectively this approach is doing inside of the DC

155
0:08:04.124,000 --> 0:08:08,000
is turning it into a massively parallel processing engine.

156
0:08:08.588,000 --> 0:08:1,000
So this is again a cross-fertilization of ideas.

157
0:08:11.211,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Here's a warehouse and we're thinking about

158
0:08:13.15,000 --> 0:08:16,000
parallel processing supercomputer architectures.

159
0:08:16.669,000 --> 0:08:18,000
The notion here is that you have

160
0:08:19.066,000 --> 0:08:21,000
10 workers on the right side of the screen

161
0:08:21.863,000 --> 0:08:25,000
that are now all independent autonomous pick workers.

162
0:08:26.111,000 --> 0:08:29,000
If the worker in station three decides to leave and go to the bathroom,

163
0:08:30.015,000 --> 0:08:33,000
it has no impact on the productivity of the other nine workers.

164
0:08:33.499,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Contrast that, for a moment, with the traditional method of using a conveyor.

165
0:08:37.869,000 --> 0:08:39,000
When one person passes the order to you,

166
0:08:39.928,000 --> 0:08:41,000
you put something in and pass it downstream.

167
0:08:42.427,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Everyone has to be in place for that serial process to work.

168
0:08:45.544,000 --> 0:08:48,000
This becomes a more robust way to think about the warehouse.

169
0:08:48.721,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And then underneath the hoods gets interesting in that we're tracking

170
0:08:53.265,000 --> 0:08:54,000
the popularity of the products.

171
0:08:55.003,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And we're using dynamic and adaptive algorithms

172
0:08:57.827,000 --> 0:09:01,000
to tune the floor of the warehouse.

173
0:09:02.281,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So what you see here potentially the week leading up to Valentine's Day.

174
0:09:07.165,000 --> 0:09:1,000
All that pink chalky candy has moved to the front of the building

175
0:09:11.008,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and is now being picked into a lot of orders in those pick stations.

176
0:09:14.901,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Come in two days after Valentine's Day, and that candy, the leftover candy,

177
0:09:19.064,000 --> 0:09:21,000
has all drifted to the back of the warehouse

178
0:09:21.337,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and is occupying the cooler zone on the thermal map there.

179
0:09:25.63,000 --> 0:09:28,000
One other side effect of this approach using the parallel processing

180
0:09:29.113,000 --> 0:09:31,000
is these things can scale to ginormous.

181
0:09:32.108,000 --> 0:09:33,000
(Laughter)

182
0:09:33.635,000 --> 0:09:35,000
So whether you're doing two pick stations, 20 pick stations,

183
0:09:36.369,000 --> 0:09:39,000
or 200 pick stations, the path planning algorithms

184
0:09:39.642,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and all of the inventory algorithms just work.

185
0:09:42.185,000 --> 0:09:46,000
In this example you see that the inventory

186
0:09:46.541,000 --> 0:09:48,000
has now occupied all the perimeter of the building

187
0:09:48.867,000 --> 0:09:5,000
because that's where the pick stations were.

188
0:09:51.213,000 --> 0:09:53,000
They sorted it out for themselves.

189
0:09:53.231,000 --> 0:09:55,000
So I'll conclude with just one final video

190
0:09:55.518,000 --> 0:09:57,000
that shows how this comes to bear

191
0:09:58.502,000 --> 0:10:01,000
on the pick worker's actual day in the life of.

192
0:10:02.096,000 --> 0:10:06,000
So as we mentioned, the process is to move inventory along the highway

193
0:10:06.432,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and then find your way into these pick stations.

194
0:10:09.084,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And our software in the background

195
0:10:11.555,000 --> 0:10:13,000
understands what's going on in each station,

196
0:10:14.306,000 --> 0:10:16,000
we direct the pods across the highway

197
0:10:16.917,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and we're attempting to get into a queuing system

198
0:10:19.631,000 --> 0:10:21,000
to present the work to the pick worker.

199
0:10:22.515,000 --> 0:10:25,000
What's interesting is we can even adapt the speed of the pick workers.

200
0:10:25.76,000 --> 0:10:28,000
The faster pickers get more pods and the slower pickers get few.

201
0:10:29.686,000 --> 0:10:32,000
But this pick worker now is literally having that experience

202
0:10:32.824,000 --> 0:10:33,000
that we described before.

203
0:10:34.677,000 --> 0:10:36,000
She puts out her hand. The product jumps into it.

204
0:10:37.221,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Or she has to reach in and get it.

205
0:10:39.426,000 --> 0:10:41,000
She scans it and she puts it in the bucket.

206
0:10:41.871,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And all of the rest of the technology is kind of behind the scenes.

207
0:10:45.667,000 --> 0:10:48,000
So she gets to now focus on the picking and packing portion of her job.

208
0:10:49.528,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Never has any idle time, never has to leave her mat.

209
0:10:52.802,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And actually we think not only a more productive

210
0:10:56.942,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and more accurate way to fill orders.

211
0:11:00.212,000 --> 0:11:03,000
We think it's a more fulfilling way to fill orders.

212
0:11:03.622,000 --> 0:11:06,000
The reason we can say that, though, is that workers

213
0:11:06.83,000 --> 0:11:08,000
in a lot of these buildings now compete

214
0:11:08.972,000 --> 0:11:11,000
for the privilege of working in the Kiva zone that day.

215
0:11:12.154,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And sometimes we'll catch them on testimonial videos

216
0:11:14.817,000 --> 0:11:16,000
saying such things as,

217
0:11:16.934,000 --> 0:11:2,000
they have more energy after the day to play with their grandchildren,

218
0:11:21.18,000 --> 0:11:25,000
or in one case a guy said, "the Kiva zone is so stress-free

219
0:11:25.776,000 --> 0:11:28,000
that I've actually stopped taking my blood pressure medication."

220
0:11:28.891,000 --> 0:11:29,000
(Laughter)

221
0:11:30.725,000 --> 0:11:33,000
That was at a pharmaceutical distributor, so they told us not to use that video.

222
0:11:34.724,000 --> 0:11:37,000
(Laughter)

223
0:11:38.292,000 --> 0:11:41,000
So what I wanted to leave you with today is the notion that

224
0:11:41.316,000 --> 0:11:43,000
when you let things start to think and walk

225
0:11:44.171,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and talk on their own, interesting processes and productivities can emerge.

226
0:11:49.462,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And now I think next time you go to your front step

227
0:11:52.403,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and pick up that box that you just ordered online,

228
0:11:54.914,000 --> 0:11:56,000
you break it open and the goo is in there,

229
0:11:57.138,000 --> 0:11:59,000
you'll have some wonderment as to whether a robot

230
0:11:59.891,000 --> 0:12:01,000
assisted in the picking and packing of that order.

231
0:12:02.484,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Thank you.

232
0:12:04.163,000 --> 0:12:08,000
(Applause)

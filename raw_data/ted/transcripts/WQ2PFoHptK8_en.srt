1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
When my brother called me in December of 1998,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
he said, "The news does not look good."

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
This is him on the screen.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
He'd just been diagnosed with ALS,

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
which is a disease that the average lifespan is three years.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
It paralyzes you. It starts by killing

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
the motor neurons in your spinal cord.

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And you go from being a healthy,

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
robust 29-year-old male

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to someone that cannot breathe,

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
cannot move, cannot speak.

12
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
This has actually been, to me, a gift,

13
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
because we began a journey

14
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
to learn a new way of thinking about life.

15
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
And even though Steven passed away three years ago

16
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
we had an amazing journey as a family.

17
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
We did not even --

18
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I think adversity is not even the right word.

19
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
We looked at this and we said, "We're going to do something with this

20
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
in an incredibly positive way."

21
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And I want to talk today

22
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
about one of the things that we decided to do,

23
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
which was to think about a new way of approaching healthcare.

24
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Because, as we all know here today,

25
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
it doesn't work very well.

26
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I want to talk about it in the context of a story.

27
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
This is the story of my brother.

28
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
But it's just a story. And I want to go beyond the story,

29
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and go to something more.

30
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
"Given my status, what is the best outcome

31
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I can hope to achieve, and how do I get there?"

32
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
is what we are here to do in medicine, is what everyone should do.

33
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And those questions all have variables to them.

34
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
All of our statuses are different.

35
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
All of our hopes and dreams, what we want to accomplish,

36
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
is different, and our paths will be different,

37
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
they are all stories.

38
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
But it's a story until we convert it to data

39
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and so what we do, this concept we had,

40
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
was to take Steven's status, "What is my status?"

41
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and go from this concept of walking, breathing,

42
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and then his hands, speak,

43
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and ultimately happiness and function.

44
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So, the first set of pathologies, they end up in the stick man

45
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
on his icon,

46
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
but the rest of them are really what's important here.

47
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Because Steven, despite the fact that he was paralyzed,

48
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
as he was in that pool, he could not walk,

49
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
he could not use his arms -- that's why he had the little floaty things on them,

50
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
did you see those? --

51
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
he was happy. We were at the beach,

52
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
he was raising his son, and he was productive.

53
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And we took this, and we converted it into data.

54
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
But it's not a data point at that one moment in time.

55
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
It is a data point of Steven in a context.

56
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Here he is in the pool. But here he is healthy,

57
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
as a builder: taller, stronger,

58
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
got all the women, amazing guy.

59
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Here he is walking down the aisle,

60
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
but he can barely walk now, so it's impaired.

61
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And he could still hold his wife's hand, but he couldn't do buttons on his clothes,

62
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
can't feed himself.

63
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And here he is, paralyzed completely,

64
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
unable to breathe and move, over this time journey.

65
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
These stories of his life, converted to data.

66
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
He renovated my carriage house

67
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
when he was completely paralyzed, and unable to speak,

68
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and unable to breathe, and he won an award for a historic restoration.

69
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So, here's Steven alone, sharing this story in the world.

70
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And this is the insight, the thing that we are

71
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
excited about,

72
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
because we have gone away from the community that we are,

73
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
the fact that we really do love each other and want to care for each other.

74
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
We need to give to others to be successful.

75
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So, Steven is sharing this story,

76
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
but he is not alone.

77
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
There are so many other people sharing their stories.

78
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Not stories in words, but stories in data and words.

79
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And we convert that information into this structure,

80
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
this understanding, this ability to convert

81
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
those stories into something that is computable,

82
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
to which we can begin to change the way

83
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
medicine is done and delivered.

84
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
We did this for ALS. We can do this for depression,

85
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Parkinson's disease, HIV.

86
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
These are not simple, they are not internet scalable;

87
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
they require thought and processes

88
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
to find the meaningful information about the disease.

89
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So, this is what it looks like when you go to the website.

90
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And I'm going to show you what Patients Like Me,

91
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
the company that myself, my youngest brother

92
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and a good friend from MIT started.

93
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Here are the actual patients, there are 45,000 of them now,

94
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
sharing their stories as data.

95
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Here is an M.S. patient.

96
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
His name is Mike, and he is uniformly impaired

97
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
on cognition, vision, walking, sensation.

98
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Those are things that are different for each M.S. patient.

99
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Each of them can have a different characteristic.

100
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
You can see fibromyalgia, HIV, ALS, depression.

101
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Look at this HIV patient down here, Zinny.

102
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
It's two years of this disease. All of the symptoms are not there.

103
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
But he is working to keep his CD4 count high

104
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and his viral level low so he can make his life better.

105
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
But you can aggregate this and you can discover things about treatments.

106
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Look at this, 2,000 people almost, on Copaxone.

107
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
These are patients currently on drugs,

108
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
sharing data.

109
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I love some of these, physical exercise, prayer.

110
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Anyone want to run a comparative effectiveness study

111
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
on prayer against something? Let's look at prayer.

112
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
What I love about this, just sort of interesting design problems.

113
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
These are why people pray.

114
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Here is the schedule of how frequently they -- it's a dose.

115
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So, anyone want to see the 32 patients that pray for 60 minutes a day,

116
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and see if they're doing better, they probably are.

117
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Here they are. It's an open network,

118
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
everybody is sharing. We can see it all.

119
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Or, I want to look at anxiety, because people are praying for anxiety.

120
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And here is data on 15,000 people's current anxiety, right now.

121
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
How they treat it,

122
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
the drugs, the components of it,

123
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
their side effects, all of it in a rich environment,

124
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and you can drill down and see the individuals.

125
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
This amazing data allows us to drill down and see

126
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
what this drug is for --

127
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
1,500 people on this drug, I think. Yes.

128
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I want to talk to the 58 patients down here

129
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
who are taking four milligrams a day.

130
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And I want to talk to the ones of those that have been doing

131
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
it for more than two years.

132
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So, you can see the duration.

133
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
All open, all available.

134
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I'm going to log in.

135
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And this is my brother's profile.

136
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And this is a new version of our platform we're launching right now.

137
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
This is the second generation. It's going to be in Flash.

138
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And you can see here, as this animates over,

139
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Steven's actual data against the background of all other patients,

140
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
against this information.

141
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
The blue band is the 50th percentile. Steven is the 75th percentile,

142
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that he has non-genetic ALS.

143
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
You scroll down in this profile and you can see

144
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
all of his prescription drugs,

145
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
but more than that, in the new version, I can look at this interactively.

146
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Wait, poor spinal capacity.

147
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Doesn't this remind you of a great stock program?

148
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Wouldn't it be great if the technology we used to take care of ourselves

149
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
was as good as the technology we use to make money?

150
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Detrol. In the side effects for his drug,

151
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
integrated into that, the stem cell transplant that he had,

152
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
the first in the world, shared openly for anyone who wants to see it.

153
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I love here -- the cyberkinetics implant,

154
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
which was, again, the only patient's data that was online and available.

155
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
You can adjust the time scale. You can adjust the symptoms.

156
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
You can look at the interaction between how I treat my ALS.

157
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So, you click down on the ALS tab there.

158
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I'm taking three drugs to manage it. Some of them are experimental.

159
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I can look at my constipation, how to manage it.

160
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I can see magnesium citrate, and the side effects

161
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
from that drug all integrated in the time

162
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
in which they're meaningful.

163
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
But I want more.

164
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I don't want to just look at this cool device, I want to take this

165
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
data and make something even better.

166
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
I want my brother's center of the universe and his symptoms

167
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and his drugs,

168
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and all of the things that interact among those,

169
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
the side effects, to be in this beautiful data galaxy

170
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that we can look at in any way we want to understand it,

171
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
so that we can take this information

172
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and go beyond just this simple model

173
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
of what a record is.

174
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I don't even know what a medical record is.

175
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I want to solve a problem. I want an application.

176
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So, can I take this data -- rearrange yourself,

177
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
put the symptoms in the left, the drugs across the top,

178
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
tell me everything we know about Steven and everyone else,

179
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and what interacts.

180
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Years after he's had these drugs,

181
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I learned that everything he did to manage his excess saliva,

182
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
including some positive side effects that came from other drugs,

183
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
were making his constipation worse.

184
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And if anyone's ever had severe constipation,

185
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and you don't understand how much of an impact that has on your life --

186
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
yes, that was a pun.

187
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
You're trying to manage these,

188
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and this grid is available here,

189
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and we want to understand it.

190
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
No one's ever had this kind of information.

191
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So, patients have this. We're for patients.

192
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
This is all about patient health care, there was no doctors on our network.

193
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
This is about the patients.

194
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
So, how can we take this and bring them a tool

195
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
that they can go back and they can engage the medical system?

196
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And we worked hard, and we thought about it and we said,

197
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
"What's something we can use all the time,

198
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
that we can use in the medical care system,

199
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that everyone will understand?"

200
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So, the patients print it out,

201
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
because hospitals usually block us

202
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
because they believe we are a social network.

203
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
It's actually the most used feature on the website.

204
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Doctors actually love this sheet, and they're actually really engaged.

205
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
So, we went from this story of Steven

206
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and his history to data, and then back to paper,

207
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
where we went back and engaged the medical care system.

208
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And here's another paper.

209
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
This is a journal, PNAS --

210
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I think it's the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science

211
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
of the United States of America.

212
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
You've seen multiple of these today, when everyone's bragging about

213
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
the amazing things they've done.

214
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
This is a report about a drug called lithium.

215
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Lithium, that is a drug used to treat bipolar disorder,

216
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
that a group in Italy found

217
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
slowed ALS down in 16 patients, and published it.

218
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Now, we'll skip the critiques of the paper.

219
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
But the short story is: If you're a patient,

220
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
you want to be on the blue line.

221
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
You don't want to be on the red line, you want to be on the blue line.

222
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Because the blue line is a better line. The red line

223
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
is way downhill, the blue line is a good line.

224
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
So, you know we said -- we looked at this, and what I love also

225
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
is that people always accuse these Internet sites

226
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
of promoting bad medicine and having people do things irresponsibly.

227
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
So, this is what happened when PNAS published this.

228
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Ten percent of the people in our system took lithium.

229
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Ten percent of the patients started taking lithium based on 16 patients of data

230
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
in a bad publication.

231
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And they call the Internet irresponsible.

232
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Here's the implication of what happens.

233
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
There's this one guy, named Humberto, from Brazil,

234
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
who unfortunately passed away nine months ago,

235
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
who said, "Hey, listen. Can you help us answer this question?

236
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Because I don't want to wait for the next trial, it's going to be years.

237
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
I want to know now. Can you help us?"

238
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
So, we launched some tools, we let them track their blood levels.

239
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
We let them share the data and exchange it.

240
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
You know, a data network.

241
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And they said, you know, "Jamie, PLM,

242
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
can you guys tell us whether this works or not?"

243
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And we went around and we talked to people,

244
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and they said, "You can't run a clinical trial like this. You know?

245
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
You don't have the blinding, you don't have data,

246
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
it doesn't follow the scientific method.

247
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
It's never going to work. You can't do it."

248
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
So, I said, "Okay well we can't do that. Then we can do something harder."

249
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
(Laughter)

250
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
I can't say whether lithium works in all ALS patients,

251
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
but I can say whether it works in Humberto.

252
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
I bought a Mac about two years ago, I converted over,

253
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and I was so excited about this new feature of the time machine

254
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
that came in Leopard. And we said -- because it's really cool,

255
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
you can go back and you can look at the entire history of your computer,

256
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and find everything you've lost, and I loved it.

257
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And I said, "What if we built a time machine for patients,

258
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
except instead of going backwards, we go forwards.

259
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Can we find out what's going to happen to you,

260
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
so that you can maybe change it?"

261
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
So, we did. We took all the patients like Humberto,

262
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
That's the Apple background, we stole that because we didn't have time

263
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
to build our own. This is a real app by the way.

264
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
This is not just graphics.

265
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And you take those data, and we find the patients like him, and we bring

266
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
their data together. And we bring their histories into it.

267
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And then we say, "Well how do we line them all up?"

268
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
So, we line them all up so they go together

269
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
around the meaningful points,

270
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
integrated across everything we know about the patient.

271
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Full information, the entire course of their disease.

272
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And that's what is going to happen to Humberto,

273
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
unless he does something.

274
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And he took lithium, and he went down the line.

275
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
And it works almost every time.

276
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Now, the ones that it doesn't work are interesting.

277
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
But almost all the time it works.

278
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
It's actually scary. It's beautiful.

279
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
So, we couldn't run a clinical trial, we couldn't figure it out.

280
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
But we could see whether it was going to work for Humberto.

281
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And yeah, all the clinicians in the audience will talk about power

282
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and all the standard deviation. We'll do that later.

283
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
But here is the answer

284
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
of the mean of the patients that actually decided

285
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
to take lithium.

286
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
These are all the patients that started lithium.

287
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
It's the Intent to Treat Curve.

288
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
You can see here, the blue dots on the top, the light ones,

289
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
those are the people in the study in PNAS

290
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
that you wanted to be on. And the red ones are the ones,

291
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
the pink ones on the bottom are the ones you didn't want to be.

292
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And the ones in the middle are all of our patients

293
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
from the start of lithium at time zero,

294
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
going forward, and then going backward.

295
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
So, you can see we matched them perfectly, perfectly.

296
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Terrifyingly accurate matching.

297
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And going forward, you actually don't want to be a lithium patient this time.

298
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
You're actually doing slightly worse -- not significantly,

299
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
but slightly worse. You don't want to be a lithium patient this time.

300
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
But you know, a lot of people dropped out,

301
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
the trial, there is too much drop out.

302
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Can we do the even harder thing? Can we go to the patients

303
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
that actually decided to stay on lithium,

304
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
because they were so convinced they were getting better?

305
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
We asked our control algorithm,

306
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
are those 69 patients -- by the way, you'll notice

307
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
that's four times the number of patients in the clinical trial --

308
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
can we look at those patients and say,

309
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
"Can we match them with our time machine

310
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
to the other patients that are just like them,

311
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and what happens?"

312
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Even the ones that believed they were getting better

313
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
matched the controls exactly. Exactly.

314
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Those little lines? That's the power.

315
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
So, we -- I can't tell you lithium doesn't work. I can't tell you

316
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
that if you did it at a higher dose

317
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
or if you run the study proper -- I can tell you

318
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
that for those 69 people that took lithium,

319
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
they didn't do any better than the people that were just like them,

320
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
just like me,

321
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and that we had the power to detect that at about

322
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
a quarter of the strengths reported in the initial study.

323
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
We did that one year ahead of the time

324
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
when the first clinical trial funded by the NIH

325
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
for millions of dollars failed for futility last week,

326
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and announced it.

327
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
So, remember I told you about my brother's stem cell transplant.

328
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
I never really knew whether it worked.

329
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And I put 100 million cells in his cisterna magna,

330
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
in his lumbar cord,

331
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and filled out the IRBs and did all this work,

332
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and I never really knew.

333
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
How did I not know?

334
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
I mean, I didn't know what was going to happen to him.

335
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
I actually asked Tim, who is the quant in our group --

336
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
we actually searched for about a year to find someone

337
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
who could do the sort of math and statistics and modeling

338
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
in healthcare, couldn't find anybody. So, we went to the finance industry.

339
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And there are these guys who used to model the future

340
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
of interest rates, and all that kind of stuff.

341
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
And some of them were available. So, we hired one.

342
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
(Laughter)

343
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
We hired them, set them up, assisting at lab.

344
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
I I.M. him things. That's the way I communicate with him,

345
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
is like a little guy in a box. I I.M.ed Tim. I said,

346
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
"Tim can you tell me whether my brother's stem cell transplant

347
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
worked or not?"

348
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And he sent me this two days ago.

349
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
It was that little outliers there. You see that guy that lived a long time?

350
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
We have to go talk to him. Because I'd like to know what happened.

351
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Because something went different.

352
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
But my brother didn't. My brother went straight down the line.

353
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
It only works about 12 months.

354
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
It's the first version of the time machine.

355
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
First time we ever tried it. We'll try to get it better later

356
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
but 12 months so far.

357
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
And, you know, I look at this,

358
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and I get really emotional.

359
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
You look at the patients, you can drill in all the controls,

360
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
you can look at them, you can ask them.

361
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
And I found a woman that had --

362
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
we found her, she was odd because she had data

363
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
after she died.

364
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
And her husband had come in and entered her last functional scores,

365
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
because he knew how much she cared.

366
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
And I am thankful.

367
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
I can't believe that these people,

368
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
years after my brother had died,

369
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
helped me answer the question about whether

370
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
an operation I did, and spent millions of dollars on

371
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
years ago, worked or not.

372
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
I wished it had been there

373
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
when I'd done it the first time,

374
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and I'm really excited that it's here now,

375
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
because the lab that I founded

376
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
has some data on a drug that might work,

377
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and I'd like to show it.

378
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
I'd like to show it in real time, now,

379
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
and I want to do that for all of the diseases that we can do that for.

380
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
I've got to thank the 45,000 people

381
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
that are doing this social experiment with us.

382
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
There is an amazing journey we are going on

383
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
to become human again,

384
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
to be part of community again,

385
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
to share of ourselves, to be vulnerable,

386
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
and it's very exciting. So, thank you.

387
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
The career that I started early on in my life

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
was looking for exotic life forms in exotic places,

3
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and at that time I was working in the Antarctic and the Arctic,

4
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and high deserts and low deserts.

5
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Until about a dozen years ago, when I was really captured by caves,

6
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and I really re-focused most of my research in that direction.

7
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
So I have a really cool day job-- I get to do some really amazing stuff.

8
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I work in some of the most extreme cave environments on the planet.

9
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Many of them are trying to kill us from the minute we go into them,

10
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
but nevertheless, they're absolutely gripping,

11
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and contain unbelievable biological wonders

12
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that are very, very different from those that we have on the planet.

13
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Apart from the intrinsic value

14
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
of the biology and mineralogy and geo-microbiology that we do there,

15
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
we're also using these as templates

16
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
for figuring out how to go look

17
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
for life on other planets.

18
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Particularly Mars, but also Europa,

19
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
the small, icy moon around Jupiter.

20
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And perhaps, someday, far beyond our solar system itself.

21
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I'm very passionately interested in the human future,

22
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
on the Moon and Mars particularly,

23
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and elsewhere in the solar system.

24
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I think it's time that we transitioned

25
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
to a solar system-going civilization and species.

26
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And, as an outgrowth of all of this then,

27
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I wonder about whether we can, and whether we even should,

28
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
think about transporting Earth-type life to other planets.

29
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Notably Mars, as a first example.

30
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Something I never talk about in scientific meetings

31
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
is how I actually got to this state

32
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and why I do the work that I do.

33
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Why don't I have a normal job, a sensible job?

34
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And then of course, I blame the Soviet Union.

35
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Because in the mid-1950s,

36
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
when I was a tiny child,

37
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
they had the audacity to launch

38
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
a very primitive little satellite called Sputnik,

39
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
which sent the Western world into a hysterical tailspin.

40
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And a tremendous amount of money

41
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
went into the funding of science

42
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and mathematics skills for kids.

43
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And I'm a product of that generation,

44
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
like so many other of my peers.

45
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It really caught hold of us, and caught fire,

46
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and it would be lovely if we could reproduce that again now.

47
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Of course, refusing to grow up --

48
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
-- even though I impersonate a grown-up in daily life,

49
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
but I do a fairly good job of that --

50
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
but really retaining that childlike quality

51
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
of not caring what other people think

52
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
about what you're interested in, is really critical.

53
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
The next element is the fact that

54
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I have applied a value judgment

55
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and my value judgment is that the presence of life

56
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
is better than no life.

57
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And so, life is more valuable than no life.

58
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And so I think that that holds together

59
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
a great deal of the work

60
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
that people in this audience approach.

61
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I'm very interested in Mars, of course,

62
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and that was a product of my being a young undergraduate

63
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
when the Viking Landers landed on Mars.

64
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And that took what had been

65
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
a tiny little astronomical object in the sky,

66
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that you would see as a dot,

67
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and turned it completely into a landscape,

68
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
as that very first primitive picture

69
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
came rastering across the screen.

70
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And when it became a landscape,

71
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
it also became a destination,

72
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and altered, really, the course of my life.

73
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
In my graduate years I worked with

74
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
my colleague and mentor and friend, Steve Schneider,

75
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
at the National Center for Atmospheric Research,

76
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
working on global change issues.

77
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
We've written a number of things on

78
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
the role of Gaia hypothesis --

79
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
whether or not you could consider Earth as a single entity

80
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
in any meaningful scientific sense,

81
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and then, as an outgrowth of that,

82
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I worked on the environmental consequences of nuclear war.

83
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
So, wonderful things and grim things.

84
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
But what it taught me was to look at Earth as a planet

85
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
with external eyes, not just as our home.

86
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And that is a wonderful stepping away in perspective,

87
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
to try to then think about the way

88
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
our planet behaves, as a planet,

89
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and with the life that's on it.

90
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And all of this seems to me to be

91
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
a salient point in history.

92
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
We're getting ready to begin to go

93
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
through the process of leaving our planet of origin

94
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and out into the wider solar system and beyond.

95
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So, back to Mars.

96
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
How hard is it going to be to find life on Mars?

97
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Well, sometimes it's really very hard for us to find each other,

98
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
even on this planet.

99
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So, finding life on another planet

100
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
is a non-trivial occupation

101
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and we spend a lot of time trying to think about that.

102
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Whether or not you think it's likely to be successful

103
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
sort of depends on what you think about

104
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
the chances of life in the universe.

105
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I think, myself,

106
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that life is a natural outgrowth

107
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
of the increasing complexification of matter over time.

108
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So, you start with the Big Bang and you get hydrogen,

109
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and then you get helium, and then you get more complicated stuff,

110
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and you get planets forming --

111
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and life is a common, planetary-based phenomenon, in my view.

112
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
Certainly, in the last 15 years,

113
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
we've seen increasing numbers of planets

114
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
outside of our solar system being confirmed,

115
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and just last month, a couple of weeks ago,

116
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
a planet in the size-class of Earth

117
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
has actually been found.

118
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And so this is very exciting news.

119
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
So, my first bold prediction is that,

120
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
is that in the universe, life is going to be everywhere.

121
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
It's going to be everywhere we look --

122
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
where there are planetary systems that can possibly support it.

123
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And those planetary systems are going to be very common.

124
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So, what about life on Mars?

125
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Well, if somebody had asked me about a dozen years ago

126
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
what I thought the chances of life on Mars would be,

127
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I would've probably said, a couple of percent.

128
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And even that was considered outrageous at the time.

129
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
I was once sneeringly introduced

130
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
by a former NASA official,

131
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
as the only person on the planet

132
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
who still thought there was life on Mars.

133
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Of course, that official is now dead, and I'm not,

134
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
so there's a certain amount of glory

135
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
in outliving your adversaries.

136
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
But things have changed greatly

137
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
over the last dozen years.

138
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And the reason that they have changed

139
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
is because we now have new information.

140
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
The amazing Pathfinder mission that went in '97,

141
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and the MER Rover missions

142
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
that are on Mars as we speak now

143
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and the European Space Agency's Mars Express,

144
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
has taught us a number of amazing things.

145
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
There is sub-surface ice on that planet.

146
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And so where there is water,

147
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
there is a very high chance of our kind of life.

148
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
There's clearly sedimentary rocks all over the place –

149
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
one of the landers is sitting in the middle of an ancient seabed,

150
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and there are these amazing structures called blueberries,

151
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
which are these little, rocky concretions

152
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that we are busy making biologically

153
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
in my lab right now.

154
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So, with all of these things put together,

155
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I think that the chances of life

156
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
are much greater than I would've ever thought.

157
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I think that the chance of life having arisen on Mars, sometime in its past,

158
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
is maybe one in four to maybe even half and half.

159
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So this is a very bold statement.

160
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
I think it's there, and I think we need

161
0:06:56.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
to go look for it, and I think it's underground.

162
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So the game's afoot, and this is the game that we play in astro-biology.

163
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:05,000
How do you try to get a handle on extraterrestrial life?

164
0:07:05.33,000 --> 0:07:07,000
How do you plan to look for it?

165
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
How do you know it when you find it?

166
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Because if it's big and obvious, we would've already found it --

167
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
it would've already bitten us on the foot, and it hasn't.

168
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So, we know that it's probably quite cryptic.

169
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Very critically, how do we protect it,

170
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
if we find it, and not contaminate it?

171
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And also, even perhaps more critically, because

172
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
this is the only home planet we have,

173
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
how do we protect us from it, while we study it?

174
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So why might it be hard to find?

175
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Well, it's probably microscopic, and it's never easy

176
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
to study microscopic things,

177
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
although the amazing tools that we now have to do that

178
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
allow us to study things in much greater depth,

179
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
at much smaller scales than ever before.

180
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
But it's probably hiding, because if you are out

181
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
sequestering resources from your environment, that makes you yummy,

182
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and other things might want to eat you, or consume you.

183
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And so, there's a game of predator-prey

184
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
that's going to be, essentially, universal, really,

185
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
in any kind of biological system.

186
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
It also may be very, very different in its fundamental properties –

187
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
its chemistry, or its size.

188
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
We say small, but what does that mean?

189
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Is it virus-sized? Is it smaller than that?

190
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Is it bigger than the biggest bacterium? We don't know.

191
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And speed of activity, which is something that we face

192
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
in our work with sub-surface organisms,

193
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
because they grow very, very slowly.

194
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
If I were to take a swab off your teeth

195
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and plate it on a Petri plate,

196
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:28,000
within about four or five hours, I would have to see growth.

197
0:08:28.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
But the organisms that we work with,

198
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
from the sub-surface of Earth,

199
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
very often it's months -- and in many cases, years --

200
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
before we see any growth whatsoever.

201
0:08:36.33,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So they are, intrinsically, a slower life-form.

202
0:08:39.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
But the real issue is that we are guided by

203
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
our limited experience,

204
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and until we can think out of the box of our cranium and what we know,

205
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
then we can't recognize what to look for,

206
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
or how to plan for it.

207
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
So, perspective is everything

208
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and, because of the history that I've just briefly talked to you about,

209
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
I have learned to think about Earth

210
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
as an extraterrestrial planet.

211
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And this has been invaluable in our approach to try to study these things.

212
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
This is my favorite game on airplanes:

213
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
where you're in an airplane and you look out the window,

214
0:09:10.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
you see the horizon.

215
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
I always turn my head on the side,

216
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and that simple change makes me go from

217
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
seeing this planet as home,

218
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
to seeing it as a planet.

219
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
It's a very simple trick, and I never fail to do it

220
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
when I'm sitting in a window seat.

221
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Well, this is what we apply to our work.

222
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
This shows one of the most extreme caves that we work in.

223
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
This is Cueva de Villa Luz in Tabasco, in Mexico,

224
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and this cave is saturated with sulfuric acid.

225
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
There is tremendous amounts of hydrogen sulfide

226
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
coming into this cave from volcanic sources

227
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and from the breakdown of evaporite --

228
0:09:43.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
minerals below the carbonates in which this cave is formed --

229
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and it is a completely hostile environment for us.

230
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
We have to go in with protective suits and breathing gear,

231
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and 30 parts per million of H2S will kill you.

232
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
This is regularly several hundred parts per million.

233
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
So, it's a very hazardous environment,

234
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
with CO as well, and many other gases.

235
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
These extreme physical and chemical parameters

236
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
make the biology that grows in these places very special.

237
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Because contrary to what you might think, this is not devoid of life.

238
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
This is one of the richest caves

239
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that we have found on the planet, anywhere.

240
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
It's bursting with life.

241
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
The extremes on Earth are interesting in their own right,

242
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
but one of the reasons that we're interested in them

243
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
is because they represent, really,

244
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
the average conditions that we may expect on other planets.

245
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
So, this is part of the ability that we have,

246
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
to try to stretch our imagination,

247
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
in terms of what we may find in the future.

248
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
There's so much life in this cave,

249
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and I can't even begin

250
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:42,000
to scratch the surface of it with you.

251
0:10:42.33,000 --> 0:10:44,000
But one of the most famous objects out of this

252
0:10:44.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
are what we call Snottites, for obvious reasons.

253
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
This stuff looks like what comes out of your two-year-old's nose when he has a cold.

254
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And this is produced by bacteria who are actually

255
0:10:54.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
making more sulfuric acid,

256
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and living at pHs right around zero.

257
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And so, this stuff is like battery acid.

258
0:11:01.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And yet, everything in this cave has adapted to it.

259
0:11:04.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
In fact, there's so much energy available

260
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
for biology in this cave,

261
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
that there's actually a huge number of cavefish.

262
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And the local Zoque Indians

263
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
harvest this twice a year,

264
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
as part of their Easter week celebration and Holy Week celebration.

265
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
This is very unusual for caves.

266
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
In some of the other amazing caves that we work in --

267
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
this is in Lechuguilla cave in New Mexico near Carlsbad,

268
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and this is one of the most famous caves in the world.

269
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:3,000
It's 115 miles of mapped passage,

270
0:11:30.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
it's pristine, it has no natural opening

271
0:11:33.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and it's a gigantic biological,

272
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
geo-microbiological laboratory.

273
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
In this cave, great areas are covered by

274
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
this reddish material that you see here,

275
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and also these enormous crystals

276
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
of selenite that you can see dangling down.

277
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:5,000
This stuff is produced biologically.

278
0:11:50.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
This is the breakdown product of the bedrock,

279
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:56,000
that organisms are busy munching their way through.

280
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:11:59,000
They take iron and manganese minerals

281
0:11:59.33,000 --> 0:12:01,000
within the bedrock and they oxidize them.

282
0:12:01.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And every time they do that, they get a tiny little packet of energy.

283
0:12:05.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And that tiny little packet of energy is what they use, then,

284
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
to run their life processes.

285
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Interestingly enough, they also do this

286
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
with uranium and chromium, and various other toxic metals.

287
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And so, the obvious avenue

288
0:12:18.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
for bio-remediation

289
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
comes from organisms like this.

290
0:12:22.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
These organisms we now bring into the lab,

291
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and you can see some of them growing on Petri plates,

292
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and get them to reproduce the precise biominerals

293
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
that we find on the walls of these caves.

294
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
So, these are signals that they leave in the rock record.

295
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Well, even in basalt surfaces in lava-tube caves,

296
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
which are a by-product of volcanic activity,

297
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
we find these walls totally covered,

298
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
in many cases,

299
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
by these beautiful, glistening silver walls,

300
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
or shiny pink or shiny red or shiny gold.

301
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And these are mineral deposits

302
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:52,000
that are also made by bacteria.

303
0:12:52.33,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And you can see in these central images here,

304
0:12:54.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
scanning electron micrographs of some of these guys --

305
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
these are gardens of these bacteria.

306
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:02,000
One of the interesting things about these particular guys

307
0:13:02.33,000 --> 0:13:04,000
is that they're in the actinomycete

308
0:13:04.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and streptomycete groups of the bacteria,

309
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:08,000
which is where we get most of our antibiotics.

310
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
The sub-surface of Earth

311
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
contains a vast biodiversity.

312
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And these organisms,

313
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
because they're very separate from the surface,

314
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
make a vast array of novel compounds.

315
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And so, the potential for exploiting this

316
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
for pharmaceutical and industrial chemical uses

317
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
is completely untapped,

318
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:3,000
but probably exceeds most of the rest

319
0:13:30.33,000 --> 0:13:32,000
of the biodiversity of the planet.

320
0:13:32.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
So, lava-tube caves--

321
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
I've just told you about organisms that live here on this planet.

322
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:39,000
We know that on Mars and the Moon

323
0:13:39.33,000 --> 0:13:41,000
there are tons of these structures.

324
0:13:41.33,000 --> 0:13:42,000
We can see them.

325
0:13:42.33,000 --> 0:13:44,000
On the left you can see a lava tube forming

326
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
at a recent eruption -- Mount Etna in Sicily --

327
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and this is the way these tubes form.

328
0:13:49.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And when they hollow out,

329
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:52,000
then they become habitats for organisms.

330
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:55,000
These are all over the planet Mars,

331
0:13:55.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and we're busy cataloguing them now.

332
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And so, there's very interesting cave real estate

333
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
on Mars, at least of that type.

334
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
In order to access

335
0:14:04.33,000 --> 0:14:07,000
these sub-surface environments that we're interested in,

336
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:1,000
we're very interested in developing the tools to do this.

337
0:14:10.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
You know, it's not easy to get into these caves.

338
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
It requires crawling, climbing,

339
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
rope-work, technical rope-work

340
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and many other complex human motions

341
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:23,000
in order to access these.

342
0:14:23.33,000 --> 0:14:26,000
We face the problem of, how can we do this robotically?

343
0:14:26.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Why would we want to do it robotically?

344
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Well, we're going to be sending

345
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
robotic missions to Mars

346
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
long in advance of human missions.

347
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And then, secondly, getting back to that earlier point that I made

348
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:41,000
about the preciousness of any life that we may find

349
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:43,000
on Mars, we don't want to contaminate it.

350
0:14:43.33,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And one of the best ways to study something without contaminating it

351
0:14:46.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
is to have an intermediary.

352
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And in this case, we're imagining

353
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:52,000
intermediary robotic devices

354
0:14:52.33,000 --> 0:14:54,000
that can actually do some of that

355
0:14:54.33,000 --> 0:14:56,000
front-end work for us,

356
0:14:56.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
to protect any potential life that we find.

357
0:14:58.33,000 --> 0:15:01,000
I'm not going to go through all of these projects now,

358
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:04,000
but we're involved in about half-a-dozen robotic development projects,

359
0:15:04.33,000 --> 0:15:07,000
in collaboration with a number of different groups.

360
0:15:07.33,000 --> 0:15:09,000
I want to talk specifically about the

361
0:15:09.33,000 --> 0:15:11,000
array that you see on the top.

362
0:15:11.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
These are hopping microbot swarms.

363
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:16,000
I'm working on this with the Field and Space Robotics Laboratory

364
0:15:16.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and my friend Steve Dubowsky at MIT,

365
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and we have come up with the idea

366
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:24,000
of having little, jumping bean-like

367
0:15:24.33,000 --> 0:15:26,000
robots

368
0:15:26.33,000 --> 0:15:29,000
that are propelled by artificial muscle,

369
0:15:29.33,000 --> 0:15:32,000
which is one of the Dubowsky Lab's specialties --

370
0:15:32.33,000 --> 0:15:34,000
are the EPAMs, or artificial muscles.

371
0:15:34.33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And these allow them to hop.

372
0:15:36.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
They behave with

373
0:15:38.33,000 --> 0:15:4,000
a swarm behavior,

374
0:15:40.33,000 --> 0:15:42,000
where they relate to each other,

375
0:15:42.33,000 --> 0:15:44,000
modeled after insect swarm behavior,

376
0:15:44.33,000 --> 0:15:47,000
and they could be made very numerous.

377
0:15:47.33,000 --> 0:15:49,000
And so, one can send a thousand of them,

378
0:15:49.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
as you can see in this upper left-hand picture,

379
0:15:52.33,000 --> 0:15:55,000
a thousand of them could fit into the payload bay

380
0:15:55.33,000 --> 0:15:58,000
that was used for one of the current MER Rovers.

381
0:15:58.33,000 --> 0:16:01,000
And these little guys -- you could lose many of them.

382
0:16:01.33,000 --> 0:16:03,000
If you send a thousand of them,

383
0:16:03.33,000 --> 0:16:05,000
you could probably get rid of 90 percent of them and still have a mission.

384
0:16:05.33,000 --> 0:16:08,000
And so, that allows you the flexibility

385
0:16:08.33,000 --> 0:16:11,000
to go into very challenging terrain

386
0:16:11.33,000 --> 0:16:13,000
and actually make your way where you want to go.

387
0:16:13.33,000 --> 0:16:16,000
Now, to wrap this up, I want to talk for two seconds

388
0:16:16.33,000 --> 0:16:19,000
about caves and the human expansion beyond Earth

389
0:16:19.33,000 --> 0:16:22,000
as a natural outgrowth of the work that we do in caves.

390
0:16:22.33,000 --> 0:16:24,000
It occurred to us a number of years ago

391
0:16:24.33,000 --> 0:16:26,000
that caves have many properties

392
0:16:26.33,000 --> 0:16:28,000
that people have used

393
0:16:28.33,000 --> 0:16:3,000
and other organisms have used as habitat in the past.

394
0:16:30.33,000 --> 0:16:33,000
And perhaps it's time we started to explore those,

395
0:16:34.33,000 --> 0:16:37,000
in the context of future Mars and the Moon exploration.

396
0:16:37.33,000 --> 0:16:42,000
So, we have just finished a NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts Phase II study,

397
0:16:42.33,000 --> 0:16:44,000
looking at the irreducible set of technologies

398
0:16:44.33,000 --> 0:16:46,000
that you would need in order to

399
0:16:46.33,000 --> 0:16:49,000
actually allow people to inhabit lava tubes

400
0:16:49.33,000 --> 0:16:51,000
on the Moon or Mars.

401
0:16:51.33,000 --> 0:16:54,000
It turns out to be a fairly simple and small list,

402
0:16:54.33,000 --> 0:16:56,000
and we have gone

403
0:16:56.33,000 --> 0:16:58,000
in the relatively primitive technology direction.

404
0:16:58.33,000 --> 0:17:01,000
So, we're talking about things like inflatable liners

405
0:17:01.33,000 --> 0:17:04,000
that can conform to the complex topological shape

406
0:17:04.33,000 --> 0:17:06,000
on the inside of a cave,

407
0:17:06.33,000 --> 0:17:1,000
foamed-in-place airlocks to deal with this complex topology,

408
0:17:10.33,000 --> 0:17:13,000
various ways of getting breathing gases

409
0:17:13.33,000 --> 0:17:16,000
made from the intrinsic materials of these bodies.

410
0:17:16.33,000 --> 0:17:18,000
And the future is there for us

411
0:17:18.33,000 --> 0:17:21,000
to use these lava-tube caves on Mars.

412
0:17:21.33,000 --> 0:17:25,000
And right now we're in caves, and we're doing science and recreation,

413
0:17:25.33,000 --> 0:17:27,000
but I think in the future we'll be using them

414
0:17:27.33,000 --> 0:17:29,000
for habitat and science on these other bodies.

415
0:17:29.33,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Now, my view of what the current status

416
0:17:32.33,000 --> 0:17:34,000
of potential life on Mars is

417
0:17:34.33,000 --> 0:17:37,000
that it's probably been on the planet,

418
0:17:37.33,000 --> 0:17:4,000
maybe one in two chances.

419
0:17:40.33,000 --> 0:17:43,000
The question as to whether

420
0:17:43.33,000 --> 0:17:47,000
there is life on Mars that is related to life on Earth

421
0:17:47.33,000 --> 0:17:49,000
has now been very muddied,

422
0:17:49.33,000 --> 0:17:5,000
because we now know,

423
0:17:50.33,000 --> 0:17:53,000
from Mars meteorites that have made it to Earth,

424
0:17:53.33,000 --> 0:17:57,000
that there's material that can be exchanged between those two planets.

425
0:17:57.33,000 --> 0:17:59,000
One of the burning questions, of course, is

426
0:17:59.33,000 --> 0:18:02,000
if we go there and find life in the sub-surface,

427
0:18:02.33,000 --> 0:18:04,000
as I fully expect that we will,

428
0:18:04.33,000 --> 0:18:06,000
is that a second genesis of life?

429
0:18:06.33,000 --> 0:18:08,000
Did life start here

430
0:18:08.33,000 --> 0:18:1,000
and was it transported there?

431
0:18:10.33,000 --> 0:18:13,000
Did it start there and get transported here?

432
0:18:13.33,000 --> 0:18:17,000
This will be a fascinating puzzle as we go into the next half-century,

433
0:18:17.33,000 --> 0:18:19,000
and where I expect that we will

434
0:18:19.33,000 --> 0:18:22,000
have more and more Mars missions to answer these questions.

435
0:18:22.33,000 --> 0:18:24,000
Thank you.

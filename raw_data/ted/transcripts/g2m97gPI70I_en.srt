1
0:00:13.309,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'll never forget the sound

2
0:00:15.525,000 --> 0:00:17,000
of laughing with my friends.

3
0:00:19,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I'll never forget the sound

4
0:00:20.82,000 --> 0:00:23,000
of my mother's voice right before I fell asleep.

5
0:00:26.426,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And I'll never forget the comforting sound of water

6
0:00:30.713,000 --> 0:00:32,000
trickling down a stream.

7
0:00:34.593,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Imagine my fear, pure fear,

8
0:00:38.622,000 --> 0:00:39,000
when, at the age of 10,

9
0:00:40.992,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I was told I was going to lose my hearing.

10
0:00:45.386,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And over the next five years,

11
0:00:47.474,000 --> 0:00:51,000
it progressed until I was classified as profoundly deaf.

12
0:00:54.35,000 --> 0:00:57,000
But I believe that losing my hearing

13
0:00:57.709,000 --> 0:01:,000
was one of the greatest gifts I've ever received.

14
0:01:02.278,000 --> 0:01:05,000
You see, I get to experience the world in a unique way.

15
0:01:06.901,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And I believe that these unique experiences

16
0:01:10.953,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that people with disabilities have

17
0:01:13.364,000 --> 0:01:18,000
is what's going to help us make and design a better world

18
0:01:18.408,000 --> 0:01:23,000
for everyone -- both for people with and without disabilities.

19
0:01:25.393,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I used to be a disability rights lawyer,

20
0:01:27.443,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and I spent a lot of my time focused on enforcing the law,

21
0:01:31.117,000 --> 0:01:33,000
ensuring that accommodations were made.

22
0:01:33.998,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And then I had to quickly learn international policy,

23
0:01:38.384,000 --> 0:01:41,000
because I was asked to work on the UN Convention

24
0:01:42.29,000 --> 0:01:44,000
that protects people with disabilities.

25
0:01:45.49,000 --> 0:01:47,000
As the leader of the NGO there,

26
0:01:48.415,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I spent most of my energy trying to convince people

27
0:01:53.097,000 --> 0:01:56,000
about the capabilities of people with disabilities.

28
0:01:57.775,000 --> 0:01:59,000
But somewhere along the way,

29
0:02:00.916,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and after many career transitions

30
0:02:03.111,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that my parents weren't so happy about --

31
0:02:05.182,000 --> 0:02:06,000
(Laughter)

32
0:02:06.792,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I stumbled upon a solution

33
0:02:09.923,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that I believe may be an even more powerful tool

34
0:02:15.307,000 --> 0:02:18,000
to solve some of the world's greatest problems,

35
0:02:18.641,000 --> 0:02:19,000
disability or not.

36
0:02:22.207,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And that tool is called design thinking.

37
0:02:27.853,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Design thinking is a process for innovation and problem solving.

38
0:02:33.773,000 --> 0:02:34,000
There are five steps.

39
0:02:35.573,000 --> 0:02:37,000
The first is defining the problem

40
0:02:38.821,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and understanding its constraints.

41
0:02:41.451,000 --> 0:02:46,000
The second is observing people in real-life situations

42
0:02:46.521,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and empathizing with them.

43
0:02:48.845,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Third, throwing out hundreds of ideas -- the more the better,

44
0:02:52.839,000 --> 0:02:53,000
the wilder the better.

45
0:02:55.186,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Fourth, prototyping: gathering whatever you can,

46
0:02:59.744,000 --> 0:03:,000
whatever you can find,

47
0:03:01.22,000 --> 0:03:03,000
to mimic your solution, to test it

48
0:03:03.843,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and to refine it.

49
0:03:05.968,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And finally, implementation:

50
0:03:08.433,000 --> 0:03:13,000
ensuring that the solution you came up with is sustainable.

51
0:03:15.007,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Warren Berger says that design thinking teaches us to look sideways,

52
0:03:21.599,000 --> 0:03:25,000
to reframe, to refine, to experiment

53
0:03:25.623,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and, probably most importantly,

54
0:03:27.994,000 --> 0:03:29,000
ask those stupid questions.

55
0:03:31.601,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Design thinkers believe that everyone is creative.

56
0:03:36.71,000 --> 0:03:4,000
They believe in bringing people from multiple disciplines together,

57
0:03:41.452,000 --> 0:03:44,000
because they want to share multiple perspectives

58
0:03:44.691,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and bring them together and ultimately merge them

59
0:03:47.131,000 --> 0:03:49,000
to form something new.

60
0:03:51.919,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Design thinking is such a successful and versatile tool

61
0:03:55.634,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that it has been applied in almost every industry.

62
0:04:00.586,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I saw the potential that it had for the issues I faced,

63
0:04:04.985,000 --> 0:04:07,000
so I decided to go back to school

64
0:04:08.241,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and get my master's in social design.

65
0:04:11.832,000 --> 0:04:16,000
This looks at how to use design to create positive change in the world.

66
0:04:18.209,000 --> 0:04:19,000
While I was there,

67
0:04:19.654,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I fell in love with woodworking.

68
0:04:22.217,000 --> 0:04:24,000
But what I quickly realized

69
0:04:24.938,000 --> 0:04:26,000
was that I was missing out on something.

70
0:04:28.058,000 --> 0:04:3,000
As you're working with a tool,

71
0:04:31.021,000 --> 0:04:33,000
right before it's about to kick back at you --

72
0:04:33.474,000 --> 0:04:36,000
which means the piece or the tool jumps back at you --

73
0:04:36.757,000 --> 0:04:37,000
it makes a sound.

74
0:04:38.992,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And I couldn't hear this sound.

75
0:04:41.313,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So I decided,

76
0:04:43.873,000 --> 0:04:44,000
why not try and solve it?

77
0:04:46.363,000 --> 0:04:49,000
My solution was a pair of safety glasses

78
0:04:49.871,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that were engineered to visually alert the user

79
0:04:53.687,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to pitch changes in the tool,

80
0:04:56.303,000 --> 0:04:58,000
before the human ear could pick it up.

81
0:05:00.802,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Why hadn't tool designers thought of this before?

82
0:05:04.692,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Laughter)

83
0:05:06.619,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Two reasons: one, I was a beginner.

84
0:05:10.856,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I wasn't weighed down by expertise or conventional wisdom.

85
0:05:16.284,000 --> 0:05:18,000
The second is: I was Deaf.

86
0:05:20.07,000 --> 0:05:24,000
My unique experience of the world helped inform my solution.

87
0:05:25.886,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And as I went on, I kept running into more and more solutions

88
0:05:29.863,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that were originally made for people with disabilities,

89
0:05:33.459,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and that ended up being picked up,

90
0:05:36.789,000 --> 0:05:38,000
embraced and loved by the mainstream,

91
0:05:39.735,000 --> 0:05:4,000
disability or not.

92
0:05:41.448,000 --> 0:05:43,000
This is an OXO potato peeler.

93
0:05:43.886,000 --> 0:05:46,000
It was originally designed for people with arthritis,

94
0:05:47.532,000 --> 0:05:49,000
but it was so comfortable, everybody loved it.

95
0:05:51.792,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Text messaging: that was originally designed for people who are Deaf.

96
0:05:56.817,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And as you know, everybody loves that, too.

97
0:05:59.091,000 --> 0:06:,000
(Laughter)

98
0:06:01.033,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I started thinking:

99
0:06:03.492,000 --> 0:06:06,000
What if we changed our mindset?

100
0:06:07.578,000 --> 0:06:12,000
What if we started designing for disability first --

101
0:06:12.73,000 --> 0:06:13,000
not the norm?

102
0:06:14.721,000 --> 0:06:17,000
As you see, when we design for disability first,

103
0:06:18.535,000 --> 0:06:22,000
we often stumble upon solutions that are not only inclusive,

104
0:06:24.09,000 --> 0:06:29,000
but also are often better than when we design for the norm.

105
0:06:30.398,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And this excites me,

106
0:06:31.977,000 --> 0:06:37,000
because this means that the energy it takes to accommodate someone

107
0:06:38.325,000 --> 0:06:39,000
with a disability

108
0:06:39.95,000 --> 0:06:43,000
can be leveraged, molded and played with

109
0:06:44.837,000 --> 0:06:48,000
as a force for creativity and innovation.

110
0:06:49.712,000 --> 0:06:54,000
This moves us from the mindset of trying to change the hearts

111
0:06:55.269,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and the deficiency mindset of tolerance,

112
0:06:58.416,000 --> 0:07:,000
to becoming an alchemist,

113
0:07:01.158,000 --> 0:07:04,000
the type of magician that this world so desperately needs

114
0:07:05.152,000 --> 0:07:07,000
to solve some of its greatest problems.

115
0:07:08.86,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Now, I also believe

116
0:07:10.918,000 --> 0:07:14,000
that people with disabilities have great potential to be designers

117
0:07:15.461,000 --> 0:07:17,000
within this design-thinking process.

118
0:07:18.36,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Without knowing it, from a very early age,

119
0:07:21.367,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I've been a design thinker, fine-tuning my skills.

120
0:07:25.621,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Design thinkers are, by nature, problem solvers.

121
0:07:31.58,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So imagine listening to a conversation

122
0:07:35.909,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and only understanding 50 percent of what is said.

123
0:07:41.64,000 --> 0:07:43,000
You can't ask them to repeat every single word.

124
0:07:44.911,000 --> 0:07:46,000
They would just get frustrated with you.

125
0:07:47.5,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So without even realizing it,

126
0:07:50.264,000 --> 0:07:54,000
my solution was to take the muffled sound I heard,

127
0:07:55.2,000 --> 0:07:56,000
that was the beat,

128
0:07:56.376,000 --> 0:08:,000
and turn it into a rhythm and place it with the lips I read.

129
0:08:01.908,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Years later, someone commented that my writing had a rhythm to it.

130
0:08:08.105,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Well, this is because I experience conversations as rhythms.

131
0:08:14.369,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I also became really, really good at failing.

132
0:08:19.468,000 --> 0:08:2,000
(Laughter)

133
0:08:20.726,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Quite literally.

134
0:08:22.801,000 --> 0:08:25,000
My first semester in Spanish, I got a D.

135
0:08:26.569,000 --> 0:08:29,000
But what I learned was that when I picked myself up

136
0:08:30.407,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and changed a few things around,

137
0:08:32.731,000 --> 0:08:34,000
eventually, I succeeded.

138
0:08:37.187,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Similarly, design thinking encourages people to fail

139
0:08:41.831,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and fail often,

140
0:08:43.491,000 --> 0:08:46,000
because eventually, you will succeed.

141
0:08:47.404,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Very few great innovations in this world

142
0:08:51.308,000 --> 0:08:54,000
have come from someone succeeding on the first try.

143
0:08:56.906,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I also experienced this lesson in sports.

144
0:09:01.46,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I'll never forget my coach saying to my mom,

145
0:09:05.389,000 --> 0:09:08,000
"If she just didn't have her hearing loss,

146
0:09:08.647,000 --> 0:09:09,000
she would be on the national team."

147
0:09:12.061,000 --> 0:09:16,000
But what my coach, and what I didn't even know at the time,

148
0:09:17.019,000 --> 0:09:21,000
was that my hearing loss actually helped me excel at sports.

149
0:09:22.704,000 --> 0:09:27,000
You see, when you lose your hearing, not only do you adapt your behavior,

150
0:09:28.441,000 --> 0:09:31,000
but you also adapt your physical senses.

151
0:09:32.785,000 --> 0:09:33,000
One example of this

152
0:09:34.459,000 --> 0:09:38,000
is that my visual attention span increased.

153
0:09:39.543,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Imagine a soccer player, coming down the left flank.

154
0:09:44.025,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Imagine being goalkeeper, like I was,

155
0:09:46.852,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and the ball is coming down the left flank.

156
0:09:49.024,000 --> 0:09:53,000
A person with normal hearing would have the visual perspective of this.

157
0:09:54.872,000 --> 0:09:57,000
I had the benefit of a spectrum this wide.

158
0:09:58.887,000 --> 0:10:,000
So I picked up the players over here,

159
0:10:01.348,000 --> 0:10:03,000
that were moving about and coming down the field.

160
0:10:03.886,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And I picked them up quicker, so that if the ball was passed,

161
0:10:07.584,000 --> 0:10:1,000
I could reposition myself and be ready for that shot.

162
0:10:12.955,000 --> 0:10:13,000
So as you can see,

163
0:10:14.496,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I've been a design thinker for nearly all my life.

164
0:10:18.788,000 --> 0:10:22,000
My observation skills have been honed so that I pick up on things

165
0:10:23.37,000 --> 0:10:24,000
that others would never pick up on.

166
0:10:27.233,000 --> 0:10:3,000
My constant need to adapt has made me a great ideator

167
0:10:31.221,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and problem solver.

168
0:10:33.392,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And I've often had to do this within limitations and constraints.

169
0:10:38.164,000 --> 0:10:42,000
This is something that designers also have to deal with frequently.

170
0:10:44.638,000 --> 0:10:46,000
My work most recently took me to Haiti.

171
0:10:48.049,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Design thinkers often seek out extreme situations,

172
0:10:52.262,000 --> 0:10:56,000
because that often informs some of their best designs.

173
0:10:56.541,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And Haiti -- it was like a perfect storm.

174
0:11:00.415,000 --> 0:11:04,000
I lived and worked with 300 Deaf individuals

175
0:11:05.656,000 --> 0:11:08,000
that were relocated after the 2010 earthquake.

176
0:11:09.805,000 --> 0:11:12,000
But five and a half years later,

177
0:11:13.566,000 --> 0:11:15,000
there still was no electricity;

178
0:11:15.722,000 --> 0:11:17,000
there still was no safe drinking water;

179
0:11:18.232,000 --> 0:11:2,000
there were still no job opportunities;

180
0:11:21.12,000 --> 0:11:24,000
there was still rampant crime, and it went unpunished.

181
0:11:25.069,000 --> 0:11:28,000
International aid organizations came one by one.

182
0:11:29.199,000 --> 0:11:3,000
But they came

183
0:11:30.375,000 --> 0:11:32,000
with pre-determined solutions.

184
0:11:33.095,000 --> 0:11:37,000
They didn't come ready to observe and to adapt

185
0:11:38.215,000 --> 0:11:41,000
based on the community's needs.

186
0:11:42.75,000 --> 0:11:46,000
One organization gave them goats and chickens.

187
0:11:47.484,000 --> 0:11:48,000
But they didn't realize

188
0:11:48.817,000 --> 0:11:51,000
that there was so much hunger in that community,

189
0:11:52.76,000 --> 0:11:55,000
that when the Deaf went to sleep at night and couldn't hear,

190
0:11:56.61,000 --> 0:11:59,000
people broke into their yards and their homes

191
0:11:59.898,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and stole these chickens and goats,

192
0:12:02.803,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and eventually they were all gone.

193
0:12:06.896,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Now, if that organization had taken the time

194
0:12:11.449,000 --> 0:12:15,000
to observe Deaf people, to observe the community,

195
0:12:17.029,000 --> 0:12:19,000
they would have realized their problem

196
0:12:19.273,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and perhaps they would have come up with a solution,

197
0:12:23.693,000 --> 0:12:26,000
something like a solar light,

198
0:12:26.795,000 --> 0:12:3,000
lighting up a secure pen to put them in at night

199
0:12:31,000 --> 0:12:32,000
to ensure their safety.

200
0:12:34.018,000 --> 0:12:37,000
You don't have to be a design thinker

201
0:12:38.013,000 --> 0:12:41,000
to insert the ideas I've shared with you today.

202
0:12:43.387,000 --> 0:12:45,000
You are creative.

203
0:12:46.793,000 --> 0:12:48,000
You are a designer --

204
0:12:49.319,000 --> 0:12:5,000
everyone is.

205
0:12:52.152,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Let people like me help you.

206
0:12:56.27,000 --> 0:13:,000
Let people with disabilities help you look sideways,

207
0:13:00.879,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and in the process,

208
0:13:02.465,000 --> 0:13:04,000
solve some of the greatest problems.

209
0:13:05.605,000 --> 0:13:06,000
That's it. Thank you.

210
0:13:06.976,000 --> 0:13:11,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
This talk is about righting writing wrongs.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
No, the sound's not faulty -- righting writing wrongs.

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
The Middle East is huge,

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and with all our problems, one thing's for sure: we love to laugh.

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I think humor is a great way to celebrate our differences.

6
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
We need to take our responsibilities seriously,

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
but not ourselves.

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Don't get me wrong: it's not like we don't have comedy in the Middle East.

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I grew up at a time when iconic actors

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
from Kuwait, Syria, Egypt

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
used laughter to unite the region,

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
just as football can.

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Now is the time for us to laugh at ourselves,

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
before others can laugh with us.

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
This is the story of the rise and rise of stand-up comedy in the Middle East --

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
a stand-up uprising, if you will.

18
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Working in London as TV maker and writer,

19
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I quickly realized

20
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
that comedy connects audiences.

21
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Now, the best breeding ground for good comic writing

22
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
is the stand-up comedy circuit,

23
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
where they just happen to say that you kill when you do well

24
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and you bomb when you do badly.

25
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
An unfortunate connection for us maybe,

26
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
but it reminds me

27
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
that we'd like to thank one man for, over the past decade,

28
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
working tirelessly

29
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
to support comedians all around the world,

30
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
specifically comedians

31
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
with a Middle Eastern background.

32
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Applause)

33
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Like my good friends, Dean and Maysoon, at the bottom of the screen,

34
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
who, two years after 9/11,

35
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
started a festival to change the way

36
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Middle Easterners are perceived in the world.

37
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It's still going strong, with positive press to die for.

38
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Also, three guys working for years in Los Angeles,

39
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
an Iranian, a Palestinian and an Egyptian,

40
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
created the aptly named Axis of Evil comedy act.

41
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And wherever they went,

42
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
they killed.

43
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Now, I didn't start this fire, but I did pour petrol on it.

44
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I moved to Dubai as the head of original content

45
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
for a Western TV network.

46
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
My job was to connect the brand with a Middle Eastern audience.

47
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Now, the American head of programming

48
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
wanted new local Arabic comedy.

49
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
In a thick Arabic accent, my brain went,

50
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
"Berfect."

51
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Now, I had friends in the U.S.

53
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
who had started a successful new tribe.

54
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And I had every intention of taking this tribe

55
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
from being outliers in the Middle East

56
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and pushing them over the tipping point

57
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
towards success.

58
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Now, as with any new idea, it wasn't easy.

59
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I had four phases to this plan.

60
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
First, we'd need to buy content from the West and air it.

61
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Then I'd bring my friends, and we'd show local amateurs how it's done.

62
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
We would film that and air it,

63
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
and then I could work with the local amateurs and write new comedy.

64
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I excitedly presented this to the big boss,

65
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and his reaction was, "Um, I don't get it."

66
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So I retreated back to my cave

67
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and continued to support and produce comedy

68
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and let my friends use my couch

69
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
as a regional operations hub.

70
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Now, fast forward two years, to early 2007.

71
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
The earth rotated, as did our management,

72
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
(Laughter)

73
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and as if by divine intervention,

74
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
things came together

75
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
to help this revolution take shape.

76
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Here's how the dots connected.

77
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
First, the Axis guys recorded a Comedy Central special

78
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that aired in the States,

79
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and it was getting great hits on YouTube.

80
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Our new French CEO

81
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
believed in the power of positive PR ...

82
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
(Laughter)

83
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and ideas du bon marche.

84
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Let's just say "value for money."

85
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I produced in Dubai a show for Ahmed Ahmed

86
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
to showcase his new Axis special to a packed room.

87
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I invited our new CEO,

88
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and as soon as he realized we had a room packed full of laughing infidels,

89
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
his reaction was very simple:

90
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
"Let's make this happen.

91
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And one more thing: No, don't F it up."

92
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So I quickly went to work

93
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
with a great team around me.

94
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I happened to find

95
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
a funny guy to present it in Arabic,

96
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
who is originally Korean,

97
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
a perfect fit for the Axis of Evil.

98
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
This is all true.

99
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Now, while preparing for the tour,

100
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I had to remind the guys to be culturally sensitive.

101
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I used the three Bs of stand-up don'ts

102
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
as I call them in the Middle East:

103
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
blue content, keep it clean; beliefs, not religion;

104
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and the third B, bolitics.

105
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Stay away from bolitics in the Middle East.

106
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Oh course, you might think, what's left

107
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
without bolitics, sex and religion, how can you make people laugh?

108
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I'd say, watch any successful well-written,

109
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
family-friendly sitcom in the West

110
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
for your answers.

111
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Now, were the Axis successful?

112
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
In five countries, in just under a month,

113
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
we had thousands of fanatical fans come and see them live.

114
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
We had millions see them on TV and on TV news.

115
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
In Jordan, we had His Majesty the King come and see them.

116
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
In fact, they were so successful

117
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
that you could buy a pirated copy of their DVD,

118
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
even before it was released in the Middle East.

119
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Anywhere you go.

120
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
So everywhere we went,

121
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
we auditioned amateurs.

122
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
We filmed that process and aired a documentary.

123
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I called it "Three Guys and Wonho."

124
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
It really is his name.

125
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And all this TV and Internet exposure

126
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
has led to a great many

127
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
recruits to our cause.

128
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
In Dubai this year, we've just had

129
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
the first all-women's, homegrown stand-up show.

130
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And notice two of them are wearing headscarves,

131
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and yes, even they can laugh.

132
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Dubai, to me, is like a hand

133
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
that supports anyone who wants to make things happen.

134
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
20 years ago,

135
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
no one had heard of it.

136
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Look at it now.

137
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
With an inspirational leader, I think this year,

138
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
the opening of the tallest tower in the world

139
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
is like adding a finger to that hand,

140
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
that points at all those

141
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
who spread fallacious stories about us.

142
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
(Laughter)

143
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
(Applause)

144
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Now, in three short years, we've come a long way

145
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
with stand-up comedy shows happening even in Saudi Arabia.

146
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
These comics are now going to the New York festival.

147
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And the Lebanese, brilliant Lebanese,

148
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Nemr Abou Nassar, we featured in our first tour,

149
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
has just been performing in L.A.'s legendary comedy clubs.

150
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So clearly, from the inside, we are doing our best to change our image,

151
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and it's exploding.

152
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
(Laughter)

153
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So, as for the outsiders looking in,

154
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
watch the CNN report on the second Amman Comedy Festival.

155
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
The reporter did a great job, and I thank her,

156
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
but somebody forgot to send the positive PR email

157
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
to the person operating the automatic news ticker that appears at the bottom.

158
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
For example, when Dean talks,

159
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
the ticker says, "U.S.: Suspect gave 'actionable intel."

160
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
Well, if you're used to listening to comedians,

161
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
then I'm not surprised.

162
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Sadly, this leads me to another three Bs

163
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that represents how the media in the West

164
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
talks about us as bombers, billionaires

165
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and belly dancers.

166
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Enough.

167
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
We're not all angry fanatics

168
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
who want to kill the infidel.

169
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
We have a positive story to tell

170
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and image to sell.

171
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
In fact, one thing's for sure, in my experience,

172
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
we love to laugh like hell.

173
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
(Laughter)

174
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Here are three questions that I like to use

175
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
to test the truthiness of our representation

176
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
in any media story.

177
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
One: Is the Middle East

178
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
being shown in a current time

179
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and correct context?

180
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
(Laughter)

181
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Two: Do the Middle Eastern characters

182
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
laugh or smile

183
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
without showing the whites of their eyes?

184
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
(Laughter)

185
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Three: Is the Middle Eastern character

186
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
being played by one?

187
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Clearly, there are wrongs that need to be righted.

188
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
We've started in our region.

189
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
My challenge to the rest of the world

190
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
is please, start using

191
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
positive Middle Eastern images in your stories.

192
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
For inspiration, go to one of our festivals,

193
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
go online, drop us a line.

194
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Let's change the narrative together

195
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and let's start righting writing wrongs.

196
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I'd like to end, before going back to the Middle East,

197
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
with a quote from one of the greatest Sheikhs

198
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
to put quill to parchment.

199
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
As my father likes to call him, "Asheikh Azubare;"

200
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
as my mother would say, "Shakespeare."

201
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
(Laughter)

202
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
"And now we go in content

203
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
to liberty and not to banishment."

204
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Thank you.

205
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
(Applause)

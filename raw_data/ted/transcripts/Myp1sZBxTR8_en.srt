2
0:00:12.441,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Two years ago, I was invited as an artist

3
0:00:15.47,000 --> 0:00:17,000
to participate in an exhibition commemorating

4
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
100 years of Islamic art in Europe.

5
0:00:20.988,000 --> 0:00:22,000
The curator had only one condition:

6
0:00:23.428,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I had to use the Arabic script for my artwork.

7
0:00:26.918,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Now, as an artist, a woman, an Arab,

8
0:00:30.029,000 --> 0:00:33,000
or a human being living in the world in 2010,

9
0:00:33.671,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I only had one thing to say:

10
0:00:36.636,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I wanted to say no.

11
0:00:39.446,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And in Arabic, to say "no," we say "no,

12
0:00:41.662,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and a thousand times no."

13
0:00:43.982,000 --> 0:00:46,000
So I decided to look for a thousand different noes.

14
0:00:47.778,000 --> 0:00:48,000
on everything ever produced

15
0:00:49.624,000 --> 0:00:53,000
under Islamic or Arab patronage in the past 1,400 years,

16
0:00:54.305,000 --> 0:00:57,000
from Spain to the borders of China.

17
0:00:58.186,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I collected my findings in a book,

18
0:01:00.185,000 --> 0:01:03,000
placed them chronologically, stating the name,

19
0:01:03.629,000 --> 0:01:06,000
the patron, the medium and the date.

20
0:01:07.099,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Now, the book sat on a small shelf next to the installation,

21
0:01:10.298,000 --> 0:01:13,000
which stood three by seven meters, in Munich, Germany,

22
0:01:13.905,000 --> 0:01:16,000
in September of 2010.

23
0:01:17.419,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Now, in January, 2011, the revolution started,

24
0:01:23.323,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and life stopped for 18 days,

25
0:01:26.146,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and on the 12th of February,

26
0:01:27.605,000 --> 0:01:29,000
we naively celebrated on the streets of Cairo,

27
0:01:30.593,000 --> 0:01:34,000
believing that the revolution had succeeded.

28
0:01:34.626,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Nine months later I found myself spraying messages

29
0:01:38.282,000 --> 0:01:42,000
in Tahrir Square. The reason for this act

30
0:01:42.482,000 --> 0:01:45,000
was this image that I saw in my newsfeed.

31
0:01:46.241,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I did not feel that I could live in a city

32
0:01:49.137,000 --> 0:01:51,000
where people were being killed

33
0:01:51.144,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and thrown like garbage on the street.

34
0:01:54.112,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So I took one "no" off a tombstone from

35
0:01:56.438,000 --> 0:01:59,000
the Islamic Museum in Cairo, and I added a message to it:

36
0:02:00.023,000 --> 0:02:01,000
"no to military rule."

37
0:02:01.69,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And I started spraying that on the streets in Cairo.

38
0:02:04.706,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But that led to a series of no, coming out of the book

39
0:02:07.737,000 --> 0:02:09,000
like ammunition, and adding messages to them,

40
0:02:10.706,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and I started spraying them on the walls.

41
0:02:13.106,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So I'll be sharing some of these noes with you.

42
0:02:15.812,000 --> 0:02:17,000
No to a new Pharaoh, because whoever comes next

43
0:02:18.41,000 --> 0:02:21,000
should understand that we will never be ruled by another dictator.

44
0:02:22.316,000 --> 0:02:26,000
No to violence: Ramy Essam came to Tahrir

45
0:02:26.462,000 --> 0:02:27,000
on the second day of the revolution,

46
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and he sat there with this guitar, singing.

47
0:02:31.79,000 --> 0:02:35,000
One month after Mubarak stepped down, this was his reward.

48
0:02:36.079,000 --> 0:02:41,000
No to blinding heroes. Ahmed Harara lost his right eye

49
0:02:41.105,000 --> 0:02:42,000
on the 28th of January,

50
0:02:42.856,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and he lost his left eye on the 19th of November,

51
0:02:46.202,000 --> 0:02:49,000
by two different snipers.

52
0:02:49.688,000 --> 0:02:52,000
No to killing, in this case no to killing men of religion,

53
0:02:53.013,000 --> 0:02:56,000
because Sheikh Ahmed Adina Refaat was shot

54
0:02:56.199,000 --> 0:02:59,000
on December 16th, during a demonstration,

55
0:02:59.561,000 --> 0:03:02,000
leaving behind three orphans and a widow.

56
0:03:03.421,000 --> 0:03:06,000
No to burning books. The Institute of Egypt was burned

57
0:03:06.704,000 --> 0:03:1,000
on December 17th, a huge cultural loss.

58
0:03:10.924,000 --> 0:03:12,000
No to stripping the people,

59
0:03:13.313,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and the blue bra is to remind us of our shame

60
0:03:16.807,000 --> 0:03:19,000
as a nation when we allow a veiled woman to be stripped

61
0:03:20.757,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and beaten on the street, and the footprint reads,

62
0:03:24.758,000 --> 0:03:26,000
"Long live a peaceful revolution,"

63
0:03:26.91,000 --> 0:03:29,000
because we will never retaliate with violence.

64
0:03:30.43,000 --> 0:03:33,000
No to barrier walls. On February 5th,

65
0:03:33.845,000 --> 0:03:37,000
concrete roadblocks were set up in Cairo

66
0:03:38.038,000 --> 0:03:43,000
to protect the Ministry of Defense from protesters.

67
0:03:43.719,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Now, speaking of walls, I want to share with you the story

68
0:03:46.164,000 --> 0:03:48,000
of one wall in Cairo.

69
0:03:48.966,000 --> 0:03:52,000
A group of artists decided to paint a life-size tank

70
0:03:53.273,000 --> 0:03:54,000
on a wall. It's one to one.

71
0:03:55.115,000 --> 0:03:58,000
In front of this tank there's a man on a bicycle

72
0:03:58.979,000 --> 0:04:01,000
with a breadbasket on his head. To any passerby,

73
0:04:02.093,000 --> 0:04:04,000
there's no problem with this visual.

74
0:04:04.947,000 --> 0:04:07,000
After acts of violence, another artist came,

75
0:04:08.861,000 --> 0:04:12,000
painted blood, protesters being run over by the tank,

76
0:04:13.334,000 --> 0:04:16,000
demonstrators, and a message that read,

77
0:04:16.38,000 --> 0:04:19,000
"Starting tomorrow, I wear the new face,

78
0:04:19.727,000 --> 0:04:22,000
the face of every martyr. I exist."

79
0:04:23.446,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Authority comes, paints the wall white,

80
0:04:26.347,000 --> 0:04:28,000
leaves the tank and adds a message:

81
0:04:28.989,000 --> 0:04:33,000
"Army and people, one hand. Egypt for Egyptians."

82
0:04:34.018,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Another artist comes, paints the head of the military

83
0:04:37.653,000 --> 0:04:4,000
as a monster eating a maiden in a river of blood

84
0:04:41.015,000 --> 0:04:43,000
in front of the tank.

85
0:04:43.707,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Authority comes, paints the wall white, leaves the tank,

86
0:04:47.708,000 --> 0:04:49,000
leaves the suit, and throws a bucket of black paint

87
0:04:50.336,000 --> 0:04:51,000
just to hide the face of the monster.

88
0:04:51.943,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So I come with my stencils, and I spray them on the suit,

89
0:04:55.836,000 --> 0:04:57,000
on the tank, and on the whole wall,

90
0:04:58.261,000 --> 0:05:,000
and this is how it stands today

91
0:05:00.335,000 --> 0:05:01,000
until further notice. (Laughter)

92
0:05:02.114,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Now, I want to leave you with a final no.

93
0:05:06.38,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I found Neruda scribbled on a piece of paper

94
0:05:09.995,000 --> 0:05:14,000
in a field hospital in Tahrir, and I decided to take a no of

95
0:05:15.224,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Mamluk Mausoleum in Cairo.

96
0:05:17.538,000 --> 0:05:18,000
The message reads,

97
0:05:19.323,000 --> 0:05:25,000
[Arabic]

98
0:05:25.732,000 --> 0:05:28,000
"You can crush the flowers, but you can't delay spring."

99
0:05:29.409,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Thank you. (Applause)

100
0:05:33.264,000 --> 0:05:42,000
(Applause)

101
0:05:42.285,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Thank you. Shukran. (Applause)

1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
How does the news shape the way we see the world?

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Here's the world based on the way it looks -- based on landmass.

3
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And here's how news shapes what Americans see.

4
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
This map -- (Applause) -- this map shows the number of seconds

5
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that American network and cable news organizations dedicated to news stories,

6
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
by country, in February of 2007 -- just one year ago.

7
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Now, this was a month when North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities.

8
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
There was massive flooding in Indonesia.

9
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And in Paris, the IPCC released its study confirming man's impact on global warming.

10
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
The U.S. accounted for 79 percent of total news coverage.

11
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And when we take out the U.S. and look at the remaining 21 percent,

12
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
we see a lot of Iraq -- that's that big green thing there -- and little else.

13
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
The combined coverage of Russia, China and India, for example, reached just one percent.

14
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
When we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story,

15
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
here's how the world looked.

16
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
What was that story? The death of Anna Nicole Smith.

17
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
This story eclipsed every country except Iraq,

18
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and received 10 times the coverage of the IPCC report.

19
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And the cycle continues;

20
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
as we all know, Britney has loomed pretty large lately.

21
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So, why don't we hear more about the world?

22
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
One reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by half.

23
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Aside from one-person ABC mini-bureaus in Nairobi, New Delhi and Mumbai,

24
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
there are no network news bureaus in all of Africa, India or South America

25
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
-- places that are home to more than two billion people.

26
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
The reality is that covering Britney is cheaper.

27
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And this lack of global coverage is all the more disturbing

28
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
when we see where people go for news.

29
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Local TV news looms large,

30
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and unfortunately only dedicates 12 percent of its coverage to international news.

31
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And what about the web?

32
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
The most popular news sites don't do much better.

33
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Last year, Pew and the Colombia J-School analyzed the 14,000 stories

34
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that appeared on Google News' front page.

35
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And they, in fact, covered the same 24 news events.

36
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Similarly, a study in e-content showed that much of global news from U.S. news creators

37
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
is recycled stories from the AP wire services and Reuters,

38
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and don't put things into a context that people can understand their connection to it.

39
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So, if you put it all together, this could help explain why today's college graduates,

40
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
as well as less educated Americans,

41
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
know less about the world than their counterparts did 20 years ago.

42
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And if you think it's simply because we are not interested,

43
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
you would be wrong.

44
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
In recent years, Americans who say they closely follow global news most of the time

45
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
grew to over 50 percent.

46
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
The real question: is this distorted worldview what we want for Americans

47
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
in our increasingly interconnected world?

48
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I know we can do better.

49
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And can we afford not to? Thank you.

1
0:00:12.871,000 --> 0:00:17,000
There are about 5,000 women here today.

2
0:00:20.501,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Among us, 1,250 have been or will be sexually assaulted

3
0:00:26.678,000 --> 0:00:28,000
at some point in our lives.

4
0:00:31.518,000 --> 0:00:33,000
One in four.

5
0:00:36.05,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Only 10 percent will report it.

6
0:00:40.998,000 --> 0:00:44,000
The other 90 percent take refuge in silence --

7
0:00:47.332,000 --> 0:00:52,000
half of them, because the incident involves a close family member

8
0:00:52.738,000 --> 0:00:54,000
or someone they know,

9
0:00:55.173,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and that makes it much more difficult to deal with and talk about.

10
0:01:01.625,000 --> 0:01:04,000
The other half don't talk about it

11
0:01:05.485,000 --> 0:01:08,000
because they fear they won’t be believed.

12
0:01:09.45,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And they're right -- because we don't.

13
0:01:15.054,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Today I want to share with you why I think we don't believe them.

14
0:01:20.738,000 --> 0:01:24,000
We don't believe them because when a woman tells what happened to her,

15
0:01:25.023,000 --> 0:01:27,000
she tells us things we can't imagine,

16
0:01:28.634,000 --> 0:01:29,000
things that disturb us,

17
0:01:30.077,000 --> 0:01:32,000
things we don't expect to hear,

18
0:01:32.349,000 --> 0:01:33,000
things that shock us.

19
0:01:35.009,000 --> 0:01:39,000
We expect to hear stories like this one:

20
0:01:41.467,000 --> 0:01:44,000
"Girl raped near the Mitre Railroad tracks.

21
0:01:44.593,000 --> 0:01:47,000
It happened at midnight as she was on her way home.

22
0:01:48.147,000 --> 0:01:52,000
She said that someone attacked her from behind,

23
0:01:52.367,000 --> 0:01:56,000
told her not to scream, said he had a gun and that she shouldn't move.

24
0:01:56.687,000 --> 0:01:58,000
He raped her and then fled the scene."

25
0:02:02.034,000 --> 0:02:05,000
When we hear or read a story like this,

26
0:02:05.932,000 --> 0:02:08,000
we immediately visualize it:

27
0:02:10.212,000 --> 0:02:13,000
the rapist, a depraved lower-class man.

28
0:02:15.162,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And the victim, a young, attractive woman.

29
0:02:21.916,000 --> 0:02:26,000
The image only lasts 10 or 20 seconds, and it's dark and two-dimensional;

30
0:02:27.723,000 --> 0:02:31,000
there's no movement, no sound; it's as if there were no people involved.

31
0:02:33.713,000 --> 0:02:38,000
But when a woman tells her story, it doesn't fit in 10 or 20 seconds.

32
0:02:40.542,000 --> 0:02:44,000
The following is the testimony of a woman I'll call "Ana."

33
0:02:46.272,000 --> 0:02:49,000
She's one of the 85 women I interviewed

34
0:02:49.609,000 --> 0:02:53,000
while conducting research on sexual assault.

35
0:02:56.115,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Ana told me:

36
0:03:01.191,000 --> 0:03:05,000
"I had gone with the girls in the office to the same pub we always go to.

37
0:03:06.482,000 --> 0:03:07,000
We met some guys,

38
0:03:08.015,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and I hooked up with this super cool guy; we talked a lot.

39
0:03:13.911,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Around 4am, I told my friends it was time to go.

40
0:03:16.928,000 --> 0:03:17,000
They wanted to stay.

41
0:03:18.727,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So, the guy asked me where I lived

42
0:03:21.65,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and said if it was OK with me, he'd drive me home.

43
0:03:24.501,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I agreed, and we left.

44
0:03:27.564,000 --> 0:03:31,000
At a stoplight, he told me he liked me and touched my leg.

45
0:03:32.66,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I don't like a guy to approach me that way,

46
0:03:35.344,000 --> 0:03:38,000
but he had been affectionate all night.

47
0:03:38.373,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I thought, 'I shouldn't be so paranoid.

48
0:03:41.238,000 --> 0:03:43,000
What if I say something but he didn't mean anything by it,

49
0:03:44.022,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and I offend him?'

50
0:03:46.491,000 --> 0:03:48,000
When he should have made a turn, he kept going straight.

51
0:03:49.317,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I thought he had made a mistake, and I said,

52
0:03:51.704,000 --> 0:03:52,000
'You should have turned there.'

53
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
But something felt off.

54
0:03:57.202,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Thinking back, I wonder,

55
0:03:58.745,000 --> 0:04:01,000
'Why didn't I pay attention to what I was feeling?'

56
0:04:03.487,000 --> 0:04:06,000
When he pulled over near the highway,

57
0:04:06.616,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that's when I got scared.

58
0:04:09.769,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But he told me to relax, that he liked me,

59
0:04:12.433,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and that nothing would happen unless I wanted it to.

60
0:04:15.015,000 --> 0:04:16,000
He was nice.

61
0:04:17.296,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I didn't say anything,

62
0:04:18.484,000 --> 0:04:2,000
because I was afraid he would get angry,

63
0:04:20.58,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and that things would get worse.

64
0:04:23.008,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I thought he might have a gun in the glove compartment.

65
0:04:26.819,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Suddenly, he jumped on me and tried to kiss me.

66
0:04:30.722,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I said no. I wanted to push him away, but he was holding my arms down.

67
0:04:35.658,000 --> 0:04:38,000
When I wriggled free, I tried to open the door, but it was locked.

68
0:04:40.289,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And even if I had gotten out, where would I have gone?

69
0:04:46.028,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I told him he wasn't the kind of guy who needed to do that to be with a girl,

70
0:04:51.226,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and that I liked him, too, but not in that way.

71
0:04:54.241,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I tried to calm him down.

72
0:04:56.901,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I said nice things about him.

73
0:04:59.317,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I talked to him as if I were his older sister.

74
0:05:03.344,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Suddenly, he covered my mouth with one hand

75
0:05:07.004,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and with the other hand he unbuckled his belt.

76
0:05:11.043,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I thought right then he would kill me, strangle me, you know?

77
0:05:17.551,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I never felt so alone,

78
0:05:20.096,000 --> 0:05:21,000
like I had been kidnapped.

79
0:05:22.55,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I asked him to finish quickly and then take me home."

80
0:05:27.651,000 --> 0:05:3,000
How did you feel listening to this story?

81
0:05:31.765,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Surely, several questions arose.

82
0:05:37.279,000 --> 0:05:43,000
For example: Why didn't she roll down the window and call for help?

83
0:05:44.42,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Why didn't she get out of the car when she felt something bad might happen?

84
0:05:49.361,000 --> 0:05:52,000
How could she ask him to take her home?

85
0:05:55.277,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Now, when we hear this kind of story not on the news

86
0:05:59.471,000 --> 0:06:04,000
or from someone like me, presenting it on a stage like this --

87
0:06:06.396,000 --> 0:06:08,000
when we're hearing it from someone we know

88
0:06:10.145,000 --> 0:06:16,000
who chose to entrust us with the story of what happened to them,

89
0:06:17.507,000 --> 0:06:19,000
we'll have to listen.

90
0:06:20.575,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And we'll hear things we won't be able to understand --

91
0:06:26.229,000 --> 0:06:27,000
or accept.

92
0:06:28.957,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And then doubts, questions and suspicion will creep in.

93
0:06:36.253,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And that is going to make us feel really bad and guilty.

94
0:06:42.122,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So to protect ourselves from the discomfort, we have an option.

95
0:06:48.4,000 --> 0:06:53,000
We turn up the volume on all the parts of the story

96
0:06:54.018,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that we expected to hear:

97
0:06:56.469,000 --> 0:07:01,000
a gun in the glove compartment, the locked doors, the isolated location.

98
0:07:03.537,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And we turn down the volume on all the parts of the story

99
0:07:07.732,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that we didn't expect to hear

100
0:07:09.894,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and that we don't want to hear;

101
0:07:13.095,000 --> 0:07:18,000
like when she tells him that she liked him, too,

102
0:07:18.4,000 --> 0:07:22,000
or when she tells us she spoke to him as if she were his older sister,

103
0:07:22.526,000 --> 0:07:24,000
or that she asked him to take her home.

104
0:07:26.939,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Why do we do this?

105
0:07:30.015,000 --> 0:07:31,000
It's so we can believe her;

106
0:07:32.755,000 --> 0:07:36,000
so we can feel confident that she really was a victim.

107
0:07:39.797,000 --> 0:07:43,000
I call this "victimization of the victim."

108
0:07:44.112,000 --> 0:07:48,000
"Victimization," because in order to believe she's innocent,

109
0:07:48.918,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that she's a victim,

110
0:07:50.702,000 --> 0:07:56,000
we need to think of her as helpless, paralyzed, mute.

111
0:07:59.268,000 --> 0:08:02,000
But there's another way to avoid the discomfort.

112
0:08:04.167,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And it's exactly the opposite:

113
0:08:07.395,000 --> 0:08:11,000
we turn up the volume on the things we didn't expect to hear,

114
0:08:12.111,000 --> 0:08:15,000
such as "I spoke nicely to him," "I asked him to take me home,"

115
0:08:15.743,000 --> 0:08:16,000
"I asked him to finish quickly,"

116
0:08:18.683,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and we turn down the volume on the things we did expect to hear:

117
0:08:23.008,000 --> 0:08:25,000
the gun in the glove compartment,

118
0:08:25.209,000 --> 0:08:26,000
the isolation.

119
0:08:30.234,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Why do we do this?

120
0:08:32.839,000 --> 0:08:36,000
We do it so we can cling to the doubts

121
0:08:37.606,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and feel more comfortable about them.

122
0:08:40.31,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Then, new questions arise, for instance:

123
0:08:47.836,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Who told her go to those clubs?

124
0:08:51.452,000 --> 0:08:54,000
You saw how she and her friends were dressed, right?

125
0:08:55.05,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Those miniskirts, those necklines?

126
0:08:58.164,000 --> 0:08:59,000
What do you expect?

127
0:09:00.805,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Questions that aren't really questions, but rather, judgments --

128
0:09:06.631,000 --> 0:09:09,000
judgments that end in a verdict:

129
0:09:11.302,000 --> 0:09:13,000
she asked for it.

130
0:09:15.164,000 --> 0:09:18,000
That finding would be verified by the fact

131
0:09:18.545,000 --> 0:09:23,000
that she didn't mention having struggled to avoid being raped.

132
0:09:24.475,000 --> 0:09:26,000
So that means she didn't resist.

133
0:09:30.102,000 --> 0:09:32,000
It means she consented.

134
0:09:32.641,000 --> 0:09:35,000
If she asked for it and allowed it,

135
0:09:36.743,000 --> 0:09:37,000
how are we calling it rape?

136
0:09:40.158,000 --> 0:09:43,000
I call this "blaming the victim."

137
0:09:45.476,000 --> 0:09:51,000
These arguments that serve us both to blame and to victimize,

138
0:09:52.244,000 --> 0:09:56,000
we all have them in our heads, at hand --

139
0:09:57.777,000 --> 0:10:,000
including victims and perpetrators.

140
0:10:01.853,000 --> 0:10:04,000
So much so, that when Ana came to me,

141
0:10:06.592,000 --> 0:10:09,000
she told me she didn't know

142
0:10:09.827,000 --> 0:10:11,000
if her testimony was going to be of any use,

143
0:10:13.914,000 --> 0:10:19,000
because she wasn't sure if what happened to her qualified as rape.

144
0:10:22.294,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Ana believed, like most of us,

145
0:10:24.978,000 --> 0:10:28,000
that rape is more like armed robbery --

146
0:10:29.378,000 --> 0:10:33,000
a violent act that lasts 4 or 5 minutes --

147
0:10:34.254,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and not smooth talking from a nice guy

148
0:10:37.96,000 --> 0:10:41,000
that lasts all night and ends in a kidnapping.

149
0:10:45.8,000 --> 0:10:48,000
When she felt afraid she might be killed,

150
0:10:48.92,000 --> 0:10:51,000
she was afraid to be left with scars,

151
0:10:52.467,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and she had to give her body to avoid it.

152
0:10:56.075,000 --> 0:10:58,000
That's when she knew that rape was something different.

153
0:11:02.317,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Ana had never talked about this with anyone.

154
0:11:07.427,000 --> 0:11:09,000
She could have turned to her family,

155
0:11:10.583,000 --> 0:11:11,000
but she didn't.

156
0:11:12.811,000 --> 0:11:14,000
She didn't because she was afraid.

157
0:11:16.097,000 --> 0:11:21,000
She was afraid the person she'd choose to tell her story to

158
0:11:22.072,000 --> 0:11:26,000
would have the same reaction as the rest of us:

159
0:11:26.21,000 --> 0:11:29,000
they'd have doubts, suspicions;

160
0:11:30.36,000 --> 0:11:35,000
those same questions we always have when it comes to things like this.

161
0:11:35.529,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And if that had happened,

162
0:11:37.477,000 --> 0:11:4,000
it would have been worse, perhaps, than the rape itself.

163
0:11:42.195,000 --> 0:11:45,000
She could have talked to a friend or a sister.

164
0:11:47.261,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And with her partner, it would have been extremely difficult:

165
0:11:51.178,000 --> 0:11:55,000
the slightest hint of doubt on his face or in his voice

166
0:11:55.529,000 --> 0:11:57,000
would have been devastating for her

167
0:11:58.227,000 --> 0:12:,000
and would have probably meant the end of their relationship.

168
0:12:03.417,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Ana keeps silent because deep down she knows

169
0:12:07.561,000 --> 0:12:13,000
that nobody -- none of us, not her family or therapists,

170
0:12:13.97,000 --> 0:12:16,000
let alone the police or judges --

171
0:12:17.776,000 --> 0:12:23,000
are willing to hear what Ana actually did in that moment.

172
0:12:26.784,000 --> 0:12:29,000
First and foremost, Ana said, "No."

173
0:12:32.198,000 --> 0:12:34,000
When she saw that her "no" didn't help,

174
0:12:35.264,000 --> 0:12:36,000
she spoke nicely to him.

175
0:12:37.483,000 --> 0:12:4,000
She tried not to exacerbate his violence

176
0:12:40.73,000 --> 0:12:41,000
or give him ideas.

177
0:12:44.028,000 --> 0:12:49,000
She talked to him as if everything that was happening were normal,

178
0:12:49.942,000 --> 0:12:54,000
so he wouldn't be thinking that she would turn him in later.

179
0:12:59.779,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Now, I wonder and I ask all of you:

180
0:13:05.857,000 --> 0:13:07,000
All those things she did --

181
0:13:08.433,000 --> 0:13:09,000
isn't that considered resisting?

182
0:13:12.89,000 --> 0:13:13,000
No.

183
0:13:14.255,000 --> 0:13:17,000
For all or at least most of us, it's not,

184
0:13:17.823,000 --> 0:13:2,000
probably because it's not "resisting" in the eyes of the law.

185
0:13:22.55,000 --> 0:13:23,000
In most countries,

186
0:13:24.044,000 --> 0:13:3,000
the laws still require that the victim prove her innocence --

187
0:13:30.392,000 --> 0:13:34,000
that's right: the victim needs to prove her innocence --

188
0:13:34.804,000 --> 0:13:36,000
by showing marks on her body

189
0:13:37.704,000 --> 0:13:41,000
as evidence that she engaged in a vigorous and continuous fight

190
0:13:42.698,000 --> 0:13:43,000
with her aggressor.

191
0:13:46.157,000 --> 0:13:5,000
I can assure you, in most court cases,

192
0:13:50.502,000 --> 0:13:52,000
no amount of marks is ever enough.

193
0:13:55.633,000 --> 0:13:57,000
I listened to many women's stories.

194
0:14:00.299,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And I didn't hear any of them talking about themselves

195
0:14:06.406,000 --> 0:14:09,000
as if they had been reduced to a thing,

196
0:14:09.505,000 --> 0:14:12,000
totally subjected to the will of the other.

197
0:14:14.949,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Rather, they sounded astonished and even a little proud

198
0:14:20.912,000 --> 0:14:21,000
looking back

199
0:14:23.978,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and thinking how clear-headed they had been at the time,

200
0:14:28.057,000 --> 0:14:31,000
of how much attention they paid to every detail,

201
0:14:31.247,000 --> 0:14:36,000
as if that would allow them to exert some control over what was happening.

202
0:14:39.302,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Then I realized,

203
0:14:42.086,000 --> 0:14:43,000
of course --

204
0:14:43.269,000 --> 0:14:45,000
what women are doing in these situations

205
0:14:47.805,000 --> 0:14:48,000
is negotiating.

206
0:14:51.099,000 --> 0:14:53,000
They're trading sex for life.

207
0:14:57.822,000 --> 0:15:,000
They ask the aggressor to finish quickly,

208
0:15:02.506,000 --> 0:15:06,000
so everything is over as soon as possible and at the lowest cost.

209
0:15:08.024,000 --> 0:15:12,000
They subject themselves to penetration,

210
0:15:13.708,000 --> 0:15:16,000
because believe it or not,

211
0:15:17.176,000 --> 0:15:21,000
penetration is what keeps them furthest

212
0:15:21.536,000 --> 0:15:23,000
from a sexual or emotional scenario.

213
0:15:26.397,000 --> 0:15:29,000
They subject themselves to penetration,

214
0:15:29.473,000 --> 0:15:32,000
because penetration is less painful

215
0:15:34.034,000 --> 0:15:38,000
than kisses, caresses and gentle words.

216
0:15:42.541,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Now, if we continue to expect

217
0:15:47.051,000 --> 0:15:5,000
rape to be what it very rarely is --

218
0:15:52.599,000 --> 0:15:54,000
with the rapist as a depraved lower-class man

219
0:15:56.682,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and not a university student or a businessman

220
0:16:00.634,000 --> 0:16:02,000
who goes out chasing after girls on a Friday or Saturday;

221
0:16:04.607,000 --> 0:16:09,000
if we keep expecting the victims to be demure women

222
0:16:09.997,000 --> 0:16:12,000
who faint on the scene,

223
0:16:13.064,000 --> 0:16:15,000
and not self-confident women --

224
0:16:17.853,000 --> 0:16:2,000
we will continue to be unable to listen.

225
0:16:22.017,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Women will continue to be unable to speak.

226
0:16:26.963,000 --> 0:16:3,000
And we will all continue to be responsible

227
0:16:31.857,000 --> 0:16:32,000
for that silence

228
0:16:34.288,000 --> 0:16:35,000
and their solitude.

229
0:16:37.433,000 --> 0:16:43,000
(Applause)

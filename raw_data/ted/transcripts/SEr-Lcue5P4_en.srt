1
0:00:13.066,000 --> 0:00:14,000
My name is Joel,

2
0:00:15.231,000 --> 0:00:16,000
and I'm a co-parent.

3
0:00:18.238,000 --> 0:00:2,000
So, growing up, I never heard the term "co-parent."

4
0:00:20.876,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I heard a lot of other things, though,

5
0:00:23.711,000 --> 0:00:26,000
for starters, "absentee father,"

6
0:00:26.942,000 --> 0:00:28,000
"sperm donor" --

7
0:00:29.113,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that's a good one --

8
0:00:31.302,000 --> 0:00:32,000
"deadbeat dad"

9
0:00:32.505,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and, my personal favorite, "baby daddy."

10
0:00:36.126,000 --> 0:00:38,000
"Baby daddy," for those not in the know,

11
0:00:38.181,000 --> 0:00:41,000
refers to an individual who helps to conceive a child

12
0:00:41.393,000 --> 0:00:42,000
but does little else.

13
0:00:43.988,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Baby daddy is also someone who is not married by law

14
0:00:46.763,000 --> 0:00:47,000
to the mother of said child.

15
0:00:49.8,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Growing up, I thought "co-parent" was reserved primarily for white families

16
0:00:54.326,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that starred in Netflix prime-time dramas.

17
0:00:56.873,000 --> 0:00:57,000
(Laughter)

18
0:00:59.099,000 --> 0:01:01,000
It still kind of does.

19
0:01:01.393,000 --> 0:01:04,000
But it wasn't used to explain the role of a parent. Right?

20
0:01:04.502,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Either you had kids or you didn't,

21
0:01:06.237,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and no one in my social circles or at our dinner table

22
0:01:10.925,000 --> 0:01:13,000
was having complex conversations about the role fathers played

23
0:01:14.413,000 --> 0:01:15,000
in that conversation, right?

24
0:01:15.858,000 --> 0:01:18,000
A more balanced, open, loving approach to parenting

25
0:01:19.8,000 --> 0:01:22,000
was not something we were discussing within our social circles.

26
0:01:23.441,000 --> 0:01:25,000
A majority of the time,

27
0:01:25.511,000 --> 0:01:28,000
the fathers I knew of growing up were barely present

28
0:01:28.978,000 --> 0:01:3,000
or just completely nonexistent.

29
0:01:31.295,000 --> 0:01:33,000
"Co-parent" wasn't a term I heard or saw

30
0:01:34.247,000 --> 0:01:36,000
where I grew up, where I came from.

31
0:01:37.236,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I come from the hood.

32
0:01:39.368,000 --> 0:01:41,000
That hood would be Creston Avenue, 188th in the Bronx.

33
0:01:43.301,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And for -- one person, that's what's up.

34
0:01:46.586,000 --> 0:01:47,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:48.002,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Appreciate that.

36
0:01:51.11,000 --> 0:01:52,000
For a lot of us in that hood,

37
0:01:52.71,000 --> 0:01:54,000
there was only one person you could already turn to

38
0:01:55.469,000 --> 0:01:59,000
for food, shelter, warmth, love, discipline:

39
0:02:00.129,000 --> 0:02:01,000
our mothers.

40
0:02:02.064,000 --> 0:02:04,000
My mother, who I playfully call "Linda T,"

41
0:02:04.194,000 --> 0:02:05,000
was my first example of real love

42
0:02:05.794,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and what showing up as a healthy co-parent looked like.

43
0:02:08.812,000 --> 0:02:1,000
She was a strong, determined single mother,

44
0:02:11.164,000 --> 0:02:15,000
a woman who would have benefited greatly from having a secure and stable partner

45
0:02:15.334,000 --> 0:02:16,000
as a co-parent.

46
0:02:17.136,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So I vowed whenever I got married,

47
0:02:19.885,000 --> 0:02:21,000
my boo and I would be together forever.

48
0:02:22.365,000 --> 0:02:23,000
You know? (Laughs)

49
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
We'd share the same bed and home,

50
0:02:26.538,000 --> 0:02:29,000
we'd sleep under the same covers, we'd argue at IKEA -- normal stuff.

51
0:02:30.072,000 --> 0:02:31,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:31.963,000 --> 0:02:32,000
My partner would feel seen and loved,

53
0:02:33.977,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and our children would grow up in a two-parent household.

54
0:02:37.784,000 --> 0:02:41,000
However, things rarely ever end up how we plan them.

55
0:02:43.523,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Our daughter Lilah has never known a household with both of her parents

56
0:02:47.323,000 --> 0:02:48,000
living together under one roof.

57
0:02:49.727,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Her mother and I were never married.

58
0:02:52.181,000 --> 0:02:55,000
We dated on and off for several months before we found out she was pregnant.

59
0:02:55.854,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Up until then, my mother didn't even know she existed.

60
0:02:59.504,000 --> 0:03:,000
I was ashamed,

61
0:03:01.078,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I was embarrassed,

62
0:03:02.258,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and, at times, I was suicidal.

63
0:03:05.409,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I was asking myself, what was I doing? Where was I going wrong?

64
0:03:09.753,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I never wanted the stigma or label

65
0:03:12.346,000 --> 0:03:15,000
of what some identified as the stereotypical "black father."

66
0:03:15.888,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So: absentee, confrontational, combative, not present.

67
0:03:22.319,000 --> 0:03:25,000
It took a lot of work, time, energy and effort

68
0:03:26.273,000 --> 0:03:28,000
for us to finally realize

69
0:03:28.443,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that maybe co-parenting for us didn't need to mean a shared household

70
0:03:32.699,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and wedding bells,

71
0:03:34.095,000 --> 0:03:36,000
that maybe, just maybe,

72
0:03:36.932,000 --> 0:03:37,000
the way we showed up as co-parents

73
0:03:38.601,000 --> 0:03:41,000
lay not only in the layered nuances of our partnership

74
0:03:42.477,000 --> 0:03:44,000
but the capacity within our hearts to tend to a human

75
0:03:45.414,000 --> 0:03:47,000
that we helped create together.

76
0:03:49.268,000 --> 0:03:51,000
(Applause)

77
0:03:54.174,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It would involve love in a nurturing and safe environment

78
0:03:57.856,000 --> 0:04:02,000
that would feed Lilah long after we both left this earth.

79
0:04:07.1,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Fast-forward four years,

80
0:04:09.805,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and Lilah is now in pre-K.

81
0:04:12.859,000 --> 0:04:13,000
She loves gummies,

82
0:04:14.293,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and she says things like, "My heart is filled with love."

83
0:04:19.172,000 --> 0:04:22,000
She's the most loving, compassionate, empathetic human being I know,

84
0:04:22.411,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and the reason I get to tell you all of this is because

85
0:04:25.061,000 --> 0:04:27,000
she's back in the Bronx with her mother.

86
0:04:27.187,000 --> 0:04:3,000
You see, this is co-parenting,

87
0:04:30.422,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and in an ideal world,

88
0:04:31.61,000 --> 0:04:33,000
my mother would have had a co-parent, too.

89
0:04:34.232,000 --> 0:04:35,000
She would have had support,

90
0:04:35.622,000 --> 0:04:37,000
someone to show up and give her a break, a time off.

91
0:04:38.171,000 --> 0:04:4,000
In an ideal world, every parent is a co-parent.

92
0:04:42.117,000 --> 0:04:45,000
In an ideal world, both parents share the weight of the work appropriately.

93
0:04:46.069,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Lilah's mother and I have a schedule.

94
0:04:47.833,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Some days, I leave work and pick Lilah up from school,

95
0:04:50.392,000 --> 0:04:51,000
some days I don't.

96
0:04:51.74,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Lilah's mother gets to go rock climbing

97
0:04:54.091,000 --> 0:04:56,000
or study for the LSAT,

98
0:04:56.473,000 --> 0:05:,000
and I get to stand in a room full of bold, dynamic and powerful women

99
0:05:00.892,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and talk about dad stuff.

100
0:05:03.949,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Applause)

101
0:05:09.294,000 --> 0:05:11,000
It is work, it is beautifully hard work

102
0:05:11.636,000 --> 0:05:13,000
dismantling the systems that would have us believe

103
0:05:14.432,000 --> 0:05:17,000
a woman's primary role is in the kitchen, tending to all things domestic,

104
0:05:17.984,000 --> 0:05:19,000
while the hapless dad fumbles all over himself

105
0:05:20.7,000 --> 0:05:22,000
whenever he has to spend a weekend alone with the kids.

106
0:05:24.304,000 --> 0:05:26,000
It is work that needs to happen right now.

107
0:05:27.211,000 --> 0:05:29,000
You see, far too often,

108
0:05:29.314,000 --> 0:05:31,000
what it seems like is when both parents are working,

109
0:05:31.839,000 --> 0:05:33,000
one parent is typically tasked with organizing the household

110
0:05:34.776,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and keeping the home running.

111
0:05:36.218,000 --> 0:05:39,000
That person is typically a woman or someone who identifies as such.

112
0:05:40.048,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Far too often, those who identify as mothers and as women

113
0:05:43.251,000 --> 0:05:46,000
have to sacrifice their dreams in order to appease the standard.

114
0:05:47.644,000 --> 0:05:48,000
They have to sacrifice their dreams

115
0:05:49.422,000 --> 0:05:53,000
in order to ensure that motherhood takes precedence over all else.

116
0:05:53.928,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And I'm not here to say that it doesn't, but what I am here to say is,

117
0:05:57.3,000 --> 0:06:01,000
as equal partners and co-parents, it is our duty to ensure

118
0:06:01.562,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that our co-parenting partners don't have to put their passions,

119
0:06:04.721,000 --> 0:06:05,000
their pursuits and their dreams

120
0:06:06.264,000 --> 0:06:07,000
to the back burner

121
0:06:07.454,000 --> 0:06:09,000
just because we're too self-absorbed to show up as allies.

122
0:06:10.376,000 --> 0:06:13,000
(Applause)

123
0:06:15.479,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Co-parenting makes the space possible for everybody.

124
0:06:18.695,000 --> 0:06:19,000
As a co-parent,

125
0:06:20.234,000 --> 0:06:22,000
the time I've gotten to share and spend with Lilah

126
0:06:22.589,000 --> 0:06:23,000
is time I appreciate,

127
0:06:23.938,000 --> 0:06:27,000
the time that has allowed me to be fully present for my child,

128
0:06:27.991,000 --> 0:06:3,000
removing the notion that the emotional labor required to raise a child

129
0:06:31.372,000 --> 0:06:32,000
is a woman's work.

130
0:06:33.196,000 --> 0:06:35,000
As a co-parent, Lilah and I have built snowmen,

131
0:06:35.804,000 --> 0:06:36,000
we've played with acorns,

132
0:06:37.304,000 --> 0:06:4,000
we've rapped to the soundtrack of "Moana," I know you have, too.

133
0:06:40.513,000 --> 0:06:41,000
(Laughter)

134
0:06:41.839,000 --> 0:06:44,000
She's sat with me while I've led workshops at Columbia University,

135
0:06:45.133,000 --> 0:06:48,000
when I talk about the intersections of poetry, hip-hop and theater.

136
0:06:48.392,000 --> 0:06:5,000
We get to talk about her emotions and her feelings

137
0:06:50.825,000 --> 0:06:51,000
because we have exclusive time together,

138
0:06:52.796,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and that time is planned time,

139
0:06:54.287,000 --> 0:06:57,000
it's organized around not just my schedule but her mother's.

140
0:06:57.452,000 --> 0:07:,000
Both of us, as co-parents, have unique parenting styles.

141
0:07:01.829,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And we may argue at times,

142
0:07:04.35,000 --> 0:07:08,000
but what we can always agree on is how to raise a human --

143
0:07:09.361,000 --> 0:07:1,000
our human.

144
0:07:13.074,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I will never fully understand or comprehend

145
0:07:16.579,000 --> 0:07:18,000
what it means to hold a child in my body for 10 months.

146
0:07:20.31,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I will never be able to understand

147
0:07:22.016,000 --> 0:07:24,000
the trials and tribulations of breastfeeding,

148
0:07:24.197,000 --> 0:07:25,000
the work that it takes,

149
0:07:25.7,000 --> 0:07:28,000
the emotional, physical, psychological and emotional toll

150
0:07:29.518,000 --> 0:07:31,000
that carrying a human can have on the female body.

151
0:07:33.507,000 --> 0:07:35,000
What co-parenting does is say,

152
0:07:35.952,000 --> 0:07:36,000
we can create balance,

153
0:07:37.261,000 --> 0:07:39,000
a more balanced home and work life for everyone involved.

154
0:07:40.18,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Co-parenting says that while parenting may involve sacrifices, yes,

155
0:07:43.769,000 --> 0:07:47,000
the weight of that sacrifice is not solely resting on one parent alone.

156
0:07:48.808,000 --> 0:07:49,000
No matter your relational dynamic,

157
0:07:50.501,000 --> 0:07:52,000
no matter how you identify as a human being --

158
0:07:52.714,000 --> 0:07:53,000
he, she, they, ze --

159
0:07:54.113,000 --> 0:07:57,000
co-parenting says we can create space and equity,

160
0:07:58.096,000 --> 0:08:,000
better communication, empathy, I hear you, I see you,

161
0:08:01.027,000 --> 0:08:03,000
how can I show up for you in ways that benefits our family?

162
0:08:05.443,000 --> 0:08:06,000
My goal:

163
0:08:07.881,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I want more fathers to embrace co-parenting as a model

164
0:08:12.1,000 --> 0:08:14,000
for a better tomorrow, a better today for ourselves,

165
0:08:14.808,000 --> 0:08:17,000
for our co-parenting partners, for our families, for our community.

166
0:08:18.015,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I want more fathers talking about fatherhood openly,

167
0:08:20.529,000 --> 0:08:22,000
candidly, honestly, lovingly.

168
0:08:22.756,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Right?

169
0:08:23.931,000 --> 0:08:26,000
I want more people to recognize that black fathers in particular

170
0:08:26.978,000 --> 0:08:28,000
are more than the court system, more than child support

171
0:08:29.616,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and more than what the media might portray us to be.

172
0:08:32.091,000 --> 0:08:34,000
(Applause)

173
0:08:36.843,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Our role as fathers, our role as parents,

174
0:08:38.978,000 --> 0:08:39,000
our value as parents

175
0:08:40.154,000 --> 0:08:42,000
is not dependent on the zeroes at the ends of our checks

176
0:08:42.906,000 --> 0:08:44,000
but the capacity within our hearts to show up for our families,

177
0:08:45.922,000 --> 0:08:47,000
for the people we love, for our little ones.

178
0:08:48.31,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Being a father is not only a responsibility, it's an opportunity.

179
0:08:52.563,000 --> 0:08:55,000
This is for Dwain, this is for Kareem "Buc" Drayton, this is for Biggs,

180
0:08:56.35,000 --> 0:08:58,000
this is for Boola, this is for Tyron,

181
0:08:58.843,000 --> 0:09:01,000
this is for all the black fathers who are showing up on a day-to-day basis.

182
0:09:02.456,000 --> 0:09:05,000
This is for Charles Lorenzo Daniels, my father, who didn't have the language

183
0:09:06.09,000 --> 0:09:08,000
or the tools to show up in the ways that he wanted to.

184
0:09:10.245,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Thank you.

185
0:09:11.865,000 --> 0:09:12,000
My name is Joel.

186
0:09:13.269,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Hi Bria, hi West.

187
0:09:16.397,000 --> 0:09:17,000
(In Yoruba) Amen.

188
0:09:18.014,000 --> 0:09:2,000
(Applause)

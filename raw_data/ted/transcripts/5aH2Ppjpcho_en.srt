2
0:00:12.944,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I want to talk a little bit today about labor and work.

3
0:00:18.5,000 --> 0:00:2,000
When we think about how people work,

4
0:00:21.246,000 --> 0:00:23,000
the naive intuition we have

5
0:00:23.639,000 --> 0:00:25,000
is that people are like rats in a maze --

6
0:00:26.027,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that all people care about is money,

7
0:00:28.02,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and the moment we give them money,

8
0:00:29.696,000 --> 0:00:3,000
we can direct them to work one way,

9
0:00:31.418,000 --> 0:00:32,000
we can direct them to work another way.

10
0:00:33.422,000 --> 0:00:36,000
This is why we give bonuses to bankers and pay in all kinds of ways.

11
0:00:37.057,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And we really have this incredibly simplistic view

12
0:00:40.549,000 --> 0:00:44,000
of why people work, and what the labor market looks like.

13
0:00:44.843,000 --> 0:00:46,000
At the same time, if you think about it,

14
0:00:47.19,000 --> 0:00:5,000
there's all kinds of strange behaviors in the world around us.

15
0:00:50.91,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Think about something like mountaineering and mountain climbing.

16
0:00:54.275,000 --> 0:00:58,000
If you read books of people who climb mountains, difficult mountains,

17
0:00:58.55,000 --> 0:01:02,000
do you think that those books are full of moments of joy and happiness?

18
0:01:03.699,000 --> 0:01:05,000
No, they are full of misery.

19
0:01:06.04,000 --> 0:01:09,000
In fact, it's all about frostbite and having difficulty walking,

20
0:01:09.722,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and difficulty breathing --

21
0:01:11.406,000 --> 0:01:14,000
cold, challenging circumstances.

22
0:01:14.468,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And if people were just trying to be happy,

23
0:01:16.946,000 --> 0:01:17,000
the moment they would get to the top,

24
0:01:18.827,000 --> 0:01:2,000
they would say, "This was a terrible mistake.

25
0:01:20.976,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I'll never do it again."

26
0:01:22.381,000 --> 0:01:23,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:23.522,000 --> 0:01:26,000
"Instead, let me sit on a beach somewhere drinking mojitos."

28
0:01:27.161,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But instead, people go down,

29
0:01:30.859,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and after they recover, they go up again.

30
0:01:33.756,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And if you think about mountain climbing as an example,

31
0:01:36.85,000 --> 0:01:38,000
it suggests all kinds of things.

32
0:01:39.206,000 --> 0:01:42,000
It suggests that we care about reaching the end, a peak.

33
0:01:43.135,000 --> 0:01:46,000
It suggests that we care about the fight, about the challenge.

34
0:01:46.666,000 --> 0:01:49,000
It suggests that there's all kinds of other things that motivate us

35
0:01:50.15,000 --> 0:01:53,000
to work or behave in all kinds of ways.

36
0:01:54.322,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And for me personally, I started thinking about this

37
0:01:56.821,000 --> 0:01:58,000
after a student came to visit me.

38
0:02:00.085,000 --> 0:02:03,000
This was one of my students from a few years earlier,

39
0:02:04.014,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and he came one day back to campus.

40
0:02:06.204,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And he told me the following story:

41
0:02:08.359,000 --> 0:02:1,000
He said that for more than two weeks,

42
0:02:10.805,000 --> 0:02:12,000
he was working on a PowerPoint presentation.

43
0:02:13.85,000 --> 0:02:14,000
He was working in a big bank,

44
0:02:15.62,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and this was in preparation for a merger and acquisition.

45
0:02:19.43,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And he was working very hard on this presentation --

46
0:02:21.945,000 --> 0:02:22,000
graphs, tables, information.

47
0:02:23.954,000 --> 0:02:25,000
He stayed late at night every day.

48
0:02:27.464,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And the day before it was due,

49
0:02:29.678,000 --> 0:02:32,000
he sent his PowerPoint presentation to his boss,

50
0:02:33.012,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and his boss wrote him back and said,

51
0:02:35.642,000 --> 0:02:38,000
"Nice presentation, but the merger is canceled."

52
0:02:40.34,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And the guy was deeply depressed.

53
0:02:42.475,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Now at the moment when he was working,

54
0:02:44.659,000 --> 0:02:45,000
he was actually quite happy.

55
0:02:46.543,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Every night he was enjoying his work,

56
0:02:48.822,000 --> 0:02:52,000
he was staying late, he was perfecting this PowerPoint presentation.

57
0:02:53.52,000 --> 0:02:57,000
But knowing that nobody would ever watch it made him quite depressed.

58
0:02:58.779,000 --> 0:03:,000
So I started thinking about how do we experiment

59
0:03:01.327,000 --> 0:03:04,000
with this idea of the fruits of our labor.

60
0:03:05.366,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And to start with, we created a little experiment

61
0:03:09.588,000 --> 0:03:12,000
in which we gave people Legos,

62
0:03:12.618,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and we asked them to build with Legos.

63
0:03:15.96,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And for some people, we gave them Legos and we said,

64
0:03:19.501,000 --> 0:03:23,000
"Hey, would you like to build this Bionicle for three dollars?

65
0:03:24.27,000 --> 0:03:26,000
We'll pay you three dollars for it."

66
0:03:26.344,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And people said yes, and they built with these Legos.

67
0:03:29.872,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And when they finished, we took it, we put it under the table,

68
0:03:33.462,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and we said, "Would you like to build another one,

69
0:03:36.471,000 --> 0:03:37,000
this time for $2.70?"

70
0:03:38.471,000 --> 0:03:4,000
If they said yes, we gave them another one,

71
0:03:40.512,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and when they finished, we asked them,

72
0:03:42.393,000 --> 0:03:45,000
"Do you want to build another one?" for $2.40, $2.10, and so on,

73
0:03:46.237,000 --> 0:03:47,000
until at some point people said,

74
0:03:48.111,000 --> 0:03:5,000
"No more. It's not worth it for me."

75
0:03:52.102,000 --> 0:03:54,000
This was what we called the meaningful condition.

76
0:03:54.778,000 --> 0:03:57,000
People built one Bionicle after another.

77
0:03:57.829,000 --> 0:03:58,000
After they finished every one of them,

78
0:03:59.679,000 --> 0:04:,000
we put them under the table.

79
0:04:01.048,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And we told them that at the end of the experiment,

80
0:04:03.456,000 --> 0:04:06,000
we will take all these Bionicles, we will disassemble them,

81
0:04:06.556,000 --> 0:04:07,000
we will put them back in the boxes,

82
0:04:08.403,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and we will use it for the next participant.

83
0:04:11.727,000 --> 0:04:12,000
There was another condition.

84
0:04:13.282,000 --> 0:04:17,000
This other condition was inspired by David, my student.

85
0:04:17.814,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And this other condition we called the Sisyphic condition.

86
0:04:21.266,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And if you remember the story about Sisyphus,

87
0:04:23.475,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Sisyphus was punished by the gods to push the same rock up a hill,

88
0:04:28.726,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and when he almost got to the end,

89
0:04:30.811,000 --> 0:04:32,000
the rock would roll over, and he would have to start again.

90
0:04:33.795,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And you can think about this as the essence of doing futile work.

91
0:04:38.691,000 --> 0:04:4,000
You can imagine that if he pushed the rock on different hills,

92
0:04:41.668,000 --> 0:04:43,000
at least he would have some sense of progress.

93
0:04:44.316,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Also, if you look at prison movies,

94
0:04:47.024,000 --> 0:04:5,000
sometimes the way that the guards torture the prisoners

95
0:04:50.207,000 --> 0:04:53,000
is to get them to dig a hole, and when the prisoner is finished,

96
0:04:53.866,000 --> 0:04:55,000
they ask him to fill the hole back up and then dig again.

97
0:04:56.889,000 --> 0:04:58,000
There's something about this cyclical version

98
0:04:59.095,000 --> 0:05:01,000
of doing something over and over and over

99
0:05:01.734,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that seems to be particularly demotivating.

100
0:05:04.575,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So in the second condition of this experiment,

101
0:05:06.806,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that's exactly what we did.

102
0:05:08.496,000 --> 0:05:09,000
We asked people,

103
0:05:09.807,000 --> 0:05:12,000
"Would you like to build one Bionicle for three dollars?"

104
0:05:12.99,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And if they said yes, they built it.

105
0:05:15.309,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Then we asked them, "Do you want to build another one for $2.70?"

106
0:05:18.738,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And if they said yes, we gave them a new one,

107
0:05:21.906,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and as they were building it,

108
0:05:23.715,000 --> 0:05:25,000
we took apart the one that they just finished.

109
0:05:27.515,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And when they finished that,

110
0:05:29.136,000 --> 0:05:31,000
we said, "Would you like to build another one,

111
0:05:31.332,000 --> 0:05:32,000
this time for 30 cents less?"

112
0:05:32.878,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And if they said yes,

113
0:05:34.101,000 --> 0:05:37,000
we gave them the one that they built and we broke.

114
0:05:37.276,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So this was an endless cycle of them building,

115
0:05:40.887,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and us destroying in front of their eyes.

116
0:05:44.643,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Now what happens when you compare these two conditions?

117
0:05:48.343,000 --> 0:05:51,000
The first thing that happened was that people built many more Bionicles --

118
0:05:51.898,000 --> 0:05:53,000
eleven in the meaningful condition,

119
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
versus seven in the Sisyphus condition.

120
0:05:56.922,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And by the way, we should point out that this was not big meaning.

121
0:06:00.059,000 --> 0:06:02,000
People were not curing cancer or building bridges.

122
0:06:02.62,000 --> 0:06:05,000
People were building Bionicles for a few cents.

123
0:06:06.383,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And not only that, everybody knew

124
0:06:08.36,000 --> 0:06:11,000
that the Bionicles would be destroyed quite soon.

125
0:06:11.686,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So there was not a real opportunity for big meaning.

126
0:06:14.541,000 --> 0:06:17,000
But even the small meaning made a difference.

127
0:06:18.471,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Now we had another version of this experiment.

128
0:06:20.813,000 --> 0:06:21,000
In this other version of the experiment,

129
0:06:22.752,000 --> 0:06:23,000
we didn't put people in this situation,

130
0:06:24.719,000 --> 0:06:26,000
we just described to them the situation,

131
0:06:26.749,000 --> 0:06:28,000
much as I am describing to you now,

132
0:06:28.879,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and we asked them to predict what the result would be.

133
0:06:32.258,000 --> 0:06:33,000
What happened?

134
0:06:33.441,000 --> 0:06:36,000
People predicted the right direction but not the right magnitude.

135
0:06:37.491,000 --> 0:06:4,000
People who were just given the description of the experiment

136
0:06:41.198,000 --> 0:06:42,000
said that in the meaningful condition,

137
0:06:43.11,000 --> 0:06:45,000
people would probably build one more Bionicle.

138
0:06:45.792,000 --> 0:06:47,000
So people understand that meaning is important,

139
0:06:48.045,000 --> 0:06:5,000
they just don't understand the magnitude of the importance,

140
0:06:50.903,000 --> 0:06:51,000
the extent to which it's important.

141
0:06:53.657,000 --> 0:06:55,000
There was one other piece of data we looked at.

142
0:06:56.474,000 --> 0:06:58,000
If you think about it, there are some people who love Legos,

143
0:06:59.355,000 --> 0:07:,000
and some people who don't.

144
0:07:00.841,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And you would speculate that the people who love Legos

145
0:07:03.428,000 --> 0:07:05,000
would build more Legos, even for less money,

146
0:07:05.544,000 --> 0:07:08,000
because after all, they get more internal joy from it.

147
0:07:08.765,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And the people who love Legos less would build less Legos

148
0:07:11.885,000 --> 0:07:13,000
because the enjoyment that they derive from it is lower.

149
0:07:14.813,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And that's actually what we found in the meaningful condition.

150
0:07:17.765,000 --> 0:07:19,000
There was a very nice correlation between the love of Legos

151
0:07:20.598,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and the amount of Legos people built.

152
0:07:23.012,000 --> 0:07:25,000
What happened in the Sisyphic condition?

153
0:07:25.679,000 --> 0:07:27,000
In that condition, the correlation was zero --

154
0:07:28.314,000 --> 0:07:3,000
there was no relationship between the love of Legos,

155
0:07:31.059,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and how much people built,

156
0:07:32.846,000 --> 0:07:34,000
which suggests to me that with this manipulation

157
0:07:35.545,000 --> 0:07:37,000
of breaking things in front of people's eyes,

158
0:07:38.007,000 --> 0:07:42,000
we basically crushed any joy that they could get out of this activity.

159
0:07:42.58,000 --> 0:07:43,000
We basically eliminated it.

160
0:07:45.833,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Soon after I finished running this experiment,

161
0:07:49.078,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I went to talk to a big software company in Seattle.

162
0:07:53.392,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I can't tell you who they were, but they were a big company in Seattle.

163
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
This was a group within the software company

164
0:07:59.372,000 --> 0:08:,000
that was put in a different building,

165
0:08:01.188,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and they asked them to innovate,

166
0:08:02.832,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and create the next big product for this company.

167
0:08:06.59,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And the week before I showed up,

168
0:08:08.143,000 --> 0:08:12,000
the CEO of this big software company went to that group, 200 engineers,

169
0:08:12.574,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and canceled the project.

170
0:08:15.311,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And I stood there in front of 200

171
0:08:17.365,000 --> 0:08:2,000
of the most depressed people I've ever talked to.

172
0:08:21.014,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And I described to them some of these Lego experiments,

173
0:08:23.661,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and they said they felt like they had just been through that experiment.

174
0:08:29.053,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And I asked them, I said,

175
0:08:30.3,000 --> 0:08:33,000
"How many of you now show up to work later than you used to?"

176
0:08:33.916,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And everybody raised their hand.

177
0:08:35.894,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I said, "How many of you now go home earlier than you used to?"

178
0:08:39.093,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Everybody raised their hand.

179
0:08:41.006,000 --> 0:08:43,000
I asked them, "How many of you now add

180
0:08:43.709,000 --> 0:08:46,000
not-so-kosher things to your expense reports?"

181
0:08:46.866,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And they didn't raise their hands,

182
0:08:48.541,000 --> 0:08:49,000
but they took me out to dinner

183
0:08:50.01,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and showed me what they could do with expense reports.

184
0:08:54.58,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And then I asked them, I said,

185
0:08:56.056,000 --> 0:09:,000
"What could the CEO have done to make you not as depressed?"

186
0:09:00.421,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And they came up with all kinds of ideas.

187
0:09:02.548,000 --> 0:09:05,000
They said the CEO could have asked them to present to the whole company

188
0:09:05.953,000 --> 0:09:07,000
about their journey over the last two years

189
0:09:07.98,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and what they decided to do.

190
0:09:09.406,000 --> 0:09:12,000
He could have asked them to think about which aspect of their technology

191
0:09:13.19,000 --> 0:09:16,000
could fit with other parts of the organization.

192
0:09:16.536,000 --> 0:09:19,000
He could have asked them to build some next-generation prototypes,

193
0:09:19.878,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and see how they would work.

194
0:09:21.903,000 --> 0:09:25,000
But the thing is that any one of those would require some effort and motivation.

195
0:09:26.912,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And I think the CEO basically did not understand the importance of meaning.

196
0:09:31.116,000 --> 0:09:33,000
If the CEO, just like our participants,

197
0:09:33.338,000 --> 0:09:35,000
thought the essence of meaning is unimportant,

198
0:09:36.323,000 --> 0:09:37,000
then he [wouldn't] care.

199
0:09:37.561,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And he would say, "At the moment I directed you in this way,

200
0:09:40.484,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and now that I'm directing you in this way,

201
0:09:42.531,000 --> 0:09:43,000
everything will be okay."

202
0:09:44.077,000 --> 0:09:46,000
But if you understood how important meaning is,

203
0:09:46.776,000 --> 0:09:48,000
then you would figure out that it's actually important

204
0:09:49.378,000 --> 0:09:5,000
to spend some time, energy and effort

205
0:09:51.196,000 --> 0:09:53,000
in getting people to care more about what they're doing.

206
0:09:55.322,000 --> 0:09:57,000
The next experiment was slightly different.

207
0:09:57.457,000 --> 0:09:59,000
We took a sheet of paper with random letters,

208
0:10:00.116,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and we asked people to find pairs of letters

209
0:10:02.227,000 --> 0:10:04,000
that were identical next to each other.

210
0:10:04.282,000 --> 0:10:05,000
That was the task.

211
0:10:05.466,000 --> 0:10:06,000
People did the first sheet,

212
0:10:06.894,000 --> 0:10:09,000
then we asked if they wanted to do another for a little less money,

213
0:10:10.263,000 --> 0:10:12,000
the next sheet for a little bit less, and so on and so forth.

214
0:10:13.163,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And we had three conditions.

215
0:10:14.747,000 --> 0:10:17,000
In the first condition, people wrote their name on the sheet,

216
0:10:18.351,000 --> 0:10:2,000
found all the pairs of letters,

217
0:10:20.665,000 --> 0:10:21,000
gave it to the experimenter,

218
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
the experimenter would look at it,

219
0:10:24.237,000 --> 0:10:25,000
scan it from top to bottom,

220
0:10:25.996,000 --> 0:10:28,000
say "Uh huh," and put it on the pile next to them.

221
0:10:30.68,000 --> 0:10:33,000
In the second condition, people did not write their name on it.

222
0:10:33.99,000 --> 0:10:35,000
The experimenter looked at it,

223
0:10:36.379,000 --> 0:10:38,000
took the sheet of paper, did not look at it, did not scan it,

224
0:10:39.346,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and simply put it on the pile of pages.

225
0:10:42.974,000 --> 0:10:44,000
So you take a piece, you just put it on the side.

226
0:10:45.534,000 --> 0:10:46,000
In the third condition,

227
0:10:46.883,000 --> 0:10:48,000
the experimenter got the sheet of paper,

228
0:10:49.25,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and put it directly into a shredder.

229
0:10:51.756,000 --> 0:10:53,000
(Laughter)

230
0:10:55.177,000 --> 0:10:57,000
What happened in those three conditions?

231
0:10:57.994,000 --> 0:11:01,000
In this plot I'm showing you at what pay rate people stopped.

232
0:11:02.22,000 --> 0:11:04,000
So low numbers mean that people worked harder.

233
0:11:04.826,000 --> 0:11:06,000
They worked for much longer.

234
0:11:06.952,000 --> 0:11:07,000
In the acknowledged condition,

235
0:11:08.53,000 --> 0:11:11,000
people worked all the way down to 15 cents.

236
0:11:11.654,000 --> 0:11:12,000
At 15 cents per page,

237
0:11:13.295,000 --> 0:11:14,000
they basically stopped these efforts.

238
0:11:15.642,000 --> 0:11:19,000
In the shredder condition, it was twice as much -- 30 cents per sheet.

239
0:11:20.153,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And this is basically the result we had before.

240
0:11:22.416,000 --> 0:11:25,000
You shred people's efforts, output --

241
0:11:25.804,000 --> 0:11:27,000
you get them not to be as happy with what they're doing.

242
0:11:28.488,000 --> 0:11:29,000
But I should point out, by the way,

243
0:11:30.216,000 --> 0:11:32,000
that in the shredder condition, people could have cheated.

244
0:11:32.97,000 --> 0:11:34,000
They could have done not so good work,

245
0:11:34.999,000 --> 0:11:36,000
because they realized people were just shredding it.

246
0:11:37.522,000 --> 0:11:39,000
So maybe the first sheet you'd do good work,

247
0:11:39.633,000 --> 0:11:41,000
but then you see nobody is really testing it,

248
0:11:41.792,000 --> 0:11:42,000
so you would do more and more and more.

249
0:11:43.729,000 --> 0:11:44,000
So in fact, in the shredder condition,

250
0:11:45.593,000 --> 0:11:47,000
people could have submitted more work and gotten more money,

251
0:11:48.451,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and put less effort into it.

252
0:11:50.471,000 --> 0:11:51,000
But what about the ignored condition?

253
0:11:52.44,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Would the ignored condition be more like the acknowledged

254
0:11:55.194,000 --> 0:11:57,000
or more like the shredder, or somewhere in the middle?

255
0:11:58.137,000 --> 0:12:,000
It turns out it was almost like the shredder.

256
0:12:01.473,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Now there's good news and bad news here.

257
0:12:04.917,000 --> 0:12:08,000
The bad news is that ignoring the performance of people

258
0:12:09.004,000 --> 0:12:13,000
is almost as bad as shredding their effort in front of their eyes.

259
0:12:13.3,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Ignoring gets you a whole way out there.

260
0:12:17.213,000 --> 0:12:21,000
The good news is that by simply looking at something that somebody has done,

261
0:12:21.546,000 --> 0:12:22,000
scanning it and saying "Uh huh,"

262
0:12:23.563,000 --> 0:12:24,000
that seems to be quite sufficient

263
0:12:25.173,000 --> 0:12:27,000
to dramatically improve people's motivations.

264
0:12:28.585,000 --> 0:12:3,000
So the good news is that adding motivation

265
0:12:31.389,000 --> 0:12:33,000
doesn't seem to be so difficult.

266
0:12:33.912,000 --> 0:12:35,000
The bad news is that eliminating motivations

267
0:12:36.09,000 --> 0:12:37,000
seems to be incredibly easy,

268
0:12:37.865,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and if we don't think about it carefully, we might overdo it.

269
0:12:41.681,000 --> 0:12:44,000
So this is all in terms of negative motivation,

270
0:12:45.116,000 --> 0:12:47,000
or eliminating negative motivation.

271
0:12:48.426,000 --> 0:12:51,000
The next part I want to show you is something about positive motivation.

272
0:12:52.473,000 --> 0:12:55,000
So there is a store in the U.S. called IKEA.

273
0:12:56.97,000 --> 0:13:,000
And IKEA is a store with kind of okay furniture

274
0:13:01.199,000 --> 0:13:02,000
that takes a long time to assemble.

275
0:13:03.667,000 --> 0:13:04,000
(Laughter)

276
0:13:05.714,000 --> 0:13:06,000
I don't know about you,

277
0:13:06.89,000 --> 0:13:07,000
but every time I assemble one of those,

278
0:13:08.787,000 --> 0:13:1,000
it takes me much longer, it's much more effortful,

279
0:13:11.152,000 --> 0:13:14,000
it's much more confusing, I put things in the wrong way --

280
0:13:15.186,000 --> 0:13:17,000
I can't say I enjoy those pieces.

281
0:13:18.175,000 --> 0:13:2,000
I can't say I enjoy the process.

282
0:13:21.04,000 --> 0:13:22,000
But when I finish it,

283
0:13:22.7,000 --> 0:13:24,000
I seem to like those IKEA pieces of furniture

284
0:13:24.842,000 --> 0:13:25,000
more than I like other ones.

285
0:13:26.718,000 --> 0:13:27,000
(Laughter)

286
0:13:27.798,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And there's an old story about cake mixes.

287
0:13:31.758,000 --> 0:13:34,000
So when they started cake mixes in the '40s,

288
0:13:35.009,000 --> 0:13:38,000
they would take this powder and they would put it in a box,

289
0:13:38.489,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and they would ask housewives to basically pour it in,

290
0:13:41.554,000 --> 0:13:42,000
stir some water in it,

291
0:13:43.3,000 --> 0:13:47,000
mix it, put it in the oven, and -- voila -- you had cake.

292
0:13:47.586,000 --> 0:13:49,000
But it turns out they were very unpopular.

293
0:13:49.639,000 --> 0:13:5,000
People did not want them,

294
0:13:51.474,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and they thought about all kinds of reasons for that.

295
0:13:54.023,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Maybe the taste was not good?

296
0:13:55.456,000 --> 0:13:56,000
No, the taste was great.

297
0:13:56.656,000 --> 0:14:01,000
What they figured out was that there was not enough effort involved.

298
0:14:01.68,000 --> 0:14:04,000
It was so easy that nobody could serve cake to their guests

299
0:14:05.081,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and say, "Here is my cake."

300
0:14:07.389,000 --> 0:14:1,000
No, it was somebody else's cake, as if you bought it in the store.

301
0:14:10.989,000 --> 0:14:12,000
It didn't really feel like your own.

302
0:14:13.574,000 --> 0:14:14,000
So what did they do?

303
0:14:15.043,000 --> 0:14:18,000
They took the eggs and the milk out of the powder.

304
0:14:18.313,000 --> 0:14:19,000
(Laughter)

305
0:14:20.063,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Now you had to break the eggs and add them,

306
0:14:23.904,000 --> 0:14:26,000
you had to measure the milk and add it, mixing it.

307
0:14:27.084,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Now it was your cake. Now everything was fine.

308
0:14:29.941,000 --> 0:14:31,000
(Laughter)

309
0:14:32.329,000 --> 0:14:38,000
(Applause)

310
0:14:39.904,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Now, I think a little bit like the IKEA effect,

311
0:14:42.157,000 --> 0:14:43,000
by getting people to work harder,

312
0:14:43.809,000 --> 0:14:45,000
they actually got them to love what they're doing

313
0:14:46.246,000 --> 0:14:47,000
to a higher degree.

314
0:14:48.15,000 --> 0:14:5,000
So how do we look at this question experimentally?

315
0:14:51.046,000 --> 0:14:53,000
We asked people to build some origami.

316
0:14:53.223,000 --> 0:14:55,000
We gave them instructions on how to create origami,

317
0:14:56,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and we gave them a sheet of paper.

318
0:14:57.762,000 --> 0:14:58,000
And these were all novices,

319
0:14:59.604,000 --> 0:15:01,000
and they built something that was really quite ugly --

320
0:15:02.182,000 --> 0:15:04,000
nothing like a frog or a crane.

321
0:15:05.086,000 --> 0:15:08,000
But then we told them, "Look, this origami really belongs to us.

322
0:15:08.151,000 --> 0:15:11,000
You worked for us, but I'll tell you what, we'll sell it to you.

323
0:15:11.199,000 --> 0:15:13,000
How much do you want to pay for it?"

324
0:15:13.61,000 --> 0:15:15,000
And we measured how much they were willing to pay for it.

325
0:15:16.31,000 --> 0:15:17,000
And we had two types of people:

326
0:15:18.142,000 --> 0:15:19,000
We had the people who built it,

327
0:15:20.11,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and the people who did not build it,

328
0:15:21.913,000 --> 0:15:23,000
and just looked at it as external observers.

329
0:15:25.173,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And what we found was that the builders thought

330
0:15:27.428,000 --> 0:15:29,000
that these were beautiful pieces of origami --

331
0:15:30.08,000 --> 0:15:31,000
(Laughter)

332
0:15:31.366,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and they were willing to pay five times more for them

333
0:15:33.881,000 --> 0:15:35,000
than the people who just evaluated them externally.

334
0:15:36.89,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Now you could say -- if you were a builder,

335
0:15:39.942,000 --> 0:15:42,000
do you think [you'd say], "Oh, I love this origami,

336
0:15:43.134,000 --> 0:15:45,000
but I know that nobody else would love it?"

337
0:15:46.474,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Or "I love this origami, and everybody else will love it as well?"

338
0:15:51.892,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Which one of those two is correct?

339
0:15:54.297,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Turns out the builders not only loved the origami more,

340
0:15:57.773,000 --> 0:16:,000
they thought that everybody would see the world in their view.

341
0:16:01.101,000 --> 0:16:03,000
They thought everybody else would love it more as well.

342
0:16:04.451,000 --> 0:16:06,000
In the next version, we tried to do the IKEA effect.

343
0:16:06.913,000 --> 0:16:07,000
We tried to make it more difficult.

344
0:16:09.126,000 --> 0:16:11,000
So for some people, we gave the same task.

345
0:16:11.778,000 --> 0:16:14,000
For some people, we made it harder by hiding the instructions.

346
0:16:16.001,000 --> 0:16:18,000
At the top of the sheet, we had little diagrams

347
0:16:18.407,000 --> 0:16:19,000
of how you fold origami.

348
0:16:20.39,000 --> 0:16:22,000
For some people, we just eliminated that.

349
0:16:23.151,000 --> 0:16:24,000
So now this was tougher.

350
0:16:24.867,000 --> 0:16:25,000
What happened?

351
0:16:26.048,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Well in an objective way,

352
0:16:28.119,000 --> 0:16:31,000
the origami now was uglier, it was more difficult.

353
0:16:32.064,000 --> 0:16:35,000
Now when we looked at the easy origami, we saw the same thing --

354
0:16:35.095,000 --> 0:16:38,000
builders loved it more, evaluators loved it less.

355
0:16:38.341,000 --> 0:16:4,000
When you looked at the hard instructions,

356
0:16:40.524,000 --> 0:16:42,000
the effect was larger.

357
0:16:43.246,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Why?

358
0:16:44.422,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Because now the builders loved it even more.

359
0:16:47.516,000 --> 0:16:48,000
(Laughter)

360
0:16:48.746,000 --> 0:16:5,000
They put all this extra effort into it.

361
0:16:51.352,000 --> 0:16:52,000
And evaluators?

362
0:16:53.212,000 --> 0:16:54,000
They loved it even less.

363
0:16:54.863,000 --> 0:16:57,000
Because in reality, it was even uglier than the first version.

364
0:16:58.736,000 --> 0:16:59,000
(Laughter)

365
0:17:00.101,000 --> 0:17:03,000
Of course, this tells you something about how we evaluate things.

366
0:17:04.835,000 --> 0:17:05,000
Now think about kids.

367
0:17:07.216,000 --> 0:17:1,000
Imagine I asked you, "How much would you sell your kids for?"

368
0:17:11.748,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Your memories and associations and so on.

369
0:17:13.78,000 --> 0:17:15,000
Most people would say for a lot, a lot of money.

370
0:17:16.443,000 --> 0:17:17,000
(Laughter)

371
0:17:17.631,000 --> 0:17:18,000
On good days.

372
0:17:19.039,000 --> 0:17:2,000
(Laughter)

373
0:17:20.303,000 --> 0:17:21,000
But imagine this was slightly different.

374
0:17:22.232,000 --> 0:17:23,000
Imagine if you did not have your kids.

375
0:17:24.066,000 --> 0:17:26,000
And one day you went to the park and you met some kids.

376
0:17:26.825,000 --> 0:17:27,000
They were just like your kids,

377
0:17:28.331,000 --> 0:17:3,000
and you played with them for a few hours,

378
0:17:30.373,000 --> 0:17:33,000
and when you were about to leave, the parents said, "Hey, by the way,

379
0:17:33.746,000 --> 0:17:35,000
just before you leave, if you're interested, they're for sale."

380
0:17:36.753,000 --> 0:17:38,000
(Laughter)

381
0:17:38.883,000 --> 0:17:4,000
How much would you pay for them now?

382
0:17:41.803,000 --> 0:17:43,000
Most people say not that much.

383
0:17:44.549,000 --> 0:17:48,000
And this is because our kids are so valuable,

384
0:17:48.743,000 --> 0:17:5,000
not just because of who they are,

385
0:17:50.897,000 --> 0:17:51,000
but because of us,

386
0:17:52.532,000 --> 0:17:54,000
because they are so connected to us,

387
0:17:54.716,000 --> 0:17:56,000
and because of the time and connection.

388
0:17:57.311,000 --> 0:17:59,000
By the way, if you think IKEA instructions are not good,

389
0:18:00.242,000 --> 0:18:03,000
what about the instructions that come with kids, those are really tough.

390
0:18:03.654,000 --> 0:18:04,000
(Laughter)

391
0:18:04.686,000 --> 0:18:08,000
By the way, these are my kids, which, of course, are wonderful and so on.

392
0:18:08.952,000 --> 0:18:09,000
Which comes to tell you one more thing,

393
0:18:10.9,000 --> 0:18:12,000
which is, much like our builders,

394
0:18:13.374,000 --> 0:18:16,000
when they look at the creature of their creation,

395
0:18:17.239,000 --> 0:18:2,000
we don't see that other people don't see things our way.

396
0:18:22.463,000 --> 0:18:23,000
Let me say one last comment.

397
0:18:25.162,000 --> 0:18:28,000
If you think about Adam Smith versus Karl Marx,

398
0:18:28.979,000 --> 0:18:31,000
Adam Smith had a very important notion of efficiency.

399
0:18:32.75,000 --> 0:18:34,000
He gave an example of a pin factory.

400
0:18:35.464,000 --> 0:18:37,000
He said pins have 12 different steps,

401
0:18:38.445,000 --> 0:18:41,000
and if one person does all 12 steps, production is very low.

402
0:18:42.818,000 --> 0:18:44,000
But if you get one person to do step one,

403
0:18:44.97,000 --> 0:18:46,000
and one person to do step two and step three and so on,

404
0:18:47.747,000 --> 0:18:49,000
production can increase tremendously.

405
0:18:50.382,000 --> 0:18:51,000
And indeed, this is a great example,

406
0:18:52.145,000 --> 0:18:55,000
and the reason for the Industrial Revolution and efficiency.

407
0:18:56.27,000 --> 0:18:57,000
Karl Marx, on the other hand,

408
0:18:57.88,000 --> 0:19:,000
said that the alienation of labor is incredibly important

409
0:19:01.365,000 --> 0:19:04,000
in how people think about the connection to what they are doing.

410
0:19:04.785,000 --> 0:19:07,000
And if you do all 12 steps, you care about the pin.

411
0:19:08.079,000 --> 0:19:11,000
But if you do one step every time, maybe you don't care as much.

412
0:19:12.568,000 --> 0:19:14,000
I think that in the Industrial Revolution,

413
0:19:15.377,000 --> 0:19:17,000
Adam Smith was more correct than Karl Marx.

414
0:19:18.488,000 --> 0:19:2,000
But the reality is that we've switched,

415
0:19:21.347,000 --> 0:19:23,000
and now we're in the knowledge economy.

416
0:19:23.379,000 --> 0:19:25,000
You can ask yourself, what happens in a knowledge economy?

417
0:19:26.29,000 --> 0:19:29,000
Is efficiency still more important than meaning?

418
0:19:29.561,000 --> 0:19:3,000
I think the answer is no.

419
0:19:30.995,000 --> 0:19:32,000
I think that as we move to situations

420
0:19:33.213,000 --> 0:19:35,000
in which people have to decide on their own

421
0:19:36.196,000 --> 0:19:4,000
about how much effort, attention, caring, how connected they feel to it,

422
0:19:40.39,000 --> 0:19:42,000
are they thinking about labor on the way to work,

423
0:19:42.789,000 --> 0:19:43,000
and in the shower and so on,

424
0:19:44.39,000 --> 0:19:47,000
all of a sudden Marx has more things to say to us.

425
0:19:48.843,000 --> 0:19:49,000
So when we think about labor,

426
0:19:50.273,000 --> 0:19:53,000
we usually think about motivation and payment as the same thing,

427
0:19:53.697,000 --> 0:19:56,000
but the reality is that we should probably add all kinds of things to it --

428
0:19:57.323,000 --> 0:20:01,000
meaning, creation, challenges, ownership, identity, pride, etc.

429
0:20:01.823,000 --> 0:20:03,000
The good news is that if we added all of those components

430
0:20:04.53,000 --> 0:20:05,000
and thought about them --

431
0:20:06.132,000 --> 0:20:09,000
how do we create our own meaning, pride, motivation,

432
0:20:09.569,000 --> 0:20:1,000
and how do we do it in our workplace,

433
0:20:11.443,000 --> 0:20:12,000
and for the employees --

434
0:20:12.865,000 --> 0:20:15,000
I think we could get people to be both more productive and happier.

435
0:20:16.854,000 --> 0:20:17,000
Thank you very much.

436
0:20:18.184,000 --> 0:20:19,000
(Applause)

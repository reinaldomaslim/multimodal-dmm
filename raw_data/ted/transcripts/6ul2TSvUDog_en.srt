1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm going to tell you two things today:

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
One is what we have lost,

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and two, a way to bring it back.

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And let me start with this.

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
This is my baseline:

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
This is the Mediterranean coast

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
with no fish, bare rock

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Something like this is what I first saw

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
when I jumped in the water for the first time

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
in the Mediterranean coast off Spain.

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Now, if an alien came to earth --

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
let's call him Joe --

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
what would Joe see?

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
If Joe jumped in a coral reef,

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
there are many things the alien could see.

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Very unlikely, Joe would jump

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
on a pristine coral reef,

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
a virgin coral reef with lots of coral, sharks, crocodiles,

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
manatees, groupers,

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
turtles, etc.

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So, probably, what Joe would see

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
would be in this part, in the greenish part of the picture.

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Here we have the extreme with dead corals,

25
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
microbial soup and jellyfish.

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And where the diver is,

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
this is probably where most of the reefs of the world are now,

28
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
with very few corals, algae overgrowing the corals,

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
lots of bacteria,

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and where the large animals are gone.

31
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And this is what most marine scientists have seen too.

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
This is their baseline. This is what they think is natural

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
because we started modern science

34
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
with scuba diving long after

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
we started degrading marine ecosystems.

36
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
So I'm going to get us all on a time machine,

37
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and we're going to the left; we're going to go back to the past

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
to see what the ocean was like.

39
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And let's start with this time machine, the Line Islands,

40
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
where we have conducted a series

41
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
of National Geographic expeditions.

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
This sea is an archipelago belonging to Kiribati

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
that spans across the equator

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and it has several uninhabited,

45
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
unfished, pristine islands

46
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and a few inhabited islands.

47
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So let's start with the first one: Christmas Island, over 5,000 people.

48
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Most of the reefs are dead,

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
most of the corals are dead -- overgrown by algae --

50
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and most of the fish are smaller than

51
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
the pencils we use to count them.

52
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
We did 250 hours of diving here

53
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
in 2005.

54
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
We didn't see a single shark.

55
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
This is the place that Captain Cook discovered in 1777

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and he described a huge abundance of sharks

57
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
biting the rudders and the oars of their small boats

58
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
while they were going ashore.

59
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Let's move the dial a little bit to the past.

60
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Fanning Island, 2,500 people.

61
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
The corals are doing better here. Lots of small fish.

62
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
This is what many divers would consider paradise.

63
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
This is where you can see most

64
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.

65
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And many people think this is really, really beautiful,

66
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
if this is your baseline.

67
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
If we go back to a place

68
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
like Palmyra Atoll,

69
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
where I was with Jeremy Jackson a few years ago,

70
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
the corals are doing better and there are sharks.

71
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
You can see sharks in every single dive.

72
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And this is something that is very unusual in today's coral reefs.

73
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
But then, if we shift the dial

74
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
200, 500 years back,

75
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
then we get to the places where the corals

76
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
are absolutely healthy and gorgeous,

77
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
forming spectacular structures,

78
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and where the predators

79
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
are the most conspicuous thing,

80
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
where you see between 25 and 50 sharks per dive.

81
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
What have we learned from these places?

82
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
This is what we thought was natural.

83
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
This is what we call the biomass pyramid.

84
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
If we get all of the fish of a coral reef together and weigh them,

85
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
this is what we would expect.

86
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Most of the biomass is low on the food chain, the herbivores,

87
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
the parrotfish, the surgeonfish that eat the algae.

88
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Then the plankton feeders, these little damselfish,

89
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
the little animals floating in the water.

90
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And then we have a lower biomass of carnivores,

91
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
and a lower biomass of top head,

92
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
or the sharks, the large snappers, the large groupers.

93
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
But this is a consequence.

94
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
This view of the world is a consequence

95
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
of having studied degraded reefs.

96
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
When we went to pristine reefs,

97
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
we realized that the natural world

98
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
was upside down;

99
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
this pyramid was inverted.

100
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
The top head does account for most of the biomass,

101
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
in some places up to 85 percent,

102
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
like Kingman Reef, which is now protected.

103
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
The good news is that, in addition to having more predators,

104
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
there's more of everything.

105
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
The size of these boxes is bigger.

106
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
We have more sharks, more biomass of snappers,

107
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
more biomass of herbivores, too,

108
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
like these parrot fish that are like marine goats.

109
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
They clean the reef; everything that grows enough to be seen,

110
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
they eat, and they keep the reef clean

111
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and allow the corals to replenish.

112
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Not only do these places --

113
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
these ancient, pristine places -- have lots of fish,

114
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
but they also have other important components

115
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
of the ecosystem like the giant clams;

116
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
pavements of giant clams in the lagoons,

117
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
up to 20, 25 per square meter.

118
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
These have disappeared from every inhabited reef in the world,

119
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and they filter the water;

120
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
they keep the water clean from

121
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
microbes and pathogens.

122
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
But still, now we have global warming.

123
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
If we don't have fishing because these reefs are protected by law

124
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
or their remoteness, this is great.

125
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
But the water gets warmer for too long

126
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and the corals die.

127
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So how are these fish,

128
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
these predators going to help?

129
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Well, what we have seen is that

130
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
in this particular area

131
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
during El Nino, year '97, '98,

132
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
the water was too warm for too long,

133
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and many corals bleached

134
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and many died.

135
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
In Christmas, where the food web is really trimmed down,

136
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
where the large animals are gone,

137
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
the corals have not recovered.

138
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
In Fanning Island, the corals are not recovered.

139
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
But you see here

140
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
a big table coral that died and collapsed.

141
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And the fish have grazed the algae,

142
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
so the turf of algae is a little lower.

143
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Then you go to Palmyra Atoll

144
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that has more biomass of herbivores,

145
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and the dead corals are clean,

146
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and the corals are coming back.

147
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And when you go to the pristine side,

148
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
did this ever bleach?

149
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
These places bleached too, but they recovered faster.

150
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
The more intact, the more complete,

151
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
[and] the more complex your food web,

152
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
the higher the resilience, [and] the more likely

153
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that the system is going to recover

154
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
from the short-term impacts of warming events.

155
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And that's good news, so we need to recover that structure.

156
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We need to make sure that all of the pieces of the ecosystem are there

157
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
so the ecosystem can adapt

158
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
to the effects of global warming.

159
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So if we have to reset the baseline,

160
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
if we have to push the ecosystem back to the left,

161
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
how can we do it?

162
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Well, there are several ways.

163
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
One very clear way is the marine protected areas,

164
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
especially no-take reserves

165
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that we set aside

166
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
to allow for the recovery for marine life.

167
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And let me go back to that image

168
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
of the Mediterranean.

169
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
This was my baseline. This is what I saw when I was a kid.

170
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And at the same time I was watching

171
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Jacques Cousteau's shows on TV,

172
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
with all this richness and abundance and diversity.

173
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And I thought that this richness

174
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
belonged to tropical seas,

175
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and that the Mediterranean was a naturally poor sea.

176
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
But, little did I know,

177
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
until I jumped for the first time in a marine reserve.

178
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And this is what I saw, lots of fish.

179
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
After a few years, between five and seven years,

180
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
fish come back, they eat the urchins,

181
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and then the algae grow again.

182
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So you have this little algal forest,

183
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and in the size of a laptop

184
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
you can find more than 100 species of algae,

185
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
mostly microscopic fit

186
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
hundreds of species of little animals

187
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
that then feed the fish,

188
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
so that the system recovers.

189
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And this particular place, the Medes Islands Marine Reserve,

190
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
is only 94 hectares,

191
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and it brings 6 million euros to the local economy,

192
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
20 times more than fishing,

193
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and it represents 88 percent

194
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
of all the tourist revenue.

195
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So these places not only help the ecosystem

196
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
but also help the people

197
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
who can benefit from the ecosystem.

198
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So let me just give you a summary

199
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
of what no-take reserves do.

200
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
These places, when we protect them,

201
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
if we compare them to unprotected areas nearby, this is what happens.

202
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
The number of species increases 21 percent;

203
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
so if you have 1,000 species

204
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
you would expect 200 more in a marine reserve.

205
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
This is very substantial.

206
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
The size of organisms increases a third,

207
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
so your fish are now this big.

208
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
The abundance, how many fish you have per square meter,

209
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
increases almost 170 percent.

210
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And the biomass -- this is the most spectacular change --

211
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
4.5 times greater biomass

212
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
on average, just after five to seven years.

213
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
In some places up to 10 times

214
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
larger biomass inside the reserves.

215
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So we have all these things

216
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
inside the reserve that grow, and what do they do?

217
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
They reproduce. That's population biology 101.

218
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
If you don't kill the fish, they take a longer time to die,

219
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
they grow larger and they reproduce a lot.

220
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And same thing for invertebrates. This is the example.

221
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
These are egg cases

222
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
laid by a snail off the coast of Chile,

223
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and this is how many eggs they lay on the bottom.

224
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Outside the reserve,

225
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
you cannot even detect this.

226
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
One point three million eggs per square meter

227
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
inside the marine reserve where these snails are very abundant.

228
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So these organisms reproduce,

229
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
the little larvae juveniles spill over,

230
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
they all spill over,

231
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and then people can benefit from them outside too.

232
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
This is in the Bahamas: Nassau grouper.

233
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Huge abundance of groupers inside the reserve,

234
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and the closer you get to the reserve,

235
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
the more fish you have.

236
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So the fishermen are catching more.

237
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
You can see where the limits of the reserve are

238
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
because you see the boats lined up.

239
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
So there is spill over;

240
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
there are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves

241
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
that help people around them,

242
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
while at the same time

243
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
the reserve is protecting

244
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
the entire habitat. It is building resilience.

245
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
So what we have now --

246
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
or a world without reserves --

247
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
is like a debit account

248
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
where we withdraw all the time

249
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and we never make any deposit.

250
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Reserves are like savings accounts.

251
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
We have this principal that we don't touch;

252
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
that produces returns,

253
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
social, economic and ecological.

254
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And if we think about the increase of biomass inside the reserves,

255
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
this is like compound interest.

256
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Two examples, again,

257
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
of how these reserves can benefit people.

258
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
This is how much fishermen get

259
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
everyday in Kenya, fishing

260
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
over a series of years,

261
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
in a place where

262
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
there is no protection; it's a free-for-all.

263
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Once the most degrading fishing gear,

264
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
seine nets, were removed,

265
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
the fishermen were catching more.

266
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
If you fish less, you're actually catching more.

267
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
But if we add the no-take reserve on top of that,

268
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
the fishermen are still making more money

269
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
by fishing less around an area that is protected.

270
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Another example:

271
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Nassau groupers in Belize in the Mesoamerican Reef.

272
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
This is grouper sex,

273
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and the groupers aggregate around the full moons

274
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
of December and January for a week.

275
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
They used to aggregate up to the

276
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
tens of thousands, 30,000 groupers about this big

277
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
in one hectare, in one aggregation.

278
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Fishermen knew about these things; they caught them, and they depleted them.

279
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
When I went there for the first time in 2000,

280
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
there were only 3,000 groupers left.

281
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And the fishermen were authorized to catch 30 percent

282
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
of the entire spawning population every year.

283
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
So we did a simple analysis,

284
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and it doesn't take rocket science

285
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
to figure out that, if you take 30 percent every year,

286
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
your fishery is going to collapse very quickly.

287
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And with the fishery, the entire reproductive ability

288
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
of the species goes extinct.

289
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
It happened in many places around the Caribbean.

290
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And they would make 4,000 dollars per year,

291
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
total, for the entire fishery,

292
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
several fishing boats.

293
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Now, if you do an economic analysis

294
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and project what would happen

295
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
if the fish were not cut,

296
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
if we brought just 20 divers

297
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
one month per year,

298
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
the revenue would be more than 20 times higher

299
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and that would be sustainable over time.

300
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
So how much of this do we have?

301
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
If this is so good, if this is such a no-brainer, how much of this do we have?

302
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And you already heard that

303
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
less than one percent of the ocean's protected.

304
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
We're getting closer to one percent now,

305
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
thanks to the protections of the Chagos Archipelago,

306
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and only a fraction of this is fully protected from fishing.

307
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Scientific studies recommend that at least 20 percent

308
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
of the ocean should be protected.

309
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
The estimated range is between 20 and 50 percent

310
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
for a series of goals of biodiversity

311
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and fishery enhancement and resilience.

312
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Now, is this possible? People would ask: How much would that cost?

313
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Well, let's think about

314
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
how much we are paying now

315
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
to subsidize fishing:

316
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
35 billion dollars per year.

317
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Many of these subsidies go to destructive fishing practices.

318
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Well, there are a couple estimates

319
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
of how much it would cost to create

320
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
a network of protected areas

321
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
covering 20 percent of the ocean

322
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
that would be only a fraction

323
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
of what we are now paying;

324
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
the government hands out to a fishery

325
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
that is collapsing.

326
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
People are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing.

327
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
A creation of a network of reserves

328
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
would provide direct employment for more than a million people

329
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
plus all the secondary jobs and all the secondary benefits.

330
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
So how can we do that?

331
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
If it's so clear that these savings accounts

332
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
are good for the environment and for people,

333
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
why don't we have 20, 50 percent of the ocean?

334
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And how can we reach that goal?

335
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Well, there are two ways of getting there.

336
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
The trivial solution is to create really large protected areas

337
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
like the Chagos Archipelago.

338
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
The problem is that we can create these large reserves

339
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
only in places where there are no people, where there is no social conflict,

340
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
where the political cost is really low

341
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and the economic cost is also low.

342
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And a few of us, a few organizations in this room and elsewhere

343
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
are working on this.

344
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
But what about the rest of the coast of the world,

345
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
where people live and make a living out of fishing?

346
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Well, there are three main reasons why

347
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
we don't have tens of thousands of small reserves:

348
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
The first one is that people have no idea

349
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
what marine reserves do,

350
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and fishermen tend to be really, really defensive

351
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
when it comes to regulating or closing

352
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
an area, even if it's small.

353
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Second, the governance is not right

354
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
because most coastal communities around the world

355
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
don't have the authority

356
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
to monitor the resources to create the reserve and enforce it.

357
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
It's a top down hierarchical structure

358
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
where people wait for

359
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
government agents to come

360
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and this is not effective. And the government doesn't have enough resources.

361
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Which takes us to the third reason,

362
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
why we don't have many more reserves,

363
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
is that the funding models have been wrong.

364
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
NGOs and governments

365
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
spend a lot of time and energy and resources

366
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
in a few small areas, usually.

367
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
So marine conservation and coastal protection

368
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
has become a sink for government or philanthropic money,

369
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and this is not sustainable.

370
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
So the solutions are just

371
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
fixing these three issues.

372
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
First, we need to develop a global awareness campaign

373
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
to inspire local communities and governments

374
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
to create no-take reserves

375
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
that are better than what we have now.

376
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
It's the savings accounts

377
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
versus the debit accounts with no deposits.

378
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Second, we need to redesign our governance

379
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
so conservation efforts can be decentralized,

380
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
so conservation efforts don't depend on

381
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
work from NGOs

382
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
or from government agencies

383
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
and can be created by the local communities,

384
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
like it happens in the Philippines and a few other places.

385
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
And third, and very important,

386
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
we need to develop new business models.

387
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
The philanthropy sink as the only way to create reserves

388
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
is not sustainable.

389
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
We really need to develop models, business models,

390
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
where coastal conservation

391
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
is an investment,

392
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
because we already know

393
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
that these marine reserves provide

394
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
social, ecological and economic benefits.

395
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
And I'd like to finish with one thought,

396
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
which is that no one

397
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
organization alone

398
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
is going to save the ocean.

399
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
There has been a lot of competition in the past,

400
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
and we need to develop

401
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
a new model of partnership,

402
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
truly collaborative,

403
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
where we are looking for complementing,

404
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
not substituting.

405
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
The stakes are just too high

406
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
to continue the way we are going.

407
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
So let's do that. Thank you very much.

408
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
(Applause)

409
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
Chris Anderson: Thank you Enric.

410
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Enric Sala: Thank you.

411
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
CA: That was a masterful job

412
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
of pulling things together.

413
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
First of all, your pyramid, your inverted pyramid,

414
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
showing 85 percent biomass in the predators,

415
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
that seems impossible.

416
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
How could 85 percent

417
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
survive on 15 percent?

418
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
ES: Well, imagine that you have two gears

419
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
of a watch, a big one and a small one.

420
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
The big one is moving very slowly, and the small one is moving fast.

421
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
That's basically it.

422
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
The animals at the lower parts of the food chain,

423
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
they reproduce very fast; they grow really fast; they produce millions of eggs.

424
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Up there, you have sharks and large fish that live 25, 30 years.

425
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
They reproduce very slowly; they have a slow metabolism;

426
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
and, basically, they just maintain their biomass.

427
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
So, basically, the production surplus of these guys down there

428
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
is enough to maintain this biomass

429
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
that is not moving.

430
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
They are like capacitors of the system.

431
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
CA: That's very fascinating.

432
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
So, really, our picture of a food pyramid

433
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
is just -- we have to change that completely.

434
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
ES: At least in the seas.

435
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
What we found in coral reefs is that the inverted pyramid

436
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
is the equivalent of the Serengeti,

437
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
with five lions per wildebeest.

438
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
And on land, this cannot work.

439
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
But at least on coral reefs are systems

440
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
where there is a bottom component with structure.

441
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
We think this is universal.

442
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
But we have started studying pristine reefs

443
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
only very recently.

444
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
CA: So the numbers you presented really are astonishing.

445
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
You're saying we're spending 35 billion dollars

446
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
now on subsidies.

447
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
It would only cost 16 billion to set up

448
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
20 percent of the ocean as

449
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
marine protected areas

450
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
that actually give new living choices

451
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
to the fishermen as well.

452
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
If the world was a smarter place,

453
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
we could solve this problem for negative 19 billion dollars.

454
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:27,000
We've got 19 billion to spend on health care or something.

455
0:18:27.26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
ES: And then we have the under-performance of fisheries

456
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:18:33,000
that is 50 billion dollars.

457
0:18:33.26,000 --> 0:18:35,000
So again, one of the big solutions is

458
0:18:35.26,000 --> 0:18:37,000
have the World Trade Organization shifting the subsidies

459
0:18:37.26,000 --> 0:18:4,000
to sustainable practices.

460
0:18:40.26,000 --> 0:18:42,000
CA: Okay, so there's a lot of examples that I'm hearing out there

461
0:18:42.26,000 --> 0:18:44,000
about ending this subsidies madness.

462
0:18:44.26,000 --> 0:18:46,000
So thank you for those numbers.

463
0:18:46.26,000 --> 0:18:48,000
The last one's a personal question.

464
0:18:48.26,000 --> 0:18:5,000
A lot of the experience of people here

465
0:18:50.26,000 --> 0:18:52,000
who've been in the oceans for a long time

466
0:18:52.26,000 --> 0:18:55,000
has just been seeing this degradation, the places they saw that were beautiful

467
0:18:55.26,000 --> 0:18:57,000
getting worse, depressing.

468
0:18:57.26,000 --> 0:18:59,000
Talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced

469
0:18:59.26,000 --> 0:19:02,000
of going to these pristine areas

470
0:19:02.26,000 --> 0:19:05,000
and seeing things coming back.

471
0:19:05.26,000 --> 0:19:08,000
ES: It is a spiritual experience.

472
0:19:08.26,000 --> 0:19:1,000
We go there to try to understand the ecosystems,

473
0:19:10.26,000 --> 0:19:13,000
to try to measure or count fish and sharks

474
0:19:13.26,000 --> 0:19:16,000
and see how these places are different from the places we know.

475
0:19:16.26,000 --> 0:19:19,000
But the best feeling

476
0:19:19.26,000 --> 0:19:21,000
is this biophilia that E.O. Wilson talks about,

477
0:19:21.26,000 --> 0:19:24,000
where humans have this sense of awe and wonder

478
0:19:24.26,000 --> 0:19:27,000
in front of untamed nature, of raw nature.

479
0:19:27.26,000 --> 0:19:29,000
And there, only there,

480
0:19:29.26,000 --> 0:19:32,000
you really feel that you are part of a larger thing

481
0:19:32.26,000 --> 0:19:35,000
or of a larger global ecosystem.

482
0:19:35.26,000 --> 0:19:38,000
And if it were not for these places that show hope,

483
0:19:38.26,000 --> 0:19:4,000
I don't think I could continue doing this job.

484
0:19:40.26,000 --> 0:19:42,000
It would be just too depressing.

485
0:19:42.26,000 --> 0:19:44,000

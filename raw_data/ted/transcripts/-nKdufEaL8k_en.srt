1
0:00:13.246,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Listen to the sounds of why hearing matters

2
0:00:16.271,000 --> 0:00:17,000
to the Alaskan Native people.

3
0:00:18.718,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Hearing loss makes it hard to fish on the open water,

4
0:00:22.597,000 --> 0:00:25,000
hunt caribou and harvest berries,

5
0:00:25.629,000 --> 0:00:28,000
activities central to Alaskan Native culture.

6
0:00:30.279,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Hearing loss isn't unique to rural Alaska.

7
0:00:33.582,000 --> 0:00:34,000
It's global.

8
0:00:35.29,000 --> 0:00:41,000
The Global Burden of Disease Project estimates there are 1.1 billion people

9
0:00:41.493,000 --> 0:00:43,000
living with hearing loss worldwide.

10
0:00:44.329,000 --> 0:00:49,000
That's more people than the entire population here in sub-Saharan Africa.

11
0:00:50.198,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Over 80 percent are in low- and middle-income countries,

12
0:00:54.06,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and many have no access to hearing care.

13
0:00:58.67,000 --> 0:01:01,000
The impact on people's lives is tremendous.

14
0:01:03.05,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Anuk is a three-year-old boy I treated in Alaska.

15
0:01:07.596,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Ear infections started when he was barely four months old.

16
0:01:11.872,000 --> 0:01:13,000
His parents brought him into clinic,

17
0:01:14.013,000 --> 0:01:17,000
worried he didn't say much compared to his brothers.

18
0:01:17.828,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Sure enough, many rounds of infections had resulted in hearing loss.

19
0:01:23.772,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Without treatment, Anuk's speech will continue to lag behind.

20
0:01:29.235,000 --> 0:01:31,000
He's more likely to do worse in school,

21
0:01:32.039,000 --> 0:01:34,000
have worse job prospects

22
0:01:34.068,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and experience social isolation.

23
0:01:37.247,000 --> 0:01:39,000
But it doesn't have to be this way.

24
0:01:40.016,000 --> 0:01:45,000
The World Health Organization estimates that half of all global hearing loss

25
0:01:45.497,000 --> 0:01:46,000
can be prevented.

26
0:01:47.752,000 --> 0:01:51,000
If Anuk's hearing loss is identified and treated promptly,

27
0:01:52.178,000 --> 0:01:56,000
his life and the opportunities he has as he grows up

28
0:01:57.051,000 --> 0:01:58,000
could look vastly different.

29
0:01:59.998,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I'm an ear surgeon working with partners around the world

30
0:02:03.446,000 --> 0:02:05,000
on new pathways for hearing loss prevention.

31
0:02:06.976,000 --> 0:02:1,000
This solution comes from my collaboration with a tribal health organization

32
0:02:11.59,000 --> 0:02:13,000
called the Norton Sound Health Corporation.

33
0:02:14.554,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Hearing loss evaluation traditionally requires testing by an audiologist

34
0:02:18.925,000 --> 0:02:19,000
in a soundproof room,

35
0:02:20.518,000 --> 0:02:22,000
with a lot of permanent equipment.

36
0:02:23.25,000 --> 0:02:26,000
An ear surgeon then examines Anuk's ears under a microscope

37
0:02:26.91,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and decides a treatment plan.

38
0:02:29.083,000 --> 0:02:32,000
These resources simply aren't available in remote settings.

39
0:02:33.093,000 --> 0:02:37,000
In a state where 75 percent of communities aren't connected to a hospital

40
0:02:37.772,000 --> 0:02:38,000
by road,

41
0:02:38.953,000 --> 0:02:4,000
an expensive flight is required.

42
0:02:42.023,000 --> 0:02:45,000
To overcome these barriers, Alaska has developed

43
0:02:45.398,000 --> 0:02:47,000
a state-of-the-art telemedicine system

44
0:02:48.1,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that connects over 250 village health clinics

45
0:02:51.362,000 --> 0:02:54,000
with specialists who triage all types of health concerns.

46
0:02:55.62,000 --> 0:02:59,000
My colleagues have validated that ear-related telemedicine consults

47
0:02:59.87,000 --> 0:03:01,000
are equivalent to an in-person exam.

48
0:03:03.331,000 --> 0:03:08,000
In 2016, travel was prevented for 91 percent of patients

49
0:03:08.365,000 --> 0:03:11,000
receiving specialty telemedicine in the Norton Sound region.

50
0:03:12.365,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Telemedicine has saved over 18 million in travel costs in this single region

51
0:03:17.675,000 --> 0:03:19,000
over the past 15 years.

52
0:03:20.474,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Our team is taking the power of telemedicine to a new level,

53
0:03:24.206,000 --> 0:03:25,000
through a project

54
0:03:25.388,000 --> 0:03:28,000
funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute.

55
0:03:28.713,000 --> 0:03:3,000
For the first time, we are merging telemedicine

56
0:03:31.714,000 --> 0:03:33,000
with mobile screening technology

57
0:03:34.341,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that extends the reach of expert triage beyond health care settings.

58
0:03:39.068,000 --> 0:03:42,000
This cell-based screen, developed in South Africa,

59
0:03:42.634,000 --> 0:03:45,000
costs over 10 times less than traditional equipment

60
0:03:46.145,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and does not require advanced training.

61
0:03:49.258,000 --> 0:03:51,000
If I were screening Anuk at school,

62
0:03:51.966,000 --> 0:03:54,000
sound-attenuating headphones and noise monitoring

63
0:03:54.999,000 --> 0:03:56,000
would take the place of a sound booth,

64
0:03:57.279,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and I would use a phone adapter instead of a microscope

65
0:03:59.95,000 --> 0:04:,000
to examine his ears.

66
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
In a matter of minutes, screening and images are done.

67
0:04:06.054,000 --> 0:04:08,000
We then apply Alaska telemedicine technology

68
0:04:08.894,000 --> 0:04:1,000
to transmit the data to specialists,

69
0:04:11.471,000 --> 0:04:13,000
who connect Anuk to the treatment he needs.

70
0:04:14.944,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Our team is launching a randomized trial

71
0:04:17.902,000 --> 0:04:19,000
in 15 communities along the Bering Sea

72
0:04:20.442,000 --> 0:04:22,000
to study how well this intervention works.

73
0:04:24.008,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Our goal is to prevent childhood hearing loss across the state of Alaska.

74
0:04:29.522,000 --> 0:04:32,000
But the concept is bigger than a single state.

75
0:04:32.722,000 --> 0:04:34,000
The impact is global.

76
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Mobile telemedicine can revolutionize access to care.

77
0:04:40.354,000 --> 0:04:45,000
In Malawi, for example, there are only two ear surgeons and 11 audiologists

78
0:04:45.537,000 --> 0:04:47,000
for a population of 17 million.

79
0:04:48.506,000 --> 0:04:52,000
This technology could empower teachers and community health workers

80
0:04:52.82,000 --> 0:04:56,000
to provide access to care to children in places like Malawi.

81
0:04:57.767,000 --> 0:05:,000
Scaling up globally could change children's lives

82
0:05:01.242,000 --> 0:05:04,000
who have never had access to hearing care before,

83
0:05:04.512,000 --> 0:05:07,000
using just the power of a cell phone.

84
0:05:08.418,000 --> 0:05:11,000
It's time to change the course of preventable hearing loss.

85
0:05:12.383,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Anuk and countless children like him are depending on us.

86
0:05:16.753,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Thank you.

87
0:05:17.932,000 --> 0:05:2,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Zach Kaplan: Keith and I lead a research team.

2
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
We investigate materials and technologies

3
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that have unexpected properties. Over the last three years,

4
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
we found over 200 of these things, and so we looked

5
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
back into our library and selected six we thought would be most

6
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
surprising for TED.

7
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Of these six, the first one that we're going to talk about

8
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
is in the black envelope you're holding.

9
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
It comes from a company in Japan called GelTech. Now go ahead and open it up.

10
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Keith Schacht: Now be sure and take the two pieces apart.

11
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
What's unexpected about this is that it's soft, but it's also a strong magnet.

12
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Zach and I have always been fascinated

13
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
observing unexpected things like this.

14
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
We spent a long time thinking about why this is, and it's just recently that we realized:

15
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
it's when we see something unexpected,

16
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
it changes our understanding of the way things work.

17
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
As you're seeing this gel magnet for the first time,

18
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
if you assume that all magnets had to be hard,

19
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
then seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding

20
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
of the way magnets could work.

21
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
ZK: Now, it's important to understand what the unexpected properties are.

22
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
But to really think about the implications of what this makes possible,

23
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
we found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world.

24
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So, a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors.

25
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
If you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material --

26
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
if a cabinet slams shut it wouldn't make a loud noise,

27
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed.

28
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Imagine taking the same material, but putting it on the bottom of a sneaker.

29
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
You know, this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those

30
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door, in your closet,

31
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
and you could literally stick your shoes up instead of using a shelf.

32
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
For me, I really love this idea.

33
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
(Laughter)

34
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
If you come to my apartment and see my closet,

35
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I'm sure you'd figure out why: it's a mess.

36
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
KS: Seeing the unexpected properties and then seeing a couple of

37
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
applications -- it helps you see why this is significant, what the potential is.

38
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
But we've found that the way we present our ideas

39
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
it makes a big difference.

40
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
ZK: It was like six months ago that Keith and I were out in L.A.,

41
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and we were at Starbucks having coffee with Roman Coppola.

42
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
He works on mostly music videos and commercials

43
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
with his company, The Directors Bureau.

44
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
As we were talking, Roman told us that he's kind of an inventor on the side.

45
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And we were showing him the same

46
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
gel magnet that you're holding in your hand -- and you know,

47
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
we shared the same ideas. And you could see it in his face:

48
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Roman starts to get really excited and he whips out this manila folder;

49
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
he opens it up and Keith and I look in,

50
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and he starts showing us concepts that he's been working on.

51
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
These things just get him really excited. And so we're looking

52
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
at these concepts, and we were just like, whoa, this guy's good.

53
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Because the way that he presented the concept -- his approach

54
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
was totally different than ours. He sold it to you as if it was for sale right now.

55
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
When we were going in the car back to the airport,

56
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
we were thinking: why was this so powerful?

57
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And as we thought about it more, we realized that

58
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
it let you fill in all the details about the experience,

59
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
just as if you saw it on TV. So, for TED we decided to take our favorite

60
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
idea for the gel magnet and work with Roman and his team

61
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
at the Directors Bureau to create a commercial for a product

62
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
from the future.

63
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Narrator: Do you have a need for speed?

64
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Inventables Water Adventures dares you to launch yourself

65
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
on a magnetically-levitating board down a waterslide

66
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
so fast, so tall, that when you hit the bottom, it uses brakes to stop.

67
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Aqua Rocket: coming this summer.

68
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
KS: Now, we showed the concept to a few people before this,

69
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and they asked us, when's it coming out?

70
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So I just wanted to let you know, it's not actually coming out,

71
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
just the concept is.

72
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
ZK: So now, when we dream up these concepts, it's important for us

73
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint.

74
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So I just want to quickly explain how this would work.

75
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
This is the magnetically-levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial.

76
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
The gel that you're holding would be lining the bottom of the board.

77
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Now this is important for two reasons.

78
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
One: the soft properties of the magnet that make it so that, if it were

79
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
to hit the rider in the head, it wouldn't injure him.

80
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
In addition, you can see from the diagram on the right,

81
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet.

82
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you're going down.

83
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
The force of the water rushing down, in addition to that repulsion force,

84
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market.

85
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
It's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system.

86
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
When you get to the very bottom of the slide --

87
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Laughter)

88
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
-- the rider passes through an aluminum tube.

89
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And I'm going to kick it to Keith to explain why that's important

90
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
from a technical standpoint.

91
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
KS: So I'm sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is

92
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
a metal, it's not a magnetic material. But something unexpected

93
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube.

94
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
So we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you.

95
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
(Laughter)

96
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Now, you see the magnet fell really slowly.

97
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Now, I'm not going to get into the physics of it,

98
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet's falling,

99
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
the greater the stopping force.

100
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
ZK: Now, our next technology is actually a 10-foot pole,

101
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and I have it right here in my pocket.

102
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
(Laughter)

103
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
There're a few different versions of it.

104
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
(Laughter)

105
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
KS: Some of them automatically unroll like this one.

106
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
They can be made to automatically roll up, or they can be made

107
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
stable, like Zach's, to hold any position in between.

108
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
ZK: As we were talking to the vendor -- to try to learn about

109
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
how you could apply these, or how they're being applied currently --

110
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
he was telling us that, in the military they use this one

111
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
so soldiers can keep it on their chests -- very concealed --

112
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and then, when they're out on the field, erect it as an antenna

113
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
to clearly send signals back to the base.

114
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
In our brainstorms, we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal:

115
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
so at the end of the game, you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag.

116
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
(Laughter)

117
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
KS: Now, the interesting thing about this is,

118
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
you don't have to be an engineer to appreciate why

119
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
a 10-foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting.

120
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
(Laughter)

121
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So we decided to go out onto the streets of Chicago

122
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this.

123
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Man: I clean my ceiling fans with that and I get the spider webs

124
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
off my house -- I do it that way.

125
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
Woman: I'd make my very own walking stick.

126
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Woman: I would create a ladder to use to get up on top of the tree.

127
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Woman: An olive server.

128
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Man: Some type of extension pole -- like what the painters use.

129
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Woman: I would make a spear that, when you went deep sea diving,

130
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
you could catch the fish really fast, and then roll it back up,

131
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and you could swim easier ... Yeah.

132
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
(Laughter)

133
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
ZK: Now, for our next technology we're going to do a little demonstration,

134
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and so we need a volunteer from the audience.

135
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
You sir, come on up.

136
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
(Laughter)

137
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Come on up. Tell everybody your name.

138
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Steve Jurvetson: Steve.

139
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
ZK: It's Steve. All right Steve, now, follow me.

140
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
We need you to stand right in front of the TED sign.

141
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Right there. That's great.

142
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And hold onto this. Good luck to you.

143
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
(Laughter)

144
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
KS: No, not yet.

145
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
(Laughter)

146
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
ZK: I'd just like to let you all know that this presentation

147
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
has been brought to you by Target.

148
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
KS: Little bit -- that's perfect, just perfect.

149
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Now, Zach, we're going to demonstrate

150
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
a water gun fight from the future.

151
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
(Laughter)

152
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So here, come on up to the front. All right, so

153
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
now if you'll see here -- no, no, it's OK.

154
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
So, describe to the audience the temperature of your shirt. Go ahead.

155
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
SJ: It's cold.

156
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
KS: Now the reason it's cold is that's it's not actually water loaded

157
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
into these squirt guns -- it's a dry liquid developed by 3M.

158
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
It's perfectly clear, it's odorless, it's colorless.

159
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
It's so safe you could drink this stuff.

160
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
(Laughter)

161
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And the reason it feels cold is because it evaporates

162
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
25 times faster than water.

163
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
(Laughter)

164
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
All right, well thanks for coming up.

165
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
(Laughter)

166
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
ZK: Wait, wait, Steven -- before you go we filled this with the dry liquid

167
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
so during the break you can shoot your friends.

168
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
SJ: Excellent, thank you.

169
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
KS: Thanks for coming up. Let's give him a big round of applause.

170
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
(Applause)

171
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
So what's the significance of this dry liquid?

172
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Early versions of the fluid were actually used on a Cray Supercomputer.

173
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Now, the unexpected thing about this

174
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
is that Zach could stand up on stage and drench

175
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
a perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern

176
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
that we'd damage the electronics, that we'd get him wet,

177
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
that we'd hurt the books or the computers. It works because it's non-conductive.

178
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
So you can see here, you can immerse a whole circuit board

179
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
in this and it wouldn't cause any damage.

180
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
You can circulate it to draw the heat away.

181
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
But today it's most widely used in office buildings --

182
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
in the sprinkler system -- as a fire-suppression fluid.

183
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Again, it's perfectly safe for people. It puts out the fires, doesn't hurt anything.

184
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
But our favorite idea for this

185
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
was using it in a basketball game. So during halftime,

186
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
it could rain down on the players, cool everyone down,

187
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and in a matter of minutes it would dry. Wouldn't hurt the court.

188
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
ZK: Our next technology comes to us from a company in Japan

189
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
called Sekisui Chemical. One of their R&D engineers

190
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
was working on a way to make plastic stiffer.

191
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
While he was doing this, he noticed an unexpected thing.

192
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
We have a video to show you.

193
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
KS: So you see there, it didn't bounce back. Now, this was

194
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
an unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing.

195
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
It's technically called, "shape-retaining property."

196
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Now, think about your interactions with aluminum foil.

197
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Shape-retaining is common in metal: you bend a piece of aluminum foil,

198
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and it holds its place. Contrast that with

199
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
a plastic garbage can -- and you can push in the sides

200
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and it always bounces back.

201
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
ZK: For example, you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist,

202
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
but doesn't use a buckle.

203
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Taking it a little further, if you wove

204
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
those strips together -- kind of like a little basket -- you could make

205
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
a shape-retaining sheet, and then you could embed it in a cloth:

206
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
so you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table,

207
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
so that way on a windy day it wouldn't blow away.

208
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
For our next technology, it's hard to observe

209
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
the unexpected property by itself, because it's an ink.

210
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
So, we've prepared a video to show it applied to paper.

211
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
KS: As this paper is bending, the resistance of the ink changes.

212
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
So with simple electronics, you can detect how much the page is being bent.

213
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Now, to think about the potential for this,

214
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
think of all the places ink is supplied: on business cards,

215
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
on the back of cereal boxes, board games. Any place you use ink,

216
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
you could change the way you interact with it.

217
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
ZK: So my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book.

218
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
This could totally change the way that you interface with paper.

219
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
You see the dark line on the side and the top. As you turn the pages

220
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
of the book, the book can actually detect what page you're on,

221
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
based on the curvature of the pages.

222
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
In addition, if you were to fold in one of the corners, then you could program

223
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
the book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes.

224
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
KS: For our last technology, we worked again with Roman and his team

225
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
at the Directors Bureau to develop a commercial from the future

226
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
to explain how it works.

227
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Old Milk Carton: Oh yeah, it smells good.

228
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Who are you?

229
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
New Milk Carton: I'm New Milk.

230
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
OMC: I used to smell like you.

231
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Narrator: Fresh Watch, from Inventables Dairy Farms.

232
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Packaging that changes color when your milk's gone off.

233
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Don't let milk spoil your morning.

234
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
ZK: Now, this technology was developed by these two guys:

235
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Professor Ken Suslick and Neil Rakow, of the University of Illinois.

236
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
KS: Now the way it works: there's a matrix of color dyes.

237
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
And these dyes change color in response to odors.

238
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
So the smell of vanilla, that might change the four on the left to brown

239
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and the one on the right to yellow. This matrix can produce

240
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
thousands of different color combinations to represent thousands of different smells.

241
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
But like in the milk commercial, if you know what odor you want to detect,

242
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
then they can formulate a specific dye to detect just that odor.

243
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
ZK: Right. It was that that started a conversation with Professor Suslick and myself,

244
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and he was explaining to me the things that this is making possible,

245
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
beyond just detecting spoiled food. It's really where the significance of it lies.

246
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
His company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn,

247
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
how are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene?

248
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And he kind of comically explained that

249
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
time after time, what the firemen would say is:

250
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
they would rush to the scene of the crime; they would look around;

251
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
if there were no dead policemen, it was OK to go.

252
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
(Laughter)

253
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
I mean, this is a true story. They're using policemen as canaries.

254
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
(Laughter)

255
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
But more seriously, they determined that you could develop

256
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
a device that can smell better than the humans,

257
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and say if it's safe for the firemen.

258
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
In addition, he's spun off a company from the University called ChemSensing,

259
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
where they're working on medical equipment.

260
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
So, a patient can come in and actually blow into their device.

261
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
By detecting the odor of particular bacteria, or viruses,

262
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
or even lung cancer, the dots will change and they can use

263
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
software to analyze the results.

264
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
This can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients.

265
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Currently, they're using a method of trial and error,

266
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
but this could tell you precisely what disease you have.

267
0:14:33.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
KS: So that was the six we had for you today, but I hope you're starting to see

268
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
why we find these things so fascinating.

269
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Because every one of these six changed our understanding

270
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
of what was possible in the world. Prior to seeing this,

271
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
we would have assumed: a 10-foot pole couldn't fit in your pocket;

272
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:5,000
something as inexpensive as ink couldn't sense the way paper is being bent;

273
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
every one of these things -- and we're constantly trying to find more.

274
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
ZK: This is something that Keith and I really enjoy doing.

275
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
I'm sure it's obvious to you now, but it was actually yesterday

276
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
that I was reminded of why. I was having a conversation

277
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:06,000
with Steve Jurvetson, over downstairs by the escalators,

278
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and he was telling me that when Chris sent out that little box,

279
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:11,000
one of the items in it was the hydrophobic sand --

280
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
the sand that doesn't get wet. He said that he was playing with it with his son.

281
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
And you know, his son was mesmerized,

282
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
because he would dunk it in the water, he would take it out

283
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
and it was bone dry. A few weeks later, he said that his son

284
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
was playing with a lock of his mother's hair, and he noticed

285
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
that there were some drops of water on the hair.

286
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
And he took the thing and he looked up to Steve and he said,

287
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
"Look, hydrophobic string."

288
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
(Laughter)

289
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
I mean, after hearing that story -- that really summed it up for me.

290
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Thank you very much.

291
0:15:38.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
KS: Thank you.

292
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
(Applause)

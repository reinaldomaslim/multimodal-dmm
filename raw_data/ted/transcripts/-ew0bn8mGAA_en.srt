1
0:00:15.96,000 --> 0:00:19,000
The problem I want to talk with you about is really the problem of:

2
0:00:20.96,000 --> 0:00:26,000
How does one supply health care in a world in which cost is everything?

3
0:00:28.274,000 --> 0:00:29,000
How do you do that?

4
0:00:30.459,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And the basic paradigm we want to suggest to you,

5
0:00:32.818,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I want to suggest to you,

6
0:00:34.067,000 --> 0:00:37,000
is one in which you say that in order to treat disease,

7
0:00:37.763,000 --> 0:00:4,000
you have to first know what you're treating, that's diagnostics,

8
0:00:41.159,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and then you have to do something.

9
0:00:42.83,000 --> 0:00:46,000
The program we're involved in is something we call "Diagnostics for All,"

10
0:00:47.17,000 --> 0:00:49,000
or "zero-cost diagnostics."

11
0:00:49.305,000 --> 0:00:52,000
How do you provide medically relevant information

12
0:00:52.743,000 --> 0:00:54,000
at as close as possible to zero cost?

13
0:00:55.391,000 --> 0:00:56,000
How do you do it?

14
0:00:56.645,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Let me just give you two examples.

15
0:00:58.967,000 --> 0:01:03,000
The rigors of military medicine are not so dissimilar from the third world:

16
0:01:04.857,000 --> 0:01:08,000
poor resources, a rigorous environment -- a series of problems --

17
0:01:09.233,000 --> 0:01:1,000
light weight and things of this kind.

18
0:01:11.238,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And also they're not so different from the home health care

19
0:01:14.696,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and diagnostic system world.

20
0:01:17.125,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So, the technology I want to talk about is for the third world,

21
0:01:21.997,000 --> 0:01:22,000
for the developing world,

22
0:01:23.419,000 --> 0:01:25,000
but it has, I think, much broader application,

23
0:01:25.984,000 --> 0:01:28,000
because information is so important in the health care system.

24
0:01:30.301,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So you see two examples here.

25
0:01:32.119,000 --> 0:01:37,000
One is a lab that is actually a fairly high-end laboratory in Africa.

26
0:01:37.892,000 --> 0:01:41,000
The second is basically an entrepreneur who is set up and doing who-knows-what

27
0:01:42.22,000 --> 0:01:43,000
at a table in a market.

28
0:01:43.691,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I don't know what kind of health care is delivered there.

29
0:01:46.662,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But it's not really what is probably most efficient.

30
0:01:51.601,000 --> 0:01:53,000
What is our approach?

31
0:01:54.702,000 --> 0:01:59,000
The way in which one typically approaches a problem of lowering cost,

32
0:02:00.251,000 --> 0:02:02,000
starting from the perspective of the United States,

33
0:02:03.138,000 --> 0:02:05,000
is to take our solution,

34
0:02:05.305,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and then try to cut cost out of it.

35
0:02:08.023,000 --> 0:02:09,000
No matter how you do that,

36
0:02:09.46,000 --> 0:02:11,000
you're not going to start with a $100,000 instrument

37
0:02:11.99,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and bring it down to no cost.

38
0:02:13.435,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It isn't going to work.

39
0:02:14.632,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So the approach we took was the other way around, to ask:

40
0:02:17.515,000 --> 0:02:19,000
What is the cheapest possible stuff

41
0:02:20.004,000 --> 0:02:22,000
that you could make a diagnostic system out of,

42
0:02:22.964,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and get useful information and add function?

43
0:02:25.535,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And what we've chosen is paper.

44
0:02:27.556,000 --> 0:02:3,000
What you see here is a prototypic device.

45
0:02:30.604,000 --> 0:02:31,000
It's about a centimeter on the side.

46
0:02:32.46,000 --> 0:02:33,000
It's about the size of a fingernail.

47
0:02:34.461,000 --> 0:02:37,000
The lines around the edges are a polymer.

48
0:02:38.088,000 --> 0:02:39,000
It's made of paper.

49
0:02:39.954,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And paper, of course, wicks fluid, as you know, paper, cloth --

50
0:02:44.663,000 --> 0:02:45,000
drop wine on the tablecloth,

51
0:02:46.563,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and the wine wicks all over everything.

52
0:02:49.324,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Put it on your shirt, it ruins the shirt.

53
0:02:51.387,000 --> 0:02:53,000
That's what a hydrophilic surface does.

54
0:02:54.15,000 --> 0:02:57,000
So in this device, the idea is that you drip the bottom end of it

55
0:02:57.797,000 --> 0:02:59,000
in a drop of, in this case, urine.

56
0:03:00.46,000 --> 0:03:03,000
The fluid wicks its way into those chambers at the top.

57
0:03:04.232,000 --> 0:03:08,000
The brown color indicates the amount of glucose in the urine,

58
0:03:08.46,000 --> 0:03:11,000
the blue color indicates the amount of protein in the urine.

59
0:03:12.031,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And the combination of those two is a first-order shot

60
0:03:15.091,000 --> 0:03:18,000
at a number of useful things that you want.

61
0:03:18.237,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So, this is an example of a device made from a simple piece of paper.

62
0:03:21.618,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Now, how simple can you make the production?

63
0:03:24.46,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Why do we choose paper?

64
0:03:26.719,000 --> 0:03:28,000
There's an example of the same thing on a finger,

65
0:03:29.653,000 --> 0:03:31,000
showing you basically what it looks like.

66
0:03:31.933,000 --> 0:03:33,000
One reason for using paper is that it's everywhere.

67
0:03:34.385,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We have made these kinds of devices using napkins and toilet paper

68
0:03:39.582,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and wraps, and all kinds of stuff.

69
0:03:41.836,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So the production capability is there.

70
0:03:44.298,000 --> 0:03:48,000
The second is, you can put lots and lots of tests in a very small place.

71
0:03:48.619,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I'll show you in a moment that the stack of paper there

72
0:03:51.462,000 --> 0:03:53,000
would probably hold something like 100,000 tests,

73
0:03:54.218,000 --> 0:03:55,000
something of that kind.

74
0:03:55.983,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And then finally, a point you don't think of so much

75
0:03:58.852,000 --> 0:04:,000
in developed world medicine:

76
0:04:01.46,000 --> 0:04:02,000
it eliminates sharps.

77
0:04:03.163,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And what sharps means is needles, things that stick.

78
0:04:06.569,000 --> 0:04:08,000
If you've taken a sample of someone's blood

79
0:04:08.887,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and the someone might have hepatitis C,

80
0:04:11.408,000 --> 0:04:13,000
you don't want to make a mistake and stick it in you.

81
0:04:13.979,000 --> 0:04:14,000
You don't want to do that.

82
0:04:15.3,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So how do you dispose of that?

83
0:04:16.813,000 --> 0:04:18,000
It's a problem everywhere, and here, you simply burn it.

84
0:04:19.519,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So it's a sort of a practical approach to starting on things.

85
0:04:24.677,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Now, you say, "If paper is a good idea,

86
0:04:28.357,000 --> 0:04:29,000
other people have surely thought of it."

87
0:04:30.344,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And the answer is, of course, yes.

88
0:04:32.25,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Those half of you, roughly, who are women,

89
0:04:36.094,000 --> 0:04:38,000
at some point may have had a pregnancy test.

90
0:04:38.58,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And the most common of these is in a device

91
0:04:42.588,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that looks like the thing on the left.

92
0:04:44.46,000 --> 0:04:46,000
It's something called a lateral-flow immunoassay.

93
0:04:46.976,000 --> 0:04:47,000
In that particular test,

94
0:04:48.46,000 --> 0:04:51,000
urine, either containing a hormone called hCG,

95
0:04:52.099,000 --> 0:04:55,000
does or does not flow across a piece of paper.

96
0:04:55.46,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And there are two bars; one bar indicates that the test is working,

97
0:04:59.385,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and if the second bar shows up, you're pregnant.

98
0:05:02.574,000 --> 0:05:05,000
This is a terrific kind of test in a binary world,

99
0:05:05.769,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and the nice thing about pregnancy is either you are pregnant

100
0:05:08.708,000 --> 0:05:09,000
or you're not pregnant;

101
0:05:09.886,000 --> 0:05:11,000
you're not partially pregnant or thinking about being pregnant

102
0:05:12.891,000 --> 0:05:13,000
or something of that sort.

103
0:05:14.199,000 --> 0:05:16,000
So it works very well there, but it doesn't work very well

104
0:05:16.958,000 --> 0:05:18,000
when you need more quantitative information.

105
0:05:19.068,000 --> 0:05:2,000
There are also dipsticks,

106
0:05:20.312,000 --> 0:05:21,000
but if you look at the dipsticks,

107
0:05:22.082,000 --> 0:05:24,000
they're for another kind of urine analysis.

108
0:05:24.319,000 --> 0:05:26,000
There are an awful lot of colors and things like that.

109
0:05:27.22,000 --> 0:05:3,000
What do you actually do about that in a difficult circumstance?

110
0:05:31.632,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So the approach we started with is to ask:

111
0:05:35.965,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Is it really practical to make things of this sort?

112
0:05:39.46,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And that problem is now, in a purely engineering way, solved.

113
0:05:43.771,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And the procedure that we have is simply to start with paper.

114
0:05:47.344,000 --> 0:05:5,000
You run it through a new kind of printer called a wax printer.

115
0:05:50.914,000 --> 0:05:52,000
The wax printer does what looks like printing.

116
0:05:53.57,000 --> 0:05:54,000
It is printing.

117
0:05:54.752,000 --> 0:05:56,000
You put that on, you warm it a little bit,

118
0:05:56.816,000 --> 0:05:59,000
the wax prints through, so it absorbs into the paper,

119
0:05:59.883,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and you end up with the device you want.

120
0:06:02.051,000 --> 0:06:05,000
The printers cost 800 bucks now.

121
0:06:05.154,000 --> 0:06:08,000
We estimate that if you were to run them 24 hours a day,

122
0:06:09.066,000 --> 0:06:11,000
they'd make about 10 million tests a year.

123
0:06:11.198,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So it's a solved problem. That particular problem is solved.

124
0:06:14.446,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And there is an example of the kind of thing that you see.

125
0:06:17.246,000 --> 0:06:18,000
That's on a piece of 8 by 12 paper.

126
0:06:19.109,000 --> 0:06:21,000
That takes about two seconds to make.

127
0:06:21.402,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And so I regard that as done.

128
0:06:24.068,000 --> 0:06:25,000
There's a very important issue here,

129
0:06:25.886,000 --> 0:06:29,000
which is that because it's a printer, a color printer, it prints colors.

130
0:06:30.328,000 --> 0:06:31,000
That's what color printers do.

131
0:06:31.876,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I'll show you in a moment, that's actually quite useful.

132
0:06:35.911,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Now, the next question that you would like to ask is:

133
0:06:38.46,000 --> 0:06:41,000
What would you like to measure? What would you like to analyze?

134
0:06:41.675,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And the thing you'd most like to analyze, we're a fair distance from.

135
0:06:46.46,000 --> 0:06:49,000
It's what's called "fever of undiagnosed origin."

136
0:06:50.46,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Someone comes into the clinic, they have a fever, they feel bad.

137
0:06:54.045,000 --> 0:06:55,000
What do they have?

138
0:06:55.235,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Do they have TB? Do they have AIDS? Do they have a common cold?

139
0:06:58.661,000 --> 0:06:59,000
The triage problem.

140
0:06:59.899,000 --> 0:07:01,000
That's a hard problem for reasons I won't go through.

141
0:07:02.579,000 --> 0:07:05,000
There are an awful lot of things that you'd like to distinguish among.

142
0:07:06.145,000 --> 0:07:08,000
But then there are a series of things --

143
0:07:08.371,000 --> 0:07:11,000
AIDS, hepatitis, malaria, TB, others --

144
0:07:11.979,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and simpler ones, such as guidance of treatment.

145
0:07:15.498,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Now, even that's more complicated than you think.

146
0:07:18.46,000 --> 0:07:22,000
A friend of mine works in transcultural psychiatry,

147
0:07:22.699,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and he is interested in the question

148
0:07:24.829,000 --> 0:07:26,000
of why people do and don't take their meds.

149
0:07:27.583,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So Dapsone, or something like that, you have to take for a while.

150
0:07:31.182,000 --> 0:07:34,000
He has a wonderful story of talking to a villager in India

151
0:07:34.822,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and saying,

152
0:07:35.997,000 --> 0:07:36,000
"Have you taken your Dapsone?" "Yes."

153
0:07:37.827,000 --> 0:07:38,000
"Have you taken it every day?" "Yes."

154
0:07:39.717,000 --> 0:07:4,000
"Have you taken if for a month?" "Yes."

155
0:07:41.695,000 --> 0:07:42,000
What the guy actually meant

156
0:07:43.22,000 --> 0:07:46,000
was that he'd fed a 30-day dose of Dapsone to his dog that morning.

157
0:07:47.146,000 --> 0:07:48,000
(Laughter)

158
0:07:48.295,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And he was telling the truth, because in a different culture,

159
0:07:52.075,000 --> 0:07:54,000
the dog is a surrogate for you;

160
0:07:54.673,000 --> 0:07:57,000
"today," "this month," "since the rainy season" --

161
0:07:57.84,000 --> 0:07:59,000
there are lots of opportunities for misunderstanding.

162
0:08:00.348,000 --> 0:08:01,000
(Laughter)

163
0:08:01.379,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And so an issue here is to, in some cases, figure out

164
0:08:04.967,000 --> 0:08:08,000
how to deal with matters that seem uninteresting, like compliance.

165
0:08:10.42,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Now, take a look at what a typical test looks like.

166
0:08:14.679,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Prick a finger, you get some blood -- about 50 microliters.

167
0:08:18.46,000 --> 0:08:19,000
That's about all you're going to get,

168
0:08:20.315,000 --> 0:08:23,000
because you can't use the usual sort of systems.

169
0:08:24.845,000 --> 0:08:25,000
You can't manipulate it very well;

170
0:08:26.543,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I'll show something about that in a moment.

171
0:08:28.683,000 --> 0:08:3,000
So you take the drop of blood, no further manipulations,

172
0:08:31.46,000 --> 0:08:32,000
you put it on a little device,

173
0:08:33.267,000 --> 0:08:37,000
the device filters out the blood cells, lets the serum go through,

174
0:08:37.964,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and you get a series of colors down in the bottom there.

175
0:08:41.749,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And the colors indicate "disease" or "normal."

176
0:08:45.932,000 --> 0:08:46,000
But even that's complicated,

177
0:08:47.638,000 --> 0:08:5,000
because to me, colors might indicate "normal,"

178
0:08:51.263,000 --> 0:08:55,000
but after all, we're all suffering from probably an excess of education.

179
0:08:56.247,000 --> 0:09:,000
What do you do about something which requires quantitative analysis?

180
0:09:00.858,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And so the solution that we and many other people

181
0:09:03.564,000 --> 0:09:04,000
are thinking about there,

182
0:09:05.199,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and at this point, there is a dramatic flourish,

183
0:09:07.812,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and out comes the universal solution to everything these days,

184
0:09:11.008,000 --> 0:09:12,000
which is a cell phone --

185
0:09:12.189,000 --> 0:09:13,000
in this particular case, a camera phone.

186
0:09:14.211,000 --> 0:09:18,000
They're everywhere -- six billion a month in India.

187
0:09:18.46,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And the idea is that what one does is to take the device,

188
0:09:24.006,000 --> 0:09:26,000
you dip it, you develop the color,

189
0:09:26.46,000 --> 0:09:29,000
you take a picture, the picture goes to a central laboratory.

190
0:09:29.709,000 --> 0:09:3,000
You don't have to send out a doctor,

191
0:09:31.46,000 --> 0:09:33,000
you send out somebody who can just take the sample,

192
0:09:34.225,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and in the clinic either a doctor, or ideally, a computer in this case,

193
0:09:37.974,000 --> 0:09:38,000
does the analysis.

194
0:09:39.162,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Turns out to work actually quite well,

195
0:09:41.037,000 --> 0:09:44,000
particularly when your color printer has printed the color bars

196
0:09:44.153,000 --> 0:09:45,000
that indicate how things work.

197
0:09:45.998,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So my view of the health care worker of the future

198
0:09:49.046,000 --> 0:09:51,000
is not a doctor, but an 18-year-old,

199
0:09:51.637,000 --> 0:09:53,000
otherwise unemployed, who has two things:

200
0:09:54.413,000 --> 0:09:56,000
a backpack full of these tests and a lancet

201
0:09:56.52,000 --> 0:09:57,000
to occasionally take a blood sample,

202
0:09:58.46,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and an AK-47.

203
0:10:00.043,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And these are the things that get him through his day.

204
0:10:02.663,000 --> 0:10:03,000
(Laughter)

205
0:10:05.372,000 --> 0:10:07,000
There's another very interesting connection here,

206
0:10:07.731,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and that is, that what one wants to do is pass through useful information

207
0:10:13.295,000 --> 0:10:16,000
over what is generally a pretty awful telephone system.

208
0:10:16.85,000 --> 0:10:18,000
It turns out there's an enormous amount of information

209
0:10:19.46,000 --> 0:10:22,000
already available on that subject, which is the Mars Rover problem.

210
0:10:22.863,000 --> 0:10:25,000
How do you get back an accurate view of the color on Mars

211
0:10:26.754,000 --> 0:10:29,000
if you have a really terrible bandwidth to do it with?

212
0:10:30.564,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And the answer is not complicated,

213
0:10:32.46,000 --> 0:10:34,000
but it's one which I don't want to go through here,

214
0:10:35.025,000 --> 0:10:38,000
other than to say that the communication systems for doing this

215
0:10:38.093,000 --> 0:10:39,000
are really pretty well understood.

216
0:10:39.818,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Also, a fact which you may not know

217
0:10:42.579,000 --> 0:10:45,000
is that the compute capability of this thing is not so different

218
0:10:46.337,000 --> 0:10:48,000
from the compute capability of your desktop computer.

219
0:10:49.2,000 --> 0:10:52,000
This is a fantastic device which is only beginning to be tapped.

220
0:10:52.885,000 --> 0:10:55,000
I don't know whether the idea of one computer, one child

221
0:10:56.355,000 --> 0:10:57,000
makes any sense.

222
0:10:57.53,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Here's the computer of the future,

223
0:10:59.46,000 --> 0:11:02,000
because this screen is already there and they're ubiquitous.

224
0:11:04.111,000 --> 0:11:07,000
All right, let me show you just a little bit about advanced devices.

225
0:11:07.372,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And we'll start by posing a little problem.

226
0:11:09.55,000 --> 0:11:12,000
What you see here is another centimeter-sized device,

227
0:11:12.971,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and the different colors are different colors of dye.

228
0:11:16.978,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And you notice something

229
0:11:18.18,000 --> 0:11:2,000
which might strike you as a little bit interesting,

230
0:11:20.903,000 --> 0:11:22,000
which is, the yellow seems to disappear,

231
0:11:23.784,000 --> 0:11:25,000
get through the blue, and then get through the red.

232
0:11:26.297,000 --> 0:11:27,000
How does that happen?

233
0:11:27.474,000 --> 0:11:29,000
How do you make something flow through something?

234
0:11:30.073,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And, of course the answer is, "You don't."

235
0:11:32.292,000 --> 0:11:33,000
You make it flow under and over.

236
0:11:34.059,000 --> 0:11:35,000
But now the question is:

237
0:11:35.244,000 --> 0:11:38,000
How do you make it flow under and over in a piece of paper?

238
0:11:38.81,000 --> 0:11:4,000
The answer is that what you do --

239
0:11:41.78,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and the details are not terribly important here --

240
0:11:44.46,000 --> 0:11:45,000
is to make something more elaborate:

241
0:11:46.375,000 --> 0:11:48,000
You take several different layers of paper,

242
0:11:48.476,000 --> 0:11:51,000
each one containing its own little fluid system,

243
0:11:51.571,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and you separate them by pieces of, literally, double-sided carpet tape,

244
0:11:56.184,000 --> 0:11:58,000
the stuff you use to stick the carpets onto the floor.

245
0:11:59.094,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And the fluid will flow from one layer into the next.

246
0:12:02.344,000 --> 0:12:05,000
It distributes itself, flows through further holes,

247
0:12:05.46,000 --> 0:12:06,000
distributes itself.

248
0:12:07.073,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And what you see, at the lower right-hand side there,

249
0:12:10.338,000 --> 0:12:15,000
is a sample in which a single sample of blood has been put on the top,

250
0:12:15.661,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and it has gone through and distributed itself

251
0:12:18.195,000 --> 0:12:21,000
into these 16 holes on the bottom,

252
0:12:21.565,000 --> 0:12:23,000
in a piece of paper -- basically, it looks like a chip,

253
0:12:24.293,000 --> 0:12:25,000
two pieces of paper thick.

254
0:12:26.055,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And in this particular case,

255
0:12:27.562,000 --> 0:12:29,000
we were just interested in the replicability of that.

256
0:12:30.35,000 --> 0:12:32,000
But that is, in principle, the way you solve

257
0:12:32.678,000 --> 0:12:34,000
the "fever of unexplained origin" problem,

258
0:12:34.858,000 --> 0:12:36,000
because each one of those spots then becomes a test

259
0:12:37.638,000 --> 0:12:4,000
for a particular set of markers of disease,

260
0:12:41.261,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and this will work in due course.

261
0:12:43.551,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Here is an example of a slightly more complicated device.

262
0:12:46.891,000 --> 0:12:47,000
There's the chip.

263
0:12:48.097,000 --> 0:12:49,000
You dip in a corner.

264
0:12:49.337,000 --> 0:12:5,000
The fluid goes into the center.

265
0:12:50.908,000 --> 0:12:53,000
It distributes itself out into these various wells or holes

266
0:12:54.715,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and turns color,

267
0:12:55.975,000 --> 0:12:57,000
all done with paper and carpet tape.

268
0:12:58.692,000 --> 0:13:,000
So it's, I think, as low-cost

269
0:13:00.873,000 --> 0:13:02,000
as we're likely to be able to come up and make things.

270
0:13:04.692,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Now, I have two last little stories to tell you

271
0:13:08.012,000 --> 0:13:1,000
in finishing off this business.

272
0:13:10.646,000 --> 0:13:11,000
This is one:

273
0:13:11.835,000 --> 0:13:13,000
One of the things you occasionally need to do

274
0:13:14.3,000 --> 0:13:16,000
is separate blood cells from serum.

275
0:13:18.134,000 --> 0:13:19,000
And the question was,

276
0:13:19.843,000 --> 0:13:21,000
here we do it by taking a sample,

277
0:13:21.968,000 --> 0:13:24,000
we put it in a centrifuge, we spin it,

278
0:13:25.854,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and you get blood cells out.

279
0:13:28.345,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Terrific.

280
0:13:29.528,000 --> 0:13:32,000
What happens if you don't have electricity, a centrifuge, and whatever?

281
0:13:32.999,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And we thought for a while of how you might do this,

282
0:13:35.539,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and the way, in fact, you do it, is what's shown here.

283
0:13:38.2,000 --> 0:13:42,000
You get an eggbeater, which is everywhere, and you saw off a blade,

284
0:13:42.831,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and then you take tubing, and you stick it on that.

285
0:13:45.338,000 --> 0:13:47,000
You put the blood in, somebody sits there and spins it.

286
0:13:48.102,000 --> 0:13:5,000
It works really, really well.

287
0:13:50.245,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And we sat down, we did the physics of eggbeaters

288
0:13:52.683,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and self-aligning tubes and all the rest of that kind of thing,

289
0:13:55.784,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and sent it off to a journal.

290
0:13:57.27,000 --> 0:13:58,000
We were very proud of this,

291
0:13:58.616,000 --> 0:14:,000
particularly the title, which was "Eggbeater as Centrifuge."

292
0:14:01.502,000 --> 0:14:02,000
(Laughter)

293
0:14:02.6,000 --> 0:14:03,000
And we sent it off,

294
0:14:03.775,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and by return mail, it came back.

295
0:14:05.706,000 --> 0:14:06,000
I called up the editor and I said,

296
0:14:07.46,000 --> 0:14:09,000
"What's going on? How is this possible?"

297
0:14:09.606,000 --> 0:14:12,000
The editor said, with enormous disdain,

298
0:14:12.764,000 --> 0:14:13,000
"I read this.

299
0:14:14.231,000 --> 0:14:17,000
And we're not going to publish it, because we only publish science."

300
0:14:18.011,000 --> 0:14:19,000
(Laughter)

301
0:14:19.448,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And it's an important issue,

302
0:14:20.941,000 --> 0:14:23,000
because it means that we have to, as a society,

303
0:14:24.363,000 --> 0:14:25,000
think about what we value.

304
0:14:26.364,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And if it's just papers and Phys. Rev. letters,

305
0:14:29.172,000 --> 0:14:3,000
we've got a problem.

306
0:14:31.078,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Here is another example of something which is --

307
0:14:34.332,000 --> 0:14:36,000
this is a little spectrophotometer.

308
0:14:36.397,000 --> 0:14:39,000
It measures the absorption of light in a sample.

309
0:14:39.711,000 --> 0:14:4,000
The neat thing about this is,

310
0:14:41.214,000 --> 0:14:44,000
you have a light source that flickers on and off at about 1,000 hertz,

311
0:14:44.929,000 --> 0:14:47,000
another light source that detects that light at 1,000 hertz,

312
0:14:48.622,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and so you can run this system in broad daylight.

313
0:14:51.46,000 --> 0:14:53,000
It performs about equivalently

314
0:14:53.553,000 --> 0:14:57,000
to a system that's on the order of 100,000 dollars.

315
0:14:58.146,000 --> 0:14:59,000
It costs 50 dollars.

316
0:14:59.331,000 --> 0:15:03,000
We can probably make it for 50 cents if we put our mind to it.

317
0:15:03.46,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Why doesn't somebody do it?

318
0:15:05.357,000 --> 0:15:06,000
The answer is:

319
0:15:06.532,000 --> 0:15:09,000
How do you make a profit in a capitalist system, doing that?

320
0:15:09.826,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Interesting problem.

321
0:15:12.575,000 --> 0:15:16,000
So, let me finish by saying that we've thought about this

322
0:15:17.552,000 --> 0:15:19,000
as a kind of engineering problem.

323
0:15:19.778,000 --> 0:15:23,000
And we've asked: What is the scientific unifying idea here?

324
0:15:24.184,000 --> 0:15:26,000
And we've decided we should think about this

325
0:15:26.332,000 --> 0:15:29,000
not so much in terms of cost, but in terms of simplicity.

326
0:15:29.46,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Simplicity is a neat word.

327
0:15:31.062,000 --> 0:15:33,000
You've got to think about what simplicity means.

328
0:15:34.015,000 --> 0:15:35,000
I know what it is,

329
0:15:35.195,000 --> 0:15:37,000
but I don't actually know what it means.

330
0:15:37.396,000 --> 0:15:39,000
So I actually was interested enough in this

331
0:15:39.517,000 --> 0:15:42,000
to put together several groups of people.

332
0:15:43.904,000 --> 0:15:45,000
The most recent involved a couple of people at MIT,

333
0:15:46.46,000 --> 0:15:48,000
one of them being an exceptionally bright kid

334
0:15:48.604,000 --> 0:15:5,000
who is one of the very few people I would think of

335
0:15:51.338,000 --> 0:15:52,000
who's an authentic genius.

336
0:15:52.751,000 --> 0:15:56,000
We all struggled for an entire day to think about simplicity.

337
0:15:56.825,000 --> 0:16:,000
And I want to give you the answer of this deep scientific thought.

338
0:16:01.031,000 --> 0:16:02,000
[What is simplicity?

339
0:16:02.388,000 --> 0:16:03,000
"It's impossible to f..k it up"]

340
0:16:03.999,000 --> 0:16:04,000
(Laughter)

341
0:16:05.072,000 --> 0:16:07,000
So, in a sense, you get what you pay for.

342
0:16:07.546,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Thank you very much.

343
0:16:09.079,000 --> 0:16:11,000
(Applause)

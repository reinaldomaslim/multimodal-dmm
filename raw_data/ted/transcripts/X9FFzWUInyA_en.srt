1
0:00:12.446,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I am a neuroscientist

2
0:00:14.071,000 --> 0:00:17,000
with a mixed background in physics and medicine.

3
0:00:17.882,000 --> 0:00:22,000
My lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology

4
0:00:22.923,000 --> 0:00:25,000
focuses on spinal cord injury,

5
0:00:26.113,000 --> 0:00:28,000
which affects more than 50,000 people

6
0:00:28.844,000 --> 0:00:3,000
around the world every year,

7
0:00:31.534,000 --> 0:00:34,000
with dramatic consequences for affected individuals,

8
0:00:35.14,000 --> 0:00:37,000
whose life literally shatters

9
0:00:37.373,000 --> 0:00:4,000
in a matter of a handful of seconds.

10
0:00:40.608,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And for me, the Man of Steel,

11
0:00:43.666,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Christopher Reeve,

12
0:00:45.87,000 --> 0:00:47,000
has best raised the awareness

13
0:00:47.96,000 --> 0:00:49,000
on the distress of spinal cord injured people.

14
0:00:50.875,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And this is how I started my own personal journey

15
0:00:54.014,000 --> 0:00:55,000
in this field of research,

16
0:00:55.513,000 --> 0:00:58,000
working with the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation.

17
0:00:58.95,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I still remember this decisive moment.

18
0:01:03.546,000 --> 0:01:04,000
It was just at the end of a regular day of work

19
0:01:05.497,000 --> 0:01:06,000
with the foundation.

20
0:01:07.04,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Chris addressed us, the scientists and experts,

21
0:01:11.692,000 --> 0:01:14,000
"You have to be more pragmatic.

22
0:01:15.285,000 --> 0:01:17,000
When leaving your laboratory tomorrow,

23
0:01:17.637,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I want you to stop by the rehabilitation center

24
0:01:20.541,000 --> 0:01:21,000
to watch injured people

25
0:01:22.15,000 --> 0:01:24,000
fighting to take a step,

26
0:01:24.175,000 --> 0:01:26,000
struggling to maintain their trunk.

27
0:01:26.816,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And when you go home,

28
0:01:28.229,000 --> 0:01:3,000
think of what you are going to change in your research

29
0:01:30.639,000 --> 0:01:33,000
on the following day to make their lives better."

30
0:01:34.207,000 --> 0:01:38,000
These words, they stuck with me.

31
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
This was more than 10 years ago,

32
0:01:40.651,000 --> 0:01:42,000
but ever since, my laboratory has followed

33
0:01:43.418,000 --> 0:01:44,000
the pragmatic approach to recovery

34
0:01:45.381,000 --> 0:01:47,000
after spinal cord injury.

35
0:01:47.792,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And my first step in this direction

36
0:01:49.833,000 --> 0:01:52,000
was to develop a new model of spinal cord injury

37
0:01:53.122,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that would more closely mimic some of the key features of human injury

38
0:01:56.769,000 --> 0:01:59,000
while offering well-controlled experimental conditions.

39
0:02:00.141,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And for this purpose, we placed two hemisections

40
0:02:02.708,000 --> 0:02:03,000
on opposite sides of the body.

41
0:02:04.123,000 --> 0:02:06,000
They completely interrupt the communication

42
0:02:06.268,000 --> 0:02:08,000
between the brain and the spinal cord,

43
0:02:08.85,000 --> 0:02:1,000
thus leading to complete and permanent paralysis

44
0:02:11.56,000 --> 0:02:12,000
of the leg.

45
0:02:13.327,000 --> 0:02:16,000
But, as observed, after most injuries in humans,

46
0:02:17.218,000 --> 0:02:19,000
there is this intervening gap of intact neural tissue

47
0:02:20.168,000 --> 0:02:22,000
through which recovery can occur.

48
0:02:22.871,000 --> 0:02:25,000
But how to make it happen?

49
0:02:25.912,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Well, the classical approach

50
0:02:29.273,000 --> 0:02:31,000
consists of applying intervention

51
0:02:31.909,000 --> 0:02:33,000
that would promote the growth of the severed fiber

52
0:02:34.819,000 --> 0:02:36,000
to the original target.

53
0:02:36.927,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And while this certainly remained the key for a cure,

54
0:02:40.678,000 --> 0:02:43,000
this seemed extraordinarily complicated to me.

55
0:02:44.193,000 --> 0:02:46,000
To reach clinical fruition rapidly,

56
0:02:46.918,000 --> 0:02:47,000
it was obvious:

57
0:02:48.478,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I had to think about the problem differently.

58
0:02:52.398,000 --> 0:02:55,000
It turned out that more than 100 years of research

59
0:02:55.506,000 --> 0:02:56,000
on spinal cord physiology,

60
0:02:57.147,000 --> 0:02:59,000
starting with the Nobel Prize Sherrington,

61
0:02:59.472,000 --> 0:03:,000
had shown that

62
0:03:01.279,000 --> 0:03:03,000
the spinal cord, below most injuries,

63
0:03:03.514,000 --> 0:03:06,000
contained all the necessary and sufficient neural networks

64
0:03:06.767,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to coordinate locomotion,

65
0:03:09.087,000 --> 0:03:11,000
but because input from the brain is interrupted,

66
0:03:12.046,000 --> 0:03:15,000
they are in a nonfunctional state, like kind of dormant.

67
0:03:15.214,000 --> 0:03:19,000
My idea: We awaken this network.

68
0:03:19.546,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And at the time, I was a post-doctoral fellow in Los Angeles,

69
0:03:23.833,000 --> 0:03:25,000
after completing my Ph.D. in France,

70
0:03:26.399,000 --> 0:03:27,000
where independent thinking

71
0:03:28.308,000 --> 0:03:31,000
is not necessarily promoted.

72
0:03:31.415,000 --> 0:03:32,000
(Laughter)

73
0:03:33.242,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I was afraid to talk to my new boss,

74
0:03:36.995,000 --> 0:03:38,000
but decided to muster up my courage.

75
0:03:39.388,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I knocked at the door of my wonderful advisor,

76
0:03:42.045,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Reggie Edgerton, to share my new idea.

77
0:03:46.036,000 --> 0:03:48,000
He listened to me carefully,

78
0:03:48.286,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and responded with a grin.

79
0:03:51.227,000 --> 0:03:53,000
"Why don't you try?"

80
0:03:53.27,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And I promise to you,

81
0:03:55.395,000 --> 0:03:58,000
this was such an important moment in my career,

82
0:03:58.75,000 --> 0:04:,000
when I realized that the great leader

83
0:04:01.185,000 --> 0:04:03,000
believed in young people and new ideas.

84
0:04:04.178,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And this was the idea:

85
0:04:05.786,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I'm going to use a simplistic metaphor

86
0:04:08.452,000 --> 0:04:1,000
to explain to you this complicated concept.

87
0:04:10.578,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Imagine that the locomotor system is a car.

88
0:04:15.344,000 --> 0:04:17,000
The engine is the spinal cord.

89
0:04:17.59,000 --> 0:04:2,000
The transmission is interrupted. The engine is turned off.

90
0:04:20.848,000 --> 0:04:23,000
How could we re-engage the engine?

91
0:04:23.855,000 --> 0:04:26,000
First, we have to provide the fuel;

92
0:04:26.997,000 --> 0:04:28,000
second, press the accelerator pedal;

93
0:04:29.34,000 --> 0:04:3,000
third, steer the car.

94
0:04:31.278,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It turned out that there are known neural pathways

95
0:04:33.04,000 --> 0:04:35,000
coming from the brain that play this very function

96
0:04:35.994,000 --> 0:04:36,000
during locomotion.

97
0:04:37.376,000 --> 0:04:39,000
My idea: Replace this missing input

98
0:04:40.091,000 --> 0:04:41,000
to provide the spinal cord

99
0:04:41.493,000 --> 0:04:42,000
with the kind of intervention

100
0:04:42.889,000 --> 0:04:46,000
that the brain would deliver naturally in order to walk.

101
0:04:47.619,000 --> 0:04:51,000
For this, I leveraged 20 years of past research in neuroscience,

102
0:04:52.058,000 --> 0:04:54,000
first to replace the missing fuel

103
0:04:54.822,000 --> 0:04:56,000
with pharmacological agents

104
0:04:56.89,000 --> 0:04:59,000
that prepare the neurons in the spinal cord to fire,

105
0:05:00.37,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and second, to mimic the accelerator pedal

106
0:05:04.425,000 --> 0:05:05,000
with electrical stimulation.

107
0:05:05.905,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So here imagine an electrode

108
0:05:08.074,000 --> 0:05:1,000
implanted on the back of the spinal cord

109
0:05:10.48,000 --> 0:05:12,000
to deliver painless stimulation.

110
0:05:12.742,000 --> 0:05:14,000
It took many years, but eventually we developed

111
0:05:15.574,000 --> 0:05:17,000
an electrochemical neuroprosthesis

112
0:05:18.131,000 --> 0:05:19,000
that transformed the neural network

113
0:05:19.897,000 --> 0:05:24,000
in the spinal cord from dormant to a highly functional state.

114
0:05:24.903,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Immediately, the paralyzed rat can stand.

115
0:05:31.183,000 --> 0:05:33,000
As soon as the treadmill belt starts moving,

116
0:05:33.51,000 --> 0:05:36,000
the animal shows coordinated movement of the leg,

117
0:05:37.316,000 --> 0:05:38,000
but without the brain.

118
0:05:39.294,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Here what I call "the spinal brain"

119
0:05:41.284,000 --> 0:05:44,000
cognitively processes sensory information

120
0:05:44.406,000 --> 0:05:45,000
arising from the moving leg

121
0:05:46.301,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and makes decisions as to how to activate the muscle

122
0:05:49.996,000 --> 0:05:52,000
in order to stand, to walk, to run,

123
0:05:53.386,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and even here, while sprinting,

124
0:05:55.498,000 --> 0:05:57,000
instantly stand

125
0:05:57.795,000 --> 0:05:59,000
if the treadmill stops moving.

126
0:06:00.258,000 --> 0:06:01,000
This was amazing.

127
0:06:01.595,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I was completely fascinated by this locomotion

128
0:06:04.982,000 --> 0:06:06,000
without the brain,

129
0:06:07.477,000 --> 0:06:1,000
but at the same time so frustrated.

130
0:06:11.132,000 --> 0:06:13,000
This locomotion was completely involuntary.

131
0:06:13.525,000 --> 0:06:16,000
The animal had virtually no control over the legs.

132
0:06:16.89,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Clearly, the steering system was missing.

133
0:06:21.01,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And it then became obvious from me

134
0:06:22.902,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that we had to move away

135
0:06:24.25,000 --> 0:06:27,000
from the classical rehabilitation paradigm,

136
0:06:27.622,000 --> 0:06:28,000
stepping on a treadmill,

137
0:06:29.344,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and develop conditions that would encourage

138
0:06:32.564,000 --> 0:06:37,000
the brain to begin voluntary control over the leg.

139
0:06:37.797,000 --> 0:06:4,000
With this in mind, we developed a completely new

140
0:06:41.182,000 --> 0:06:44,000
robotic system to support the rat

141
0:06:44.412,000 --> 0:06:46,000
in any direction of space.

142
0:06:46.938,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Imagine, this is really cool.

143
0:06:49.113,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So imagine the little 200-gram rat

144
0:06:52.944,000 --> 0:06:55,000
attached at the extremity of this 200-kilo robot,

145
0:06:56.645,000 --> 0:06:58,000
but the rat does not feel the robot.

146
0:06:59.217,000 --> 0:07:01,000
The robot is transparent,

147
0:07:01.289,000 --> 0:07:03,000
just like you would hold a young child

148
0:07:03.651,000 --> 0:07:05,000
during the first insecure steps.

149
0:07:06.015,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Let me summarize: The rat received

150
0:07:09.569,000 --> 0:07:11,000
a paralyzing lesion of the spinal cord.

151
0:07:12.014,000 --> 0:07:14,000
The electrochemical neuroprosthesis enabled

152
0:07:14.604,000 --> 0:07:18,000
a highly functional state of the spinal locomotor networks.

153
0:07:18.811,000 --> 0:07:21,000
The robot provided the safe environment

154
0:07:22.577,000 --> 0:07:23,000
to allow the rat to attempt anything

155
0:07:24.54,000 --> 0:07:26,000
to engage the paralyzed legs.

156
0:07:27.222,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And for motivation, we used what I think

157
0:07:30.047,000 --> 0:07:33,000
is the most powerful pharmacology of Switzerland:

158
0:07:33.881,000 --> 0:07:35,000
fine Swiss chocolate.

159
0:07:36.188,000 --> 0:07:38,000
(Laughter)

160
0:07:39.11,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Actually, the first results were very, very,

161
0:07:43.673,000 --> 0:07:45,000
very disappointing.

162
0:07:46.308,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Here is my best physical therapist

163
0:07:56.794,000 --> 0:07:58,000
completely failing to encourage the rat

164
0:07:59.384,000 --> 0:08:01,000
to take a single step,

165
0:08:01.445,000 --> 0:08:03,000
whereas the same rat, five minutes earlier,

166
0:08:04.291,000 --> 0:08:06,000
walked beautifully on the treadmill.

167
0:08:06.597,000 --> 0:08:08,000
We were so frustrated.

168
0:08:08.754,000 --> 0:08:1,000
But you know, one of the most essential qualities

169
0:08:11.653,000 --> 0:08:13,000
of a scientist is perseverance.

170
0:08:14.129,000 --> 0:08:17,000
We insisted. We refined our paradigm,

171
0:08:17.545,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and after several months of training,

172
0:08:19.808,000 --> 0:08:22,000
the otherwise paralyzed rat could stand,

173
0:08:23.614,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and whenever she decided,

174
0:08:25.426,000 --> 0:08:27,000
initiated full weight-bearing locomotion

175
0:08:27.758,000 --> 0:08:3,000
to sprint towards the rewards.

176
0:08:31.008,000 --> 0:08:34,000
This is the first recovery ever observed

177
0:08:34.413,000 --> 0:08:35,000
of voluntary leg movement

178
0:08:36.307,000 --> 0:08:38,000
after an experimental lesion of the spinal cord

179
0:08:38.761,000 --> 0:08:41,000
leading to complete and permanent paralysis.

180
0:08:42.222,000 --> 0:08:43,000
In fact --

181
0:08:44.209,000 --> 0:08:45,000
(Applause)

182
0:08:45.929,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Thank you.

183
0:08:50.308,000 --> 0:08:53,000
In fact, not only could the rat initiate

184
0:08:53.402,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and sustain locomotion on the ground,

185
0:08:56.079,000 --> 0:08:58,000
they could even adjust leg movement,

186
0:08:58.36,000 --> 0:09:,000
for example, to resist gravity

187
0:09:00.716,000 --> 0:09:02,000
in order to climb a staircase.

188
0:09:03.34,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I can promise you this was

189
0:09:05.29,000 --> 0:09:08,000
such an emotional moment in my laboratory.

190
0:09:08.399,000 --> 0:09:1,000
It took us 10 years of hard work

191
0:09:11.142,000 --> 0:09:13,000
to reach this goal.

192
0:09:13.593,000 --> 0:09:15,000
But the remaining question was, how?

193
0:09:16.144,000 --> 0:09:17,000
I mean, how is it possible?

194
0:09:17.836,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And here, what we found

195
0:09:19.514,000 --> 0:09:22,000
was completely unexpected.

196
0:09:23.19,000 --> 0:09:27,000
This novel training paradigm

197
0:09:27.348,000 --> 0:09:3,000
encouraged the brain to create new connections,

198
0:09:31.019,000 --> 0:09:33,000
some relay circuits

199
0:09:33.921,000 --> 0:09:36,000
that relay information from the brain

200
0:09:36.969,000 --> 0:09:39,000
past the injury and restore cortical control

201
0:09:40.125,000 --> 0:09:43,000
over the locomotor networks below the injury.

202
0:09:43.566,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And here, you can see one such example,

203
0:09:46.488,000 --> 0:09:49,000
where we label the fibers coming from the brain in red.

204
0:09:49.851,000 --> 0:09:52,000
This blue neuron is connected with the locomotor center,

205
0:09:53.271,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and what this constellation

206
0:09:55.634,000 --> 0:09:57,000
of synaptic contacts means

207
0:09:57.985,000 --> 0:10:,000
is that the brain is reconnected with the locomotor center

208
0:10:01.784,000 --> 0:10:04,000
with only one relay neuron.

209
0:10:05.782,000 --> 0:10:06,000
But the remodeling was not restricted

210
0:10:07.713,000 --> 0:10:08,000
to the lesion area.

211
0:10:08.8,000 --> 0:10:11,000
It occurred throughout the central nervous system,

212
0:10:12.089,000 --> 0:10:14,000
including in the brain stem,

213
0:10:14.407,000 --> 0:10:17,000
where we observed up to 300-percent increase

214
0:10:17.669,000 --> 0:10:2,000
in the density of fibers coming from the brain.

215
0:10:21.428,000 --> 0:10:24,000
We did not aim to repair the spinal cord,

216
0:10:24.955,000 --> 0:10:26,000
yet we were able to promote

217
0:10:27.552,000 --> 0:10:29,000
one of the more extensive remodeling

218
0:10:29.709,000 --> 0:10:31,000
of axonal projections ever observed

219
0:10:32.178,000 --> 0:10:34,000
in the central nervous system of adult mammal

220
0:10:34.439,000 --> 0:10:36,000
after an injury.

221
0:10:36.984,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And there is a very important message

222
0:10:42.053,000 --> 0:10:46,000
hidden behind this discovery.

223
0:10:46.496,000 --> 0:10:49,000
They are the result of a young team

224
0:10:49.718,000 --> 0:10:51,000
of very talented people:

225
0:10:52.11,000 --> 0:10:56,000
physical therapists, neurobiologists, neurosurgeons,

226
0:10:56.568,000 --> 0:10:58,000
engineers of all kinds,

227
0:10:58.767,000 --> 0:10:59,000
who have achieved together

228
0:11:00.558,000 --> 0:11:03,000
what would have been impossible by single individuals.

229
0:11:04.201,000 --> 0:11:07,000
This is truly a trans-disciplinary team.

230
0:11:07.284,000 --> 0:11:09,000
They are working so close to each other

231
0:11:09.472,000 --> 0:11:12,000
that there is horizontal transfer of DNA.

232
0:11:12.663,000 --> 0:11:13,000
We are creating the next generation

233
0:11:14.286,000 --> 0:11:16,000
of M.D.'s and engineers

234
0:11:16.527,000 --> 0:11:18,000
capable of translating discoveries all the way

235
0:11:18.971,000 --> 0:11:2,000
from bench to bedside.

236
0:11:21.643,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And me?

237
0:11:23.649,000 --> 0:11:27,000
I am only the maestro who orchestrated this beautiful symphony.

238
0:11:28.196,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Now, I am sure you are all wondering, aren't you,

239
0:11:34.999,000 --> 0:11:37,000
will this help injured people?

240
0:11:38.763,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Me too, every day.

241
0:11:42.655,000 --> 0:11:45,000
The truth is that we don't know enough yet.

242
0:11:46.068,000 --> 0:11:5,000
This is certainly not a cure for spinal cord injury,

243
0:11:50.292,000 --> 0:11:52,000
but I begin to believe that this may lead

244
0:11:53.026,000 --> 0:11:55,000
to an intervention to improve recovery

245
0:11:55.593,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and people's quality of life.

246
0:11:58.78,000 --> 0:12:,000
I would like you all

247
0:12:01.269,000 --> 0:12:04,000
to take a moment and dream with me.

248
0:12:04.896,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Imagine a person just suffered a spinal cord injury.

249
0:12:10.791,000 --> 0:12:13,000
After a few weeks of recovery,

250
0:12:13.946,000 --> 0:12:15,000
we will implant a programmable pump

251
0:12:16.306,000 --> 0:12:19,000
to deliver a personalized pharmacological cocktail

252
0:12:19.339,000 --> 0:12:21,000
directly to the spinal cord.

253
0:12:21.781,000 --> 0:12:24,000
At the same time, we will implant an electrode array,

254
0:12:25.044,000 --> 0:12:27,000
a sort of second skin

255
0:12:27.151,000 --> 0:12:3,000
covering the area of the spinal cord controlling leg movement,

256
0:12:30.711,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and this array is attached to an electrical pulse generator

257
0:12:33.977,000 --> 0:12:35,000
that delivers stimulations that are tailored

258
0:12:36.439,000 --> 0:12:38,000
to the person's needs.

259
0:12:38.625,000 --> 0:12:42,000
This defines a personalized electrochemical neuroprosthesis

260
0:12:43.483,000 --> 0:12:45,000
that will enable locomotion

261
0:12:46.234,000 --> 0:12:5,000
during training with a newly designed supporting system.

262
0:12:50.281,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And my hope is that after several months of training,

263
0:12:53.564,000 --> 0:12:55,000
there may be enough remodeling of residual connection

264
0:12:55.727,000 --> 0:12:58,000
to allow locomotion without the robot,

265
0:12:59.396,000 --> 0:13:02,000
maybe even without pharmacology or stimulation.

266
0:13:03.174,000 --> 0:13:05,000
My hope here is to be able to create

267
0:13:05.708,000 --> 0:13:07,000
the personalized condition

268
0:13:07.973,000 --> 0:13:09,000
to boost the plasticity of the brain

269
0:13:10.636,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and the spinal cord.

270
0:13:12.167,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And this is a radically new concept

271
0:13:14.906,000 --> 0:13:17,000
that may apply to other neurological disorders,

272
0:13:18.199,000 --> 0:13:22,000
what I termed "personalized neuroprosthetics,"

273
0:13:22.737,000 --> 0:13:25,000
where by sensing and stimulating neural interfaces,

274
0:13:25.761,000 --> 0:13:28,000
I implanted throughout the nervous system,

275
0:13:29.475,000 --> 0:13:32,000
in the brain, in the spinal cord,

276
0:13:32.816,000 --> 0:13:34,000
even in peripheral nerves,

277
0:13:35.572,000 --> 0:13:38,000
based on patient-specific impairments.

278
0:13:38.739,000 --> 0:13:42,000
But not to replace the lost function, no --

279
0:13:43.347,000 --> 0:13:46,000
to help the brain help itself.

280
0:13:46.538,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And I hope this enticed your imagination,

281
0:13:49.178,000 --> 0:13:5,000
because I can promise to you

282
0:13:51.074,000 --> 0:13:54,000
this is not a matter of whether this revolution will occur,

283
0:13:54.317,000 --> 0:13:55,000
but when.

284
0:13:56.109,000 --> 0:13:58,000
And remember, we are only as great

285
0:13:58.357,000 --> 0:14:01,000
as our imagination, as big as our dream.

286
0:14:01.942,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Thank you.

287
0:14:03.934,000 --> 0:14:07,000
(Applause)

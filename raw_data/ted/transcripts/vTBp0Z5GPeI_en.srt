0:00:16.037,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Today, I'm going to talk to you about sketching electronics.

3
0:00:20.453,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I'm, among several other things, an electrical engineer,

4
0:00:25.821,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and that means that I spend a good amount of time

5
0:00:29.518,000 --> 0:00:33,000
designing and building new pieces of technology,

6
0:00:33.892,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and more specifically designing and building electronics.

7
0:00:38.432,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And what I've found is that the process of designing

8
0:00:42.79,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and building electronics is problematic in all sorts of ways.

9
0:00:48.384,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So it's a really slow process, it's really expensive,

10
0:00:53.225,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and the outcome of that process,

11
0:00:55.665,000 --> 0:00:57,000
namely electronic circuit boards,

12
0:00:58.081,000 --> 0:01:01,000
are limited in all sorts of kind of interesting ways.

13
0:01:01.11,000 --> 0:01:04,000
So they're really small, generally, they're square

14
0:01:04.75,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and flat and hard, and frankly, most of them

15
0:01:09.115,000 --> 0:01:13,000
just aren't very attractive, and so my team and I

16
0:01:13.428,000 --> 0:01:16,000
have been thinking of ways to really change and mix up

17
0:01:17.416,000 --> 0:01:21,000
the process and the outcome of designing electronics.

18
0:01:22.077,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And so what if you could design and build electronics

19
0:01:26.165,000 --> 0:01:3,000
like this? So what if you could do it extremely quickly,

20
0:01:30.205,000 --> 0:01:35,000
extremely inexpensively, and maybe more interestingly,

21
0:01:35.87,000 --> 0:01:4,000
really fluidly and expressively and even improvisationally?

22
0:01:41.134,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Wouldn't that be so cool, and that wouldn't that open up

23
0:01:44.456,000 --> 0:01:46,000
all sorts of new possibilities?

24
0:01:46.904,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I'm going to share with you two projects that are

25
0:01:50.288,000 --> 0:01:54,000
investigations along these lines, and we'll start with this one.

26
0:01:54.997,000 --> 0:01:59,000
(Video) Magnetic electronic pieces and ferrous paper.

27
0:02:00.734,000 --> 0:02:03,000
A conductive pen from the Lewis lab at UIUC.

28
0:02:04.566,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Sticker templates.

29
0:02:07.44,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Speed x 4.

30
0:02:25.519,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Making a switch.

31
0:02:37.469,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Music: DJ Shadow.

32
0:02:55.435,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Adding some intelligence with a microcontroller.

33
0:03:11.995,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Sketching an interface.

34
0:03:19.528,000 --> 0:03:26,000
(Music)

35
0:03:28.895,000 --> 0:03:32,000
(Laughter)

36
0:03:33.065,000 --> 0:03:38,000
(Applause)

37
0:03:38.771,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Pretty cool, huh? We think so.

38
0:03:41.768,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So now that we developed these tools

39
0:03:45.552,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and found these materials that let us do these things,

40
0:03:49.29,000 --> 0:03:53,000
we started to realize that, essentially, anything

41
0:03:53.458,000 --> 0:03:55,000
that we can do with paper, anything that we can do

42
0:03:55.842,000 --> 0:03:57,000
with a piece of paper and a pen

43
0:03:58.257,000 --> 0:04:,000
we can now do with electronics.

44
0:04:00.674,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So the next project that I want to show you is kind of a

45
0:04:03.042,000 --> 0:04:06,000
deeper exploration of that possibility.

46
0:04:06.602,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And I'll kind of let it speak for itself.

47
0:04:10.466,000 --> 0:05:4,000
(Music)

48
0:05:40.912,000 --> 0:05:45,000
(Applause)

49
0:05:46.28,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So the next step for us in this process

50
0:05:51.08,000 --> 0:05:54,000
is now to find a way to let all of you

51
0:05:54.808,000 --> 0:05:56,000
build things like this,

52
0:05:57.704,000 --> 0:06:,000
and so the way that we're approaching that is by

53
0:06:00.784,000 --> 0:06:02,000
teaching workshops to people where we explain

54
0:06:03.391,000 --> 0:06:06,000
how they can use these kinds of tools, and then also

55
0:06:06.504,000 --> 0:06:09,000
working to get the tools and the materials and techniques

56
0:06:10.246,000 --> 0:06:13,000
out into the real world in a variety of ways.

57
0:06:13.996,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And so sometime soon, you'll be able to play and build

58
0:06:17.58,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and sketch with electronics in this fundamentally new way.

59
0:06:21.374,000 --> 0:06:25,000
So thank you very much. (Applause)

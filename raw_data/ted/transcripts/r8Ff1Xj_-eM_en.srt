1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
All human life,

2
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
all life, depends on plants.

3
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Let me try to convince you of that in a few seconds.

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Just think for a moment.

5
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It doesn't matter whether you live in a small African village,

6
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
or you live in a big city,

7
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
everything comes back to plants in the end:

8
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
whether it's for the food, the medicine,

9
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
the fuel, the construction, the clothing, all the obvious things;

10
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
or whether it's for the spiritual and recreational things

11
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
that matter to us so much;

12
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
or whether it's soil formation,

13
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
or the effect on the atmosphere,

14
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
or primary production.

15
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Damn it, even the books here are made out of plants.

16
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
All these things, they come back to plants.

17
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And without them we wouldn't be here.

18
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Now plants are under threat.

19
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
They're under threat because of changing climate.

20
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And they are also under threat because they are sharing a planet

21
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
with people like us.

22
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And people like us want to do things that destroy plants,

23
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and their habitats.

24
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And whether that's because of food production,

25
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
or because of the introduction of alien plants

26
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
into places that they really oughtn't be,

27
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
or because of habitats being used for other purposes --

28
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
all these things are meaning that plants have to adapt,

29
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
or die, or move.

30
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And plants sometimes find it rather difficult to move

31
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
because there might be cities and other things in the way.

32
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So if all human life depends on plants,

33
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
doesn't it make sense that perhaps we should try to save them?

34
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I think it does.

35
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And I want to tell you about a project to save plants.

36
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And the way that you save plants

37
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
is by storing seeds.

38
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Because seeds, in all their diverse glory,

39
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
are plants' futures.

40
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
All the genetic information for future generations of plants

41
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
are held in seeds.

42
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So here is the building;

43
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
it looks rather unassuming, really.

44
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
But it goes down below ground many stories.

45
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And it's the largest seed bank in the world.

46
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
It exists not only in southern England,

47
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
but distributed around the world. I'll come to that.

48
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
This is a nuclear-proof facility.

49
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
God forbid that it should have to withstand that.

50
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So if you're going to build a seed bank, you have to decide

51
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
what you're going to store in it. Right?

52
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And we decided that what we want to store first of all,

53
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
are the species that are most under threat.

54
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And those are the dry land species.

55
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So first of all we did deals

56
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
with 50 different countries.

57
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
It means negotiating with heads of state,

58
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and with secretaries of state in 50 countries

59
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
to sign treaties.

60
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
We have 120 partner institutions all over the world,

61
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
in all those countries colored orange.

62
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
People come from all over the world to learn,

63
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and then they go away and plan exactly how

64
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
they're going to collect these seeds.

65
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
They have thousands of people all over the world

66
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
tagging places where those plants are said to exist.

67
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
They search for them. They find them in flower.

68
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And they go back when their seeds have arrived.

69
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And they collect the seeds. All over the world.

70
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
The seeds -- some of if is very untechnical.

71
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
You kind of shovel them all in to bags and dry them off.

72
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
You label them. You do some high-tech things here and there,

73
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
some low-tech things here and there.

74
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And the main thing is that you have to dry them

75
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
very carefully, at low temperature.

76
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And then you have to store them

77
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
at about minus 20 degrees C --

78
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
that's about minus four Fahrenheit, I think --

79
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
with a very critically low moisture content.

80
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And these seeds will be able to germinate,

81
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
we believe, with many of the species,

82
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
in thousands of years,

83
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and certainly in hundreds of years.

84
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
It's no good storing the seeds if you don't know they're still viable.

85
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So every 10 years we do germination tests

86
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
on every sample of seeds that we have.

87
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And this is a distributed network.

88
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So all around the world people are doing the same thing.

89
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And that enables us to develop germination protocols.

90
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
That means that we know the right combination of heat

91
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and cold and the cycles that you have to get

92
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
to make the seed germinate.

93
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And that is very useful information.

94
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And then we grow these things,

95
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and we tell people, back in the countries where these seeds have come from,

96
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
"Look, actually we're not just storing this

97
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to get the seeds later,

98
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
but we can give you this information about

99
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
how to germinate these difficult plants."

100
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And that's already happening.

101
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So where have we got to?

102
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I am pleased to unveil that our three billionth seed --

103
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that's three thousand millionth seed --

104
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
is now stored.

105
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Ten percent of all plant species on the planet,

106
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
24,000 species are safe;

107
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
30,000 species, if we get the funding, by next year.

108
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Twenty-five percent of all the world's plants, by 2020.

109
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
These are not just crop plants,

110
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
as you might have seen stored in Svalbard in Norway --

111
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
fantastic work there.

112
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
This is at least 100 times bigger.

113
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
We have thousands of collections that have been sent out

114
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
all over the world:

115
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
drought-tolerant forest species sent to Pakistan and Egypt;

116
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
especially photosynthetic-efficient plants

117
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
come here to the United States;

118
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
salt-tolerant pasture species sent to Australia;

119
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
the list goes on and on.

120
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
These seeds are used for restoration.

121
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So in habitats that have already been damaged,

122
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
like the tall grass prairie here in the USA,

123
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
or in mined land in various countries,

124
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
restoration is already happening because of these species --

125
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and because of this collection.

126
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Some of these plants, like the ones on the bottom

127
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
to the left of your screen,

128
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
they are down to the last few remaining members.

129
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
The one where the guy is collecting seeds there on the truck,

130
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that is down to about 30 last remaining trees.

131
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Fantastically useful plant,

132
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
both for protein and for medicine.

133
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
We have training going on in China, in the USA,

134
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and many other countries.

135
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
How much does it cost?

136
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
2,800 dollars per species is the average.

137
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I think that's cheap, at the price.

138
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And that gets you all the scientific data

139
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
that goes with it.

140
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
The future research is "How can we find

141
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
the genetic and molecular markers

142
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
for the viability of seeds,

143
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
without having to plant them every 10 years?"

144
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And we're almost there.

145
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Thank you very much.

146
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
(Applause)

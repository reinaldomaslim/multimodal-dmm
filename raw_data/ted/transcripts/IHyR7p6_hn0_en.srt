1
0:00:16.061,000 --> 0:00:19,000
There have been many revolutions over the last century,

2
0:00:19.457,000 --> 0:00:23,000
but perhaps none as significant as the longevity revolution.

3
0:00:24.502,000 --> 0:00:28,000
We are living on average today 34 years longer

4
0:00:28.876,000 --> 0:00:3,000
than our great-grandparents did -- think about that.

5
0:00:31.378,000 --> 0:00:34,000
That's an entire second adult lifetime

6
0:00:34.656,000 --> 0:00:35,000
that's been added to our lifespan.

7
0:00:36.994,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And yet, for the most part,

8
0:00:38.365,000 --> 0:00:41,000
our culture has not come to terms with what this means.

9
0:00:41.76,000 --> 0:00:43,000
We're still living with the old paradigm

10
0:00:44.549,000 --> 0:00:45,000
of age as an arch.

11
0:00:46.55,000 --> 0:00:47,000
That's the metaphor, the old metaphor.

12
0:00:48.49,000 --> 0:00:5,000
You're born, you peak at midlife

13
0:00:50.624,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and decline into decrepitude.

14
0:00:52.76,000 --> 0:00:53,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:54.457,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Age as pathology.

16
0:00:57.464,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But many people today -- philosophers, artists, doctors, scientists --

17
0:01:01.76,000 --> 0:01:04,000
are taking a new look at what I call "the third act" --

18
0:01:05.108,000 --> 0:01:07,000
the last three decades of life.

19
0:01:07.624,000 --> 0:01:12,000
They realize that this is actually a developmental stage of life

20
0:01:12.76,000 --> 0:01:14,000
with its own significance,

21
0:01:15.174,000 --> 0:01:2,000
as different from midlife as adolescence is from childhood.

22
0:01:20.992,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And they are asking -- we should all be asking:

23
0:01:24.369,000 --> 0:01:26,000
How do we use this time?

24
0:01:26.944,000 --> 0:01:27,000
How do we live it successfully?

25
0:01:28.896,000 --> 0:01:31,000
What is the appropriate new metaphor for aging?

26
0:01:32.854,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I've spent the last year researching and writing about this subject.

27
0:01:36.489,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And I have come to find that a more appropriate metaphor for aging

28
0:01:41.76,000 --> 0:01:42,000
is a staircase --

29
0:01:44.331,000 --> 0:01:47,000
the upward ascension of the human spirit,

30
0:01:47.442,000 --> 0:01:51,000
bringing us into wisdom, wholeness, and authenticity.

31
0:01:51.76,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Age not at all as pathology.

32
0:01:54.093,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Age as potential.

33
0:01:55.76,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And guess what?

34
0:01:57.203,000 --> 0:01:59,000
This potential is not for the lucky few.

35
0:01:59.867,000 --> 0:02:02,000
It turns out, most people over 50

36
0:02:03.96,000 --> 0:02:07,000
feel better, are less stressed, less hostile, less anxious.

37
0:02:08.271,000 --> 0:02:11,000
We tend to see commonalities more than differences.

38
0:02:11.761,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Some of the studies even say we're happier.

39
0:02:14.595,000 --> 0:02:15,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:15.649,000 --> 0:02:17,000
This is not what I expected, trust me.

41
0:02:18.393,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I come from a long line of depressives.

42
0:02:21.188,000 --> 0:02:23,000
As I was approaching my late 40s,

43
0:02:23.532,000 --> 0:02:24,000
when I would wake up in the morning,

44
0:02:25.349,000 --> 0:02:27,000
my first six thoughts would all be negative.

45
0:02:27.804,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And I got scared.

46
0:02:28.99,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I thought, "Oh my gosh. I'm going to become a crotchety old lady."

47
0:02:32.76,000 --> 0:02:36,000
But now that I am actually smack-dab in the middle of my own third act,

48
0:02:37.325,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I realize I've never been happier.

49
0:02:40.402,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I have such a powerful feeling of well-being.

50
0:02:44.784,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And I've discovered

51
0:02:46.636,000 --> 0:02:47,000
that when you're inside oldness,

52
0:02:48.637,000 --> 0:02:5,000
as opposed to looking at it from the outside,

53
0:02:51.014,000 --> 0:02:52,000
fear subsides.

54
0:02:52.308,000 --> 0:02:54,000
You realize you're still yourself --

55
0:02:54.664,000 --> 0:02:55,000
maybe even more so.

56
0:02:56.53,000 --> 0:03:,000
Picasso once said, "It takes a long time to become young."

57
0:03:00.774,000 --> 0:03:02,000
(Laughter)

58
0:03:02.966,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I don't want to romanticize aging.

59
0:03:04.84,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Obviously, there's no guarantee

60
0:03:06.539,000 --> 0:03:08,000
that it can be a time of fruition and growth.

61
0:03:09.681,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Some of it is a matter of luck.

62
0:03:11.365,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Some of it, obviously, is genetic.

63
0:03:13.929,000 --> 0:03:15,000
One third of it, in fact, is genetic.

64
0:03:16.077,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And there isn't much we can do about that.

65
0:03:18.815,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But that means that two-thirds of how well we do in the third act,

66
0:03:23.734,000 --> 0:03:24,000
we can do something about.

67
0:03:26.241,000 --> 0:03:28,000
We're going to discuss what we can do

68
0:03:28.531,000 --> 0:03:3,000
to make these added years really successful,

69
0:03:31.958,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and use them to make a difference.

70
0:03:35.108,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Now, let me say something about the staircase,

71
0:03:37.324,000 --> 0:03:41,000
which may seem like an odd metaphor for seniors,

72
0:03:41.365,000 --> 0:03:43,000
given the fact that many seniors are challenged by stairs.

73
0:03:44.352,000 --> 0:03:45,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:45.69,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Myself included.

75
0:03:49.148,000 --> 0:03:54,000
As you may know, the entire world operates on a universal law:

76
0:03:54.403,000 --> 0:03:57,000
entropy, the second law of thermodynamics.

77
0:03:57.934,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Entropy means that everything in the world -- everything --

78
0:04:00.847,000 --> 0:04:02,000
is in a state of decline and decay --

79
0:04:03.033,000 --> 0:04:04,000
the arch.

80
0:04:04.649,000 --> 0:04:07,000
There's only one exception to this universal law,

81
0:04:08.448,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and that is the human spirit,

82
0:04:10.64,000 --> 0:04:14,000
which can continue to evolve upwards, the staircase,

83
0:04:14.736,000 --> 0:04:18,000
bringing us into wholeness, authenticity, and wisdom.

84
0:04:19.664,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And here's an example of what I mean.

85
0:04:22.179,000 --> 0:04:24,000
This upward ascension

86
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
can happen even in the face of extreme physical challenges.

87
0:04:27.819,000 --> 0:04:31,000
About three years ago, I read an article in the New York Times.

88
0:04:32.132,000 --> 0:04:34,000
It was about a man named Neil Selinger --

89
0:04:34.196,000 --> 0:04:36,000
57 years old, a retired lawyer,

90
0:04:36.898,000 --> 0:04:39,000
who had joined the writers' group at Sarah Lawrence,

91
0:04:39.997,000 --> 0:04:41,000
where he found his writer's voice.

92
0:04:42.836,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Two years later,

93
0:04:44.077,000 --> 0:04:48,000
he was diagnosed with ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease.

94
0:04:48.427,000 --> 0:04:5,000
It's a terrible disease. It's fatal.

95
0:04:50.814,000 --> 0:04:53,000
It wastes the body, but the mind remains intact.

96
0:04:54.887,000 --> 0:04:56,000
In this article, Mr. Selinger wrote the following

97
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
to describe what was happening to him.

98
0:05:01.529,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And I quote:

99
0:05:03.632,000 --> 0:05:04,000
"As my muscles weakened,

100
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
my writing became stronger.

101
0:05:08.99,000 --> 0:05:1,000
As I slowly lost my speech,

102
0:05:11.972,000 --> 0:05:12,000
I gained my voice.

103
0:05:14.466,000 --> 0:05:16,000
As I diminished, I grew.

104
0:05:17.14,000 --> 0:05:18,000
As I lost so much,

105
0:05:19.001,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I finally started to find myself."

106
0:05:23.692,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Neil Selinger, to me,

107
0:05:24.968,000 --> 0:05:27,000
is the embodiment of mounting the staircase

108
0:05:28.373,000 --> 0:05:29,000
in his third act.

109
0:05:30.902,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Now we're all born with spirit, all of us,

110
0:05:33.664,000 --> 0:05:37,000
but sometimes it gets tamped down beneath the challenges of life,

111
0:05:37.832,000 --> 0:05:38,000
violence, abuse, neglect.

112
0:05:40.767,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Perhaps our parents suffered from depression.

113
0:05:43.371,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Perhaps they weren't able to love us beyond how we performed in the world.

114
0:05:49.196,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Perhaps we still suffer from a psychic pain, a wound.

115
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Perhaps we feel that many of our relationships

116
0:05:55.849,000 --> 0:05:56,000
have not had closure.

117
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And so we can feel unfinished.

118
0:06:00.823,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Perhaps the task of the third act

119
0:06:04.391,000 --> 0:06:07,000
is to finish up the task of finishing ourselves.

120
0:06:08.665,000 --> 0:06:13,000
For me, it began as I was approaching my third act, my 60th birthday.

121
0:06:14.902,000 --> 0:06:15,000
How was I supposed to live it?

122
0:06:16.823,000 --> 0:06:18,000
What was I supposed to accomplish in this final act?

123
0:06:19.759,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And I realized that, in order to know where I was going,

124
0:06:23.942,000 --> 0:06:24,000
I had to know where I'd been.

125
0:06:26.109,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And so I went back and I studied my first two acts,

126
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
trying to see who I was then,

127
0:06:32.907,000 --> 0:06:37,000
who I really was, not who my parents or other people told me I was,

128
0:06:38.374,000 --> 0:06:39,000
or treated me like I was.

129
0:06:40.024,000 --> 0:06:41,000
But who was I?

130
0:06:41.216,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Who were my parents -- not as parents, but as people?

131
0:06:45.013,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Who were my grandparents?

132
0:06:46.742,000 --> 0:06:47,000
How did they treat my parents?

133
0:06:48.532,000 --> 0:06:49,000
These kinds of things.

134
0:06:52.565,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I discovered, a couple of years later,

135
0:06:55.199,000 --> 0:06:57,000
that this process that I had gone through

136
0:06:58.2,000 --> 0:07:01,000
is called by psychologists "doing a life review."

137
0:07:01.964,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And they say it can give new significance and clarity and meaning

138
0:07:05.854,000 --> 0:07:06,000
to a person's life.

139
0:07:07.95,000 --> 0:07:09,000
You may discover, as I did,

140
0:07:10.646,000 --> 0:07:12,000
that a lot of things that you used to think were your fault,

141
0:07:14.586,000 --> 0:07:16,000
a lot of things you used to think about yourself,

142
0:07:17.395,000 --> 0:07:19,000
really had nothing to do with you.

143
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
It wasn't your fault; you're just fine.

144
0:07:23.54,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And you're able to go back and forgive them.

145
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And forgive yourself.

146
0:07:29.219,000 --> 0:07:31,000
You're able to free yourself

147
0:07:32.406,000 --> 0:07:33,000
from your past.

148
0:07:34.172,000 --> 0:07:37,000
You can work to change your relationship to your past.

149
0:07:38.394,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Now while I was writing about this,

150
0:07:40.321,000 --> 0:07:43,000
I came upon a book called "Man's Search for Meaning"

151
0:07:43.557,000 --> 0:07:44,000
by Viktor Frankl.

152
0:07:45.082,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Viktor Frankl was a German psychiatrist

153
0:07:47.681,000 --> 0:07:49,000
who'd spent five years in a Nazi concentration camp.

154
0:07:50.982,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And he wrote that, while he was in the camp,

155
0:07:53.934,000 --> 0:07:56,000
he could tell, should they ever be released,

156
0:07:57.411,000 --> 0:08:01,000
which of the people would be OK, and which would not.

157
0:08:02.22,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And he wrote this:

158
0:08:07.375,000 --> 0:08:09,000
"Everything you have in life can be taken from you

159
0:08:10.048,000 --> 0:08:11,000
except one thing:

160
0:08:12.164,000 --> 0:08:16,000
your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation.

161
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
This is what determines the quality of the life we've lived --

162
0:08:21.934,000 --> 0:08:23,000
not whether we've been rich or poor,

163
0:08:24.014,000 --> 0:08:25,000
famous or unknown,

164
0:08:25.77,000 --> 0:08:26,000
healthy or suffering.

165
0:08:27.974,000 --> 0:08:32,000
What determines our quality of life is how we relate to these realities,

166
0:08:33.647,000 --> 0:08:35,000
what kind of meaning we assign them,

167
0:08:35.823,000 --> 0:08:38,000
what kind of attitude we cling to about them,

168
0:08:39.014,000 --> 0:08:41,000
what state of mind we allow them to trigger."

169
0:08:43.006,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Perhaps the central purpose of the third act

170
0:08:45.713,000 --> 0:08:48,000
is to go back and to try, if appropriate,

171
0:08:49.714,000 --> 0:08:52,000
to change our relationship to the past.

172
0:08:53.974,000 --> 0:08:56,000
It turns out that cognitive research shows

173
0:08:57.18,000 --> 0:08:58,000
when we are able to do this,

174
0:08:58.984,000 --> 0:09:,000
it manifests neurologically --

175
0:09:01.587,000 --> 0:09:04,000
neural pathways are created in the brain.

176
0:09:04.704,000 --> 0:09:05,000
You see, if you have, over time,

177
0:09:06.705,000 --> 0:09:09,000
reacted negatively to past events and people,

178
0:09:10.132,000 --> 0:09:12,000
neural pathways are laid down

179
0:09:12.438,000 --> 0:09:15,000
by chemical and electrical signals that are sent through the brain.

180
0:09:16.236,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And over time, these neural pathways become hardwired.

181
0:09:19.73,000 --> 0:09:21,000
They become the norm -- even if it's bad for us,

182
0:09:22.58,000 --> 0:09:24,000
because it causes us stress and anxiety.

183
0:09:26.189,000 --> 0:09:27,000
If, however,

184
0:09:27.673,000 --> 0:09:3,000
we can go back and alter our relationship,

185
0:09:31.433,000 --> 0:09:35,000
re-vision our relationship to past people and events,

186
0:09:35.753,000 --> 0:09:36,000
neural pathways can change.

187
0:09:37.726,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And if we can maintain the more positive feelings

188
0:09:41.708,000 --> 0:09:42,000
about the past,

189
0:09:42.889,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that becomes the new norm.

190
0:09:44.715,000 --> 0:09:46,000
It's like resetting a thermostat.

191
0:09:48.132,000 --> 0:09:51,000
It's not having experiences

192
0:09:51.22,000 --> 0:09:53,000
that makes us wise.

193
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
It's reflecting on the experiences that we've had that makes us wise

194
0:09:59.553,000 --> 0:10:,000
and that helps us become whole,

195
0:10:01.554,000 --> 0:10:03,000
brings wisdom and authenticity.

196
0:10:03.791,000 --> 0:10:05,000
It helps us become what we might have been.

197
0:10:07.665,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Women start off whole, don't we?

198
0:10:09.926,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I mean, as girls, we're feisty -- "Yeah? Who says?"

199
0:10:12.722,000 --> 0:10:13,000
(Laughter)

200
0:10:13.796,000 --> 0:10:14,000
We have agency.

201
0:10:14.985,000 --> 0:10:16,000
We are the subjects of our own lives.

202
0:10:17.459,000 --> 0:10:18,000
But very often,

203
0:10:18.867,000 --> 0:10:2,000
many, if not most of us, when we hit puberty,

204
0:10:21.476,000 --> 0:10:23,000
we start worrying about fitting in and being popular.

205
0:10:24.839,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And we become the subjects and objects of other people's lives.

206
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
But now, in our third acts,

207
0:10:32.03,000 --> 0:10:36,000
it may be possible for us to circle back to where we started,

208
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and know it for the first time.

209
0:10:40.229,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And if we can do that,

210
0:10:41.666,000 --> 0:10:43,000
it will not just be for ourselves.

211
0:10:44.878,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Older women are the largest demographic in the world.

212
0:10:49.093,000 --> 0:10:52,000
If we can go back and redefine ourselves

213
0:10:52.447,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and become whole,

214
0:10:54.054,000 --> 0:10:57,000
this will create a cultural shift in the world,

215
0:10:58.808,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and it will give an example to younger generations

216
0:11:02.053,000 --> 0:11:04,000
so that they can reconceive their own lifespan.

217
0:11:04.942,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Thank you very much.

218
0:11:06.236,000 --> 0:11:12,000
(Applause)

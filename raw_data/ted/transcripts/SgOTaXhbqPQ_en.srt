1
0:00:12.985,000 --> 0:00:13,000
We see with the eyes,

2
0:00:14.969,000 --> 0:00:16,000
but we see with the brain as well.

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And seeing with the brain is often called imagination.

4
0:00:23.142,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And we are familiar with the landscapes of our own imagination,

5
0:00:27.349,000 --> 0:00:28,000
our inscapes.

6
0:00:28.743,000 --> 0:00:3,000
We've lived with them all our lives.

7
0:00:31.466,000 --> 0:00:34,000
But there are also hallucinations as well.

8
0:00:35.492,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And hallucinations are completely different.

9
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
They don't seem to be of our creation.

10
0:00:40.294,000 --> 0:00:42,000
They don't seem to be under control.

11
0:00:42.358,000 --> 0:00:46,000
They seem to come from the outside and to mimic perception.

12
0:00:47.12,000 --> 0:00:51,000
So I am going to be talking about hallucinations

13
0:00:51.215,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and a particular sort of visual hallucination,

14
0:00:55.818,000 --> 0:00:58,000
which I see among my patients.

15
0:01:00.754,000 --> 0:01:05,000
A few months ago, I got a phone call from a nursing home where I work.

16
0:01:06.656,000 --> 0:01:1,000
They told me that one of their residents, an old lady in her 90s,

17
0:01:11.413,000 --> 0:01:12,000
was seeing things,

18
0:01:13.762,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and they wondered if she'd gone bonkers

19
0:01:16.472,000 --> 0:01:17,000
or, because she was an old lady,

20
0:01:18.042,000 --> 0:01:21,000
whether she'd had a stroke, or whether she had Alzheimer's.

21
0:01:21.354,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And so they asked me if I would come and see Rosalie,

22
0:01:26.638,000 --> 0:01:27,000
the old lady.

23
0:01:28.487,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I went in to see her.

24
0:01:30.518,000 --> 0:01:34,000
It was evident straightaway that she was perfectly sane

25
0:01:35.132,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and lucid and of good intelligence,

26
0:01:38.948,000 --> 0:01:41,000
but she'd been very startled and very bewildered,

27
0:01:42.337,000 --> 0:01:44,000
because she'd been seeing things.

28
0:01:45.832,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And she told me -- the nurses hadn't mentioned this --

29
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that she was blind,

30
0:01:52.46,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that she had been completely blind from macular degeneration for five years.

31
0:01:57.305,000 --> 0:02:,000
But now, for the last few days, she'd been seeing things.

32
0:02:00.879,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So I said, "What sort of things?"

33
0:02:02.9,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And she said, "People in Eastern dress,

34
0:02:06.641,000 --> 0:02:08,000
in drapes, walking up and down stairs.

35
0:02:10.45,000 --> 0:02:13,000
A man who turns towards me and smiles,

36
0:02:13.633,000 --> 0:02:16,000
but he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth.

37
0:02:17.67,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Animals too.

38
0:02:19.757,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I see a white building. It's snowing, a soft snow.

39
0:02:22.789,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I see this horse with a harness, dragging the snow away.

40
0:02:27.687,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Then, one night, the scene changes.

41
0:02:30.986,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I see cats and dogs walking towards me.

42
0:02:33.564,000 --> 0:02:35,000
They come to a certain point and then stop.

43
0:02:36.73,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Then it changes again.

44
0:02:38.317,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I see a lot of children. They're walking up and down stairs.

45
0:02:41.463,000 --> 0:02:43,000
They wear bright colors, rose and blue,

46
0:02:44.424,000 --> 0:02:45,000
like Eastern dress."

47
0:02:47.017,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Sometimes, she said, before the people come on,

48
0:02:50.618,000 --> 0:02:53,000
she may hallucinate pink and blue squares on the floor,

49
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
which seem to go up to the ceiling.

50
0:02:57.016,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I said, "Is this like a dream?"

51
0:03:01.638,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And she said, "No, it's not like a dream. It's like a movie."

52
0:03:05.021,000 --> 0:03:07,000
She said, "It's got color. It's got motion.

53
0:03:07.684,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But it's completely silent, like a silent movie."

54
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And she said it's a rather boring movie.

55
0:03:13.438,000 --> 0:03:14,000
(Laughter)

56
0:03:14.463,000 --> 0:03:16,000
She said, "All these people with Eastern dress,

57
0:03:16.692,000 --> 0:03:19,000
walking up and down, very repetitive, very limited."

58
0:03:20.71,000 --> 0:03:21,000
(Laughter)

59
0:03:22.136,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And she had a sense of humor.

60
0:03:24.931,000 --> 0:03:27,000
She knew it was a hallucination, but she was frightened.

61
0:03:28.257,000 --> 0:03:29,000
She had lived 95 years,

62
0:03:29.645,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and she'd never had a hallucination before.

63
0:03:32.407,000 --> 0:03:37,000
She said that the hallucinations were unrelated to anything she was thinking

64
0:03:37.487,000 --> 0:03:39,000
or feeling or doing,

65
0:03:40.105,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that they seemed to come on by themselves, or disappear.

66
0:03:43.896,000 --> 0:03:45,000
She had no control over them.

67
0:03:46.12,000 --> 0:03:49,000
She said she didn't recognize any of the people or places

68
0:03:49.662,000 --> 0:03:5,000
in the hallucinations,

69
0:03:51.432,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and none of the people or the animals --

70
0:03:53.705,000 --> 0:03:55,000
well, they all seemed oblivious of her.

71
0:03:57.383,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And she didn't know what was going on.

72
0:03:59.424,000 --> 0:04:02,000
She wondered if she was going mad or losing her mind.

73
0:04:03.38,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Well, I examined her carefully.

74
0:04:05.913,000 --> 0:04:07,000
She was a bright old lady,

75
0:04:08.326,000 --> 0:04:09,000
perfectly sane.

76
0:04:09.691,000 --> 0:04:1,000
She had no medical problems.

77
0:04:11.625,000 --> 0:04:14,000
She wasn't on any medications which could produce hallucinations.

78
0:04:15.245,000 --> 0:04:16,000
But she was blind.

79
0:04:17.817,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And I then said to her, "I think I know what you have."

80
0:04:21.644,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I said, "There is a special form of visual hallucination

81
0:04:25.285,000 --> 0:04:28,000
which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness.

82
0:04:29.8,000 --> 0:04:31,000
This was originally described," I said,

83
0:04:32.041,000 --> 0:04:34,000
"right back in the 18th century,

84
0:04:34.287,000 --> 0:04:36,000
by a man called Charles Bonnet.

85
0:04:37.266,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And you have Charles Bonnet syndrome.

86
0:04:40.137,000 --> 0:04:43,000
There's nothing wrong with your brain. There's nothing wrong with your mind.

87
0:04:43.821,000 --> 0:04:44,000
You have Charles Bonnet syndrome."

88
0:04:45.677,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And she was very relieved at this,

89
0:04:48.526,000 --> 0:04:5,000
that there was nothing seriously the matter,

90
0:04:51.296,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and also rather curious.

91
0:04:54.787,000 --> 0:04:56,000
She said, "Who is this Charles Bonnet?"

92
0:04:57.794,000 --> 0:04:58,000
She said, "Did he have them himself?"

93
0:05:00.267,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And she said, "Tell all the nurses that I have Charles Bonnet syndrome."

94
0:05:05.763,000 --> 0:05:06,000
(Laughter)

95
0:05:07.287,000 --> 0:05:11,000
"I'm not crazy. I'm not demented. I have Charles Bonnet syndrome."

96
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Well, so, I did tell the nurses.

97
0:05:14.285,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Now this, for me, is a common situation.

98
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I work in old-age homes, largely.

99
0:05:19.93,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I see a lot of elderly people

100
0:05:22.121,000 --> 0:05:24,000
who are hearing-impaired or visually impaired.

101
0:05:25.102,000 --> 0:05:27,000
About 10 percent of the hearing-impaired people

102
0:05:27.778,000 --> 0:05:29,000
get musical hallucinations.

103
0:05:30.372,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And about 10 percent of the visually impaired people

104
0:05:33.377,000 --> 0:05:34,000
get visual hallucinations.

105
0:05:35.298,000 --> 0:05:37,000
You don't have to be completely blind,

106
0:05:37.583,000 --> 0:05:39,000
only sufficiently impaired.

107
0:05:39.877,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Now, with the original description in the 18th century,

108
0:05:43.788,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Charles Bonnet did not have them.

109
0:05:45.627,000 --> 0:05:47,000
His grandfather had these hallucinations.

110
0:05:48.393,000 --> 0:05:51,000
His grandfather was a magistrate, an elderly man.

111
0:05:51.757,000 --> 0:05:53,000
He'd had cataract surgery.

112
0:05:54.014,000 --> 0:05:56,000
His vision was pretty poor.

113
0:05:56.289,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And in 1759, he described to his grandson

114
0:06:01.478,000 --> 0:06:03,000
various things he was seeing.

115
0:06:03.819,000 --> 0:06:06,000
The first thing he said was he saw a handkerchief in midair.

116
0:06:07.291,000 --> 0:06:1,000
It was a large blue handkerchief with four orange circles.

117
0:06:11.616,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And he knew it was a hallucination.

118
0:06:14.011,000 --> 0:06:16,000
You don't have handkerchiefs in midair.

119
0:06:16.398,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And then he saw a big wheel in midair.

120
0:06:20.487,000 --> 0:06:24,000
But sometimes he wasn't sure whether he was hallucinating or not,

121
0:06:25.461,000 --> 0:06:28,000
because the hallucinations would fit in the context of the visions.

122
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So on one occasion, when his granddaughters were visiting them,

123
0:06:33.005,000 --> 0:06:36,000
he said, "And who are these handsome young men with you?"

124
0:06:36.172,000 --> 0:06:37,000
(Laughter)

125
0:06:37.211,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And they said, "Alas, Grandpapa, there are no handsome young men."

126
0:06:41.869,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And then the handsome young men disappeared.

127
0:06:45.619,000 --> 0:06:47,000
It's typical of these hallucinations

128
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash.

129
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
They don't usually fade in and out.

130
0:06:53.752,000 --> 0:06:56,000
They are rather sudden, and they change suddenly.

131
0:06:57.119,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Charles Lullin, the grandfather,

132
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
saw hundreds of different figures,

133
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
different landscapes of all sorts.

134
0:07:04.795,000 --> 0:07:07,000
On one occasion, he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe,

135
0:07:08.632,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and realized it was himself.

136
0:07:11.466,000 --> 0:07:13,000
That was the only figure he recognized.

137
0:07:14.854,000 --> 0:07:17,000
On one occasion, when he was walking in the streets of Paris,

138
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
he saw -- this was real -- a scaffolding.

139
0:07:21.223,000 --> 0:07:24,000
But when he got back home, he saw a miniature of the scaffolding,

140
0:07:24.761,000 --> 0:07:25,000
six inches high,

141
0:07:26.511,000 --> 0:07:27,000
on his study table.

142
0:07:28.303,000 --> 0:07:32,000
This repetition of perception is sometimes called "palinopsia."

143
0:07:34.605,000 --> 0:07:37,000
With him and with Rosalie,

144
0:07:38.556,000 --> 0:07:39,000
what seems to be going on --

145
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and Rosalie said, "What's going on?" --

146
0:07:42.332,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and I said that as you lose vision,

147
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
as the visual parts of the brain are no longer getting any input,

148
0:07:48.232,000 --> 0:07:51,000
they become hyperactive and excitable,

149
0:07:51.338,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and they start to fire spontaneously.

150
0:07:54.063,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And you start to see things.

151
0:07:56.237,000 --> 0:08:,000
The things you see can be very complicated indeed.

152
0:08:00.791,000 --> 0:08:05,000
With another patient of mine who also had some vision,

153
0:08:06.989,000 --> 0:08:08,000
the visions she had could be disturbing.

154
0:08:09.549,000 --> 0:08:14,000
On one occasion, she said she saw a man in a striped shirt in a restaurant.

155
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And he turned round,

156
0:08:16.48,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and then he divided into six figures in striped shirts,

157
0:08:20.607,000 --> 0:08:22,000
who started walking towards her.

158
0:08:23.041,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And then the six figures came together, like a concertina.

159
0:08:26.474,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Once, when she was driving,

160
0:08:28.22,000 --> 0:08:29,000
or rather, her husband was driving,

161
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
the road divided into four

162
0:08:32.476,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and she felt herself going simultaneously up four roads.

163
0:08:37.019,000 --> 0:08:41,000
She had very mobile hallucinations as well.

164
0:08:41.834,000 --> 0:08:43,000
A lot of them had to do with a car.

165
0:08:44.028,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Sometimes she would see a teenage boy sitting on the hood of the car.

166
0:08:48.882,000 --> 0:08:49,000
He was very tenacious,

167
0:08:50.403,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and he moved rather gracefully when the car turned.

168
0:08:53.727,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And then when they came to a stop,

169
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
the boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff, 100 foot in the air,

170
0:08:59.721,000 --> 0:09:,000
and then disappear.

171
0:09:02.537,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Another patient of mine had a different sort of hallucination.

172
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
This was a woman who didn't have trouble with her eyes

173
0:09:10.071,000 --> 0:09:12,000
but the visual parts of her brain,

174
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
a little tumor in the occipital cortex.

175
0:09:15.842,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And, above all, she would see cartoons.

176
0:09:20.448,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And these cartoons would be transparent,

177
0:09:24.979,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and would cover half the visual field, like a screen.

178
0:09:28.966,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And especially, she saw cartoons of Kermit the Frog.

179
0:09:33.769,000 --> 0:09:34,000
(Laughter)

180
0:09:35.245,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Now, I don't watch Sesame Street,

181
0:09:39.975,000 --> 0:09:4,000
but she made a point of saying,

182
0:09:41.77,000 --> 0:09:44,000
"Why Kermit?" she said, "Kermit the Frog means nothing to me."

183
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
You know, I was wondering about Freudian determinants: Why Kermit?

184
0:09:50.295,000 --> 0:09:52,000
"Kermit the Frog means nothing to me."

185
0:09:52.684,000 --> 0:09:54,000
She didn't mind the cartoons too much.

186
0:09:54.89,000 --> 0:09:55,000
But what did disturb her

187
0:09:56.502,000 --> 0:10:,000
was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces,

188
0:10:01.096,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and as with Rosalie, the faces were often deformed,

189
0:10:04.607,000 --> 0:10:07,000
with very large teeth or very large eyes.

190
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And these frightened her.

191
0:10:11.422,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Well, what is going on with these people?

192
0:10:15.224,000 --> 0:10:18,000
As a physician, I have to try and define what's going on

193
0:10:18.862,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and to reassure people,

194
0:10:20.592,000 --> 0:10:23,000
especially to reassure them that they're not going insane.

195
0:10:25.179,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Something like 10 percent, as I said,

196
0:10:27.428,000 --> 0:10:29,000
of visually impaired people get these.

197
0:10:30.405,000 --> 0:10:33,000
But no more than one percent of the people acknowledge them,

198
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
because they are afraid they will be seen as insane or something.

199
0:10:37.54,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And if they do mention them to their own doctors,

200
0:10:40.012,000 --> 0:10:41,000
they may be misdiagnosed.

201
0:10:42.24,000 --> 0:10:45,000
In particular, the notion is that if you see things or hear things,

202
0:10:45.78,000 --> 0:10:46,000
you're going mad.

203
0:10:47.03,000 --> 0:10:5,000
But the psychotic hallucinations are quite different.

204
0:10:50.079,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Psychotic hallucinations, whether they are visual or vocal,

205
0:10:53.302,000 --> 0:10:54,000
they address you.

206
0:10:54.502,000 --> 0:10:58,000
They accuse you, they seduce you, they humiliate you, they jeer at you.

207
0:11:00.232,000 --> 0:11:01,000
You interact with them.

208
0:11:02.803,000 --> 0:11:04,000
There is none of this quality of being addressed

209
0:11:05.798,000 --> 0:11:07,000
with these Charles Bonnet hallucinations.

210
0:11:08.283,000 --> 0:11:12,000
There is a film. You're seeing a film which has nothing to do with you --

211
0:11:12.91,000 --> 0:11:14,000
or that's how people think about it.

212
0:11:15.888,000 --> 0:11:18,000
There is also a rare thing called temporal lobe epilepsy,

213
0:11:19.721,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and sometimes, if one has this,

214
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
one may feel oneself transported back to a time and place in the past.

215
0:11:27.209,000 --> 0:11:29,000
You're at a particular road junction.

216
0:11:29.702,000 --> 0:11:31,000
You smell chestnuts roasting.

217
0:11:31.753,000 --> 0:11:34,000
You hear the traffic. All the senses are involved.

218
0:11:35.023,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And you're waiting for your girl.

219
0:11:36.757,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And it's that Tuesday evening back in 1982.

220
0:11:40.97,000 --> 0:11:43,000
The temporal lobe hallucinations are all sense hallucinations,

221
0:11:44.892,000 --> 0:11:46,000
full of feeling, full of familiarity,

222
0:11:47.453,000 --> 0:11:49,000
located in space and time,

223
0:11:49.544,000 --> 0:11:5,000
coherent, dramatic.

224
0:11:51.882,000 --> 0:11:53,000
The Charles Bonnet ones are quite different.

225
0:11:54.676,000 --> 0:11:59,000
In the Charles Bonnet hallucinations, you have all sorts of levels,

226
0:12:00.031,000 --> 0:12:02,000
from the geometrical hallucinations --

227
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
the pink and blue squares the woman had --

228
0:12:05.448,000 --> 0:12:09,000
up to quite elaborate hallucinations

229
0:12:09.919,000 --> 0:12:11,000
with figures and especially faces.

230
0:12:12.624,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Faces, and sometimes deformed faces,

231
0:12:15.76,000 --> 0:12:19,000
are the single commonest thing in these hallucinations.

232
0:12:20.222,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And one of the second commonest is cartoons.

233
0:12:23.564,000 --> 0:12:25,000
So, what is going on?

234
0:12:26.424,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Fascinatingly, in the last few years,

235
0:12:28.439,000 --> 0:12:31,000
it's been possible to do functional brain imagery,

236
0:12:32.382,000 --> 0:12:36,000
to do fMRI on people as they are hallucinating,

237
0:12:37.159,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and, in fact, to find that different parts of the visual brain are activated

238
0:12:43.348,000 --> 0:12:44,000
as they are hallucinating.

239
0:12:45.208,000 --> 0:12:48,000
When people have these simple, geometrical hallucinations,

240
0:12:48.582,000 --> 0:12:51,000
the primary visual cortex is activated.

241
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
This is the part of the brain which perceives edges and patterns.

242
0:12:55.92,000 --> 0:12:59,000
You don't form images with your primary visual cortex.

243
0:12:59.952,000 --> 0:13:01,000
When images are formed,

244
0:13:02.298,000 --> 0:13:07,000
a higher part of the visual cortex is involved, in the temporal lobe.

245
0:13:07.909,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And in particular, one area of the temporal lobe

246
0:13:11.002,000 --> 0:13:13,000
is called the fusiform gyrus.

247
0:13:13.875,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And it's known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus,

248
0:13:17.546,000 --> 0:13:2,000
they may lose the ability to recognize faces.

249
0:13:21.693,000 --> 0:13:24,000
But if there's an abnormal activity in the fusiform gyrus,

250
0:13:25.289,000 --> 0:13:27,000
they may hallucinate faces,

251
0:13:27.471,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and this is exactly what you find in some of these people.

252
0:13:30.697,000 --> 0:13:34,000
There is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus

253
0:13:34.904,000 --> 0:13:38,000
where teeth and eyes are represented,

254
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and that part of the gyrus is activated

255
0:13:42.796,000 --> 0:13:45,000
when people get the deformed hallucinations.

256
0:13:46.589,000 --> 0:13:49,000
There is another part of the brain which is especially activated

257
0:13:50.41,000 --> 0:13:51,000
when one sees cartoons.

258
0:13:52.873,000 --> 0:13:54,000
It's activated when one recognizes cartoons,

259
0:13:55.782,000 --> 0:13:58,000
when one draws cartoons and when one hallucinates them.

260
0:13:59.036,000 --> 0:14:02,000
It's very interesting that that should be specific.

261
0:14:02.316,000 --> 0:14:05,000
There are other parts of the brain which are specifically involved

262
0:14:05.468,000 --> 0:14:09,000
with the recognition and hallucination of buildings and landscapes.

263
0:14:09.979,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Around 1970, it was found that there were not only parts of the brain,

264
0:14:13.941,000 --> 0:14:14,000
but particular cells.

265
0:14:15.845,000 --> 0:14:19,000
"Face cells" were discovered around 1970.

266
0:14:20.053,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells,

267
0:14:24.163,000 --> 0:14:26,000
which can be very, very specific.

268
0:14:26.441,000 --> 0:14:32,000
So you may not only have "car" cells, you may have "Aston Martin" cells.

269
0:14:33.437,000 --> 0:14:35,000
(Laughter)

270
0:14:35.735,000 --> 0:14:38,000
I saw an Aston Martin this morning. I had to bring it in.

271
0:14:38.981,000 --> 0:14:39,000
(Laughter)

272
0:14:40.028,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And now it's in there, somewhere.

273
0:14:42.868,000 --> 0:14:43,000
So --

274
0:14:44.05,000 --> 0:14:45,000
(Laughter)

275
0:14:45.538,000 --> 0:14:49,000
now, at this level, in what's called the inferotemporal cortex,

276
0:14:50.291,000 --> 0:14:52,000
there are only visual images,

277
0:14:52.601,000 --> 0:14:54,000
or figments or fragments.

278
0:14:55.197,000 --> 0:15:,000
It's only at higher levels that the other senses join in

279
0:15:00.258,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and there are connections with memory and emotion.

280
0:15:03.207,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And in the Charles Bonnet syndrome,

281
0:15:04.932,000 --> 0:15:06,000
you don't go to those higher levels.

282
0:15:07.171,000 --> 0:15:1,000
You're in these levels of inferior visual cortex,

283
0:15:10.206,000 --> 0:15:12,000
where you have thousands and tens of thousands

284
0:15:12.906,000 --> 0:15:14,000
and millions of images,

285
0:15:15.247,000 --> 0:15:17,000
or figments or fragmentary figments,

286
0:15:17.677,000 --> 0:15:22,000
all neurally encoded in particular cells or small clusters of cells.

287
0:15:23.847,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Normally, these are all part of the integrated stream of perception,

288
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
or imagination,

289
0:15:30.957,000 --> 0:15:32,000
and one is not conscious of them.

290
0:15:33.019,000 --> 0:15:37,000
It is only if one is visually impaired or blind

291
0:15:37.118,000 --> 0:15:39,000
that the process is interrupted.

292
0:15:39.712,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And instead of getting normal perception,

293
0:15:42.209,000 --> 0:15:44,000
you're getting an anarchic,

294
0:15:44.772,000 --> 0:15:46,000
convulsive stimulation, or release,

295
0:15:47.785,000 --> 0:15:5,000
of all of these visual cells in the inferotemporal cortex.

296
0:15:51.676,000 --> 0:15:53,000
So, suddenly, you see a face. Suddenly, you see a car.

297
0:15:54.489,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Suddenly this and suddenly that.

298
0:15:57.227,000 --> 0:15:59,000
The mind does its best to organize

299
0:15:59.624,000 --> 0:16:01,000
and to give some sort of coherence to this,

300
0:16:02.326,000 --> 0:16:04,000
but not terribly successfully.

301
0:16:04.889,000 --> 0:16:05,000
When these were first described,

302
0:16:06.561,000 --> 0:16:09,000
it was thought that they could be interpreted like dreams.

303
0:16:10.15,000 --> 0:16:11,000
But, in fact, people say,

304
0:16:12,000 --> 0:16:16,000
"I don't recognize the people. I can't form any associations.

305
0:16:16.436,000 --> 0:16:17,000
Kermit means nothing to me."

306
0:16:18.41,000 --> 0:16:23,000
You don't get anywhere, thinking of them as dreams.

307
0:16:24.085,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Well, I've more or less said what I wanted.

308
0:16:28.41,000 --> 0:16:32,000
I think I just want to recapitulate and say this is common.

309
0:16:33.348,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Think of the number of blind people.

310
0:16:35.151,000 --> 0:16:37,000
There must be hundreds of thousands of blind people

311
0:16:37.766,000 --> 0:16:38,000
who have these hallucinations

312
0:16:39.504,000 --> 0:16:41,000
but are too scared to mention them.

313
0:16:41.649,000 --> 0:16:46,000
So this sort of thing needs to be brought into notice,

314
0:16:47.161,000 --> 0:16:49,000
for patients, for doctors, for the public.

315
0:16:49.973,000 --> 0:16:54,000
Finally, I think they are infinitely interesting and valuable,

316
0:16:55.023,000 --> 0:16:59,000
for giving one some insight as to how the brain works.

317
0:16:59.321,000 --> 0:17:02,000
Charles Bonnet said, 250 years ago --

318
0:17:02.942,000 --> 0:17:05,000
he wondered how, thinking of these hallucinations,

319
0:17:06.41,000 --> 0:17:08,000
how, as he put it, the theater of the mind

320
0:17:09.114,000 --> 0:17:12,000
could be generated by the machinery of the brain.

321
0:17:12.964,000 --> 0:17:14,000
Now, 250 years later,

322
0:17:15.41,000 --> 0:17:18,000
I think we're beginning to glimpse how this is done.

323
0:17:18.72,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Thanks very much.

324
0:17:19.944,000 --> 0:17:21,000
(Applause)

325
0:17:22.945,000 --> 0:17:24,000
Chris Anderson: That was superb. Thank you so much.

326
0:17:25.946,000 --> 0:17:27,000
You speak about these things with so much insight

327
0:17:28.94,000 --> 0:17:3,000
and empathy for your patients.

328
0:17:31.783,000 --> 0:17:34,000
Have you yourself experienced any of the syndromes you write about?

329
0:17:35.627,000 --> 0:17:37,000
Oliver Sacks: I was afraid you would ask that.

330
0:17:37.868,000 --> 0:17:38,000
(Laughter)

331
0:17:39.72,000 --> 0:17:41,000
Well, yeah, a lot of them.

332
0:17:42.112,000 --> 0:17:45,000
And, actually, I'm a little visually impaired myself.

333
0:17:45.203,000 --> 0:17:48,000
I'm blind in one eye and not terribly good in the other.

334
0:17:48.41,000 --> 0:17:52,000
And I see the geometrical hallucinations.

335
0:17:52.484,000 --> 0:17:53,000
But they stop there.

336
0:17:53.981,000 --> 0:17:54,000
CA: And they don't disturb you?

337
0:17:55.898,000 --> 0:17:58,000
Because you understand what's doing it, it doesn't make you worried?

338
0:17:59.161,000 --> 0:18:02,000
OS: Well, they don't disturb me any more than my tinnitus,

339
0:18:02.41,000 --> 0:18:05,000
which I ignore.

340
0:18:05.539,000 --> 0:18:06,000
They occasionally interest me,

341
0:18:07.251,000 --> 0:18:09,000
and I have many pictures of them in my notebooks.

342
0:18:10.184,000 --> 0:18:12,000
I've gone and had an fMRI myself,

343
0:18:13.06,000 --> 0:18:16,000
to see how my visual cortex is ticking over.

344
0:18:16.139,000 --> 0:18:2,000
And when I see all these hexagons

345
0:18:20.317,000 --> 0:18:22,000
and complex things, which I also have,

346
0:18:22.41,000 --> 0:18:23,000
in visual migraine,

347
0:18:24.197,000 --> 0:18:26,000
I wonder whether everyone sees things like this

348
0:18:26.673,000 --> 0:18:28,000
and whether things like cave art or ornamental art

349
0:18:29.647,000 --> 0:18:31,000
may have been derived from them a bit.

350
0:18:32.219,000 --> 0:18:34,000
CA: That was an utterly, utterly fascinating talk.

351
0:18:34.665,000 --> 0:18:35,000
Thank you so much for sharing.

352
0:18:36.501,000 --> 0:18:37,000
OS: Thank you. Thank you.

353
0:18:38.105,000 --> 0:18:39,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.342,000 --> 0:00:15,000
This is my grandfather.

2
0:00:16.162,000 --> 0:00:18,000
And this is my son.

3
0:00:18.506,000 --> 0:00:2,000
My grandfather taught me to work with wood

4
0:00:20.734,000 --> 0:00:21,000
when I was a little boy,

5
0:00:22.368,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and he also taught me the idea that

6
0:00:24.371,000 --> 0:00:26,000
if you cut down a tree to turn it into something,

7
0:00:27.28,000 --> 0:00:29,000
honor that tree's life and make it as beautiful

8
0:00:29.559,000 --> 0:00:31,000
as you possibly can.

9
0:00:31.709,000 --> 0:00:34,000
My little boy reminded me

10
0:00:35.221,000 --> 0:00:37,000
that for all the technology and all the toys in the world,

11
0:00:38.1,000 --> 0:00:4,000
sometimes just a small block of wood,

12
0:00:40.49,000 --> 0:00:41,000
if you stack it up tall,

13
0:00:42.321,000 --> 0:00:46,000
actually is an incredibly inspiring thing.

14
0:00:46.404,000 --> 0:00:47,000
These are my buildings.

15
0:00:48.241,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I build all around the world

16
0:00:49.961,000 --> 0:00:51,000
out of our office in Vancouver and New York.

17
0:00:52.793,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And we build buildings of different sizes and styles

18
0:00:55.554,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and different materials, depending on where we are.

19
0:00:57.58,000 --> 0:00:59,000
But wood is the material that I love the most,

20
0:00:59.863,000 --> 0:01:,000
and I'm going to tell you the story about wood.

21
0:01:01.818,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And part of the reason I love it is that every time

22
0:01:03.814,000 --> 0:01:05,000
people go into my buildings that are wood,

23
0:01:06.107,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I notice they react completely differently.

24
0:01:08.853,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I've never seen anybody walk into one of my buildings

25
0:01:11.401,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and hug a steel or a concrete column,

26
0:01:13.754,000 --> 0:01:15,000
but I've actually seen that happen in a wood building.

27
0:01:16.654,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I've actually seen how people touch the wood,

28
0:01:19.15,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and I think there's a reason for it.

29
0:01:21.235,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Just like snowflakes, no two pieces of wood

30
0:01:23.741,000 --> 0:01:25,000
can ever be the same anywhere on Earth.

31
0:01:26.425,000 --> 0:01:27,000
That's a wonderful thing.

32
0:01:28.322,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I like to think that wood

33
0:01:30.858,000 --> 0:01:33,000
gives Mother Nature fingerprints in our buildings.

34
0:01:34.419,000 --> 0:01:36,000
It's Mother Nature's fingerprints that make

35
0:01:36.505,000 --> 0:01:4,000
our buildings connect us to nature in the built environment.

36
0:01:41.151,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Now, I live in Vancouver, near a forest

37
0:01:43.213,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that grows to 33 stories tall.

38
0:01:46.29,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Down the coast here in California, the redwood forest

39
0:01:48.838,000 --> 0:01:51,000
grows to 40 stories tall.

40
0:01:51.89,000 --> 0:01:53,000
But the buildings that we think about in wood

41
0:01:54.532,000 --> 0:01:57,000
are only four stories tall in most places on Earth.

42
0:01:57.637,000 --> 0:02:,000
Even building codes actually limit the ability for us to build

43
0:02:01.358,000 --> 0:02:03,000
much taller than four stories in many places,

44
0:02:03.741,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and that's true here in the United States.

45
0:02:05.765,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Now there are exceptions,

46
0:02:07.593,000 --> 0:02:08,000
but there needs to be some exceptions,

47
0:02:09.141,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and things are going to change, I'm hoping.

48
0:02:11.213,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And the reason I think that way is that

49
0:02:13.186,000 --> 0:02:16,000
today half of us live in cities,

50
0:02:16.31,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and that number is going to grow to 75 percent.

51
0:02:19.698,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Cities and density mean that our buildings

52
0:02:21.783,000 --> 0:02:23,000
are going to continue to be big,

53
0:02:24.229,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and I think there's a role for wood to play in cities.

54
0:02:28.047,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And I feel that way because three billion people

55
0:02:31.203,000 --> 0:02:33,000
in the world today, over the next 20 years,

56
0:02:34.049,000 --> 0:02:35,000
will need a new home.

57
0:02:35.569,000 --> 0:02:37,000
That's 40 percent of the world that are going to need

58
0:02:38.117,000 --> 0:02:41,000
a new building built for them in the next 20 years.

59
0:02:41.202,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Now, one in three people living in cities today

60
0:02:43.777,000 --> 0:02:44,000
actually live in a slum.

61
0:02:45.627,000 --> 0:02:48,000
That's one billion people in the world live in slums.

62
0:02:48.968,000 --> 0:02:52,000
A hundred million people in the world are homeless.

63
0:02:53.289,000 --> 0:02:55,000
The scale of the challenge for architects

64
0:02:55.88,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and for society to deal with in building

65
0:02:58.021,000 --> 0:03:02,000
is to find a solution to house these people.

66
0:03:02.615,000 --> 0:03:05,000
But the challenge is, as we move to cities,

67
0:03:06.095,000 --> 0:03:08,000
cities are built in these two materials,

68
0:03:09.084,000 --> 0:03:12,000
steel and concrete, and they're great materials.

69
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
They're the materials of the last century.

70
0:03:14.432,000 --> 0:03:16,000
But they're also materials with very high energy

71
0:03:17.021,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and very high greenhouse gas emissions in their process.

72
0:03:21.34,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Steel represents about three percent

73
0:03:23.615,000 --> 0:03:25,000
of man's greenhouse gas emissions,

74
0:03:25.935,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and concrete is over five percent.

75
0:03:28.536,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So if you think about that, eight percent

76
0:03:31.15,000 --> 0:03:34,000
of our contribution to greenhouse gases today

77
0:03:34.567,000 --> 0:03:37,000
comes from those two materials alone.

78
0:03:37.735,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We don't think about it a lot, and unfortunately,

79
0:03:40.151,000 --> 0:03:42,000
we actually don't even think about buildings, I think,

80
0:03:42.747,000 --> 0:03:43,000
as much as we should.

81
0:03:43.947,000 --> 0:03:46,000
This is a U.S. statistic about the impact of greenhouse gases.

82
0:03:47.567,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Almost half of our greenhouse gases are related to the building industry,

83
0:03:50.833,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and if we look at energy, it's the same story.

84
0:03:53.12,000 --> 0:03:56,000
You'll notice that transportation's sort of second down that list,

85
0:03:56.287,000 --> 0:03:58,000
but that's the conversation we mostly hear about.

86
0:03:58.977,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And although a lot of that is about energy,

87
0:04:02.543,000 --> 0:04:04,000
it's also so much about carbon.

88
0:04:05.424,000 --> 0:04:07,000
The problem I see is that, ultimately,

89
0:04:08.407,000 --> 0:04:1,000
the clash of how we solve that problem

90
0:04:10.714,000 --> 0:04:13,000
of serving those three billion people that need a home,

91
0:04:13.982,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and climate change, are a head-on collision

92
0:04:17.454,000 --> 0:04:19,000
about to happen, or already happening.

93
0:04:20.407,000 --> 0:04:22,000
That challenge means that we have to start thinking in new ways,

94
0:04:23.118,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and I think wood is going to be part of that solution,

95
0:04:25.714,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and I'm going to tell you the story of why.

96
0:04:27.3,000 --> 0:04:29,000
As an architect, wood is the only material,

97
0:04:29.714,000 --> 0:04:31,000
big material, that I can build with

98
0:04:32.13,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that's already grown by the power of the sun.

99
0:04:35.1,000 --> 0:04:38,000
When a tree grows in the forest and gives off oxygen

100
0:04:38.878,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and soaks up carbon dioxide,

101
0:04:40.975,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and it dies and it falls to the forest floor,

102
0:04:43.941,000 --> 0:04:47,000
it gives that carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere or into the ground.

103
0:04:48.246,000 --> 0:04:5,000
If it burns in a forest fire, it's going to give that carbon

104
0:04:51.216,000 --> 0:04:53,000
back to the atmosphere as well.

105
0:04:53.652,000 --> 0:04:56,000
But if you take that wood and you put it into a building

106
0:04:56.696,000 --> 0:04:59,000
or into a piece of furniture or into that wooden toy,

107
0:05:00.032,000 --> 0:05:01,000
it actually has an amazing capacity

108
0:05:01.723,000 --> 0:05:05,000
to store the carbon and provide us with a sequestration.

109
0:05:05.878,000 --> 0:05:08,000
One cubic meter of wood will store

110
0:05:09.157,000 --> 0:05:11,000
one tonne of carbon dioxide.

111
0:05:11.923,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Now our two solutions to climate are obviously

112
0:05:14.138,000 --> 0:05:16,000
to reduce our emissions and find storage.

113
0:05:16.674,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Wood is the only major material building material

114
0:05:19.032,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I can build with that actually does both those two things.

115
0:05:22.632,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So I believe that we have

116
0:05:25.733,000 --> 0:05:27,000
an ethic that the Earth grows our food,

117
0:05:28.285,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and we need to move to an ethic in this century

118
0:05:30.548,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that the Earth should grow our homes.

119
0:05:33.229,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Now, how are we going to do that

120
0:05:34.798,000 --> 0:05:35,000
when we're urbanizing at this rate

121
0:05:36.088,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and we think about wood buildings only at four stories?

122
0:05:38.688,000 --> 0:05:4,000
We need to reduce the concrete and steel and we need

123
0:05:41.189,000 --> 0:05:43,000
to grow bigger, and what we've been working on

124
0:05:43.404,000 --> 0:05:47,000
is 30-story tall buildings made of wood.

125
0:05:47.752,000 --> 0:05:5,000
We've been engineering them with an engineer

126
0:05:51.35,000 --> 0:05:53,000
named Eric Karsh who works with me on it,

127
0:05:53.8,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and we've been doing this new work because

128
0:05:56.113,000 --> 0:05:58,000
there are new wood products out there for us to use,

129
0:05:58.658,000 --> 0:06:,000
and we call them mass timber panels.

130
0:06:00.88,000 --> 0:06:02,000
These are panels made with young trees,

131
0:06:03.203,000 --> 0:06:06,000
small growth trees, small pieces of wood

132
0:06:06.845,000 --> 0:06:08,000
glued together to make panels that are enormous:

133
0:06:09.364,000 --> 0:06:13,000
eight feet wide, 64 feet long, and of various thicknesses.

134
0:06:13.719,000 --> 0:06:16,000
The way I describe this best, I've found, is to say

135
0:06:16.858,000 --> 0:06:18,000
that we're all used to two-by-four construction

136
0:06:19.121,000 --> 0:06:19,000
when we think about wood.

137
0:06:20.128,000 --> 0:06:22,000
That's what people jump to as a conclusion.

138
0:06:22.447,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Two-by-four construction is sort of like the little

139
0:06:24.319,000 --> 0:06:26,000
eight-dot bricks of Lego that we all played with as kids,

140
0:06:27.058,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and you can make all kinds of cool things out of Lego

141
0:06:29.995,000 --> 0:06:31,000
at that size, and out of two-by-fours.

142
0:06:32.914,000 --> 0:06:32,000
But do remember when you were a kid,

143
0:06:33.782,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and you kind of sifted through the pile in your basement,

144
0:06:36.521,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and you found that big 24-dot brick of Lego,

145
0:06:38.655,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and you were kind of like,

146
0:06:39.49,000 --> 0:06:41,000
"Cool, this is awesome. I can build something really big,

147
0:06:41.644,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and this is going to be great."

148
0:06:43.223,000 --> 0:06:44,000
That's the change.

149
0:06:44.566,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Mass timber panels are those 24-dot bricks.

150
0:06:47.512,000 --> 0:06:48,000
They're changing the scale of what we can do,

151
0:06:49.213,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and what we've developed is something we call FFTT,

152
0:06:51.886,000 --> 0:06:53,000
which is a Creative Commons solution

153
0:06:54.34,000 --> 0:06:58,000
to building a very flexible system

154
0:06:59.255,000 --> 0:07:01,000
of building with these large panels where we tilt up

155
0:07:01.938,000 --> 0:07:04,000
six stories at a time if we want to.

156
0:07:05.797,000 --> 0:07:08,000
This animation shows you how the building goes together

157
0:07:09.413,000 --> 0:07:12,000
in a very simple way, but these buildings are available

158
0:07:12.969,000 --> 0:07:14,000
for architects and engineers now to build on

159
0:07:15.222,000 --> 0:07:16,000
for different cultures in the world,

160
0:07:16.961,000 --> 0:07:18,000
different architectural styles and characters.

161
0:07:19.564,000 --> 0:07:21,000
In order for us to build safely,

162
0:07:22.366,000 --> 0:07:24,000
we've engineered these buildings, actually,

163
0:07:24.566,000 --> 0:07:25,000
to work in a Vancouver context,

164
0:07:26.286,000 --> 0:07:27,000
where we're a high seismic zone,

165
0:07:27.834,000 --> 0:07:3,000
even at 30 stories tall.

166
0:07:31.005,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Now obviously, every time I bring this up,

167
0:07:32.927,000 --> 0:07:33,000
people even, you know, here at the conference, say,

168
0:07:34.891,000 --> 0:07:36,000
"Are you serious? Thirty stories? How's that going to happen?"

169
0:07:37.868,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And there's a lot of really good questions that are asked

170
0:07:41.275,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and important questions that we spent quite a long time

171
0:07:43.082,000 --> 0:07:45,000
working on the answers to as we put together

172
0:07:45.461,000 --> 0:07:47,000
our report and the peer reviewed report.

173
0:07:48.034,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I'm just going to focus on a few of them,

174
0:07:49.618,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and let's start with fire, because I think fire

175
0:07:51.127,000 --> 0:07:54,000
is probably the first one that you're all thinking about right now.

176
0:07:54.342,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Fair enough.

177
0:07:54.945,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And the way I describe it is this.

178
0:07:56.638,000 --> 0:07:58,000
If I asked you to take a match and light it

179
0:07:58.833,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and hold up a log and try to get that log to go on fire,

180
0:08:02.821,000 --> 0:08:03,000
it doesn't happen, right? We all know that.

181
0:08:04.62,000 --> 0:08:06,000
But to build a fire, you kind of start with small pieces

182
0:08:07.393,000 --> 0:08:08,000
of wood and you work your way up,

183
0:08:08.989,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and eventually you can add the log to the fire,

184
0:08:11.636,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and when you do add the log to the fire, of course,

185
0:08:14.089,000 --> 0:08:16,000
it burns, but it burns slowly.

186
0:08:16.621,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Well, mass timber panels, these new products

187
0:08:18.741,000 --> 0:08:2,000
that we're using, are much like the log.

188
0:08:20.988,000 --> 0:08:22,000
It's hard to start them on fire, and when they do,

189
0:08:23.683,000 --> 0:08:25,000
they actually burn extraordinarily predictably,

190
0:08:26.3,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and we can use fire science in order to predict

191
0:08:28.652,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and make these buildings as safe as concrete

192
0:08:30.772,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and as safe as steel.

193
0:08:33.36,000 --> 0:08:35,000
The next big issue, deforestation.

194
0:08:36.125,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Eighteen percent of our contribution

195
0:08:38.595,000 --> 0:08:4,000
to greenhouse gas emissions worldwide

196
0:08:40.68,000 --> 0:08:41,000
is the result of deforestation.

197
0:08:42.181,000 --> 0:08:45,000
The last thing we want to do is cut down trees.

198
0:08:45.623,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Or, the last thing we want to do is cut down the wrong trees.

199
0:08:49.82,000 --> 0:08:51,000
There are models for sustainable forestry

200
0:08:52.761,000 --> 0:08:54,000
that allow us to cut trees properly,

201
0:08:54.933,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and those are the only trees appropriate

202
0:08:56.862,000 --> 0:08:57,000
to use for these kinds of systems.

203
0:08:58.583,000 --> 0:09:,000
Now I actually think that these ideas

204
0:09:00.712,000 --> 0:09:03,000
will change the economics of deforestation.

205
0:09:04.29,000 --> 0:09:06,000
In countries with deforestation issues,

206
0:09:06.391,000 --> 0:09:08,000
we need to find a way to provide

207
0:09:08.875,000 --> 0:09:1,000
better value for the forest

208
0:09:11.341,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and actually encourage people to make money

209
0:09:13.725,000 --> 0:09:14,000
through very fast growth cycles --

210
0:09:15.603,000 --> 0:09:17,000
10-, 12-, 15-year-old trees that make these products

211
0:09:18.574,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and allow us to build at this scale.

212
0:09:20.973,000 --> 0:09:22,000
We've calculated a 20-story building:

213
0:09:23.174,000 --> 0:09:26,000
We'll grow enough wood in North America every 13 minutes.

214
0:09:26.461,000 --> 0:09:28,000
That's how much it takes.

215
0:09:28.903,000 --> 0:09:3,000
The carbon story here is a really good one.

216
0:09:31.672,000 --> 0:09:34,000
If we built a 20-story building out of cement and concrete,

217
0:09:35.274,000 --> 0:09:37,000
the process would result in the manufacturing

218
0:09:37.747,000 --> 0:09:4,000
of that cement and 1,200 tonnes of carbon dioxide.

219
0:09:41.712,000 --> 0:09:43,000
If we did it in wood, in this solution,

220
0:09:44.016,000 --> 0:09:45,000
we'd sequester about 3,100 tonnes,

221
0:09:45.919,000 --> 0:09:47,000
for a net difference of 4,300 tonnes.

222
0:09:48.619,000 --> 0:09:5,000
That's the equivalent of about 900 cars

223
0:09:51.296,000 --> 0:09:53,000
removed from the road in one year.

224
0:09:54.033,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Think back to that three billion people

225
0:09:55.915,000 --> 0:09:56,000
that need a new home,

226
0:09:57.154,000 --> 0:10:,000
and maybe this is a contributor to reducing.

227
0:10:00.226,000 --> 0:10:02,000
We're at the beginning of a revolution, I hope,

228
0:10:02.907,000 --> 0:10:04,000
in the way we build, because this is the first new way

229
0:10:05.503,000 --> 0:10:09,000
to build a skyscraper in probably 100 years or more.

230
0:10:09.932,000 --> 0:10:11,000
But the challenge is changing society's perception

231
0:10:12.455,000 --> 0:10:14,000
of possibility, and it's a huge challenge.

232
0:10:14.479,000 --> 0:10:17,000
The engineering is, truthfully, the easy part of this.

233
0:10:17.988,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And the way I describe it is this.

234
0:10:20.005,000 --> 0:10:22,000
The first skyscraper, technically --

235
0:10:22.165,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and the definition of a skyscraper is 10 stories tall, believe it or not —

236
0:10:24.715,000 --> 0:10:26,000
but the first skyscraper was this one in Chicago,

237
0:10:27.073,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and people were terrified to walk underneath this building.

238
0:10:30.028,000 --> 0:10:31,000
But only four years after it was built,

239
0:10:31.968,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Gustave Eiffel was building the Eiffel Tower,

240
0:10:34.594,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and as he built the Eiffel Tower,

241
0:10:36.19,000 --> 0:10:4,000
he changed the skylines of the cities of the world,

242
0:10:40.797,000 --> 0:10:43,000
changed and created a competition

243
0:10:43.869,000 --> 0:10:45,000
between places like New York City and Chicago,

244
0:10:46.084,000 --> 0:10:48,000
where developers started building bigger and bigger buildings

245
0:10:49.013,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and pushing the envelope up higher and higher

246
0:10:52.294,000 --> 0:10:54,000
with better and better engineering.

247
0:10:54.394,000 --> 0:10:56,000
We built this model in New York, actually,

248
0:10:56.428,000 --> 0:10:58,000
as a theoretical model on the campus

249
0:10:59.215,000 --> 0:11:01,000
of a technical university soon to come,

250
0:11:01.563,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and the reason we picked this site

251
0:11:03.414,000 --> 0:11:05,000
to just show you what these buildings may look like,

252
0:11:06.151,000 --> 0:11:07,000
because the exterior can change.

253
0:11:07.938,000 --> 0:11:09,000
It's really just the structure that we're talking about.

254
0:11:10.671,000 --> 0:11:13,000
The reason we picked it is because this is a technical university,

255
0:11:13.838,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and I believe that wood is the most

256
0:11:15.68,000 --> 0:11:18,000
technologically advanced material I can build with.

257
0:11:19.32,000 --> 0:11:21,000
It just happens to be that Mother Nature holds the patent,

258
0:11:22.121,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and we don't really feel comfortable with it.

259
0:11:24.812,000 --> 0:11:25,000
But that's the way it should be,

260
0:11:26.656,000 --> 0:11:29,000
nature's fingerprints in the built environment.

261
0:11:30.451,000 --> 0:11:31,000
I'm looking for this opportunity

262
0:11:32.37,000 --> 0:11:35,000
to create an Eiffel Tower moment, we call it.

263
0:11:35.56,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Buildings are starting to go up around the world.

264
0:11:37.6,000 --> 0:11:38,000
There's a building in London that's nine stories,

265
0:11:39.481,000 --> 0:11:41,000
a new building that just finished in Australia

266
0:11:41.864,000 --> 0:11:42,000
that I believe is 10 or 11.

267
0:11:43.821,000 --> 0:11:46,000
We're starting to push the height up of these wood buildings,

268
0:11:47.368,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and we're hoping, and I'm hoping,

269
0:11:49.173,000 --> 0:11:51,000
that my hometown of Vancouver actually potentially

270
0:11:52.185,000 --> 0:11:54,000
announces the world's tallest at around 20 stories

271
0:11:54.855,000 --> 0:11:56,000
in the not-so-distant future.

272
0:11:57.538,000 --> 0:11:59,000
That Eiffel Tower moment will break the ceiling,

273
0:12:00.268,000 --> 0:12:01,000
these arbitrary ceilings of height,

274
0:12:01.959,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and allow wood buildings to join the competition.

275
0:12:04.651,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And I believe the race is ultimately on.

276
0:12:06.616,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Thank you.

277
0:12:08.066,000 --> 0:12:13,000
(Applause)

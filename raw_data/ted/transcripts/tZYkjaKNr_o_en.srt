1
0:00:12.577,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Almost two years ago,

2
0:00:14.432,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I was driving in my car in Germany,

3
0:00:16.823,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and I turned on the radio.

4
0:00:19.339,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Europe at the time was in the middle

5
0:00:21.546,000 --> 0:00:22,000
of the Euro crisis,

6
0:00:22.989,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and all the headlines were about European countries

7
0:00:27.235,000 --> 0:00:29,000
getting downgraded by rating agencies

8
0:00:30.076,000 --> 0:00:31,000
in the United States.

9
0:00:31.93,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I listened and thought to myself,

10
0:00:34.039,000 --> 0:00:36,000
"What are these rating agencies,

11
0:00:36.111,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and why is everybody so upset about their work?"

12
0:00:39.564,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Well, if you were sitting

13
0:00:41.616,000 --> 0:00:42,000
next to me in the car that day

14
0:00:43.377,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and would have told me that I would devote

15
0:00:45.939,000 --> 0:00:48,000
the next years to trying to reform them,

16
0:00:49.183,000 --> 0:00:52,000
obviously I would have called you crazy.

17
0:00:53.131,000 --> 0:00:54,000
But guess what's really crazy:

18
0:00:55.033,000 --> 0:00:58,000
the way these rating agencies are run.

19
0:00:58.062,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And I would like to explain to you

20
0:00:59.705,000 --> 0:01:01,000
not only why it's time to change this,

21
0:01:01.806,000 --> 0:01:04,000
but also how we can do it.

22
0:01:04.984,000 --> 0:01:05,000
So let me tell you a little bit

23
0:01:06.638,000 --> 0:01:09,000
about what rating agencies really do.

24
0:01:10.216,000 --> 0:01:12,000
As you would read a car magazine

25
0:01:12.6,000 --> 0:01:13,000
before purchasing a new car

26
0:01:14.402,000 --> 0:01:16,000
or taking a look at a product review

27
0:01:16.494,000 --> 0:01:19,000
before deciding which kind of tablet or phone to get,

28
0:01:20.371,000 --> 0:01:22,000
investors are reading ratings

29
0:01:22.571,000 --> 0:01:25,000
before they decide in which kind of product

30
0:01:25.884,000 --> 0:01:27,000
they are investing their money.

31
0:01:27.972,000 --> 0:01:29,000
A rating can range from a so-called AAA,

32
0:01:30.783,000 --> 0:01:32,000
which means it's a top-performing product,

33
0:01:33.726,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and it can go down to the level

34
0:01:36.253,000 --> 0:01:39,000
of the so-called BBB-,

35
0:01:39.267,000 --> 0:01:42,000
which means it's a fairly risky investment.

36
0:01:42.692,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Rating agencies are rating companies.

37
0:01:45.253,000 --> 0:01:46,000
They are rating banks.

38
0:01:46.503,000 --> 0:01:48,000
They are rating even financial products

39
0:01:48.867,000 --> 0:01:51,000
like the infamous mortgage-backed securities.

40
0:01:51.942,000 --> 0:01:53,000
But they can also rate countries,

41
0:01:54.019,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and these ratings are called sovereign ratings,

42
0:01:56.767,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and I would like to focus in particular

43
0:01:59.124,000 --> 0:02:01,000
on these sovereign ratings.

44
0:02:01.75,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And I can tell, as you're listening to me right now,

45
0:02:04.156,000 --> 0:02:05,000
you're thinking,

46
0:02:05.615,000 --> 0:02:07,000
so why should I really care about this, right?

47
0:02:08.223,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Be honest.

48
0:02:09.808,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Well, ratings affect you.

49
0:02:12.097,000 --> 0:02:14,000
They affect all of us.

50
0:02:14.259,000 --> 0:02:17,000
If a rating agency rates a country,

51
0:02:17.564,000 --> 0:02:2,000
it basically assesses and evaluates

52
0:02:20.839,000 --> 0:02:21,000
a country's debt

53
0:02:22.24,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and the ability and willingness of a country

54
0:02:24.589,000 --> 0:02:26,000
to repay its debt.

55
0:02:26.93,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So if a country gets downgraded by a rating agency,

56
0:02:29.863,000 --> 0:02:31,000
the country has to pay more

57
0:02:31.94,000 --> 0:02:32,000
in order to borrow money

58
0:02:33.547,000 --> 0:02:34,000
on the international markets.

59
0:02:35.108,000 --> 0:02:37,000
So it affects you as a citizen and as a taxpayer,

60
0:02:37.909,000 --> 0:02:39,000
because you and your fellow countrymen

61
0:02:40.272,000 --> 0:02:43,000
have to pony up more in order to borrow.

62
0:02:44.062,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But what if a country can't afford to pay more

63
0:02:46.878,000 --> 0:02:48,000
because it's maybe too expensive?

64
0:02:49.715,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Well, then the country has less available

65
0:02:52.65,000 --> 0:02:55,000
for other services, like roads, schools, healthcare.

66
0:02:56.312,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And this is the reason why you should care,

67
0:02:58.751,000 --> 0:03:01,000
because sovereign ratings affect everyone.

68
0:03:01.797,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And that is the reason why I believe

69
0:03:03.458,000 --> 0:03:05,000
they should be defined as public goods.

70
0:03:06.414,000 --> 0:03:08,000
They should be transparent, accessible,

71
0:03:09.226,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and available to everyone at no cost.

72
0:03:13.807,000 --> 0:03:15,000
But here's the situation:

73
0:03:15.853,000 --> 0:03:17,000
the rating agency market is dominated

74
0:03:17.997,000 --> 0:03:19,000
by three players and three players only --

75
0:03:20.97,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch --

76
0:03:23.749,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and we know whenever there is a market concentration,

77
0:03:26.706,000 --> 0:03:27,000
there is really no competition.

78
0:03:28.505,000 --> 0:03:3,000
There is no incentive to improve

79
0:03:30.782,000 --> 0:03:32,000
the quality of your product.

80
0:03:33.099,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And let's face it, the credit rating agencies have contributed,

81
0:03:37.348,000 --> 0:03:39,000
putting the global economy on the brink,

82
0:03:40.193,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and yet they have to change the way they operate.

83
0:03:43.978,000 --> 0:03:44,000
The second point,

84
0:03:45.851,000 --> 0:03:47,000
would you really buy a car

85
0:03:47.873,000 --> 0:03:5,000
just based on the advice of the dealer?

86
0:03:51.359,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Obviously not, right? That would be irresponsible.

87
0:03:54.372,000 --> 0:03:56,000
But that's actually what's going on

88
0:03:56.965,000 --> 0:03:59,000
in the rating agency sector every single day.

89
0:04:00.843,000 --> 0:04:02,000
The customers of these rating agencies,

90
0:04:03.592,000 --> 0:04:05,000
like countries or companies,

91
0:04:06.079,000 --> 0:04:08,000
they are paying for their own ratings,

92
0:04:08.505,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and obviously this is creating

93
0:04:10.503,000 --> 0:04:12,000
a conflict of interest.

94
0:04:13.374,000 --> 0:04:15,000
The third point is,

95
0:04:15.89,000 --> 0:04:17,000
the rating agencies are not really telling us

96
0:04:18.805,000 --> 0:04:2,000
how they are coming up with their ratings,

97
0:04:21.443,000 --> 0:04:22,000
but in this day and age,

98
0:04:23.283,000 --> 0:04:24,000
you can't even sell a candy bar

99
0:04:25.159,000 --> 0:04:28,000
without listing everything that's inside.

100
0:04:28.207,000 --> 0:04:31,000
But for ratings, a crucial element of our economy,

101
0:04:31.891,000 --> 0:04:32,000
we really do not know

102
0:04:33.56,000 --> 0:04:35,000
what all the different ingredients are.

103
0:04:36.042,000 --> 0:04:37,000
We are allowing the rating agencies

104
0:04:37.988,000 --> 0:04:39,000
to be intransparent about their work,

105
0:04:40.69,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and we need to change this.

106
0:04:42.752,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I think there is no doubt that the sector

107
0:04:45.232,000 --> 0:04:46,000
needs a complete overhaul,

108
0:04:46.949,000 --> 0:04:48,000
not just a trimming at the margins.

109
0:04:49.459,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I think it's time for a bold move.

110
0:04:51.682,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I think it's time to upgrade the system.

111
0:04:54.798,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And this is why we at the Bertelsmann Foundation

112
0:04:57.36,000 --> 0:04:59,000
have invested a lot of time and effort

113
0:05:00.182,000 --> 0:05:03,000
thinking about an alternative for the sector.

114
0:05:03.913,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And we have developed the first model

115
0:05:06.512,000 --> 0:05:11,000
for a nonprofit rating agency for sovereign risk,

116
0:05:11.67,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and we call it by its acronym, INCRA.

117
0:05:16.126,000 --> 0:05:17,000
INCRA would make a difference

118
0:05:17.524,000 --> 0:05:19,000
to the current system

119
0:05:19.951,000 --> 0:05:23,000
by adding another nonprofit player to the mix.

120
0:05:24.153,000 --> 0:05:27,000
It would be based on a nonprofit model

121
0:05:27.602,000 --> 0:05:3,000
that would be based on a sustainable endowment.

122
0:05:31.246,000 --> 0:05:33,000
The endowment would create income

123
0:05:33.37,000 --> 0:05:35,000
that would allow us to run the operation,

124
0:05:35.787,000 --> 0:05:36,000
to run the rating agency,

125
0:05:37.489,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and it would also allow us

126
0:05:39.539,000 --> 0:05:42,000
to make our ratings publicly available.

127
0:05:43.224,000 --> 0:05:45,000
But this is not enough to make a difference, right?

128
0:05:45.927,000 --> 0:05:46,000
INCRA would also be based on

129
0:05:47.8,000 --> 0:05:49,000
a very, very clear governance structure

130
0:05:50.378,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that would avoid any conflict of interest,

131
0:05:53.3,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and it would include many stakeholders from society.

132
0:05:58.169,000 --> 0:06:,000
INCRA would not only be a European

133
0:06:00.718,000 --> 0:06:02,000
or an American rating agency,

134
0:06:02.849,000 --> 0:06:04,000
it would be a truly international one,

135
0:06:05.213,000 --> 0:06:08,000
in which, in particular, the emerging economies

136
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
would have an equal interest, voice and representation.

137
0:06:13.454,000 --> 0:06:16,000
The second big difference that INCRA would make is

138
0:06:16.884,000 --> 0:06:18,000
that would it base its sovereign risk assessment

139
0:06:19.862,000 --> 0:06:21,000
on a broader set of indicators.

140
0:06:22.558,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Think about it that way.

141
0:06:24.459,000 --> 0:06:25,000
If we conduct a sovereign rating,

142
0:06:26.303,000 --> 0:06:27,000
we basically take a look at

143
0:06:27.92,000 --> 0:06:29,000
the economic soil of a country,

144
0:06:30.587,000 --> 0:06:32,000
its macroeconomic fundamentals.

145
0:06:33.172,000 --> 0:06:35,000
But we also have to ask the question,

146
0:06:35.35,000 --> 0:06:37,000
who is cultivating the economic soil

147
0:06:38.266,000 --> 0:06:39,000
of a country, right?

148
0:06:40.186,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Well, a country has many gardeners,

149
0:06:42.346,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and one of them is the government,

150
0:06:44.164,000 --> 0:06:46,000
so we have to ask the question,

151
0:06:46.209,000 --> 0:06:47,000
how is a country governed?

152
0:06:47.523,000 --> 0:06:48,000
How is it managed?

153
0:06:49.109,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And this is the reason why we have developed

154
0:06:51.279,000 --> 0:06:54,000
what we call forward-looking indicators.

155
0:06:54.37,000 --> 0:06:55,000
These are indicators that give you

156
0:06:56.037,000 --> 0:06:57,000
a much better read about

157
0:06:57.544,000 --> 0:07:,000
the socioeconomic development of a country.

158
0:07:01.095,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I hope you would agree it's important for you to know

159
0:07:03.853,000 --> 0:07:1,000
if your government is willing to invest in renewable energy and education.

160
0:07:11.034,000 --> 0:07:12,000
It's important for you to know

161
0:07:12.759,000 --> 0:07:14,000
if the government of your country

162
0:07:14.762,000 --> 0:07:15,000
is able to manage a crisis,

163
0:07:16.724,000 --> 0:07:18,000
if the government is finally able to implement

164
0:07:19.705,000 --> 0:07:22,000
the reforms that it's promised.

165
0:07:23.433,000 --> 0:07:24,000
For example, if INCRA would rate

166
0:07:25.3,000 --> 0:07:26,000
South Africa right now,

167
0:07:27.254,000 --> 0:07:3,000
of course we would take a very, very close look

168
0:07:30.711,000 --> 0:07:32,000
at the youth unemployment of the country,

169
0:07:33.011,000 --> 0:07:35,000
the highest in the world.

170
0:07:35.549,000 --> 0:07:38,000
If over 70 percent of a country's population

171
0:07:38.993,000 --> 0:07:41,000
under the age of 35 is unemployed,

172
0:07:42.584,000 --> 0:07:45,000
of course this has a huge impact on the economy

173
0:07:45.68,000 --> 0:07:49,000
today and even more so in the future.

174
0:07:49.974,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Well, our friends at Moody's,

175
0:07:52.249,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Standard & Poor's, and Fitch will tell us

176
0:07:54.572,000 --> 0:07:57,000
we would take this into account as well.

177
0:07:57.605,000 --> 0:07:58,000
But guess what? We do not know

178
0:07:59.554,000 --> 0:08:02,000
exactly how they will take this into account.

179
0:08:02.571,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And this leads me to the third big difference

180
0:08:04.922,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that INCRA would make.

181
0:08:06.626,000 --> 0:08:08,000
INCRA would not only release its ratings

182
0:08:09.42,000 --> 0:08:11,000
but it would also release its indicators

183
0:08:12.391,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and methodology.

184
0:08:14.053,000 --> 0:08:16,000
So in contrast to the current system,

185
0:08:16.616,000 --> 0:08:19,000
INCRA would be fully transparent.

186
0:08:20.131,000 --> 0:08:21,000
So in a nutshell,

187
0:08:21.97,000 --> 0:08:23,000
INCRA would offer an alternative

188
0:08:24.172,000 --> 0:08:27,000
to the current system of the big three rating agencies

189
0:08:27.598,000 --> 0:08:3,000
by adding a new, nonprofit player to the mix

190
0:08:31.563,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that would increase the competition,

191
0:08:33.967,000 --> 0:08:35,000
it would increase the transparency of the sector,

192
0:08:36.53,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and it would also increase the quality.

193
0:08:39.335,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I can tell that sovereign ratings

194
0:08:41.303,000 --> 0:08:44,000
may still look to you like this very small piece

195
0:08:44.527,000 --> 0:08:48,000
of this very complex global financial world,

196
0:08:48.802,000 --> 0:08:5,000
but I tell you it's a very important one,

197
0:08:51.242,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and a very important one to fix,

198
0:08:53.684,000 --> 0:08:56,000
because sovereign ratings affect all of us,

199
0:08:56.827,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and they should be addressed and should be defined

200
0:09:00.365,000 --> 0:09:01,000
as public goods.

201
0:09:01.825,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And this is why we are testing our model right now,

202
0:09:04.709,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and why we are trying to find out if it can

203
0:09:07.636,000 --> 0:09:1,000
bring together a group of able and willing actors

204
0:09:10.839,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to bring INCRA to life.

205
0:09:13.489,000 --> 0:09:15,000
I truly believe building up INCRA

206
0:09:16.1,000 --> 0:09:18,000
is in everyone's interest,

207
0:09:18.491,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and that we have the unique opportunity right now

208
0:09:22.061,000 --> 0:09:24,000
to turn INCRA into a cornerstone

209
0:09:24.63,000 --> 0:09:28,000
of a new, more inclusive financial system.

210
0:09:29.025,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Because for way too long,

211
0:09:31.593,000 --> 0:09:34,000
we have left the big financial players on their own.

212
0:09:35.285,000 --> 0:09:37,000
It's time to give them some company.

213
0:09:38.081,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Thank you.

214
0:09:40.115,000 --> 0:09:44,000
(Applause)

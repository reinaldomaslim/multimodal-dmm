2
0:00:15.408,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm going to talk to you about optimism --

3
0:00:18.79,000 --> 0:00:2,000
or more precisely, the optimism bias.

4
0:00:21.273,000 --> 0:00:22,000
It's a cognitive illusion

5
0:00:22.918,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that we've been studying in my lab for the past few years,

6
0:00:25.66,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and 80 percent of us have it.

7
0:00:27.395,000 --> 0:00:29,000
It's our tendency to overestimate

8
0:00:30.129,000 --> 0:00:32,000
our likelihood of experiencing good events in our lives

9
0:00:33.052,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and underestimate our likelihood of experiencing bad events.

10
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
So we underestimate our likelihood of suffering from cancer,

11
0:00:40.177,000 --> 0:00:41,000
being in a car accident.

12
0:00:41.683,000 --> 0:00:44,000
We overestimate our longevity, our career prospects.

13
0:00:44.869,000 --> 0:00:47,000
In short, we're more optimistic than realistic,

14
0:00:48.314,000 --> 0:00:5,000
but we are oblivious to the fact.

15
0:00:50.476,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Take marriage for example.

16
0:00:52.703,000 --> 0:00:55,000
In the Western world, divorce rates are about 40 percent.

17
0:00:56.237,000 --> 0:00:59,000
That means that out of five married couples,

18
0:00:59.706,000 --> 0:01:01,000
two will end up splitting their assets.

19
0:01:02.427,000 --> 0:01:05,000
But when you ask newlyweds about their own likelihood of divorce,

20
0:01:05.802,000 --> 0:01:08,000
they estimate it at zero percent.

21
0:01:09.494,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And even divorce lawyers, who should really know better,

22
0:01:13.223,000 --> 0:01:16,000
hugely underestimate their own likelihood of divorce.

23
0:01:17.072,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So it turns out that optimists are not less likely to divorce,

24
0:01:20.198,000 --> 0:01:22,000
but they are more likely to remarry.

25
0:01:22.728,000 --> 0:01:24,000
In the words of Samuel Johnson,

26
0:01:25.031,000 --> 0:01:28,000
"Remarriage is the triumph of hope over experience."

27
0:01:29.028,000 --> 0:01:3,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:30.99,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So if we're married, we're more likely to have kids.

29
0:01:35.564,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And we all think our kids will be especially talented.

30
0:01:38.829,000 --> 0:01:4,000
This, by the way, is my two-year-old nephew, Guy.

31
0:01:41.427,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And I just want to make it absolutely clear

32
0:01:43.802,000 --> 0:01:45,000
that he's a really bad example of the optimism bias,

33
0:01:46.573,000 --> 0:01:48,000
because he is in fact uniquely talented.

34
0:01:49.385,000 --> 0:01:5,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:50.82,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And I'm not alone.

36
0:01:52.427,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Out of four British people, three said

37
0:01:54.902,000 --> 0:01:57,000
that they were optimistic about the future of their own families.

38
0:01:58.641,000 --> 0:01:59,000
That's 75 percent.

39
0:02:00.392,000 --> 0:02:02,000
But only 30 percent said

40
0:02:02.45,000 --> 0:02:04,000
that they thought families in general

41
0:02:05.01,000 --> 0:02:07,000
are doing better than a few generations ago.

42
0:02:07.422,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And this is a really important point,

43
0:02:09.443,000 --> 0:02:1,000
because we're optimistic about ourselves,

44
0:02:11.331,000 --> 0:02:12,000
we're optimistic about our kids,

45
0:02:13.149,000 --> 0:02:14,000
we're optimistic about our families,

46
0:02:14.937,000 --> 0:02:17,000
but we're not so optimistic about the guy sitting next to us,

47
0:02:18.12,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and we're somewhat pessimistic

48
0:02:20.349,000 --> 0:02:23,000
about the fate of our fellow citizens and the fate of our country.

49
0:02:24.228,000 --> 0:02:28,000
But private optimism about our own personal future

50
0:02:28.264,000 --> 0:02:3,000
remains persistent.

51
0:02:30.275,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And it doesn't mean that we think things will magically turn out okay,

52
0:02:34.341,000 --> 0:02:38,000
but rather that we have the unique ability to make it so.

53
0:02:38.373,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Now I'm a scientist, I do experiments.

54
0:02:41.214,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So to show you what I mean,

55
0:02:43.006,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I'm going to do an experiment here with you.

56
0:02:45.808,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So I'm going to give you a list of abilities and characteristics,

57
0:02:49.658,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and I want you to think for each of these abilities

58
0:02:52.552,000 --> 0:02:56,000
where you stand relative to the rest of the population.

59
0:02:56.945,000 --> 0:02:59,000
The first one is getting along well with others.

60
0:03:00.731,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Who here believes they're at the bottom 25 percent?

61
0:03:06.383,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Okay, that's about 10 people out of 1,500.

62
0:03:10.705,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Who believes they're at the top 25 percent?

63
0:03:14.718,000 --> 0:03:16,000
That's most of us here.

64
0:03:17.428,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Okay, now do the same for your driving ability.

65
0:03:22.358,000 --> 0:03:24,000
How interesting are you?

66
0:03:24.941,000 --> 0:03:26,000
How attractive are you?

67
0:03:27.785,000 --> 0:03:29,000
How honest are you?

68
0:03:30.739,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And finally, how modest are you?

69
0:03:35.739,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So most of us put ourselves above average

70
0:03:38.427,000 --> 0:03:4,000
on most of these abilities.

71
0:03:40.456,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Now this is statistically impossible.

72
0:03:42.587,000 --> 0:03:45,000
We can't all be better than everyone else.

73
0:03:45.816,000 --> 0:03:46,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:47.458,000 --> 0:03:49,000
But if we believe we're better than the other guy,

75
0:03:50.135,000 --> 0:03:54,000
well that means that we're more likely to get that promotion, to remain married,

76
0:03:54.218,000 --> 0:03:56,000
because we're more social, more interesting.

77
0:03:56.816,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And it's a global phenomenon.

78
0:03:58.979,000 --> 0:04:,000
The optimism bias has been observed

79
0:04:01.447,000 --> 0:04:02,000
in many different countries --

80
0:04:03.166,000 --> 0:04:06,000
in Western cultures, in non-Western cultures,

81
0:04:06.27,000 --> 0:04:07,000
in females and males,

82
0:04:07.776,000 --> 0:04:08,000
in kids, in the elderly.

83
0:04:09.5,000 --> 0:04:1,000
It's quite widespread.

84
0:04:11.283,000 --> 0:04:14,000
But the question is, is it good for us?

85
0:04:14.783,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So some people say no.

86
0:04:17.237,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Some people say the secret to happiness

87
0:04:19.755,000 --> 0:04:21,000
is low expectations.

88
0:04:22.508,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I think the logic goes something like this:

89
0:04:25.012,000 --> 0:04:27,000
If we don't expect greatness,

90
0:04:27.27,000 --> 0:04:3,000
if we don't expect to find love and be healthy and successful,

91
0:04:31.15,000 --> 0:04:34,000
well we're not going to be disappointed when these things don't happen.

92
0:04:34.248,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And if we're not disappointed when good things don't happen,

93
0:04:37.656,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and we're pleasantly surprised when they do,

94
0:04:39.635,000 --> 0:04:4,000
we will be happy.

95
0:04:41.416,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So it's a very good theory,

96
0:04:43.118,000 --> 0:04:46,000
but it turns out to be wrong for three reasons.

97
0:04:46.145,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Number one: Whatever happens, whether you succeed or you fail,

98
0:04:50.76,000 --> 0:04:53,000
people with high expectations always feel better.

99
0:04:54.618,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Because how we feel when we get dumped or win employee of the month

100
0:04:58.55,000 --> 0:05:01,000
depends on how we interpret that event.

101
0:05:01.58,000 --> 0:05:05,000
The psychologists Margaret Marshall and John Brown

102
0:05:05.63,000 --> 0:05:07,000
studied students with high and low expectations.

103
0:05:08.624,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And they found that when people with high expectations succeed,

104
0:05:12.808,000 --> 0:05:14,000
they attribute that success to their own traits.

105
0:05:15.718,000 --> 0:05:17,000
"I'm a genius, therefore I got an A,

106
0:05:17.914,000 --> 0:05:19,000
therefore I'll get an A again and again in the future."

107
0:05:20.589,000 --> 0:05:22,000
When they failed, it wasn't because they were dumb,

108
0:05:23.562,000 --> 0:05:26,000
but because the exam just happened to be unfair.

109
0:05:26.735,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Next time they will do better.

110
0:05:29.018,000 --> 0:05:32,000
People with low expectations do the opposite.

111
0:05:32.095,000 --> 0:05:34,000
So when they failed it was because they were dumb,

112
0:05:34.927,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and when they succeeded

113
0:05:36.427,000 --> 0:05:39,000
it was because the exam just happened to be really easy.

114
0:05:39.744,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Next time reality would catch up with them.

115
0:05:42.145,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So they felt worse.

116
0:05:44.218,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Number two: Regardless of the outcome,

117
0:05:47.458,000 --> 0:05:51,000
the pure act of anticipation makes us happy.

118
0:05:51.505,000 --> 0:05:54,000
The behavioral economist George Lowenstein

119
0:05:54.681,000 --> 0:05:55,000
asked students in his university

120
0:05:56.4,000 --> 0:06:,000
to imagine getting a passionate kiss from a celebrity, any celebrity.

121
0:06:00.762,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Then he said, "How much are you willing to pay

122
0:06:03.647,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to get a kiss from a celebrity

123
0:06:05.635,000 --> 0:06:07,000
if the kiss was delivered immediately,

124
0:06:07.862,000 --> 0:06:12,000
in three hours, in 24 hours, in three days,

125
0:06:12.885,000 --> 0:06:14,000
in one year, in 10 years?

126
0:06:15.318,000 --> 0:06:18,000
He found that the students were willing to pay the most

127
0:06:18.448,000 --> 0:06:19,000
not to get a kiss immediately,

128
0:06:20.447,000 --> 0:06:22,000
but to get a kiss in three days.

129
0:06:23.427,000 --> 0:06:27,000
They were willing to pay extra in order to wait.

130
0:06:27.674,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Now they weren't willing to wait a year or 10 years;

131
0:06:30.677,000 --> 0:06:31,000
no one wants an aging celebrity.

132
0:06:32.098,000 --> 0:06:36,000
But three days seemed to be the optimum amount.

133
0:06:36.887,000 --> 0:06:38,000
So why is that?

134
0:06:39.19,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Well if you get the kiss now, it's over and done with.

135
0:06:42.614,000 --> 0:06:43,000
But if you get the kiss in three days,

136
0:06:44.564,000 --> 0:06:48,000
well that's three days of jittery anticipation, the thrill of the wait.

137
0:06:48.718,000 --> 0:06:49,000
The students wanted that time

138
0:06:50.587,000 --> 0:06:52,000
to imagine where is it going to happen,

139
0:06:52.968,000 --> 0:06:53,000
how is it going to happen.

140
0:06:54.597,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Anticipation made them happy.

141
0:06:56.808,000 --> 0:06:59,000
This is, by the way, why people prefer Friday to Sunday.

142
0:07:00.677,000 --> 0:07:02,000
It's a really curious fact,

143
0:07:02.76,000 --> 0:07:05,000
because Friday is a day of work and Sunday is a day of pleasure,

144
0:07:06.177,000 --> 0:07:08,000
so you'd assume that people will prefer Sunday,

145
0:07:09.081,000 --> 0:07:1,000
but they don't.

146
0:07:10.802,000 --> 0:07:12,000
It's not because they really, really like being in the office

147
0:07:13.677,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and they can't stand strolling in the park

148
0:07:15.644,000 --> 0:07:16,000
or having a lazy brunch.

149
0:07:17.305,000 --> 0:07:19,000
We know that, because when you ask people

150
0:07:19.441,000 --> 0:07:21,000
about their ultimate favorite day of the week,

151
0:07:22.145,000 --> 0:07:24,000
surprise, surprise, Saturday comes in at first,

152
0:07:24.965,000 --> 0:07:26,000
then Friday, then Sunday.

153
0:07:27.885,000 --> 0:07:28,000
People prefer Friday

154
0:07:29.754,000 --> 0:07:32,000
because Friday brings with it the anticipation of the weekend ahead,

155
0:07:33.718,000 --> 0:07:34,000
all the plans that you have.

156
0:07:35.635,000 --> 0:07:37,000
On Sunday, the only thing you can look forward to

157
0:07:38.339,000 --> 0:07:4,000
is the work week.

158
0:07:40.593,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So optimists are people who expect more kisses in their future,

159
0:07:45.47,000 --> 0:07:46,000
more strolls in the park.

160
0:07:47.391,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And that anticipation enhances their wellbeing.

161
0:07:51.298,000 --> 0:07:53,000
In fact, without the optimism bias,

162
0:07:54.262,000 --> 0:07:56,000
we would all be slightly depressed.

163
0:07:57.012,000 --> 0:07:59,000
People with mild depression,

164
0:07:59.279,000 --> 0:08:01,000
they don't have a bias when they look into the future.

165
0:08:02.258,000 --> 0:08:06,000
They're actually more realistic than healthy individuals.

166
0:08:06.48,000 --> 0:08:08,000
But individuals with severe depression,

167
0:08:08.581,000 --> 0:08:09,000
they have a pessimistic bias.

168
0:08:10.41,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So they tend to expect the future

169
0:08:12.873,000 --> 0:08:14,000
to be worse than it ends up being.

170
0:08:15.35,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So optimism changes subjective reality.

171
0:08:18.593,000 --> 0:08:21,000
The way we expect the world to be changes the way we see it.

172
0:08:22.343,000 --> 0:08:25,000
But it also changes objective reality.

173
0:08:25.585,000 --> 0:08:27,000
It acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy.

174
0:08:28.312,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And that is the third reason

175
0:08:30.38,000 --> 0:08:33,000
why lowering your expectations will not make you happy.

176
0:08:33.56,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Controlled experiments have shown

177
0:08:35.395,000 --> 0:08:37,000
that optimism is not only related to success,

178
0:08:38.312,000 --> 0:08:39,000
it leads to success.

179
0:08:40.119,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Optimism leads to success in academia and sports and politics.

180
0:08:44.989,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And maybe the most surprising benefit of optimism is health.

181
0:08:49.464,000 --> 0:08:52,000
If we expect the future to be bright,

182
0:08:52.789,000 --> 0:08:54,000
stress and anxiety are reduced.

183
0:08:55.529,000 --> 0:08:59,000
So all in all, optimism has lots of benefits.

184
0:08:59.749,000 --> 0:09:02,000
But the question that was really confusing to me was,

185
0:09:02.76,000 --> 0:09:06,000
how do we maintain optimism in the face of reality?

186
0:09:07.429,000 --> 0:09:1,000
As an neuroscientist, this was especially confusing,

187
0:09:10.447,000 --> 0:09:12,000
because according to all the theories out there,

188
0:09:13.343,000 --> 0:09:17,000
when your expectations are not met, you should alter them.

189
0:09:17.531,000 --> 0:09:18,000
But this is not what we find.

190
0:09:19.083,000 --> 0:09:22,000
We asked people to come into our lab

191
0:09:22.566,000 --> 0:09:24,000
in order to try and figure out what was going on.

192
0:09:25.376,000 --> 0:09:27,000
We asked them to estimate their likelihood

193
0:09:27.923,000 --> 0:09:29,000
of experiencing different terrible events in their lives.

194
0:09:30.427,000 --> 0:09:34,000
So, for example, what is your likelihood of suffering from cancer?

195
0:09:34.802,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And then we told them the average likelihood

196
0:09:37.154,000 --> 0:09:39,000
of someone like them to suffer these misfortunes.

197
0:09:40.135,000 --> 0:09:43,000
So cancer, for example, is about 30 percent.

198
0:09:43.7,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And then we asked them again,

199
0:09:46.635,000 --> 0:09:48,000
"How likely are you to suffer from cancer?"

200
0:09:49.51,000 --> 0:09:51,000
What we wanted to know was

201
0:09:51.758,000 --> 0:09:53,000
whether people will take the information that we gave them

202
0:09:54.427,000 --> 0:09:56,000
to change their beliefs.

203
0:09:56.558,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And indeed they did --

204
0:09:58.927,000 --> 0:10:,000
but mostly when the information we gave them

205
0:10:01.508,000 --> 0:10:03,000
was better than what they expected.

206
0:10:04.339,000 --> 0:10:05,000
So for example,

207
0:10:05.7,000 --> 0:10:07,000
if someone said, "My likelihood of suffering from cancer

208
0:10:08.61,000 --> 0:10:1,000
is about 50 percent,"

209
0:10:10.991,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and we said, "Hey, good news.

210
0:10:13.512,000 --> 0:10:15,000
The average likelihood is only 30 percent,"

211
0:10:16.093,000 --> 0:10:18,000
the next time around they would say,

212
0:10:18.139,000 --> 0:10:2,000
"Well maybe my likelihood is about 35 percent."

213
0:10:20.854,000 --> 0:10:22,000
So they learned quickly and efficiently.

214
0:10:23.49,000 --> 0:10:25,000
But if someone started off saying,

215
0:10:26.04,000 --> 0:10:29,000
"My average likelihood of suffering from cancer is about 10 percent,"

216
0:10:29.443,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and we said, "Hey, bad news.

217
0:10:32.135,000 --> 0:10:35,000
The average likelihood is about 30 percent,"

218
0:10:35.208,000 --> 0:10:37,000
the next time around they would say,

219
0:10:37.266,000 --> 0:10:4,000
"Yep. Still think it's about 11 percent."

220
0:10:40.385,000 --> 0:10:41,000
(Laughter)

221
0:10:42.075,000 --> 0:10:45,000
So it's not that they didn't learn at all -- they did --

222
0:10:45.394,000 --> 0:10:47,000
but much, much less than when we gave them

223
0:10:47.73,000 --> 0:10:49,000
positive information about the future.

224
0:10:50.203,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And it's not that they didn't remember the numbers that we gave them;

225
0:10:53.237,000 --> 0:10:56,000
everyone remembers that the average likelihood of cancer

226
0:10:56.31,000 --> 0:10:57,000
is about 30 percent

227
0:10:57.81,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and the average likelihood of divorce is about 40 percent.

228
0:11:00.589,000 --> 0:11:04,000
But they didn't think that those numbers were related to them.

229
0:11:05.22,000 --> 0:11:09,000
What this means is that warning signs such as these

230
0:11:09.368,000 --> 0:11:11,000
may only have limited impact.

231
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Yes, smoking kills, but mostly it kills the other guy.

232
0:11:16.419,000 --> 0:11:17,000
What I wanted to know was

233
0:11:18.302,000 --> 0:11:2,000
what was going on inside the human brain

234
0:11:21.162,000 --> 0:11:25,000
that prevented us from taking these warning signs personally.

235
0:11:25.256,000 --> 0:11:26,000
But at the same time,

236
0:11:26.743,000 --> 0:11:27,000
when we hear that the housing market is hopeful,

237
0:11:28.721,000 --> 0:11:32,000
we think, "Oh, my house is definitely going to double in price."

238
0:11:32.837,000 --> 0:11:34,000
To try and figure that out,

239
0:11:34.922,000 --> 0:11:36,000
I asked the participants in the experiment

240
0:11:37.395,000 --> 0:11:39,000
to lie in a brain imaging scanner.

241
0:11:39.556,000 --> 0:11:4,000
It looks like this.

242
0:11:41.083,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And using a method called functional MRI,

243
0:11:44.114,000 --> 0:11:47,000
we were able to identify regions in the brain

244
0:11:47.72,000 --> 0:11:49,000
that were responding to positive information.

245
0:11:50.537,000 --> 0:11:53,000
One of these regions is called the left inferior frontal gyrus.

246
0:11:54.116,000 --> 0:11:57,000
So if someone said, "My likelihood of suffering from cancer is 50 percent,"

247
0:11:57.904,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and we said, "Hey, good news.

248
0:11:59.76,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Average likelihood is 30 percent,"

249
0:12:02.05,000 --> 0:12:05,000
the left inferior frontal gyrus would respond fiercely.

250
0:12:05.622,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And it didn't matter if you're an extreme optimist, a mild optimist

251
0:12:10.354,000 --> 0:12:11,000
or slightly pessimistic,

252
0:12:12.175,000 --> 0:12:14,000
everyone's left inferior frontal gyrus

253
0:12:14.76,000 --> 0:12:15,000
was functioning perfectly well,

254
0:12:16.604,000 --> 0:12:18,000
whether you're Barack Obama or Woody Allen.

255
0:12:19.51,000 --> 0:12:2,000
On the other side of the brain,

256
0:12:21.154,000 --> 0:12:25,000
the right inferior frontal gyrus was responding to bad news.

257
0:12:25.94,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And here's the thing: it wasn't doing a very good job.

258
0:12:29.666,000 --> 0:12:31,000
The more optimistic you were,

259
0:12:31.681,000 --> 0:12:33,000
the less likely this region was

260
0:12:34.018,000 --> 0:12:36,000
to respond to unexpected negative information.

261
0:12:37,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And if your brain is failing

262
0:12:40.058,000 --> 0:12:43,000
at integrating bad news about the future,

263
0:12:43.283,000 --> 0:12:47,000
you will constantly leave your rose-tinted spectacles on.

264
0:12:47.906,000 --> 0:12:51,000
So we wanted to know, could we change this?

265
0:12:52.875,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Could we alter people's optimism bias

266
0:12:56.318,000 --> 0:12:59,000
by interfering with the brain activity in these regions?

267
0:13:00.25,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And there's a way for us to do that.

268
0:13:02.845,000 --> 0:13:04,000
This is my collaborator Ryota Kanai.

269
0:13:05.472,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And what he's doing is he's passing a small magnetic pulse

270
0:13:09.427,000 --> 0:13:11,000
through the skull of the participant in our study

271
0:13:11.546,000 --> 0:13:13,000
into their inferior frontal gyrus.

272
0:13:13.791,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And by doing that,

273
0:13:15.718,000 --> 0:13:17,000
he's interfering with the activity of this brain region

274
0:13:18.622,000 --> 0:13:19,000
for about half an hour.

275
0:13:19.837,000 --> 0:13:21,000
After that everything goes back to normal, I assure you.

276
0:13:22.758,000 --> 0:13:23,000
(Laughter)

277
0:13:24.751,000 --> 0:13:27,000
So let's see what happens.

278
0:13:27.905,000 --> 0:13:29,000
First of all, I'm going to show you

279
0:13:30.002,000 --> 0:13:32,000
the average amount of bias that we see.

280
0:13:32.706,000 --> 0:13:34,000
So if I was to test all of you now,

281
0:13:35.529,000 --> 0:13:36,000
this is the amount that you would learn

282
0:13:37.323,000 --> 0:13:4,000
more from good news relative to bad news.

283
0:13:40.443,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Now we interfere with the region

284
0:13:42.927,000 --> 0:13:46,000
that we found to integrate negative information in this task,

285
0:13:47.394,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and the optimism bias grew even larger.

286
0:13:50.958,000 --> 0:13:55,000
We made people more biased in the way that they process information.

287
0:13:56.428,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Then we interfered with the brain region

288
0:13:59.325,000 --> 0:14:02,000
that we found to integrate good news in this task,

289
0:14:02.843,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and the optimism bias disappeared.

290
0:14:07.314,000 --> 0:14:09,000
We were quite amazed by these results

291
0:14:09.322,000 --> 0:14:11,000
because we were able to eliminate

292
0:14:11.514,000 --> 0:14:14,000
a deep-rooted bias in humans.

293
0:14:14.71,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And at this point we stopped and we asked ourselves,

294
0:14:19.483,000 --> 0:14:24,000
would we want to shatter the optimism illusion into tiny little bits?

295
0:14:24.585,000 --> 0:14:29,000
If we could do that, would we want to take people's optimism bias away?

296
0:14:29.629,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Well I've already told you about all of the benefits of the optimism bias,

297
0:14:34.229,000 --> 0:14:38,000
which probably makes you want to hold onto it for dear life.

298
0:14:38.55,000 --> 0:14:4,000
But there are, of course, pitfalls,

299
0:14:40.635,000 --> 0:14:43,000
and it would be really foolish of us to ignore them.

300
0:14:43.755,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Take for example this email I recieved

301
0:14:47.301,000 --> 0:14:49,000
from a firefighter here in California.

302
0:14:49.995,000 --> 0:14:52,000
He says, "Fatality investigations for firefighters

303
0:14:53.299,000 --> 0:14:57,000
often include 'We didn't think the fire was going to do that,'

304
0:14:57.441,000 --> 0:14:59,000
even when all of the available information

305
0:14:59.743,000 --> 0:15:01,000
was there to make safe decisions."

306
0:15:01.998,000 --> 0:15:04,000
This captain is going to use our findings on the optimism bias

307
0:15:05.872,000 --> 0:15:07,000
to try to explain to the firefighters

308
0:15:08.064,000 --> 0:15:1,000
why they think the way they do,

309
0:15:10.273,000 --> 0:15:17,000
to make them acutely aware of this very optimistic bias in humans.

310
0:15:17.399,000 --> 0:15:22,000
So unrealistic optimism can lead to risky behavior,

311
0:15:22.518,000 --> 0:15:25,000
to financial collapse, to faulty planning.

312
0:15:26.156,000 --> 0:15:28,000
The British government, for example,

313
0:15:28.294,000 --> 0:15:3,000
has acknowledged that the optimism bias

314
0:15:30.968,000 --> 0:15:33,000
can make individuals more likely

315
0:15:34.255,000 --> 0:15:38,000
to underestimate the costs and durations of projects.

316
0:15:38.281,000 --> 0:15:42,000
So they have adjusted the 2012 Olympic budget

317
0:15:42.535,000 --> 0:15:44,000
for the optimism bias.

318
0:15:44.646,000 --> 0:15:46,000
My friend who's getting married in a few weeks

319
0:15:46.833,000 --> 0:15:48,000
has done the same for his wedding budget.

320
0:15:49.267,000 --> 0:15:52,000
And by the way, when I asked him about his own likelihood of divorce,

321
0:15:52.329,000 --> 0:15:55,000
he said he was quite sure it was zero percent.

322
0:15:55.889,000 --> 0:15:57,000
So what we would really like to do,

323
0:15:58.306,000 --> 0:16:02,000
is we would like to protect ourselves from the dangers of optimism,

324
0:16:02.467,000 --> 0:16:05,000
but at the same time remain hopeful,

325
0:16:05.695,000 --> 0:16:07,000
benefiting from the many fruits of optimism.

326
0:16:08.539,000 --> 0:16:1,000
And I believe there's a way for us to do that.

327
0:16:11.343,000 --> 0:16:13,000
The key here really is knowledge.

328
0:16:13.403,000 --> 0:16:16,000
We're not born with an innate understanding of our biases.

329
0:16:16.714,000 --> 0:16:19,000
These have to be identified by scientific investigation.

330
0:16:20.555,000 --> 0:16:24,000
But the good news is that becoming aware of the optimism bias

331
0:16:24.739,000 --> 0:16:25,000
does not shatter the illusion.

332
0:16:26.514,000 --> 0:16:27,000
It's like visual illusions,

333
0:16:28.062,000 --> 0:16:31,000
in which understanding them does not make them go away.

334
0:16:31.552,000 --> 0:16:33,000
And this is good because it means

335
0:16:33.789,000 --> 0:16:35,000
we should be able to strike a balance,

336
0:16:36.262,000 --> 0:16:38,000
to come up with plans and rules

337
0:16:38.689,000 --> 0:16:4,000
to protect ourselves from unrealistic optimism,

338
0:16:41.472,000 --> 0:16:44,000
but at the same time remain hopeful.

339
0:16:44.624,000 --> 0:16:47,000
I think this cartoon portrays it nicely.

340
0:16:48.048,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Because if you're one of these pessimistic penguins up there

341
0:16:51.574,000 --> 0:16:53,000
who just does not believe they can fly,

342
0:16:53.693,000 --> 0:16:55,000
you certainly never will.

343
0:16:56.052,000 --> 0:16:57,000
Because to make any kind of progress,

344
0:16:57.883,000 --> 0:16:59,000
we need to be able to imagine a different reality,

345
0:17:00.233,000 --> 0:17:03,000
and then we need to believe that that reality is possible.

346
0:17:03.974,000 --> 0:17:06,000
But if you are an extreme optimistic penguin

347
0:17:07.498,000 --> 0:17:09,000
who just jumps down blindly hoping for the best,

348
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
you might find yourself in a bit of a mess when you hit the ground.

349
0:17:15.041,000 --> 0:17:16,000
But if you're an optimistic penguin

350
0:17:16.93,000 --> 0:17:17,000
who believes they can fly,

351
0:17:18.726,000 --> 0:17:2,000
but then adjusts a parachute to your back

352
0:17:21.389,000 --> 0:17:24,000
just in case things don't work out exactly as you had planned,

353
0:17:24.406,000 --> 0:17:25,000
you will soar like an eagle,

354
0:17:26.269,000 --> 0:17:29,000
even if you're just a penguin.

355
0:17:29.318,000 --> 0:17:3,000
Thank you.

356
0:17:31.08,000 --> 0:17:33,000
(Applause)

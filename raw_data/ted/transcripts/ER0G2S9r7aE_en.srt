1
0:00:12.835,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I have to tell you,

2
0:00:14.073,000 --> 0:00:16,000
it's more than a little intimidating being up here,

3
0:00:16.628,000 --> 0:00:18,000
an old American guy trying to tell Africans

4
0:00:18.906,000 --> 0:00:2,000
something new about your own continent.

5
0:00:21.855,000 --> 0:00:24,000
But sometimes, an outsider can see things in a different way,

6
0:00:25.602,000 --> 0:00:26,000
like from the air.

7
0:00:27.855,000 --> 0:00:31,000
That's what I found by flying low and slow all over the African continent

8
0:00:32.066,000 --> 0:00:34,000
as I photographed the spectacle of its diversity.

9
0:00:35.571,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And I wasn't always an old guy.

10
0:00:37.738,000 --> 0:00:39,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:40.11,000 --> 0:00:42,000
This is me in 1979,

12
0:00:42.683,000 --> 0:00:45,000
a kid from California backpacking his way through the Ituri Forest of Zaire.

13
0:00:47.101,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I was on a yearlong hitchhiking trip.

14
0:00:48.888,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I had just dropped out of Stanford University,

15
0:00:51.056,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and I went from Tunis to Kisangani to Cairo

16
0:00:53.887,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and learned how to live on 10 dollars a day.

17
0:00:57.109,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It was an amazing experience for me.

18
0:00:58.983,000 --> 0:01:,000
I spent about a week in this Dinka cattle camp

19
0:01:01.634,000 --> 0:01:02,000
on the banks of the Nile in South Sudan.

20
0:01:04.179,000 --> 0:01:06,000
The Dinka taught me how to tie papyrus into a shelter,

21
0:01:07.087,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and also I observed how they had adapted their way of life

22
0:01:11.54,000 --> 0:01:13,000
around the migratory needs of their beloved cattle.

23
0:01:14.737,000 --> 0:01:16,000
It was a like a graduate course in ecological ethnography,

24
0:01:17.738,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and I got busy taking notes with a camera.

25
0:01:20.735,000 --> 0:01:21,000
With no money for rides,

26
0:01:22.158,000 --> 0:01:24,000
they often made the Mzungu ride on the roof of the trucks,

27
0:01:25.143,000 --> 0:01:28,000
or in this case, on the top of the train going across South Sudan.

28
0:01:29.447,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I felt like I was riding on the back of an insect

29
0:01:32.654,000 --> 0:01:34,000
going across the enormous tapestry of Africa.

30
0:01:35.178,000 --> 0:01:37,000
It was an incredible view from up there,

31
0:01:37.235,000 --> 0:01:38,000
but I couldn't help but think,

32
0:01:38.745,000 --> 0:01:41,000
wouldn't it be even more amazing if I could fly over that landscape

33
0:01:41.944,000 --> 0:01:42,000
like a bird?

34
0:01:43.924,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Well, that notion stayed with me,

35
0:01:45.816,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and 20 years later,

36
0:01:47.649,000 --> 0:01:49,000
after becoming a professional photographer,

37
0:01:49.698,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I was able to talk National Geographic

38
0:01:51.634,000 --> 0:01:53,000
into doing a big story in the central Sahara,

39
0:01:53.825,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and I came back with a new kind of flying machine.

40
0:01:57.348,000 --> 0:02:,000
This is me piloting the world's lightest and slowest aircraft.

41
0:02:00.669,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:01.724,000 --> 0:02:03,000
It's called a motorized paraglider.

43
0:02:03.969,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It consists of a backpack motor and a parachute-style wing,

44
0:02:08.112,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and it flies at about 30 miles an hour.

45
0:02:10.557,000 --> 0:02:13,000
With 10 liters of fuel, I can fly for about two hours,

46
0:02:13.994,000 --> 0:02:16,000
but what's really amazing about it is it gives me an unobstructed view,

47
0:02:17.769,000 --> 0:02:18,000
both horizontally and vertically,

48
0:02:19.534,000 --> 0:02:2,000
like a flying lawn chair.

49
0:02:21.862,000 --> 0:02:23,000
My hitchhiker's dream of flying over Africa came true

50
0:02:24.364,000 --> 0:02:27,000
when I spotted these two camel caravans passing out in the middle of the Sahara.

51
0:02:28.32,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The one in the foreground is carrying salt out of the desert,

52
0:02:31.25,000 --> 0:02:33,000
while the one in the background is carrying fodder

53
0:02:33.67,000 --> 0:02:34,000
for the animals heading back in.

54
0:02:35.28,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I realized you couldn't take this kind of picture

55
0:02:37.668,000 --> 0:02:38,000
with a conventional aircraft.

56
0:02:39.137,000 --> 0:02:4,000
An airplane moves too fast,

57
0:02:40.606,000 --> 0:02:42,000
a helicopter would be too loud with too much downdraft,

58
0:02:43.249,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and it dawned on me that this crazy little aircraft I was flying

59
0:02:46.677,000 --> 0:02:49,000
would open up a new way of seeing remote parts of the African landscape

60
0:02:50.042,000 --> 0:02:52,000
in a way that had never really been possible before.

61
0:02:52.79,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Let me show you how it works.

62
0:04:35.719,000 --> 0:04:38,000
(Applause)

63
0:04:39.665,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Thanks.

64
0:04:40.854,000 --> 0:04:41,000
(Applause)

65
0:04:43.322,000 --> 0:04:46,000
This may seem a bit dangerous, but I am not some kind of adventure dude.

66
0:04:46.735,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I'm a photographer who flies, and I only fly to take pictures.

67
0:04:49.745,000 --> 0:04:52,000
My favorite altitude is between 200 and 500 feet,

68
0:04:53.131,000 --> 0:04:55,000
where I can see the world three-dimensionally,

69
0:04:55.298,000 --> 0:04:56,000
but also at a human scale.

70
0:04:58.529,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I find that a lot of what I'd done over the years in Africa,

71
0:05:01.973,000 --> 0:05:03,000
you could try to do with a drone,

72
0:05:04.332,000 --> 0:05:06,000
but drones aren't really made for exploration.

73
0:05:06.662,000 --> 0:05:08,000
They only fly for about 20 minutes of battery life

74
0:05:09.098,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and about three kilometers of range,

75
0:05:10.896,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and all you get to see is what's on a little screen.

76
0:05:13.627,000 --> 0:05:14,000
But I like to explore.

77
0:05:14.802,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I want to go over the horizon and find new things, find weird stuff,

78
0:05:20.079,000 --> 0:05:22,000
like this volcanic caldera in Niger.

79
0:05:23.532,000 --> 0:05:25,000
If you look at the altimeter on my left leg,

80
0:05:25.868,000 --> 0:05:27,000
you'll see that I'm about a mile above takeoff.

81
0:05:28.404,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Flying that high really freaked me out,

82
0:05:30.563,000 --> 0:05:31,000
but if you talk to a pro pilot,

83
0:05:32.264,000 --> 0:05:34,000
they'll tell you that altitude is actually your friend,

84
0:05:34.92,000 --> 0:05:35,000
because the higher you are,

85
0:05:36.359,000 --> 0:05:38,000
the more time you have to figure out your problems.

86
0:05:38.765,000 --> 0:05:4,000
(Laughter)

87
0:05:40.845,000 --> 0:05:42,000
As a rank amateur, I figured this gave me more time

88
0:05:43.263,000 --> 0:05:44,000
to scream on the way back down.

89
0:05:44.838,000 --> 0:05:45,000
(Laughter)

90
0:05:46.092,000 --> 0:05:48,000
To calm myself down, I started taking pictures,

91
0:05:48.433,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and as I did, I became rational again,

92
0:05:50.458,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and I was getting buffeted by a Harmattan wind

93
0:05:52.716,000 --> 0:05:55,000
which was coming out of the upper right hand corner of this picture,

94
0:05:55.954,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and I started to notice how it had filled the entire crater with sand.

95
0:05:59.3,000 --> 0:06:02,000
When I got to the north of Chad, I found a different kind of volcano.

96
0:06:02.618,000 --> 0:06:04,000
These had had their entire exteriors stripped away,

97
0:06:05.038,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and all that was left was the old core,

98
0:06:06.97,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and in the middle of the Sahara,

99
0:06:08.717,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I felt like I was seeing the earth with its living skin stripped away.

100
0:06:12.795,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Much of the Sahara is underlain by an enormous freshwater aquifer.

101
0:06:16.465,000 --> 0:06:18,000
When you go to the basin, sometimes you can see it leaking out.

102
0:06:19.488,000 --> 0:06:21,000
If you were to walk through those palm groves,

103
0:06:22.211,000 --> 0:06:24,000
you could drink fresh water out of your footsteps.

104
0:06:24.639,000 --> 0:06:25,000
But that green lake water?

105
0:06:26.036,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Due to extreme evaporation, it's saltier than seawater

106
0:06:28.854,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and virtually lifeless.

107
0:06:30.628,000 --> 0:06:31,000
In Niger, I was amazed to see

108
0:06:32.121,000 --> 0:06:35,000
how the locals learned how to exploit a different kind of desert spring.

109
0:06:35.571,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Here, they mix the salty mud with spring water

110
0:06:37.903,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and spread it out in shallow ponds,

111
0:06:39.626,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and as it evaporated, it turned into a spectacle of color.

112
0:06:43.583,000 --> 0:06:46,000
My rig is also amazing for looking at agriculture.

113
0:06:46.891,000 --> 0:06:48,000
This picture was taken in southern Algeria,

114
0:06:49.48,000 --> 0:06:52,000
where the locals have learned how to garden in a mobile dune field

115
0:06:52.624,000 --> 0:06:53,000
by tapping into shallow groundwater.

116
0:06:55.142,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I also loved looking at how animals have adapted to the African landscape.

117
0:06:59.063,000 --> 0:07:,000
This picture was taken in Lake Amboseli,

118
0:07:01.063,000 --> 0:07:03,000
just across the border from here in Kenya.

119
0:07:03.088,000 --> 0:07:05,000
The elephants have carved the shallow lake water up

120
0:07:05.494,000 --> 0:07:07,000
into a network of little pathways,

121
0:07:07.722,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and they're spaced just enough apart

122
0:07:09.501,000 --> 0:07:11,000
that only elephants, with their long trunks,

123
0:07:11.633,000 --> 0:07:12,000
can tap into the most succulent grasses.

124
0:07:13.588,000 --> 0:07:16,000
In Namibia, the zebra have learned how to thrive in an environment

125
0:07:16.802,000 --> 0:07:17,000
that gets no rainfall at all.

126
0:07:18.287,000 --> 0:07:2,000
These grasses are irrigated by the dense coastal fog

127
0:07:21.176,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that blankets the area every morning.

128
0:07:23.281,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And those bald patches out there?

129
0:07:25.202,000 --> 0:07:26,000
They call them fairy circles,

130
0:07:26.646,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and scientists still struggle to understand what causes them.

131
0:07:29.971,000 --> 0:07:33,000
This is Mount Visoke, with a small crater lake in its summit at 3,700 meters.

132
0:07:34.305,000 --> 0:07:36,000
It forms the roof of the Great Rift Valley

133
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and also the border between Rwanda and Congo.

134
0:07:39.313,000 --> 0:07:42,000
It's also the center of the reserve for the fabled mountain gorilla.

135
0:07:42.869,000 --> 0:07:44,000
They're actually the big money-maker in Rwanda,

136
0:07:45.243,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and on this side of the border, conservation has become a huge success.

137
0:07:49.487,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Rwanda has the highest rural population density in Africa,

138
0:07:53.289,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and I saw it in almost every corner of the country I went to.

139
0:07:56.565,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I've heard it said that competition for land

140
0:07:59.232,000 --> 0:08:01,000
was one of the things that led to the tensions

141
0:08:01.4,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that caused the genocide of the 1990s.

142
0:08:04.699,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I went back to South Sudan a few years ago,

143
0:08:07.08,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and it was amazing to see how much things had changed.

144
0:08:09.659,000 --> 0:08:11,000
The Dinka were still in love with their cattle,

145
0:08:11.903,000 --> 0:08:13,000
but they had turned in their spears for Kalashnikovs.

146
0:08:14.43,000 --> 0:08:16,000
The cattle camps from above were even more spectacular

147
0:08:17.183,000 --> 0:08:19,000
than I could have imagined, but things had changed there too.

148
0:08:20.071,000 --> 0:08:22,000
You see those little blue dots down there?

149
0:08:22.19,000 --> 0:08:24,000
The Dinka had adapted to the new reality,

150
0:08:24.261,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and now they covered their papyrus shelters

151
0:08:26.309,000 --> 0:08:27,000
with the tarps from UN food convoys.

152
0:08:28.683,000 --> 0:08:31,000
In Mali, the Bozo people have learned how to thrive

153
0:08:31.787,000 --> 0:08:33,000
in the pulsating rhythms of the Niger River.

154
0:08:33.991,000 --> 0:08:35,000
As the rainy season ends and the water subsides,

155
0:08:36.502,000 --> 0:08:38,000
they plant their rice in the fertile bottoms.

156
0:08:38.664,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And that village in the lower right corner,

157
0:08:40.688,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that's Gao, one of the jumping off points for the major trade routes

158
0:08:43.903,000 --> 0:08:44,000
across the Sahara.

159
0:08:45.379,000 --> 0:08:46,000
At the end of the harvest,

160
0:08:46.729,000 --> 0:08:48,000
the Bozo take the leftover rice straw

161
0:08:48.912,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and they mix it with mud to reinforce their roofs and the village mosque.

162
0:08:52.555,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I must have flown over a dozen villages like this along the Niger River,

163
0:08:55.967,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and each one was unique, it had a different pattern.

164
0:08:58.497,000 --> 0:09:,000
And each mosque was like a sculptural masterpiece,

165
0:09:00.863,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and no two were alike.

166
0:09:02.869,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I've flown all over the world, and nothing can really compare

167
0:09:05.752,000 --> 0:09:06,000
to the cultural diversity of Africa.

168
0:09:07.492,000 --> 0:09:08,000
You see it in every country,

169
0:09:09.379,000 --> 0:09:1,000
from Morocco

170
0:09:11.871,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to Ethiopia,

171
0:09:14.59,000 --> 0:09:15,000
to South Africa,

172
0:09:17.226,000 --> 0:09:18,000
to Mozambique,

173
0:09:19.987,000 --> 0:09:2,000
to South Sudan,

174
0:09:23.361,000 --> 0:09:24,000
to Mali.

175
0:09:25.088,000 --> 0:09:28,000
The array of environments and cultural adaptations to them

176
0:09:28.605,000 --> 0:09:29,000
is really extraordinary,

177
0:09:29.882,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and the history is pretty cool too.

178
0:09:32.259,000 --> 0:09:34,000
From the air, I have a unique window into the earliest waves

179
0:09:35.094,000 --> 0:09:36,000
of colonial history.

180
0:09:36.269,000 --> 0:09:38,000
This is Cyrene on the coastal mountains of Libya,

181
0:09:38.609,000 --> 0:09:41,000
that was founded by the Greeks, in 700 BC, as a learning center,

182
0:09:41.633,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and Timgad, which was founded in what's now Algeria

183
0:09:44.317,000 --> 0:09:45,000
by the Romans in 100 AD.

184
0:09:45.762,000 --> 0:09:48,000
This was built as a retirement community for old Roman soldiers,

185
0:09:49.444,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and it amazed me to think

186
0:09:51.468,000 --> 0:09:54,000
that North Africa was once the breadbasket for the Roman Empire.

187
0:09:54.897,000 --> 0:09:57,000
But 700 years after Timgad was built, it was buried in sand,

188
0:09:58.302,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and even then, the African climate was wetter than it is today.

189
0:10:02.709,000 --> 0:10:04,000
The African climate continues to change,

190
0:10:04.755,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and you see it everywhere,

191
0:10:06.336,000 --> 0:10:07,000
like here in the Gorges de Ziz,

192
0:10:08.17,000 --> 0:10:1,000
where a freak rainstorm came barreling out of the Sahara

193
0:10:11.05,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and blanketed the mountains in snow.

194
0:10:13.669,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I never thought I would see date palms in snow,

195
0:10:17.074,000 --> 0:10:2,000
but the kids that day had a great time throwing snowballs at each other.

196
0:10:21.536,000 --> 0:10:23,000
But it made me wonder, how are Africans going to adapt

197
0:10:24.131,000 --> 0:10:26,000
to this rapidly changing climate going forward?

198
0:10:26.913,000 --> 0:10:28,000
In a continent as dynamic and diverse as Africa,

199
0:10:29.414,000 --> 0:10:31,000
sometimes it seems that the only constant is change.

200
0:10:32.625,000 --> 0:10:33,000
But one thing I've learned

201
0:10:33.9,000 --> 0:10:35,000
is that Africans are the ultimate improvisers,

202
0:10:36.068,000 --> 0:10:38,000
always adapting and finding a way forward.

203
0:10:38.763,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Thank you.

204
0:10:39.938,000 --> 0:10:42,000

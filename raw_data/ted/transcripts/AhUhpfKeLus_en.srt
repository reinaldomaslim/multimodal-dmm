1
0:00:12.756,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Silicon Valley is obsessed with disruption,

2
0:00:16.38,000 --> 0:00:19,000
but these days, the biggest disruptor didn't come out of Silicon Valley.

3
0:00:20.899,000 --> 0:00:22,000
It came out of steel towns in Ohio,

4
0:00:24.1,000 --> 0:00:26,000
rural communities in Pennsylvania,

5
0:00:27.42,000 --> 0:00:28,000
the Panhandle in Florida.

6
0:00:30.82,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And this last US presidential election

7
0:00:33.78,000 --> 0:00:34,000
was the mother of all disruptions.

8
0:00:36.98,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Once again, politics is personal.

9
0:00:40.94,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Millions of Americans became activists overnight,

10
0:00:44.38,000 --> 0:00:46,000
pouring into the streets in record numbers

11
0:00:47.22,000 --> 0:00:48,000
in record time.

12
0:00:48.66,000 --> 0:00:49,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:50.5,000 --> 0:00:52,000
The election has done to family holiday dinners

14
0:00:52.86,000 --> 0:00:54,000
what Uber has done to New York City's taxi system.

15
0:00:57.06,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Couples have broken up and marriages disrupted.

16
0:01:01.98,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And the election is doing to my private life

17
0:01:04.1,000 --> 0:01:06,000
what Amazon is doing to shopping malls.

18
0:01:06.66,000 --> 0:01:1,000
These days, the ACLU is on the front lines 24/7,

19
0:01:11.94,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and even if I manage to sneak away for a couple of miles on the treadmill,

20
0:01:17.059,000 --> 0:01:2,000
any cardio benefit I get is instantly obliterated

21
0:01:20.9,000 --> 0:01:23,000
when I read another presidential tweet on the headline scroll.

22
0:01:26.1,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Even my secret pleasure

23
0:01:28.78,000 --> 0:01:3,000
of studying the Italian painters

24
0:01:31.3,000 --> 0:01:33,000
have been infected by politics.

25
0:01:34.54,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Now, I study, even stalk, the old masters.

26
0:01:38.1,000 --> 0:01:39,000
This is my desk,

27
0:01:39.7,000 --> 0:01:4,000
with a postcard exhibition

28
0:01:41.54,000 --> 0:01:42,000
of some famous and obscure paintings

29
0:01:43.42,000 --> 0:01:45,000
mostly from the Italian Renaissance.

30
0:01:46.1,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Now, art used to provide me with a necessary break

31
0:01:48.58,000 --> 0:01:5,000
from the hurly-burly of politics

32
0:01:50.9,000 --> 0:01:52,000
in my daily work at the ACLU,

33
0:01:53.3,000 --> 0:01:54,000
but not anymore.

34
0:01:55.38,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I was at the Women's March in San Francisco

35
0:01:57.46,000 --> 0:01:58,000
the day after inauguration,

36
0:01:59.02,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and the crowd was chanting, "This is what democracy looks like."

37
0:02:02.1,000 --> 0:02:04,000
"This is what democracy looks like."

38
0:02:05.38,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And there I was holding my sign and my umbrella in the rain,

39
0:02:09.38,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and I flashed on an old painting

40
0:02:13.22,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that first captivated me many years ago.

41
0:02:16.34,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I struggled to remember the different pieces

42
0:02:19.7,000 --> 0:02:21,000
of an actual painting

43
0:02:22.06,000 --> 0:02:24,000
of good and bad government.

44
0:02:24.98,000 --> 0:02:26,000
It was almost like the old master was taunting me.

45
0:02:28.14,000 --> 0:02:3,000
You want to know what democracy looks like?

46
0:02:30.66,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Go back and look at my frescoes.

47
0:02:33.78,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And so I did.

48
0:02:35.98,000 --> 0:02:4,000
In 1339, Ambrogio Lorenzetti finished a monumental commission

49
0:02:41.78,000 --> 0:02:44,000
in the governing council chamber of Siena's Palazzo Pubblico.

50
0:02:45.62,000 --> 0:02:49,000
It's a painting that speaks to us, even screams to us, today.

51
0:02:52.3,000 --> 0:02:55,000
"Art is a lie that makes us realize truth,"

52
0:02:56.1,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Pablo Picasso once said.

53
0:02:58.5,000 --> 0:03:,000
And as we search for the truth about government,

54
0:03:00.78,000 --> 0:03:01,000
we should keep Ambrogio's work,

55
0:03:02.7,000 --> 0:03:06,000
not a lie but an allegory, in our collective mind's eye.

56
0:03:08.38,000 --> 0:03:09,000
During Lorenzetti's time,

57
0:03:09.82,000 --> 0:03:12,000
the political legitimacy of Italian city-states

58
0:03:13.14,000 --> 0:03:14,000
was often on very shaky ground.

59
0:03:15.62,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Siena was a republic,

60
0:03:17.5,000 --> 0:03:18,000
but there had been enormous unrest

61
0:03:19.18,000 --> 0:03:21,000
in the two decades leading up to the commission.

62
0:03:22.06,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Siena's political leaders, who would literally govern

63
0:03:25.38,000 --> 0:03:28,000
under the eyes of these allegorical figures,

64
0:03:28.58,000 --> 0:03:3,000
were Lorenzetti's intended audience.

65
0:03:31.54,000 --> 0:03:33,000
He was cataloging the obligations

66
0:03:33.78,000 --> 0:03:35,000
of the governing to the governed.

67
0:03:38.22,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Now, you can spend years studying these frescoes.

68
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Some scholars have.

69
0:03:43.18,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I'm hardly an art historian,

70
0:03:45.34,000 --> 0:03:47,000
but I am passionate about art,

71
0:03:47.94,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and a work this massive can overwhelm me.

72
0:03:50.54,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So first, I focus on the big stuff.

73
0:03:55.62,000 --> 0:03:57,000
This is the allegory of good government.

74
0:03:59.58,000 --> 0:04:01,000
The majestic figure here in the middle

75
0:04:01.82,000 --> 0:04:03,000
is dressed in Siena's colors

76
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and he personifies the republic itself.

77
0:04:08.02,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Lorenzetti labels him "Commune,"

78
0:04:11.1,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and he's basically telling the Sienese

79
0:04:13.78,000 --> 0:04:17,000
that they, and not a king or a tyrant, must rule themselves.

80
0:04:18.94,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Now, surrounding Commune are his advisors.

81
0:04:25.58,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Justice is enthroned.

82
0:04:27.7,000 --> 0:04:3,000
She's looking up at the figure of wisdom,

83
0:04:30.86,000 --> 0:04:33,000
who actually supports her scales of justice.

84
0:04:36.82,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Concord, or Harmony,

85
0:04:39.38,000 --> 0:04:42,000
holds a string that comes off the scales of justice

86
0:04:42.54,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that binds her to the citizens,

87
0:04:44.58,000 --> 0:04:46,000
making them all compatriots in the republic.

88
0:04:50.02,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And finally we see Peace.

89
0:04:51.7,000 --> 0:04:52,000
She looks chilled out,

90
0:04:53.18,000 --> 0:04:55,000
like she's listening to Bob Marley.

91
0:04:55.58,000 --> 0:04:56,000
When good government rules,

92
0:04:57.58,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Peace doesn't break a sweat.

93
0:05:00.06,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Now, these are big images and big ideas,

94
0:05:02.5,000 --> 0:05:04,000
but I really love the small stuff.

95
0:05:05.3,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Along another wall,

96
0:05:06.74,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Lorenzetti illustrates the effects of good government

97
0:05:10.1,000 --> 0:05:12,000
on the real and everyday lives of ordinary people

98
0:05:12.5,000 --> 0:05:14,000
with a series of delicious little details.

99
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
In the countryside, the hills are landscaped and farmed.

100
0:05:23.1,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Crops are being sown, hoed, reaped, milled, plowed,

101
0:05:26.82,000 --> 0:05:27,000
all in one picture.

102
0:05:30.82,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Crops and livestock are being brought to market.

103
0:05:35.3,000 --> 0:05:37,000
In the city, builders raise a tower.

104
0:05:40.22,000 --> 0:05:43,000
People attend a law lecture, a TED Talk of the 14th century.

105
0:05:44.06,000 --> 0:05:45,000
(Laughter)

106
0:05:47.1,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Schoolchildren play.

107
0:05:50.86,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Tradesmen thrive.

108
0:05:54.82,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Dancers larger than life dance with joy.

109
0:06:00.22,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And watching over the republic is the winged figure Security,

110
0:06:04.38,000 --> 0:06:05,000
whose banner reads,

111
0:06:05.86,000 --> 0:06:08,000
"Everyone shall go forth freely without fear."

112
0:06:11.06,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Now, what's amazing about these images from 800 years ago

113
0:06:13.78,000 --> 0:06:14,000
is that they're familiar to us today.

114
0:06:16.34,000 --> 0:06:18,000
We see what democracy looks like.

115
0:06:18.7,000 --> 0:06:21,000
We experience the effects of good government in our lives,

116
0:06:22.14,000 --> 0:06:24,000
just as Lorenzetti did in his life.

117
0:06:26.78,000 --> 0:06:28,000
But it is the allegory of bad government

118
0:06:29.74,000 --> 0:06:31,000
that has been haunting me since November 9.

119
0:06:33.1,000 --> 0:06:34,000
It's badly damaged,

120
0:06:34.62,000 --> 0:06:35,000
but it reads like today's newspapers.

121
0:06:37.34,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And ruling over bad government is not the Commune

122
0:06:40.3,000 --> 0:06:41,000
but the Tyrant.

123
0:06:42.46,000 --> 0:06:45,000
He has horns, tusks, crossed eyes,

124
0:06:45.62,000 --> 0:06:46,000
braided hair.

125
0:06:47.18,000 --> 0:06:49,000
He obviously spends a lot of time on that hair.

126
0:06:49.62,000 --> 0:06:5,000
(Laughter)

127
0:06:50.78,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Justice now lies helpless at his feet,

128
0:06:55.1,000 --> 0:06:56,000
shackled.

129
0:06:56.42,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Her scales have been severed.

130
0:06:58.94,000 --> 0:07:,000
Justice is the key antagonist to the Tyrant,

131
0:07:01.94,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and she's been taken out.

132
0:07:04.46,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Now, surrounding the Tyrant,

133
0:07:05.86,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Lorenzetti illustrates the vices that animate bad government.

134
0:07:11.1,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Avarice is the old woman clutching the strongbox

135
0:07:14.82,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and a fisherman's hook

136
0:07:16.54,000 --> 0:07:17,000
to pull in her fortune.

137
0:07:20.9,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Vainglory carries a mirror,

138
0:07:23.94,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and Lorenzetti warns us against narcissistic leaders

139
0:07:27.02,000 --> 0:07:29,000
who are guided by their own ego and vanity.

140
0:07:31.34,000 --> 0:07:33,000
On the Tyrant's right is Cruelty.

141
0:07:39.22,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Treason, half lamb, half scorpion,

142
0:07:42.54,000 --> 0:07:44,000
lulls us into a false sense of security

143
0:07:45.3,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and then poisons a republic.

144
0:07:48.82,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Fraud, with the flighty wings of a bat.

145
0:07:56.86,000 --> 0:07:58,000
On the Tyrant's left, you see Division.

146
0:07:59.74,000 --> 0:08:,000
She's dressed in Siena's colors.

147
0:08:02.06,000 --> 0:08:05,000
"Si" and "No" are painted on her body.

148
0:08:05.54,000 --> 0:08:09,000
She uses a carpenter's saw to chop her body in half.

149
0:08:13.1,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And Fury wields the weapons of the mob,

150
0:08:16.06,000 --> 0:08:18,000
the stone and knife.

151
0:08:23.1,000 --> 0:08:25,000
In the remainder of the fresco, Lorenzetti shows us

152
0:08:25.54,000 --> 0:08:26,000
the inevitable effects of bad government.

153
0:08:27.98,000 --> 0:08:3,000
The civic ideals celebrated elsewhere in this room have failed us,

154
0:08:31.54,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and we see it.

155
0:08:33.1,000 --> 0:08:35,000
The once beautiful city has fallen to pieces,

156
0:08:35.86,000 --> 0:08:36,000
the countryside barren,

157
0:08:37.7,000 --> 0:08:38,000
the farms abandoned.

158
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Many are in flames.

159
0:08:41.9,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And in the sky above is not the winged figure Security,

160
0:08:45.78,000 --> 0:08:48,000
but that of Fear, whose banner reads:

161
0:08:49.46,000 --> 0:08:52,000
"None shall pass along this road

162
0:08:52.499,000 --> 0:08:54,000
without fear of death."

163
0:08:57.02,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Now, the final image, the most important one, really,

164
0:08:59.54,000 --> 0:09:,000
is one that Lorenzetti did not paint.

165
0:09:01.38,000 --> 0:09:02,000
It is of the viewer.

166
0:09:02.66,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Today, the audience for Lorenzetti's frescoes

167
0:09:05.46,000 --> 0:09:08,000
is not the governing but the governed,

168
0:09:08.94,000 --> 0:09:1,000
the individual who stands in front of his allegories

169
0:09:11.78,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and walks away with insight,

170
0:09:14.3,000 --> 0:09:16,000
who heeds a call to action.

171
0:09:17.34,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Lorenzetti warns us that we must recognize the shadows

172
0:09:20.06,000 --> 0:09:23,000
of Avarice, Fraud, Division, even Tyranny

173
0:09:23.98,000 --> 0:09:25,000
when they float across our political landscape,

174
0:09:26.7,000 --> 0:09:28,000
especially when those shadows are cast

175
0:09:29.54,000 --> 0:09:33,000
by political leaders loudly claiming to be the voice of good government

176
0:09:34.22,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and promising to make America great again.

177
0:09:38.7,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And we must act.

178
0:09:41.02,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Democracy must not be a spectator sport.

179
0:09:43.7,000 --> 0:09:45,000
The right to protest, the right to assemble freely,

180
0:09:46.14,000 --> 0:09:47,000
the right to petition one's government,

181
0:09:48.06,000 --> 0:09:49,000
these are not just rights.

182
0:09:49.9,000 --> 0:09:51,000
In the face of Avarice, Fraud and Division,

183
0:09:52.42,000 --> 0:09:53,000
these are obligations.

184
0:09:54.78,000 --> 0:09:55,000
We have to disrupt --

185
0:09:56.1,000 --> 0:09:58,000
(Applause)

186
0:10:01.54,000 --> 0:10:03,000
We have to disrupt our lives

187
0:10:03.74,000 --> 0:10:04,000
so that we can disrupt

188
0:10:05.42,000 --> 0:10:07,000
the amoral accretion of power

189
0:10:08.18,000 --> 0:10:12,000
by those who would betray our values.

190
0:10:12.86,000 --> 0:10:13,000
We and we the people

191
0:10:14.78,000 --> 0:10:15,000
must raise justice up

192
0:10:16.66,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and must bring peace to our nation

193
0:10:18.62,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and must come together in concord,

194
0:10:20.82,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and we have a choice.

195
0:10:23.62,000 --> 0:10:24,000
We could either paint ourselves

196
0:10:25.18,000 --> 0:10:28,000
into the worst nightmare of Lorenzetti's bad government,

197
0:10:29.14,000 --> 0:10:3,000
or we can stay in the streets,

198
0:10:31.94,000 --> 0:10:33,000
disruptive, messy, loud.

199
0:10:35.5,000 --> 0:10:37,000
That is what democracy looks like.

200
0:10:38.86,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Thank you.

201
0:10:40.1,000 --> 0:10:43,000
(Applause)

202
0:10:51.22,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Chris Anderson: First of all, wow.

203
0:10:53.18,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Obviously, many people passionately --

204
0:10:55.62,000 --> 0:10:57,000
you spoke to many people passionately here.

205
0:10:57.66,000 --> 0:10:58,000
I'm sure there are other people here

206
0:10:59.42,000 --> 0:11:03,000
who'd say, look, Trump was elected by 63 million people.

207
0:11:04.14,000 --> 0:11:05,000
He's far from perfect,

208
0:11:05.5,000 --> 0:11:07,000
but he's trying to do what he was elected to do.

209
0:11:08.5,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Shouldn't you give him a chance?

210
0:11:10.54,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Anthony Romero: I think we have to recognize

211
0:11:12.66,000 --> 0:11:14,000
the legitimacy of him as president

212
0:11:15.46,000 --> 0:11:17,000
versus the legitimacy of his policies.

213
0:11:18.38,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And when so many of the policies are contrary to fundamental values,

214
0:11:24.18,000 --> 0:11:25,000
that we're all equal under the law,

215
0:11:26.14,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that we're not judged by the color of our skin or the religion we worship,

216
0:11:29.74,000 --> 0:11:31,000
we have to contest those values

217
0:11:32.5,000 --> 0:11:34,000
even as we recognize and honor the fact

218
0:11:34.78,000 --> 0:11:38,000
that our democracy rendered us a president who is championing those values.

219
0:11:40.22,000 --> 0:11:43,000
CA: And the ACLU isn't just this force on the left, right?

220
0:11:44.06,000 --> 0:11:46,000
You're making other arguments as well.

221
0:11:46.5,000 --> 0:11:48,000
AR: Well, you know,

222
0:11:49.14,000 --> 0:11:51,000
very often we piss everyone off at one point.

223
0:11:51.3,000 --> 0:11:52,000
That's what we do.

224
0:11:52.82,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And we recently were taking stands

225
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
for why Ann Coulter needs to be able to speak at Berkeley,

226
0:11:58.62,000 --> 0:12:,000
and why Milo has free speech rights.

227
0:12:01.06,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And we even wrote a blog

228
0:12:02.66,000 --> 0:12:05,000
that almost burnt the house down among some of our members,

229
0:12:06.34,000 --> 0:12:08,000
unfortunately, when we talked about the fact

230
0:12:08.46,000 --> 0:12:11,000
that even Donald Trump has free speech rights as president,

231
0:12:11.94,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and an effort to hold him accountable

232
0:12:14.02,000 --> 0:12:18,000
for incitement of violence at his marches or his rallies

233
0:12:18.62,000 --> 0:12:21,000
is unconstitutional and un-American.

234
0:12:21.82,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And when you put that statement out there

235
0:12:24.02,000 --> 0:12:25,000
to a very frothy base

236
0:12:25.7,000 --> 0:12:28,000
that always is very excited for you to fight Donald Trump,

237
0:12:29.02,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and then you have a new one saying, "Wait, these rights are for everybody,

238
0:12:32.54,000 --> 0:12:33,000
even the president that we don't like."

239
0:12:34.46,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And that's our job.

240
0:12:36.06,000 --> 0:12:39,000
(Applause)

241
0:12:39.22,000 --> 0:12:41,000
CA: Anthony, you spoke to so many of us so powerfully.

242
0:12:41.82,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Thank you so much. Thank you.

243
0:12:43.42,000 --> 0:12:45,000
(Applause)

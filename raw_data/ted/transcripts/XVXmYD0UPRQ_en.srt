1
0:00:13.596,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Here are two reasons companies fail:

2
0:00:17.208,000 --> 0:00:18,000
they only do more of the same,

3
0:00:20.478,000 --> 0:00:22,000
or they only do what's new.

4
0:00:23.613,000 --> 0:00:27,000
To me the real, real solution to quality growth

5
0:00:28.537,000 --> 0:00:31,000
is figuring out the balance between two activities:

6
0:00:32.126,000 --> 0:00:34,000
exploration and exploitation.

7
0:00:35.114,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Both are necessary,

8
0:00:36.728,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but it can be too much of a good thing.

9
0:00:41.154,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Consider Facit.

10
0:00:43.061,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I'm actually old enough to remember them.

11
0:00:45.489,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Facit was a fantastic company.

12
0:00:47.999,000 --> 0:00:49,000
They were born deep in the Swedish forest,

13
0:00:50.496,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and they made the best mechanical calculators in the world.

14
0:00:54.524,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Everybody used them.

15
0:00:56.798,000 --> 0:01:,000
And what did Facit do when the electronic calculator came along?

16
0:01:01.691,000 --> 0:01:03,000
They continued doing exactly the same.

17
0:01:04.953,000 --> 0:01:07,000
In six months, they went from maximum revenue ...

18
0:01:08.695,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and they were gone.

19
0:01:10.649,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Gone.

20
0:01:11.824,000 --> 0:01:14,000
To me, the irony about the Facit story

21
0:01:15.72,000 --> 0:01:18,000
is hearing about the Facit engineers,

22
0:01:19.01,000 --> 0:01:24,000
who had bought cheap, small electronic calculators in Japan

23
0:01:24.117,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that they used to double-check their calculators.

24
0:01:27.802,000 --> 0:01:28,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:29.239,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Facit did too much exploitation.

26
0:01:32.422,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But exploration can go wild, too.

27
0:01:34.9,000 --> 0:01:35,000
A few years back,

28
0:01:36.075,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I worked closely alongside a European biotech company.

29
0:01:40.447,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Let's call them OncoSearch.

30
0:01:42.83,000 --> 0:01:43,000
The company was brilliant.

31
0:01:44.511,000 --> 0:01:48,000
They had applications that promised to diagnose, even cure,

32
0:01:49.153,000 --> 0:01:51,000
certain forms of blood cancer.

33
0:01:52.19,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Every day was about creating something new.

34
0:01:55.744,000 --> 0:01:57,000
They were extremely innovative,

35
0:01:58.272,000 --> 0:02:,000
and the mantra was, "When we only get it right,"

36
0:02:01.172,000 --> 0:02:03,000
or even, "We want it perfect."

37
0:02:04.687,000 --> 0:02:05,000
The sad thing is,

38
0:02:06.568,000 --> 0:02:07,000
before they became perfect --

39
0:02:08.49,000 --> 0:02:09,000
even good enough --

40
0:02:10.443,000 --> 0:02:11,000
they became obsolete.

41
0:02:13.331,000 --> 0:02:16,000
OncoSearch did too much exploration.

42
0:02:17.602,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I first heard about exploration and exploitation about 15 years ago,

43
0:02:23.381,000 --> 0:02:26,000
when I worked as a visiting scholar at Stanford University.

44
0:02:27.428,000 --> 0:02:29,000
The founder of the idea is Jim March.

45
0:02:30.168,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And to me the power of the idea is its practicality.

46
0:02:35.168,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Exploration.

47
0:02:36.847,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Exploration is about coming up with what's new.

48
0:02:40.772,000 --> 0:02:41,000
It's about search,

49
0:02:42.027,000 --> 0:02:43,000
it's about discovery,

50
0:02:43.494,000 --> 0:02:44,000
it's about new products,

51
0:02:45.08,000 --> 0:02:46,000
it's about new innovations.

52
0:02:47.591,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It's about changing our frontiers.

53
0:02:51.408,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Our heroes are people who have done exploration:

54
0:02:54.867,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Madame Curie,

55
0:02:56.232,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Picasso,

56
0:02:57.414,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Neil Armstrong,

57
0:02:58.612,000 --> 0:03:,000
Sir Edmund Hillary, etc.

58
0:03:01.21,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I come from Norway;

59
0:03:03.569,000 --> 0:03:07,000
all our heroes are explorers, and they deserve to be.

60
0:03:09.364,000 --> 0:03:12,000
We all know that exploration is risky.

61
0:03:12.454,000 --> 0:03:13,000
We don't know the answers,

62
0:03:14.297,000 --> 0:03:16,000
we don't know if we're going to find them,

63
0:03:16.392,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and we know that the risks are high.

64
0:03:18.693,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Exploitation is the opposite.

65
0:03:20.608,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Exploitation is taking the knowledge we have

66
0:03:23.709,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and making good, better.

67
0:03:26.344,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Exploitation is about making our trains run on time.

68
0:03:29.984,000 --> 0:03:32,000
It's about making good products faster and cheaper.

69
0:03:34.9,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Exploitation is not risky --

70
0:03:37.911,000 --> 0:03:38,000
in the short term.

71
0:03:39.595,000 --> 0:03:4,000
But if we only exploit,

72
0:03:41.425,000 --> 0:03:43,000
it's very risky in the long term.

73
0:03:44.503,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And I think we all have memories of the famous pop groups

74
0:03:48.285,000 --> 0:03:5,000
who keep singing the same songs again and again,

75
0:03:51.719,000 --> 0:03:54,000
until they become obsolete or even pathetic.

76
0:03:56.204,000 --> 0:03:58,000
That's the risk of exploitation.

77
0:04:00.667,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So if we take a long-term perspective, we explore.

78
0:04:05.427,000 --> 0:04:08,000
If we take a short-term perspective, we exploit.

79
0:04:09.693,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Small children, they explore all day.

80
0:04:12.88,000 --> 0:04:13,000
All day it's about exploration.

81
0:04:15.326,000 --> 0:04:16,000
As we grow older,

82
0:04:16.763,000 --> 0:04:19,000
we explore less because we have more knowledge to exploit on.

83
0:04:21.82,000 --> 0:04:22,000
The same goes for companies.

84
0:04:24.706,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Companies become, by nature, less innovative

85
0:04:28.594,000 --> 0:04:29,000
as they become more competent.

86
0:04:31.239,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And this is, of course, a big worry to CEOs.

87
0:04:35.41,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And I hear very often questions phrased in different ways.

88
0:04:39.943,000 --> 0:04:4,000
For example,

89
0:04:41.125,000 --> 0:04:45,000
"How can I both effectively run and reinvent my company?"

90
0:04:46.557,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Or, "How can I make sure

91
0:04:48.475,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that our company changes before we become obsolete

92
0:04:52.86,000 --> 0:04:53,000
or are hit by a crisis?"

93
0:04:55.584,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So, doing one well is difficult.

94
0:04:58.164,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Doing both well as the same time is art --

95
0:05:01.955,000 --> 0:05:03,000
pushing both exploration and exploitation.

96
0:05:05.138,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So one thing we've found

97
0:05:06.658,000 --> 0:05:12,000
is only about two percent of companies are able to effectively explore

98
0:05:13.378,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and exploit at the same time, in parallel.

99
0:05:17.57,000 --> 0:05:18,000
But when they do,

100
0:05:19.478,000 --> 0:05:2,000
the payoffs are huge.

101
0:05:22.337,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So we have lots of great examples.

102
0:05:24.75,000 --> 0:05:26,000
We have Nestlé creating Nespresso,

103
0:05:27.49,000 --> 0:05:3,000
we have Lego going into animated films,

104
0:05:30.536,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Toyota creating the hybrids,

105
0:05:32.966,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Unilever pushing into sustainability --

106
0:05:35.461,000 --> 0:05:38,000
there are lots of examples, and the benefits are huge.

107
0:05:39.812,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Why is balancing so difficult?

108
0:05:42.846,000 --> 0:05:44,000
I think it's difficult because there are so many traps

109
0:05:45.5,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that keep us where we are.

110
0:05:47.975,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So I'll talk about two, but there are many.

111
0:05:51.098,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So let's talk about the perpetual search trap.

112
0:05:54.616,000 --> 0:05:55,000
We discover something,

113
0:05:56.452,000 --> 0:05:58,000
but we don't have the patience or the persistence

114
0:05:59.331,000 --> 0:06:01,000
to get at it and make it work.

115
0:06:01.683,000 --> 0:06:04,000
So instead of staying with it, we create something new.

116
0:06:04.852,000 --> 0:06:05,000
But the same goes for that,

117
0:06:06.176,000 --> 0:06:07,000
then we're in the vicious circle

118
0:06:07.951,000 --> 0:06:1,000
of actually coming up with ideas but being frustrated.

119
0:06:12.381,000 --> 0:06:14,000
OncoSearch was a good example.

120
0:06:14.725,000 --> 0:06:16,000
A famous example is, of course, Xerox.

121
0:06:18.607,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But we don't only see this in companies.

122
0:06:20.731,000 --> 0:06:22,000
We see this in the public sector as well.

123
0:06:23.726,000 --> 0:06:28,000
We all know that any kind of effective reform of education,

124
0:06:29.472,000 --> 0:06:31,000
research, health care, even defense,

125
0:06:31.923,000 --> 0:06:34,000
takes 10, 15, maybe 20 years to work.

126
0:06:35.766,000 --> 0:06:37,000
But still, we change much more often.

127
0:06:39.09,000 --> 0:06:4,000
We really don't give them the chance.

128
0:06:42.424,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Another trap is the success trap.

129
0:06:46.808,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Facit fell into the success trap.

130
0:06:50.275,000 --> 0:06:53,000
They literally held the future in their hands,

131
0:06:53.549,000 --> 0:06:54,000
but they couldn't see it.

132
0:06:54.787,000 --> 0:06:57,000
They were simply so good at making what they loved doing,

133
0:06:58.566,000 --> 0:06:59,000
that they wouldn't change.

134
0:07:01.187,000 --> 0:07:02,000
We are like that, too.

135
0:07:02.504,000 --> 0:07:04,000
When we know something well, it's difficult to change.

136
0:07:06.872,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Bill Gates has said:

137
0:07:09.016,000 --> 0:07:12,000
"Success is a lousy teacher.

138
0:07:12.04,000 --> 0:07:15,000
It seduces us into thinking we cannot fail."

139
0:07:16.457,000 --> 0:07:17,000
That's the challenge with success.

140
0:07:19.886,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So I think there are some lessons, and I think they apply to us.

141
0:07:23.364,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And they apply to our companies.

142
0:07:25.57,000 --> 0:07:28,000
The first lesson is: get ahead of the crisis.

143
0:07:29.949,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And any company that's able to innovate

144
0:07:32.542,000 --> 0:07:35,000
is actually able to also buy an insurance in the future.

145
0:07:36.709,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Netflix -- they could so easily have been content

146
0:07:39.596,000 --> 0:07:41,000
with earlier generations of distribution,

147
0:07:42.484,000 --> 0:07:44,000
but they always -- and I think they will always --

148
0:07:45.065,000 --> 0:07:46,000
keep pushing for the next battle.

149
0:07:47.572,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I see other companies that say,

150
0:07:49.961,000 --> 0:07:53,000
"I'll win the next innovation cycle, whatever it takes."

151
0:07:55.635,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Second one: think in multiple time scales.

152
0:07:58.918,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I'll share a chart with you,

153
0:08:00.28,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and I think it's a wonderful one.

154
0:08:02.461,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Any company we look at,

155
0:08:04.198,000 --> 0:08:05,000
taking a one-year perspective

156
0:08:06.021,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and looking at the valuation of the company,

157
0:08:08.322,000 --> 0:08:11,000
innovation typically accounts for only about 30 percent.

158
0:08:12.187,000 --> 0:08:13,000
So when we think one year,

159
0:08:13.598,000 --> 0:08:15,000
innovation isn't really that important.

160
0:08:16.49,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Move ahead, take a 10-year perspective on the same company --

161
0:08:20.082,000 --> 0:08:25,000
suddenly, innovation and ability to renew account for 70 percent.

162
0:08:26.253,000 --> 0:08:27,000
But companies can't choose.

163
0:08:27.754,000 --> 0:08:3,000
They need to fund the journey and lead the long term.

164
0:08:32.746,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Third:

165
0:08:34.304,000 --> 0:08:35,000
invite talent.

166
0:08:35.974,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I don't think it's possible for any of us

167
0:08:38.546,000 --> 0:08:42,000
to be able to balance exploration and exploitation by ourselves.

168
0:08:43.1,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I think it's a team sport.

169
0:08:44.83,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I think we need to allow challenging.

170
0:08:48.273,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I think the mark of a great company is being open to be challenged,

171
0:08:53.187,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and the mark of a good corporate board is to constructively challenge.

172
0:08:58.264,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I think that's also what good parenting is about.

173
0:09:02.858,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Last one: be skeptical of success.

174
0:09:06.133,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Maybe it's useful to think back at the old triumph marches in Rome,

175
0:09:12.49,000 --> 0:09:15,000
when the generals, after a big victory,

176
0:09:16.01,000 --> 0:09:18,000
were given their celebration.

177
0:09:18.754,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Riding into Rome on the carriage,

178
0:09:21.513,000 --> 0:09:25,000
they always had a companion whispering in their ear,

179
0:09:25.759,000 --> 0:09:27,000
"Remember, you're only human."

180
0:09:29.923,000 --> 0:09:31,000
So I hope I made the point:

181
0:09:32.701,000 --> 0:09:35,000
balancing exploration and exploitation

182
0:09:35.747,000 --> 0:09:36,000
has a huge payoff.

183
0:09:37.218,000 --> 0:09:39,000
But it's difficult, and we need to be conscious.

184
0:09:40.338,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I want to just point out two questions that I think are useful.

185
0:09:45.397,000 --> 0:09:48,000
First question is, looking at your own company:

186
0:09:49.446,000 --> 0:09:53,000
In which areas do you see that the company is at the risk

187
0:09:53.78,000 --> 0:09:55,000
of falling into success traps,

188
0:09:56.048,000 --> 0:09:58,000
of just going on autopilot?

189
0:09:59.105,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And what can you do to challenge?

190
0:10:03.639,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Second question is:

191
0:10:06.53,000 --> 0:10:09,000
When did I explore something new last,

192
0:10:09.815,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and what kind of effect did it have on me?

193
0:10:12.814,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Is that something I should do more of?

194
0:10:15.596,000 --> 0:10:16,000
In my case, yes.

195
0:10:18.657,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So let me leave you with this.

196
0:10:20.692,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Whether you're an explorer by nature

197
0:10:23.997,000 --> 0:10:26,000
or whether you tend to exploit what you already know,

198
0:10:27.923,000 --> 0:10:31,000
don't forget: the beauty is in the balance.

199
0:10:33.392,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Thank you.

200
0:10:34.576,000 --> 0:10:36,000
(Applause)

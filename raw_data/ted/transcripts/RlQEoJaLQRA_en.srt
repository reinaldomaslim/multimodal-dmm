1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
The new me is beauty.

2
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Yeah, people used to say, "Norman's OK,

4
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
but if you followed what he said, everything would be usable

5
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
but it would be ugly."

6
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Well, I didn't have that in mind, so ...

7
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
This is neat.

8
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Thank you for setting up my display.

9
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I mean, it's just wonderful.

10
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And I haven't the slightest idea of what it does or what it's good for,

11
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
but I want it.

12
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And that's my new life.

13
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
My new life is trying to understand what beauty is about,

14
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and "pretty," and "emotions."

15
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
The new me is all about making things kind of neat and fun.

16
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And so this is a Philippe Starck juicer, produced by Alessi.

17
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
It's just neat; it's fun. It's so much fun I have it in my house --

18
0:01:00.88,000 --> 0:01:03,000
but I have it in the entryway, I don't use it to make juice.

19
0:01:03.88,000 --> 0:01:05,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:05.88,000 --> 0:01:09,000
In fact, I bought the gold-plated special edition

21
0:01:09.88,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and it comes with a little slip of paper

22
0:01:11.88,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that says, "Don't use this juicer to make juice."

23
0:01:14.88,000 --> 0:01:17,000
The acid will ruin the gold plating.

24
0:01:17.88,000 --> 0:01:18,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:18.88,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So actually, I took a carton of orange juice

26
0:01:20.88,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and I poured it in the glass to take this picture.

27
0:01:22.88,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:25.88,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Beneath it is a wonderful knife.

29
0:01:27.88,000 --> 0:01:3,000
It's a Global cutting knife made in Japan.

30
0:01:30.88,000 --> 0:01:34,000
First of all, look at the shape -- it's just wonderful to look at.

31
0:01:35.08,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Second of all, it's really beautifully balanced:

32
0:01:38.08,000 --> 0:01:39,000
it holds well, it feels well.

33
0:01:39.48,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And third of all, it's so sharp, it just cuts.

34
0:01:41.48,000 --> 0:01:43,000
It's a delight to use.

35
0:01:43.48,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And so it's got everything, right?

36
0:01:45.48,000 --> 0:01:47,000
It's beautiful and it's functional.

37
0:01:47.48,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And I can tell you stories about it,

38
0:01:49.48,000 --> 0:01:51,000
which makes it reflective,

39
0:01:51.48,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and so you'll see I have a theory of emotion.

40
0:01:53.48,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And those are the three components.

41
0:01:55.48,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Hiroshi Ishii and his group at the MIT Media Lab

42
0:01:58.48,000 --> 0:02:01,000
took a ping-pong table and placed a projector above it,

43
0:02:01.48,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and on the ping-pong table they projected an image of water

44
0:02:04.48,000 --> 0:02:06,000
with fish swimming in it.

45
0:02:06.48,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And as you play ping-pong, whenever the ball hits part of the table,

46
0:02:09.48,000 --> 0:02:11,000
the ripples spread out and the fish run away.

47
0:02:11.48,000 --> 0:02:13,000
But of course, then the ball hits the other side,

48
0:02:13.48,000 --> 0:02:16,000
the ripples hit the -- poor fish, they can't find any peace and quiet.

49
0:02:16.48,000 --> 0:02:17,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:17.48,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Is that a good way to play ping-pong?

51
0:02:19.48,000 --> 0:02:21,000
No. But is it fun?

52
0:02:21.48,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Yeah! Yeah.

53
0:02:24.48,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Or look at Google.

54
0:02:26.48,000 --> 0:02:31,000
If you type in, oh say, "emotion and design,"

55
0:02:31.48,000 --> 0:02:33,000
you get 10 pages of results.

56
0:02:33.48,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So Google just took their logo and they spread it out.

57
0:02:36.48,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Instead of saying, "You got 73,000 results.

58
0:02:38.48,000 --> 0:02:4,000
This is one through 20. Next,"

59
0:02:40.48,000 --> 0:02:42,000
they just give you as many o's as there are pages.

60
0:02:42.52,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It's really simple and subtle.

61
0:02:44.52,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I bet a lot of you have seen it and never noticed it.

62
0:02:47.52,000 --> 0:02:49,000
That's the subconscious mind

63
0:02:49.52,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that sort of notices it -- it probably is kind of pleasant

64
0:02:51.52,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and you didn't know why.

65
0:02:53.52,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And it's just clever.

66
0:02:55.52,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And of course, what's especially good is,

67
0:02:57.52,000 --> 0:02:59,000
if you type "design and emotion,"

68
0:02:59.52,000 --> 0:03:03,000
the first response out of those 10 pages is my website.

69
0:03:03.52,000 --> 0:03:05,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:05.52,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Now, the weird thing is Google lies,

71
0:03:08.52,000 --> 0:03:1,000
because if I type "design and emotion,"

72
0:03:10.52,000 --> 0:03:13,000
it says, "You don't need the 'and.' We do it anyway."

73
0:03:13.52,000 --> 0:03:15,000
So, OK.

74
0:03:15.52,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So I type "design emotion"

75
0:03:17.52,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and my website wasn't first again.

76
0:03:19.52,000 --> 0:03:21,000
It was third.

77
0:03:21.52,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Oh well, different story.

78
0:03:24.24,000 --> 0:03:27,000
There was this wonderful review in The New York Times

79
0:03:27.24,000 --> 0:03:29,000
about the MINI Cooper automobile.

80
0:03:29.24,000 --> 0:03:32,000
It said, "You know, this is a car that has lots of faults.

81
0:03:32.52,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Buy it anyway.

82
0:03:34.52,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It's so much fun to drive."

83
0:03:36.52,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And if you look at the inside of the car --

84
0:03:39.52,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I mean, I loved it, I wanted to see it, I rented it,

85
0:03:41.52,000 --> 0:03:44,000
this is me taking a picture while my son is driving --

86
0:03:44.52,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and the inside of the car, the whole design is fun.

87
0:03:47.52,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It's round, it's neat.

88
0:03:49.52,000 --> 0:03:51,000
The controls work wonderfully.

89
0:03:51.52,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So that's my new life; it's all about fun.

90
0:03:54.52,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I really have the feeling that pleasant things work better,

91
0:03:57.52,000 --> 0:04:,000
and that never made any sense to me

92
0:04:00.52,000 --> 0:04:02,000
until I finally figured out -- look ...

93
0:04:04.52,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I'm going to put a plank on the ground.

94
0:04:06.52,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So, imagine I have a plank about two feet wide and 30 feet long

95
0:04:09.52,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and I'm going to walk on it, and you see I can walk on it without looking,

96
0:04:12.52,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I can go back and forth and I can jump up and down.

97
0:04:14.52,000 --> 0:04:16,000
No problem.

98
0:04:16.52,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Now I'm going to put the plank 300 feet in the air --

99
0:04:20.52,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and I'm not going to go near it, thank you.

100
0:04:25.8,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Intense fear paralyzes you.

101
0:04:27.8,000 --> 0:04:3,000
It actually affects the way the brain works.

102
0:04:30.8,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So, Paul Saffo, before his talk said that he didn't really have it down

103
0:04:34.8,000 --> 0:04:36,000
until just a few days or hours before the talk,

104
0:04:36.8,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and that anxiety was really helpful in causing him to focus.

105
0:04:40.8,000 --> 0:04:42,000
That's what fear and anxiety does;

106
0:04:42.8,000 --> 0:04:45,000
it causes you to be -- what's called depth-first processing --

107
0:04:45.8,000 --> 0:04:48,000
to focus, not be distracted.

108
0:04:48.8,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And I couldn't force myself across that.

109
0:04:51.8,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Now some people can -- circus workers, steel workers.

110
0:04:54.8,000 --> 0:04:56,000
But it really changes the way you think.

111
0:04:56.8,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And then, a psychologist, Alice Isen,

112
0:04:59.8,000 --> 0:05:01,000
did this wonderful experiment.

113
0:05:01.8,000 --> 0:05:03,000
She brought students in to solve problems.

114
0:05:03.8,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So, she'd bring people into the room,

115
0:05:05.8,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and there'd be a string hanging down here

116
0:05:07.8,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and a string hanging down here.

117
0:05:09.8,000 --> 0:05:12,000
It was an empty room, except for a table with a bunch of crap on it --

118
0:05:12.8,000 --> 0:05:14,000
some papers and scissors and stuff.

119
0:05:14.8,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And she'd bring them in,

120
0:05:16.8,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and she'd say,

121
0:05:18.8,000 --> 0:05:21,000
"This is an IQ test and it determines how well you do in life.

122
0:05:21.8,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Would you tie those two strings together?"

123
0:05:24.8,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So they'd take one string and they'd pull it over here

124
0:05:27.8,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and they couldn't reach the other string.

125
0:05:30.8,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Still can't reach it.

126
0:05:32.8,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And, basically, none of them could solve it.

127
0:05:35.8,000 --> 0:05:38,000
You bring in a second group of people,

128
0:05:38.8,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and you say, "Oh, before we start,

129
0:05:41.8,000 --> 0:05:44,000
I got this box of candy, and I don't eat candy.

130
0:05:44.8,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Would you like the box of candy?"

131
0:05:46.8,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And turns out they liked it, and it made them happy --

132
0:05:49.8,000 --> 0:05:51,000
not very happy, but a little bit of happy.

133
0:05:51.8,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And guess what -- they solved the problem.

134
0:05:53.8,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And it turns out that when you're anxious

135
0:05:56.8,000 --> 0:05:59,000
you squirt neural transmitters in the brain, which focuses you

136
0:05:59.8,000 --> 0:06:01,000
makes you depth-first.

137
0:06:01.8,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And when you're happy -- what we call positive valence --

138
0:06:04.8,000 --> 0:06:06,000
you squirt dopamine into the prefrontal lobes,

139
0:06:06.8,000 --> 0:06:08,000
which makes you a breadth-first problem solver:

140
0:06:08.8,000 --> 0:06:11,000
you're more susceptible to interruption; you do out-of-the-box thinking.

141
0:06:11.8,000 --> 0:06:14,000
That's what brainstorming is about, right?

142
0:06:14.8,000 --> 0:06:17,000
With brainstorming we make you happy, we play games,

143
0:06:17.8,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and we say, "No criticism,"

144
0:06:19.8,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and you get all these weird, neat ideas.

145
0:06:21.8,000 --> 0:06:24,000
But in fact, if that's how you always were you'd never get any work done

146
0:06:24.8,000 --> 0:06:27,000
because you'd be working along and say, "Oh, I got a new way of doing it."

147
0:06:27.8,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So to get work done, you've got to set a deadline, right?

148
0:06:31.8,000 --> 0:06:33,000
You've got be anxious.

149
0:06:33.8,000 --> 0:06:35,000
The brain works differently

150
0:06:35.8,000 --> 0:06:38,000
if you're happy. Things work better because you're more creative.

151
0:06:38.8,000 --> 0:06:41,000
You get a little problem, you say, "Ah, I'll figure it out."

152
0:06:41.8,000 --> 0:06:43,000
No big deal.

153
0:06:43.8,000 --> 0:06:46,000
There's something I call the visceral level of processing, and there will be visceral-level design.

154
0:06:47.24,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Biology -- we have co-adapted through biology to like bright colors.

155
0:06:51.24,000 --> 0:06:55,000
That's especially good that mammals and primates like fruits

156
0:06:55.24,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and bright plants, because you eat the fruit

157
0:06:57.24,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and you thereby spread the seed.

158
0:06:59.24,000 --> 0:07:02,000
There's an amazing amount of stuff that's built into the brain.

159
0:07:02.24,000 --> 0:07:05,000
We dislike bitter tastes, we dislike loud sounds,

160
0:07:05.24,000 --> 0:07:07,000
we dislike hot temperatures, cold temperatures.

161
0:07:07.24,000 --> 0:07:11,000
We dislike scolding voices. We dislike frowning faces;

162
0:07:11.24,000 --> 0:07:13,000
we like symmetrical faces, etc., etc.

163
0:07:15.64,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So that's the visceral level.

164
0:07:17.64,000 --> 0:07:2,000
In design, you can express visceral in lots of ways,

165
0:07:20.64,000 --> 0:07:25,000
like the choice of type fonts and the red for hot, exciting.

166
0:07:25.64,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Or the 1963 Jaguar:

167
0:07:27.64,000 --> 0:07:3,000
It's actually a crummy car, falls apart all the time,

168
0:07:30.64,000 --> 0:07:32,000
but the owners love it.

169
0:07:32.64,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And it's beautiful -- it's in the Museum of Modern Art.

170
0:07:34.64,000 --> 0:07:36,000
A water bottle:

171
0:07:36.64,000 --> 0:07:39,000
You buy it because of the bottle, not because of the water.

172
0:07:39.64,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And when people are finished, they don't throw it away.

173
0:07:42.64,000 --> 0:07:45,000
They keep it for -- you know, it's like the old wine bottles, you keep it for decoration

174
0:07:45.64,000 --> 0:07:48,000
or maybe fill it with water again, which proves it's not the water.

175
0:07:48.64,000 --> 0:07:52,000
It's all about the visceral experience.

176
0:07:53.36,000 --> 0:07:57,000
The middle level of processing is the behavioral level

177
0:07:57.36,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and that's actually where most of our stuff gets done.

178
0:07:59.36,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Visceral is subconscious, you're unaware of it.

179
0:08:01.36,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Behavioral is subconscious, you're unaware of it.

180
0:08:04.36,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Almost everything we do is subconscious.

181
0:08:06.36,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I'm walking around the stage -- I'm not attending to the control of my legs.

182
0:08:10.36,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I'm doing a lot; most of my talk is subconscious;

183
0:08:13.36,000 --> 0:08:15,000
it has been rehearsed and thought about a lot.

184
0:08:15.36,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Most of what we do is subconscious.

185
0:08:17.36,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Automatic behavior -- skilled behavior -- is subconscious,

186
0:08:20.36,000 --> 0:08:22,000
controlled by the behavioral side.

187
0:08:22.36,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And behavioral design is all about feeling in control,

188
0:08:26.36,000 --> 0:08:29,000
which includes usability, understanding --

189
0:08:29.36,000 --> 0:08:31,000
but also the feel and heft.

190
0:08:31.36,000 --> 0:08:33,000
That's why the Global knives are so neat.

191
0:08:33.36,000 --> 0:08:35,000
They're so nicely balanced, so sharp,

192
0:08:35.36,000 --> 0:08:37,000
that you really feel you're in control of the cutting.

193
0:08:37.36,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Or, just driving a high-performance sports car

194
0:08:40.44,000 --> 0:08:42,000
over a demanding curb --

195
0:08:42.44,000 --> 0:08:45,000
again, feeling that you are in complete control of the environment.

196
0:08:45.44,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Or the sensual feeling.

197
0:08:47.44,000 --> 0:08:49,000
This is a Kohler shower, a waterfall shower,

198
0:08:49.44,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and actually, all those knobs beneath are also showerheads.

199
0:08:52.44,000 --> 0:08:54,000
It will squirt you all around

200
0:08:54.44,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and you can stay in that shower for hours --

201
0:08:56.44,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and not waste water, by the way,

202
0:08:58.44,000 --> 0:09:,000
because it recirculates the same dirty water.

203
0:09:00.44,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Laughter)

204
0:09:03.44,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Or this -- this is a really neat teapot I found

205
0:09:05.44,000 --> 0:09:09,000
at high tea at The Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago.

206
0:09:09.44,000 --> 0:09:11,000
It's a Ronnefeldt tilting teapot.

207
0:09:11.44,000 --> 0:09:13,000
That's kind of what the teapot looks like

208
0:09:13.44,000 --> 0:09:17,000
but the way you use it is you lay it on its back,

209
0:09:17.72,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and you put tea in,

210
0:09:19.72,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and then you fill it with water.

211
0:09:21.72,000 --> 0:09:24,000
The water then seeps over the tea.

212
0:09:24.72,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right --

213
0:09:27.72,000 --> 0:09:29,000
the tea is to the right of this line.

214
0:09:29.72,000 --> 0:09:31,000
There's a little ledge inside, so the tea is sitting there

215
0:09:31.72,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and the water is filling it up like that.

216
0:09:33.72,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And when the tea is ready, or almost ready, you tilt it.

217
0:09:36.72,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And that means the tea is partially covered

218
0:09:39.72,000 --> 0:09:41,000
while it completes the brewing.

219
0:09:41.72,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And when it's finished, you put it vertically,

220
0:09:43.72,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and now the tea is -- you remember -- above this line

221
0:09:45.72,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and the water only comes to here --

222
0:09:48.72,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and so it keeps the tea out.

223
0:09:50.72,000 --> 0:09:52,000
On top of that, it communicates,

224
0:09:52.72,000 --> 0:09:54,000
which is what emotion does.

225
0:09:54.72,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Emotion is all about acting; emotion is really about acting.

226
0:09:57.72,000 --> 0:09:59,000
It's being safe in the world.

227
0:09:59.72,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Cognition is about understanding the world, emotion is about interpreting it --

228
0:10:03.72,000 --> 0:10:05,000
saying good, bad, safe, dangerous,

229
0:10:05.72,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and getting us ready to act, which is why the muscles tense or relax.

230
0:10:08.72,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And that's why we can tell the emotion of somebody else --

231
0:10:12.72,000 --> 0:10:14,000
because their muscles are acting, subconsciously,

232
0:10:14.72,000 --> 0:10:2,000
except that we've evolved to make the facial muscles really rich with emotion.

233
0:10:20.72,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Well, this has emotions if you like,

234
0:10:22.72,000 --> 0:10:26,000
because it signals the waiter that, "Hey, I'm finished. See -- upright."

235
0:10:26.72,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And the waiter can come by and say, "Would you like more water?"

236
0:10:29.72,000 --> 0:10:31,000
It's kind of neat. What a wonderful design.

237
0:10:31.72,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And the third level is reflective,

238
0:10:35.72,000 --> 0:10:39,000
which is, if you like the superego,

239
0:10:39.72,000 --> 0:10:42,000
it's a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do,

240
0:10:42.72,000 --> 0:10:46,000
no control over the -- doesn't see the senses,

241
0:10:46.72,000 --> 0:10:48,000
doesn't control the muscles.

242
0:10:48.72,000 --> 0:10:5,000
It looks over what's going on.

243
0:10:50.72,000 --> 0:10:52,000
It's that little voice in your head

244
0:10:52.72,000 --> 0:10:54,000
that's watching and saying, "That's good. That's bad."

245
0:10:54.72,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Or, "Why are you doing that? I don't understand."

246
0:10:56.72,000 --> 0:10:59,000
It's that little voice in your head that's the seat of consciousness.

247
0:11:00.24,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Here's a great reflective product.

248
0:11:03.24,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Owners of the Hummer have said, "You know I've owned many cars in my life --

249
0:11:07.24,000 --> 0:11:09,000
all sorts of exotic cars,

250
0:11:09.24,000 --> 0:11:12,000
but never have I had a car that attracted so much attention."

251
0:11:13.84,000 --> 0:11:18,000
It's about attention. It's about their image,

252
0:11:18.92,000 --> 0:11:2,000
not about the car.

253
0:11:20.92,000 --> 0:11:22,000
If you want a more positive model --

254
0:11:22.92,000 --> 0:11:24,000
this is the GM car.

255
0:11:24.92,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And the reason you might buy it now is because you care about the environment.

256
0:11:26.92,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And you'll buy it to protect the environment,

257
0:11:28.92,000 --> 0:11:31,000
even though the first few cars are going to be really expensive

258
0:11:31.92,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and not perfected.

259
0:11:33.92,000 --> 0:11:35,000
But that's reflective design as well.

260
0:11:35.92,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Or an expensive watch, so you can impress people --

261
0:11:37.92,000 --> 0:11:4,000
"Oh gee, I didn't know you had that watch."

262
0:11:40.92,000 --> 0:11:42,000
As opposed to this one,

263
0:11:42.92,000 --> 0:11:44,000
which is a pure behavioral watch,

264
0:11:44.92,000 --> 0:11:47,000
which probably keeps better time than the $13,000 watch I just showed you.

265
0:11:47.92,000 --> 0:11:49,000
But it's ugly.

266
0:11:49.92,000 --> 0:11:51,000
This is a clear Don Norman watch.

267
0:11:51.92,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And what's neat is sometimes you pit one emotion against the other,

268
0:11:54.92,000 --> 0:11:57,000
the visceral fear of falling

269
0:11:57.92,000 --> 0:12:02,000
against the reflective state saying, "It's OK. It's OK. It's safe. It's safe."

270
0:12:02.92,000 --> 0:12:06,000
If that amusement park were rusty and falling apart, you'd never go on the ride.

271
0:12:06.92,000 --> 0:12:09,000
So, it's pitting one against the other.

272
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:15,000
The other neat thing ...

273
0:12:15,000 --> 0:12:19,000
(Laughter)

274
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:22,000
So Jake Cress is this furniture maker,

275
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and he makes this unbelievable set of furniture.

276
0:12:25,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And this is his chair with claw,

277
0:12:27,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and the poor little chair has lost its ball

278
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and it's trying to get it back before anybody notices.

279
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And what's so neat about it is how you accept that story.

280
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And that's what's nice about emotion.

281
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:43,000
So that's the new me.

282
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:45,000
I'm only saying positive things from now on.

283
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:46,000
(Laughter)

284
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:49,000
(Applause)

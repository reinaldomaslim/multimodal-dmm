1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
As an architect you design for the present,

2
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
with an awareness of the past,

3
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
for a future which is essentially unknown.

4
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
The green agenda is probably the most important agenda

5
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and issue of the day.

6
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And I'd like to share some experience

7
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
over the last 40 years -- we celebrate our fortieth anniversary this year --

8
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and to explore and to touch on some observations

9
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
about the nature of sustainability.

10
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
How far you can anticipate, what follows from it,

11
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
what are the threats, what are the possibilities,

12
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
the challenges, the opportunities?

13
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I think that -- I've said in the past, many, many years ago,

14
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
before anybody even invented the concept of a green agenda,

15
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that it wasn't about fashion -- it was about survival.

16
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
But what I never said, and what I'm really going to make the point is,

17
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that really, green is cool.

18
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I mean, all the projects which have, in some way, been inspired

19
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
by that agenda are about a celebratory lifestyle,

20
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
in a way celebrating the places and the spaces

21
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
which determine the quality of life.

22
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I rarely actually quote anything,

23
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
so I'm going to try and find a piece of paper if I can,

24
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
[in] which somebody, at the end of last year, ventured the thought

25
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
about what for that individual, as a kind of important observer,

26
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
analyst, writer -- a guy called Thomas Friedman,

27
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
who wrote in the Herald Tribune, about 2006.

28
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
He said,

29
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
"I think the most important thing to happen in 2006

30
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
was that living and thinking green hit Main Street.

31
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
We reached a tipping point this year

32
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
where living, acting, designing, investing and manufacturing green

33
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
came to be understood by a critical mass

34
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
of citizens, entrepreneurs and officials

35
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
as the most patriotic, capitalistic, geo-political

36
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and competitive thing they could do.

37
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Hence my motto: green is the new red, white and blue."

38
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And I asked myself, in a way, looking back,

39
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
"When did that kind of awareness of the planet and its fragility first appear?"

40
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And I think it was July 20, 1969,

41
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
when, for the first time, man could look back at planet Earth.

42
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And, in a way, it was Buckminster Fuller who coined that phrase.

43
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And before the kind of collapse of the communist system,

44
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I was privileged to meet a lot of cosmonauts

45
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
in Space City and other places in Russia.

46
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And interestingly, as I think back,

47
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
they were the first true environmentalists.

48
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
They were filled with a kind of pioneering passion,

49
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
fired about the problems of the Aral Sea.

50
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And at that period it was --

51
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
in a way, a number of things were happening.

52
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
Buckminster Fuller was the kind of green guru --

53
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
again, a word that had not been coined.

54
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
He was a design scientist, if you like, a poet,

55
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
but he foresaw all the things that are happening now.

56
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
It's another subject. It's another conversation.

57
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
You can go back to his writings: it's quite extraordinary.

58
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
It was at that time, with an awareness

59
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
fired by Bucky's prophecies, his concerns

60
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
as a citizen, as a kind of citizen of the planet,

61
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
that influenced my thinking and what we were doing at that time.

62
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And it's a number of projects.

63
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I select this one because it was 1973, and it was a master plan

64
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
for one of the Canary Islands.

65
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And this probably coincided with the time

66
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
when you had the planet Earth's sourcebook,

67
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and you had the hippie movement.

68
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And there are some of those qualities in this drawing,

69
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
which seeks to sum up the recommendations.

70
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And all the components are there which are now

71
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
in common parlance, in our vocabulary,

72
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
you know, 30-odd years later:

73
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
wind energy, recycling, biomass, solar cells.

74
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And in parallel at that time, there was

75
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
a very kind of exclusive design club.

76
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
People who were really design conscious

77
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
were inspired by the work of Dieter Rams,

78
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and the objects that he would create

79
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
for the company called Braun.

80
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
This is going back the mid-'50s, '60s.

81
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And despite Bucky's prophecies

82
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that everything would be miniaturized

83
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and technology would make an incredible style --

84
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
access to comfort, to amenities --

85
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
it was very, very difficult to imagine

86
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
that everything that we see in this image,

87
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
would be very, very stylishly packaged.

88
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And that, and more besides, would be in the palm of your hand.

89
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And I think that that digital revolution

90
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
now is coming to the point

91
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
where, as the virtual world, which brings so many people together here,

92
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
finally connects with the physical world,

93
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
there is the reality that that has become humanized,

94
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
so that digital world has all the friendliness,

95
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
all the immediacy, the orientation of the analog world.

96
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Probably summed up in a way

97
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
by the stylish or alternative available here,

98
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
as we generously had gifted at lunchtime,

99
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
the [unclear], which is a further kind of development --

100
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and again, inspired by the incredible sort of sensual feel.

101
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
A very, very beautiful object.

102
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
So, something which in [the] '50s, '60s was very exclusive

103
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
has now become, interestingly, quite inclusive.

104
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And the reference to the iPod as iconic,

105
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and in a way evocative of performance, delivery --

106
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
quite interesting that [in] the beginning of the year 2007,

107
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
the Financial Times commented that the Detroit companies

108
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
envy the halo effect that Toyota has gained

109
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
from the Prius as the hybrid, energy-conscious vehicle,

110
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
which rivals the iPod as an iconic product.

111
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And I think it's very tempting to, in a way, seduce ourselves --

112
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
as architects, or anybody involved with the design process --

113
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that the answer to our problems lies with buildings.

114
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Buildings are important, but

115
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
they're only a component of a much bigger picture.

116
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
In other words, as I might seek to demonstrate,

117
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
if you could achieve the impossible,

118
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
the equivalent of perpetual motion,

119
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
you could design a carbon-free house, for example.

120
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
That would be the answer.

121
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Unfortunately, it's not the answer.

122
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
It's only the beginning of the problem.

123
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
You cannot separate the buildings out

124
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
from the infrastructure of cites

125
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and the mobility of transit.

126
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
For example, if, in that Bucky-inspired phrase, we draw back

127
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and we look at planet Earth,

128
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and we take a kind of typical, industrialized society,

129
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
then the energy consumed would be split

130
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
between the buildings, 44 percent, transport, 34 percent, and industry.

131
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
But again, that only shows part of the picture.

132
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
If you looked at the buildings together with the associated transport,

133
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
in other words, the transport of people, which is 26 percent,

134
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
then 70 percent of the energy consumption

135
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
is influenced by the way that our cites and infrastructure work together.

136
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
So the problems of sustainability

137
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
cannot be separated from the nature of the cities,

138
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
of which the buildings are a part.

139
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
For example, if you take, and you make a comparison

140
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
between a recent kind of city,

141
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
what I'll call, simplistically, a North American city --

142
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and Detroit is not a bad example, it is very car dependent.

143
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
The city goes out in annular rings,

144
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
consuming more and more green space,

145
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and more and more roads, and more and more energy

146
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
in the transport of people between the city center --

147
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
which again, the city center, as it becomes deprived

148
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
of the living and just becomes commercial, again becomes dead.

149
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
If you compared Detroit with a city of a Northern European example --

150
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and Munich is not a bad example of that,

151
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
with the greater dependence on walking and cycling --

152
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
then a city which is really only twice as dense,

153
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
is only using one-tenth of the energy.

154
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
In other words, you take these comparable examples

155
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and the energy leap is enormous.

156
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
So basically, if you wanted to generalize, you can demonstrate

157
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
that as the density increases along the bottom there,

158
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
that the energy consumed reduces dramatically.

159
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Of course you can't separate this out from issues like

160
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
social diversity, mass transit,

161
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
the ability to be able to walk a convenient distance,

162
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
the quality of civic spaces.

163
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
But again, you can see Detroit, in yellow at the top,

164
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
extraordinary consumption, down below Copenhagen.

165
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And Copenhagen, although it's a dense city,

166
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
is not dense compared with the really dense cities.

167
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
In the year 2000, a rather interesting thing happened.

168
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
You had for the first time mega-cities, [of] 5 million or more,

169
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
which were occurring in the developing world.

170
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And now, out of typically 46 cities,

171
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
33 of those mega-cities are in the developing world.

172
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
So you have to ask yourself -- the environmental impact of,

173
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
for example, China or India.

174
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
If you take China, and you just take Beijing,

175
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
you can see on that traffic system,

176
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and the pollution associated with the consumption of energy

177
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
as the cars expand at the price of the bicycles.

178
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
In other words, if you put onto the roads, as is currently happening,

179
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
1,000 new cars every day --

180
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
statistically, it's the biggest booming auto market in the world --

181
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and the half a billion bicycles serving one and a third billion people are reducing.

182
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And that urbanization is extraordinary, accelerated pace.

183
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
So, if we think of the transition in our society

184
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
of the movement from the land to the cities, which took 200 years,

185
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
then that same process is happening in 20 years.

186
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
In other words, it is accelerating by a factor of 10.

187
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And quite interestingly, over something like a 60-year period,

188
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
we're seeing the doubling in life expectancy,

189
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
over that period where the urbanization has trebled.

190
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
If I pull back from that global picture,

191
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and I look at the implication over a similar period of time

192
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
in terms of the technology -- which, as a tool,

193
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
is a tool for designers,

194
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and I cite our own experience as a company,

195
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and I just illustrate that by a small selection of projects --

196
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
then how do you measure that change of technology?

197
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
How does it affect the design of buildings?

198
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And particularly, how can it lead

199
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
to the creation of buildings which consume less energy,

200
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
create less pollution and are more socially responsible?

201
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
That story, in terms of buildings, started in the late '60s, early '70s.

202
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
The one example I take is a corporate headquarters

203
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
for a company called Willis and Faber,

204
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
in a small market town in the northeast of England,

205
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
commuting distance with London.

206
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And here, the first thing you can see

207
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
is that this building, the roof is a very warm kind of

208
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
overcoat blanket, a kind of insulating garden,

209
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
which is also about the celebration of public space.

210
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
In other words, for this community, they have this garden in the sky.

211
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
So the humanistic ideal is very, very strong in all this work,

212
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
encapsulated perhaps by one of my early sketches here,

213
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
where you can see greenery, you can see sunlight,

214
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
you have a connection with nature.

215
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
And nature is part of the generator, the driver for this building.

216
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And symbolically, the colors of the interior are green and yellow.

217
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
It has facilities like swimming pools, it has flextime,

218
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
it has a social heart, a space, you have contact with nature.

219
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Now this was 1973.

220
0:14:42.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
In 2001, this building received an award.

221
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
And the award was about a celebration for a building

222
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
which had been in use over a long period of time.

223
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
And the people who'd created it came back:

224
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
the project managers, the company chairmen then.

225
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And they were saying, you know,

226
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
"The architects, Norman was always going on about

227
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:06,000
designing for the future, and you know,

228
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
it didn't seem to cost us any more.

229
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
So we humored him, we kept him happy."

230
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
The image at the top,

231
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
what it doesn't -- if you look at it in detail,

232
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
really what it is saying is you can wire this building.

233
0:15:20.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
This building was wired for change.

234
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:28,000
So, in 1975, the image there is of typewriters.

235
0:15:28.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
And when the photograph was taken, it's word processors.

236
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
And what they were saying on this occasion was that our competitors

237
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
had to build new buildings for the new technology.

238
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
We were fortunate,

239
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
because in a way our building was future-proofed.

240
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
It anticipated change, even though those changes were not known.

241
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Round about that design period leading up to this building,

242
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
I did a sketch, which we pulled out of the archive recently.

243
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:04,000
And I was saying, and I wrote, "But we don't have the time,

244
0:16:04.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and we really don't have the immediate expertise

245
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:08,000
at a technical level."

246
0:16:08.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
In other words, we didn't have the technology

247
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
to do what would be really interesting on that building.

248
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
And that would be to create a kind of three-dimensional bubble --

249
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
a really interesting overcoat that would naturally ventilate,

250
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
would breathe and would seriously reduce the energy loads.

251
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Notwithstanding the fact that the building, as a green building,

252
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:33,000
is very much a pioneering building.

253
0:16:33.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
And if I fast-forward in time, what is interesting

254
0:16:36.16,000 --> 0:16:41,000
is that the technology is now available and celebratory.

255
0:16:41.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
The library of the Free University, which opened last year,

256
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:49,000
is an example of that.

257
0:16:49.16,000 --> 0:16:53,000
And again, the transition from one of the many thousands

258
0:16:53.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
of sketches and computer images to the reality.

259
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:16:59,000
And a combination of devices here,

260
0:16:59.16,000 --> 0:17:03,000
the kind of heavy mass concrete of these book stacks,

261
0:17:03.16,000 --> 0:17:09,000
and the way in which that is enclosed by this skin,

262
0:17:09.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
which enables the building to be ventilated,

263
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:16,000
to consume dramatically less energy,

264
0:17:16.16,000 --> 0:17:19,000
and where it's really working with the forces of nature.

265
0:17:19.16,000 --> 0:17:25,000
And what is interesting is that this is hugely popular

266
0:17:25.16,000 --> 0:17:27,000
by the people who use it.

267
0:17:27.16,000 --> 0:17:3,000
Again, coming back to that thing about the lifestyle,

268
0:17:30.16,000 --> 0:17:39,000
and in a way, the ecological agenda is very much at one with the spirit.

269
0:17:39.16,000 --> 0:17:42,000
So it's not a kind of sacrifice, quite the reverse.

270
0:17:42.16,000 --> 0:17:45,000
I think it's a great -- it's a celebration.

271
0:17:45.16,000 --> 0:17:49,000
And you can measure the performance,

272
0:17:49.16,000 --> 0:17:52,000
in terms of energy consumption, of that building

273
0:17:52.16,000 --> 0:17:55,000
against a typical library.

274
0:17:55.16,000 --> 0:17:58,000
If I show another aspect of that technology

275
0:17:58.16,000 --> 0:18:02,000
then, in a completely different context --

276
0:18:02.16,000 --> 0:18:07,000
this apartment building in the Alps in Switzerland.

277
0:18:07.16,000 --> 0:18:1,000
Prefabricated from the most traditional of materials,

278
0:18:10.16,000 --> 0:18:15,000
but that material -- because of the technology, the computing ability,

279
0:18:15.16,000 --> 0:18:19,000
the ability to prefabricate, make high-performance components

280
0:18:19.16,000 --> 0:18:23,000
out of timber -- very much at the cutting edge.

281
0:18:23.16,000 --> 0:18:26,000
And just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology,

282
0:18:26.16,000 --> 0:18:34,000
the ability to plot points in the sky

283
0:18:34.16,000 --> 0:18:41,000
and to transmit, to transfer that information

284
0:18:41.16,000 --> 0:18:46,000
now, directly into the factory.

285
0:18:46.16,000 --> 0:18:49,000
So if you cross the border -- just across the border --

286
0:18:49.16,000 --> 0:18:55,000
a small factory in Germany, and here you can see the guy with his computer screen,

287
0:18:55.16,000 --> 0:18:59,000
and those points in space are communicated.

288
0:18:59.16,000 --> 0:19:02,000
And on the left are the cutting machines,

289
0:19:02.16,000 --> 0:19:04,000
which then, in the factory,

290
0:19:04.16,000 --> 0:19:08,000
enable those individual pieces to be fabricated

291
0:19:08.16,000 --> 0:19:11,000
and plus or minus very, very few millimeters,

292
0:19:11.16,000 --> 0:19:14,000
to be slotted together on site.

293
0:19:14.16,000 --> 0:19:2,000
And then interestingly, that building to then be clad

294
0:19:20.16,000 --> 0:19:26,000
in the oldest technology, which is the kind of hand-cut shingles.

295
0:19:26.16,000 --> 0:19:33,000
One quarter of a million of them applied by hand as the final finish.

296
0:19:33.16,000 --> 0:19:37,000
And again, the way in which that works as a building,

297
0:19:37.16,000 --> 0:19:41,000
for those of us who can enjoy the spaces,

298
0:19:41.16,000 --> 0:19:44,000
to live and visit there.

299
0:19:44.16,000 --> 0:19:48,000
If I made the leap into these new technologies,

300
0:19:48.16,000 --> 0:19:51,000
then how did we -- what happened before that?

301
0:19:51.16,000 --> 0:19:57,000
I mean, you know, what was life like before the mobile phone,

302
0:19:57.16,000 --> 0:20:,000
the things that you take for granted?

303
0:20:00.16,000 --> 0:20:02,000
Well, obviously the building still happened.

304
0:20:02.16,000 --> 0:20:1,000
I mean, this is a glimpse of the interior of our Hong Kong bank of 1979,

305
0:20:10.16,000 --> 0:20:15,000
which opened in 1985, with the ability to be able to reflect sunlight

306
0:20:15.16,000 --> 0:20:18,000
deep into the heart of this space here.

307
0:20:18.16,000 --> 0:20:22,000
And in the absence of computers, you have to physically model.

308
0:20:22.16,000 --> 0:20:29,000
So for example, we would put models under an artificial sky.

309
0:20:29.16,000 --> 0:20:31,000
For wind tunnels, we would literally put them

310
0:20:31.16,000 --> 0:20:34,000
in a wind tunnel and blast air,

311
0:20:34.16,000 --> 0:20:38,000
and the many kilometers of cable and so on.

312
0:20:38.16,000 --> 0:20:42,000
And the turning point was probably, in our terms,

313
0:20:42.16,000 --> 0:20:46,000
when we had the first computer.

314
0:20:46.16,000 --> 0:20:5,000
And that was at the time that we sought

315
0:20:50.16,000 --> 0:20:54,000
to redesign, reinvent the airport.

316
0:20:54.16,000 --> 0:20:59,000
This is Terminal Four at Heathrow, typical of any terminal --

317
0:20:59.16,000 --> 0:21:01,000
big, heavy roof, blocking out the sunlight,

318
0:21:01.16,000 --> 0:21:06,000
lots of machinery, big pipes, whirring machinery.

319
0:21:06.16,000 --> 0:21:11,000
And Stansted, the green alternative,

320
0:21:11.16,000 --> 0:21:13,000
which uses natural light, is a friendly place:

321
0:21:13.16,000 --> 0:21:17,000
you know where you are, you can relate to the outside.

322
0:21:17.16,000 --> 0:21:21,000
And for a large part of its cycle, not needing electric light --

323
0:21:21.16,000 --> 0:21:24,000
electric light, which in turn creates more heat,

324
0:21:24.16,000 --> 0:21:26,000
which creates more cooling loads and so on.

325
0:21:26.16,000 --> 0:21:29,000
And at that particular point in time,

326
0:21:29.16,000 --> 0:21:33,000
this was one of the few solitary computers.

327
0:21:33.16,000 --> 0:21:39,000
And that's a little image of the tree of Stansted.

328
0:21:39.16,000 --> 0:21:42,000
Not going back very far in time, 1990,

329
0:21:42.16,000 --> 0:21:45,000
that's our office.

330
0:21:45.16,000 --> 0:21:48,000
And if you looked very closely, you'd see

331
0:21:48.16,000 --> 0:21:5,000
that people were drawing with pencils,

332
0:21:50.16,000 --> 0:21:54,000
and they were pushing, you know, big rulers and triangles.

333
0:21:54.16,000 --> 0:21:58,000
It's not that long ago, 17 years, and here we are now.

334
0:21:58.16,000 --> 0:22:,000
I mean, major transformation.

335
0:22:01.16,000 --> 0:22:05,000
Going back in time, there was a lady called Valerie Larkin,

336
0:22:05.16,000 --> 0:22:12,000
and in 1987, she had all our information on one disk.

337
0:22:12.16,000 --> 0:22:21,000
Now, every week, we have the equivalent of 84 million disks,

338
0:22:21.16,000 --> 0:22:24,000
which record our archival information

339
0:22:24.16,000 --> 0:22:27,000
on past, current and future projects.

340
0:22:27.16,000 --> 0:22:31,000
That reaches 21 kilometers into the sky.

341
0:22:31.16,000 --> 0:22:34,000
This is the view you would get, if you looked down on that.

342
0:22:34.16,000 --> 0:22:36,000
But meanwhile, as you know,

343
0:22:36.16,000 --> 0:22:4,000
wonderful protagonists like Al Gore

344
0:22:40.16,000 --> 0:22:46,000
are noting the inexorable rise in temperature,

345
0:22:46.16,000 --> 0:22:49,000
set in the context of that,

346
0:22:49.16,000 --> 0:22:51,000
interestingly, those buildings which are celebratory

347
0:22:51.16,000 --> 0:22:55,000
and very, very relevant to this place.

348
0:22:55.16,000 --> 0:22:57,000
Our Reichstag project,

349
0:22:58.16,000 --> 0:23:02,000
which has a very familiar agenda, I'm sure,

350
0:23:02.16,000 --> 0:23:08,000
as a public place where we sought to, in a way,

351
0:23:08.16,000 --> 0:23:11,000
through a process of advocacy,

352
0:23:11.16,000 --> 0:23:16,000
reinterpret the relationship between society and politicians,

353
0:23:16.16,000 --> 0:23:21,000
public space. And maybe its hidden agenda, an energy manifesto --

354
0:23:21.16,000 --> 0:23:24,000
something that would be free, completely free

355
0:23:24.16,000 --> 0:23:27,000
of fuel as we know it.

356
0:23:27.16,000 --> 0:23:29,000
So it would be totally renewable.

357
0:23:29.16,000 --> 0:23:34,000
And again, the humanistic sketch, the translation into the public space,

358
0:23:34.16,000 --> 0:23:37,000
but this very, very much a part of the ecology.

359
0:23:37.16,000 --> 0:23:41,000
But here, not having to model it for real.

360
0:23:41.16,000 --> 0:23:44,000
Obviously the wind tunnel had a place,

361
0:23:44.16,000 --> 0:23:46,000
but the ability now with the computer

362
0:23:46.16,000 --> 0:23:5,000
to explore, to plan, to see how that would work

363
0:23:50.16,000 --> 0:23:52,000
in terms of the forces of nature:

364
0:23:52.16,000 --> 0:23:56,000
natural ventilation, to be able to model the chamber below,

365
0:23:56.16,000 --> 0:23:59,000
and to look at biomass.

366
0:23:59.16,000 --> 0:24:06,000
A combination of biomass, aquifers, burning vegetable oil --

367
0:24:06.16,000 --> 0:24:1,000
a process that, quite interestingly, was developed

368
0:24:10.16,000 --> 0:24:14,000
in Eastern Germany, at the time of its

369
0:24:14.16,000 --> 0:24:16,000
dependence on the Soviet Bloc.

370
0:24:16.16,000 --> 0:24:2,000
So really, retranslating that technology and developing something

371
0:24:20.16,000 --> 0:24:24,000
which was so clean, it was virtually pollution-free.

372
0:24:24.16,000 --> 0:24:25,000
You can measure it again.

373
0:24:25.16,000 --> 0:24:29,000
You can compare how that building, in terms of its emission

374
0:24:29.16,000 --> 0:24:31,000
in tons of carbon dioxide per year --

375
0:24:31.16,000 --> 0:24:35,000
at the time that we took that project, over 7,000 tons --

376
0:24:35.16,000 --> 0:24:36,000
what it would have been with natural gas

377
0:24:36.16,000 --> 0:24:39,000
and finally, with the vegetable oil, 450 tons.

378
0:24:39.16,000 --> 0:24:42,000
I mean, a 94 percent reduction -- virtually clean.

379
0:24:42.16,000 --> 0:24:44,000
We can see the same processes at work

380
0:24:44.16,000 --> 0:24:46,000
in terms of the Commerce Bank --

381
0:24:46.16,000 --> 0:24:48,000
its dependence on natural ventilation,

382
0:24:48.16,000 --> 0:24:5,000
the way that you can model those gardens,

383
0:24:50.16,000 --> 0:24:52,000
the way they spiral around.

384
0:24:52.16,000 --> 0:24:56,000
But again, very much about the lifestyle, the quality --

385
0:24:56.16,000 --> 0:25:,000
something that would be more enjoyable as a place to work.

386
0:25:00.16,000 --> 0:25:02,000
And again, we can measure the reduction

387
0:25:02.16,000 --> 0:25:06,000
in terms of energy consumption.

388
0:25:06.16,000 --> 0:25:08,000
There is an evolution here between the projects,

389
0:25:08.16,000 --> 0:25:13,000
and Swiss Re again develops that a little bit further --

390
0:25:13.16,000 --> 0:25:15,000
the project in the city in London.

391
0:25:15.16,000 --> 0:25:19,000
And this sequence shows the buildup of that model.

392
0:25:19.16,000 --> 0:25:22,000
But what it shows first, which I think is quite interesting,

393
0:25:22.16,000 --> 0:25:27,000
is that here you see the circle, you see the public space around it.

394
0:25:27.16,000 --> 0:25:29,000
What are the other ways of putting

395
0:25:29.16,000 --> 0:25:32,000
the same amount of space on the site?

396
0:25:32.16,000 --> 0:25:36,000
If, for example, you seek to do a building

397
0:25:36.16,000 --> 0:25:41,000
which goes right to the edge of the pavement,

398
0:25:41.16,000 --> 0:25:44,000
it's the same amount of space.

399
0:25:44.16,000 --> 0:25:49,000
And finally, you profile this, you cut grooves into it.

400
0:25:49.16,000 --> 0:25:52,000
The grooves become the kind of green lungs

401
0:25:52.16,000 --> 0:25:56,000
which give views, which give light, ventilation,

402
0:25:56.16,000 --> 0:25:58,000
make the building fresher.

403
0:25:58.16,000 --> 0:26:01,000
And you enclose that with something that also

404
0:26:01.16,000 --> 0:26:04,000
is central to its appearance,

405
0:26:04.16,000 --> 0:26:08,000
which is a mesh of triangulated structures --

406
0:26:08.16,000 --> 0:26:11,000
again, in a long connection evocative of

407
0:26:11.16,000 --> 0:26:14,000
some of those works of Buckminster Fuller,

408
0:26:14.16,000 --> 0:26:18,000
and the way in which triangulation can increase performance

409
0:26:18.16,000 --> 0:26:23,000
and also give that building its sense of identity.

410
0:26:23.16,000 --> 0:26:26,000
And here, if we look at a detail of the way

411
0:26:26.16,000 --> 0:26:29,000
that the building opens up and breathes into those atria,

412
0:26:29.16,000 --> 0:26:34,000
the way in which now, with a computer, we can model the forces,

413
0:26:34.16,000 --> 0:26:37,000
we can see the high pressure, the low pressure,

414
0:26:37.16,000 --> 0:26:41,000
the way in which the building behaves rather like an aircraft wing.

415
0:26:41.16,000 --> 0:26:44,000
So it also has the ability, all the time,

416
0:26:44.16,000 --> 0:26:46,000
regardless of the direction of the wind,

417
0:26:46.16,000 --> 0:26:51,000
to be able to make the building fresh and efficient.

418
0:26:51.16,000 --> 0:26:54,000
And unlike conventional buildings,

419
0:26:54.16,000 --> 0:26:56,000
the top of the building is celebratory.

420
0:26:56.16,000 --> 0:26:59,000
It's a viewing place for people, not machinery.

421
0:26:59.16,000 --> 0:27:03,000
And the base of the building is again about public space.

422
0:27:03.16,000 --> 0:27:05,000
Comparing it with a typical building,

423
0:27:05.16,000 --> 0:27:1,000
what happens if we seek to use such design strategies

424
0:27:10.16,000 --> 0:27:14,000
in terms of really large-scale thinking?

425
0:27:14.16,000 --> 0:27:16,000
And I'm just going to give two images

426
0:27:16.16,000 --> 0:27:22,000
out of a kind of company research project.

427
0:27:22.16,000 --> 0:27:28,000
It's been well known that the Dead Sea is dying.

428
0:27:28.16,000 --> 0:27:32,000
The level is dropping, rather like the Aral Sea.

429
0:27:32.16,000 --> 0:27:36,000
And the Dead Sea is obviously much lower

430
0:27:36.16,000 --> 0:27:4,000
than the oceans and seas around it.

431
0:27:40.16,000 --> 0:27:44,000
So there has been a project which rescues the Dead Sea

432
0:27:44.16,000 --> 0:27:48,000
by creating a pipeline, a pipe,

433
0:27:48.16,000 --> 0:27:51,000
sometimes above the surface, sometimes buried,

434
0:27:51.16,000 --> 0:27:57,000
that will redress that, and will feed from the Gulf of Aqaba

435
0:27:57.16,000 --> 0:27:59,000
into the Dead Sea.

436
0:27:59.16,000 --> 0:28:,000
And our translation of that,

437
0:28:00.16,000 --> 0:28:05,000
using a lot of the thinking built up over the 40 years, is to say,

438
0:28:05.16,000 --> 0:28:08,000
what if that, instead of being just a pipe,

439
0:28:08.16,000 --> 0:28:1,000
what if it is a lifeline?

440
0:28:10.16,000 --> 0:28:14,000
What if it is the equivalent, depending on where you are,

441
0:28:14.16,000 --> 0:28:16,000
of the Grand Canal,

442
0:28:16.16,000 --> 0:28:21,000
in terms of tourists, habitation, desalination, agriculture?

443
0:28:21.16,000 --> 0:28:23,000
In other words, water is the lifeblood.

444
0:28:23.16,000 --> 0:28:26,000
And if you just go back to the previous image,

445
0:28:26.16,000 --> 0:28:3,000
and you look at this area of volatility and hostility,

446
0:28:30.16,000 --> 0:28:36,000
that a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture

447
0:28:36.16,000 --> 0:28:4,000
could have the affect of bringing all those warring factions together

448
0:28:40.16,000 --> 0:28:44,000
in a united cause, in terms of something that would be

449
0:28:44.16,000 --> 0:28:5,000
genuinely green and productive in the widest sense.

450
0:28:50.16,000 --> 0:28:52,000
Infrastructure at that large scale is also

451
0:28:52.16,000 --> 0:28:57,000
inseparable from communication.

452
0:28:57.16,000 --> 0:29:,000
And whether that communication is the virtual world

453
0:29:00.16,000 --> 0:29:01,000
or it is the physical world,

454
0:29:01.16,000 --> 0:29:04,000
then it's absolutely central to society.

455
0:29:04.16,000 --> 0:29:09,000
And how do we make more legible in this growing world,

456
0:29:09.16,000 --> 0:29:13,000
especially in some of the places that I'm talking about --

457
0:29:13.16,000 --> 0:29:15,000
China, for example, which in the next ten years

458
0:29:15.16,000 --> 0:29:19,000
will create 400 new airports.

459
0:29:19.16,000 --> 0:29:21,000
Now what form do they take?

460
0:29:21.16,000 --> 0:29:24,000
How do you make them more friendly at that scale?

461
0:29:24.16,000 --> 0:29:31,000
Hong Kong I refer to as a kind of analog experience in a digital age,

462
0:29:31.16,000 --> 0:29:33,000
because you always have a point of reference.

463
0:29:33.16,000 --> 0:29:39,000
So what happens when we take that and you expand that further

464
0:29:39.16,000 --> 0:29:43,000
into the Chinese society?

465
0:29:43.16,000 --> 0:29:47,000
And what is interesting is that that produces in a way

466
0:29:47.16,000 --> 0:29:49,000
perhaps the ultimate mega-building.

467
0:29:49.16,000 --> 0:29:53,000
It is physically the largest project on the planet at the moment.

468
0:29:53.16,000 --> 0:29:59,000
250 -- excuse me, 50,000 people working 24 hours, seven days.

469
0:29:59.16,000 --> 0:30:03,000
Larger by 17 percent than every terminal put together

470
0:30:03.16,000 --> 0:30:08,000
at Heathrow -- built -- plus the new, un-built Terminal Five.

471
0:30:08.16,000 --> 0:30:12,000
And the challenge here is a building that will be green,

472
0:30:12.16,000 --> 0:30:15,000
that is compact despite its size

473
0:30:15.16,000 --> 0:30:2,000
and is about the human experience of travel,

474
0:30:20.16,000 --> 0:30:25,000
is about friendly, is coming back to that starting point,

475
0:30:25.16,000 --> 0:30:27,000
is very, very much about the lifestyle.

476
0:30:27.16,000 --> 0:30:33,000
And perhaps these, in the end, as celebratory spaces.

477
0:30:33.16,000 --> 0:30:35,000
As Hubert was talking over lunch,

478
0:30:35.16,000 --> 0:30:37,000
as we sort of engaged in conversation,

479
0:30:37.16,000 --> 0:30:39,000
talked about this, talked about cities.

480
0:30:39.16,000 --> 0:30:44,000
Hubert was saying, absolutely correctly, "These are the new cathedrals."

481
0:30:44.16,000 --> 0:30:48,000
And in a way, one aspect of this conversation

482
0:30:48.16,000 --> 0:30:52,000
was triggered on New Year's Eve,

483
0:30:52.16,000 --> 0:31:,000
when I was talking about the Olympic agenda in China

484
0:31:00.16,000 --> 0:31:05,000
in terms of its green ambitions and aspirations.

485
0:31:05.16,000 --> 0:31:07,000
And I was voicing the thought that --

486
0:31:07.16,000 --> 0:31:09,000
it just crossed my mind that New Year's Eve,

487
0:31:09.16,000 --> 0:31:15,000
a sort of symbolic turning point as we move from 2006 to 2007 --

488
0:31:15.16,000 --> 0:31:17,000
that maybe, you know, the future was

489
0:31:17.16,000 --> 0:31:21,000
the most powerful, innovative sort of nation.

490
0:31:21.16,000 --> 0:31:24,000
The way in which somebody like Kennedy inspirationally could say,

491
0:31:24.16,000 --> 0:31:25,000
"We put a man on the moon."

492
0:31:25.16,000 --> 0:31:27,000
You know, who is going to say

493
0:31:27.16,000 --> 0:31:32,000
that we cracked this thing of the dependence on fossil fuels,

494
0:31:32.16,000 --> 0:31:36,000
with all that being held to ransom by rogue regimes, and so on.

495
0:31:36.16,000 --> 0:31:38,000
And that's a concerted platform.

496
0:31:38.16,000 --> 0:31:41,000
It's more than one device, you know, it's renewable.

497
0:31:41.16,000 --> 0:31:45,000
And I voiced the thought that maybe at the turn of the year,

498
0:31:45.16,000 --> 0:31:47,000
I thought that the inspiration was more likely

499
0:31:47.16,000 --> 0:31:49,000
to come from those other, larger countries out there --

500
0:31:49.16,000 --> 0:31:53,000
the Chinas, the Indias, the Asian-Pacific tigers.

501
0:31:53.16,000 --> 0:31:55,000
Thank you very much.

502
0:31:55.16,000 --> 0:31:56,000
(Applause)

It is such a sort of instrumental part

3
0:00:14.74,000 --> 0:00:17,000
of our cooking vocabulary, in terms of the utensils.

4
0:00:17.793,000 --> 0:00:18,000
And it was like, that's interesting,

5
0:00:19.63,000 --> 0:00:21,000
there are people who live without chopsticks.

8
0:00:26.917,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Chopsticks are a pair of two long sticks

9
0:00:29.417,000 --> 0:00:31,000
used to eat things with one hand.

10
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Holding chopsticks is a little bit like holding a pencil,

11
0:00:34.958,000 --> 0:00:35,000
except that you have two of them

12
0:00:36.542,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and you move them together in a pincer movement.

13
0:00:38.833,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Most of them are made out of wood. They're also made out of plastic, bamboo,

14
0:00:42.458,000 --> 0:00:44,000
jade, gold, silver and even ivory,

15
0:00:44.583,000 --> 0:00:46,000
though I think that's not so cool anymore.

16
0:00:46.792,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Chopsticks are really well designed for eating small bits of food.

17
0:00:50.167,000 --> 0:00:51,000
They're good for picking up noodles.

18
0:00:51.958,000 --> 0:00:52,000
If you're skilled, you can eat rice,

19
0:00:53.792,000 --> 0:00:54,000
pick up dumplings, pieces of meat.

20
0:00:55.75,000 --> 0:00:57,000
There are some no-nos with chopsticks.

21
0:00:57.875,000 --> 0:00:59,000
You should not use the chopsticks like drumsticks,

22
0:01:00.25,000 --> 0:01:01,000
which I know is tempting.

23
0:01:01.542,000 --> 0:01:04,000
You don't want to stick chopsticks into a bowl of rice face-up.

24
0:01:04.958,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And the reason for that is it actually looks like a bowl of incense,

25
0:01:08.208,000 --> 0:01:09,000
so it sort of echoes death.

26
0:01:09.583,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Chopsticks are used in a huge portion of the world,

27
0:01:12.042,000 --> 0:01:14,000
across much of Asia, about 1.5 billion people

28
0:01:14.667,000 --> 0:01:15,000
are covered in the chopsticks sphere.

29
0:01:16.667,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Different cultures have slightly different variations of chopsticks.

30
0:01:20.167,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Chinese chopsticks will tend to be long and round,

31
0:01:22.875,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Korean chopsticks are flatter and often made of metal

32
0:01:25.875,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and Japanese chopsticks tend to be round

33
0:01:28.042,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and very, very pointy.

34
0:01:29.542,000 --> 0:01:31,000
While chopsticks are actually really commonplace

35
0:01:31.875,000 --> 0:01:32,000
in American society today,

36
0:01:33.792,000 --> 0:01:35,000
there was definitely a time in the late 1800s

37
0:01:36.458,000 --> 0:01:38,000
where this idea that Asian men,

38
0:01:38.708,000 --> 0:01:4,000
because they ate rice with sticks,

39
0:01:40.75,000 --> 0:01:42,000
were of a different quality than American men,

40
0:01:43.583,000 --> 0:01:45,000
who ate proper meat with a knife and fork.

41
0:01:45.667,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But when China and the United States

42
0:01:47.833,000 --> 0:01:5,000
began their diplomatic engagement in the 1970s,

43
0:01:51.333,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger,

44
0:01:52.917,000 --> 0:01:54,000
had to practice eating with chopsticks.

45
0:01:55.917,000 --> 0:01:56,000
What's been really interesting to see

46
0:01:57.875,000 --> 0:02:02,000
is that as Asian cuisine has moved from the East into the West,

47
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:05,000
chopsticks have become part of the experience.

48
0:02:05.75,000 --> 0:02:08,000
There's evidence of chopsticks as long ago as the Shang dynasty,

49
0:02:09.125,000 --> 0:02:1,000
which is about 3000 years ago,

50
0:02:10.75,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and they loved tripods during the Shang dynasty.

51
0:02:13.583,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So when you cook with these big tripods,

52
0:02:15.833,000 --> 0:02:17,000
chopsticks were actually really useful,

53
0:02:17.875,000 --> 0:02:19,000
because it was a way for you to stir and to reach

54
0:02:20.25,000 --> 0:02:22,000
without getting burned as the water was boiling

55
0:02:23.25,000 --> 0:02:24,000
in these really big pots.

56
0:02:25.25,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Chinese culture has knives and has forks.

57
0:02:27.375,000 --> 0:02:29,000
It uses them in many cases for cooking.

58
0:02:30.167,000 --> 0:02:34,000
But in terms of like what moved into the dining room,

59
0:02:34.208,000 --> 0:02:35,000
it was the chopsticks.

60
0:02:35.5,000 --> 0:02:36,000
One of the things about Asian cooking

61
0:02:37.333,000 --> 0:02:39,000
is that it often comes in very small pieces.

62
0:02:39.625,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And I think part of that has to do with the fact

63
0:02:41.958,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that it's actually a lot more energy-efficient

64
0:02:44.125,000 --> 0:02:45,000
to cook little pieces quickly.

65
0:02:46.125,000 --> 0:02:48,000
But also, then you don't have to cut them.

66
0:02:48.208,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So you have a circular influence,

67
0:02:49.917,000 --> 0:02:52,000
where the type of food that is cooked allows people to use chopsticks,

68
0:02:53.292,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and then the fact that you have chopsticks influences the food that you can cook.

69
0:02:57.208,000 --> 0:03:,000
But at the same time, chopsticks reflect the communal nature of eating food.

70
0:03:00.833,000 --> 0:03:02,000
You'll have these dishes that you put in the middle,

71
0:03:03.333,000 --> 0:03:04,000
it's very family style.

72
0:03:04.625,000 --> 0:03:05,000
You go in with your chopsticks,

73
0:03:06.167,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and you put it on your rice, and then you eat individually.

74
0:03:09.292,000 --> 0:03:11,000
There's actually a famous sort of legend

75
0:03:11.5,000 --> 0:03:13,000
where everyone has these really, really long chopsticks,

76
0:03:14.167,000 --> 0:03:16,000
like way too long for them to feed themselves.

77
0:03:16.375,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And so in hell, everyone starves,

78
0:03:18.583,000 --> 0:03:2,000
because they can't pick up food and put it in their mouths.

79
0:03:21.5,000 --> 0:03:23,000
But in heaven, people take the same chopsticks

80
0:03:23.792,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and then feed each other.

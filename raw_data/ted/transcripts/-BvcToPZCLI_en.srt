Reviewer: Camille Martínez

2
0:00:12.746,000 --> 0:00:15,000
It was my first year as an atmospheric science professor

3
0:00:16.524,000 --> 0:00:17,000
at Texas Tech University.

4
0:00:18.769,000 --> 0:00:19,000
We had just moved to Lubbock, Texas,

5
0:00:20.54,000 --> 0:00:23,000
which had recently been named the second most conservative city

6
0:00:24.066,000 --> 0:00:25,000
in the entire United States.

7
0:00:26.902,000 --> 0:00:29,000
A colleague asked me to guest teach his undergraduate geology class.

8
0:00:30.624,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I said, "Sure."

9
0:00:32.339,000 --> 0:00:35,000
But when I showed up, the lecture hall was cavernous and dark.

10
0:00:36.321,000 --> 0:00:38,000
As I tracked the history of the carbon cycle

11
0:00:38.538,000 --> 0:00:4,000
through geologic time to present day,

12
0:00:41.188,000 --> 0:00:45,000
most of the students were slumped over, dozing or looking at their phones.

13
0:00:46.124,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I ended my talk with a hopeful request for any questions.

14
0:00:49.879,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And one hand shot up right away.

15
0:00:53.37,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I looked encouraging, he stood up, and in a loud voice, he said,

16
0:00:57.92,000 --> 0:00:58,000
"You're a democrat, aren't you?"

17
0:00:59.761,000 --> 0:01:01,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:02.443,000 --> 0:01:03,000
"No," I said, "I'm Canadian."

19
0:01:04.402,000 --> 0:01:06,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:06.821,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Applause)

21
0:01:13.176,000 --> 0:01:14,000
That was my baptism by fire

22
0:01:15.01,000 --> 0:01:19,000
into what has now become a sad fact of life here in the United States

23
0:01:19.109,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and increasingly across Canada as well.

24
0:01:22.196,000 --> 0:01:24,000
The fact that the number one predictor

25
0:01:24.252,000 --> 0:01:26,000
of whether we agree that climate is changing,

26
0:01:27.069,000 --> 0:01:28,000
humans are responsible

27
0:01:28.807,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and the impacts are increasingly serious and even dangerous,

28
0:01:32.466,000 --> 0:01:36,000
has nothing to do with how much we know about science or even how smart we are

29
0:01:36.734,000 --> 0:01:39,000
but simply where we fall on the political spectrum.

30
0:01:41.585,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Does the thermometer give us a different answer

31
0:01:43.808,000 --> 0:01:45,000
depending on if we're liberal or conservative?

32
0:01:46.111,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Of course not.

33
0:01:48.762,000 --> 0:01:52,000
But if that thermometer tells us that the planet is warming,

34
0:01:52.928,000 --> 0:01:54,000
that humans are responsible

35
0:01:55.143,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and that to fix this thing,

36
0:01:56.515,000 --> 0:02:,000
we have to wean ourselves off fossil fuels as soon as possible --

37
0:02:01.53,000 --> 0:02:03,000
well, some people would rather cut off their arm

38
0:02:04.161,000 --> 0:02:06,000
than give the government any further excuse

39
0:02:06.53,000 --> 0:02:09,000
to disrupt their comfortable lives and tell them what to do.

40
0:02:10.736,000 --> 0:02:13,000
But saying, "Yes, it's a real problem, but I don't want to fix it,"

41
0:02:14.633,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that makes us the bad guy, and nobody wants to be the bad guy.

42
0:02:18.673,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So instead, we use arguments like, "It's just a natural cycle."

43
0:02:23.458,000 --> 0:02:24,000
"It's the sun."

44
0:02:24.792,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Or my favorite,

45
0:02:25.967,000 --> 0:02:27,000
"Those climate scientists are just in it for the money."

46
0:02:28.617,000 --> 0:02:29,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:30.569,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I get that at least once a week.

48
0:02:34.489,000 --> 0:02:37,000
But these are just sciencey-sounding smoke screens,

49
0:02:38.362,000 --> 0:02:4,000
that are designed to hide the real reason for our objections,

50
0:02:41.291,000 --> 0:02:43,000
which have nothing to do with the science

51
0:02:43.601,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and everything to do with our ideology and our identity.

52
0:02:49.131,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So when we turn on the TV these days,

53
0:02:51.03,000 --> 0:02:53,000
it seems like pundit X is saying,

54
0:02:53.673,000 --> 0:02:55,000
"It's cold outside. Where is global warming now?"

55
0:02:56.307,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And politician Y is saying,

56
0:02:58.074,000 --> 0:03:,000
"For every scientist who says this thing is real,

57
0:03:00.419,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I can find one who says it isn't."

58
0:03:02.68,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So it's no surprise that sometimes we feel like everybody is saying these myths.

59
0:03:07.935,000 --> 0:03:08,000
But when we look at the data --

60
0:03:09.828,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and the Yale Program on Climate [Change] Communication

61
0:03:12.419,000 --> 0:03:15,000
has done public opinion polling across the country now for a number of years --

62
0:03:16.181,000 --> 0:03:2,000
the data shows that actually 70 percent of people in the United States agree

63
0:03:20.334,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that the climate is changing.

64
0:03:22.104,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And 70 percent also agree that it will harm plants and animals,

65
0:03:25.58,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and it will harm future generations.

66
0:03:28.942,000 --> 0:03:32,000
But then when we dig down a bit deeper, the rubber starts to hit the road.

67
0:03:33.887,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Only about 60 percent of people think it will affect people in the United States.

68
0:03:39.101,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Only 40 percent of people think it will affect us personally.

69
0:03:44.674,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And then when you ask people, "Do you ever talk about this?"

70
0:03:48.665,000 --> 0:03:52,000
two-thirds of people in the entire United States say, "Never."

71
0:03:54.878,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And even worse, when you say, "Do you hear the media talk about this?"

72
0:03:58.419,000 --> 0:04:,000
Over three-quarters of people say no.

73
0:04:02.633,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So it's a vicious cycle.

74
0:04:05.86,000 --> 0:04:06,000
The planet warms.

75
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Heat waves get stronger.

76
0:04:08.815,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Heavy precipitation gets more frequent.

77
0:04:10.974,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Hurricanes get more intense.

78
0:04:12.895,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Scientists release yet another doom-filled report.

79
0:04:16.734,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Politicians push back even more strongly,

80
0:04:19.632,000 --> 0:04:21,000
repeating the same sciencey-sounding myths.

81
0:04:23.885,000 --> 0:04:25,000
What can we do to break this vicious cycle?

82
0:04:27.085,000 --> 0:04:31,000
The number one thing we can do is the exact thing that we're not doing:

83
0:04:32.307,000 --> 0:04:33,000
talk about it.

84
0:04:34.851,000 --> 0:04:35,000
But you might say, "I'm not a scientist.

85
0:04:36.803,000 --> 0:04:38,000
How am I supposed to talk about radiative forcing

86
0:04:39.192,000 --> 0:04:41,000
or cloud parametrization in climate models?"

87
0:04:42.779,000 --> 0:04:44,000
We don't need to be talking about more science;

88
0:04:45.014,000 --> 0:04:48,000
we've been talking about the science for over 150 years.

89
0:04:48.585,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Did you know that it's been 150 years or more since the 1850s,

90
0:04:54.149,000 --> 0:04:56,000
when climate scientists first discovered

91
0:04:56.285,000 --> 0:04:59,000
that digging up and burning coal and gas and oil

92
0:04:59.872,000 --> 0:05:,000
is producing heat-trapping gases

93
0:05:01.572,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that is wrapping an extra blanket around the planet?

94
0:05:04.291,000 --> 0:05:05,000
That's how long we've known.

95
0:05:05.916,000 --> 0:05:09,000
It's been 50 years since scientists first formally warned a US president

96
0:05:10.117,000 --> 0:05:11,000
of the dangers of a changing climate,

97
0:05:11.981,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and that president was Lyndon B. Johnson.

98
0:05:15.442,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And what's more, the social science has taught us

99
0:05:18.879,000 --> 0:05:22,000
that if people have built their identity on rejecting a certain set of facts,

100
0:05:24.642,000 --> 0:05:29,000
then arguing over those facts is a personal attack.

101
0:05:29.823,000 --> 0:05:31,000
It causes them to dig in deeper,

102
0:05:31.95,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and it digs a trench, rather than building a bridge.

103
0:05:36.083,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So if we aren't supposed to talk about more science,

104
0:05:38.649,000 --> 0:05:4,000
or if we don't need to talk about more science,

105
0:05:41.069,000 --> 0:05:43,000
then what should we be talking about?

106
0:05:43.299,000 --> 0:05:44,000
The most important thing to do is,

107
0:05:44.975,000 --> 0:05:47,000
instead of starting up with your head, with all the data and facts in our head,

108
0:05:48.763,000 --> 0:05:49,000
to start from the heart,

109
0:05:50.633,000 --> 0:05:53,000
to start by talking about why it matters to us,

110
0:05:55.708,000 --> 0:05:58,000
to begin with genuinely shared values.

111
0:05:59.335,000 --> 0:06:,000
Are we both parents?

112
0:06:01.296,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Do we live in the same community?

113
0:06:03.628,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Do we enjoy the same outdoor activities: hiking, biking, fishing, even hunting?

114
0:06:10.215,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Do we care about the economy or national security?

115
0:06:13.66,000 --> 0:06:16,000
For me, one of the most foundational ways I found to connect with people

116
0:06:17.11,000 --> 0:06:18,000
is through my faith.

117
0:06:18.705,000 --> 0:06:22,000
As a Christian, I believe that God created this incredible planet that we live on

118
0:06:22.88,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and gave us responsibility over every living thing on it.

119
0:06:27.181,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And I furthermore believe that we are to care for and love

120
0:06:30.002,000 --> 0:06:31,000
the least fortunate among us,

121
0:06:31.801,000 --> 0:06:33,000
those who are already suffering the impacts of poverty,

122
0:06:34.543,000 --> 0:06:35,000
hunger, disease and more.

123
0:06:37.313,000 --> 0:06:4,000
If you don't know what the values are that someone has,

124
0:06:40.966,000 --> 0:06:43,000
have a conversation, get to know them, figure out what makes them tick.

125
0:06:45.427,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And then once we have,

126
0:06:47.458,000 --> 0:06:52,000
all we have to do is connect the dots between the values they already have

127
0:06:52.831,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and why they would care about a changing climate.

128
0:06:55.815,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I truly believe, after thousands of conversations that I've had

129
0:06:59.353,000 --> 0:07:,000
over the past decade and more,

130
0:07:01.369,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that just about every single person in the world

131
0:07:03.657,000 --> 0:07:06,000
already has the values they need to care about a changing climate.

132
0:07:06.807,000 --> 0:07:08,000
They just haven't connected the dots.

133
0:07:09.211,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And that's what we can do through our conversation with them.

134
0:07:13.791,000 --> 0:07:15,000
The only reason why I care about a changing climate

135
0:07:16.29,000 --> 0:07:17,000
is because of who I already am.

136
0:07:18.614,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I'm a mother, so I care about the future of my child.

137
0:07:21.614,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I live in West Texas, where water is already scarce,

138
0:07:24.796,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and climate change is impacting the availability of that water.

139
0:07:28.903,000 --> 0:07:3,000
I'm a Christian, I care about a changing climate

140
0:07:31.229,000 --> 0:07:34,000
because it is, as the military calls it, a "threat multiplier."

141
0:07:35.109,000 --> 0:07:36,000
It takes those issues,

142
0:07:36.927,000 --> 0:07:39,000
like poverty and hunger and disease and lack of access to clean water

143
0:07:40.561,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and even political crises that lead to refugee crises --

144
0:07:44.061,000 --> 0:07:46,000
it takes all of these issues and it exacerbates them,

145
0:07:46.602,000 --> 0:07:47,000
it makes them worse.

146
0:07:49.046,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I'm not a Rotarian.

147
0:07:50.784,000 --> 0:07:52,000
But when I gave my first talk at a Rotary Club,

148
0:07:53.006,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I walked in and they had this giant banner that had the Four-Way Test on it.

149
0:07:58.8,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Is it the truth?

150
0:08:00.141,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Absolutely.

151
0:08:01.611,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Is it fair?

152
0:08:02.793,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Heck, no, that's why I care most about climate change,

153
0:08:05.452,000 --> 0:08:06,000
because it is absolutely unfair.

154
0:08:07.039,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Those who have contributed the least to the problem

155
0:08:09.452,000 --> 0:08:1,000
are bearing the brunt of the impacts.

156
0:08:11.262,000 --> 0:08:12,000
It went on to ask:

157
0:08:12.482,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Would it be beneficial to all, would it build goodwill?

158
0:08:15.228,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Well, to fix it certainly would.

159
0:08:16.847,000 --> 0:08:2,000
So I took my talk, and I reorganized it into the Four-Way Test,

160
0:08:21.744,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and then I gave it to this group of conservative businesspeople

161
0:08:24.863,000 --> 0:08:25,000
in West Texas.

162
0:08:26.037,000 --> 0:08:27,000
(Laughter)

163
0:08:27.141,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And I will never forget at the end,

164
0:08:29.053,000 --> 0:08:33,000
a local bank owner came up to me with the most bemused look on his face.

165
0:08:33.601,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And he said, "You know, I wasn't sure about this whole global warming thing,

166
0:08:37.248,000 --> 0:08:39,000
but it passed the Four-Way Test."

167
0:08:39.892,000 --> 0:08:41,000
(Laughter)

168
0:08:42.47,000 --> 0:08:45,000
(Applause)

169
0:08:50.037,000 --> 0:08:52,000
These values, though -- they have to be genuine.

170
0:08:53.345,000 --> 0:08:56,000
I was giving a talk at a Christian college a number of years ago,

171
0:08:56.464,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and after my talk, a fellow scientist came up and he said,

172
0:08:59.964,000 --> 0:09:,000
"I need some help.

173
0:09:01.189,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I've been really trying hard to get my foot in the door

174
0:09:04.534,000 --> 0:09:05,000
with our local churches,

175
0:09:06.331,000 --> 0:09:07,000
but I can't seem to get any traction.

176
0:09:08.279,000 --> 0:09:1,000
I want to talk to them about why climate change matters."

177
0:09:11.092,000 --> 0:09:12,000
So I said, "Well, the best thing to do

178
0:09:12.958,000 --> 0:09:14,000
is to start with the denomination that you're part of,

179
0:09:15.721,000 --> 0:09:17,000
because you share the most values with those people.

180
0:09:18.236,000 --> 0:09:19,000
What type of church do you attend?"

181
0:09:20.609,000 --> 0:09:22,000
"Oh, I don't attend any church, I'm an atheist," he said.

182
0:09:23.315,000 --> 0:09:24,000
(Laughter)

183
0:09:24.508,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I said, "Well, in that case, starting with a faith community

184
0:09:27.476,000 --> 0:09:28,000
is probably not the best idea.

185
0:09:29.633,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Let's talk about what you do enjoy doing, what you are involved in."

186
0:09:32.877,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And we were able to identify a community group

187
0:09:35.069,000 --> 0:09:37,000
that he was part of, that he could start with.

188
0:09:37.83,000 --> 0:09:39,000
The bottom line is, we don't have to be a liberal tree hugger

189
0:09:40.732,000 --> 0:09:41,000
to care about a changing climate.

190
0:09:42.675,000 --> 0:09:45,000
All we have to be is a human living on this planet.

191
0:09:46.913,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Because no matter where we live,

192
0:09:49.032,000 --> 0:09:52,000
climate change is already affecting us today.

193
0:09:54.525,000 --> 0:09:56,000
If we live along the coasts,

194
0:09:56.81,000 --> 0:09:59,000
in many places, we're already seeing "sunny-day flooding."

195
0:10:02.19,000 --> 0:10:04,000
If we live in western North America,

196
0:10:04.498,000 --> 0:10:07,000
we're seeing much greater area being burned by wildfires.

197
0:10:09.098,000 --> 0:10:1,000
If we live in many coastal locations,

198
0:10:11.033,000 --> 0:10:13,000
from the Gulf of Mexico to the South Pacific,

199
0:10:13.487,000 --> 0:10:17,000
we are seeing stronger hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones,

200
0:10:17.641,000 --> 0:10:18,000
powered by a warming ocean.

201
0:10:19.95,000 --> 0:10:21,000
If we live in Texas or if we live in Syria,

202
0:10:22.585,000 --> 0:10:24,000
we're seeing climate change supersize our droughts,

203
0:10:25.038,000 --> 0:10:27,000
making them more frequent and more severe.

204
0:10:28.244,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Wherever we live, we're already being affected by a changing climate.

205
0:10:31.57,000 --> 0:10:33,000
So you might say, "OK, that's good. We can talk impacts.

206
0:10:34.361,000 --> 0:10:38,000
We can scare the pants off people, because this thing is serious."

207
0:10:38.536,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And it is, believe me. I'm a scientist, I know.

208
0:10:40.798,000 --> 0:10:41,000
(Laughter)

209
0:10:42.276,000 --> 0:10:45,000
But fear is not what is going to motivate us

210
0:10:45.911,000 --> 0:10:48,000
for the long-term, sustained change that we need to fix this thing.

211
0:10:50.68,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Fear is designed to help us run away from the bear.

212
0:10:54.085,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Or just run faster than the person beside us.

213
0:10:56.466,000 --> 0:10:57,000
(Laughter)

214
0:10:59.374,000 --> 0:11:03,000
What we need to fix this thing is rational hope.

215
0:11:04.939,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Yes, we absolutely do need to recognize what's at stake.

216
0:11:08.403,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Of course we do.

217
0:11:10.673,000 --> 0:11:13,000
But we need a vision of a better future --

218
0:11:15.179,000 --> 0:11:17,000
a future with abundant energy,

219
0:11:17.814,000 --> 0:11:18,000
with a stable economy,

220
0:11:19.687,000 --> 0:11:21,000
with resources available to all,

221
0:11:22.218,000 --> 0:11:26,000
where our lives are not worse but better than they are today.

222
0:11:27.747,000 --> 0:11:29,000
There are solutions.

223
0:11:30.04,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And that's why the second important thing that we have to talk about

224
0:11:34.175,000 --> 0:11:4,000
is solutions -- practical, viable, accessible, attractive solutions.

225
0:11:41.307,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Like what?

226
0:11:42.665,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Well, there's no silver bullet, as they say,

227
0:11:44.832,000 --> 0:11:46,000
but there's plenty of silver buckshot.

228
0:11:47.3,000 --> 0:11:48,000
(Laughter)

229
0:11:50.593,000 --> 0:11:52,000
There's simple solutions that save us money

230
0:11:52.72,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and reduce our carbon footprint at the same time.

231
0:11:55.736,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Yes, light bulbs.

232
0:11:57.911,000 --> 0:11:58,000
I love my plug-in car.

233
0:11:59.841,000 --> 0:12:,000
I'd like some solar shingles.

234
0:12:02.159,000 --> 0:12:06,000
But imagine if every home came with a switch beside the front door,

235
0:12:07.147,000 --> 0:12:1,000
that when you left the house, you could turn off everything except your fridge.

236
0:12:10.91,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And maybe the DVR.

237
0:12:12.159,000 --> 0:12:13,000
(Laughter)

238
0:12:13.673,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Lifestyle choices: eating local, eating lower down the food chain

239
0:12:19.199,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and reducing food waste, which at the global scale,

240
0:12:22.319,000 --> 0:12:25,000
is one of the most important things that we can do to fix this problem.

241
0:12:26.334,000 --> 0:12:27,000
I'm a climate scientist,

242
0:12:28.006,000 --> 0:12:32,000
so the irony of traveling around to talk to people about a changing climate

243
0:12:32.208,000 --> 0:12:33,000
is not lost on me.

244
0:12:33.844,000 --> 0:12:34,000
(Laughter)

245
0:12:35.755,000 --> 0:12:38,000
The biggest part of my personal carbon footprint is my travel.

246
0:12:39.675,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And that's why I carefully collect my invitations.

247
0:12:43.383,000 --> 0:12:45,000
I usually don't go anywhere unless I have a critical mass

248
0:12:46.248,000 --> 0:12:47,000
of invitations in one place --

249
0:12:48.042,000 --> 0:12:49,000
anywhere from three to four

250
0:12:49.421,000 --> 0:12:52,000
to sometimes even as many as 10 or 15 talks in a given place --

251
0:12:53.178,000 --> 0:12:55,000
so I can minimize the impact of my carbon footprint

252
0:12:55.996,000 --> 0:12:56,000
as much as possible.

253
0:12:57.273,000 --> 0:13:,000
And I've transitioned nearly three-quarters of the talks I give

254
0:13:00.685,000 --> 0:13:01,000
to video.

255
0:13:02.284,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Often, people will say, "Well, we've never done that before."

256
0:13:05.442,000 --> 0:13:08,000
But I say, "Well, let's give it a try, I think it could work."

257
0:13:10.815,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Most of all, though,

258
0:13:12.07,000 --> 0:13:16,000
we need to talk about what's already happening today around the world

259
0:13:16.435,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and what could happen in the future.

260
0:13:18.91,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Now, I live in Texas,

261
0:13:20.458,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and Texas has the highest carbon emissions of any state in the United States.

262
0:13:24.823,000 --> 0:13:26,000
You might say, "Well, what can you talk about in Texas?"

263
0:13:27.76,000 --> 0:13:29,000
The answer is: a lot.

264
0:13:30.601,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Did you know that in Texas there's over 25,000 jobs

265
0:13:35.429,000 --> 0:13:36,000
in the wind energy industry?

266
0:13:37.315,000 --> 0:13:4,000
We are almost up to 20 percent of our electricity

267
0:13:40.403,000 --> 0:13:42,000
from clean, renewable sources, most of that wind,

268
0:13:42.792,000 --> 0:13:43,000
though solar is growing quickly.

269
0:13:44.917,000 --> 0:13:46,000
The largest army base in the United States, Fort Hood,

270
0:13:47.63,000 --> 0:13:48,000
is, of course, in Texas.

271
0:13:50.175,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And they've been powered by wind and solar energy now,

272
0:13:53.627,000 --> 0:13:56,000
because it's saving taxpayers over 150 million dollars.

273
0:13:58.096,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Yes.

274
0:13:59.271,000 --> 0:14:03,000
(Applause)

275
0:14:04.445,000 --> 0:14:07,000
What about those who don't have the resources that we have?

276
0:14:07.747,000 --> 0:14:09,000
In sub-Saharan Africa, there are hundreds of millions of people

277
0:14:10.741,000 --> 0:14:12,000
who don't have access to any type of energy except kerosine,

278
0:14:13.649,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and it's very expensive.

279
0:14:15.466,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Around the entire world,

280
0:14:17.315,000 --> 0:14:21,000
the fastest-growing type of new energy today is solar.

281
0:14:22.911,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And they have plenty of solar.

282
0:14:26.196,000 --> 0:14:3,000
So social impact investors, nonprofits, even corporations

283
0:14:30.736,000 --> 0:14:33,000
are going in and using innovative new microfinancing schemes,

284
0:14:34.349,000 --> 0:14:35,000
like, pay-as-you-go solar,

285
0:14:36.981,000 --> 0:14:38,000
so that people can buy the power they need in increments,

286
0:14:39.721,000 --> 0:14:4,000
sometimes even on their cell phone.

287
0:14:41.942,000 --> 0:14:44,000
One company, Azuri, has distributed tens of thousands of units

288
0:14:45.163,000 --> 0:14:48,000
across 11 countries, from Rwanda to Uganda.

289
0:14:48.79,000 --> 0:14:51,000
They estimate that they've powered over 30 million hours of electricity

290
0:14:52.799,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and over 10 million hours of cell phone charging.

291
0:14:56.792,000 --> 0:14:59,000
What about the giant growing economies of China and India?

292
0:15:01.502,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Well, climate impacts might seem a little further down the road,

293
0:15:04.542,000 --> 0:15:06,000
but air quality impacts are right here today.

294
0:15:07.455,000 --> 0:15:11,000
And they know that clean energy is essential to powering their future.

295
0:15:11.981,000 --> 0:15:16,000
So China is investing hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy.

296
0:15:17.606,000 --> 0:15:18,000
They're flooding coal mines,

297
0:15:19.133,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and they're putting floating solar panels on the surface.

298
0:15:22.482,000 --> 0:15:23,000
They also have a panda-shaped solar farm.

299
0:15:24.474,000 --> 0:15:25,000
(Applause)

300
0:15:25.649,000 --> 0:15:26,000
(Laughter)

301
0:15:27.133,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Yes, they're still burning coal.

302
0:15:29.395,000 --> 0:15:31,000
But they've shut down all the coal plants around Beijing.

303
0:15:32.538,000 --> 0:15:34,000
And in India, they're looking to replace

304
0:15:34.893,000 --> 0:15:37,000
a quarter of a billion incandescent light bulbs with LEDs,

305
0:15:38.808,000 --> 0:15:41,000
which will save them seven billion dollars in energy costs.

306
0:15:42.72,000 --> 0:15:44,000
They're investing in green jobs,

307
0:15:45.448,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and they're looking to decarbonize their entire vehicle fleet.

308
0:15:48.713,000 --> 0:15:5,000
India may be the first country to industrialize

309
0:15:51.733,000 --> 0:15:53,000
without relying primarily on fossil fuels.

310
0:15:55.76,000 --> 0:15:56,000
The world is changing.

311
0:15:57.99,000 --> 0:15:59,000
But it just isn't changing fast enough.

312
0:16:01.236,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Too often, we picture this problem

313
0:16:03.014,000 --> 0:16:05,000
as a giant boulder sitting at the bottom of a hill,

314
0:16:05.593,000 --> 0:16:07,000
with only a few hands on it, trying to roll it up the hill.

315
0:16:08.609,000 --> 0:16:11,000
But in reality, that boulder is already at the top of the hill.

316
0:16:11.728,000 --> 0:16:14,000
And it's got hundreds of millions of hands, maybe even billions on it,

317
0:16:15.066,000 --> 0:16:16,000
pushing it down.

318
0:16:16.32,000 --> 0:16:18,000
It just isn't going fast enough.

319
0:16:19.292,000 --> 0:16:23,000
So how do we speed up that giant boulder so we can fix climate change in time?

320
0:16:24.641,000 --> 0:16:25,000
You guessed it.

321
0:16:25.989,000 --> 0:16:27,000
The number one way is by talking about it.

322
0:16:29.781,000 --> 0:16:3,000
The bottom line is this:

323
0:16:32.797,000 --> 0:16:36,000
climate change is affecting you and me right here, right now,

324
0:16:37.115,000 --> 0:16:38,000
in the places where we live.

325
0:16:40.875,000 --> 0:16:42,000
But by working together, we can fix it.

326
0:16:43.502,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Sure, it's a daunting problem.

327
0:16:45.019,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Nobody knows that more than us climate scientists.

328
0:16:48.458,000 --> 0:16:5,000
But we can't give in to despair.

329
0:16:50.965,000 --> 0:16:53,000
We have to go out and actively look for the hope that we need,

330
0:16:54.498,000 --> 0:16:56,000
that will inspire us to act.

331
0:16:57.465,000 --> 0:17:01,000
And that hope begins with a conversation today.

332
0:17:03.053,000 --> 0:17:04,000
Thank you.

333
0:17:04.274,000 --> 0:17:1,000
(Applause)

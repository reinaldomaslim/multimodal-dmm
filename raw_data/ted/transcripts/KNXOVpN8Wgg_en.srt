1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Roger Ebert: These are my words, but this is not my voice.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
This is Alex, the best computer voice

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I've been able to find,

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
which comes as standard equipment on every Macintosh.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
For most of my life,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I never gave a second thought to my ability to speak.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It was like breathing.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
In those days, I was living in a fool's paradise.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
After surgeries for cancer

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
took away my ability to speak, eat or drink,

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I was forced to enter this virtual world

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
in which a computer does some of my living for me.

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
For several days now,

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
we have enjoyed brilliant and articulate speakers here at TED.

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I used to be able to talk like that.

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Maybe I wasn't as smart,

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
but I was at least as talkative.

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I want to devote my talk today

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
to the act of speaking itself,

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and how the act of speaking or not speaking

21
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
is tied so indelibly to one's identity

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
as to force the birth of a new person

23
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
when it is taken away.

24
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
However, I've found that listening to a computer voice

25
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
for any great length of time

26
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
can be monotonous.

27
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So I've decided to recruit some of my TED friends

28
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
to read my words aloud for me.

29
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I will start with my wife, Chaz.

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Chaz Ebert: It was Chaz who stood by my side

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
through three attempts to reconstruct my jaw

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and restore my ability to speak.

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Going into the first surgery

34
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
for a recurrence of salivary cancer

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
in 2006,

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I expected to be out of the hospital

37
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
in time to return to my movie review show,

38
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
'Ebert and Roeper at the Movies.'

39
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I had pre-taped enough shows

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
to get me through six weeks of surgery

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and recuperation.

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
The doctors took a fibula bone from my leg

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
and some tissue from my shoulder

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
to fashion into a new jaw.

45
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
My tongue, larynx and vocal cords

46
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
were still healthy and unaffected.

47
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
CE: I was optimistic,

50
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and all was right with the world.

51
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The first surgery was a great success.

52
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I saw myself in the mirror

53
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and I looked pretty good.

54
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Two weeks later, I was ready to return home.

55
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I was using my iPod

56
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to play the Leonard Cohen song

57
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
'I'm Your Man'

58
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
for my doctors and nurses.

59
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Suddenly, I had an episode of catastrophic bleeding.

60
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
My carotid artery had ruptured.

61
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Thank God I was still in my hospital room

62
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
and my doctors were right there.

63
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Chaz told me

64
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
that if that song hadn't played for so long,

65
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I might have already been in the car, on the way home,

66
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and would have died right there and then.

67
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So thank you, Leonard Cohen,

68
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
for saving my life.

69
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
(Applause)

70
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
There was a second surgery --

71
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
which held up for five or six days

72
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and then it also fell apart.

73
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And then a third attempt,

74
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
which also patched me back together pretty well,

75
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
until it failed.

76
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
A doctor from Brazil said

77
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
he had never seen anyone survive

78
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
a carotid artery rupture.

79
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And before I left the hospital,

80
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
after a year of being hospitalized,

81
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I had seven ruptures

82
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
of my carotid artery.

83
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
There was no particular day

84
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
when anyone told me

85
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
I would never speak again;

86
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
it just sort of became obvious.

87
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Human speech

88
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
is an ingenious manipulation of our breath

89
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
within the sound chamber of our mouth

90
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and respiratory system.

91
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
We need to be able to hold and manipulate that breath

92
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
in order to form sounds.

93
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Therefore, the system

94
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
must be essentially airtight

95
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
in order to capture air.

96
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Because I had lost my jaw,

97
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I could no longer form a seal,

98
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and therefore my tongue

99
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and all of my other vocal equipment

100
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
was rendered powerless.

101
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Dean Ornish: At first for a long time,

102
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I wrote messages in notebooks.

103
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Then I tried typing words on my laptop

104
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and using its built in voice.

105
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
This was faster,

106
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and nobody had to try to read my handwriting.

107
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I tried out various computer voices that were available online,

108
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and for several months I had a British accent,

109
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
which Chaz called Sir Lawrence."

110
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Laughter)

111
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
"It was the clearest I could find.

112
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Then Apple released the Alex voice,

113
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
which was the best I'd heard.

114
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
It knew things like the difference

115
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
between an exclamation point and a question mark.

116
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
When it saw a period, it knew how to make a sentence

117
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
sound like it was ending instead of staying up in the air.

118
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
There are all sorts of html codes you can use

119
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
to control the timing and inflection of computer voices,

120
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and I've experimented with them.

121
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
For me, they share a fundamental problem: they're too slow.

122
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
When I find myself in a conversational situation,

123
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I need to type fast and to jump right in.

124
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
People don't have the time or the patience

125
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
to wait for me to fool around with the codes

126
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
for every word or phrase.

127
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
But what value do we place on the sound of our own voice?

128
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
How does that affect who you are as a person?

129
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
When people hear Alex speaking my words,

130
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
do they experience a disconnect?

131
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Does that create a separation or a distance

132
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
from one person to the next?

133
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
How did I feel not being able to speak?

134
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
I felt, and I still feel,

135
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
a lot of distance from the human mainstream.

136
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I've become uncomfortable when I'm separated from my laptop.

137
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Even then, I'm aware that most people have little patience

138
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
for my speaking difficulties.

139
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So Chaz suggested finding a company that could make a customized voice

140
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
using my TV show voice

141
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
from a period of 30 years.

142
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
At first I was against it.

143
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I thought it would be creepy

144
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
to hear my own voice coming from a computer.

145
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
There was something comforting about a voice that was not my own.

146
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
But I decided then to just give it a try.

147
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So we contacted a company in Scotland

148
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that created personalized computer voices.

149
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
They'd never made one from previously-recorded materials.

150
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
All of their voices had been made by a speaker

151
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
recording original words in a control booth.

152
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
But they were willing to give it a try.

153
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So I sent them many hours of recordings of my voice,

154
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
including several audio commentary tracks

155
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
that I'd made for movies on DVDs.

156
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And it sounded like me, it really did.

157
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
There was a reason for that; it was me.

158
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
But it wasn't that simple.

159
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
The tapes from my TV show weren't very useful

160
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
because there were too many other kinds of audio involved --

161
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
movie soundtracks, for example, or Gene Siskel arguing with me --

162
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
(Laughter)

163
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and my words often had a particular emphasis

164
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
that didn't fit into a sentence well enough.

165
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I'll let you hear a sample of that voice.

166
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
These are a few of the comments I recorded for use

167
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
when Chaz and I appeared on the Oprah Winfrey program.

168
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And here's the voice we call Roger Jr.

169
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
or Roger 2.0.

170
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Roger 2.0: Oprah, I can't tell you how great it is

171
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
to be back on your show.

172
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
We have been talking for a long time,

173
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and now here we are again.

174
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
This is the first version of my computer voice.

175
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
It still needs improvement,

176
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
but at least it sounds like me

177
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and not like HAL 9000.

178
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
When I heard it the first time,

179
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
it sent chills down my spine.

180
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
When I type anything,

181
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
this voice will speak whatever I type.

182
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
When I read something, it will read in my voice.

183
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
I have typed these words in advance,

184
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
as I didn't think it would be thrilling

185
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
to sit here watching me typing.

186
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
The voice was created by a company in Scotland

187
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
named CereProc.

188
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
It makes me feel good

189
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that many of the words you are hearing were first spoken

190
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
while I was commenting on "Casablanca"

191
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and "Citizen Kane."

192
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
This is the first voice they've created for an individual.

193
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
There are several very good voices available for computers,

194
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
but they all sound like somebody else,

195
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
while this voice sounds like me.

196
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I plan to use it on television, radio

197
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and the Internet.

198
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
People who need a voice should know

199
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that most computers already come with built-in speaking systems.

200
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Many blind people use them

201
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
to read pages on the Web to themselves.

202
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
But I've got to say, in first grade,

203
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
they said I talked too much,

204
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and now I still can.

205
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
(Laughter)

206
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Roger Ebert: As you can hear, it sounds like me,

207
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
but the words jump up and down.

208
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
The flow isn't natural.

209
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
The good people in Scotland are still improving my voice,

210
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and I'm optimistic about it.

211
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
But so far, the Apple Alex voice

212
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
is the best one I've heard.

213
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
I wrote a blog about it

214
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and actually got a comment from the actor who played Alex.

215
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
He said he recorded many long hours in various intonations

216
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
to be used in the voice.

217
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
A very large sample is needed.

218
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
John Hunter: All my life I was a motormouth.

219
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Now I have spoken my last words,

220
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and I don't even remember for sure

221
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
what they were.

222
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
I feel like the hero of that Harlan Ellison story

223
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
titled "I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream."

224
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
On Wednesday, David Christian explained to us

225
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
what a tiny instant the human race represents

226
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
in the time-span of the universe.

227
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
For almost all of its millions and billions of years,

228
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
there was no life on Earth at all.

229
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
For almost all the years of life on Earth,

230
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
there was no intelligent life.

231
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Only after we learned to pass knowledge

232
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
from one generation to the next,

233
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
did civilization become possible.

234
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
In cosmological terms,

235
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
that was about 10 minutes ago.

236
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Finally came mankind's most advanced and mysterious tool,

237
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
the computer.

238
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
That has mostly happened in my lifetime.

239
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Some of the famous early computers

240
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
were being built in my hometown of Urbana,

241
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
the birthplace of HAL 9000.

242
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
When I heard the amazing talk

243
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
by Salman Khan on Wednesday,

244
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
about the Khan Academy website

245
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
that teaches hundreds of subjects to students all over the world,

246
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
I had a flashback.

247
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
It was about 1960.

248
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
As a local newspaper reporter still in high school,

249
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
I was sent over to the computer lab of the University of Illinois

250
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
to interview the creators

251
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
of something called PLATO.

252
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
The initials stood for Programmed Logic

253
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
for Automated Teaching Operations.

254
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
This was a computer-assisted instruction system,

255
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
which in those days ran on a computer named ILLIAC.

256
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
The programmers said it could assist students in their learning.

257
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
I doubt, on that day 50 years ago,

258
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
they even dreamed of what Salman Khan has accomplished.

259
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
But that's not the point.

260
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
The point is PLATO was only 50 years ago,

261
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
an instant in time.

262
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
It continued to evolve and operated in one form or another

263
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
on more and more sophisticated computers,

264
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
until only five years ago.

265
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
I have learned from Wikipedia

266
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
that, starting with that humble beginning,

267
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
PLATO established forums, message boards,

268
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
online testing,

269
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
email, chat rooms,

270
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
picture languages, instant messaging,

271
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
remote screen sharing

272
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and multiple-player games.

273
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Since the first Web browser was also developed in Urbana,

274
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
it appears that my hometown

275
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
in downstate Illinois

276
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
was the birthplace

277
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
of much of the virtual, online universe we occupy today.

278
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
But I'm not here from the Chamber of Commerce.

279
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
(Laughter)

280
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
I'm here as a man who wants to communicate.

281
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
All of this has happened in my lifetime.

282
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
I started writing on a computer back in the 1970s

283
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
when one of the first Atech systems was installed

284
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
at the Chicago Sun-Times.

285
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
I was in line at Radio Shack

286
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
to buy one of the first Model 100's.

287
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And when I told the people in the press room at the Academy Awards

288
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
that they'd better install some phone lines for Internet connections,

289
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
they didn't know what I was talking about.

290
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
When I bought my first desktop,

291
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
it was a DEC Rainbow.

292
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Does anybody remember that?"

293
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
(Applause)

294
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
"The Sun Times sent me to the Cannes Film Festival

295
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
with a portable computer the size of a suitcase

296
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
named the Porteram Telebubble.

297
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
I joined CompuServe

298
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
when it had fewer numbers

299
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
than I currently have followers on Twitter.

300
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
(Laughter)

301
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
CE: All of this has happened

302
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
in the blink of an eye.

303
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
It is unimaginable

304
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
what will happen next.

305
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
It makes me incredibly fortunate

306
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
to live at this moment in history.

307
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Indeed, I am lucky to live in history at all,

308
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
because without intelligence and memory

309
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
there is no history.

310
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
For billions of years,

311
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
the universe evolved

312
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
completely without notice.

313
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Now we live in the age of the Internet,

314
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
which seems to be creating a form of global consciousness.

315
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And because of it,

316
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
I can communicate

317
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
as well as I ever could.

318
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
We are born into a box

319
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
of time and space.

320
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
We use words and communication

321
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
to break out of it

322
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and to reach out to others.

323
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
For me, the Internet began

324
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
as a useful tool

325
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and now has become something I rely on

326
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
for my actual daily existence.

327
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
I cannot speak;

328
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
I can only type so fast.

329
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Computer voices

330
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
are sometimes not very sophisticated,

331
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
but with my computer,

332
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
I can communicate more widely

333
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
than ever before.

334
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
I feel as if my blog,

335
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
my email, Twitter and Facebook

336
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
have given me a substitute

337
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
for everyday conversation.

338
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
They aren't an improvement,

339
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
but they're the best I can do.

340
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
They give me a way to speak.

341
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Not everybody has the patience

342
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
of my wife, Chaz.

343
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
But online,

344
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
everybody speaks at the same speed.

345
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
This whole adventure

346
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
has been a learning experience.

347
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Every time there was a surgery that failed,

348
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
I was left with a little less flesh and bone.

349
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Now I have no jaw left at all.

350
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
While harvesting tissue from both my shoulders,

351
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
the surgeries left me with back pain

352
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
and reduced my ability to walk easily.

353
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Ironic that my legs are fine,

354
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and it's my shoulders that slow up my walk.

355
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
When you see me today,

356
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
I look like the Phantom of the Opera.

357
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
But no you don't.

358
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
(Laughter)

359
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
(Applause)

360
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
It is human nature to look at someone like me

361
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
and assume I have lost some of my marbles.

362
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
People --

363
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
(Applause)

364
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
People talk loudly --

365
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
I'm so sorry.

366
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Excuse me.

367
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
(Applause)

368
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
People talk loudly and slowly to me.

369
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Sometimes they assume I am deaf.

370
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
There are people who don't want to make eye contact.

371
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
Believe me, he didn't mean this as --

372
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
anyway, let me just read it.

373
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
(Laughter)

374
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
You should never let your wife read something like this.

375
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
(Laughter)

376
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
It is human nature

377
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
to look away from illness.

378
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
We don't enjoy a reminder

379
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
of our own fragile mortality.

380
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
That's why writing on the Internet

381
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
has become a lifesaver for me.

382
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
My ability to think and write

383
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
have not been affected.

384
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
And on the Web, my real voice finds expression.

385
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
I have also met many other disabled people

386
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
who communicate this way.

387
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
One of my Twitter friends

388
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
can type only with his toes.

389
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
One of the funniest blogs on the Web

390
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
is written by a friend of mine

391
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
named Smartass Cripple.

392
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
(Laughter)

393
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
Google him and he will make you laugh.

394
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
All of these people are saying, in one way or another,

395
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
that what you see

396
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
is not all you get.

397
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
So I have not come here to complain.

398
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
I have much to make me happy and relieved.

399
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
I seem, for the time being,

400
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
to be cancer-free.

401
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
I am writing as well as ever.

402
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
I am productive.

403
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
If I were in this condition at any point

404
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
before a few cosmological instants ago,

405
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
I would be as isolated as a hermit.

406
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
I would be trapped inside my head.

407
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
Because of the rush of human knowledge,

408
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
because of the digital revolution,

409
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
I have a voice,

410
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
and I do not need to scream.

411
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
RE: Wait. I have one more thing to add.

412
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
A guy goes into a psychiatrist.

413
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:15,000
The psychiatrist says, "You're crazy."

414
0:18:15.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
The guy says, "I want a second opinion."

415
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
The psychiatrist says, "All right, you're ugly."

416
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
(Laughter)

417
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
You all know the test for artificial intelligence -- the Turing test.

418
0:18:29.26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
A human judge has a conversation

419
0:18:31.26,000 --> 0:18:33,000
with a human and a computer.

420
0:18:33.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
If the judge can't tell the machine apart from the human,

421
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:39,000
the machine has passed the test.

422
0:18:39.26,000 --> 0:18:43,000
I now propose a test for computer voices -- the Ebert test.

423
0:18:43.26,000 --> 0:18:46,000
If a computer voice can successfully tell a joke

424
0:18:46.26,000 --> 0:18:49,000
and do the timing and delivery as well as Henny Youngman,

425
0:18:49.26,000 --> 0:18:51,000
then that's the voice I want.

426
0:18:51.26,000 --> 0:19:23,000
(Applause)

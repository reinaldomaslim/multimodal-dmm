1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Chris Anderson: Perhaps we could start by just telling us about your country.

2
0:00:16.44,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It's three dots there on the globe. Those dots are pretty huge.

3
0:00:20.32,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I think each one is about the size of California.

4
0:00:23,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Tell us about Kiribati.

5
0:00:24.88,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Anote Tong: Well, let me first begin by saying how deeply grateful I am

6
0:00:29.4,000 --> 0:00:33,000
for this opportunity to share my story with people who do care.

7
0:00:33.56,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I think I've been sharing my story with a lot of people who don't care too much.

8
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
But Kiribati is comprised of three groups of islands:

9
0:00:43.04,000 --> 0:00:45,000
the Gilbert Group on the west,

10
0:00:45.88,000 --> 0:00:48,000
we have the Phoenix Islands in the middle,

11
0:00:49.24,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and the Line Islands in the east.

12
0:00:53.68,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And quite frankly, Kiribati is perhaps the only country

13
0:00:56.8,000 --> 0:00:58,000
that is actually in the four corners of the world,

14
0:00:59.166,000 --> 0:01:02,000
because we are in the Northern Hemisphere, in the Southern Hemisphere,

15
0:01:02.49,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and also in the east and the west of the International Date Line.

16
0:01:05.57,000 --> 0:01:11,000
These islands are entirely made up of coral atolls,

17
0:01:11.92,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and on average about two meters above sea level.

18
0:01:16.879,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And so this is what we have.

19
0:01:20.36,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Usually not more than two kilometers in width.

20
0:01:25.2,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And so, on many occasions, I've been asked by people,

21
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
"You know, you're suffering, why don't you move back?"

22
0:01:30.72,000 --> 0:01:31,000
They don't understand.

23
0:01:31.96,000 --> 0:01:34,000
They have no concept of what it is that's involved.

24
0:01:35.68,000 --> 0:01:38,000
With the rising sea, they say, "Well, you can move back."

25
0:01:39.28,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And so this is what I tell them.

26
0:01:40.88,000 --> 0:01:44,000
If we move back, we will fall off on the other side of the ocean. OK?

27
0:01:45.24,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But these are the kinds of issues that people don't understand.

28
0:01:50.04,000 --> 0:01:54,000
CA: So certainly this is just a picture of fragility there.

29
0:01:54.28,000 --> 0:01:56,000
When was it that you yourself realized

30
0:01:56.84,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that there might be impending peril for your country?

31
0:02:00.48,000 --> 0:02:03,000
AT: Well, the story of climate change has been one that has been going on

32
0:02:03.96,000 --> 0:02:04,000
for quite a number of decades.

33
0:02:05.44,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And when I came into office in 2003,

34
0:02:10.2,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I began talking about climate change at the United Nations General Assembly,

35
0:02:14.48,000 --> 0:02:16,000
but not with so much passion,

36
0:02:17.24,000 --> 0:02:2,000
because then there was still this controversy among the scientists

37
0:02:20.88,000 --> 0:02:25,000
whether it was human-induced, whether it was real or it wasn't.

38
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
But I think that that debate was fairly much concluded in 2007

39
0:02:32.32,000 --> 0:02:37,000
with the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC,

40
0:02:37.92,000 --> 0:02:43,000
which made a categorical statement that it is real, it's human-induced,

41
0:02:44.8,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and it's predicting some very serious scenarios

42
0:02:48.76,000 --> 0:02:5,000
for countries like mine.

43
0:02:51.32,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And so that's when I got very serious.

44
0:02:54.6,000 --> 0:02:57,000
In the past, I talked about it.

45
0:02:58.6,000 --> 0:02:59,000
We were worried.

46
0:02:59.84,000 --> 0:03:02,000
But when the scenarios, the predictions came in 2007,

47
0:03:03.6,000 --> 0:03:05,000
it became a real issue for us.

48
0:03:05.96,000 --> 0:03:1,000
CA: Now, those predictions are, I think, that by 2100,

49
0:03:11.6,000 --> 0:03:13,000
sea levels are forecast to rise perhaps three feet.

50
0:03:14.4,000 --> 0:03:16,000
There's scenarios where it's higher than that, for sure,

51
0:03:17.044,000 --> 0:03:19,000
but what would you say to a skeptic who said,

52
0:03:19.204,000 --> 0:03:2,000
"What's three feet?

53
0:03:20.4,000 --> 0:03:22,000
You're on average six feet above sea level.

54
0:03:22.6,000 --> 0:03:23,000
What's the problem?"

55
0:03:24.2,000 --> 0:03:26,000
AT: Well, I think it's got to be understood

56
0:03:26.28,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that a marginal rise in sea level

57
0:03:28.36,000 --> 0:03:3,000
would mean a loss of a lot of land,

58
0:03:30.96,000 --> 0:03:33,000
because much of the land is low.

59
0:03:34.24,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And quite apart from that, we are getting the swells at the moment.

60
0:03:39.36,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So it's not about getting two feet.

61
0:03:41.56,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I think what many people do not understand

62
0:03:44.6,000 --> 0:03:5,000
is they think climate change is something that is happening in the future.

63
0:03:50.8,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Well, we're at the very bottom end of the spectrum.

64
0:03:53.64,000 --> 0:03:54,000
It's already with us.

65
0:03:54.92,000 --> 0:03:57,000
We have communities who already have been dislocated.

66
0:03:58.76,000 --> 0:04:01,000
They have had to move, and every parliament session,

67
0:04:02.72,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I'm getting complaints from different communities

68
0:04:05.08,000 --> 0:04:08,000
asking for assistance to build seawalls,

69
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
to see what we can do about the freshwater lens

70
0:04:10.72,000 --> 0:04:11,000
because it's being destroyed,

71
0:04:12.56,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and so in my trips to the different islands,

72
0:04:15.32,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I'm seeing evidence of communities

73
0:04:18.04,000 --> 0:04:21,000
which are now having to cope with the loss of food crops,

74
0:04:21.68,000 --> 0:04:24,000
the contamination of the water lenses,

75
0:04:25.28,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and I see these communities perhaps leaving, having to relocate,

76
0:04:29.64,000 --> 0:04:31,000
within five to 10 years.

77
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:35,000
CA: And then, I think the country suffered its first cyclone,

78
0:04:35.96,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and this is connected, yes? What happened here?

79
0:04:39.52,000 --> 0:04:41,000
AT: Well, we're on the equator,

80
0:04:42.24,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and I'm sure many of you understand that when you're on the equator,

81
0:04:46.68,000 --> 0:04:49,000
it's supposed to be in the doldrums. We're not supposed to get the cyclones.

82
0:04:50.28,000 --> 0:04:52,000
We create them, and then we send them either north or south.

83
0:04:53.114,000 --> 0:04:54,000
(Laughter)

84
0:04:54.52,000 --> 0:04:55,000
But they aren't supposed to come back.

85
0:04:56.4,000 --> 0:04:58,000
But for the first time, at the beginning of this year,

86
0:04:58.948,000 --> 0:05:01,000
the Cyclone Pam, which destroyed Vanuatu,

87
0:05:02.64,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and in the process, the very edges of it actually touched

88
0:05:06.12,000 --> 0:05:08,000
our two southernmost islands,

89
0:05:08.52,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and all of Tuvalu was underwater when Hurricane Pam struck.

90
0:05:13.92,000 --> 0:05:16,000
But for our two southernmost islands,

91
0:05:17.64,000 --> 0:05:2,000
we had waves come over half the island,

92
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and so this has never happened before.

93
0:05:23.48,000 --> 0:05:24,000
It's a new experience.

94
0:05:25.08,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And I've just come back from my own constituency,

95
0:05:30.44,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and I've seen these beautiful trees which had been there for decades,

96
0:05:33.8,000 --> 0:05:34,000
they've been totally destroyed.

97
0:05:35.8,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So this is what's happening,

98
0:05:37.52,000 --> 0:05:4,000
but when we talk about the rising sea level,

99
0:05:41.4,000 --> 0:05:44,000
we think it's something that happens gradually.

100
0:05:44.52,000 --> 0:05:47,000
It comes with the winds, it comes with the swells,

101
0:05:47.6,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and so they can be magnified,

102
0:05:49.56,000 --> 0:05:55,000
but what we are beginning to witness is the change in the weather pattern,

103
0:05:55.76,000 --> 0:05:57,000
which is perhaps the more urgent challenge

104
0:05:58.52,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that we will face sooner than perhaps the rising sea level.

105
0:06:03.08,000 --> 0:06:06,000
CA: So the country is already seeing effects now.

106
0:06:06.36,000 --> 0:06:08,000
As you look forward,

107
0:06:08.56,000 --> 0:06:11,000
what are your options as a country, as a nation?

108
0:06:12.52,000 --> 0:06:14,000
AT: Well, I've been telling this story every year.

109
0:06:15.2,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I think I visit a number of --

110
0:06:16.653,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I've been traveling the world to try and get people to understand.

111
0:06:21.64,000 --> 0:06:23,000
We have a plan, we think we have a plan.

112
0:06:24.12,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And on one occasion, I think I spoke in Geneva

113
0:06:27.56,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and there was a gentleman who was interviewing me

114
0:06:31.76,000 --> 0:06:32,000
on something like this,

115
0:06:33.52,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and I said, "We are looking at floating islands,"

116
0:06:35.88,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and he thought it was funny, but somebody said,

117
0:06:38.12,000 --> 0:06:41,000
"No, this is not funny. These people are looking for solutions."

118
0:06:42.08,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And so I have been looking at floating islands.

119
0:06:45.64,000 --> 0:06:48,000
The Japanese are interested in building floating islands.

120
0:06:49.4,000 --> 0:06:51,000
But, as a country, we have made a commitment

121
0:06:52.36,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that no matter what happens, we will try as much as possible

122
0:06:56.08,000 --> 0:07:,000
to stay and continue to exist as a nation.

123
0:07:00.28,000 --> 0:07:01,000
What that will take,

124
0:07:01.84,000 --> 0:07:04,000
it's going to be something quite significant,

125
0:07:05.28,000 --> 0:07:07,000
very, very substantial.

126
0:07:07.32,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Either we live on floating islands,

127
0:07:09.12,000 --> 0:07:12,000
or we have to build up the islands to continue to stay out of the water

128
0:07:13.12,000 --> 0:07:17,000
as the sea level rises and as the storms get more severe.

129
0:07:17.88,000 --> 0:07:19,000
But even that, it's going to be very, very difficult

130
0:07:20.333,000 --> 0:07:22,000
to get the kind of resourcing that we would need.

131
0:07:23.2,000 --> 0:07:26,000
CA: And then the only recourse is some form of forced migration.

132
0:07:27.08,000 --> 0:07:29,000
AT: Well, we are also looking at that

133
0:07:29.32,000 --> 0:07:31,000
because in the event that nothing comes forward

134
0:07:32.24,000 --> 0:07:33,000
from the international community,

135
0:07:34.08,000 --> 0:07:35,000
we are preparing,

136
0:07:35.36,000 --> 0:07:38,000
we don't want to be caught like what's happening in Europe.

137
0:07:38.6,000 --> 0:07:4,000
OK? We don't want to mass migrate at some point in time.

138
0:07:41.32,000 --> 0:07:44,000
We want to be able to give the people the choice today,

139
0:07:44.76,000 --> 0:07:47,000
those who choose and want to do that, to migrate.

140
0:07:48.44,000 --> 0:07:53,000
We don't want something to happen that they are forced to migrate

141
0:07:53.52,000 --> 0:07:55,000
without having been prepared to do so.

142
0:07:55.84,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Of course, our culture is very different, our society is very different,

143
0:07:59.36,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and once we migrate into a different environment,

144
0:08:01.72,000 --> 0:08:02,000
a different culture,

145
0:08:02.96,000 --> 0:08:04,000
there's a whole lot of adjustments that are required.

146
0:08:05.92,000 --> 0:08:08,000
CA: Well, there's forced migration in your country's past,

147
0:08:09.2,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and I think just this week,

148
0:08:10.88,000 --> 0:08:13,000
just yesterday or the day before yesterday,

149
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
you visited these people.

150
0:08:16.36,000 --> 0:08:18,000
What happened here? What's the story here?

151
0:08:18.56,000 --> 0:08:2,000
AT: Yes, and I'm sorry, I think somebody was asking

152
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:23,000
why we were sneaking off to visit that place.

153
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I had a very good reason, because we have a community of Kiribati people

154
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:32,000
living in that part of the Solomon Islands,

155
0:08:32.12,000 --> 0:08:35,000
but these were people who were relocated from the Phoenix Islands, in fact,

156
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:37,000
in the 1960s.

157
0:08:37.48,000 --> 0:08:41,000
There was serious drought, and the people could not continue to live on the island,

158
0:08:42.04,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and so they were moved to live here in the Solomon Islands.

159
0:08:45.44,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And so yesterday it was very interesting to meet with these people.

160
0:08:48.64,000 --> 0:08:5,000
They didn't know who I was. They hadn't heard of me.

161
0:08:51.12,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Some of them later recognized me,

162
0:08:53.72,000 --> 0:08:56,000
but I think they were very happy.

163
0:08:57.32,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Later they really wanted to have the opportunity to welcome me formally.

164
0:09:01.76,000 --> 0:09:04,000
But I think what I saw yesterday was very interesting

165
0:09:05.04,000 --> 0:09:06,000
because here I see our people.

166
0:09:06.88,000 --> 0:09:11,000
I spoke in our language, and of course they spoke back, they replied,

167
0:09:12.72,000 --> 0:09:16,000
but their accent, they are beginning not to be able to speak Kiribati properly.

168
0:09:17.44,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I saw them, there was this lady with red teeth.

169
0:09:19.96,000 --> 0:09:21,000
She was chewing betel nuts,

170
0:09:22.2,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and it's not something we do in Kiribati.

171
0:09:24.48,000 --> 0:09:26,000
We don't chew betel nuts.

172
0:09:27.12,000 --> 0:09:32,000
I met also a family who have married the local people here,

173
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and so this is what is happening.

174
0:09:37.12,000 --> 0:09:4,000
As you go into another community, there are bound to be changes.

175
0:09:40.72,000 --> 0:09:44,000
There is bound to be a certain loss of identity,

176
0:09:45.2,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and this is what we will be looking for in the future

177
0:09:48.68,000 --> 0:09:5,000
if and when we do migrate.

178
0:09:50.96,000 --> 0:09:53,000
CA: It must have been just an extraordinarily emotional day

179
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
because of these questions about identity,

180
0:09:57,000 --> 0:10:02,000
the joy of seeing you and perhaps an emphasized sense of what they had lost.

181
0:10:02.24,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And it's very inspiring to hear you say you're going to fight to the end

182
0:10:05.645,000 --> 0:10:09,000
to try to preserve the nation in a location.

183
0:10:10.08,000 --> 0:10:11,000
AT: This is our wish.

184
0:10:11.4,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Nobody wants ever to leave their home,

185
0:10:14.48,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and so it's been a very difficult decision for me.

186
0:10:17.56,000 --> 0:10:22,000
As a leader, you don't make plans to leave your island, your home,

187
0:10:22.96,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and so I've been asked on a number of occasions,

188
0:10:25.24,000 --> 0:10:26,000
"So how do you feel?"

189
0:10:26.48,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And it doesn't feel good at all.

190
0:10:29.64,000 --> 0:10:32,000
It's an emotional thing, and I've tried to live with it,

191
0:10:33.24,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and I know that on occasions, I'm accused of not trying to solve the problem

192
0:10:38.2,000 --> 0:10:39,000
because I can't solve the problem.

193
0:10:40.2,000 --> 0:10:42,000
It's something that's got to be done collectively.

194
0:10:43.04,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Climate change is a global phenomenon, and as I've often argued,

195
0:10:48.84,000 --> 0:10:52,000
unfortunately, the countries, when we come to the United Nations --

196
0:10:53.36,000 --> 0:10:57,000
I was in a meeting with the Pacific Island Forum countries

197
0:10:58.28,000 --> 0:11:,000
where Australia and New Zealand are also members,

198
0:11:00.8,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and we had an argument.

199
0:11:02.56,000 --> 0:11:04,000
There was a bit of a story in the news

200
0:11:05.28,000 --> 0:11:09,000
because they were arguing that to cut emissions,

201
0:11:09.6,000 --> 0:11:11,000
it would be something that they're unable to do

202
0:11:11.88,000 --> 0:11:14,000
because it would affect the industries.

203
0:11:15.12,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And so here I was saying,

204
0:11:16.6,000 --> 0:11:18,000
OK, I hear you,

205
0:11:18.84,000 --> 0:11:19,000
I understand what you're saying,

206
0:11:20.52,000 --> 0:11:22,000
but try also to understand what I'm saying

207
0:11:22.8,000 --> 0:11:24,000
because if you do not cut your emissions,

208
0:11:25.44,000 --> 0:11:27,000
then our survival is on the line.

209
0:11:27.84,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And so it's a matter for you to weigh this, these moral issues.

210
0:11:32.2,000 --> 0:11:36,000
It's about industry as opposed to the survival of a people.

211
0:11:36.24,000 --> 0:11:38,000
CA: You know, I ask you yesterday what made you angry,

212
0:11:38.92,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and you said, "I don't get angry." But then you paused.

213
0:11:42.44,000 --> 0:11:43,000
I think this made you angry.

214
0:11:44.08,000 --> 0:11:48,000
AT: I'd refer you to my earlier statement at the United Nations.

215
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:53,000
I was very angry, very frustrated and then depressed.

216
0:11:53.96,000 --> 0:11:54,000
There was a sense of futility

217
0:11:55.96,000 --> 0:12:,000
that we are fighting a fight that we have no hope of winning.

218
0:12:01.44,000 --> 0:12:03,000
I had to change my approach.

219
0:12:03.64,000 --> 0:12:05,000
I had to become more reasonable

220
0:12:05.76,000 --> 0:12:08,000
because I thought people would listen to somebody who was rational,

221
0:12:08.927,000 --> 0:12:1,000
but I remain radically rational, whatever that is.

222
0:12:11.52,000 --> 0:12:12,000
(Laughter)

223
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
CA: Now, a core part of your nation's identity is fishing.

224
0:12:16.92,000 --> 0:12:19,000
I think you said pretty much everyone is involved in fishing in some way.

225
0:12:20.44,000 --> 0:12:22,000
AT: Well, we eat fish every day, every day,

226
0:12:23.24,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and I think there is no doubt that our rate of consumption of fish

227
0:12:27.8,000 --> 0:12:29,000
is perhaps the highest in the world.

228
0:12:29.96,000 --> 0:12:31,000
We don't have a lot of livestock,

229
0:12:32.44,000 --> 0:12:34,000
so it's fish that we depend on.

230
0:12:35.24,000 --> 0:12:38,000
CA: So you're dependent on fish, both at the local level

231
0:12:38.4,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and for the revenues that the country receives

232
0:12:41.12,000 --> 0:12:43,000
from the global fishing business for tuna,

233
0:12:43.72,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and yet despite that, a few years ago you took a very radical step.

234
0:12:48.64,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Can you tell us about that?

235
0:12:50.04,000 --> 0:12:53,000
I think something happened right here in the Phoenix Islands.

236
0:12:53.4,000 --> 0:12:58,000
AT: Let me give some of the background of what fish means for us.

237
0:12:58.72,000 --> 0:13:01,000
We have one of the largest tuna fisheries remaining in the world.

238
0:13:02.68,000 --> 0:13:04,000
In the Pacific, I think we own something like 60 percent

239
0:13:05.56,000 --> 0:13:06,000
of the remaining tuna fisheries,

240
0:13:07.48,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and it remains relatively healthy for some species, but not all.

241
0:13:11.76,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And Kiribati is one of the three major resource owners,

242
0:13:17.92,000 --> 0:13:18,000
tuna resource owners.

243
0:13:19.64,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And at the moment, we have been getting

244
0:13:23.24,000 --> 0:13:25,000
something like 80 to 90 percent of our revenue

245
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
from access fees, license fees.

246
0:13:28.64,000 --> 0:13:29,000
CA: Of your national revenue.

247
0:13:30.52,000 --> 0:13:31,000
AT: National revenue,

248
0:13:32.36,000 --> 0:13:34,000
which drives everything that we do

249
0:13:35.2,000 --> 0:13:39,000
in governments, hospitals, schools and what have you.

250
0:13:39.24,000 --> 0:13:44,000
But we decided to close this, and it was a very difficult decision.

251
0:13:44.48,000 --> 0:13:49,000
I can assure you, politically, locally, it was not easy,

252
0:13:50.04,000 --> 0:13:53,000
but I was convinced that we had to do this

253
0:13:54,000 --> 0:13:58,000
in order to ensure that the fishery remains sustainable.

254
0:13:58.6,000 --> 0:14:,000
There had been some indications that some of the species,

255
0:14:01.4,000 --> 0:14:05,000
in particular the bigeye, was under serious threat.

256
0:14:05.56,000 --> 0:14:08,000
The yellowfin was also heavily fished.

257
0:14:08.96,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Skipjack remains healthy.

258
0:14:10.72,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And so we had to do something like that, and so that was the reason I did that.

259
0:14:15.52,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Another reason why I did that

260
0:14:19.44,000 --> 0:14:23,000
was because I had been asking the international community

261
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
that in order to deal with climate change, in order to fight climate change,

262
0:14:28.72,000 --> 0:14:31,000
there has got to be sacrifice, there has got to be commitment.

263
0:14:32.64,000 --> 0:14:37,000
So in asking the international community to make a sacrifice,

264
0:14:37.96,000 --> 0:14:39,000
I thought we ourselves need to make that sacrifice.

265
0:14:40.8,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And so we made the sacrifice.

266
0:14:42.64,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And forgoing commercial fishing

267
0:14:47.608,000 --> 0:14:49,000
in the Phoenix Islands protected area

268
0:14:50.24,000 --> 0:14:51,000
would mean a loss of revenue.

269
0:14:52.12,000 --> 0:14:54,000
We are still trying to assess what that loss would be

270
0:14:54.621,000 --> 0:14:59,000
because we actually closed it off at the beginning of this year,

271
0:14:59.88,000 --> 0:15:01,000
and so we will see by the end of this year

272
0:15:02.24,000 --> 0:15:05,000
what it means in terms of the lost revenue.

273
0:15:05.76,000 --> 0:15:07,000
CA: So there's so many things playing into this.

274
0:15:08.04,000 --> 0:15:14,000
On the one hand, it may prompt healthier fisheries.

275
0:15:15.04,000 --> 0:15:17,000
I mean, how much are you able to move the price up

276
0:15:17.44,000 --> 0:15:19,000
that you charge for the remaining areas?

277
0:15:19.96,000 --> 0:15:23,000
AT: The negotiations have been very difficult,

278
0:15:24.6,000 --> 0:15:27,000
but we have managed to raise the cost of a vessel day.

279
0:15:28.48,000 --> 0:15:3,000
For any vessel to come in to fish for a day,

280
0:15:31.12,000 --> 0:15:34,000
we have raised the fee from -- it was $6,000 and $8,000,

281
0:15:34.76,000 --> 0:15:38,000
now to $10,000, $12,000 per vessel day.

282
0:15:39.36,000 --> 0:15:42,000
And so there's been that significant increase.

283
0:15:42.6,000 --> 0:15:46,000
But at the same time, what's important to note is,

284
0:15:47.2,000 --> 0:15:51,000
whereas in the past these fishing boats

285
0:15:51.56,000 --> 0:15:54,000
might be fishing in a day and maybe catch 10 tons,

286
0:15:55.52,000 --> 0:15:58,000
now they're catching maybe 100 tons because they've become so efficient.

287
0:15:59.44,000 --> 0:16:01,000
And so we've got to respond likewise.

288
0:16:01.8,000 --> 0:16:05,000
We've got to be very, very careful because the technology has so improved.

289
0:16:06,000 --> 0:16:11,000
There was a time when the Brazilian fleet moved from the Atlantic to the Pacific.

290
0:16:11.44,000 --> 0:16:12,000
They couldn't.

291
0:16:12.68,000 --> 0:16:15,000
They started experimenting if they could, per se.

292
0:16:15.92,000 --> 0:16:18,000
But now they've got ways of doing it, and they've become so efficient.

293
0:16:21,000 --> 0:16:24,000
CA: Can you give us a sense of what it's like in those negotiations?

294
0:16:24.223,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Because you're up against companies

295
0:16:25.944,000 --> 0:16:28,000
that have hundreds of millions of dollars at stake, essentially.

296
0:16:29.56,000 --> 0:16:32,000
How do you hold the line?

297
0:16:32.92,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Is there any advice you can give

298
0:16:35,000 --> 0:16:38,000
to other leaders who are dealing with the same companies

299
0:16:38.08,000 --> 0:16:42,000
about how to get the most for your country,

300
0:16:42.4,000 --> 0:16:46,000
get the most for the fish?

301
0:16:46.44,000 --> 0:16:47,000
What advice would you give?

302
0:16:48,000 --> 0:16:54,000
AT: Well, I think we focus too often on licensing

303
0:16:54.28,000 --> 0:16:55,000
in order to get the rate of return,

304
0:16:55.971,000 --> 0:16:57,000
because what we are getting from license fees

305
0:16:58.8,000 --> 0:17:,000
is about 10 percent of the landed value of the catch

306
0:17:01.44,000 --> 0:17:04,000
on the side of the wharf, not in the retail shops.

307
0:17:04.6,000 --> 0:17:07,000
And we only get about 10 percent.

308
0:17:08.6,000 --> 0:17:1,000
What we have been trying to do over the years

309
0:17:11.24,000 --> 0:17:14,000
is actually to increase our participation in the industry,

310
0:17:15.12,000 --> 0:17:17,000
in the harvesting, in the processing,

311
0:17:17.76,000 --> 0:17:18,000
and eventually, hopefully, the marketing.

312
0:17:19.642,000 --> 0:17:22,000
They're not easy to penetrate,

313
0:17:23.359,000 --> 0:17:25,000
but we are working towards that,

314
0:17:25.68,000 --> 0:17:27,000
and yes, the answer would be to enhance.

315
0:17:28.319,000 --> 0:17:32,000
In order to increase our rate of return, we have to become more involved.

316
0:17:32.56,000 --> 0:17:35,000
And so we've started doing that,

317
0:17:35.76,000 --> 0:17:39,000
and we have to restructure the industry.

318
0:17:40.04,000 --> 0:17:43,000
We've got to tell these people that the world has changed.

319
0:17:43.44,000 --> 0:17:45,000
Now we want to produce the fish ourselves.

320
0:17:45.88,000 --> 0:17:47,000
CA: And meanwhile, for your local fishermen,

321
0:17:48,000 --> 0:17:51,000
they are still able to fish,

322
0:17:51.12,000 --> 0:17:53,000
but what is business like for them?

323
0:17:53.6,000 --> 0:17:55,000
Is it getting harder? Are the waters depleted?

324
0:17:55.96,000 --> 0:17:58,000
Or is that being run on a sustainable basis?

325
0:17:59.44,000 --> 0:18:,000
AT: For the artisanal fishery,

326
0:18:00.92,000 --> 0:18:03,000
we do not participate in the commercial fishing activity

327
0:18:04.2,000 --> 0:18:07,000
except only to supply the domestic market.

328
0:18:07.24,000 --> 0:18:1,000
The tuna fishery is really entirely for the foreign market,

329
0:18:10.56,000 --> 0:18:16,000
mostly here in the US, Europe, Japan.

330
0:18:16.8,000 --> 0:18:2,000
So I am a fisherman, very much,

331
0:18:21.36,000 --> 0:18:24,000
and I used to be able to catch yellowfin.

332
0:18:24.56,000 --> 0:18:26,000
Now it's very, very rare to be able to catch yellowfin

333
0:18:27.36,000 --> 0:18:3,000
because they are being lifted out of the water by the hundreds of tons

334
0:18:30.76,000 --> 0:18:31,000
by these purse seiners.

335
0:18:34.36,000 --> 0:18:38,000
CA: So here's a couple of beautiful girls from your country.

336
0:18:39.32,000 --> 0:18:42,000
I mean, as you think about their future,

337
0:18:42.56,000 --> 0:18:44,000
what message would you have for them

338
0:18:45.24,000 --> 0:18:48,000
and what message would you have for the world?

339
0:18:48.28,000 --> 0:18:51,000
AT: Well, I've been telling the world that we really have to do something

340
0:18:51.733,000 --> 0:18:52,000
about what is happening to the climate

341
0:18:53.6,000 --> 0:18:55,000
because for us, it's about the future of these children.

342
0:18:56.4,000 --> 0:18:57,000
I have 12 grandchildren, at least.

343
0:18:58.36,000 --> 0:19:,000
I think I have 12, my wife knows.

344
0:19:00.4,000 --> 0:19:02,000
(Laughter)

345
0:19:02.64,000 --> 0:19:05,000
And I think I have eight children.

346
0:19:05.68,000 --> 0:19:06,000
It's about their future.

347
0:19:06.96,000 --> 0:19:09,000
Every day I see my grandchildren, about the same age as these young girls,

348
0:19:10.72,000 --> 0:19:12,000
and I do wonder,

349
0:19:13.16,000 --> 0:19:15,000
and I get angry sometimes, yes I do.

350
0:19:15.4,000 --> 0:19:17,000
I wonder what is to become of them.

351
0:19:17.48,000 --> 0:19:2,000
And so it's about them

352
0:19:20.64,000 --> 0:19:22,000
that we should be telling everybody,

353
0:19:22.92,000 --> 0:19:24,000
that it's not about their own national interest,

354
0:19:25.2,000 --> 0:19:28,000
because climate change, regrettably, unfortunately,

355
0:19:28.88,000 --> 0:19:32,000
is viewed by many countries as a national problem. It's not.

356
0:19:33,000 --> 0:19:36,000
And this is the argument we got into recently with our partners,

357
0:19:36.024,000 --> 0:19:37,000
the Australians and New Zealanders,

358
0:19:37.744,000 --> 0:19:4,000
because they said, "We can't cut any more."

359
0:19:41.08,000 --> 0:19:44,000
This is what one of the leaders, the Australian leader, said,

360
0:19:44.72,000 --> 0:19:48,000
that we've done our part, we are cutting back.

361
0:19:49,000 --> 0:19:52,000
I said, What about the rest? Why don't you keep it?

362
0:19:52.68,000 --> 0:19:54,000
If you could keep the rest of your emissions

363
0:19:55.4,000 --> 0:19:57,000
within your boundaries, within your borders,

364
0:19:57.72,000 --> 0:19:58,000
we'd have no question.

365
0:19:59.52,000 --> 0:20:,000
You can go ahead as much as you like.

366
0:20:01.36,000 --> 0:20:03,000
But unfortunately, you're sending it our way,

367
0:20:03.52,000 --> 0:20:05,000
and it's affecting the future of our children.

368
0:20:05.735,000 --> 0:20:1,000
And so surely I think that is the heart of the problem of climate change today.

369
0:20:10.8,000 --> 0:20:13,000
We will be meeting in Paris at the end of this year,

370
0:20:13.88,000 --> 0:20:16,000
but until we can think of this as a global phenomenon,

371
0:20:17.84,000 --> 0:20:2,000
because we create it, individually, as nations,

372
0:20:21.12,000 --> 0:20:22,000
but it affects everybody else,

373
0:20:23.08,000 --> 0:20:26,000
and yet, we refuse to do anything about it,

374
0:20:26.72,000 --> 0:20:28,000
and we deal with it as a national problem,

375
0:20:29.2,000 --> 0:20:31,000
which it is not -- it is a global issue,

376
0:20:31.32,000 --> 0:20:33,000
and it's got to be dealt with collectively.

377
0:20:35.12,000 --> 0:20:39,000
CA: People are incredibly bad at responding to graphs and numbers,

378
0:20:39.48,000 --> 0:20:42,000
and we shut our minds to it.

379
0:20:43.28,000 --> 0:20:49,000
Somehow, to people, we're slightly better at responding to that sometimes.

380
0:20:49.56,000 --> 0:20:51,000
And it seems like it's very possible that your nation,

381
0:20:52.52,000 --> 0:20:56,000
despite, actually because of the intense problems you face,

382
0:20:57,000 --> 0:21:01,000
you may yet be the warning light to the world that shines most visibly,

383
0:21:01.92,000 --> 0:21:02,000
most powerfully.

384
0:21:03.92,000 --> 0:21:05,000
I just want to thank you, I'm sure, on behalf of all of us,

385
0:21:06.762,000 --> 0:21:08,000
for your extraordinary leadership and for being here.

386
0:21:09.28,000 --> 0:21:1,000
Mr. President, thank you so much.

387
0:21:10.873,000 --> 0:21:1,000
AT: Thank you.

388
0:21:11.666,000 --> 0:21:13,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
If I could reveal anything

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that is hidden from us,

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
at least in modern cultures,

4
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
it would be to reveal something that we've forgotten,

5
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
that we used to know

6
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
as well as we knew our own names.

7
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And that is that we live in a competent universe,

8
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that we are part of a brilliant planet,

9
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and that we are surrounded by genius.

10
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Biomimicry is a new discipline

11
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that tries to learn from those geniuses,

12
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and take advice from them, design advice.

13
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
That's where I live,

14
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and it's my university as well.

15
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I'm surrounded by genius. I cannot help but

16
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
remember the organisms and the ecosystems

17
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
that know how to live here gracefully on this planet.

18
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
This is what I would tell you to remember

19
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
if you ever forget this again.

20
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Remember this.

21
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
This is what happens every year.

22
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
This is what keeps its promise.

23
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
While we're doing bailouts, this is what happened.

24
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Spring.

25
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Imagine designing spring.

26
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Imagine that orchestration.

27
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
You think TED is hard to organize. (Laughter) Right?

28
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Imagine, and if you haven't done this in a while, do.

29
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Imagine the timing, the coordination,

30
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
all without top-down laws,

31
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
or policies, or climate change protocols.

32
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
This happens every year.

33
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
There is lots of showing off.

34
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
There is lots of love in the air.

35
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
There's lots of grand openings.

36
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And the organisms, I promise you,

37
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
have all of their priorities in order.

38
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I have this neighbor that keeps me in touch with this,

39
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
because he's living, usually on his back,

40
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
looking up at those grasses.

41
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And one time he came up to me --

42
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
he was about seven or eight years old -- he came up to me.

43
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And there was a wasp's nest

44
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that I had let grow in my yard,

45
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
right outside my door.

46
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And most people knock them down when they're small.

47
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
But it was fascinating to me,

48
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
because I was looking at this sort of fine Italian end papers.

49
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And he came up to me and he knocked.

50
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
He would come every day with something to show me.

51
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And like, knock like a woodpecker on my door until I opened it up.

52
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And he asked me

53
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
how I had made the house for those wasps,

54
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
because he had never seen one this big.

55
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And I told him, "You know, Cody,

56
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
the wasps actually made that."

57
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And we looked at it together.

58
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And I could see why he thought,

59
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
you know -- it was so beautifully done.

60
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
It was so architectural. It was so precise.

61
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
But it occurred to me, how in his small life

62
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
had he already believed the myth

63
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that if something was that well done,

64
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that we must have done it.

65
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
How did he not know --

66
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
it's what we've all forgotten --

67
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
that we're not the first ones to build.

68
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
We're not the first ones to process cellulose.

69
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
We're not the first ones to make paper. We're not the first ones

70
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
to try to optimize packing space,

71
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
or to waterproof, or to try to heat and cool a structure.

72
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
We're not the first ones to build houses for our young.

73
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
What's happening now, in this field called biomimicry,

74
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
is that people are beginning to remember

75
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
that organisms, other organisms,

76
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
the rest of the natural world,

77
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
are doing things very similar to what we need to do.

78
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
But in fact they are doing them in a way

79
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that have allowed them to live gracefully on this planet

80
0:04:33.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
for billions of years.

81
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So these people, biomimics,

82
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
are nature's apprentices.

83
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And they're focusing on function.

84
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
What I'd like to do is show you a few of the things

85
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that they're learning.

86
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
They have asked themselves,

87
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
"What if, every time I started to invent something,

88
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I asked, 'How would nature solve this?'"

89
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
And here is what they're learning.

90
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
This is an amazing picture from a Czech photographer named Jack Hedley.

91
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
This is a story about an engineer at J.R. West.

92
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
They're the people who make the bullet train.

93
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
It was called the bullet train

94
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
because it was rounded in front,

95
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
but every time it went into a tunnel

96
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
it would build up a pressure wave,

97
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and then it would create like a sonic boom when it exited.

98
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
So the engineer's boss said,

99
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
"Find a way to quiet this train."

100
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
He happened to be a birder.

101
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
He went to the equivalent of an Audubon Society meeting.

102
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And he studied -- there was a film about king fishers.

103
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And he thought to himself, "They go from one density of medium,

104
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
the air, into another density of medium, water,

105
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
without a splash. Look at this picture.

106
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Without a splash, so they can see the fish.

107
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And he thought, "What if we do this?"

108
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Quieted the train.

109
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Made it go 10 percent faster on 15 percent less electricity.

110
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
How does nature repel bacteria?

111
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
We're not the first ones to have to protect ourselves

112
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
from some bacteria.

113
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Turns out that -- this is a Galapagos Shark.

114
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
It has no bacteria on its surface, no fouling on its surface, no barnacles.

115
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And it's not because it goes fast.

116
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
It actually basks. It's a slow-moving shark.

117
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So how does it keep its body free of bacteria build-up?

118
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
It doesn't do it with a chemical.

119
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
It does it, it turns out, with the same denticles

120
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that you had on Speedo bathing suits,

121
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that broke all those records in the Olympics,

122
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
but it's a particular kind of pattern.

123
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And that pattern, the architecture of that pattern

124
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
on its skin denticles

125
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
keep bacteria from being able to land and adhere.

126
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
There is a company called Sharklet Technologies

127
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that's now putting this on the surfaces in hospitals

128
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
to keep bacteria from landing,

129
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
which is better than dousing it with anti-bacterials or harsh cleansers

130
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
that many, many organisms are now becoming drug resistant.

131
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Hospital-acquired infections are now killing

132
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
more people every year in the United States

133
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
than die from AIDS or cancer or car accidents combined --

134
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
about 100,000.

135
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
This is a little critter that's in the Namibian desert.

136
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
It has no fresh water that it's able to drink,

137
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
but it drinks water out of fog.

138
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
It's got bumps on the back of its wing covers.

139
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And those bumps act like a magnet for water.

140
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
They have water-loving tips, and waxy sides.

141
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And the fog comes in and it builds up on the tips.

142
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And it goes down the sides and goes into the critter's mouth.

143
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
There is actually a scientist here at Oxford

144
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
who studied this, Andrew Parker.

145
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And now kinetic and architectural firms like Grimshaw

146
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
are starting to look at this as a way

147
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
of coating buildings

148
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
so that they gather water from the fog.

149
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
10 times better than our fog-catching nets.

150
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
CO2 as a building block.

151
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Organisms don't think of CO2 as a poison.

152
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Plants and organisms that make shells,

153
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
coral, think of it as a building block.

154
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
There is now a cement manufacturing company

155
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
starting in the United States called Calera.

156
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
They've borrowed the recipe from the coral reef,

157
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and they're using CO2 as a building block

158
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
in cement, in concrete.

159
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Instead of -- cement usually

160
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
emits a ton of CO2 for every ton of cement.

161
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Now it's reversing that equation,

162
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and actually sequestering half a ton of CO2

163
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
thanks to the recipe from the coral.

164
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
None of these are using the organisms.

165
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
They're really only using the blueprints or the recipes

166
0:08:36.33,000 --> 0:08:39,000
from the organisms.

167
0:08:39.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
How does nature gather the sun's energy?

168
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
This is a new kind of solar cell

169
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
that's based on how a leaf works.

170
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
It's self-assembling.

171
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
It can be put down on any substrate whatsoever.

172
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
It's extremely inexpensive

173
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and rechargeable every five years.

174
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
It's actually a company a company that I'm involved in called OneSun,

175
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
with Paul Hawken.

176
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
There are many many ways that nature filters water

177
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
that takes salt out of water.

178
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
We take water and push it against a membrane.

179
0:09:10.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And then we wonder why the membrane clogs

180
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and why it takes so much electricity.

181
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Nature does something much more elegant.

182
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And it's in every cell.

183
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Every red blood cell of your body right now

184
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
has these hourglass-shaped pores

185
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
called aquaporins.

186
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
They actually export water molecules through.

187
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
It's kind of a forward osmosis.

188
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
They export water molecules through,

189
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and leave solutes on the other side.

190
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
A company called Aquaporin is starting to make desalination

191
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
membranes mimicking this technology.

192
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Trees and bones are constantly reforming themselves

193
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
along lines of stress.

194
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
This algorithm has been put into a software program

195
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
that's now being used to make bridges lightweight,

196
0:09:55.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
to make building beams lightweight.

197
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
Actually G.M. Opel used it

198
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
to create that skeleton you see,

199
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
in what's called their bionic car.

200
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
It lightweighted that skeleton using a minimum amount of material,

201
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
as an organism must,

202
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:17,000
for the maximum amount of strength.

203
0:10:17.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
This beetle, unlike this chip bag here,

204
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
this beetle uses one material, chitin.

205
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And it finds many many ways

206
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
to put many functions into it.

207
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
It's waterproof.

208
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:32,000
It's strong and resilient.

209
0:10:32.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
It's breathable. It creates color through structure.

210
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Whereas that chip bag has about seven layers to do all of those things.

211
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
One of our major inventions

212
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
that we need to be able to do

213
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
to come even close to what these organisms can do

214
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
is to find a way

215
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
to minimize the amount of material, the kind of material we use,

216
0:10:54.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and to add design to it.

217
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
We use five polymers in the natural world

218
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
to do everything that you see.

219
0:11:01.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
In our world we use about 350 polymers

220
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
to make all this.

221
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Nature is nano.

222
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Nanotechnology, nanoparticles, you hear a lot of worry about this.

223
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Loose nanoparticles. What is really interesting to me

224
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
is that not many people have been asking,

225
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
"How can we consult nature about how to make nanotechnology safe?"

226
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Nature has been doing that for a long time.

227
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Embedding nanoparticles in a material for instance, always.

228
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
In fact, sulfur-reducing bacteria,

229
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
as part of their synthesis,

230
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:42,000
they will emit, as a byproduct,

231
0:11:42.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
nanoparticles into the water.

232
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
But then right after that, they emit a protein

233
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
that actually gathers and aggregates those nanoparticles

234
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:54,000
so that they fall out of solution.

235
0:11:54.33,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Energy use. Organisms sip energy,

236
0:11:59.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
because they have to work or barter for every single bit that they get.

237
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And one of the largest fields right now,

238
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:09,000
in the world of energy grids,

239
0:12:09.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
you hear about the smart grid.

240
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
One of the largest consultants are the social insects.

241
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Swarm technology. There is a company called Regen.

242
0:12:18.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
They are looking at how ants and bees

243
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
find their food and their flowers

244
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
in the most effective way

245
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
as a whole hive.

246
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And they're having appliances in your home

247
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
talk to one another through that algorithm,

248
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and determine how to minimize peak power use.

249
0:12:40.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
There's a group of scientists in Cornell

250
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
that are making what they call a synthetic tree,

251
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:49,000
because they are saying, "There is no pump at the bottom of a tree."

252
0:12:49.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
It's capillary action and transpiration pulls

253
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:55,000
water up, a drop at a time,

254
0:12:55.33,000 --> 0:13:,000
pulling it, releasing it from a leaf and pulling it up through the roots.

255
0:13:00.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And they're creating -- you can think of it as a kind of wallpaper.

256
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
They're thinking about putting it on the insides of buildings

257
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
to move water up without pumps.

258
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Amazon electric eel -- incredibly endangered,

259
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
some of these species --

260
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
create 600 volts of electricity

261
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:24,000
with the chemicals that are in your body.

262
0:13:24.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Even more interesting to me is that

263
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
600 volts doesn't fry it.

264
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:32,000
You know we use PVC, and we sheath wires

265
0:13:32.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
with PVC for insulation.

266
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
These organisms, how are they insulating

267
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:39,000
against their own electric charge?

268
0:13:39.33,000 --> 0:13:42,000
These are some questions that we've yet to ask.

269
0:13:42.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Here's a wind turbine manufacturer that went to a whale.

270
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Humpback whale has scalloped edges on its flippers.

271
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And those scalloped edges

272
0:13:52.33,000 --> 0:13:55,000
play with flow in such a way

273
0:13:55.33,000 --> 0:13:58,000
that is reduces drag by 32 percent.

274
0:13:58.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
These wind turbines can rotate in incredibly slow windspeeds, as a result.

275
0:14:04.33,000 --> 0:14:07,000
MIT just has a new radio chip

276
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
that uses far less power than our chips.

277
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And it's based on the cochlear of your ear,

278
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
able to pick up internet, wireless, television signals

279
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and radio signals, in the same chip.

280
0:14:22.33,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Finally, on an ecosystem scale.

281
0:14:26.33,000 --> 0:14:29,000
At Biomimicry Guild, which is my consulting company,

282
0:14:29.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
we work with HOK Architects.

283
0:14:31.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
We're looking at building whole cities

284
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
in their planning department.

285
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:39,000
And what we're saying is that,

286
0:14:39.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
shouldn't our cities do at least as well,

287
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
in terms of ecosystem services,

288
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:47,000
as the native systems that they replace?

289
0:14:47.33,000 --> 0:14:51,000
So we're creating something called Ecological Performance Standards

290
0:14:51.33,000 --> 0:14:55,000
that hold cities to this higher bar.

291
0:14:55.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
The question is -- biomimicry is an incredibly powerful

292
0:14:58.33,000 --> 0:15:01,000
way to innovate.

293
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:04,000
The question I would ask is, "What's worth solving?"

294
0:15:04.33,000 --> 0:15:06,000
If you haven't seen this, it's pretty amazing.

295
0:15:06.33,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Dr. Adam Neiman.

296
0:15:09.33,000 --> 0:15:11,000
This is a depiction of

297
0:15:11.33,000 --> 0:15:13,000
all of the water on Earth

298
0:15:13.33,000 --> 0:15:15,000
in relation to the volume of the Earth --

299
0:15:15.33,000 --> 0:15:18,000
all the ice, all the fresh water, all the sea water --

300
0:15:18.33,000 --> 0:15:22,000
and all the atmosphere that we can breathe, in relation to the volume of the Earth.

301
0:15:22.33,000 --> 0:15:24,000
And inside those balls

302
0:15:24.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
life, over 3.8 billion years,

303
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:33,000
has made a lush, livable place for us.

304
0:15:33.33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And we are in a long, long line

305
0:15:36.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
of organisms

306
0:15:38.33,000 --> 0:15:41,000
to come to this planet and ask ourselves,

307
0:15:41.33,000 --> 0:15:45,000
"How can we live here gracefully over the long haul?"

308
0:15:45.33,000 --> 0:15:5,000
How can we do what life has learned to do?

309
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Which is to create conditions conducive to life.

310
0:15:54.33,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Now in order to do this, the design challenge

311
0:15:58.33,000 --> 0:16:01,000
of our century, I think,

312
0:16:01.33,000 --> 0:16:06,000
we need a way to remind ourselves of those geniuses,

313
0:16:06.33,000 --> 0:16:09,000
and to somehow meet them again.

314
0:16:09.33,000 --> 0:16:11,000
One of the big ideas, one of the big projects

315
0:16:11.33,000 --> 0:16:13,000
I've been honored to work on

316
0:16:13.33,000 --> 0:16:16,000
is a new website. And I would encourage you all to please go to it.

317
0:16:16.33,000 --> 0:16:19,000
It's called AskNature.org.

318
0:16:19.33,000 --> 0:16:22,000
And what we're trying to do, in a TEDesque way,

319
0:16:22.33,000 --> 0:16:24,000
is to organize all biological information

320
0:16:24.33,000 --> 0:16:28,000
by design and engineering function.

321
0:16:28.33,000 --> 0:16:31,000
And we're working with EOL, Encyclopedia of Life,

322
0:16:31.33,000 --> 0:16:33,000
Ed Wilson's TED wish.

323
0:16:33.33,000 --> 0:16:36,000
And he's gathering all biological information

324
0:16:36.33,000 --> 0:16:38,000
on one website.

325
0:16:38.33,000 --> 0:16:41,000
And the scientists who are contributing to EOL are answering a question,

326
0:16:41.33,000 --> 0:16:44,000
"What can we learn from this organism?"

327
0:16:44.33,000 --> 0:16:48,000
And that information will go into AskNature.org.

328
0:16:48.33,000 --> 0:16:51,000
And hopefully, any inventor, anywhere in the world,

329
0:16:51.33,000 --> 0:16:54,000
will be able, in the moment of creation,

330
0:16:54.33,000 --> 0:16:59,000
to type in, "How does nature remove salt from water?"

331
0:16:59.33,000 --> 0:17:02,000
And up will come mangroves, and sea turtles

332
0:17:02.33,000 --> 0:17:04,000
and your own kidneys.

333
0:17:04.33,000 --> 0:17:07,000
And we'll begin to

334
0:17:07.33,000 --> 0:17:09,000
be able to

335
0:17:09.33,000 --> 0:17:11,000
do as Cody does,

336
0:17:11.33,000 --> 0:17:14,000
and actually be in touch

337
0:17:14.33,000 --> 0:17:17,000
with these incredible models,

338
0:17:17.33,000 --> 0:17:19,000
these elders that have been here

339
0:17:19.33,000 --> 0:17:21,000
far, far longer than we have.

340
0:17:21.33,000 --> 0:17:23,000
And hopefully, with their help,

341
0:17:23.33,000 --> 0:17:26,000
we'll learn how to live on this Earth,

342
0:17:26.33,000 --> 0:17:3,000
and on this home that is ours, but not ours alone.

343
0:17:30.33,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Thank you very much.

344
0:17:32.33,000 --> 0:17:37,000

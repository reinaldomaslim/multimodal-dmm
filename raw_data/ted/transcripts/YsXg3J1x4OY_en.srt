1
0:00:12.869,000 --> 0:00:16,000
It is often said that the stories of history are written by its victors,

2
0:00:17.144,000 --> 0:00:18,000
but if this is true,

3
0:00:18.48,000 --> 0:00:2,000
what becomes of the downtrodden,

4
0:00:20.552,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and how can they ever hope to aspire for something greater

5
0:00:23.354,000 --> 0:00:26,000
if they are never told the stories of their own glorious pasts?

6
0:00:27.705,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Ostensibly, I stand before you as a mere maker of clothing,

7
0:00:31.649,000 --> 0:00:34,000
but within the folds of ancient fabrics and modern textiles,

8
0:00:34.816,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I have found a higher calling.

9
0:00:37.411,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Through my work as a designer,

10
0:00:38.944,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I've discovered the importance of providing representation

11
0:00:42.071,000 --> 0:00:44,000
for the marginalized members of our society,

12
0:00:45.037,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and the importance of telling the most vulnerable among us

13
0:00:48.354,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that they no longer have to compromise themselves

14
0:00:50.787,000 --> 0:00:52,000
just so they can fit in with an uncompromising majority.

15
0:00:54.505,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It turns out that fashion,

16
0:00:56.123,000 --> 0:00:58,000
a discipline many of us consider to be trivial,

17
0:00:58.617,000 --> 0:01:01,000
can actually be a powerful tool for dismantling bias

18
0:01:02.054,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and bolstering the self-images of underrepresented populations.

19
0:01:06.833,000 --> 0:01:09,000
My interest in using design as a vehicle for social change

20
0:01:10.119,000 --> 0:01:11,000
happens to be a personal one.

21
0:01:12.156,000 --> 0:01:15,000
As a Nigerian American, I know how easily the term "African"

22
0:01:15.358,000 --> 0:01:18,000
can slip from being an ordinary geographic descriptor

23
0:01:18.644,000 --> 0:01:19,000
to becoming a pejorative.

24
0:01:21.686,000 --> 0:01:23,000
For those of us from this beautiful continent,

25
0:01:24.211,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to be African is to be inspired by culture

26
0:01:27.218,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and to be filled with undying hope for the future.

27
0:01:30.647,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So in an attempt to shift the misguided perceptions that many have

28
0:01:35.252,000 --> 0:01:36,000
about the place of my birth,

29
0:01:36.951,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I use design as a means to tell stories,

30
0:01:39.871,000 --> 0:01:4,000
stories about joy,

31
0:01:41.433,000 --> 0:01:42,000
stories about triumph,

32
0:01:42.9,000 --> 0:01:45,000
stories about perseverance all throughout the African diaspora.

33
0:01:46.58,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I tell these stories

34
0:01:47.906,000 --> 0:01:5,000
as a concerted effort to correct the historical record,

35
0:01:51.279,000 --> 0:01:53,000
because, no matter where any of us is from,

36
0:01:54.252,000 --> 0:01:56,000
each of us has been touched by the complicated histories

37
0:01:56.902,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that brought our families to a foreign land.

38
0:01:59.728,000 --> 0:02:01,000
These histories shape the way we view the world,

39
0:02:02.636,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and they mold the biases we carry around with us.

40
0:02:06.029,000 --> 0:02:07,000
To combat these biases,

41
0:02:07.815,000 --> 0:02:09,000
my work draws aesthetics from different parts of the globe

42
0:02:10.562,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and crafts a narrative about the importance

43
0:02:12.587,000 --> 0:02:13,000
of fighting for inclusivity.

44
0:02:15.217,000 --> 0:02:17,000
By refashioning images from classic European art

45
0:02:18.099,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and marrying them with African aesthetics,

46
0:02:20.259,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I am able to recast people of color in roles of prominence,

47
0:02:23.822,000 --> 0:02:24,000
providing them with a degree of dignity

48
0:02:25.76,000 --> 0:02:26,000
they didn't have in earlier times.

49
0:02:29.015,000 --> 0:02:33,000
This approach subverts the historically accepted narrative of African inferiority,

50
0:02:33.523,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and it serves as inspiration for people of color

51
0:02:36.056,000 --> 0:02:39,000
who have grown wary of seeing themselves depicted without sophistication

52
0:02:39.501,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and without grace.

53
0:02:42.072,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Each of these culture-bending tapestries

54
0:02:44.255,000 --> 0:02:45,000
becomes a tailored garment

55
0:02:46.264,000 --> 0:02:49,000
or a silk scarf, like the one I am very coincidentally wearing right now.

56
0:02:50.225,000 --> 0:02:51,000
(Laughter)

57
0:02:51.691,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And even when surrounded in a structure of European classicism,

58
0:02:55.033,000 --> 0:02:58,000
these narratives boldly extoll the merits of African empowerment.

59
0:02:59.798,000 --> 0:03:03,000
In this way, the tools of the masters become masterworks

60
0:03:04.648,000 --> 0:03:06,000
to celebrate those who were once subservient.

61
0:03:09.014,000 --> 0:03:11,000
This metaphor extends beyond the realm of art

62
0:03:11.265,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and out into the real world.

63
0:03:13.169,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Whether worn by refugees or world-changing entrepreneurs,

64
0:03:16.98,000 --> 0:03:18,000
when people are allowed the freedom to present themselves

65
0:03:19.671,000 --> 0:03:21,000
in a manner that celebrates their own unique identities,

66
0:03:22.512,000 --> 0:03:23,000
a magical thing happens.

67
0:03:24.312,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We stand taller.

68
0:03:25.708,000 --> 0:03:26,000
We're more proud and self-aware

69
0:03:27.305,000 --> 0:03:29,000
because we're presenting our true, authentic selves.

70
0:03:30.62,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And those of us who are around them in turn become more educated,

71
0:03:34.288,000 --> 0:03:37,000
more open and more tolerant of their different points of view.

72
0:03:38.809,000 --> 0:03:4,000
In this way, the clothes that we wear

73
0:03:41.245,000 --> 0:03:44,000
can be a great illustration of diplomatic soft power.

74
0:03:45.709,000 --> 0:03:47,000
The clothes that we wear can serve as bridges

75
0:03:47.876,000 --> 0:03:49,000
between our seemingly disparate cultures.

76
0:03:50.461,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And so, yeah, ostensibly I stand before you as a mere maker of clothing.

77
0:03:56.786,000 --> 0:03:58,000
But my work has always been about more than fashion.

78
0:04:00.024,000 --> 0:04:02,000
It has become my purpose to rewrite the cultural narratives

79
0:04:02.811,000 --> 0:04:05,000
so that people of color can be seen in a new and nuanced light,

80
0:04:06.827,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and so that we,

81
0:04:08.066,000 --> 0:04:1,000
the proud children of sub-Saharan Africa,

82
0:04:10.122,000 --> 0:04:11,000
can traverse the globe

83
0:04:11.844,000 --> 0:04:12,000
while carrying ourselves with pride.

84
0:04:14.767,000 --> 0:04:16,000
It was indeed true that the stories of history

85
0:04:17.182,000 --> 0:04:2,000
were told by its old victors,

86
0:04:20.552,000 --> 0:04:21,000
but I am of a new generation.

87
0:04:23.472,000 --> 0:04:24,000
My work speaks for those

88
0:04:24.936,000 --> 0:04:27,000
who will no longer let their futures be dictated by a troubled past.

89
0:04:28.473,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Today, we stand ready to tell our own stories

90
0:04:32.052,000 --> 0:04:34,000
without compromise, without apologies.

91
0:04:35.402,000 --> 0:04:36,000
But the question still remains:

92
0:04:37.957,000 --> 0:04:39,000
are you prepared for what you are about to hear?

93
0:04:42.981,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I hope you are, because we are coming regardless.

94
0:04:46.622,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Applause)

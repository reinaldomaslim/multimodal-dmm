1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
The universe

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
is really big.

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
We live in a galaxy, the Milky Way Galaxy.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
There are about a hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And if you take a camera

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and you point it at a random part of the sky,

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and you just keep the shutter open,

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
as long as your camera is attached to the Hubble Space Telescope,

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
it will see something like this.

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Every one of these little blobs

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
is a galaxy roughly the size of our Milky Way --

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
a hundred billion stars in each of those blobs.

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
There are approximately a hundred billion galaxies

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
in the observable universe.

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
100 billion is the only number you need to know.

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
The age of the universe, between now and the Big Bang,

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
is a hundred billion in dog years.

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
(Laughter)

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Which tells you something about our place in the universe.

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
One thing you can do with a picture like this is simply admire it.

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
It's extremely beautiful.

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I've often wondered, what is the evolutionary pressure

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that made our ancestors in the Veldt adapt and evolve

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
to really enjoy pictures of galaxies

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
when they didn't have any.

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
But we would also like to understand it.

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
As a cosmologist, I want to ask, why is the universe like this?

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
One big clue we have is that the universe is changing with time.

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
If you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity,

30
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
it would be moving away from you.

31
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And if you look at a galaxy even farther away,

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
it would be moving away faster.

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So we say the universe is expanding.

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
What that means, of course, is that, in the past,

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
things were closer together.

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
In the past, the universe was more dense,

37
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and it was also hotter.

38
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
If you squeeze things together, the temperature goes up.

39
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
That kind of makes sense to us.

40
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
The thing that doesn't make sense to us as much

41
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
is that the universe, at early times, near the Big Bang,

42
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
was also very, very smooth.

43
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
You might think that that's not a surprise.

44
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
The air in this room is very smooth.

45
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
You might say, "Well, maybe things just smoothed themselves out."

46
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
But the conditions near the Big Bang are very, very different

47
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
than the conditions of the air in this room.

48
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
In particular, things were a lot denser.

49
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
The gravitational pull of things

50
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
was a lot stronger near the Big Bang.

51
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
What you have to think about

52
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies,

53
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
a hundred billion stars each.

54
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
At early times, those hundred billion galaxies

55
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
were squeezed into a region about this big --

56
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
literally -- at early times.

57
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And you have to imagine doing that squeezing

58
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
without any imperfections,

59
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
without any little spots

60
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
where there were a few more atoms than somewhere else.

61
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Because if there had been, they would have collapsed under the gravitational pull

62
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
into a huge black hole.

63
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Keeping the universe very, very smooth at early times

64
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
is not easy; it's a delicate arrangement.

65
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
It's a clue

66
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that the early universe is not chosen randomly.

67
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
There is something that made it that way.

68
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
We would like to know what.

69
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So part of our understanding of this was given to us by Ludwig Boltzmann,

70
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
an Austrian physicist in the 19th century.

71
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And Boltzmann's contribution was that he helped us understand entropy.

72
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
You've heard of entropy.

73
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
It's the randomness, the disorder, the chaoticness of some systems.

74
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Boltzmann gave us a formula --

75
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
engraved on his tombstone now --

76
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
that really quantifies what entropy is.

77
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And it's basically just saying

78
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that entropy is the number of ways

79
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
we can rearrange the constituents of a system so that you don't notice,

80
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
so that macroscopically it looks the same.

81
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
If you have the air in this room,

82
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
you don't notice each individual atom.

83
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
A low entropy configuration

84
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
is one in which there's only a few arrangements that look that way.

85
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
A high entropy arrangement

86
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
is one that there are many arrangements that look that way.

87
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
This is a crucially important insight

88
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
because it helps us explain

89
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
the second law of thermodynamics --

90
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
the law that says that entropy increases in the universe,

91
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
or in some isolated bit of the universe.

92
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
The reason why entropy increases

93
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
is simply because there are many more ways

94
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
to be high entropy than to be low entropy.

95
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
That's a wonderful insight,

96
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
but it leaves something out.

97
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
This insight that entropy increases, by the way,

98
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
is what's behind what we call the arrow of time,

99
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
the difference between the past and the future.

100
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Every difference that there is

101
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
between the past and the future

102
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
is because entropy is increasing --

103
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
the fact that you can remember the past, but not the future.

104
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
The fact that you are born, and then you live, and then you die,

105
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
always in that order,

106
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that's because entropy is increasing.

107
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Boltzmann explained that if you start with low entropy,

108
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
it's very natural for it to increase

109
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
because there's more ways to be high entropy.

110
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
What he didn't explain

111
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
was why the entropy was ever low in the first place.

112
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
The fact that the entropy of the universe was low

113
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
was a reflection of the fact

114
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
that the early universe was very, very smooth.

115
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
We'd like to understand that.

116
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
That's our job as cosmologists.

117
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Unfortunately, it's actually not a problem

118
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that we've been giving enough attention to.

119
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It's not one of the first things people would say,

120
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
if you asked a modern cosmologist,

121
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
"What are the problems we're trying to address?"

122
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
One of the people who did understand that this was a problem

123
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
was Richard Feynman.

124
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
50 years ago, he gave a series of a bunch of different lectures.

125
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
He gave the popular lectures

126
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
that became "The Character of Physical Law."

127
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
He gave lectures to Caltech undergrads

128
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
that became "The Feynman Lectures on Physics."

129
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
He gave lectures to Caltech graduate students

130
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that became "The Feynman Lectures on Gravitation."

131
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
In every one of these books, every one of these sets of lectures,

132
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
he emphasized this puzzle:

133
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Why did the early universe have such a small entropy?

134
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So he says -- I'm not going to do the accent --

135
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
he says, "For some reason, the universe, at one time,

136
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
had a very low entropy for its energy content,

137
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and since then the entropy has increased.

138
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
The arrow of time cannot be completely understood

139
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
until the mystery of the beginnings of the history of the universe

140
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
are reduced still further

141
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
from speculation to understanding."

142
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So that's our job.

143
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
We want to know -- this is 50 years ago, "Surely," you're thinking,

144
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
"we've figured it out by now."

145
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
It's not true that we've figured it out by now.

146
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
The reason the problem has gotten worse,

147
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
rather than better,

148
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
is because in 1998

149
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
we learned something crucial about the universe that we didn't know before.

150
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
We learned that it's accelerating.

151
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
The universe is not only expanding.

152
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
If you look at the galaxy, it's moving away.

153
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
If you come back a billion years later and look at it again,

154
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
it will be moving away faster.

155
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Individual galaxies are speeding away from us faster and faster

156
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
so we say the universe is accelerating.

157
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Unlike the low entropy of the early universe,

158
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
even though we don't know the answer for this,

159
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
we at least have a good theory that can explain it,

160
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
if that theory is right,

161
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and that's the theory of dark energy.

162
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
It's just the idea that empty space itself has energy.

163
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
In every little cubic centimeter of space,

164
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
whether or not there's stuff,

165
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
whether or not there's particles, matter, radiation or whatever,

166
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
there's still energy, even in the space itself.

167
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And this energy, according to Einstein,

168
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
exerts a push on the universe.

169
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
It is a perpetual impulse

170
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that pushes galaxies apart from each other.

171
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Because dark energy, unlike matter or radiation,

172
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
does not dilute away as the universe expands.

173
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
The amount of energy in each cubic centimeter

174
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
remains the same,

175
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
even as the universe gets bigger and bigger.

176
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
This has crucial implications

177
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
for what the universe is going to do in the future.

178
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
For one thing, the universe will expand forever.

179
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Back when I was your age,

180
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
we didn't know what the universe was going to do.

181
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Some people thought that the universe would recollapse in the future.

182
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Einstein was fond of this idea.

183
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
But if there's dark energy, and the dark energy does not go away,

184
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
the universe is just going to keep expanding forever and ever and ever.

185
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
14 billion years in the past,

186
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
100 billion dog years,

187
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
but an infinite number of years into the future.

188
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Meanwhile, for all intents and purposes,

189
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
space looks finite to us.

190
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Space may be finite or infinite,

191
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
but because the universe is accelerating,

192
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
there are parts of it we cannot see

193
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and never will see.

194
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
There's a finite region of space that we have access to,

195
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
surrounded by a horizon.

196
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So even though time goes on forever,

197
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
space is limited to us.

198
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Finally, empty space has a temperature.

199
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
In the 1970s, Stephen Hawking told us

200
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that a black hole, even though you think it's black,

201
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
it actually emits radiation

202
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
when you take into account quantum mechanics.

203
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
The curvature of space-time around the black hole

204
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
brings to life the quantum mechanical fluctuation,

205
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and the black hole radiates.

206
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
A precisely similar calculation by Hawking and Gary Gibbons

207
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
showed that if you have dark energy in empty space,

208
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
then the whole universe radiates.

209
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
The energy of empty space

210
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
brings to life quantum fluctuations.

211
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And so even though the universe will last forever,

212
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and ordinary matter and radiation will dilute away,

213
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
there will always be some radiation,

214
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
some thermal fluctuations,

215
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
even in empty space.

216
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
So what this means

217
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
is that the universe is like a box of gas

218
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
that lasts forever.

219
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Well what is the implication of that?

220
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
That implication was studied by Boltzmann back in the 19th century.

221
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
He said, well, entropy increases

222
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
because there are many, many more ways

223
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
for the universe to be high entropy, rather than low entropy.

224
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
But that's a probabilistic statement.

225
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
It will probably increase,

226
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and the probability is enormously huge.

227
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
It's not something you have to worry about --

228
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
the air in this room all gathering over one part of the room and suffocating us.

229
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
It's very, very unlikely.

230
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Except if they locked the doors

231
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and kept us here literally forever,

232
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
that would happen.

233
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Everything that is allowed,

234
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
every configuration that is allowed to be obtained by the molecules in this room,

235
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
would eventually be obtained.

236
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
So Boltzmann says, look, you could start with a universe

237
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
that was in thermal equilibrium.

238
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
He didn't know about the Big Bang. He didn't know about the expansion of the universe.

239
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
He thought that space and time were explained by Isaac Newton --

240
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
they were absolute; they just stuck there forever.

241
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So his idea of a natural universe

242
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
was one in which the air molecules were just spread out evenly everywhere --

243
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
the everything molecules.

244
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
But if you're Boltzmann, you know that if you wait long enough,

245
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
the random fluctuations of those molecules

246
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
will occasionally bring them

247
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
into lower entropy configurations.

248
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And then, of course, in the natural course of things,

249
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
they will expand back.

250
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
So it's not that entropy must always increase --

251
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
you can get fluctuations into lower entropy,

252
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
more organized situations.

253
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Well if that's true,

254
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
Boltzmann then goes onto invent

255
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
two very modern-sounding ideas --

256
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
the multiverse and the anthropic principle.

257
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
He says, the problem with thermal equilibrium

258
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
is that we can't live there.

259
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Remember, life itself depends on the arrow of time.

260
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
We would not be able to process information,

261
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
metabolize, walk and talk,

262
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
if we lived in thermal equilibrium.

263
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So if you imagine a very, very big universe,

264
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
an infinitely big universe,

265
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
with randomly bumping into each other particles,

266
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
there will occasionally be small fluctuations in the lower entropy states,

267
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and then they relax back.

268
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
But there will also be large fluctuations.

269
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Occasionally, you will make a planet

270
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
or a star or a galaxy

271
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
or a hundred billion galaxies.

272
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
So Boltzmann says,

273
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
we will only live in the part of the multiverse,

274
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
in the part of this infinitely big set of fluctuating particles,

275
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
where life is possible.

276
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
That's the region where entropy is low.

277
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Maybe our universe is just one of those things

278
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
that happens from time to time.

279
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Now your homework assignment

280
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
is to really think about this, to contemplate what it means.

281
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
Carl Sagan once famously said

282
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
that "in order to make an apple pie,

283
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
you must first invent the universe."

284
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
But he was not right.

285
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
In Boltzmann's scenario, if you want to make an apple pie,

286
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
you just wait for the random motion of atoms

287
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
to make you an apple pie.

288
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
That will happen much more frequently

289
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
than the random motions of atoms

290
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
making you an apple orchard

291
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and some sugar and an oven,

292
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and then making you an apple pie.

293
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
So this scenario makes predictions.

294
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And the predictions are

295
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
that the fluctuations that make us are minimal.

296
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Even if you imagine that this room we are in now

297
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
exists and is real and here we are,

298
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and we have, not only our memories,

299
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
but our impression that outside there's something

300
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
called Caltech and the United States and the Milky Way Galaxy,

301
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
it's much easier for all those impressions to randomly fluctuate into your brain

302
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
than for them actually to randomly fluctuate

303
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
into Caltech, the United States and the galaxy.

304
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
The good news is that,

305
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
therefore, this scenario does not work; it is not right.

306
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
This scenario predicts that we should be a minimal fluctuation.

307
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Even if you left our galaxy out,

308
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
you would not get a hundred billion other galaxies.

309
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And Feynman also understood this.

310
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Feynman says, "From the hypothesis that the world is a fluctuation,

311
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
all the predictions are that

312
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
if we look at a part of the world we've never seen before,

313
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
we will find it mixed up, and not like the piece we've just looked at --

314
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
high entropy.

315
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
If our order were due to a fluctuation,

316
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
we would not expect order anywhere but where we have just noticed it.

317
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
We therefore conclude the universe is not a fluctuation."

318
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
So that's good. The question is then what is the right answer?

319
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
If the universe is not a fluctuation,

320
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
why did the early universe have a low entropy?

321
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And I would love to tell you the answer, but I'm running out of time.

322
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
(Laughter)

323
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Here is the universe that we tell you about,

324
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
versus the universe that really exists.

325
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
I just showed you this picture.

326
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
The universe is expanding for the last 10 billion years or so.

327
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
It's cooling off.

328
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
But we now know enough about the future of the universe

329
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
to say a lot more.

330
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
If the dark energy remains around,

331
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
the stars around us will use up their nuclear fuel, they will stop burning.

332
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
They will fall into black holes.

333
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
We will live in a universe

334
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
with nothing in it but black holes.

335
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
That universe will last 10 to the 100 years --

336
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
a lot longer than our little universe has lived.

337
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
The future is much longer than the past.

338
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
But even black holes don't last forever.

339
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
They will evaporate,

340
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and we will be left with nothing but empty space.

341
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
That empty space lasts essentially forever.

342
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
However, you notice, since empty space gives off radiation,

343
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
there's actually thermal fluctuations,

344
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and it cycles around

345
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
all the different possible combinations

346
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
of the degrees of freedom that exist in empty space.

347
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
So even though the universe lasts forever,

348
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
there's only a finite number of things

349
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
that can possibly happen in the universe.

350
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
They all happen over a period of time

351
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
equal to 10 to the 10 to the 120 years.

352
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
So here's two questions for you.

353
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Number one: If the universe lasts for 10 to the 10 to the 120 years,

354
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
why are we born

355
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
in the first 14 billion years of it,

356
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
in the warm, comfortable afterglow of the Big Bang?

357
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Why aren't we in empty space?

358
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
You might say, "Well there's nothing there to be living,"

359
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
but that's not right.

360
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
You could be a random fluctuation out of the nothingness.

361
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Why aren't you?

362
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
More homework assignment for you.

363
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
So like I said, I don't actually know the answer.

364
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
I'm going to give you my favorite scenario.

365
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Either it's just like that. There is no explanation.

366
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
This is a brute fact about the universe

367
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
that you should learn to accept and stop asking questions.

368
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Or maybe the Big Bang

369
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
is not the beginning of the universe.

370
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
An egg, an unbroken egg, is a low entropy configuration,

371
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and yet, when we open our refrigerator,

372
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
we do not go, "Hah, how surprising to find

373
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
this low entropy configuration in our refrigerator."

374
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
That's because an egg is not a closed system;

375
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
it comes out of a chicken.

376
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Maybe the universe comes out of a universal chicken.

377
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Maybe there is something that naturally,

378
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
through the growth of the laws of physics,

379
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
gives rise to universe like ours

380
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
in low entropy configurations.

381
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
If that's true, it would happen more than once;

382
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
we would be part of a much bigger multiverse.

383
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
That's my favorite scenario.

384
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
So the organizers asked me to end with a bold speculation.

385
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
My bold speculation

386
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
is that I will be absolutely vindicated by history.

387
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
And 50 years from now,

388
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
all of my current wild ideas will be accepted as truths

389
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
by the scientific and external communities.

390
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
We will all believe that our little universe

391
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
is just a small part of a much larger multiverse.

392
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
And even better, we will understand what happened at the Big Bang

393
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
in terms of a theory

394
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
that we will be able to compare to observations.

395
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
This is a prediction. I might be wrong.

396
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
But we've been thinking as a human race

397
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
about what the universe was like,

398
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
why it came to be in the way it did for many, many years.

399
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
It's exciting to think we may finally know the answer someday.

400
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Thank you.

401
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
(Applause)

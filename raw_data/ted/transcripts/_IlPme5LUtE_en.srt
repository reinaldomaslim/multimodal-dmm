1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I have a story, a story that I would like to share with you.

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And it's an African story.

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
It is a story of hope, resilience and glamour.

4
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
There was Hollywood.

5
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Then came Bollywood.

6
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Today we have Nollywood, the third-largest film industry in the world.

7
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
In 2006 alone, almost 2,000 films were made in Nigeria.

8
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Now, try to imagine 40, 50 films wrapped, distributed, every week

9
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
in the streets of Lagos, Nigeria and West Africa.

10
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Some estimates put the value of this industry at 250 million dollars.

11
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
It has created thousands, if not tens of thousands of jobs.

12
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And it's expanding.

13
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
But keep in mind that this was a grassroots movement.

14
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
This is something that happened without foreign investment,

15
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
without government aid, and actually, it happened against all odds,

16
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
in one of the most difficult moments in Nigerian economy.

17
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
The industry is 15 years old.

18
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And so maybe you're thinking now,

19
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
why, how, an Italian filmmaker based in Boston

20
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
is so interested in this story?

21
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And so I think I have to tell you just a few words,

22
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
a few things about my personal life,

23
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
because I think there is a connection.

24
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
My grandfather lived most of his life and is buried in Zambia.

25
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
My father also lived most of his adult life in East Africa.

26
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And I was born in Zambia.

27
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Even though I left when I was only three years old,

28
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I really felt that Africa was this big part of my life.

29
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And it really was a place where I learned to walk.

30
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I think I uttered the first words,

31
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and my family bought their first home.

32
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So when we came back to Italy,

33
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and one of the things that I remember the most

34
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
is my family having this hard time to share stories.

35
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
It seemed that for our neighbors and friends,

36
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Africa was either this exotic place, this imaginary land

37
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
that probably exists only in their imagination,

38
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
or the place of horror, famine.

39
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And so we were always caught in this stereotype.

40
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And I remember really this desire to talk about Africa

41
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
as a place where we lived and people live and go about their lives,

42
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and have dreams like we all have.

43
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So when I read in a newspaper in the business page

44
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
the story of Nollywood,

45
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I really felt this is an incredible opportunity to tell a story

46
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that goes against all these preconceived notions.

47
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Here I can tell a story of Africans making movies like I do,

48
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and actually I felt this was an inspiration for me.

49
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I have the good fortune of being a filmmaker-in-residence

50
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
at the Center of Digital Imaging Arts at Boston University.

51
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And we really look how digital technology is changing,

52
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and how young, independent filmmakers

53
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
can make movies at a fraction of the cost.

54
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So when I proposed the story,

55
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I really had all the support to make this film.

56
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And not only had the support,

57
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I found two wonderful partners in crime in this adventure.

58
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Aimee Corrigan, a very talented and young photographer,

59
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and Robert Caputo, a friend and a mentor,

60
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
who is a veteran of National Geographic,

61
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and told me, "You know, Franco, in 25 years of covering Africa,

62
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I don't know if I have come across a story

63
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that is so full of hope and so fun."

64
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So we went to Lagos in October 2005.

65
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And we went to Lagos to meet Bond Emeruwa,

66
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
a wonderful, talented film director who is with us tonight.

67
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
The plan was to give you a portrait of Nollywood,

68
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
of this incredible film industry,

69
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
following Bond in his quest to make an action movie

70
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
that deals with the issue of corruption,

71
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
called "Checkpoint."

72
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Police corruption.

73
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And he had nine days to make it.

74
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
We thought this was a good story.

75
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
In the meantime, we had to cover Nollywood,

76
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and we talked to a lot of filmmakers.

77
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
But I don't want to create too many expectations.

78
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I would like to show you six minutes.

79
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And these are six minutes they really prepared for the TED audience.

80
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
There are several themes from the documentary,

81
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
but they are re-edited and made for you, OK?

82
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
So I guess it's a world premier.

83
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
(Video)

84
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Man: Action.

85
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Milverton Nwokedi: You cut a nice movie with just 10,000 dollars in Nigeria here.

86
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And you shoot in seven days.

87
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Peace Piberesima: We're doing films for the masses.

88
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
We're not doing films for the elite

89
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and the people in their glass houses.

90
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
They can afford to watch their "Robocop" and whatever.

91
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Mahmood Ali Balogun: I think filmmaking in Nigeria, for those who work in it,

92
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
is a kind of subsistence filmmaking -- what they do to make a living.

93
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
It's not the fancy filmmaking where you say,

94
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
oh, you want to put all the razzmatazz of Hollywood,

95
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and where you have big budgets.

96
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Here is that you make these films,

97
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
it sells, you jump onto the location again to make another film,

98
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
because if you don't make the next film, you're not going to feed.

99
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Bond Emeruwa: So while we're entertaining, we should be able to educate.

100
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I believe in the power of audiovisuals.

101
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
I mean, 90 percent of the population will watch Nollywood.

102
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I think it's the most viable vehicle right now

103
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:05,000
to pass information across a dedicated cable.

104
0:07:05.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So if you're making a movie, no matter what your topic is,

105
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:1,000
put in a message in there.

106
0:07:10.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Woman: You still have to report the incident.

107
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
He needs proper medical attention.

108
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
PP: I keep trying to explain to people,

109
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
it's not about the quality at the moment -- the quality is coming.

110
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I mean, there are those films that people are making for quality,

111
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
but the first thing you have to remember about this society

112
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
is that Africa still has people that live on one dollar a day,

113
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and these are the people that really watch these films.

114
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Sonny McDon W: Nollywood is a fantastic industry

115
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
that has just been born in this part of the world.

116
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
Because nobody believed that Nollywood can come out of Africa.

117
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Lancelot Imasen: But our films,

118
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
they are stories that our people can relate to themselves.

119
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
They are stories about our people, for our people.

120
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And consistently, they are glued to their screen

121
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
whenever they see the story.

122
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Narrator: Suspense, fun and intrigue.

123
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
It's the blockbuster comedy.

124
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
You'll crack your ribs.

125
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Bernard Pinayon Agbaosi: We have been so deep into the foreign movies.

126
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
It's all about the foreign movies.

127
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:39,000
But we can do something too.

128
0:08:39.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
We can do something, something that when the world sees it,

129
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
they say, wow, this is Nigeria.

130
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Man: Just arrest yourself, sergeant.

131
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Don't embarrass yourself.

132
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Come on. Don't run away. Come back. Come back.

133
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
SMW: You can now walk the street and see a role model.

134
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
It’s not just what you see in picture.

135
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
You see the person live.

136
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
You see how he talks. You see how he lives.

137
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
He influences you really good, you know.

138
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
It’s not just what you see in the picture.

139
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
It is not what you hear, you know, from the Western press.

140
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Man: See you. Bye.

141
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Action.

142
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Saint Obi: I was so fascinated, you know, with those cowboy movies.

143
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
But then when I discovered the situation in my country,

144
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
at that time there was so much corruption.

145
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:43,000
For a young man to really make it out here,

146
0:09:43.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
you got to think of some negative things and all that,

147
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
or some kind of vices.

148
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And I didn't want that, you know.

149
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And I discovered that I could be successful in life as an actor,

150
0:09:57.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
without doing crime, without cheating nobody, without telling no lies.

151
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Just me and God-given talent.

152
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Man: Let's go.

153
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
OK, it's time to kick some ass.

154
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Cover this. It's your own.

155
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Move it.

156
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Roboger Animadu: In big countries, when they do the movies,

157
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
they have all these things in place.

158
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
But here, we improvise these items, like the gunshots.

159
0:10:35.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Like they go, here, now, now, you see the gun there,

160
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
but you won't see any guns shot, we use knock-out.

161
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Kevin Books Ikeduba: What I'm scared of is just the explosion will come up in my face.

162
0:10:44.33,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Woman: That's why I use enough masking tape.

163
0:10:46.33,000 --> 0:10:48,000
The masking tape will hold it.

164
0:10:48.33,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Wat, wait. Just hold this for me.

165
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
KBI: I'm just telling her to make sure she places it well

166
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
so that it won't affect my face -- the explosion, you know.

167
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
But she's a professional. She knows what she’s doing.

168
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
I'm trying to protect my face too.

169
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
This ain't going to be my last movie.

170
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
You know, this is Nollywood, where the magic lives.

171
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
RA: So now you're about to see how we do our own movies here,

172
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
with or without any assistance from anybody.

173
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Man: Action.

174
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Cut.

175
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
(Applause)

176
0:11:33.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Franco Sacchi: So many things to say, so little time.

177
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
So many themes in this story.

178
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
I just can't tell you -- there’s one thing I want to tell you.

179
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
I spent, you know, several weeks with all these actors, producers,

180
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and the problems they have to go through are unimaginable

181
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
for, you know, a Westerner, a filmmaker who works in America or in Europe.

182
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:56,000
But always with a smile, always with an enthusiasm,

183
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that is incredible.

184
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
Werner Herzog, the German filmmaker said,

185
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
"I need to make movies like you need oxygen."

186
0:12:05.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And I think they’re breathing.

187
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
The Nigerian filmmakers really, really, are doing what they like.

188
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And so it's a very, very important thing for them,

189
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and for their audiences.

190
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
A woman told me, "When I see a Nollywood film,

191
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:23,000
I can relax, I really -- I can breathe better."

192
0:12:23.33,000 --> 0:12:25,000
There is also another very important thing

193
0:12:25.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
that I hope will resonate with this audience.

194
0:12:27.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
It’s technology. I’m very interested in it

195
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and I really think that the digital non-linear editing has slashed, you know,

196
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
the cost now is a fraction of what it used to be.

197
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Incredible cameras cost under 5,000 dollars.

198
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And this has unleashed tremendous energy.

199
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And guess what?

200
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
We didn’t have to tell to the Nigerian filmmakers.

201
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
They understood it, they embraced the technology

202
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and they run with it, and they’re successful.

203
0:12:55.33,000 --> 0:13:,000
I hope that the Nollywood phenomenon will go both ways.

204
0:13:00.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
I hope it will inspire other African nations to embrace the technology,

205
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:08,000
look at the Nigerian model, make their films, create jobs,

206
0:13:08.33,000 --> 0:13:12,000
create a narrative for the population, something to identify,

207
0:13:12.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
something positive, something that really is psychological relief

208
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and it's part of the culture.

209
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:22,000
But I really think this is a phenomenon that can inspire us.

210
0:13:22.33,000 --> 0:13:24,000
I really think it goes both ways.

211
0:13:24.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Filmmakers, friends of mine, they look at Nollywood and they say,

212
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:3,000
"Wow, they are doing what we really want to do,

213
0:13:30.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and make a buck and live with this job."

214
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
So I really think it’s a lesson

215
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
that we're actually learning from them.

216
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And there's one thing, one small challenge that I have for you,

217
0:13:39.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and should make us reflect on the importance of storytelling.

218
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And I think this is really the theme of this session.

219
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Try to imagine a world where the only goal is food and a shelter, but no stories.

220
0:13:58.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
No stories around the campfire.

221
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
No legends, no fairytales.

222
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Nothing.

223
0:14:04.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
No novels.

224
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Difficult, eh? It's meaningless.

225
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
So this is what I really think.

226
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
I think that the key to a healthy society

227
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:2,000
is a thriving community of storytellers,

228
0:14:20.33,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and I think that the Nigerian filmmakers really have proved this.

229
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
I would like you to hear their voices.

230
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Just a few moments.

231
0:14:33.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
It’s not an added sequence, just some voices from Nollywood.

232
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
(Video) Toyin Alousa: Nollywood is the best thing that can happen to them.

233
0:14:40.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
If you have an industry that puts a smile on people's face,

234
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:46,000
that’s Nollywood.

235
0:14:46.33,000 --> 0:14:49,000
SO: I believe very soon, we’re not only going to have better movies,

236
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:52,000
we'll have that original Nigerian movie.

237
0:14:52.33,000 --> 0:14:54,000
BE: It’s still the same basic themes.

238
0:14:54.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
Love, action.

239
0:14:58.33,000 --> 0:15:03,000
But we're telling it our own way, our own Nigerian way, African way.

240
0:15:04.33,000 --> 0:15:09,000
We have diverse cultures, diverse cultures, there are so many,

241
0:15:09.33,000 --> 0:15:12,000
that in the natal lifetimes,

242
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:16,000
I don't see us exhausting the stories we have.

243
0:15:16.33,000 --> 0:15:23,000
FS: My job ends here, and the Nollywood filmmakers really have now to work.

244
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:26,000
And I really hope that there will be many, many collaborations,

245
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:3,000
where we teach each other things.

246
0:15:30.33,000 --> 0:15:33,000
And I really hope that this will happen.

247
0:15:33.33,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Thank you very much.

248
0:15:34.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
(Applause)

249
0:15:38.33,000 --> 0:15:42,000
Chris Anderson: Stop. I've got two questions.

250
0:15:42.33,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Franco, you described this as the world's third largest film industry.

251
0:15:47.33,000 --> 0:15:5,000
What does that translate to in terms of numbers of films, really?

252
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:54,000
FS: Oh, yes. I think I mentioned briefly -- it's close to 2,000 films.

253
0:15:54.33,000 --> 0:15:56,000
There is scientific data on this.

254
0:15:56.33,000 --> 0:15:58,000
CA: 2,000 films a year?

255
0:15:58.33,000 --> 0:16:01,000
FS: 2,000 films a year. 2005 or 6,

256
0:16:01.33,000 --> 0:16:07,000
the censor board has censored 1,600 films alone.

257
0:16:07.33,000 --> 0:16:09,000
And we know that there are more.

258
0:16:09.33,000 --> 0:16:11,000
So it’s safe to say that there are 2,000 films.

259
0:16:11.33,000 --> 0:16:13,000
So imagine 45 films per week.

260
0:16:13.33,000 --> 0:16:15,000
There are challenges. There are challenges.

261
0:16:15.33,000 --> 0:16:17,000
There is a glut of film,

262
0:16:17.33,000 --> 0:16:2,000
the quality has to be raised, they need to go to the next level,

263
0:16:20.33,000 --> 0:16:22,000
but I’m optimistic.

264
0:16:22.33,000 --> 0:16:25,000
CA: And these aren’t films that are primarily seen in cinemas?

265
0:16:25.33,000 --> 0:16:28,000
FS: Oh yes, of course. This is very important.

266
0:16:28.33,000 --> 0:16:3,000
Maybe, you know, for you to try to imagine this,

267
0:16:30.33,000 --> 0:16:36,000
these are films that are distributed directly in markets.

268
0:16:36.33,000 --> 0:16:38,000
They are bought in video shops.

269
0:16:38.33,000 --> 0:16:4,000
They can be rented for pennies.

270
0:16:40.33,000 --> 0:16:41,000
CA: On what format?

271
0:16:41.33,000 --> 0:16:44,000
FS: Oh, the format -- thank you for the question. Yes, it's VCDs.

272
0:16:44.33,000 --> 0:16:47,000
It's a CD, it's a little bit more compressed image.

273
0:16:47.33,000 --> 0:16:49,000
They started with VHS.

274
0:16:49.33,000 --> 0:16:52,000
They actually didn't wait for, you know, the latest technology.

275
0:16:52.33,000 --> 0:16:54,000
They started in '92, '94.

276
0:16:54.33,000 --> 0:17:,000
So there are 57 million VCRs in Nigeria

277
0:17:00.33,000 --> 0:17:04,000
that play, you know, VHS and these VCDs.

278
0:17:04.33,000 --> 0:17:06,000
It's a CD basically. It's a compact disc.

279
0:17:06.33,000 --> 0:17:08,000
CA: So on the streets, are film casts ... ?

280
0:17:08.33,000 --> 0:17:11,000
FS: You can be in a Lagos traffic jam

281
0:17:11.33,000 --> 0:17:16,000
and you can buy a movie or some bananas or some water. Yes.

282
0:17:16.33,000 --> 0:17:18,000
(Laughter)

283
0:17:18.33,000 --> 0:17:22,000
And I have to say, this really proves that storytelling,

284
0:17:22.33,000 --> 0:17:24,000
it's a commodity, it's a staple.

285
0:17:24.33,000 --> 0:17:27,000
There is no life without stories.

286
0:17:27.33,000 --> 0:17:29,000
CA: Franco, thank you so much.

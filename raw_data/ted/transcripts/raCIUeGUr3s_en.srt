1
0:00:12.312,000 --> 0:00:14,000
How many of you have been to Oklahoma City?

2
0:00:14.485,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Raise your hand. Yeah?

3
0:00:15.775,000 --> 0:00:17,000
How many of you have not been to Oklahoma City

4
0:00:17.924,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and have no idea who I am? (Laughter)

5
0:00:21.933,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Most of you. Let me give you a little bit of background.

6
0:00:24.731,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Oklahoma City started in the most

7
0:00:27.173,000 --> 0:00:28,000
unique way imaginable.

8
0:00:28.941,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Back on a spring day in 1889,

9
0:00:31.763,000 --> 0:00:32,000
the federal government held what they called

10
0:00:33.35,000 --> 0:00:34,000
a land run.

11
0:00:35.109,000 --> 0:00:36,000
They literally lined up the settlers

12
0:00:36.803,000 --> 0:00:37,000
along an imaginary line,

13
0:00:38.426,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and they fired off a gun,

14
0:00:39.851,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and the settlers roared across the countryside

15
0:00:41.636,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and put down a stake,

16
0:00:43.752,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and wherever they put down that stake,

17
0:00:45.288,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that was their new home.

18
0:00:46.996,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And at the end of the very first day,

19
0:00:49.366,000 --> 0:00:5,000
the population of Oklahoma City

20
0:00:51.116,000 --> 0:00:54,000
had gone from zero to 10,000,

21
0:00:55.022,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and our planning department

22
0:00:56.363,000 --> 0:00:59,000
is still paying for that.

23
0:01:00.283,000 --> 0:01:02,000
The citizens got together on that first day

24
0:01:02.78,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and elected a mayor.

25
0:01:05.032,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And then they shot him.

26
0:01:06.839,000 --> 0:01:1,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:11.947,000 --> 0:01:13,000
That's not really all that funny

28
0:01:14.43,000 --> 0:01:15,000
-- (Laughter) --

29
0:01:15.934,000 --> 0:01:16,000
but it allows me to see what type of audience

30
0:01:17.854,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I'm dealing with, so I appreciate the feedback.

31
0:01:22.216,000 --> 0:01:24,000
The 20th century was fairly kind to Oklahoma City.

32
0:01:24.993,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Our economy was based on commodities,

33
0:01:27.454,000 --> 0:01:29,000
so the price of cotton or the price of wheat,

34
0:01:30.253,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and ultimately the price of oil and natural gas.

35
0:01:33.566,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And along the way, we became a city

36
0:01:35.678,000 --> 0:01:37,000
of innovation.

37
0:01:37.724,000 --> 0:01:4,000
The shopping cart was invented in Oklahoma City.

38
0:01:41.597,000 --> 0:01:46,000
(Applause)

39
0:01:46.737,000 --> 0:01:51,000
The parking meter, invented in Oklahoma City.

40
0:01:52.037,000 --> 0:01:55,000
You're welcome.

41
0:01:55.783,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Having an economy, though,

42
0:01:57.479,000 --> 0:02:,000
that relates to commodities can give you some ups and some downs,

43
0:02:00.626,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and that was certainly the case in Oklahoma City's history.

44
0:02:03.223,000 --> 0:02:05,000
In the 1970s, when it appeared

45
0:02:05.58,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that the price of energy would never retreat,

46
0:02:07.403,000 --> 0:02:08,000
our economy was soaring,

47
0:02:09.137,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and then in the early 1980s, it cratered quickly.

48
0:02:12.719,000 --> 0:02:14,000
The price of energy dropped.

49
0:02:15.19,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Our banks began to fail.

50
0:02:16.942,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Before the end of the decade,

51
0:02:18.5,000 --> 0:02:21,000
100 banks had failed in the state of Oklahoma.

52
0:02:22.387,000 --> 0:02:24,000
There was no bailout on the horizon.

53
0:02:24.938,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Our banking industry, our oil and gas industry,

54
0:02:27.243,000 --> 0:02:29,000
our commercial real estate industry,

55
0:02:29.279,000 --> 0:02:32,000
were all at the bottom of the economic scale.

56
0:02:32.482,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Young people were leaving Oklahoma City in droves

57
0:02:35.127,000 --> 0:02:37,000
for Washington and Dallas and Houston and New York and Tokyo,

58
0:02:38.042,000 --> 0:02:4,000
anywhere where they could find a job that measured up

59
0:02:40.149,000 --> 0:02:41,000
to their educational attainment,

60
0:02:41.82,000 --> 0:02:44,000
because in Oklahoma City, the good jobs just weren't there.

61
0:02:45.051,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But along at the end of the '80s

62
0:02:46.767,000 --> 0:02:48,000
came an enterprising businessman

63
0:02:49.595,000 --> 0:02:51,000
who became mayor named Ron Norick.

64
0:02:51.604,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Ron Norick eventually figured out

65
0:02:53.351,000 --> 0:02:54,000
that the secret to economic development

66
0:02:55.288,000 --> 0:02:57,000
wasn't incentivizing companies up front,

67
0:02:57.449,000 --> 0:03:,000
it was about creating a place where businesses wanted to locate,

68
0:03:00.503,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and so he pushed an initiative called MAPS

69
0:03:03.515,000 --> 0:03:05,000
that basically was a penny-on-the-dollar sales tax

70
0:03:05.92,000 --> 0:03:07,000
to build a bunch of stuff.

71
0:03:08.232,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It built a new sports arena,

72
0:03:10.207,000 --> 0:03:12,000
a new canal downtown,

73
0:03:12.386,000 --> 0:03:14,000
it fixed up our performing arts center,

74
0:03:14.747,000 --> 0:03:16,000
a new baseball stadium downtown,

75
0:03:17.414,000 --> 0:03:18,000
a lot of things to improve the quality of life.

76
0:03:19.258,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And the economy indeed seemed to start

77
0:03:21.671,000 --> 0:03:23,000
showing some signs of life.

78
0:03:23.703,000 --> 0:03:25,000
The next mayor came along.

79
0:03:26.061,000 --> 0:03:27,000
He started MAPS for Kids,

80
0:03:27.838,000 --> 0:03:29,000
rebuilt the entire inner city school system,

81
0:03:30.565,000 --> 0:03:34,000
all 75 buildings either built anew or refurbished.

82
0:03:35.319,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And then, in 2004,

83
0:03:38.54,000 --> 0:03:42,000
in this rare collective lack of judgment

84
0:03:43.244,000 --> 0:03:45,000
bordering on civil disobedience,

85
0:03:45.872,000 --> 0:03:48,000
the citizens elected me mayor.

86
0:03:49.84,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Now the city I inherited

87
0:03:52.044,000 --> 0:03:53,000
was just on the verge

88
0:03:53.888,000 --> 0:03:56,000
of coming out of its slumbering economy,

89
0:03:57.289,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and for the very first time,

90
0:03:58.98,000 --> 0:04:01,000
we started showing up on the lists.

91
0:04:02.119,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Now you know the lists I'm talking about.

92
0:04:04.136,000 --> 0:04:05,000
The media and the Internet

93
0:04:05.919,000 --> 0:04:07,000
love to rank cities.

94
0:04:08.465,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And in Oklahoma City,

95
0:04:10.54,000 --> 0:04:12,000
we'd never really been on lists before.

96
0:04:13.221,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So I thought it was kind of cool

97
0:04:14.927,000 --> 0:04:16,000
when they came out with these positive lists and we were on there.

98
0:04:17.623,000 --> 0:04:18,000
We weren't anywhere close to the top,

99
0:04:19.321,000 --> 0:04:22,000
but we were on the list, we were somebody.

100
0:04:22.818,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Best city to get a job,

101
0:04:24.648,000 --> 0:04:26,000
best city to start a business,

102
0:04:26.663,000 --> 0:04:27,000
best downtown --

103
0:04:28.456,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Oklahoma City.

104
0:04:30.93,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And then came the list

105
0:04:34.235,000 --> 0:04:39,000
of the most obese cities in the country.

106
0:04:39.781,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And there we were.

107
0:04:42.884,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Now I like to point out that we were on that list

108
0:04:45.028,000 --> 0:04:47,000
with a lot of really cool places.

109
0:04:47.526,000 --> 0:04:48,000
(Laughter)

110
0:04:48.749,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Dallas and Houston and New Orleans

111
0:04:52.005,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and Atlanta and Miami.

112
0:04:53.715,000 --> 0:04:54,000
You know, these are cities that, typically,

113
0:04:55.212,000 --> 0:04:57,000
you're not embarrassed to be associated with.

114
0:04:57.86,000 --> 0:05:01,000
But nonetheless, I didn't like being on the list.

115
0:05:02.128,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And about that time, I got on the scales.

116
0:05:06.473,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And I weighed 220 pounds.

117
0:05:08.599,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And then I went to this website

118
0:05:10.102,000 --> 0:05:11,000
sponsored by the federal government,

119
0:05:11.952,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and I typed in my height, I typed in my weight,

120
0:05:15.625,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and I pushed Enter,

121
0:05:16.954,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and it came back and said "obese."

122
0:05:21.004,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I thought, "What a stupid website."

123
0:05:23.257,000 --> 0:05:25,000
(Laughter)

124
0:05:26.132,000 --> 0:05:32,000
"I'm not obese. I would know if I was obese."

125
0:05:32.377,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And then I started getting honest with myself

126
0:05:34.868,000 --> 0:05:38,000
about what had become my lifelong struggle with obesity,

127
0:05:39.794,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and I noticed this pattern,

128
0:05:41.674,000 --> 0:05:43,000
that I was gaining about two or three pounds a year,

129
0:05:44.365,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and then about every 10 years, I'd drop 20 or 30 pounds.

130
0:05:47.671,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And then I'd do it again.

131
0:05:49.233,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And I had this huge closet full of clothes,

132
0:05:51.566,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and I could only wear a third of it at any one time,

133
0:05:54.933,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and only I knew which part of the closet I could wear.

134
0:05:59.045,000 --> 0:06:04,000
But it all seemed fairly normal, going through it.

135
0:06:04.595,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Well, I finally decided I needed to lose weight,

136
0:06:07.677,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and I knew I could because I'd done it so many times before,

137
0:06:10.094,000 --> 0:06:12,000
so I simply stopped eating as much.

138
0:06:12.332,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I had always exercised.

139
0:06:13.587,000 --> 0:06:14,000
That really wasn't the part of the equation

140
0:06:15.462,000 --> 0:06:16,000
that I needed to work on.

141
0:06:17.375,000 --> 0:06:19,000
But I had been eating 3,000 calories a day,

142
0:06:20.204,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and I cut it to 2,000 calories a day,

143
0:06:22.486,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and the weight came off. I lost about a pound a week

144
0:06:25.377,000 --> 0:06:28,000
for about 40 weeks.

145
0:06:29.283,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Along the way, though,

146
0:06:30.828,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I started examining my city,

147
0:06:34.848,000 --> 0:06:37,000
its culture, its infrastructure,

148
0:06:38.344,000 --> 0:06:4,000
trying to figure out why our specific city

149
0:06:41.236,000 --> 0:06:45,000
seemed to have a problem with obesity.

150
0:06:45.635,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And I came to the conclusion

151
0:06:47.811,000 --> 0:06:5,000
that we had built an incredible quality of life

152
0:06:51.669,000 --> 0:06:54,000
if you happen to be a car.

153
0:06:55.089,000 --> 0:06:58,000
(Laughter)

154
0:06:58.324,000 --> 0:07:01,000
But if you happen to be a person,

155
0:07:01.864,000 --> 0:07:05,000
you are combatting the car seemingly at every turn.

156
0:07:06.433,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Our city is very spread out.

157
0:07:08.706,000 --> 0:07:11,000
We have a great intersection of highways,

158
0:07:12.261,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I mean, literally no traffic congestion in Oklahoma City to speak of.

159
0:07:15.875,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And so people live far, far away.

160
0:07:18.086,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Our city limits are enormous, 620 square miles,

161
0:07:21.671,000 --> 0:07:24,000
but 15 miles is less than 15 minutes.

162
0:07:25.216,000 --> 0:07:26,000
You literally can get a speeding ticket

163
0:07:27.151,000 --> 0:07:3,000
during rush hour in Oklahoma City.

164
0:07:30.748,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And as a result, people tend to spread out.

165
0:07:33.245,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Land's cheap.

166
0:07:36.938,000 --> 0:07:38,000
We had also not required developers

167
0:07:39.504,000 --> 0:07:41,000
to build sidewalks on new developments for a long, long time.

168
0:07:41.999,000 --> 0:07:43,000
We had fixed that, but it had been relatively recently,

169
0:07:44.412,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and there were literally 100,000

170
0:07:46.806,000 --> 0:07:48,000
or more homes into our inventory

171
0:07:49.482,000 --> 0:07:55,000
in neighborhoods that had virtually no level of walkability.

172
0:07:57.864,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And as I tried to examine

173
0:08:00.118,000 --> 0:08:01,000
how we might deal with obesity,

174
0:08:02.091,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and was taking all of these elements into my mind,

175
0:08:03.975,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I decided that the first thing we need to do

176
0:08:07.389,000 --> 0:08:09,000
was have a conversation.

177
0:08:09.509,000 --> 0:08:1,000
You see, in Oklahoma City,

178
0:08:11.468,000 --> 0:08:13,000
we weren't talking about obesity.

179
0:08:14.249,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And so, on New Year's Eve of 2007,

180
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I went to the zoo,

181
0:08:21.299,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and I stood in front of the elephants,

182
0:08:23.72,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and I said, "This city is going on a diet,

183
0:08:27.583,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and we're going to lose a million pounds."

184
0:08:31.202,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Well, that's when all hell broke loose.

185
0:08:32.975,000 --> 0:08:34,000
(Laughter)

186
0:08:35.753,000 --> 0:08:36,000
The national media

187
0:08:37.636,000 --> 0:08:41,000
gravitated toward this story immediately,

188
0:08:42.153,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and they really could have gone with it one of two ways.

189
0:08:45.012,000 --> 0:08:46,000
They could have said,

190
0:08:46.543,000 --> 0:08:48,000
"This city is so fat

191
0:08:48.685,000 --> 0:08:51,000
that the mayor had to put them on a diet."

192
0:08:52.001,000 --> 0:08:54,000
But fortunately, the consensus was,

193
0:08:54.504,000 --> 0:08:56,000
"Look, this is a problem in a lot of places.

194
0:08:56.851,000 --> 0:08:59,000
This is a city that's wanting to do something about it."

195
0:09:00.71,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And so they started helping us

196
0:09:02.68,000 --> 0:09:04,000
drive traffic to the website.

197
0:09:04.83,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Now, the web address was

198
0:09:06.348,000 --> 0:09:1,000
thiscityisgoingonadiet.com.

199
0:09:11.329,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And I appeared on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show"

200
0:09:14.748,000 --> 0:09:17,000
one weekday morning to talk about the initiative,

201
0:09:18.168,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and on that day, 150,000 visits

202
0:09:21.688,000 --> 0:09:22,000
were placed to our website.

203
0:09:23.508,000 --> 0:09:24,000
People were signing up,

204
0:09:25.082,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and so the pounds started to add up,

205
0:09:27.928,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and the conversation that I thought

206
0:09:29.535,000 --> 0:09:32,000
was so important to have was starting to take place.

207
0:09:33.299,000 --> 0:09:35,000
It was taking place inside the homes,

208
0:09:35.848,000 --> 0:09:37,000
mothers and fathers talking about it with their kids.

209
0:09:38.425,000 --> 0:09:4,000
It was taking place in churches.

210
0:09:41.086,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Churches were starting their own running groups

211
0:09:43.082,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and their own support groups

212
0:09:44.37,000 --> 0:09:46,000
for people who were dealing with obesity.

213
0:09:47.102,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Suddenly, it was a topic worth discussing at schools

214
0:09:50.514,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and in the workplace.

215
0:09:52.146,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And the large companies, they typically have

216
0:09:54.307,000 --> 0:09:55,000
wonderful wellness programs,

217
0:09:55.903,000 --> 0:09:56,000
but the medium-sized companies

218
0:09:57.226,000 --> 0:10:,000
that typically fall between the cracks on issues like this,

219
0:10:00.311,000 --> 0:10:02,000
they started to get engaged and used our program

220
0:10:03.012,000 --> 0:10:04,000
as a model for their own employees

221
0:10:04.868,000 --> 0:10:05,000
to try and have contests to see

222
0:10:06.814,000 --> 0:10:09,000
who might be able to deal with their obesity situation

223
0:10:10.629,000 --> 0:10:14,000
in a way that could be proactively beneficial to others.

224
0:10:15.596,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And then came the next stage of the equation.

225
0:10:20.217,000 --> 0:10:24,000
It was time to push what I called MAPS 3.

226
0:10:24.229,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Now MAPS 3, like the other two programs,

227
0:10:26.429,000 --> 0:10:28,000
had had an economic development motive behind it,

228
0:10:29.093,000 --> 0:10:31,000
but along with the traditional economic development tasks

229
0:10:31.913,000 --> 0:10:32,000
like building a new convention center,

230
0:10:33.675,000 --> 0:10:35,000
we added some health-related infrastructure

231
0:10:36.439,000 --> 0:10:37,000
to the process.

232
0:10:38.331,000 --> 0:10:4,000
We added a new central park, 70 acres in size,

233
0:10:41.076,000 --> 0:10:43,000
to be right downtown in Oklahoma City.

234
0:10:43.466,000 --> 0:10:44,000
We're building a downtown streetcar

235
0:10:45.245,000 --> 0:10:47,000
to try and help the walkability formula

236
0:10:47.493,000 --> 0:10:49,000
for people who choose to live in the inner city

237
0:10:49.545,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and help us create the density there.

238
0:10:52.922,000 --> 0:10:55,000
We're building senior health and wellness centers

239
0:10:56.277,000 --> 0:10:57,000
throughout the community.

240
0:10:57.975,000 --> 0:10:58,000
We put some investments on the river

241
0:10:59.663,000 --> 0:11:01,000
that had originally been invested upon

242
0:11:02.199,000 --> 0:11:03,000
in the original MAPS,

243
0:11:03.879,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and now we are currently in the final stages

244
0:11:05.823,000 --> 0:11:07,000
of developing the finest venue in the world

245
0:11:08.474,000 --> 0:11:1,000
for the sports of canoe, kayak and rowing.

246
0:11:11.29,000 --> 0:11:12,000
We hosted the Olympic trials last spring.

247
0:11:13.182,000 --> 0:11:15,000
We have Olympic-caliber events coming to Oklahoma City,

248
0:11:15.586,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and athletes from all over the world moving in,

249
0:11:18.142,000 --> 0:11:19,000
along with inner city programs

250
0:11:19.744,000 --> 0:11:22,000
to get kids more engaged in these types of recreational activities

251
0:11:23.694,000 --> 0:11:25,000
that are a little bit nontraditional.

252
0:11:26.494,000 --> 0:11:29,000
We also, with another initiative that was passed,

253
0:11:30.22,000 --> 0:11:33,000
are building hundreds of miles of new sidewalks

254
0:11:34.063,000 --> 0:11:36,000
throughout the metro area.

255
0:11:36.462,000 --> 0:11:37,000
We're even going back into some

256
0:11:38.307,000 --> 0:11:39,000
inner city situations

257
0:11:39.802,000 --> 0:11:4,000
where we had built neighborhoods

258
0:11:41.516,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and we had built schools

259
0:11:43.197,000 --> 0:11:44,000
but we had not connected the two.

260
0:11:45.123,000 --> 0:11:47,000
We had built libraries and we had built neighborhoods,

261
0:11:47.841,000 --> 0:11:48,000
but we had never really connected the two

262
0:11:49.446,000 --> 0:11:51,000
with any sort of walkability.

263
0:11:51.87,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Through yet another funding source,

264
0:11:53.969,000 --> 0:11:56,000
we're redesigning all of our inner city streets

265
0:11:57.304,000 --> 0:11:58,000
to be more pedestrian-friendly.

266
0:11:58.814,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Our streets were really wide,

267
0:12:00.691,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and you'd push the button to allow you to walk across,

268
0:12:03.118,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and you had to run in order to get there in time.

269
0:12:06.666,000 --> 0:12:07,000
But now we've narrowed the streets,

270
0:12:08.574,000 --> 0:12:1,000
highly landscaped them, making them more pedestrian-friendly,

271
0:12:11.482,000 --> 0:12:13,000
really a redesign, rethinking the way

272
0:12:13.949,000 --> 0:12:14,000
we build our infrastructure,

273
0:12:15.497,000 --> 0:12:2,000
designing a city around people and not cars.

274
0:12:20.744,000 --> 0:12:22,000
We're completing our bicycle trail master plan.

275
0:12:22.865,000 --> 0:12:23,000
We'll have over 100 miles

276
0:12:24.683,000 --> 0:12:26,000
when we're through building it out.

277
0:12:27.475,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And so you see this culture starting to shift

278
0:12:30.736,000 --> 0:12:31,000
in Oklahoma City.

279
0:12:32.24,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And lo and behold, the demographic changes

280
0:12:34.917,000 --> 0:12:36,000
that are coming with it are very inspiring.

281
0:12:37.897,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Highly educated twentysomethings

282
0:12:39.48,000 --> 0:12:41,000
are moving to Oklahoma City from all over the region

283
0:12:41.54,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and, indeed, even from further away, in California.

284
0:12:48.715,000 --> 0:12:5,000
When we reached a million pounds,

285
0:12:51.051,000 --> 0:12:53,000
in January of 2012,

286
0:12:53.352,000 --> 0:12:55,000
I flew to New York with some our participants

287
0:12:55.795,000 --> 0:12:56,000
who had lost over 100 pounds,

288
0:12:57.325,000 --> 0:12:59,000
whose lives had been changed,

289
0:12:59.61,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and we appeared on the Rachael Ray show,

290
0:13:01.781,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and then that afternoon, I did a round of media in New York

291
0:13:05.188,000 --> 0:13:07,000
pushing the same messages

292
0:13:07.629,000 --> 0:13:11,000
that you're accustomed to hearing about obesity and the dangers of it.

293
0:13:11.725,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And I went into the lobby of Men's Fitness magazine,

294
0:13:16.706,000 --> 0:13:2,000
the same magazine that had put us on that list

295
0:13:21.082,000 --> 0:13:23,000
five years before.

296
0:13:23.445,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And as I'm sitting in the lobby waiting to talk to the reporter,

297
0:13:26.402,000 --> 0:13:28,000
I notice there's a magazine copy

298
0:13:28.786,000 --> 0:13:3,000
of the current issue right there on the table,

299
0:13:31.405,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and I pick it up, and I look at the headline

300
0:13:33.061,000 --> 0:13:34,000
across the top, and it says,

301
0:13:34.826,000 --> 0:13:38,000
"America's Fattest Cities: Do You Live in One?"

302
0:13:39.507,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Well, I knew I did,

303
0:13:41.652,000 --> 0:13:43,000
so I picked up the magazine

304
0:13:43.804,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and I began to look,

305
0:13:46.815,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and we weren't on it.

306
0:13:49.561,000 --> 0:13:53,000
(Applause)

307
0:13:55.984,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Then I looked on the list of fittest cities,

308
0:13:58.909,000 --> 0:14:,000
and we were on that list.

309
0:14:01.072,000 --> 0:14:04,000
We were on the list as the 22nd fittest city in the United States.

310
0:14:04.45,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Our state health statistics are doing better.

311
0:14:07.637,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Granted, we have a long way to go.

312
0:14:09.749,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Health is still not something

313
0:14:10.888,000 --> 0:14:11,000
that we should be proud of in Oklahoma City,

314
0:14:12.425,000 --> 0:14:15,000
but we seem to have turned the cultural shift

315
0:14:16.208,000 --> 0:14:19,000
of making health a greater priority.

316
0:14:19.289,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And we love the idea of the demographics

317
0:14:22.132,000 --> 0:14:23,000
of highly educated twentysomethings,

318
0:14:23.942,000 --> 0:14:24,000
people with choices, choosing Oklahoma City

319
0:14:25.711,000 --> 0:14:26,000
in large numbers.

320
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
We have the lowest unemployment in the United States,

321
0:14:29.453,000 --> 0:14:31,000
probably the strongest economy in the United States.

322
0:14:32.325,000 --> 0:14:33,000
And if you're like me, at some point

323
0:14:33.955,000 --> 0:14:35,000
in your educational career,

324
0:14:36.327,000 --> 0:14:38,000
you were asked to read a book called

325
0:14:38.544,000 --> 0:14:4,000
"The Grapes of Wrath."

326
0:14:41.389,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Oklahomans leaving for California

327
0:14:44.423,000 --> 0:14:46,000
in large numbers for a better future.

328
0:14:46.866,000 --> 0:14:47,000
When we look at the demographic shifts

329
0:14:48.655,000 --> 0:14:49,000
of people coming from the west,

330
0:14:49.815,000 --> 0:14:5,000
it appears that what we're seeing now

331
0:14:51.443,000 --> 0:14:53,000
is the wrath of grapes.

332
0:14:54.291,000 --> 0:14:55,000
(Laughter)

333
0:14:56.104,000 --> 0:14:59,000
(Applause)

334
0:14:59.169,000 --> 0:15:03,000
The grandchildren are coming home.

335
0:15:03.714,000 --> 0:15:04,000
You've been a great audience and very attentive.

336
0:15:05.502,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Thank you very much for having me here.

337
0:15:07.953,000 --> 0:15:09,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13,000 --> 0:00:23,000
A human child is born,

2
0:00:23,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and for quite a long time

3
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:33,000
is a consumer.

4
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
It cannot be consciously a contributor.

5
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:47,000
It is helpless.

6
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:5,000
It doesn't know how to survive,

7
0:00:5,000 --> 0:01:05,000
even though it is endowed with an instinct to survive.

8
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:21,000
It needs the help of mother, or a foster mother, to survive.

9
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:34,000
It can't afford to doubt the person who tends the child.

10
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It has to totally surrender,

11
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:44,000
as one surrenders to an anesthesiologist.

12
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It has to totally surrender.

13
0:01:5,000 --> 0:02:,000
That implies a lot of trust.

14
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:07,000
That implies the trusted person

15
0:02:07,000 --> 0:02:1,000
won't violate the trust.

16
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:15,000
As the child grows,

17
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:19,000
it begins to discover

18
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that the person trusted is violating the trust.

19
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:3,000
It doesn't know even the word "violation."

20
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Therefore, it has to blame itself,

21
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:39,000
a wordless blame,

22
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:51,000
which is more difficult to really resolve --

23
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:57,000
the wordless self-blame.

24
0:02:57,000 --> 0:03:02,000
As the child grows to become an adult:

25
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:06,000
so far, it has been a consumer,

26
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:09,000
but the growth of a human being

27
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:19,000
lies in his or her capacity to contribute,

28
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:23,000
to be a contributor.

29
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:29,000
One cannot contribute unless one feels secure,

30
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:32,000
one feels big,

31
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:38,000
one feels: I have enough.

32
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:42,000
To be compassionate is not a joke.

33
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:45,000
It's not that simple.

34
0:03:45,000 --> 0:03:52,000
One has to discover a certain bigness in oneself.

35
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:55,000
That bigness should be centered on oneself,

36
0:03:55,000 --> 0:03:58,000
not in terms of money,

37
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:02,000
not in terms of power you wield,

38
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:1,000
not in terms of any status that you can command in the society,

39
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:15,000
but it should be centered on oneself.

40
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:19,000
The self: you are self-aware.

41
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:26,000
On that self, it should be centered -- a bigness, a wholeness.

42
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Otherwise, compassion is just a word and a dream.

43
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:41,000
You can be compassionate occasionally,

44
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:45,000
more moved by empathy

45
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:52,000
than by compassion.

46
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Thank God we are empathetic.

47
0:04:56,000 --> 0:05:01,000
When somebody's in pain, we pick up the pain.

48
0:05:01,000 --> 0:05:08,000
In a Wimbledon final match,

49
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:11,000
these two guys fight it out.

50
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Each one has got two games.

51
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
It can be anybody's game.

52
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:26,000
What they have sweated so far has no meaning.

53
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
One person wins.

54
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:42,000
The tennis etiquette is, both the players have to come to the net

55
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and shake hands.

56
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:5,000
The winner boxes the air

57
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and kisses the ground,

58
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:59,000
throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it.

59
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:02,000
(Laughter)

60
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And this guy has to come to the net.

61
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:09,000
When he comes to the net,

62
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:14,000
you see, his whole face changes.

63
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:19,000
It looks as though he's wishing that he didn't win.

64
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Why? Empathy.

65
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:26,000
That's human heart.

66
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
No human heart is denied of that empathy.

67
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:38,000
No religion can demolish that by indoctrination.

68
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:44,000
No culture, no nation and nationalism --

69
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:47,000
nothing can touch it

70
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:5,000
because it is empathy.

71
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And that capacity to empathize

72
0:06:56,000 --> 0:07:04,000
is the window through which you reach out to people,

73
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:09,000
you do something that makes a difference in somebody's life --

74
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:14,000
even words, even time.

75
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Compassion is not defined in one form.

76
0:07:19,000 --> 0:07:22,000
There's no Indian compassion.

77
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:26,000
There's no American compassion.

78
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
It transcends nation, the gender, the age.

79
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Why? Because it is there in everybody.

80
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:5,000
It's experienced by people occasionally.

81
0:07:5,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Then this occasional compassion,

82
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:59,000
we are not talking about --

83
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:02,000
it will never remain occasional.

84
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:07,000
By mandate, you cannot make a person compassionate.

85
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:14,000
You can't say, "Please love me."

86
0:08:14,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Love is something you discover.

87
0:08:17,000 --> 0:08:22,000
It's not an action,

88
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:27,000
but in the English language, it is also an action.

89
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I will come to it later.

90
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So one has got to discover a certain wholeness.

91
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I am going to cite the possibility of being whole,

92
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:52,000
which is within our experience, everybody's experience.

93
0:08:52,000 --> 0:09:01,000
In spite of a very tragic life,

94
0:09:01,000 --> 0:09:11,000
one is happy in moments which are very few and far between.

95
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And the one who is happy,

96
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:22,000
even for a slapstick joke,

97
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:31,000
accepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself.

98
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:35,000
That means the whole universe,

99
0:09:35,000 --> 0:09:39,000
known things and unknown things.

100
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:45,000
All of them are totally accepted

101
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:51,000
because you discover your wholeness in yourself.

102
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:55,000
The subject -- "me" --

103
0:09:55,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and the object -- the scheme of things --

104
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:03,000
fuse into oneness,

105
0:10:03,000 --> 0:10:09,000
an experience nobody can say, "I am denied of,"

106
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:15,000
an experience common to all and sundry.

107
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:24,000
That experience confirms that, in spite of all your limitations --

108
0:10:24,000 --> 0:10:29,000
all your wants, desires, unfulfilled, and the credit cards

109
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and layoffs

110
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and, finally, baldness --

111
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:42,000
you can be happy.

112
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:47,000
But the extension of the logic is

113
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:53,000
that you don't need to fulfill your desire to be happy.

114
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:59,000
You are the very happiness, the wholeness that you want to be.

115
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:01,000
There's no choice in this:

116
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:07,000
that only confirms the reality

117
0:11:07,000 --> 0:11:14,000
that the wholeness cannot be different from you,

118
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:18,000
cannot be minus you.

119
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:21,000
It has got to be you.

120
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:24,000
You cannot be a part of wholeness

121
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and still be whole.

122
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Your moment of happiness reveals that reality,

123
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:36,000
that realization, that recognition:

124
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:39,000
"Maybe I am the whole.

125
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Maybe the swami is right.

126
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Maybe the swami is right." You start your new life.

127
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Then everything becomes meaningful.

128
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:03,000
I have no more reason to blame myself.

129
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:09,000
If one has to blame oneself, one has a million reasons plus many.

130
0:12:09,000 --> 0:12:15,000
But if I say, in spite of my body being limited --

131
0:12:15,000 --> 0:12:24,000
if it is black it is not white, if it is white it is not black:

132
0:12:24,000 --> 0:12:3,000
body is limited any which way you look at it. Limited.

133
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Your knowledge is limited, health is limited,

134
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and power is therefore limited,

135
0:12:37,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and the cheerfulness is going to be limited.

136
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Compassion is going to be limited.

137
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Everything is going to be limitless.

138
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:56,000
You cannot command compassion

139
0:12:56,000 --> 0:13:,000
unless you become limitless, and nobody can become limitless,

140
0:13:,000 --> 0:13:05,000
either you are or you are not. Period.

141
0:13:05,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And there is no way of your being not limitless too.

142
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Your own experience reveals, in spite of all limitations, you are the whole.

143
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And the wholeness is the reality of you

144
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:31,000
when you relate to the world.

145
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:34,000
It is love first.

146
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:36,000
When you relate to the world,

147
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:41,000
the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness

148
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:46,000
is, what we say, love.

149
0:13:46,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And itself becomes compassion

150
0:13:5,000 --> 0:14:01,000
if the object that you relate to evokes that emotion.

151
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Then that again transforms into giving, into sharing.

152
0:14:11,000 --> 0:14:17,000
You express yourself because you have compassion.

153
0:14:17,000 --> 0:14:23,000
To discover compassion, you need to be compassionate.

154
0:14:23,000 --> 0:14:28,000
To discover the capacity to give and share,

155
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:3,000
you need to be giving and sharing.

156
0:14:3,000 --> 0:14:35,000
There is no shortcut: it is like swimming by swimming.

157
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:39,000
You learn swimming by swimming.

158
0:14:39,000 --> 0:14:43,000
You cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water.

159
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:45,000
(Laughter)

160
0:14:45,000 --> 0:14:49,000
You learn swimming by swimming. You learn cycling by cycling.

161
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:51,000
You learn cooking by cooking,

162
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:54,000
having some sympathetic people around you

163
0:14:54,000 --> 0:14:56,000
to eat what you cook.

164
0:14:56,000 --> 0:14:59,000
(Laughter)

165
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:08,000
And, therefore, what I say,

166
0:15:08,000 --> 0:15:1,000
you have to fake it and make it.

167
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:17,000
(Laughter)

168
0:15:17,000 --> 0:15:2,000
You need to.

169
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:26,000
My predecessor meant that.

170
0:15:26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
You have to act it out.

171
0:15:31,000 --> 0:15:38,000
You have to act compassionately.

172
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:43,000
There is no verb for compassion,

173
0:15:43,000 --> 0:15:47,000
but you have an adverb for compassion.

174
0:15:47,000 --> 0:15:51,000
That's interesting to me.

175
0:15:51,000 --> 0:15:57,000
You act compassionately.

176
0:15:57,000 --> 0:16:01,000
But then, how to act compassionately if you don't have compassion?

177
0:16:01,000 --> 0:16:04,000
That is where you fake.

178
0:16:04,000 --> 0:16:08,000
You fake it and make it. This is the mantra of the United States of America.

179
0:16:08,000 --> 0:16:13,000
(Laughter)

180
0:16:13,000 --> 0:16:17,000
You fake it and make it.

181
0:16:17,000 --> 0:16:2,000
You act compassionately as though you have compassion:

182
0:16:2,000 --> 0:16:23,000
grind your teeth,

183
0:16:23,000 --> 0:16:25,000
take all the support system.

184
0:16:25,000 --> 0:16:29,000
If you know how to pray, pray.

185
0:16:29,000 --> 0:16:32,000
Ask for compassion.

186
0:16:32,000 --> 0:16:35,000
Let me act compassionately.

187
0:16:35,000 --> 0:16:37,000
Do it.

188
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:39,000
You'll discover compassion

189
0:16:39,000 --> 0:16:44,000
and also slowly a relative compassion,

190
0:16:44,000 --> 0:16:48,000
and slowly, perhaps if you get the right teaching,

191
0:16:48,000 --> 0:16:53,000
you'll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation

192
0:16:53,000 --> 0:16:59,000
of the reality of yourself, which is oneness, wholeness,

193
0:16:59,000 --> 0:17:01,000
and that's what you are.

194
0:17:01,000 --> 0:17:04,000
With these words, thank you very much.

195
0:17:04,000 --> 0:17:06,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:13,000
When I tell people

2
0:00:14.2,000 --> 0:00:18,000
that I'm trying to develop a contraceptive pill for men,

3
0:00:18.96,000 --> 0:00:21,000
the response usually varies along gender lines.

4
0:00:23.2,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Women say something like,

5
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:28,000
"Fantastic. It's about time. When?"

6
0:00:28.32,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:29.64,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Men have one of two responses.

8
0:00:31.76,000 --> 0:00:33,000
They either love the idea,

9
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:36,000
or they look at me a little warily

10
0:00:36.08,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and wonder what exactly I have in store for their testicles.

11
0:00:39.6,000 --> 0:00:41,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:42.36,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So why does the world need a male pill?

13
0:00:47.32,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Well, what if I told you

14
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that of the six million pregnancies annually in the United States,

15
0:00:53.44,000 --> 0:00:55,000
three million of them are unintended?

16
0:00:56.36,000 --> 0:00:57,000
That's half.

17
0:00:57.96,000 --> 0:00:59,000
That's a really surprising number.

18
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And those three million unintended pregnancies

19
0:01:02.76,000 --> 0:01:05,000
account for the vast majority of the more than one million abortions

20
0:01:06.04,000 --> 0:01:08,000
annually performed in the United States.

21
0:01:09.44,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Happily, the rate of unintended pregnancy has fallen in the last few years

22
0:01:13.88,000 --> 0:01:14,000
by about 10 percent.

23
0:01:15.72,000 --> 0:01:17,000
This is because more women are using effective, long-acting,

24
0:01:18.68,000 --> 0:01:19,000
reversible forms of contraception.

25
0:01:21.6,000 --> 0:01:23,000
But we still have a long way to go.

26
0:01:25.04,000 --> 0:01:28,000
One approach that's finally becoming a real possibility

27
0:01:28.24,000 --> 0:01:31,000
is better contraceptive options for men.

28
0:01:32.6,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Think about it.

29
0:01:33.84,000 --> 0:01:36,000
We have over a dozen methods of contraception for women:

30
0:01:37.52,000 --> 0:01:42,000
pills, patches, IUDs, shots, sponges, rings, etc.

31
0:01:44.2,000 --> 0:01:47,000
For men, we've had the same two options

32
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
for more than a hundred years:

33
0:01:49.64,000 --> 0:01:5,000
condoms and vasectomy.

34
0:01:52.52,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Despite having only two options,

35
0:01:54.68,000 --> 0:01:56,000
both of which have significant drawbacks,

36
0:01:57.48,000 --> 0:02:01,000
men currently account for 30 percent of all contraceptive use,

37
0:02:02.08,000 --> 0:02:04,000
with 10 percent of couples relying on vasectomy

38
0:02:04.76,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and 20 percent of couples using condoms.

39
0:02:08.64,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Why are 20 percent of couples relying on condoms for contraception

40
0:02:13.68,000 --> 0:02:16,000
when condoms have a one-year failure rate of over 15 percent?

41
0:02:17.88,000 --> 0:02:2,000
It's because many women can't either safely take

42
0:02:21.08,000 --> 0:02:24,000
currently available female contraceptives, for reasons such as blood clots,

43
0:02:24.84,000 --> 0:02:26,000
or they can't tolerate the side effects.

44
0:02:28.28,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So if we think a male contraceptive would be useful, the next question is:

45
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
How do we go about developing one?

46
0:02:35.08,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Well, there's two general approaches.

47
0:02:37.56,000 --> 0:02:39,000
The first approach is to try and interfere

48
0:02:39.64,000 --> 0:02:42,000
with the way the sperm swim towards or bind to the egg.

49
0:02:44.2,000 --> 0:02:46,000
This approach turns out to be really difficult,

50
0:02:47.08,000 --> 0:02:51,000
because it's hard to get enough medication in the small volume of the ejaculate

51
0:02:51.2,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and have it still work inside the female reproductive tract.

52
0:02:55.68,000 --> 0:02:58,000
This is why there's been a lot more work done on the second approach,

53
0:02:59.4,000 --> 0:03:02,000
which is turning off sperm production entirely.

54
0:03:03.44,000 --> 0:03:04,000
This is also challenging.

55
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Why? Turns out that men make a lot of sperm.

56
0:03:09.28,000 --> 0:03:1,000
(Laughter)

57
0:03:10.72,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Men make a thousand sperm every second

58
0:03:15.68,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and to have an effective contraceptive,

59
0:03:17.6,000 --> 0:03:19,000
you need to get that level of sperm production

60
0:03:19.8,000 --> 0:03:21,000
down to one percent of its normal value.

61
0:03:23.4,000 --> 0:03:25,000
The good news is, this is possible,

62
0:03:26.36,000 --> 0:03:27,000
almost.

63
0:03:27.8,000 --> 0:03:32,000
The most studied approach has been to use hormones to suppress sperm production.

64
0:03:33.76,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Testosterone and progesterone, when administered together,

65
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
will suppress the signals from the brain to the testes to make sperm,

66
0:03:41.36,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and in about 90 percent of men,

67
0:03:43.52,000 --> 0:03:46,000
sperm production after three to four months will stop.

68
0:03:47.68,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Unfortunately, 10 percent of men don't respond to these hormonal regimens

69
0:03:51.4,000 --> 0:03:52,000
for reasons that aren't understood.

70
0:03:54.8,000 --> 0:03:56,000
For the last several years, my colleagues and I

71
0:03:57.04,000 --> 0:04:,000
have been taking a different approach to male contraceptive development,

72
0:04:00.6,000 --> 0:04:02,000
one that doesn't involve the administration of hormones.

73
0:04:04.24,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Specifically, we are looking to block the function of vitamin A in the testes.

74
0:04:09.36,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Why? Well, for over 90 years it's been known

75
0:04:12.92,000 --> 0:04:14,000
that you need vitamin A to make sperm.

76
0:04:15.96,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Animals who are deprived of vitamin A in their diet

77
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:2,000
stop making sperm

78
0:04:20.92,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and restart making sperm again when the vitamin A is reintroduced.

79
0:04:25.72,000 --> 0:04:27,000
The vitamin A that we ingest

80
0:04:28.279,000 --> 0:04:32,000
is converted by a family of enzymes to something called retinoic acid.

81
0:04:33.959,000 --> 0:04:36,000
One of these enzymes is found only in the testes.

82
0:04:37.08,000 --> 0:04:4,000
It's this enzyme that we are attempting to block.

83
0:04:40.2,000 --> 0:04:44,000
The blockade of this enzyme should deprive the testes of retinoic acid

84
0:04:44.64,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and stop sperm production

85
0:04:46.6,000 --> 0:04:49,000
without affecting vitamin A's functions elsewhere in the body.

86
0:04:50.72,000 --> 0:04:51,000
We're testing this approach in animals

87
0:04:52.64,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and hope to move to human testing soon.

88
0:04:57,000 --> 0:05:,000
Obviously, the impact of such a male contraceptive

89
0:05:00.4,000 --> 0:05:02,000
would go well beyond reproductive biology.

90
0:05:03.44,000 --> 0:05:06,000
It's interesting to speculate about the effect that it would have

91
0:05:06.52,000 --> 0:05:07,000
on relationships between men and women.

92
0:05:09.32,000 --> 0:05:1,000
One intriguing possibility

93
0:05:10.8,000 --> 0:05:14,000
is that a man could monitor his contraceptive status over time.

94
0:05:15.72,000 --> 0:05:16,000
In the last several years,

95
0:05:17.32,000 --> 0:05:21,000
two groups have introduced home sperm-testing devices

96
0:05:21.6,000 --> 0:05:22,000
that are iPhone-based

97
0:05:23.12,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and that are easy to use.

98
0:05:25.68,000 --> 0:05:29,000
A man could test his sperm count and share the result with his partner.

99
0:05:29.96,000 --> 0:05:3,000
If the man's sperm count were zero,

100
0:05:31.8,000 --> 0:05:33,000
the man and his partner would feel very comfortable

101
0:05:34.64,000 --> 0:05:36,000
relying on his contraceptive.

102
0:05:37.52,000 --> 0:05:4,000
A tool like this, coupled with a male contraceptive,

103
0:05:40.72,000 --> 0:05:44,000
could greatly increase the role for men in preventing unintended pregnancy.

104
0:05:46.84,000 --> 0:05:48,000
The researchers who are working on male contraception

105
0:05:49.64,000 --> 0:05:51,000
are trying to create a better future for couples,

106
0:05:52.48,000 --> 0:05:56,000
a future where contraception is no longer considered just "a woman's issue,"

107
0:05:57.04,000 --> 0:05:59,000
rather an issue for couples to decide together.

108
0:06:01.32,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So why does the world need a male pill?

109
0:06:04.52,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Well, I believe that a male pill

110
0:06:06.28,000 --> 0:06:11,000
will help reduce the stubbornly high rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion

111
0:06:12.12,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and allow men to equally participate

112
0:06:15.04,000 --> 0:06:16,000
in contraception.

113
0:06:17.04,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Thank you.

114
0:06:18.28,000 --> 0:06:22,000
(Applause)

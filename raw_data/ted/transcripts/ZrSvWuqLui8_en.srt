This is about a place in London

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
called Kiteflyer's Hill

3
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
where I used to go and spend hours

4
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
going "When is he coming back? When is he coming back?"

5
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
So this is another one dedicated to that guy ...

6
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
who I've got over.

7
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But this is "Kiteflyer's Hill."

8
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
It's a beautiful song written by a guy called Martin Evan,

9
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
actually, for me.

0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Boo Hewerdine, Thomas Dolby,

11
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
thank you very much for inviting me. It's been a blessing singing for you.

12
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Thank you very much.

13
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000

1
0:00:12.644,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm a professional troublemaker.

2
0:00:14.444,000 --> 0:00:15,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:16.349,000 --> 0:00:2,000
As my job is to critique the world,

4
0:00:22.058,000 --> 0:00:25,000
the shoddy systems and the people who refuse to do better,

5
0:00:25.991,000 --> 0:00:28,000
as a writer, as a speaker, as a shady Nigerian --

6
0:00:29.19,000 --> 0:00:3,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:30.239,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I feel like my purpose is to be this cat.

8
0:00:34.244,000 --> 0:00:36,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:36.419,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I am the person who is looking at other people,

10
0:00:39.099,000 --> 0:00:4,000
like, "I need you to fix it."

11
0:00:41.331,000 --> 0:00:42,000
That is me.

12
0:00:42.51,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I want us to leave this world better than we found it.

13
0:00:47.234,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And how I choose to effect change

14
0:00:50.024,000 --> 0:00:51,000
is by speaking up,

15
0:00:51.461,000 --> 0:00:53,000
by being the first and by being the domino.

16
0:00:55.245,000 --> 0:00:57,000
For a line of dominoes to fall,

17
0:00:57.323,000 --> 0:00:59,000
one has to fall first,

18
0:00:59.588,000 --> 0:01:01,000
which then leaves the other choiceless to do the same.

19
0:01:03.237,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And that domino that falls,

20
0:01:04.863,000 --> 0:01:06,000
we're hoping that, OK,

21
0:01:07.145,000 --> 0:01:1,000
the next person that sees this is inspired to be a domino.

22
0:01:12.115,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Being the domino, for me, looks like speaking up

23
0:01:15.327,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and doing the things that are really difficult,

24
0:01:17.588,000 --> 0:01:19,000
especially when they are needed,

25
0:01:19.707,000 --> 0:01:21,000
with the hope that others will follow suit.

26
0:01:23.041,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And here's the thing: I'm the person who says

27
0:01:25.624,000 --> 0:01:28,000
what you might be thinking but dared not to say.

28
0:01:29.105,000 --> 0:01:31,000
A lot of times people think that we're fearless,

29
0:01:31.896,000 --> 0:01:32,000
the people who do this, we're fearless.

30
0:01:33.898,000 --> 0:01:34,000
We're not fearless.

31
0:01:35.08,000 --> 0:01:37,000
We're not unafraid of the consequences

32
0:01:37.578,000 --> 0:01:39,000
or the sacrifices that we have to make

33
0:01:39.812,000 --> 0:01:4,000
by speaking truth to power.

34
0:01:41.832,000 --> 0:01:43,000
What happens is, we feel like we have to,

35
0:01:44.055,000 --> 0:01:46,000
because there are too few people in the world

36
0:01:46.682,000 --> 0:01:47,000
willing to be the domino,

37
0:01:48.333,000 --> 0:01:5,000
too few people willing to take that fall.

38
0:01:50.715,000 --> 0:01:51,000
We're not doing it without fear.

39
0:01:52.461,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Now, let's talk about fear.

40
0:01:54.406,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I knew exactly what I wanted to be when I grew up.

41
0:01:56.765,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I was like, "I'm going to be a doctor!"

42
0:01:58.727,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Doctor Luvvie was the dream.

43
0:02:00.876,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I was Doc McStuffins before it was a thing.

44
0:02:03.153,000 --> 0:02:04,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:04.376,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And I remember when I went to college,

46
0:02:06.607,000 --> 0:02:09,000
my freshman year, I had to take Chemistry 101

47
0:02:10.337,000 --> 0:02:11,000
for my premed major.

48
0:02:13.115,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I got the first and last D of my academic career.

49
0:02:16.207,000 --> 0:02:17,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:17.905,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So I went to my advisor, and I was like,

51
0:02:20.501,000 --> 0:02:22,000
"OK, let's drop the premed,

52
0:02:22.779,000 --> 0:02:24,000
because this doctor thing is not going to work,

53
0:02:25.026,000 --> 0:02:26,000
because I don't even like hospitals.

54
0:02:26.794,000 --> 0:02:27,000
So ..."

55
0:02:27.969,000 --> 0:02:28,000
(Laughter)

56
0:02:29.024,000 --> 0:02:31,000
"Let's just consider that done for."

57
0:02:31.728,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And that same semester, I started blogging.

58
0:02:34.172,000 --> 0:02:35,000
That was 2003.

59
0:02:35.625,000 --> 0:02:37,000
So as that one dream was ending, another was beginning.

60
0:02:38.508,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And then what was a cute hobby became my full-time job

61
0:02:42.101,000 --> 0:02:44,000
when I lost my marketing job in 2010.

62
0:02:45.02,000 --> 0:02:48,000
But it still took me two more years to say, "I'm a writer."

63
0:02:48.418,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Nine years after I had started writing, before I said, "I'm a writer,"

64
0:02:53.66,000 --> 0:02:55,000
because I was afraid of what happens

65
0:02:56.483,000 --> 0:02:58,000
without 401ks,

66
0:02:58.523,000 --> 0:03:,000
without, "How am I going to keep up my shoe habit?

67
0:03:01.055,000 --> 0:03:02,000
That's important to me."

68
0:03:02.245,000 --> 0:03:03,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:03.388,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So it took me that long to own this thing

70
0:03:06.407,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that was what my purpose was.

71
0:03:08.065,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And then I realized,

72
0:03:09.524,000 --> 0:03:11,000
fear has a very concrete power

73
0:03:11.858,000 --> 0:03:15,000
of keeping us from doing and saying the things that are our purpose.

74
0:03:16.822,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And I was like, "You know what?

75
0:03:18.52,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I'm not going to let fear rule my life.

76
0:03:21.146,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I'm not going to let fear dictate what I do."

77
0:03:24.592,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And then all of these awesome things started happening,

78
0:03:27.6,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and dominoes started to fall.

79
0:03:29.85,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So when I realized that, I was like, "OK, 2015,

80
0:03:32.553,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I turned 30,

81
0:03:33.842,000 --> 0:03:35,000
it's going to be my year of 'Do it anyway.'

82
0:03:36.054,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Anything that scares me, I'm going to actively pursue it."

83
0:03:39.667,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So, I'm a Capricorn.

84
0:03:41.881,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I like my feel solidly on the ground.

85
0:03:45.171,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I decided to take my first-ever solo vacation,

86
0:03:48.046,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and it was out of the country to the Dominican Republic.

87
0:03:51.827,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So on my birthday, what did I do?

88
0:03:54.446,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I went ziplining through the forests of Punta Cana.

89
0:03:57.681,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And for some odd reason, I had on business casual.

90
0:04:00.117,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Don't ask why.

91
0:04:01.323,000 --> 0:04:03,000
(Laughter)

92
0:04:03.549,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And I had an incredible time.

93
0:04:05.427,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Also, I don't like being submerged in water.

94
0:04:07.587,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I like to be, again, on solid ground.

95
0:04:09.965,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So I went to Mexico and swam with dolphins underwater.

96
0:04:15.24,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And then the cool thing that I did also that year

97
0:04:17.656,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that was my mountain

98
0:04:19.769,000 --> 0:04:2,000
was I wrote my book,

99
0:04:21.683,000 --> 0:04:23,000
"I'm Judging You: The Do-Better Manual,"

100
0:04:23.759,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And I had to own --

101
0:04:24.936,000 --> 0:04:25,000
(Applause)

102
0:04:25.974,000 --> 0:04:26,000
that whole writing thing now, right?

103
0:04:27.795,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Yes.

104
0:04:29.062,000 --> 0:04:32,000
But the very anti-me thing that I did that year

105
0:04:32.114,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that scared the crap out of me --

106
0:04:34.906,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I went skydiving.

107
0:04:37.539,000 --> 0:04:38,000
We're about to fall out of the plane.

108
0:04:39.371,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I was like, "I've done some stupid things in life. This is one of them."

109
0:04:42.855,000 --> 0:04:43,000
(Laughter)

110
0:04:43.882,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And then we come falling down to Earth,

111
0:04:45.83,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and I literally lose my breath as I see Earth, and I was like,

112
0:04:49.097,000 --> 0:04:51,000
"I just fell out of a perfectly good plane on purpose."

113
0:04:51.771,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Laughter)

114
0:04:52.819,000 --> 0:04:53,000
"What is wrong with me?!"

115
0:04:54.285,000 --> 0:04:55,000
But then I looked down at the beauty,

116
0:04:56.225,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and I was like, "This is the best thing I could have done.

117
0:04:58.999,000 --> 0:05:,000
This was an amazing decision."

118
0:05:01.256,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And I think about the times when I have to speak truth.

119
0:05:04.129,000 --> 0:05:07,000
It feels like I am falling out of that plane.

120
0:05:07.464,000 --> 0:05:09,000
It feels like that moment when I'm at the edge of the plane,

121
0:05:10.343,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and I'm like, "You shouldn't do this,"

122
0:05:12.23,000 --> 0:05:14,000
but then I do it anyway, because I realize I have to.

123
0:05:15.674,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Sitting at the edge of that plane

124
0:05:17.384,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and kind of staying on that plane is comfort to me.

125
0:05:20.202,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And I feel like every day that I'm speaking truth

126
0:05:22.535,000 --> 0:05:24,000
against institutions and people who are bigger than me

127
0:05:25.358,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and just forces that are more powerful than me,

128
0:05:27.711,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I feel like I'm falling out of that plane.

129
0:05:29.794,000 --> 0:05:31,000
But I realize comfort is overrated.

130
0:05:31.924,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Because being quiet is comfortable.

131
0:05:34.658,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Keeping things the way they've been is comfortable.

132
0:05:38.003,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And all comfort has done is maintain the status quo.

133
0:05:40.723,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So we've got to get comfortable with being uncomfortable

134
0:05:43.429,000 --> 0:05:45,000
by speaking these hard truths when they're necessary.

135
0:05:46.835,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And I --

136
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
(Applause)

137
0:05:51.355,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And for me, though, I realize that I have to speak these truths,

138
0:05:55.106,000 --> 0:05:56,000
because honesty is so important to me.

139
0:05:57.079,000 --> 0:05:59,000
My integrity is something I hold dear.

140
0:05:59.346,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Justice -- I don't think justice should be an option.

141
0:06:01.911,000 --> 0:06:02,000
We should always have justice.

142
0:06:03.415,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Also, I believe in shea butter as a core value, and --

143
0:06:06.777,000 --> 0:06:07,000
(Laughter)

144
0:06:08.099,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and I think the world would be better if we were more moisturized.

145
0:06:12.483,000 --> 0:06:14,000
But besides that, with these as my core values,

146
0:06:15.319,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I have to speak the truth.

147
0:06:16.618,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I have no other choice in the matter.

148
0:06:18.497,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But people like me, the professional troublemakers,

149
0:06:20.914,000 --> 0:06:23,000
should not be the only ones who are committed to being these dominoes

150
0:06:24.237,000 --> 0:06:25,000
who are always falling out of planes

151
0:06:25.998,000 --> 0:06:26,000
or being the first one to take this hit.

152
0:06:27.957,000 --> 0:06:29,000
People are so afraid of these acute consequences,

153
0:06:30.31,000 --> 0:06:33,000
not realizing that there are many times when we walk in rooms

154
0:06:33.386,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and we are some of the most powerful people in those rooms --

155
0:06:36.399,000 --> 0:06:38,000
we might be the second-most powerful, third-most powerful.

156
0:06:39.186,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And I firmly believe that our job in those times

157
0:06:42.067,000 --> 0:06:44,000
is to disrupt what is happening.

158
0:06:44.14,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And then if we're not the most powerful,

159
0:06:46.263,000 --> 0:06:48,000
if two more of us band together,

160
0:06:48.513,000 --> 0:06:49,000
it makes us powerful.

161
0:06:49.994,000 --> 0:06:51,000
It's like cosigning the woman in the meeting,

162
0:06:52.481,000 --> 0:06:54,000
you know, the woman who can't seem to get her word out,

163
0:06:55.4,000 --> 0:06:58,000
or just making sure that other person who can't make a point

164
0:06:58.828,000 --> 0:06:59,000
is being heard.

165
0:07:00.161,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Our job is to make sure they have room for that.

166
0:07:03.439,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Everyone's well-being is community business.

167
0:07:05.571,000 --> 0:07:07,000
If we made that a point, we'd understand that,

168
0:07:07.818,000 --> 0:07:08,000
for the times when we need help,

169
0:07:09.504,000 --> 0:07:1,000
we wouldn't have to look around so hard

170
0:07:11.479,000 --> 0:07:13,000
if we made sure we were somebody else's help.

171
0:07:14.313,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And there are times when I feel like

172
0:07:16.107,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I have taken very public tumbles and falls,

173
0:07:20.151,000 --> 0:07:22,000
like the time when I was asked to speak at a conference,

174
0:07:22.856,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and they wanted me to pay my way there.

175
0:07:26.341,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And then I did some research

176
0:07:27.728,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and found out the white men who spoke there got compensated

177
0:07:30.855,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and got their travel paid for.

178
0:07:32.776,000 --> 0:07:35,000
The white women who spoke there got their travel paid for.

179
0:07:35.824,000 --> 0:07:39,000
The black women who spoke there were expected to actually pay to speak there.

180
0:07:40.13,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And I was like, "What do I do?"

181
0:07:42.417,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And I knew that if I spoke up about this publicly,

182
0:07:45.182,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I could face financial loss.

183
0:07:47.159,000 --> 0:07:5,000
But then I also understood that my silence serves no one.

184
0:07:50.658,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So I fearfully spoke up about it publicly,

185
0:07:53.786,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and other women started coming out to talk about,

186
0:07:56.429,000 --> 0:07:58,000
"I, too, have faced this type of pay inequality."

187
0:07:59.005,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And it started a conversation about discriminatory pay practices

188
0:08:02.134,000 --> 0:08:04,000
that this conference was participating in.

189
0:08:04.673,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I felt like I was the domino

190
0:08:07.089,000 --> 0:08:09,000
the time I read a disturbing memoir by a public figure

191
0:08:09.836,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and wrote a piece about it.

192
0:08:11.651,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I knew this person was more powerful than me and could impact my career,

193
0:08:15.172,000 --> 0:08:16,000
but I was like, "I've got to do this.

194
0:08:17.014,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I've got to sit at the edge of this plane," maybe for two hours.

195
0:08:20.439,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And I did. And I pressed "Publish," and I ran away.

196
0:08:22.902,000 --> 0:08:23,000
(Laughter)

197
0:08:23.963,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And I came back to a viral post

198
0:08:25.899,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and people being like, "Oh my God, I'm so glad somebody finally said this."

199
0:08:29.525,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And it started a conversation

200
0:08:31.061,000 --> 0:08:33,000
about mental health and self-care,

201
0:08:33.877,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and I was like, "OK. Alright.

202
0:08:35.752,000 --> 0:08:38,000
This thing that I'm doing, I guess, alright, it's doing something."

203
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And then so many people have been the domino

204
0:08:43.422,000 --> 0:08:47,000
when they talk about how they've been assaulted by powerful men.

205
0:08:47.784,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And it's made millions of women join in and say, "Me Too."

206
0:08:52.23,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So, a shout-out to Tarana Burke for igniting that movement.

207
0:08:55.11,000 --> 0:09:01,000
(Applause)

208
0:09:01.759,000 --> 0:09:05,000
People and systems count on our silence to keep us exactly where we are.

209
0:09:08.006,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Now, being the domino sometimes comes down to being exactly who you are.

210
0:09:14.241,000 --> 0:09:16,000
So, I've been a shady somebody since I was three.

211
0:09:17.199,000 --> 0:09:18,000
(Laughter)

212
0:09:18.302,000 --> 0:09:19,000
This is me on my third birthday.

213
0:09:20.923,000 --> 0:09:22,000
But I've been this girl all my life,

214
0:09:23.291,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and I feel like even that's been the domino,

215
0:09:25.384,000 --> 0:09:27,000
because in a world that wants us to walk around

216
0:09:27.708,000 --> 0:09:28,000
as representatives of ourselves,

217
0:09:29.572,000 --> 0:09:31,000
being yourself can be a revolutionary act.

218
0:09:32.428,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And in a world that wants us to whisper,

219
0:09:34.805,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I choose to yell.

220
0:09:37.001,000 --> 0:09:41,000
(Applause)

221
0:09:42.011,000 --> 0:09:44,000
When it's time to say these hard things,

222
0:09:44.436,000 --> 0:09:45,000
I ask myself three things.

223
0:09:46.098,000 --> 0:09:47,000
One: Did you mean it?

224
0:09:48.509,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Two: Can you defend it?

225
0:09:51.221,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Three: Did you say it with love?

226
0:09:53.368,000 --> 0:09:55,000
If the answer is yes to all three,

227
0:09:55.624,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I say it and let the chips fall.

228
0:09:59.545,000 --> 0:10:,000
That's important.

229
0:10:00.72,000 --> 0:10:01,000
That checkpoint with myself

230
0:10:02.269,000 --> 0:10:04,000
always tells me, "Yes, you're supposed to do this."

231
0:10:06.595,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Telling the truth -- telling thoughtful truths --

232
0:10:09.004,000 --> 0:10:1,000
should not be a revolutionary act.

233
0:10:12.267,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Speaking truths to power should not be sacrificial, but they are.

234
0:10:16.37,000 --> 0:10:19,000
But I think if more of us chose to do this for the greater good,

235
0:10:19.582,000 --> 0:10:21,000
we'd be in better spaces than we are right now.

236
0:10:23.259,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Speaking of the greater good,

237
0:10:25.438,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I think we commit ourselves to telling truths to build bridges

238
0:10:28.894,000 --> 0:10:29,000
to common ground,

239
0:10:30.395,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and bridges that aren't based on truth will collapse.

240
0:10:33.631,000 --> 0:10:34,000
So it is our job,

241
0:10:35.516,000 --> 0:10:38,000
it is our obligation, it is our duty

242
0:10:38.868,000 --> 0:10:4,000
to speak truth to power, to be the domino,

243
0:10:41.883,000 --> 0:10:42,000
not just when it's difficult --

244
0:10:43.526,000 --> 0:10:44,000
especially when it's difficult.

245
0:10:45.539,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Thank you.

246
0:10:46.757,000 --> 0:10:52,000
(Applause)

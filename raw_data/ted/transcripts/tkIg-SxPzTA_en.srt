1
0:00:12.8,000 --> 0:00:13,000
In the year 1901,

2
0:00:14.64,000 --> 0:00:17,000
a woman called Auguste was taken to a medical asylum in Frankfurt.

3
0:00:18.96,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Auguste was delusional

4
0:00:20.52,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and couldn't remember even the most basic details of her life.

5
0:00:24.28,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Her doctor was called Alois.

6
0:00:27.84,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Alois didn't know how to help Auguste,

7
0:00:30.12,000 --> 0:00:33,000
but he watched over her until, sadly, she passed away in 1906.

8
0:00:34.52,000 --> 0:00:36,000
After she died, Alois performed an autopsy

9
0:00:37.28,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and found strange plaques and tangles in Auguste's brain --

10
0:00:40.52,000 --> 0:00:42,000
the likes of which he'd never seen before.

11
0:00:42.88,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Now here's the even more striking thing.

12
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:48,000
If Auguste had instead been alive today,

13
0:00:49.52,000 --> 0:00:54,000
we could offer her no more help than Alois was able to 114 years ago.

14
0:00:56.08,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Alois was Dr. Alois Alzheimer.

15
0:01:00.52,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And Auguste Deter

16
0:01:02.68,000 --> 0:01:06,000
was the first patient to be diagnosed with what we now call Alzheimer's disease.

17
0:01:07.68,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Since 1901, medicine has advanced greatly.

18
0:01:11.2,000 --> 0:01:14,000
We've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infections,

19
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
many treatments for cancer, antiretrovirals for HIV,

20
0:01:19.04,000 --> 0:01:21,000
statins for heart disease and much more.

21
0:01:22.896,000 --> 0:01:28,000
But we've made essentially no progress at all in treating Alzheimer's disease.

22
0:01:30.44,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I'm part of a team of scientists

23
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:35,000
who has been working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for over a decade.

24
0:01:35.8,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So I think about this all the time.

25
0:01:38.28,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million people worldwide.

26
0:01:42.36,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million people --

27
0:01:48.36,000 --> 0:01:51,000
which, by the way, will include many of you.

28
0:01:53.04,000 --> 0:01:56,000
If you're hoping to live to be 85 or older,

29
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
your chance of getting Alzheimer's will be almost one in two.

30
0:02:03.6,000 --> 0:02:06,000
In other words, odds are you'll spend your golden years

31
0:02:06.84,000 --> 0:02:08,000
either suffering from Alzheimer's

32
0:02:09.08,000 --> 0:02:13,000
or helping to look after a friend or loved one with Alzheimer's.

33
0:02:14.48,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Already in the United States alone,

34
0:02:16.48,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.

35
0:02:21.919,000 --> 0:02:25,000
One out of every five Medicare dollars get spent on Alzheimer's.

36
0:02:26.68,000 --> 0:02:29,000
It is today the most expensive disease,

37
0:02:29.84,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and costs are projected to increase fivefold by 2050,

38
0:02:33.08,000 --> 0:02:35,000
as the baby boomer generation ages.

39
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:39,000
It may surprise you that, put simply,

40
0:02:39.4,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation.

41
0:02:44.76,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But we've done relatively little to address it.

42
0:02:47.96,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Today, of the top 10 causes of death worldwide,

43
0:02:51.88,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Alzheimer's is the only one we cannot prevent, cure or even slow down.

44
0:02:59.8,000 --> 0:03:02,000
We understand less about the science of Alzheimer's than other diseases

45
0:03:03.52,000 --> 0:03:06,000
because we've invested less time and money into researching it.

46
0:03:07.24,000 --> 0:03:11,000
The US government spends 10 times more every year

47
0:03:11.4,000 --> 0:03:13,000
on cancer research than on Alzheimer's

48
0:03:14.4,000 --> 0:03:17,000
despite the fact that Alzheimer's costs us more

49
0:03:18.12,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and causes a similar number of deaths each year as cancer.

50
0:03:23.88,000 --> 0:03:26,000
The lack of resources stems from a more fundamental cause:

51
0:03:27.64,000 --> 0:03:28,000
a lack of awareness.

52
0:03:30.6,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Because here's what few people know but everyone should:

53
0:03:35.36,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can cure it.

54
0:03:40.32,000 --> 0:03:42,000
For most of the past 114 years,

55
0:03:42.88,000 --> 0:03:47,000
everyone, including scientists, mistakenly confused Alzheimer's with aging.

56
0:03:48.36,000 --> 0:03:49,000
We thought that becoming senile

57
0:03:49.861,000 --> 0:03:51,000
was a normal and inevitable part of getting old.

58
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:55,000
But we only have to look at a picture

59
0:03:55.04,000 --> 0:03:58,000
of a healthy aged brain compared to the brain of an Alzheimer's patient

60
0:03:58.92,000 --> 0:04:01,000
to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.

61
0:04:02.96,000 --> 0:04:05,000
As well as triggering severe loss of memory and mental abilities,

62
0:04:06.84,000 --> 0:04:08,000
the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's

63
0:04:09.08,000 --> 0:04:13,000
significantly reduces life expectancy and is always fatal.

64
0:04:14.48,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Remember Dr. Alzheimer found strange plaques and tangles

65
0:04:17.56,000 --> 0:04:19,000
in Auguste's brain a century ago.

66
0:04:20.28,000 --> 0:04:23,000
For almost a century, we didn't know much about these.

67
0:04:24.24,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Today we know they're made from protein molecules.

68
0:04:27.64,000 --> 0:04:28,000
You can imagine a protein molecule

69
0:04:29.32,000 --> 0:04:33,000
as a piece of paper that normally folds into an elaborate piece of origami.

70
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
There are spots on the paper that are sticky.

71
0:04:36.6,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And when it folds correctly, these sticky bits end up on the inside.

72
0:04:41.56,000 --> 0:04:45,000
But sometimes things go wrong, and some sticky bits are on the outside.

73
0:04:46.04,000 --> 0:04:49,000
This causes the protein molecules to stick to each other,

74
0:04:49.08,000 --> 0:04:52,000
forming clumps that eventually become large plaques and tangles.

75
0:04:53.68,000 --> 0:04:55,000
That's what we see in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.

76
0:04:57.24,000 --> 0:05:,000
We've spent the past 10 years at the University of Cambridge

77
0:05:00.36,000 --> 0:05:02,000
trying to understand how this malfunction works.

78
0:05:03.8,000 --> 0:05:07,000
There are many steps, and identifying which step to try to block is complex --

79
0:05:08.52,000 --> 0:05:09,000
like defusing a bomb.

80
0:05:10.6,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Cutting one wire might do nothing.

81
0:05:12.72,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Cutting others might make the bomb explore.

82
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
We have to find the right step to block,

83
0:05:18.36,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and then create a drug that does it.

84
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Until recently, we for the most part

85
0:05:23.08,000 --> 0:05:25,000
have been cutting wires and hoping for the best.

86
0:05:25.56,000 --> 0:05:27,000
But now we've got together a diverse group of people --

87
0:05:28.44,000 --> 0:05:33,000
medics, biologists, geneticists, chemists, physicists, engineers and mathematicians.

88
0:05:34.04,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process

89
0:05:38.28,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and are now testing a new class of drugs which would specifically block this step

90
0:05:42.52,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and stop the disease.

91
0:05:44.36,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Now let me show you some of our latest results.

92
0:05:46.88,000 --> 0:05:48,000
No one outside of our lab has seen these yet.

93
0:05:49.56,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Let's look at some videos of what happened when we tested these new drugs in worms.

94
0:05:54.56,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So these are healthy worms,

95
0:05:56.44,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and you can see they're moving around normally.

96
0:05:59.56,000 --> 0:06:01,000
These worms, on the other hand,

97
0:06:02.48,000 --> 0:06:05,000
have protein molecules sticking together inside them --

98
0:06:05.6,000 --> 0:06:06,000
like humans with Alzheimer's.

99
0:06:07.24,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And you can see they're clearly sick.

100
0:06:09.56,000 --> 0:06:13,000
But if we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage,

101
0:06:14.56,000 --> 0:06:17,000
then we see that they're healthy, and they live a normal lifespan.

102
0:06:19.2,000 --> 0:06:22,000
This is just an initial positive result, but research like this

103
0:06:22.88,000 --> 0:06:26,000
shows us that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and we can cure.

104
0:06:27.64,000 --> 0:06:29,000
After 114 years of waiting,

105
0:06:30.56,000 --> 0:06:32,000
there's finally real hope for what can be achieved

106
0:06:32.96,000 --> 0:06:33,000
in the next 10 or 20 years.

107
0:06:36.04,000 --> 0:06:4,000
But to grow that hope, to finally beat Alzheimer's, we need help.

108
0:06:40.92,000 --> 0:06:41,000
This isn't about scientists like me --

109
0:06:42.8,000 --> 0:06:43,000
it's about you.

110
0:06:44.6,000 --> 0:06:47,000
We need you to raise awareness that Alzheimer's is a disease

111
0:06:48.2,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and that if we try, we can beat it.

112
0:06:50.84,000 --> 0:06:51,000
In the case of other diseases,

113
0:06:52.68,000 --> 0:06:55,000
patients and their families have led the charge for more research

114
0:06:55.84,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and put pressure on governments, the pharmaceutical industry,

115
0:06:58.8,000 --> 0:07:,000
scientists and regulators.

116
0:07:01.04,000 --> 0:07:05,000
That was essential for advancing treatment for HIV in the late 1980s.

117
0:07:05.92,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Today, we see that same drive to beat cancer.

118
0:07:10.32,000 --> 0:07:14,000
But Alzheimer's patients are often unable to speak up for themselves.

119
0:07:14.68,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And their families, the hidden victims, caring for their loved ones night and day,

120
0:07:19.44,000 --> 0:07:22,000
are often too worn out to go out and advocate for change.

121
0:07:23.32,000 --> 0:07:26,000
So, it really is down to you.

122
0:07:27.72,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Alzheimer's isn't, for the most part, a genetic disease.

123
0:07:31.08,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Everyone with a brain is at risk.

124
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Today, there are 40 million patients like Auguste,

125
0:07:38.68,000 --> 0:07:4,000
who can't create the change they need for themselves.

126
0:07:41.6,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Help speak up for them,

127
0:07:44.08,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and help demand a cure.

128
0:07:47.346,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Thank you.

129
0:07:48.52,000 --> 0:07:51,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.002,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I am guilty of stacking my dishes in the sink

2
0:00:15.861,000 --> 0:00:16,000
and leaving them there for hours.

3
0:00:18.518,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I fact-checked this with my boyfriend.

4
0:00:20.624,000 --> 0:00:22,000
He says it's less like hours and more like days,

5
0:00:23.275,000 --> 0:00:24,000
but that's not the point.

6
0:00:25.035,000 --> 0:00:27,000
The point is sometimes I don't finish the job

7
0:00:27.933,000 --> 0:00:3,000
until the stack has gotten high enough that it's peaking over the lip of the sink

8
0:00:31.767,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and my inner clean freak loses it.

9
0:00:34.73,000 --> 0:00:36,000
This charming habit developed when I was in college,

10
0:00:37.196,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and I had tons of excuses.

11
0:00:39.117,000 --> 0:00:4,000
"I'm running to class!"

12
0:00:40.513,000 --> 0:00:42,000
"What's one more dirty dish in the sink?"

13
0:00:42.628,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Or my favorite, "I think I can save time and water

14
0:00:46.208,000 --> 0:00:48,000
if I do them all together later."

15
0:00:48.534,000 --> 0:00:49,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:49.622,000 --> 0:00:52,000
But it's not like I needed those excuses, because nobody was calling me on it.

17
0:00:54.132,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I wish they had.

18
0:00:55.673,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I look back now

19
0:00:56.848,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and realize that every time I didn't put a dish in the dishwasher

20
0:00:59.921,000 --> 0:01:,000
and finish what I started,

21
0:01:01.214,000 --> 0:01:02,000
it became more second nature to me,

22
0:01:03.17,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and I grew less likely to question why I was doing it.

23
0:01:06.352,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Today, I'm a 30-something, certified dirty-dish leaver,

24
0:01:10.408,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and breaking this habit is hard.

25
0:01:13.497,000 --> 0:01:15,000
So when I'm not at home avoiding the sink,

26
0:01:16.3,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I work with large, complex organizations on leadership transformation

27
0:01:20.207,000 --> 0:01:21,000
in times of change.

28
0:01:21.834,000 --> 0:01:24,000
My job is to work with the most senior leaders

29
0:01:25.042,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to examine how they lead today

30
0:01:26.629,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and establish habits better suited for the future.

31
0:01:30.293,000 --> 0:01:32,000
But what interests me more than senior leaders these days

32
0:01:33.143,000 --> 0:01:34,000
is what's going on with the junior ones.

33
0:01:35.701,000 --> 0:01:36,000
We call them "middle managers,"

34
0:01:37.474,000 --> 0:01:38,000
but it's a term I wish we could change

35
0:01:39.364,000 --> 0:01:42,000
because what they are is our pipeline of future talent for the C-suite,

36
0:01:42.993,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and they are starting to leave their dishes in the sink.

37
0:01:46.353,000 --> 0:01:48,000
While organizations are hiring people like me

38
0:01:48.979,000 --> 0:01:5,000
to redevelop their senior leaders for the future,

39
0:01:51.796,000 --> 0:01:54,000
outdated leadership habits are forming right before our eyes

40
0:01:55.213,000 --> 0:01:57,000
among the middle managers who will one day take their place.

41
0:01:59.488,000 --> 0:02:03,000
We need middle managers and senior leaders to work together,

42
0:02:03.776,000 --> 0:02:05,000
because this is a big problem.

43
0:02:05.826,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Organizations are evolving rapidly,

44
0:02:09.24,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and they're counting on their future leaders

45
0:02:11.319,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to lead with more speed, flexibility, trust and cooperation than they do today.

46
0:02:18.622,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I believe there is a window of time in the formative middle-manager years

47
0:02:22.13,000 --> 0:02:24,000
when we can lay the groundwork for that kind of leadership,

48
0:02:24.917,000 --> 0:02:25,000
but we're missing it.

49
0:02:26.297,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Why?

50
0:02:27.56,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Because our future leaders are learning from senior role models

51
0:02:30.688,000 --> 0:02:32,000
who just aren't ready to role model yet,

52
0:02:32.805,000 --> 0:02:35,000
much less change the systems that made them so successful.

53
0:02:37.637,000 --> 0:02:39,000
We need middle managers and senior leaders to work together

54
0:02:40.438,000 --> 0:02:41,000
to define a new way of leading

55
0:02:42.003,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and develop each other to rise to the occasion.

56
0:02:45.946,000 --> 0:02:46,000
One of my favorite senior clients --

57
0:02:47.798,000 --> 0:02:48,000
we'll call her Jane --

58
0:02:49.074,000 --> 0:02:52,000
is a poster child for what's old-fashioned in leadership today.

59
0:02:52.88,000 --> 0:02:54,000
She rose to her C-level position

60
0:02:55.057,000 --> 0:02:57,000
based on exceptional individual performance.

61
0:02:57.875,000 --> 0:03:,000
Come hell or high water, Jane got the job done,

62
0:03:01.001,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and today, she leads like it.

63
0:03:03.545,000 --> 0:03:04,000
She is tough to please,

64
0:03:05.149,000 --> 0:03:08,000
she doesn't have a lot of time for things that's aren't mission-critical,

65
0:03:08.641,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and she really doesn't trust anyone's judgment more than her own.

66
0:03:11.738,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Needless to say, Jane's in behavior boot camp.

67
0:03:15.693,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Those deeply ingrained habits

68
0:03:17.416,000 --> 0:03:2,000
are deeply inconsistent with where her organization is heading.

69
0:03:21.348,000 --> 0:03:23,000
The command-and-control behavior that she was once rewarded for

70
0:03:24.326,000 --> 0:03:25,000
just isn't going to work

71
0:03:25.991,000 --> 0:03:29,000
in a faster-moving, flatter, more digitally interconnected organization.

72
0:03:30.446,000 --> 0:03:32,000
What got her here won't get her there.

73
0:03:34.348,000 --> 0:03:35,000
But I want to talk about John,

74
0:03:35.836,000 --> 0:03:38,000
a supertalented, up-and-coming manager who works for Jane,

75
0:03:39.019,000 --> 0:03:41,000
because her habits are rubbing off on him.

76
0:03:41.968,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Recently, he and I were strategizing

77
0:03:44.2,000 --> 0:03:47,000
about a decision we needed to put in front of the CEO, Jane's boss,

78
0:03:47.581,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and the rest of Jane's peers.

79
0:03:49.771,000 --> 0:03:52,000
He said to me, "Liz, you're not going to like this,

80
0:03:52.982,000 --> 0:03:54,000
but the way decisions get made around here

81
0:03:55.086,000 --> 0:03:57,000
is with a bunch of meetings before the meeting."

82
0:03:58.223,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I counted.

83
0:03:59.626,000 --> 0:04:02,000
That was going to mean eight one-on-ones, exec by exec,

84
0:04:03.221,000 --> 0:04:05,000
to make sure each one of them was individually on board enough

85
0:04:06.213,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that things would go smoothly in the actual meeting.

86
0:04:10.356,000 --> 0:04:13,000
He promised, "It's not how we'll do things in the future,

87
0:04:13.405,000 --> 0:04:14,000
but it's how we have to do them today."

88
0:04:16.504,000 --> 0:04:17,000
John wasn't wrong on either count.

89
0:04:19.061,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Meetings before the meeting are a necessary evil

90
0:04:21.324,000 --> 0:04:22,000
in his company today,

91
0:04:22.499,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and I didn't like it at all.

92
0:04:24.739,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Sure, it was going to be inefficient and annoying,

93
0:04:28.172,000 --> 0:04:3,000
but what bothered me most was his confidence

94
0:04:30.38,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that it's not how they'll do things in the future.

95
0:04:33.323,000 --> 0:04:34,000
How could he be sure?

96
0:04:35.263,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Who was going to change it and when, if it wasn't him and now?

97
0:04:39.994,000 --> 0:04:4,000
What would the trigger be?

98
0:04:41.373,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And when it happened,

99
0:04:42.64,000 --> 0:04:45,000
would he even know how to have effective meetings without pre-meetings?

100
0:04:47.233,000 --> 0:04:49,000
He was confidently implying that when he's the boss,

101
0:04:49.731,000 --> 0:04:51,000
he'll change the rules and do things differently,

102
0:04:52.263,000 --> 0:04:54,000
but all I could see were dishes stacking in the sink

103
0:04:55.28,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and a guy with a lot of good excuses.

104
0:04:57.793,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Worse, a guy who might be out of a job one day

105
0:05:00.746,000 --> 0:05:02,000
because he learned too late how to lead

106
0:05:02.972,000 --> 0:05:03,000
in the organizations of tomorrow.

107
0:05:07.141,000 --> 0:05:08,000
These stories really get to me

108
0:05:09.05,000 --> 0:05:12,000
when it's the fast-track, high-potential managers like John

109
0:05:12.22,000 --> 0:05:15,000
because they're probably the most capable of making waves

110
0:05:15.479,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and redefining how leaders lead from the inside.

111
0:05:18.472,000 --> 0:05:22,000
But what we find is that they're often doing the best job at not rocking the boat

112
0:05:22.885,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and challenging the system

113
0:05:25.114,000 --> 0:05:26,000
because they're trying to impress

114
0:05:26.758,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and make life easier on the senior leaders who will promote them.

115
0:05:30.515,000 --> 0:05:32,000
As someone who also likes to get promoted,

116
0:05:32.731,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I can hardly blame him.

117
0:05:34.251,000 --> 0:05:35,000
It's a catch-22.

118
0:05:36.617,000 --> 0:05:37,000
But they're also so self-assured

119
0:05:38.572,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that they'll be able to change their behavior

120
0:05:40.755,000 --> 0:05:42,000
once they've earned the authority to do things differently,

121
0:05:43.542,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and that is a trap.

122
0:05:45.339,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Because if I've learned anything from working with Jane,

123
0:05:47.984,000 --> 0:05:48,000
it's that when that day comes,

124
0:05:49.62,000 --> 0:05:51,000
John will wonder how he could possibly do anything differently

125
0:05:52.621,000 --> 0:05:55,000
in his high-stakes, high-pressure executive job

126
0:05:55.751,000 --> 0:05:58,000
without risking his own success and the organization's,

127
0:05:59.331,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and he'll wish it didn't feel so safe and so easy

128
0:06:03.152,000 --> 0:06:05,000
to keep doing things the way they've always been done.

129
0:06:07.353,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So the leadership development expert in me asks:

130
0:06:10.37,000 --> 0:06:12,000
How can we better intervene in the formative years

131
0:06:13.24,000 --> 0:06:14,000
of our soon-to-be senior leaders?

132
0:06:15.825,000 --> 0:06:18,000
How can we use the fact that John and his peers want to take charge

133
0:06:19.547,000 --> 0:06:2,000
of their professional destinies

134
0:06:21.237,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and get them ready to lead the organizations of the future,

135
0:06:24.288,000 --> 0:06:26,000
rather than let them succumb to the catch-22

136
0:06:27.179,000 --> 0:06:31,000
that will perfectly prepare them to lead the organizations of the past?

137
0:06:32.956,000 --> 0:06:35,000
We'll have to start by coming to terms with a very real paradox,

138
0:06:36.077,000 --> 0:06:37,000
which is this:

139
0:06:37.391,000 --> 0:06:39,000
the best form of learning happens on the job --

140
0:06:39.815,000 --> 0:06:41,000
not in a classroom, not via e-modules.

141
0:06:43.028,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And the two things we rely on to shape on-the-job learning

142
0:06:46.306,000 --> 0:06:48,000
are role models and work environments.

143
0:06:49.559,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And as we just talked about,

144
0:06:51.023,000 --> 0:06:54,000
our role models are in behavior boot camp right now,

145
0:06:54.689,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and our work environments are undergoing unprecedented disruption.

146
0:06:58.877,000 --> 0:07:01,000
We are systematically changing just about everything

147
0:07:02.137,000 --> 0:07:04,000
about how organizations work,

148
0:07:04.2,000 --> 0:07:07,000
but by and large, still measuring and rewarding behavior

149
0:07:07.538,000 --> 0:07:08,000
based on old metrics,

150
0:07:09.331,000 --> 0:07:11,000
because changing those systems takes time.

151
0:07:12.113,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So, if we can't fully count on role models or the system right now,

152
0:07:17.92,000 --> 0:07:2,000
it's on John to not miss this critical development window.

153
0:07:21.817,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Yes, he'll need Jane's help to do it,

154
0:07:24.405,000 --> 0:07:27,000
but the responsibility is his because the risks are actually his.

155
0:07:28.582,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Either he inherits an organization that is failing

156
0:07:31.945,000 --> 0:07:33,000
because of stubbornly old-fashioned leadership,

157
0:07:34.691,000 --> 0:07:37,000
or he himself fails to build the capabilities to lead one

158
0:07:38.362,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that transformed while he was playing it safe.

159
0:07:42.677,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So now the question is, where does John start?

160
0:07:47.114,000 --> 0:07:5,000
If I were John, I'd ask to start flying the plane.

161
0:07:51.474,000 --> 0:07:54,000
For my 13th birthday, my grandpa, a former Navy pilot,

162
0:07:54.889,000 --> 0:07:57,000
gave me the gift of being able to fly a very small plane.

163
0:07:59.433,000 --> 0:08:,000
Once we were safely airborne,

164
0:08:01.4,000 --> 0:08:03,000
the pilot turned over the controls, folded his hands,

165
0:08:04.229,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and he let me fly.

166
0:08:07.016,000 --> 0:08:08,000
It was totally terrifying.

167
0:08:09.215,000 --> 0:08:13,000
It was exhilarating, but it was also on-the-job learning with a safety net.

168
0:08:14.106,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And because it was real,

169
0:08:15.817,000 --> 0:08:17,000
I really learned how to do it myself.

170
0:08:19.017,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Likewise, in the workplace, every meeting to be led,

171
0:08:22.422,000 --> 0:08:23,000
every decision to be made

172
0:08:23.943,000 --> 0:08:24,000
can be a practice flight

173
0:08:25.378,000 --> 0:08:27,000
for someone who could really use the learning experience

174
0:08:28.023,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and the chance to figure out how to do it their own way.

175
0:08:31.412,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So instead of caving, John needs to knock on Jane's door,

176
0:08:35.424,000 --> 0:08:36,000
propose a creative strategy

177
0:08:37.099,000 --> 0:08:4,000
for having the meeting without the eight pre-meetings,

178
0:08:40.387,000 --> 0:08:42,000
show her he's thought through the trade-offs

179
0:08:43.123,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and ask for her support to do it differently.

180
0:08:47.117,000 --> 0:08:48,000
This isn't going to be easy for Jane.

181
0:08:49.772,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Not only does she need to trust John,

182
0:08:52.596,000 --> 0:08:57,000
she needs to accept that with a little bit of room to try his hand at leading,

183
0:08:58.113,000 --> 0:09:,000
John will inevitably start leading in some ways

184
0:09:00.708,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that are far more John than Jane.

185
0:09:04.589,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And this won't be an indictment of her.

186
0:09:06.85,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Rather, it will be individualism.

187
0:09:08.979,000 --> 0:09:09,000
It will be progress.

188
0:09:10.349,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And it might even be a chance for Jane to learn a thing or two

189
0:09:13.392,000 --> 0:09:15,000
to take her own leadership game to the next level.

190
0:09:17.678,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I work with another senior client who summed up this dilemma beautifully

191
0:09:21.083,000 --> 0:09:23,000
when we were talking about why he and his peers

192
0:09:23.313,000 --> 0:09:26,000
haven't empowered the folks below them with more decision rights.

193
0:09:26.742,000 --> 0:09:27,000
He said,

194
0:09:28.925,000 --> 0:09:3,000
"We haven't done it because we just don't trust

195
0:09:31.141,000 --> 0:09:33,000
that they're going to make the right decisions.

196
0:09:33.61,000 --> 0:09:34,000
But then again, how could they?

197
0:09:35.365,000 --> 0:09:37,000
We've just never given them decisions to practice with."

198
0:09:39.162,000 --> 0:09:42,000
So I'm not advocating that Jane hands over the controls

199
0:09:42.557,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and folds her hands indefinitely,

200
0:09:44.671,000 --> 0:09:45,000
but what I am saying

201
0:09:45.872,000 --> 0:09:47,000
is that if she doesn't engineer learning and practice

202
0:09:48.468,000 --> 0:09:5,000
right into John's day today,

203
0:09:50.855,000 --> 0:09:52,000
he'll never be able to do what she does,

204
0:09:53.205,000 --> 0:09:55,000
much less do it any differently than she does it.

205
0:09:57.534,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Finally, since we're going to be pushing both of them outside their comfort zones,

206
0:10:01.639,000 --> 0:10:02,000
we need some outside coaches

207
0:10:03.077,000 --> 0:10:06,000
to make sure this isn't a case of the blind leading the blind.

208
0:10:06.65,000 --> 0:10:08,000
But what if instead of using coaches

209
0:10:09.119,000 --> 0:10:12,000
to coach each one of them to individually be more effective,

210
0:10:12.532,000 --> 0:10:14,000
we started coaching the interactions between them?

211
0:10:16.114,000 --> 0:10:18,000
If I could wave my magic wand,

212
0:10:18.311,000 --> 0:10:2,000
I would have coaches sitting in the occasional team meeting

213
0:10:21.098,000 --> 0:10:22,000
of Jane and her direct reports,

214
0:10:22.986,000 --> 0:10:25,000
debriefing solely on how well they cooperated that day.

215
0:10:27.646,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I would put a coach in the periodic feedback session between Jane and John,

216
0:10:32.459,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and just like a couples' therapist coaches on communication,

217
0:10:35.619,000 --> 0:10:37,000
they would offer advice and observations

218
0:10:37.777,000 --> 0:10:39,000
on how that conversation can go better in the future.

219
0:10:41.021,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Was Jane simply reinforcing what Jane would have done?

220
0:10:44.089,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Or was Jane really helping John

221
0:10:45.763,000 --> 0:10:47,000
think through what to do for the organization?

222
0:10:49.174,000 --> 0:10:51,000
That is seriously hard mentorship to provide,

223
0:10:51.734,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and even the best leaders need help doing it,

224
0:10:54.244,000 --> 0:10:57,000
which is why we need more coaches coaching more leaders,

225
0:10:57.572,000 --> 0:10:58,000
more in real time

226
0:10:59.151,000 --> 0:11:01,000
versus any one leader behind closed doors.

227
0:11:03.649,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Around 20 years ago, Warren Buffet gave a school lecture

228
0:11:07.185,000 --> 0:11:11,000
in which he said, "The chains of habit are too light to be felt

229
0:11:11.728,000 --> 0:11:13,000
until they're too heavy to be broken."

230
0:11:15.061,000 --> 0:11:16,000
I couldn't agree more,

231
0:11:16.57,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and I see it happening with our future leaders in training.

232
0:11:20.74,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Can we and they be doing more to build their leadership capabilities

233
0:11:25.357,000 --> 0:11:27,000
while they're still open, eager

234
0:11:27.584,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and not too far gone down a path of bad habits we totally saw coming?

235
0:11:33.377,000 --> 0:11:36,000
I wish my college roommates and I called each other out back then

236
0:11:36.494,000 --> 0:11:37,000
for the dishes.

237
0:11:37.759,000 --> 0:11:4,000
It would have been so much easier to nip that habit in the bud

238
0:11:41.566,000 --> 0:11:42,000
than it is to change it today.

239
0:11:43.841,000 --> 0:11:46,000
But I still believe in a future for myself full of gleaming sinks

240
0:11:47.61,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and busy dishwashers,

241
0:11:48.999,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and so we're working on it,

242
0:11:50.391,000 --> 0:11:53,000
every day, together, moment to moment,

243
0:11:53.644,000 --> 0:11:54,000
one dirty dish at a time.

244
0:11:56,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Thank you.

245
0:11:57.175,000 --> 0:12:01,000
(Applause)

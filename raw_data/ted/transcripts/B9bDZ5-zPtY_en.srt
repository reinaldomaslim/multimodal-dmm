1
0:00:17.617,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Good afternoon.

2
0:00:19.489,000 --> 0:00:21,000
There's a medical revolution happening all around us,

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and it's one that's going to help us conquer

4
0:00:24.38,000 --> 0:00:26,000
some of society's most dreaded conditions,

5
0:00:26.404,000 --> 0:00:27,000
including cancer.

6
0:00:28.523,000 --> 0:00:31,000
The revolution is called angiogenesis,

7
0:00:31.919,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and it's based on the process that our bodies use to grow blood vessels.

8
0:00:36.531,000 --> 0:00:38,000
So why should we care about blood vessels?

9
0:00:38.61,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Well, the human body is literally packed with them --

10
0:00:41.442,000 --> 0:00:43,000
60,000 miles worth in a typical adult.

11
0:00:44.91,000 --> 0:00:47,000
End to end, that would form a line that would circle the earth twice.

12
0:00:49.339,000 --> 0:00:51,000
The smallest blood vessels are called capillaries.

13
0:00:52.07,000 --> 0:00:55,000
We've got 19 billion of them in our bodies.

14
0:00:55.637,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And these are the vessels of life,

15
0:00:58.444,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and as I'll show you, they can also be the vessels of death.

16
0:01:03.279,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Now, the remarkable thing about blood vessels

17
0:01:05.461,000 --> 0:01:06,000
is that they have this ability

18
0:01:07.342,000 --> 0:01:09,000
to adapt to whatever environment they're growing in.

19
0:01:10.079,000 --> 0:01:13,000
For example, in the liver, they form channels to detoxify the blood;

20
0:01:13.36,000 --> 0:01:15,000
in the lungs, they line air sacs for gas exchange.

21
0:01:16.115,000 --> 0:01:17,000
In muscle, they corkscrew,

22
0:01:17.878,000 --> 0:01:2,000
so that muscles can contract without cutting off circulation.

23
0:01:21.138,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And in nerves, they course along like power lines,

24
0:01:23.685,000 --> 0:01:24,000
keeping those nerves alive.

25
0:01:25.709,000 --> 0:01:27,000
We get most of these blood vessels

26
0:01:27.764,000 --> 0:01:28,000
when we're actually still in the womb.

27
0:01:30.026,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And what that means is that as adults,

28
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
blood vessels don't normally grow.

29
0:01:34.531,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Except in a few special circumstances.

30
0:01:38.047,000 --> 0:01:4,000
In women, blood vessels grow every month,

31
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
to build the lining of the uterus.

32
0:01:42.101,000 --> 0:01:44,000
During pregnancy, they form the placenta,

33
0:01:44.552,000 --> 0:01:46,000
which connects mom and baby.

34
0:01:47.289,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And after injury, blood vessels actually have to grow under the scab

35
0:01:51.583,000 --> 0:01:52,000
in order to heal a wound.

36
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And this is actually what it looks like,

37
0:01:55.211,000 --> 0:01:58,000
hundreds of blood vessels, all growing toward the center of the wound.

38
0:01:59.381,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So the body has the ability to regulate

39
0:02:02.192,000 --> 0:02:05,000
the amount of blood vessels that are present at any given time.

40
0:02:05.284,000 --> 0:02:09,000
It does this through an elaborate and elegant system of checks and balances,

41
0:02:09.696,000 --> 0:02:11,000
stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis,

42
0:02:12.585,000 --> 0:02:14,000
such that, when we need a brief burst of blood vessels,

43
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
the body can do this by releasing stimulators,

44
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
proteins called angiogenic factors,

45
0:02:20.482,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that act as natural fertilizer, and stimulate new blood vessels to sprout.

46
0:02:24.672,000 --> 0:02:26,000
When those excess vessels are no longer needed,

47
0:02:26.937,000 --> 0:02:28,000
the body prunes them back to baseline,

48
0:02:29.548,000 --> 0:02:32,000
using naturally-occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis.

49
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
There are other situations where we start beneath the baseline,

50
0:02:36.577,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and we need to grow more blood vessels, just to get back to normal levels --

51
0:02:40.253,000 --> 0:02:41,000
for example, after an injury --

52
0:02:41.78,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and the body can do that too, but only to that normal level,

53
0:02:44.655,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that set point.

54
0:02:46.372,000 --> 0:02:48,000
But what we now know, is that for a number of diseases,

55
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
there are defects in the system,

56
0:02:51.669,000 --> 0:02:53,000
where the body can't prune back extra blood vessels,

57
0:02:54.194,000 --> 0:02:57,000
or can't grow enough new ones in the right place at the right time.

58
0:02:58.144,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And in these situations, angiogenesis is out of balance.

59
0:03:02.453,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And when angiogenesis is out of balance,

60
0:03:04.405,000 --> 0:03:05,000
a myriad of diseases result.

61
0:03:06.564,000 --> 0:03:09,000
For example, insufficient angiogenesis -- not enough blood vessels --

62
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
leads to wounds that don't heal, heart attacks,

63
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
legs without circulation, death from stroke,

64
0:03:15.899,000 --> 0:03:16,000
nerve damage.

65
0:03:17.717,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And on the other end, excessive angiogenesis --

66
0:03:20.058,000 --> 0:03:22,000
too many blood vessels -- drives disease,

67
0:03:22.259,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and we see this in cancer, blindness,

68
0:03:24.871,000 --> 0:03:26,000
arthritis, obesity, Alzheimer's disease.

69
0:03:28.566,000 --> 0:03:31,000
In total, there are more than 70 major diseases

70
0:03:31.733,000 --> 0:03:33,000
affecting more than a billion people worldwide,

71
0:03:34.226,000 --> 0:03:36,000
that all look on the surface to be different from one another,

72
0:03:37.218,000 --> 0:03:39,000
but all actually share abnormal angiogenesis

73
0:03:40.06,000 --> 0:03:41,000
as their common denominator.

74
0:03:42.631,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And this realization is allowing us to re-conceptualize

75
0:03:45.732,000 --> 0:03:47,000
the way that we actually approach these diseases,

76
0:03:48.168,000 --> 0:03:49,000
by controlling angiogenesis.

77
0:03:51.089,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Now, I'm going to focus on cancer,

78
0:03:53.022,000 --> 0:03:56,000
because angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer --

79
0:03:56.513,000 --> 0:03:57,000
every type of cancer.

80
0:03:58.513,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So here we go.

81
0:04:00.206,000 --> 0:04:03,000
This is a tumor: dark, gray, ominous mass growing inside a brain.

82
0:04:04.12,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And under the microscope,

83
0:04:05.393,000 --> 0:04:08,000
you can see hundreds of these brown-stained blood vessels,

84
0:04:08.43,000 --> 0:04:1,000
capillaries that are feeding cancer cells,

85
0:04:10.501,000 --> 0:04:11,000
bringing oxygen and nutrients.

86
0:04:13.549,000 --> 0:04:15,000
But cancers don't start out like this,

87
0:04:15.652,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and in fact, cancers don't start out with a blood supply.

88
0:04:18.951,000 --> 0:04:21,000
They start out as small, microscopic nests of cells,

89
0:04:22.611,000 --> 0:04:26,000
that can only grow to one half a cubic millimeter in size.

90
0:04:26.939,000 --> 0:04:27,000
That's the tip of a ballpoint pen.

91
0:04:29.111,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Then they can't get any larger because they don't have a blood supply,

92
0:04:32.445,000 --> 0:04:34,000
so they don't have enough oxygen or nutrients.

93
0:04:34.624,000 --> 0:04:37,000
In fact, we're probably forming these microscopic cancers

94
0:04:37.973,000 --> 0:04:39,000
all the time in our body.

95
0:04:40.139,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Autopsy studies from people who died in car accidents

96
0:04:43.725,000 --> 0:04:47,000
have shown that about 40 percent of women between the ages of 40 and 50

97
0:04:48.575,000 --> 0:04:51,000
actually have microscopic cancers in their breasts.

98
0:04:52.48,000 --> 0:04:54,000
About 50 percent of men in their 50s and 60s

99
0:04:54.845,000 --> 0:04:56,000
have microscopic prostate cancers,

100
0:04:57.398,000 --> 0:05:,000
and virtually 100 percent of us, by the time we reach our 70s,

101
0:05:01.089,000 --> 0:05:03,000
will have microscopic cancers growing in our thyroid.

102
0:05:04.58,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Yet, without a blood supply,

103
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
most of these cancers will never become dangerous.

104
0:05:10.667,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Dr. Judah Folkman, who was my mentor

105
0:05:12.897,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field,

106
0:05:15.317,000 --> 0:05:18,000
once called this "cancer without disease."

107
0:05:19.885,000 --> 0:05:21,000
So the body's ability to balance angiogenesis,

108
0:05:22.714,000 --> 0:05:23,000
when it's working properly,

109
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
prevents blood vessels from feeding cancers.

110
0:05:26.54,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And this turns out to be

111
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
one of our most important defense mechanisms

112
0:05:31.06,000 --> 0:05:32,000
against cancer.

113
0:05:33.472,000 --> 0:05:35,000
In fact, if you actually block angiogenesis

114
0:05:35.757,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and prevent blood vessels from ever reaching cancer cells,

115
0:05:38.55,000 --> 0:05:39,000
tumors simply can't grow up.

116
0:05:39.975,000 --> 0:05:4,000
But once angiogenesis occurs,

117
0:05:41.752,000 --> 0:05:43,000
cancers can grow exponentially.

118
0:05:44.649,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And this is actually how a cancer goes from being harmless,

119
0:05:48.982,000 --> 0:05:49,000
to being deadly.

120
0:05:50.918,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Cancer cells mutate,

121
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and they gain the ability to release lots of those angiogenic factors,

122
0:05:55.571,000 --> 0:05:56,000
natural fertilizer,

123
0:05:56.766,000 --> 0:05:59,000
that tip the balance in favor of blood vessels invading the cancer.

124
0:06:00.236,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And once those vessels invade the cancer,

125
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
it can expand, it can invade local tissues,

126
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and the same vessels that are feeding tumors

127
0:06:07.585,000 --> 0:06:11,000
allow cancer cells to exit into the circulation as metastases.

128
0:06:12.688,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And unfortunately, this late stage of cancer

129
0:06:15.466,000 --> 0:06:18,000
is the one at which it's most likely to be diagnosed,

130
0:06:19.45,000 --> 0:06:21,000
when angiogenesis is already turned on,

131
0:06:21.489,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and cancer cells are growing like wild.

132
0:06:24.997,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So, if angiogenesis is a tipping point

133
0:06:29.126,000 --> 0:06:32,000
between a harmless cancer and a harmful one,

134
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
then one major part of the angiogenesis revolution

135
0:06:35.558,000 --> 0:06:36,000
is a new approach to treating cancer

136
0:06:37.337,000 --> 0:06:38,000
by cutting off the blood supply.

137
0:06:40.169,000 --> 0:06:43,000
We call this antiangiogenic therapy,

138
0:06:43.401,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and it's completely different from chemotherapy,

139
0:06:45.703,000 --> 0:06:46,000
because it selectively aims

140
0:06:47.607,000 --> 0:06:49,000
at the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers.

141
0:06:50.644,000 --> 0:06:54,000
We can do this because tumor blood vessels are unlike normal, healthy vessels

142
0:06:55.103,000 --> 0:06:56,000
we see in other places of the body --

143
0:06:56.917,000 --> 0:06:59,000
they're abnormal, they're very poorly constructed,

144
0:07:00.065,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and because of that, they're highly vulnerable

145
0:07:02.343,000 --> 0:07:03,000
to treatments that target them.

146
0:07:05.926,000 --> 0:07:08,000
In effect, when we give cancer patients antiangiogenic therapy --

147
0:07:09.482,000 --> 0:07:11,000
here, an experimental drug for a glioma,

148
0:07:12.49,000 --> 0:07:13,000
which is a type of brain tumor --

149
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
you can see that there are dramatic changes that occur

150
0:07:17.066,000 --> 0:07:18,000
when the tumor is being starved.

151
0:07:19.963,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Here's a woman with a breast cancer,

152
0:07:21.891,000 --> 0:07:23,000
being treated with the antiangiogenic drug called Avastin,

153
0:07:24.839,000 --> 0:07:25,000
which is FDA approved.

154
0:07:26.831,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And you can see that the halo of blood flow

155
0:07:29.548,000 --> 0:07:3,000
disappears after treatment.

156
0:07:32.723,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Well, I've just shown you two very different types of cancer

157
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
that both responded to antiangiogenic therapy.

158
0:07:39.426,000 --> 0:07:41,000
So a few years ago, I asked myself,

159
0:07:41.609,000 --> 0:07:44,000
"Can we take this one step further and treat other cancers,

160
0:07:45.569,000 --> 0:07:46,000
even in other species?"

161
0:07:49.148,000 --> 0:07:51,000
So here is a nine year-old boxer named Milo,

162
0:07:51.562,000 --> 0:07:52,000
who had a very aggressive tumor

163
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
called a malignant neurofibroma growing on his shoulder.

164
0:07:56.292,000 --> 0:07:57,000
It invaded into his lungs.

165
0:07:57.901,000 --> 0:07:59,000
His veterinarian only gave him three months to live.

166
0:08:00.409,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So we created a cocktail of antiangiogenic drugs

167
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
that could be mixed into his dog food,

168
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
as well as an antiangiogenic cream,

169
0:08:07.537,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that could be applied on the surface of the tumor.

170
0:08:10.537,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And within a few weeks of treatment,

171
0:08:12.696,000 --> 0:08:14,000
we were able to slow down that cancer's growth,

172
0:08:15.046,000 --> 0:08:18,000
such that we were ultimately able to extend Milo’s survival

173
0:08:18.323,000 --> 0:08:21,000
to six times what the veterinarian had initially predicted,

174
0:08:21.966,000 --> 0:08:22,000
all with a very good quality of life.

175
0:08:24.566,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And we've subsequently treated more than 600 dogs.

176
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
We have about a 60 percent response rate,

177
0:08:29.554,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and improved survival for these pets

178
0:08:31.99,000 --> 0:08:32,000
that were about to be euthanized.

179
0:08:34.514,000 --> 0:08:37,000
So let me show you a couple of even more interesting examples.

180
0:08:38.414,000 --> 0:08:4,000
This is 20-year-old dolphin living in Florida,

181
0:08:40.763,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and she had these lesions in her mouth

182
0:08:42.938,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that, over the course of three years,

183
0:08:44.748,000 --> 0:08:46,000
developed into invasive squamous cell cancers.

184
0:08:47.87,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So we created an antiangiogenic paste.

185
0:08:50.632,000 --> 0:08:53,000
We had it painted on top of the cancer three times a week.

186
0:08:54.559,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And over the course of seven months,

187
0:08:56.782,000 --> 0:08:57,000
the cancers completely disappeared,

188
0:08:58.52,000 --> 0:09:,000
and the biopsies came back as normal.

189
0:09:02.893,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Here's a cancer growing on the lip

190
0:09:04.623,000 --> 0:09:05,000
of a Quarter Horse named Guinness.

191
0:09:06.615,000 --> 0:09:09,000
It's a very, very deadly type of cancer called an angiosarcoma.

192
0:09:09.742,000 --> 0:09:1,000
It had already spread to his lymph nodes,

193
0:09:11.734,000 --> 0:09:14,000
so we used an antiangiogenic skin cream for the lip,

194
0:09:14.782,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and the oral cocktail, so we could treat from the inside as well as the outside.

195
0:09:19.387,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And over the course of six months,

196
0:09:21.538,000 --> 0:09:22,000
he experienced a complete remission.

197
0:09:24.593,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And here he is six years later,

198
0:09:27.768,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Guinness, with his very happy owner.

199
0:09:30.673,000 --> 0:09:32,000
(Applause)

200
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Now obviously, antiangiogenic therapy could be used for a wide range of cancers.

201
0:09:38.51,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And in fact, the first pioneering treatments

202
0:09:40.819,000 --> 0:09:41,000
for people as well as dogs,

203
0:09:42.414,000 --> 0:09:43,000
are already becoming available.

204
0:09:44.074,000 --> 0:09:47,000
There are 12 different drugs, 11 different cancer types.

205
0:09:47.996,000 --> 0:09:48,000
But the real question is:

206
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
How well do these work in practice?

207
0:09:51.543,000 --> 0:09:54,000
So here's actually the patient survival data

208
0:09:54.68,000 --> 0:09:55,000
from eight different types of cancer.

209
0:09:56.489,000 --> 0:09:58,000
The bars represent survival time

210
0:09:58.972,000 --> 0:10:01,000
taken from the era in which there was only chemotherapy,

211
0:10:02.536,000 --> 0:10:03,000
or surgery, or radiation available.

212
0:10:05.194,000 --> 0:10:07,000
But starting in 2004,

213
0:10:07.591,000 --> 0:10:09,000
when antiangiogenic therapies first became available,

214
0:10:10.241,000 --> 0:10:14,000
you can see that there has been a 70 to 100 percent improvement in survival

215
0:10:15.175,000 --> 0:10:18,000
for people with kidney cancer, multiple myeloma,

216
0:10:18.36,000 --> 0:10:21,000
colorectal cancer, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.

217
0:10:22.439,000 --> 0:10:23,000
That's impressive.

218
0:10:24.241,000 --> 0:10:26,000
But for other tumors and cancer types,

219
0:10:27.224,000 --> 0:10:29,000
the improvements have only been modest.

220
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
So I started asking myself,

221
0:10:32.168,000 --> 0:10:34,000
"Why haven't we been able to do better?"

222
0:10:35.421,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And the answer, to me, is obvious:

223
0:10:37.572,000 --> 0:10:39,000
we're treating cancer too late in the game,

224
0:10:39.898,000 --> 0:10:4,000
when it's already established,

225
0:10:41.581,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and oftentimes, it's already spread or metastasized.

226
0:10:44.732,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And as a doctor,

227
0:10:45.907,000 --> 0:10:48,000
I know that once a disease progresses to an advanced stage,

228
0:10:49.773,000 --> 0:10:52,000
achieving a cure can be difficult, if not impossible.

229
0:10:54.804,000 --> 0:10:59,000
So I went back to the biology of angiogenesis, and started thinking:

230
0:11:00.712,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Could the answer to cancer be preventing angiogenesis,

231
0:11:05.738,000 --> 0:11:06,000
beating cancer at its own game,

232
0:11:07.627,000 --> 0:11:09,000
so the cancers could never become dangerous?

233
0:11:11.674,000 --> 0:11:12,000
This could help healthy people,

234
0:11:13.38,000 --> 0:11:16,000
as well as people who've already beaten cancer once or twice,

235
0:11:17.111,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and want to find a way to keep it from coming back.

236
0:11:20.456,000 --> 0:11:22,000
So to look for a way to prevent angiogenesis in cancer,

237
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
I went back to look at cancer's causes.

238
0:11:25.832,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And what really intrigued me,

239
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
was when I saw that diet accounts for 30 to 35 percent

240
0:11:31.617,000 --> 0:11:32,000
of environmentally-caused cancers.

241
0:11:34.393,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Now the obvious thing is to think about what we could remove from our diet,

242
0:11:38.131,000 --> 0:11:39,000
what to strip out, take away.

243
0:11:40.702,000 --> 0:11:42,000
But I actually took a completely opposite approach,

244
0:11:43.517,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and began asking: What could we be adding to our diet

245
0:11:46.93,000 --> 0:11:48,000
that's naturally antiangiogenic,

246
0:11:49.435,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and that could boost the body's defense system,

247
0:11:51.792,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers?

248
0:11:54.895,000 --> 0:11:57,000
In other words, can we eat to starve cancer?

249
0:11:58.316,000 --> 0:11:59,000
(Laughter)

250
0:11:59.665,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Well, the answer is yes, and I'm going to show you how.

251
0:12:02.434,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And our search for this has taken us to the market,

252
0:12:05.822,000 --> 0:12:06,000
the farm and to the spice cabinet,

253
0:12:07.695,000 --> 0:12:08,000
because what we've discovered

254
0:12:09.181,000 --> 0:12:11,000
is that Mother Nature has laced a large number

255
0:12:11.475,000 --> 0:12:12,000
of foods and beverages and herbs

256
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
with naturally-occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis.

257
0:12:17.638,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Here's a test system we developed.

258
0:12:19.361,000 --> 0:12:2,000
At the center is a ring

259
0:12:20.544,000 --> 0:12:23,000
from which hundreds of blood vessels are growing out in a starburst fashion.

260
0:12:24.178,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And we can use this system to test dietary factors

261
0:12:27.121,000 --> 0:12:29,000
at concentrations that are obtainable by eating.

262
0:12:30.969,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Let me show you what happens

263
0:12:32.382,000 --> 0:12:34,000
when we put in an extract from red grapes.

264
0:12:35.144,000 --> 0:12:37,000
The active ingredient is resveratrol,

265
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
it's also found in red wine.

266
0:12:39.431,000 --> 0:12:41,000
This inhibits abnormal angiogenesis,

267
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
by 60 percent.

268
0:12:44.537,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Here's what happens when we added an extract from strawberries.

269
0:12:47.728,000 --> 0:12:49,000
It potently inhibits angiogenesis.

270
0:12:50.98,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And extract from soybeans.

271
0:12:53.985,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And here is a growing list

272
0:12:55.93,000 --> 0:12:59,000
of antiangiogenic foods and beverages that we're interested in studying.

273
0:13:00.572,000 --> 0:13:01,000
For each food type,

274
0:13:02.586,000 --> 0:13:04,000
we believe that there are different potencies

275
0:13:04.832,000 --> 0:13:06,000
within different strains and varietals.

276
0:13:07.206,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And we want to measure this because,

277
0:13:09.461,000 --> 0:13:11,000
well, while you're eating a strawberry

278
0:13:11.699,000 --> 0:13:12,000
or drinking tea,

279
0:13:13.2,000 --> 0:13:15,000
why not select the one that's most potent

280
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
for preventing cancer?

281
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
So here are four different teas that we've tested.

282
0:13:20.36,000 --> 0:13:23,000
They're all common ones: Chinese jasmine, Japanese sencha,

283
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Earl Grey and a special blend that we prepared,

284
0:13:26.904,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and you can see clearly that the teas vary in their potency,

285
0:13:30.629,000 --> 0:13:32,000
from less potent to more potent.

286
0:13:34.002,000 --> 0:13:35,000
But what's very cool

287
0:13:35.51,000 --> 0:13:38,000
is when we combine the two less potent teas together,

288
0:13:39.283,000 --> 0:13:43,000
the combination, the blend, is more potent than either one alone.

289
0:13:44.545,000 --> 0:13:46,000
This means there's food synergy.

290
0:13:49.634,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Here's some more data from our testing.

291
0:13:51.547,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Now in the lab, we can simulate tumor angiogenesis,

292
0:13:54.483,000 --> 0:13:55,000
represented here in a black bar.

293
0:13:56.498,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And using this system, we can test the potency of cancer drugs.

294
0:13:59.59,000 --> 0:14:,000
So the shorter the bar,

295
0:14:01.146,000 --> 0:14:03,000
the less angiogenesis -- that's good.

296
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
And here are some common drugs

297
0:14:06.123,000 --> 0:14:1,000
that have been associated with reducing the risk of cancer in people.

298
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Statins, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,

299
0:14:13.085,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and a few others -- they inhibit angiogenesis, too.

300
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And here are the dietary factors

301
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
going head-to-head against these drugs.

302
0:14:22.179,000 --> 0:14:24,000
You can see they clearly hold their own,

303
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and in some cases, they're more potent than the actual drugs.

304
0:14:28.011,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Soy, parsley, garlic, grapes, berries.

305
0:14:32.527,000 --> 0:14:35,000
I could go home and cook a tasty meal using these ingredients.

306
0:14:36.84,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Imagine if we could create the world's first rating system,

307
0:14:40.832,000 --> 0:14:41,000
in which we could score foods

308
0:14:42.403,000 --> 0:14:45,000
according to their antiangiogenic, cancer-preventative properties.

309
0:14:46.567,000 --> 0:14:47,000
And that's what we're doing right now.

310
0:14:49.599,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Now, I've shown you a bunch of lab data,

311
0:14:51.549,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and so the real question is:

312
0:14:53.357,000 --> 0:14:55,000
What is the evidence in people

313
0:14:55.659,000 --> 0:14:58,000
that eating certain foods can reduce angiogenesis in cancer?

314
0:15:00.5,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Well, the best example I know

315
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
is a study of 79,000 men followed over 20 years,

316
0:15:06.345,000 --> 0:15:08,000
in which it was found that men who consumed cooked tomatoes

317
0:15:09.21,000 --> 0:15:1,000
two to three times a week,

318
0:15:10.724,000 --> 0:15:12,000
had up to a 50 percent reduction

319
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
in their risk of developing prostate cancer.

320
0:15:16.366,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Now, we know that tomatoes are a good source of lycopene,

321
0:15:19.696,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and lycopene is antiangiogenic.

322
0:15:22.617,000 --> 0:15:24,000
But what's even more interesting from this study,

323
0:15:24.959,000 --> 0:15:26,000
is that in those men who did develop prostate cancer,

324
0:15:27.54,000 --> 0:15:29,000
those who ate more servings of tomato sauce,

325
0:15:30.358,000 --> 0:15:33,000
actually had fewer blood vessels feeding their cancer.

326
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
So this human study is a prime example

327
0:15:36.702,000 --> 0:15:4,000
of how antiangiogenic substances present in food and consumed at practical levels,

328
0:15:41.652,000 --> 0:15:42,000
can have an impact on cancer.

329
0:15:43.936,000 --> 0:15:46,000
And we're now studying the role of a healthy diet --

330
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
with Dean Ornish at UCSF and Tufts University --

331
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
the role of this healthy diet on markers of angiogenesis

332
0:15:53.71,000 --> 0:15:54,000
that we can find in the bloodstream.

333
0:15:55.96,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Obviously, what I've shared with you has some far-ranging implications,

334
0:15:59.706,000 --> 0:16:,000
even beyond cancer research.

335
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Because if we're right, it could impact consumer education,

336
0:16:04.536,000 --> 0:16:05,000
food services, public health

337
0:16:06.377,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and even the insurance industry.

338
0:16:08.6,000 --> 0:16:09,000
And in fact, some insurance companies

339
0:16:10.41,000 --> 0:16:12,000
are already beginning to think along these lines.

340
0:16:12.744,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Check out this ad from BlueCross BlueShield of Minnesota.

341
0:16:16.671,000 --> 0:16:17,000
For many people around the world,

342
0:16:18.37,000 --> 0:16:21,000
dietary cancer prevention may be the only practical solution,

343
0:16:22.156,000 --> 0:16:25,000
because not everybody can afford expensive end-stage cancer treatments,

344
0:16:25.629,000 --> 0:16:27,000
but everybody could benefit from a healthy diet

345
0:16:28.344,000 --> 0:16:31,000
based on local, sustainable, antiangiogenic crops.

346
0:16:33.505,000 --> 0:16:35,000
Now, finally,

347
0:16:35.727,000 --> 0:16:36,000
I've talked to you about food,

348
0:16:37.434,000 --> 0:16:38,000
and I've talked to you about cancer,

349
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
so there's just one more disease that I have to tell you about,

350
0:16:42.584,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and that's obesity.

351
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Because it turns out that adipose tissue -- fat --

352
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
is highly angiogenesis-dependent.

353
0:16:50.886,000 --> 0:16:52,000
And like a tumor, fat grows when blood vessels grow.

354
0:16:53.68,000 --> 0:16:54,000
So the question is:

355
0:16:54.922,000 --> 0:16:56,000
Can we shrink fat by cutting off its blood supply?

356
0:16:58.73,000 --> 0:17:02,000
The top curve shows the body weight of a genetically obese mouse

357
0:17:03.259,000 --> 0:17:06,000
that eats nonstop until it turns fat,

358
0:17:06.433,000 --> 0:17:07,000
like this furry tennis ball.

359
0:17:08.111,000 --> 0:17:09,000
(Laughter)

360
0:17:09.321,000 --> 0:17:12,000
And the bottom curve is the weight of a normal mouse.

361
0:17:12.536,000 --> 0:17:13,000
If you take the obese mouse

362
0:17:13.862,000 --> 0:17:15,000
and give it an angiogenesis inhibitor, it loses weight.

363
0:17:16.559,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Stop the treatment, gains the weight back. Restart the treatment, loses the weight.

364
0:17:20.525,000 --> 0:17:22,000
Stop the treatment, it gains the weight back.

365
0:17:22.66,000 --> 0:17:24,000
And, in fact, you can cycle the weight up and down

366
0:17:25.041,000 --> 0:17:26,000
simply by inhibiting angiogenesis.

367
0:17:27.057,000 --> 0:17:29,000
So this approach that we're taking for cancer prevention

368
0:17:29.826,000 --> 0:17:31,000
may also have an application for obesity.

369
0:17:33.347,000 --> 0:17:35,000
The truly interesting thing about this

370
0:17:35.475,000 --> 0:17:36,000
is that we can't take these obese mice

371
0:17:37.475,000 --> 0:17:38,000
and make them lose more weight

372
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
than what the normal mouse's weight is supposed to be.

373
0:17:42.481,000 --> 0:17:45,000
In other words, we can't create supermodel mice.

374
0:17:45.514,000 --> 0:17:46,000
(Laughter)

375
0:17:46.799,000 --> 0:17:48,000
And this speaks to the role of angiogenesis

376
0:17:48.867,000 --> 0:17:49,000
in regulating healthy set points.

377
0:17:51.764,000 --> 0:17:52,000
Albert Szent-Györgi once said,

378
0:17:53.695,000 --> 0:17:55,000
"Discovery consists of seeing what everyone has seen,

379
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
and thinking what no one has thought."

380
0:17:58.521,000 --> 0:17:59,000
I hope I've convinced you

381
0:17:59.975,000 --> 0:18:02,000
that for diseases like cancer, obesity and other conditions,

382
0:18:03.259,000 --> 0:18:04,000
there may be a great power

383
0:18:05.105,000 --> 0:18:08,000
in attacking their common denominator: angiogenesis.

384
0:18:08.256,000 --> 0:18:1,000
And that's what I think the world needs now.

385
0:18:10.336,000 --> 0:18:11,000
Thank you.

386
0:18:11.511,000 --> 0:18:17,000
(Applause)

387
0:18:21.65,000 --> 0:18:23,000
June Cohen: I have a quick question for you.

388
0:18:23.746,000 --> 0:18:27,000
JC: So these drugs aren't exactly in mainstream cancer treatments right now.

389
0:18:28.648,000 --> 0:18:31,000
For anyone out here who has cancer, what would you recommend?

390
0:18:32.26,000 --> 0:18:35,000
Do you recommend pursuing these treatments now, for most cancer patients?

391
0:18:36.002,000 --> 0:18:38,000
William Li: There are antiangiogenic treatments

392
0:18:38.234,000 --> 0:18:39,000
that are FDA approved,

393
0:18:39.669,000 --> 0:18:4,000
and if you're a cancer patient,

394
0:18:41.677,000 --> 0:18:44,000
or working for one or advocating for one, you should ask about them.

395
0:18:45.612,000 --> 0:18:47,000
And there are many clinical trials.

396
0:18:48.26,000 --> 0:18:5,000
The Angiogenesis Foundation is following almost 300 companies,

397
0:18:51.26,000 --> 0:18:55,000
and there are about 100 more drugs in that pipeline.

398
0:18:55.685,000 --> 0:18:56,000
So, consider the approved ones,

399
0:18:57.26,000 --> 0:18:58,000
look for clinical trials,

400
0:18:58.982,000 --> 0:19:,000
but then between what the doctor can do for you,

401
0:19:01.505,000 --> 0:19:03,000
we need to start asking what can we do for ourselves.

402
0:19:04.066,000 --> 0:19:06,000
This is one of the themes I'm talking about:

403
0:19:06.17,000 --> 0:19:07,000
We can empower ourselves

404
0:19:07.349,000 --> 0:19:09,000
to do the things that doctors can't do for us,

405
0:19:09.56,000 --> 0:19:11,000
which is to use knowledge and take action.

406
0:19:11.656,000 --> 0:19:13,000
And if Mother Nature has given us some clues,

407
0:19:14.26,000 --> 0:19:18,000
we think there might be a new future in the value of how we eat,

408
0:19:18.536,000 --> 0:19:21,000
and what we eat is really our chemotherapy three times a day.

409
0:19:21.658,000 --> 0:19:23,000
JC: Right. And along those lines,

410
0:19:23.731,000 --> 0:19:25,000
for people who might have risk factors for cancer,

411
0:19:26.26,000 --> 0:19:29,000
would you recommend pursuing any treatments prophylactically,

412
0:19:29.523,000 --> 0:19:31,000
or simply pursuing the right diet,

413
0:19:31.755,000 --> 0:19:32,000
with lots of tomato sauce?

414
0:19:33.539,000 --> 0:19:36,000
WL: Well, you know, there's abundant epidemiological evidence,

415
0:19:36.761,000 --> 0:19:37,000
and I think in the information age,

416
0:19:38.476,000 --> 0:19:4,000
it doesn't take long to go to a credible source like PubMed,

417
0:19:41.339,000 --> 0:19:42,000
the National Library of Medicine,

418
0:19:42.949,000 --> 0:19:45,000
to look for epidemiological studies for cancer risk reduction

419
0:19:46.259,000 --> 0:19:48,000
based on diet and based on common medications.

420
0:19:49.153,000 --> 0:19:51,000
And that's certainly something that anybody can look into.

421
0:19:51.924,000 --> 0:19:52,000
JC: Okay. Well, thank you so much.

422
0:19:53.594,000 --> 0:19:54,000
(Applause)

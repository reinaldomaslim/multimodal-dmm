1
0:00:13.436,000 --> 0:00:15,000
It was June 2014.

2
0:00:16.754,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I was 30 years old,

3
0:00:19.119,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and I received a call from my doctor's office

4
0:00:21.253,000 --> 0:00:23,000
to say my test results were in.

5
0:00:24.46,000 --> 0:00:28,000
So I walked up to see her in my lunch break, and my doctor said

6
0:00:28.857,000 --> 0:00:31,000
she was very sorry to tell me that I had breast cancer.

7
0:00:34.442,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I didn't want to believe her and at first, I didn't.

8
0:00:38.712,000 --> 0:00:41,000
You see, I'm a lawyer and I needed some evidence.

9
0:00:42.601,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So I'm very embarrassed to tell you all

10
0:00:45.228,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that I stood up and I walked around to where she was sitting

11
0:00:49.102,000 --> 0:00:51,000
so that I could look over her shoulder and verify

12
0:00:52.016,000 --> 0:00:54,000
what was written on the page in front of her.

13
0:00:54.145,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:55.371,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Malignant carcinoma.

15
0:00:57.864,000 --> 0:01:,000
But still not wanting to believe it, I said,

16
0:01:01.212,000 --> 0:01:06,000
"Now, malignant carcinoma, you're sure that means cancer?"

17
0:01:06.837,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:08.067,000 --> 0:01:09,000
She told me she was sure.

19
0:01:11.376,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Back at work, I handed over the urgent things that needed to be done

20
0:01:14.9,000 --> 0:01:17,000
while I was having more tests to see if my cancer had spread.

21
0:01:18.895,000 --> 0:01:21,000
But at that moment, work wasn't my priority.

22
0:01:23.046,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I was thinking about how I was going to tell my family and friends

23
0:01:26.19,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that I had cancer.

24
0:01:28.165,000 --> 0:01:29,000
How I was going to answer their questions

25
0:01:30.157,000 --> 0:01:33,000
about how bad it was and whether I was going to be OK,

26
0:01:33.276,000 --> 0:01:34,000
when I didn't know that myself.

27
0:01:36.307,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I was wondering if my partner and I

28
0:01:38.022,000 --> 0:01:4,000
would ever have an opportunity to start a family.

29
0:01:41.094,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And I was figuring out how I was going to tell my mother,

30
0:01:44.562,000 --> 0:01:47,000
who had herself had breast cancer when she was pregnant with me.

31
0:01:49.165,000 --> 0:01:5,000
She would know how I was feeling

32
0:01:51.117,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and have an idea of what lay ahead for me.

33
0:01:53.768,000 --> 0:01:57,000
But I also didn't want her to have to relive her cancer experience.

34
0:01:59.568,000 --> 0:02:01,000
What I didn't appreciate at the time

35
0:02:01.886,000 --> 0:02:05,000
was that work was about to play a huge role in my treatment and recovery.

36
0:02:07.402,000 --> 0:02:1,000
That it would be my coworkers and my job

37
0:02:10.561,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that would make me feel valuable and human

38
0:02:12.593,000 --> 0:02:14,000
at times when I would have otherwise felt like a statistic.

39
0:02:16.379,000 --> 0:02:2,000
That it would be my job that would give me routine and stability

40
0:02:20.577,000 --> 0:02:22,000
when I was dealing with so many difficult personal decisions

41
0:02:23.426,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and so much uncertainty.

42
0:02:25.022,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Like, what sort of breast reconstruction I was going to have.

43
0:02:30.68,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And at a time like that,

44
0:02:32.323,000 --> 0:02:35,000
you would think that I would turn to my family and friends for support.

45
0:02:35.901,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And yes, of course I did that.

46
0:02:39.806,000 --> 0:02:4,000
But it would ultimately be my colleagues

47
0:02:41.759,000 --> 0:02:45,000
who would play a huge role in my day-to-day life.

48
0:02:46.625,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And they would be the ones to make me laugh.

49
0:02:49.639,000 --> 0:02:52,000
You see, we were a pretty close team,

50
0:02:52.847,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and we shared a couple of really good in-jokes,

51
0:02:55.434,000 --> 0:02:58,000
like this time they overheard someone ask me

52
0:02:59.419,000 --> 0:03:02,000
how I got my hair so shiny and perfect --

53
0:03:04.002,000 --> 0:03:06,000
without knowing that it was, of course, a wig,

54
0:03:07.018,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and you know, it was a very good wig

55
0:03:09.169,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and it did make getting ready in the mornings very easy.

56
0:03:12.349,000 --> 0:03:13,000
(Laughter)

57
0:03:13.72,000 --> 0:03:17,000
But in little moments like this, I appreciated what their support meant,

58
0:03:18.363,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and I wondered what I would have done without that network.

59
0:03:22.716,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I've spoken with so many people, women in particular,

60
0:03:26.898,000 --> 0:03:28,000
who haven't had the chance to have that network

61
0:03:29.795,000 --> 0:03:32,000
because they haven't been given the opportunity to work through treatment.

62
0:03:35.471,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And there are several reasons for this.

63
0:03:37.764,000 --> 0:03:4,000
But I think it mostly comes down to overly paternalistic employers.

64
0:03:42.375,000 --> 0:03:46,000
These employers want you to go away and focus on yourself.

65
0:03:47.077,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And come back when you're better.

66
0:03:50.196,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And they use those kinds of phrases.

67
0:03:53.135,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And while these responses are well-meaning,

68
0:03:56.333,000 --> 0:03:57,000
knowing the benefits it brought me,

69
0:03:58.277,000 --> 0:04:,000
it makes me incredibly frustrated

70
0:04:01.293,000 --> 0:04:04,000
when people are told that they couldn’t or shouldn't work,

71
0:04:05.185,000 --> 0:04:08,000
when it's something that they want to do and physically can do.

72
0:04:09.605,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So I started to look into what an employer is required to do

73
0:04:12.839,000 --> 0:04:14,000
when someone presents with a cancer diagnosis.

74
0:04:16.839,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I discovered that under Australian law, cancer is considered a disability.

75
0:04:21.835,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So if you are unable to perform your usual work duties,

76
0:04:25.272,000 --> 0:04:28,000
your employer is obligated by the Disability Discrimination Act

77
0:04:29.216,000 --> 0:04:32,000
to make reasonable adjustments to your working arrangements,

78
0:04:32.339,000 --> 0:04:34,000
so that you can continue to work.

79
0:04:36.014,000 --> 0:04:38,000
What would reasonable adjustments look like for me?

80
0:04:40.579,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I knew the obvious impacts my diagnosis was going to have on work.

81
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Medical appointments would be scheduled during business hours,

82
0:04:48.365,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and I knew that I would need time off to recover from surgical procedures.

83
0:04:53.49,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Again, being a typical lawyer,

84
0:04:55.944,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I had done my due diligence on what to expect from treatment.

85
0:05:00.371,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Admittedly, a lot of that was through Doctor Google,

86
0:05:02.84,000 --> 0:05:05,000
perhaps not my best move and I wouldn't recommend that.

87
0:05:05.895,000 --> 0:05:06,000
(Laughter)

88
0:05:07.207,000 --> 0:05:1,000
But while I was ready for all the physical side effects,

89
0:05:10.373,000 --> 0:05:13,000
what really scared me was this thing called chemo brain.

90
0:05:15.103,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Chemo brain presents itself through memory loss,

91
0:05:18.258,000 --> 0:05:2,000
an inability to concentrate

92
0:05:20.479,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and an inability to solve problems.

93
0:05:23.226,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And if this happened to me,

94
0:05:25.012,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I wondered how I was going to do my job as a lawyer.

95
0:05:28.415,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Would I be forced to leave work?

96
0:05:30.924,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And how could I possibly have a discussion with my manager

97
0:05:35.297,000 --> 0:05:37,000
about reasonable adjustments to my working arrangements

98
0:05:38.22,000 --> 0:05:4,000
when I didn't know how I was going to be impacted?

99
0:05:41.823,000 --> 0:05:44,000
I was fortunate to have a supportive manager

100
0:05:45.069,000 --> 0:05:48,000
who was happy to see how things went as we went along,

101
0:05:48.911,000 --> 0:05:51,000
rather than requiring a concrete plan up front.

102
0:05:53.546,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I was lucky that while he may not have even known

103
0:05:56.911,000 --> 0:05:58,000
about this concept of reasonable adjustments,

104
0:05:59.665,000 --> 0:06:01,000
to him, it was just common sense.

105
0:06:03.22,000 --> 0:06:06,000
But I've learned that it's not common sense to everyone.

106
0:06:08.625,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Everyone going through treatment will learn how it impacts them

107
0:06:11.95,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and what their limitations are.

108
0:06:14.871,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And they'll learn to adjust for that.

109
0:06:16.958,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So for me, there were the tips and tricks that I learned about the treatment itself,

110
0:06:21.639,000 --> 0:06:22,000
like, before you go to chemo,

111
0:06:23.393,000 --> 0:06:25,000
you need to make sure you're really well hydrated

112
0:06:25.726,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and that you're warm, because it helps the nurses to find your veins.

113
0:06:29.474,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And make sure that you don't eat any of your favorite food,

114
0:06:32.442,000 --> 0:06:33,000
either before or after chemo,

115
0:06:34.419,000 --> 0:06:36,000
because you're going to be throwing that up

116
0:06:36.712,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and you won't ever want to look at it again.

117
0:06:38.838,000 --> 0:06:39,000
(Laughter)

118
0:06:40.052,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I learned that one the hard way.

119
0:06:42.292,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And then there were the tricks for managing my workflow.

120
0:06:45.72,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I scheduled chemo for first thing on a Monday morning.

121
0:06:49.171,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I knew that from the time I left the cancer care unit,

122
0:06:52.267,000 --> 0:06:56,000
I had about four hours before this fog screen would come down

123
0:06:56.72,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and I would start to be sick.

124
0:06:58.863,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So I would use that time to clean my inbox and make any urgent calls.

125
0:07:04.371,000 --> 0:07:07,000
The worst of the sickness would be gone within about 48 hours.

126
0:07:08.228,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And then I would log back into work from home.

127
0:07:12.053,000 --> 0:07:15,000
This treatment continued and I knew what to expect.

128
0:07:15.22,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I was able to set reasonable expectations with my business partners

129
0:07:18.673,000 --> 0:07:19,000
about what I could do

130
0:07:20.586,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and the time frames that I could do it in.

131
0:07:23.387,000 --> 0:07:27,000
But I still remember the hesitation in their voices

132
0:07:27.442,000 --> 0:07:29,000
when it came to asking for things.

133
0:07:29.673,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And asking me to do things by a certain time.

134
0:07:32.522,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And trust me, these were people

135
0:07:34.54,000 --> 0:07:36,000
that were not afraid of setting a good deadline.

136
0:07:36.836,000 --> 0:07:37,000
(Laughter)

137
0:07:38.569,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I got the impression they didn't want to put any extra pressure on me

138
0:07:42.038,000 --> 0:07:43,000
while I was going through treatment.

139
0:07:44.133,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And while I appreciated the sentiment,

140
0:07:46.546,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I actually needed the deadlines.

141
0:07:49.085,000 --> 0:07:51,000
To me, that was something within my control

142
0:07:51.863,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and something that could stay in my control

143
0:07:54.831,000 --> 0:07:56,000
when there were so many things that couldn't.

144
0:07:57.72,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And as I was working from home,

145
0:08:00.172,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I was thinking about how employers should be applying this concept

146
0:08:03.633,000 --> 0:08:05,000
of reasonable adjustments in our current age,

147
0:08:06.712,000 --> 0:08:09,000
where one in two Australian men and women

148
0:08:10.038,000 --> 0:08:13,000
will be diagnosed with cancer by the age of 85.

149
0:08:13.815,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So, as we continue to work longer and longer into older age,

150
0:08:18.847,000 --> 0:08:21,000
the chances of having a serious illness while we're in the workforce

151
0:08:22.307,000 --> 0:08:23,000
are increasing.

152
0:08:24.584,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And with technology enabling us to work anywhere, any time,

153
0:08:29.608,000 --> 0:08:32,000
reasonable adjustments are no longer contingent upon

154
0:08:33.425,000 --> 0:08:35,000
whether or not you can continue to physically make it

155
0:08:36.342,000 --> 0:08:37,000
into the physical office.

156
0:08:39.299,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Reasonable adjustments are also not about

157
0:08:41.546,000 --> 0:08:44,000
just offering a longer break or a comfier chair to sit in,

158
0:08:45.568,000 --> 0:08:47,000
although those things might be good, too.

159
0:08:48.854,000 --> 0:08:49,000
At the very least,

160
0:08:50.188,000 --> 0:08:53,000
we need to be applying the flexibility policies and strategies

161
0:08:53.457,000 --> 0:08:54,000
we've developed for other scenarios,

162
0:08:55.292,000 --> 0:08:58,000
like for people with family responsibilities.

163
0:08:59.831,000 --> 0:09:03,000
But how can we ensure that people are even having a conversation

164
0:09:04.355,000 --> 0:09:07,000
about what reasonable adjustments might look like for them

165
0:09:07.784,000 --> 0:09:1,000
if a manager's first response is to say,

166
0:09:10.847,000 --> 0:09:13,000
"Oh no, don't come back to work until you're better."

167
0:09:15.435,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And a light went on for me.

168
0:09:17.903,000 --> 0:09:19,000
It must be compulsory for managers

169
0:09:19.999,000 --> 0:09:22,000
to have to have these conversations with their employees.

170
0:09:23.855,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And lessons from people like me,

171
0:09:26.157,000 --> 0:09:28,000
that have really benefited from working through treatment,

172
0:09:29.085,000 --> 0:09:31,000
need to be more widely shared.

173
0:09:31.99,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And I thought about what could be done to guide these conversations,

174
0:09:35.958,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and then an amazing colleague of mine, Camilla Gunn,

175
0:09:39.585,000 --> 0:09:41,000
developed a "Working with Cancer" toolkit.

176
0:09:42.855,000 --> 0:09:45,000
The toolkit provides a framework for those diagnosed,

177
0:09:46.506,000 --> 0:09:48,000
their managers, their carers and their coworkers

178
0:09:49.522,000 --> 0:09:52,000
to have conversations about cancer and the work support available.

179
0:09:54.101,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Camilla and I have now been to other organizations

180
0:09:56.534,000 --> 0:09:57,000
to talk about the toolkit

181
0:09:57.777,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and how it can help to guide through

182
0:10:00.388,000 --> 0:10:03,000
what, quite frankly, are otherwise some pretty awkward conversations.

183
0:10:04.632,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And I'm pleased to say that the uptake of the toolkit is increasing.

184
0:10:10.005,000 --> 0:10:12,000
So what should be a manager's first response

185
0:10:12.569,000 --> 0:10:14,000
when somebody says that they're sick

186
0:10:15.007,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and they don't know how it's going to impact their work?

187
0:10:18.45,000 --> 0:10:2,000
It must be this:

188
0:10:20.712,000 --> 0:10:23,000
"To the extent that you are able, and want to,

189
0:10:24.514,000 --> 0:10:26,000
we would love to work out an arrangement for you

190
0:10:26.871,000 --> 0:10:28,000
to continue to work through treatment."

191
0:10:29.518,000 --> 0:10:32,000
We need to start positively engaging people with serious illness

192
0:10:33.47,000 --> 0:10:35,000
to keep them in the workforce,

193
0:10:35.994,000 --> 0:10:38,000
rather than paternalistically pushing them away.

194
0:10:40.299,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I've told you my story because I want you to know the benefits

195
0:10:44.368,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that working through treatment brought me.

196
0:10:46.836,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And I also want to change your perceptions

197
0:10:48.887,000 --> 0:10:5,000
if you think that somebody going through treatment

198
0:10:51.354,000 --> 0:10:54,000
is just bored, frail and vomiting a lot.

199
0:10:55.784,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And yes, these things were true some of the time,

200
0:10:58.72,000 --> 0:11:,000
if not a lot of the time,

201
0:11:00.99,000 --> 0:11:02,000
but I was also determined to push myself at work

202
0:11:03.435,000 --> 0:11:04,000
as much as I had always done.

203
0:11:05.625,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And I was able to do that because my employer gave me the choice.

204
0:11:11.307,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Most importantly, I'm telling you

205
0:11:13.576,000 --> 0:11:17,000
because while it's a seemingly obvious choice to give someone,

206
0:11:17.776,000 --> 0:11:2,000
it's not one that is always offered or encouraged.

207
0:11:21.158,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And it must be.

208
0:11:23.666,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Thank you.

209
0:11:24.857,000 --> 0:11:28,000
(Applause)

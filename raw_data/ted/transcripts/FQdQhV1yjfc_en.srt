0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Hi. Today, I'm going to take you through glimpses

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
of about eight of my projects,

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
done in collaboration with Danish artist Soren Pors.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
We call ourselves Pors and Rao,

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and we live and work in India.

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I'd like to begin with my very first object,

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
which I call "The Uncle Phone."

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And it was inspired by my uncle's peculiar habit

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
of constantly asking me to do things for him,

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
almost like I were an extension of his body --

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water,

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
a pack of cigarettes.

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And as I grew up, it became worse and worse,

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And I started to think of it as a form of control.

15
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But of course, I could never say anything,

16
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
because the uncle is a respected figure

17
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
in the Indian family.

18
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And the situation that irked me and mystified me the most

19
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
was his use of a landline telephone.

20
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
He would hold on to the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him.

21
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And so as a response and as a gift to my uncle,

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I made him "The Uncle Phone."

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
It's so long that it requires two people to use it.

24
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
It's exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that's designed for one person.

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
But the problem is that, when I left home and went to college,

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I started missing his commands.

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And so I made him a golden typewriter

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
through which he could dispense his commands

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
to nephews and nieces around the world as an email.

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So what he had to do was take a piece of paper, roll it into the carriage,

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
type his email or command and pull the paper out.

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
This device would automatically send the intended person

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
the letter as an email.

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So here you can see, we embedded a lot of electronics

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that understands all of the mechanical actions

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and converts it to digital.

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface.

38
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And of course, the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism,

39
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
the way my uncle likes it.

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
The next work is a sound-sensitive installation

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that we affectionately call "The Pygmies."

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And we wanted to work with a notion of being

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
surrounded by a tribe of very shy, sensitive and sweet creatures.

44
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So how it works is we have these panels, which we have on the wall,

45
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and behind them, we have these little creatures which hide.

46
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And as soon as it's silent, they sort of creep out.

47
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And if it's even more silent, they stretch their necks out.

48
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And at the slightest sound, they hide back again.

49
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So we had these panels on three walls of a room.

50
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And we had over 500 of these little pygmies hiding behind them.

51
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So this is how it works.

52
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
This is a video prototype.

53
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So when it's quiet, it's sort of coming out from behind the panels.

54
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And they hear like humans do, or real creatures do.

55
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile.

56
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And they don't react to background sounds.

57
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
You'll hear a train in moment that they don't react to.

58
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
(Noise)

59
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
But they react to foreground sounds. You'll hear that in a second.

60
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Whistling)

61
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So we worked very hard

62
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
to make them as lifelike as possible.

63
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So each pygmy has its own behavior, psyche,

64
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
mood swings, personalities and so on.

65
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So this is a very early prototype.

66
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Of course, it got much better after that.

67
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And we made them react to people,

68
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them.

69
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
This is a video installation called "The Missing Person."

70
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And we were quite intrigued

71
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
with playing with the notion of invisibility.

72
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
How would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility?

73
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So we worked with a company

74
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that specializes in camera surveillance,

75
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us,

76
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
using a camera

77
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that could look at people in the room, track them

78
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and replace one person with the background, rendering them invisible.

79
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So I'm just going to show you a very early prototype.

80
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
On the right side you can see my colleague Soren,

81
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
who's actually in the space.

82
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And on the left side, you'll see the processed video

83
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
where the camera has made him invisible.

84
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Soren enters the room. Pop! He goes invisible.

85
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing.

86
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
It's a very early video,

87
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
so we haven't yet dealt with the overlap and all of that,

88
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
but that got refined pretty soon, later.

89
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space,

90
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and we had one monitor, one on each wall.

91
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And as people walked into the room,

92
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
they would see themselves in the monitor, except with one difference:

93
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
one person was constantly invisible

94
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
wherever they moved in the room.

95
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
So this is a work called "The Sun Shadow."

96
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And it was almost like a sheet of paper,

97
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
like a cutout of a childlike drawing

98
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
of an oil spill or a sun.

99
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And from the front, this object appeared to be very strong and robust,

100
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and from the side, it almost seemed very weak.

101
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So people would walking into the room and they'd almost ignore it,

102
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
thinking it was some crap laying around.

103
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
But as soon as they passed by,

104
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion.

105
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And it would get exhausted, and it would collapse every time.

106
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
(Laughter)

107
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So this work

108
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
is a caricature of an upside-down man.

109
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
His head is so heavy, full of heavy thoughts,

110
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that it's sort of fallen into his hat,

111
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and his body's grown out of him almost like a plant.

112
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Well what he does is he moves around

113
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
in a very drunken fashion on his head

114
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement.

115
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And it's kind of constrained by that circle.

116
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Because if that circle weren't there, and the floor was very even,

117
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
it would start to wander about in the space.

118
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And there's no wires.

119
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
So I'll just show you an instance --

120
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
so when people enter the room, it activates this object.

121
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And it very slowly, over a few minutes,

122
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
sort of painfully goes up,

123
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and then it gains momentum

124
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and it looks like it's almost about to fall.

125
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And this is an important moment,

126
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
because we wanted to instill in the viewer

127
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
an instinct to almost go and help, or save the subject.

128
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
But it doesn't really need it,

129
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
because it, again, sort of manages to pull itself up.

130
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So this work was a real technical challenge for us,

131
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and we worked very hard, like most of our works, over years

132
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics.

133
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And it was very important for us

134
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
to establish the exact moment that it would fall,

135
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
because if we made it in a way that it would topple over,

136
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
then it would damage itself,

137
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and if it didn't fall enough, it wouldn't instill that fatalism,

138
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
or that sense of wanting to go and help it.

139
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
So I'm going to show you a very quick video

140
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
where we are doing a test scenario -- it's much faster.

141
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
That's my colleague. He's let it go.

142
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Now he's getting nervous, so he's going to go catch it.

143
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
But he doesn't need to,

144
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
because it manages to lift itself up on its own.

145
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So this is a work that we were very intrigued with,

146
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
working with the aesthetic of fur

147
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
embedded with thousands of tiny different sizes

148
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
of fiber optics, which twinkle like the night sky.

149
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And it's at the scale of the night sky.

150
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
So we wrapped this around a blob-like form,

151
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
which is in the shape of a teddy bear,

152
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
which was hanging from the ceiling.

153
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And the idea was to sort of contrast

154
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe

155
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
into the familiar form of a teddy bear,

156
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
which is very comforting and intimate.

157
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And the idea was that at some point

158
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear

159
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space,

160
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky.

161
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So this is the last work, and a work in progress,

162
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and it's called "Space Filler."

163
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Well imagine a small cube that's about this big

164
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
standing in front of you in the middle of the room,

165
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
and as you approached it, it tried to intimidate you

166
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
by growing into a cube

167
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that's twice its height and [eight] times its volume.

168
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And so this object is constantly expanding and contracting

169
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
to create a dynamic with people moving around it --

170
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
almost like it were trying

171
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
to conceal a secret within its seams or something.

172
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So we work with a lot of technology,

173
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
but we don't really love technology,

174
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years.

175
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
But we use it because we're interested

176
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
in the way that it can help us

177
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
to express the emotions and behavioral patterns

178
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
in these creatures that we create.

179
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And once a creature pops into our minds,

180
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
it's almost like the process of creation

181
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist

182
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move.

183
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Thank you.

184
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
(Applause)

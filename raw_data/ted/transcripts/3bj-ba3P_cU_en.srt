1
0:00:12.666,000 --> 0:00:16,000
When I opened Mott Hall Bridges Academy in 2010,

2
0:00:18.037,000 --> 0:00:19,000
my goal was simple:

3
0:00:20.555,000 --> 0:00:23,000
open a school to close a prison.

4
0:00:24.525,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Now to some, this was an audacious goal,

5
0:00:27.534,000 --> 0:00:3,000
because our school is located in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn --

6
0:00:31.773,000 --> 0:00:34,000
one of the most underserved and violent neighborhoods

7
0:00:34.997,000 --> 0:00:36,000
in all of New York City.

8
0:00:38.121,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Like many urban schools with high poverty rates,

9
0:00:42.427,000 --> 0:00:44,000
we face numerous challenges,

10
0:00:45.173,000 --> 0:00:47,000
like finding teachers who can empathize

11
0:00:47.623,000 --> 0:00:5,000
with the complexities of a disadvantaged community,

12
0:00:52.054,000 --> 0:00:54,000
lack of funding for technology,

13
0:00:54.675,000 --> 0:00:55,000
low parental involvement

14
0:00:57.433,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and neighborhood gangs that recruit children as early as fourth grade.

15
0:01:04.886,000 --> 0:01:05,000
So here I was,

16
0:01:07.416,000 --> 0:01:12,000
the founding principal of a middle school that was a district public school,

17
0:01:13.728,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and I only had 45 kids to start.

18
0:01:18.024,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Thirty percent of them had special needs.

19
0:01:21.797,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Eighty-six percent of them were below grade level

20
0:01:24.862,000 --> 0:01:26,000
in English and in math.

21
0:01:27.701,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And 100 percent were living below the poverty level.

22
0:01:33.258,000 --> 0:01:36,000
If our children are not in our classrooms,

23
0:01:36.591,000 --> 0:01:37,000
how will they learn?

24
0:01:38.731,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And if they're not learning,

25
0:01:40.529,000 --> 0:01:41,000
where would they end up?

26
0:01:43.402,000 --> 0:01:47,000
It was evident when I would ask my 13-year-old,

27
0:01:48.396,000 --> 0:01:49,000
"Young man,

28
0:01:49.681,000 --> 0:01:52,000
where do you see yourself in five years?"

29
0:01:53.663,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And his response:

30
0:01:55.691,000 --> 0:01:57,000
"I don't know if I'm gonna live that long."

31
0:01:58.971,000 --> 0:02:,000
Or to have a young woman say to me

32
0:02:03.252,000 --> 0:02:07,000
that she had a lifelong goal of working in a fast-food restaurant.

33
0:02:08.8,000 --> 0:02:1,000
To me, this was unacceptable.

34
0:02:11.862,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It was also evident that they had no idea

35
0:02:15.123,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that there was a landscape of opportunity

36
0:02:17.292,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that existed beyond their neighborhood.

37
0:02:21.055,000 --> 0:02:25,000
We call our students "scholars," because they're lifelong learners.

38
0:02:26.597,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And the skills that they learn today

39
0:02:28.401,000 --> 0:02:31,000
will prepare them for college and career readiness.

40
0:02:32.931,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I chose the royal colors of purple and black,

41
0:02:37.786,000 --> 0:02:41,000
because I want them to be reminded that they are descendants of greatness,

42
0:02:42.584,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and that through education,

43
0:02:44.433,000 --> 0:02:46,000
they are future engineers,

44
0:02:46.504,000 --> 0:02:47,000
scientists,

45
0:02:47.69,000 --> 0:02:48,000
entrepreneurs

46
0:02:49.077,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and even leaders who can and will take over this world.

47
0:02:54.544,000 --> 0:02:55,000
To date,

48
0:02:55.846,000 --> 0:02:58,000
we have had three graduating classes,

49
0:02:59.959,000 --> 0:03:,000
at a 98 --

50
0:03:01.369,000 --> 0:03:05,000
(Applause)

51
0:03:10.341,000 --> 0:03:12,000
At a 98-percent graduation rate.

52
0:03:14.12,000 --> 0:03:16,000
This is nearly 200 children,

53
0:03:16.977,000 --> 0:03:19,000
who are now going to some of the most competitive high schools

54
0:03:20.257,000 --> 0:03:21,000
in New York City.

55
0:03:21.755,000 --> 0:03:26,000
(Applause)

56
0:03:29.675,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It was a cold day in January

57
0:03:32.872,000 --> 0:03:35,000
when my scholar, Vidal Chastanet, met Brandon Stanton,

58
0:03:37.462,000 --> 0:03:4,000
the founder of the popular blog "Humans of New York."

59
0:03:42.102,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Brandon shared the story of a young man from Brownsville

60
0:03:46.019,000 --> 0:03:48,000
who had witnessed violence firsthand,

61
0:03:49.977,000 --> 0:03:52,000
by witnessing a man being thrown off of a roof.

62
0:03:54.264,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Yet he can still be influenced by a principal

63
0:03:57.727,000 --> 0:04:,000
who had opened up a school that believes in all children.

64
0:04:02.49,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Vidal embodies the story of so many of our underprivileged children

65
0:04:08.119,000 --> 0:04:1,000
who are struggling to survive,

66
0:04:10.859,000 --> 0:04:13,000
which is why we must make education a priority.

67
0:04:15.992,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Brandon's post created a global sensation

68
0:04:19.228,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that touched the lives of millions.

69
0:04:22.855,000 --> 0:04:25,000
This resulted in 1.4 million dollars being raised

70
0:04:27.39,000 --> 0:04:32,000
for our scholars to attend field trips to colleges and universities,

71
0:04:34.001,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Summer STEAM programs,

72
0:04:36.303,000 --> 0:04:38,000
as well as college scholarships.

73
0:04:39.792,000 --> 0:04:4,000
You need to understand

74
0:04:40.993,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that when 200 young people from Brownsville visited Harvard,

75
0:04:47.308,000 --> 0:04:48,000
they now understood

76
0:04:49.161,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that a college of their choice was a real possibility.

77
0:04:54.457,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And the impossibilities that had been imposed upon them

78
0:04:58.431,000 --> 0:05:,000
by a disadvantaged community

79
0:05:00.585,000 --> 0:05:03,000
were replaced by hope and purpose.

80
0:05:05.498,000 --> 0:05:09,000
The revolution in education is happening in our schools,

81
0:05:11.349,000 --> 0:05:14,000
with adults who provide love,

82
0:05:14.727,000 --> 0:05:15,000
structure,

83
0:05:15.927,000 --> 0:05:16,000
support

84
0:05:17.113,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and knowledge.

85
0:05:18.963,000 --> 0:05:2,000
These are the things that inspire children.

86
0:05:22.806,000 --> 0:05:24,000
But it is not an easy task.

87
0:05:25.815,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And there are high demands

88
0:05:28.709,000 --> 0:05:31,000
within an education system that is not perfect.

89
0:05:32.893,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But I have a dynamic group of educators

90
0:05:36.756,000 --> 0:05:4,000
who collaborate as a team to determine what is the best curriculum.

91
0:05:41.553,000 --> 0:05:43,000
They take time beyond their school day,

92
0:05:44.447,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and come in on weekends

93
0:05:45.768,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and even use their own money to often provide resources

94
0:05:50.921,000 --> 0:05:51,000
when we do not have it.

95
0:05:53.804,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And as the principal,

96
0:05:55.676,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I have to inspect what I expect.

97
0:05:59.308,000 --> 0:06:,000
So I show up in classes

98
0:06:01.836,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and I conduct observations to give feedback,

99
0:06:04.946,000 --> 0:06:07,000
because I want my teachers to be just as successful

100
0:06:08.385,000 --> 0:06:1,000
as the name Mott Hall Bridges Academy.

101
0:06:11.93,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And I give them access to me every single day,

102
0:06:15.646,000 --> 0:06:17,000
which is why they all have my personal cell number,

103
0:06:18.534,000 --> 0:06:21,000
including my scholars and those who graduated --

104
0:06:21.616,000 --> 0:06:23,000
which is probably why I get phone calls and text messages

105
0:06:24.598,000 --> 0:06:25,000
at three o'clock in the morning.

106
0:06:26.386,000 --> 0:06:27,000
(Laughter)

107
0:06:28.174,000 --> 0:06:3,000
But we are all connected to succeed,

108
0:06:30.794,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and good leaders do this.

109
0:06:34.282,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Tomorrow's future is sitting in our classrooms.

110
0:06:38.304,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And they are our responsibility.

111
0:06:41.526,000 --> 0:06:42,000
That means everyone in here,

112
0:06:43.527,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and those who are watching the screen.

113
0:06:46.649,000 --> 0:06:48,000
We must believe in their brilliance,

114
0:06:50.234,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and remind them by teaching them

115
0:06:52.867,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that there indeed is power in education.

116
0:06:58.047,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Thank you.

117
0:06:59.251,000 --> 0:07:09,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
If you think about the phone --

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and Intel has tested

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
a lot of the things I'm going to show you,

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
over the last 10 years,

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
in about 600 elderly households --

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
300 in Ireland, and 300 in Portland --

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
trying to understand: How do we measure

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and monitor behavior

9
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
in a medically meaningful way?

10
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And if you think about the phone, right,

11
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
it's something that we can use for some incredible ways

12
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
to help people actually take the right medication at the right time.

13
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
We're testing these kinds of simple

14
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
sensor-network technologies in the home

15
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
so that any phone that a senior is already comfortable with

16
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
can help them deal with their medications.

17
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And a lot of what they do is they pick up the phone,

18
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and it's our system whispering to them which pill they need to take,

19
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and they fake like they're having a conversation with a friend.

20
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And they're not embarrassed by a meds caddy that's ugly,

21
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that sits on their kitchen table and says,

22
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
"I'm old. I'm frail."

23
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
It's surreptitious technology

24
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that's helping them do a simple task

25
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
of taking the right pill at the right time.

26
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Now, we also do some pretty amazing things with these phones.

27
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Because that moment when you answer the phone

28
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
is a cognitive test every time that you do it.

29
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Think about it, all right? I'm going to answer the phone three different times.

30
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
"Hello? Hey."

31
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
All right? That's the first time.

32
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
"Hello? Uh, hey."

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
"Hello? Uh, who?

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Oh, hey."

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
All right? Very big differences

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
between the way I answered the phone the three times.

37
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And as we monitor phone usage

38
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
by seniors over a long period of time,

39
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
down to the tenths of a microsecond,

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that recognition moment

41
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
of whether they can figure out that person on the other end

42
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
is a friend and we start talking to them immediately,

43
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
or they do a lot of what's called trouble talk,

44
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
where they're like, "Wait, who is this? Oh." Right?

45
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Waiting for that recognition moment

46
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
may be the best early indicator of the onset of dementia

47
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
than anything that shows up clinically today.

48
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
We call these behavioral markers.

49
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
There's lots of others. Is the person going to the phone

50
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
as quickly, when it rings, as they used to?

51
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Is it a hearing problem or is it a physicality problem?

52
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Has their voice gotten more quiet? We're doing a lot of work with people

53
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
with Alzheimer's and particularly with Parkinson's,

54
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
where that quiet voice that sometimes shows up with Parkinson's patients

55
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
may be the best early indicator

56
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
of Parkinson's five to 10 years before it shows up clinically.

57
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
But those subtle changes in your voice over a long period of time

58
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
are hard for you or your spouse to notice until it becomes so extreme

59
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and your voice has become so quiet.

60
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
So, sensors are looking at that kind of voice.

61
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
When you pick up the phone,

62
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
how much tremor are you having,

63
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and what is that like, and what is that trend like over a period of time?

64
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Are you having more trouble dialing the phone than you used to?

65
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Is it a dexterity problem? Is it the onset of arthritis?

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Are you using the phone? Are you socializing less than you used to?

67
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
And looking at that pattern. And what does that decline in social health

68
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
mean, as a kind of a vital sign of the future?

69
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And then wow, what a radical idea,

70
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
we -- except in the United States --

71
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
might be able to use this newfangled technology

72
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
to actually interact with a nurse or a doctor on the other end of the line.

73
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Wow, what a great day that will be

74
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
once we're allowed to actually do those kinds of things.

75
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So, these are what I would call behavioral markers.

76
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And it's the whole field that we've been trying to work on

77
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
for the last 10 years at Intel.

78
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
How do you put simple disruptive technologies,

79
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and the first of five phrases that I'm going to talk about in this talk?

80
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Behavioral markers matter.

81
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
How do we change behavior?

82
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
How do we measure changes in behavior

83
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
in a meaningful way that's going to help us with

84
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
prevention of disease, early onset of disease,

85
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and tracking the progression of disease over a long period of time?

86
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Now, why would Intel let me

87
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
spend a lot of time and money, over the last 10 years,

88
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
trying to understand the needs of seniors

89
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and start thinking about these kinds of behavioral markers?

90
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
This is some of the field work that we've done.

91
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
We have now lived with 1,000 elderly households

92
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
in 20 countries over the last 10 years.

93
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
We study people in Rochester, New York.

94
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
We go live with them in the winter

95
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
because what they do in the winter,

96
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and their access to healthcare, and how much they socialize,

97
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
is very different than in the summer.

98
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
If they have a hip fracture we go with them

99
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and we study their entire discharge experience.

100
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
If they have a family member who is a key part of their care network,

101
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
we fly and study them as well.

102
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So, we study the holistic health experience

103
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
of 1,000 seniors over the last 10 years

104
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
in 20 different countries.

105
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Why is Intel willing to fund that?

106
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It's because of the second slogan that I want to talk about.

107
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Ten years ago, when I started trying to convince Intel

108
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
to let me go start looking at disruptive technologies

109
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that could help with independent living,

110
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
this is what I called it: "Y2K + 10."

111
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
You know, back in 2000,

112
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
we were all so obsessed with paying attention

113
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
to the aging of our computers,

114
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and whether or not they were going to survive

115
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
the tick of the clock from 1999 to 2000,

116
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that we missed a moment that only demographers were paying attention to.

117
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
It was right around New Years.

118
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And that switchover,

119
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
when we had the larger number of older people on the planet,

120
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
for the first time than younger people.

121
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
For the first time in human history -- and barring aliens landing

122
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
or some major other pandemic,

123
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that's the expectation from demographers, going forward.

124
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And 10 years ago it seemed like I had a lot of time

125
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
to convince Intel to work on this. Right?

126
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Y2K + 10 was coming,

127
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
the baby boomers starting to retire.

128
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Well folks, it's like we know these demographics here.

129
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
This is a map of the entire world.

130
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
It's like the lights are on,

131
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
but nobody's home on this demographic

132
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Y2K + 10 problem. Right?

133
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I mean we sort of get it here, but we don't get it here,

134
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and we're not doing anything about it.

135
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
The health reform bill is largely ignoring

136
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
the realities of the age wave that's coming,

137
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and the implications for what we need to do to change

138
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
not only how we pay for care,

139
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
but deliver care in some radically different ways.

140
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And in fact, it's upon us.

141
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I mean you probably saw these headlines. This is Catherine Casey

142
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
who is the first boomer to actually get Social Security.

143
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
That actually occurred this year. She took early retirement.

144
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
She was born one second after midnight in 1946.

145
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
A retired school teacher,

146
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
there she is with a Social Security administrator.

147
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
The first boomer actually, we didn't even wait till 2011, next year.

148
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
We're already starting to see early retirement occur this year.

149
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
All right, so it's here. This Y2K + 10 problem is at our door.

150
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
This is 50 tsunamis scheduled on the calendar,

151
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
but somehow we can't sort of marshal our government

152
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and innovative forces to sort of get out in front of it

153
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and do something about it. We'll wait until

154
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
it's more of a catastrophe, and react,

155
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
as opposed to prepare for it.

156
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So, one of the reasons it's so

157
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
challenging to prepare for this Y2K problem

158
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
is, I want to argue, we have what I would call

159
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
mainframe poisoning.

160
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Andy Grove, about six or seven years ago,

161
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
he doesn't even know or remember this, in a Fortune Magazine article

162
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
he used the phrase "mainframe healthcare,"

163
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and I've been extending and expanding this.

164
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
He saw it written down somewhere. He's like, "Eric that's a really cool concept."

165
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I was like, "Actually it was your idea. You said it in a Fortune Magazine article.

166
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
I just extended it."

167
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
You know, this is the mainframe.

168
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
This mentality of traveling to

169
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and timesharing large, expensive healthcare systems

170
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
actually began in 1787.

171
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
This is the first general hospital in Vienna.

172
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And actually the second general hospital in Vienna,

173
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
in about 1850, was where we started to build out

174
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
an entire curriculum for teaching med students specialties.

175
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And it's a place in which we started developing

176
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
architecture that literally divided the body,

177
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and divided care into departments and compartments.

178
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And it was reflected in our architecture,

179
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
it was reflected in the way that we taught students,

180
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and this mainframe mentality persists today.

181
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Now, I'm not anti-hospital.

182
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
With my own healthcare problems, I've taken drug therapies,

183
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I've traveled to this hospital and others, many, many times.

184
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
But we worship the high hospital on a hill. Right?

185
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And this is mainframe healthcare.

186
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And just as 30 years ago

187
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
we couldn't conceive that we would have the power

188
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
of a mainframe computer that took up a room this size

189
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
in our purses and on our belts,

190
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that we're carrying around in our cell phone today,

191
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and suddenly, computing,

192
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
that used to be an expert driven system,

193
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
it was a personal system that we all owned as part of our daily lives --

194
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
that shift from mainframe to personal computing

195
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
is what we have to do for healthcare.

196
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
We have to shift from this mainframe mentality of healthcare

197
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
to a personal model of healthcare.

198
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
We are obsessed with this way of thinking.

199
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
When Intel does surveys all around the world and we say,

200
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
"Quick response: healthcare."

201
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
The first word that comes up is "doctor."

202
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
The second that comes up is "hospital." And the third is "illness" or "sickness." Right?

203
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
We are wired, in our imagination, to think about healthcare

204
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and healthcare innovation as something

205
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that goes into that place.

206
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Our entire health reform discussion right now,

207
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
health I.T., when we talk with policy makers,

208
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
equals "How are we going to get doctors using

209
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
electronic medical records in the mainframe?"

210
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
We're not thinking about

211
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
how do we shift from the mainframe to the home.

212
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And the problem with this is

213
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
the way we conceive healthcare. Right?

214
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
This is a very reactive, crisis-driven system.

215
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
We're doing 15-minute exams with patients.

216
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
It's population-based.

217
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
We collect a bunch of biological information in this artificial setting,

218
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and we fix them up, like Humpty-Dumpty all over again,

219
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and send them home,

220
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and hope -- we might hand them a brochure, maybe an interactive website --

221
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that they do as asked and don't come back into the mainframe.

222
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And the problem is we can't afford it today, folks.

223
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
We can't afford mainframe healthcare today to include the uninsured.

224
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And now we want to do a double-double

225
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
of the age wave coming through?

226
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Business as usual in healthcare is broken and we've got to do something different.

227
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
We've got to focus on the home.

228
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
We've got to focus on a personal healthcare paradigm

229
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
that moves care to the home. How do we be more proactive,

230
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
prevention-driven?

231
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
How do we collect vital signs and other kinds of information 24 by 7?

232
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
How do we get a personal baseline about what's going to work for you?

233
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
How do we collect not just biological data

234
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
but behavioral data, psychological data,

235
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
relational data, in and on and around the home?

236
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And how do we drive compliance to be a customized care plan

237
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
that uses all this great technology that's around us

238
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
to change our behavior?

239
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
That's what we need to do for our personal health model.

240
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
I want to give you a couple of examples. This is Mimi

241
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
from one of our studies --

242
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
in her 90s, had to move out of her home

243
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
because her family was worried about falls.

244
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Raise your hand if you had a serious fall

245
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
in your household, or any of your loved ones,

246
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
your parents or so forth. Right?

247
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Classic. Hip fracture often leads to institutionalization of a senior.

248
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
This is what was happening to Mimi; the family was worried about it,

249
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
moved her out of her own home into an assisted living facility.

250
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
She tripped over her oxygen tank.

251
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Many people in this generation won't press the button,

252
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
even if they have an alert call system, because they don't want to bother anybody,

253
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
even though they've been paying 30 dollars a month.

254
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Boomers will press the button. Trust me.

255
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
They're going to be pressing that button non-stop. Right?

256
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Mimi broke her pelvis, lay all night, all morning,

257
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
finally somebody came in and found her,

258
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
sent her to the hospital.

259
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
They fixed her back up. She was never going to be able to move back

260
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
into the assisted living. They put her into the nursing home unit.

261
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
First night in the nursing home unit where she had been

262
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
in the same assisted living facility, moved her from one bed to another,

263
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
kind of threw her, rebroke her pelvis,

264
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
sent her back to the hospital that she had just come from,

265
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
no one read the chart, put her on Tylenol,

266
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
which she is allergic to, broke out, got bedsores,

267
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
basically, had heart problems, and died

268
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
from the fall and the complications and the errors that were there.

269
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Now, the most frightening thing about this is

270
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
this is my wife's grandmother.

271
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Now, I'm Eric Dishman. I speak English,

272
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
I work for Intel, I make a good salary,

273
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
I'm smart about falls and fall-related injuries --

274
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
it's an area of research that I work on.

275
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
I have access to senators and CEOs.

276
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
I can't stop this from happening.

277
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
What happens if you don't have money, you don't speak English

278
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
or don't have the kind of access

279
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
to deal with these kinds of problems that inevitably occur?

280
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
How do we actually prevent the vast majority of falls

281
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
from ever occurring in the first place?

282
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Let me give you a quick example of work that we're doing

283
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
to try to do exactly that.

284
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
I've been wearing a little technology that we call Shimmer.

285
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
It's a research platform.

286
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
It has accelerometry. You can plug in a three-lead ECG.

287
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
There is all kinds of sort of plug-and-play

288
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
kind of Legos that you can do to capture, in the wild,

289
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
in the real world,

290
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
things like tremor, gait,

291
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
stride length and those kinds of things.

292
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
The problem is, our understanding of falls today,

293
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
like Mimi, is get a survey in the mail three months after you fell,

294
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
from the State, saying, "What were you doing when you fell?"

295
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
That's sort of the state of the art.

296
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
But with something like Shimmer, or we have something called the Magic Carpet,

297
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
embedded sensors in carpet, or camera-based systems

298
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
that we borrowed from sports medicine,

299
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
we're starting for the first time in those 600 elderly households

300
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
to collect actual kinematic motion data

301
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
to understand: What are the subtle changes that are occurring

302
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
that can show us that mom has become risk at falls?

303
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And most often we can do two interventions,

304
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
fix the meds mix.

305
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
I'm a qualitative researcher, but when I look at these data streams coming in

306
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
from these homes, I can look at the data and tell you the day

307
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
that some doctor prescribed them something that nobody else

308
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
knew that they were on, because we see the changes

309
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
in their patterns in the household. Right?

310
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
These discoveries of behavioral markers,

311
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and behavioral changes

312
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
are game changing, and like the discovery of the microscope

313
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
because of our collecting data streams that we've actually never done before.

314
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
This is an example in our TRIL Clinic in Ireland

315
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
of -- actually what you're seeing is

316
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
she's looking at data,

317
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
in this picture, from the Magic Carpet.

318
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
So, we have a little carpet that you can look at your amount of postural sway,

319
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and look at the changes in your postural sway over many months.

320
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Here's what some of this data might look like.

321
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
This is actually sensor firings.

322
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
These are two different subjects in our study.

323
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
It's about a year's worth of data.

324
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
The color represents different rooms they are in the house.

325
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
This person on the left is living in their own home.

326
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
This person on the right is actually living in an assisted living facility.

327
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
I know this because look at how punctuated meal time is

328
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
when they are no longer in their particular rooms here. Right?

329
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Now, this doesn't mean that much to you.

330
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
But when we look at these cycles of data

331
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
over a longer period of time -- and we're looking at everything from

332
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
motion around different rooms in the house,

333
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
to sort of micro-motions that Shimmer picks up,

334
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
about gait and stride length -- these streams of data

335
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
are starting to tell us things about behavioral patterns

336
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
that we've never understood before.

337
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
You can go to ORCATech.org --

338
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
it has nothing to do with whales, it's the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology --

339
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
to see more about that.

340
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
The problem is, Intel is still one of the largest

341
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
funders in the world

342
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
of independent living technology research.

343
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
I'm not bragging about how much we fund;

344
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
it's how little anyone else actually pays attention

345
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
to aging and funds innovation on aging,

346
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
chronic disease management and independent living in the home.

347
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
So, my mantra here, my fourth slogan is:

348
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
10,000 households or bust.

349
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
We need to drive

350
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
a national, if not international, Framingham-type heart study

351
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
of independent living technologies,

352
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
where we have 10,000 elderly connected households

353
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
with broadband, full medical characterization,

354
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and a platform by which we can start to experiment

355
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
and turn these from 20-household anecdotal studies

356
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
that the universities fund,

357
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
to large clinical trials that prove out the value of these technologies.

358
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
So, 10,000 households or bust.

359
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
These are just some of the households that we've done in the Intel studies.

360
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
My fifth and final phrase:

361
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
I have tried for two years,

362
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and there were moments when we were quite close,

363
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
to make this healthcare reform bill be about reform

364
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
from something and to something,

365
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
from a mainframe model

366
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
to a personal health model,

367
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
or to mean something more than just a debate

368
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
about the public option and how we're going to finance.

369
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
It doesn't matter how we finance healthcare.

370
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
We're going to figure something out

371
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
for the next 10 years, and try it.

372
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
No matter who pays for it,

373
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
we better start doing care in a fundamentally different way

374
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and treating the home and the patient

375
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
and the family member and the caregivers

376
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
as part of these coordinated care teams

377
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
and using disruptive technologies that are already here

378
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
to do care in some pretty fundamental different ways.

379
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
The president needs to stand up and say,

380
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
at the end of a healthcare reform debate,

381
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
"Our goal as a country is to move 50 percent of care

382
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
out of institutions, clinics, hospitals and nursing homes,

383
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
to the home, in 10 years."

384
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
It's achievable. We should do it economically,

385
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
we should do it morally,

386
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and we should do it for quality of life.

387
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
But there is no goal within this health reform.

388
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
It's just a mess today.

389
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
So, you know, that's my last message to you.

390
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
How do we set a going-to-the-moon goal

391
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
of dealing with the Y2K +10 problem that's coming?

392
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
It's not that innovation and technology is going to be the

393
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
magic pill that cures all, but it's going to be part of the solution.

394
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
And if we don't create a personal health movement,

395
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
something that we're all aiming towards in reform,

396
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
then we're going to move nowhere.

397
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
So, I hope you'll turn this conference into that kind of movement forward.

398
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
Thanks very much.

399
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.903,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Thirteen years ago,

2
0:00:15.069,000 --> 0:00:21,000
we set ourselves a goal to end poverty.

3
0:00:21.45,000 --> 0:00:23,000
After some success,

4
0:00:24.069,000 --> 0:00:27,000
we've hit a big hurdle.

5
0:00:27.123,000 --> 0:00:29,000
The aftermath of the financial crisis

6
0:00:29.644,000 --> 0:00:31,000
has begun to hit aid payments,

7
0:00:32.369,000 --> 0:00:36,000
which have fallen for two consecutive years.

8
0:00:37.133,000 --> 0:00:4,000
My question is whether the lessons learned

9
0:00:41.112,000 --> 0:00:44,000
from saving the financial system

10
0:00:45.032,000 --> 0:00:48,000
can be used to help us overcome that hurdle

11
0:00:48.514,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and help millions.

12
0:00:51.719,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Can we simply print money for aid?

13
0:00:58.629,000 --> 0:00:59,000
"Surely not."

14
0:01:00.136,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It's a common reaction.

15
0:01:02.145,000 --> 0:01:03,000
(Laughter)

16
0:01:03.167,000 --> 0:01:05,000
It's a quick talk.

17
0:01:05.677,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Others channel John McEnroe.

18
0:01:10.454,000 --> 0:01:11,000
"You cannot be serious!"

19
0:01:12.426,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Now, I can't do the accent, but I am serious,

20
0:01:17.357,000 --> 0:01:21,000
thanks to these two children,

21
0:01:21.357,000 --> 0:01:24,000
who, as you'll learn, are very much at the heart

22
0:01:25.037,000 --> 0:01:27,000
of my talk.

23
0:01:27.529,000 --> 0:01:29,000
On the left, we have Pia.

24
0:01:30.495,000 --> 0:01:31,000
She lives in England.

25
0:01:32.085,000 --> 0:01:35,000
She has two loving parents,

26
0:01:35.229,000 --> 0:01:39,000
one of whom is standing right here.

27
0:01:40.129,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Dorothy, on the right,

28
0:01:42.521,000 --> 0:01:44,000
lives in rural Kenya.

29
0:01:45.42,000 --> 0:01:47,000
She's one of 13,000 orphans

30
0:01:48.059,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and vulnerable children

31
0:01:49.564,000 --> 0:01:54,000
who are assisted by a charity that I support.

32
0:01:54.912,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I do that because I believe

33
0:01:57.692,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that Dorothy, like Pia,

34
0:02:00.013,000 --> 0:02:03,000
deserves the best life chances

35
0:02:03.351,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that we can afford to give her.

36
0:02:05.915,000 --> 0:02:08,000
You'll all agree with me, I'm sure.

37
0:02:08.954,000 --> 0:02:1,000
The U.N. agrees too.

38
0:02:11.564,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Their overriding aim

39
0:02:13.616,000 --> 0:02:15,000
for international aid

40
0:02:15.692,000 --> 0:02:21,000
is to strive for a life of dignity for all.

41
0:02:21.834,000 --> 0:02:25,000
But -- and here's that hurdle --

42
0:02:26.354,000 --> 0:02:3,000
can we afford our aid aspirations?

43
0:02:30.904,000 --> 0:02:33,000
History suggests not.

44
0:02:34.197,000 --> 0:02:39,000
In 1970, governments set themselves a target

45
0:02:39.519,000 --> 0:02:41,000
to increase overseas aid payments

46
0:02:42.014,000 --> 0:02:44,000
to 0.7 percent

47
0:02:44.283,000 --> 0:02:45,000
of their national income.

48
0:02:45.922,000 --> 0:02:49,000
As you can see, a big gap opens up

49
0:02:50.199,000 --> 0:02:54,000
between actual aid and that target.

50
0:02:54.793,000 --> 0:02:58,000
But then come the Millennium Development Goals,

51
0:02:59.056,000 --> 0:03:01,000
eight ambitious targets

52
0:03:01.465,000 --> 0:03:04,000
to be met by 2015.

53
0:03:05.373,000 --> 0:03:07,000
If I tell you that just one of those targets

54
0:03:08.368,000 --> 0:03:12,000
is to eradicate extreme hunger and poverty,

55
0:03:12.551,000 --> 0:03:14,000
you get a sense of the ambition.

56
0:03:15.369,000 --> 0:03:18,000
There's also been some success.

57
0:03:18.974,000 --> 0:03:19,000
The number of people living

58
0:03:20.283,000 --> 0:03:25,000
on less than $1.25 a day has halved.

59
0:03:26.259,000 --> 0:03:29,000
But a lot remains to be done in two years.

60
0:03:29.986,000 --> 0:03:32,000
One in eight remain hungry.

61
0:03:33.677,000 --> 0:03:35,000
In the context of this auditorium,

62
0:03:36.288,000 --> 0:03:4,000
the front two rows aren't going to get any food.

63
0:03:40.736,000 --> 0:03:42,000
We can't settle for that,

64
0:03:42.894,000 --> 0:03:46,000
which is why the concern about the eighth goal,

65
0:03:47.398,000 --> 0:03:48,000
which relates to funding,

66
0:03:49.218,000 --> 0:03:51,000
which I said at the beginning is falling,

67
0:03:52.132,000 --> 0:03:56,000
is so troubling.

68
0:03:56.592,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So what can be done?

69
0:03:58.646,000 --> 0:04:,000
Well, I work in financial markets,

70
0:04:01.638,000 --> 0:04:03,000
not development.

71
0:04:04.089,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I study the behavior of investors,

72
0:04:07.126,000 --> 0:04:12,000
how they react to policy and the economy.

73
0:04:12.712,000 --> 0:04:16,000
It gives me a different angle on the aid issue.

74
0:04:17.345,000 --> 0:04:19,000
But it took an innocent question

75
0:04:19.866,000 --> 0:04:21,000
from my then-four-year-old daughter

76
0:04:22.501,000 --> 0:04:26,000
to make me appreciate that.

77
0:04:26.56,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Pia and I were on the way to a local cafe

78
0:04:29.755,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and we passed a man collecting for charity.

79
0:04:34.171,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I didn't have any change to give him,

80
0:04:35.722,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and she was disappointed.

81
0:04:38.223,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Once in the cafe, Pia takes out her coloring book

82
0:04:42.001,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and starts scribbling.

83
0:04:43.743,000 --> 0:04:47,000
After a little while, I ask her what she's doing,

84
0:04:47.767,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and she shows me a drawing

85
0:04:50.303,000 --> 0:04:52,000
of a £5 note

86
0:04:52.515,000 --> 0:04:54,000
to give to the man outside.

87
0:04:54.558,000 --> 0:04:55,000
It's so sweet,

88
0:04:55.811,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and more generous than Dad would have been.

89
0:04:58.911,000 --> 0:04:59,000
But of course I explained to her,

90
0:05:00.837,000 --> 0:05:02,000
"You can't do that; it's not allowed."

91
0:05:03.34,000 --> 0:05:07,000
To which I get the classic four-year-old response:

92
0:05:08.034,000 --> 0:05:1,000
"Why not?"

93
0:05:10.582,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Now I'm excited, because I actually think

94
0:05:12.996,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I can answer this time.

95
0:05:14.837,000 --> 0:05:16,000
So I launch into an explanation of how

96
0:05:17.752,000 --> 0:05:2,000
an unlimited supply of money

97
0:05:21.067,000 --> 0:05:24,000
chasing a limited number of goods

98
0:05:24.246,000 --> 0:05:28,000
sends prices to the moon.

99
0:05:31.036,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Something about that exchange stuck with me,

100
0:05:35.355,000 --> 0:05:37,000
not because of the look of relief

101
0:05:37.458,000 --> 0:05:39,000
on Pia's face when I finally finished,

102
0:05:39.721,000 --> 0:05:43,000
but because it related

103
0:05:44.511,000 --> 0:05:48,000
to the sanctity of the money supply,

104
0:05:49.412,000 --> 0:05:53,000
a sanctity that had been challenged and questioned

105
0:05:53.714,000 --> 0:05:55,000
by the reaction of central banks

106
0:05:56.633,000 --> 0:05:58,000
to the financial crisis.

107
0:05:59.109,000 --> 0:06:01,000
To reassure investors,

108
0:06:01.676,000 --> 0:06:05,000
central banks began buying assets

109
0:06:06.573,000 --> 0:06:11,000
to try and encourage investors to do the same.

110
0:06:11.609,000 --> 0:06:14,000
They funded these purchases

111
0:06:15.207,000 --> 0:06:18,000
with money they created themselves.

112
0:06:18.756,000 --> 0:06:21,000
The money wasn't actually physically printed.

113
0:06:22.042,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It's still sort of locked away in the banking system today.

114
0:06:25.656,000 --> 0:06:3,000
But the amount created was unprecedented.

115
0:06:30.857,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Together, the central banks of the U.S.,

116
0:06:34.362,000 --> 0:06:35,000
U.K and Japan

117
0:06:36.232,000 --> 0:06:39,000
increased the stock of money in their economies

118
0:06:39.622,000 --> 0:06:43,000
by 3.7 trillion dollars.

119
0:06:43.65,000 --> 0:06:46,000
That's three times, in fact that's more than three times,

120
0:06:47.105,000 --> 0:06:51,000
the total physical stock of dollar notes in circulation.

121
0:06:51.917,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Three times!

122
0:06:56.165,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Before the crisis,

123
0:06:58.075,000 --> 0:07:02,000
this would have been utterly unthinkable,

124
0:07:03.023,000 --> 0:07:1,000
yet it was accepted remarkably quickly.

125
0:07:10.487,000 --> 0:07:12,000
The price of gold,

126
0:07:12.514,000 --> 0:07:14,000
an asset thought to protect against inflation,

127
0:07:15.262,000 --> 0:07:17,000
did jump,

128
0:07:18.088,000 --> 0:07:2,000
but investors bought other assets

129
0:07:20.886,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that offered little protection from inflation.

130
0:07:23.517,000 --> 0:07:26,000
They bought fixed income securities, bonds.

131
0:07:27.061,000 --> 0:07:29,000
They bought equities too.

132
0:07:29.828,000 --> 0:07:31,000
For all the scare stories,

133
0:07:32.487,000 --> 0:07:35,000
the actual actions of investors

134
0:07:35.516,000 --> 0:07:41,000
spoke of rapid acceptance and confidence.

135
0:07:42.041,000 --> 0:07:47,000
That confidence was based on two pillars.

136
0:07:47.716,000 --> 0:07:49,000
The first was that, after years

137
0:07:50.181,000 --> 0:07:53,000
of keeping inflation under control,

138
0:07:53.437,000 --> 0:07:55,000
central banks were trusted

139
0:07:56.244,000 --> 0:07:59,000
to take the money-printing away

140
0:07:59.531,000 --> 0:08:02,000
if inflation became a threat.

141
0:08:03.152,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Secondly, inflation simply never became a threat.

142
0:08:09.381,000 --> 0:08:1,000
As you can see, in the United States,

143
0:08:11.249,000 --> 0:08:13,000
inflation for most of this period

144
0:08:13.29,000 --> 0:08:16,000
remained below average.

145
0:08:16.747,000 --> 0:08:19,000
It was the same elsewhere.

146
0:08:20.019,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So how does all this relate to aid?

147
0:08:23.436,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Well, this is where Dorothy

148
0:08:27.311,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and the Mango Tree charity

149
0:08:29.777,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that supports her comes in.

150
0:08:32.335,000 --> 0:08:34,000
I was at one of their fundraising events

151
0:08:34.432,000 --> 0:08:35,000
earlier this year,

152
0:08:35.652,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and I was inspired to give a one-off donation

153
0:08:39.401,000 --> 0:08:41,000
when I remembered that my firm

154
0:08:42.239,000 --> 0:08:45,000
offers to match the charitable contributions

155
0:08:45.498,000 --> 0:08:47,000
its employees make.

156
0:08:48.241,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So think of this:

157
0:08:50.967,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Instead of just being able to help Dorothy

158
0:08:53.254,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and four of her classmates

159
0:08:55.96,000 --> 0:08:57,000
to go through secondary school for a few years,

160
0:08:58.24,000 --> 0:09:02,000
I was able to double my contribution.

161
0:09:02.544,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Brilliant.

162
0:09:04.957,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So following that conversation with my daughter,

163
0:09:10.92,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and seeing the absence of inflation

164
0:09:13.557,000 --> 0:09:14,000
in the face of money-printing,

165
0:09:15.504,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and knowing that international aid payments

166
0:09:18.591,000 --> 0:09:21,000
were falling at just the wrong time,

167
0:09:21.903,000 --> 0:09:24,000
this made me wonder:

168
0:09:25.864,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Could we match

169
0:09:27.959,000 --> 0:09:33,000
but just on a much grander scale?

170
0:09:34.009,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Let's call this scheme "Print Aid."

171
0:09:38.462,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And here's how it might work.

172
0:09:41.12,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Provided it saw little inflation risk from doing so,

173
0:09:46.277,000 --> 0:09:48,000
the central bank would be mandated

174
0:09:48.587,000 --> 0:09:51,000
to match the government's overseas aid payments

175
0:09:51.98,000 --> 0:09:53,000
up to a certain limit.

176
0:09:54.447,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Governments have been aiming to get aid

177
0:09:56.52,000 --> 0:09:57,000
to 0.7 percent for years,

178
0:09:58.238,000 --> 0:10:,000
so let's set the limit at half of that,

179
0:10:01.123,000 --> 0:10:05,000
0.35 percent of their income.

180
0:10:05.232,000 --> 0:10:07,000
So it would work like this: If in a given year

181
0:10:07.304,000 --> 0:10:09,000
the government gave 0.2 percent of its income

182
0:10:09.99,000 --> 0:10:1,000
to overseas aid,

183
0:10:11.122,000 --> 0:10:12,000
the central bank would simply top it up

184
0:10:12.605,000 --> 0:10:15,000
with a further 0.2 percent.

185
0:10:15.781,000 --> 0:10:18,000
So far so good.

186
0:10:19.382,000 --> 0:10:21,000
How risky is this?

187
0:10:22.062,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Well, this involves the creation of money

188
0:10:26.304,000 --> 0:10:28,000
to buy goods, not assets.

189
0:10:29.112,000 --> 0:10:32,000
It sounds more inflationary already, doesn't it.

190
0:10:32.665,000 --> 0:10:36,000
But there are two important mitigating factors here.

191
0:10:37.093,000 --> 0:10:4,000
The first is that by definition,

192
0:10:40.636,000 --> 0:10:45,000
this money printed would be spent overseas.

193
0:10:45.786,000 --> 0:10:48,000
So it's not obvious how it leads to inflation

194
0:10:49.327,000 --> 0:10:53,000
in the country doing the actual printing

195
0:10:53.736,000 --> 0:10:57,000
unless it leads to a currency depreciation of that country.

196
0:10:58.67,000 --> 0:11:01,000
That is unlikely for the second reason:

197
0:11:01.963,000 --> 0:11:03,000
the scale of the money that would be printed

198
0:11:04.844,000 --> 0:11:06,000
under this scheme.

199
0:11:07.664,000 --> 0:11:1,000
So let's think of an example

200
0:11:10.804,000 --> 0:11:13,000
where Print Aid was in place

201
0:11:14.347,000 --> 0:11:18,000
in the U.S., U.K. and Japan.

202
0:11:18.689,000 --> 0:11:2,000
To match the aid payments made

203
0:11:20.992,000 --> 0:11:22,000
by those governments over the last four years,

204
0:11:23.728,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Print Aid would have generated

205
0:11:25.955,000 --> 0:11:29,000
200 billion dollars' worth of extra aid.

206
0:11:30.29,000 --> 0:11:32,000
What would that look like

207
0:11:32.477,000 --> 0:11:35,000
in the context of the increase in the money stock

208
0:11:36.079,000 --> 0:11:38,000
that had already happened in those countries

209
0:11:38.355,000 --> 0:11:4,000
to save the financial system?

210
0:11:40.436,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Are you read for this?

211
0:11:43.593,000 --> 0:11:45,000
You might struggle to see that at the back,

212
0:11:45.677,000 --> 0:11:48,000
because the gap is quite small.

213
0:11:49.247,000 --> 0:11:51,000
So what we're saying here

214
0:11:51.695,000 --> 0:11:54,000
is that we took a $3.7 trillion gamble

215
0:11:55.163,000 --> 0:11:57,000
to save our financial systems,

216
0:11:57.539,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and you know what, it paid off.

217
0:11:59.594,000 --> 0:12:01,000
There was no inflation.

218
0:12:02.167,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Are we really saying that it's not worth the risk

219
0:12:05.473,000 --> 0:12:09,000
to print an extra 200 billion for aid?

220
0:12:10.125,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Would the risks really be that different?

221
0:12:12.034,000 --> 0:12:14,000
To me, it's not that clear.

222
0:12:14.577,000 --> 0:12:17,000
What is clear is the impact on aid.

223
0:12:17.935,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Even though this is the printing

224
0:12:20.051,000 --> 0:12:21,000
of just three central banks,

225
0:12:21.887,000 --> 0:12:24,000
the global aid that's given

226
0:12:25.508,000 --> 0:12:29,000
over this period is up by almost 40 percent.

227
0:12:30.429,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Aid as a proportion of national income

228
0:12:32.86,000 --> 0:12:35,000
all of a sudden is at a 40-year high.

229
0:12:36.31,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Now, we don't get to 0.7 percent.

230
0:12:39.297,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Governments are still incentivized to give.

231
0:12:42.042,000 --> 0:12:46,000
But you know what, that's the point of a matching scheme.

232
0:12:46.535,000 --> 0:12:49,000
So I think what we've learned

233
0:12:50.35,000 --> 0:12:54,000
is that the risks from this money creation scheme

234
0:12:54.944,000 --> 0:12:56,000
are quite modest,

235
0:12:57.725,000 --> 0:12:59,000
but the benefits

236
0:13:00.525,000 --> 0:13:02,000
are potentially huge.

237
0:13:02.991,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Imagine what we could do with 40 percent more funding.

238
0:13:06.294,000 --> 0:13:1,000
We might be able to feed the front row.

239
0:13:11.265,000 --> 0:13:13,000
The thing that I fear, the only thing that I fear,

240
0:13:13.963,000 --> 0:13:14,000
apart from the fact that I've run out of time,

241
0:13:15.687,000 --> 0:13:19,000
is that the window of opportunity for this idea

242
0:13:20.404,000 --> 0:13:22,000
is a short one.

243
0:13:23.237,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Today, money creation by central banks

244
0:13:27.062,000 --> 0:13:29,000
is an accepted policy tool.

245
0:13:29.976,000 --> 0:13:31,000
That may not always be the case.

246
0:13:32.457,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Today there are universally agreed aims

247
0:13:36.82,000 --> 0:13:37,000
for international aid.

248
0:13:38.711,000 --> 0:13:41,000
That may not always be the case.

249
0:13:42.331,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Today might be the only time

250
0:13:44.969,000 --> 0:13:46,000
that these two things coincide,

251
0:13:47.852,000 --> 0:13:5,000
such that we can afford the aid

252
0:13:51.827,000 --> 0:13:54,000
that we've always aspired to give.

253
0:13:55.47,000 --> 0:14:03,000
So, can we print money for international aid?

254
0:14:03.9,000 --> 0:14:06,000
I seriously believe the question should be,

255
0:14:07.638,000 --> 0:14:09,000
why not?

256
0:14:09.701,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Thank you very much.

257
0:14:12.514,000 --> 0:14:17,000
(Applause)

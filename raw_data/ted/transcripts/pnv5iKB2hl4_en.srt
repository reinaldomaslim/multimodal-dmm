1
0:00:13.047,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I know what you're thinking:

2
0:00:15.063,000 --> 0:00:16,000
"Why does that guy get to sit down?"

3
0:00:17.94,000 --> 0:00:2,000
That's because this is radio.

4
0:00:21.097,000 --> 0:00:24,000
(Music)

5
0:00:24.521,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I tell radio stories about design,

6
0:00:27.494,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and I report on all kinds of stories:

7
0:00:29.293,000 --> 0:00:33,000
buildings and toothbrushes, mascots and wayfinding and fonts.

8
0:00:33.864,000 --> 0:00:36,000
My mission is to get people to engage with the design that they care about

9
0:00:37.873,000 --> 0:00:4,000
so they begin to pay attention to all forms of design.

10
0:00:41.289,000 --> 0:00:45,000
When you decode the world with design intent in mind,

11
0:00:45.619,000 --> 0:00:47,000
the world becomes kind of magical.

12
0:00:48.044,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Instead of seeing the broken things,

13
0:00:50.365,000 --> 0:00:52,000
you see all the little bits of genius

14
0:00:52.666,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that anonymous designers have sweated over to make our lives better.

15
0:00:57.17,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And that's essentially the definition of design:

16
0:00:59.505,000 --> 0:01:02,000
making life better and providing joy.

17
0:01:03.245,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And few things give me greater joy

18
0:01:05.54,000 --> 0:01:07,000
than a well-designed flag.

19
0:01:08.596,000 --> 0:01:09,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:09.77,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Yeah!

21
0:01:11.057,000 --> 0:01:13,000
(Applause)

22
0:01:13.279,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Happy 50th anniversary on your flag, Canada.

23
0:01:15.781,000 --> 0:01:17,000
It is beautiful, gold standard.

24
0:01:18.415,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Love it.

25
0:01:19.772,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I'm kind of obsessed with flags.

26
0:01:22.386,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Sometimes I bring up the topic of flags,

27
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and people are like, "I don't care about flags,"

28
0:01:27.948,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and then we start talking about flags, and trust me,

29
0:01:31.294,000 --> 0:01:33,000
100 percent of people care about flags.

30
0:01:33.846,000 --> 0:01:36,000
There's just something about them that works on our emotions.

31
0:01:37.361,000 --> 0:01:41,000
My family wrapped my Christmas presents as flags this year,

32
0:01:41.412,000 --> 0:01:47,000
including the blue gift bag that's dressed up as the flag of Scotland.

33
0:01:48.192,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I put this picture online, and sure enough,

34
0:01:50.501,000 --> 0:01:52,000
within the first few minutes, someone left a comment that said,

35
0:01:53.49,000 --> 0:01:56,000
"You can take that Scottish Saltire and shove it up your ass."

36
0:01:56.969,000 --> 0:01:57,000
(Laughter)

37
0:01:58.721,000 --> 0:02:,000
See, people are passionate about flags, you know?

38
0:02:01.043,000 --> 0:02:02,000
That's the way it is.

39
0:02:02.361,000 --> 0:02:03,000
What I love about flags

40
0:02:03.924,000 --> 0:02:05,000
is that once you understand the design of flags,

41
0:02:06.219,000 --> 0:02:08,000
what makes a good flag, what makes a bad flag,

42
0:02:08.813,000 --> 0:02:1,000
you can understand the design of almost anything.

43
0:02:11.396,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So what I'm going to do here is,

44
0:02:13.207,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I cracked open an episode of my radio show,

45
0:02:16.767,000 --> 0:02:19,000
"99% Invisible," and I'm going to reconstruct it here on stage,

46
0:02:19.861,000 --> 0:02:21,000
so when I press a button over here --

47
0:02:22.151,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Voice: S for Sound --

48
0:02:24.05,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Roman Mars: It's going to make a sound,

49
0:02:25.975,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and so whenever you hear a sound or a voice or a piece of music,

50
0:02:29.064,000 --> 0:02:3,000
it's because I pressed a button.

51
0:02:30.775,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Voice: Sound.

52
0:02:32.879,000 --> 0:02:35,000
RM: All right, got it? Here we go.

53
0:02:36.719,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Three, two.

54
0:02:39.825,000 --> 0:02:42,000
This is 99% Invisible. I'm Roman Mars.

55
0:02:46.944,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Music)

56
0:02:48.969,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Narrator: The five basic principles of flag design.

57
0:02:51.599,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Roman Mars: According to the North American Vexillological Association.

58
0:02:55.129,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Vexillological.

59
0:02:56.959,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Ted Kaye: Vexillology is the study of flags.

60
0:03:00.029,000 --> 0:03:02,000
RM: It's that extra "lol" that makes it sound weird.

61
0:03:02.485,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Narrator: Number one, keep it simple.

62
0:03:04.403,000 --> 0:03:07,000
The flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory.

63
0:03:07.712,000 --> 0:03:08,000
RM: Before I moved to Chicago in 2005,

64
0:03:09.687,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I didn't even know cities had their own flags.

65
0:03:12.211,000 --> 0:03:13,000
TK: Most larger cities do have flags.

66
0:03:14.112,000 --> 0:03:16,000
RM: Well, I didn't know that, that's Ted Kaye, by the way.

67
0:03:16.865,000 --> 0:03:17,000
TK: Hello.

68
0:03:18.064,000 --> 0:03:2,000
RM: He's a flag expert, he's a totally awesome guy.

69
0:03:20.498,000 --> 0:03:23,000
TK: I'm Ted Kaye, I have edited a scholarly journal on flag studies,

70
0:03:23.737,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and I am currently involved with the Portland Flag Association

71
0:03:26.735,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and the North American Vexillological Association.

72
0:03:30.122,000 --> 0:03:32,000
RM: Ted literally wrote the book on flag design.

73
0:03:33.123,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Narrator: "Good Flag, Bad Flag."

74
0:03:34.675,000 --> 0:03:36,000
RM: It's more of a pamphlet, really, it's about 16 pages.

75
0:03:37.395,000 --> 0:03:4,000
TK: Yes, it's called "Good Flag, Bad Flag: How to Design a Great Flag."

76
0:03:41.328,000 --> 0:03:43,000
RM: And that first city flag I discovered in Chicago

77
0:03:44.047,000 --> 0:03:45,000
is a beaut:

78
0:03:45.318,000 --> 0:03:48,000
white field, two horizontal blue stripes,

79
0:03:48.867,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and four six-pointed red stars down the middle.

80
0:03:51.752,000 --> 0:03:52,000
(Sound)

81
0:03:53.314,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Narrator: Number two, use meaningful symbolism.

82
0:03:55.599,000 --> 0:03:58,000
TK: The blue stripes represent the water, the river and the lake.

83
0:03:58.675,000 --> 0:04:,000
Narrator: The flag's images, colors or pattern

84
0:04:00.903,000 --> 0:04:01,000
should relate to what it symbolizes.

85
0:04:02.65,000 --> 0:04:05,000
TK: The red stars represent significant events in Chicago's history.

86
0:04:06.459,000 --> 0:04:09,000
RM: Namely, the founding of Fort Dearborn on the future site of Chicago,

87
0:04:10.187,000 --> 0:04:12,000
the Great Chicago Fire,

88
0:04:13.046,000 --> 0:04:15,000
the World Columbian Exposition, which everyone remembers

89
0:04:15.717,000 --> 0:04:16,000
because of the White City,

90
0:04:17.535,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and the Century of Progress Exposition, which no one remembers at all.

91
0:04:22.433,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Narrator: Number three, use two to three basic colors.

92
0:04:24.986,000 --> 0:04:27,000
TK: The basic rule for colors is to use two to three colors

93
0:04:28.478,000 --> 0:04:32,000
from the standard color set: red, white, blue, green, yellow and black.

94
0:04:33.926,000 --> 0:04:35,000
RM: The design of the Chicago flag has complete buy-in

95
0:04:36.492,000 --> 0:04:37,000
with an entire cross-section of the city.

96
0:04:38.483,000 --> 0:04:39,000
It is everywhere;

97
0:04:39.675,000 --> 0:04:41,000
every municipal building flies the flag.

98
0:04:42.263,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Whet Moser: There's probably at least one store on every block

99
0:04:45.22,000 --> 0:04:48,000
near where I work that sells some sort of Chicago flag paraphernalia.

100
0:04:48.487,000 --> 0:04:5,000
RM: That's Whet Moser from Chicago magazine.

101
0:04:50.918,000 --> 0:04:52,000
WM: Today, just for example, I went to get a haircut,

102
0:04:53.935,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and when I sat down in the barber's chair,

103
0:04:56.333,000 --> 0:05:,000
there was a Chicago flag on the box that the barber kept all his tools in,

104
0:05:00.804,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and then in the mirror, there was a Chicago flag on the wall behind me.

105
0:05:04.287,000 --> 0:05:08,000
When I left, a guy passed me who had a Chicago flag badge on his backpack.

106
0:05:09.279,000 --> 0:05:11,000
RM: It's adaptable and remixable.

107
0:05:11.366,000 --> 0:05:14,000
The six-pointed stars in particular show up in all kinds of places.

108
0:05:14.955,000 --> 0:05:17,000
WM: The coffee I bought the other day had a Chicago star on it.

109
0:05:18.66,000 --> 0:05:2,000
RM: It's a distinct symbol of Chicago pride.

110
0:05:21.655,000 --> 0:05:24,000
TK: When a police officer or a firefighter dies in Chicago,

111
0:05:25.376,000 --> 0:05:28,000
often it's not the flag of the United States on his casket.

112
0:05:28.99,000 --> 0:05:3,000
It can be the flag of the city of Chicago.

113
0:05:31.912,000 --> 0:05:36,000
That's how deeply the flag has gotten into the civic imagery of Chicago.

114
0:05:37.566,000 --> 0:05:4,000
RM: And it isn't just that people love Chicago and therefore love the flag.

115
0:05:41.275,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I also think that people love Chicago more because the flag is so cool.

116
0:05:47.154,000 --> 0:05:51,000
TK: A positive feedback loop there between great symbolism and civic pride.

117
0:05:52.278,000 --> 0:05:55,000
RM: OK, so when I moved back to San Francisco in 2008,

118
0:05:55.532,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I researched its flag,

119
0:05:56.925,000 --> 0:06:01,000
because I had never seen it in the previous eight years I lived there.

120
0:06:02.027,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And I found it, I am sorry to say,

121
0:06:04.935,000 --> 0:06:05,000
sadly lacking.

122
0:06:07.211,000 --> 0:06:1,000
(Laughter)

123
0:06:10.345,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I know.

124
0:06:12.528,000 --> 0:06:13,000
It hurts me, too.

125
0:06:13.796,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Laughter)

126
0:06:16.643,000 --> 0:06:17,000
TK: Well, let me start from the top.

127
0:06:18.41,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Narrator: Number one, keep it simple.

128
0:06:20.22,000 --> 0:06:21,000
TK: Keeping it simple.

129
0:06:21.42,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Narrator: The flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory.

130
0:06:25.018,000 --> 0:06:26,000
TK: It's a relatively complex flag.

131
0:06:26.911,000 --> 0:06:27,000
RM: OK, here we go, OK.

132
0:06:28.203,000 --> 0:06:3,000
The main component of the San Francisco flag is a phoenix

133
0:06:30.912,000 --> 0:06:32,000
representing the city rising from the ashes

134
0:06:33.145,000 --> 0:06:36,000
after the devastating fires of the 1850s.

135
0:06:36.211,000 --> 0:06:38,000
TK: A powerful symbol for San Francisco.

136
0:06:38.995,000 --> 0:06:39,000
RM: I still don't really dig the phoenix.

137
0:06:40.994,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Design-wise, it manages to both be too crude

138
0:06:43.664,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and have too many details at the same time,

139
0:06:46.5,000 --> 0:06:47,000
which if you were trying for that,

140
0:06:48.215,000 --> 0:06:49,000
you wouldn't be able to do it,

141
0:06:50.156,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and it just looks bad at a distance,

142
0:06:51.93,000 --> 0:06:54,000
but having deep meaning puts that element in the plus column.

143
0:06:55.622,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Behind the phoenix, the background is mostly white,

144
0:06:58.846,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and then it has a substantial gold border around it.

145
0:07:02.175,000 --> 0:07:04,000
TK: Which is a very attractive design element.

146
0:07:05.295,000 --> 0:07:06,000
RM: I think it's OK, but --

147
0:07:06.617,000 --> 0:07:07,000
(Laughter)

148
0:07:08.2,000 --> 0:07:1,000
here come the big no-nos of flag design.

149
0:07:11.22,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Narrator: Number four, no lettering or seals.

150
0:07:13.641,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Never use writing of any kind.

151
0:07:15.901,000 --> 0:07:17,000
RM: Underneath the phoenix, there's a motto on a ribbon

152
0:07:18.523,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that translates to "Gold in peace, iron in war,"

153
0:07:21.502,000 --> 0:07:23,000
plus -- and this is the big problem --

154
0:07:23.857,000 --> 0:07:26,000
it says San Francisco across the bottom.

155
0:07:27.09,000 --> 0:07:3,000
TK: If you need to write the name of what you're representing on your flag,

156
0:07:30.949,000 --> 0:07:31,000
your symbolism has failed.

157
0:07:32.749,000 --> 0:07:33,000
(Laughter)

158
0:07:34.549,000 --> 0:07:36,000
(Applause)

159
0:07:36.577,000 --> 0:07:39,000
RM: The United States flag doesn't say "USA" across the front.

160
0:07:40.542,000 --> 0:07:43,000
In fact, country flags, they tend to behave.

161
0:07:43.723,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Like, hats off to South Africa and Turkey and Israel

162
0:07:47.034,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and Somalia and Japan and Gambia.

163
0:07:49.186,000 --> 0:07:51,000
There's a bunch of really great country flags,

164
0:07:51.728,000 --> 0:07:55,000
but they obey good design principles because the stakes are high.

165
0:07:55.983,000 --> 0:07:57,000
They're on the international stage.

166
0:07:58.404,000 --> 0:08:01,000
But city, state and regional flags are another story.

167
0:08:03.058,000 --> 0:08:04,000
(Laughter)

168
0:08:04.975,000 --> 0:08:06,000
There is a scourge of bad flags --

169
0:08:07.731,000 --> 0:08:08,000
(Laughter)

170
0:08:08.8,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and they must be stopped.

171
0:08:10.332,000 --> 0:08:11,000
(Laughter)

172
0:08:11.515,000 --> 0:08:12,000
(Applause)

173
0:08:12.761,000 --> 0:08:15,000
That is the truth and that is the dare.

174
0:08:16.385,000 --> 0:08:19,000
The first step is to recognize that we have a problem.

175
0:08:20.268,000 --> 0:08:22,000
(Laughter)

176
0:08:24.586,000 --> 0:08:26,000
A lot of people tend to think that good design

177
0:08:27.333,000 --> 0:08:28,000
is just a matter of taste,

178
0:08:28.694,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and quite honestly, sometimes it is, actually,

179
0:08:31.74,000 --> 0:08:33,000
but sometimes it isn't, all right?

180
0:08:34.145,000 --> 0:08:35,000
(Laughter)

181
0:08:35.747,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Here's the full list of NAVA flag design principles.

182
0:08:40.328,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Narrator: The five basic principles of flag design.

183
0:08:43.006,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Narrator: Number one. TK: Keep it simple.

184
0:08:45.626,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Narrator: Number two. TK: Use meaningful symbolism.

185
0:08:48.078,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Narrator: Number three. TK: Use two to three basic colors.

186
0:08:50.849,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Narrator: Number four. TK: No lettering or seals.

187
0:08:53.169,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Narrator: Never use writing of any kind.

188
0:08:55.125,000 --> 0:08:57,000
TK: Because you can't read that at a distance.

189
0:08:57.341,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Narrator: Number five. TK: And be distinctive.

190
0:08:59.528,000 --> 0:09:01,000
RM: All the best flags tend to stick to these principles.

191
0:09:02.226,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And like I said before, most country flags are OK.

192
0:09:04.6,000 --> 0:09:05,000
But here's the thing:

193
0:09:05.786,000 --> 0:09:08,000
if you showed this list of principles to any designer of almost anything,

194
0:09:09.302,000 --> 0:09:11,000
they would say these principles -- simplicity, deep meaning,

195
0:09:12.153,000 --> 0:09:14,000
having few colors or being thoughtful about colors,

196
0:09:14.907,000 --> 0:09:16,000
uniqueness, don't have writing you can't read --

197
0:09:17.183,000 --> 0:09:19,000
all those principles apply to them, too.

198
0:09:19.781,000 --> 0:09:24,000
But sadly, good design principles are rarely invoked in US city flags.

199
0:09:24.876,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Our biggest problem seems to be that fourth one.

200
0:09:27.387,000 --> 0:09:31,000
We just can't stop ourselves from putting our names on our flags,

201
0:09:31.52,000 --> 0:09:34,000
or little municipal seals with tiny writing on them.

202
0:09:35.415,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Here's the thing about municipal seals:

203
0:09:37.343,000 --> 0:09:39,000
They were designed to be on pieces of paper

204
0:09:40.128,000 --> 0:09:41,000
where you can read them,

205
0:09:41.356,000 --> 0:09:44,000
not on flags 100 feet away flapping in the breeze.

206
0:09:44.533,000 --> 0:09:45,000
So here's a bunch of flags again.

207
0:09:46.428,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Vexillologists call these SOBs:

208
0:09:49.64,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Seals on a bedsheet --

209
0:09:51.082,000 --> 0:09:52,000
(Laughter)

210
0:09:52.278,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and if you can't tell what city they go to,

211
0:09:55.18,000 --> 0:09:56,000
yeah, that's exactly the problem,

212
0:09:57.071,000 --> 0:09:59,000
except for Anaheim, apparently, they fixed it.

213
0:10:00.043,000 --> 0:10:02,000
(Laughter)

214
0:10:03.208,000 --> 0:10:05,000
These flags are everywhere in the US.

215
0:10:05.565,000 --> 0:10:07,000
The European equivalent of the municipal seal

216
0:10:07.758,000 --> 0:10:08,000
is the city coat of arms ...

217
0:10:10.368,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and this is where we can learn a lesson for how to do things right.

218
0:10:13.573,000 --> 0:10:15,000
So this is the city coat of arms of Amsterdam.

219
0:10:15.774,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Now, if this were a United States city,

220
0:10:17.814,000 --> 0:10:19,000
the flag would probably look like this.

221
0:10:20.062,000 --> 0:10:21,000
You know, yeah.

222
0:10:21.264,000 --> 0:10:22,000
(Laughter)

223
0:10:22.521,000 --> 0:10:24,000
But instead, the flag of Amsterdam

224
0:10:24.595,000 --> 0:10:25,000
looks like this.

225
0:10:27.546,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Rather than plopping the whole coat of arms

226
0:10:29.989,000 --> 0:10:32,000
on a solid background and writing "Amsterdam" below it,

227
0:10:33.184,000 --> 0:10:35,000
they just take the key elements of the escutcheon, the shield,

228
0:10:36.117,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and they turn it into the most badass city flag in the world.

229
0:10:39.688,000 --> 0:10:4,000
(Laughter)

230
0:10:41.442,000 --> 0:10:45,000
(Applause)

231
0:10:45.794,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And because it's so badass,

232
0:10:48.03,000 --> 0:10:5,000
those flags and crosses are found throughout Amsterdam,

233
0:10:50.763,000 --> 0:10:52,000
just like Chicago, they're used.

234
0:10:53.955,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Even though seal-on-a-bedsheet flags are particularly painful

235
0:10:56.892,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and offensive to me,

236
0:10:58.161,000 --> 0:11:,000
nothing can quite prepare you

237
0:11:00.764,000 --> 0:11:03,000
for one of the biggest train wrecks in vexillological history.

238
0:11:03.869,000 --> 0:11:04,000
(Laughter)

239
0:11:05.137,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Are you ready?

240
0:11:06.815,000 --> 0:11:08,000
It's the flag of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

241
0:11:09.594,000 --> 0:11:16,000
(Laughter)

242
0:11:17.465,000 --> 0:11:2,000
I mean, it's distinctive,

243
0:11:21.459,000 --> 0:11:22,000
I'll give them that.

244
0:11:24.114,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Steve Kodis: It was adopted in 1955.

245
0:11:26.791,000 --> 0:11:27,000
RM: The city ran a contest

246
0:11:28.094,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and gathered a bunch of submissions with all kinds of designs.

247
0:11:31.513,000 --> 0:11:35,000
SK: And an alderman by the name of Fred Steffan

248
0:11:35.744,000 --> 0:11:41,000
cobbled together parts of the submissions to make what is now the Milwaukee flag.

249
0:11:42.98,000 --> 0:11:44,000
RM: It's a kitchen sink flag.

250
0:11:45.069,000 --> 0:11:47,000
There's a gigantic gear representing industry,

251
0:11:47.905,000 --> 0:11:49,000
there's a ship recognizing the port,

252
0:11:50.18,000 --> 0:11:51,000
a giant stalk of wheat

253
0:11:51.713,000 --> 0:11:53,000
paying homage to the brewing industry.

254
0:11:53.803,000 --> 0:11:54,000
It's a hot mess,

255
0:11:55.517,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and Steve Kodis, a graphic designer from Milwaukee, wants to change it.

256
0:12:00.368,000 --> 0:12:01,000
SK: It's really awful.

257
0:12:01.964,000 --> 0:12:04,000
It's a misstep on the city's behalf,

258
0:12:05.411,000 --> 0:12:06,000
to say the least.

259
0:12:07.617,000 --> 0:12:09,000
RM: But what puts the Milwaukee flag over the top,

260
0:12:10.059,000 --> 0:12:12,000
almost to the point of self-parody,

261
0:12:12.163,000 --> 0:12:17,000
is on it is a picture of the Civil War battle flag of the Milwaukee regiment.

262
0:12:18.109,000 --> 0:12:2,000
SK: So that's the final element in it

263
0:12:20.439,000 --> 0:12:22,000
that just makes it that much more ridiculous,

264
0:12:22.85,000 --> 0:12:26,000
that there is a flag design within the Milwaukee flag.

265
0:12:27.549,000 --> 0:12:29,000
RM: On the flag. Yeah. Yeah.

266
0:12:29.642,000 --> 0:12:3,000
(Laughter)

267
0:12:30.831,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Yeah.

268
0:12:32.161,000 --> 0:12:33,000
(Music)

269
0:12:33.893,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Now, Milwaukee is a fantastic city.

270
0:12:36.308,000 --> 0:12:38,000
I've been there, I love it.

271
0:12:38.583,000 --> 0:12:4,000
The most depressing part of this flag, though,

272
0:12:40.883,000 --> 0:12:43,000
is that there have been two major redesign contests.

273
0:12:44.004,000 --> 0:12:46,000
The last one was held in 2001.

274
0:12:46.199,000 --> 0:12:48,000
105 entries were received.

275
0:12:48.773,000 --> 0:12:5,000
TK: But in the end, the members of the Milwaukee Arts Board

276
0:12:51.565,000 --> 0:12:54,000
decided that none of the new entries were worthy of flying over the city.

277
0:12:55.118,000 --> 0:12:57,000
RM: They couldn't agree to change that thing!

278
0:12:57.522,000 --> 0:12:58,000
(Laughter)

279
0:12:58.775,000 --> 0:13:,000
That's discouraging enough to make you think

280
0:13:00.861,000 --> 0:13:03,000
that good design and democracy just simply do not go together.

281
0:13:04.284,000 --> 0:13:05,000
(Laughter)

282
0:13:05.462,000 --> 0:13:07,000
But Steve Kotas is going to try one more time

283
0:13:08.315,000 --> 0:13:1,000
to redesign the Milwaukee flag.

284
0:13:11.188,000 --> 0:13:12,000
SK: I believe Milwaukee is a great city.

285
0:13:13.173,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Every great city deserves a great flag.

286
0:13:16.325,000 --> 0:13:18,000
RM: Steve isn't ready to reveal his design yet.

287
0:13:18.575,000 --> 0:13:2,000
One of the things about proposing one of these things

288
0:13:21.121,000 --> 0:13:22,000
is you have to get people on board,

289
0:13:22.817,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and then you reveal your design.

290
0:13:24.407,000 --> 0:13:25,000
But here's the trick:

291
0:13:25.721,000 --> 0:13:26,000
If you want to design a great flag,

292
0:13:27.433,000 --> 0:13:3,000
a kick-ass flag like Chicago's or DC's, which also has a great flag,

293
0:13:31.298,000 --> 0:13:33,000
start by drawing a one-by-one-and-a-half-inch rectangle

294
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
on a piece of paper.

295
0:13:35.528,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Your design has to fit within that tiny rectangle.

296
0:13:38.05,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Here's why.

297
0:13:39.288,000 --> 0:13:44,000
TK: A three-by-five-foot flag on a pole 100 feet away

298
0:13:44.35,000 --> 0:13:5,000
looks about the same size as a one-by-one-and-a-half-inch rectangle

299
0:13:50.995,000 --> 0:13:52,000
seen about 15 inches from your eye.

300
0:13:53.598,000 --> 0:13:57,000
You'd be surprised by how compelling and simple the design can be

301
0:13:57.759,000 --> 0:13:59,000
when you hold yourself to that limitation.

302
0:14:01.102,000 --> 0:14:03,000
RM: Meanwhile, back in San Francisco.

303
0:14:03.886,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Is there anything we can do?

304
0:14:06.697,000 --> 0:14:09,000
TK: I like to say that in every bad flag there's a good flag trying to get out.

305
0:14:10.671,000 --> 0:14:12,000
The way to make San Francisco's flag a good flag

306
0:14:13.143,000 --> 0:14:16,000
is to take the motto off because you can't read that at a distance.

307
0:14:16.698,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Take the name off,

308
0:14:18.226,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and the border might even be made thicker, so it's more a part of the flag.

309
0:14:22.483,000 --> 0:14:23,000
And I would simply take the phoenix

310
0:14:24.36,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and make it a great big element in the middle of the flag.

311
0:14:27.761,000 --> 0:14:29,000
RM: But the current phoenix, that's got to go.

312
0:14:30.606,000 --> 0:14:33,000
TK: I would simplify or stylize the phoenix.

313
0:14:34.036,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Depict a big, wide-winged bird

314
0:14:36.295,000 --> 0:14:37,000
coming out of flames.

315
0:14:37.952,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Emphasize those flames.

316
0:14:39.779,000 --> 0:14:41,000
RM: So this San Francisco flag was designed by Frank Chimero

317
0:14:42.646,000 --> 0:14:43,000
based on Ted Kaye's suggestions.

318
0:14:44.208,000 --> 0:14:46,000
I don't know what he would do if we was completely unfettered

319
0:14:47.091,000 --> 0:14:48,000
and didn't follow those guidelines.

320
0:14:48.799,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Fans of my radio show and podcast, heard me complain about bad flags.

321
0:14:52.089,000 --> 0:14:53,000
They've sent me other suggested designs.

322
0:14:54.036,000 --> 0:14:55,000
This one's by Neil Mussett.

323
0:14:55.819,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Both are so much better.

324
0:14:58.887,000 --> 0:14:59,000
(Laughter)

325
0:15:00.339,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And I think if they were adopted,

326
0:15:02.292,000 --> 0:15:04,000
I would see them around the city.

327
0:15:05.135,000 --> 0:15:08,000
In my crusade to make flags of the world more beautiful,

328
0:15:08.353,000 --> 0:15:1,000
many listeners have taken it upon themselves

329
0:15:10.473,000 --> 0:15:12,000
to redesign their flags and look into the feasibility

330
0:15:12.983,000 --> 0:15:14,000
of getting them officially adopted.

331
0:15:15.039,000 --> 0:15:16,000
(Music)

332
0:15:16.316,000 --> 0:15:18,000
If you see your city flag and like it,

333
0:15:18.971,000 --> 0:15:19,000
fly it,

334
0:15:20.213,000 --> 0:15:22,000
even if it violates a design rule or two.

335
0:15:22.287,000 --> 0:15:23,000
I don't care.

336
0:15:23.682,000 --> 0:15:25,000
But if you don't see your city flag,

337
0:15:25.866,000 --> 0:15:28,000
maybe it doesn't exist, but maybe it does,

338
0:15:29.06,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and it just sucks,

339
0:15:30.4,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and I dare you to join the effort to try to change that.

340
0:15:35.867,000 --> 0:15:37,000
As we move more and more into cities,

341
0:15:38.483,000 --> 0:15:42,000
the city flag will become not just a symbol of that city as a place,

342
0:15:43.402,000 --> 0:15:49,000
but also, it could become a symbol of how that city considers design itself,

343
0:15:49.709,000 --> 0:15:52,000
especially today, as the populace is becoming more design-aware.

344
0:15:52.958,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And I think design awareness is at an all-time high.

345
0:15:55.99,000 --> 0:15:59,000
A well-designed flag could be seen as an indicator of how a city

346
0:16:00.045,000 --> 0:16:02,000
considers all of its design systems:

347
0:16:02.674,000 --> 0:16:03,000
its public transit,

348
0:16:04.306,000 --> 0:16:05,000
its parks, its signage.

349
0:16:06.303,000 --> 0:16:08,000
It might seem frivolous, but it's not.

350
0:16:09.857,000 --> 0:16:1,000
TK: Often when city leaders say,

351
0:16:11.717,000 --> 0:16:15,000
"We have more important things to do than worry about a city flag,"

352
0:16:16.217,000 --> 0:16:17,000
my response is,

353
0:16:17.84,000 --> 0:16:18,000
"If you had a great city flag,

354
0:16:19.444,000 --> 0:16:21,000
you would have a banner for people to rally under

355
0:16:22.184,000 --> 0:16:24,000
to face those more important things."

356
0:16:25.781,000 --> 0:16:26,000
(Music)

357
0:16:26.955,000 --> 0:16:28,000
RM: I've seen firsthand what a good city flag can do

358
0:16:29.411,000 --> 0:16:3,000
in the case of Chicago.

359
0:16:30.724,000 --> 0:16:32,000
The marriage of good design and civic pride

360
0:16:33.335,000 --> 0:16:35,000
is something that we need in all places.

361
0:16:35.851,000 --> 0:16:38,000
The best part about municipal flags is that we own them.

362
0:16:39.727,000 --> 0:16:4,000
They are an open-source,

363
0:16:41.302,000 --> 0:16:44,000
publicly owned design language of the community.

364
0:16:44.991,000 --> 0:16:45,000
When they are done well,

365
0:16:46.408,000 --> 0:16:5,000
they are remixable, adaptable, and they are powerful.

366
0:16:50.677,000 --> 0:16:52,000
We could control the branding and graphical imagery

367
0:16:53.116,000 --> 0:16:54,000
of our cities with a good flag,

368
0:16:54.74,000 --> 0:16:56,000
but instead, by having bad flags we don't use,

369
0:16:57.439,000 --> 0:16:59,000
we cede that territory to sports teams

370
0:17:00.409,000 --> 0:17:02,000
and chambers of commerce and tourism boards.

371
0:17:02.836,000 --> 0:17:04,000
Sports teams can leave and break our hearts.

372
0:17:05.357,000 --> 0:17:08,000
And besides, some of us don't really care about sports.

373
0:17:08.465,000 --> 0:17:1,000
And tourism campaigns can just be cheesy.

374
0:17:11.725,000 --> 0:17:12,000
But a great city flag

375
0:17:13.272,000 --> 0:17:15,000
is something that represents a city to its people

376
0:17:15.686,000 --> 0:17:17,000
and its people to the world at large.

377
0:17:17.869,000 --> 0:17:19,000
And when that flag is a beautiful thing,

378
0:17:20.328,000 --> 0:17:22,000
that connection is a beautiful thing.

379
0:17:23.219,000 --> 0:17:26,000
So maybe all the city flags can be as inspiring as Hong Kong

380
0:17:26.721,000 --> 0:17:28,000
or Portland or Trondheim,

381
0:17:28.897,000 --> 0:17:29,000
and we can do away with all the bad flags

382
0:17:30.904,000 --> 0:17:33,000
like San Francisco, Milwaukee, Cedar Rapids,

383
0:17:34.827,000 --> 0:17:36,000
and finally, when we're all done,

384
0:17:37.49,000 --> 0:17:39,000
we can do something about Pocatello, Idaho,

385
0:17:40.329,000 --> 0:17:43,000
considered by the North American Vexillological Association

386
0:17:44.05,000 --> 0:17:47,000
as the worst city flag in North America.

387
0:17:48.179,000 --> 0:17:49,000
[Proud to be Pocatello]

388
0:17:49.37,000 --> 0:17:51,000
(Laughter)

389
0:17:51.95,000 --> 0:17:54,000
(Applause)

390
0:17:55.896,000 --> 0:17:56,000
Yeah.

391
0:17:57.071,000 --> 0:17:58,000
(Applause)

392
0:17:58.372,000 --> 0:18:,000
That thing has a trademark symbol on it, people.

393
0:18:00.901,000 --> 0:18:02,000
(Laughter)

394
0:18:02.94,000 --> 0:18:03,000
That hurts me just to look at.

395
0:18:04.652,000 --> 0:18:05,000
(Laughter)

396
0:18:05.915,000 --> 0:18:06,000
Thank you so much for listening.

397
0:18:07.86,000 --> 0:18:13,000
(Applause)

398
0:18:13.966,000 --> 0:18:16,000

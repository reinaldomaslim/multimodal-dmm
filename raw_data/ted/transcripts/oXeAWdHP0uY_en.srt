1
0:00:12.5,000 --> 0:00:15,000
[This talk contains graphic language and descriptions of sexual abuse]

2
0:00:16.792,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Can I get a show of hands who here has ever Googled themselves?

3
0:00:23.833,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I have.

4
0:00:26.833,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But what started off as momentary curiosity

5
0:00:31.375,000 --> 0:00:33,000
very quickly turned

6
0:00:34.333,000 --> 0:00:38,000
into an almost five-year horrific battle

7
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:4,000
that almost ruined my life.

8
0:00:42.75,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I Google Images reverse-searched myself:

9
0:00:46.167,000 --> 0:00:5,000
a function of Google that allows you to upload an image

10
0:00:50.375,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and it shows you where it is on the internet.

11
0:00:53.542,000 --> 0:00:57,000
This is me at 17 years old.

12
0:00:57.875,000 --> 0:01:,000
An innocent selfie I took before a party.

13
0:01:01.333,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Now, before I continue, I must point out

14
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:08,000
that what I'm about to talk about is very confronting and graphic.

15
0:01:09.708,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But there's no way out.

16
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:13,000
This is a very confronting issue.

17
0:01:15.333,000 --> 0:01:17,000
In a split second,

18
0:01:17.958,000 --> 0:01:21,000
my screen was flooded with that image

19
0:01:22.75,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and dozens more images of me

20
0:01:25.75,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that had been stolen from my social media,

21
0:01:28.875,000 --> 0:01:31,000
on links connected to porn sites.

22
0:01:34.375,000 --> 0:01:39,000
On these sites, nameless, faceless sexual predators

23
0:01:39.583,000 --> 0:01:43,000
had published highly explicit sexual commentary about me

24
0:01:44.292,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and what they'd like to do to me.

25
0:01:47.625,000 --> 0:01:5,000
"Cover her face and we'd fuck her body,"

26
0:01:50.667,000 --> 0:01:51,000
one person wrote.

27
0:01:52.958,000 --> 0:01:56,000
They also published identifying information about me:

28
0:01:57.417,000 --> 0:02:,000
where I lived, what I studied, who I was.

29
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:03,000
But things got worse.

30
0:02:04.708,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I soon discovered that these sexual predators

31
0:02:08.792,000 --> 0:02:13,000
had doctored or photoshopped my face

32
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:19,000
onto the bodies of naked adult actresses engaged in sexual intercourse,

33
0:02:20.208,000 --> 0:02:21,000
on solo shots

34
0:02:22.875,000 --> 0:02:25,000
of me being ejaculated on by two men.

35
0:02:27.042,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Sperm was edited onto my face.

36
0:02:31.792,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I was edited onto the cover of a porn DVD.

37
0:02:37.042,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Perpetrators had edited my images

38
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:44,000
to give the effect that my blouse was transparent or see-through,

39
0:02:44.917,000 --> 0:02:45,000
so you could see my nipples.

40
0:02:48.75,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Perpetrators ejaculated on images of me,

41
0:02:52.583,000 --> 0:02:58,000
took photos of their sperm and penises on these images

42
0:02:59.583,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and posted them onto porn sites.

43
0:03:02.792,000 --> 0:03:04,000
"Cum on printed pigs," is what they call it.

44
0:03:07.375,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Now, you might be wondering,

45
0:03:09.708,000 --> 0:03:12,000
what sorts of images I posted on social media.

46
0:03:13.708,000 --> 0:03:17,000
This is me, at around 19 at the Claremont Hotel,

47
0:03:18.083,000 --> 0:03:19,000
just a few suburbs away.

48
0:03:20.875,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And they superimposed that face into this.

49
0:03:26.958,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And things got worse.

50
0:03:28.917,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Nothing was off limits for these predators.

51
0:03:31.75,000 --> 0:03:35,000
They even posted an image with my little sister on these sites too.

52
0:03:37.458,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Now, you might be thinking,

53
0:03:39.125,000 --> 0:03:42,000
"Well, you do dress provocatively,

54
0:03:42.25,000 --> 0:03:45,000
even a little sexually suggestive,

55
0:03:45.792,000 --> 0:03:46,000
attention seeking maybe."

56
0:03:49.458,000 --> 0:03:51,000
But just because a woman's body gets attention,

57
0:03:52.208,000 --> 0:03:54,000
doesn't mean she's attention-seeking.

58
0:03:55.375,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And what is provocative anyway, what is sexually suggestive?

59
0:03:59.208,000 --> 0:04:02,000
In some parts of the world, showing your ankles

60
0:04:02.917,000 --> 0:04:04,000
is promiscuous, is provocative.

61
0:04:06.917,000 --> 0:04:09,000
It's just like, no matter what a woman wears,

62
0:04:10.542,000 --> 0:04:13,000
it's always perceived as more sexual than it is.

63
0:04:15.125,000 --> 0:04:18,000
For me, I just wanted to feel pretty and confident.

64
0:04:19.833,000 --> 0:04:2,000
What's so wrong with that?

65
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Now, you might be thinking,

66
0:04:25.708,000 --> 0:04:28,000
"Well, can't you just set your social media on private?"

67
0:04:31.625,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Well, these perpetrators were calculated.

68
0:04:34.875,000 --> 0:04:36,000
They befriended my friends on social media

69
0:04:37.875,000 --> 0:04:39,000
under fake profiles,

70
0:04:40.5,000 --> 0:04:42,000
they followed the public galleries

71
0:04:43.083,000 --> 0:04:46,000
of the events and places I regularly visited.

72
0:04:49.417,000 --> 0:04:5,000
But why?

73
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Why should one have to retreat and hide

74
0:04:54.667,000 --> 0:04:57,000
out of fear that something like this could happen?

75
0:04:59.583,000 --> 0:05:01,000
What I post and what I wear

76
0:05:02.375,000 --> 0:05:05,000
isn't an invitation to violate and abuse me.

77
0:05:06.125,000 --> 0:05:1,000
The only person that should be changing their behavior

78
0:05:10.208,000 --> 0:05:11,000
is the perpetrators.

79
0:05:12.375,000 --> 0:05:19,000
(Applause)

80
0:05:23.5,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Now, you might be thinking, why me?

81
0:05:27.042,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Well, I'm just one

82
0:05:30.5,000 --> 0:05:32,000
of the thousands upon thousands

83
0:05:33.375,000 --> 0:05:36,000
of ordinary women who are being preyed upon

84
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:44,000
in these mass-scale, horrific online cultures, websites and threads

85
0:05:44.708,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that are dedicated to sexually exploiting and doctoring

86
0:05:50.25,000 --> 0:05:52,000
ordinary images of women into porn.

87
0:05:54.083,000 --> 0:05:55,000
As I speak,

88
0:05:56.958,000 --> 0:05:59,000
there are women who are being preyed upon, and they don't even know it.

89
0:06:02.708,000 --> 0:06:05,000
In the beginning, I tried seeking help.

90
0:06:06.583,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I went to police, I contacted government agencies,

91
0:06:10.333,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I even tried to hire a private investigator,

92
0:06:14.208,000 --> 0:06:15,000
but they were too expensive.

93
0:06:17.167,000 --> 0:06:19,000
There was nothing that they could do.

94
0:06:19.458,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I mean, what could you do

95
0:06:21.208,000 --> 0:06:26,000
when the sites are hosted overseas and the perpetrators are from overseas?

96
0:06:28.875,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I was told I had to contact the sites one by one,

97
0:06:33.417,000 --> 0:06:36,000
notifying the webmasters to get everything deleted.

98
0:06:38.708,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And so as you can imagine,

99
0:06:41.125,000 --> 0:06:45,000
in complete and utter fear and pain,

100
0:06:46.833,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I did.

101
0:06:48.875,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I contacted the webmasters,

102
0:06:52.25,000 --> 0:06:56,000
requesting that they delete the material shared without consent.

103
0:06:57.167,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And I had some successes,

104
0:07:00.042,000 --> 0:07:02,000
but I also had some major setbacks.

105
0:07:04.292,000 --> 0:07:05,000
The more I fought,

106
0:07:07.333,000 --> 0:07:09,000
the more sites I would discover,

107
0:07:09.667,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and with time, the more my images were being seen and shared

108
0:07:13.958,000 --> 0:07:15,000
in the tens of thousands.

109
0:07:16.542,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I had one webmaster respond to me saying he'll only delete the site

110
0:07:23.833,000 --> 0:07:27,000
if I sent him nude photos of myself within 24 hours.

111
0:07:29.083,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And this went on for years,

112
0:07:30.708,000 --> 0:07:34,000
fighting against these dodgy, disgusting sites.

113
0:07:34.958,000 --> 0:07:36,000
But I was fighting a losing battle.

114
0:07:39.333,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And I couldn't continue this any longer for my own mental health.

115
0:07:44.375,000 --> 0:07:45,000
But what could I do?

116
0:07:47.875,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Maybe, I thought, if I spoke out,

117
0:07:53.333,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I could reclaim my name,

118
0:07:55.75,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and I could rewrite my narrative on my own terms.

119
0:07:59.333,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Maybe if I spoke out,

120
0:08:01.458,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I could raise awareness about this.

121
0:08:04.625,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Maybe I could even try to change the law.

122
0:08:09.5,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And so I did.

123
0:08:12.208,000 --> 0:08:18,000
(Applause)

124
0:08:21.625,000 --> 0:08:23,000
I spoke out publicly late last year

125
0:08:24.5,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and news of my story reverberated around the world.

126
0:08:29.542,000 --> 0:08:31,000
But this was the response.

127
0:08:31.917,000 --> 0:08:34,000
"She's a fat, ugly slut, she's a whore."

128
0:08:35.333,000 --> 0:08:38,000
"She's an attention-seeking piece of trash."

129
0:08:38.417,000 --> 0:08:4,000
"Feel flattered, baby, it's a compliment."

130
0:08:41.417,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I was victim-blamed and slut-shamed

131
0:08:44.625,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and told I was deserving of what happened to me.

132
0:08:48.625,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And quite frankly,

133
0:08:50.542,000 --> 0:08:52,000
that was more difficult for me to endure

134
0:08:53.417,000 --> 0:08:57,000
than my actual experiences of image-based abuse.

135
0:08:59.208,000 --> 0:09:01,000
But I couldn’t let this criticism defeat me.

136
0:09:02.125,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I knew what the perpetrators had done was wrong,

137
0:09:05.208,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and I knew what they were doing to others was wrong.

138
0:09:08.375,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And so I petitioned.

139
0:09:10.917,000 --> 0:09:14,000
I sent out impassioned pleas for support.

140
0:09:15.083,000 --> 0:09:16,000
But it didn't work.

141
0:09:16.875,000 --> 0:09:18,000
I think I got like 330 signatures.

142
0:09:20.542,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And that was really disheartening.

143
0:09:24.833,000 --> 0:09:27,000
But I then contacted my state and federal MPs.

144
0:09:29.542,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And I was referred to the New South Wales Attorney General's department,

145
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:38,000
who were already in the process of drafting new laws

146
0:09:38.292,000 --> 0:09:42,000
to criminalize the nonconsensual distribution of intimate images.

147
0:09:44.792,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Image-based sexual abuse.

148
0:09:47.667,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Some of you might know it as revenge porn.

149
0:09:52.417,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And soon I became a spokesperson,

150
0:09:54.958,000 --> 0:09:56,000
a public face for the new laws.

151
0:09:58.375,000 --> 0:09:59,000
But I must point out,

152
0:09:59.667,000 --> 0:10:01,000
I do not in any way, shape or form

153
0:10:01.75,000 --> 0:10:03,000
want to take credit for this change in the law.

154
0:10:04.667,000 --> 0:10:06,000
This is on the backs of cybersafety experts,

155
0:10:07.333,000 --> 0:10:1,000
of researchers, of the Attorney General's department,

156
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:13,000
of so many people who have fought for years.

157
0:10:15.042,000 --> 0:10:19,000
New South Wales was the first state in all the world

158
0:10:21.625,000 --> 0:10:24,000
to specifically include a provision on altering images.

159
0:10:25.375,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Something that happened to me,

160
0:10:26.875,000 --> 0:10:29,000
something you certainly don't hear about very often.

161
0:10:29.917,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And now ACT has also criminalized this,

162
0:10:34.083,000 --> 0:10:36,000
also with a provision on altered images.

163
0:10:36.75,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And next year, WA is introducing legislation

164
0:10:40.417,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and hopefully, they introduce a provision on altered images

165
0:10:44.708,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and I urge every state and every country in this world to follow suit,

166
0:10:48.458,000 --> 0:10:49,000
because right now,

167
0:10:49.75,000 --> 0:10:5,000
there's no justice for people like me.

168
0:10:53.5,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Despite it all,

169
0:10:55.5,000 --> 0:10:57,000
despite the hate and despite the criticism,

170
0:10:59.917,000 --> 0:11:01,000
despite the fact that I'm never going to get justice,

171
0:11:02.667,000 --> 0:11:05,000
because my experiences happened before this movement of law reform,

172
0:11:07.583,000 --> 0:11:1,000
speaking out was the best thing I've ever done,

173
0:11:10.625,000 --> 0:11:12,000
because I know for a fact that it has helped people.

174
0:11:17.292,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And I just want to live in a world

175
0:11:20.917,000 --> 0:11:22,000
where, regardless of what I wear or what I post,

176
0:11:23.792,000 --> 0:11:28,000
that I'm still worthy of being treated with dignity and respect.

177
0:11:31.125,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Respect.

178
0:11:33.167,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Now, that's an idea worth sharing.

179
0:11:36.042,000 --> 0:11:37,000
(Applause)

180
0:11:37.25,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Thank you.

181
0:11:38.542,000 --> 0:11:44,000
(Applause)

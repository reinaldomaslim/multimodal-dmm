1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Adrian Kohler: Well, we're here today

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
to talk about the evolution of a puppet horse.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Basil Jones: But actually we're going to start this evolution

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
with a hyena.

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
AK: The ancestor of the horse.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Okay, we'll do something with it.

7
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
(Laughter)

8
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Hahahaha.

9
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
The hyena is the ancestor of the horse

10
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
because it was part of a production

11
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
called "Faustus in Africa,"

12
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
a Handspring Production from 1995,

13
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
where it had to play draughts with Helen of Troy.

14
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
This production was directed

15
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
by South African artist and theater director,

16
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
William Kentridge.

17
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So it needed a very articulate front paw.

18
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
But, like all puppets, it has other attributes.

19
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
BJ: One of them is breath,

20
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and it kind of breathes.

21
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
AK: Haa haa haaa.

22
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
BJ: Breath is really important for us.

23
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
It's the kind of original movement

24
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
for any puppet for us onstage.

25
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It's the thing that distinguishes the puppet --

26
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
AK: Oops.

27
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
BJ: From an actor.

28
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Puppets always have to try to be alive.

29
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
It's their kind of ur-story onstage,

30
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that desperation to live.

31
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
AK: Yeah, it's basically a dead object, as you can see,

32
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and it only lives

33
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
because you make it.

34
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
An actor struggles to die onstage,

35
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
but a puppet has to struggle to live.

36
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And in a way that's a metaphor for life.

37
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
BJ: So every moment it's on the stage, it's making the struggle.

38
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So we call this

39
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
a piece of emotional engineering

40
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
that uses up-to-the-minute

41
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
17th century technology --

42
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
to turn nouns

44
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
into verbs.

45
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
AK: Well actually I prefer to say

46
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
that it's an object

47
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
constructed out of wood and cloth

48
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
with movement built into it

49
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
to persuade you to believe that it has life.

50
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
BJ: Okay so.

51
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
AK: It has ears that move passively

52
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
when the head goes.

53
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
BJ: And it has these bulkheads

54
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
made out of plywood,

55
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
covered with fabric --

56
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
curiously similar, in fact,

57
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
to the plywood canoes

58
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that Adrian's father used to make

59
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
when he was a boy in their workshop.

60
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
AK: In Port Elizabeth, the village outside Port Elizabeth in South Africa.

61
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
BJ: His mother was a puppeteer.

62
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And when we met at art school

63
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and fell in love

64
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
in 1971,

65
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I hated puppets.

66
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I really thought they were so beneath me.

67
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I wanted to become an avant-garde artist --

68
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and Punch and Judy was certainly not where I wanted to go.

69
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And, in fact, it took about 10 years

70
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
to discover

71
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
the Bambara Bamana puppets of Mali in West Africa,

72
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
where there's a fabulous tradition of puppetry,

73
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
to learn a renewed, or a new, respect

74
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
for this art form.

75
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
AK: So in 1981, I persuaded Basil and some friends of mine

76
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
to form a puppet company.

77
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And 20 years later, miraculously,

78
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
we collaborated with a company from Mali,

79
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
the Sogolon Marionette Troupe of Bamako,

80
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
where we made a piece about a tall giraffe.

81
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It was just called "Tall Horse," which was a life-sized giraffe.

82
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
BJ: And here again, you see the same structure.

83
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
The bulkheads have now turned into hoops of cane,

84
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
but it's ultimately the same structure.

85
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
It's got two people inside it on stilts,

86
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
which give them the height,

87
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and somebody in the front

88
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
who's using a kind of steering wheel to move that head.

89
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
AK: The person in the hind legs

90
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
is also controlling the tail, a bit like the hyena --

91
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
same mechanism, just a bit bigger.

92
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And he's controlling the ear movement.

93
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
BJ: So this production

94
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
was seen by Tom Morris

95
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
of the National Theatre in London.

96
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And just around that time,

97
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
his mother had said,

98
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
"Have you seen this book by Michael Morpurgo

99
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
called 'War Horse'?"

100
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
AK: It's about a boy who falls in love with a horse.

101
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
The horse is sold to the First World War,

102
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and he joins up to find his horse.

103
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
BJ: So Tom gave us a call and said,

104
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
"Do you think you could make us a horse

105
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
for a show to happen at the National Theatre?"

106
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
AK: It seemed a lovely idea.

107
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
BJ: But it had to ride. It had to have a rider.

108
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
AK: It had to have a rider,

109
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and it had to participate in cavalry charges.

110
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
(Laughter)

111
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
A play about early 20th century plowing technology

112
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and cavalry charges

113
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
was a little bit of a challenge for the accounting department

114
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
at the National Theatre in London.

115
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
But they agreed to go along with it for a while.

116
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So we began with a test.

117
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
BJ: This is Adrian and Thys Stander,

118
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
who went on to actually design the cane system for the horse,

119
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and our next-door neighbor Katherine,

120
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
riding on a ladder.

121
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
The weight is really difficult when it's up above your head.

122
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
AK: And once we put Katherine

123
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
through that particular brand of hell,

124
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
we knew that we might be able to make a horse, which could be ridden.

125
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So we made a model.

126
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
This is a cardboard model,

127
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
a little bit smaller than the hyena.

128
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
You'll notice that the legs are plywood legs

129
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and the canoe structure is still there.

130
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
BJ: And the two manipulators are inside.

131
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
But we didn't realize at the time

132
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that we actually needed a third manipulator,

133
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
because we couldn't manipulate the neck

134
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
from inside

135
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and walk the horse at the same time.

136
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
AK: We started work on the prototype

137
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
after the model was approved,

138
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and the prototype took a bit longer

139
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
than we anticipated.

140
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
We had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones.

141
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And we had a crate built for it.

142
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
It had to be shipped to London.

143
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
We were going to test-drive it on the street outside of our house in Cape Town,

144
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and it got to midnight and we hadn't done that yet.

145
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
BJ: So we got a camera,

146
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and we posed the puppet

147
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
in various galloping stances.

148
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And we sent it off

149
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
to the National Theatre,

150
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
hoping that they believed

151
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that we created something that worked.

152
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
(Laughter)

153
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
AK: A month later, we were there in London

154
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us.

155
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
BJ: About 40 people.

156
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
AK: We were terrified.

157
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
We opened the lid, we took the horse out,

158
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and it did work; it walked and it was able to be ridden.

159
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Here I have an 18-second clip

160
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
of the very first walk of the prototype.

161
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
This is in the National Theatre studio,

162
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
the place where they cook new ideas.

163
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
It had by no means got the green light yet.

164
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
The choreographer, Toby Sedgwick,

165
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
invented a beautiful sequence

166
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
where the baby horse,

167
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
which was made out of sticks and bits of twigs,

168
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
grew up into the big horse.

169
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And Nick Starr, the director of the National Theatre,

170
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
saw that particular moment, he was standing next to me -- he nearly wet himself.

171
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And so the show was given the green light.

172
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And we went back to Cape Town and redesigned the horse completely.

173
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Here is the plan.

174
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
(Laughter)

175
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And here is our factory in Cape Town

176
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
where we make horses.

177
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
You can see quite a lot of skeletons in the background there.

178
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
The horses are completely handmade.

179
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
There is very little 20th century technology in them.

180
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
We used a bit of laser cutting on the plywood

181
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and some of the aluminum pieces.

182
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
But because they have to be light and flexible,

183
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and each one of them is different,

184
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
they can't be mass-produced, unfortunately.

185
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So here are some half-finished horses

186
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
ready to be worked in London.

187
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And now we would like to introduce you

188
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
to Joey.

189
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Joey boy, you there?

190
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Joey.

191
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
(Applause)

192
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
(Applause)

193
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Joey.

194
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Joey, come here.

195
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
No, no, I haven't got it.

196
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
He's got it; it's in his pocket.

197
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
BJ: Joey.

198
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
AK: Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey.

199
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Come here. Stand here where people can see you.

200
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Move around. Come on.

201
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
I'd just like to describe --

202
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I won't talk too loud. He might get irritated.

203
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Here, Craig is working the head.

204
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
He has bicycle brake cables

205
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
going down to the head control in his hand.

206
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Each one of them

207
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
operates either an ear, separately,

208
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
or the head, up and down.

209
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
But he also controls the head directly

210
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
by using his hand.

211
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
The ears are obviously

212
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
a very important emotional indicator of the horse.

213
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
When they point right back,

214
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
the horse is fearful or angry,

215
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
depending upon what's going on in front of him, around him.

216
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Or, when he's more relaxed, the head comes down

217
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and the ears listen, either side.

218
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Horses' hearing is very important.

219
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
It's almost more important than their eyesight.

220
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Over here,

221
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Tommy's got what you call the heart position.

222
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
He's working the leg.

223
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
You see the string tendon from the hyena,

224
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
the hyena's front leg,

225
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
automatically pulls the hoop up.

226
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
(Laughter)

227
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Horses are so unpredictable.

228
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
(Laughter)

229
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
The way a hoof comes up with a horse

230
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
immediately gives you the feeling

231
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
that it's a convincing horse action.

232
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
The hind legs have got the same action.

233
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
BJ: And Mikey also has,

234
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
in his fingers,

235
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
the ability to move the tail

236
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
from left to right,

237
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and up and down with the other hand.

238
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And together, there's quite a complex possibility

239
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
of tail expression.

240
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
AK: You want to say something about the breathing?

241
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
BJ: We had a big challenge with breathing.

242
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Adrian thought

243
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
that he was going to have to split the chest of the puppet in two

244
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and make it breathe like that --

245
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
because that's how a horse would breathe, with an expanded chest.

246
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
But we realized

247
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
that, if that were to be happening,

248
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
you wouldn't, as an audience, see the breath.

249
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
So he made a channel in here,

250
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and the chest moves up and down in that channel.

251
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
So it's anti-naturalistic really, the up and down movement,

252
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
but it feels like breath.

253
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And it's very, very simple

254
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
because all that happens

255
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees.

256
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
AK: Other emotional stuff.

257
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
If I were to touch the horse here

258
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
on his skin,

259
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
the heart puppeteer can shake the body from inside

260
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and get the skin to quiver.

261
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
You'll notice, of course,

262
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
that the puppet is made out of cane lines.

263
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And I would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice,

264
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
that I was making a three-dimensional drawing of a horse

265
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
that somehow moves in space.

266
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
But of course, it was the cane is light,

267
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
the cane is flexible, the cane is durable

268
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and the cane is moldable.

269
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And so it was a very practical reason why it was made of cane.

270
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
The skin itself

271
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
is made out of a see-through nylon mesh,

272
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
which, if the lighting designer

273
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
wants the horse to almost disappear,

274
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
she can light the background

275
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and the horse becomes ghostlike.

276
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
You see the skeletal structure of it.

277
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Or if you light it from above, it becomes more solid.

278
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Again, that was a practical consideration.

279
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
The guys inside the horse have to be able to see out.

280
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
They have to be able to act

281
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
along with their fellow actors in the production.

282
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And it's very much an in-the-moment activity that they're engaged in.

283
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
It's three heads making one character.

284
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
But now we would like you to put Joey through some paces.

285
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
And plant.

286
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
(Whinny)

287
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Thank you.

288
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
And now just --

289
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
(Applause)

290
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
All the way from sunny California

291
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
we have Zem Joaquin

292
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
who's going to ride the horse for us.

293
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
(Applause)

294
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
(Applause)

295
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
(Music)

296
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
So we would like to stress

297
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
that the performance you see in the horse

298
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
is three guys

299
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
who have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly.

300
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
BJ: Not being able to talk to one another

301
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
while they're onstage

302
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
because they're mic'd.

303
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
The sound that that very large chest makes, of the horse --

304
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
the whinnying and the nickering and everything --

305
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
that starts usually with one performer,

306
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
carries on with a second person

307
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
and ends with a third.

308
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
AK: Mikey Brett from Leicestershire.

309
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
(Applause)

310
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
Mikey Brett, Craig, Leo,

311
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
Zem Joaquin and Basil and me.

312
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
(Applause)

313
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
Thank you. Thank you.

314
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
(Applause)

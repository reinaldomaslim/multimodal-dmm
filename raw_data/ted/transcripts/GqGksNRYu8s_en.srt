1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Let's talk about trust.

2
0:00:16.24,000 --> 0:00:19,000
We all know trust is fundamental,

3
0:00:19.76,000 --> 0:00:21,000
but when it comes to trusting people,

4
0:00:22.4,000 --> 0:00:24,000
something profound is happening.

5
0:00:25.8,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Please raise your hand

6
0:00:27.08,000 --> 0:00:31,000
if you have ever been a host or a guest on Airbnb.

7
0:00:32.4,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Wow. That's a lot of you.

8
0:00:35.64,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Who owns Bitcoin?

9
0:00:38.64,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Still a lot of you. OK.

10
0:00:39.92,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And please raise your hand if you've ever used Tinder

11
0:00:42.64,000 --> 0:00:43,000
to help you find a mate.

12
0:00:44.28,000 --> 0:00:45,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:46.12,000 --> 0:00:49,000
This one's really hard to count because you're kind of going like this.

14
0:00:49.52,000 --> 0:00:5,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:51.36,000 --> 0:00:53,000
These are all examples of how technology

16
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
is creating new mechanisms

17
0:00:56.28,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that are enabling us to trust unknown people, companies and ideas.

18
0:01:02.32,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And yet at the same time,

19
0:01:04.36,000 --> 0:01:05,000
trust in institutions --

20
0:01:05.92,000 --> 0:01:07,000
banks, governments and even churches --

21
0:01:08.88,000 --> 0:01:09,000
is collapsing.

22
0:01:10.28,000 --> 0:01:12,000
So what's happening here,

23
0:01:12.52,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and who do you trust?

24
0:01:14.8,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Let's start in France with a platform -- with a company, I should say --

25
0:01:18.72,000 --> 0:01:2,000
with a rather funny-sounding name,

26
0:01:20.88,000 --> 0:01:21,000
BlaBlaCar.

27
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
It's a platform that matches drivers and passengers

28
0:01:25.8,000 --> 0:01:29,000
who want to share long-distance journeys together.

29
0:01:29.84,000 --> 0:01:33,000
The average ride taken is 320 kilometers.

30
0:01:34.08,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So it's a good idea to choose your fellow travelers wisely.

31
0:01:39.32,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Social profiles and reviews help people make a choice.

32
0:01:43.32,000 --> 0:01:48,000
You can see if someone's a smoker, you can see what kind of music they like,

33
0:01:48.36,000 --> 0:01:51,000
you can see if they're going to bring their dog along for the ride.

34
0:01:52.44,000 --> 0:01:55,000
But it turns out that the key social identifier

35
0:01:56.04,000 --> 0:01:58,000
is how much you're going to talk in the car.

36
0:01:58.68,000 --> 0:01:59,000
(Laughter)

37
0:02:00.52,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Bla, not a lot,

38
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
bla bla, you want a nice bit of chitchat,

39
0:02:04.48,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and bla bla bla, you're not going to stop talking the entire way

40
0:02:08.24,000 --> 0:02:09,000
from London to Paris.

41
0:02:09.72,000 --> 0:02:11,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:12.04,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It's remarkable, right, that this idea works at all,

43
0:02:15.08,000 --> 0:02:18,000
because it's counter to the lesson most of us were taught as a child:

44
0:02:18.96,000 --> 0:02:2,000
never get in a car with a stranger.

45
0:02:21.68,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And yet, BlaBlaCar transports more than four million people

46
0:02:26.84,000 --> 0:02:27,000
every single month.

47
0:02:28.88,000 --> 0:02:3,000
To put that in context, that's more passengers

48
0:02:31.24,000 --> 0:02:34,000
than the Eurostar or JetBlue airlines carry.

49
0:02:35.36,000 --> 0:02:39,000
BlaBlaCar is a beautiful illustration of how technology is enabling

50
0:02:39.52,000 --> 0:02:42,000
millions of people across the world to take a trust leap.

51
0:02:43.56,000 --> 0:02:49,000
A trust leap happens when we take the risk to do something new or different

52
0:02:49.84,000 --> 0:02:51,000
to the way that we've always done it.

53
0:02:52.44,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Let's try to visualize this together.

54
0:02:55.36,000 --> 0:02:58,000
OK. I want you to close your eyes.

55
0:02:59.32,000 --> 0:03:02,000
There is a man staring at me with his eyes wide open.

56
0:03:02.4,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I'm on this big red circle. I can see.

57
0:03:04.88,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So close your eyes.

58
0:03:06.32,000 --> 0:03:08,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

59
0:03:09.2,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I'll do it with you.

60
0:03:10.48,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And I want you to imagine there exists a gap

61
0:03:13.52,000 --> 0:03:15,000
between you and something unknown.

62
0:03:16.76,000 --> 0:03:18,000
That unknown can be someone you've just met.

63
0:03:19.64,000 --> 0:03:21,000
It can be a place you've never been to.

64
0:03:21.76,000 --> 0:03:24,000
It can be something you've never tried before.

65
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
You got it?

66
0:03:26.4,000 --> 0:03:28,000
OK. You can open your eyes now.

67
0:03:28.52,000 --> 0:03:31,000
For you to leap from a place of certainty,

68
0:03:31.88,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to take a chance on that someone or something unknown,

69
0:03:35.48,000 --> 0:03:38,000
you need a force to pull you over the gap,

70
0:03:38.84,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and that remarkable force is trust.

71
0:03:42.56,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Trust is an elusive concept,

72
0:03:46.2,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and yet we depend on it for our lives to function.

73
0:03:49.6,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I trust my children

74
0:03:51.88,000 --> 0:03:53,000
when they say they're going to turn the lights out at night.

75
0:03:54.76,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I trusted the pilot who flew me here to keep me safe.

76
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:,000
It's a word we use a lot,

77
0:04:00.84,000 --> 0:04:02,000
without always thinking about what it really means

78
0:04:03.28,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and how it works in different contexts of our lives.

79
0:04:06.68,000 --> 0:04:09,000
There are, in fact, hundreds of definitions of trust,

80
0:04:10.32,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and most can be reduced to some kind of risk assessment

81
0:04:14.92,000 --> 0:04:16,000
of how likely it is that things will go right.

82
0:04:18.12,000 --> 0:04:2,000
But I don't like this definition of trust,

83
0:04:20.72,000 --> 0:04:24,000
because it makes trust sound rational and predictable,

84
0:04:25.04,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and it doesn't really get to the human essence

85
0:04:27.64,000 --> 0:04:28,000
of what it enables us to do

86
0:04:29.6,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and how it empowers us

87
0:04:31.6,000 --> 0:04:33,000
to connect with other people.

88
0:04:33.72,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So I define trust a little differently.

89
0:04:35.8,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I define trust as a confident relationship to the unknown.

90
0:04:41.92,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Now, when you view trust through this lens,

91
0:04:44.04,000 --> 0:04:47,000
it starts to explain why it has the unique capacity

92
0:04:47.72,000 --> 0:04:5,000
to enable us to cope with uncertainty,

93
0:04:50.84,000 --> 0:04:53,000
to place our faith in strangers,

94
0:04:53.88,000 --> 0:04:54,000
to keep moving forward.

95
0:04:56.4,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Human beings are remarkable

96
0:04:59.2,000 --> 0:05:,000
at taking trust leaps.

97
0:05:01.4,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Do you remember the first time you put your credit card details

98
0:05:04.4,000 --> 0:05:05,000
into a website?

99
0:05:05.64,000 --> 0:05:06,000
That's a trust leap.

100
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I distinctly remember telling my dad

101
0:05:09.96,000 --> 0:05:14,000
that I wanted to buy a navy blue secondhand Peugeot on eBay,

102
0:05:15.24,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and he rightfully pointed out

103
0:05:16.92,000 --> 0:05:18,000
that the seller's name was "Invisible Wizard"

104
0:05:19.32,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and that this probably was not such a good idea.

105
0:05:22.44,000 --> 0:05:23,000
(Laughter)

106
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So my work, my research focuses on how technology

107
0:05:27.6,000 --> 0:05:29,000
is transforming the social glue of society,

108
0:05:30.28,000 --> 0:05:31,000
trust between people,

109
0:05:31.96,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and it's a fascinating area to study,

110
0:05:34.24,000 --> 0:05:37,000
because there's still so much we do not know.

111
0:05:37.64,000 --> 0:05:42,000
For instance, do men and women trust differently in digital environments?

112
0:05:42.76,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Does the way we build trust face-to-face translate online?

113
0:05:47.68,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Does trust transfer?

114
0:05:49.64,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So if you trust finding a mate on Tinder,

115
0:05:52.36,000 --> 0:05:55,000
are you more likely to trust finding a ride on BlaBlaCar?

116
0:05:56.44,000 --> 0:05:59,000
But from studying hundreds of networks and marketplaces,

117
0:05:59.72,000 --> 0:06:01,000
there is a common pattern that people follow,

118
0:06:02.56,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and I call it "climbing the trust stack."

119
0:06:05.24,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Let me use BlaBlaCar as an example to bring it to life.

120
0:06:09.08,000 --> 0:06:1,000
On the first level,

121
0:06:10.4,000 --> 0:06:12,000
you have to trust the idea.

122
0:06:12.6,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So you have to trust

123
0:06:13.84,000 --> 0:06:16,000
the idea of ride-sharing is safe and worth trying.

124
0:06:17.64,000 --> 0:06:21,000
The second level is about having confidence in the platform,

125
0:06:22.36,000 --> 0:06:26,000
that BlaBlaCar will help you if something goes wrong.

126
0:06:26.52,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And the third level is about using little bits of information

127
0:06:30.2,000 --> 0:06:33,000
to decide whether the other person is trustworthy.

128
0:06:34.2,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Now, the first time we climb the trust stack,

129
0:06:36.84,000 --> 0:06:39,000
it feels weird, even risky,

130
0:06:40.12,000 --> 0:06:44,000
but we get to a point where these ideas seem totally normal.

131
0:06:45.12,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Our behaviors transform,

132
0:06:47.44,000 --> 0:06:48,000
often relatively quickly.

133
0:06:49.44,000 --> 0:06:53,000
In other words, trust enables change and innovation.

134
0:06:55.28,000 --> 0:06:58,000
So an idea that intrigued me, and I'd like you to consider,

135
0:06:58.72,000 --> 0:07:,000
is whether we can better understand

136
0:07:01.28,000 --> 0:07:05,000
major waves of disruption and change in individuals in society

137
0:07:05.48,000 --> 0:07:07,000
through the lens of trust.

138
0:07:07.56,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Well, it turns out that trust has only evolved

139
0:07:10.88,000 --> 0:07:14,000
in three significant chapters throughout the course of human history:

140
0:07:15.56,000 --> 0:07:17,000
local, institutional

141
0:07:17.8,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and what we're now entering, distributed.

142
0:07:20.68,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So for a long time,

143
0:07:23.04,000 --> 0:07:24,000
until the mid-1800s,

144
0:07:24.32,000 --> 0:07:27,000
trust was built around tight-knit relationships.

145
0:07:28.28,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So say I lived in a village

146
0:07:30.32,000 --> 0:07:32,000
with the first five rows of this audience,

147
0:07:32.92,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and we all knew one another,

148
0:07:34.88,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and say I wanted to borrow money.

149
0:07:37.8,000 --> 0:07:39,000
The man who had his eyes wide open, he might lend it to me,

150
0:07:40.8,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and if I didn't pay him back,

151
0:07:42.92,000 --> 0:07:43,000
you'd all know I was dodgy.

152
0:07:44.6,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I would get a bad reputation,

153
0:07:46.28,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and you would refuse to do business with me in the future.

154
0:07:49.36,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Trust was mostly local and accountability-based.

155
0:07:53.6,000 --> 0:07:54,000
In the mid-19th century,

156
0:07:54.96,000 --> 0:07:57,000
society went through a tremendous amount of change.

157
0:07:58.4,000 --> 0:08:01,000
People moved to fast-growing cities such as London and San Francisco,

158
0:08:02.2,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and a local banker here was replaced by large corporations

159
0:08:07.08,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that didn't know us as individuals.

160
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:11,000
We started to place our trust

161
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:15,000
into black box systems of authority,

162
0:08:15.6,000 --> 0:08:19,000
things like legal contracts and regulation and insurance,

163
0:08:19.92,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and less trust directly in other people.

164
0:08:23.96,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Trust became institutional and commission-based.

165
0:08:27.84,000 --> 0:08:31,000
It's widely talked about how trust in institutions and many corporate brands

166
0:08:32.68,000 --> 0:08:35,000
has been steadily declining and continues to do so.

167
0:08:36.44,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I am constantly stunned by major breaches of trust:

168
0:08:42.08,000 --> 0:08:44,000
the News Corp phone hacking,

169
0:08:44.6,000 --> 0:08:46,000
the Volkswagen emissions scandal,

170
0:08:47.44,000 --> 0:08:5,000
the widespread abuse in the Catholic Church,

171
0:08:50.799,000 --> 0:08:53,000
the fact that only one measly banker

172
0:08:54.039,000 --> 0:08:57,000
went to jail after the great financial crisis,

173
0:08:57.36,000 --> 0:08:59,000
or more recently the Panama Papers

174
0:08:59.44,000 --> 0:09:04,000
that revealed how the rich can exploit offshore tax regimes.

175
0:09:04.6,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And the thing that really surprises me

176
0:09:07.08,000 --> 0:09:11,000
is why do leaders find it so hard

177
0:09:11.12,000 --> 0:09:14,000
to apologize, I mean sincerely apologize,

178
0:09:14.32,000 --> 0:09:16,000
when our trust is broken?

179
0:09:17.36,000 --> 0:09:21,000
It would be easy to conclude that institutional trust isn't working

180
0:09:21.52,000 --> 0:09:22,000
because we are fed up

181
0:09:23.04,000 --> 0:09:25,000
with the sheer audacity of dishonest elites,

182
0:09:25.96,000 --> 0:09:26,000
but what's happening now

183
0:09:27.96,000 --> 0:09:32,000
runs deeper than the rampant questioning of the size and structure of institutions.

184
0:09:33.6,000 --> 0:09:35,000
We're starting to realize

185
0:09:35.64,000 --> 0:09:36,000
that institutional trust

186
0:09:37.44,000 --> 0:09:39,000
wasn't designed for the digital age.

187
0:09:40.44,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Conventions of how trust is built,

188
0:09:44.12,000 --> 0:09:46,000
managed, lost and repaired --

189
0:09:46.48,000 --> 0:09:48,000
in brands, leaders and entire systems --

190
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:51,000
is being turned upside down.

191
0:09:51.76,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Now, this is exciting,

192
0:09:53.88,000 --> 0:09:54,000
but it's frightening,

193
0:09:55.44,000 --> 0:09:57,000
because it forces many of us to have to rethink

194
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
how trust is built and destroyed with our customers, with our employees,

195
0:10:02.88,000 --> 0:10:03,000
even our loved ones.

196
0:10:05.8,000 --> 0:10:11,000
The other day, I was talking to the CEO of a leading international hotel brand,

197
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and as is often the case, we got onto the topic of Airbnb.

198
0:10:15.84,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And he admitted to me that he was perplexed by their success.

199
0:10:20.96,000 --> 0:10:22,000
He was perplexed at how a company

200
0:10:23.12,000 --> 0:10:27,000
that depends on the willingness of strangers to trust one another

201
0:10:27.32,000 --> 0:10:3,000
could work so well across 191 countries.

202
0:10:31.92,000 --> 0:10:34,000
So I said to him that I had a confession to make,

203
0:10:35.08,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and he looked at me a bit strangely,

204
0:10:37.08,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and I said --

205
0:10:38.48,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and I'm sure many of you do this as well --

206
0:10:40.52,000 --> 0:10:42,000
I don't always bother to hang my towels up

207
0:10:43.04,000 --> 0:10:45,000
when I'm finished in the hotel,

208
0:10:46,000 --> 0:10:48,000
but I would never do this as a guest on Airbnb.

209
0:10:49.56,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And the reason why I would never do this as a guest on Airbnb

210
0:10:52.92,000 --> 0:10:55,000
is because guests know that they'll be rated by hosts,

211
0:10:56.6,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and that those ratings are likely to impact their ability

212
0:11:00.36,000 --> 0:11:01,000
to transact in the future.

213
0:11:02.68,000 --> 0:11:06,000
It's a simple illustration of how online trust will change our behaviors

214
0:11:06.92,000 --> 0:11:07,000
in the real world,

215
0:11:08.24,000 --> 0:11:1,000
make us more accountable

216
0:11:10.76,000 --> 0:11:13,000
in ways we cannot yet even imagine.

217
0:11:14.88,000 --> 0:11:17,000
I am not saying we do not need hotels

218
0:11:17.96,000 --> 0:11:19,000
or traditional forms of authority.

219
0:11:20.32,000 --> 0:11:22,000
But what we cannot deny

220
0:11:22.44,000 --> 0:11:26,000
is that the way trust flows through society is changing,

221
0:11:26.72,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and it's creating this big shift

222
0:11:29.04,000 --> 0:11:3,000
away from the 20th century

223
0:11:30.92,000 --> 0:11:32,000
that was defined by institutional trust

224
0:11:33.76,000 --> 0:11:35,000
towards the 21st century

225
0:11:36.28,000 --> 0:11:38,000
that will be fueled by distributed trust.

226
0:11:39.48,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Trust is no longer top-down.

227
0:11:43.68,000 --> 0:11:45,000
It's being unbundled and inverted.

228
0:11:45.8,000 --> 0:11:47,000
It's no longer opaque and linear.

229
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
A new recipe for trust is emerging

230
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
that once again is distributed amongst people

231
0:11:56.08,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and is accountability-based.

232
0:11:58.24,000 --> 0:12:01,000
And this shift is only going to accelerate

233
0:12:01.68,000 --> 0:12:03,000
with the emergence of the blockchain,

234
0:12:04.44,000 --> 0:12:07,000
the innovative ledger technology underpinning Bitcoin.

235
0:12:08.8,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Now let's be honest,

236
0:12:11.76,000 --> 0:12:14,000
getting our heads around the way blockchain works

237
0:12:15.24,000 --> 0:12:16,000
is mind-blowing.

238
0:12:17.72,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And one of the reasons why is it involves processing

239
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:23,000
some pretty complicated concepts

240
0:12:23.68,000 --> 0:12:24,000
with terrible names.

241
0:12:25.2,000 --> 0:12:29,000
I mean, cryptographic algorithms and hash functions,

242
0:12:29.72,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and people called miners, who verify transactions --

243
0:12:32.8,000 --> 0:12:35,000
all that was created by this mysterious person

244
0:12:36.4,000 --> 0:12:38,000
or persons called Satoshi Nakamoto.

245
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Now, that is a massive trust leap that hasn't happened yet.

246
0:12:44.84,000 --> 0:12:47,000
(Applause)

247
0:12:47.92,000 --> 0:12:48,000
But let's try to imagine this.

248
0:12:49.4,000 --> 0:12:52,000
So "The Economist" eloquently described the blockchain

249
0:12:53.12,000 --> 0:12:56,000
as the great chain of being sure about things.

250
0:12:56.8,000 --> 0:13:01,000
The easiest way I can describe it is imagine the blocks as spreadsheets,

251
0:13:01.88,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and they are filled with assets.

252
0:13:04.88,000 --> 0:13:06,000
So that could be a property title.

253
0:13:07.32,000 --> 0:13:09,000
It could be a stock trade.

254
0:13:09.36,000 --> 0:13:11,000
It could be a creative asset, such as the rights to a song.

255
0:13:12.96,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Every time something moves

256
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
from one place on the register to somewhere else,

257
0:13:19.84,000 --> 0:13:22,000
that asset transfer is time-stamped

258
0:13:22.96,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and publicly recorded on the blockchain.

259
0:13:26.4,000 --> 0:13:27,000
It's that simple. Right.

260
0:13:28.72,000 --> 0:13:31,000
So the real implication of the blockchain

261
0:13:31.84,000 --> 0:13:35,000
is that it removes the need for any kind of third party,

262
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:37,000
such as a lawyer,

263
0:13:37.36,000 --> 0:13:4,000
or a trusted intermediary, or maybe not a government intermediary

264
0:13:40.84,000 --> 0:13:41,000
to facilitate the exchange.

265
0:13:42.68,000 --> 0:13:44,000
So if we go back to the trust stack,

266
0:13:44.96,000 --> 0:13:46,000
you still have to trust the idea,

267
0:13:47.72,000 --> 0:13:49,000
you have to trust the platform,

268
0:13:50.04,000 --> 0:13:52,000
but you don't have to trust the other person

269
0:13:53,000 --> 0:13:54,000
in the traditional sense.

270
0:13:54.96,000 --> 0:13:56,000
The implications are huge.

271
0:13:57.48,000 --> 0:14:,000
In the same way the internet blew open the doors to an age of information

272
0:14:01.2,000 --> 0:14:02,000
available to everyone,

273
0:14:02.64,000 --> 0:14:06,000
the blockchain will revolutionize trust on a global scale.

274
0:14:08.24,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Now, I've waited to the end intentionally to mention Uber,

275
0:14:12.2,000 --> 0:14:15,000
because I recognize that it is a contentious

276
0:14:15.68,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and widely overused example,

277
0:14:18.32,000 --> 0:14:21,000
but in the context of a new era of trust, it's a great case study.

278
0:14:21.92,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Now, we will see cases of abuse of distributed trust.

279
0:14:26.68,000 --> 0:14:29,000
We've already seen this, and it can go horribly wrong.

280
0:14:30.36,000 --> 0:14:35,000
I am not surprised that we are seeing protests from taxi associations

281
0:14:35.56,000 --> 0:14:36,000
all around the world

282
0:14:36.92,000 --> 0:14:4,000
trying to get governments to ban Uber based on claims that it is unsafe.

283
0:14:42.32,000 --> 0:14:46,000
I happened to be in London the day that these protests took place,

284
0:14:46.72,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and I happened to notice a tweet

285
0:14:48.72,000 --> 0:14:51,000
from Matt Hancock, who is a British minister for business.

286
0:14:52.36,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And he wrote,

287
0:14:53.6,000 --> 0:14:56,000
"Does anyone have details of this #Uber app everyone's talking about?

288
0:14:57.6,000 --> 0:14:58,000
(Laughter)

289
0:14:59.88,000 --> 0:15:01,000
I'd never heard of it until today."

290
0:15:03.56,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Now, the taxi associations,

291
0:15:07.8,000 --> 0:15:09,000
they legitimized the first layer of the trust stack.

292
0:15:10.56,000 --> 0:15:13,000
They legitimized the idea that they were trying to eliminate,

293
0:15:13.92,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and sign-ups increased by 850 percent in 24 hours.

294
0:15:19.08,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Now, this is a really strong illustration

295
0:15:22.36,000 --> 0:15:27,000
of how once a trust shift has happened around a behavior or an entire sector,

296
0:15:28.2,000 --> 0:15:3,000
you cannot reverse the story.

297
0:15:31.12,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Every day, five million people will take a trust leap

298
0:15:35,000 --> 0:15:36,000
and ride with Uber.

299
0:15:36.56,000 --> 0:15:39,000
In China, on Didi, the ride-sharing platform,

300
0:15:39.8,000 --> 0:15:41,000
11 million rides taken every day.

301
0:15:42.72,000 --> 0:15:45,000
That's 127 rides per second,

302
0:15:46.36,000 --> 0:15:48,000
showing that this is a cross-cultural phenomenon.

303
0:15:49.2,000 --> 0:15:53,000
And the fascinating thing is that both drivers and passengers report

304
0:15:53.4,000 --> 0:15:55,000
that seeing a name

305
0:15:55.92,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and seeing someone's photo and their rating

306
0:15:58.92,000 --> 0:16:,000
makes them feel safer,

307
0:16:01.2,000 --> 0:16:02,000
and as you may have experienced,

308
0:16:02.8,000 --> 0:16:05,000
even behave a little more nicely in the taxi cab.

309
0:16:07.36,000 --> 0:16:1,000
Uber and Didi are early but powerful examples

310
0:16:11.08,000 --> 0:16:14,000
of how technology is creating trust between people

311
0:16:15.08,000 --> 0:16:18,000
in ways and on a scale never possible before.

312
0:16:19.12,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Today, many of us are comfortable getting into cars driven by strangers.

313
0:16:25.2,000 --> 0:16:29,000
We meet up with someone we swiped right to be matched with.

314
0:16:29.52,000 --> 0:16:32,000
We share our homes with people we do not know.

315
0:16:33.48,000 --> 0:16:35,000
This is just the beginning,

316
0:16:36.44,000 --> 0:16:38,000
because the real disruption happening

317
0:16:39.04,000 --> 0:16:4,000
isn't technological.

318
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:43,000
It's the trust shift it creates,

319
0:16:43.88,000 --> 0:16:48,000
and for my part, I want to help people understand this new era of trust

320
0:16:49,000 --> 0:16:5,000
so that we can get it right

321
0:16:50.68,000 --> 0:16:53,000
and we can embrace the opportunities to redesign systems

322
0:16:54.6,000 --> 0:16:58,000
that are more transparent, inclusive and accountable.

323
0:16:58.72,000 --> 0:16:59,000

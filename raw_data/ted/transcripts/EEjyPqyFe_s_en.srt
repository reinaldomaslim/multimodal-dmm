1
0:00:12.96,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So it was the fall of 1902,

2
0:00:15.519,000 --> 0:00:16,000
and President Theodore Roosevelt

3
0:00:17.437,000 --> 0:00:18,000
needed a little break from the White House,

4
0:00:19.217,000 --> 0:00:21,000
so he took a train to Mississippi

5
0:00:21.595,000 --> 0:00:23,000
to do a little black bear hunting outside of a town

6
0:00:23.723,000 --> 0:00:25,000
called Smedes.

7
0:00:25.91,000 --> 0:00:27,000
The first day of the hunt, they didn't see a single bear,

8
0:00:27.97,000 --> 0:00:28,000
so it was a big bummer for everyone,

9
0:00:29.49,000 --> 0:00:31,000
but the second day, the dogs cornered one

10
0:00:32.334,000 --> 0:00:34,000
after a really long chase, but by that point,

11
0:00:34.734,000 --> 0:00:35,000
the president had given up

12
0:00:36.178,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and gone back to camp for lunch,

13
0:00:37.92,000 --> 0:00:39,000
so his hunting guide cracked the animal

14
0:00:40.531,000 --> 0:00:42,000
on the top of the head with the butt of his rifle,

15
0:00:43.199,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and then tied it up to a tree

16
0:00:44.907,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and started tooting away on his bugle

17
0:00:47.519,000 --> 0:00:49,000
to call Roosevelt back so he could have the honor

18
0:00:49.558,000 --> 0:00:5,000
of shooting it.

19
0:00:51.074,000 --> 0:00:53,000
The bear was a female.

20
0:00:53.431,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It was dazed, injured,

21
0:00:56.007,000 --> 0:00:59,000
severely underweight, a little mangy-looking,

22
0:00:59.654,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and when Roosevelt saw this animal

23
0:01:01.721,000 --> 0:01:02,000
tied up to the tree,

24
0:01:03.343,000 --> 0:01:04,000
he just couldn't bring himself to fire at it.

25
0:01:05.142,000 --> 0:01:07,000
He felt like that would go against his code

26
0:01:07.293,000 --> 0:01:08,000
as a sportsman.

27
0:01:09.259,000 --> 0:01:11,000
A few days later, the scene was memorialized

28
0:01:11.96,000 --> 0:01:14,000
in a political cartoon back in Washington.

29
0:01:14.995,000 --> 0:01:16,000
It was called "Drawing a Line in Mississippi,"

30
0:01:17.116,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and it showed Roosevelt with his gun down and his arm out,

31
0:01:19.495,000 --> 0:01:2,000
sparing the bear's life,

32
0:01:21.132,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and the bear was sitting on its hind legs

33
0:01:22.658,000 --> 0:01:24,000
with these two big, frightened, wide eyes

34
0:01:24.696,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and little ears pricked up at the top of its head.

35
0:01:26.826,000 --> 0:01:27,000
It looked really helpless, like you just wanted to

36
0:01:28.334,000 --> 0:01:29,000
sweep it up into your arms

37
0:01:30.034,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and reassure it.

38
0:01:31.25,000 --> 0:01:32,000
It wouldn't have looked familiar at the time,

39
0:01:32.716,000 --> 0:01:34,000
but if you go looking for the cartoon now,

40
0:01:34.784,000 --> 0:01:36,000
you recognize the animal right away:

41
0:01:37.52,000 --> 0:01:38,000
It's a teddy bear.

42
0:01:39.474,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And this is how the teddy bear was born.

43
0:01:41.095,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Essentially, toymakers took the bear from the cartoon,

44
0:01:43.603,000 --> 0:01:44,000
turned it into a plush toy, and then named it

45
0:01:45.203,000 --> 0:01:48,000
after President Roosevelt -- Teddy's bear.

46
0:01:48.397,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And I do feel a little ridiculous

47
0:01:50.541,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that I'm up here on this stage

48
0:01:53.476,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and I'm choosing to use my time

49
0:01:54.894,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to tell you about a 100-year-old story

50
0:01:57.162,000 --> 0:02:,000
about the invention of a squishy kid's toy,

51
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
but I'd argue that the invention of the teddy bear,

52
0:02:04.22,000 --> 0:02:06,000
inside that story is a more important story,

53
0:02:07.181,000 --> 0:02:09,000
a story about how dramatically our ideas

54
0:02:09.409,000 --> 0:02:1,000
about nature can change,

55
0:02:11.005,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and also about how, on the planet right now,

56
0:02:14.345,000 --> 0:02:16,000
the stories that we tell

57
0:02:16.441,000 --> 0:02:18,000
are dramatically changing nature.

58
0:02:18.709,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Because think about the teddy bear.

59
0:02:20.241,000 --> 0:02:22,000
For us, in retrospect, it feels like an obvious fit,

60
0:02:22.746,000 --> 0:02:23,000
because bears are so cute and cuddly,

61
0:02:24.249,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and who wouldn't want to give one to their kids to play with,

62
0:02:26.721,000 --> 0:02:28,000
but the truth is that in 1902,

63
0:02:29.253,000 --> 0:02:3,000
bears weren't cute and cuddly.

64
0:02:30.881,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I mean, they looked the same,

65
0:02:32.182,000 --> 0:02:33,000
but no one thought of them that way.

66
0:02:33.315,000 --> 0:02:35,000
In 1902, bears were monsters.

67
0:02:36.161,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Bears were something that frickin' terrified kids.

68
0:02:39.485,000 --> 0:02:4,000
For generations at that point,

69
0:02:41.145,000 --> 0:02:44,000
the bear had been a shorthand for all the danger

70
0:02:44.418,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that people were encountering on the frontier,

71
0:02:46.177,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and the federal government was actually

72
0:02:47.545,000 --> 0:02:49,000
systematically exterminating bears

73
0:02:49.83,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and lots of other predators too,

74
0:02:51.083,000 --> 0:02:52,000
like coyotes and wolves.

75
0:02:52.933,000 --> 0:02:53,000
These animals, they were being demonized.

76
0:02:54.781,000 --> 0:02:55,000
They were called murderers

77
0:02:56.079,000 --> 0:02:58,000
because they killed people's livestock.

78
0:02:58.235,000 --> 0:03:,000
One government biologist, he explained this

79
0:03:00.773,000 --> 0:03:02,000
war on animals like the bear by saying

80
0:03:02.953,000 --> 0:03:04,000
that they no longer had a place

81
0:03:05.343,000 --> 0:03:07,000
in our advancing civilization,

82
0:03:07.589,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and so we were just clearing them out of the way.

83
0:03:11.317,000 --> 0:03:14,000
In one 10-year period, close to half a million wolves

84
0:03:15.083,000 --> 0:03:16,000
had been slaughtered.

85
0:03:16.29,000 --> 0:03:17,000
The grizzly would soon be wiped out

86
0:03:18.147,000 --> 0:03:21,000
from 95 percent of its original territory,

87
0:03:21.58,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and whereas once there had been 30 million bison

88
0:03:24.802,000 --> 0:03:25,000
moving across the plains, and you would have

89
0:03:26.42,000 --> 0:03:27,000
these stories of trains having to stop

90
0:03:28.128,000 --> 0:03:29,000
for four or five hours so that these thick,

91
0:03:30.116,000 --> 0:03:33,000
living rivers of the animals could pour over the tracks,

92
0:03:33.444,000 --> 0:03:38,000
now, by 1902, there were maybe less than 100 left in the wild.

93
0:03:38.803,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And so what I'm saying is, the teddy bear was born

94
0:03:41.84,000 --> 0:03:44,000
into the middle of this great spasm of extermination,

95
0:03:45.364,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and you can see it as a sign that

96
0:03:46.91,000 --> 0:03:47,000
maybe some people deep down

97
0:03:48.55,000 --> 0:03:52,000
were starting to feel conflicted about all that killing.

98
0:03:52.616,000 --> 0:03:55,000
America still hated the bear and feared it,

99
0:03:55.644,000 --> 0:03:56,000
but all of a sudden, America also wanted

100
0:03:57.2,000 --> 0:03:59,000
to give the bear a great big hug.

101
0:04:00.086,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So this is something that I've been really curious about in the last few years.

102
0:04:02.315,000 --> 0:04:03,000
How do we imagine animals,

103
0:04:03.989,000 --> 0:04:04,000
how do we think and feel about them,

104
0:04:05.587,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and how do their reputations get written

105
0:04:08.063,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and then rewritten in our minds?

106
0:04:10.319,000 --> 0:04:12,000
We're here living in the eye of a great storm

107
0:04:13.163,000 --> 0:04:15,000
of extinction where half the species on the planet

108
0:04:16.015,000 --> 0:04:18,000
could be gone by the end of the century,

109
0:04:18.167,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and so why is it that we come to care about

110
0:04:19.701,000 --> 0:04:21,000
some of those species and not others?

111
0:04:22.571,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Well, there's a new field, a relatively new field

112
0:04:24.701,000 --> 0:04:25,000
of social science that started looking at

113
0:04:26.147,000 --> 0:04:28,000
these questions and trying to unpack the powerful

114
0:04:28.315,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and sometimes pretty schizophrenic relationships

115
0:04:30.047,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that we have to animals,

116
0:04:32.168,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and I spent a lot of time looking through

117
0:04:33.609,000 --> 0:04:35,000
their academic journals,

118
0:04:35.633,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and all I can really say is that their findings

119
0:04:37.439,000 --> 0:04:38,000
are astonishingly wide-ranging.

120
0:04:39.425,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So some of my favorites include that

121
0:04:41.251,000 --> 0:04:43,000
the more television a person watches in Upstate New York,

122
0:04:43.892,000 --> 0:04:44,000
the more he or she is afraid

123
0:04:45.545,000 --> 0:04:46,000
of being attacked by a black bear.

124
0:04:47.242,000 --> 0:04:49,000
If you show a tiger to an American,

125
0:04:50.03,000 --> 0:04:52,000
they're much more likely to assume that it's female

126
0:04:52.14,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and not male.

127
0:04:53.4,000 --> 0:04:54,000
In a study where a fake snake

128
0:04:55.168,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and a fake turtle were put on the side of the road,

129
0:04:57.153,000 --> 0:04:59,000
drivers hit the snake much more often than the turtle,

130
0:04:59.405,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and about three percent of drivers who hit the fake animals

131
0:05:01.469,000 --> 0:05:03,000
seemed to do it on purpose.

132
0:05:03.747,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Women are more likely than men to get a

133
0:05:06.337,000 --> 0:05:09,000
"magical feeling" when they see dolphins in the surf.

134
0:05:09.372,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Sixty-eight percent of mothers with

135
0:05:11.184,000 --> 0:05:14,000
"high feelings of entitlement and self-esteem"

136
0:05:14.564,000 --> 0:05:15,000
identified with the dancing cats

137
0:05:16.209,000 --> 0:05:18,000
in a commercial for Purina. (Laughter)

138
0:05:18.674,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Americans consider lobsters

139
0:05:20.359,000 --> 0:05:21,000
more important than pigeons

140
0:05:21.655,000 --> 0:05:23,000
but also much, much stupider.

141
0:05:23.841,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Wild turkeys are seen as only slightly more dangerous than sea otters,

142
0:05:26.837,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and pandas are twice as lovable as ladybugs.

143
0:05:32.01,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So some of this is physical, right?

144
0:05:33.443,000 --> 0:05:35,000
We tend to sympathize more with animals that look like us,

145
0:05:36.066,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and especially that resemble human babies,

146
0:05:37.696,000 --> 0:05:38,000
so with big, forward-facing eyes

147
0:05:39.123,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and circular faces,

148
0:05:40.385,000 --> 0:05:41,000
kind of a roly-poly posture.

149
0:05:42.119,000 --> 0:05:44,000
This is why, if you get a Christmas card from, like,

150
0:05:44.154,000 --> 0:05:45,000
your great aunt in Minnesota,

151
0:05:45.294,000 --> 0:05:46,000
there's usually a fuzzy penguin chick on it,

152
0:05:46.867,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and not something like a Glacier Bay wolf spider.

153
0:05:49.579,000 --> 0:05:51,000
But it's not all physical, right?

154
0:05:52.248,000 --> 0:05:55,000
There's a cultural dimension to how we think about animals,

155
0:05:55.432,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and we're telling stories about these animals,

156
0:05:57.312,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and like all stories,

157
0:05:58.67,000 --> 0:06:,000
they are shaped by the times and the places

158
0:06:00.743,000 --> 0:06:,000
in which we're telling them.

159
0:06:01.619,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So think about that moment

160
0:06:03.093,000 --> 0:06:05,000
back in 1902 again where a ferocious bear

161
0:06:06.011,000 --> 0:06:07,000
became a teddy bear.

162
0:06:07.444,000 --> 0:06:1,000
What was the context? Well, America was urbanizing.

163
0:06:10.511,000 --> 0:06:12,000
For the first time, nearly a majority of people lived in cities,

164
0:06:13.27,000 --> 0:06:15,000
so there was a growing distance between us and nature.

165
0:06:15.706,000 --> 0:06:16,000
There was a safe space where we could

166
0:06:17.498,000 --> 0:06:19,000
reconsider the bear and romanticize it.

167
0:06:20.172,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Nature could only start to seem this pure and adorable

168
0:06:22.906,000 --> 0:06:24,000
because we didn't have to be afraid of it anymore.

169
0:06:25.66,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And you can see that cycle playing out

170
0:06:27.185,000 --> 0:06:29,000
again and again with all kinds of animals.

171
0:06:29.347,000 --> 0:06:3,000
It seems like we're always stuck between

172
0:06:31.223,000 --> 0:06:33,000
demonizing a species and wanting to wipe it out,

173
0:06:33.63,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and then when we get very close to doing that,

174
0:06:35.21,000 --> 0:06:37,000
empathizing with it as an underdog

175
0:06:37.747,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and wanting to show it compassion.

176
0:06:40.272,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So we exert our power,

177
0:06:42.07,000 --> 0:06:43,000
but then we're unsettled

178
0:06:43.514,000 --> 0:06:45,000
by how powerful we are.

179
0:06:46.289,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So for example, this is one of

180
0:06:48.413,000 --> 0:06:5,000
probably thousands of letters and drawings

181
0:06:51.05,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that kids sent to the Bush administration,

182
0:06:52.594,000 --> 0:06:53,000
begging it to protect the polar bear

183
0:06:54.305,000 --> 0:06:55,000
under the Endangered Species Act,

184
0:06:55.572,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and these were sent back in the mid-2000s,

185
0:06:58.08,000 --> 0:07:,000
when awareness of climate change was suddenly surging.

186
0:07:00.233,000 --> 0:07:01,000
We kept seeing that image of a polar bear

187
0:07:01.562,000 --> 0:07:02,000
stranded on a little ice floe

188
0:07:02.98,000 --> 0:07:03,000
looking really morose.

189
0:07:04.327,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I spent days looking through these files.

190
0:07:06.091,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I really love them. This one's my favorite.

191
0:07:08.25,000 --> 0:07:1,000
If you can see, it's a polar bear that's drowning

192
0:07:10.361,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and then it's also being eaten simultaneously

193
0:07:12.776,000 --> 0:07:14,000
by a lobster and a shark.

194
0:07:15.48,000 --> 0:07:16,000
This one came from a kid named Fritz,

195
0:07:17.192,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and he's actually got a solution to climate change.

196
0:07:18.886,000 --> 0:07:19,000
He's got it all worked out to an ethanol-based solution.

197
0:07:20.732,000 --> 0:07:22,000
He says, "I feel bad about the polar bears.

198
0:07:23.382,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I like polar bears.

199
0:07:25.494,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Everyone can use corn juice for cars. From Fritz."

200
0:07:31.28,000 --> 0:07:33,000
So 200 years ago, you would have Arctic explorers

201
0:07:34.275,000 --> 0:07:36,000
writing about polar bears leaping into their boats

202
0:07:36.583,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and trying to devour them,

203
0:07:37.826,000 --> 0:07:38,000
even if they lit the bear on fire,

204
0:07:39.493,000 --> 0:07:41,000
but these kids don't see the polar bear that way,

205
0:07:41.673,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and actually they don't even see the polar bear

206
0:07:43.463,000 --> 0:07:44,000
the way that I did back in the '80s.

207
0:07:45.223,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I mean, we thought of these animals

208
0:07:46.343,000 --> 0:07:48,000
as mysterious and terrifying lords of the Arctic.

209
0:07:49.209,000 --> 0:07:51,000
But look now how quickly that climate change

210
0:07:51.529,000 --> 0:07:53,000
has flipped the image of the animal in our minds.

211
0:07:54.415,000 --> 0:07:56,000
It's gone from that bloodthirsty man-killer

212
0:07:56.855,000 --> 0:07:59,000
to this delicate, drowning victim,

213
0:07:59.929,000 --> 0:08:,000
and when you think about it, that's kind of

214
0:08:01.442,000 --> 0:08:02,000
the conclusion to the story

215
0:08:03.423,000 --> 0:08:06,000
that the teddy bear started telling back in 1902,

216
0:08:06.725,000 --> 0:08:08,000
because back then, America had more or less

217
0:08:09.615,000 --> 0:08:1,000
conquered its share of the continent.

218
0:08:10.93,000 --> 0:08:11,000
We were just getting around to

219
0:08:12.233,000 --> 0:08:14,000
polishing off these last wild predators.

220
0:08:14.251,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Now, society's reach has expanded

221
0:08:16.805,000 --> 0:08:18,000
all the way to the top of the world,

222
0:08:18.865,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and it's made even these, the most remote,

223
0:08:21.159,000 --> 0:08:23,000
the most powerful bears on the planet,

224
0:08:23.191,000 --> 0:08:26,000
seem like adorable and blameless victims.

225
0:08:26.69,000 --> 0:08:28,000
But you know, there's also a postscript to the teddy bear story

226
0:08:29.581,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that not a lot of people talk about.

227
0:08:31.218,000 --> 0:08:32,000
We're going to talk about it,

228
0:08:33.001,000 --> 0:08:35,000
because even though it didn't really take long

229
0:08:35.174,000 --> 0:08:36,000
after Roosevelt's hunt in 1902

230
0:08:36.974,000 --> 0:08:37,000
for the toy to become a full-blown craze,

231
0:08:38.951,000 --> 0:08:4,000
most people figured it was a fad,

232
0:08:41.452,000 --> 0:08:43,000
it was a sort of silly political novelty item

233
0:08:43.684,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and it would go away once the president left office,

234
0:08:45.926,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and so by 1909, when Roosevelt's successor,

235
0:08:49.723,000 --> 0:08:5,000
William Howard Taft,

236
0:08:51.148,000 --> 0:08:52,000
was getting ready to be inaugurated,

237
0:08:52.556,000 --> 0:08:53,000
the toy industry was on the hunt

238
0:08:54.488,000 --> 0:08:56,000
for the next big thing.

239
0:08:57.315,000 --> 0:08:59,000
They didn't do too well.

240
0:08:59.572,000 --> 0:09:01,000
That January, Taft was the guest of honor

241
0:09:02.171,000 --> 0:09:03,000
at a banquet in Atlanta,

242
0:09:03.61,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and for days in advance,

243
0:09:05.479,000 --> 0:09:06,000
the big news was the menu.

244
0:09:06.924,000 --> 0:09:07,000
They were going to be serving him

245
0:09:08.01,000 --> 0:09:1,000
a Southern specialty, a delicacy, really,

246
0:09:10.074,000 --> 0:09:12,000
called possum and taters.

247
0:09:12.98,000 --> 0:09:14,000
So you would have a whole opossum

248
0:09:15.582,000 --> 0:09:16,000
roasted on a bed of sweet potatoes,

249
0:09:16.947,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and then sometimes they'd leave

250
0:09:18.394,000 --> 0:09:21,000
the big tail on it like a big, meaty noodle.

251
0:09:21.878,000 --> 0:09:22,000
The one brought to Taft's table

252
0:09:23.557,000 --> 0:09:26,000
weighed 18 pounds.

253
0:09:26.742,000 --> 0:09:28,000
So after dinner, the orchestra started to play,

254
0:09:29.446,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and the guests burst into song,

255
0:09:31.286,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and all of a sudden, Taft was surprised

256
0:09:32.91,000 --> 0:09:33,000
with the presentation of a gift

257
0:09:34.632,000 --> 0:09:35,000
from a group of local supporters,

258
0:09:36.524,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and this was a stuffed opossum toy,

259
0:09:38.96,000 --> 0:09:4,000
all beady-eyed and bald-eared,

260
0:09:41.17,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and it was a new product they were putting forward

261
0:09:43.87,000 --> 0:09:45,000
to be the William Taft presidency's answer

262
0:09:46.592,000 --> 0:09:49,000
to Teddy Roosevelt's teddy bear.

263
0:09:50.14,000 --> 0:09:54,000
They were calling it the "billy possum."

264
0:09:54.586,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Within 24 hours, the Georgia Billy Possum Company

265
0:09:58.436,000 --> 0:09:59,000
was up and running, brokering deals

266
0:09:59.986,000 --> 0:10:,000
for these things nationwide,

267
0:10:01.586,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and the Los Angeles Times announced,

268
0:10:03.184,000 --> 0:10:04,000
very confidently, "The teddy bear

269
0:10:05.136,000 --> 0:10:07,000
has been relegated to a seat in the rear,

270
0:10:07.662,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and for four years, possibly eight,

271
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
the children of the United States

272
0:10:12.214,000 --> 0:10:15,000
will play with billy possum."

273
0:10:15.446,000 --> 0:10:17,000
So from that point, there was a fit of opossum fever.

274
0:10:17.57,000 --> 0:10:19,000
There were billy possum postcards, billy possum pins,

275
0:10:20.038,000 --> 0:10:22,000
billy possum pitchers for your cream at coffee time.

276
0:10:22.2,000 --> 0:10:23,000
There were smaller billy possums on a stick

277
0:10:23.93,000 --> 0:10:25,000
that kids could wave around like flags.

278
0:10:26.872,000 --> 0:10:27,000
But even with all this marketing,

279
0:10:28.79,000 --> 0:10:3,000
the life of the billy possum

280
0:10:30.82,000 --> 0:10:33,000
turned out to be just pathetically brief.

281
0:10:34.004,000 --> 0:10:36,000
The toy was an absolute flop,

282
0:10:36.047,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and it was almost completely forgotten

283
0:10:37.626,000 --> 0:10:38,000
by the end of the year,

284
0:10:38.994,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and what that means is that the billy possum

285
0:10:41.086,000 --> 0:10:42,000
didn't even make it to Christmastime,

286
0:10:42.586,000 --> 0:10:43,000
which when you think about it is

287
0:10:43.626,000 --> 0:10:46,000
a special sort of tragedy for a toy.

288
0:10:47.475,000 --> 0:10:48,000
So we can explain that failure two ways.

289
0:10:49.398,000 --> 0:10:51,000
The first, well, it's pretty obvious.

290
0:10:51.588,000 --> 0:10:52,000
I'm going to go ahead and say it out loud anyway:

291
0:10:53.476,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Opossums are hideous. (Laughter)

292
0:10:56.337,000 --> 0:10:58,000
But maybe more importantly is that

293
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:01,000
the story of the billy possum was all wrong,

294
0:11:01.69,000 --> 0:11:02,000
especially compared

295
0:11:03.221,000 --> 0:11:05,000
to the backstory of the teddy bear.

296
0:11:05.302,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Think about it: for most of human's evolutionary history,

297
0:11:07.544,000 --> 0:11:09,000
what's made bears impressive to us

298
0:11:09.869,000 --> 0:11:11,000
has been their complete independence from us.

299
0:11:12.041,000 --> 0:11:14,000
It's that they live these parallel lives

300
0:11:14.626,000 --> 0:11:16,000
as menaces and competitors.

301
0:11:17.131,000 --> 0:11:19,000
By the time Roosevelt went hunting in Mississippi,

302
0:11:19.486,000 --> 0:11:2,000
that stature was being crushed,

303
0:11:21.464,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and the animal that he had roped to a tree

304
0:11:23.702,000 --> 0:11:25,000
really was a symbol for all bears.

305
0:11:26.003,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Whether those animals lived or died now

306
0:11:28.43,000 --> 0:11:31,000
was entirely up to the compassion

307
0:11:31.44,000 --> 0:11:33,000
or the indifference of people.

308
0:11:33.857,000 --> 0:11:34,000
That said something really ominous

309
0:11:35.681,000 --> 0:11:37,000
about the future of bears,

310
0:11:38.363,000 --> 0:11:41,000
but it also said something very unsettling about who we'd become,

311
0:11:41.5,000 --> 0:11:43,000
if the survival of even an animal like that

312
0:11:43.942,000 --> 0:11:45,000
was up to us now.

313
0:11:46.231,000 --> 0:11:48,000
So now, a century later, if you're at all

314
0:11:48.311,000 --> 0:11:5,000
paying attention to what's happening in the environment,

315
0:11:50.511,000 --> 0:11:53,000
you feel that discomfort so much more intensely.

316
0:11:54.189,000 --> 0:11:56,000
We're living now in an age of what scientists

317
0:11:57.011,000 --> 0:11:59,000
have started to call "conservation reliance,"

318
0:11:59.221,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and what that term means is that we've disrupted

319
0:12:01.411,000 --> 0:12:04,000
so much that nature can't possibly stand on its own anymore,

320
0:12:04.575,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and most endangered species

321
0:12:06.277,000 --> 0:12:07,000
are only going to survive

322
0:12:08.049,000 --> 0:12:1,000
if we stay out there in the landscape

323
0:12:10.167,000 --> 0:12:12,000
riggging the world around them in their favor.

324
0:12:12.663,000 --> 0:12:13,000
So we've gone hands-on

325
0:12:14.519,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and we can't ever take our hands off,

326
0:12:16.957,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and that's a hell of a lot of work.

327
0:12:18.85,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Right now, we're training condors

328
0:12:21.929,000 --> 0:12:22,000
not to perch on power lines.

329
0:12:23.881,000 --> 0:12:25,000
We teach whooping cranes to migrate south for the winter

330
0:12:26.594,000 --> 0:12:28,000
behind little ultra-light airplanes.

331
0:12:28.893,000 --> 0:12:31,000
We're out there feeding plague vaccine to ferrets.

332
0:12:32.202,000 --> 0:12:36,000
We monitor pygmy rabbits with drones.

333
0:12:36.552,000 --> 0:12:39,000
So we've gone from annihilating species

334
0:12:39.869,000 --> 0:12:42,000
to micromanaging the survival of a lot of species

335
0:12:43.373,000 --> 0:12:44,000
indefinitely, and which ones?

336
0:12:45.315,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Well, the ones that we've told

337
0:12:46.507,000 --> 0:12:47,000
compelling stories about,

338
0:12:48.131,000 --> 0:12:51,000
the ones we've decided ought to stick around.

339
0:12:51.346,000 --> 0:12:54,000
The line between conservation and domestication

340
0:12:54.92,000 --> 0:12:56,000
is blurred.

341
0:12:56.945,000 --> 0:12:57,000
So what I've been saying is that the stories

342
0:12:58.797,000 --> 0:13:,000
that we tell about wild animals are so subjective

343
0:13:01.42,000 --> 0:13:02,000
they can be irrational

344
0:13:02.582,000 --> 0:13:04,000
or romanticized or sensationalized.

345
0:13:04.766,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Sometimes they just have nothing to do with the facts.

346
0:13:07.515,000 --> 0:13:1,000
But in a world of conservation reliance,

347
0:13:10.765,000 --> 0:13:12,000
those stories have very real consequences,

348
0:13:12.971,000 --> 0:13:14,000
because now, how we feel about an animal

349
0:13:15.399,000 --> 0:13:16,000
affects its survival

350
0:13:17.029,000 --> 0:13:19,000
more than anything that you read about

351
0:13:19.389,000 --> 0:13:21,000
in ecology textbooks.

352
0:13:21.438,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Storytelling matters now.

353
0:13:23.84,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Emotion matters.

354
0:13:25.373,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Our imagination has become an ecological force.

355
0:13:31.025,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And so maybe the teddy bear worked in part

356
0:13:32.962,000 --> 0:13:34,000
because the legend of Roosevelt

357
0:13:35.653,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and that bear in Mississippi

358
0:13:37.708,000 --> 0:13:38,000
was kind of like an allegory

359
0:13:39.168,000 --> 0:13:41,000
of this great responsibility that society

360
0:13:41.261,000 --> 0:13:43,000
was just beginning to face up to back then.

361
0:13:43.955,000 --> 0:13:45,000
It would be another 71 years

362
0:13:46.375,000 --> 0:13:47,000
before the Endangered Species Act was passed,

363
0:13:48.229,000 --> 0:13:5,000
but really, here's its whole ethos

364
0:13:50.559,000 --> 0:13:51,000
boiled down into something like a scene

365
0:13:52.513,000 --> 0:13:54,000
you'd see in a stained glass window.

366
0:13:54.859,000 --> 0:13:56,000
The bear is a helpless victim tied to a tree,

367
0:13:57.851,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and the president of the United States

368
0:14:00.402,000 --> 0:14:02,000
decided to show it some mercy.

369
0:14:02.794,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Thank you.

370
0:14:05.44,000 --> 0:14:06,000
(Applause)

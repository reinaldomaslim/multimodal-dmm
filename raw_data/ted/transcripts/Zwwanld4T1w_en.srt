1
0:00:12.704,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm going to be talking about statistics today.

2
0:00:15.491,000 --> 0:00:18,000
If that makes you immediately feel a little bit wary, that's OK,

3
0:00:18.653,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that doesn't make you some kind of crazy conspiracy theorist,

4
0:00:21.536,000 --> 0:00:22,000
it makes you skeptical.

5
0:00:22.856,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And when it comes to numbers, especially now, you should be skeptical.

6
0:00:26.766,000 --> 0:00:29,000
But you should also be able to tell which numbers are reliable

7
0:00:29.801,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and which ones aren't.

8
0:00:30.985,000 --> 0:00:33,000
So today I want to try to give you some tools to be able to do that.

9
0:00:34.215,000 --> 0:00:35,000
But before I do,

10
0:00:35.408,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I just want to clarify which numbers I'm talking about here.

11
0:00:38.271,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I'm not talking about claims like,

12
0:00:39.93,000 --> 0:00:41,000
"9 out of 10 women recommend this anti-aging cream."

13
0:00:42.403,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I think a lot of us always roll our eyes at numbers like that.

14
0:00:45.399,000 --> 0:00:47,000
What's different now is people are questioning statistics like,

15
0:00:48.407,000 --> 0:00:5,000
"The US unemployment rate is five percent."

16
0:00:50.445,000 --> 0:00:53,000
What makes this claim different is it doesn't come from a private company,

17
0:00:53.985,000 --> 0:00:54,000
it comes from the government.

18
0:00:55.397,000 --> 0:00:58,000
About 4 out of 10 Americans distrust the economic data

19
0:00:58.757,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that gets reported by government.

20
0:01:00.354,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Among supporters of President Trump it's even higher;

21
0:01:02.869,000 --> 0:01:03,000
it's about 7 out of 10.

22
0:01:04.526,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I don't need to tell anyone here

23
0:01:06.354,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that there are a lot of dividing lines in our society right now,

24
0:01:09.389,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and a lot of them start to make sense,

25
0:01:11.238,000 --> 0:01:14,000
once you understand people's relationships with these government numbers.

26
0:01:14.949,000 --> 0:01:17,000
On the one hand, there are those who say these statistics are crucial,

27
0:01:18.309,000 --> 0:01:2,000
that we need them to make sense of society as a whole

28
0:01:20.963,000 --> 0:01:22,000
in order to move beyond emotional anecdotes

29
0:01:23.151,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and measure progress in an [objective] way.

30
0:01:25.585,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And then there are the others,

31
0:01:27.076,000 --> 0:01:29,000
who say that these statistics are elitist,

32
0:01:29.256,000 --> 0:01:3,000
maybe even rigged;

33
0:01:30.488,000 --> 0:01:32,000
they don't make sense and they don't really reflect

34
0:01:32.906,000 --> 0:01:34,000
what's happening in people's everyday lives.

35
0:01:35.226,000 --> 0:01:38,000
It kind of feels like that second group is winning the argument right now.

36
0:01:38.737,000 --> 0:01:4,000
We're living in a world of alternative facts,

37
0:01:40.869,000 --> 0:01:42,000
where people don't find statistics this kind of common ground,

38
0:01:43.828,000 --> 0:01:44,000
this starting point for debate.

39
0:01:45.488,000 --> 0:01:46,000
This is a problem.

40
0:01:46.798,000 --> 0:01:48,000
There are actually moves in the US right now

41
0:01:48.889,000 --> 0:01:5,000
to get rid of some government statistics altogether.

42
0:01:51.774,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Right now there's a bill in congress about measuring racial inequality.

43
0:01:55.185,000 --> 0:01:57,000
The draft law says that government money should not be used

44
0:01:58.01,000 --> 0:01:59,000
to collect data on racial segregation.

45
0:01:59.936,000 --> 0:02:,000
This is a total disaster.

46
0:02:01.845,000 --> 0:02:02,000
If we don't have this data,

47
0:02:03.617,000 --> 0:02:04,000
how can we observe discrimination,

48
0:02:05.419,000 --> 0:02:06,000
let alone fix it?

49
0:02:06.721,000 --> 0:02:07,000
In other words:

50
0:02:07.933,000 --> 0:02:09,000
How can a government create fair policies

51
0:02:10.016,000 --> 0:02:12,000
if they can't measure current levels of unfairness?

52
0:02:12.811,000 --> 0:02:13,000
This isn't just about discrimination,

53
0:02:14.629,000 --> 0:02:15,000
it's everything -- think about it.

54
0:02:16.323,000 --> 0:02:17,000
How can we legislate on health care

55
0:02:18.037,000 --> 0:02:2,000
if we don't have good data on health or poverty?

56
0:02:20.332,000 --> 0:02:22,000
How can we have public debate about immigration

57
0:02:22.554,000 --> 0:02:23,000
if we can't at least agree

58
0:02:23.828,000 --> 0:02:25,000
on how many people are entering and leaving the country?

59
0:02:26.495,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Statistics come from the state; that's where they got their name.

60
0:02:29.577,000 --> 0:02:31,000
The point was to better measure the population

61
0:02:31.758,000 --> 0:02:32,000
in order to better serve it.

62
0:02:33.139,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So we need these government numbers,

63
0:02:34.888,000 --> 0:02:36,000
but we also have to move beyond either blindly accepting

64
0:02:37.559,000 --> 0:02:38,000
or blindly rejecting them.

65
0:02:38.851,000 --> 0:02:4,000
We need to learn the skills to be able to spot bad statistics.

66
0:02:41.872,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I started to learn some of these

67
0:02:43.424,000 --> 0:02:45,000
when I was working in a statistical department

68
0:02:45.614,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that's part of the United Nations.

69
0:02:47.281,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Our job was to find out how many Iraqis had been forced from their homes

70
0:02:50.711,000 --> 0:02:51,000
as a result of the war,

71
0:02:51.893,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and what they needed.

72
0:02:53.075,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It was really important work, but it was also incredibly difficult.

73
0:02:56.277,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Every single day, we were making decisions

74
0:02:58.319,000 --> 0:03:,000
that affected the accuracy of our numbers --

75
0:03:00.5,000 --> 0:03:02,000
decisions like which parts of the country we should go to,

76
0:03:03.268,000 --> 0:03:04,000
who we should speak to,

77
0:03:04.448,000 --> 0:03:05,000
which questions we should ask.

78
0:03:06.04,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And I started to feel really disillusioned with our work,

79
0:03:08.744,000 --> 0:03:1,000
because we thought we were doing a really good job,

80
0:03:11.286,000 --> 0:03:14,000
but the one group of people who could really tell us were the Iraqis,

81
0:03:14.588,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and they rarely got the chance to find our analysis, let alone question it.

82
0:03:18.152,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So I started to feel really determined

83
0:03:20.007,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that the one way to make numbers more accurate

84
0:03:22.342,000 --> 0:03:25,000
is to have as many people as possible be able to question them.

85
0:03:25.419,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So I became a data journalist.

86
0:03:26.877,000 --> 0:03:29,000
My job is finding these data sets and sharing them with the public.

87
0:03:30.805,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Anyone can do this, you don't have to be a geek or a nerd.

88
0:03:34.002,000 --> 0:03:36,000
You can ignore those words; they're used by people

89
0:03:36.381,000 --> 0:03:38,000
trying to say they're smart while pretending they're humble.

90
0:03:39.227,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Absolutely anyone can do this.

91
0:03:40.84,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I want to give you guys three questions

92
0:03:42.931,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that will help you be able to spot some bad statistics.

93
0:03:45.96,000 --> 0:03:48,000
So, question number one is: Can you see uncertainty?

94
0:03:49.491,000 --> 0:03:52,000
One of things that's really changed people's relationship with numbers,

95
0:03:52.879,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and even their trust in the media,

96
0:03:54.544,000 --> 0:03:56,000
has been the use of political polls.

97
0:03:56.826,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I personally have a lot of issues with political polls

98
0:03:59.388,000 --> 0:04:02,000
because I think the role of journalists is actually to report the facts

99
0:04:02.788,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and not attempt to predict them,

100
0:04:04.365,000 --> 0:04:06,000
especially when those predictions can actually damage democracy

101
0:04:07.385,000 --> 0:04:09,000
by signaling to people: don't bother to vote for that guy,

102
0:04:10.141,000 --> 0:04:11,000
he doesn't have a chance.

103
0:04:11.37,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Let's set that aside for now and talk about the accuracy of this endeavor.

104
0:04:15.048,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Based on national elections in the UK, Italy, Israel

105
0:04:19.68,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and of course, the most recent US presidential election,

106
0:04:22.468,000 --> 0:04:24,000
using polls to predict electoral outcomes

107
0:04:24.629,000 --> 0:04:27,000
is about as accurate as using the moon to predict hospital admissions.

108
0:04:28.465,000 --> 0:04:32,000
No, seriously, I used actual data from an academic study to draw this.

109
0:04:32.689,000 --> 0:04:35,000
There are a lot of reasons why polling has become so inaccurate.

110
0:04:36.44,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Our societies have become really diverse,

111
0:04:38.434,000 --> 0:04:41,000
which makes it difficult for pollsters to get a really nice representative sample

112
0:04:42.279,000 --> 0:04:43,000
of the population for their polls.

113
0:04:43.93,000 --> 0:04:46,000
People are really reluctant to answer their phones to pollsters,

114
0:04:46.96,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and also, shockingly enough, people might lie.

115
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
But you wouldn't necessarily know that to look at the media.

116
0:04:52.095,000 --> 0:04:54,000
For one thing, the probability of a Hillary Clinton win

117
0:04:54.88,000 --> 0:04:56,000
was communicated with decimal places.

118
0:04:57.695,000 --> 0:04:59,000
We don't use decimal places to describe the temperature.

119
0:05:00.34,000 --> 0:05:04,000
How on earth can predicting the behavior of 230 million voters in this country

120
0:05:04.592,000 --> 0:05:05,000
be that precise?

121
0:05:06.445,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And then there were those sleek charts.

122
0:05:08.471,000 --> 0:05:11,000
See, a lot of data visualizations will overstate certainty, and it works --

123
0:05:12.468,000 --> 0:05:14,000
these charts can numb our brains to criticism.

124
0:05:15.112,000 --> 0:05:17,000
When you hear a statistic, you might feel skeptical.

125
0:05:17.694,000 --> 0:05:18,000
As soon as it's buried in a chart,

126
0:05:19.353,000 --> 0:05:21,000
it feels like some kind of objective science,

127
0:05:21.506,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and it's not.

128
0:05:22.779,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So I was trying to find ways to better communicate this to people,

129
0:05:25.906,000 --> 0:05:27,000
to show people the uncertainty in our numbers.

130
0:05:28.434,000 --> 0:05:3,000
What I did was I started taking real data sets,

131
0:05:30.704,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and turning them into hand-drawn visualizations,

132
0:05:33.38,000 --> 0:05:35,000
so that people can see how imprecise the data is;

133
0:05:36.076,000 --> 0:05:37,000
so people can see that a human did this,

134
0:05:38.096,000 --> 0:05:39,000
a human found the data and visualized it.

135
0:05:40.092,000 --> 0:05:42,000
For example, instead of finding out the probability

136
0:05:42.788,000 --> 0:05:44,000
of getting the flu in any given month,

137
0:05:44.938,000 --> 0:05:46,000
you can see the rough distribution of flu season.

138
0:05:47.754,000 --> 0:05:48,000
This is --

139
0:05:48.945,000 --> 0:05:49,000
(Laughter)

140
0:05:49.987,000 --> 0:05:5,000
a bad shot to show in February.

141
0:05:51.497,000 --> 0:05:53,000
But it's also more responsible data visualization,

142
0:05:53.976,000 --> 0:05:55,000
because if you were to show the exact probabilities,

143
0:05:56.455,000 --> 0:05:58,000
maybe that would encourage people to get their flu jabs

144
0:05:59.071,000 --> 0:06:,000
at the wrong time.

145
0:06:00.983,000 --> 0:06:01,000
The point of these shaky lines

146
0:06:02.7,000 --> 0:06:04,000
is so that people remember these imprecisions,

147
0:06:05.635,000 --> 0:06:08,000
but also so they don't necessarily walk away with a specific number,

148
0:06:08.886,000 --> 0:06:09,000
but they can remember important facts.

149
0:06:10.776,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Facts like injustice and inequality leave a huge mark on our lives.

150
0:06:14.824,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Facts like Black Americans and Native Americans have shorter life expectancies

151
0:06:19.037,000 --> 0:06:2,000
than those of other races,

152
0:06:20.461,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and that isn't changing anytime soon.

153
0:06:22.623,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Facts like prisoners in the US can be kept in solitary confinement cells

154
0:06:26.548,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that are smaller than the size of an average parking space.

155
0:06:30.355,000 --> 0:06:33,000
The point of these visualizations is also to remind people

156
0:06:33.714,000 --> 0:06:35,000
of some really important statistical concepts,

157
0:06:36.088,000 --> 0:06:37,000
concepts like averages.

158
0:06:37.748,000 --> 0:06:38,000
So let's say you hear a claim like,

159
0:06:39.44,000 --> 0:06:43,000
"The average swimming pool in the US contains 6.23 fecal accidents."

160
0:06:43.898,000 --> 0:06:45,000
That doesn't mean every single swimming pool in the country

161
0:06:46.719,000 --> 0:06:48,000
contains exactly 6.23 turds.

162
0:06:48.937,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So in order to show that,

163
0:06:50.378,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I went back to the original data, which comes from the CDC,

164
0:06:53.243,000 --> 0:06:55,000
who surveyed 47 swimming facilities.

165
0:06:55.332,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And I just spent one evening redistributing poop.

166
0:06:57.747,000 --> 0:06:59,000
So you can kind of see how misleading averages can be.

167
0:07:00.453,000 --> 0:07:01,000
(Laughter)

168
0:07:01.759,000 --> 0:07:04,000
OK, so the second question that you guys should be asking yourselves

169
0:07:05.684,000 --> 0:07:06,000
to spot bad numbers is:

170
0:07:07.209,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Can I see myself in the data?

171
0:07:09.2,000 --> 0:07:11,000
This question is also about averages in a way,

172
0:07:12.137,000 --> 0:07:14,000
because part of the reason why people are so frustrated

173
0:07:14.766,000 --> 0:07:15,000
with these national statistics,

174
0:07:16.285,000 --> 0:07:19,000
is they don't really tell the story of who's winning and who's losing

175
0:07:19.582,000 --> 0:07:2,000
from national policy.

176
0:07:20.762,000 --> 0:07:23,000
It's easy to understand why people are frustrated with global averages

177
0:07:24.104,000 --> 0:07:26,000
when they don't match up with their personal experiences.

178
0:07:26.807,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I wanted to show people the way data relates to their everyday lives.

179
0:07:30.094,000 --> 0:07:32,000
I started this advice column called "Dear Mona,"

180
0:07:32.364,000 --> 0:07:34,000
where people would write to me with questions and concerns

181
0:07:35.114,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and I'd try to answer them with data.

182
0:07:36.922,000 --> 0:07:37,000
People asked me anything.

183
0:07:38.146,000 --> 0:07:41,000
questions like, "Is it normal to sleep in a separate bed to my wife?"

184
0:07:41.431,000 --> 0:07:42,000
"Do people regret their tattoos?"

185
0:07:43.046,000 --> 0:07:45,000
"What does it mean to die of natural causes?"

186
0:07:45.234,000 --> 0:07:47,000
All of these questions are great, because they make you think

187
0:07:48.224,000 --> 0:07:5,000
about ways to find and communicate these numbers.

188
0:07:50.584,000 --> 0:07:52,000
If someone asks you, "How much pee is a lot of pee?"

189
0:07:53.111,000 --> 0:07:55,000
which is a question that I got asked,

190
0:07:55.593,000 --> 0:07:57,000
you really want to make sure that the visualization makes sense

191
0:07:58.597,000 --> 0:07:59,000
to as many people as possible.

192
0:08:00.368,000 --> 0:08:01,000
These numbers aren't unavailable.

193
0:08:01.967,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Sometimes they're just buried in the appendix of an academic study.

194
0:08:05.498,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And they're certainly not inscrutable;

195
0:08:07.361,000 --> 0:08:09,000
if you really wanted to test these numbers on urination volume,

196
0:08:10.36,000 --> 0:08:12,000
you could grab a bottle and try it for yourself.

197
0:08:12.641,000 --> 0:08:13,000
(Laughter)

198
0:08:13.673,000 --> 0:08:14,000
The point of this isn't necessarily

199
0:08:15.391,000 --> 0:08:17,000
that every single data set has to relate specifically to you.

200
0:08:18.292,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I'm interested in how many women were issued fines in France

201
0:08:21.196,000 --> 0:08:22,000
for wearing the face veil, or the niqab,

202
0:08:23.179,000 --> 0:08:25,000
even if I don't live in France or wear the face veil.

203
0:08:25.821,000 --> 0:08:28,000
The point of asking where you fit in is to get as much context as possible.

204
0:08:29.68,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So it's about zooming out from one data point,

205
0:08:31.895,000 --> 0:08:33,000
like the unemployment rate is five percent,

206
0:08:34.023,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and seeing how it changes over time,

207
0:08:35.804,000 --> 0:08:37,000
or seeing how it changes by educational status --

208
0:08:38.478,000 --> 0:08:41,000
this is why your parents always wanted you to go to college --

209
0:08:41.606,000 --> 0:08:43,000
or seeing how it varies by gender.

210
0:08:43.662,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Nowadays, male unemployment rate is higher

211
0:08:45.813,000 --> 0:08:46,000
than the female unemployment rate.

212
0:08:47.537,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Up until the early '80s, it was the other way around.

213
0:08:50.256,000 --> 0:08:52,000
This is a story of one of the biggest changes

214
0:08:52.397,000 --> 0:08:53,000
that's happened in American society,

215
0:08:54.141,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and it's all there in that chart, once you look beyond the averages.

216
0:08:57.441,000 --> 0:08:58,000
The axes are everything;

217
0:08:58.63,000 --> 0:09:,000
once you change the scale, you can change the story.

218
0:09:01.323,000 --> 0:09:04,000
OK, so the third and final question that I want you guys to think about

219
0:09:04.727,000 --> 0:09:05,000
when you're looking at statistics is:

220
0:09:06.57,000 --> 0:09:07,000
How was the data collected?

221
0:09:09.487,000 --> 0:09:11,000
So far, I've only talked about the way data is communicated,

222
0:09:12.45,000 --> 0:09:14,000
but the way it's collected matters just as much.

223
0:09:14.75,000 --> 0:09:15,000
I know this is tough,

224
0:09:15.941,000 --> 0:09:18,000
because methodologies can be opaque and actually kind of boring,

225
0:09:19.046,000 --> 0:09:21,000
but there are some simple steps you can take to check this.

226
0:09:21.943,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I'll use one last example here.

227
0:09:24.129,000 --> 0:09:27,000
One poll found that 41 percent of Muslims in this country support jihad,

228
0:09:28.04,000 --> 0:09:29,000
which is obviously pretty scary,

229
0:09:29.589,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and it was reported everywhere in 2015.

230
0:09:32.255,000 --> 0:09:34,000
When I want to check a number like that,

231
0:09:34.894,000 --> 0:09:36,000
I'll start off by finding the original questionnaire.

232
0:09:37.419,000 --> 0:09:39,000
It turns out that journalists who reported on that statistic

233
0:09:40.369,000 --> 0:09:42,000
ignored a question lower down on the survey

234
0:09:42.624,000 --> 0:09:44,000
that asked respondents how they defined "jihad."

235
0:09:44.994,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And most of them defined it as,

236
0:09:46.999,000 --> 0:09:49,000
"Muslims' personal, peaceful struggle to be more religious."

237
0:09:50.965,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Only 16 percent defined it as, "violent holy war against unbelievers."

238
0:09:55.183,000 --> 0:09:57,000
This is the really important point:

239
0:09:57.637,000 --> 0:09:59,000
based on those numbers, it's totally possible

240
0:09:59.816,000 --> 0:10:02,000
that no one in the survey who defined it as violent holy war

241
0:10:02.945,000 --> 0:10:03,000
also said they support it.

242
0:10:04.301,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Those two groups might not overlap at all.

243
0:10:06.942,000 --> 0:10:08,000
It's also worth asking how the survey was carried out.

244
0:10:09.603,000 --> 0:10:1,000
This was something called an opt-in poll,

245
0:10:11.625,000 --> 0:10:14,000
which means anyone could have found it on the internet and completed it.

246
0:10:15.051,000 --> 0:10:18,000
There's no way of knowing if those people even identified as Muslim.

247
0:10:18.414,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And finally, there were 600 respondents in that poll.

248
0:10:21.05,000 --> 0:10:23,000
There are roughly three million Muslims in this country,

249
0:10:23.728,000 --> 0:10:24,000
according to Pew Research Center.

250
0:10:25.359,000 --> 0:10:27,000
That means the poll spoke to roughly one in every 5,000 Muslims

251
0:10:28.376,000 --> 0:10:29,000
in this country.

252
0:10:29.568,000 --> 0:10:3,000
This is one of the reasons

253
0:10:30.858,000 --> 0:10:33,000
why government statistics are often better than private statistics.

254
0:10:34.489,000 --> 0:10:37,000
A poll might speak to a couple hundred people, maybe a thousand,

255
0:10:37.548,000 --> 0:10:4,000
or if you're L'Oreal, trying to sell skin care products in 2005,

256
0:10:40.63,000 --> 0:10:42,000
then you spoke to 48 women to claim that they work.

257
0:10:43.071,000 --> 0:10:44,000
(Laughter)

258
0:10:44.121,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Private companies don't have a huge interest in getting the numbers right,

259
0:10:47.701,000 --> 0:10:48,000
they just need the right numbers.

260
0:10:49.48,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Government statisticians aren't like that.

261
0:10:51.524,000 --> 0:10:53,000
In theory, at least, they're totally impartial,

262
0:10:53.995,000 --> 0:10:56,000
not least because most of them do their jobs regardless of who's in power.

263
0:10:57.52,000 --> 0:10:58,000
They're civil servants.

264
0:10:58.706,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And to do their jobs properly,

265
0:11:00.694,000 --> 0:11:02,000
they don't just speak to a couple hundred people.

266
0:11:03.081,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Those unemployment numbers I keep on referencing

267
0:11:05.423,000 --> 0:11:07,000
come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics,

268
0:11:07.451,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and to make their estimates,

269
0:11:08.81,000 --> 0:11:11,000
they speak to over 140,000 businesses in this country.

270
0:11:12.323,000 --> 0:11:13,000
I get it, it's frustrating.

271
0:11:14.072,000 --> 0:11:17,000
If you want to test a statistic that comes from a private company,

272
0:11:17.211,000 --> 0:11:2,000
you can buy the face cream for you and a bunch of friends, test it out,

273
0:11:20.596,000 --> 0:11:22,000
if it doesn't work, you can say the numbers were wrong.

274
0:11:23.211,000 --> 0:11:25,000
But how do you question government statistics?

275
0:11:25.381,000 --> 0:11:26,000
You just keep checking everything.

276
0:11:27.035,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Find out how they collected the numbers.

277
0:11:28.972,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Find out if you're seeing everything on the chart you need to see.

278
0:11:32.121,000 --> 0:11:34,000
But don't give up on the numbers altogether, because if you do,

279
0:11:35.11,000 --> 0:11:37,000
we'll be making public policy decisions in the dark,

280
0:11:37.573,000 --> 0:11:39,000
using nothing but private interests to guide us.

281
0:11:39.859,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Thank you.

282
0:11:41.049,000 --> 0:11:43,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.765,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Well, you know, sometimes

2
0:00:14.276,000 --> 0:00:16,000
the most important things come in the smallest packages.

3
0:00:17.258,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I am going to try to convince you, in the 15 minutes I have,

4
0:00:20.847,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that microbes have a lot to say about questions such as,

5
0:00:25.1,000 --> 0:00:26,000
"Are we alone?"

6
0:00:26.998,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and they can tell us more about not only life in our solar system

7
0:00:32.223,000 --> 0:00:33,000
but also maybe beyond,

8
0:00:34.1,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and this is why I am tracking them down in the most impossible places on Earth,

9
0:00:39.397,000 --> 0:00:41,000
in extreme environments where conditions

10
0:00:41.766,000 --> 0:00:43,000
are really pushing them to the brink of survival.

11
0:00:44.45,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Actually, sometimes me too, when I'm trying to follow them too close.

12
0:00:47.704,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But here's the thing:

13
0:00:49.521,000 --> 0:00:54,000
We are the only advanced civilization in the solar system,

14
0:00:55.134,000 --> 0:00:58,000
but that doesn't mean that there is no microbial life nearby.

15
0:00:58.878,000 --> 0:01:01,000
In fact, the planets and moons you see here

16
0:01:02.663,000 --> 0:01:05,000
could host life -- all of them -- and we know that,

17
0:01:06.633,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and it's a strong possibility.

18
0:01:09.482,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And if we were going to find life on those moons and planets,

19
0:01:14.135,000 --> 0:01:17,000
then we would answer questions such as,

20
0:01:17.151,000 --> 0:01:19,000
are we alone in the solar system?

21
0:01:19.287,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Where are we coming from?

22
0:01:21.256,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Do we have family in the neighborhood?

23
0:01:24.233,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Is there life beyond our solar system?

24
0:01:28.157,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And we can ask all those questions because there has been a revolution

25
0:01:32.244,000 --> 0:01:36,000
in our understanding of what a habitable planet is,

26
0:01:36.52,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and today, a habitable planet is a planet

27
0:01:39.86,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that has a zone where water can stay stable,

28
0:01:44.193,000 --> 0:01:47,000
but to me this is a horizontal definition of habitability,

29
0:01:47.922,000 --> 0:01:49,000
because it involves a distance to a star,

30
0:01:50.197,000 --> 0:01:52,000
but there is another dimension to habitability,

31
0:01:53.169,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and this is a vertical dimension.

32
0:01:55.84,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Think of it as

33
0:01:59.527,000 --> 0:02:05,000
conditions in the subsurface of a planet where you are very far away from a sun,

34
0:02:06.21,000 --> 0:02:09,000
but you still have water, energy, nutrients,

35
0:02:09.353,000 --> 0:02:1,000
which for some of them means food,

36
0:02:11.304,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and a protection.

37
0:02:13.207,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And when you look at the Earth,

38
0:02:15.251,000 --> 0:02:19,000
very far away from any sunlight, deep in the ocean,

39
0:02:19.796,000 --> 0:02:2,000
you have life thriving

40
0:02:21.665,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and it uses only chemistry for life processes.

41
0:02:25.676,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So when you think of it at that point, all walls collapse.

42
0:02:31.326,000 --> 0:02:33,000
You have no limitations, basically.

43
0:02:33.6,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And if you have been looking at the headlines lately,

44
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
then you will see that we have discovered a subsurface ocean

45
0:02:39.12,000 --> 0:02:42,000
on Europa, on Ganymede, on Enceladus, on Titan,

46
0:02:42.989,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and now we are finding a geyser and hot springs on Enceladus,

47
0:02:45.923,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Our solar system is turning into a giant spa.

48
0:02:49.978,000 --> 0:02:52,000
For anybody who has gone to a spa knows how much microbes like that, right?

49
0:02:53.864,000 --> 0:02:54,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:55.582,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So at that point, think also about Mars.

51
0:02:59.111,000 --> 0:03:02,000
There is no life possible at the surface of Mars today,

52
0:03:02.478,000 --> 0:03:05,000
but it might still be hiding underground.

53
0:03:05.729,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So, we have been making progress in our understanding of habitability,

54
0:03:11.339,000 --> 0:03:13,000
but we also have been making progress in our understanding

55
0:03:14.111,000 --> 0:03:17,000
of what the signatures of life are on Earth.

56
0:03:17.687,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And you can have what we call organic molecules,

57
0:03:20.543,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and these are the bricks of life,

58
0:03:22.47,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and you can have fossils,

59
0:03:24.35,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and you can minerals, biominerals,

60
0:03:27.253,000 --> 0:03:3,000
which is due to the reaction between bacteria and rocks,

61
0:03:30.643,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and of course you can have gases in the atmosphere.

62
0:03:33.777,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And when you look at those tiny green algae

63
0:03:35.983,000 --> 0:03:36,000
on the right of the slide here,

64
0:03:37.934,000 --> 0:03:4,000
they are the direct descendants of those who have been pumping oxygen

65
0:03:41.45,000 --> 0:03:43,000
a billion years ago in the atmosphere of the Earth.

66
0:03:43.843,000 --> 0:03:45,000
When they did that, they poisoned 90 percent of the life

67
0:03:46.465,000 --> 0:03:47,000
at the surface of the Earth,

68
0:03:47.987,000 --> 0:03:5,000
but they are the reason why you are breathing this air today.

69
0:03:52.74,000 --> 0:03:57,000
But as much as our understanding grows of all of these things,

70
0:03:57.925,000 --> 0:03:59,000
there is one question we still cannot answer,

71
0:04:00.851,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and this is, where are we coming from?

72
0:04:03.126,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And you know, it's getting worse,

73
0:04:04.844,000 --> 0:04:07,000
because we won't be able to find the physical evidence

74
0:04:07.886,000 --> 0:04:09,000
of where we are coming from on this planet,

75
0:04:10.44,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and the reason being is that anything that is older than four billion years is gone.

76
0:04:16.13,000 --> 0:04:17,000
All record is gone,

77
0:04:17.754,000 --> 0:04:2,000
erased by plate tectonics and erosion.

78
0:04:21.632,000 --> 0:04:24,000
This is what I call the Earth's biological horizon.

79
0:04:25.184,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Beyond this horizon we don't know where we are coming from.

80
0:04:28.667,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So is everything lost? Well, maybe not.

81
0:04:31.593,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And we might be able to find evidence of our own origin

82
0:04:35.308,000 --> 0:04:38,000
in the most unlikely place, and this place in Mars.

83
0:04:39.929,000 --> 0:04:4,000
How is this possible?

84
0:04:41.42,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Well clearly at the beginning of the solar system,

85
0:04:44.201,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Mars and the Earth were bombarded by giant asteroids and comets,

86
0:04:49.169,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and there were ejecta from these impacts all over the place.

87
0:04:52.327,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Earth and Mars kept throwing rocks at each other for a very long time.

88
0:04:56.187,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Pieces of rocks landed on the Earth.

89
0:04:58.23,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Pieces of the Earth landed on Mars.

90
0:05:00.181,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So clearly, those two planets may have been seeded by the same material.

91
0:05:05.359,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So yeah, maybe Granddady is sitting there on the surface and waiting for us.

92
0:05:10.659,000 --> 0:05:17,000
But that also means that we can go to Mars and try to find traces of our own origin.

93
0:05:18.19,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Mars may hold that secret for us.

94
0:05:20.442,000 --> 0:05:22,000
This is why Mars is so special to us.

95
0:05:23.15,000 --> 0:05:25,000
But for that to happen,

96
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Mars needed to be habitable at the time when conditions were right.

97
0:05:30.544,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So was Mars habitable?

98
0:05:32.4,000 --> 0:05:35,000
We have a number of missions telling us exactly the same thing today.

99
0:05:36.254,000 --> 0:05:39,000
At the time when life appeared on the Earth,

100
0:05:39.992,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Mars did have an ocean, it had volcanoes, it had lakes,

101
0:05:44.83,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and it had deltas like the beautiful picture you see here.

102
0:05:47.673,000 --> 0:05:5,000
This picture was sent by the Curiosity rover only a few weeks ago.

103
0:05:51.46,000 --> 0:05:54,000
It shows the remnants of a delta, and this picture tells us something:

104
0:05:55.142,000 --> 0:05:56,000
water was abundant

105
0:05:57.096,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and stayed founting at the surface for a very long time.

106
0:05:59.757,000 --> 0:06:,000
This is good news for life.

107
0:06:01.568,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Life chemistry takes a long time to actually happen.

108
0:06:04.99,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So this is extremely good news,

109
0:06:06.507,000 --> 0:06:09,000
but does that mean that if we go there, life will be easy to find on Mars?

110
0:06:10.127,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Not necessarily.

111
0:06:12.01,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Here's what happened:

112
0:06:13.861,000 --> 0:06:16,000
At the time when life exploded at the surface of the Earth,

113
0:06:17.23,000 --> 0:06:19,000
then everything went south for Mars,

114
0:06:19.369,000 --> 0:06:2,000
literally.

115
0:06:20.901,000 --> 0:06:23,000
The atmosphere was stripped away by solar winds,

116
0:06:24.472,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Mars lost its magnetosphere,

117
0:06:26.775,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and then cosmic rays and U.V. bombarded the surface

118
0:06:31.187,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and water escaped to space and went underground.

119
0:06:35.41,000 --> 0:06:38,000
So if we want to be able to understand,

120
0:06:38.501,000 --> 0:06:42,000
if we want to be able to find those traces of the signatures of life

121
0:06:43.43,000 --> 0:06:45,000
at the surface of Mars, if they are there,

122
0:06:45.644,000 --> 0:06:48,000
we need to understand what was the impact of each of these events

123
0:06:48.831,000 --> 0:06:51,000
on the preservation of its record.

124
0:06:52.484,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Only then will we be able to know where those signatures are hiding,

125
0:06:57.314,000 --> 0:07:,000
and only then will we be able to send our rover to the right places

126
0:07:00.997,000 --> 0:07:03,000
where we can sample those rocks that may be telling us something

127
0:07:04.146,000 --> 0:07:06,000
really important about who we are,

128
0:07:06.862,000 --> 0:07:1,000
or, if not, maybe telling us that somewhere, independently,

129
0:07:10.972,000 --> 0:07:12,000
life has appeared on another planet.

130
0:07:13.828,000 --> 0:07:15,000
So to do that, it's easy.

131
0:07:16.336,000 --> 0:07:19,000
You only need to go back 3.5 billion years ago

132
0:07:19.894,000 --> 0:07:21,000
in the past of a planet.

133
0:07:22.285,000 --> 0:07:24,000
We just need a time machine.

134
0:07:24.909,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Easy, right?

135
0:07:27.103,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Well, actually, it is.

136
0:07:28.673,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Look around you -- that's planet Earth.

137
0:07:30.574,000 --> 0:07:32,000
This is our time machine.

138
0:07:32.618,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Geologists are using it to go back in the past of our own planet.

139
0:07:36.788,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I am using it a little bit differently.

140
0:07:38.971,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I use planet Earth to go in very extreme environments

141
0:07:41.966,000 --> 0:07:43,000
where conditions were similar to those of Mars

142
0:07:44.868,000 --> 0:07:45,000
at the time when the climate changed,

143
0:07:46.865,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and there I'm trying to understand what happened.

144
0:07:49.745,000 --> 0:07:5,000
What are the signatures of life?

145
0:07:51.439,000 --> 0:07:53,000
What is left? How are we going to find it?

146
0:07:54.272,000 --> 0:07:57,000
So for one moment now I'm going to take you with me

147
0:07:57.276,000 --> 0:07:59,000
on a trip into that time machine.

148
0:08:00.13,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And now, what you see here, we are at 4,500 meters in the Andes,

149
0:08:04.865,000 --> 0:08:1,000
but in fact we are less than a billion years after the Earth and Mars formed.

150
0:08:11.594,000 --> 0:08:14,000
The Earth and Mars will have looked pretty much exactly like that --

151
0:08:15.285,000 --> 0:08:18,000
volcanoes everywhere, evaporating lakes everywhere,

152
0:08:18.796,000 --> 0:08:21,000
minerals, hot springs,

153
0:08:22.103,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and then you see those mounds on the shore of those lakes?

154
0:08:25.934,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Those are built by the descendants of the first organisms

155
0:08:29.394,000 --> 0:08:32,000
that gave us the first fossil on Earth.

156
0:08:32.496,000 --> 0:08:36,000
But if we want to understand what's going on, we need to go a little further.

157
0:08:36.555,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And the other thing about those sites

158
0:08:38.47,000 --> 0:08:41,000
is that exactly like on Mars three and a half billion years ago,

159
0:08:41.946,000 --> 0:08:45,000
the climate is changing very fast, and water and ice are disappearing.

160
0:08:46.463,000 --> 0:08:49,000
But we need to go back to that time when everything changed on Mars,

161
0:08:49.678,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and to do that, we need to go higher.

162
0:08:52.441,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Why is that?

163
0:08:53.858,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Because when you go higher,

164
0:08:55.215,000 --> 0:08:58,000
the atmosphere is getting thinner, it's getting more unstable,

165
0:08:58.337,000 --> 0:09:03,000
the temperature is getting cooler, and you have a lot more U.V. radiation.

166
0:09:03.648,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Basically,

167
0:09:04.457,000 --> 0:09:08,000
you are getting to those conditions on Mars when everything changed.

168
0:09:10.34,000 --> 0:09:16,000
So I was not promising anything about a leisurely trip on the time machine.

169
0:09:16.837,000 --> 0:09:18,000
You are not going to be sitting in that time machine.

170
0:09:19.371,000 --> 0:09:22,000
You have to haul 1,000 pounds of equipment to the summit

171
0:09:22.399,000 --> 0:09:25,000
of this 20,000-foot volcano in the Andes here.

172
0:09:26.184,000 --> 0:09:28,000
That's about 6,000 meters.

173
0:09:28.784,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And you also have to sleep on 42-degree slopes

174
0:09:32.407,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and really hope that there won't be any earthquake that night.

175
0:09:35.518,000 --> 0:09:39,000
But when we get to the summit, we actually find the lake we came for.

176
0:09:40.464,000 --> 0:09:44,000
At this altitude, this lake is experiencing exactly the same conditions

177
0:09:45.126,000 --> 0:09:48,000
as those on Mars three and a half billion years ago.

178
0:09:48.245,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And now we have to change our voyage

179
0:09:51.17,000 --> 0:09:53,000
into an inner voyage inside that lake,

180
0:09:53.89,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and to do that, we have to remove our mountain gear

181
0:09:57.541,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and actually don suits and go for it.

182
0:10:02.277,000 --> 0:10:06,000
But at the time we enter that lake, at the very moment we enter that lake,

183
0:10:06.452,000 --> 0:10:07,000
we are stepping back

184
0:10:08.38,000 --> 0:10:11,000
three and a half billion years in the past of another planet,

185
0:10:11.561,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and then we are going to get the answer came for.

186
0:10:16.511,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Life is everywhere, absolutely everywhere.

187
0:10:19.633,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Everything you see in this picture is a living organism.

188
0:10:22.953,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Maybe not so the diver, but everything else.

189
0:10:27.626,000 --> 0:10:3,000
But this picture is very deceiving.

190
0:10:30.853,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Life is abundant in those lakes,

191
0:10:33.523,000 --> 0:10:37,000
but like in many places on Earth right now and due to climate change,

192
0:10:37.63,000 --> 0:10:39,000
there is a huge loss in biodiversity.

193
0:10:40.744,000 --> 0:10:42,000
In the samples that we took back home,

194
0:10:43.74,000 --> 0:10:48,000
36 percent of the bacteria in those lakes were composed of three species,

195
0:10:49.556,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and those three species are the ones that have survived so far.

196
0:10:53.375,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Here's another lake, right next to the first one.

197
0:10:56.162,000 --> 0:10:59,000
The red color you see here is not due to minerals.

198
0:10:59.83,000 --> 0:11:02,000
It's actually due to the presence of a tiny algae.

199
0:11:03.151,000 --> 0:11:07,000
In this region, the U.V. radiation is really nasty.

200
0:11:07.66,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Anywhere on Earth, 11 is considered to be extreme.

201
0:11:11.129,000 --> 0:11:15,000
During U.V. storms there, the U.V. Index reaches 43.

202
0:11:15.73,000 --> 0:11:19,000
SPF 30 is not going to do anything to you over there,

203
0:11:19.976,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and the water is so transparent in those lakes

204
0:11:23.342,000 --> 0:11:26,000
that the algae has nowhere to hide, really,

205
0:11:26.675,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and so they are developing their own sunscreen,

206
0:11:28.965,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and this is the red color you see.

207
0:11:30.749,000 --> 0:11:32,000
But they can adapt only so far,

208
0:11:33.31,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and then when all the water is gone from the surface,

209
0:11:35.788,000 --> 0:11:37,000
microbes have only one solution left:

210
0:11:38.388,000 --> 0:11:39,000
They go underground.

211
0:11:40.246,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And those microbes, the rocks you see in that slide here,

212
0:11:43.171,000 --> 0:11:46,000
well, they are actually living inside rocks

213
0:11:46.391,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and they are using the protection of the translucence of the rocks

214
0:11:49.585,000 --> 0:11:5,000
to get the good part of the U.V.

215
0:11:51.382,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and discard the part that could actually damage their DNA.

216
0:11:55.126,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And this is why we are taking our rover

217
0:11:57.401,000 --> 0:12:,000
to train them to search for life on Mars in these areas,

218
0:12:00.977,000 --> 0:12:03,000
because if there was life on Mars three and a half billion years ago,

219
0:12:04.714,000 --> 0:12:08,000
it had to use the same strategy to actually protect itself.

220
0:12:09.864,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Now, it is pretty obvious

221
0:12:12.242,000 --> 0:12:15,000
that going to extreme environments is helping us very much

222
0:12:15.77,000 --> 0:12:18,000
for the exploration of Mars and to prepare missions.

223
0:12:19.761,000 --> 0:12:23,000
So far, it has helped us to understand the geology of Mars.

224
0:12:24.1,000 --> 0:12:28,000
It has helped to understand the past climate of Mars and its evolution,

225
0:12:28.221,000 --> 0:12:3,000
but also its habitability potential.

226
0:12:31.208,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Our most recent rover on Mars has discovered traces of organics.

227
0:12:36.747,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Yeah, there are organics at the surface of Mars.

228
0:12:39.706,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And it also discovered traces of methane.

229
0:12:43.607,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And we don't know yet if the methane in question

230
0:12:46.152,000 --> 0:12:49,000
is really from geology or biology.

231
0:12:49.99,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Regardless, what we know is that because of the discovery,

232
0:12:54.859,000 --> 0:12:57,000
the hypothesis that there is still life present on Mars today

233
0:12:58.1,000 --> 0:13:,000
remains a viable one.

234
0:13:00.455,000 --> 0:13:05,000
So by now, I think I have convinced you that Mars is very special to us,

235
0:13:05.652,000 --> 0:13:07,000
but it would be a mistake to think that Mars is the only place

236
0:13:08.628,000 --> 0:13:12,000
in the solar system that is interesting to find potential microbial life.

237
0:13:14.434,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And the reason is because Mars and the Earth

238
0:13:18.352,000 --> 0:13:2,000
could have a common root to their tree of life,

239
0:13:21.143,000 --> 0:13:25,000
but when you go beyond Mars, it's not that easy.

240
0:13:25.29,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Celestial mechanics is not making it so easy

241
0:13:27.9,000 --> 0:13:29,000
for an exchange of material between planets,

242
0:13:30.315,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and so if we were to discover life on those planets,

243
0:13:34.355,000 --> 0:13:35,000
it would be different from us.

244
0:13:36.212,000 --> 0:13:37,000
It would be a different type of life.

245
0:13:38.05,000 --> 0:13:4,000
But in the end, it might be just us,

246
0:13:40.903,000 --> 0:13:41,000
it might be us and Mars,

247
0:13:42.899,000 --> 0:13:45,000
or it can be many trees of life in the solar system.

248
0:13:46.382,000 --> 0:13:49,000
I don't know the answer yet, but I can tell you something:

249
0:13:50.11,000 --> 0:13:54,000
No matter what the result is, no matter what that magic number is,

250
0:13:54.542,000 --> 0:13:56,000
it is going to give us a standard

251
0:13:56.553,000 --> 0:14:,000
by which we are going to be able to measure the life potential,

252
0:14:01.081,000 --> 0:14:04,000
abundance and diversity beyond our own solar system.

253
0:14:04.191,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And this can be achieved by our generation.

254
0:14:06.751,000 --> 0:14:09,000
This can be our legacy, but only if we dare to explore.

255
0:14:11.654,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Now, finally,

256
0:14:13.74,000 --> 0:14:16,000
if somebody tells you that looking for alien microbes is not cool

257
0:14:17.708,000 --> 0:14:2,000
because you cannot have a philosophical conversation with them,

258
0:14:21.138,000 --> 0:14:26,000
let me show you why and how you can tell them they're wrong.

259
0:14:27.804,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Well, organic material is going to tell you

260
0:14:30.572,000 --> 0:14:35,000
about environment, about complexity and about diversity.

261
0:14:36.231,000 --> 0:14:42,000
DNA, or any information carrier, is going to tell you about adaptation,

262
0:14:42.35,000 --> 0:14:47,000
about evolution, about survival, about planetary changes

263
0:14:47.371,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and about the transfer of information.

264
0:14:50.219,000 --> 0:14:53,000
All together, they are telling us

265
0:14:53.307,000 --> 0:14:56,000
what started as a microbial pathway,

266
0:14:57.208,000 --> 0:15:,000
and why what started as a microbial pathway

267
0:15:00.226,000 --> 0:15:03,000
sometimes ends up as a civilization

268
0:15:03.686,000 --> 0:15:06,000
or sometimes ends up as a dead end.

269
0:15:07.308,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Look at the solar system, and look at the Earth.

270
0:15:10.724,000 --> 0:15:12,000
On Earth, there are many intelligent species,

271
0:15:13.531,000 --> 0:15:16,000
but only one has achieved technology.

272
0:15:16.898,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Right here in the journey of our own solar system,

273
0:15:20.195,000 --> 0:15:22,000
there is a very, very powerful message

274
0:15:22.934,000 --> 0:15:27,000
that says here's how we should look for alien life, small and big.

275
0:15:28.32,000 --> 0:15:31,000
So yeah, microbes are talking and we are listening,

276
0:15:31.618,000 --> 0:15:32,000
and they are taking us,

277
0:15:33.337,000 --> 0:15:35,000
one planet at a time and one moon at a time,

278
0:15:35.891,000 --> 0:15:37,000
towards their big brothers out there.

279
0:15:38.77,000 --> 0:15:4,000
And they are telling us about diversity,

280
0:15:41.486,000 --> 0:15:43,000
they are telling us about abundance of life,

281
0:15:44.11,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and they are telling us how this life has survived thus far

282
0:15:48.15,000 --> 0:15:51,000
to reach civilization,

283
0:15:51.192,000 --> 0:15:55,000
intelligence, technology and, indeed, philosophy.

284
0:15:56.174,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Thank you.

285
0:15:57.879,000 --> 0:16:,000
(Applause)

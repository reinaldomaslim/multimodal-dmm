1
0:00:12.269,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So recently,

2
0:00:14.374,000 --> 0:00:16,000
some white guys and some black women

3
0:00:17.176,000 --> 0:00:19,000
swapped Twitter avatars, or pictures online.

4
0:00:19.808,000 --> 0:00:2,000
They didn't change their content,

5
0:00:21.093,000 --> 0:00:22,000
they kept tweeting the same as usual,

6
0:00:22.904,000 --> 0:00:24,000
but suddenly, the white guys noticed

7
0:00:25.702,000 --> 0:00:26,000
they were getting called the n-word all the time

8
0:00:27.603,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and they were getting the worst kind of online abuse,

9
0:00:30.331,000 --> 0:00:32,000
whereas the black women all of a sudden

10
0:00:32.891,000 --> 0:00:35,000
noticed things got a lot more pleasant for them.

11
0:00:35.962,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Now, if you're my five-year-old,

12
0:00:37.897,000 --> 0:00:4,000
your Internet consists mostly of puppies and fairies

13
0:00:41.13,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and occasionally fairies riding puppies.

14
0:00:43.285,000 --> 0:00:45,000
That's a thing. Google it.

15
0:00:46.03,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But the rest of us know that the Internet

16
0:00:48.324,000 --> 0:00:5,000
can be a really ugly place.

17
0:00:51.182,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I'm not talking about the kind of colorful debates

18
0:00:54.157,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that I think are healthy for our democracy.

19
0:00:56.445,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I'm talking about nasty personal attacks.

20
0:00:59.823,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Maybe it's happened to you, but it's at least

21
0:01:01.947,000 --> 0:01:03,000
twice as likely to happen, and be worse,

22
0:01:04.738,000 --> 0:01:06,000
if you're a woman, a person of color, or gay,

23
0:01:06.741,000 --> 0:01:07,000
or more than one at the same time.

24
0:01:08.675,000 --> 0:01:1,000
In fact, just as I was writing this talk,

25
0:01:11.364,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I found a Twitter account called @SallyKohnSucks.

26
0:01:16.343,000 --> 0:01:18,000
The bio says that I'm a

27
0:01:19.215,000 --> 0:01:22,000
"man-hater and a bull dyke and the only thing I've ever accomplished with my career

28
0:01:22.724,000 --> 0:01:24,000
is spreading my perverse sexuality."

29
0:01:25.289,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Which, incidentally, is only a third correct.

30
0:01:27.466,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I mean, lies! (Laughter)

31
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
But seriously, we all say we hate this crap.

32
0:01:35.113,000 --> 0:01:36,000
The question is whether you're willing to make

33
0:01:36.93,000 --> 0:01:39,000
a personal sacrifice to change it.

34
0:01:40.118,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I don't mean giving up the Internet.

35
0:01:41.98,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I mean changing the way you click,

36
0:01:44.182,000 --> 0:01:46,000
because clicking is a public act.

37
0:01:47.037,000 --> 0:01:48,000
It's no longer the case

38
0:01:48.71,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that a few powerful elites control all the media

39
0:01:51.121,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and the rest of us are just passive receivers.

40
0:01:53.36,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Increasingly, we're all the media.

41
0:01:56.172,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I used to think, oh, okay, I get dressed up,

42
0:01:59.332,000 --> 0:02:,000
I put on a lot of makeup,

43
0:02:01.238,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I go on television, I talk about the news.

44
0:02:03.116,000 --> 0:02:06,000
That is a public act of making media.

45
0:02:06.457,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And then I go home and I browse the web

46
0:02:08.516,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and I'm reading Twitter,

47
0:02:09.652,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and that's a private act of consuming media.

48
0:02:11.769,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I mean, of course it is. I'm in my pajamas.

49
0:02:14.326,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Wrong.

50
0:02:16.152,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Everything we blog, everything we Tweet,

51
0:02:18.266,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and everything we click

52
0:02:21.621,000 --> 0:02:24,000
is a public act of making media.

53
0:02:24.937,000 --> 0:02:25,000
We are the new editors.

54
0:02:26.481,000 --> 0:02:27,000
We decide what gets attention

55
0:02:28.313,000 --> 0:02:3,000
based on what we give our attention to.

56
0:02:31.11,000 --> 0:02:32,000
That's how the media works now.

57
0:02:32.457,000 --> 0:02:34,000
There's all these hidden algorithms that decide

58
0:02:34.87,000 --> 0:02:36,000
what you see more of and what we all see more of

59
0:02:37.133,000 --> 0:02:38,000
based on what you click on,

60
0:02:38.89,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and that in turn shapes our whole culture.

61
0:02:42.956,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Over three out of five Americans think we have

62
0:02:44.911,000 --> 0:02:47,000
a major incivility problem in our country right now,

63
0:02:48.901,000 --> 0:02:49,000
but I'm going to guess that at least three out of five

64
0:02:50.635,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Americans are clicking on the same insult-oriented,

65
0:02:54.655,000 --> 0:02:56,000
rumor-mongering trash that feeds

66
0:02:56.803,000 --> 0:02:59,000
the nastiest impulses in our society.

67
0:02:59.86,000 --> 0:03:02,000
In an increasingly noisy media landscape,

68
0:03:03.833,000 --> 0:03:06,000
the incentive is to make more noise to be heard,

69
0:03:07.213,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and that tyranny of the loud

70
0:03:10.14,000 --> 0:03:13,000
encourages the tyranny of the nasty.

71
0:03:13.477,000 --> 0:03:15,000
It does not have to be that way.

72
0:03:16.395,000 --> 0:03:17,000
It does not.

73
0:03:17.957,000 --> 0:03:19,000
We can change the incentive.

74
0:03:20.832,000 --> 0:03:21,000
For starters, there are two things we can all do.

75
0:03:22.452,000 --> 0:03:25,000
First, don't just stand by the sidelines when you see someone getting hurt.

76
0:03:26.385,000 --> 0:03:29,000
If someone is being abused online, do something.

77
0:03:30.065,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Be a hero. This is your chance.

78
0:03:32.194,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Speak up. Speak out. Be a good person.

79
0:03:34.545,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Drown out the negative with the positive.

80
0:03:36.841,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And second, we've got to stop clicking

81
0:03:40.23,000 --> 0:03:42,000
on the lowest-common-denominator, bottom-feeding

82
0:03:42.633,000 --> 0:03:43,000
linkbait.

83
0:03:43.999,000 --> 0:03:46,000
If you don't like the 24/7 all Kardashian

84
0:03:47.571,000 --> 0:03:48,000
all the time programming,

85
0:03:49.253,000 --> 0:03:5,000
you've got to stop clicking on the stories

86
0:03:51.127,000 --> 0:03:54,000
about Kim Kardashian's sideboob.

87
0:03:55.07,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I know you do it. (Applause)

88
0:03:57.874,000 --> 0:03:58,000
You too, apparently.

89
0:03:59.814,000 --> 0:04:,000
I mean, really, same example:

90
0:04:00.939,000 --> 0:04:02,000
if you don't like politicians calling each other names,

91
0:04:03.436,000 --> 0:04:04,000
stop clicking on the stories

92
0:04:05.147,000 --> 0:04:08,000
about what one guy in one party called the other guy in the other party.

93
0:04:08.207,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Clicking on a train wreck just pours gasoline on it.

94
0:04:10.998,000 --> 0:04:11,000
It makes it worse, the fire spreads.

95
0:04:12.92,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Our whole culture gets burned.

96
0:04:16.917,000 --> 0:04:19,000
If what gets the most clicks wins,

97
0:04:20.05,000 --> 0:04:22,000
then we have to start shaping the world we want

98
0:04:22.921,000 --> 0:04:23,000
with our clicks,

99
0:04:24.89,000 --> 0:04:27,000
because clicking is a public act.

100
0:04:28.776,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So click responsibly. Thank you.

101
0:04:31.256,000 --> 0:04:35,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:25.031,000 --> 0:00:28,000
This is really a two-hour presentation I give to high school students,

2
0:00:28.345,000 --> 0:00:29,000
cut down to three minutes.

3
0:00:29.62,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And it all started one day on a plane, on my way to TED,

4
0:00:32.285,000 --> 0:00:33,000
seven years ago.

5
0:00:33.603,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And in the seat next to me was a high school student, a teenager,

6
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and she came from a really poor family.

7
0:00:40.483,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And she wanted to make something of her life,

8
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and she asked me a simple little question.

9
0:00:45.063,000 --> 0:00:46,000
She said, "What leads to success?"

10
0:00:47.032,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And I felt really badly,

11
0:00:48.435,000 --> 0:00:5,000
because I couldn't give her a good answer.

12
0:00:50.92,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So I get off the plane, and I come to TED.

13
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And I think, jeez, I'm in the middle of a room of successful people!

14
0:00:56.754,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So why don't I ask them what helped them succeed,

15
0:00:59.389,000 --> 0:01:,000
and pass it on to kids?

16
0:01:01.817,000 --> 0:01:04,000
So here we are, seven years, 500 interviews later,

17
0:01:05.45,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and I'm going to tell you what really leads to success

18
0:01:08.414,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and makes TEDsters tick.

19
0:01:10.367,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And the first thing is passion.

20
0:01:12.787,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Freeman Thomas says, "I'm driven by my passion."

21
0:01:15.763,000 --> 0:01:17,000
TEDsters do it for love; they don't do it for money.

22
0:01:18.247,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Carol Coletta says, "I would pay someone to do what I do."

23
0:01:21.755,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And the interesting thing is:

24
0:01:23.19,000 --> 0:01:25,000
if you do it for love, the money comes anyway.

25
0:01:25.866,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Work! Rupert Murdoch said to me, "It's all hard work.

26
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Nothing comes easily. But I have a lot of fun."

27
0:01:32.107,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Did he say fun? Rupert? Yes!

28
0:01:35.001,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:36.501,000 --> 0:01:38,000
TEDsters do have fun working. And they work hard.

30
0:01:39.271,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I figured, they're not workaholics. They're workafrolics.

31
0:01:42.248,000 --> 0:01:43,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:43.862,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Good!

33
0:01:44.943,000 --> 0:01:45,000
(Applause)

34
0:01:45.968,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Alex Garden says, "To be successful, put your nose down in something

35
0:01:49.338,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and get damn good at it."

36
0:01:50.608,000 --> 0:01:52,000
There's no magic; it's practice, practice, practice.

37
0:01:53.474,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And it's focus.

38
0:01:54.517,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Norman Jewison said to me,

39
0:01:56.275,000 --> 0:01:58,000
"I think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing."

40
0:01:59.773,000 --> 0:02:,000
And push!

41
0:02:01.235,000 --> 0:02:02,000
David Gallo says, "Push yourself.

42
0:02:03.247,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Physically, mentally, you've got to push, push, push."

43
0:02:05.913,000 --> 0:02:07,000
You've got to push through shyness and self-doubt.

44
0:02:08.548,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Goldie Hawn says, "I always had self-doubts.

45
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I wasn't good enough; I wasn't smart enough.

46
0:02:13.12,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I didn't think I'd make it."

47
0:02:15.264,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Now it's not always easy to push yourself,

48
0:02:17.327,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and that's why they invented mothers.

49
0:02:19.439,000 --> 0:02:2,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:20.439,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Applause)

51
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Frank Gehry said to me,

52
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:26,000
"My mother pushed me."

53
0:02:26.394,000 --> 0:02:27,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:27.632,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Serve!

55
0:02:29.427,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Sherwin Nuland says, "It was a privilege to serve as a doctor."

56
0:02:33.093,000 --> 0:02:35,000
A lot of kids want to be millionaires.

57
0:02:35.227,000 --> 0:02:36,000
The first thing I say is:

58
0:02:36.501,000 --> 0:02:37,000
"OK, well you can't serve yourself;

59
0:02:38.427,000 --> 0:02:4,000
you've got to serve others something of value.

60
0:02:40.688,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Because that's the way people really get rich."

61
0:02:44.074,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Ideas!

62
0:02:45.123,000 --> 0:02:47,000
TEDster Bill Gates says, "I had an idea:

63
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:5,000
founding the first micro-computer software company."

64
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I'd say it was a pretty good idea.

65
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And there's no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas --

66
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:58,000
it's just doing some very simple things.

67
0:02:58.359,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And I give lots of evidence.

68
0:03:00.291,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Persist!

69
0:03:01.799,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Joe Kraus says,

70
0:03:02.824,000 --> 0:03:04,000
"Persistence is the number one reason for our success."

71
0:03:05.832,000 --> 0:03:08,000
You've got to persist through failure. You've got to persist through crap!

72
0:03:09.398,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Which of course means "Criticism, Rejection, Assholes and Pressure."

73
0:03:12.937,000 --> 0:03:14,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:15.727,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So, the answer to this question is simple:

75
0:03:19.47,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Pay 4,000 bucks and come to TED.

76
0:03:21.619,000 --> 0:03:22,000
(Laughter)

77
0:03:22.836,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Or failing that, do the eight things -- and trust me,

78
0:03:25.598,000 --> 0:03:28,000
these are the big eight things that lead to success.

79
0:03:28.842,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Thank you TEDsters for all your interviews!

80
0:03:31.585,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Applause)

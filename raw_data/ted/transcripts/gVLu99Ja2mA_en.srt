1
0:00:16.259,000 --> 0:00:22,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:23.101,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Thank you very much.

3
0:00:24.298,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I have a few pictures,

4
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and I'll talk a little bit about how I'm able to do what I do.

5
0:00:30.405,000 --> 0:00:32,000
All these houses are built

6
0:00:32.791,000 --> 0:00:34,000
from between 70 and 80 percent recycled material,

7
0:00:35.664,000 --> 0:00:38,000
stuff that was headed to the mulcher, the landfill, the burn pile.

8
0:00:38.839,000 --> 0:00:39,000
It was all just gone.

9
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
This is the first house I built.

10
0:00:42.572,000 --> 0:00:45,000
This double front door here with the three-light transom,

11
0:00:45.987,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that was headed to the landfill.

12
0:00:48.151,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Have a little turret there.

13
0:00:50.007,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And then these buttons on the corbels here --

14
0:00:54.08,000 --> 0:00:55,000
right there --

15
0:00:55.265,000 --> 0:00:56,000
those are hickory nuts.

16
0:00:56.645,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And these buttons there --

17
0:00:58.776,000 --> 0:00:59,000
those are chicken eggs.

18
0:01:00.127,000 --> 0:01:01,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:01.32,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Of course, first you have breakfast,

20
0:01:03.105,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and then you fill the shell full of Bondo and paint it and nail it up,

21
0:01:07.044,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and you have an architectural button in just a fraction of the time.

22
0:01:11.186,000 --> 0:01:13,000
This is a look at the inside.

23
0:01:13.447,000 --> 0:01:16,000
You can see the three-light transom there with the eyebrow windows.

24
0:01:16.736,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Certainly an architectural antique headed to the landfill --

25
0:01:19.814,000 --> 0:01:21,000
even the lockset is probably worth 200 dollars.

26
0:01:22.998,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Everything in the kitchen was salvaged.

27
0:01:24.909,000 --> 0:01:25,000
There's a 1952 O'Keefe & Merritt stove,

28
0:01:26.93,000 --> 0:01:28,000
if you like to cook -- cool stove.

29
0:01:29.842,000 --> 0:01:3,000
This is going up into the turret.

30
0:01:31.983,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I got that staircase for 20 dollars,

31
0:01:34.931,000 --> 0:01:35,000
including delivery to my lot.

32
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:39.774,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Then, looking up in the turret,

34
0:01:42.1,000 --> 0:01:45,000
you see there are bulges and pokes and sags and so forth.

35
0:01:45.743,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Well, if that ruins your life,

36
0:01:47.409,000 --> 0:01:48,000
well, then, you shouldn't live there.

37
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
(Laughter)

38
0:01:51.161,000 --> 0:01:53,000
This is a laundry chute.

39
0:01:53.984,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And this right here is a shoe last --

40
0:01:56.423,000 --> 0:01:58,000
those are those cast-iron things you see at antique shops.

41
0:01:59.279,000 --> 0:02:,000
So I had one of those,

42
0:02:00.592,000 --> 0:02:03,000
so I made some low-tech gadgetry, where you just stomp on the shoe last,

43
0:02:04.362,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and then the door flies open and you throw your laundry down.

44
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And then if you're smart enough, it goes on a basket on top of the washer.

45
0:02:11.07,000 --> 0:02:13,000
If not, it goes into the toilet.

46
0:02:13.708,000 --> 0:02:15,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:15.781,000 --> 0:02:16,000
This is a bathtub I made,

48
0:02:17.488,000 --> 0:02:19,000
made out of scrap two-by-four.

49
0:02:19.569,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Started with the rim, and then glued and nailed it up into a flat,

50
0:02:23.827,000 --> 0:02:24,000
corbeled it up and flipped it over,

51
0:02:25.545,000 --> 0:02:26,000
then did the two profiles on this side.

52
0:02:27.546,000 --> 0:02:28,000
It's a two-person tub.

53
0:02:29.435,000 --> 0:02:31,000
After all, it's not just a question of hygiene,

54
0:02:32.402,000 --> 0:02:34,000
but there's a possibility of recreation as well.

55
0:02:34.918,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Laughter)

56
0:02:37.711,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Then, this faucet here is just a piece of Osage orange.

57
0:02:43.602,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It looks a little phallic,

58
0:02:45.198,000 --> 0:02:46,000
but after all, it's a bathroom.

59
0:02:46.923,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Laughter)

60
0:02:49.892,000 --> 0:02:5,000
This is a house based on a Budweiser can.

61
0:02:51.889,000 --> 0:02:52,000
It doesn't look like a can of beer,

62
0:02:53.605,000 --> 0:02:55,000
but the design take-offs are absolutely unmistakable:

63
0:02:56.133,000 --> 0:02:58,000
the barley hops design worked up into the eaves,

64
0:02:58.489,000 --> 0:03:01,000
then the dentil work comes directly off the can's red, white, blue and silver.

65
0:03:02.261,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Then, these corbels going down underneath the eaves

66
0:03:04.723,000 --> 0:03:06,000
are that little design that comes off the can.

67
0:03:06.925,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I just put a can on a copier and kept enlarging it

68
0:03:09.568,000 --> 0:03:1,000
until I got the size I want.

69
0:03:11.108,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Then, on the can it says,

70
0:03:13.679,000 --> 0:03:14,000
"This is the famous Budweiser beer,

71
0:03:15.41,000 --> 0:03:17,000
we know of no other beer, blah, blah, blah."

72
0:03:17.492,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So we changed that and put,

73
0:03:18.809,000 --> 0:03:21,000
"This is the famous Budweiser house. We don't know of any other house ..."

74
0:03:22.332,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and so forth and so on.

75
0:03:23.508,000 --> 0:03:24,000
This is a deadbolt.

76
0:03:24.689,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It's a fence from a 1930s shaper, which is a very angry woodworking machine.

77
0:03:28.455,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And they gave me the fence, but they didn't give me the shaper,

78
0:03:31.455,000 --> 0:03:32,000
so we made a deadbolt out of it.

79
0:03:33.15,000 --> 0:03:35,000
That'll keep bull elephants out, I promise.

80
0:03:35.415,000 --> 0:03:36,000
(Laughter)

81
0:03:36.444,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And sure enough, we've had no problems with bull elephants.

82
0:03:39.322,000 --> 0:03:4,000
(Laughter)

83
0:03:40.508,000 --> 0:03:42,000
The shower is intended to simulate a glass of beer.

84
0:03:43.445,000 --> 0:03:46,000
We've got bubbles going up there, then suds at the top with lumpy tiles.

85
0:03:46.94,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Where do you get lumpy tiles? Well, of course, you don't.

86
0:03:49.653,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But I get a lot of toilets, and so you just dispatch a toilet with a hammer,

87
0:03:53.378,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and then you have lumpy tiles.

88
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And then the faucet is a beer tap.

89
0:03:58.807,000 --> 0:04:,000
(Laughter)

90
0:04:01.557,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Then, this panel of glass is the same panel of glass

91
0:04:05.983,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that occurs in every middle-class front door in America.

92
0:04:08.854,000 --> 0:04:1,000
We're getting tired of it. It's kind of clichéd now.

93
0:04:11.386,000 --> 0:04:14,000
If you put it in the front door, your design fails.

94
0:04:14.835,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So don't put it in the front door; put it somewhere else.

95
0:04:17.585,000 --> 0:04:18,000
It's a pretty panel of glass.

96
0:04:19.135,000 --> 0:04:2,000
But if you put it in the front door,

97
0:04:20.9,000 --> 0:04:22,000
people say, "Oh, you're trying to be like those guys,

98
0:04:23.432,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and you didn't make it."

99
0:04:24.607,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So don't put it there.

100
0:04:26.439,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Then, another bathroom upstairs.

101
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
This light up here

102
0:04:29.521,000 --> 0:04:32,000
is the same light that occurs in every middle-class foyer in America.

103
0:04:33.32,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Don't put it in the foyer.

104
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Put it in the shower, or in the closet,

105
0:04:38.021,000 --> 0:04:39,000
but not in the foyer.

106
0:04:41.162,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Then, somebody gave me a bidet, so it got a bidet.

107
0:04:43.872,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Laughter)

108
0:04:46.318,000 --> 0:04:47,000
This little house here,

109
0:04:47.97,000 --> 0:04:5,000
those branches there are made out of Bois d'arc or Osage orange.

110
0:04:51.923,000 --> 0:04:54,000
These pictures will keep scrolling as I talk a little bit.

111
0:04:55.415,000 --> 0:04:57,000
In order to do what I do,

112
0:04:57.705,000 --> 0:05:,000
you have to understand what causes waste in the building industry.

113
0:05:01.484,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Our housing has become a commodity,

114
0:05:04.141,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and I'll talk a little bit about that.

115
0:05:06.458,000 --> 0:05:09,000
But the first cause of waste is probably even buried in our DNA.

116
0:05:09.593,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Human beings have a need for maintaining consistency

117
0:05:12.085,000 --> 0:05:13,000
of the apperceptive mass.

118
0:05:14.042,000 --> 0:05:15,000
What does that mean?

119
0:05:15.217,000 --> 0:05:17,000
What it means is, for every perception we have,

120
0:05:17.523,000 --> 0:05:19,000
it needs to tally with the one like it before,

121
0:05:20.137,000 --> 0:05:23,000
or we don't have continuity, and we become a little bit disoriented.

122
0:05:23.555,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So I can show you an object you've never seen before.

123
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Oh, that's a cell phone.

124
0:05:28.636,000 --> 0:05:3,000
But you've never seen this one before.

125
0:05:31.269,000 --> 0:05:32,000
What you're doing

126
0:05:32.451,000 --> 0:05:35,000
is sizing up the pattern of structural features,

127
0:05:35.475,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and then you go through your databanks:

128
0:05:38.063,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Cell phone. Oh! That's a cell phone.

129
0:05:40.819,000 --> 0:05:42,000
If I took a bite out of it, you'd go,

130
0:05:42.925,000 --> 0:05:43,000
"Wait a second.

131
0:05:44.439,000 --> 0:05:45,000
(Laughter)

132
0:05:45.618,000 --> 0:05:46,000
"That's not a cell phone.

133
0:05:46.991,000 --> 0:05:48,000
That's one of those new chocolate cell phones."

134
0:05:49.915,000 --> 0:05:5,000
(Laughter)

135
0:05:51.653,000 --> 0:05:52,000
You'd have to start a new category,

136
0:05:53.364,000 --> 0:05:55,000
right between cell phones and chocolate.

137
0:05:55.45,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Laughter)

138
0:05:57.285,000 --> 0:05:58,000
That's how we process information.

139
0:05:58.975,000 --> 0:06:,000
You translate that to the building industry.

140
0:06:01.131,000 --> 0:06:04,000
If we have a wall of windowpanes and one pane is cracked, we go,

141
0:06:04.185,000 --> 0:06:06,000
"Oh, dear. That's cracked. Let's repair it.

142
0:06:06.234,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Let's take it out and throw it away so nobody can use it

143
0:06:08.894,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and put a new one in."

144
0:06:10.078,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Because that's what you do with a cracked pane.

145
0:06:12.324,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Never mind that it doesn't affect our lives at all.

146
0:06:14.808,000 --> 0:06:18,000
It only rattles that expected pattern and unity of structural features.

147
0:06:19.616,000 --> 0:06:21,000
However, if we took a small hammer,

148
0:06:22.068,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and we added cracks to all the other windows --

149
0:06:24.658,000 --> 0:06:26,000
(Laughter)

150
0:06:26.683,000 --> 0:06:27,000
then we have a pattern.

151
0:06:27.921,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Because Gestalt psychology emphasizes recognition of pattern

152
0:06:31.012,000 --> 0:06:33,000
over parts that comprise a pattern.

153
0:06:33.067,000 --> 0:06:34,000
We'll go, "Ooh, that's nice."

154
0:06:34.87,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So, that serves me every day.

155
0:06:38.04,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Repetition creates pattern.

156
0:06:39.81,000 --> 0:06:4,000
If I have 100 of these, 100 of those,

157
0:06:41.633,000 --> 0:06:43,000
it makes no difference what these and those are.

158
0:06:43.931,000 --> 0:06:45,000
If I can repeat anything, I have the possibility of a pattern,

159
0:06:46.877,000 --> 0:06:48,000
from hickory nuts and chicken eggs, shards of glass, branches.

160
0:06:49.824,000 --> 0:06:5,000
It doesn't make any difference.

161
0:06:51.362,000 --> 0:06:53,000
That causes a lot of waste in the building industry.

162
0:06:53.914,000 --> 0:06:54,000
The second cause is,

163
0:06:55.089,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Friedrich Nietzsche, along about 1885,

164
0:06:57.014,000 --> 0:06:59,000
wrote a book titled "The Birth of Tragedy."

165
0:06:59.345,000 --> 0:07:,000
And in there,

166
0:07:00.953,000 --> 0:07:03,000
he said cultures tend to swing between one of two perspectives:

167
0:07:03.991,000 --> 0:07:06,000
on the one hand, we have an Apollonian perspective,

168
0:07:07.235,000 --> 0:07:1,000
which is very crisp and premeditated and intellectualized

169
0:07:11.038,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and perfect.

170
0:07:13.741,000 --> 0:07:16,000
On the other end of the spectrum, we have a Dionysian perspective,

171
0:07:16.977,000 --> 0:07:18,000
which is more given to the passions and intuition,

172
0:07:19.384,000 --> 0:07:21,000
tolerant of organic texture and human gesture.

173
0:07:22.187,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So the way the Apollonian personality takes a picture or hangs a picture is,

174
0:07:27.53,000 --> 0:07:28,000
they'll get out a transit

175
0:07:29.43,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and a laser level

176
0:07:31.106,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and a micrometer.

177
0:07:32.81,000 --> 0:07:34,000
"OK, honey. A thousandth of an inch to the left.

178
0:07:35.104,000 --> 0:07:37,000
That's where we want the picture. Right. Perfect!"

179
0:07:37.511,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Predicated on plumb level, square and centered.

180
0:07:40.142,000 --> 0:07:43,000
The Dionysian personality takes the picture and goes:

181
0:07:44.04,000 --> 0:07:49,000
(Laughter)

182
0:07:49.131,000 --> 0:07:5,000
That's the difference.

183
0:07:51.1,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I feature blemish.

184
0:07:52.885,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I feature organic process.

185
0:07:54.965,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Dead center John Dewey.

186
0:07:56.876,000 --> 0:08:,000
Apollonian mindset creates mountains of waste.

187
0:08:01.144,000 --> 0:08:02,000
If something isn't perfect,

188
0:08:02.81,000 --> 0:08:04,000
if it doesn't line up with that premeditated model?

189
0:08:05.664,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Dumpster.

190
0:08:06.839,000 --> 0:08:07,000
"Oops. Scratch. Dumpster."

191
0:08:08.127,000 --> 0:08:1,000
"Oops" this, "oops" that. Landfill, landfill, landfill.

192
0:08:10.778,000 --> 0:08:12,000
The third thing is arguably --

193
0:08:13.909,000 --> 0:08:15,000
The Industrial Revolution started in the Renaissance

194
0:08:16.386,000 --> 0:08:17,000
with the rise of humanism,

195
0:08:17.664,000 --> 0:08:19,000
then got a little jump start along about the French Revolution.

196
0:08:20.653,000 --> 0:08:22,000
By the middle of the 19th century, it's in full flower.

197
0:08:23.305,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And we have dumaflaches and gizmos

198
0:08:25.936,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and contraptions that will do anything

199
0:08:29.205,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that we, up to that point,

200
0:08:31.069,000 --> 0:08:32,000
had to do by hand.

201
0:08:32.844,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So now we have standardized materials.

202
0:08:34.943,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Well, trees don't grow two inches by four inches,

203
0:08:37.825,000 --> 0:08:38,000
eight, ten and twelve feet tall.

204
0:08:39.531,000 --> 0:08:4,000
(Laughter)

205
0:08:40.58,000 --> 0:08:41,000
We create mountains of waste.

206
0:08:42.027,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And they're doing a pretty good job there in the forest,

207
0:08:45.592,000 --> 0:08:47,000
working all the byproduct of their industry --

208
0:08:48.108,000 --> 0:08:5,000
with OSB and particle board and so forth and so on --

209
0:08:50.894,000 --> 0:08:51,000
but it does no good

210
0:08:52.713,000 --> 0:08:55,000
to be responsible at the point of harvest in the forest

211
0:08:55.81,000 --> 0:08:58,000
if consumers are wasting the harvest at the point of consumption.

212
0:08:59.193,000 --> 0:09:,000
And that's what's happening.

213
0:09:01.074,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And so if something isn't standard,

214
0:09:02.81,000 --> 0:09:04,000
"Oops, dumpster." "Oops" this. "Oops, warped."

215
0:09:05.767,000 --> 0:09:07,000
If you buy a two-by-four and it's not straight,

216
0:09:08.02,000 --> 0:09:09,000
you can take it back.

217
0:09:09.304,000 --> 0:09:11,000
"Oh, I'm so sorry, sir. We'll get you a straight one."

218
0:09:11.939,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Well, I feature all those warped things

219
0:09:15.255,000 --> 0:09:16,000
because repetition creates pattern,

220
0:09:17.094,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and it's from a Dionysian perspective.

221
0:09:19.123,000 --> 0:09:2,000
The fourth thing

222
0:09:20.429,000 --> 0:09:23,000
is labor is disproportionately more expensive than materials.

223
0:09:24.179,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Well, that's just a myth.

224
0:09:25.693,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And there's a story:

225
0:09:26.879,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Jim Tulles, one of the guys I trained -- I said, "Jim, it's time now.

226
0:09:30.462,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I got a job for you as a foreman on a framing crew. Time for you to go."

227
0:09:33.901,000 --> 0:09:34,000
"Dan, I just don't think I'm ready."

228
0:09:35.676,000 --> 0:09:37,000
"Jim, now it's time. You're the down -- oh!"

229
0:09:38.666,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So we hired on.

230
0:09:40.041,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And he was out there with a tape measure, going through the trash heap,

231
0:09:43.542,000 --> 0:09:46,000
looking for header material, or the board that goes over a door,

232
0:09:46.666,000 --> 0:09:49,000
thinking he'd impress his boss -- that's how we taught him to do it.

233
0:09:49.911,000 --> 0:09:51,000
The superintendent walked up and said, "What are you doing?"

234
0:09:52.786,000 --> 0:09:53,000
"Oh, just looking for header material,"

235
0:09:54.73,000 --> 0:09:55,000
waiting for that kudos.

236
0:09:55.915,000 --> 0:09:58,000
He said, "I'm not paying you to go through the trash. Get back to work."

237
0:09:59.397,000 --> 0:10:,000
And Jim had the wherewithal to say,

238
0:10:01.129,000 --> 0:10:04,000
"You know, if you were paying me 300 dollars an hour,

239
0:10:04.527,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I can see how you might say that.

240
0:10:06.568,000 --> 0:10:09,000
But right now, I'm saving you five dollars a minute.

241
0:10:09.669,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Do the math."

242
0:10:11.041,000 --> 0:10:13,000
(Laughter)

243
0:10:13.389,000 --> 0:10:16,000
"Good call, Tulles. From now on, you guys hit this pile first."

244
0:10:16.627,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And the irony is that he wasn't very good at math.

245
0:10:19.126,000 --> 0:10:22,000
(Laughter)

246
0:10:22.556,000 --> 0:10:24,000
But once in a while, you get access to the control room,

247
0:10:25.231,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and then you can kind of mess with the dials.

248
0:10:27.364,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And that's what happened there.

249
0:10:29.698,000 --> 0:10:31,000
The fifth thing is that maybe, after 2,500 years,

250
0:10:32.121,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Plato is still having his way with us in his notion of perfect forms.

251
0:10:35.463,000 --> 0:10:39,000
He said that we have in our noggin the perfect idea of what we want,

252
0:10:39.659,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and we force environmental resources to accommodate that.

253
0:10:42.66,000 --> 0:10:44,000
So we all have in our head the perfect house,

254
0:10:45.142,000 --> 0:10:47,000
the American dream, which is a house,

255
0:10:47.396,000 --> 0:10:48,000
the dream house.

256
0:10:49.007,000 --> 0:10:5,000
The problem is we can't afford it.

257
0:10:50.81,000 --> 0:10:51,000
So we have the American dream look-alike,

258
0:10:52.81,000 --> 0:10:53,000
which is a mobile home.

259
0:10:54.146,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Now there's a blight on the planet.

260
0:10:56.46,000 --> 0:10:57,000
(Laughter)

261
0:10:57.738,000 --> 0:10:58,000
It's a chattel mortgage,

262
0:10:59.482,000 --> 0:11:,000
just like furniture, just like a car.

263
0:11:01.483,000 --> 0:11:04,000
You write the check, and instantly, it depreciates 30 percent.

264
0:11:04.639,000 --> 0:11:07,000
After a year, you can't get insurance on everything you have in it,

265
0:11:07.87,000 --> 0:11:08,000
only on 70 percent.

266
0:11:09.165,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Wired with 14-Gauge wire, typically.

267
0:11:10.938,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Nothing wrong with that,

268
0:11:12.13,000 --> 0:11:14,000
unless you ask it to do what 12-Gauge wire's supposed to do,

269
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and that's what happens.

270
0:11:16.227,000 --> 0:11:17,000
It out-gasses formaldehyde --

271
0:11:17.732,000 --> 0:11:21,000
so much so that there is a federal law in place

272
0:11:21.897,000 --> 0:11:25,000
to warn new mobile home buyers of the formaldehyde atmosphere danger.

273
0:11:26.485,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Are we just being numbingly stupid?

274
0:11:28.555,000 --> 0:11:29,000
The walls are this thick.

275
0:11:30.386,000 --> 0:11:32,000
The whole thing has the structural value of corn.

276
0:11:33.387,000 --> 0:11:34,000
(Laughter)

277
0:11:35.294,000 --> 0:11:37,000
"So ... I thought Palm Harbor Village was over there."

278
0:11:37.89,000 --> 0:11:39,000
"No, no. We had a wind last night.

279
0:11:39.952,000 --> 0:11:4,000
It's gone now."

280
0:11:41.548,000 --> 0:11:44,000
(Laughter)

281
0:11:44.81,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Then when they degrade, what do you do with them?

282
0:11:47.619,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Now, all that --

283
0:11:49.886,000 --> 0:11:51,000
that Apollonian, Platonic model --

284
0:11:52.658,000 --> 0:11:54,000
is what the building industry is predicated on,

285
0:11:55.245,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and there are a number of things that exacerbate that.

286
0:11:57.945,000 --> 0:11:59,000
One is that all the professionals,

287
0:12:00.487,000 --> 0:12:01,000
all the tradesmen, vendors,

288
0:12:02.178,000 --> 0:12:04,000
inspectors, engineers, architects

289
0:12:04.58,000 --> 0:12:05,000
all think like this.

290
0:12:06.698,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And then it works its way back to the consumer,

291
0:12:08.928,000 --> 0:12:09,000
who demands the same model.

292
0:12:10.396,000 --> 0:12:12,000
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. We can't get out of it.

293
0:12:13.531,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Then here come the marketeers and the advertisers.

294
0:12:16.131,000 --> 0:12:18,000
"Woo. Woo-hoo."

295
0:12:18.579,000 --> 0:12:21,000
We buy stuff we didn't know we needed.

296
0:12:21.81,000 --> 0:12:23,000
All we have to do is look at what one company did

297
0:12:24.366,000 --> 0:12:25,000
with carbonated prune juice.

298
0:12:26.381,000 --> 0:12:27,000
How disgusting.

299
0:12:27.81,000 --> 0:12:28,000
(Laughter)

300
0:12:29.626,000 --> 0:12:3,000
But you know what they did?

301
0:12:30.958,000 --> 0:12:33,000
They hooked a metaphor into it and said, "I drink Dr. Pepper ..."

302
0:12:34.058,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And pretty soon, we're swilling that stuff by the lake-ful,

303
0:12:37.076,000 --> 0:12:38,000
by the billions of gallons.

304
0:12:38.811,000 --> 0:12:41,000
It doesn't even have real prunes! Doesn't even keep you regular.

305
0:12:41.972,000 --> 0:12:42,000
(Laughter)

306
0:12:43.756,000 --> 0:12:45,000
My oh my, that makes it worse.

307
0:12:45.81,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And we get sucked into that faster than anything.

308
0:12:49.03,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Then, a man named Jean-Paul Sartre wrote a book

309
0:12:51.763,000 --> 0:12:52,000
titled "Being and Nothingness."

310
0:12:53.272,000 --> 0:12:55,000
It's a pretty quick read. You can snap through it in maybe --

311
0:12:56.218,000 --> 0:12:57,000
(Laughter)

312
0:12:57.306,000 --> 0:12:58,000
maybe two years,

313
0:12:58.482,000 --> 0:12:59,000
if you read eight hours a day.

314
0:13:00.81,000 --> 0:13:02,000
In there, he talked about the divided self.

315
0:13:03.147,000 --> 0:13:06,000
He said human beings act differently when they know they're alone

316
0:13:06.249,000 --> 0:13:08,000
than when they know somebody else is around.

317
0:13:08.333,000 --> 0:13:1,000
So if I'm eating spaghetti, and I know I'm alone,

318
0:13:10.659,000 --> 0:13:11,000
I can eat like a backhoe.

319
0:13:12.151,000 --> 0:13:15,000
I can wipe my mouth on my sleeve, napkin on the table,

320
0:13:15.389,000 --> 0:13:18,000
chew with my mouth open, make little noises,

321
0:13:18.73,000 --> 0:13:19,000
scratch wherever I want.

322
0:13:20.731,000 --> 0:13:21,000
(Laughter)

323
0:13:22.615,000 --> 0:13:23,000
But as soon as you walk in,

324
0:13:24.086,000 --> 0:13:26,000
I go, "Oops! Lil' spaghetti sauce there."

325
0:13:26.588,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Napkin in my lap, half-bites,

326
0:13:28.465,000 --> 0:13:3,000
chew with my mouth closed, no scratching.

327
0:13:30.722,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Now, what I'm doing is fulfilling your expectations

328
0:13:35.681,000 --> 0:13:36,000
of how I should live my life.

329
0:13:39.079,000 --> 0:13:4,000
I feel that expectation,

330
0:13:40.885,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and so I accommodate it,

331
0:13:42.325,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and I'm living my life according to what you expect me to do.

332
0:13:45.595,000 --> 0:13:47,000
That happens in the building industry as well.

333
0:13:47.89,000 --> 0:13:49,000
That's why all subdivisions look the same.

334
0:13:50.769,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Sometimes, we even have these formalized cultural expectations.

335
0:13:54.909,000 --> 0:13:55,000
I'll bet all your shoes match.

336
0:13:56.81,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Sure enough, we all buy into that ...

337
0:13:59.019,000 --> 0:14:,000
(Laughter)

338
0:14:00.693,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And with gated communities,

339
0:14:03.142,000 --> 0:14:05,000
we have a formalized expectation,

340
0:14:05.542,000 --> 0:14:06,000
with a homeowners' association.

341
0:14:07.144,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Sometimes those guys are Nazis,

342
0:14:08.866,000 --> 0:14:09,000
my oh my.

343
0:14:11.19,000 --> 0:14:13,000
That exacerbates and continues this model.

344
0:14:14.972,000 --> 0:14:15,000
The last thing is gregariousness.

345
0:14:17.668,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Human beings are a social species.

346
0:14:19.605,000 --> 0:14:21,000
We like to hang together in groups,

347
0:14:22.327,000 --> 0:14:23,000
just like wildebeests, just like lions.

348
0:14:24.231,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Wildebeests don't hang with lions,

349
0:14:25.911,000 --> 0:14:26,000
because lions eat wildebeests.

350
0:14:27.95,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Human beings are like that.

351
0:14:29.42,000 --> 0:14:31,000
We do what that group does

352
0:14:31.54,000 --> 0:14:32,000
that we're trying to identify with.

353
0:14:33.942,000 --> 0:14:34,000
You see this in junior high a lot.

354
0:14:36.551,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Those kids, they'll work all summer long -- kill themselves --

355
0:14:40.946,000 --> 0:14:44,000
so that they can afford one pair of designer jeans.

356
0:14:45.178,000 --> 0:14:47,000
So along about September,

357
0:14:47.46,000 --> 0:14:48,000
they can stride in and go,

358
0:14:49.461,000 --> 0:14:53,000
"I'm important today. See? Don't touch my designer jeans!

359
0:14:53.699,000 --> 0:14:55,000
I see you don't have designer jeans.

360
0:14:56.56,000 --> 0:14:59,000
You're not one of the beautiful -- See, I'm one of the beautiful people.

361
0:15:00.28,000 --> 0:15:01,000
See my jeans?"

362
0:15:01.492,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Right there is reason enough to have uniforms.

363
0:15:04.445,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And so that happens in the building industry as well.

364
0:15:07.938,000 --> 0:15:11,000
We have confused Maslow's hierarchy of needs,

365
0:15:12.181,000 --> 0:15:13,000
just a little bit.

366
0:15:13.81,000 --> 0:15:16,000
On the bottom tier, we have basic needs:

367
0:15:17.188,000 --> 0:15:2,000
shelter, clothing, food, water, mating and so forth.

368
0:15:20.746,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Second: security. Third: relationships.

369
0:15:23.108,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Fourth: status, self-esteem -- that is, vanity --

370
0:15:26.15,000 --> 0:15:28,000
and we're taking vanity and shoving it down here.

371
0:15:29.603,000 --> 0:15:3,000
And so we end up

372
0:15:32.087,000 --> 0:15:33,000
with vain decisions,

373
0:15:34.865,000 --> 0:15:36,000
and we can't even afford our mortgage.

374
0:15:37.081,000 --> 0:15:39,000
We can't afford to eat anything except beans;

375
0:15:39.859,000 --> 0:15:42,000
that is, our housing has become a commodity.

376
0:15:44.073,000 --> 0:15:46,000
And it takes a little bit of nerve

377
0:15:47.383,000 --> 0:15:49,000
to dive into those primal,

378
0:15:49.81,000 --> 0:15:51,000
terrifying parts of ourselves

379
0:15:52.81,000 --> 0:15:53,000
and make our own decisions

380
0:15:55.262,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and not make our housing a commodity,

381
0:15:57.263,000 --> 0:16:,000
but make it something that bubbles up from seminal sources.

382
0:16:00.81,000 --> 0:16:01,000
That takes a little bit of nerve,

383
0:16:02.611,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and, darn it, once in a while, you fail.

384
0:16:06.233,000 --> 0:16:07,000
But that's okay.

385
0:16:08.44,000 --> 0:16:09,000
If failure destroys you,

386
0:16:10.252,000 --> 0:16:11,000
then you can't do this.

387
0:16:11.506,000 --> 0:16:13,000
I fail all the time, every day,

388
0:16:14.036,000 --> 0:16:17,000
and I've had some whopping failures, I promise --

389
0:16:17.772,000 --> 0:16:2,000
big, public, humiliating, embarrassing failures.

390
0:16:20.81,000 --> 0:16:21,000
Everybody points and laughs,

391
0:16:22.274,000 --> 0:16:25,000
and they say, "He tried it a fifth time, and it still didn't work!

392
0:16:25.394,000 --> 0:16:26,000
What a moron!"

393
0:16:26.798,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Early on, contractors come by and say,

394
0:16:28.81,000 --> 0:16:29,000
"Dan, you're a cute little bunny,

395
0:16:30.597,000 --> 0:16:32,000
but you know, this just isn't going to work.

396
0:16:32.779,000 --> 0:16:34,000
What don't you do this? Why don't you do that?"

397
0:16:35.134,000 --> 0:16:37,000
And your instinct is to say,

398
0:16:37.664,000 --> 0:16:38,000
"Well, why don't you suck an egg?"

399
0:16:39.355,000 --> 0:16:4,000
(Laughter)

400
0:16:40.81,000 --> 0:16:41,000
But you don't say that,

401
0:16:42.498,000 --> 0:16:44,000
because they're the guys you're targeting.

402
0:16:45.451,000 --> 0:16:47,000
And so what we've done --

403
0:16:48.454,000 --> 0:16:51,000
and this isn't just in housing; it's in clothing and food

404
0:16:51.871,000 --> 0:16:53,000
and our transportation needs, our energy --

405
0:16:54.748,000 --> 0:16:56,000
we sprawl just a little bit.

406
0:16:58.256,000 --> 0:17:,000
And when I get a little bit of press,

407
0:17:00.81,000 --> 0:17:01,000
I hear from people all over the world.

408
0:17:03.119,000 --> 0:17:05,000
And we may have invented excess,

409
0:17:05.962,000 --> 0:17:08,000
but the problem of waste is worldwide.

410
0:17:10.444,000 --> 0:17:12,000
We're in trouble.

411
0:17:13.445,000 --> 0:17:16,000
And I don't wear ammo belts crisscrossing my chest

412
0:17:16.523,000 --> 0:17:17,000
and a red bandana.

413
0:17:18.635,000 --> 0:17:19,000
But we're clearly in trouble.

414
0:17:20.858,000 --> 0:17:23,000
And what we need to do is reconnect

415
0:17:24.81,000 --> 0:17:27,000
with those really primal parts of ourselves

416
0:17:28.471,000 --> 0:17:3,000
and make some decisions and say,

417
0:17:30.541,000 --> 0:17:34,000
"You know, I think I would like to put CDs across the wall there.

418
0:17:35.294,000 --> 0:17:36,000
What do you think, honey?"

419
0:17:37.271,000 --> 0:17:38,000
If it doesn't work, take it down.

420
0:17:40.119,000 --> 0:17:42,000
What we need to do is reconnect with who we really are,

421
0:17:43.722,000 --> 0:17:44,000
and that's thrilling indeed.

422
0:17:46.743,000 --> 0:17:47,000
Thank you very much.

423
0:17:47.95,000 --> 0:17:5,000
(Applause)

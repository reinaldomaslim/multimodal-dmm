0:00:16.267,000 --> 0:00:18,000
When I was a child growing up in Maine,

3
0:00:18.426,000 --> 0:00:2,000
one of my favorite things to do

4
0:00:20.45,000 --> 0:00:23,000
was to look for sand dollars on the seashores of Maine,

5
0:00:23.498,000 --> 0:00:25,000
because my parents told me it would bring me luck.

6
0:00:26.228,000 --> 0:00:28,000
But you know, these shells, they're hard to find.

7
0:00:28.93,000 --> 0:00:3,000
They're covered in sand, they're difficult to see.

8
0:00:31.989,000 --> 0:00:34,000
However, over time, I got used to looking for them.

9
0:00:35.457,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I started seeing shapes

10
0:00:37.084,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and patterns that helped me to collect them.

11
0:00:41.115,000 --> 0:00:44,000
This grew into a passion for finding things,

12
0:00:44.44,000 --> 0:00:46,000
a love for the past and archaeology.

13
0:00:46.805,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And eventually, when I started studying Egyptology,

14
0:00:50.138,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I realized that seeing with my naked eyes alone wasn't enough.

15
0:00:54.551,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Because all of the sudden, in Egypt,

16
0:00:57.424,000 --> 0:01:,000
my beach had grown from a tiny beach in Maine

17
0:01:01.043,000 --> 0:01:03,000
to one eight hundred miles long,

18
0:01:03.154,000 --> 0:01:04,000
next to the Nile.

19
0:01:04.729,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And my sand dollars had grown to the size of cities.

20
0:01:09.514,000 --> 0:01:12,000
This is really what brought me to using satellite imagery.

21
0:01:12.657,000 --> 0:01:16,000
For trying to map the past, I knew that I had to see differently.

22
0:01:17.14,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So I want to show you an example of how we see differently

23
0:01:20.522,000 --> 0:01:21,000
using the infrared.

24
0:01:22.163,000 --> 0:01:24,000
This is a site located in the eastern Egyptian delta

25
0:01:25.14,000 --> 0:01:26,000
called Mendes.

26
0:01:26.361,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And the site visibly appears brown,

27
0:01:29.361,000 --> 0:01:31,000
but when we use the infrared

28
0:01:31.591,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and we process it, all of the sudden,

29
0:01:34.265,000 --> 0:01:35,000
using false color,

30
0:01:35.805,000 --> 0:01:36,000
the site appears as bright pink.

31
0:01:37.924,000 --> 0:01:38,000
What you are seeing

32
0:01:39.36,000 --> 0:01:42,000
are the actual chemical changes to the landscape

33
0:01:42.685,000 --> 0:01:45,000
caused by the building materials and activities

34
0:01:46.201,000 --> 0:01:47,000
of the ancient Egyptians.

35
0:01:48.645,000 --> 0:01:5,000
What I want to share with you today

36
0:01:50.78,000 --> 0:01:52,000
is how we've used satellite data

37
0:01:53.605,000 --> 0:01:55,000
to find an ancient Egyptian city,

38
0:01:56.084,000 --> 0:01:57,000
called Itjtawy,

39
0:01:57.726,000 --> 0:01:58,000
missing for thousands of years.

40
0:01:59.965,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Itjtawy was ancient Egypt's capital

41
0:02:03.06,000 --> 0:02:04,000
for over four hundred years,

42
0:02:04.607,000 --> 0:02:06,000
at a period of time called the Middle Kingdom,

43
0:02:06.949,000 --> 0:02:07,000
about four thousand years ago.

44
0:02:08.884,000 --> 0:02:1,000
The site is located in the Faiyum of Egypt,

45
0:02:11.813,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and the site is really important,

46
0:02:13.436,000 --> 0:02:15,000
because in the Middle Kingdom there was this great renaissance

47
0:02:16.458,000 --> 0:02:18,000
for ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion.

48
0:02:20.044,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Egyptologists have always known the site of Itjtawy

49
0:02:22.821,000 --> 0:02:26,000
was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings who built it,

50
0:02:27.275,000 --> 0:02:29,000
indicated within the red circles here,

51
0:02:29.813,000 --> 0:02:31,000
but somewhere within this massive flood plain.

52
0:02:32.131,000 --> 0:02:33,000
This area is huge --

53
0:02:33.439,000 --> 0:02:35,000
it's four miles by three miles in size.

54
0:02:36.559,000 --> 0:02:38,000
The Nile used to flow right next to the city of Itjtawy,

55
0:02:39.432,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and as it shifted and changed and moved over time to the east,

56
0:02:42.869,000 --> 0:02:43,000
it covered over the city.

57
0:02:44.726,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So, how do you find a buried city

58
0:02:48.591,000 --> 0:02:49,000
in a vast landscape?

59
0:02:50.733,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Finding it randomly would be the equivalent

60
0:02:53.218,000 --> 0:02:54,000
of locating a needle in a haystack,

61
0:02:54.94,000 --> 0:02:55,000
blindfolded, wearing baseball mitts.

62
0:02:56.814,000 --> 0:02:57,000
(Laughter)

63
0:02:58.066,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So what we did is we used NASA topography data

64
0:03:01.352,000 --> 0:03:03,000
to map out the landscape, very subtle changes.

65
0:03:04.478,000 --> 0:03:07,000
We started to be able to see where the Nile used to flow.

66
0:03:08.193,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But you can see in more detail, and even more interesting,

67
0:03:11.002,000 --> 0:03:13,000
this very slight raised area

68
0:03:13.073,000 --> 0:03:14,000
seen within the circle up here

69
0:03:14.534,000 --> 0:03:17,000
which we thought could possibly be the location of the city of Itjtawy.

70
0:03:18.493,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So we collaborated with Egyptian scientists

71
0:03:21.532,000 --> 0:03:23,000
to do coring work, which you see here.

72
0:03:23.682,000 --> 0:03:25,000
When I say coring, it's like ice coring,

73
0:03:25.874,000 --> 0:03:26,000
but instead of layers of climate change,

74
0:03:27.833,000 --> 0:03:29,000
you're looking for layers of human occupation.

75
0:03:30.189,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And, five meters down,

76
0:03:31.95,000 --> 0:03:33,000
underneath a thick layer of mud,

77
0:03:34.101,000 --> 0:03:37,000
we found a dense layer of pottery.

78
0:03:37.553,000 --> 0:03:39,000
What this shows is that at this possible location of Itjtawy,

79
0:03:40.451,000 --> 0:03:41,000
five meters down,

80
0:03:41.712,000 --> 0:03:43,000
we have a layer of occupation for several hundred years,

81
0:03:44.561,000 --> 0:03:45,000
dating to the Middle Kingdom,

82
0:03:45.982,000 --> 0:03:47,000
dating to the exact period of time we think Itjtawy is.

83
0:03:49.386,000 --> 0:03:51,000
We also found work stone --

84
0:03:51.998,000 --> 0:03:53,000
carnelian, quartz and agate

85
0:03:54.156,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that shows that there was a jeweler's workshop here.

86
0:03:56.617,000 --> 0:03:57,000
These might not look like much,

87
0:03:58.126,000 --> 0:04:,000
but when you think about the most common stones

88
0:04:00.799,000 --> 0:04:03,000
used in jewelry from the Middle Kingdom,

89
0:04:04.193,000 --> 0:04:05,000
these are the stones that were used.

90
0:04:06.002,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So, we have a dense layer of occupation

91
0:04:08.21,000 --> 0:04:1,000
dating to the Middle Kingdom at this site.

92
0:04:10.235,000 --> 0:04:12,000
We also have evidence of an elite jeweler's workshop,

93
0:04:13.06,000 --> 0:04:16,000
showing that whatever was there was a very important city.

94
0:04:16.814,000 --> 0:04:17,000
No Itjtawy was here yet,

95
0:04:18.758,000 --> 0:04:2,000
but we're going to be returning to the site

96
0:04:20.783,000 --> 0:04:22,000
in the near future to map it out.

97
0:04:22.861,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And even more importantly,

98
0:04:24.536,000 --> 0:04:28,000
we have funding to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology

99
0:04:29.083,000 --> 0:04:31,000
so they can be the ones making great discoveries as well.

100
0:04:32.784,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So I wanted to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Kingdom --

101
0:04:37.646,000 --> 0:04:39,000
it was probably written at the city of Itjtawy

102
0:04:40.211,000 --> 0:04:41,000
four thousand years ago.

103
0:04:42.679,000 --> 0:04:44,000
"Sharing knowledge is the greatest of all callings.

104
0:04:45.178,000 --> 0:04:46,000
There's nothing like it in the land."

105
0:04:46.965,000 --> 0:04:51,000
So as it turns out, TED was not founded in 1984 AD.

106
0:04:52.473,000 --> 0:04:54,000
(Laughter)

107
0:04:55.369,000 --> 0:05:,000
Making ideas actually started in 1984 BC

108
0:05:01.147,000 --> 0:05:04,000
at a not-lost-for-long city, found from above.

109
0:05:04.425,000 --> 0:05:07,000
It certainly puts finding seashells by the seashore in perspective.

110
0:05:08.283,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Thank you very much.

111
0:05:09.459,000 --> 0:05:11,000
(Applause)

112
0:05:11.913,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Thank you.

113
0:05:13.094,000 --> 0:05:15,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.498,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Five years ago, I was a Ph.D. student

2
0:00:15.097,000 --> 0:00:16,000
living two lives.

3
0:00:16.741,000 --> 0:00:18,000
In one, I used NASA supercomputers

4
0:00:19.057,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to design next-generation spacecraft,

5
0:00:21.785,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and in the other I was a data scientist

6
0:00:24.364,000 --> 0:00:26,000
looking for potential smugglers

7
0:00:26.783,000 --> 0:00:29,000
of sensitive nuclear technologies.

8
0:00:30.022,000 --> 0:00:32,000
As a data scientist, I did a lot of analyses,

9
0:00:32.881,000 --> 0:00:33,000
mostly of facilities,

10
0:00:34.348,000 --> 0:00:36,000
industrial facilities around the world.

11
0:00:36.619,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And I was always looking for a better canvas

12
0:00:39.307,000 --> 0:00:41,000
to tie these all together.

13
0:00:41.373,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And one day, I was thinking about how

14
0:00:43.239,000 --> 0:00:45,000
all data has a location,

15
0:00:45.363,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and I realized that the answer

16
0:00:47.096,000 --> 0:00:48,000
had been staring me in the face.

17
0:00:48.984,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Although I was a satellite engineer,

18
0:00:51.622,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I hadn't thought about using satellite imagery

19
0:00:54.793,000 --> 0:00:55,000
in my work.

20
0:00:56.359,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Now, like most of us, I'd been online,

21
0:00:58.306,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I'd see my house, so I thought,

22
0:01:00.088,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I'll hop in there and I'll start looking up

23
0:01:02.386,000 --> 0:01:03,000
some of these facilities.

24
0:01:03.803,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And what I found really surprised me.

25
0:01:05.772,000 --> 0:01:06,000
The pictures that I was finding

26
0:01:07.446,000 --> 0:01:08,000
were years out of date,

27
0:01:09.347,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and because of that,

28
0:01:10.415,000 --> 0:01:11,000
it had relatively little relevance

29
0:01:12.086,000 --> 0:01:14,000
to the work that I was doing today.

30
0:01:14.546,000 --> 0:01:15,000
But I was intrigued.

31
0:01:16.007,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I mean, satellite imagery is pretty amazing stuff.

32
0:01:19.243,000 --> 0:01:21,000
There are millions and millions of sensors

33
0:01:21.546,000 --> 0:01:22,000
surrounding us today,

34
0:01:22.99,000 --> 0:01:24,000
but there's still so much we don't know on a daily basis.

35
0:01:25.95,000 --> 0:01:28,000
How much oil is stored in all of China?

36
0:01:29.703,000 --> 0:01:31,000
How much corn is being produced?

37
0:01:32.636,000 --> 0:01:36,000
How many ships are in all of our world's ports?

38
0:01:36.707,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Now, in theory, all of these questions

39
0:01:39.266,000 --> 0:01:41,000
could be answered by imagery,

40
0:01:41.51,000 --> 0:01:42,000
but not if it's old.

41
0:01:43.237,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And if this data was so valuable,

42
0:01:45.695,000 --> 0:01:46,000
then how come I couldn't get my hands

43
0:01:47.627,000 --> 0:01:49,000
on more recent pictures?

44
0:01:50.177,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So the story begins over 50 years ago

45
0:01:53.312,000 --> 0:01:54,000
with the launch of the first generation

46
0:01:55.183,000 --> 0:01:58,000
of U.S. government photo reconnaissance satellites.

47
0:01:58.783,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And today, there's a handful

48
0:02:00.479,000 --> 0:02:02,000
of the great, great grandchildren

49
0:02:02.674,000 --> 0:02:03,000
of these early Cold War machines

50
0:02:04.339,000 --> 0:02:06,000
which are now operated by private companies

51
0:02:06.348,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and from which the vast majority of satellite imagery

52
0:02:09.057,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that you and I see on a daily basis comes.

53
0:02:11.882,000 --> 0:02:13,000
During this period, launching things into space,

54
0:02:14.796,000 --> 0:02:16,000
just the rocket to get the satellite up there,

55
0:02:17.473,000 --> 0:02:21,000
has cost hundreds of millions of dollars each,

56
0:02:22.074,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and that's created tremendous pressure

57
0:02:23.826,000 --> 0:02:25,000
to launch things infrequently

58
0:02:26.115,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and to make sure that when you do,

59
0:02:27.459,000 --> 0:02:3,000
you cram as much functionality in there as possible.

60
0:02:31.098,000 --> 0:02:32,000
All of this has only made satellites

61
0:02:32.709,000 --> 0:02:34,000
bigger and bigger and bigger

62
0:02:35.126,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and more expensive,

63
0:02:36.724,000 --> 0:02:41,000
now nearly a billion, with a b, dollars per copy.

64
0:02:41.761,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Because they are so expensive,

65
0:02:43.46,000 --> 0:02:44,000
there aren't very many of them.

66
0:02:44.927,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Because there aren't very many of them,

67
0:02:46.272,000 --> 0:02:48,000
the pictures that we see on a daily basis

68
0:02:48.728,000 --> 0:02:49,000
tend to be old.

69
0:02:50.232,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I think a lot of people actually understand this anecdotally,

70
0:02:53.514,000 --> 0:02:55,000
but in order to visualize just how sparsely

71
0:02:56.053,000 --> 0:02:57,000
our planet is collected,

72
0:02:57.937,000 --> 0:02:59,000
some friends and I put together a dataset

73
0:03:00.003,000 --> 0:03:02,000
of the 30 million pictures that have been gathered

74
0:03:02.59,000 --> 0:03:05,000
by these satellites between 2000 and 2010.

75
0:03:06.074,000 --> 0:03:08,000
As you can see in blue, huge areas of our world

76
0:03:08.829,000 --> 0:03:1,000
are barely seen, less than once a year,

77
0:03:11.619,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and even the areas that are seen most frequently,

78
0:03:13.891,000 --> 0:03:16,000
those in red, are seen at best once a quarter.

79
0:03:17.639,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Now as aerospace engineering grad students,

80
0:03:20.555,000 --> 0:03:23,000
this chart cried out to us as a challenge.

81
0:03:23.983,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Why do these things have to be so expensive?

82
0:03:27.438,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Does a single satellite really have to cost

83
0:03:30.173,000 --> 0:03:34,000
the equivalent of three 747 jumbo jets?

84
0:03:34.936,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Wasn't there a way to build a smaller,

85
0:03:37.099,000 --> 0:03:4,000
simpler, new satellite design that could enable

86
0:03:40.271,000 --> 0:03:42,000
more timely imaging?

87
0:03:42.289,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I realize that it does sound a little bit crazy

88
0:03:45.74,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that we were going to go out and just

89
0:03:47.251,000 --> 0:03:48,000
begin designing satellites,

90
0:03:49.098,000 --> 0:03:5,000
but fortunately we had help.

91
0:03:51.061,000 --> 0:03:53,000
In the late 1990s, a couple of professors

92
0:03:53.996,000 --> 0:03:56,000
proposed a concept for radically reducing the price

93
0:03:57.477,000 --> 0:03:58,000
of putting things in space.

94
0:03:59.249,000 --> 0:04:01,000
This was hitchhiking small satellites

95
0:04:01.36,000 --> 0:04:04,000
alongside much larger satellites.

96
0:04:04.376,000 --> 0:04:06,000
This dropped the cost of putting objects up there

97
0:04:07.285,000 --> 0:04:08,000
by over a factor of 100,

98
0:04:09.283,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and suddenly we could afford to experiment,

99
0:04:12.369,000 --> 0:04:13,000
to take a little bit of risk,

100
0:04:13.837,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and to realize a lot of innovation.

101
0:04:16.103,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And a new generation of engineers and scientists,

102
0:04:19.192,000 --> 0:04:2,000
mostly out of universities,

103
0:04:20.791,000 --> 0:04:22,000
began launching these very small,

104
0:04:23.134,000 --> 0:04:25,000
breadbox-sized satellites called CubeSats.

105
0:04:25.725,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And these were built with electronics obtained

106
0:04:28.128,000 --> 0:04:31,000
from RadioShack instead of Lockheed Martin.

107
0:04:32.026,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Now it was using the lessons learned from these early missions

108
0:04:34.866,000 --> 0:04:36,000
that my friends and I began a series of sketches

109
0:04:37.561,000 --> 0:04:38,000
of our own satellite design.

110
0:04:39.25,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And I can't remember a specific day

111
0:04:42.034,000 --> 0:04:43,000
where we made a conscious decision

112
0:04:43.894,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that we were actually going to go out and build these things,

113
0:04:46.529,000 --> 0:04:48,000
but once we got that idea in our minds

114
0:04:48.959,000 --> 0:04:5,000
of the world as a dataset,

115
0:04:51.12,000 --> 0:04:53,000
of being able to capture millions of data points

116
0:04:53.61,000 --> 0:04:56,000
on a daily basis describing the global economy,

117
0:04:56.663,000 --> 0:04:58,000
of being able to unearth billions of connections

118
0:04:59.183,000 --> 0:05:02,000
between them that had never before been found,

119
0:05:02.348,000 --> 0:05:03,000
it just seemed boring

120
0:05:03.996,000 --> 0:05:05,000
to go work on anything else.

121
0:05:06.903,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And so we moved into a cramped,

122
0:05:09.876,000 --> 0:05:11,000
windowless office in Palo Alto,

123
0:05:12.855,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and began working to take our design

124
0:05:14.822,000 --> 0:05:16,000
from the drawing board into the lab.

125
0:05:17.76,000 --> 0:05:19,000
The first major question we had to tackle

126
0:05:20.418,000 --> 0:05:22,000
was just how big to build this thing.

127
0:05:22.752,000 --> 0:05:25,000
In space, size drives cost,

128
0:05:25.935,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and we had worked with these very small,

129
0:05:27.948,000 --> 0:05:29,000
breadbox-sized satellites in school,

130
0:05:30.042,000 --> 0:05:32,000
but as we began to better understand the laws of physics,

131
0:05:32.593,000 --> 0:05:34,000
we found that the quality of pictures

132
0:05:34.715,000 --> 0:05:37,000
those satellites could take was very limited,

133
0:05:37.799,000 --> 0:05:38,000
because the laws of physics dictate

134
0:05:39.503,000 --> 0:05:42,000
that the best picture you can take through a telescope

135
0:05:42.609,000 --> 0:05:44,000
is a function of the diameter of that telescope,

136
0:05:44.848,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and these satellites had a very small,

137
0:05:46.51,000 --> 0:05:47,000
very constrained volume.

138
0:05:48.216,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And we found that the best picture we would

139
0:05:50.011,000 --> 0:05:52,000
have been able to get looked something like this.

140
0:05:52.496,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Although this was the low-cost option,

141
0:05:54.741,000 --> 0:05:55,000
quite frankly it was just too blurry

142
0:05:56.414,000 --> 0:05:59,000
to see the things that make satellite imagery valuable.

143
0:05:59.983,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So about three or four weeks later,

144
0:06:02.129,000 --> 0:06:04,000
we met a group of engineers randomly

145
0:06:04.946,000 --> 0:06:05,000
who had worked on the first

146
0:06:06.587,000 --> 0:06:08,000
private imaging satellite ever developed,

147
0:06:09.028,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and they told us that back in the 1970s,

148
0:06:11.146,000 --> 0:06:13,000
the U.S. government had found a powerful

149
0:06:13.328,000 --> 0:06:14,000
optimal tradeoff --

150
0:06:14.971,000 --> 0:06:17,000
that in taking pictures at right about one meter resolution,

151
0:06:18.059,000 --> 0:06:2,000
being able to see objects one meter in size,

152
0:06:20.943,000 --> 0:06:22,000
they had found that they could not just get very high-quality images,

153
0:06:23.634,000 --> 0:06:25,000
but get a lot of them at an affordable price.

154
0:06:26.527,000 --> 0:06:27,000
From our own computer simulations,

155
0:06:28.503,000 --> 0:06:3,000
we quickly found that one meter really was

156
0:06:30.508,000 --> 0:06:31,000
the minimum viable product

157
0:06:32.272,000 --> 0:06:35,000
to be able to see the drivers of our global economy,

158
0:06:35.351,000 --> 0:06:36,000
for the first time, being able to count

159
0:06:36.912,000 --> 0:06:38,000
the ships and cars and shipping containers and trucks

160
0:06:39.633,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that move around our world on a daily basis,

161
0:06:42.457,000 --> 0:06:45,000
while conveniently still not being able to see individuals.

162
0:06:46.261,000 --> 0:06:47,000
We had found our compromise.

163
0:06:47.882,000 --> 0:06:48,000
We would have to build something larger

164
0:06:49.486,000 --> 0:06:5,000
than the original breadbox,

165
0:06:51.049,000 --> 0:06:52,000
now more like a mini-fridge,

166
0:06:52.7,000 --> 0:06:54,000
but we still wouldn't have to build a pickup truck.

167
0:06:55.461,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So now we had our constraint.

168
0:06:58.085,000 --> 0:06:59,000
The laws of physics dictated

169
0:06:59.842,000 --> 0:07:02,000
the absolute minimum-sized telescope that we could build.

170
0:07:03.166,000 --> 0:07:06,000
What came next was making the rest of the satellite

171
0:07:06.22,000 --> 0:07:07,000
as small and as simple as possible,

172
0:07:07.961,000 --> 0:07:09,000
basically a flying telescope with four walls

173
0:07:10.613,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and a set of electronics smaller than a phone book

174
0:07:13.554,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that used less power than a 100 watt lightbulb.

175
0:07:16.992,000 --> 0:07:17,000
The big challenge became actually taking

176
0:07:18.892,000 --> 0:07:2,000
the pictures through that telescope.

177
0:07:21.09,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Traditional imaging satellites use a line scanner,

178
0:07:24.134,000 --> 0:07:25,000
similar to a Xerox machine,

179
0:07:25.895,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and as they traverse the Earth, they take pictures,

180
0:07:28.295,000 --> 0:07:3,000
scanning row by row by row

181
0:07:30.491,000 --> 0:07:31,000
to build the complete image.

182
0:07:32.166,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Now people use these because they get a lot of light,

183
0:07:35.17,000 --> 0:07:36,000
which means less of the noise you see

184
0:07:37.016,000 --> 0:07:39,000
in a low-cost cell phone image.

185
0:07:39.752,000 --> 0:07:41,000
The problem with them is they require

186
0:07:42.113,000 --> 0:07:44,000
very sophisticated pointing.

187
0:07:44.353,000 --> 0:07:46,000
You have to stay focused on a 50-centimeter target

188
0:07:46.899,000 --> 0:07:47,000
from over 600 miles away

189
0:07:48.651,000 --> 0:07:5,000
while moving at more than seven kilometers a second,

190
0:07:50.883,000 --> 0:07:52,000
which requires an awesome degree of complexity.

191
0:07:53.632,000 --> 0:07:56,000
So instead, we turned to a new generation of video sensors,

192
0:07:57.069,000 --> 0:08:,000
originally created for use in night vision goggles.

193
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Instead of taking a single, high quality image,

194
0:08:03.059,000 --> 0:08:04,000
we could take a videostream

195
0:08:04.446,000 --> 0:08:06,000
of individually noisier frames,

196
0:08:07.369,000 --> 0:08:08,000
but then we could recombine

197
0:08:09.113,000 --> 0:08:1,000
all of those frames together

198
0:08:10.579,000 --> 0:08:11,000
into very high-quality images

199
0:08:12.575,000 --> 0:08:14,000
using sophisticated pixel processing techniques

200
0:08:15.168,000 --> 0:08:16,000
here on the ground,

201
0:08:16.689,000 --> 0:08:19,000
at a cost of one one hundredth a traditional system.

202
0:08:19.826,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And we applied this technique

203
0:08:20.979,000 --> 0:08:22,000
to many of the other systems on the satellite as well,

204
0:08:23.953,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and day by day, our design evolved

205
0:08:26.793,000 --> 0:08:29,000
from CAD to prototypes

206
0:08:30.282,000 --> 0:08:32,000
to production units.

207
0:08:33.17,000 --> 0:08:34,000
A few short weeks ago,

208
0:08:34.827,000 --> 0:08:35,000
we packed up SkySat 1,

209
0:08:36.678,000 --> 0:08:37,000
put our signatures on it,

210
0:08:38.451,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and waved goodbye for the last time on Earth.

211
0:08:40.674,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Today, it's sitting in its final launch configuration

212
0:08:44.155,000 --> 0:08:47,000
ready to blast off in a few short weeks.

213
0:08:47.216,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And soon, we'll turn our attention to launching

214
0:08:49.558,000 --> 0:08:52,000
a constellation of 24 or more of these satellites

215
0:08:52.589,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and beginning to build the scalable analytics

216
0:08:55.139,000 --> 0:08:57,000
that will allow us to unearth the insights

217
0:08:57.478,000 --> 0:09:,000
in the petabytes of data we will collect.

218
0:09:00.667,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So why do all of this? Why build these satellites?

219
0:09:04.64,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Well, it turns out imaging satellites

220
0:09:07.251,000 --> 0:09:1,000
have a unique ability to provide global transparency,

221
0:09:10.961,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and providing that transparency on a timely basis

222
0:09:13.587,000 --> 0:09:16,000
is simply an idea whose time has come.

223
0:09:16.998,000 --> 0:09:19,000
We see ourselves as pioneers of a new frontier,

224
0:09:20.521,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and beyond economic data,

225
0:09:22.285,000 --> 0:09:25,000
unlocking the human story, moment by moment.

226
0:09:25.886,000 --> 0:09:26,000
For a data scientist

227
0:09:27.449,000 --> 0:09:29,000
that just happened to go to space camp as a kid,

228
0:09:30.199,000 --> 0:09:32,000
it just doesn't get much better than that.

229
0:09:32.914,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Thank you.

230
0:09:35.129,000 --> 0:09:39,000
(Applause)

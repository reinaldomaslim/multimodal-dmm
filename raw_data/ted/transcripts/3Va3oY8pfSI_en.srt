0:00:12.135,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I remember thinking to myself,

3
0:00:14.072,000 --> 0:00:17,000
"This is going to change everything about how we communicate."

[Margaret Gould Stewart on the Hyperlink]

7
0:00:23.603,000 --> 0:00:25,000
A hyperlink is an interface element,

8
0:00:26.135,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and what I mean by that is,

9
0:00:27.555,000 --> 0:00:3,000
when you're using software on your phone or your computer,

10
0:00:31.095,000 --> 0:00:33,000
there's a lot of code behind the interface

11
0:00:33.293,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that's giving all the instructions for the computer on how to manage it,

12
0:00:36.698,000 --> 0:00:39,000
but that interface is the thing that humans interact with:

13
0:00:39.753,000 --> 0:00:41,000
when we press on this, then something happens.

14
0:00:42.625,000 --> 0:00:44,000
When they first came around, they were pretty simple

15
0:00:45.432,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and not particularly glamorous.

16
0:00:47.528,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Designers today have a huge range of options.

17
0:00:51.956,000 --> 0:00:55,000
The hyperlink uses what's called a markup language -- HTML.

18
0:00:56.254,000 --> 0:00:57,000
There's a little string of code.

19
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And then you put the address of where you want to send the person.

20
0:01:02.207,000 --> 0:01:04,000
It's actually remarkably easy to learn how to do.

21
0:01:04.873,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And so, the whole range of references to information elsewhere on the internet

22
0:01:10.284,000 --> 0:01:11,000
is the domain of the hyperlink.

23
0:01:12.903,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Back when I was in school --

24
0:01:14.434,000 --> 0:01:17,000
this is before people had wide access to the internet --

25
0:01:17.918,000 --> 0:01:18,000
if I was going to do a research paper,

26
0:01:19.759,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I would have to physically walk to the library,

27
0:01:22.528,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and if they had the book that you needed, great.

28
0:01:24.845,000 --> 0:01:25,000
You sometimes had to send out for it,

29
0:01:26.702,000 --> 0:01:27,000
so the process could take weeks.

30
0:01:28.591,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And it's kind of crazy to think about that now,

31
0:01:31.52,000 --> 0:01:34,000
because, like all great innovations,

32
0:01:34.779,000 --> 0:01:36,000
it's not long after we get access to something

33
0:01:36.993,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that we start to take it for granted.

34
0:01:39.287,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Back in 1945,

35
0:01:40.731,000 --> 0:01:42,000
there was this guy, Vannevar Bush.

36
0:01:43.334,000 --> 0:01:44,000
He was working for the US government,

37
0:01:45.351,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and one of the ideas that he put forth was,

38
0:01:47.548,000 --> 0:01:49,000
"Wow, humans are creating so much information,

39
0:01:50.219,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and we can't keep track of all the books that we've read

40
0:01:53.482,000 --> 0:01:55,000
or the connections between important ideas."

41
0:01:56.196,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And he had this idea called the "memex,"

42
0:01:58.177,000 --> 0:02:,000
where you could put together a personal library

43
0:02:00.543,000 --> 0:02:04,000
of all of the books and articles that you have access to.

44
0:02:04.63,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And that idea of connecting sources captured people's imaginations.

45
0:02:09.383,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Later, in the 1960s,

46
0:02:11.136,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Ted Nelson launches Project Xanadu,

47
0:02:14.311,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and he said,

48
0:02:15.645,000 --> 0:02:18,000
"Well, what if it wasn't just limited to the things that I have?

49
0:02:18.698,000 --> 0:02:21,000
What if I could connect ideas across a larger body of work?"

50
0:02:23.02,000 --> 0:02:25,000
In 1982, researchers at the University of Maryland

51
0:02:25.782,000 --> 0:02:27,000
developed a system they called HyperTIES.

52
0:02:28.155,000 --> 0:02:31,000
They were the first to use text itself as a link marker.

53
0:02:31.624,000 --> 0:02:34,000
They figured out that this blue link on a gray background

54
0:02:34.851,000 --> 0:02:36,000
was going to work really well in terms of contrast,

55
0:02:37.304,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and people would be able to see it.

56
0:02:39.114,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Apple invented HyperCard in 1987.

57
0:02:42.716,000 --> 0:02:43,000
You had these stacks of cards,

58
0:02:44.675,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and you could create links in between the cards.

59
0:02:46.985,000 --> 0:02:51,000
HyperCard actually created the ability to jump around in a story.

60
0:02:52.468,000 --> 0:02:54,000
These kinds of notions of nonlinear storytelling

61
0:02:55.38,000 --> 0:02:57,000
got a huge boost when the hyperlink came along,

62
0:02:57.938,000 --> 0:03:01,000
because it gave people the opportunity to influence the narrative.

63
0:03:02.097,000 --> 0:03:04,000
These ideas and inventions, among others,

64
0:03:04.501,000 --> 0:03:07,000
inspired Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web.

65
0:03:09.246,000 --> 0:03:11,000
The hyperlink almost feels like a LEGO block,

66
0:03:11.54,000 --> 0:03:15,000
this very basic building block to a very complex web of connections

67
0:03:16.222,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that exists all around the world.

68
0:03:17.83,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Because of the way that hyperlinks were first constructed,

69
0:03:20.579,000 --> 0:03:23,000
they were intended to be not only used by many people,

70
0:03:24.483,000 --> 0:03:26,000
but created by many people.

71
0:03:26.547,000 --> 0:03:3,000
To me, it's one of the most democratic designs ever created.

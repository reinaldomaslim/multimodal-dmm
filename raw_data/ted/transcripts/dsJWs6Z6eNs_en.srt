1
0:00:12.698,000 --> 0:00:15,000
About 200 years ago,

2
0:00:16.326,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Napoleon famously warned ...

3
0:00:21.595,000 --> 0:00:25,000
He said, "Let China sleep,

4
0:00:25.958,000 --> 0:00:27,000
for when she wakes,

5
0:00:28.042,000 --> 0:00:29,000
she will shake the world."

6
0:00:31.208,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Despite this early warning,

7
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:37,000
the West chose to go to sleep

8
0:00:37.125,000 --> 0:00:41,000
at precisely the moment when China and India

9
0:00:41.875,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and the rest of Asia woke up.

10
0:00:45.667,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Why did this happen?

11
0:00:47.792,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I'm here to address this great mystery.

12
0:00:51.75,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Now what do I mean when I say the West chose to go to sleep?

13
0:00:55.75,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Here I'm referring to the failure of the West

14
0:00:59.042,000 --> 0:01:03,000
to react intelligently and thoughtfully

15
0:01:03.5,000 --> 0:01:06,000
to a new world environment that's obviously been created

16
0:01:07.083,000 --> 0:01:08,000
by the return of Asia.

17
0:01:09.292,000 --> 0:01:12,000
As a friend of the West I feel anguished by this,

18
0:01:13.042,000 --> 0:01:16,000
so my goal to today is to try to help the West.

19
0:01:17.542,000 --> 0:01:19,000
But I have to begin the story first

20
0:01:20.25,000 --> 0:01:25,000
by talking about how the West actually woke up the rest of the world.

21
0:01:26.25,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Look at chart one.

22
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:34,000
From the year one through the year 1820,

23
0:01:34.5,000 --> 0:01:4,000
the two largest economies of the world were always those of China and India.

24
0:01:42.375,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So it's only in the last 200 years that Europe took off,

25
0:01:47.708,000 --> 0:01:48,000
followed by North America.

26
0:01:50.375,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So the past 200 years of world history

27
0:01:54.5,000 --> 0:01:58,000
have therefore been a major historical aberration.

28
0:02:00.333,000 --> 0:02:04,000
All aberrations come to a natural end

29
0:02:04.375,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and this is what we are seeing.

30
0:02:06.458,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And if you look at chart two,

31
0:02:08.75,000 --> 0:02:12,000
you'll see how quickly and how forcefully

32
0:02:13.542,000 --> 0:02:17,000
China and India are coming back.

33
0:02:18.75,000 --> 0:02:2,000
The big question is:

34
0:02:20.958,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Who woke up China and India?

35
0:02:25.292,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The only honest answer to this question is that it was Western civilization

36
0:02:30.792,000 --> 0:02:31,000
that did so.

37
0:02:32.583,000 --> 0:02:35,000
We all know that the West was the first to successfully modernize,

38
0:02:35.75,000 --> 0:02:36,000
transform itself;

39
0:02:37.208,000 --> 0:02:41,000
initially it used its power to colonize and dominate the world.

40
0:02:41.333,000 --> 0:02:45,000
But over time, it shared the gifts of Western wisdom

41
0:02:46.125,000 --> 0:02:48,000
with the rest of the world.

42
0:02:48.208,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Let me add here that I have personally benefited

43
0:02:52.458,000 --> 0:02:54,000
from the sharing of Western wisdom.

44
0:02:55.083,000 --> 0:02:57,000
When I was born in Singapore,

45
0:02:57.417,000 --> 0:02:59,000
which was then a poor British colony,

46
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:01,000
in 1948,

47
0:03:01.792,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I experienced, like three-quarters of humanity then,

48
0:03:06.167,000 --> 0:03:07,000
extreme poverty.

49
0:03:08.083,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Indeed, on the first day when I went to school

50
0:03:11.333,000 --> 0:03:12,000
at the age of six,

51
0:03:12.792,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I was put in a special feeding program

52
0:03:15.208,000 --> 0:03:19,000
because I was technically undernourished.

53
0:03:19.667,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Now as you can see I'm overnourished.

54
0:03:21.708,000 --> 0:03:22,000
(Laughter)

55
0:03:23.708,000 --> 0:03:28,000
But the greatest gift I got was that of Western education.

56
0:03:30.208,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Now since I've personally traveled this journey

57
0:03:34.333,000 --> 0:03:4,000
from third world poverty to a comfortable middle-class existence,

58
0:03:40.625,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I can speak with great conviction about the impact of Western wisdom

59
0:03:45.708,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and the sharing of Western wisdom with the world.

60
0:03:49.25,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And one particular gift that the West shared

61
0:03:53.25,000 --> 0:03:55,000
was the art of reasoning.

62
0:03:55.667,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Now reasoning was not invented by the West.

63
0:03:58.542,000 --> 0:04:02,000
It's inherent in all cultures and civilizations.

64
0:04:02.583,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Amartya Sen has described how deeply embedded it is in Indian civilization.

65
0:04:10.292,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Yet there's also no doubt

66
0:04:12.708,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that it was the West that carried the art of reasoning

67
0:04:16.333,000 --> 0:04:18,000
to a much higher level.

68
0:04:18.875,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And through the Scientific Revolution,

69
0:04:20.792,000 --> 0:04:21,000
the Enlightenment,

70
0:04:22.333,000 --> 0:04:24,000
the Industrial Revolution,

71
0:04:24.792,000 --> 0:04:27,000
the West really raised it forcefully,

72
0:04:28.625,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and equally importantly used this,

73
0:04:31.708,000 --> 0:04:36,000
applied it to solve many major practical problems.

74
0:04:37.333,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And the West then shared this art of applied reasoning

75
0:04:41.417,000 --> 0:04:42,000
with the rest of the world,

76
0:04:43.208,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and I can tell you that it led

77
0:04:46.083,000 --> 0:04:5,000
to what I call three silent revolutions.

78
0:04:50.958,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And as an Asian,

79
0:04:52.875,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I can describe how these silent revolutions transformed Asia.

80
0:05:00.5,000 --> 0:05:04,000
The first revolution was in economics.

81
0:05:04.667,000 --> 0:05:08,000
The main reason why so many Asian economies,

82
0:05:09.625,000 --> 0:05:13,000
including the communist societies of China and Vietnam,

83
0:05:14.625,000 --> 0:05:18,000
have performed so spectacularly well in economic development,

84
0:05:19.292,000 --> 0:05:23,000
is because they finally understood, absorbed and are implementing

85
0:05:23.542,000 --> 0:05:25,000
free market economics --

86
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
a gift from the West.

87
0:05:27.292,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Adam Smith was right.

88
0:05:29.667,000 --> 0:05:31,000
If you let markets decide,

89
0:05:32.333,000 --> 0:05:33,000
productivity goes up.

90
0:05:35.625,000 --> 0:05:38,000
The second gift was psychological.

91
0:05:39.208,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Here too I can speak from personal experience.

92
0:05:43.708,000 --> 0:05:44,000
When I was young,

93
0:05:45.125,000 --> 0:05:49,000
my mother and her generation believed

94
0:05:49.667,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that life was determined by fate.

95
0:05:53.083,000 --> 0:05:55,000
You couldn't do anything about it.

96
0:05:56,000 --> 0:05:57,000
My generation

97
0:05:57.958,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and the generation of Asians after me,

98
0:06:00.708,000 --> 0:06:02,000
believe that we can take charge

99
0:06:02.833,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and we can improve our lives.

100
0:06:05.708,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And this may explain, for example,

101
0:06:07.792,000 --> 0:06:12,000
the spike of entrepreneurship you see all throughout Asia today.

102
0:06:13.75,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And if you travel through Asia today,

103
0:06:16.625,000 --> 0:06:22,000
you will also see the results of the third revolution:

104
0:06:23.208,000 --> 0:06:27,000
the revolution of good governance.

105
0:06:27.417,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Now as a result of good governance --

106
0:06:30.542,000 --> 0:06:31,000
travel in Asia,

107
0:06:31.958,000 --> 0:06:33,000
you see better health care,

108
0:06:34.125,000 --> 0:06:35,000
better education,

109
0:06:36.083,000 --> 0:06:38,000
better infrastructure,

110
0:06:38.125,000 --> 0:06:4,000
better public policies.

111
0:06:40.292,000 --> 0:06:41,000
It's a different world.

112
0:06:42.667,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Now having transformed the world

113
0:06:45.667,000 --> 0:06:48,000
through the sharing of Western wisdom with the rest of the world,

114
0:06:49.375,000 --> 0:06:53,000
the logical and rational response of the West should have been

115
0:06:54.042,000 --> 0:06:58,000
to say, "Hey, we have to adjust and adapt to this new world."

116
0:06:59.958,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Instead, the West chose to go to sleep.

117
0:07:04.5,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Why did it happen?

118
0:07:06.625,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I believe it happened

119
0:07:09.292,000 --> 0:07:15,000
because the West became distracted with two major events.

120
0:07:16.625,000 --> 0:07:2,000
The first event was the end of the Cold War.

121
0:07:21.917,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Yes, the end of the Cold War was a great victory.

122
0:07:27.042,000 --> 0:07:32,000
The West defeated the mighty Soviet Union without firing a shot.

123
0:07:32.75,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Amazing.

124
0:07:34.667,000 --> 0:07:37,000
But you know, when you have a great victory like this,

125
0:07:38.208,000 --> 0:07:42,000
it also leads to arrogance and hubris.

126
0:07:43.083,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And this hubris was best captured in a very famous essay

127
0:07:48.667,000 --> 0:07:5,000
by Francis Fukuyama

128
0:07:50.833,000 --> 0:07:52,000
called "The End of History?"

129
0:07:54.083,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Now, Fukuyama was putting across a very sophisticated message,

130
0:08:00.083,000 --> 0:08:03,000
but all that the West heard from this essay

131
0:08:03.667,000 --> 0:08:06,000
was that we, the liberal democracies,

132
0:08:07.583,000 --> 0:08:08,000
we have succeeded,

133
0:08:09.458,000 --> 0:08:1,000
we don't have to change,

134
0:08:11.167,000 --> 0:08:12,000
we don't have to adapt,

135
0:08:12.458,000 --> 0:08:16,000
it's only the rest of the world that has to change and adapt.

136
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Unfortunately, like a dangerous opiate,

137
0:08:22.583,000 --> 0:08:25,000
this essay did a lot of brain damage to the West

138
0:08:26.125,000 --> 0:08:28,000
because it put them to sleep

139
0:08:28.292,000 --> 0:08:32,000
just at precisely the moment when China and India were waking up

140
0:08:33.25,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and the West didn't adjust and adapt.

141
0:08:37.083,000 --> 0:08:41,000
The second major event was 9/11,

142
0:08:41.667,000 --> 0:08:44,000
which happened in 2001.

143
0:08:45.457,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And as we know, 9/11 caused a lot of shock and grief.

144
0:08:51.625,000 --> 0:08:54,000
I personally experienced the shock and grief

145
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:59,000
because I was in Manhattan when 9/11 happened.

146
0:09:00.75,000 --> 0:09:04,000
9/11 also generated a lot of anger,

147
0:09:04.875,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and in this anger, the United States decided to invade Afghanistan

148
0:09:09.583,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and later, Iraq.

149
0:09:12.625,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And unfortunately,

150
0:09:16.875,000 --> 0:09:18,000
partly as a result of this anger,

151
0:09:19.333,000 --> 0:09:23,000
the West didn't notice the significance of another event

152
0:09:24.125,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that happened also in 2001.

153
0:09:28.375,000 --> 0:09:31,000
China joined the World Trade Organization.

154
0:09:33.25,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Now, when you suddenly inject

155
0:09:36.25,000 --> 0:09:4,000
900 million new workers

156
0:09:40.5,000 --> 0:09:43,000
into the global capitalist system,

157
0:09:44.125,000 --> 0:09:45,000
it would naturally lead

158
0:09:45.875,000 --> 0:09:52,000
to what the economist Joseph Schumpeter called creative destruction.

159
0:09:53.917,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Western workers lost their jobs,

160
0:09:57.917,000 --> 0:10:,000
they saw their incomes stagnate,

161
0:10:01.125,000 --> 0:10:05,000
clearly people had to think about new competitive policies,

162
0:10:05.583,000 --> 0:10:06,000
workers needed retraining,

163
0:10:07.458,000 --> 0:10:09,000
workers needed new skills.

164
0:10:09.5,000 --> 0:10:1,000
None of this was done.

165
0:10:12.542,000 --> 0:10:14,000
So partly as a result of this,

166
0:10:15.292,000 --> 0:10:17,000
the United States of America became

167
0:10:17.417,000 --> 0:10:23,000
the only major developed society

168
0:10:23.833,000 --> 0:10:28,000
where the average income of the bottom 50 percent --

169
0:10:29.625,000 --> 0:10:32,000
yes, 50 percent --

170
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
average income went down over a 30-year period,

171
0:10:38.125,000 --> 0:10:41,000
from 1980 to 2010.

172
0:10:43.875,000 --> 0:10:46,000
So partly, as a result of this,

173
0:10:47.833,000 --> 0:10:52,000
it led eventually to the election of Donald Trump in 2016,

174
0:10:53.792,000 --> 0:10:56,000
who exploited the anger of the working classes,

175
0:10:56.833,000 --> 0:10:58,000
who are predominantly white.

176
0:10:58.875,000 --> 0:11:02,000
It also contributed to the rise of populism in Europe.

177
0:11:03.542,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And one wonders,

178
0:11:05.25,000 --> 0:11:07,000
could this populism have been avoided

179
0:11:07.75,000 --> 0:11:12,000
if the West had not been distracted by the end of the Cold War and by 9/11?

180
0:11:14.792,000 --> 0:11:16,000
But the big question we face today is this:

181
0:11:18.875,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Is it too late?

182
0:11:20.792,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Has the West lost everything?

183
0:11:23.917,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And my answer is that it's not too late.

184
0:11:27.542,000 --> 0:11:31,000
It is possible for the West to recover

185
0:11:31.708,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and come back in strength.

186
0:11:34.292,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And using the Western art of reasoning,

187
0:11:38.167,000 --> 0:11:43,000
I would recommend that the West adopt a new "three-m" strategy:

188
0:11:43.792,000 --> 0:11:47,000
minimalist, multilateral and Machiavellian.

189
0:11:49.5,000 --> 0:11:5,000
(Laughter)

190
0:11:50.875,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Why minimalist?

191
0:11:52.5,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Now even though Western domination has ended,

192
0:11:56.833,000 --> 0:11:59,000
the West continues to intervene and interfere in the affairs

193
0:12:00.833,000 --> 0:12:01,000
of many other societies.

194
0:12:02.708,000 --> 0:12:03,000
This is unwise.

195
0:12:04.333,000 --> 0:12:06,000
This is generating anger and resentment,

196
0:12:07.042,000 --> 0:12:09,000
especially in Islamic societies.

197
0:12:09.375,000 --> 0:12:14,000
It's also draining the resources and spirits of Western societies.

198
0:12:15.333,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Now I know that the Islamic world

199
0:12:18.583,000 --> 0:12:22,000
is having difficulties modernizing.

200
0:12:22.75,000 --> 0:12:25,000
It will have to find its way,

201
0:12:26.292,000 --> 0:12:3,000
but it's more likely to do so if it is left alone to do so.

202
0:12:31.083,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Now I can say this with some conviction because I come from a region,

203
0:12:35.708,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Southeast Asia,

204
0:12:37.458,000 --> 0:12:41,000
which has almost as many Muslims as the Arab world.

205
0:12:42.042,000 --> 0:12:44,000
266 million Muslims.

206
0:12:44.292,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Southeast Asia is also one of the most diverse continents on planet earth,

207
0:12:47.875,000 --> 0:12:49,000
because you also have 146 million Christians,

208
0:12:50.583,000 --> 0:12:51,000
149 million Buddhists --

209
0:12:52.417,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Mahayana Buddhists and Hinayana Buddhists --

210
0:12:55.5,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and you also have millions of Taoists and Confucianists and Hindus

211
0:12:59.5,000 --> 0:13:,000
and even communists.

212
0:13:02.5,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And once known as "the Balkans of Asia,"

213
0:13:05.417,000 --> 0:13:09,000
southeast Asia today should be experiencing a clash of civilizations.

214
0:13:10.25,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Instead, what you see in southeast Asia

215
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:18,000
is one of the most peaceful and prosperous corners of planet earth

216
0:13:18.208,000 --> 0:13:22,000
with the second-most successful regional multilateral organization,

217
0:13:22.375,000 --> 0:13:23,000
ASEAN.

218
0:13:23.958,000 --> 0:13:25,000
So clearly, minimalism can work.

219
0:13:26.833,000 --> 0:13:27,000
The West should try it out.

220
0:13:28.375,000 --> 0:13:3,000
(Laughter)

221
0:13:30.75,000 --> 0:13:33,000
(Applause)

222
0:13:35.292,000 --> 0:13:38,000
But I'm also aware that minimalism cannot solve all the problems.

223
0:13:39.167,000 --> 0:13:42,000
There are some hard problems that have to be dealt with:

224
0:13:42.583,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Al-Qaeda, ISIS --

225
0:13:44.667,000 --> 0:13:46,000
they remain dangerous threats.

226
0:13:47.125,000 --> 0:13:5,000
They must be found, they must be destroyed.

227
0:13:50.167,000 --> 0:13:53,000
The question is, is it wise for the West,

228
0:13:54,000 --> 0:13:57,000
which represents 12 percent of the world's population --

229
0:13:57.25,000 --> 0:13:58,000
yes, 12 percent --

230
0:13:59.208,000 --> 0:14:01,000
to fight these threats on its own

231
0:14:01.708,000 --> 0:14:05,000
or to fight with the remaining 88 percent of the world's population?

232
0:14:05.917,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And the logical and rational answer is

233
0:14:08.292,000 --> 0:14:11,000
that you should work with the remaining 88 percent.

234
0:14:11.667,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Now where does one go

235
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:15,000
if you want to get the support of humanity?

236
0:14:15.167,000 --> 0:14:16,000
There's only one place:

237
0:14:17,000 --> 0:14:18,000
the United Nations.

238
0:14:19.042,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Now I've been ambassador to the UN twice.

239
0:14:22.417,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Maybe that makes me a bit biased,

240
0:14:25.458,000 --> 0:14:3,000
but I can tell you that working with the UN can lead to success.

241
0:14:30.542,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Why is it that the first Iraq war,

242
0:14:32.792,000 --> 0:14:34,000
fought by President George H. W. Bush,

243
0:14:35.042,000 --> 0:14:36,000
succeeded?

244
0:14:36.708,000 --> 0:14:37,000
While the second Iraq war,

245
0:14:38.333,000 --> 0:14:4,000
fought by his son, President George W. Bush,

246
0:14:41.25,000 --> 0:14:42,000
failed?

247
0:14:42.625,000 --> 0:14:46,000
One key reason is that the senior Bush went to the UN

248
0:14:47.042,000 --> 0:14:49,000
to get the support of the global community

249
0:14:49.625,000 --> 0:14:51,000
before fighting the war in Iraq.

250
0:14:52.25,000 --> 0:14:54,000
So multilateralism works.

251
0:14:55,000 --> 0:14:57,000
There's another reason why we have to work with the UN.

252
0:14:57.958,000 --> 0:14:58,000
The world is shrinking.

253
0:14:59.875,000 --> 0:15:04,000
We are becoming a small, interdependent, global village.

254
0:15:05.417,000 --> 0:15:08,000
All villages need village councils.

255
0:15:09.042,000 --> 0:15:11,000
And the only global village counsel we have,

256
0:15:11.75,000 --> 0:15:14,000
as the late UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said,

257
0:15:15.25,000 --> 0:15:16,000
is the UN.

258
0:15:18.583,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Now as a geopolitical analyst,

259
0:15:21.667,000 --> 0:15:26,000
I do know that it's often considered naive

260
0:15:27.542,000 --> 0:15:29,000
to work with the UN.

261
0:15:29.625,000 --> 0:15:32,000
So now let me inject my Machiavellian point.

262
0:15:34.458,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Now Machiavelli is a figure who's often derided in the West,

263
0:15:39.583,000 --> 0:15:44,000
but the liberal philosopher Isaiah Berlin reminded us

264
0:15:45.375,000 --> 0:15:51,000
that the goal of Machiavelli was to promote virtue, not evil.

265
0:15:51.792,000 --> 0:15:53,000
So what is the Machiavellian point?

266
0:15:54.583,000 --> 0:15:58,000
It's this: what is the best way for the West

267
0:15:59,000 --> 0:16:02,000
to constrain the new rising powers

268
0:16:02.458,000 --> 0:16:03,000
that are emerging?

269
0:16:04.333,000 --> 0:16:08,000
And the answer is that the best way to constrain them

270
0:16:08.917,000 --> 0:16:12,000
is through multilateral rules and multilateral norms,

271
0:16:13.458,000 --> 0:16:15,000
multilateral institutions

272
0:16:15.542,000 --> 0:16:17,000
and multilateral processes.

273
0:16:20.542,000 --> 0:16:24,000
Now let me conclude with one final, big message.

274
0:16:25.375,000 --> 0:16:27,000
As a longtime friend of the West,

275
0:16:27.958,000 --> 0:16:33,000
I'm acutely aware of how pessimistic Western societies have become.

276
0:16:34.583,000 --> 0:16:4,000
Many in the West don't believe that a great future lies ahead for them,

277
0:16:40.708,000 --> 0:16:43,000
that their children will not have better lives.

278
0:16:44.167,000 --> 0:16:5,000
So please do not fear the future or the rest of the world.

279
0:16:51.75,000 --> 0:16:54,000
Now I can say this with some conviction,

280
0:16:54.958,000 --> 0:16:58,000
because as a Hindu Sindhi,

281
0:16:59.083,000 --> 0:17:03,000
I actually feel a direct cultural connection

282
0:17:03.708,000 --> 0:17:06,000
with society's diverse cultures

283
0:17:06.792,000 --> 0:17:11,000
and societies all the way from Tehran to Tokyo.

284
0:17:14.042,000 --> 0:17:19,000
And more than half of humanity lives in this space,

285
0:17:19.333,000 --> 0:17:21,000
so with this direct cultural connection,

286
0:17:22.291,000 --> 0:17:24,000
I can say with great conviction

287
0:17:25.083,000 --> 0:17:31,000
that if the West chooses to adopt a wiser strategy

288
0:17:31.125,000 --> 0:17:36,000
of being minimalist, multilateral and Machiavellian,

289
0:17:36.166,000 --> 0:17:4,000
the rest of the world will be happy to work with the West.

290
0:17:40.583,000 --> 0:17:44,000
So a great future lies ahead for humanity.

291
0:17:45.25,000 --> 0:17:47,000
Let's embrace it together.

292
0:17:47.625,000 --> 0:17:48,000
Thank you.

293
0:17:48.917,000 --> 0:17:51,000
(Applause)

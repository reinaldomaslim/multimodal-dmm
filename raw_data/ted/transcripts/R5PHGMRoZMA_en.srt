1
0:00:12.788,000 --> 0:00:13,000
You may not realize this,

2
0:00:14.533,000 --> 0:00:18,000
but there are more bacteria in your body than stars in our entire galaxy.

3
0:00:20.04,000 --> 0:00:23,000
This fascinating universe of bacteria inside of us

4
0:00:23.167,000 --> 0:00:25,000
is an integral part of our health,

5
0:00:25.443,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and our technology is evolving so rapidly

6
0:00:27.532,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that today we can program these bacteria like we program computers.

7
0:00:33.06,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Now, the diagram that you see here,

8
0:00:34.939,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I know it looks like some kind of sports play,

9
0:00:37.47,000 --> 0:00:41,000
but it is actually a blueprint of the first bacterial program I developed.

10
0:00:41.626,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And like writing software, we can print and write DNA

11
0:00:44.947,000 --> 0:00:47,000
into different algorithms and programs inside of bacteria.

12
0:00:48.824,000 --> 0:00:5,000
What this program does is produces fluorescent proteins

13
0:00:51.519,000 --> 0:00:52,000
in a rhythmic fashion

14
0:00:52.957,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and generates a small molecule

15
0:00:54.559,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that allows bacteria to communicate and synchronize,

16
0:00:57.137,000 --> 0:00:58,000
as you're seeing in this movie.

17
0:00:59.505,000 --> 0:01:01,000
The growing colony of bacteria that you see here

18
0:01:01.785,000 --> 0:01:02,000
is about the width of a human hair.

19
0:01:03.778,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Now, what you can't see is that our genetic program

20
0:01:06.285,000 --> 0:01:09,000
instructs these bacteria to each produce small molecules,

21
0:01:09.768,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and these molecules travel between the thousands of individual bacteria

22
0:01:13.181,000 --> 0:01:15,000
telling them when to turn on and off.

23
0:01:15.897,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And the bacteria synchronize quite well at this scale,

24
0:01:19.148,000 --> 0:01:22,000
but because the molecule that synchronizes them together can only travel so fast,

25
0:01:23.142,000 --> 0:01:26,000
in larger colonies of bacteria, this results in traveling waves

26
0:01:26.718,000 --> 0:01:28,000
between bacteria that are far away from each other,

27
0:01:29.62,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and you can see these waves going from right to left across the screen.

28
0:01:33.356,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Now, our genetic program relies on a natural phenomenon

29
0:01:36.144,000 --> 0:01:37,000
called quorum sensing,

30
0:01:37.317,000 --> 0:01:4,000
in which bacteria trigger coordinated and sometimes virulent behaviors

31
0:01:40.649,000 --> 0:01:42,000
once they reach a critical density.

32
0:01:43.59,000 --> 0:01:45,000
You can observe quorum sensing in action in this movie,

33
0:01:46.245,000 --> 0:01:49,000
where a growing colony of bacteria only begins to glow

34
0:01:49.887,000 --> 0:01:51,000
once it reaches a high or critical density.

35
0:01:52.258,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Our genetic program

36
0:01:54.1,000 --> 0:01:57,000
continues producing these rhythmic patterns of fluorescent proteins

37
0:01:57.251,000 --> 0:01:59,000
as the colony grows outwards.

38
0:01:59.619,000 --> 0:02:02,000
This particular movie and experiment we call The Supernova,

39
0:02:03.31,000 --> 0:02:06,000
because it looks like an exploding star.

40
0:02:06.34,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Now, besides programming these beautiful patterns,

41
0:02:08.73,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I wondered, what else can we get these bacteria to do?

42
0:02:11.321,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And I decided to explore how we can program bacteria

43
0:02:13.9,000 --> 0:02:15,000
to detect and treat diseases in our bodies like cancer.

44
0:02:18.009,000 --> 0:02:2,000
One of the surprising facts about bacteria

45
0:02:20.307,000 --> 0:02:23,000
is that they can naturally grow inside of tumors.

46
0:02:23.744,000 --> 0:02:24,000
This happens because typically tumors

47
0:02:25.508,000 --> 0:02:27,000
are areas where the immune system has no access,

48
0:02:27.923,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and so bacteria find these tumors

49
0:02:29.92,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and use them as a safe haven to grow and thrive.

50
0:02:33.751,000 --> 0:02:34,000
We started using probiotic bacteria

51
0:02:35.585,000 --> 0:02:37,000
which are safe bacteria that have a health benefit,

52
0:02:38.209,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and found that when orally delivered to mice,

53
0:02:40.67,000 --> 0:02:44,000
these probiotics would selectively grow inside of liver tumors.

54
0:02:44.826,000 --> 0:02:45,000
We realized that the most convenient way

55
0:02:46.78,000 --> 0:02:48,000
to highlight the presence of the probiotics,

56
0:02:48.861,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and hence, the presence of the tumors,

57
0:02:50.724,000 --> 0:02:52,000
was to get these bacteria to produce a signal

58
0:02:52.953,000 --> 0:02:54,000
that would be detectable in the urine,

59
0:02:55.069,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and so we specifically programmed these probiotics

60
0:02:57.481,000 --> 0:02:59,000
to make a molecule that would change the color of your urine

61
0:03:00.36,000 --> 0:03:02,000
to indicate the presence of cancer.

62
0:03:03.17,000 --> 0:03:05,000
We went on to show that this technology

63
0:03:05.18,000 --> 0:03:08,000
could sensitively and specifically detect liver cancer,

64
0:03:08.37,000 --> 0:03:1,000
one that is challenging to detect otherwise.

65
0:03:11.891,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Now, since these bacteria specifically localize to tumors,

66
0:03:14.89,000 --> 0:03:16,000
we've been programming them to not only detect cancer

67
0:03:17.478,000 --> 0:03:18,000
but also to treat cancer

68
0:03:19.266,000 --> 0:03:22,000
by producing therapeutic molecules from within the tumor environment

69
0:03:22.493,000 --> 0:03:24,000
that shrink the existing tumors,

70
0:03:24.815,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and we've been doing this using quorum sensing programs

71
0:03:27.57,000 --> 0:03:28,000
like you saw in the previous movies.

72
0:03:29.413,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Altogether, imagine in the future taking a programmed probiotic

73
0:03:33.11,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that could detect and treat cancer,

74
0:03:35.589,000 --> 0:03:37,000
or even other diseases.

75
0:03:38.96,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Our ability to program bacteria

76
0:03:40.604,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and program life

77
0:03:42.299,000 --> 0:03:44,000
opens up new horizons in cancer research,

78
0:03:45.248,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and to share this vision, I worked with artist Vik Muniz

79
0:03:47.983,000 --> 0:03:48,000
to create the symbol of the universe,

80
0:03:49.799,000 --> 0:03:52,000
made entirely out of bacteria or cancer cells.

81
0:03:53.443,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Ultimately, my hope is that the beauty and purpose of this microscopic universe

82
0:03:58.645,000 --> 0:04:02,000
can inspire new and creative approaches for the future of cancer research.

83
0:04:03.544,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Thank you.

84
0:04:06.168,000 --> 0:04:09,000

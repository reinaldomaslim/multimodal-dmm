1
0:00:13.206,000 --> 0:00:18,000
(Music)

2
0:00:26.325,000 --> 0:00:3,000
These bees are in my backyard in Berkeley, California.

3
0:00:30.822,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Until last year, I'd never kept bees before,

4
0:00:33.221,000 --> 0:00:37,000
but National Geographic asked me to photograph a story about them,

5
0:00:37.27,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and I decided, to be able to take compelling images,

6
0:00:39.769,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I should start keeping bees myself.

7
0:00:42.253,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And as you may know,

8
0:00:43.948,000 --> 0:00:45,000
bees pollinate one third of our food crops,

9
0:00:46.572,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and lately they've been having a really hard time.

10
0:00:49.73,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So as a photographer, I wanted to explore what this problem really looks like.

11
0:00:54.281,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So I'm going to show you what I found over the last year.

12
0:00:58.276,000 --> 0:00:59,000
This furry little creature

13
0:00:59.9,000 --> 0:01:03,000
is a fresh young bee halfway emerged from its brood cell,

14
0:01:04.243,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and bees right now are dealing with several different problems,

15
0:01:07.283,000 --> 0:01:11,000
including pesticides, diseases, and habitat loss,

16
0:01:11.535,000 --> 0:01:15,000
but the single greatest threat is a parasitic mite from Asia,

17
0:01:16.146,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Varroa destructor.

18
0:01:18.475,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And this pinhead-sized mite crawls onto young bees

19
0:01:21.354,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and sucks their blood.

20
0:01:23.699,000 --> 0:01:24,000
This eventually destroys a hive

21
0:01:25.696,000 --> 0:01:28,000
because it weakens the immune system of the bees,

22
0:01:28.94,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and it makes them more vulnerable to stress and disease.

23
0:01:33.776,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Now, bees are the most sensitive

24
0:01:35.773,000 --> 0:01:37,000
when they're developing inside their brood cells,

25
0:01:38.513,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and I wanted to know what that process really looks like,

26
0:01:41.624,000 --> 0:01:43,000
so I teamed up with a bee lab at U.C. Davis

27
0:01:44.248,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and figured out how to raise bees in front of a camera.

28
0:01:47.993,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I'm going to show you the first 21 days of a bee's life

29
0:01:50.981,000 --> 0:01:52,000
condensed into 60 seconds.

30
0:01:55.763,000 --> 0:01:59,000
This is a bee egg as it hatches into a larva,

31
0:02:00.567,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and those newly hatched larvae swim around their cells

32
0:02:05.012,000 --> 0:02:09,000
feeding on this white goo that nurse bees secrete for them.

33
0:02:11.616,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Then, their head and their legs slowly differentiate

34
0:02:16.159,000 --> 0:02:19,000
as they transform into pupae.

35
0:02:21.833,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Here's that same pupation process,

36
0:02:23.853,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and you can actually see the mites running around in the cells.

37
0:02:27.243,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Then the tissue in their body reorganizes

38
0:02:31.51,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and the pigment slowly develops in their eyes.

39
0:02:38.869,000 --> 0:02:43,000
The last step of the process is their skin shrivels up

40
0:02:44.757,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and they sprout hair.

41
0:02:47.245,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Music)

42
0:03:00.805,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So -- (Applause)

43
0:03:06.703,000 --> 0:03:09,000
As you can see halfway through that video,

44
0:03:09.907,000 --> 0:03:11,000
the mites were running around on the baby bees,

45
0:03:12.461,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and the way that beekeepers typically manage these mites

46
0:03:16.39,000 --> 0:03:19,000
is they treat their hives with chemicals.

47
0:03:19.404,000 --> 0:03:21,000
In the long run, that's bad news,

48
0:03:21.67,000 --> 0:03:24,000
so researchers are working on finding alternatives

49
0:03:25.223,000 --> 0:03:27,000
to control these mites.

50
0:03:28.195,000 --> 0:03:3,000
This is one of those alternatives.

51
0:03:30.963,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It's an experimental breeding program at the USDA Bee Lab in Baton Rouge,

52
0:03:35.328,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and this queen and her attendant bees are part of that program.

53
0:03:39.735,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Now, the researchers figured out

54
0:03:43.43,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that some of the bees have a natural ability to fight mites,

55
0:03:47.152,000 --> 0:03:51,000
so they set out to breed a line of mite-resistant bees.

56
0:03:52.782,000 --> 0:03:54,000
This is what it takes to breed bees in a lab.

57
0:03:55.418,000 --> 0:03:57,000
The virgin queen is sedated

58
0:03:58.158,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and then artificially inseminated using this precision instrument.

59
0:04:03.2,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Now, this procedure allows the researchers

60
0:04:05.478,000 --> 0:04:1,000
to control exactly which bees are being crossed,

61
0:04:10.5,000 --> 0:04:13,000
but there's a tradeoff in having this much control.

62
0:04:13.627,000 --> 0:04:16,000
They succeeded in breeding mite-resistant bees,

63
0:04:16.832,000 --> 0:04:19,000
but in that process, those bees started to lose traits

64
0:04:19.92,000 --> 0:04:22,000
like their gentleness and their ability to store honey,

65
0:04:23.685,000 --> 0:04:25,000
so to overcome that problem,

66
0:04:26.194,000 --> 0:04:29,000
these researchers are now collaborating with commercial beekeepers.

67
0:04:30.252,000 --> 0:04:34,000
This is Bret Adee opening one of his 72,000 beehives.

68
0:04:35.12,000 --> 0:04:39,000
He and his brother run the largest beekeeping operation in the world,

69
0:04:39.75,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and the USDA is integrating their mite-resistant bees into his operation

70
0:04:45.409,000 --> 0:04:46,000
with the hope that over time,

71
0:04:47.052,000 --> 0:04:5,000
they'll be able to select the bees that are not only mite-resistant

72
0:04:50.723,000 --> 0:04:54,000
but also retain all of these qualities that make them useful to us.

73
0:04:56.165,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And to say it like that

74
0:04:57.86,000 --> 0:05:,000
makes it sound like we're manipulating and exploiting bees,

75
0:05:01.157,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and the truth is, we've been doing that for thousands of years.

76
0:05:04.593,000 --> 0:05:09,000
We took this wild creature and put it inside of a box,

77
0:05:09.747,000 --> 0:05:11,000
practically domesticating it,

78
0:05:11.861,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and originally that was so that we could harvest their honey,

79
0:05:15.97,000 --> 0:05:17,000
but over time we started losing our native pollinators,

80
0:05:18.725,000 --> 0:05:19,000
our wild pollinators,

81
0:05:20.42,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and there are many places now where those wild pollinators

82
0:05:23.485,000 --> 0:05:26,000
can no longer meet the pollination demands of our agriculture,

83
0:05:27.284,000 --> 0:05:32,000
so these managed bees have become an integral part of our food system.

84
0:05:32.508,000 --> 0:05:34,000
So when people talk about saving bees,

85
0:05:35.227,000 --> 0:05:37,000
my interpretation of that

86
0:05:37.36,000 --> 0:05:4,000
is we need to save our relationship to bees,

87
0:05:40.588,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and in order to design new solutions,

88
0:05:45.592,000 --> 0:05:5,000
we have to understand the basic biology of bees

89
0:05:50.693,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and understand the effects of stressors that we sometimes cannot see.

90
0:05:57.909,000 --> 0:06:,000
In other words, we have to understand bees up close.

91
0:06:01.114,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Thank you.

92
0:06:03.384,000 --> 0:06:04,000
(Applause)

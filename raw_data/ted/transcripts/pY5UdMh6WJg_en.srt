1
0:00:13.409,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Every other night in Japan,

2
0:00:16.375,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I step out of my apartment,

3
0:00:18.426,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I climb up a hill for 15 minutes,

4
0:00:21.954,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and then I head into my local health club,

5
0:00:25.628,000 --> 0:00:29,000
where three ping-pong tables are set up in a studio.

6
0:00:30.178,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And space is limited,

7
0:00:32.177,000 --> 0:00:33,000
so at every table,

8
0:00:33.913,000 --> 0:00:35,000
one pair of players practices forehands,

9
0:00:36.867,000 --> 0:00:38,000
another practices backhands,

10
0:00:39.184,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and every now and then, the balls collide in midair

11
0:00:42.796,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and everybody says, "Wow!"

12
0:00:46.067,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Then, choosing lots, we select partners and play doubles.

13
0:00:51.891,000 --> 0:00:53,000
But I honestly couldn't tell you who's won,

14
0:00:54.804,000 --> 0:00:57,000
because we change partners every five minutes.

15
0:00:59.097,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And everybody is trying really hard

16
0:01:02.606,000 --> 0:01:03,000
to win points,

17
0:01:04.067,000 --> 0:01:08,000
but nobody is keeping track of who is winning games.

18
0:01:08.992,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And after an hour or so of furious exertion,

19
0:01:13.253,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I can honestly tell you

20
0:01:14.927,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that not knowing who has won

21
0:01:17.864,000 --> 0:01:19,000
feels like the ultimate victory.

22
0:01:21.8,000 --> 0:01:22,000
In Japan, it's been said,

23
0:01:23.738,000 --> 0:01:27,000
they've created a competitive spirit without competition.

24
0:01:30.178,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Now, all of you know that geopolitics is best followed by watching ping-pong.

25
0:01:37.281,000 --> 0:01:38,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:38.802,000 --> 0:01:42,000
The two strongest powers in the world were fiercest enemies

27
0:01:43.707,000 --> 0:01:47,000
until, in 1972, an American ping-pong team

28
0:01:48.415,000 --> 0:01:51,000
was allowed to visit Communist China.

29
0:01:52.191,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And as soon as the former adversaries

30
0:01:54.73,000 --> 0:01:57,000
were gathered around some small green tables,

31
0:01:58.739,000 --> 0:02:,000
each of them could claim a victory,

32
0:02:01.368,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and the whole world could breathe more easily.

33
0:02:05.32,000 --> 0:02:07,000
China's leader, Mao Zedong,

34
0:02:07.625,000 --> 0:02:1,000
wrote a whole manual on ping-pong,

35
0:02:10.987,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and he called the sport "a spiritual nuclear weapon."

36
0:02:16.078,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And it's been said that the only honorary lifelong member

37
0:02:20.012,000 --> 0:02:22,000
of the US Table Tennis Association

38
0:02:22.836,000 --> 0:02:24,000
is the then-President Richard Nixon,

39
0:02:25.709,000 --> 0:02:28,000
who helped to engineer this win-win situation

40
0:02:29.446,000 --> 0:02:31,000
through ping-pong diplomacy.

41
0:02:33.318,000 --> 0:02:34,000
But long before that,

42
0:02:34.795,000 --> 0:02:36,000
really, the history of the modern world

43
0:02:37.422,000 --> 0:02:41,000
was best told through the bouncing white ball.

44
0:02:42.461,000 --> 0:02:45,000
"Ping-pong" sounds like a cousin of "sing-song,"

45
0:02:46.165,000 --> 0:02:48,000
like something Eastern,

46
0:02:48.287,000 --> 0:02:53,000
but actually, it's believed that it was invented by high-class Brits

47
0:02:53.527,000 --> 0:02:54,000
during Victorian times,

48
0:02:55.321,000 --> 0:03:,000
who started hitting wine corks over walls of books after dinner.

49
0:03:00.415,000 --> 0:03:01,000
(Laughter)

50
0:03:01.488,000 --> 0:03:02,000
No exaggeration.

51
0:03:02.694,000 --> 0:03:03,000
(Laughter)

52
0:03:03.788,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And by the end of World War I,

53
0:03:05.774,000 --> 0:03:1,000
the sport was dominated by players from the former Austro-Hungarian Empire:

54
0:03:11.495,000 --> 0:03:14,000
eight out of nine early world championships

55
0:03:14.555,000 --> 0:03:15,000
were claimed by Hungary.

56
0:03:16.844,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And Eastern Europeans grew so adept

57
0:03:19.726,000 --> 0:03:22,000
at hitting back everything that was hit at them

58
0:03:23.099,000 --> 0:03:26,000
that they almost brought the whole sport to a standstill.

59
0:03:27.266,000 --> 0:03:31,000
In one championship match in Prague in 1936,

60
0:03:31.902,000 --> 0:03:36,000
the first point is said to have lasted two hours and 12 minutes.

61
0:03:37.662,000 --> 0:03:38,000
The first point!

62
0:03:38.936,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Longer than a "Mad Max" movie.

63
0:03:41.709,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And according to one of the players, the umpire had to retire with a sore neck

64
0:03:47.745,000 --> 0:03:49,000
before the point was concluded.

65
0:03:49.808,000 --> 0:03:5,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:50.849,000 --> 0:03:53,000
That player started hitting the ball back with his left hand

67
0:03:54.737,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and dictating chess moves between shots.

68
0:03:57.555,000 --> 0:03:58,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:58.604,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Many in the audience started, of course, filing out,

70
0:04:01.914,000 --> 0:04:05,000
as that single point lasted maybe 12,000 strokes.

71
0:04:06.727,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And an emergency meeting of the International Table Tennis Association

72
0:04:11.807,000 --> 0:04:13,000
had to be held then and there,

73
0:04:14.509,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and soon the rules were changed

74
0:04:16.688,000 --> 0:04:19,000
so that no game could last longer than 20 minutes.

75
0:04:20.537,000 --> 0:04:21,000
(Laughter)

76
0:04:22.97,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Sixteen years later, Japan entered the picture,

77
0:04:26.409,000 --> 0:04:3,000
when a little-known watchmaker called Hiroji Satoh

78
0:04:30.822,000 --> 0:04:35,000
showed up at the world championships in Bombay in 1952.

79
0:04:36.647,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And Satoh was not very big, he wasn't highly rated,

80
0:04:40.941,000 --> 0:04:42,000
he was wearing spectacles,

81
0:04:43.377,000 --> 0:04:47,000
but he was armed with a paddle that was not pimpled,

82
0:04:48.243,000 --> 0:04:49,000
as other paddles were,

83
0:04:49.967,000 --> 0:04:53,000
but covered by a thick spongy rubber foam.

84
0:04:54.853,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And thanks to this silencing secret weapon,

85
0:04:59.129,000 --> 0:05:02,000
the little-known Satoh won a gold medal.

86
0:05:02.954,000 --> 0:05:06,000
One million people came out into the streets of Tokyo

87
0:05:07.098,000 --> 0:05:09,000
to greet him upon his return,

88
0:05:09.531,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and really, Japan's postwar resurgence was set into motion.

89
0:05:16.072,000 --> 0:05:21,000
What I learned, though, at my regular games in Japan,

90
0:05:21.254,000 --> 0:05:27,000
is more what could be called the inner sport of global domination,

91
0:05:27.341,000 --> 0:05:29,000
sometimes known as life.

92
0:05:30.85,000 --> 0:05:33,000
We never play singles in our club,

93
0:05:34.016,000 --> 0:05:35,000
only doubles,

94
0:05:35.387,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and because, as I say, we change partners every five minutes,

95
0:05:39.963,000 --> 0:05:42,000
if you do happen to lose, you're very likely to win

96
0:05:43.639,000 --> 0:05:44,000
six minutes later.

97
0:05:45.789,000 --> 0:05:47,000
We also play best-of-two sets,

98
0:05:48.765,000 --> 0:05:5,000
so often, there's no loser at all.

99
0:05:52.026,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Ping-pong diplomacy.

100
0:05:54.298,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And I always remember that as a boy growing up in England,

101
0:05:57.615,000 --> 0:06:,000
I was taught that the point of a game was to win.

102
0:06:02.067,000 --> 0:06:07,000
But in Japan, I'm encouraged to believe that, really, the point of a game

103
0:06:07.447,000 --> 0:06:12,000
is to make as many people as possible around you feel that they are winners.

104
0:06:13.187,000 --> 0:06:16,000
So you're not careening up and down as an individual might,

105
0:06:16.556,000 --> 0:06:19,000
but you're part of a regular, steady chorus.

106
0:06:21.306,000 --> 0:06:24,000
The most skillful players in our club

107
0:06:25.282,000 --> 0:06:29,000
deploy their skills to turn a 9-1 lead for their team

108
0:06:29.861,000 --> 0:06:34,000
into a 9-9 game in which everybody is intensely involved.

109
0:06:34.961,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And my friend who hits these high, looping lobs

110
0:06:39.486,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that smaller players flail at and miss --

111
0:06:43.467,000 --> 0:06:47,000
well, he wins a lot of points, but I think he's thought of as a loser.

112
0:06:48.641,000 --> 0:06:53,000
In Japan, a game of ping-pong is really like an act of love.

113
0:06:54.264,000 --> 0:06:56,000
You're learning how to play with somebody,

114
0:06:56.63,000 --> 0:06:57,000
rather than against her.

115
0:06:59.343,000 --> 0:07:,000
And I'll confess,

116
0:07:00.517,000 --> 0:07:04,000
at first, this seemed to me to take all the fun out of the sport.

117
0:07:05.335,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I couldn't exult after a tremendous upset victory against our strongest players,

118
0:07:10.581,000 --> 0:07:12,000
because six minutes later, with a new partner,

119
0:07:13.096,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I was falling behind again.

120
0:07:15.914,000 --> 0:07:18,000
On the other hand, I never felt disconsolate.

121
0:07:20.476,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And when I flew away from Japan and started playing singles again

122
0:07:24.685,000 --> 0:07:27,000
with my English archrival,

123
0:07:27.811,000 --> 0:07:32,000
I noticed that after every defeat, I was really brokenhearted.

124
0:07:33.953,000 --> 0:07:36,000
But after every victory, I couldn't sleep either,

125
0:07:37.248,000 --> 0:07:39,000
because I knew there was only one way to go,

126
0:07:39.695,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and that was down.

127
0:07:43.398,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Now, if I were trying to do business in Japan,

128
0:07:47.168,000 --> 0:07:49,000
this would lead to endless frustration.

129
0:07:51.136,000 --> 0:07:53,000
In Japan, unlike elsewhere,

130
0:07:53.335,000 --> 0:07:56,000
if the score is still level after four hours,

131
0:07:56.835,000 --> 0:07:59,000
a baseball game ends in a tie,

132
0:08:00.501,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and because the league standings are based on winning percentage,

133
0:08:05.169,000 --> 0:08:08,000
a team with quite a few ties can finish ahead

134
0:08:08.502,000 --> 0:08:1,000
of a team with more victories.

135
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:15,000
One of the first times an American was ever brought over to Japan

136
0:08:15.857,000 --> 0:08:18,000
to lead a professional Japanese baseball team,

137
0:08:19.388,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Bobby Valentine, in 1995,

138
0:08:22.106,000 --> 0:08:24,000
he took this really mediocre squad,

139
0:08:24.733,000 --> 0:08:27,000
he lead them to a stunning second-place finish,

140
0:08:28.068,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and he was instantly fired.

141
0:08:30.55,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Why?

142
0:08:31.725,000 --> 0:08:33,000
"Well," said the team spokesman,

143
0:08:33.93,000 --> 0:08:35,000
"because of his emphasis on winning."

144
0:08:37.185,000 --> 0:08:38,000
(Laughter)

145
0:08:38.217,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Official Japan can feel quite a lot like that point

146
0:08:41.512,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that was said to last two hours and 12 minutes,

147
0:08:45.275,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and playing not to lose

148
0:08:47.557,000 --> 0:08:52,000
can take all the imagination, the daring, the excitement, out of things.

149
0:08:54.444,000 --> 0:08:57,000
At the same time, playing ping-pong in Japan

150
0:08:58.271,000 --> 0:09:03,000
reminds me why choirs regularly enjoy more fun

151
0:09:03.374,000 --> 0:09:04,000
than soloists.

152
0:09:05.866,000 --> 0:09:1,000
In a choir, your only job is to play your small part perfectly,

153
0:09:11.644,000 --> 0:09:13,000
to hit your notes with feeling,

154
0:09:14.431,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and by so doing, to help to create a beautiful harmony

155
0:09:18.559,000 --> 0:09:21,000
that's much greater than the sum of its parts.

156
0:09:23.19,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Yes, every choir does need a conductor,

157
0:09:26.177,000 --> 0:09:32,000
but I think a choir releases you from a child's simple sense of either-ors.

158
0:09:33.858,000 --> 0:09:36,000
You come to see that the opposite of winning isn't losing --

159
0:09:38.44,000 --> 0:09:4,000
it's failing to see the larger picture.

160
0:09:43.753,000 --> 0:09:45,000
As my life goes on,

161
0:09:46.721,000 --> 0:09:5,000
I'm really startled to see that no event

162
0:09:50.881,000 --> 0:09:54,000
can properly be assessed for years after it has unfolded.

163
0:09:57.282,000 --> 0:10:,000
I once lost everything I owned in the world,

164
0:10:01.07,000 --> 0:10:03,000
every last thing, in a wildfire.

165
0:10:05.275,000 --> 0:10:09,000
But in time, I came to see that it was that seeming loss

166
0:10:09.917,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that allowed me to live on the earth more gently,

167
0:10:13.876,000 --> 0:10:15,000
to write without notes,

168
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and actually, to move to Japan

169
0:10:18.983,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and the inner health club known as the ping-pong table.

170
0:10:23.427,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Conversely, I once stumbled into the perfect job,

171
0:10:28.022,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and I came to see that seeming happiness

172
0:10:31.078,000 --> 0:10:34,000
can stand in the way of true joy

173
0:10:34.228,000 --> 0:10:36,000
even more than misery does.

174
0:10:37.825,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Playing doubles in Japan really relieves me of all my anxiety,

175
0:10:43.222,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and at the end of an evening,

176
0:10:44.858,000 --> 0:10:5,000
I notice everybody is filing out in a more or less equal state of delight.

177
0:10:52.497,000 --> 0:10:54,000
I'm reminded every night

178
0:10:54.701,000 --> 0:10:59,000
that not getting ahead isn't the same thing as falling behind

179
0:11:00.525,000 --> 0:11:04,000
any more than not being lively is the same thing as being dead.

180
0:11:06.216,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And I've come to understand why it is

181
0:11:08.676,000 --> 0:11:13,000
that Chinese universities are said to offer degrees in ping-pong,

182
0:11:14.271,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and why researchers have found that ping-pong

183
0:11:17.255,000 --> 0:11:2,000
can actually help a little with mild mental disorders

184
0:11:21.064,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and even autism.

185
0:11:24.205,000 --> 0:11:28,000
But as I watch the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo,

186
0:11:28.919,000 --> 0:11:3,000
I'm going to be keenly aware

187
0:11:31.563,000 --> 0:11:35,000
that it won't be possible to tell who's won or who's lost

188
0:11:35.801,000 --> 0:11:37,000
for a very long time.

189
0:11:39.65,000 --> 0:11:41,000
You remember that point I mentioned

190
0:11:42.004,000 --> 0:11:44,000
that was said to last for two hours and 12 minutes?

191
0:11:45.689,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Well, one of the players from that game ended up, six years later,

192
0:11:50.458,000 --> 0:11:54,000
in the concentration camps of Auschwitz and Dachau.

193
0:11:55.944,000 --> 0:11:56,000
But he walked out alive.

194
0:11:59.145,000 --> 0:12:,000
Why?

195
0:12:00.579,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Simply because a guard in the gas chamber

196
0:12:03.733,000 --> 0:12:06,000
recognized him from his ping-pong playing days.

197
0:12:08.326,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Had he been the winner of that epic match?

198
0:12:11.421,000 --> 0:12:12,000
It hardly mattered.

199
0:12:12.763,000 --> 0:12:17,000
As you recall, many people had filed out before even the first point was concluded.

200
0:12:19.437,000 --> 0:12:21,000
The only thing that saved him

201
0:12:21.966,000 --> 0:12:23,000
was the fact that he took part.

202
0:12:25.464,000 --> 0:12:27,000
The best way to win any game,

203
0:12:27.857,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Japan tells me every other night,

204
0:12:30.675,000 --> 0:12:35,000
is never, never to think about the score.

205
0:12:37.365,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Thank you.

206
0:12:38.54,000 --> 0:12:41,000
(Applause)

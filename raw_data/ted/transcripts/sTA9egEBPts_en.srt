0:00:18.513,000 --> 0:00:21,000
(Video) Newscaster: There's a large path of destruction here in town.

3
0:00:21.855,000 --> 0:00:23,000
... pulling trees from the ground, shattering windows,

4
0:00:24.797,000 --> 0:00:25,000
taking the roofs off of homes ...

5
0:00:27.637,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Caitria O'Neill: That was me

6
0:00:29.696,000 --> 0:00:32,000
in front of our house in Monson, Massachusetts last June.

7
0:00:33.077,000 --> 0:00:36,000
After an EF3 tornado ripped straight through our town

8
0:00:36.442,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and took parts of our roof off,

9
0:00:37.945,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I decided to stay in Massachusetts,

10
0:00:40.014,000 --> 0:00:41,000
instead of pursuing the master's program

11
0:00:41.943,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I had moved my boxes home that afternoon for.

12
0:00:45.166,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Morgan O'Neill: So, on June 1, we weren't disaster experts,

13
0:00:48.021,000 --> 0:00:5,000
but on June 3, we started faking it.

14
0:00:50.119,000 --> 0:00:52,000
This experience changed our lives,

15
0:00:52.149,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and now we're trying to change the experience.

16
0:00:54.61,000 --> 0:00:56,000
CO: So, tornadoes don't happen in Massachusetts,

17
0:00:57.079,000 --> 0:01:,000
and I was cleverly standing in the front yard when one came over the hill.

18
0:01:00.604,000 --> 0:01:03,000
After a lamppost flew by, my family and I sprinted into the basement.

19
0:01:03.928,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Trees were thrown against the house, the windows exploded.

20
0:01:06.848,000 --> 0:01:07,000
When we finally got out the back door,

21
0:01:08.741,000 --> 0:01:09,000
transformers were burning in the street.

22
0:01:11.035,000 --> 0:01:12,000
MO: I was here in Boston.

23
0:01:12.496,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I'm a PhD student at MIT,

24
0:01:14.237,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and I happen to study atmospheric science.

25
0:01:16.943,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Actually, it gets weirder --

26
0:01:18.315,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I was in the museum of science at the time the tornado hit,

27
0:01:21.633,000 --> 0:01:22,000
playing with the tornado display --

28
0:01:23.488,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:24.69,000 --> 0:01:25,000
so I missed her call.

30
0:01:25.865,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I get a call from Caitria, hear the news, and start tracking the radar online

31
0:01:29.633,000 --> 0:01:32,000
to call the family back when another supercell was forming in their area.

32
0:01:33.087,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I drove home late that night with batteries and ice.

33
0:01:35.552,000 --> 0:01:37,000
We live across the street from a historic church

34
0:01:37.889,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that had lost its very iconic steeple in the storm.

35
0:01:40.578,000 --> 0:01:42,000
It had become a community gathering place overnight.

36
0:01:43.067,000 --> 0:01:46,000
The town hall and the police department had also suffered direct hits,

37
0:01:46.395,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and so people wanting to help or needing information went to the church.

38
0:01:50.049,000 --> 0:01:53,000
CO: We walked to the church because we heard they had hot meals,

39
0:01:53.108,000 --> 0:01:54,000
but when we arrived, we found problems.

40
0:01:55.004,000 --> 0:01:57,000
There were a couple large, sweaty men with chainsaws

41
0:01:57.473,000 --> 0:02:,000
standing in the center of the church, but nobody knew where to send them

42
0:02:00.907,000 --> 0:02:02,000
because no one knew the extent of the damage yet.

43
0:02:03.23,000 --> 0:02:05,000
As we watched, they became frustrated and left

44
0:02:05.405,000 --> 0:02:06,000
to go find somebody to help on their own.

45
0:02:07.384,000 --> 0:02:09,000
MO: So we started organizing. Why? It had to be done.

46
0:02:10.067,000 --> 0:02:13,000
We found Pastor Bob and offered to give the response some infrastructure.

47
0:02:13.534,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And then, armed with just two laptops and one air card,

48
0:02:16.73,000 --> 0:02:18,000
we built a recovery machine.

49
0:02:20.748,000 --> 0:02:22,000
(Applause)

50
0:02:23.366,000 --> 0:02:26,000
CO: That was a tornado, and everyone's heading to the church

51
0:02:26.398,000 --> 0:02:27,000
to drop things off and volunteer.

52
0:02:28.088,000 --> 0:02:29,000
MO: Everyone's donating clothing.

53
0:02:29.692,000 --> 0:02:31,000
We should inventory the donations piling up here.

54
0:02:32.11,000 --> 0:02:34,000
CO: And we need a hotline. Can you make a Google Voice number?

55
0:02:35.071,000 --> 0:02:37,000
MO: Sure. And we need to tell people what not to bring.

56
0:02:37.677,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I'll make a Facebook account. Can you print flyers?

57
0:02:40.114,000 --> 0:02:43,000
CO: Yeah, but we don't even know what houses are accepting help.

58
0:02:43.194,000 --> 0:02:45,000
We need to canvas and send out volunteers.

59
0:02:45.223,000 --> 0:02:47,000
MO: We need to tell people what not to bring.

60
0:02:47.36,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Hey, there's a news truck. I'll tell them.

61
0:02:49.388,000 --> 0:02:52,000
CO: You got my number off the news? We don't need more freezers!

62
0:02:52.436,000 --> 0:02:56,000
(Together) MO: Insurance won't cover it? CO: Juice boxes coming in an hour?

63
0:02:56.464,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Together: Someone get me Post-its!

64
0:02:58.112,000 --> 0:02:59,000
(Laughter)

65
0:02:59.137,000 --> 0:03:02,000
CO: And then the rest of the community figured out that we had answers.

66
0:03:02.838,000 --> 0:03:05,000
MO: I can donate three water heaters, but someone needs to come pick them up.

67
0:03:06.503,000 --> 0:03:07,000
CO: My car is in my living room!

68
0:03:08.074,000 --> 0:03:1,000
MO: My boyscout troop would like to rebuild 12 mailboxes.

69
0:03:10.923,000 --> 0:03:12,000
CO: My puppy is missing and insurance doesn't cover chimneys.

70
0:03:13.817,000 --> 0:03:16,000
MO: My church group of 50 would like housing and meals for a week

71
0:03:16.904,000 --> 0:03:17,000
while we repair properties.

72
0:03:18.258,000 --> 0:03:2,000
CO: You sent me to that place on Washington Street yesterday,

73
0:03:21.195,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and now I'm covered in poison ivy.

74
0:03:22.873,000 --> 0:03:23,000
(Laughter)

75
0:03:23.996,000 --> 0:03:24,000
So this is what filled our days.

76
0:03:25.786,000 --> 0:03:27,000
We had to learn how to answer questions quickly

77
0:03:28.024,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and to solve problems in a minute or less;

78
0:03:30.298,000 --> 0:03:32,000
otherwise, something more urgent would come up,

79
0:03:32.522,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and it wouldn't get done.

80
0:03:33.88,000 --> 0:03:35,000
MO: We didn't get our authority from the board of selectmen

81
0:03:36.711,000 --> 0:03:38,000
or the emergency management director or the United Way.

82
0:03:39.591,000 --> 0:03:41,000
We just started answering questions and making decisions

83
0:03:42.241,000 --> 0:03:44,000
because someone -- anyone -- had to.

84
0:03:44.9,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And why not me? I'm a campaign organizer.

85
0:03:47.279,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I'm good at Facebook.

86
0:03:48.471,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And there's two of me.

87
0:03:49.773,000 --> 0:03:5,000
(Laughter)

88
0:03:51.343,000 --> 0:03:54,000
CO: The point is, if there's a flood or a fire or a hurricane,

89
0:03:54.895,000 --> 0:03:55,000
you, or somebody like you,

90
0:03:56.68,000 --> 0:03:58,000
are going to step up and start organizing things.

91
0:03:59.315,000 --> 0:04:01,000
The other point is that it is hard.

92
0:04:01.616,000 --> 0:04:03,000
MO: Lying on the ground after another 17-hour day,

93
0:04:04.331,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Caitria and I would empty our pockets

94
0:04:06.162,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and try to place dozens of scraps of paper into context --

95
0:04:08.95,000 --> 0:04:1,000
all bits of information that had to be remembered and matched

96
0:04:11.84,000 --> 0:04:12,000
in order to help someone.

97
0:04:13.092,000 --> 0:04:15,000
After another day and a shower at the shelter,

98
0:04:15.275,000 --> 0:04:17,000
we realized it shouldn't be this hard.

99
0:04:17.472,000 --> 0:04:19,000
CO: In a country like ours where we breathe Wi-Fi,

100
0:04:20.341,000 --> 0:04:23,000
leveraging technology for a faster recovery should be a no-brainer.

101
0:04:23.896,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Systems like the ones that we were creating on the fly

102
0:04:26.464,000 --> 0:04:27,000
could exist ahead of time.

103
0:04:27.781,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And if some community member is in this organizing position

104
0:04:31.334,000 --> 0:04:33,000
in every area after every disaster,

105
0:04:33.904,000 --> 0:04:34,000
these tools should exist.

106
0:04:36.309,000 --> 0:04:37,000
MO: So, we decided to build them:

107
0:04:38.24,000 --> 0:04:41,000
a recovery in a box, something that could be deployed after every disaster

108
0:04:41.774,000 --> 0:04:42,000
by any local organizer.

109
0:04:43.697,000 --> 0:04:46,000
CO: I decided to stay in the country, give up the master's in Moscow

110
0:04:47.104,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and to work full-time to make this happen.

111
0:04:49.192,000 --> 0:04:5,000
In the course of the past year,

112
0:04:50.709,000 --> 0:04:53,000
we've become experts in the field of community-powered disaster recovery.

113
0:04:54.193,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And there are three main problems that we've observed

114
0:04:56.701,000 --> 0:04:57,000
with the way things work currently.

115
0:04:58.756,000 --> 0:04:59,000
MO: The tools.

116
0:04:59.931,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Large aid organizations are exceptional at bringing massive resources to bear

117
0:05:03.89,000 --> 0:05:04,000
after a disaster,

118
0:05:05.077,000 --> 0:05:08,000
but they often fulfill very specific missions, and then they leave.

119
0:05:08.516,000 --> 0:05:12,000
This leaves local residents to deal with the thousands of spontaneous volunteers,

120
0:05:12.758,000 --> 0:05:13,000
thousands of donations,

121
0:05:13.941,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and all with no training and no tools.

122
0:05:15.972,000 --> 0:05:18,000
So they use Post-its or Excel or Facebook.

123
0:05:19.124,000 --> 0:05:22,000
But none of these tools allow you to value high-priority information

124
0:05:22.362,000 --> 0:05:24,000
amidst all of the photos and well-wishes.

125
0:05:24.855,000 --> 0:05:25,000
CO: The timing.

126
0:05:26.189,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Disaster relief is essentially a backwards political campaign.

127
0:05:29.381,000 --> 0:05:31,000
In a political campaign, you start with no interest

128
0:05:32.127,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and no capacity to turn that into action.

129
0:05:34.333,000 --> 0:05:35,000
You build both gradually,

130
0:05:35.568,000 --> 0:05:38,000
until a moment of peak mobilization at the time of the election.

131
0:05:38.743,000 --> 0:05:4,000
In a disaster, however, you start with all of the interest

132
0:05:41.502,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and none of the capacity.

133
0:05:42.842,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And you've only got about seven days

134
0:05:44.938,000 --> 0:05:47,000
to capture 50 percent of all of the Web searches that will ever be made

135
0:05:48.401,000 --> 0:05:49,000
to help your area.

136
0:05:49.84,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Then some sporting event happens,

137
0:05:51.451,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and you've got only the resources that you've collected thus far

138
0:05:54.491,000 --> 0:05:56,000
to meet the next five years of recovery needs.

139
0:05:57.381,000 --> 0:05:59,000
This is the slide for Katrina.

140
0:06:00.307,000 --> 0:06:02,000
This is the curve for Joplin.

141
0:06:02.77,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And this is the curve for the Dallas tornadoes in April,

142
0:06:05.577,000 --> 0:06:06,000
where we deployed software.

143
0:06:07.255,000 --> 0:06:08,000
There's a gap here.

144
0:06:08.953,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Affected households have to wait for the insurance adjuster to visit

145
0:06:12.186,000 --> 0:06:14,000
before they can start accepting help on their properties.

146
0:06:14.948,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And you've only got about four days of interest in Dallas.

147
0:06:19.089,000 --> 0:06:2,000
MO: Data.

148
0:06:20.444,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Data is inherently unsexy,

149
0:06:22.302,000 --> 0:06:24,000
but it can jump-start an area's recovery.

150
0:06:24.548,000 --> 0:06:27,000
FEMA and the state will pay 85 percent of the cost

151
0:06:27.589,000 --> 0:06:28,000
of a federally-declared disaster,

152
0:06:29.208,000 --> 0:06:31,000
leaving the town to pay the last 15 percent of the bill.

153
0:06:31.873,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Now that expense can be huge,

154
0:06:33.506,000 --> 0:06:36,000
but if the town can mobilize X amount of volunteers for Y hours,

155
0:06:37.484,000 --> 0:06:41,000
the dollar value of that labor used goes toward the town's contribution.

156
0:06:42.349,000 --> 0:06:43,000
But who knows that?

157
0:06:44.042,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Now try to imagine the sinking feeling you get

158
0:06:46.288,000 --> 0:06:49,000
when you've just sent out 2,000 volunteers and you can't prove it.

159
0:06:50.882,000 --> 0:06:52,000
CO: These are three problems with a common solution.

160
0:06:53.343,000 --> 0:06:56,000
If we can get the right tools at the right time

161
0:06:56.396,000 --> 0:06:57,000
to the people who will inevitably step up

162
0:06:58.386,000 --> 0:07:,000
and start putting their communities back together,

163
0:07:00.765,000 --> 0:07:02,000
we can create new standards in disaster recovery.

164
0:07:03.491,000 --> 0:07:05,000
MO: We needed canvasing tools, donations databasing,

165
0:07:06.449,000 --> 0:07:08,000
needs reporting, remote volunteer access,

166
0:07:09.463,000 --> 0:07:1,000
all in an easy-to-use website.

167
0:07:11.334,000 --> 0:07:12,000
CO: And we needed help.

168
0:07:12.795,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Alvin, our software engineer and co-founder, has built these tools.

169
0:07:15.983,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Chris and Bill have volunteered their time to use operations and partnerships.

170
0:07:20.078,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And we've been flying into disaster areas since this past January,

171
0:07:23.594,000 --> 0:07:25,000
setting up software, training residents

172
0:07:25.967,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and licensing the software to areas that are preparing for disasters.

173
0:07:30.229,000 --> 0:07:32,000
MO: One of our first launches was after the Dallas tornadoes

174
0:07:33.079,000 --> 0:07:34,000
this past April.

175
0:07:34.254,000 --> 0:07:36,000
We flew into a town that had a static, outdated website

176
0:07:36.908,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and a frenetic Facebook feed, trying to structure the response,

177
0:07:39.898,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and we launched our platform.

178
0:07:41.31,000 --> 0:07:43,000
All of the interest came in the first four days,

179
0:07:43.576,000 --> 0:07:44,000
but by the time they lost the news cycle,

180
0:07:45.57,000 --> 0:07:46,000
that's when the needs came in,

181
0:07:47.031,000 --> 0:07:5,000
yet they had this massive resource of what people were able to give

182
0:07:50.225,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and they've been able to meet the needs of their residents.

183
0:07:53.013,000 --> 0:07:55,000
CO: So it's working, but it could be better.

184
0:07:55.093,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Emergency preparedness is a big deal in disaster recovery

185
0:07:57.795,000 --> 0:07:59,000
because it makes towns safer and more resilient.

186
0:08:00.068,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Imagine if we could have these systems ready to go in a place

187
0:08:02.983,000 --> 0:08:03,000
before a disaster.

188
0:08:05.232,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So that's what we're working on.

189
0:08:07.064,000 --> 0:08:1,000
We're working on getting the software to places so people expect it,

190
0:08:10.297,000 --> 0:08:11,000
so people know how to use it

191
0:08:11.662,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and so it can be filled ahead of time

192
0:08:13.468,000 --> 0:08:15,000
with that micro-information that drives recovery.

193
0:08:15.874,000 --> 0:08:16,000
MO: It's not rocket science.

194
0:08:17.731,000 --> 0:08:19,000
These tools are obvious and people want them.

195
0:08:19.974,000 --> 0:08:21,000
In our hometown, we trained a half-dozen residents

196
0:08:22.426,000 --> 0:08:23,000
to run these Web tools on their own,

197
0:08:24.172,000 --> 0:08:26,000
because Caitria and I live here, in Boston.

198
0:08:26.384,000 --> 0:08:28,000
They took to it immediately, and now they are forces of nature.

199
0:08:29.384,000 --> 0:08:31,000
There are over three volunteer groups working almost every day,

200
0:08:32.363,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and have been since June 1 of last year,

201
0:08:34.395,000 --> 0:08:37,000
to make sure these residents get what they need and get back in their homes.

202
0:08:38.002,000 --> 0:08:4,000
They have hotlines and spreadsheets and data.

203
0:08:40.349,000 --> 0:08:42,000
CO: And that makes a difference.

204
0:08:42.463,000 --> 0:08:45,000
June 1 this year marked the one-year anniversary of the Monson tornado,

205
0:08:46.341,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and our community's never been more connected or more empowered.

206
0:08:49.658,000 --> 0:08:53,000
We've been able to see the same transformation in Texas and in Alabama.

207
0:08:53.914,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Because it doesn't take Harvard or MIT

208
0:08:55.761,000 --> 0:08:57,000
to fly in and fix problems after a disaster;

209
0:08:57.85,000 --> 0:08:58,000
it takes a local.

210
0:08:59.198,000 --> 0:09:01,000
No matter how good an aid organization is at what they do,

211
0:09:02.077,000 --> 0:09:03,000
they eventually have to go home.

212
0:09:03.776,000 --> 0:09:05,000
But if you give locals the tools,

213
0:09:06.014,000 --> 0:09:08,000
if you show them what they can do to recover,

214
0:09:08.843,000 --> 0:09:09,000
they become experts.

215
0:09:12.267,000 --> 0:09:13,000
(Applause)

216
0:09:13.315,000 --> 0:09:14,000
MO: All right. Let's go.

217
0:09:14.491,000 --> 0:09:17,000
(Applause)

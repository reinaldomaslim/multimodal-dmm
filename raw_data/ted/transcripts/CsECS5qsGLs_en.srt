1
0:00:13.134,000 --> 0:00:17,000
This is a painting from the 16th century from Lucas Cranach the Elder.

2
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It shows the famous Fountain of Youth.

3
0:00:21.308,000 --> 0:00:26,000
If you drink its water or you bathe in it, you will get health and youth.

4
0:00:27.857,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Every culture, every civilization has dreamed of finding eternal youth.

5
0:00:34.044,000 --> 0:00:38,000
There are people like Alexander the Great or Ponce De León, the explorer,

6
0:00:38.82,000 --> 0:00:41,000
who spent much of their life chasing the Fountain of Youth.

7
0:00:42.726,000 --> 0:00:43,000
They didn't find it.

8
0:00:45.45,000 --> 0:00:47,000
But what if there was something to it?

9
0:00:48.074,000 --> 0:00:5,000
What if there was something to this Fountain of Youth?

10
0:00:51.284,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I will share an absolutely amazing development in aging research

11
0:00:56.486,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that could revolutionize the way we think about aging

12
0:01:00.12,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and how we may treat age-related diseases in the future.

13
0:01:04.145,000 --> 0:01:06,000
It started with experiments that showed,

14
0:01:06.678,000 --> 0:01:09,000
in a recent number of studies about growing,

15
0:01:09.996,000 --> 0:01:15,000
that animals -- old mice -- that share a blood supply with young mice

16
0:01:16.021,000 --> 0:01:17,000
can get rejuvenated.

17
0:01:18.148,000 --> 0:01:22,000
This is similar to what you might see in humans, in Siamese twins,

18
0:01:22.781,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and I know this sounds a bit creepy.

19
0:01:25.338,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But what Tom Rando, a stem-cell researcher, reported in 2007,

20
0:01:31.309,000 --> 0:01:34,000
was that old muscle from a mouse can be rejuvenated

21
0:01:34.833,000 --> 0:01:38,000
if it's exposed to young blood through common circulation.

22
0:01:39.903,000 --> 0:01:43,000
This was reproduced by Amy Wagers at Harvard a few years later,

23
0:01:44.57,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and others then showed that similar rejuvenating effects could be observed

24
0:01:49.189,000 --> 0:01:51,000
in the pancreas, the liver and the heart.

25
0:01:52.974,000 --> 0:01:56,000
But what I'm most excited about, and several other labs as well,

26
0:01:57.095,000 --> 0:01:59,000
is that this may even apply to the brain.

27
0:02:00.715,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So, what we found is that an old mouse exposed to a young environment

28
0:02:06.07,000 --> 0:02:09,000
in this model called parabiosis,

29
0:02:09.107,000 --> 0:02:1,000
shows a younger brain --

30
0:02:10.923,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and a brain that functions better.

31
0:02:13.966,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And I repeat:

32
0:02:15.58,000 --> 0:02:21,000
an old mouse that gets young blood through shared circulation

33
0:02:21.817,000 --> 0:02:23,000
looks younger and functions younger in its brain.

34
0:02:25.998,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So when we get older --

35
0:02:27.554,000 --> 0:02:29,000
we can look at different aspects of human cognition,

36
0:02:30.25,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and you can see on this slide here,

37
0:02:32.027,000 --> 0:02:35,000
we can look at reasoning, verbal ability and so forth.

38
0:02:35.899,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And up to around age 50 or 60, these functions are all intact,

39
0:02:41.202,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and as I look at the young audience here in the room, we're all still fine.

40
0:02:45.708,000 --> 0:02:46,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:46.74,000 --> 0:02:49,000
But it's scary to see how all these curves go south.

42
0:02:50.571,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And as we get older,

43
0:02:52.184,000 --> 0:02:56,000
diseases such as Alzheimer's and others may develop.

44
0:02:57.004,000 --> 0:03:,000
We know that with age, the connections between neurons --

45
0:03:00.599,000 --> 0:03:04,000
the way neurons talk to each other, the synapses -- they start to deteriorate;

46
0:03:05.274,000 --> 0:03:08,000
neurons die, the brain starts to shrink,

47
0:03:08.604,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and there's an increased susceptibility for these neurodegenerative diseases.

48
0:03:13.573,000 --> 0:03:17,000
One big problem we have -- to try to understand how this really works

49
0:03:18.506,000 --> 0:03:2,000
at a very molecular mechanistic level --

50
0:03:21.126,000 --> 0:03:25,000
is that we can't study the brains in detail, in living people.

51
0:03:26.033,000 --> 0:03:28,000
We can do cognitive tests, we can do imaging --

52
0:03:29.043,000 --> 0:03:31,000
all kinds of sophisticated testing.

53
0:03:31.763,000 --> 0:03:34,000
But we usually have to wait until the person dies

54
0:03:35.405,000 --> 0:03:4,000
to get the brain and look at how it really changed through age or in a disease.

55
0:03:40.888,000 --> 0:03:43,000
This is what neuropathologists do, for example.

56
0:03:44.333,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So, how about we think of the brain as being part of the larger organism.

57
0:03:50.024,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Could we potentially understand more

58
0:03:52.525,000 --> 0:03:54,000
about what happens in the brain at the molecular level

59
0:03:55.478,000 --> 0:03:58,000
if we see the brain as part of the entire body?

60
0:03:59.088,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So if the body ages or gets sick, does that affect the brain?

61
0:04:03.989,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And vice versa: as the brain gets older, does that influence the rest of the body?

62
0:04:09.05,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And what connects all the different tissues in the body

63
0:04:12.565,000 --> 0:04:13,000
is blood.

64
0:04:14.366,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Blood is the tissue that not only carries cells that transport oxygen, for example,

65
0:04:20.215,000 --> 0:04:21,000
the red blood cells,

66
0:04:21.48,000 --> 0:04:23,000
or fights infectious diseases,

67
0:04:23.704,000 --> 0:04:27,000
but it also carries messenger molecules,

68
0:04:27.999,000 --> 0:04:3,000
hormone-like factors that transport information

69
0:04:31.935,000 --> 0:04:35,000
from one cell to another, from one tissue to another,

70
0:04:36.092,000 --> 0:04:37,000
including the brain.

71
0:04:37.573,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So if we look at how the blood changes in disease or age,

72
0:04:42.735,000 --> 0:04:44,000
can we learn something about the brain?

73
0:04:45.651,000 --> 0:04:49,000
We know that as we get older, the blood changes as well,

74
0:04:50.511,000 --> 0:04:52,000
so these hormone-like factors change as we get older.

75
0:04:53.494,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And by and large, factors that we know are required

76
0:04:57.717,000 --> 0:05:,000
for the development of tissues, for the maintenance of tissues --

77
0:05:01.162,000 --> 0:05:03,000
they start to decrease as we get older,

78
0:05:04.063,000 --> 0:05:08,000
while factors involved in repair, in injury and in inflammation --

79
0:05:08.79,000 --> 0:05:09,000
they increase as we get older.

80
0:05:10.764,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So there's this unbalance of good and bad factors, if you will.

81
0:05:16.988,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And to illustrate what we can do potentially with that,

82
0:05:20.005,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I want to talk you through an experiment that we did.

83
0:05:22.681,000 --> 0:05:25,000
We had almost 300 blood samples from healthy human beings

84
0:05:26.354,000 --> 0:05:28,000
20 to 89 years of age,

85
0:05:28.895,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and we measured over 100 of these communication factors,

86
0:05:32.814,000 --> 0:05:36,000
these hormone-like proteins that transport information between tissues.

87
0:05:37.266,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And what we noticed first

88
0:05:38.966,000 --> 0:05:4,000
is that between the youngest and the oldest group,

89
0:05:41.807,000 --> 0:05:44,000
about half the factors changed significantly.

90
0:05:45.128,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So our body lives in a very different environment as we get older,

91
0:05:48.287,000 --> 0:05:49,000
when it comes to these factors.

92
0:05:50.062,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And using statistical or bioinformatics programs,

93
0:05:53.582,000 --> 0:05:57,000
we could try to discover those factors that best predict age --

94
0:05:58.3,000 --> 0:06:01,000
in a way, back-calculate the relative age of a person.

95
0:06:02.337,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And the way this looks is shown in this graph.

96
0:06:05.618,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So, on the one axis you see the actual age a person lived,

97
0:06:11.011,000 --> 0:06:12,000
the chronological age.

98
0:06:12.34,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So, how many years they lived.

99
0:06:14.086,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And then we take these top factors that I showed you,

100
0:06:16.818,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and we calculate their relative age, their biological age.

101
0:06:22.708,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And what you see is that there is a pretty good correlation,

102
0:06:26.366,000 --> 0:06:29,000
so we can pretty well predict the relative age of a person.

103
0:06:29.705,000 --> 0:06:32,000
But what's really exciting are the outliers,

104
0:06:33.644,000 --> 0:06:34,000
as they so often are in life.

105
0:06:35.922,000 --> 0:06:39,000
You can see here, the person I highlighted with the green dot

106
0:06:40.514,000 --> 0:06:42,000
is about 70 years of age

107
0:06:43.134,000 --> 0:06:48,000
but seems to have a biological age, if what we're doing here is really true,

108
0:06:48.164,000 --> 0:06:5,000
of only about 45.

109
0:06:50.231,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So is this a person that actually looks much younger than their age?

110
0:06:54.183,000 --> 0:06:58,000
But more importantly: Is this a person who is maybe at a reduced risk

111
0:06:58.723,000 --> 0:07:01,000
to develop an age-related disease and will have a long life --

112
0:07:02.071,000 --> 0:07:03,000
will live to 100 or more?

113
0:07:04.402,000 --> 0:07:08,000
On the other hand, the person here, highlighted with the red dot,

114
0:07:08.987,000 --> 0:07:12,000
is not even 40, but has a biological age of 65.

115
0:07:13.917,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Is this a person at an increased risk of developing an age-related disease?

116
0:07:18.339,000 --> 0:07:21,000
So in our lab, we're trying to understand these factors better,

117
0:07:22.019,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and many other groups are trying to understand,

118
0:07:24.281,000 --> 0:07:26,000
what are the true aging factors,

119
0:07:26.381,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and can we learn something about them to possibly predict age-related diseases?

120
0:07:32.281,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So what I've shown you so far is simply correlational, right?

121
0:07:36.367,000 --> 0:07:4,000
You can just say, "Well, these factors change with age,"

122
0:07:40.422,000 --> 0:07:43,000
but you don't really know if they do something about aging.

123
0:07:45.031,000 --> 0:07:48,000
So what I'm going to show you now is very remarkable

124
0:07:48.103,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and it suggests that these factors can actually modulate the age of a tissue.

125
0:07:53.845,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And that's where we come back to this model called parabiosis.

126
0:07:57.167,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So, parabiosis is done in mice

127
0:07:59.731,000 --> 0:08:03,000
by surgically connecting the two mice together,

128
0:08:04.667,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and that leads then to a shared blood system,

129
0:08:07.024,000 --> 0:08:11,000
where we can now ask, "How does the old brain get influenced

130
0:08:11.835,000 --> 0:08:12,000
by exposure to the young blood?"

131
0:08:14.144,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And for this purpose, we use young mice

132
0:08:16.372,000 --> 0:08:19,000
that are an equivalency of 20-year-old people,

133
0:08:19.849,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and old mice that are roughly 65 years old in human years.

134
0:08:24.958,000 --> 0:08:26,000
What we found is quite remarkable.

135
0:08:27.808,000 --> 0:08:3,000
We find there are more neural stem cells that make new neurons

136
0:08:31.552,000 --> 0:08:32,000
in these old brains.

137
0:08:33.351,000 --> 0:08:35,000
There's an increased activity of the synapses,

138
0:08:35.957,000 --> 0:08:37,000
the connections between neurons.

139
0:08:38.02,000 --> 0:08:41,000
There are more genes expressed that are known to be involved

140
0:08:41.329,000 --> 0:08:42,000
in the formation of new memories.

141
0:08:43.659,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And there's less of this bad inflammation.

142
0:08:47.427,000 --> 0:08:53,000
But we observed that there are no cells entering the brains of these animals.

143
0:08:53.947,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So when we connect them,

144
0:08:55.357,000 --> 0:09:,000
there are actually no cells going into the old brain, in this model.

145
0:09:01.379,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Instead, we've reasoned, then, that it must be the soluble factors,

146
0:09:05.064,000 --> 0:09:09,000
so we could collect simply the soluble fraction of blood which is called plasma,

147
0:09:09.871,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and inject either young plasma or old plasma into these mice,

148
0:09:13.839,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and we could reproduce these rejuvenating effects,

149
0:09:16.231,000 --> 0:09:17,000
but what we could also do now

150
0:09:17.969,000 --> 0:09:19,000
is we could do memory tests with mice.

151
0:09:20.443,000 --> 0:09:23,000
As mice get older, like us humans, they have memory problems.

152
0:09:24.818,000 --> 0:09:25,000
It's just harder to detect them,

153
0:09:26.435,000 --> 0:09:28,000
but I'll show you in a minute how we do that.

154
0:09:28.803,000 --> 0:09:3,000
But we wanted to take this one step further,

155
0:09:31.522,000 --> 0:09:35,000
one step closer to potentially being relevant to humans.

156
0:09:35.586,000 --> 0:09:38,000
What I'm showing you now are unpublished studies,

157
0:09:38.807,000 --> 0:09:42,000
where we used human plasma, young human plasma,

158
0:09:43.364,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and as a control, saline,

159
0:09:45.237,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and injected it into old mice,

160
0:09:47.137,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and asked, can we again rejuvenate these old mice?

161
0:09:52.013,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Can we make them smarter?

162
0:09:54.104,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And to do this, we used a test. It's called a Barnes maze.

163
0:09:57.417,000 --> 0:10:,000
This is a big table that has lots of holes in it,

164
0:10:00.596,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and there are guide marks around it,

165
0:10:04.103,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and there's a bright light, as on this stage here.

166
0:10:06.733,000 --> 0:10:09,000
The mice hate this and they try to escape,

167
0:10:09.89,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and find the single hole that you see pointed at with an arrow,

168
0:10:14.17,000 --> 0:10:15,000
where a tube is mounted underneath

169
0:10:16.139,000 --> 0:10:19,000
where they can escape and feel comfortable in a dark hole.

170
0:10:19.977,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So we teach them, over several days,

171
0:10:21.803,000 --> 0:10:23,000
to find this space on these cues in the space,

172
0:10:24.73,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and you can compare this for humans,

173
0:10:27.548,000 --> 0:10:31,000
to finding your car in a parking lot after a busy day of shopping.

174
0:10:31.802,000 --> 0:10:32,000
(Laughter)

175
0:10:32.827,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Many of us have probably had some problems with that.

176
0:10:36.602,000 --> 0:10:38,000
So, let's look at an old mouse here.

177
0:10:38.954,000 --> 0:10:4,000
This is an old mouse that has memory problems,

178
0:10:41.154,000 --> 0:10:42,000
as you'll notice in a moment.

179
0:10:43.305,000 --> 0:10:47,000
It just looks into every hole, but it didn't form this spacial map

180
0:10:48.053,000 --> 0:10:53,000
that would remind it where it was in the previous trial or the last day.

181
0:10:53.873,000 --> 0:10:58,000
In stark contrast, this mouse here is a sibling of the same age,

182
0:10:59.364,000 --> 0:11:04,000
but it was treated with young human plasma for three weeks,

183
0:11:04.807,000 --> 0:11:06,000
with small injections every three days.

184
0:11:07.741,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And as you noticed, it almost looks around, "Where am I?" --

185
0:11:11.988,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and then walks straight to that hole and escapes.

186
0:11:14.919,000 --> 0:11:16,000
So, it could remember where that hole was.

187
0:11:18.742,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So by all means, this old mouse seems to be rejuvenated --

188
0:11:22.454,000 --> 0:11:24,000
it functions more like a younger mouse.

189
0:11:24.857,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And it also suggests that there is something

190
0:11:27.587,000 --> 0:11:31,000
not only in young mouse plasma, but in young human plasma

191
0:11:32.602,000 --> 0:11:35,000
that has the capacity to help this old brain.

192
0:11:36.834,000 --> 0:11:37,000
So to summarize,

193
0:11:38.01,000 --> 0:11:42,000
we find the old mouse, and its brain in particular, are malleable.

194
0:11:42.233,000 --> 0:11:45,000
They're not set in stone; we can actually change them.

195
0:11:45.708,000 --> 0:11:46,000
It can be rejuvenated.

196
0:11:47.68,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Young blood factors can reverse aging,

197
0:11:50.301,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and what I didn't show you --

198
0:11:52.037,000 --> 0:11:57,000
in this model, the young mouse actually suffers from exposure to the old.

199
0:11:57.283,000 --> 0:12:,000
So there are old-blood factors that can accelerate aging.

200
0:12:01.725,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And most importantly, humans may have similar factors,

201
0:12:06.066,000 --> 0:12:1,000
because we can take young human blood and have a similar effect.

202
0:12:10.592,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Old human blood, I didn't show you, does not have this effect;

203
0:12:14.172,000 --> 0:12:15,000
it does not make the mice younger.

204
0:12:17.071,000 --> 0:12:2,000
So, is this magic transferable to humans?

205
0:12:20.723,000 --> 0:12:23,000
We're running a small clinical study at Stanford,

206
0:12:24.376,000 --> 0:12:27,000
where we treat Alzheimer's patients with mild disease

207
0:12:28.276,000 --> 0:12:34,000
with a pint of plasma from young volunteers, 20-year-olds,

208
0:12:34.91,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and do this once a week for four weeks,

209
0:12:37.529,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and then we look at their brains with imaging.

210
0:12:41.05,000 --> 0:12:42,000
We test them cognitively,

211
0:12:42.918,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and we ask their caregivers for daily activities of living.

212
0:12:46.948,000 --> 0:12:49,000
What we hope is that there are some signs of improvement

213
0:12:50.891,000 --> 0:12:51,000
from this treatment.

214
0:12:52.758,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And if that's the case, that could give us hope

215
0:12:55.338,000 --> 0:12:57,000
that what I showed you works in mice

216
0:12:57.782,000 --> 0:12:58,000
might also work in humans.

217
0:13:00.478,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Now, I don't think we will live forever.

218
0:13:03.955,000 --> 0:13:05,000
But maybe we discovered

219
0:13:06.316,000 --> 0:13:09,000
that the Fountain of Youth is actually within us,

220
0:13:09.427,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and it has just dried out.

221
0:13:11.574,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And if we can turn it back on a little bit,

222
0:13:14.426,000 --> 0:13:18,000
maybe we can find the factors that are mediating these effects,

223
0:13:19.077,000 --> 0:13:21,000
we can produce these factors synthetically

224
0:13:21.688,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and we can treat diseases of aging, such as Alzheimer's disease

225
0:13:25.725,000 --> 0:13:26,000
or other dementias.

226
0:13:27.282,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Thank you very much.

227
0:13:28.457,000 --> 0:13:31,000
(Applause)

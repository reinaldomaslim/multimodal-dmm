1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
In this rather long sort of marathon presentation,

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I've tried to break it up into three parts:

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
the first being a whole lot of examples on how it can be

4
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
a little bit more pleasurable to deal with a computer

5
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and really address the qualities of the human interface.

6
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And these will be some simple design qualities

7
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and they will also be some qualities of, if you will,

8
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
the intelligence of interaction.

9
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Then the second part will really just be examples of new technologies --

10
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
new media falling very much into that mold.

11
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Again, I will go through them as fast as possible.

12
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And then the last one will be some examples

13
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I've been able to collect, which I think

14
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
illustrate this at least as best I can, in the world of entertainment.

15
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
People have this belief -- and I share most of it --

16
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that we will be using the TV screens or their equivalents

17
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
for electronic books of the future. But then you think,

18
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
"My God! What a terrible image you get when you look at still pictures on TV."

19
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Well, it doesn't have to be terrible.

20
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And that is a slide taken from a TV set

21
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and it was pre-processed to be very sympathetic to the TV medium,

22
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and it absolutely looks beautiful.

23
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Well, what's happened? How did people get into this mess?

24
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Where you are now, all of a sudden,

25
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
sitting in front of personal computers

26
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and video text -- teletext systems,

27
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and somewhat horrified by what you see on the screen?

28
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Well, you have to remember that TV was designed

29
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to be looked at eight times the distance of the diagonal.

30
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So you get a 13-inch, 19-inch, whatever, TV,

31
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and then you should multiply that by eight

32
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and that's the distance you should sit away from the TV set.

33
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Now we've put people 18 inches in front of a TV,

34
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and all the artifacts that none of the original designers expected to be seen,

35
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
all of a sudden, are staring you in the face:

36
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
the shadow mask, the scan lines, all of that.

37
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And they can be treated very easily;

38
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
there are actually ways of getting rid of them,

39
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
there are actually ways of just making absolutely beautiful pictures.

40
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I'm talking here a little bit about display technologies.

41
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Let me talk about how you might input information.

42
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And my favorite example is always fingers.

43
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I'm very interested in touch-sensitive displays.

44
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
High-tech, high-touch. Isn't that what some of you said?

45
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
It's certainly a very important medium for input,

46
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and a lot of people think that fingers are a very low-resolution

47
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
sort of stylus for inputting to a display.

48
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
In fact, they're not: it's really a very, very high-resolution input medium --

49
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
you have to just do it twice, you have to touch the screen

50
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and then rotate your finger slightly --

51
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and you can move a cursor with great accuracy.

52
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And so when you see on the market these systems

53
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that have just a few light emitting diodes on the side and are very low resolution,

54
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
it's nice that they exist because it still is better than nothing.

55
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
But it, in some sense, misses the point:

56
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
namely, that fingers are a very, very high-resolution input medium.

57
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Now, what are some of the other advantages?

58
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Well, the one advantage is that you don't have to pick them up,

59
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and people don't realize how important that is --

60
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
not having to pick up your fingers to use them. (Laughter)

61
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
When you think for a second of the mouse on Macintosh --

62
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and I will not criticize the mouse too much --

63
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
when you're typing -- what you have -- you want to now put something --

64
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
first of all, you've got to find the mouse.

65
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
You have to probably stop. Maybe not come to a grinding halt,

66
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
but you've got to sort of find that mouse. Then you find the mouse,

67
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and you're going to have to wiggle it a little bit

68
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
to see where the cursor is on the screen.

69
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And then when you finally see where it is,

70
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
then you've got to move it to get the cursor over there,

71
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and then -- "Bang" -- you've got to hit a button or do whatever.

72
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
That's four separate steps versus typing and then touching

73
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and typing and just doing it all in one motion --

74
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
or one-and-a-half, depending on how you want to count.

75
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Again, what I'm trying to do is just illustrate

76
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
the kinds of problems that I think face the designers

77
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
of new computer systems and entertainment systems

78
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and educational systems

79
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
from the perspective of the quality of that interface.

80
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And another advantage, of course, of using fingers is you have 10 of them.

81
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And we have never known how to do this technically,

82
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
so this slide is a fake slide.

83
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
We never succeeded in using ten fingers,

84
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
but there are certain things you can do, obviously,

85
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
with more than one-finger input, which is rather fascinating.

86
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
What we did stumble across was something ...

87
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Again, which is typical of the computer field,

88
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
is when you have a bug that you can't get rid of you turn it into a feature.

89
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And maybe ... (Laughter)

90
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
maybe a mouse is a new kind of bug.

91
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
But the bug in our case was in touch-sensitive displays:

92
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
we wanted to be able to draw -- you know, rub your finger

93
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
across the screen to input continuous points --

94
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and there was just too much friction

95
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
created between your finger and the glass --

96
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
if glass was the substrate, which it usually is.

97
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So we found that that actually was a feature

98
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
in the sense you could build a pressure-sensitive display.

99
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And when you touch it with your finger,

100
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
you can actually, then, introduce all the forces on the face of that screen,

101
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and that actually has a certain amount of value.

102
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Let me see if I can load another disc

103
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and show you, quickly, an example.

104
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Now, imagine a screen, which is not only touch-sensitive now,

105
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
it's pressure-sensitive.

106
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And it's pressure-sensitive to the forces both in the plane of the screen --

107
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
X, Y, and Z at least in one direction;

108
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
we couldn't figure out how to come in the other direction.

109
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
But let me get rid of the slide,

110
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and let's see if this comes on.

111
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
OK. So there is the pressure-sensitive display in operation.

112
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
The person's just, if you will, pushing on the screen to make a curve.

113
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
But this is the interesting part.

114
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
I want to stop it for a second

115
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
because the movie is very badly made.

116
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And the particular display was built about six years ago,

117
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and when we moved from one room to another room,

118
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
a rather large person sat on it and it got destroyed.

119
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So all we have is this record. (Laughter)

120
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
But imagine that screen having lots of objects on it

121
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and the person has touched an object --

122
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
one of N -- like he did there, and then pushed on it.

123
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Now, imagine a program

124
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
where some of those objects are physically heavy and some are light:

125
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
one is an anvil on a fuzzy rug

126
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and the other one is a ping-pong ball on a sheet of glass.

127
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And when you touch it, you have to really push very hard

128
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
to move that anvil across the screen,

129
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and yet you touch the ping-pong ball very lightly

130
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and it just scoots across the screen.

131
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And what you can do -- oops, I didn't mean to do that --

132
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
what you can do is actually feed back to the user

133
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
the feeling of the physical properties.

134
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So again, they don't have to be weight;

135
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
they could be a general trying to move troops,

136
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and he's got to move an aircraft carrier versus a little boat.

137
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
In fact, they funded it for that very reason.

138
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
(Laughter)

139
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
The whole notion, then, is one that at the interface

140
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
there are physical properties in that transducer --

141
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
in this case it's pressure and touches --

142
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
that allow you to present things to the user that you could never present before.

143
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So it's not simply looking at the quality or, if you will, the luxury of that interface,

144
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
but it's actually looking at the idea

145
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
of presenting things that previously couldn't be presented before.

146
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I want to move on to another example,

147
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
which is one of a different sort, where we're trying to use computer

148
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and video disc technology now to come up with a new kind of book.

149
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Here, the idea is that you're going to take this book,

150
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
if you will, and it's going to come alive.

151
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
You're going to sort of breathe life into it.

152
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
We are so used to doing monologues.

153
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Filmmakers, for example, are the experts in monologue making:

154
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
you make a film and it has a well-formed beginning, middle and end,

155
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and in some sense the art of it is that.

156
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And you then say, "There's an opportunity

157
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
for making conversational movies." Well, what does that mean?

158
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And it sort of nibbles at the core of the whole profession

159
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and all the assumptions of that medium.

160
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So, book writing is the same thing.

161
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
What I'll show you very quickly is a new kind of book

162
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
where it is mixed now with ... all sorts of things live in there,

163
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
but you have to keep a few things in mind.

164
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
One is that this book knows about itself.

165
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Each frame of the movie has information about itself.

166
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
So it knows, or at least there is computer-readable information

167
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
in the medium itself. It's just not a static movie frame.

168
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
That's one thing. The other is that you have to realize

169
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
that it is a random access medium,

170
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and you can, in fact, branch and expand and elaborate and shrink.

171
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And here -- again, my favorite example -- is the cookbook,

172
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
the "Larousse Gastronomique."

173
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And I think I use the example all too often,

174
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
but it's a great one because there is a classic ending in that little

175
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
encyclopedia-style cookbook that tells you how to do something like penguin,

176
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and you get to the end of the recipe and it says, "Cook until done."

177
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Now, that would be, if you will, the top green track,

178
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
which doesn't mean too much. But you might have to elaborate for me

179
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
or for somebody who isn't an expert, and say,

180
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
"Cook at 380 degrees for 45 minutes."

181
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And then for a real beginner, you would go down even further

182
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and elaborate more -- say, "Open the oven, preheat, wait for the light to go out,

183
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
open the door, don't leave it open too long,

184
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
put the penguin in and shut the door ..." (Laughter) whatever.

185
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And that's a much more elaborate one than you dribble back.

186
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
That's one kind of use of random access.

187
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And the other is where you want to explain the same thing in different ways.

188
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
If you're in a classroom situation and somebody asks a question,

189
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
the last thing you do is repeat what you just said.

190
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
You try and think of a different way of saying the same thing,

191
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
or if you know the particular student and that student's cognitive style,

192
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
then you might say it in a way that you think

193
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
would have a good impedance match with that student.

194
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
There are all sorts of techniques you will use --

195
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and again, this is a different kind of branching.

196
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
So, what I will show you is ... it's a rather boring book,

197
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
but I'm afraid sometimes you have to do boring books

198
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
because your sponsors aren't necessarily interested in fiction

199
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and entertainment. And this is a book on how to repair a transmission.

200
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Now, I don't even know what vintage the transmission is,

201
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
but let me just show you very quickly some of it, and we'll move on.

202
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
(Video) Narrator: And continue to get descriptions for each of these chapters.

203
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Nicholas Negroponte: Now, this is his table of contents.

204
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Just a picture of the transmission, and as you rub your finger across the transmission

205
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
it highlights the various parts.

206
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Narrator: When I find a chapter that I want to see,

207
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
I just touch the text and the system will format pages for me to read.

208
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
The words or phrases that are lit up in red are glossary words,

209
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
so I can get a different definition by just touching the word,

210
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and the definition appears, superimposed over the illustration.

211
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
NN: This is about the oil pan, or the oil filter and all that.

212
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
This is relatively important because it sets the page ...

213
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Narrator: This is another example of a page with glossary words

214
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
highlighted in red.

215
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
I can get a definition of these words just by touching them,

216
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and the definition will appear in the illustration corner.

217
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
I can get back to the illustration, but in this case it's not a single frame,

218
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
but it's actually a movie of someone coming into the frame and doing the repair

219
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
that's described in the text.

220
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
The two-headed slider is a speed control that allows me to watch the movie

221
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
at various speeds, in forward or reverse.

222
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And the movie is displayed as a full frame movie.

223
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
I can go back to the beginning ... and play the movie at full speed.

224
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Here's another step-by-step procedure, only in this case --

225
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
NN: Okay, this movie is ... Everybody's heard of sound-sync movies --

226
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
this is text-sync movies, so as the movie plays, the text gets highlighted.

227
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
We highlight the text as we go through the movie.

228
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Repairman: ... Not too far out. Front poles, preferably.

229
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Don't loosen them too far. If you loosen them too far, you'll have a big mess.

230
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
NN: I suspect that some of you might not even understand that language.

231
0:15:18.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
(Laughter)

232
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:28,000
OK. I'm at the third and last part of this,

233
0:15:28.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
which I said I would make an attempt to at least give you some examples

234
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:36,000
that may be more directly related to the world of entertainment.

235
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And of course, good education has got to be good entertainment,

236
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
so my first example will be drawn from a very recent experiment

237
0:15:48.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
that we've been doing -- in this case, in Senegal --

238
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
where we have tried to use personal computers

239
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:16:01,000
as a pedagogical medium. But not as teaching machines at all;

240
0:16:01.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
the whole notion is to use this as an instrument

241
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:08,000
where there is a complete reversal of roles --

242
0:16:08.16,000 --> 0:16:12,000
the child is, if you will, the teacher and the machine is the student --

243
0:16:12.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
and the art of computer programming is a vehicle that sort of

244
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
approximates thinking about thinking.

245
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
But teaching kids programming per se is utterly irrelevant.

246
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
And there are just a few slides I want to go through,

247
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
but there's a story I'd like to tell. And that was when,

248
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:33,000
before we did this in any developing countries --

249
0:16:33.16,000 --> 0:16:35,000
we're doing it, in fact, in three developing countries right now:

250
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
Pakistan, Colombia and Senegal --

251
0:16:37.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
we did it in some pretty rough areas of New York City.

252
0:16:42.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
And one child, whose name I've forgotten, was about seven or eight years old,

253
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:52,000
absolutely considered mentally handicapped --

254
0:16:52.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
couldn't read, didn't even make it in the lowest section of the school's classes --

255
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:03,000
and was pretty much not in school, though physically there.

256
0:17:03.16,000 --> 0:17:06,000
But did hang around the, quote, "computer room,"

257
0:17:06.16,000 --> 0:17:08,000
where there were quite a few computers,

258
0:17:08.16,000 --> 0:17:12,000
and learned this particular language called Logo --

259
0:17:12.16,000 --> 0:17:15,000
and learned it with great ease and found it a lot of fun,

260
0:17:15.16,000 --> 0:17:2,000
it was very interesting. And one day, by chance,

261
0:17:20.16,000 --> 0:17:26,000
some visitors from the NIE came by in their double-breasted suits

262
0:17:26.16,000 --> 0:17:31,000
looking at this setup, and none of the children who were normally there,

263
0:17:31.16,000 --> 0:17:35,000
except for this one child, were there.

264
0:17:35.16,000 --> 0:17:38,000
He was, and he said, "Let me show you how this works,"

265
0:17:38.16,000 --> 0:17:43,000
and they got an absolutely ingenuous, wonderful description of Logo.

266
0:17:43.16,000 --> 0:17:47,000
And the child was just zipping right through it, showing them all sorts of things

267
0:17:47.16,000 --> 0:17:51,000
until they asked him how to do something which he couldn't explain

268
0:17:51.16,000 --> 0:17:54,000
and so he flipped through the manual, found the explanation

269
0:17:54.16,000 --> 0:17:56,000
and typed the command and got it to do what they asked.

270
0:17:56.16,000 --> 0:18:,000
They were delighted, and by the time it was time to go see the principal,

271
0:18:00.16,000 --> 0:18:03,000
whom they'd actually come to see -- not the computer room --

272
0:18:03.16,000 --> 0:18:04,000
they went upstairs and they said,

273
0:18:04.16,000 --> 0:18:06,000
"This is absolutely remarkable!

274
0:18:06.16,000 --> 0:18:1,000
That child was very articulate and showed us

275
0:18:10.16,000 --> 0:18:14,000
and even dealt with the things he couldn't do automatically

276
0:18:14.16,000 --> 0:18:18,000
with that manual. It was just absolutely fantastic."

277
0:18:18.16,000 --> 0:18:21,000
The principal said, "There's a dreadful mistake,

278
0:18:21.16,000 --> 0:18:23,000
because that child can't read.

279
0:18:23.16,000 --> 0:18:25,000
And you obviously have been hoodwinked

280
0:18:25.16,000 --> 0:18:28,000
or you've talked about somebody else."

281
0:18:28.16,000 --> 0:18:3,000
And they all got up and they all went downstairs

282
0:18:30.16,000 --> 0:18:34,000
and the child was still there. And they did something very intelligent:

283
0:18:34.16,000 --> 0:18:38,000
they asked the child, "Can you read?"

284
0:18:38.16,000 --> 0:18:41,000
And the child said, "No, I can't."

285
0:18:41.16,000 --> 0:18:43,000
And then they said, "But wait a minute. You

286
0:18:43.16,000 --> 0:18:46,000
just looked through that manual and you found ... "

287
0:18:46.16,000 --> 0:18:49,000
and he said, "Oh, but that's not reading."

288
0:18:49.16,000 --> 0:18:51,000
And so they said, "Well, what's reading then?"

289
0:18:51.16,000 --> 0:18:55,000
He says, "Well, reading is this junk they give me in little books to read.

290
0:18:55.16,000 --> 0:19:02,000
It's absolutely irrelevant, (Laughter) and I get nothing for it.

291
0:19:02.16,000 --> 0:19:06,000
But here, with a little bit of effort I get a lot of return."

292
0:19:06.16,000 --> 0:19:08,000
And it really meant something to the child.

293
0:19:08.16,000 --> 0:19:1,000
The child read beautifully, it turned out,

294
0:19:10.16,000 --> 0:19:14,000
and was really very competent. So it actually meant something.

295
0:19:14.16,000 --> 0:19:19,000
And that story has many other anecdotes that are similar,

296
0:19:19.16,000 --> 0:19:26,000
but wow. The key to the future of computers in education is right there,

297
0:19:26.16,000 --> 0:19:29,000
and it is: when does it mean something to a child?

298
0:19:29.16,000 --> 0:19:32,000
There is a myth, and it truly is a myth:

299
0:19:32.16,000 --> 0:19:35,000
we believe -- and I'm sure a lot of you believe in this room --

300
0:19:35.16,000 --> 0:19:4,000
that it is harder to read and write than it is to learn how to speak.

301
0:19:40.16,000 --> 0:19:46,000
And it's not, but we think speech -- "My God, little children pick it up somehow,

302
0:19:46.16,000 --> 0:19:48,000
and by the age of two they're doing a mediocre job,

303
0:19:48.16,000 --> 0:19:51,000
and by three and four they're speaking reasonably well.

304
0:19:51.16,000 --> 0:19:53,000
And yet you've got to go to school to learn how to read,

305
0:19:53.16,000 --> 0:19:56,000
and you have to sit in a classroom and somebody has to teach you.

306
0:19:56.16,000 --> 0:19:59,000
Hence, it must be harder." Well, it's not harder.

307
0:19:59.16,000 --> 0:20:06,000
What the truth is is that speaking has great value to a child;

308
0:20:06.16,000 --> 0:20:09,000
the child can get a great deal by talking to you.

309
0:20:09.16,000 --> 0:20:11,000
Reading and writing is utterly useless.

310
0:20:11.16,000 --> 0:20:16,000
There is no reason for a child to read and write except blind faith,

311
0:20:16.16,000 --> 0:20:19,000
and that it's going to help you. (Laughter)

312
0:20:19.16,000 --> 0:20:22,000
So what happens is you go to school and people say,

313
0:20:22.16,000 --> 0:20:25,000
"Just believe me, you're going to like it.

314
0:20:25.16,000 --> 0:20:28,000
You're going to like reading," and just read and read.

315
0:20:28.16,000 --> 0:20:32,000
On the other hand, you give a kid -- a three-year-old kid -- a computer

316
0:20:32.16,000 --> 0:20:35,000
and they type a little command and -- Poof! -- something happens.

317
0:20:35.16,000 --> 0:20:38,000
And all of a sudden ... You may not call that reading and writing,

318
0:20:38.16,000 --> 0:20:41,000
but a certain bit of typing and reading stuff on the screen

319
0:20:41.16,000 --> 0:20:44,000
has a huge payoff, and it's a lot of fun.

320
0:20:44.16,000 --> 0:20:48,000
And in fact, it's a powerful educational instrument.

321
0:20:48.16,000 --> 0:20:53,000
Well, in Senegal we found that this was the traditional classroom:

322
0:20:53.16,000 --> 0:20:58,000
120 kids -- three per desk -- one teacher, a little bit of chalk.

323
0:20:58.16,000 --> 0:21:01,000
This student was one of our first students,

324
0:21:01.16,000 --> 0:21:05,000
and it's the girl on the left leaning with her chalkboard,

325
0:21:05.16,000 --> 0:21:08,000
and she came ... within two days --

326
0:21:08.16,000 --> 0:21:1,000
I want to show you the program she wrote,

327
0:21:10.16,000 --> 0:21:16,000
and remember her hairstyle. And that is the program she made.

328
0:21:16.16,000 --> 0:21:2,000
That's what meant something to her, is doing the hair pattern,

329
0:21:20.16,000 --> 0:21:25,000
and actually did it within two days -- an hour each day --

330
0:21:25.16,000 --> 0:21:27,000
and found it was, to her,

331
0:21:27.16,000 --> 0:21:3,000
absolutely the most meaningful piece ...

332
0:21:30.16,000 --> 0:21:34,000
But rooted in that, little did she know how much knowledge

333
0:21:34.16,000 --> 0:21:36,000
she was acquiring about geometry

334
0:21:36.16,000 --> 0:21:39,000
and just math and logic and all the rest.

335
0:21:39.16,000 --> 0:21:42,000
And again, I could talk for three hours about this subject.

336
0:21:42.16,000 --> 0:21:5,000
I will come to my last example and then quit.

337
0:21:50.16,000 --> 0:21:56,000
And my last example -- as some of my former colleagues,

338
0:21:56.16,000 --> 0:21:59,000
whom I see in the room, can imagine what it will be.

339
0:21:59.16,000 --> 0:22:02,000
Yes, it is. It's our work -- that was a while ago,

340
0:22:02.16,000 --> 0:22:06,000
and it still is my favorite project -- of teleconferencing.

341
0:22:06.16,000 --> 0:22:08,000
And the reason it remains a favorite project

342
0:22:08.16,000 --> 0:22:15,000
is that we were asked to do a teleconferencing system

343
0:22:15.16,000 --> 0:22:17,000
where you had the following situation:

344
0:22:17.16,000 --> 0:22:22,000
you had five people at five different sites -- they were known people --

345
0:22:22.16,000 --> 0:22:27,000
and you had to have these people in teleconference,

346
0:22:27.16,000 --> 0:22:3,000
such that each one was utterly convinced

347
0:22:30.16,000 --> 0:22:34,000
that the other four were physically present.

348
0:22:34.16,000 --> 0:22:38,000
Now, that is sufficiently

349
0:22:38.16,000 --> 0:22:43,000
zany that we would, obviously, jump to the bait, and we did.

350
0:22:43.16,000 --> 0:22:46,000
And the fact that we knew the people --

351
0:22:46.16,000 --> 0:22:49,000
we had to take a page out of the history of Walt Disney --

352
0:22:49.16,000 --> 0:22:52,000
we actually went so far as to build CRTs

353
0:22:52.16,000 --> 0:22:55,000
in the shapes of the people's faces.

354
0:22:55.16,000 --> 0:23:,000
So if I wanted to call my friend Peter Sprague on the phone,

355
0:23:00.16,000 --> 0:23:03,000
my secretary would get his head out and bring it and set it on the desk,

356
0:23:03.16,000 --> 0:23:04,000
(Laughter)

357
0:23:04.16,000 --> 0:23:09,000
and that would be the TV used for the occasion.

358
0:23:09.16,000 --> 0:23:12,000
And it's uncanny: there's no way I can explain to you

359
0:23:12.16,000 --> 0:23:16,000
the amount of eye contact you get with that physical face

360
0:23:16.16,000 --> 0:23:2,000
projected on a 3D CRT of that sort.

361
0:23:20.16,000 --> 0:23:23,000
The next thing that we had to do is to persuade them

362
0:23:23.16,000 --> 0:23:27,000
that there needed to be spatial correspondence, which is straightforward,

363
0:23:27.16,000 --> 0:23:29,000
but again, it's something that didn't fall naturally

364
0:23:29.16,000 --> 0:23:32,000
out of a telecommunications or computing style of thinking;

365
0:23:32.16,000 --> 0:23:36,000
it was a very, if you will, architectural or spatial concept.

366
0:23:36.16,000 --> 0:23:39,000
And that was to recognize that when you sit around the table,

367
0:23:39.16,000 --> 0:23:44,000
the actual location of the people becomes rather important.

368
0:23:44.16,000 --> 0:23:47,000
And when somebody gets up, in fact, to go answer a phone

369
0:23:47.16,000 --> 0:23:5,000
or use a bathroom or something, the empty seat becomes,

370
0:23:50.16,000 --> 0:23:53,000
if you will, that person. And you point frequently to the empty seat

371
0:23:53.16,000 --> 0:23:56,000
and you say, "He or she wouldn't agree,"

372
0:23:56.16,000 --> 0:24:02,000
and the empty chair is that person and the spatiality is crucial.

373
0:24:02.16,000 --> 0:24:05,000
So we said, "Well, these will be on round tables

374
0:24:05.16,000 --> 0:24:08,000
and the order around the table had to be the same,

375
0:24:08.16,000 --> 0:24:11,000
so that at my site, I would be, if you will, real

376
0:24:11.16,000 --> 0:24:16,000
and then at each other's site you'd have these plastic heads.

377
0:24:16.16,000 --> 0:24:2,000
And the plastic heads, sometimes you want to project them.

378
0:24:20.16,000 --> 0:24:23,000
And there are a number of schemes, which I don't want to dwell on,

379
0:24:23.16,000 --> 0:24:25,000
but this is the one that we finally used

380
0:24:25.16,000 --> 0:24:29,000
where we projected onto rear screen material

381
0:24:29.16,000 --> 0:24:33,000
that was molded in the face -- literally in the face of the person.

382
0:24:33.16,000 --> 0:24:37,000
And I'll show you one more slide, where this is actually made

383
0:24:37.16,000 --> 0:24:41,000
from something called a solid photograph and is the screen.

384
0:24:41.16,000 --> 0:24:44,000
Now, we track, on the person's head, the head motions --

385
0:24:44.16,000 --> 0:24:48,000
so we transmit with a video the head positions --

386
0:24:48.16,000 --> 0:24:55,000
and so this head moves in about two axes.

387
0:24:55.16,000 --> 0:25:,000
So if I, all of a sudden, turn to the person to my left

388
0:25:00.16,000 --> 0:25:05,000
and start talking to that person, then at the person to my right's site,

389
0:25:05.16,000 --> 0:25:08,000
he'll see these two plastic heads talking to each other.

390
0:25:08.16,000 --> 0:25:13,000
And then if that person interrupts, then those two heads may turn.

391
0:25:13.16,000 --> 0:25:18,000
And it really is reconstructing, quite accurately, teleconferencing.

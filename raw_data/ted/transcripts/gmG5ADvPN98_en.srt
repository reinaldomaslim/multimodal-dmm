2
0:00:12.517,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Bryn Freedman: So you keep talking about leadership

3
0:00:15.164,000 --> 0:00:17,000
as a real crisis of conformity.

4
0:00:17.641,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Can you explain to us what you mean by that?

5
0:00:19.997,000 --> 0:00:21,000
What do you see as a crisis of conformity?

6
0:00:22.375,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Halla Tómasdóttir: I think it's a crisis of conformity

7
0:00:24.958,000 --> 0:00:27,000
when we continue to do business and lead in the way we always have,

8
0:00:28.546,000 --> 0:00:3,000
yet the evidence is overwhelming

9
0:00:31.287,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that the world needs us to change our ways.

10
0:00:34.39,000 --> 0:00:36,000
So let's look a little bit at that evidence.

11
0:00:37.124,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Science has told us that we're facing a climate crisis,

12
0:00:40.399,000 --> 0:00:42,000
yet 40 percent of board directors

13
0:00:42.519,000 --> 0:00:44,000
don't think climate belongs in the boardroom.

14
0:00:45.704,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And we have kids marching in the streets now,

15
0:00:48.308,000 --> 0:00:51,000
asking us to be accountable for their future.

16
0:00:51.822,000 --> 0:00:53,000
We have a crisis of inequality.

17
0:00:54.006,000 --> 0:00:56,000
We have Yellow Jackets not just in the streets of France,

18
0:00:56.737,000 --> 0:00:57,000
but all over the world,

19
0:00:58.204,000 --> 0:01:,000
and yet we continue to see examples

20
0:01:00.387,000 --> 0:01:04,000
of businesses and other leaders fueling that anger.

21
0:01:04.923,000 --> 0:01:06,000
BF: Do you think the pitchforks are coming?

22
0:01:06.992,000 --> 0:01:08,000
HT: I definitely think this is not sustainable.

23
0:01:09.282,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And the reason why it's so difficult

24
0:01:11.551,000 --> 0:01:15,000
for us to deal with these complicated crises that are interrelated

25
0:01:15.922,000 --> 0:01:18,000
is that we are at the lowest levels of trust we've ever been at.

26
0:01:19.513,000 --> 0:01:21,000
In the UK, three percent of people trust their government

27
0:01:22.318,000 --> 0:01:23,000
to solve the Brexit crisis,

28
0:01:23.999,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and that was in December.

29
0:01:25.39,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I think it's probably gone down since then.

30
0:01:27.7,000 --> 0:01:3,000
BF: What do you think new leadership actually looks like?

31
0:01:31.016,000 --> 0:01:33,000
HT: We need courageous leaders,

32
0:01:33.05,000 --> 0:01:34,000
yet they have to be humble.

33
0:01:34.741,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And they have to be guided by a moral compass,

34
0:01:37.885,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and the moral compass is the combination of having a social purpose --

35
0:01:41.653,000 --> 0:01:43,000
you can't have your license to operate anymore

36
0:01:44.328,000 --> 0:01:46,000
without a purpose that contributes to society,

37
0:01:47.319,000 --> 0:01:51,000
but what, to me, has been missing from that dialogue is a set of principles.

38
0:01:51.691,000 --> 0:01:53,000
We cannot just define why we exist,

39
0:01:54.174,000 --> 0:01:56,000
we have to define how we're going to do business

40
0:01:57.166,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and how we're going to lead.

41
0:01:58.524,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And to us, that has to be to solve these imminent crises:

42
0:02:02.443,000 --> 0:02:03,000
the climate crisis,

43
0:02:03.697,000 --> 0:02:04,000
the crisis of inequality

44
0:02:05.002,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and the crisis of trust.

45
0:02:06.398,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So at The B Team,

46
0:02:07.591,000 --> 0:02:11,000
we embrace sustainability, equality and accountability as our principles.

47
0:02:12.338,000 --> 0:02:17,000
BF: Do you think this whole question of purpose is really window dressing --

48
0:02:17.727,000 --> 0:02:19,000
they're saying what they think people want to hear,

49
0:02:20.272,000 --> 0:02:22,000
but they're actually not making the fundamental changes

50
0:02:22.982,000 --> 0:02:23,000
that are necessary?

51
0:02:24.157,000 --> 0:02:25,000
HT: A lot of people feel that way,

52
0:02:25.979,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and I think there's a growing momentum behind that.

53
0:02:28.427,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So I think the world is calling for responsible leadership now,

54
0:02:31.408,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and any leader who wants to be around for the 21st century

55
0:02:34.473,000 --> 0:02:37,000
really needs to start thinking courageously and holistically

56
0:02:37.503,000 --> 0:02:39,000
how they're going to be part of the solution

57
0:02:39.576,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and not window-dress anymore.

58
0:02:41.057,000 --> 0:02:42,000
You have to do it for real now.

59
0:02:42.566,000 --> 0:02:44,000
BF: Do you see anybody out there who's doing it

60
0:02:45.263,000 --> 0:02:47,000
in a way that you think is actually effective

61
0:02:48.038,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and has a real, long-term impact?

62
0:02:50.883,000 --> 0:02:52,000
HT: Fortunately, we have some great leaders out there.

63
0:02:53.431,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And just to give one example,

64
0:02:54.854,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Emmanuel Faber, who's one of the newest members of The B Team,

65
0:02:57.837,000 --> 0:02:58,000
he's the CEO of Danone,

66
0:02:59.066,000 --> 0:03:01,000
the world's largest yogurt-maker and major food company --

67
0:03:01.878,000 --> 0:03:02,000
a real global company.

68
0:03:03.344,000 --> 0:03:04,000
He's so committed to sustainability

69
0:03:05.209,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that he's not only changing the ways of his own business,

70
0:03:08.104,000 --> 0:03:09,000
but his entire supply chain.

71
0:03:10.044,000 --> 0:03:13,000
He's so committed to equality that when he took on as CEO

72
0:03:13.068,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and he said gender balance matters,

73
0:03:14.87,000 --> 0:03:16,000
he created a gender-balanced executive team

74
0:03:17.72,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and gave men and women equal maternity and paternity leave.

75
0:03:21.883,000 --> 0:03:22,000
He's so committed to accountability

76
0:03:23.731,000 --> 0:03:26,000
that he turned his US operations into a B Corporation.

77
0:03:27.455,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Now many of you may not know what that is,

78
0:03:29.536,000 --> 0:03:31,000
but that's a company that holds itself responsible

79
0:03:31.954,000 --> 0:03:34,000
for not just profit but its impact on people and the planet,

80
0:03:35.407,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and transparently reports on their performance on all of that.

81
0:03:38.859,000 --> 0:03:4,000
It's the largest B Corp in the world.

82
0:03:40.915,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So to me, that's holistic, courageous leadership,

83
0:03:43.419,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and it's really the vision we all need to hold.

84
0:03:46.356,000 --> 0:03:47,000
BF: Is this "Back to the Future"?

85
0:03:47.953,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I mean, I wonder, when I think about companies --

86
0:03:50.827,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Anheuser-Busch comes to mind in America --

87
0:03:53.817,000 --> 0:03:55,000
a 100-year-old company that invested in its community,

88
0:03:56.738,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that gave a living wage

89
0:03:57.995,000 --> 0:03:59,000
before it ended up, you know, losing and getting sold.

90
0:04:00.739,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Are we really looking now for companies that are global and community citizens,

91
0:04:05.625,000 --> 0:04:08,000
or is that something that is not even useful anymore?

92
0:04:09.304,000 --> 0:04:13,000
HT: Well, you can do this for the reason that it's risky, actually,

93
0:04:13.517,000 --> 0:04:15,000
to continue without doing the right thing now.

94
0:04:15.699,000 --> 0:04:16,000
You can't attract the right talent,

95
0:04:17.405,000 --> 0:04:18,000
you can't attract customers

96
0:04:18.731,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and increasingly, you won't be able to attract capital.

97
0:04:21.327,000 --> 0:04:22,000
You might do it for risk reasons,

98
0:04:22.937,000 --> 0:04:24,000
you might do it for business opportunity reasons,

99
0:04:25.52,000 --> 0:04:27,000
because this is where the growth is,

100
0:04:27.56,000 --> 0:04:29,000
which is why many leaders are doing the right thing.

101
0:04:30.06,000 --> 0:04:31,000
But at the end of the day,

102
0:04:31.866,000 --> 0:04:32,000
we need to ask ourselves:

103
0:04:33.232,000 --> 0:04:35,000
"Who are we holding ourselves accountable for?"

104
0:04:36.036,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And if that isn't the next generation,

105
0:04:37.895,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I don't know who.

106
0:04:39.347,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So I want to just make very clear,

107
0:04:41.323,000 --> 0:04:43,000
because we tend to think about leadership

108
0:04:43.378,000 --> 0:04:46,000
as only those who sit in positions of power.

109
0:04:46.456,000 --> 0:04:48,000
To me, leadership is not at all like that.

110
0:04:48.838,000 --> 0:04:5,000
There's a leader inside every single one of us,

111
0:04:51.596,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and our most important work in life is to release that leader.

112
0:04:55.127,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And I think one of the greatest global examples we have

113
0:04:57.986,000 --> 0:04:59,000
of someone who didn't --

114
0:05:00.532,000 --> 0:05:01,000
no one gave her power --

115
0:05:01.995,000 --> 0:05:03,000
is the 16-year-old girl called Greta Thunberg.

116
0:05:04.673,000 --> 0:05:05,000
She's from Sweden,

117
0:05:05.859,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and a few years ago, she really became --

118
0:05:08.255,000 --> 0:05:09,000
she has Asperger's,

119
0:05:09.486,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and she became passionate about our climate crisis --

120
0:05:12.031,000 --> 0:05:13,000
learned everything about it.

121
0:05:13.389,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And faced with the evidence,

122
0:05:14.767,000 --> 0:05:16,000
she just felt so disappointed in her leadership

123
0:05:17.419,000 --> 0:05:2,000
that she started striking in front of the Swedish parliament.

124
0:05:21.115,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And now she has started a global movement,

125
0:05:23.158,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and hundreds and thousands of school kids are out in the streets

126
0:05:26.24,000 --> 0:05:28,000
asking us to hold ourselves accountable for their future.

127
0:05:29.592,000 --> 0:05:31,000
No one gave her that authority,

128
0:05:32.144,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and she now speaks to the leaders of the world, heads of state,

129
0:05:35.708,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and really is impacting the world.

130
0:05:37.691,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So I really think that when we think about leadership today,

131
0:05:41.775,000 --> 0:05:43,000
it can't be defined to those in positions of power

132
0:05:44.18,000 --> 0:05:47,000
though they have disproportionately greater responsibility.

133
0:05:47.86,000 --> 0:05:48,000
But all of us need to think about,

134
0:05:49.697,000 --> 0:05:5,000
"What am I doing?"

135
0:05:50.872,000 --> 0:05:51,000
"How am I contributing?"

136
0:05:52.063,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And we need to release that leader inside

137
0:05:54.099,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and actually start making the positive impact

138
0:05:56.395,000 --> 0:05:57,000
this world is calling for right now.

139
0:05:58.8,000 --> 0:06:,000
BF: But we have such hierarchical leadership.

140
0:06:01.132,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I mean, I understand what you're saying --

141
0:06:03.188,000 --> 0:06:05,000
it's nice to release the leader inside --

142
0:06:05.219,000 --> 0:06:06,000
but in these corporations,

143
0:06:07.195,000 --> 0:06:09,000
the truth is, it's extremely hierarchical.

144
0:06:09.824,000 --> 0:06:1,000
What can companies do

145
0:06:11.699,000 --> 0:06:15,000
to create less vertical and more horizontal relationships?

146
0:06:16.455,000 --> 0:06:18,000
HT: Well, I'm a big believer and I've long been passionate

147
0:06:19.194,000 --> 0:06:2,000
about closing the gender gap,

148
0:06:20.618,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and I really believe gender-balanced leadership is the way to go

149
0:06:24.403,000 --> 0:06:29,000
in order to embrace a leadership style that has been shown to be more powerful,

150
0:06:29.606,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and that's when both men and women embrace

151
0:06:31.916,000 --> 0:06:32,000
both masculine and feminine values.

152
0:06:34.084,000 --> 0:06:35,000
It actually is proven in research

153
0:06:35.786,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that that's the most effective leadership style.

154
0:06:39.012,000 --> 0:06:43,000
But I'm increasingly now thinking about how we close the generational gap,

155
0:06:43.511,000 --> 0:06:46,000
because look at these young children in the streets around the world --

156
0:06:46.899,000 --> 0:06:47,000
they're asking us to lead.

157
0:06:48.221,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Kofi Annan used to say, "You're never too young to lead."

158
0:06:51.861,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And then he would add,

159
0:06:53.089,000 --> 0:06:54,000
"Or too old to learn."

160
0:06:54.982,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And I think we have now entered this era

161
0:06:57.113,000 --> 0:07:,000
where we need the wisdom of those with experience,

162
0:07:01.13,000 --> 0:07:04,000
but we need the digital natives of the young generation

163
0:07:04.824,000 --> 0:07:07,000
to co-mentor or to mentor us just as much as we can help

164
0:07:08.504,000 --> 0:07:1,000
with wisdom from the older people.

165
0:07:11.078,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So it's a new reality,

166
0:07:12.587,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and these old, sort of hierarchical ways to think about things,

167
0:07:15.935,000 --> 0:07:18,000
they're increasingly coming under pressure in this reality.

168
0:07:18.978,000 --> 0:07:2,000
BF: And you've actually called that the hubris syndrome.

169
0:07:21.645,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Can you talk about that?

170
0:07:22.911,000 --> 0:07:26,000
HT: Well, yes, I think hubris is our cancer in leadership.

171
0:07:27.003,000 --> 0:07:29,000
That's when leaders think they know it all,

172
0:07:29.629,000 --> 0:07:3,000
can do it all, have all the answers

173
0:07:31.628,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and don't think they need to surround themselves

174
0:07:33.891,000 --> 0:07:34,000
with people who will make them better,

175
0:07:35.789,000 --> 0:07:38,000
which to me would, in some cases, be more women and younger people

176
0:07:38.909,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and people who are diverse and have different opinions in general.

177
0:07:42.249,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Hubris syndrome is so present in leadership still,

178
0:07:46.197,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and we know many examples of them,

179
0:07:47.842,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I don't need to name them. And the problem with that --

180
0:07:50.878,000 --> 0:07:51,000
(Laughter)

181
0:07:51.903,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Yeah, we know them -- all over the world,

182
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
not just in this country.

183
0:07:55.797,000 --> 0:07:59,000
But that kind of leadership doesn't unleash leaders in others.

184
0:08:00.315,000 --> 0:08:01,000
No one person,

185
0:08:02.094,000 --> 0:08:06,000
or no one sector even has the solutions we now need to come up with --

186
0:08:06.625,000 --> 0:08:09,000
the creativity and collaboration we need.

187
0:08:10.542,000 --> 0:08:13,000
The bold and the brave leadership we need to come up with solutions

188
0:08:14.534,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that cross government, private sector, civil society, young people, older people,

189
0:08:19.405,000 --> 0:08:22,000
people of all different backgrounds coming together is the way

190
0:08:23.033,000 --> 0:08:25,000
to solve the issues that are in front of us.

191
0:08:25.15,000 --> 0:08:29,000
BF: Do you see that kind of leadership coming from the bottom-up

192
0:08:29.667,000 --> 0:08:3,000
or the top-down,

193
0:08:30.915,000 --> 0:08:32,000
or do you think a crisis is going to force us

194
0:08:33.624,000 --> 0:08:35,000
into a reexamination of all of this?

195
0:08:35.998,000 --> 0:08:38,000
HT: Well, as someone who lived through the most infamous financial meltdown

196
0:08:39.547,000 --> 0:08:4,000
in my home country, Iceland,

197
0:08:40.906,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I hope we don't need another one to learn or to wake up.

198
0:08:44.126,000 --> 0:08:47,000
But I do see that we can't choose one or the other.

199
0:08:47.875,000 --> 0:08:51,000
We do have to transform the way we lead --

200
0:08:52.17,000 --> 0:08:54,000
from the top, the boardroom, the CEOs --

201
0:08:54.408,000 --> 0:08:55,000
we really do have to transform that,

202
0:08:56.17,000 --> 0:08:58,000
but increasingly, we will transform that,

203
0:08:58.453,000 --> 0:09:,000
because we have these social movements coming from the bottom

204
0:09:01.459,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and throughout society.

205
0:09:03.224,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And the solutions exist.

206
0:09:05.622,000 --> 0:09:07,000
The only thing that's missing is will.

207
0:09:08.928,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So if we just all find a way to embrace a moral compass of our own

208
0:09:14.89,000 --> 0:09:18,000
to figure out why we exist and how we're going to lead,

209
0:09:19.505,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and if we embrace courage and humility in equal amounts,

210
0:09:23.463,000 --> 0:09:27,000
each one of us can be part of this 10-year period

211
0:09:28.135,000 --> 0:09:31,000
where we can dramatically transform the world we live in,

212
0:09:31.434,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and make it just,

213
0:09:32.939,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and make it about humanity and not just the financial markets.

214
0:09:36.347,000 --> 0:09:39,000
BF: Well, we have a lot of people here who I bet have questions for you,

215
0:09:39.948,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and we have a few minutes for questions,

216
0:09:41.878,000 --> 0:09:45,000
so is there anybody that would like to ask Halla a question?

217
0:09:46.64,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Audience: Hello, my name is Cheryl.

218
0:09:48.593,000 --> 0:09:49,000
I'm an aspiring leader,

219
0:09:50.317,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and I have a question about how you lead when you have no influence.

220
0:09:57.029,000 --> 0:09:59,000
If I'm just an analyst,

221
0:09:59.167,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and I want to speak to senior management

222
0:10:01.386,000 --> 0:10:03,000
about a change that I feel will affect the whole company,

223
0:10:04.352,000 --> 0:10:06,000
how do I go about changing their minds

224
0:10:06.768,000 --> 0:10:09,000
when they feel as if they've had relationships that are set,

225
0:10:10.651,000 --> 0:10:13,000
that their way of business is set?

226
0:10:13.889,000 --> 0:10:15,000
How do you change minds when you have no influence?

227
0:10:16.411,000 --> 0:10:18,000
HT: Well, thank you very much for that fantastic question.

228
0:10:19.172,000 --> 0:10:21,000
So sometimes people at the top won't listen,

229
0:10:21.98,000 --> 0:10:24,000
but it's interesting that with the low trust we have in society right now,

230
0:10:25.991,000 --> 0:10:26,000
the greatest trust we have

231
0:10:27.878,000 --> 0:10:3,000
is actually between the employee and the employer,

232
0:10:31.191,000 --> 0:10:32,000
according to recent research.

233
0:10:32.854,000 --> 0:10:36,000
So I think that relationship may be the most powerful way

234
0:10:36.93,000 --> 0:10:38,000
to actually transform the way we do things.

235
0:10:39.253,000 --> 0:10:43,000
So I would start by trying to build a coalition for your good idea.

236
0:10:43.897,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And I don't know a single leader today who will not listen to a concern

237
0:10:49.655,000 --> 0:10:5,000
that many of their employees hold.

238
0:10:51.738,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I'll give you an example from another B Team leader,

239
0:10:54.459,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce.

240
0:10:56.222,000 --> 0:10:59,000
He's really been outspoken on homelessness in San Francisco,

241
0:10:59.562,000 --> 0:11:03,000
on LGBTQI rights,

242
0:11:03.738,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and all of the things that he's been standing up for,

243
0:11:06.695,000 --> 0:11:09,000
he does because his employees care about them.

244
0:11:09.817,000 --> 0:11:13,000
So don't ever think you don't have power if you don't sit in a position of power.

245
0:11:14.067,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Find the way to go convince him ...

246
0:11:16.555,000 --> 0:11:17,000
or her.

247
0:11:17.745,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And Marc, for example, was convinced to close the gender pay gap by two women

248
0:11:22.384,000 --> 0:11:23,000
who worked inside of his organization,

249
0:11:24.334,000 --> 0:11:26,000
who told him, "We have a gender pay gap."

250
0:11:26.806,000 --> 0:11:28,000
He didn't believe it; he said, "Bring me the data."

251
0:11:29.237,000 --> 0:11:32,000
They did, and he was smart enough to know he needed to do something about it,

252
0:11:32.96,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and was one the first tech leaders to step up and do so voluntarily.

253
0:11:36.656,000 --> 0:11:38,000
So don't ever think that you don't have power,

254
0:11:39.07,000 --> 0:11:41,000
even if you don't sit in a position of power,

255
0:11:41.536,000 --> 0:11:43,000
but find other people to support you

256
0:11:44.375,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and make the case.

257
0:11:47.965,000 --> 0:11:48,000
BF: Thank you.

258
0:11:49.139,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Anybody else? Any other questions?

259
0:11:50.851,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Audience: Hi, I'm overwhelmed by fascination

260
0:11:52.647,000 --> 0:11:54,000
with everything you're saying, so thank you.

261
0:11:55.25,000 --> 0:11:59,000
I just wanted to ask how, like, diversity in opinion and thought

262
0:11:59.689,000 --> 0:12:,000
and also background

263
0:12:01.047,000 --> 0:12:03,000
has impacted your leadership ability.

264
0:12:03.374,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And what do you think is the barricade that is limiting the overflow of diversity

265
0:12:08.389,000 --> 0:12:09,000
in all business settings,

266
0:12:10.06,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and what do you think can impact the change in that setting

267
0:12:13.961,000 --> 0:12:18,000
but also to disrupt the overflow of generations of people staying in place?

268
0:12:19.766,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And what do you think is the next step to breaking several glass ceilings?

269
0:12:24.848,000 --> 0:12:26,000
BF: We're going to do an entire Salon just on that question.

270
0:12:27.776,000 --> 0:12:28,000
(Laughter)

271
0:12:28.911,000 --> 0:12:3,000
HT: I think Bryn said it well, but let me try and touch on it.

272
0:12:31.901,000 --> 0:12:35,000
So the way I see gender, it is a spectrum --

273
0:12:36.586,000 --> 0:12:37,000
you know, men also have gender.

274
0:12:38.139,000 --> 0:12:4,000
We sometimes forget about that.

275
0:12:40.566,000 --> 0:12:41,000
(Laughter)

276
0:12:41.591,000 --> 0:12:42,000
We sometimes forget about that.

277
0:12:43.093,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And I actually played a very masculine woman early in my career,

278
0:12:46.718,000 --> 0:12:47,000
because those were the rules of the game.

279
0:12:48.696,000 --> 0:12:49,000
And I achieved some success with it,

280
0:12:50.437,000 --> 0:12:51,000
but fortunately, I got to a place

281
0:12:52.096,000 --> 0:12:54,000
where I started embracing my feminine side as well.

282
0:12:54.588,000 --> 0:12:56,000
But I would still say that the best leaders embrace both,

283
0:12:57.407,000 --> 0:12:58,000
both women and men.

284
0:12:58.836,000 --> 0:12:59,000
But I see gender, also,

285
0:13:00.491,000 --> 0:13:04,000
as one of the most powerful levers to shift values in culture.

286
0:13:04.674,000 --> 0:13:06,000
So the reason I'm so passionate about women in leadership

287
0:13:07.473,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and believe that balance is needed

288
0:13:10.965,000 --> 0:13:15,000
is because right now, our definition of success is incredibly masculine.

289
0:13:16.526,000 --> 0:13:2,000
It's about financial profit alone or economic growth alone,

290
0:13:20.833,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and we all know that we need more than money.

291
0:13:23.212,000 --> 0:13:25,000
I mean, we need wellness:

292
0:13:25.543,000 --> 0:13:26,000
well-being of people,

293
0:13:27.042,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and there is no future beyond the well-being of our planet.

294
0:13:31.243,000 --> 0:13:34,000
So I think gender may very well be one of the most powerful levers

295
0:13:35.12,000 --> 0:13:38,000
to help all of us shift our economic and social systems

296
0:13:38.749,000 --> 0:13:39,000
to be more welcoming.

297
0:13:40.193,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And the answer to your last part --

298
0:13:41.915,000 --> 0:13:44,000
it's so complicated, but let me try to give you a short one.

299
0:13:45.526,000 --> 0:13:51,000
I believe that the way talent and consumption is shifting

300
0:13:51.767,000 --> 0:13:53,000
is going to increasingly get companies

301
0:13:54.532,000 --> 0:13:57,000
to look at adding difference into their leadership,

302
0:13:58.362,000 --> 0:14:,000
because sameness is not working --

303
0:14:00.858,000 --> 0:14:01,000
BF: And difference is a superpower.

304
0:14:02.593,000 --> 0:14:03,000
HT: Difference is a superpower.

305
0:14:04.095,000 --> 0:14:05,000
BF: Thank you very much.

306
0:14:05.348,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Halla, thank you so much, I wish we could talk to you all day.

307
0:14:08.287,000 --> 0:14:09,000
(Applause and cheers)

308
0:14:09.312,000 --> 0:14:1,000
HT: Thank you.

309
0:14:10.487,000 --> 0:14:11,000
(Applause)

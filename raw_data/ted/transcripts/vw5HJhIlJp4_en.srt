1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
We do not invest in victims,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
we invest in survivors.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And in ways both big and small,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
the narrative of the victim

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
shapes the way we see women.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
You can't count what you don't see.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And we don't invest in what's invisible to us.

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
But this is the face

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
of resilience.

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Six years ago,

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I started writing about women entrepreneurs

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
during and after conflict.

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I set out to write a compelling economic story,

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
one that had great characters, that no one else was telling,

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and one that I thought mattered.

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And that turned out to be women.

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I had left ABC news and a career I loved at the age of 30

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
for business school,

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
a path I knew almost nothing about.

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
None of the women I had grown up with in Maryland

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
had graduated from college,

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
let alone considered business school.

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But they had hustled to feed their kids

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and pay their rent.

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And I saw from a young age

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that having a decent job and earning a good living

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
made the biggest difference

28
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
for families who were struggling.

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So if you're going to talk about jobs,

30
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
then you have to talk about entrepreneurs.

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And if you're talking about entrepreneurs

32
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
in conflict and post-conflict settings,

33
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
then you must talk about women,

34
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
because they are the population you have left.

35
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Rwanda in the immediate aftermath of the genocide

36
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
was 77 percent female.

37
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I want to introduce you

38
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
to some of those entrepreneurs I've met

39
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and share with you some of what they've taught me over the years.

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I went to Afghanistan in 2005

41
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
to work on a Financial Times piece,

42
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and there I met Kamila,

43
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
a young women who told me she had just turned down

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
a job with the international community

45
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
that would have paid her nearly $2,000 a month --

46
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
an astronomical sum in that context.

47
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And she had turned it down, she said,

48
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
because she was going to start her next business,

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
an entrepreneurship consultancy

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that would teach business skills

51
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to men and women all around Afghanistan.

52
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Business, she said,

53
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
was critical to her country's future.

54
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Because long after this round of internationals left,

55
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
business would help keep her country

56
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
peaceful and secure.

57
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And she said business was even more important for women

58
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
because earning an income earned respect

59
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and money was power for women.

60
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So I was amazed.

61
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I mean here was a girl who had never lived in peace time

62
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
who somehow had come to sound like a candidate from "The Apprentice."

63
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
(Laughter)

64
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So I asked her, "How in the world do you know this much about business?

65
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Why are you so passionate?"

66
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
She said, "Oh Gayle, this is actually my third business.

67
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
My first business was a dressmaking business

68
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
I started under the Taliban.

69
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And that was actually an excellent business,

70
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
because we provided jobs for women all around our neighborhood.

71
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And that's really how I became an entrepreneur."

72
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Think about this:

73
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Here were girls who braved danger

74
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
to become breadwinners

75
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
during years in which they couldn't even be on their streets.

76
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And at a time of economic collapse

77
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
when people sold baby dolls and shoe laces

78
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and windows and doors

79
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
just to survive,

80
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
these girls made the difference

81
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
between survival and starvation

82
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
for so many.

83
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I couldn't leave the story, and I couldn't leave the topic either,

84
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
because everywhere I went I met more of these women

85
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
who no one seemed to know about,

86
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
or even wish to.

87
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I went on to Bosnia,

88
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and early on in my interviews I met with an IMF official

89
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
who said, "You know, Gayle,

90
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I don't think we actually have women in business in Bosnia,

91
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
but there is a lady selling cheese nearby

92
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
on the side of the road.

93
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So maybe you could interview her."

94
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So I went out reporting

95
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and within a day I met Narcisa Kavazovic

96
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
who at that point was opening a new factory

97
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
on the war's former front lines in Sarajevo.

98
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
She had started her business

99
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
squatting in an abandoned garage,

100
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
sewing sheets and pillow cases

101
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
she would take to markets all around the city

102
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
so that she could support

103
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
the 12 or 13 family members

104
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
who were counting on her for survival.

105
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
By the time we met, she had 20 employees,

106
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
most of them women,

107
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
who were sending their boys and their girls to school.

108
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And she was just the start.

109
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I met women running essential oils businesses,

110
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
wineries

111
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and even the country's largest advertising agency.

112
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So these stories together

113
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
became the Herald Tribune business cover.

114
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And when this story posted,

115
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I ran to my computer to send it to the IMF official.

116
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And I said, "Just in case you're looking for entrepreneurs

117
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to feature at your next investment conference,

118
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
here are a couple of women."

119
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Applause)

120
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
But think about this.

121
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
The IMF official is hardly the only person

122
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
to automatically file women under micro.

123
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
The biases, whether intentional or otherwise,

124
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
are pervasive,

125
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and so are the misleading mental images.

126
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
If you see the word "microfinance,"

127
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
what comes to mind?

128
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Most people say women.

129
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And if you see the word "entrepreneur,"

130
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
most people think men.

131
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Why is that?

132
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Because we aim low and we think small

133
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
when it comes to women.

134
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Microfinance is an incredibly powerful tool

135
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
that leads to self-sufficiency and self-respect,

136
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
but we must move beyond micro-hopes

137
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and micro-ambitions for women,

138
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
because they have so much greater hopes for themselves.

139
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
They want to move from micro to medium and beyond.

140
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And in many places,

141
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
they're there.

142
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
In the U.S., women-owned businesses

143
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
will create five and a half million new jobs by 2018.

144
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
In South Korea and Indonesia,

145
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
women own nearly half a million firms.

146
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
China, women run 20 percent

147
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
of all small businesses.

148
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And in the developing world overall,

149
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
That figure is 40 to 50 percent.

150
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Nearly everywhere I go,

151
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I meet incredibly interesting entrepreneurs

152
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
who are seeking access to finance, access to markets

153
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and established business networks.

154
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
They are often ignored

155
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
because they're harder to help.

156
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
It is much riskier to give a 50,000 dollar loan

157
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
than it is to give a 500 dollar loan.

158
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And as the World Bank recently noted,

159
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
women are stuck in a productivity trap.

160
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Those in small businesses

161
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
can't get the capital they need to expand

162
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and those in microbusiness

163
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
can't grow out of them.

164
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Recently I was at the State Department in Washington

165
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and I met an incredibly passionate entrepreneur from Ghana.

166
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
She sells chocolates.

167
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
And she had come to Washington,

168
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
not seeking a handout and not seeking a microloan.

169
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
She had come seeking serious investment dollars

170
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
so that she could build the factory

171
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and buy the equipment she needs

172
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
to export her chocolates

173
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
to Africa, Europe, the Middle East

174
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and far beyond --

175
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
capital that would help her to employ

176
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
more than the 20 people

177
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that she already has working for her,

178
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and capital that would fuel her own country's

179
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
economic climb.

180
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
The great news is

181
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
we already know what works.

182
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Theory and empirical evidence

183
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Have already taught us.

184
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
We don't need to invent solutions because we have them --

185
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
cash flow loans

186
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
based in income rather than assets,

187
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
loans that use secure contracts rather than collateral,

188
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
because women often don't own land.

189
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And Kiva.org, the microlender,

190
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
is actually now experimenting with crowdsourcing

191
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
small and medium sized loans.

192
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And that's just to start.

193
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Recently it has become very much in fashion

194
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
to call women "the emerging market of the emerging market."

195
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
I think that is terrific.

196
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
You know why?

197
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Because -- and I say this as somebody who worked in finance --

198
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
500 billion dollars at least

199
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
has gone into the emerging markets in the past decade.

200
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Because investors saw the potential for return

201
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
at a time of slowing economic growth,

202
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and so they created financial products

203
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and financial innovation

204
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
tailored to the emerging markets.

205
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
How wonderful would it be

206
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
if we were prepared to replace all of our lofty words

207
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
with our wallets

208
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and invest 500 billion dollars

209
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
unleashing women's economic potential?

210
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Just think of the benefits

211
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
when it comes to jobs, productivity,

212
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
employment, child nutrition,

213
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
maternal mortality, literacy

214
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and much, much more.

215
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Because, as the World Economic Forum noted,

216
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
smaller gender gaps are directly correlated

217
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
with increased economic competitiveness.

218
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And not one country in all the world

219
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
has eliminated its economic participation gap --

220
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
not one.

221
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So the great news

222
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
is this is an incredible opportunity.

223
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
We have so much room to grow.

224
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So you see,

225
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
this is not about doing good,

226
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
this is about global growth

227
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and global employment.

228
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
It is about how we invest

229
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and it's about how we see women.

230
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And women can no longer be

231
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
both half the population

232
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and a special interest group.

233
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
(Applause)

234
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Oftentimes I get into very interesting discussions with reporters

235
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
who say to me, "Gayle, these are great stories,

236
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
but you're really writing about the exceptions."

237
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Now that makes me pause for just a couple reasons.

238
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
First of all, for exceptions,

239
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
there are a lot of them

240
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and they're important.

241
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Secondly, when we talk about men who are succeeding,

242
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
we rightly consider them

243
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
icons or pioneers or innovators

244
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
to be emulated.

245
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And when we talk about women,

246
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
they are either exceptions to be dismissed

247
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
or aberrations to be ignored.

248
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And finally,

249
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
there is no society anywhere in all the world

250
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
that is not changed

251
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
except by its most exceptional.

252
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
So why wouldn't we celebrate and elevate

253
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
these change makers and job creators

254
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
rather than overlook them?

255
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
This topic of resilience is very personal to me

256
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and in many ways has shaped my life.

257
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
My mom was a single mom

258
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
who worked at the phone company during the day

259
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and sold Tupperware at night

260
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
so that I could have every opportunity possible.

261
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
We shopped double coupons

262
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and layaway and consignment stores,

263
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and when she got sick with stage four breast cancer

264
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and could no longer work,

265
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
we even applied for food stamps.

266
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And when I would feel sorry for myself

267
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
as nine or 10 year-old girls do,

268
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
she would say to me, "My dear, on a scale of major world tragedies,

269
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
yours is not a three."

270
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
(Laughter)

271
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And when I was applying to business school

272
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and felt certain I couldn't do it

273
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and nobody I knew had done it,

274
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
I went to my aunt who survived years of beatings at the hand of her husband

275
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and escaped a marriage of abuse

276
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
with only her dignity intact.

277
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And she told me,

278
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
"Never import other people's limitations."

279
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And when I complained to my grandmother,

280
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
a World War II veteran

281
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
who worked in film for 50 years

282
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and who supported me from the age of 13,

283
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
that I was terrified

284
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
that if I turned down a plum assignment at ABC

285
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
for a fellowship overseas,

286
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
I would never ever, ever find another job,

287
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
she said, "Kiddo, I'm going to tell you two things.

288
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
First of all, no one turns down a Fulbright,

289
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and secondly, McDonald's is always hiring."

290
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
(Laughter)

291
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
"You will find a job. Take the leap."

292
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
The women in my family

293
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
are not exceptions.

294
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
The women in this room and watching in L.A.

295
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and all around the world

296
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
are not exceptions.

297
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
We are not a special interest group.

298
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
We are the majority.

299
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And for far too long,

300
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
we have underestimated ourselves

301
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and been undervalued by others.

302
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
It is time for us to aim higher

303
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
when it comes to women,

304
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
to invest more and to deploy our dollars

305
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
to benefit women all around the world.

306
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
We can make a difference,

307
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and make a difference, not just for women,

308
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
but for a global economy

309
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
that desperately needs their contributions.

310
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Together we can make certain

311
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
that the so-called exceptions

312
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
begin to rule.

313
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
When we change the way we see ourselves,

314
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
others will follow.

315
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
And it is time for all of us

316
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
to think bigger.

317
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Thank you very much.

318
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
(Applause)

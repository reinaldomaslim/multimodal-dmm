Translator: Camille Martínez

2
0:00:13.62,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm a journalist,

3
0:00:14.891,000 --> 0:00:15,000
and I'm an immigrant.

4
0:00:16.854,000 --> 0:00:19,000
And these two conditions define me.

5
0:00:20.108,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I was born in Mexico,

6
0:00:21.55,000 --> 0:00:24,000
but I've spent more than half my life reporting in the United States,

7
0:00:25.3,000 --> 0:00:27,000
a country which was itself created by immigrants.

8
0:00:28.308,000 --> 0:00:3,000
As a reporter

9
0:00:31.242,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and as a foreigner,

10
0:00:32.968,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I've learned that neutrality,

11
0:00:36.139,000 --> 0:00:37,000
silence

12
0:00:37.844,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and fear aren't the best options --

13
0:00:40.75,000 --> 0:00:42,000
not in journalism, nor in life.

14
0:00:42.978,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Neutrality

15
0:00:45.046,000 --> 0:00:48,000
is often an excuse that we journalists use

16
0:00:48.276,000 --> 0:00:51,000
to hide from our true responsibility.

17
0:00:51.609,000 --> 0:00:52,000
What is that responsibility?

18
0:00:54.12,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It is to question

19
0:00:56.052,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and to challenge

20
0:00:57.589,000 --> 0:00:58,000
those in positions of power.

21
0:00:58.97,000 --> 0:00:59,000
That's what journalism is for.

22
0:01:00.453,000 --> 0:01:01,000
That's the beauty of journalism:

23
0:01:02.252,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to question and challenge the powerful.

24
0:01:05.401,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Of course, we have the obligation to report reality as it is,

25
0:01:08.862,000 --> 0:01:09,000
not how we would like it to be.

26
0:01:10.624,000 --> 0:01:13,000
In that sense, I agree with the principle of objectivity:

27
0:01:14.104,000 --> 0:01:16,000
if a house is blue, I say that it's blue.

28
0:01:16.586,000 --> 0:01:19,000
If there are a million unemployed people, I say there are a million.

29
0:01:19.838,000 --> 0:01:2,000
But neutrality

30
0:01:21.142,000 --> 0:01:24,000
won't necessarily lead me to the truth.

31
0:01:25.021,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Even if I'm unequivocally scrupulous,

32
0:01:28.584,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and I present both sides of a news item --

33
0:01:32.928,000 --> 0:01:34,000
the Democratic and the Republican,

34
0:01:35.063,000 --> 0:01:36,000
the liberal and the conservative,

35
0:01:36.724,000 --> 0:01:37,000
the government's and the opposition's --

36
0:01:38.697,000 --> 0:01:4,000
in the end, I have no guarantee,

37
0:01:41.18,000 --> 0:01:44,000
nor are any of us guaranteed that we'll know what's true

38
0:01:44.395,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and what's not true.

39
0:01:45.827,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Life is much more complicated,

40
0:01:47.752,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and I believe journalism should reflect that very complexity.

41
0:01:53.522,000 --> 0:01:55,000
To be clear: I refuse

42
0:01:57.154,000 --> 0:01:58,000
to be a tape recorder.

43
0:01:58.52,000 --> 0:02:,000
I didn't become a journalist to be a tape recorder.

44
0:02:00.953,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I know what you're going to say: no one uses tape recorders nowadays.

45
0:02:04.285,000 --> 0:02:05,000
(Laughter)

46
0:02:05.376,000 --> 0:02:08,000
In that case, I refuse to take out my cell phone

47
0:02:09.19,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and hit the record button

48
0:02:11.643,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and point it in front of me as if I were at a concert,

49
0:02:14.297,000 --> 0:02:15,000
like a fan at a concert.

50
0:02:16.346,000 --> 0:02:18,000
That is not true journalism.

51
0:02:18.94,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Contrary to what many people think,

52
0:02:21.344,000 --> 0:02:25,000
journalists are making value judgments all the time,

53
0:02:25.917,000 --> 0:02:26,000
ethical and moral judgments.

54
0:02:27.79,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And we're always making decisions that are exceedingly personal

55
0:02:33.642,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and extraordinarily subjective.

56
0:02:35.831,000 --> 0:02:36,000
For example:

57
0:02:37.797,000 --> 0:02:39,000
What happens if you're called to cover a dictatorship,

58
0:02:40.4,000 --> 0:02:42,000
like Augusto Pinochet's regime in Chile

59
0:02:42.489,000 --> 0:02:44,000
or Fidel Castro's in Cuba?

60
0:02:45.333,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Are you going to report only what the general and commander want,

61
0:02:49.106,000 --> 0:02:5,000
or will you confront them?

62
0:02:50.997,000 --> 0:02:53,000
What happens if you find out that in your country

63
0:02:54.919,000 --> 0:02:55,000
or in the country next door,

64
0:02:56.761,000 --> 0:02:59,000
students are disappearing

65
0:02:59.797,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and hidden graves are appearing,

66
0:03:01.822,000 --> 0:03:03,000
or that millions of dollars are disappearing from the budget

67
0:03:04.814,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and that ex-presidents are magically now multimillionaires?

68
0:03:09.248,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Will you report only the official version?

69
0:03:11.321,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Or what happens

70
0:03:13.445,000 --> 0:03:14,000
if you're assigned to cover

71
0:03:15.766,000 --> 0:03:2,000
the presidential elections of the primary superpower,

72
0:03:20.813,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and one of the candidates makes comments that are racist,

73
0:03:26.397,000 --> 0:03:27,000
sexist

74
0:03:28.064,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and xenophobic?

75
0:03:31.004,000 --> 0:03:32,000
That happened to me.

76
0:03:33.098,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And I want to tell you what I did,

77
0:03:34.998,000 --> 0:03:36,000
but first, let me explain where I'm coming from,

78
0:03:37.59,000 --> 0:03:39,000
so you can understand my reaction.

79
0:03:42.51,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I grew up in Mexico City, the oldest of five brothers,

80
0:03:45.418,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and our family simply couldn't afford to pay for all of our college tuition.

81
0:03:50.114,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So I studied in the morning, and worked in the afternoon.

82
0:03:53.552,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Eventually,

83
0:03:55.838,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I got the job I had always wanted:

84
0:03:58.975,000 --> 0:03:59,000
television reporter.

85
0:04:00.324,000 --> 0:04:01,000
It was a big opportunity.

86
0:04:02.048,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But as I was working on my third story, I ended up

87
0:04:05.645,000 --> 0:04:06,000
criticizing the president,

88
0:04:07.676,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and questioning the lack of democracy in Mexico.

89
0:04:11.154,000 --> 0:04:15,000
In Mexico, from 1929 to 2000, elections were always rigged;

90
0:04:16.049,000 --> 0:04:2,000
the incumbent president would hand-pick his successor.

91
0:04:20.217,000 --> 0:04:23,000
That's not true democracy.

92
0:04:23.603,000 --> 0:04:26,000
To me it seemed like a brilliant idea to expose the president,

93
0:04:26.632,000 --> 0:04:27,000
but to my boss --

94
0:04:27.883,000 --> 0:04:28,000
(Laughter)

95
0:04:29.74,000 --> 0:04:31,000
My boss didn't think it was such a great idea.

96
0:04:31.97,000 --> 0:04:34,000
At that time, the presidential office, Los Pinos, had issued a direct censor

97
0:04:35.721,000 --> 0:04:36,000
against the media.

98
0:04:37.219,000 --> 0:04:4,000
My boss, who, aside from being in charge of the show I worked for,

99
0:04:41.005,000 --> 0:04:44,000
was also in charge of a soccer team.

100
0:04:44.884,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I always suspected that he was more interested in goals

101
0:04:47.716,000 --> 0:04:48,000
than in the news.

102
0:04:49.118,000 --> 0:04:5,000
He censored my report.

103
0:04:50.95,000 --> 0:04:52,000
He asked me to change it, I said no,

104
0:04:53.095,000 --> 0:04:55,000
so he put another journalist on the story

105
0:04:56.055,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to write what I was supposed to say.

106
0:04:59.809,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I did not want to be a censored journalist.

107
0:05:03.398,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I don't know where I found the strength,

108
0:05:05.677,000 --> 0:05:06,000
but I wrote my letter of resignation.

109
0:05:07.972,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And so at 24 years of age -- just 24 --

110
0:05:12.302,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I made the most difficult and most transcendental decision of my life.

111
0:05:15.698,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Not only did I resign from television,

112
0:05:17.875,000 --> 0:05:19,000
but I had also decided to leave my country.

113
0:05:21.328,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I sold my car, a beat-up little red Volkswagen,

114
0:05:25.069,000 --> 0:05:26,000
came up with some money

115
0:05:26.884,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and said goodbye to my family,

116
0:05:28.682,000 --> 0:05:29,000
to my friends,

117
0:05:29.905,000 --> 0:05:3,000
to my streets,

118
0:05:31.285,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to my favorite haunts -- to my tacos --

119
0:05:33.398,000 --> 0:05:34,000
(Laughter)

120
0:05:34.699,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and I bought a one-way ticket

121
0:05:36.92,000 --> 0:05:37,000
to Los Angeles, California.

122
0:05:39.123,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And so I became

123
0:05:41.052,000 --> 0:05:45,000
one of the 250 million immigrants that exist in the world.

124
0:05:45.902,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Ask any immigrant

125
0:05:47.742,000 --> 0:05:49,000
about the first day they arrived in their new country,

126
0:05:50.312,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and you'll find that they remember absolutely everything,

127
0:05:53.063,000 --> 0:05:55,000
like it was a movie with background music.

128
0:05:55.145,000 --> 0:05:58,000
In my case, I arrived in Los Angeles, the sun was setting,

129
0:05:59.161,000 --> 0:06:,000
and everything I owned --

130
0:06:00.926,000 --> 0:06:02,000
a guitar, a suitcase and some documents --

131
0:06:03.558,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I could carry all of it

132
0:06:05.959,000 --> 0:06:06,000
with my two hands.

133
0:06:07.142,000 --> 0:06:09,000
That feeling of absolute freedom,

134
0:06:10.108,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I haven't experienced since.

135
0:06:11.913,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And I survived with what little I had.

136
0:06:15.35,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I obtained a student visa; I was studying.

137
0:06:19.976,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I ate a lot of lettuce and bread, because that's all I had.

138
0:06:22.955,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Finally, in 1984,

139
0:06:26.008,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I landed my first job as a TV reporter in the United States.

140
0:06:30.255,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And the first thing I noticed was that in the US,

141
0:06:34.326,000 --> 0:06:36,000
my colleagues criticized -- and mercilessly --

142
0:06:36.533,000 --> 0:06:37,000
then president Ronald Reagan,

143
0:06:38.042,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and absolutely nothing happened; no one censored them.

144
0:06:40.954,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And I thought:

145
0:06:42.666,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I love this country.

146
0:06:44.188,000 --> 0:06:46,000
(Laughter)

147
0:06:47.146,000 --> 0:06:5,000
(Applause)

148
0:06:50.542,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And that's how it's been

149
0:06:52.709,000 --> 0:06:53,000
for more than 30 years:

150
0:06:55.181,000 --> 0:06:56,000
reporting with total freedom,

151
0:06:57.135,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and being treated as an equal despite being an immigrant --

152
0:07:00.065,000 --> 0:07:01,000
until, without warning,

153
0:07:01.739,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I was assigned to cover the recent US presidential election.

154
0:07:08.356,000 --> 0:07:11,000
On June 16, 2015,

155
0:07:12.148,000 --> 0:07:16,000
a candidate who would eventually become the president of the United States

156
0:07:16.265,000 --> 0:07:18,000
said that Mexican immigrants

157
0:07:20.268,000 --> 0:07:21,000
were criminals,

158
0:07:23.096,000 --> 0:07:24,000
drug traffickers

159
0:07:24.928,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and rapists.

160
0:07:26.112,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And I knew

161
0:07:28.125,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that he was lying.

162
0:07:29.301,000 --> 0:07:31,000
I knew he was wrong for one very simple reason:

163
0:07:32.166,000 --> 0:07:33,000
I'm a Mexican immigrant.

164
0:07:34.277,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And we're not like that.

165
0:07:35.66,000 --> 0:07:38,000
So I did what any other reporter would have done:

166
0:07:39.933,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I wrote him a letter by hand

167
0:07:42.993,000 --> 0:07:43,000
requesting an interview,

168
0:07:44.788,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and I sent it to his Tower in New York.

169
0:07:47.19,000 --> 0:07:48,000
The next day

170
0:07:49.105,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I was at work,

171
0:07:50.328,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and I suddenly began to receive hundreds of calls and texts

172
0:07:53.925,000 --> 0:07:54,000
on my cell phone,

173
0:07:55.438,000 --> 0:07:56,000
some more insulting than others.

174
0:07:57.004,000 --> 0:08:,000
I didn't know what was happening until my friend came into my office

175
0:08:00.525,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and said, "They published your cell number online."

176
0:08:05.428,000 --> 0:08:06,000
They actually did that.

177
0:08:07.764,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Here's the letter they sent

178
0:08:11.162,000 --> 0:08:13,000
where they gave out my number.

179
0:08:13.8,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Don't bother writing it down, OK? I already changed it.

180
0:08:16.486,000 --> 0:08:17,000
(Laughter)

181
0:08:18.022,000 --> 0:08:19,000
But I learned two things.

182
0:08:19.654,000 --> 0:08:22,000
The first one is that you should never, never, ever

183
0:08:24.129,000 --> 0:08:26,000
give your cell number to Donald Trump.

184
0:08:27.018,000 --> 0:08:29,000
(Laughter)

185
0:08:29.846,000 --> 0:08:32,000
(Applause)

186
0:08:33.246,000 --> 0:08:37,000
The second lesson was that I needed to stop being neutral

187
0:08:37.607,000 --> 0:08:38,000
at that point.

188
0:08:38.792,000 --> 0:08:4,000
From then on, my mission as a journalist changed.

189
0:08:41.497,000 --> 0:08:43,000
I would confront the candidate

190
0:08:44.143,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and show that he was wrong,

191
0:08:45.816,000 --> 0:08:48,000
that what he said about immigrants in the US was not true.

192
0:08:49.19,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Let me give you some figures.

193
0:08:50.632,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Ninety-seven percent of all undocumented people in the United States

194
0:08:54.826,000 --> 0:08:55,000
are good people.

195
0:08:56.158,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Less than three percent have committed a serious crime,

196
0:08:59.035,000 --> 0:09:,000
or "felony," as they say in English.

197
0:09:00.791,000 --> 0:09:04,000
In comparison, six percent of US citizens have committed a serious crime.

198
0:09:05.385,000 --> 0:09:1,000
The conclusion is that undocumented immigrants behave much better

199
0:09:11.247,000 --> 0:09:12,000
than US citizens.

200
0:09:12.784,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Based on that data, I made a plan.

201
0:09:15.652,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Eight weeks after they published my cell number,

202
0:09:19.874,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I obtained a press pass for a press conference

203
0:09:22.613,000 --> 0:09:25,000
for the candidate gaining momentum in the polls.

204
0:09:26.062,000 --> 0:09:27,000
I decided to confront him

205
0:09:28.361,000 --> 0:09:29,000
in person.

206
0:09:30.34,000 --> 0:09:31,000
But ...

207
0:09:32.192,000 --> 0:09:35,000
things didn't turn out exactly as I had planned; watch:

208
0:09:37.349,000 --> 0:09:39,000
[Donald Trump Press Conference Dubuque, Iowa]

209
0:09:42.709,000 --> 0:09:45,000
(Video) Jorge Ramos: Mr. Trump, I have a question about immigration.

210
0:09:45.933,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Donald Trump: Who's next? Yes, please.

211
0:09:47.823,000 --> 0:09:49,000
JR: Your immigration plan is full of empty promises.

212
0:09:50.284,000 --> 0:09:52,000
DT: Excuse me, you weren't called. Sit down. Sit down!

213
0:09:52.841,000 --> 0:09:54,000
JR: I'm a reporter; as an immigrant and as a US citizen,

214
0:09:55.543,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I have the right to ask a question.

215
0:09:57.242,000 --> 0:09:59,000
DT: No you don't. JR: I have the right to ask --

216
0:09:59.549,000 --> 0:10:,000
DT: Go back to Univision.

217
0:10:00.766,000 --> 0:10:01,000
JR: This is the question:

218
0:10:01.986,000 --> 0:10:03,000
You cannot deport 11 million people.

219
0:10:04.828,000 --> 0:10:07,000
You cannot build a 1900-mile wall.

220
0:10:08.015,000 --> 0:10:11,000
You cannot deny citizenship to children in this country.

221
0:10:11.724,000 --> 0:10:12,000
DT: Sit down. JR: And with those ideas --

222
0:10:13.689,000 --> 0:10:14,000
DT: You weren't called.

223
0:10:14.865,000 --> 0:10:16,000
JR: I'm a reporter and I have -- Don't touch me, sir.

224
0:10:17.913,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Guard 1: Please don't disrupt. You're being disruptive.

225
0:10:20.535,000 --> 0:10:23,000
JR: I have the right to ask a question. G1: Yes, in order. In turn, sir.

226
0:10:24.117,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Guard 2: Do you have your media credential?

227
0:10:26.162,000 --> 0:10:27,000
JR: I have the right --

228
0:10:27.339,000 --> 0:10:29,000
G2: Where? Let me see. JR: It's over there.

229
0:10:29.372,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Man: Whoever's coming out, stay out.

230
0:10:31.126,000 --> 0:10:32,000
G2: You've just got to wait your turn.

231
0:10:32.992,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Man: You're very rude. It's not about you.

232
0:10:35.043,000 --> 0:10:37,000
JR: It's not about you -- Man: Get out of my country!

233
0:10:37.595,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Man: It's not about you.

234
0:10:38.788,000 --> 0:10:39,000
JR: I'm a US citizen, too.

235
0:10:40.064,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Man: Well ...whatever. No, Univision. It's not about you.

236
0:10:42.765,000 --> 0:10:44,000
JR: It's not about you. It's about the United States.

237
0:10:48.095,000 --> 0:10:5,000
(Applause)

238
0:10:59.181,000 --> 0:11:,000
(Applause ends)

239
0:11:02.771,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Whenever I see that video,

240
0:11:04.63,000 --> 0:11:07,000
the first thing I always think is that hate

241
0:11:07.944,000 --> 0:11:08,000
is contagious.

242
0:11:09.237,000 --> 0:11:13,000
If you notice, after the candidate says, "Go back to Univision" -- that's code;

243
0:11:13.551,000 --> 0:11:15,000
what he's telling me is, "Get out of here."

244
0:11:15.77,000 --> 0:11:18,000
One member of his entourage, as if he had been given permission, said,

245
0:11:19.631,000 --> 0:11:21,000
"Get out of my country,"

246
0:11:22.05,000 --> 0:11:24,000
not knowing that I'm also a US citizen.

247
0:11:26.903,000 --> 0:11:28,000
After watching this video many times,

248
0:11:29.44,000 --> 0:11:31,000
I also think that in order to break free from neutrality --

249
0:11:32.458,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and for it to be a true break --

250
0:11:34.031,000 --> 0:11:36,000
one has to lose their fear,

251
0:11:36.227,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and then learn how to say, "No;

252
0:11:38.456,000 --> 0:11:39,000
I'm not going to be quiet.

253
0:11:40.568,000 --> 0:11:41,000
I'm not going to sit down.

254
0:11:42.899,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And I'm not going to leave."

255
0:11:44.795,000 --> 0:11:45,000
The word "no" --

256
0:11:46.304,000 --> 0:11:5,000
(Applause)

257
0:11:50.933,000 --> 0:11:53,000
"no" is the most powerful word that exists in any language,

258
0:11:54.829,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and it always precedes any important change in our lives.

259
0:11:58.125,000 --> 0:12:,000
And I think there's enormous dignity

260
0:12:00.342,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and it generates a great deal of respect

261
0:12:02.296,000 --> 0:12:03,000
to be able to step back

262
0:12:03.849,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and to push back and say,

263
0:12:06.009,000 --> 0:12:07,000
"No."

264
0:12:07.199,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Elie Wiesel -- Holocaust survivor,

265
0:12:09.805,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Nobel Peace Prize recipient

266
0:12:11.163,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and who, unfortunately, we lost very recently --

267
0:12:14.001,000 --> 0:12:16,000
said some very wise words:

268
0:12:16.352,000 --> 0:12:17,000
"We must take a side.

269
0:12:18.776,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Neutrality helps only the oppressor,

270
0:12:21.316,000 --> 0:12:22,000
never the victim."

271
0:12:22.491,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And he's completely right.

272
0:12:23.76,000 --> 0:12:26,000
We journalists are obligated to take sides in certain circumstances;

273
0:12:27.626,000 --> 0:12:28,000
in cases of racism,

274
0:12:29.476,000 --> 0:12:3,000
discrimination,

275
0:12:31.246,000 --> 0:12:32,000
corruption,

276
0:12:32.641,000 --> 0:12:33,000
lying to the public,

277
0:12:34.149,000 --> 0:12:35,000
dictatorships and human rights,

278
0:12:36.085,000 --> 0:12:38,000
we need to set aside neutrality and indifference.

279
0:12:39.616,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Spanish has a great word

280
0:12:42.14,000 --> 0:12:46,000
to describe the stance that journalists should take.

281
0:12:46.203,000 --> 0:12:48,000
The word is "contrapoder [anti-establishment]."

282
0:12:48.465,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Basically, we journalists should be on the opposite side

283
0:12:52.386,000 --> 0:12:53,000
from those in power.

284
0:12:54.002,000 --> 0:12:56,000
But if you're in bed with politicians,

285
0:12:56.6,000 --> 0:12:58,000
if you go to the baptism or wedding of the governor's son

286
0:12:59.321,000 --> 0:13:01,000
or if you want to be the president's buddy,

287
0:13:01.394,000 --> 0:13:02,000
how are you going to criticize them?

288
0:13:03.259,000 --> 0:13:06,000
When I'm assigned to interview a powerful or influential person,

289
0:13:06.572,000 --> 0:13:07,000
I always keep two things in mind:

290
0:13:08.345,000 --> 0:13:1,000
if I don't ask this difficult and uncomfortable question,

291
0:13:11.113,000 --> 0:13:12,000
no one else is going to;

292
0:13:13.718,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and that I'm never going to see this person again.

293
0:13:16.685,000 --> 0:13:19,000
So I'm not looking to make a good impression

294
0:13:20.772,000 --> 0:13:21,000
or to forge a connection.

295
0:13:22.1,000 --> 0:13:25,000
In the end, if I have to choose between being the president's friend

296
0:13:25.367,000 --> 0:13:26,000
or enemy,

297
0:13:26.549,000 --> 0:13:28,000
I always prefer to be their enemy.

298
0:13:31.001,000 --> 0:13:32,000
In closing:

299
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
I know this is a difficult time to be an immigrant and a journalist,

300
0:13:38.078,000 --> 0:13:39,000
but now more than ever,

301
0:13:39.98,000 --> 0:13:42,000
we need journalists who are prepared,

302
0:13:43.165,000 --> 0:13:44,000
at any given moment,

303
0:13:44.76,000 --> 0:13:45,000
to set neutrality aside.

304
0:13:47.177,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Personally, I feel like I've been preparing for this moment

305
0:13:50.039,000 --> 0:13:51,000
my whole life.

306
0:13:51.217,000 --> 0:13:53,000
When they censored me when I was 24,

307
0:13:53.527,000 --> 0:13:59,000
I learned that neutrality, fear and silence often make you an accomplice

308
0:14:00.221,000 --> 0:14:01,000
in crime, abuse

309
0:14:02.667,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and injustice.

310
0:14:04.238,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And being an accomplice to power

311
0:14:06.287,000 --> 0:14:08,000
is never good journalism.

312
0:14:09.394,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Now, at 59 years old,

313
0:14:12.088,000 --> 0:14:13,000
I only hope to have a tiny bit

314
0:14:14.91,000 --> 0:14:18,000
of the courage and mental clarity I had at 24,

315
0:14:18.941,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and that way, never again

316
0:14:21.285,000 --> 0:14:22,000
remain quiet.

317
0:14:22.682,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Thank you very much.

318
0:14:23.974,000 --> 0:14:25,000
(Applause)

319
0:14:26.637,000 --> 0:14:27,000

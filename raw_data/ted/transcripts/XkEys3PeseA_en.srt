0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:28,000
You've all seen lots of articles on climate change,

2
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and here's yet another New York Times article,

3
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:32,000
just like every other darn one you've seen.

4
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:34,000
It says all the same stuff as all the other ones you've seen.

5
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:37,000
It even has the same amount of headline as all the other ones you've seen.

6
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:41,000
What's unusual about this one, maybe, is that it's from 1953.

7
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And the reason I'm saying this

8
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:45,000
is that you may have the idea this problem is relatively recent.

9
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:48,000
That people have just sort of figured out about it, and now

10
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:51,000
with Kyoto and the Governator and people beginning to actually do something,

11
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:54,000
we may be on the road to a solution.

12
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:57,000
The fact is -- uh-uh.

13
0:00:57,000 --> 0:01:02,000
We've known about this problem for 50 years, depending on how you count it.

14
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:04,000
We have talked about it endlessly over the last decade or so.

15
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And we've accomplished close to zip.

16
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:1,000
This is the growth rate of CO2 in the atmosphere.

17
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:12,000
You've seen this in various forms,

18
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:14,000
but maybe you haven't seen this one.

19
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:17,000
What this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating.

20
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And that it's accelerating even faster

21
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:23,000
than what we thought was the worst case just a few years back.

22
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So that red line there was something that a lot of skeptics said

23
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
the environmentalists only put in the projections

24
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:31,000
to make the projections look as bad as possible,

25
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that emissions would never grow as fast as that red line.

26
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:36,000
But in fact, they're growing faster.

27
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Here's some data from actually just 10 days ago,

28
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:44,000
which shows this year's minimum of the Arctic Sea ice, and it's the lowest by far.

29
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And the rate at which the Arctic Sea ice is going away is a lot quicker than models.

30
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So despite all sorts of experts like me flying around the planet and

31
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:55,000
burning jet fuel, and politicians signing treaties --

32
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:58,000
in fact, you could argue the net effect of all this has been negative,

33
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:01,000
because it's just consumed a lot of jet fuel. (Laughter)

34
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:06,000
No, no! In terms of what we really need to do to put the brakes on

35
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:1,000
this very high inertial thing -- our big economy -- we've really hardly started.

36
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Really, we're doing this, basically. Really, not very much.

37
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I don't want to depress you too much.

38
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:24,000
The problem is absolutely soluble, and even soluble in a way that's reasonably cheap.

39
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Cheap meaning sort of the cost of the military, not the cost of medical care.

40
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Cheap meaning a few percent of GDP.

41
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
No, this is really important to have this sense of scale.

42
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So the problem is soluble, and the way we should go about solving it is, say,

43
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:41,000
dealing with electricity production,

44
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:45,000
which causes something like 43-or-so percent and rising of CO2 emissions.

45
0:02:45,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And we could do that by perfectly sensible things like conservation,

46
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and wind power, nuclear power and coal to CO2 capture,

47
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:57,000
which are all things that are ready for giant scale deployment, and work.

48
0:02:57,000 --> 0:03:02,000
All we lack is the action to actually spend the money to put those into place.

49
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Instead, we spend our time talking.

50
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:07,000
But nevertheless, that's not what I'm going to talk to you about tonight.

51
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:11,000
What I'm going to talk to you about tonight is stuff we might do if we did nothing.

52
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And it's this stuff in the middle here, which is what you do

53
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:18,000
if you don't stop the emissions quickly enough.

54
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And you need to deal -- somehow break the link between human actions

55
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that change climate, and the climate change itself. And that's particularly important

56
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:28,000
because, of course, while we can adapt to climate change --

57
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and it's important to be honest here, there will be some benefits to climate change.

58
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Oh, yes, I think it's bad. I've spent my whole life working to stop it.

59
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:38,000
But one of the reasons it's politically hard is there are winners and losers -- not all losers.

60
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:41,000
But, of course, the natural world, polar bears.

61
0:03:41,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I spent time skiing across the sea ice for weeks at a time in the high Arctic.

62
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:46,000
They will completely lose.

63
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And there's no adaption.

64
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So this problem is absolutely soluble.

65
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:52,000
This geo-engineering idea, in it's simplest form, is basically the following.

66
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:57,000
You could put signed particles, say sulfuric acid particles -- sulfates --

67
0:03:57,000 --> 0:03:59,000
into the upper atmosphere, the stratosphere,

68
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:01,000
where they'd reflect away sunlight and cool the planet.

69
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And I know for certain that that will work.

70
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Not that there aren't side effects, but I know for certain it will work.

71
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And the reason is, it's been done.

72
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And it was done not by us, not by me, but by nature.

73
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Here's Mount Pinatubo in the early '90s. That put a whole bunch of sulfur

74
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:19,000
in the stratosphere with a sort of atomic bomb-like cloud.

75
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:22,000
The result of that was pretty dramatic.

76
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:25,000
After that, and some previous volcanoes we have, you see

77
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:27,000
a quite dramatic cooling of the atmosphere.

78
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So this lower bar is the upper atmosphere, the stratosphere,

79
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and it heats up after these volcanoes.

80
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:34,000
But you'll notice that in the upper bar, which is the lower atmosphere

81
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and the surface, it cools down because we shielded the atmosphere a little bit.

82
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:4,000
There's no big mystery about it.

83
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:43,000
There's lots of mystery in the details, and there's some bad side effects,

84
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:46,000
like it partially destroys the ozone layer -- and I'll get to that in a minute.

85
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:48,000
But it clearly cools down.

86
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And one other thing: it's fast.

87
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:54,000
It's really important to say. So much of the other things that we ought to do,

88
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:59,000
like slowing emissions, are intrinsically slow, because it takes time

89
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:02,000
to build all the hardware we need to reduce emissions.

90
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And not only that, when you cut emissions, you don't cut concentrations,

91
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:07,000
because concentrations, the amount of CO2 in the air,

92
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:09,000
is the sum of emissions over time.

93
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So you can't step on the brakes very quickly.

94
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:13,000
But if you do this, it's quick.

95
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And there are times you might like to do something quick.

96
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Another thing you might wonder about is, does it work?

97
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Can you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the added CO2,

98
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and produce a climate sort of back to what it was originally?

99
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And the answer seems to be yes.

100
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So here are the graphs you've seen lots of times before.

101
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:34,000
That's what the world looks like, under one particular climate model's view,

102
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:36,000
with twice the amount of CO2 in the air.

103
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:4,000
The lower graph is with twice the amount of CO2 and 1.8 percent less sunlight,

104
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and you're back to the original climate.

105
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And this graph from Ken Caldeira. It's important to say came, because

106
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Ken -- at a meeting that I believe Marty Hoffart was also at in the mid-'90s --

107
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Ken and I stood up at the back of the meeting and said,

108
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:53,000
"Geo-engineering won't work."

109
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And to the person who was promoting it said,

110
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:57,000
"The atmosphere's much more complicated."

111
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:,000
Gave a bunch of physical reasons why it wouldn't do a very good compensation.

112
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Ken went and ran his models, and found that it did.

113
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:05,000
This topic is also old.

114
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:08,000
That report that landed on President Johnson's desk when I was two years old --

115
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:1,000
1965.

116
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:12,000
That report, in fact, which had all the modern climate science --

117
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:15,000
the only thing they talked about doing was geo-engineering.

118
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:17,000
It didn't even talk about cutting emissions,

119
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:2,000
which is an incredible shift in our thinking about this problem.

120
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I'm not saying we shouldn't cut emissions.

121
0:06:22,000 --> 0:06:25,000
We should, but it made exactly this point.

122
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So, in a sense, there's not much new.

123
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:29,000
The one new thing is this essay.

124
0:06:29,000 --> 0:06:33,000
So I should say, I guess, that since the time of that original President Johnson report,

125
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and the various reports of the U.S. National Academy --

126
0:06:36,000 --> 0:06:39,000
1977, 1982, 1990 -- people always talked about this idea.

127
0:06:39,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Not as something that was foolproof, but as an idea to think about.

128
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:46,000
But when climate became, politically, a hot topic -- if I may make the pun --

129
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:52,000
in the last 15 years, this became so un-PC, we couldn't talk about it.

130
0:06:52,000 --> 0:06:56,000
It just sunk below the surface. We weren't allowed to speak about it.

131
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:59,000
But in the last year, Paul Crutzen published this essay

132
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:02,000
saying roughly what's all been said before: that maybe, given our very slow rate

133
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:05,000
of progress in solving this problem and the uncertain impacts,

134
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:07,000
we should think about things like this.

135
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:09,000
He said roughly what's been said before.

136
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:12,000
The big deal was he happened to have won the Nobel prize for ozone chemistry.

137
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And so people took him seriously when he said we should think about this,

138
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:16,000
even though there will be some ozone impacts.

139
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And in fact, he had some ideas to make them go away.

140
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:2,000
There was all sorts of press coverage, all over the world,

141
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:24,000
going right down to "Dr. Strangelove Saves the Earth," from the Economist.

142
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And that got me thinking. I've worked on this topic on and off,

143
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:3,000
but not so much technically. And I was actually lying in bed thinking one night.

144
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And I thought about this child's toy -- hence, the title of my talk --

145
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and I wondered if you could use the same physics that makes that thing spin 'round

146
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:41,000
in the child's radiometer, to levitate particles into the upper atmosphere

147
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and make them stay there.

148
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:45,000
One of the problems with sulfates is they fall out quickly.

149
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:47,000
The other problem is they're right in the ozone layer,

150
0:07:47,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and I'd prefer them above the ozone layer.

151
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And it turns out, I woke up the next morning, and I started to calculate this.

152
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:54,000
It was very hard to calculate from first principles. I was stumped.

153
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:57,000
But then I found out that there were all sorts of papers already published

154
0:07:57,000 --> 0:08:,000
that addressed this topic because it happens already in the natural atmosphere.

155
0:08:,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So it seems there are already fine particles

156
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:06,000
that are levitated up to what we call the mesosphere, about 100 kilometers up,

157
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:08,000
that already have this effect.

158
0:08:08,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I'll tell you very quickly how the effect works.

159
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:12,000
There are a lot of fun complexities

160
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:14,000
that I'd love to spend the whole evening on, but I won't.

161
0:08:14,000 --> 0:08:17,000
But let's say you have sunlight hitting some particle and it's unevenly heated.

162
0:08:17,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So the side facing the sun is warmer; the side away, cooler.

163
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Gas molecules that bounce off the warm side

164
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:26,000
bounce away with some extra velocity because it's warm.

165
0:08:26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And so you see a net force away from the sun.

166
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:3,000
That's called the photophoretic force.

167
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:34,000
There are a bunch of other versions of it that I and some collaborators

168
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:36,000
have thought about how to exploit.

169
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And of course, we may be wrong --

170
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:4,000
this hasn't all been peer reviewed, we're in the middle of thinking about it --

171
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:42,000
but so far, it seems good.

172
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:45,000
But it looks like we could achieve long atmospheric lifetimes --

173
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:48,000
much longer than before -- because they're levitated.

174
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:5,000
We can move things out of the stratosphere into the mesosphere,

175
0:08:5,000 --> 0:08:53,000
in principle solving the ozone problem.

176
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I'm sure there will be other problems that arise.

177
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Finally, we could make the particles migrate to over the poles,

178
0:08:58,000 --> 0:09:02,000
so we could arrange the climate engineering so it really focused on the poles.

179
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Which would have minimal bad impacts in the middle of the planet,

180
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:09,000
where we live, and do the maximum job of what we might need to do,

181
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:13,000
which is cooling the poles in case of planetary emergency, if you like.

182
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:15,000
This is a new idea that's crept up that may be, essentially,

183
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:17,000
a cleverer idea than putting sulfates in.

184
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Whether this idea is right or some other idea is right,

185
0:09:21,000 --> 0:09:23,000
I think it's almost certain we will

186
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:26,000
eventually think of cleverer things to do than just putting sulfur in.

187
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
That if engineers and scientists really turned their minds to this,

188
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:32,000
it's amazing how we can affect the planet.

189
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:36,000
The one thing about this is it gives us extraordinary leverage.

190
0:09:36,000 --> 0:09:39,000
This improved science and engineering will, whether we like it or not,

191
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:42,000
give us more and more leverage to affect the planet,

192
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:44,000
to control the planet,

193
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:48,000
to give us weather and climate control -- not because we plan it,

194
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:51,000
not because we want it, just because science delivers it to us bit by bit,

195
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:53,000
with better knowledge of the way the system works

196
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and better engineering tools to effect it.

197
0:09:57,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Now, suppose that space aliens arrived.

198
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Maybe they're going to land at the U.N. headquarters down the road here,

199
0:10:03,000 --> 0:10:05,000
or maybe they'll pick a smarter spot --

200
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:08,000
but suppose they arrive and they give you a box.

201
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And the box has two knobs.

202
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:14,000
One knob is the knob for controlling global temperature.

203
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Maybe another knob is a knob for controlling CO2 concentrations.

204
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
You might imagine that we would fight wars over that box.

205
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Because we have no way to agree about where to set the knobs.

206
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:25,000
We have no global governance.

207
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And different people will have different places they want it set.

208
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Now, I don't think that's going to happen. It's not very likely.

209
0:10:31,000 --> 0:10:35,000
But we're building that box.

210
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:37,000
The scientists and engineers of the world

211
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:39,000
are building it piece by piece, in their labs.

212
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Even when they're doing it for other reasons.

213
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Even when they're thinking they're just working on protecting the environment.

214
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:46,000
They have no interest in crazy ideas like engineering the whole planet.

215
0:10:46,000 --> 0:10:5,000
They develop science that makes it easier and easier to do.

216
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And so I guess my view on this is not that I want to do it -- I do not --

217
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:58,000
but that we should move this out of the shadows and talk about it seriously.

218
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Because sooner or later, we'll be confronted with decisions about this,

219
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and it's better if we think hard about it,

220
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:08,000
even if we want to think hard about reasons why we should never do it.

221
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I'll give you two different ways to think about this problem that are the beginning

222
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:16,000
of my thinking about how to think about it.

223
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
But what we need is not just a few oddballs like me thinking about this.

224
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:21,000
We need a broader debate.

225
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:25,000
A debate that involves musicians, scientists, philosophers, writers,

226
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:28,000
who get engaged with this question about climate engineering

227
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and think seriously about what its implications are.

228
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:33,000
So here's one way to think about it,

229
0:11:33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
which is that we just do this instead of cutting emissions because it's cheaper.

230
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:4,000
I guess the thing I haven't said about this is, it is absurdly cheap.

231
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:44,000
It's conceivable that, say, using the sulfates method or this method I've come up with,

232
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:5,000
you could create an ice age at a cost of .001 percent of GDP.

233
0:11:5,000 --> 0:11:53,000
It's very cheap. We have a lot of leverage.

234
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:55,000
It's not a good idea, but it's just important. (Laughter)

235
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:58,000
I'll tell you how big the lever is: the lever is that big.

236
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And that calculation isn't much in dispute.

237
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:08,000
You might argue about the sanity of it, but the leverage is real. (Laughter)

238
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:12,000
So because of this, we could deal with the problem

239
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:17,000
simply by stopping reducing emissions,

240
0:12:17,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and just as the concentrations go up, we can increase

241
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:21,000
the amount of geo-engineering.

242
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:24,000
I don't think anybody takes that seriously.

243
0:12:24,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Because under this scenario, we walk further and further away

244
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
from the current climate.

245
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:3,000
We have all sorts of other problems, like ocean acidification

246
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:33,000
that come from CO2 in the atmosphere, anyway.

247
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Nobody but maybe one or two very odd folks really suggest this.

248
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:38,000
But here's a case which is harder to reject.

249
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Let's say that we don't do geo-engineering, we do what we ought to do,

250
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:44,000
which is get serious about cutting emissions.

251
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:47,000
But we don't really know how quickly we have to cut them.

252
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:5,000
There's a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much climate change is too much.

253
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:53,000
So let's say that we work hard, and we actually don't just tap the brakes,

254
0:12:53,000 --> 0:12:56,000
but we step hard on the brakes and really reduce emissions

255
0:12:56,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and eventually reduce concentrations.

256
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And maybe someday -- like 2075, October 23 --

257
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:06,000
we finally reach that glorious day where concentrations have peaked

258
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and are rolling down the other side.

259
0:13:08,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And we have global celebrations, and we've actually started to -- you know,

260
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:14,000
we've seen the worst of it.

261
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:18,000
But maybe on that day we also find that the Greenland ice sheet

262
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:24,000
is really melting unacceptably fast, fast enough to put meters of sea level on

263
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:26,000
the oceans in the next 100 years,

264
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and remove some of the biggest cities from the map.

265
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:3,000
That's an absolutely possible scenario.

266
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:33,000
We might decide at that point that even though geo-engineering was uncertain

267
0:13:33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and morally unhappy, that it's a lot better than not geo-engineering.

268
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And that's a very different way to look at the problem.

269
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:43,000
It's using this as risk control, not instead of action.

270
0:13:43,000 --> 0:13:46,000
It's saying that you do some geo-engineering for a little while

271
0:13:46,000 --> 0:13:51,000
to take the worst of the heat off, not that you'd use it as a substitute for action.

272
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:53,000
But there is a problem with that view.

273
0:13:53,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And the problem is the following:

274
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:57,000
knowledge that geo-engineering is possible makes

275
0:13:57,000 --> 0:14:,000
the climate impacts look less fearsome,

276
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and that makes a weaker commitment to cutting emissions today.

277
0:14:03,000 --> 0:14:05,000
This is what economists call a moral hazard.

278
0:14:05,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And that's one of the fundamental reasons that this problem is so hard to talk about,

279
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and, in general, I think it's the underlying reason

280
0:14:11,000 --> 0:14:12,000
that it's been politically unacceptable to talk about this.

281
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:16,000
But you don't make good policy by hiding things in a drawer.

282
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
I'll leave you with three questions, and then one final quote.

283
0:14:19,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Should we do serious research on this topic?

284
0:14:22,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Should we have a national research program that looks at this?

285
0:14:25,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Not just at how you would do it better,

286
0:14:27,000 --> 0:14:29,000
but also what all the risks and downsides of it are.

287
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Right now, you have a few enthusiasts talking about it, some in a positive side,

288
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
some in a negative side -- but that's a dangerous state to be in

289
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:39,000
because there's very little depth of knowledge on this topic.

290
0:14:39,000 --> 0:14:41,000
A very small amount of money would get us some.

291
0:14:41,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Many of us -- maybe now me -- think we should do that.

292
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:46,000
But I have a lot of reservations.

293
0:14:46,000 --> 0:14:49,000
My reservations are principally about the moral hazard problem,

294
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and I don't really know how we can best avoid the moral hazard.

295
0:14:53,000 --> 0:14:55,000
I think there is a serious problem: as you talk about this,

296
0:14:55,000 --> 0:14:59,000
people begin to think they don't need to work so hard to cut emissions.

297
0:14:59,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Another thing is, maybe we need a treaty.

298
0:15:02,000 --> 0:15:05,000
A treaty that decides who gets to do this.

299
0:15:05,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Right now we may think of a big, rich country like the U.S. doing this.

300
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:11,000
But it might well be that, in fact, if China wakes up in 2030 and realizes

301
0:15:11,000 --> 0:15:13,000
that the climate impacts are just unacceptable,

302
0:15:13,000 --> 0:15:17,000
they may not be very interested in our moral conversations about how to do this,

303
0:15:17,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and they may just decide they'd really rather have a geo-engineered world

304
0:15:21,000 --> 0:15:24,000
than a non-geo-engineered world.

305
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:28,000
And we'll have no international mechanism to figure out who makes the decision.

306
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:3,000
So here's one last thought, which was said much, much better

307
0:15:3,000 --> 0:15:34,000
25 years ago in the U.S. National Academy report than I can say today.

308
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:37,000
And I think it really summarizes where we are here.

309
0:15:37,000 --> 0:15:4,000
That the CO2 problem, the climate problem that we've heard about,

310
0:15:4,000 --> 0:15:42,000
is driving lots of things -- innovations in the energy technologies

311
0:15:42,000 --> 0:15:44,000
that will reduce emissions --

312
0:15:44,000 --> 0:15:49,000
but also, I think, inevitably, it will drive us towards thinking about climate

313
0:15:49,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and weather control, whether we like it or not.

314
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:54,000
And it's time to begin thinking about it,

315
0:15:54,000 --> 0:15:57,000
even if the reason we're thinking about it is to construct arguments

316

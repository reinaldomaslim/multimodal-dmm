1
0:00:12.621,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I am from the South Side of Chicago,

2
0:00:15.46,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and in seventh grade, I had a best friend named Jenny

3
0:00:19.58,000 --> 0:00:21,000
who lived on the Southwest Side of Chicago.

4
0:00:23.18,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Jenny was white,

5
0:00:25.18,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and if you know anything about the segregated demographics of Chicago,

6
0:00:29.18,000 --> 0:00:32,000
you know that there are not too many black people

7
0:00:32.34,000 --> 0:00:34,000
who live on the Southwest Side of Chicago.

8
0:00:34.42,000 --> 0:00:35,000
But Jenny was my girl

9
0:00:35.7,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and so we would hang out every so often after school and on the weekends.

10
0:00:40.62,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And so one day we were hanging out in her living room,

11
0:00:43.939,000 --> 0:00:46,000
talking about 13-year-old things,

12
0:00:47.22,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and Jenny's little sister Rosie was in the room with us,

13
0:00:50.46,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and she was sitting behind me just kind of playing in my hair,

14
0:00:53.54,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and I wasn't thinking too much about what she was doing.

15
0:00:58.22,000 --> 0:01:,000
But at a pause in the conversation,

16
0:01:00.46,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Rosie tapped me on the shoulder.

17
0:01:02.98,000 --> 0:01:04,000
She said, "Can I ask you a question?"

18
0:01:05.94,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I said, "Yeah, Rosie. Sure."

19
0:01:08.62,000 --> 0:01:09,000
"Are you black?"

20
0:01:10.06,000 --> 0:01:12,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:12.3,000 --> 0:01:13,000
The room froze.

22
0:01:14.22,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Silence.

23
0:01:16.699,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Jenny and Rosie's mom was not too far away.

24
0:01:18.98,000 --> 0:01:2,000
She was in the kitchen and she overheard the conversation,

25
0:01:21.9,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and she was mortified.

26
0:01:24.14,000 --> 0:01:27,000
She said, "Rosie! You can't ask people questions like that."

27
0:01:28.46,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And Jenny was my friend, and I know she was really embarrassed.

28
0:01:32.06,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I felt kind of bad for her, but actually I was not offended.

29
0:01:36.42,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I figured it wasn't Rosie's fault that in her 10 short years on this earth,

30
0:01:41.5,000 --> 0:01:43,000
living on the Southwest Side of Chicago,

31
0:01:43.98,000 --> 0:01:45,000
she wasn't 100 percent sure what a black person looked like.

32
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
That's fair.

33
0:01:48.7,000 --> 0:01:5,000
But what was more surprising to me was,

34
0:01:51.1,000 --> 0:01:55,000
in all of this time I had spent with Jenny and Rosie's family --

35
0:01:55.62,000 --> 0:01:56,000
hanging out with them,

36
0:01:56.98,000 --> 0:01:57,000
playing with them,

37
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
even physically interacting with them --

38
0:02:01.06,000 --> 0:02:05,000
it was not until Rosie put her hands in my hair

39
0:02:05.58,000 --> 0:02:07,000
that she thought to ask me if I was black.

40
0:02:09.38,000 --> 0:02:11,000
That was the first time I would realize

41
0:02:12.1,000 --> 0:02:16,000
how big of a role the texture of my hair played in confirming my ethnicity,

42
0:02:17.06,000 --> 0:02:21,000
but also that it would play a key role in how I'm viewed by others in society.

43
0:02:23.22,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Garrett A. Morgan and Madame CJ Walker were pioneers

44
0:02:26.46,000 --> 0:02:29,000
of the black hair-care and beauty industry in the early 1900s.

45
0:02:30.5,000 --> 0:02:33,000
They're best known as the inventors of chemically-based hair creams

46
0:02:34.3,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and heat straightening tools

47
0:02:35.86,000 --> 0:02:38,000
designed to permanently, or semipermanently,

48
0:02:39.46,000 --> 0:02:41,000
alter the texture of black hair.

49
0:02:43.18,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Oftentimes when we think about the history of blacks in America,

50
0:02:46.98,000 --> 0:02:48,000
we think about the heinous acts

51
0:02:49.9,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and numerous injustices that we experienced as people of color

52
0:02:54.42,000 --> 0:02:55,000
because of the color of our skin,

53
0:02:56.18,000 --> 0:02:59,000
when in fact, in post-Civil War America,

54
0:02:59.86,000 --> 0:03:04,000
it was the hair of an African-American male or female

55
0:03:05.06,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that was known as the most "telling feature" of Negro status,

56
0:03:09.94,000 --> 0:03:1,000
more so than the color of the skin.

57
0:03:12.94,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And so before they were staples

58
0:03:15.3,000 --> 0:03:18,000
of the multibillion-dollar hair-care industry,

59
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
our dependency on tools and products,

60
0:03:22.06,000 --> 0:03:25,000
like the hair relaxer and the pressing comb,

61
0:03:25.38,000 --> 0:03:29,000
were more about our survival and advancement as a race

62
0:03:29.82,000 --> 0:03:31,000
in postslavery America.

63
0:03:33.7,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Over the years, we grew accustomed to this idea

64
0:03:37.1,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that straighter and longer hair meant better and more beautiful.

65
0:03:43.62,000 --> 0:03:46,000
We became culturally obsessed

66
0:03:46.78,000 --> 0:03:49,000
with this idea of having what we like to call ...

67
0:03:50.66,000 --> 0:03:51,000
"good hair."

68
0:03:53.5,000 --> 0:03:54,000
This essentially means:

69
0:03:55.1,000 --> 0:03:58,000
the looser the curl pattern, the better the hair.

70
0:03:59.54,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And we let these institutionalized ideas form a false sense of hierarchy

71
0:04:06.02,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that would determine what was considered a good grade of hair

72
0:04:11.62,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and what was not.

73
0:04:15.14,000 --> 0:04:18,000
What's worse is that we let these false ideologies

74
0:04:18.46,000 --> 0:04:2,000
invade our perception of ourselves,

75
0:04:21.22,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and they still continue to infect our cultural identity

76
0:04:24.58,000 --> 0:04:26,000
as African-American women today.

77
0:04:28.54,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So what did we do?

78
0:04:30.06,000 --> 0:04:34,000
We went to the hair salon every six to eight weeks,

79
0:04:34.1,000 --> 0:04:35,000
without fail,

80
0:04:35.5,000 --> 0:04:38,000
to subject our scalps to harsh straightening chemicals

81
0:04:38.86,000 --> 0:04:39,000
beginning at a very young age --

82
0:04:40.82,000 --> 0:04:42,000
sometimes eight, 10 --

83
0:04:42.9,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that would result in hair loss,

84
0:04:46.14,000 --> 0:04:47,000
bald spots,

85
0:04:47.38,000 --> 0:04:49,000
sometimes even burns on the scalp.

86
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
We fry our hair at temperatures of 450 degrees Fahrenheit or higher

87
0:04:55.06,000 --> 0:04:56,000
almost daily,

88
0:04:56.34,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to maintain the straight look.

89
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Or we simply cover our hair up with wigs and weaves,

90
0:05:04.18,000 --> 0:05:06,000
only to let our roots breathe in private

91
0:05:06.86,000 --> 0:05:09,000
where no one knows what's really going on under there.

92
0:05:11.34,000 --> 0:05:14,000
We adopted these practices in our own communities,

93
0:05:14.66,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and so it's no wonder why today the typical ideal vision

94
0:05:20.02,000 --> 0:05:22,000
of a professional black woman,

95
0:05:22.78,000 --> 0:05:23,000
especially in corporate America,

96
0:05:24.7,000 --> 0:05:26,000
tends to look like this,

97
0:05:28.14,000 --> 0:05:29,000
rather than like this.

98
0:05:30.98,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And she certainly doesn't look like this.

99
0:05:35.14,000 --> 0:05:36,000
In September of this year,

100
0:05:37.14,000 --> 0:05:39,000
a federal court ruled it lawful

101
0:05:39.66,000 --> 0:05:43,000
for a company to discriminate against hiring an employee

102
0:05:44.02,000 --> 0:05:47,000
based on if she or he wears dreadlocks.

103
0:05:48.38,000 --> 0:05:49,000
In the case,

104
0:05:49.62,000 --> 0:05:51,000
the hiring manager in Mobile, Alabama

105
0:05:51.9,000 --> 0:05:52,000
is on record as saying,

106
0:05:54.78,000 --> 0:05:55,000
"I'm not saying yours are messy,

107
0:05:57.46,000 --> 0:05:58,000
but ...

108
0:05:58.82,000 --> 0:05:59,000
you know what I'm talking about."

109
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Well, what was she talking about?

110
0:06:05.58,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Did she think that they were ugly?

111
0:06:08.74,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Or maybe they were just a little too Afrocentric

112
0:06:13.22,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and pro-black-looking for her taste.

113
0:06:16.3,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Or maybe it's not about Afrocentricity,

114
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and it's more just about it being a little too "urban"

115
0:06:20.82,000 --> 0:06:21,000
for the professional setting.

116
0:06:23.7,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Perhaps she had a genuine concern in that they looked "scary"

117
0:06:27.38,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and that they would intimidate the clients and their customer base.

118
0:06:32.5,000 --> 0:06:37,000
All of these words are ones that are too often associated

119
0:06:37.62,000 --> 0:06:4,000
with the stigma attached to natural hairstyles.

120
0:06:41.82,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And this ...

121
0:06:43.54,000 --> 0:06:44,000
this has got to change.

122
0:06:47.1,000 --> 0:06:48,000
In 2013,

123
0:06:48.38,000 --> 0:06:52,000
a white paper published by the Deloitte Leadership Center for Inclusion,

124
0:06:52.9,000 --> 0:06:55,000
studied 3,000 individuals in executive leadership roles

125
0:06:56.34,000 --> 0:06:58,000
on the concept of covering in the workplace

126
0:06:58.98,000 --> 0:07:02,000
based on appearance, advocacy, affiliation and association.

127
0:07:04.14,000 --> 0:07:07,000
When thinking about appearance-based covering,

128
0:07:07.22,000 --> 0:07:08,000
the study showed

129
0:07:08.5,000 --> 0:07:14,000
that 67 percent of women of color cover in the workplace

130
0:07:14.58,000 --> 0:07:15,000
based on their appearance.

131
0:07:17.18,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Of the total respondents who admitted to appearance-based covering,

132
0:07:21.66,000 --> 0:07:25,000
82 percent said that it was somewhat to extremely important

133
0:07:25.94,000 --> 0:07:28,000
for them to do so for their professional advancement.

134
0:07:29.62,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Now, this is Ursula Burns.

135
0:07:32.94,000 --> 0:07:37,000
She is the first African-American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company --

136
0:07:38.5,000 --> 0:07:39,000
of Xerox.

137
0:07:40.18,000 --> 0:07:42,000
She's known by her signature look,

138
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
the one that you see here.

139
0:07:43.98,000 --> 0:07:47,000
A short, nicely trimmed, well-manicured Afro.

140
0:07:49.18,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Ms. Burns is what we like to call a "natural girl."

141
0:07:53.22,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And she is paving the way and showing what's possible

142
0:07:56.46,000 --> 0:07:59,000
for African-American women seeking to climb the corporate ladder,

143
0:08:00.22,000 --> 0:08:02,000
but still wishing to wear natural hairstyles.

144
0:08:03.74,000 --> 0:08:07,000
But today the majority of African-American women

145
0:08:07.82,000 --> 0:08:11,000
who we still look to as leaders, icons and role models,

146
0:08:12.54,000 --> 0:08:15,000
still opt for a straight-hair look.

147
0:08:15.86,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Now,

148
0:08:17.1,000 --> 0:08:18,000
maybe it's because they want to --

149
0:08:18.82,000 --> 0:08:21,000
this is authentically how they feel best --

150
0:08:22.14,000 --> 0:08:23,000
but maybe --

151
0:08:23.66,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and I bet --

152
0:08:25.3,000 --> 0:08:28,000
a part of them felt like they had to

153
0:08:28.58,000 --> 0:08:32,000
in order to reach the level of success that they have attained today.

154
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
There is a natural hair movement that is sweeping the country

155
0:08:39.38,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and also in some places in Europe.

156
0:08:42.58,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Millions of women are exploring what it means to transition to natural hair,

157
0:08:47.7,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and they're cutting off years and years of dry, damaged ends

158
0:08:51.739,000 --> 0:08:53,000
in order to restore their natural curl pattern.

159
0:08:54.739,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I know because I have been an advocate and an ambassador for this movement

160
0:08:59.1,000 --> 0:09:,000
for roughly the last three years.

161
0:09:01.62,000 --> 0:09:06,000
After 27 years of excessive heat and harsh chemicals,

162
0:09:07.22,000 --> 0:09:12,000
my hair was beginning to show extreme signs of wear and tear.

163
0:09:13.3,000 --> 0:09:14,000
It was breaking off,

164
0:09:14.86,000 --> 0:09:15,000
it was thinning,

165
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
looking just extremely dry and brittle.

166
0:09:19.34,000 --> 0:09:22,000
All those years of chasing that conventional image of beauty

167
0:09:22.74,000 --> 0:09:23,000
that we saw earlier

168
0:09:23.98,000 --> 0:09:24,000
was finally beginning to take its toll.

169
0:09:27.62,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I wanted to do something about it,

170
0:09:29.86,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and so I started what I called the "No Heat Challenge,"

171
0:09:34.38,000 --> 0:09:37,000
where I would refrain from using heat styling tools on my hair

172
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
for six months.

173
0:09:40.78,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And like a good millennial,

174
0:09:43.62,000 --> 0:09:45,000
I documented it on social media.

175
0:09:45.86,000 --> 0:09:46,000
(Laughter)

176
0:09:47.14,000 --> 0:09:51,000
I documented as I reluctantly cut off

177
0:09:51.22,000 --> 0:09:54,000
three to four inches of my beloved hair.

178
0:09:55.86,000 --> 0:10:,000
I documented as I struggled to master these natural hairstyles,

179
0:10:01.42,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and also as I struggled to embrace them

180
0:10:05.46,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and think that they actually looked good.

181
0:10:09.58,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And I documented as my hair texture slowly began to change.

182
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
By sharing this journey openly,

183
0:10:18.74,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I learned that I was not the only woman going through this

184
0:10:22.54,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and that in fact there were thousands and thousands of other women

185
0:10:26.34,000 --> 0:10:27,000
who were longing to do the same.

186
0:10:28.78,000 --> 0:10:3,000
So they would reach out to me and they would say,

187
0:10:31.14,000 --> 0:10:33,000
"Cheyenne, how did you do that natural hairstyle

188
0:10:33.42,000 --> 0:10:34,000
that I saw you with the other day?

189
0:10:35.38,000 --> 0:10:37,000
What new products have you started using

190
0:10:37.42,000 --> 0:10:39,000
that might be a little better for my hair texture

191
0:10:39.78,000 --> 0:10:4,000
as it begins to change?"

192
0:10:41.78,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Or, "What are some of the natural hair routines

193
0:10:45.62,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that I should begin to adopt to slowly restore the health of my hair?"

194
0:10:50.98,000 --> 0:10:53,000
But I also found that there were a large number of women

195
0:10:54.7,000 --> 0:10:57,000
who were extremely hesitant to take that first step

196
0:10:59.54,000 --> 0:11:01,000
because they were paralyzed by fear.

197
0:11:03.22,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Fear of the unknown --

198
0:11:04.98,000 --> 0:11:05,000
what would they now look like?

199
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
How would they feel about themselves with these natural hairstyles?

200
0:11:11.62,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And most importantly to them,

201
0:11:14.06,000 --> 0:11:16,000
how would others view them?

202
0:11:17.22,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Over the last three years

203
0:11:19.06,000 --> 0:11:22,000
of having numerous conversations with friends of mine

204
0:11:22.98,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and also complete strangers from around the world,

205
0:11:26.94,000 --> 0:11:28,000
I learned some really important things

206
0:11:29.66,000 --> 0:11:32,000
about how African-American women identify with their hair.

207
0:11:34.62,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And so when I think back

208
0:11:36.62,000 --> 0:11:39,000
to that hiring manager in Mobile, Alabama,

209
0:11:40.18,000 --> 0:11:42,000
I'd say, "Actually, no.

210
0:11:42.94,000 --> 0:11:44,000
We don't know what you're talking about."

211
0:11:45.42,000 --> 0:11:46,000
But here are some things that we do know.

212
0:11:48.54,000 --> 0:11:52,000
We know that when black women embrace their love for their natural hair,

213
0:11:53.54,000 --> 0:11:56,000
it helps to undo generations of teaching

214
0:11:57.02,000 --> 0:12:,000
that black in its natural state is not beautiful,

215
0:12:00.34,000 --> 0:12:02,000
or something to be hidden or covered up.

216
0:12:04.3,000 --> 0:12:08,000
We know that black women express their individuality

217
0:12:08.58,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and experience feelings of empowerment

218
0:12:11.7,000 --> 0:12:15,000
by experimenting with different hairstyles regularly.

219
0:12:16.7,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And we also know

220
0:12:18.34,000 --> 0:12:22,000
that when we're invited to wear our natural hair in the workplace,

221
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
it reinforces that we are uniquely valued

222
0:12:26.66,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and thus helps us to flourish and advance professionally.

223
0:12:32.34,000 --> 0:12:33,000
I leave you with this.

224
0:12:34.42,000 --> 0:12:36,000
In a time of racial and social tension,

225
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
embracing this movement

226
0:12:40.22,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and others like this

227
0:12:42.02,000 --> 0:12:45,000
help us to rise above the confines of the status quo.

228
0:12:46.54,000 --> 0:12:52,000
So when you see a woman with braids or locks draping down her back,

229
0:12:52.62,000 --> 0:12:54,000
or you notice your colleague

230
0:12:55.18,000 --> 0:12:58,000
who has stopped straightening her hair to work,

231
0:12:59.18,000 --> 0:13:02,000
do not simply approach her and admire

232
0:13:02.78,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and ask her if you can touch it --

233
0:13:05.62,000 --> 0:13:06,000
(Laughter)

234
0:13:06.9,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Really appreciate her.

235
0:13:09.74,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Applaud her.

236
0:13:10.98,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Heck, even high-five her if that's what you feel so inclined to do.

237
0:13:15.34,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Because this --

238
0:13:16.94,000 --> 0:13:18,000
this is more than about a hairstyle.

239
0:13:20.7,000 --> 0:13:22,000
It's about self-love and self-worth.

240
0:13:24.42,000 --> 0:13:26,000
It's about being brave enough

241
0:13:26.66,000 --> 0:13:3,000
not to fold under the pressure of others' expectations.

242
0:13:31.62,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And about knowing that making the decision to stray from the norm

243
0:13:36.22,000 --> 0:13:38,000
does not define who we are,

244
0:13:38.7,000 --> 0:13:4,000
but it simply reveals who we are.

245
0:13:41.86,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And finally,

246
0:13:43.62,000 --> 0:13:44,000
being brave is easier

247
0:13:45.5,000 --> 0:13:47,000
when we can count on the compassion of others.

248
0:13:48.5,000 --> 0:13:49,000
So after today,

249
0:13:50.38,000 --> 0:13:53,000
I certainly hope that we can count on you.

250
0:13:54.18,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Thank you.

251
0:13:55.42,000 --> 0:13:59,000
(Applause)

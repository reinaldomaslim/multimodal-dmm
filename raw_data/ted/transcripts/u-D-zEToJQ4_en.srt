1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
The AlloSphere: it's a three-story metal sphere

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
in an echo-free chamber.

3
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Think of the AlloSphere as a large,

4
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
dynamically varying digital microscope

5
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
that's connected to a supercomputer.

6
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
20 researchers can stand on a bridge

7
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
suspended inside of the sphere, and be

8
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
completely immersed in their data.

9
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Imagine if a team of physicists

10
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
could stand inside of an atom

11
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and watch and hear electrons spin.

12
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Imagine if a group of sculptors

13
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
could be inside of a lattice of atoms

14
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and sculpt with their material.

15
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Imagine if a team of surgeons could fly

16
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
into the brain, as though it was a world,

17
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
and see tissues as landscapes,

18
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and hear blood density levels as music.

19
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
This is some of the research that you're going to see

20
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that we're undertaking at the AlloSphere.

21
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
But first a little bit about this group

22
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
of artists, scientists, and engineers

23
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
that are working together.

24
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I'm a composer, orchestrally-trained,

25
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and the inventor of the AlloSphere.

26
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
With my visual artist colleagues, we map

27
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
complex mathematical algorithms that unfold in time and space,

28
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
visually and sonically.

29
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns

30
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
in the information.

31
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And our engineering colleagues are making

32
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
one of the largest dynamically varying computers in the world

33
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
for this kind of data exploration.

34
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I'm going to fly you into five research projects

35
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
in the AlloSphere that are going to take you from

36
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
biological macroscopic data

37
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
all the way down to electron spin.

38
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
This first project is called the AlloBrain.

39
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And it's our attempt to quantify beauty

40
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
by finding which regions of the brain

41
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
are interactive while witnessing something beautiful.

42
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
You're flying through the cortex of my colleague's brain.

43
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Our narrative here is real fMRI data

44
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that's mapped visually and sonically.

45
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
The brain now a world that we can fly through and interact with.

46
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
You see 12 intelligent computer agents,

47
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
the little rectangles that are flying in the brain with you.

48
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
They're mining blood density levels.

49
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And they're reporting them back to you sonically.

50
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Higher density levels mean

51
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
more activity in that point of the brain.

52
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
They're actually singing these densities to you

53
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
with higher pitches mapped to higher densities.

54
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
We're now going to move from real biological data

55
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
to biogenerative algorithms that create artificial nature

56
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
in our next artistic and scientific installation.

57
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
In this artistic and scientific installation, biogenerative algorithms

58
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
are helping us to understand

59
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
self-generation and growth:

60
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
very important for simulation in the nanoscaled sciences.

61
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
For artists, we're making new worlds

62
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
that we can uncover and explore.

63
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
These generative algorithms grow over time,

64
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and they interact and communicate as a swarm of insects.

65
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Our researchers are interacting with this data

66
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
by injecting bacterial code,

67
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
which are computer programs,

68
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that allow these creatures to grow over time.

69
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
We're going to move now from the biological

70
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and the macroscopic world,

71
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
down into the atomic world,

72
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
as we fly into a lattice of atoms.

73
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
This is real AFM -- Atomic Force Microscope -- data

74
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
from my colleagues in the Solid State Lighting and Energy Center.

75
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
They've discovered a new bond,

76
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
a new material for transparent solar cells.

77
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
We're flying through 2,000 lattice of atoms --

78
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
oxygen, hydrogen and zinc.

79
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
You view the bond in the triangle.

80
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
It's four blue zinc atoms

81
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
bonding with one white hydrogen atom.

82
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
You see the electron flow with the streamlines

83
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
we as artists have generated for the scientists.

84
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
This is allowing them to find the bonding nodes in any lattice of atoms.

85
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
We think it makes a beautiful structural art.

86
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
The sound that you're hearing are the actual

87
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
emission spectrums of these atoms.

88
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
We've mapped them into the audio domain,

89
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
so they're singing to you.

90
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Oxygen, hydrogen and zinc have their own signature.

91
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
We're going to actually move even further down

92
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
as we go from this lattice of atoms

93
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to one single hydrogen atom.

94
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
We're working with our physicist colleagues

95
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
that have given us the mathematical calculations

96
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
of the n-dimensional Schrödinger equation in time.

97
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
What you're seeing here right now is a superposition of an electron

98
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
in the lower three orbitals of a hydrogen atom.

99
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
You're actually hearing and seeing the electron flow with the lines.

100
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
The white dots are the probability wave

101
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that will show you where the electron is

102
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
in any given point of time and space

103
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
in this particular three-orbital configuration.

104
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
In a minute we're going to move to a two-orbital configuration,

105
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and you're going to notice a pulsing.

106
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And you're going to hear an undulation between the sound.

107
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
This is actually a light emitter.

108
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
As the sound starts to pulse and contract,

109
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
our physicists can tell when a photon is going to be emitted.

110
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
They're starting to find new mathematical structures

111
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
in these calculations.

112
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And they're understanding more about quantum mathematics.

113
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
We're going to move even further down,

114
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and go to one single electron spin.

115
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
This will be the final project that I show you.

116
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Our colleagues in the Center for Quantum Computation

117
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and Spintronics are actually measuring with their lasers

118
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
decoherence in a single electron spin.

119
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
We've taken this information and we've

120
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
made a mathematical model out of it.

121
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
You're actually seeing and hearing

122
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
quantum information flow.

123
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
This is very important for the next step in simulating

124
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
quantum computers and information technology.

125
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So these brief examples that I've shown you

126
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
give you an idea of the kind of work that we're doing

127
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
at the University of California, Santa Barbara,

128
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
to bring together, arts, science

129
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
and engineering

130
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
into a new age of math, science and art.

131
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We hope that all of you will come to see the AlloSphere.

132
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Inspire us to think of new ways that we can use

133
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
this unique instrument that we've created at Santa Barbara.

134
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Thank you very much.

135
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
(Applause)

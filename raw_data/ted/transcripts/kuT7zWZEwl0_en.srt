1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I teach history

2
0:00:14.719,000 --> 0:00:16,000
at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.

3
0:00:18.56,000 --> 0:00:21,000
On February 14, 2018,

4
0:00:22.56,000 --> 0:00:28,000
my school experienced one of the worst mass school shootings in American history.

5
0:00:31.2,000 --> 0:00:34,000
People want to know what we saw,

6
0:00:34.48,000 --> 0:00:35,000
what I felt.

7
0:00:37.12,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I don't remember everything,

8
0:00:39.84,000 --> 0:00:42,000
but I do remember I went into crisis mode,

9
0:00:43.24,000 --> 0:00:44,000
mother mode.

10
0:00:44.56,000 --> 0:00:45,000
There was no emotion.

11
0:00:47.2,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I lined up the kids,

12
0:00:48.92,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I held up a sign so they could follow me through the hall,

13
0:00:51.84,000 --> 0:00:52,000
just like a fire drill.

14
0:00:53.92,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I heard shots from one direction.

15
0:00:56.72,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Luckily, we were already moving in the opposite direction.

16
0:01:01.04,000 --> 0:01:02,000
We made it outside.

17
0:01:03.6,000 --> 0:01:04,000
We made it to safety.

18
0:01:06.2,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I called my mother.

19
0:01:08.12,000 --> 0:01:09,000
"I'm OK."

20
0:01:09.56,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I called my husband.

21
0:01:11.84,000 --> 0:01:12,000
"I'm OK."

22
0:01:13.48,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Then my daughter called, my voice cracked, and I knew I had to pull myself together.

23
0:01:22.04,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I sat alone in my thoughts,

24
0:01:24.12,000 --> 0:01:27,000
worried about my colleagues and students.

25
0:01:30.8,000 --> 0:01:34,000
We sat there, only understanding that somehow, Valentine's Day --

26
0:01:38.12,000 --> 0:01:42,000
We sat there, only understanding that somehow, Valentine's Day

27
0:01:42.28,000 --> 0:01:44,000
had ended up with our babies dead,

28
0:01:45.08,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and we didn't know what to do next.

29
0:01:52.68,000 --> 0:01:54,000
It's been two months,

30
0:01:54.88,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and every day I still hear the echoes of the "pop, pop" sound of the gunfire.

31
0:01:59.72,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I remember the fearful faces of my students

32
0:02:02.36,000 --> 0:02:03,000
when we knew it wasn't a drill.

33
0:02:05.76,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Still, there's no constant emotion,

34
0:02:09.76,000 --> 0:02:14,000
except for flashes of pain, grief and anger

35
0:02:15.48,000 --> 0:02:16,000
triggered by the news,

36
0:02:17.36,000 --> 0:02:19,000
or an insensitive comment,

37
0:02:19.84,000 --> 0:02:2,000
or just silence.

38
0:02:26.44,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School lost 17 precious lives

39
0:02:31.76,000 --> 0:02:32,000
on that horrible day.

40
0:02:37.64,000 --> 0:02:4,000
After, students asked us, the adults

41
0:02:41.6,000 --> 0:02:42,000
the hardest question:

42
0:02:43.4,000 --> 0:02:46,000
How can we stop the senseless violence?

43
0:02:47.68,000 --> 0:02:5,000
This was the most difficult question I've been asked.

44
0:02:52.56,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But it was not the first time I've been humbled by a student's question.

45
0:02:56.28,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I've been teaching in the public schools for 33 years,

46
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:03,000
so I know you have to admit what you don't know

47
0:03:03.44,000 --> 0:03:05,000
before you can share what you do know.

48
0:03:06.32,000 --> 0:03:1,000
In fact, there's a method to being an engaged student,

49
0:03:11.12,000 --> 0:03:12,000
teacher, citizen.

50
0:03:13.68,000 --> 0:03:17,000
First, listen closely to the person asking you a question.

51
0:03:20.08,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Second, admit your vulnerability. Admit what you don't know.

52
0:03:25.72,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Third, do your homework.

53
0:03:28.76,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Fourth, humbly share your knowledge.

54
0:03:33.36,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I know all about this process.

55
0:03:35.56,000 --> 0:03:39,000
My students ask really thoughtful questions all the time.

56
0:03:39.68,000 --> 0:03:4,000
They're eager to learn,

57
0:03:41.32,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and sometimes they're eager to prove their smarts.

58
0:03:45.88,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And believe me, they know when I have no idea of the answer,

59
0:03:49.68,000 --> 0:03:51,000
so in those instances, I say to them,

60
0:03:52.12,000 --> 0:03:55,000
"That's a great question. Let me research that and get back to you."

61
0:03:57.72,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So when my students asked,

62
0:03:59.84,000 --> 0:04:01,000
"How do we stop this senseless violence?"

63
0:04:02.44,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I listened,

64
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and then I admitted,

65
0:04:08.24,000 --> 0:04:09,000
"I don't know."

66
0:04:10.56,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And like I always do when I don't know the answer to one of my questions,

67
0:04:14.28,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I began doing my homework.

68
0:04:18.4,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And as a history teacher,

69
0:04:19.68,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I knew I needed to start with the Second Amendment and the NRA.

70
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:28,000
In case it's been a while since you've been sitting in a history class,

71
0:04:28.92,000 --> 0:04:29,000
here is what the Second Amendment

72
0:04:30.56,000 --> 0:04:31,000
actually says:

73
0:04:33.36,000 --> 0:04:35,000
"A well regulated Militia,

74
0:04:35.64,000 --> 0:04:38,000
being necessary to the security of a free State,

75
0:04:39.04,000 --> 0:04:41,000
the right of the people to keep and bear arms,

76
0:04:41.92,000 --> 0:04:42,000
shall not be infringed."

77
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Meaning, the federal government could not infringe on the rights of citizens

78
0:04:48.68,000 --> 0:04:51,000
to participate in well-regulated militias.

79
0:04:53.4,000 --> 0:04:57,000
The Second Amendment was ratified 226 years ago.

80
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
It was written in a time before the federal government's armed forces

81
0:05:01.92,000 --> 0:05:03,000
were among the most powerful in the world

82
0:05:04.2,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and when state militias were viewed as necessary to protect the states.

83
0:05:09.84,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Fast-forward 80 years, to 1871.

84
0:05:14.2,000 --> 0:05:17,000
The American Civil War had ended a few years prior,

85
0:05:17.56,000 --> 0:05:18,000
but a couple of Union officers

86
0:05:19.52,000 --> 0:05:22,000
had witnessed some pretty shoddy marksmanship on the battlefield.

87
0:05:24.08,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So in an attempt to prepare their men for any future conflicts,

88
0:05:28.76,000 --> 0:05:31,000
they founded the National Rifle Association

89
0:05:31.8,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to promote rifle practice.

90
0:05:35.08,000 --> 0:05:38,000
In short, the Second Amendment was written to ensure

91
0:05:38.44,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that our newly formed and fragile country

92
0:05:41.24,000 --> 0:05:44,000
had access to organized state militias.

93
0:05:45.24,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And the NRA's original mission was to ensure future soldiers had good aim.

94
0:05:54.2,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Someone could teach an entire course

95
0:05:56.2,000 --> 0:06:01,000
on how the next 150 years influenced the gun regulation conversations

96
0:06:01.24,000 --> 0:06:02,000
we're having in the United States

97
0:06:02.88,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and our interpretation of the Second Amendment.

98
0:06:06.76,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Almost every pivotal moment in our nation's history

99
0:06:10.32,000 --> 0:06:11,000
in one way or another

100
0:06:11.6,000 --> 0:06:12,000
influenced how we as a people

101
0:06:13.44,000 --> 0:06:17,000
manufacture, debate, regulate and feel about guns.

102
0:06:20.08,000 --> 0:06:21,000
A lot of change has occurred.

103
0:06:22.8,000 --> 0:06:25,000
As a matter of fact, it wasn't until 2008

104
0:06:26.36,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that the Supreme Court ruled for the first time

105
0:06:29.4,000 --> 0:06:33,000
the Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm

106
0:06:33.8,000 --> 0:06:35,000
unconnected with service in a militia

107
0:06:36.36,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes,

108
0:06:40.2,000 --> 0:06:42,000
such as self-defense within the home.

109
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Within the home.

110
0:06:46.8,000 --> 0:06:49,000
This change over time is striking to me,

111
0:06:50.2,000 --> 0:06:51,000
because it reminds us

112
0:06:51.76,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that the interpretation of the Second Amendment

113
0:06:55.08,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and cultural attitudes about guns

114
0:06:57.92,000 --> 0:06:58,000
have changed over time.

115
0:07:00.88,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Which gives me hope they could change again.

116
0:07:05.04,000 --> 0:07:09,000
(Applause)

117
0:07:13.48,000 --> 0:07:16,000
It's an incredibly complex and dynamic history lesson,

118
0:07:16.8,000 --> 0:07:18,000
but it's not the lesson I'm here to teach today,

119
0:07:19.08,000 --> 0:07:2,000
because we don't have time.

120
0:07:20.76,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I'm not talking about time,

121
0:07:22.36,000 --> 0:07:25,000
the time that I have here to stand and speak.

122
0:07:25.72,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I'm talking about the fact we don't have time to lose.

123
0:07:30.12,000 --> 0:07:32,000
According to the CDC,

124
0:07:32.24,000 --> 0:07:34,000
over the last five years,

125
0:07:34.52,000 --> 0:07:4,000
on average, each day 96 people are killed by guns in the United States,

126
0:07:41.2,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and if we don't figure out how to answer my students' question soon,

127
0:07:47.32,000 --> 0:07:48,000
one of us could be next.

128
0:07:51.12,000 --> 0:07:56,000
So, if the question is, how do we stop this senseless violence,

129
0:07:56.28,000 --> 0:07:58,000
the best way I can think to answer

130
0:07:58.64,000 --> 0:08:,000
is to look at multiple choice.

131
0:08:00.8,000 --> 0:08:03,000
You remember multiple-choice questions in high school, don't you?

132
0:08:05.2,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Let's start.

133
0:08:07.96,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Choice A: this will end when we hold gun manufacturers responsible

134
0:08:13.2,000 --> 0:08:15,000
for the deadliness of their products.

135
0:08:16.2,000 --> 0:08:2,000
It might surprise you to learn that we've actually thought about this before.

136
0:08:20.28,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Between 1998 and 2000,

137
0:08:23.2,000 --> 0:08:26,000
30 counties and cities sued gun manufacturers,

138
0:08:27.04,000 --> 0:08:29,000
saying they should make their products safer

139
0:08:29.72,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and do a better job of tracking where their products are sold.

140
0:08:34.84,000 --> 0:08:36,000
In response, manufacturers argued

141
0:08:37.72,000 --> 0:08:4,000
that they had no direct liability for how their products were used.

142
0:08:42.2,000 --> 0:08:47,000
They said the stores who sold the guns and the owners who bought them

143
0:08:47.4,000 --> 0:08:49,000
were responsible should anything bad happen.

144
0:08:51.559,000 --> 0:08:53,000
In response to this and many other lawsuits,

145
0:08:54.12,000 --> 0:08:58,000
the NRA lobbied for the passage of the PLCAA,

146
0:08:59.08,000 --> 0:09:02,000
the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.

147
0:09:03,000 --> 0:09:08,000
The PLCAA passed with bipartisan support in 2005

148
0:09:08.36,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and entrusts gun manufacturers

149
0:09:10.92,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to design guns safely,

150
0:09:13.48,000 --> 0:09:16,000
stores to sell those guns responsibly

151
0:09:17.76,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and someone to own and use the gun responsibly.

152
0:09:23.72,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And so when 17 students and faculty die at my school,

153
0:09:30.2,000 --> 0:09:34,000
no one in this chain will assume responsibility.

154
0:09:42.4,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Let's take a look at another option,

155
0:09:44.64,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Choice B:

156
0:09:46.68,000 --> 0:09:48,000
this will end when we hold ourselves accountable

157
0:09:49.48,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and regulate the estimated 300 million guns available in America.

158
0:09:55.24,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Yes, voting is one of the best ways

159
0:09:57.6,000 --> 0:09:59,000
to take personal responsibility for gun violence.

160
0:10:00.6,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Making sure that our lawmakers are willing to pass commonsense gun reform

161
0:10:05.56,000 --> 0:10:1,000
is one of the most effective ways to get those 300 million guns under control.

162
0:10:11.32,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And also, gun owners can take personal initiative.

163
0:10:15.96,000 --> 0:10:16,000
If you own a gun,

164
0:10:17.76,000 --> 0:10:18,000
ask yourself:

165
0:10:19.92,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Do I have an extra gun I don't need?

166
0:10:22.76,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Could it fall into the wrong hands?

167
0:10:25.36,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Have I attended the latest training?

168
0:10:29.92,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Perhaps as a gun owner,

169
0:10:31.68,000 --> 0:10:32,000
you should also ask

170
0:10:32.96,000 --> 0:10:35,000
whether you have been taking care of your mental health?

171
0:10:36.04,000 --> 0:10:4,000
When it comes to gun violence, the mental health argument falls flat

172
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
if we don't acknowledge our own personal vulnerabilities

173
0:10:43.64,000 --> 0:10:44,000
to mental illness.

174
0:10:45.84,000 --> 0:10:49,000
One in six Americans will struggle with mental illness.

175
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:54,000
If we own a gun, we should be rigorously engaged in the upkeep

176
0:10:54.84,000 --> 0:10:56,000
of our emotional well-being

177
0:10:57.08,000 --> 0:10:58,000
so we don't pull a trigger

178
0:10:59.04,000 --> 0:11:,000
in times of illness.

179
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Otherwise, we should seriously ask ourselves

180
0:11:04.56,000 --> 0:11:07,000
whether we really have the time and attention to own a gun.

181
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Perhaps for some of us

182
0:11:15.4,000 --> 0:11:17,000
it's time to lay down our arms.

183
0:11:20.88,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Then we have Choice C:

184
0:11:22.64,000 --> 0:11:25,000
this will end when we do a better job of taking care of each other.

185
0:11:26.64,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Many social issues affect why people buy and use guns.

186
0:11:30.56,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Sixty-two percent of US gun fatalities

187
0:11:34.12,000 --> 0:11:38,000
between 2012 and 2016 were suicides,

188
0:11:39.8,000 --> 0:11:44,000
yet we call people maniacs and psychos, shaming them.

189
0:11:44.92,000 --> 0:11:47,000
We are creating barriers for people that need help.

190
0:11:48.36,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Why are we embarrassing each other?

191
0:11:51.72,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Let's make it easier, not harder,

192
0:11:53.72,000 --> 0:11:55,000
for people to access better mental health care.

193
0:11:57.2,000 --> 0:12:01,000
What else? Sexism, racism and poverty affect gun ownership

194
0:12:02.12,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and gun-related fatalities.

195
0:12:05.36,000 --> 0:12:09,000
On average, it's estimated that 50 women were fatally shot each month

196
0:12:10.32,000 --> 0:12:13,000
between 2010 and 2014

197
0:12:13.96,000 --> 0:12:15,000
due to domestic violence,

198
0:12:16.28,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and women are still dying in their homes.

199
0:12:20.36,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Let's empower women

200
0:12:21.88,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and give our young boys a chance to learn

201
0:12:23.88,000 --> 0:12:27,000
how to work out their conflicts and emotions with words, not weapons.

202
0:12:29.72,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And the "Washington Post" reported that last year,

203
0:12:33.04,000 --> 0:12:36,000
nearly 1,000 people were fatally wounded

204
0:12:36.72,000 --> 0:12:38,000
by on-duty police officers.

205
0:12:39.72,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Talk to Black Lives Matter and the police union about that.

206
0:12:43.84,000 --> 0:12:44,000
We need to tackle this.

207
0:12:45.56,000 --> 0:12:49,000
(Applause)

208
0:12:52.64,000 --> 0:12:53,000
At the end of the day,

209
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
perhaps people won't feel the need

210
0:12:56.92,000 --> 0:12:58,000
to buy and use a gun

211
0:12:59.68,000 --> 0:13:03,000
when they all equally feel safe,

212
0:13:04.52,000 --> 0:13:07,000
healthy, respected and cared for.

213
0:13:10.08,000 --> 0:13:12,000
All right, discussion time is over.

214
0:13:12.24,000 --> 0:13:14,000
It's now time to answer the question.

215
0:13:14.84,000 --> 0:13:17,000
How do we stop this senseless violence?

216
0:13:17.92,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Is it Choice A,

217
0:13:21.8,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Choice B,

218
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Choice C?

219
0:13:26.24,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Now, I know what you're all thinking.

220
0:13:28.76,000 --> 0:13:3,000
You remember that multiple-choice questions

221
0:13:30.84,000 --> 0:13:32,000
almost never end with just three possibilities.

222
0:13:33.48,000 --> 0:13:36,000
There's always that fourth, Choice D: all of the above.

223
0:13:38.32,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Maybe that's the answer here.

224
0:13:42.24,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Or maybe "all of the above" is too easy, and this is not an easy problem.

225
0:13:48.96,000 --> 0:13:53,000
It requires deep analytical thinking by all of us.

226
0:13:54.36,000 --> 0:13:58,000
So instead, I'm asking you to do your homework,

227
0:13:58.8,000 --> 0:14:,000
write your own Choice D

228
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:03,000
using supporting detail.

229
0:14:03.4,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And if you're not sure where to start, look to my students as role models.

230
0:14:07.2,000 --> 0:14:1,000
They are armed with incredible communication skills

231
0:14:10.48,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and a sense of citizenship that I find so inspiring.

232
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
(Applause)

233
0:14:24.36,000 --> 0:14:29,000
These are public school kids engaged in the issue of gun regulation,

234
0:14:29.8,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and their endeavor has moved our hearts.

235
0:14:33.08,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And they shouldn't have to do this on their own.

236
0:14:36.36,000 --> 0:14:37,000
They're asking you,

237
0:14:38,000 --> 0:14:39,000
they're asking all of us,

238
0:14:39.8,000 --> 0:14:4,000
to get involved.

239
0:14:42.56,000 --> 0:14:44,000
This isn't a spectator sport.

240
0:14:45.8,000 --> 0:14:48,000
So what's the right answer?

241
0:14:49.32,000 --> 0:14:52,000
I don't know. Listen, I'm no gun control expert.

242
0:14:52.92,000 --> 0:14:53,000
I teach the humanities.

243
0:14:55.8,000 --> 0:14:56,000
To be human is to learn,

244
0:14:57.76,000 --> 0:15:01,000
and to be part of a civilization is to share your knowledge.

245
0:15:01.88,000 --> 0:15:04,000
This kind of honest, brave and sincere engagement

246
0:15:05.44,000 --> 0:15:07,000
is what I ask of my students,

247
0:15:07.6,000 --> 0:15:1,000
what I expect of myself as a teacher

248
0:15:10.68,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and what I demand of you now.

249
0:15:14.32,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Every one of you needs to do your homework.

250
0:15:17.12,000 --> 0:15:18,000
And then what?

251
0:15:18.36,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Humbly share your knowledge with each other.

252
0:15:21.76,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Please teach your family,

253
0:15:24.8,000 --> 0:15:25,000
teach your community,

254
0:15:26.24,000 --> 0:15:29,000
your city council, your state legislature.

255
0:15:30.08,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Teach Congress a lesson.

256
0:15:33.08,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Thank you.

257
0:15:34.32,000 --> 0:15:37,000
(Applause)

258
0:15:38.12,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Thank you. Thank you.

259
0:15:40.6,000 --> 0:15:45,000
(Applause)

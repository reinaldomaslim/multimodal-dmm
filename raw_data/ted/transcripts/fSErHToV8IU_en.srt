1
0:00:12.713,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm going to be showing some of the cybercriminals'

2
0:00:14.345,000 --> 0:00:16,000
latest and nastiest creations.

3
0:00:16.807,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So basically, please don't go and download

4
0:00:19.715,000 --> 0:00:21,000
any of the viruses that I show you.

5
0:00:22.411,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Some of you might be wondering what a cybersecurity specialist looks like,

6
0:00:25.429,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and I thought I'd give you a quick insight

7
0:00:27.598,000 --> 0:00:29,000
into my career so far.

8
0:00:30.276,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It's a pretty accurate description.

9
0:00:32.777,000 --> 0:00:33,000
This is what someone that specializes

10
0:00:34.433,000 --> 0:00:36,000
in malware and hacking looks like.

11
0:00:36.853,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So today, computer viruses and trojans,

12
0:00:40.267,000 --> 0:00:42,000
designed to do everything from stealing data

13
0:00:43.147,000 --> 0:00:45,000
to watching you in your webcam

14
0:00:45.188,000 --> 0:00:47,000
to the theft of billions of dollars.

15
0:00:47.966,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Some malicious code today goes as far

16
0:00:50.161,000 --> 0:00:54,000
as targeting power, utilities and infrastructure.

17
0:00:54.304,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Let me give you a quick snapshot

18
0:00:56.265,000 --> 0:00:58,000
of what malicious code is capable of today.

19
0:00:58.879,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Right now, every second, eight new users

20
0:01:01.949,000 --> 0:01:03,000
are joining the Internet.

21
0:01:04.104,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Today, we will see 250,000 individual new computer viruses.

22
0:01:11.412,000 --> 0:01:16,000
We will see 30,000 new infected websites.

23
0:01:17.185,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And, just to kind of tear down a myth here,

24
0:01:19.271,000 --> 0:01:21,000
lots of people think that when you get infected

25
0:01:21.759,000 --> 0:01:24,000
with a computer virus, it's because you went to a porn site.

26
0:01:25.21,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Right? Well, actually, statistically speaking,

27
0:01:27.653,000 --> 0:01:3,000
if you only visit porn sites, you're safer.

28
0:01:30.778,000 --> 0:01:33,000
People normally write that down, by the way. (Laughter)

29
0:01:33.78,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Actually, about 80 percent of these

30
0:01:35.342,000 --> 0:01:38,000
are small business websites getting infected.

31
0:01:38.855,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Today's cybercriminal, what do they look like?

32
0:01:41.14,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Well, many of you have the image, don't you,

33
0:01:43.566,000 --> 0:01:45,000
of the spotty teenager sitting in a basement,

34
0:01:45.742,000 --> 0:01:47,000
hacking away for notoriety.

35
0:01:48.13,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But actually today, cybercriminals

36
0:01:49.753,000 --> 0:01:52,000
are wonderfully professional and organized.

37
0:01:53.064,000 --> 0:01:55,000
In fact, they have product adverts.

38
0:01:55.935,000 --> 0:01:57,000
You can go online and buy a hacking service

39
0:01:58.066,000 --> 0:02:,000
to knock your business competitor offline.

40
0:02:00.215,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Check out this one I found.

41
0:02:01.774,000 --> 0:02:02,000
(Video) Man: So you're here for one reason,

42
0:02:03.593,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and that reason is

43
0:02:05.058,000 --> 0:02:06,000
because you need your business competitors,

44
0:02:06.97,000 --> 0:02:09,000
rivals, haters, or whatever the reason is, or who,

45
0:02:10.922,000 --> 0:02:11,000
they are to go down.

46
0:02:12.666,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Well you, my friend, you've came to the right place.

47
0:02:15.526,000 --> 0:02:17,000
If you want your business competitors to go down,

48
0:02:17.942,000 --> 0:02:18,000
well, they can.

49
0:02:19.278,000 --> 0:02:22,000
If you want your rivals to go offline, well, they will.

50
0:02:22.702,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Not only that, we are providing a short-term-to-long-term

51
0:02:25.729,000 --> 0:02:27,000
DDOS service or scheduled attack,

52
0:02:28.084,000 --> 0:02:31,000
starting five dollars per hour for small personal websites

53
0:02:31.895,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to 10 to 50 dollars per hour.

54
0:02:34.799,000 --> 0:02:35,000
James Lyne: Now, I did actually pay

55
0:02:36.122,000 --> 0:02:38,000
one of these cybercriminals to attack my own website.

56
0:02:38.915,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Things got a bit tricky when I tried to expense it at the company.

57
0:02:42.409,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Turns out that's not cool.

58
0:02:44.123,000 --> 0:02:47,000
But regardless, it's amazing how many products

59
0:02:47.133,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and services are available now to cybercriminals.

60
0:02:50.245,000 --> 0:02:52,000
For example, this testing platform,

61
0:02:52.721,000 --> 0:02:53,000
which enables the cybercriminals

62
0:02:54.436,000 --> 0:02:56,000
to test the quality of their viruses

63
0:02:56.918,000 --> 0:02:58,000
before they release them on the world.

64
0:02:59.37,000 --> 0:03:,000
For a small fee, they can upload it

65
0:03:01.327,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and make sure everything is good.

66
0:03:02.993,000 --> 0:03:03,000
But it goes further.

67
0:03:04.526,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Cybercriminals now have crime packs

68
0:03:06.771,000 --> 0:03:09,000
with business intelligence reporting dashboards

69
0:03:09.89,000 --> 0:03:12,000
to manage the distribution of their malicious code.

70
0:03:13.366,000 --> 0:03:16,000
This is the market leader in malware distribution,

71
0:03:16.894,000 --> 0:03:17,000
the Black Hole Exploit Pack,

72
0:03:18.532,000 --> 0:03:21,000
responsible for nearly one third of malware distribution

73
0:03:22.191,000 --> 0:03:23,000
in the last couple of quarters.

74
0:03:24.165,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It comes with technical installation guides,

75
0:03:27.174,000 --> 0:03:28,000
video setup routines,

76
0:03:28.219,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and get this, technical support.

77
0:03:32.174,000 --> 0:03:34,000
You can email the cybercriminals and they'll tell you

78
0:03:34.562,000 --> 0:03:37,000
how to set up your illegal hacking server.

79
0:03:38.184,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So let me show you what malicious code looks like today.

80
0:03:42.468,000 --> 0:03:44,000
What I've got here is two systems,

81
0:03:44.78,000 --> 0:03:47,000
an attacker, which I've made look all Matrix-y and scary,

82
0:03:48.47,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and a victim, which you might recognize from home or work.

83
0:03:51.772,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Now normally, these would be on different sides

84
0:03:54.501,000 --> 0:03:56,000
of the planet or of the Internet,

85
0:03:57.056,000 --> 0:03:58,000
but I've put them side by side

86
0:03:58.452,000 --> 0:04:,000
because it makes things much more interesting.

87
0:04:01.116,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Now, there are many ways you can get infected.

88
0:04:03.171,000 --> 0:04:05,000
You will have come in contact with some of them.

89
0:04:05.763,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Maybe some of you have received an email

90
0:04:07.859,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that says something like, "Hi, I'm a Nigerian banker,

91
0:04:11.944,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and I'd like to give you 53 billion dollars

92
0:04:14.708,000 --> 0:04:16,000
because I like your face."

93
0:04:17.135,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Or funnycats.exe, which rumor has it

94
0:04:20.529,000 --> 0:04:23,000
was quite successful in China's recent campaign against America.

95
0:04:24.298,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Now there are many ways you can get infected.

96
0:04:26.728,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I want to show you a couple of my favorites.

97
0:04:28.715,000 --> 0:04:3,000
This is a little USB key.

98
0:04:31.375,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Now how do you get a USB key to run in a business?

99
0:04:33.532,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Well, you could try looking really cute.

100
0:04:37.657,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Awww.

101
0:04:39.595,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Or, in my case, awkward and pathetic.

102
0:04:41.958,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So imagine this scenario: I walk into one of your businesses,

103
0:04:46.147,000 --> 0:04:48,000
looking very awkward and pathetic, with a copy of my C.V.

104
0:04:48.989,000 --> 0:04:49,000
which I've covered in coffee,

105
0:04:50.888,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and I ask the receptionist to plug in this USB key

106
0:04:54.275,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and print me a new one.

107
0:04:56.224,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So let's have a look here on my victim computer.

108
0:04:59.454,000 --> 0:05:02,000
What I'm going to do is plug in the USB key.

109
0:05:02.7,000 --> 0:05:03,000
After a couple of seconds,

110
0:05:04.19,000 --> 0:05:06,000
things start to happen on the computer on their own,

111
0:05:06.941,000 --> 0:05:07,000
usually a bad sign.

112
0:05:08.876,000 --> 0:05:09,000
This would, of course, normally happen

113
0:05:10.57,000 --> 0:05:12,000
in a couple of seconds, really, really quickly,

114
0:05:13.328,000 --> 0:05:14,000
but I've kind of slowed it down

115
0:05:14.988,000 --> 0:05:16,000
so you can actually see the attack occurring.

116
0:05:17.818,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Malware is very boring otherwise.

117
0:05:20.335,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So this is writing out the malicious code,

118
0:05:22.932,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and a few seconds later, on the left-hand side,

119
0:05:26.729,000 --> 0:05:3,000
you'll see the attacker's screen get some interesting new text.

120
0:05:31.027,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Now if I place the mouse cursor over it,

121
0:05:32.958,000 --> 0:05:34,000
this is what we call a command prompt,

122
0:05:35.265,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and using this we can navigate around the computer.

123
0:05:39.062,000 --> 0:05:41,000
We can access your documents, your data.

124
0:05:41.221,000 --> 0:05:42,000
You can turn on the webcam.

125
0:05:42.722,000 --> 0:05:43,000
That can be very embarrassing.

126
0:05:44.351,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Or just to really prove a point,

127
0:05:46.074,000 --> 0:05:49,000
we can launch programs like my personal favorite,

128
0:05:49.195,000 --> 0:05:51,000
the Windows Calculator.

129
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So isn't it amazing how much control

130
0:05:54.288,000 --> 0:05:56,000
the attackers can get with such a simple operation?

131
0:05:57.183,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Let me show you how most malware

132
0:05:59.114,000 --> 0:06:01,000
is now distributed today.

133
0:06:01.297,000 --> 0:06:03,000
What I'm going to do is open up a website

134
0:06:03.817,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that I wrote.

135
0:06:05.133,000 --> 0:06:09,000
It's a terrible website. It's got really awful graphics.

136
0:06:09.448,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And it's got a comments section here

137
0:06:11.642,000 --> 0:06:14,000
where we can submit comments to the website.

138
0:06:15.323,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Many of you will have used something a bit like this before.

139
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Unfortunately, when this was implemented,

140
0:06:20.277,000 --> 0:06:22,000
the developer was slightly inebriated

141
0:06:22.702,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and managed to forget

142
0:06:23.944,000 --> 0:06:25,000
all of the secure coding practices he had learned.

143
0:06:26.933,000 --> 0:06:29,000
So let's imagine that our attacker,

144
0:06:29.999,000 --> 0:06:32,000
called Evil Hacker just for comedy value,

145
0:06:33.447,000 --> 0:06:35,000
inserts something a little nasty.

146
0:06:35.47,000 --> 0:06:36,000
This is a script.

147
0:06:37.169,000 --> 0:06:41,000
It's code which will be interpreted on the webpage.

148
0:06:41.246,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So I'm going to submit this post,

149
0:06:43.571,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and then, on my victim computer,

150
0:06:45.953,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I'm going to open up the web browser

151
0:06:47.98,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and browse to my website,

152
0:06:50.233,000 --> 0:06:53,000
www.incrediblyhacked.com.

153
0:06:54.022,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Notice that after a couple of seconds,

154
0:06:56.146,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I get redirected.

155
0:06:57.603,000 --> 0:06:58,000
That website address at the top there,

156
0:06:59.58,000 --> 0:07:02,000
which you can just about see, microshaft.com,

157
0:07:02.911,000 --> 0:07:05,000
the browser crashes as it hits one of these exploit packs,

158
0:07:06.104,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and up pops fake antivirus.

159
0:07:10.128,000 --> 0:07:15,000
This is a virus pretending to look like antivirus software,

160
0:07:15.184,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and it will go through and it will scan the system,

161
0:07:17.549,000 --> 0:07:18,000
have a look at what its popping up here.

162
0:07:19.057,000 --> 0:07:2,000
It creates some very serious alerts.

163
0:07:20.805,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Oh look, a child porn proxy server.

164
0:07:23.148,000 --> 0:07:25,000
We really should clean that up.

165
0:07:25.58,000 --> 0:07:26,000
What's really insulting about this is

166
0:07:27.164,000 --> 0:07:31,000
not only does it provide the attackers with access to your data,

167
0:07:31.402,000 --> 0:07:33,000
but when the scan finishes, they tell you

168
0:07:34.225,000 --> 0:07:37,000
in order to clean up the fake viruses,

169
0:07:37.348,000 --> 0:07:39,000
you have to register the product.

170
0:07:40.024,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Now I liked it better when viruses were free.

171
0:07:43.36,000 --> 0:07:45,000
(Laughter)

172
0:07:46.139,000 --> 0:07:48,000
People now pay cybercriminals money

173
0:07:48.665,000 --> 0:07:5,000
to run viruses,

174
0:07:50.766,000 --> 0:07:52,000
which I find utterly bizarre.

175
0:07:53.527,000 --> 0:07:56,000
So anyway, let me change pace a little bit.

176
0:07:57.063,000 --> 0:08:,000
Chasing 250,000 pieces of malware a day

177
0:08:00.569,000 --> 0:08:01,000
is a massive challenge,

178
0:08:02.224,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and those numbers are only growing

179
0:08:04.294,000 --> 0:08:07,000
directly in proportion to the length of my stress line, you'll note here.

180
0:08:08.173,000 --> 0:08:09,000
So I want to talk to you briefly

181
0:08:10.049,000 --> 0:08:13,000
about a group of hackers we tracked for a year

182
0:08:13.099,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and actually found --

183
0:08:15.106,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and this is a rare treat in our job.

184
0:08:17.683,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Now this was a cross-industry collaboration,

185
0:08:20.166,000 --> 0:08:22,000
people from Facebook, independent researchers,

186
0:08:22.555,000 --> 0:08:24,000
guys from Sophos.

187
0:08:24.636,000 --> 0:08:26,000
So here we have a couple of documents

188
0:08:27.291,000 --> 0:08:29,000
which our cybercriminals had uploaded

189
0:08:30.117,000 --> 0:08:34,000
to a cloud service, kind of like Dropbox or SkyDrive,

190
0:08:34.494,000 --> 0:08:36,000
like many of you might use.

191
0:08:36.703,000 --> 0:08:39,000
At the top, you'll notice a section of source code.

192
0:08:40.095,000 --> 0:08:42,000
What this would do is send the cybercriminals

193
0:08:43.063,000 --> 0:08:48,000
a text message every day telling them how much money

194
0:08:48.103,000 --> 0:08:49,000
they'd made that day,

195
0:08:49.769,000 --> 0:08:52,000
so a kind of cybercriminal billings report, if you will.

196
0:08:53.065,000 --> 0:08:55,000
If you look closely, you'll notice a series

197
0:08:55.822,000 --> 0:08:57,000
of what are Russian telephone numbers.

198
0:08:58.805,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Now that's obviously interesting,

199
0:09:00.284,000 --> 0:09:03,000
because that gives us a way of finding our cybercriminals.

200
0:09:03.521,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Down below, highlighted in red,

201
0:09:05.636,000 --> 0:09:06,000
in the other section of source code,

202
0:09:07.387,000 --> 0:09:09,000
is this bit "leded:leded."

203
0:09:10.13,000 --> 0:09:11,000
That's a username,

204
0:09:11.419,000 --> 0:09:13,000
kind of like you might have on Twitter.

205
0:09:14.278,000 --> 0:09:15,000
So let's take this a little further.

206
0:09:15.509,000 --> 0:09:17,000
There are a few other interesting pieces

207
0:09:17.767,000 --> 0:09:19,000
the cybercriminals had uploaded.

208
0:09:20.042,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Lots of you here will use smartphones

209
0:09:22.614,000 --> 0:09:24,000
to take photos and post them from the conference.

210
0:09:25.261,000 --> 0:09:27,000
An interesting feature of lots of modern smartphones

211
0:09:28.098,000 --> 0:09:29,000
is that when you take a photo,

212
0:09:29.765,000 --> 0:09:33,000
it embeds GPS data about where that photo was taken.

213
0:09:34.002,000 --> 0:09:36,000
In fact, I've been spending a lot of time

214
0:09:36.445,000 --> 0:09:38,000
on Internet dating sites recently,

215
0:09:38.689,000 --> 0:09:4,000
obviously for research purposes,

216
0:09:41.1,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and I've noticed that about 60 percent

217
0:09:44.621,000 --> 0:09:46,000
of the profile pictures on Internet dating sites

218
0:09:47.444,000 --> 0:09:51,000
contain the GPS coordinates of where the photo was taken,

219
0:09:51.895,000 --> 0:09:52,000
which is kind of scary

220
0:09:52.956,000 --> 0:09:54,000
because you wouldn't give out your home address

221
0:09:55.518,000 --> 0:09:56,000
to lots of strangers,

222
0:09:56.967,000 --> 0:09:57,000
but we're happy to give away our GPS coordinates

223
0:09:58.961,000 --> 0:10:02,000
to plus or minus 15 meters.

224
0:10:02.99,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And our cybercriminals had done the same thing.

225
0:10:06.224,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So here's a photo which resolves to St. Petersburg.

226
0:10:09.428,000 --> 0:10:12,000
We then deploy the incredibly advanced hacking tool.

227
0:10:13.114,000 --> 0:10:15,000
We used Google.

228
0:10:15.509,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Using the email address, the telephone number

229
0:10:17.734,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and the GPS data, on the left you see an advert

230
0:10:21.283,000 --> 0:10:24,000
for a BMW that one of our cybercriminals is selling,

231
0:10:24.952,000 --> 0:10:29,000
on the other side an advert for the sale of sphynx kittens.

232
0:10:30.3,000 --> 0:10:33,000
One of these was more stereotypical for me.

233
0:10:33.4,000 --> 0:10:36,000
A little more searching, and here's our cybercriminal.

234
0:10:37.389,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Imagine, these are hardened cybercriminals

235
0:10:40.935,000 --> 0:10:41,000
sharing information scarcely.

236
0:10:42.803,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Imagine what you could find

237
0:10:43.951,000 --> 0:10:44,000
about each of the people in this room.

238
0:10:45.654,000 --> 0:10:46,000
A bit more searching through the profile

239
0:10:47.46,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and there's a photo of their office.

240
0:10:49.32,000 --> 0:10:51,000
They were working on the third floor.

241
0:10:51.368,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And you can also see some photos

242
0:10:53.567,000 --> 0:10:54,000
from his business companion

243
0:10:54.742,000 --> 0:10:58,000
where he has a taste in a certain kind of image.

244
0:10:59.581,000 --> 0:11:02,000
It turns out he's a member of the Russian Adult Webmasters Federation.

245
0:11:03.576,000 --> 0:11:06,000
But this is where our investigation starts to slow down.

246
0:11:06.593,000 --> 0:11:09,000
The cybercriminals have locked down their profiles quite well.

247
0:11:10.536,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And herein is the greatest lesson

248
0:11:12.571,000 --> 0:11:16,000
of social media and mobile devices for all of us right now.

249
0:11:17.149,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Our friends, our families and our colleagues

250
0:11:20.879,000 --> 0:11:24,000
can break our security even when we do the right things.

251
0:11:25.568,000 --> 0:11:27,000
This is MobSoft, one of the companies

252
0:11:28.348,000 --> 0:11:3,000
that this cybercriminal gang owned,

253
0:11:30.514,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and an interesting thing about MobSoft

254
0:11:32.103,000 --> 0:11:34,000
is the 50-percent owner of this

255
0:11:34.974,000 --> 0:11:35,000
posted a job advert,

256
0:11:36.921,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and this job advert matched one of the telephone numbers

257
0:11:40.301,000 --> 0:11:42,000
from the code earlier.

258
0:11:42.453,000 --> 0:11:44,000
This woman was Maria,

259
0:11:44.578,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and Maria is the wife of one of our cybercriminals.

260
0:11:47.458,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And it's kind of like she went into her social media settings

261
0:11:50.978,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and clicked on every option imaginable

262
0:11:53.773,000 --> 0:11:56,000
to make herself really, really insecure.

263
0:11:57.47,000 --> 0:11:58,000
By the end of the investigation,

264
0:11:59.037,000 --> 0:12:02,000
where you can read the full 27-page report at that link,

265
0:12:02.596,000 --> 0:12:04,000
we had photos of the cybercriminals,

266
0:12:04.63,000 --> 0:12:06,000
even the office Christmas party

267
0:12:07.525,000 --> 0:12:08,000
when they were out on an outing.

268
0:12:09.391,000 --> 0:12:12,000
That's right, cybercriminals do have Christmas parties,

269
0:12:12.64,000 --> 0:12:13,000
as it turns out.

270
0:12:14.228,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Now you're probably wondering what happened to these guys.

271
0:12:16.463,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Let me come back to that in just a minute.

272
0:12:19.4,000 --> 0:12:21,000
I want to change pace to one last little demonstration,

273
0:12:22.147,000 --> 0:12:25,000
a technique that is wonderfully simple and basic,

274
0:12:26.116,000 --> 0:12:29,000
but is interesting in exposing how much information

275
0:12:29.181,000 --> 0:12:3,000
we're all giving away,

276
0:12:30.957,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and it's relevant because it applies to us as a TED audience.

277
0:12:35.235,000 --> 0:12:37,000
This is normally when people start kind of shuffling in their pockets

278
0:12:37.685,000 --> 0:12:41,000
trying to turn their phones onto airplane mode desperately.

279
0:12:41.903,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Many of you all know about the concept

280
0:12:43.589,000 --> 0:12:45,000
of scanning for wireless networks.

281
0:12:45.932,000 --> 0:12:48,000
You do it every time you take out your iPhone or your Blackberry

282
0:12:49.333,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and connect to something like TEDAttendees.

283
0:12:53.353,000 --> 0:12:54,000
But what you might not know

284
0:12:55.1,000 --> 0:12:59,000
is that you're also beaming out a list of networks

285
0:12:59.851,000 --> 0:13:01,000
you've previously connected to,

286
0:13:02.273,000 --> 0:13:06,000
even when you're not using wireless actively.

287
0:13:06.42,000 --> 0:13:07,000
So I ran a little scan.

288
0:13:08.147,000 --> 0:13:1,000
I was relatively inhibited compared to the cybercriminals,

289
0:13:11.073,000 --> 0:13:13,000
who wouldn't be so concerned by law,

290
0:13:13.617,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and here you can see my mobile device.

291
0:13:16.204,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Okay? So you can see a list of wireless networks.

292
0:13:18.858,000 --> 0:13:22,000
TEDAttendees, HyattLB. Where do you think I'm staying?

293
0:13:23.485,000 --> 0:13:26,000
My home network, PrettyFlyForAWifi,

294
0:13:26.978,000 --> 0:13:27,000
which I think is a great name.

295
0:13:28.743,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Sophos_Visitors, SANSEMEA, companies I work with.

296
0:13:31.51,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Loganwifi, that's in Boston. HiltonLondon.

297
0:13:34.818,000 --> 0:13:36,000
CIASurveillanceVan.

298
0:13:37.259,000 --> 0:13:38,000
We called it that at one of our conferences

299
0:13:38.868,000 --> 0:13:39,000
because we thought that would freak people out,

300
0:13:40.604,000 --> 0:13:41,000
which is quite fun.

301
0:13:42.598,000 --> 0:13:46,000
This is how geeks party.

302
0:13:47.256,000 --> 0:13:49,000
So let's make this a little bit more interesting.

303
0:13:49.463,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Let's talk about you.

304
0:13:52.001,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Twenty-three percent of you have been to Starbucks

305
0:13:54.111,000 --> 0:13:57,000
recently and used the wireless network.

306
0:13:57.226,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Things get more interesting.

307
0:13:58.39,000 --> 0:14:,000
Forty-six percent of you I could link to a business,

308
0:14:00.836,000 --> 0:14:02,000
XYZ Employee network.

309
0:14:03.706,000 --> 0:14:07,000
This isn't an exact science, but it gets pretty accurate.

310
0:14:07.885,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Seven hundred and sixty-one of you I could identify a hotel you'd been to recently,

311
0:14:12.354,000 --> 0:14:15,000
absolutely with pinpoint precision somewhere on the globe.

312
0:14:16.193,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Two hundred and thirty-four of you, well, I know where you live.

313
0:14:20.141,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Your wireless network name is so unique

314
0:14:22.46,000 --> 0:14:23,000
that I was able to pinpoint it

315
0:14:24.009,000 --> 0:14:26,000
using data available openly on the Internet

316
0:14:26.676,000 --> 0:14:3,000
with no hacking or clever, clever tricks.

317
0:14:30.924,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And I should mention as well that

318
0:14:32.744,000 --> 0:14:33,000
some of you do use your names,

319
0:14:34.286,000 --> 0:14:36,000
"James Lyne's iPhone," for example.

320
0:14:36.882,000 --> 0:14:4,000
And two percent of you have a tendency to extreme profanity.

321
0:14:41.24,000 --> 0:14:43,000
So something for you to think about:

322
0:14:43.244,000 --> 0:14:46,000
As we adopt these new applications and mobile devices,

323
0:14:47.157,000 --> 0:14:49,000
as we play with these shiny new toys,

324
0:14:49.474,000 --> 0:14:52,000
how much are we trading off convenience

325
0:14:53.296,000 --> 0:14:55,000
for privacy and security?

326
0:14:56.186,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Next time you install something,

327
0:14:58.244,000 --> 0:15:,000
look at the settings and ask yourself,

328
0:15:00.548,000 --> 0:15:03,000
"Is this information that I want to share?

329
0:15:04.1,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Would someone be able to abuse it?"

330
0:15:06.99,000 --> 0:15:08,000
We also need to think very carefully

331
0:15:09.062,000 --> 0:15:13,000
about how we develop our future talent pool.

332
0:15:13.203,000 --> 0:15:15,000
You see, technology's changing at a staggering rate,

333
0:15:16.182,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and that 250,000 pieces of malware

334
0:15:19.358,000 --> 0:15:21,000
won't stay the same for long.

335
0:15:22.23,000 --> 0:15:24,000
There's a very concerning trend

336
0:15:24.428,000 --> 0:15:27,000
that whilst many people coming out of schools now

337
0:15:27.621,000 --> 0:15:31,000
are much more technology-savvy, they know how to use technology,

338
0:15:32.033,000 --> 0:15:35,000
fewer and fewer people are following the feeder subjects

339
0:15:35.646,000 --> 0:15:39,000
to know how that technology works under the covers.

340
0:15:39.97,000 --> 0:15:43,000
In the U.K., a 60 percent reduction since 2003,

341
0:15:44.355,000 --> 0:15:47,000
and there are similar statistics all over the world.

342
0:15:48.13,000 --> 0:15:52,000
We also need to think about the legal issues in this area.

343
0:15:52.206,000 --> 0:15:53,000
The cybercriminals I talked about,

344
0:15:53.733,000 --> 0:15:55,000
despite theft of millions of dollars,

345
0:15:55.872,000 --> 0:15:57,000
actually still haven't been arrested,

346
0:15:57.981,000 --> 0:16:,000
and at this point possibly never will.

347
0:16:01.54,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Most laws are national in their implementation,

348
0:16:05.04,000 --> 0:16:08,000
despite cybercrime conventions, where the Internet

349
0:16:09.039,000 --> 0:16:12,000
is borderless and international by definition.

350
0:16:12.145,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Countries do not agree, which makes this area

351
0:16:14.978,000 --> 0:16:17,000
exceptionally challenging from a legal perspective.

352
0:16:18.595,000 --> 0:16:22,000
But my biggest ask is this:

353
0:16:22.955,000 --> 0:16:23,000
You see, you're going to leave here

354
0:16:24.597,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and you're going to see some astonishing stories in the news.

355
0:16:28.314,000 --> 0:16:3,000
You're going to read about malware doing incredible

356
0:16:30.488,000 --> 0:16:33,000
and terrifying, scary things.

357
0:16:33.749,000 --> 0:16:36,000
However, 99 percent of it works

358
0:16:37.678,000 --> 0:16:41,000
because people fail to do the basics.

359
0:16:41.868,000 --> 0:16:44,000
So my ask is this: Go online,

360
0:16:44.89,000 --> 0:16:46,000
find these simple best practices,

361
0:16:47.535,000 --> 0:16:49,000
find out how to update and patch your computer.

362
0:16:50.089,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Get a secure password.

363
0:16:51.64,000 --> 0:16:52,000
Make sure you use a different password

364
0:16:53.17,000 --> 0:16:56,000
on each of your sites and services online.

365
0:16:56.521,000 --> 0:16:59,000
Find these resources. Apply them.

366
0:16:59.764,000 --> 0:17:01,000
The Internet is a fantastic resource

367
0:17:02.375,000 --> 0:17:04,000
for business, for political expression,

368
0:17:04.44,000 --> 0:17:06,000
for art and for learning.

369
0:17:06.771,000 --> 0:17:09,000
Help me and the security community

370
0:17:09.953,000 --> 0:17:12,000
make life much, much more difficult

371
0:17:13.421,000 --> 0:17:14,000
for cybercriminals.

372
0:17:15.373,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Thank you.

373
0:17:16.701,000 --> 0:17:2,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.122,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Imagine waking up to a stranger --

2
0:00:15.687,000 --> 0:00:17,000
sometimes multiple strangers --

3
0:00:18.939,000 --> 0:00:2,000
questioning your right to existence

4
0:00:21.801,000 --> 0:00:23,000
for something that you wrote online,

5
0:00:25.48,000 --> 0:00:28,000
waking up to an angry message,

6
0:00:28.825,000 --> 0:00:3,000
scared and worried for your safety.

7
0:00:31.975,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Welcome to the world of cyberharassment.

8
0:00:35.344,000 --> 0:00:38,000
The kind of harassment that women face in Pakistan is very serious

9
0:00:39.299,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and leads to sometimes deadly outcomes.

10
0:00:43.066,000 --> 0:00:46,000
This kind of harassment keeps women from accessing the internet --

11
0:00:46.414,000 --> 0:00:47,000
essentially, knowledge.

12
0:00:48.926,000 --> 0:00:5,000
It's a form of oppression.

13
0:00:52.819,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Pakistan is the sixth most populous country in the world,

14
0:00:56.532,000 --> 0:00:59,000
with 140 million people having access to mobile technologies,

15
0:01:00.38,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and 15 percent internet penetration.

16
0:01:05.256,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And this number doesn't seem to go down with the rise of new technologies.

17
0:01:10.27,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Pakistan is also the birthplace of the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner,

18
0:01:15.583,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Malala Yousafzai.

19
0:01:18.438,000 --> 0:01:2,000
But that's just one aspect of Pakistan.

20
0:01:21.961,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Another aspect is where the twisted concept of honor

21
0:01:26.148,000 --> 0:01:28,000
is linked to women and their bodies;

22
0:01:29.924,000 --> 0:01:32,000
where men are allowed to disrespect women

23
0:01:33.183,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and even kill them sometimes

24
0:01:35.024,000 --> 0:01:37,000
in the name of so-called "family honor";

25
0:01:38.522,000 --> 0:01:42,000
where women are left to die right outside their houses

26
0:01:43.095,000 --> 0:01:45,000
for speaking to a man on a mobile phone,

27
0:01:45.707,000 --> 0:01:46,000
in the name of "family honor."

28
0:01:48.158,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Let me say this very clearly:

29
0:01:50.681,000 --> 0:01:51,000
it's not honor;

30
0:01:52.17,000 --> 0:01:54,000
it's a cold-blooded murder.

31
0:01:57.551,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I come from a very small village in Punjab, Pakistan,

32
0:02:01.726,000 --> 0:02:05,000
where women are not allowed to pursue their higher education.

33
0:02:07.308,000 --> 0:02:1,000
The elders of my extended family didn't allow their women

34
0:02:11.046,000 --> 0:02:14,000
to pursue their higher education or their professional careers.

35
0:02:14.932,000 --> 0:02:18,000
However, unlike the other male guardians of my family,

36
0:02:19.082,000 --> 0:02:24,000
my father was one who really supported my ambitions.

37
0:02:25.941,000 --> 0:02:26,000
To get my law degree,

38
0:02:28.344,000 --> 0:02:31,000
of course, it was really difficult,

39
0:02:32.281,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and [there were] frowns of disapproval.

40
0:02:37.373,000 --> 0:02:4,000
But in the end, I knew it's either me or them,

41
0:02:40.891,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and I chose myself.

42
0:02:44.446,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Applause)

43
0:02:50.673,000 --> 0:02:53,000
My family's traditions and expectations for a woman

44
0:02:53.856,000 --> 0:02:55,000
wouldn't allow me to own a mobile phone until I was married.

45
0:02:57.544,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And even when I was married,

46
0:02:59.651,000 --> 0:03:03,000
this tool became a tool for my own surveillance.

47
0:03:04.923,000 --> 0:03:08,000
When I resisted this idea of being surveilled by my ex-husband,

48
0:03:09.377,000 --> 0:03:1,000
he really didn't approve of this

49
0:03:11.09,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and threw me out of his house,

50
0:03:13.198,000 --> 0:03:16,000
along with my six-month-old son, Abdullah.

51
0:03:17.436,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And that was the time when I first asked myself, "Why?

52
0:03:21.779,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Why are women not allowed to enjoy the same equal rights

53
0:03:25.549,000 --> 0:03:26,000
enshrined in our Constitution?

54
0:03:28.631,000 --> 0:03:31,000
While the law states that a woman has the same equal access

55
0:03:32.605,000 --> 0:03:33,000
to the information,

56
0:03:34.058,000 --> 0:03:37,000
why is it always men -- brothers, fathers and husbands --

57
0:03:37.861,000 --> 0:03:39,000
who are granting these rights to us,

58
0:03:39.924,000 --> 0:03:41,000
effectively making the law irrelevant?"

59
0:03:44.801,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So I decided to take a step,

60
0:03:46.582,000 --> 0:03:48,000
instead of keep questioning these patriarchal structures

61
0:03:49.573,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and societal norms.

62
0:03:51.656,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And I founded the Digital Rights Foundation in 2012

63
0:03:55.66,000 --> 0:04:01,000
to address all the issues and women's experiences in online spaces

64
0:04:02.136,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and cyberharassment.

65
0:04:04.99,000 --> 0:04:07,000
From lobbying for free and safe internet

66
0:04:08.941,000 --> 0:04:09,000
to convincing young women

67
0:04:10.428,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that access to the safe internet is their fundamental, basic, human right,

68
0:04:15.678,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I'm trying to play my part in igniting the spark

69
0:04:18.632,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to address the questions that have bothered me all these years.

70
0:04:22.955,000 --> 0:04:23,000
With a hope in my heart,

71
0:04:24.832,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and to offer a solution to this menace,

72
0:04:27.422,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I started Pakistan's and the region's first cyberharassment help line

73
0:04:31.828,000 --> 0:04:32,000
in December 2016 --

74
0:04:33.668,000 --> 0:04:38,000
(Applause)

75
0:04:40.038,000 --> 0:04:44,000
to extend my support to the women who do not know who to turn to

76
0:04:44.335,000 --> 0:04:46,000
when they face serious threats online.

77
0:04:47.757,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I think of the women who do not have the necessary support

78
0:04:51.791,000 --> 0:04:56,000
to deal with the mental trauma when they feel unsafe in online spaces,

79
0:04:57.369,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and they go about their daily activities,

80
0:04:59.476,000 --> 0:05:02,000
thinking that there is a rape threat in their in-box.

81
0:05:03.329,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Safe access to the internet is an access to knowledge,

82
0:05:07.515,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and knowledge is freedom.

83
0:05:09.367,000 --> 0:05:11,000
When I fight for women's digital rights,

84
0:05:11.509,000 --> 0:05:12,000
I'm fighting for equality.

85
0:05:13.405,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Thank you.

86
0:05:14.58,000 --> 0:05:15,000
(Applause)

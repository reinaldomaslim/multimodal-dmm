1
0:00:13.617,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So when I was eight years old,

2
0:00:15.582,000 --> 0:00:17,000
a new girl came to join the class,

3
0:00:17.74,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and she was so impressive,

4
0:00:20.773,000 --> 0:00:22,000
as the new girl always seems to be.

5
0:00:23.055,000 --> 0:00:25,000
She had vast quantities of very shiny hair

6
0:00:25.733,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and a cute little pencil case,

7
0:00:28.773,000 --> 0:00:31,000
super strong on state capitals,

8
0:00:32.361,000 --> 0:00:34,000
just a great speller.

9
0:00:34.853,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And I just curdled with jealousy that year,

10
0:00:39.803,000 --> 0:00:42,000
until I hatched my devious plan.

11
0:00:43.346,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So one day I stayed a little late after school,

12
0:00:47.579,000 --> 0:00:51,000
a little too late, and I lurked in the girls' bathroom.

13
0:00:51.659,000 --> 0:00:53,000
When the coast was clear, I emerged,

14
0:00:53.994,000 --> 0:00:54,000
crept into the classroom,

15
0:00:55.733,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and took from my teacher's desk the grade book.

16
0:00:59.59,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And then I did it.

17
0:01:01.926,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I fiddled with my rival's grades,

18
0:01:04.293,000 --> 0:01:06,000
just a little, just demoted some of those A's.

19
0:01:07.123,000 --> 0:01:1,000
All of those A's. (Laughter)

20
0:01:10.222,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And I got ready to return the book to the drawer,

21
0:01:13.965,000 --> 0:01:16,000
when hang on, some of my other classmates

22
0:01:16.999,000 --> 0:01:19,000
had appallingly good grades too.

23
0:01:20.492,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So, in a frenzy,

24
0:01:22.54,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I corrected everybody's marks,

25
0:01:24.528,000 --> 0:01:25,000
not imaginatively.

26
0:01:26.437,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I gave everybody a row of D's

27
0:01:28.951,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and I gave myself a row of A's,

28
0:01:31.752,000 --> 0:01:33,000
just because I was there, you know, might as well.

29
0:01:34.552,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And I am still baffled by my behavior.

30
0:01:40.162,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I don't understand where the idea came from.

31
0:01:42.574,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I don't understand why I felt so great doing it.

32
0:01:45.903,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I felt great.

33
0:01:47.426,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I don't understand why I was never caught.

34
0:01:50.005,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I mean, it should have been so blatantly obvious.

35
0:01:51.601,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I was never caught.

36
0:01:52.914,000 --> 0:01:54,000
But most of all, I am baffled by,

37
0:01:55.435,000 --> 0:01:56,000
why did it bother me so much

38
0:01:56.942,000 --> 0:01:57,000
that this little girl, this tiny little girl,

39
0:01:58.886,000 --> 0:01:59,000
was so good at spelling?

40
0:02:00.6,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Jealousy baffles me.

41
0:02:02.71,000 --> 0:02:04,000
It's so mysterious, and it's so pervasive.

42
0:02:05.634,000 --> 0:02:07,000
We know babies suffer from jealousy.

43
0:02:08.1,000 --> 0:02:11,000
We know primates do. Bluebirds are actually very prone.

44
0:02:11.75,000 --> 0:02:14,000
We know that jealousy is the number one cause

45
0:02:15.27,000 --> 0:02:17,000
of spousal murder in the United States.

46
0:02:18.186,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And yet, I have never read a study

47
0:02:21.29,000 --> 0:02:23,000
that can parse to me its loneliness

48
0:02:24.205,000 --> 0:02:28,000
or its longevity or its grim thrill.

49
0:02:29.059,000 --> 0:02:31,000
For that, we have to go to fiction,

50
0:02:31.906,000 --> 0:02:33,000
because the novel is the lab

51
0:02:34.246,000 --> 0:02:35,000
that has studied jealousy

52
0:02:35.82,000 --> 0:02:37,000
in every possible configuration.

53
0:02:37.894,000 --> 0:02:4,000
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say

54
0:02:41.218,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that if we didn't have jealousy,

55
0:02:43.25,000 --> 0:02:45,000
would we even have literature?

56
0:02:45.8,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Well no faithless Helen, no "Odyssey."

57
0:02:49.39,000 --> 0:02:51,000
No jealous king, no "Arabian Nights."

58
0:02:52.228,000 --> 0:02:55,000
No Shakespeare.

59
0:02:55.365,000 --> 0:02:57,000
There goes high school reading lists,

60
0:02:57.555,000 --> 0:02:58,000
because we're losing "Sound and the Fury,"

61
0:02:59.367,000 --> 0:03:01,000
we're losing "Gatsby," "Sun Also Rises,"

62
0:03:01.616,000 --> 0:03:05,000
we're losing "Madame Bovary," "Anna K."

63
0:03:05.743,000 --> 0:03:07,000
No jealousy, no Proust. And now, I mean,

64
0:03:08.15,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I know it's fashionable to say that Proust

65
0:03:09.911,000 --> 0:03:1,000
has the answers to everything,

66
0:03:11.518,000 --> 0:03:13,000
but in the case of jealousy,

67
0:03:14.224,000 --> 0:03:16,000
he kind of does.

68
0:03:16.965,000 --> 0:03:19,000
This year is the centennial of his masterpiece, "In Search of Lost Time,"

69
0:03:20.951,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and it's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy

70
0:03:24.952,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and just regular competitiveness, my brand,

71
0:03:27.104,000 --> 0:03:29,000
that we can hope to have. (Laughter)

72
0:03:29.689,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And we think about Proust, we think

73
0:03:32.116,000 --> 0:03:33,000
about the sentimental bits, right?

74
0:03:33.61,000 --> 0:03:34,000
We think about a little boy trying to get to sleep.

75
0:03:35.565,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea.

76
0:03:39.746,000 --> 0:03:41,000
We forget how harsh his vision was.

77
0:03:41.772,000 --> 0:03:42,000
We forget how pitiless he is.

78
0:03:43.612,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I mean, these are books that Virginia Woolf said

79
0:03:45.933,000 --> 0:03:47,000
were tough as cat gut.

80
0:03:48.269,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I don't know what cat gut is,

81
0:03:50.317,000 --> 0:03:52,000
but let's assume it's formidable.

82
0:03:53.218,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Let's look at why they go so well together,

83
0:03:56.436,000 --> 0:03:59,000
the novel and jealousy, jealousy and Proust.

84
0:04:00.114,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Is it something as obvious as that jealousy,

85
0:04:03.345,000 --> 0:04:06,000
which boils down into person, desire, impediment,

86
0:04:06.728,000 --> 0:04:1,000
is such a solid narrative foundation?

87
0:04:11.396,000 --> 0:04:13,000
I don't know. I think it cuts very close to the bone,

88
0:04:14.071,000 --> 0:04:16,000
because let's think about what happens

89
0:04:16.12,000 --> 0:04:17,000
when we feel jealous.

90
0:04:17.898,000 --> 0:04:2,000
When we feel jealous, we tell ourselves a story.

91
0:04:21.85,000 --> 0:04:25,000
We tell ourselves a story about other people's lives,

92
0:04:26.133,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and these stories make us feel terrible

93
0:04:28.807,000 --> 0:04:3,000
because they're designed to make us feel terrible.

94
0:04:31.03,000 --> 0:04:33,000
As the teller of the tale and the audience,

95
0:04:33.564,000 --> 0:04:34,000
we know just what details to include,

96
0:04:35.538,000 --> 0:04:38,000
to dig that knife in. Right?

97
0:04:39.107,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Jealousy makes us all amateur novelists,

98
0:04:42.462,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and this is something Proust understood.

99
0:04:44.478,000 --> 0:04:47,000
In the first volume, Swann's Way,

100
0:04:47.651,000 --> 0:04:48,000
the series of books,

101
0:04:49.475,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Swann, one of the main characters,

102
0:04:51.181,000 --> 0:04:54,000
is thinking very fondly of his mistress

103
0:04:54.409,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and how great she is in bed,

104
0:04:56.101,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and suddenly, in the course of a few sentences,

105
0:04:59.143,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and these are Proustian sentences,

106
0:05:01.184,000 --> 0:05:02,000
so they're long as rivers,

107
0:05:02.696,000 --> 0:05:04,000
but in the course of a few sentences,

108
0:05:04.959,000 --> 0:05:06,000
he suddenly recoils and he realizes,

109
0:05:07.366,000 --> 0:05:1,000
"Hang on, everything I love about this woman,

110
0:05:10.649,000 --> 0:05:13,000
somebody else would love about this woman.

111
0:05:14.42,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Everything that she does that gives me pleasure

112
0:05:17.511,000 --> 0:05:18,000
could be giving somebody else pleasure,

113
0:05:19.22,000 --> 0:05:21,000
maybe right about now."

114
0:05:21.498,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And this is the story he starts to tell himself,

115
0:05:24.282,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and from then on, Proust writes that

116
0:05:26.145,000 --> 0:05:29,000
every fresh charm Swann detects in his mistress,

117
0:05:29.192,000 --> 0:05:31,000
he adds to his "collection of instruments

118
0:05:31.856,000 --> 0:05:34,000
in his private torture chamber."

119
0:05:35.478,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Now Swann and Proust, we have to admit,

120
0:05:37.753,000 --> 0:05:38,000
were notoriously jealous.

121
0:05:39.429,000 --> 0:05:4,000
You know, Proust's boyfriends would have to leave

122
0:05:41.133,000 --> 0:05:43,000
the country if they wanted to break up with him.

123
0:05:43.737,000 --> 0:05:45,000
But you don't have to be that jealous

124
0:05:46.64,000 --> 0:05:48,000
to concede that it's hard work. Right?

125
0:05:49.551,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Jealousy is exhausting.

126
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
It's a hungry emotion. It must be fed.

127
0:05:54.807,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And what does jealousy like?

128
0:05:56.896,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Jealousy likes information.

129
0:05:59.986,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Jealousy likes details.

130
0:06:02.375,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair,

131
0:06:05.198,000 --> 0:06:07,000
the cute little pencil case.

132
0:06:07.664,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Jealousy likes photos.

133
0:06:09.206,000 --> 0:06:12,000
That's why Instagram is such a hit. (Laughter)

134
0:06:12.936,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Proust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy.

135
0:06:16.897,000 --> 0:06:18,000
When Swann is in his jealous throes,

136
0:06:19.339,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and suddenly he's listening at doorways

137
0:06:21.51,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and bribing his mistress' servants,

138
0:06:23.533,000 --> 0:06:24,000
he defends these behaviors.

139
0:06:24.985,000 --> 0:06:26,000
He says, "You know, look, I know you think this is repugnant,

140
0:06:27.402,000 --> 0:06:28,000
but it is no different

141
0:06:29.208,000 --> 0:06:31,000
from interpreting an ancient text

142
0:06:31.558,000 --> 0:06:32,000
or looking at a monument."

143
0:06:33.225,000 --> 0:06:35,000
He says, "They are scientific investigations

144
0:06:35.822,000 --> 0:06:38,000
with real intellectual value."

145
0:06:38.825,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Proust is trying to show us that jealousy

146
0:06:40.937,000 --> 0:06:42,000
feels intolerable and makes us look absurd,

147
0:06:43.828,000 --> 0:06:47,000
but it is, at its crux, a quest for knowledge,

148
0:06:48.498,000 --> 0:06:51,000
a quest for truth, painful truth,

149
0:06:51.899,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and actually, where Proust is concerned,

150
0:06:53.828,000 --> 0:06:55,000
the more painful the truth, the better.

151
0:06:56.62,000 --> 0:07:,000
Grief, humiliation, loss:

152
0:07:01.357,000 --> 0:07:03,000
These were the avenues to wisdom for Proust.

153
0:07:04.313,000 --> 0:07:07,000
He says, "A woman whom we need,

154
0:07:08.215,000 --> 0:07:1,000
who makes us suffer, elicits from us

155
0:07:11.001,000 --> 0:07:14,000
a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital

156
0:07:14.506,000 --> 0:07:18,000
than a man of genius who interests us."

157
0:07:18.945,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Is he telling us to just go and find cruel women?

158
0:07:21.82,000 --> 0:07:23,000
No. I think he's trying to say

159
0:07:24.117,000 --> 0:07:27,000
that jealousy reveals us to ourselves.

160
0:07:27.286,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And does any other emotion crack us open

161
0:07:30.182,000 --> 0:07:32,000
in this particular way?

162
0:07:32.51,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Does any other emotion reveal to us

163
0:07:34.59,000 --> 0:07:37,000
our aggression and our hideous ambition

164
0:07:37.923,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and our entitlement?

165
0:07:40.322,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Does any other emotion teach us to look

166
0:07:42.972,000 --> 0:07:45,000
with such peculiar intensity?

167
0:07:46.164,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Freud would write about this later.

168
0:07:48.316,000 --> 0:07:5,000
One day, Freud was visited

169
0:07:50.57,000 --> 0:07:52,000
by this very anxious young man who was consumed

170
0:07:52.892,000 --> 0:07:54,000
with the thought of his wife cheating on him.

171
0:07:55.395,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And Freud says, it's something strange about this guy,

172
0:07:57.472,000 --> 0:07:59,000
because he's not looking at what his wife is doing.

173
0:07:59.586,000 --> 0:08:,000
Because she's blameless; everybody knows it.

174
0:08:01.557,000 --> 0:08:02,000
The poor creature is just

175
0:08:02.887,000 --> 0:08:03,000
under suspicion for no cause.

176
0:08:04.885,000 --> 0:08:06,000
But he's looking for things that his wife is doing

177
0:08:07.694,000 --> 0:08:09,000
without noticing, unintentional behaviors.

178
0:08:10.194,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Is she smiling too brightly here,

179
0:08:12.511,000 --> 0:08:15,000
or did she accidentally brush up against a man there?

180
0:08:15.851,000 --> 0:08:17,000
[Freud] says that the man is becoming

181
0:08:18.527,000 --> 0:08:22,000
the custodian of his wife's unconscious.

182
0:08:22.875,000 --> 0:08:23,000
The novel is very good on this point.

183
0:08:24.696,000 --> 0:08:26,000
The novel is very good at describing how jealousy

184
0:08:27.504,000 --> 0:08:3,000
trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy.

185
0:08:31.488,000 --> 0:08:35,000
In fact, the more intensely jealous we are,

186
0:08:35.563,000 --> 0:08:37,000
the more we become residents of fantasy.

187
0:08:38.082,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And this is why, I think, jealousy doesn't

188
0:08:41.002,000 --> 0:08:43,000
just provoke us to do violent things

189
0:08:43.818,000 --> 0:08:45,000
or illegal things.

190
0:08:45.818,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Jealousy prompts us to behave in ways

191
0:08:48.1,000 --> 0:08:5,000
that are wildly inventive.

192
0:08:50.458,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Now I'm thinking of myself at eight, I concede,

193
0:08:52.901,000 --> 0:08:56,000
but I'm also thinking of this story I heard on the news.

194
0:08:56.92,000 --> 0:08:59,000
A 52-year-old Michigan woman was caught

195
0:09:00.828,000 --> 0:09:02,000
creating a fake Facebook account

196
0:09:03.697,000 --> 0:09:06,000
from which she sent vile, hideous messages

197
0:09:07.42,000 --> 0:09:11,000
to herself for a year.

198
0:09:11.645,000 --> 0:09:13,000
For a year. A year.

199
0:09:13.77,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And she was trying to frame

200
0:09:15.645,000 --> 0:09:17,000
her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend,

201
0:09:17.802,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and I have to confess when I heard this,

202
0:09:21.443,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I just reacted with admiration.

203
0:09:23.355,000 --> 0:09:24,000
(Laughter)

204
0:09:24.932,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Because, I mean, let's be real.

205
0:09:27.347,000 --> 0:09:31,000
What immense, if misplaced, creativity. Right?

206
0:09:31.664,000 --> 0:09:33,000
This is something from a novel.

207
0:09:34.084,000 --> 0:09:37,000
This is something from a Patricia Highsmith novel.

208
0:09:37.485,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Now Highsmith is a particular favorite of mine.

209
0:09:39.655,000 --> 0:09:43,000
She is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of American letters.

210
0:09:43.707,000 --> 0:09:45,000
She's the author of "Strangers on a Train"

211
0:09:45.9,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and "The Talented Mr. Ripley,"

212
0:09:47.948,000 --> 0:09:5,000
books that are all about how jealousy,

213
0:09:51.013,000 --> 0:09:52,000
it muddles our minds,

214
0:09:52.888,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and once we're in the sphere, in that realm of jealousy,

215
0:09:55.882,000 --> 0:10:,000
the membrane between what is and what could be

216
0:10:01.145,000 --> 0:10:03,000
can be pierced in an instant.

217
0:10:04.038,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Take Tom Ripley, her most famous character.

218
0:10:06.486,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Now, Tom Ripley goes from wanting you

219
0:10:09.325,000 --> 0:10:11,000
or wanting what you have

220
0:10:11.501,000 --> 0:10:14,000
to being you and having what you once had,

221
0:10:14.929,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and you're under the floorboards,

222
0:10:16.462,000 --> 0:10:17,000
he's answering to your name,

223
0:10:17.825,000 --> 0:10:18,000
he's wearing your rings,

224
0:10:19.517,000 --> 0:10:21,000
emptying your bank account.

225
0:10:21.518,000 --> 0:10:22,000
That's one way to go.

226
0:10:23.493,000 --> 0:10:26,000
But what do we do? We can't go the Tom Ripley route.

227
0:10:27.157,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I can't give the world D's,

228
0:10:29.194,000 --> 0:10:31,000
as much as I would really like to, some days.

229
0:10:32.041,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And it's a pity, because we live in envious times.

230
0:10:35.539,000 --> 0:10:37,000
We live in jealous times.

231
0:10:38.446,000 --> 0:10:4,000
I mean, we're all good citizens of social media,

232
0:10:40.459,000 --> 0:10:43,000
aren't we, where the currency is envy?

233
0:10:43.843,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Does the novel show us a way out? I'm not sure.

234
0:10:48.312,000 --> 0:10:51,000
So let's do what characters always do when they're not sure,

235
0:10:51.753,000 --> 0:10:53,000
when they are in possession of a mystery.

236
0:10:53.929,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Let's go to 221B Baker Street

237
0:10:56.203,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and ask for Sherlock Holmes.

238
0:10:58.221,000 --> 0:11:,000
When people think of Holmes,

239
0:11:00.69,000 --> 0:11:03,000
they think of his nemesis being Professor Moriarty,

240
0:11:03.799,000 --> 0:11:05,000
right, this criminal mastermind.

241
0:11:06.006,000 --> 0:11:08,000
But I've always preferred [Inspector] Lestrade,

242
0:11:08.469,000 --> 0:11:1,000
who is the rat-faced head of Scotland Yard

243
0:11:11.374,000 --> 0:11:12,000
who needs Holmes desperately,

244
0:11:13.104,000 --> 0:11:15,000
needs Holmes' genius, but resents him.

245
0:11:15.408,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Oh, it's so familiar to me.

246
0:11:17.265,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So Lestrade needs his help, resents him,

247
0:11:21.282,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries.

248
0:11:24.593,000 --> 0:11:27,000
But as they work together, something starts to change,

249
0:11:28.47,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and finally in "The Adventure of the Six Napoleons,"

250
0:11:31.513,000 --> 0:11:34,000
once Holmes comes in, dazzles everybody with his solution,

251
0:11:35.443,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Lestrade turns to Holmes and he says,

252
0:11:38.884,000 --> 0:11:42,000
"We're not jealous of you, Mr. Holmes.

253
0:11:43.165,000 --> 0:11:46,000
We're proud of you."

254
0:11:46.524,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And he says that there's not a man at Scotland Yard

255
0:11:48.853,000 --> 0:11:5,000
who wouldn't want to shake Sherlock Holmes' hand.

256
0:11:51.852,000 --> 0:11:53,000
It's one of the few times we see Holmes moved

257
0:11:54.237,000 --> 0:11:56,000
in the mysteries, and I find it very moving,

258
0:11:56.332,000 --> 0:11:59,000
this little scene, but it's also mysterious, right?

259
0:11:59.396,000 --> 0:12:,000
It seems to treat jealousy

260
0:12:01.309,000 --> 0:12:03,000
as a problem of geometry, not emotion.

261
0:12:04.047,000 --> 0:12:06,000
You know, one minute Holmes is on the other side from Lestrade.

262
0:12:06.913,000 --> 0:12:07,000
The next minute they're on the same side.

263
0:12:08.836,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Suddenly, Lestrade is letting himself

264
0:12:10.983,000 --> 0:12:12,000
admire this mind that he's resented.

265
0:12:13.95,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Could it be so simple though?

266
0:12:15.879,000 --> 0:12:17,000
What if jealousy really is a matter of geometry,

267
0:12:18.31,000 --> 0:12:21,000
just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand

268
0:12:22.02,000 --> 0:12:24,000
in relation to another?

269
0:12:24.35,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Well, maybe then we wouldn't have to resent

270
0:12:26.221,000 --> 0:12:28,000
somebody's excellence.

271
0:12:28.282,000 --> 0:12:31,000
We could align ourselves with it.

272
0:12:31.656,000 --> 0:12:33,000
But I like contingency plans.

273
0:12:33.912,000 --> 0:12:35,000
So while we wait for that to happen,

274
0:12:36.248,000 --> 0:12:38,000
let us remember that we have fiction for consolation.

275
0:12:38.944,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Fiction alone demystifies jealousy.

276
0:12:41.395,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Fiction alone domesticates it,

277
0:12:43.478,000 --> 0:12:44,000
invites it to the table.

278
0:12:45.356,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And look who it gathers:

279
0:12:47.229,000 --> 0:12:5,000
sweet Lestrade, terrifying Tom Ripley,

280
0:12:51.065,000 --> 0:12:55,000
crazy Swann, Marcel Proust himself.

281
0:12:55.534,000 --> 0:12:57,000
We are in excellent company.

282
0:12:57.948,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Thank you.

283
0:12:59.368,000 --> 0:13:03,000
(Applause)

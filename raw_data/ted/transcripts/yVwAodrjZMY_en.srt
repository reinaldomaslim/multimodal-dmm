1
0:00:13.072,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Chris Anderson: The rights of citizens,

2
0:00:15.083,000 --> 0:00:17,000
the future of the Internet.

3
0:00:17.169,000 --> 0:00:2,000
So I would like to welcome to the TED stage

4
0:00:20.552,000 --> 0:00:22,000
the man behind those revelations,

5
0:00:23.378,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Ed Snowden.

6
0:00:25.754,000 --> 0:00:28,000
(Applause)

7
0:00:29.321,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Ed is in a remote location somewhere in Russia

8
0:00:33.574,000 --> 0:00:35,000
controlling this bot from his laptop,

9
0:00:36.349,000 --> 0:00:4,000
so he can see what the bot can see.

10
0:00:40.402,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Ed, welcome to the TED stage.

11
0:00:42.35,000 --> 0:00:45,000
What can you see, as a matter of fact?

12
0:00:45.961,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Edward Snowden: Ha, I can see everyone.

13
0:00:47.699,000 --> 0:00:49,000
This is amazing.

14
0:00:49.949,000 --> 0:00:52,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:53.162,000 --> 0:00:56,000
CA: Ed, some questions for you.

16
0:00:56.445,000 --> 0:00:57,000
You've been called many things

17
0:00:57.738,000 --> 0:00:58,000
in the last few months.

18
0:00:59.303,000 --> 0:01:03,000
You've been called a whistleblower, a traitor,

19
0:01:04.228,000 --> 0:01:05,000
a hero.

20
0:01:05.957,000 --> 0:01:08,000
What words would you describe yourself with?

21
0:01:09.774,000 --> 0:01:11,000
ES: You know, everybody who is involved

22
0:01:12.436,000 --> 0:01:13,000
with this debate

23
0:01:13.932,000 --> 0:01:15,000
has been struggling over me and my personality

24
0:01:16.674,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and how to describe me.

25
0:01:19.723,000 --> 0:01:2,000
But when I think about it,

26
0:01:21.412,000 --> 0:01:24,000
this isn't the question that we should be struggling with.

27
0:01:24.841,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Who I am really doesn't matter at all.

28
0:01:28.008,000 --> 0:01:3,000
If I'm the worst person in the world,

29
0:01:30.72,000 --> 0:01:31,000
you can hate me and move on.

30
0:01:32.677,000 --> 0:01:34,000
What really matters here are the issues.

31
0:01:35.212,000 --> 0:01:37,000
What really matters here is the kind of government we want,

32
0:01:38.047,000 --> 0:01:39,000
the kind of Internet we want,

33
0:01:39.56,000 --> 0:01:41,000
the kind of relationship between people

34
0:01:42.118,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and societies.

35
0:01:43.458,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And that's what I'm hoping the debate will move towards,

36
0:01:46.546,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and we've seen that increasing over time.

37
0:01:48.918,000 --> 0:01:49,000
If I had to describe myself,

38
0:01:50.828,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I wouldn't use words like "hero."

39
0:01:52.172,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I wouldn't use "patriot," and I wouldn't use "traitor."

40
0:01:54.874,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I'd say I'm an American and I'm a citizen,

41
0:01:57.068,000 --> 0:01:59,000
just like everyone else.

42
0:01:59.632,000 --> 0:02:,000
CA: So just to give some context

43
0:02:01.505,000 --> 0:02:03,000
for those who don't know the whole story --

44
0:02:03.701,000 --> 0:02:06,000
(Applause) —

45
0:02:07.431,000 --> 0:02:11,000
this time a year ago, you were stationed in Hawaii

46
0:02:11.994,000 --> 0:02:13,000
working as a consultant to the NSA.

47
0:02:14.384,000 --> 0:02:16,000
As a sysadmin, you had access

48
0:02:16.428,000 --> 0:02:18,000
to their systems,

49
0:02:18.833,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and you began revealing certain classified documents

50
0:02:23.087,000 --> 0:02:26,000
to some handpicked journalists

51
0:02:26.287,000 --> 0:02:27,000
leading the way to June's revelations.

52
0:02:27.878,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Now, what propelled you to do this?

53
0:02:33.254,000 --> 0:02:35,000
ES: You know,

54
0:02:36.04,000 --> 0:02:38,000
when I was sitting in Hawaii,

55
0:02:38.22,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and the years before, when I was working in the intelligence community,

56
0:02:40.878,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I saw a lot of things that had disturbed me.

57
0:02:44.6,000 --> 0:02:47,000
We do a lot of good things in the intelligence community,

58
0:02:47.877,000 --> 0:02:48,000
things that need to be done,

59
0:02:49.07,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and things that help everyone.

60
0:02:51.767,000 --> 0:02:52,000
But there are also things that go too far.

61
0:02:53.724,000 --> 0:02:54,000
There are things that shouldn't be done,

62
0:02:55.02,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and decisions that were being made in secret

63
0:02:58.088,000 --> 0:02:59,000
without the public's awareness,

64
0:02:59.336,000 --> 0:03:01,000
without the public's consent,

65
0:03:01.848,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and without even our representatives in government

66
0:03:04.7,000 --> 0:03:07,000
having knowledge of these programs.

67
0:03:08.333,000 --> 0:03:12,000
When I really came to struggle with these issues,

68
0:03:12.866,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I thought to myself,

69
0:03:14.488,000 --> 0:03:17,000
how can I do this in the most responsible way,

70
0:03:17.574,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that maximizes the public benefit

71
0:03:20.582,000 --> 0:03:22,000
while minimizing the risks?

72
0:03:23.293,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And out of all the solutions that I could come up with,

73
0:03:26.381,000 --> 0:03:28,000
out of going to Congress,

74
0:03:28.623,000 --> 0:03:29,000
when there were no laws,

75
0:03:29.926,000 --> 0:03:3,000
there were no legal protections

76
0:03:31.611,000 --> 0:03:32,000
for a private employee,

77
0:03:33.378,000 --> 0:03:36,000
a contractor in intelligence like myself,

78
0:03:36.711,000 --> 0:03:39,000
there was a risk that I would be buried along with the information

79
0:03:40.358,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and the public would never find out.

80
0:03:42.265,000 --> 0:03:45,000
But the First Amendment of the United States Constitution

81
0:03:45.287,000 --> 0:03:48,000
guarantees us a free press for a reason,

82
0:03:48.828,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and that's to enable an adversarial press,

83
0:03:52.033,000 --> 0:03:53,000
to challenge the government,

84
0:03:53.93,000 --> 0:03:55,000
but also to work together with the government,

85
0:03:56.564,000 --> 0:03:58,000
to have a dialogue and debate about how we can

86
0:03:58.882,000 --> 0:04:03,000
inform the public about matters of vital importance

87
0:04:04.321,000 --> 0:04:07,000
without putting our national security at risk.

88
0:04:07.451,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And by working with journalists,

89
0:04:09.127,000 --> 0:04:11,000
by giving all of my information

90
0:04:11.281,000 --> 0:04:13,000
back to the American people,

91
0:04:13.558,000 --> 0:04:14,000
rather than trusting myself to make

92
0:04:15.329,000 --> 0:04:17,000
the decisions about publication,

93
0:04:18.063,000 --> 0:04:2,000
we've had a robust debate

94
0:04:20.299,000 --> 0:04:23,000
with a deep investment by the government

95
0:04:23.566,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that I think has resulted in a benefit for everyone.

96
0:04:28.672,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And the risks that have been threatened,

97
0:04:32.447,000 --> 0:04:34,000
the risks that have been played up

98
0:04:34.58,000 --> 0:04:35,000
by the government

99
0:04:36.132,000 --> 0:04:37,000
have never materialized.

100
0:04:37.558,000 --> 0:04:39,000
We've never seen any evidence

101
0:04:39.636,000 --> 0:04:42,000
of even a single instance of specific harm,

102
0:04:43.192,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and because of that,

103
0:04:44.661,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I'm comfortable with the decisions that I made.

104
0:04:46.788,000 --> 0:04:48,000
CA: So let me show the audience

105
0:04:49.001,000 --> 0:04:51,000
a couple of examples of what you revealed.

106
0:04:51.47,000 --> 0:04:52,000
If we could have a slide up, and Ed,

107
0:04:53.382,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I don't know whether you can see,

108
0:04:55.137,000 --> 0:04:56,000
the slides are here.

109
0:04:56.251,000 --> 0:04:58,000
This is a slide of the PRISM program,

110
0:04:58.836,000 --> 0:05:,000
and maybe you could tell the audience

111
0:05:01.305,000 --> 0:05:03,000
what that was that was revealed.

112
0:05:03.911,000 --> 0:05:05,000
ES: The best way to understand PRISM,

113
0:05:06.123,000 --> 0:05:07,000
because there's been a little bit of controversy,

114
0:05:07.584,000 --> 0:05:1,000
is to first talk about what PRISM isn't.

115
0:05:11.335,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Much of the debate in the U.S. has been about metadata.

116
0:05:14.09,000 --> 0:05:16,000
They've said it's just metadata, it's just metadata,

117
0:05:16.981,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and they're talking about a specific legal authority

118
0:05:19.722,000 --> 0:05:21,000
called Section 215 of the Patriot Act.

119
0:05:22.427,000 --> 0:05:25,000
That allows sort of a warrantless wiretapping,

120
0:05:25.496,000 --> 0:05:27,000
mass surveillance of the entire country's

121
0:05:27.859,000 --> 0:05:29,000
phone records, things like that --

122
0:05:30.016,000 --> 0:05:31,000
who you're talking to,

123
0:05:31.378,000 --> 0:05:33,000
when you're talking to them,

124
0:05:33.406,000 --> 0:05:34,000
where you traveled.

125
0:05:34.702,000 --> 0:05:36,000
These are all metadata events.

126
0:05:37.203,000 --> 0:05:4,000
PRISM is about content.

127
0:05:40.549,000 --> 0:05:42,000
It's a program through which the government could

128
0:05:42.689,000 --> 0:05:44,000
compel corporate America,

129
0:05:44.733,000 --> 0:05:47,000
it could deputize corporate America

130
0:05:48.126,000 --> 0:05:51,000
to do its dirty work for the NSA.

131
0:05:51.99,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And even though some of these companies did resist,

132
0:05:54.986,000 --> 0:05:55,000
even though some of them --

133
0:05:56.409,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I believe Yahoo was one of them —

134
0:05:57.655,000 --> 0:05:59,000
challenged them in court, they all lost,

135
0:06:00.312,000 --> 0:06:02,000
because it was never tried by an open court.

136
0:06:03.227,000 --> 0:06:06,000
They were only tried by a secret court.

137
0:06:06.358,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And something that we've seen,

138
0:06:07.725,000 --> 0:06:09,000
something about the PRISM program that's very concerning to me is,

139
0:06:10.429,000 --> 0:06:11,000
there's been a talking point in the U.S. government

140
0:06:12.408,000 --> 0:06:15,000
where they've said 15 federal judges

141
0:06:16.159,000 --> 0:06:18,000
have reviewed these programs and found them to be lawful,

142
0:06:18.857,000 --> 0:06:2,000
but what they don't tell you

143
0:06:21.577,000 --> 0:06:23,000
is those are secret judges

144
0:06:24.207,000 --> 0:06:26,000
in a secret court

145
0:06:26.209,000 --> 0:06:29,000
based on secret interpretations of law

146
0:06:29.283,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that's considered 34,000 warrant requests

147
0:06:33.517,000 --> 0:06:35,000
over 33 years,

148
0:06:35.976,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and in 33 years only rejected

149
0:06:38.163,000 --> 0:06:4,000
11 government requests.

150
0:06:41.046,000 --> 0:06:43,000
These aren't the people that we want deciding

151
0:06:43.793,000 --> 0:06:45,000
what the role of corporate America

152
0:06:45.939,000 --> 0:06:47,000
in a free and open Internet should be.

153
0:06:48.395,000 --> 0:06:5,000
CA: Now, this slide that we're showing here

154
0:06:50.506,000 --> 0:06:52,000
shows the dates in which

155
0:06:52.718,000 --> 0:06:54,000
different technology companies, Internet companies,

156
0:06:55.133,000 --> 0:06:57,000
are alleged to have joined the program,

157
0:06:57.487,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and where data collection began from them.

158
0:07:00.445,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Now, they have denied collaborating with the NSA.

159
0:07:05.194,000 --> 0:07:1,000
How was that data collected by the NSA?

160
0:07:10.298,000 --> 0:07:13,000
ES: Right. So the NSA's own slides

161
0:07:13.477,000 --> 0:07:15,000
refer to it as direct access.

162
0:07:16.277,000 --> 0:07:18,000
What that means to an actual NSA analyst,

163
0:07:19.027,000 --> 0:07:22,000
someone like me who was working as an intelligence analyst

164
0:07:22.135,000 --> 0:07:24,000
targeting, Chinese cyber-hackers,

165
0:07:24.606,000 --> 0:07:26,000
things like that, in Hawaii,

166
0:07:26.688,000 --> 0:07:27,000
is the provenance of that data

167
0:07:28.657,000 --> 0:07:3,000
is directly from their servers.

168
0:07:30.913,000 --> 0:07:32,000
It doesn't mean

169
0:07:32.977,000 --> 0:07:34,000
that there's a group of company representatives

170
0:07:35.783,000 --> 0:07:37,000
sitting in a smoky room with the NSA

171
0:07:38.22,000 --> 0:07:39,000
palling around and making back-room deals

172
0:07:40.01,000 --> 0:07:42,000
about how they're going to give this stuff away.

173
0:07:42.553,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Now each company handles it different ways.

174
0:07:44.946,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Some are responsible.

175
0:07:46.122,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Some are somewhat less responsible.

176
0:07:48.213,000 --> 0:07:49,000
But the bottom line is, when we talk about

177
0:07:49.981,000 --> 0:07:52,000
how this information is given,

178
0:07:53.36,000 --> 0:07:55,000
it's coming from the companies themselves.

179
0:07:55.846,000 --> 0:07:57,000
It's not stolen from the lines.

180
0:07:58.141,000 --> 0:07:59,000
But there's an important thing to remember here:

181
0:08:00.073,000 --> 0:08:01,000
even though companies pushed back,

182
0:08:02.004,000 --> 0:08:04,000
even though companies demanded,

183
0:08:04.057,000 --> 0:08:06,000
hey, let's do this through a warrant process,

184
0:08:06.603,000 --> 0:08:07,000
let's do this

185
0:08:08.377,000 --> 0:08:11,000
where we actually have some sort of legal review,

186
0:08:11.526,000 --> 0:08:12,000
some sort of basis for handing over

187
0:08:13.357,000 --> 0:08:14,000
these users' data,

188
0:08:15.297,000 --> 0:08:17,000
we saw stories in the Washington Post last year

189
0:08:17.688,000 --> 0:08:2,000
that weren't as well reported as the PRISM story

190
0:08:20.9,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that said the NSA broke in

191
0:08:23.499,000 --> 0:08:24,000
to the data center communications

192
0:08:25.3,000 --> 0:08:27,000
between Google to itself

193
0:08:27.456,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and Yahoo to itself.

194
0:08:29.034,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So even these companies that are cooperating

195
0:08:31.866,000 --> 0:08:33,000
in at least a compelled but hopefully lawful manner

196
0:08:34.737,000 --> 0:08:35,000
with the NSA,

197
0:08:36.61,000 --> 0:08:39,000
the NSA isn't satisfied with that,

198
0:08:39.906,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and because of that, we need our companies

199
0:08:41.884,000 --> 0:08:43,000
to work very hard

200
0:08:44.699,000 --> 0:08:46,000
to guarantee that they're going to represent

201
0:08:47.171,000 --> 0:08:49,000
the interests of the user, and also advocate

202
0:08:49.757,000 --> 0:08:5,000
for the rights of the users.

203
0:08:51.673,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And I think over the last year,

204
0:08:52.947,000 --> 0:08:53,000
we've seen the companies that are named

205
0:08:54.53,000 --> 0:08:55,000
on the PRISM slides

206
0:08:55.948,000 --> 0:08:56,000
take great strides to do that,

207
0:08:57.757,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and I encourage them to continue.

208
0:09:00.01,000 --> 0:09:02,000
CA: What more should they do?

209
0:09:02.692,000 --> 0:09:05,000
ES: The biggest thing that an Internet company

210
0:09:06.209,000 --> 0:09:09,000
in America can do today, right now,

211
0:09:09.435,000 --> 0:09:1,000
without consulting with lawyers,

212
0:09:10.877,000 --> 0:09:13,000
to protect the rights of users worldwide,

213
0:09:14.416,000 --> 0:09:19,000
is to enable SSL web encryption

214
0:09:19.799,000 --> 0:09:21,000
on every page you visit.

215
0:09:21.804,000 --> 0:09:23,000
The reason this matters is today,

216
0:09:24.746,000 --> 0:09:29,000
if you go to look at a copy of "1984" on Amazon.com,

217
0:09:29.984,000 --> 0:09:31,000
the NSA can see a record of that,

218
0:09:32.431,000 --> 0:09:34,000
the Russian intelligence service can see a record of that,

219
0:09:34.65,000 --> 0:09:36,000
the Chinese service can see a record of that,

220
0:09:37.107,000 --> 0:09:38,000
the French service, the German service,

221
0:09:39.005,000 --> 0:09:4,000
the services of Andorra.

222
0:09:40.327,000 --> 0:09:43,000
They can all see it because it's unencrypted.

223
0:09:43.605,000 --> 0:09:46,000
The world's library is Amazon.com,

224
0:09:47.205,000 --> 0:09:49,000
but not only do they not support encryption by default,

225
0:09:49.86,000 --> 0:09:51,000
you cannot choose to use encryption

226
0:09:52.026,000 --> 0:09:53,000
when browsing through books.

227
0:09:53.753,000 --> 0:09:54,000
This is something that we need to change,

228
0:09:55.462,000 --> 0:09:56,000
not just for Amazon, I don't mean to single them out,

229
0:09:57.337,000 --> 0:09:58,000
but they're a great example.

230
0:09:58.829,000 --> 0:09:59,000
All companies need to move

231
0:10:00.497,000 --> 0:10:03,000
to an encrypted browsing habit by default

232
0:10:03.89,000 --> 0:10:05,000
for all users who haven't taken any action

233
0:10:06.374,000 --> 0:10:08,000
or picked any special methods on their own.

234
0:10:08.635,000 --> 0:10:1,000
That'll increase the privacy and the rights

235
0:10:10.946,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that people enjoy worldwide.

236
0:10:13.711,000 --> 0:10:15,000
CA: Ed, come with me to this part of the stage.

237
0:10:16.189,000 --> 0:10:18,000
I want to show you the next slide here. (Applause)

238
0:10:19.142,000 --> 0:10:21,000
This is a program called Boundless Informant.

239
0:10:21.85,000 --> 0:10:22,000
What is that?

240
0:10:23.526,000 --> 0:10:25,000
ES: So, I've got to give credit to the NSA

241
0:10:25.706,000 --> 0:10:27,000
for using appropriate names on this.

242
0:10:28.149,000 --> 0:10:31,000
This is one of my favorite NSA cryptonyms.

243
0:10:31.994,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Boundless Informant

244
0:10:33.464,000 --> 0:10:35,000
is a program that the NSA hid from Congress.

245
0:10:36.314,000 --> 0:10:38,000
The NSA was previously asked by Congress,

246
0:10:38.723,000 --> 0:10:4,000
was there any ability that they had

247
0:10:40.936,000 --> 0:10:43,000
to even give a rough ballpark estimate

248
0:10:44.694,000 --> 0:10:46,000
of the amount of American communications

249
0:10:46.88,000 --> 0:10:48,000
that were being intercepted.

250
0:10:49.014,000 --> 0:10:52,000
They said no. They said, we don't track those stats,

251
0:10:52.045,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and we can't track those stats.

252
0:10:53.594,000 --> 0:10:56,000
We can't tell you how many communications

253
0:10:56.698,000 --> 0:10:57,000
we're intercepting around the world,

254
0:10:58.161,000 --> 0:10:59,000
because to tell you that would be

255
0:10:59.648,000 --> 0:11:02,000
to invade your privacy.

256
0:11:02.955,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Now, I really appreciate that sentiment from them,

257
0:11:05.17,000 --> 0:11:07,000
but the reality, when you look at this slide is,

258
0:11:07.305,000 --> 0:11:08,000
not only do they have the capability,

259
0:11:08.958,000 --> 0:11:1,000
the capability already exists.

260
0:11:11.574,000 --> 0:11:12,000
It's already in place.

261
0:11:13.248,000 --> 0:11:16,000
The NSA has its own internal data format

262
0:11:16.396,000 --> 0:11:2,000
that tracks both ends of a communication,

263
0:11:20.545,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and if it says,

264
0:11:21.827,000 --> 0:11:23,000
this communication came from America,

265
0:11:23.853,000 --> 0:11:25,000
they can tell Congress how many of those communications

266
0:11:26.209,000 --> 0:11:28,000
they have today, right now.

267
0:11:28.725,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And what Boundless Informant tells us

268
0:11:31.696,000 --> 0:11:33,000
is more communications are being intercepted

269
0:11:34.422,000 --> 0:11:36,000
in America about Americans

270
0:11:37.395,000 --> 0:11:4,000
than there are in Russia about Russians.

271
0:11:40.815,000 --> 0:11:41,000
I'm not sure that's what an intelligence agency

272
0:11:42.68,000 --> 0:11:44,000
should be aiming for.

273
0:11:44.999,000 --> 0:11:46,000
CA: Ed, there was a story broken in the Washington Post,

274
0:11:47.405,000 --> 0:11:48,000
again from your data.

275
0:11:49.127,000 --> 0:11:5,000
The headline says,

276
0:11:50.806,000 --> 0:11:51,000
"NSA broke privacy rules

277
0:11:52.303,000 --> 0:11:54,000
thousands of times per year."

278
0:11:54.333,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Tell us about that.

279
0:11:55.871,000 --> 0:11:57,000
ES: We also heard in Congressional testimony last year,

280
0:11:58.464,000 --> 0:11:59,000
it was an amazing thing for someone like me

281
0:12:00.401,000 --> 0:12:01,000
who came from the NSA

282
0:12:02.105,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and who's seen the actual internal documents,

283
0:12:04.677,000 --> 0:12:06,000
knows what's in them,

284
0:12:07.268,000 --> 0:12:09,000
to see officials testifying under oath

285
0:12:09.808,000 --> 0:12:1,000
that there had been no abuses,

286
0:12:11.69,000 --> 0:12:14,000
that there had been no violations of the NSA's rules,

287
0:12:15.323,000 --> 0:12:17,000
when we knew this story was coming.

288
0:12:18.264,000 --> 0:12:2,000
But what's especially interesting about this,

289
0:12:20.352,000 --> 0:12:22,000
about the fact that the NSA has violated

290
0:12:22.4,000 --> 0:12:24,000
their own rules, their own laws

291
0:12:24.768,000 --> 0:12:26,000
thousands of times in a single year,

292
0:12:27.441,000 --> 0:12:29,000
including one event by itself,

293
0:12:30.168,000 --> 0:12:34,000
one event out of those 2,776,

294
0:12:35.144,000 --> 0:12:37,000
that affected more than 3,000 people.

295
0:12:37.45,000 --> 0:12:38,000
In another event, they intercepted

296
0:12:39.289,000 --> 0:12:43,000
all the calls in Washington, D.C., by accident.

297
0:12:43.501,000 --> 0:12:45,000
What's amazing about this,

298
0:12:45.738,000 --> 0:12:47,000
this report, that didn't get that much attention,

299
0:12:47.946,000 --> 0:12:51,000
is the fact that not only were there 2,776 abuses,

300
0:12:52.807,000 --> 0:12:54,000
the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee,

301
0:12:54.948,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Dianne Feinstein, had not seen this report

302
0:12:58.935,000 --> 0:13:01,000
until the Washington Post contacted her

303
0:13:02.126,000 --> 0:13:04,000
asking for comment on the report.

304
0:13:04.574,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And she then requested a copy from the NSA

305
0:13:06.467,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and received it,

306
0:13:08.168,000 --> 0:13:1,000
but had never seen this before that.

307
0:13:10.195,000 --> 0:13:12,000
What does that say about the state of oversight

308
0:13:12.882,000 --> 0:13:13,000
in American intelligence

309
0:13:14.619,000 --> 0:13:15,000
when the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee

310
0:13:16.407,000 --> 0:13:18,000
has no idea that the rules are being broken

311
0:13:19.2,000 --> 0:13:21,000
thousands of times every year?

312
0:13:21.36,000 --> 0:13:24,000
CA: Ed, one response to this whole debate is this:

313
0:13:24.989,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Why should we care about

314
0:13:27.654,000 --> 0:13:28,000
all this surveillance, honestly?

315
0:13:29.122,000 --> 0:13:31,000
I mean, look, if you've done nothing wrong,

316
0:13:31.274,000 --> 0:13:33,000
you've got nothing to worry about.

317
0:13:34.058,000 --> 0:13:36,000
What's wrong with that point of view?

318
0:13:36.35,000 --> 0:13:37,000
ES: Well, so the first thing is,

319
0:13:37.998,000 --> 0:13:38,000
you're giving up your rights.

320
0:13:39.711,000 --> 0:13:4,000
You're saying hey, you know,

321
0:13:41.069,000 --> 0:13:43,000
I don't think I'm going to need them,

322
0:13:43.441,000 --> 0:13:44,000
so I'm just going to trust that, you know,

323
0:13:45.123,000 --> 0:13:47,000
let's get rid of them, it doesn't really matter,

324
0:13:48.101,000 --> 0:13:49,000
these guys are going to do the right thing.

325
0:13:50.075,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Your rights matter

326
0:13:51.934,000 --> 0:13:53,000
because you never know when you're going to need them.

327
0:13:54.776,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Beyond that, it's a part of our cultural identity,

328
0:13:57.058,000 --> 0:13:59,000
not just in America,

329
0:13:59.19,000 --> 0:14:,000
but in Western societies

330
0:14:00.781,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and in democratic societies around the world.

331
0:14:03.743,000 --> 0:14:05,000
People should be able to pick up the phone

332
0:14:06.147,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and to call their family,

333
0:14:07.601,000 --> 0:14:08,000
people should be able to send a text message

334
0:14:09.6,000 --> 0:14:1,000
to their loved ones,

335
0:14:10.728,000 --> 0:14:12,000
people should be able to buy a book online,

336
0:14:13.182,000 --> 0:14:14,000
they should be able to travel by train,

337
0:14:14.972,000 --> 0:14:16,000
they should be able to buy an airline ticket

338
0:14:17.189,000 --> 0:14:18,000
without wondering about how these events

339
0:14:18.926,000 --> 0:14:21,000
are going to look to an agent of the government,

340
0:14:22.611,000 --> 0:14:24,000
possibly not even your government

341
0:14:25.201,000 --> 0:14:26,000
years in the future,

342
0:14:26.956,000 --> 0:14:27,000
how they're going to be misinterpreted

343
0:14:28.696,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and what they're going to think your intentions were.

344
0:14:31.48,000 --> 0:14:33,000
We have a right to privacy.

345
0:14:33.554,000 --> 0:14:36,000
We require warrants to be based on probable cause

346
0:14:37.172,000 --> 0:14:39,000
or some kind of individualized suspicion

347
0:14:39.636,000 --> 0:14:43,000
because we recognize that trusting anybody,

348
0:14:44.163,000 --> 0:14:45,000
any government authority,

349
0:14:45.757,000 --> 0:14:48,000
with the entirety of human communications

350
0:14:48.841,000 --> 0:14:5,000
in secret and without oversight

351
0:14:51.274,000 --> 0:14:55,000
is simply too great a temptation to be ignored.

352
0:14:56.118,000 --> 0:14:58,000
CA: Some people are furious at what you've done.

353
0:14:58.677,000 --> 0:15:,000
I heard a quote recently from Dick Cheney

354
0:15:01.516,000 --> 0:15:06,000
who said that Julian Assange was a flea bite,

355
0:15:07.408,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Edward Snowden is the lion that bit the head off the dog.

356
0:15:10.83,000 --> 0:15:11,000
He thinks you've committed

357
0:15:12.383,000 --> 0:15:14,000
one of the worst acts of betrayal

358
0:15:14.675,000 --> 0:15:16,000
in American history.

359
0:15:16.781,000 --> 0:15:2,000
What would you say to people who think that?

360
0:15:22.975,000 --> 0:15:24,000
ES: Dick Cheney's really something else.

361
0:15:25.18,000 --> 0:15:31,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

362
0:15:32.476,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Thank you. (Laughter)

363
0:15:37.378,000 --> 0:15:39,000
I think it's amazing, because at the time

364
0:15:39.854,000 --> 0:15:42,000
Julian Assange was doing some of his greatest work,

365
0:15:43.629,000 --> 0:15:44,000
Dick Cheney was saying

366
0:15:45.065,000 --> 0:15:47,000
he was going to end governments worldwide,

367
0:15:47.495,000 --> 0:15:49,000
the skies were going to ignite

368
0:15:50.4,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and the seas were going to boil off,

369
0:15:52.536,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and now he's saying it's a flea bite.

370
0:15:54.754,000 --> 0:15:56,000
So we should be suspicious about the same sort of

371
0:15:57.267,000 --> 0:16:01,000
overblown claims of damage to national security

372
0:16:01.46,000 --> 0:16:02,000
from these kind of officials.

373
0:16:03.145,000 --> 0:16:09,000
But let's assume that these people really believe this.

374
0:16:09.994,000 --> 0:16:11,000
I would argue that they have kind of

375
0:16:12.224,000 --> 0:16:16,000
a narrow conception of national security.

376
0:16:16.594,000 --> 0:16:19,000
The prerogatives of people like Dick Cheney

377
0:16:19.841,000 --> 0:16:21,000
do not keep the nation safe.

378
0:16:22.822,000 --> 0:16:26,000
The public interest is not always the same

379
0:16:26.855,000 --> 0:16:28,000
as the national interest.

380
0:16:29.29,000 --> 0:16:32,000
Going to war with people who are not our enemy

381
0:16:33.184,000 --> 0:16:35,000
in places that are not a threat

382
0:16:35.314,000 --> 0:16:37,000
doesn't make us safe,

383
0:16:37.481,000 --> 0:16:39,000
and that applies whether it's in Iraq

384
0:16:39.648,000 --> 0:16:4,000
or on the Internet.

385
0:16:41.415,000 --> 0:16:42,000
The Internet is not the enemy.

386
0:16:42.938,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Our economy is not the enemy.

387
0:16:44.963,000 --> 0:16:46,000
American businesses, Chinese businesses,

388
0:16:47.249,000 --> 0:16:51,000
and any other company out there

389
0:16:51.82,000 --> 0:16:53,000
is a part of our society.

390
0:16:54.251,000 --> 0:16:56,000
It's a part of our interconnected world.

391
0:16:56.465,000 --> 0:17:,000
There are ties of fraternity that bond us together,

392
0:17:00.91,000 --> 0:17:02,000
and if we destroy these bonds

393
0:17:03.578,000 --> 0:17:06,000
by undermining the standards, the security,

394
0:17:06.733,000 --> 0:17:08,000
the manner of behavior,

395
0:17:09.59,000 --> 0:17:11,000
that nations and citizens all around the world

396
0:17:12.541,000 --> 0:17:14,000
expect us to abide by.

397
0:17:14.918,000 --> 0:17:17,000
CA: But it's alleged that you've stolen

398
0:17:18.62,000 --> 0:17:19,000
1.7 million documents.

399
0:17:20.519,000 --> 0:17:21,000
It seems only a few hundred of them

400
0:17:22.346,000 --> 0:17:24,000
have been shared with journalists so far.

401
0:17:25.203,000 --> 0:17:28,000
Are there more revelations to come?

402
0:17:28.248,000 --> 0:17:3,000
ES: There are absolutely more revelations to come.

403
0:17:30.69,000 --> 0:17:32,000
I don't think there's any question

404
0:17:33.491,000 --> 0:17:37,000
that some of the most important reporting

405
0:17:37.738,000 --> 0:17:41,000
to be done is yet to come.

406
0:17:42.478,000 --> 0:17:44,000
CA: Come here, because I want to ask you

407
0:17:44.54,000 --> 0:17:45,000
about this particular revelation.

408
0:17:46.067,000 --> 0:17:49,000
Come and take a look at this.

409
0:17:49.089,000 --> 0:17:52,000
I mean, this is a story which I think for a lot of the techies in this room

410
0:17:52.337,000 --> 0:17:53,000
is the single most shocking thing

411
0:17:54.076,000 --> 0:17:56,000
that they have heard in the last few months.

412
0:17:56.436,000 --> 0:17:58,000
It's about a program called "Bullrun."

413
0:17:59.061,000 --> 0:18:02,000
Can you explain what that is?

414
0:18:02.837,000 --> 0:18:03,000
ES: So Bullrun, and this is again

415
0:18:04.545,000 --> 0:18:11,000
where we've got to thank the NSA for their candor,

416
0:18:11.642,000 --> 0:18:15,000
this is a program named after a Civil War battle.

417
0:18:16.232,000 --> 0:18:17,000
The British counterpart is called Edgehill,

418
0:18:17.845,000 --> 0:18:18,000
which is a U.K. civil war battle.

419
0:18:19.32,000 --> 0:18:21,000
And the reason that I believe they're named this way

420
0:18:21.527,000 --> 0:18:24,000
is because they target our own infrastructure.

421
0:18:25.016,000 --> 0:18:27,000
They're programs through which the NSA

422
0:18:27.707,000 --> 0:18:31,000
intentionally misleads corporate partners.

423
0:18:31.922,000 --> 0:18:32,000
They tell corporate partners that these

424
0:18:33.804,000 --> 0:18:34,000
are safe standards.

425
0:18:35.479,000 --> 0:18:37,000
They say hey, we need to work with you

426
0:18:37.498,000 --> 0:18:4,000
to secure your systems,

427
0:18:41.151,000 --> 0:18:44,000
but in reality, they're giving bad advice

428
0:18:44.344,000 --> 0:18:45,000
to these companies that makes them

429
0:18:45.61,000 --> 0:18:47,000
degrade the security of their services.

430
0:18:47.905,000 --> 0:18:49,000
They're building in backdoors that not only

431
0:18:50.234,000 --> 0:18:52,000
the NSA can exploit,

432
0:18:52.592,000 --> 0:18:54,000
but anyone else who has time and money

433
0:18:55.113,000 --> 0:18:57,000
to research and find it

434
0:18:57.233,000 --> 0:18:59,000
can then use to let themselves in

435
0:18:59.367,000 --> 0:19:,000
to the world's communications.

436
0:19:01.237,000 --> 0:19:02,000
And this is really dangerous,

437
0:19:03.007,000 --> 0:19:07,000
because if we lose a single standard,

438
0:19:07.191,000 --> 0:19:1,000
if we lose the trust of something like SSL,

439
0:19:10.25,000 --> 0:19:11,000
which was specifically targeted

440
0:19:11.732,000 --> 0:19:13,000
by the Bullrun program,

441
0:19:13.855,000 --> 0:19:15,000
we will live a less safe world overall.

442
0:19:16.523,000 --> 0:19:18,000
We won't be able to access our banks

443
0:19:18.63,000 --> 0:19:23,000
and we won't be able to access commerce

444
0:19:23.883,000 --> 0:19:25,000
without worrying about people monitoring those communications

445
0:19:26.706,000 --> 0:19:28,000
or subverting them for their own ends.

446
0:19:28.884,000 --> 0:19:32,000
CA: And do those same decisions also potentially

447
0:19:32.953,000 --> 0:19:34,000
open America up to cyberattacks

448
0:19:35.939,000 --> 0:19:38,000
from other sources?

449
0:19:39.855,000 --> 0:19:4,000
ES: Absolutely.

450
0:19:41.32,000 --> 0:19:42,000
One of the problems,

451
0:19:43.052,000 --> 0:19:46,000
one of the dangerous legacies

452
0:19:46.502,000 --> 0:19:49,000
that we've seen in the post-9/11 era,

453
0:19:49.994,000 --> 0:19:53,000
is that the NSA has traditionally worn two hats.

454
0:19:54.231,000 --> 0:19:55,000
They've been in charge of offensive operations,

455
0:19:56.157,000 --> 0:19:57,000
that is hacking,

456
0:19:57.278,000 --> 0:19:59,000
but they've also been in charge of defensive operations,

457
0:19:59.988,000 --> 0:20:01,000
and traditionally they've always prioritized

458
0:20:02.351,000 --> 0:20:03,000
defense over offense

459
0:20:03.738,000 --> 0:20:04,000
based on the principle

460
0:20:05.128,000 --> 0:20:07,000
that American secrets are simply worth more.

461
0:20:07.944,000 --> 0:20:09,000
If we hack a Chinese business

462
0:20:10.054,000 --> 0:20:11,000
and steal their secrets,

463
0:20:11.738,000 --> 0:20:13,000
if we hack a government office in Berlin

464
0:20:13.821,000 --> 0:20:15,000
and steal their secrets,

465
0:20:15.919,000 --> 0:20:18,000
that has less value to the American people

466
0:20:19.526,000 --> 0:20:21,000
than making sure that the Chinese

467
0:20:21.626,000 --> 0:20:23,000
can't get access to our secrets.

468
0:20:24.132,000 --> 0:20:28,000
So by reducing the security of our communications,

469
0:20:28.263,000 --> 0:20:3,000
they're not only putting the world at risk,

470
0:20:30.291,000 --> 0:20:32,000
they're putting America at risk in a fundamental way,

471
0:20:32.563,000 --> 0:20:34,000
because intellectual property is the basis,

472
0:20:35.234,000 --> 0:20:36,000
the foundation of our economy,

473
0:20:37.161,000 --> 0:20:39,000
and if we put that at risk through weak security,

474
0:20:39.419,000 --> 0:20:4,000
we're going to be paying for it for years.

475
0:20:41.048,000 --> 0:20:42,000
CA: But they've made a calculation

476
0:20:42.595,000 --> 0:20:44,000
that it was worth doing this

477
0:20:44.786,000 --> 0:20:47,000
as part of America's defense against terrorism.

478
0:20:48.325,000 --> 0:20:51,000
Surely that makes it a price worth paying.

479
0:20:51.937,000 --> 0:20:54,000
ES: Well, when you look at the results

480
0:20:55.824,000 --> 0:20:57,000
of these programs in stopping terrorism,

481
0:20:58.131,000 --> 0:21:01,000
you will see that that's unfounded,

482
0:21:01.881,000 --> 0:21:02,000
and you don't have to take my word for it,

483
0:21:03.8,000 --> 0:21:06,000
because we've had the first open court,

484
0:21:07.572,000 --> 0:21:09,000
the first federal court that's reviewed this,

485
0:21:09.941,000 --> 0:21:11,000
outside the secrecy arrangement,

486
0:21:12.737,000 --> 0:21:13,000
called these programs Orwellian

487
0:21:14.724,000 --> 0:21:16,000
and likely unconstitutional.

488
0:21:16.958,000 --> 0:21:18,000
Congress, who has access

489
0:21:19.697,000 --> 0:21:2,000
to be briefed on these things,

490
0:21:21.008,000 --> 0:21:23,000
and now has the desire to be,

491
0:21:23.99,000 --> 0:21:25,000
has produced bills to reform it,

492
0:21:26.397,000 --> 0:21:28,000
and two independent White House panels

493
0:21:29.282,000 --> 0:21:31,000
who reviewed all of the classified evidence

494
0:21:31.372,000 --> 0:21:33,000
said these programs have never stopped

495
0:21:34.005,000 --> 0:21:35,000
a single terrorist attack

496
0:21:35.766,000 --> 0:21:38,000
that was imminent in the United States.

497
0:21:39.269,000 --> 0:21:42,000
So is it really terrorism that we're stopping?

498
0:21:42.455,000 --> 0:21:44,000
Do these programs have any value at all?

499
0:21:44.786,000 --> 0:21:46,000
I say no, and all three branches

500
0:21:47.03,000 --> 0:21:49,000
of the American government say no as well.

501
0:21:49.462,000 --> 0:21:5,000
CA: I mean, do you think there's a deeper motivation

502
0:21:51.275,000 --> 0:21:54,000
for them than the war against terrorism?

503
0:21:54.56,000 --> 0:21:55,000
ES: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you, say again?

504
0:21:56.11,000 --> 0:21:59,000
CA: Sorry. Do you think there's a deeper motivation

505
0:21:59.11,000 --> 0:22:02,000
for them other than the war against terrorism?

506
0:22:02.989,000 --> 0:22:04,000
ES: Yeah. The bottom line is that terrorism

507
0:22:05.684,000 --> 0:22:07,000
has always been what we in the intelligence world

508
0:22:07.885,000 --> 0:22:1,000
would call a cover for action.

509
0:22:11.158,000 --> 0:22:12,000
Terrorism is something that provokes

510
0:22:13.083,000 --> 0:22:15,000
an emotional response that allows people

511
0:22:15.313,000 --> 0:22:19,000
to rationalize authorizing powers and programs

512
0:22:19.67,000 --> 0:22:21,000
that they wouldn't give otherwise.

513
0:22:22.114,000 --> 0:22:24,000
The Bullrun and Edgehill-type programs,

514
0:22:24.6,000 --> 0:22:25,000
the NSA asked for these authorities

515
0:22:26.317,000 --> 0:22:27,000
back in the 1990s.

516
0:22:28.254,000 --> 0:22:3,000
They asked the FBI to go to Congress and make the case.

517
0:22:31.244,000 --> 0:22:33,000
The FBI went to Congress and did make the case.

518
0:22:33.418,000 --> 0:22:35,000
But Congress and the American people said no.

519
0:22:35.983,000 --> 0:22:37,000
They said, it's not worth the risk to our economy.

520
0:22:38.394,000 --> 0:22:39,000
They said it's worth too much damage

521
0:22:40.313,000 --> 0:22:42,000
to our society to justify the gains.

522
0:22:43,000 --> 0:22:47,000
But what we saw is, in the post-9/11 era,

523
0:22:47.275,000 --> 0:22:5,000
they used secrecy and they used the justification of terrorism

524
0:22:50.526,000 --> 0:22:51,000
to start these programs in secret

525
0:22:52.46,000 --> 0:22:53,000
without asking Congress,

526
0:22:54.272,000 --> 0:22:56,000
without asking the American people,

527
0:22:56.452,000 --> 0:22:58,000
and it's that kind of government behind closed doors

528
0:22:59.19,000 --> 0:23:01,000
that we need to guard ourselves against,

529
0:23:01.749,000 --> 0:23:02,000
because it makes us less safe,

530
0:23:02.999,000 --> 0:23:03,000
and it offers no value.

531
0:23:04.891,000 --> 0:23:05,000
CA: Okay, come with me here for a sec,

532
0:23:06.757,000 --> 0:23:08,000
because I've got a more personal question for you.

533
0:23:08.939,000 --> 0:23:1,000
Speaking of terror,

534
0:23:11.863,000 --> 0:23:14,000
most people would find the situation you're in right now

535
0:23:15.82,000 --> 0:23:18,000
in Russia pretty terrifying.

536
0:23:19.116,000 --> 0:23:22,000
You obviously heard what happened,

537
0:23:22.703,000 --> 0:23:24,000
what the treatment that Bradley Manning got,

538
0:23:24.896,000 --> 0:23:26,000
Chelsea Manning as now is,

539
0:23:27.177,000 --> 0:23:29,000
and there was a story in Buzzfeed saying that

540
0:23:29.664,000 --> 0:23:3,000
there are people in the intelligence community

541
0:23:31.322,000 --> 0:23:33,000
who want you dead.

542
0:23:33.601,000 --> 0:23:34,000
How are you coping with this?

543
0:23:35.541,000 --> 0:23:36,000
How are you coping with the fear?

544
0:23:37.49,000 --> 0:23:4,000
ES: It's no mystery

545
0:23:40.494,000 --> 0:23:45,000
that there are governments out there that want to see me dead.

546
0:23:46.142,000 --> 0:23:49,000
I've made clear again and again and again

547
0:23:49.552,000 --> 0:23:52,000
that I go to sleep every morning

548
0:23:52.918,000 --> 0:23:56,000
thinking about what I can do for the American people.

549
0:23:57.478,000 --> 0:24:,000
I don't want to harm my government.

550
0:24:00.51,000 --> 0:24:03,000
I want to help my government,

551
0:24:03.773,000 --> 0:24:06,000
but the fact that they are willing to

552
0:24:07.581,000 --> 0:24:09,000
completely ignore due process,

553
0:24:09.901,000 --> 0:24:11,000
they're willing to declare guilt

554
0:24:12.609,000 --> 0:24:15,000
without ever seeing a trial,

555
0:24:15.895,000 --> 0:24:17,000
these are things that we need to work against

556
0:24:18.311,000 --> 0:24:21,000
as a society, and say hey, this is not appropriate.

557
0:24:21.889,000 --> 0:24:22,000
We shouldn't be threatening dissidents.

558
0:24:23.716,000 --> 0:24:26,000
We shouldn't be criminalizing journalism.

559
0:24:26.73,000 --> 0:24:29,000
And whatever part I can do to see that end,

560
0:24:30.049,000 --> 0:24:33,000
I'm happy to do despite the risks.

561
0:24:33.202,000 --> 0:24:34,000
CA: So I'd actually like to get some feedback

562
0:24:34.726,000 --> 0:24:35,000
from the audience here,

563
0:24:35.945,000 --> 0:24:37,000
because I know there's widely differing reactions

564
0:24:38.049,000 --> 0:24:39,000
to Edward Snowden.

565
0:24:39.99,000 --> 0:24:41,000
Suppose you had the following two choices, right?

566
0:24:42.278,000 --> 0:24:44,000
You could view what he did

567
0:24:45.084,000 --> 0:24:46,000
as fundamentally a reckless act

568
0:24:46.978,000 --> 0:24:49,000
that has endangered America

569
0:24:50.197,000 --> 0:24:53,000
or you could view it as fundamentally a heroic act

570
0:24:53.76,000 --> 0:24:56,000
that will work towards America and the world's

571
0:24:57.235,000 --> 0:24:58,000
long-term good?

572
0:24:58.622,000 --> 0:25:01,000
Those are the two choices I'll give you.

573
0:25:01.94,000 --> 0:25:03,000
I'm curious to see who's willing to vote with

574
0:25:04.095,000 --> 0:25:05,000
the first of those,

575
0:25:05.512,000 --> 0:25:08,000
that this was a reckless act?

576
0:25:08.921,000 --> 0:25:09,000
There are some hands going up.

577
0:25:10.576,000 --> 0:25:11,000
Some hands going up.

578
0:25:11.96,000 --> 0:25:12,000
It's hard to put your hand up

579
0:25:13.236,000 --> 0:25:15,000
when the man is standing right here,

580
0:25:15.347,000 --> 0:25:16,000
but I see them.

581
0:25:16.912,000 --> 0:25:18,000
ES: I can see you. (Laughter)

582
0:25:19.443,000 --> 0:25:21,000
CA: And who goes with the second choice,

583
0:25:21.704,000 --> 0:25:22,000
the fundamentally heroic act?

584
0:25:23.587,000 --> 0:25:25,000
(Applause) (Cheers)

585
0:25:26.234,000 --> 0:25:28,000
And I think it's true to say that there are a lot of people

586
0:25:28.808,000 --> 0:25:3,000
who didn't show a hand and I think

587
0:25:31.033,000 --> 0:25:32,000
are still thinking this through,

588
0:25:32.743,000 --> 0:25:35,000
because it seems to me that the debate around you

589
0:25:36.201,000 --> 0:25:39,000
doesn't split along traditional political lines.

590
0:25:39.31,000 --> 0:25:41,000
It's not left or right, it's not really about

591
0:25:41.564,000 --> 0:25:45,000
pro-government, libertarian, or not just that.

592
0:25:45.686,000 --> 0:25:47,000
Part of it is almost a generational issue.

593
0:25:48.399,000 --> 0:25:49,000
You're part of a generation that grew up

594
0:25:50.207,000 --> 0:25:52,000
with the Internet, and it seems as if

595
0:25:53.133,000 --> 0:25:56,000
you become offended at almost a visceral level

596
0:25:56.341,000 --> 0:25:57,000
when you see something done

597
0:25:57.637,000 --> 0:25:59,000
that you think will harm the Internet.

598
0:25:59.699,000 --> 0:26:02,000
Is there some truth to that?

599
0:26:03.272,000 --> 0:26:08,000
ES: It is. I think it's very true.

600
0:26:08.32,000 --> 0:26:11,000
This is not a left or right issue.

601
0:26:11.418,000 --> 0:26:13,000
Our basic freedoms, and when I say our,

602
0:26:13.995,000 --> 0:26:14,000
I don't just mean Americans,

603
0:26:15.542,000 --> 0:26:17,000
I mean people around the world,

604
0:26:17.555,000 --> 0:26:19,000
it's not a partisan issue.

605
0:26:19.901,000 --> 0:26:21,000
These are things that all people believe,

606
0:26:21.94,000 --> 0:26:23,000
and it's up to all of us to protect them,

607
0:26:24.465,000 --> 0:26:26,000
and to people who have seen and enjoyed

608
0:26:27.297,000 --> 0:26:28,000
a free and open Internet,

609
0:26:28.958,000 --> 0:26:31,000
it's up to us to preserve that liberty

610
0:26:32.184,000 --> 0:26:33,000
for the next generation to enjoy,

611
0:26:34.089,000 --> 0:26:35,000
and if we don't change things,

612
0:26:35.954,000 --> 0:26:38,000
if we don't stand up to make the changes

613
0:26:39.087,000 --> 0:26:42,000
we need to do to keep the Internet safe,

614
0:26:42.294,000 --> 0:26:44,000
not just for us but for everyone,

615
0:26:45.062,000 --> 0:26:46,000
we're going to lose that,

616
0:26:46.527,000 --> 0:26:47,000
and that would be a tremendous loss,

617
0:26:47.78,000 --> 0:26:49,000
not just for us, but for the world.

618
0:26:50.127,000 --> 0:26:52,000
CA: Well, I have heard similar language recently

619
0:26:52.2,000 --> 0:26:53,000
from the founder of the world wide web,

620
0:26:54.048,000 --> 0:26:58,000
who I actually think is with us, Sir Tim Berners-Lee.

621
0:26:58.565,000 --> 0:27:,000
Tim, actually, would you like to come up and say,

622
0:27:01.269,000 --> 0:27:02,000
do we have a microphone for Tim?

623
0:27:03.14,000 --> 0:27:05,000
(Applause)

624
0:27:05.507,000 --> 0:27:12,000
Tim, good to see you. Come up there.

625
0:27:12.582,000 --> 0:27:14,000
Which camp are you in, by the way,

626
0:27:15.019,000 --> 0:27:18,000
traitor, hero? I have a theory on this, but --

627
0:27:18.519,000 --> 0:27:2,000
Tim Berners-Lee: I've given much longer

628
0:27:21.213,000 --> 0:27:24,000
answers to that question, but hero,

629
0:27:24.268,000 --> 0:27:27,000
if I have to make the choice between the two.

630
0:27:27.67,000 --> 0:27:3,000
CA: And Ed, I think you've read

631
0:27:31.003,000 --> 0:27:33,000
the proposal that Sir Tim has talked about

632
0:27:33.087,000 --> 0:27:35,000
about a new Magna Carta to take back the Internet.

633
0:27:36.055,000 --> 0:27:38,000
Is that something that makes sense?

634
0:27:38.157,000 --> 0:27:41,000
ES: Absolutely. I mean, my generation, I grew up

635
0:27:41.798,000 --> 0:27:43,000
not just thinking about the Internet,

636
0:27:43.857,000 --> 0:27:45,000
but I grew up in the Internet,

637
0:27:46.221,000 --> 0:27:5,000
and although I never expected to have the chance

638
0:27:50.881,000 --> 0:27:55,000
to defend it in such a direct and practical manner

639
0:27:56.428,000 --> 0:27:59,000
and to embody it in this unusual,

640
0:28:00.224,000 --> 0:28:02,000
almost avatar manner,

641
0:28:02.353,000 --> 0:28:04,000
I think there's something poetic about the fact that

642
0:28:05.059,000 --> 0:28:06,000
one of the sons of the Internet

643
0:28:07.041,000 --> 0:28:1,000
has actually become close to the Internet

644
0:28:10.093,000 --> 0:28:12,000
as a result of their political expression.

645
0:28:12.579,000 --> 0:28:15,000
And I believe that a Magna Carta for the Internet

646
0:28:16.29,000 --> 0:28:17,000
is exactly what we need.

647
0:28:18.252,000 --> 0:28:21,000
We need to encode our values

648
0:28:21.76,000 --> 0:28:24,000
not just in writing but in the structure of the Internet,

649
0:28:25.107,000 --> 0:28:27,000
and it's something that I hope,

650
0:28:27.347,000 --> 0:28:29,000
I invite everyone in the audience,

651
0:28:29.87,000 --> 0:28:32,000
not just here in Vancouver but around the world,

652
0:28:33.12,000 --> 0:28:35,000
to join and participate in.

653
0:28:35.476,000 --> 0:28:37,000
CA: Do you have a question for Ed?

654
0:28:37.79,000 --> 0:28:39,000
TBL: Well, two questions,

655
0:28:39.82,000 --> 0:28:4,000
a general question —

656
0:28:40.944,000 --> 0:28:41,000
CA: Ed, can you still hear us?

657
0:28:42.739,000 --> 0:28:45,000
ES: Yes, I can hear you. CA: Oh, he's back.

658
0:28:46.255,000 --> 0:28:47,000
TBL: The wiretap on your line

659
0:28:47.85,000 --> 0:28:48,000
got a little interfered with for a moment.

660
0:28:49.756,000 --> 0:28:5,000
(Laughter)

661
0:28:51.409,000 --> 0:28:53,000
ES: It's a little bit of an NSA problem.

662
0:28:53.611,000 --> 0:28:56,000
TBL: So, from the 25 years,

663
0:28:57.418,000 --> 0:28:59,000
stepping back and thinking,

664
0:29:00.355,000 --> 0:29:01,000
what would you think would be

665
0:29:02.101,000 --> 0:29:04,000
the best that we could achieve

666
0:29:04.708,000 --> 0:29:05,000
from all the discussions that we have

667
0:29:06.568,000 --> 0:29:08,000
about the web we want?

668
0:29:09.461,000 --> 0:29:12,000
ES: When we think about

669
0:29:12.833,000 --> 0:29:15,000
in terms of how far we can go,

670
0:29:15.946,000 --> 0:29:17,000
I think that's a question that's really only limited

671
0:29:18.099,000 --> 0:29:2,000
by what we're willing to put into it.

672
0:29:20.636,000 --> 0:29:22,000
I think the Internet that we've enjoyed in the past

673
0:29:23.593,000 --> 0:29:28,000
has been exactly what we as not just a nation

674
0:29:29.151,000 --> 0:29:32,000
but as a people around the world need,

675
0:29:32.49,000 --> 0:29:36,000
and by cooperating, by engaging not just

676
0:29:36.716,000 --> 0:29:37,000
the technical parts of society,

677
0:29:38.12,000 --> 0:29:4,000
but as you said, the users,

678
0:29:40.962,000 --> 0:29:42,000
the people around the world who contribute

679
0:29:43.026,000 --> 0:29:45,000
through the Internet, through social media,

680
0:29:45.468,000 --> 0:29:46,000
who just check the weather,

681
0:29:47.195,000 --> 0:29:49,000
who rely on it every day as a part of their life,

682
0:29:49.748,000 --> 0:29:51,000
to champion that.

683
0:29:52.688,000 --> 0:29:54,000
We'll get not just the Internet we've had,

684
0:29:55.225,000 --> 0:29:57,000
but a better Internet, a better now,

685
0:29:58.174,000 --> 0:30:02,000
something that we can use to build a future

686
0:30:02.217,000 --> 0:30:04,000
that'll be better not just than what we hoped for

687
0:30:05.185,000 --> 0:30:07,000
but anything that we could have imagined.

688
0:30:07.57,000 --> 0:30:12,000
CA: It's 30 years ago that TED was founded, 1984.

689
0:30:13.032,000 --> 0:30:15,000
A lot of the conversation since then has been

690
0:30:15.037,000 --> 0:30:17,000
along the lines that

691
0:30:17.091,000 --> 0:30:18,000
actually George Orwell got it wrong.

692
0:30:18.994,000 --> 0:30:19,000
It's not Big Brother watching us.

693
0:30:20.713,000 --> 0:30:21,000
We, through the power of the web,

694
0:30:22.327,000 --> 0:30:24,000
and transparency, are now watching Big Brother.

695
0:30:24.691,000 --> 0:30:26,000
Your revelations kind of drove a stake

696
0:30:26.952,000 --> 0:30:29,000
through the heart of that rather optimistic view,

697
0:30:30.699,000 --> 0:30:33,000
but you still believe there's a way of doing something

698
0:30:34.119,000 --> 0:30:35,000
about that.

699
0:30:35.988,000 --> 0:30:36,000
And you do too.

700
0:30:37.728,000 --> 0:30:43,000
ES: Right, so there is an argument to be made

701
0:30:43.896,000 --> 0:30:46,000
that the powers of Big Brother have increased enormously.

702
0:30:47.493,000 --> 0:30:51,000
There was a recent legal article at Yale

703
0:30:51.822,000 --> 0:30:54,000
that established something called the Bankston-Soltani Principle,

704
0:30:55.553,000 --> 0:31:,000
which is that our expectation of privacy is violated

705
0:31:00.782,000 --> 0:31:01,000
when the capabilities of government surveillance

706
0:31:02.651,000 --> 0:31:05,000
have become cheaper by an order of magnitude,

707
0:31:05.846,000 --> 0:31:07,000
and each time that occurs, we need to revisit

708
0:31:08.568,000 --> 0:31:11,000
and rebalance our privacy rights.

709
0:31:11.621,000 --> 0:31:12,000
Now, that hasn't happened since

710
0:31:13.611,000 --> 0:31:15,000
the government's surveillance powers

711
0:31:15.709,000 --> 0:31:17,000
have increased by several orders of magnitude,

712
0:31:18.489,000 --> 0:31:2,000
and that's why we're in the problem that we're in today,

713
0:31:21.463,000 --> 0:31:24,000
but there is still hope,

714
0:31:25.275,000 --> 0:31:27,000
because the power of individuals

715
0:31:27.411,000 --> 0:31:29,000
have also been increased by technology.

716
0:31:30.018,000 --> 0:31:32,000
I am living proof

717
0:31:32.019,000 --> 0:31:34,000
that an individual can go head to head

718
0:31:34.181,000 --> 0:31:36,000
against the most powerful adversaries

719
0:31:36.499,000 --> 0:31:38,000
and the most powerful intelligence agencies

720
0:31:38.82,000 --> 0:31:41,000
around the world and win,

721
0:31:42.58,000 --> 0:31:43,000
and I think that's something

722
0:31:44.24,000 --> 0:31:46,000
that we need to take hope from,

723
0:31:46.663,000 --> 0:31:47,000
and we need to build on

724
0:31:47.84,000 --> 0:31:49,000
to make it accessible not just to technical experts

725
0:31:50.277,000 --> 0:31:52,000
but to ordinary citizens around the world.

726
0:31:52.794,000 --> 0:31:53,000
Journalism is not a crime,

727
0:31:54.461,000 --> 0:31:55,000
communication is not a crime,

728
0:31:56.251,000 --> 0:31:58,000
and we should not be monitored in our everyday activities.

729
0:31:59.195,000 --> 0:32:01,000
CA: I'm not quite sure how you shake the hand of a bot,

730
0:32:01.924,000 --> 0:32:06,000
but I imagine it's, this is the hand right here. TBL: That'll come very soon.

731
0:32:07.814,000 --> 0:32:08,000
ES: Nice to meet you,

732
0:32:08.937,000 --> 0:32:1,000
and I hope my beam looks as nice

733
0:32:10.984,000 --> 0:32:12,000
as my view of you guys does.

734
0:32:13.328,000 --> 0:32:15,000
CA: Thank you, Tim.

735
0:32:16.048,000 --> 0:32:21,000
(Applause)

736
0:32:21.78,000 --> 0:32:25,000
I mean, The New York Times recently called for an amnesty for you.

737
0:32:25.832,000 --> 0:32:29,000
Would you welcome the chance to come back to America?

738
0:32:30.058,000 --> 0:32:33,000
ES: Absolutely. There's really no question,

739
0:32:33.943,000 --> 0:32:35,000
the principles that have been the foundation

740
0:32:36.525,000 --> 0:32:38,000
of this project

741
0:32:38.918,000 --> 0:32:42,000
have been the public interest

742
0:32:42.998,000 --> 0:32:44,000
and the principles that underly

743
0:32:45.941,000 --> 0:32:48,000
the journalistic establishment in the United States

744
0:32:49.217,000 --> 0:32:51,000
and around the world,

745
0:32:51.663,000 --> 0:32:55,000
and I think if the press is now saying,

746
0:32:56.508,000 --> 0:32:58,000
we support this,

747
0:32:58.59,000 --> 0:33:,000
this is something that needed to happen,

748
0:33:00.678,000 --> 0:33:02,000
that's a powerful argument, but it's not the final argument,

749
0:33:03.322,000 --> 0:33:05,000
and I think that's something that public should decide.

750
0:33:06.035,000 --> 0:33:07,000
But at the same time,

751
0:33:07.877,000 --> 0:33:08,000
the government has hinted that they want

752
0:33:09.423,000 --> 0:33:1,000
some kind of deal,

753
0:33:11.267,000 --> 0:33:13,000
that they want me to compromise

754
0:33:13.381,000 --> 0:33:15,000
the journalists with which I've been working,

755
0:33:15.556,000 --> 0:33:16,000
to come back,

756
0:33:16.989,000 --> 0:33:18,000
and I want to make it very clear

757
0:33:19.542,000 --> 0:33:21,000
that I did not do this to be safe.

758
0:33:22.268,000 --> 0:33:24,000
I did this to do what was right,

759
0:33:24.536,000 --> 0:33:26,000
and I'm not going to stop my work

760
0:33:26.763,000 --> 0:33:27,000
in the public interest

761
0:33:28.137,000 --> 0:33:3,000
just to benefit myself.

762
0:33:30.926,000 --> 0:33:35,000
(Applause)

763
0:33:36.704,000 --> 0:33:37,000
CA: In the meantime,

764
0:33:38.623,000 --> 0:33:41,000
courtesy of the Internet and this technology,

765
0:33:42.391,000 --> 0:33:43,000
you're here, back in North America,

766
0:33:44.041,000 --> 0:33:48,000
not quite the U.S., Canada, in this form.

767
0:33:48.057,000 --> 0:33:52,000
I'm curious, how does that feel?

768
0:33:52.951,000 --> 0:33:54,000
ES: Canada is different than what I expected.

769
0:33:55.089,000 --> 0:33:57,000
It's a lot warmer.

770
0:33:57.214,000 --> 0:34:02,000
(Laughter)

771
0:34:02.921,000 --> 0:34:05,000
CA: At TED, the mission is "ideas worth spreading."

772
0:34:06.177,000 --> 0:34:08,000
If you could encapsulate it in a single idea,

773
0:34:08.375,000 --> 0:34:1,000
what is your idea worth spreading

774
0:34:10.59,000 --> 0:34:14,000
right now at this moment?

775
0:34:14.665,000 --> 0:34:17,000
ES: I would say the last year has been a reminder

776
0:34:18.315,000 --> 0:34:21,000
that democracy may die behind closed doors,

777
0:34:21.918,000 --> 0:34:22,000
but we as individuals are born

778
0:34:23.822,000 --> 0:34:25,000
behind those same closed doors,

779
0:34:26.471,000 --> 0:34:28,000
and we don't have to give up

780
0:34:28.836,000 --> 0:34:31,000
our privacy to have good government.

781
0:34:32.069,000 --> 0:34:34,000
We don't have to give up our liberty

782
0:34:34.159,000 --> 0:34:35,000
to have security.

783
0:34:35.938,000 --> 0:34:37,000
And I think by working together

784
0:34:38.726,000 --> 0:34:4,000
we can have both open government

785
0:34:41.051,000 --> 0:34:42,000
and private lives,

786
0:34:42.988,000 --> 0:34:43,000
and I look forward to working with everyone

787
0:34:44.761,000 --> 0:34:46,000
around the world to see that happen.

788
0:34:47.3,000 --> 0:34:48,000
Thank you very much.

789
0:34:48.638,000 --> 0:34:5,000
CA: Ed, thank you.

790
0:34:50.878,000 --> 0:34:58,000

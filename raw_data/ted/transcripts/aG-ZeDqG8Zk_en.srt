1
0:00:12.685,000 --> 0:00:15,000
The urban explosion

2
0:00:15.727,000 --> 0:00:19,000
of the last years of economic boom

3
0:00:19.952,000 --> 0:00:22,000
also produced dramatic marginalization,

4
0:00:23.463,000 --> 0:00:25,000
resulting in the explosion of slums

5
0:00:25.737,000 --> 0:00:27,000
in many parts of the world.

6
0:00:28.352,000 --> 0:00:31,000
This polarization of enclaves of mega-wealth

7
0:00:31.599,000 --> 0:00:33,000
surrounded by sectors of poverty

8
0:00:34.434,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and the socioeconomic inequalities they have engendered

9
0:00:37.816,000 --> 0:00:4,000
is really at the center of today's urban crisis.

10
0:00:41.378,000 --> 0:00:43,000
But I want to begin tonight

11
0:00:43.736,000 --> 0:00:45,000
by suggesting that this urban crisis

12
0:00:46.174,000 --> 0:00:49,000
is not only economic or environmental.

13
0:00:50.054,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It's particularly a cultural crisis,

14
0:00:52.952,000 --> 0:00:54,000
a crisis of the institutions

15
0:00:55.837,000 --> 0:00:58,000
unable to reimagine the stupid ways

16
0:00:59.573,000 --> 0:01:01,000
which we have been growing,

17
0:01:01.997,000 --> 0:01:04,000
unable to challenge the oil-hungry,

18
0:01:05.31,000 --> 0:01:08,000
selfish urbanization that have perpetuated

19
0:01:09.067,000 --> 0:01:11,000
cities based on consumption,

20
0:01:11.529,000 --> 0:01:16,000
from southern California to New York to Dubai.

21
0:01:16.96,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So I just really want to share with you a reflection

22
0:01:20.958,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that the future of cities today

23
0:01:23.298,000 --> 0:01:25,000
depends less on buildings

24
0:01:25.989,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and, in fact, depends more

25
0:01:28.404,000 --> 0:01:32,000
on the fundamental reorganization of socioeconomic relations,

26
0:01:33.154,000 --> 0:01:35,000
that the best ideas in the shaping

27
0:01:35.158,000 --> 0:01:36,000
of the city in the future

28
0:01:36.988,000 --> 0:01:4,000
will not come from enclaves of economic power

29
0:01:41.037,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and abundance,

30
0:01:42.415,000 --> 0:01:47,000
but in fact from sectors of conflict and scarcity

31
0:01:48.046,000 --> 0:01:5,000
from which an urgent imagination

32
0:01:50.886,000 --> 0:01:54,000
can really inspire us to rethink urban growth today.

33
0:01:54.91,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And let me illustrate what I mean

34
0:01:58.49,000 --> 0:02:01,000
by understanding or engaging sites of conflict

35
0:02:02.395,000 --> 0:02:06,000
as harboring creativity, as I briefly introduce you

36
0:02:06.476,000 --> 0:02:08,000
to the Tijuana-San Diego border region,

37
0:02:09.009,000 --> 0:02:13,000
which has been the laboratory to rethink my practice as an architect.

38
0:02:13.214,000 --> 0:02:15,000
This is the wall, the border wall,

39
0:02:15.726,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that separates San Diego and Tijuana,

40
0:02:18.237,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Latin America and the United States,

41
0:02:21.078,000 --> 0:02:23,000
a physical emblem

42
0:02:23.115,000 --> 0:02:25,000
of exclusionary planning policies

43
0:02:25.765,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that have perpetuated the division

44
0:02:28.276,000 --> 0:02:3,000
of communities, jurisdictions

45
0:02:30.709,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and resources across the world.

46
0:02:33.844,000 --> 0:02:35,000
In this border region, we find

47
0:02:36.547,000 --> 0:02:38,000
some of the wealthiest real estate,

48
0:02:38.964,000 --> 0:02:4,000
as I once found in the edges of San Diego,

49
0:02:41.431,000 --> 0:02:43,000
barely 20 minutes away

50
0:02:43.655,000 --> 0:02:47,000
from some of the poorest settlements in Latin America.

51
0:02:47.781,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And while these two cities have the same population,

52
0:02:51.144,000 --> 0:02:54,000
San Diego has grown six times larger than Tijuana

53
0:02:54.98,000 --> 0:02:55,000
in the last decades,

54
0:02:56.742,000 --> 0:02:59,000
immediately thrusting us to confront

55
0:03:00.132,000 --> 0:03:02,000
the tensions and conflicts

56
0:03:02.179,000 --> 0:03:03,000
between sprawl and density,

57
0:03:03.927,000 --> 0:03:04,000
which are at the center of today's discussion

58
0:03:05.918,000 --> 0:03:07,000
about environmental sustainability.

59
0:03:08.746,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So I've been arguing in the last years

60
0:03:11.478,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that, in fact, the slums of Tijuana can teach a lot

61
0:03:15.183,000 --> 0:03:16,000
to the sprawls of San Diego

62
0:03:16.844,000 --> 0:03:19,000
when it comes to socioeconomic sustainability,

63
0:03:20.374,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that we should pay attention and learn

64
0:03:22.793,000 --> 0:03:24,000
from the many migrant communities

65
0:03:25.106,000 --> 0:03:27,000
on both sides of this border wall

66
0:03:27.621,000 --> 0:03:3,000
so that we can translate their informal processes

67
0:03:30.958,000 --> 0:03:32,000
of urbanization.

68
0:03:33.017,000 --> 0:03:36,000
What do I mean by the informal in this case?

69
0:03:36.139,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I'm really just talking about

70
0:03:37.967,000 --> 0:03:4,000
the compendium of social practices of adaptation

71
0:03:41.623,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that enable many of these migrant communities

72
0:03:44.462,000 --> 0:03:48,000
to transgress imposed political and economic recipes

73
0:03:49.016,000 --> 0:03:5,000
of urbanization.

74
0:03:50.569,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I'm talking simply about the creative intelligence

75
0:03:53.819,000 --> 0:03:55,000
of the bottom-up,

76
0:03:56.194,000 --> 0:03:59,000
whether manifested in the slums of Tijuana

77
0:03:59.391,000 --> 0:04:02,000
that build themselves, in fact, with the waste of San Diego,

78
0:04:03.135,000 --> 0:04:05,000
or the many migrant neighborhoods in Southern California

79
0:04:05.893,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that have begun to be retrofitted with difference

80
0:04:08.969,000 --> 0:04:09,000
in the last decades.

81
0:04:10.626,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So I've been interested as an artist

82
0:04:12.834,000 --> 0:04:14,000
in the measuring, the observation,

83
0:04:15.418,000 --> 0:04:17,000
of many of the trans-border informal flows

84
0:04:17.69,000 --> 0:04:18,000
across this border:

85
0:04:19.38,000 --> 0:04:21,000
in one direction, from south to north,

86
0:04:21.817,000 --> 0:04:23,000
the flow of immigrants into the United States,

87
0:04:24.41,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and from north to south the flow of waste

88
0:04:27.419,000 --> 0:04:3,000
from southern California into Tijuana.

89
0:04:30.45,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I'm referring to the recycling

90
0:04:32.718,000 --> 0:04:35,000
of these old post-war bungalows

91
0:04:36.17,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that Mexican contractors bring to the border

92
0:04:39.629,000 --> 0:04:41,000
as American developers are disposing of them

93
0:04:42.474,000 --> 0:04:44,000
in the process of building a more inflated version

94
0:04:45.042,000 --> 0:04:47,000
of suburbia in the last decades.

95
0:04:47.118,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So these are houses waiting to cross the border.

96
0:04:50.033,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Not only people cross the border here,

97
0:04:52.385,000 --> 0:04:55,000
but entire chunks of one city move to the next,

98
0:04:55.652,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and when these houses are placed on top of these steel frames,

99
0:04:59.546,000 --> 0:05:01,000
they leave the first floor to become the second

100
0:05:02.123,000 --> 0:05:04,000
to be in-filled with more house,

101
0:05:04.177,000 --> 0:05:05,000
with a small business.

102
0:05:05.835,000 --> 0:05:07,000
This layering of spaces and economies

103
0:05:08.712,000 --> 0:05:1,000
is very interesting to notice.

104
0:05:10.994,000 --> 0:05:12,000
But not only houses, also small debris

105
0:05:13.509,000 --> 0:05:15,000
from one city, from San Diego, to Tijuana.

106
0:05:15.856,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Probably a lot of you have seen the rubber tires

107
0:05:18.242,000 --> 0:05:2,000
that are used in the slums to build retaining walls.

108
0:05:20.871,000 --> 0:05:22,000
But look at what people have done here in conditions

109
0:05:23.224,000 --> 0:05:25,000
of socioeconomic emergency.

110
0:05:25.452,000 --> 0:05:28,000
They have figured out how to peel off the tire,

111
0:05:28.613,000 --> 0:05:3,000
how to thread it and interlock it

112
0:05:30.978,000 --> 0:05:34,000
to construct a more efficient retaining wall.

113
0:05:35.106,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Or the garage doors that are brought

114
0:05:38.318,000 --> 0:05:4,000
from San Diego in trucks

115
0:05:40.826,000 --> 0:05:44,000
to become the new skin of emergency housing

116
0:05:45.555,000 --> 0:05:46,000
in many of these slums

117
0:05:47.394,000 --> 0:05:49,000
surrounding the edges of Tijuana.

118
0:05:49.724,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So while, as an architect,

119
0:05:51.14,000 --> 0:05:52,000
this is a very compelling thing to witness,

120
0:05:53.067,000 --> 0:05:54,000
this creative intelligence,

121
0:05:54.761,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I also want to keep myself in check.

122
0:05:56.774,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I don't want to romanticize poverty.

123
0:05:58.81,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I just want to suggest

124
0:06:00.801,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that this informal urbanization

125
0:06:02.942,000 --> 0:06:05,000
is not just the image of precariousness,

126
0:06:06.541,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that informality here, the informal,

127
0:06:09.623,000 --> 0:06:13,000
is really a set of socioeconomic and political procedures

128
0:06:14.153,000 --> 0:06:16,000
that we could translate as artists,

129
0:06:16.862,000 --> 0:06:18,000
that this is about a bottom-up urbanization

130
0:06:19.207,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that performs.

131
0:06:20.732,000 --> 0:06:22,000
See here, buildings are not important

132
0:06:23.558,000 --> 0:06:24,000
just for their looks,

133
0:06:25.521,000 --> 0:06:28,000
but, in fact, they are important for what they can do.

134
0:06:28.962,000 --> 0:06:31,000
They truly perform as they transform through time

135
0:06:32.076,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and as communities negotiate

136
0:06:34.224,000 --> 0:06:37,000
the spaces and boundaries and resources.

137
0:06:37.733,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So while waste flows southbound,

138
0:06:40.854,000 --> 0:06:42,000
people go north in search of dollars,

139
0:06:43.382,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and most of my research has had to do

140
0:06:45.917,000 --> 0:06:48,000
with the impact of immigration

141
0:06:49.812,000 --> 0:06:51,000
in the alteration of the homogeneity

142
0:06:52.286,000 --> 0:06:54,000
of many neighborhoods in the United States,

143
0:06:54.612,000 --> 0:06:55,000
particularly in San Diego.

144
0:06:56.576,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And I'm talking about how this begins to suggest

145
0:06:58.961,000 --> 0:07:,000
that the future of Southern California

146
0:07:01.614,000 --> 0:07:03,000
depends on the retrofitting

147
0:07:04.137,000 --> 0:07:07,000
of the large urbanization -- I mean, on steroids --

148
0:07:07.344,000 --> 0:07:09,000
with the small programs,

149
0:07:09.832,000 --> 0:07:1,000
social and economic.

150
0:07:11.608,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I'm referring to how immigrants,

151
0:07:13.713,000 --> 0:07:14,000
when they come to these neighborhoods,

152
0:07:15.511,000 --> 0:07:18,000
they begin to alter the one-dimensionality

153
0:07:18.562,000 --> 0:07:19,000
of parcels and properties

154
0:07:20.544,000 --> 0:07:24,000
into more socially and economically complex systems,

155
0:07:24.931,000 --> 0:07:27,000
as they begin to plug an informal economy into a garage,

156
0:07:28.668,000 --> 0:07:3,000
or as they build an illegal granny flat

157
0:07:30.982,000 --> 0:07:32,000
to support an extended family.

158
0:07:33.484,000 --> 0:07:38,000
This socioeconomic entrepreneurship

159
0:07:38.559,000 --> 0:07:41,000
on the ground within these neighborhoods

160
0:07:41.662,000 --> 0:07:44,000
really begins to suggest ways of translating that

161
0:07:45.208,000 --> 0:07:49,000
into new, inclusive and more equitable

162
0:07:49.355,000 --> 0:07:51,000
land use policies.

163
0:07:51.394,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So many stories emerge from these dynamics

164
0:07:54.125,000 --> 0:07:56,000
of alteration of space,

165
0:07:56.986,000 --> 0:07:57,000
such as &quot;the informal Buddha,&quot;

166
0:07:58.834,000 --> 0:08:,000
which tells the story of a small house

167
0:08:01.407,000 --> 0:08:04,000
that saved itself, it did not travel to Mexico,

168
0:08:04.408,000 --> 0:08:06,000
but it was retrofitted in the end

169
0:08:06.412,000 --> 0:08:08,000
into a Buddhist temple,

170
0:08:08.662,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and in so doing,

171
0:08:09.891,000 --> 0:08:12,000
this small house transforms or mutates

172
0:08:13.147,000 --> 0:08:14,000
from a singular dwelling

173
0:08:14.845,000 --> 0:08:16,000
into a small, or a micro, socioeconomic

174
0:08:17.667,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and cultural infrastructure inside a neighborhood.

175
0:08:21.623,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So these action neighborhoods, as I call them,

176
0:08:24.37,000 --> 0:08:26,000
really become the inspiration

177
0:08:26.398,000 --> 0:08:29,000
to imagine other interpretations of citizenship

178
0:08:29.794,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that have less to do, in fact,

179
0:08:31.974,000 --> 0:08:32,000
with belonging to the nation-state,

180
0:08:33.956,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and more with upholding the notion of citizenship

181
0:08:37.802,000 --> 0:08:38,000
as a creative act

182
0:08:39.696,000 --> 0:08:41,000
that reorganizes institutional protocols

183
0:08:42.547,000 --> 0:08:44,000
in the spaces of the city.

184
0:08:44.877,000 --> 0:08:46,000
As an artist, I've been interested, in fact,

185
0:08:47.732,000 --> 0:08:49,000
in the visualization of citizenship,

186
0:08:50.461,000 --> 0:08:53,000
the gathering of many anecdotes, urban stories,

187
0:08:54.026,000 --> 0:08:57,000
in order to narrativize the relationship

188
0:08:57.094,000 --> 0:09:,000
between social processes and spaces.

189
0:09:00.224,000 --> 0:09:03,000
This is a story of a group of teenagers

190
0:09:03.343,000 --> 0:09:05,000
that one night, a few months ago,

191
0:09:06.266,000 --> 0:09:08,000
decided to invade this space under the freeway

192
0:09:09.198,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to begin constructing their own skateboard park.

193
0:09:12.412,000 --> 0:09:15,000
With shovels in hand, they started to dig.

194
0:09:15.553,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Two weeks later, the police stopped them.

195
0:09:18.41,000 --> 0:09:19,000
They barricaded the place,

196
0:09:20.111,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and the teenagers were evicted,

197
0:09:22.063,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and the teenagers decided to fight back,

198
0:09:24.776,000 --> 0:09:26,000
not with bank cards or slogans

199
0:09:27.243,000 --> 0:09:29,000
but with constructing a critical process.

200
0:09:29.996,000 --> 0:09:31,000
The first thing they did was to recognize

201
0:09:32.711,000 --> 0:09:34,000
the specificity of political jurisdiction

202
0:09:35.691,000 --> 0:09:37,000
inscribed in that empty space.

203
0:09:38.418,000 --> 0:09:4,000
They found out that they had been lucky

204
0:09:40.496,000 --> 0:09:41,000
because they had not begun to dig

205
0:09:42.31,000 --> 0:09:44,000
under Caltrans territoy.

206
0:09:44.693,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Caltrans is a state agency that governs the freeway,

207
0:09:47.925,000 --> 0:09:49,000
so it would have been very difficult to negotiate with them.

208
0:09:50.49,000 --> 0:09:51,000
They were lucky, they said, because they began

209
0:09:52.37,000 --> 0:09:54,000
to dig under an arm of the freeway

210
0:09:54.777,000 --> 0:09:56,000
that belongs to the local municipality.

211
0:09:57.04,000 --> 0:09:58,000
They were also lucky, they said,

212
0:09:58.939,000 --> 0:09:59,000
because they began to dig in a sort of

213
0:10:00.677,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Bermuda Triangle of jurisdiction,

214
0:10:03.019,000 --> 0:10:06,000
between port authority, airport authority,

215
0:10:06.496,000 --> 0:10:08,000
two city districts, and a review board.

216
0:10:09.309,000 --> 0:10:11,000
All these red lines are the invisible

217
0:10:12.087,000 --> 0:10:14,000
political institutions that were inscribed

218
0:10:14.665,000 --> 0:10:17,000
in that leftover empty space.

219
0:10:17.699,000 --> 0:10:19,000
With this knowledge, these teenagers

220
0:10:20.654,000 --> 0:10:22,000
as skaters confronted the city.

221
0:10:23.337,000 --> 0:10:25,000
They came to the city attorney's office.

222
0:10:25.491,000 --> 0:10:26,000
The city attorney told them

223
0:10:27.44,000 --> 0:10:28,000
that in order to continue the negotiation

224
0:10:29.336,000 --> 0:10:3,000
they had to become an NGO,

225
0:10:31.279,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and of course they didn't know what an NGO was.

226
0:10:33.54,000 --> 0:10:35,000
They had to talk to their friends in Seattle

227
0:10:36.479,000 --> 0:10:37,000
who had gone through the same experience.

228
0:10:38.39,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And they began to realize the necessity

229
0:10:40.574,000 --> 0:10:42,000
to organize themselves even deeper

230
0:10:42.913,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and began to fundraise, to organize budgets,

231
0:10:47.047,000 --> 0:10:49,000
to really be aware of all the knowledge

232
0:10:49.371,000 --> 0:10:52,000
embedded in the urban code in San Diego

233
0:10:52.604,000 --> 0:10:54,000
so that they could begin to redefine

234
0:10:54.822,000 --> 0:10:57,000
the very meaning of public space in the city,

235
0:10:58.642,000 --> 0:11:,000
expanding it to other categories.

236
0:11:01.134,000 --> 0:11:03,000
At the end, the teenagers won the case

237
0:11:03.769,000 --> 0:11:05,000
with that evidence, and they were able

238
0:11:06.242,000 --> 0:11:08,000
to construct their skateboard park

239
0:11:08.857,000 --> 0:11:09,000
under that freeway.

240
0:11:10.467,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Now for many of you, this story

241
0:11:12.912,000 --> 0:11:14,000
might seem trivial or naive.

242
0:11:15.152,000 --> 0:11:16,000
For me as an architect, it has become

243
0:11:17.101,000 --> 0:11:19,000
a fundamental narrative,

244
0:11:19.439,000 --> 0:11:2,000
because it begins to teach me

245
0:11:21.292,000 --> 0:11:22,000
that this micro-community

246
0:11:23.247,000 --> 0:11:26,000
not only designed another category of public space

247
0:11:26.739,000 --> 0:11:29,000
but they also designed the socioeconomic protocols

248
0:11:30.544,000 --> 0:11:33,000
that were necessary to be inscribed in that space

249
0:11:33.641,000 --> 0:11:35,000
for its long-term sustainability.

250
0:11:36.602,000 --> 0:11:37,000
They also taught me

251
0:11:38.087,000 --> 0:11:4,000
that similar to the migrant communities

252
0:11:40.122,000 --> 0:11:41,000
on both sides of the border,

253
0:11:41.651,000 --> 0:11:44,000
they engaged conflict itself as a creative tool,

254
0:11:45.368,000 --> 0:11:46,000
because they had to produce a process

255
0:11:47.172,000 --> 0:11:5,000
that enabled them to reorganize resources

256
0:11:50.789,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and the politics of the city.

257
0:11:52.623,000 --> 0:11:54,000
In that act, that informal,

258
0:11:55.148,000 --> 0:11:57,000
bottom-up act of transgression,

259
0:11:57.403,000 --> 0:11:59,000
really began to trickle up

260
0:11:59.552,000 --> 0:12:02,000
to transform top-down policy.

261
0:12:02.67,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Now this journey from the bottom-up

262
0:12:07.173,000 --> 0:12:09,000
to the transformation of the top-down

263
0:12:09.353,000 --> 0:12:11,000
is where I find hope today.

264
0:12:11.871,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And I'm thinking of how these modest alterations

265
0:12:16.12,000 --> 0:12:18,000
with space and with policy

266
0:12:19.063,000 --> 0:12:21,000
in many cities in the world,

267
0:12:21.088,000 --> 0:12:23,000
in primarily the urgency

268
0:12:23.802,000 --> 0:12:25,000
of a collective imagination

269
0:12:26.076,000 --> 0:12:27,000
as these communities

270
0:12:27.55,000 --> 0:12:29,000
reimagine their own forms of governance,

271
0:12:29.957,000 --> 0:12:31,000
social organization, and infrastructure,

272
0:12:32.648,000 --> 0:12:33,000
really is at the center

273
0:12:34.576,000 --> 0:12:36,000
of the new formation

274
0:12:36.664,000 --> 0:12:39,000
of democratic politics of the urban.

275
0:12:39.976,000 --> 0:12:42,000
It is, in fact, this that could become the framework

276
0:12:43.253,000 --> 0:12:46,000
for producing new social

277
0:12:46.274,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and economic justice in the city.

278
0:12:49.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
I want to say this and emphasize it,

279
0:12:50.948,000 --> 0:12:53,000
because this is the only way I see

280
0:12:54.597,000 --> 0:12:56,000
that can enable us to move

281
0:12:56.81,000 --> 0:12:59,000
from urbanizations of consumption

282
0:13:00.035,000 --> 0:13:03,000
to neighborhoods of production today.

283
0:13:03.393,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Thank you.

284
0:13:05.281,000 --> 0:13:09,000
(Applause)

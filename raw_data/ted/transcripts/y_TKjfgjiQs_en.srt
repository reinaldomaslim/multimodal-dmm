1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Most people don't know that when I went to high school in this country --

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I applied for university at a time when I was convinced

3
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I was going to be an artist and be a sculptor.

4
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And I came from a very privileged background. I was very lucky.

5
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
My family was wealthy, and my father believed in one thing,

6
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and that was to give us all as much education as we wanted.

7
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And I announced I wanted to be a sculptor in Paris.

8
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And he was a clever man. He sort of said,

9
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
"Well, that's OK, but you've done very well in your math SATs."

10
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
In fact, I'd got an 800. And he thought I did very well -- and I did, too -- in the arts:

11
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
this was my passion.

12
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And he said "If you go to MIT," to which I had been given early admission,

13
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
"I will pay for every year you're at MIT,

14
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
in graduate or undergraduate -- as much as you want --

15
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I will pay for an equal number of years for you to live in Paris."

16
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And I thought that was the best deal in town, so I accepted it immediately.

17
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And I decided that if I was good in art, and I was good in mathematics,

18
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I'd study architecture, which was the blending of the two.

19
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I went and told my headmaster that, at prep school.

20
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And I said to him what I was doing, that I was going to go study architecture

21
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
because it was art and mathematics put together.

22
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
He said to me something that just went completely over my head.

23
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
He said, "You know, I like grey suits, and I like pin-striped suits,

24
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
but I don't like grey pin-striped suits."

25
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And I thought, "What a turkey this guy is," and I went off to MIT.

26
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I studied architecture, then did a second degree in architecture,

27
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and then actually quickly realized that it wasn't architecture.

28
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
That really, the mixing of art and science was computers,

29
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and that that really was the place to bring both, and enjoyed a career doing that.

30
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And probably, if I were to fill out Jim Citrin's scale,

31
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I'd put 100 percent on the side of the equation

32
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative.

33
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And after doing this for a long time, and the Media Lab passing the baton on,

34
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I thought, "Well, maybe it's time for me to do a project.

35
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Something that would be important, but also something

36
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that would take advantage of all of these privileges that one had."

37
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And in the case of the Media Lab, knowing a lot of people,

38
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
knowing people who were either executives or wealthy,

39
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and also not having, in my own case, a career to worry about anymore.

40
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
My career, I mean, I'd done my career.

41
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Didn't have to worry about earning money.

42
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Didn't have to worry about what people thought about me.

43
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And I said, "Boy, let's really do something that takes advantage of all these features,"

44
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and thought that if we could address education, by leveraging the children,

45
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and bringing to the world the access of the computers,

46
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
that that was really the thing we should do.

47
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Never shown this picture before, and probably going to be sued for it.

48
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
It's taken at three o'clock in the morning, without the permission of the company.

49
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
It's about two weeks old. There they are, folks.

50
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
(Applause)

51
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
If you look at the picture, you'll see they're stacked up.

52
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Those are conveyor belts that go around.

53
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
This is one of the conveyor belts with the thing going by,

54
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
but then you'll see the ones up above.

55
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
What happens is, they burn into flash memory the software,

56
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and then test them for a few hours.

57
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
But you've got to have the thing moving on the assembly line, because it's constant.

58
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So they go around in this loop, which is why you see them up there.

59
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So this was great for us because it was a real turning point. But it goes back.

60
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
This picture was taken in 1982, just before the IBM PC was even announced.

61
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Seymour Papert and I were bringing computers to schools

62
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
and developing nations at a time when it was way ahead of itself.

63
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
But one thing we learned was that these kids can absolutely jump into it

64
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
just the same way as our kids do here.

65
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And when people tell me, "Who's going to teach the teachers to teach the kids?"

66
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I say to myself, "What planet do you come from?"

67
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Okay, there's not a person in this room -- I don't care how techie you are --

68
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
there's not a person in this room that doesn't give their laptop or cell phone to a kid

69
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
to help them debug it. OK?

70
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
We all need help, even those of us who are very seasoned.

71
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
This picture of Seymour -- 25 years ago. Seymour made a very simple

72
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
observation in 1968, and then basically presented it in 1970 --

73
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
April 11 to be precise -- called "Teaching Children Thinking."

74
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
What he observed was that kids who write computer programs

75
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
understand things differently, and when they debug the programs,

76
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
they come the closest to learning about learning.

77
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
That was very important, and in some sense, we've lost that.

78
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
Kids don't program enough and boy,

79
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
if there's anything I hope this brings back, it's programming to kids.

80
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It's really important. Using applications is OK,

81
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
but programming is absolutely fundamental.

82
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
This is being launched with three languages in it: Squeak, Logo, and

83
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
a third, that I've never even seen before.

84
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
The point being, this is going to be very, very intensive on the programming side.

85
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
This photograph is very important because it's much later.

86
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
This is in the early 2000s. My son, Dimitri -- who's here,

87
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
many of you know Dimitri -- went to Cambodia, set up this school

88
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that we had built, just as the school connected it to the Internet.

89
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And these kids had their laptops. But it was really what spirited this,

90
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
plus the influence of Joe and others. We started One Laptop per Child.

91
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
This is the same village in Cambodia, just a couple of months ago.

92
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
These kids are real pros. There were just 7,000 machines out there

93
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
being tested by kids. Being a nonprofit is absolutely fundamental.

94
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Everybody advised me not to be a nonprofit, but they were all wrong.

95
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And the reason being a nonprofit is important is actually twofold.

96
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
There are many reasons, but the two that merit the little bit of time is:

97
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
one, the clarity of purpose is there. The moral purpose is clear.

98
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I can see any head of state, any executive I want, at any time, because

99
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I'm not selling laptops. OK? I have no shareholders.

100
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Whether we sell, it doesn't make any difference whatsoever.

101
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
The clarity of purpose is absolutely critical. And the second is very counterintuitive --

102
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
you can get the best people in the world.

103
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
If you look at our professional services, including search firms,

104
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
including communications, including legal services, including banking,

105
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
they're all pro bono. And it's not to save money.

106
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
We've got money in the bank. It's because you get the best people.

107
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
You get the people who are doing it because they believe in the mission,

108
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and they're the best people.

109
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
We couldn't afford to hire a CFO. We put out a job description for a CFO at zero salary,

110
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and we had a queue of people.

111
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
It allows you to team up with people. The U.N.'s not going to be

112
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
our partner if we're profit making. So announcing this with Kofi Annan

113
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
was very important, and the U.N. allowed us

114
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
to basically reach all the countries. And this was the machine we were showing

115
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
before I met Yves Behar.

116
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And while this machine in some sense is silly,

117
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
in retrospect, it actually served a very important purpose.

118
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
That pencil-yellow crank was remembered by everybody.

119
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Everybody remembered the pencil-yellow crank. It's different.

120
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
It was getting its power in a different way. It's kind of childlike.

121
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Even though this wasn't the direction we went because the crank --

122
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
it really is stupid to have it on board, by the way.

123
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
In spite of what some people in the press don't get it, didn't understand it,

124
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
we didn't take it off because we didn't want to do --

125
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
having it on the laptop itself is really not what you want.

126
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
You want a separate thing, like the AC adaptor.

127
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
I didn't bring one with me, but they really work much better off-board.

128
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And then, I could tell you lots about the laptop, but I decided on just four things.

129
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Just keep in mind -- because there are other people, including Bill Gates,

130
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
who said, "Gee, you've got a real computer."

131
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
That computer is unlike anything you've had, and does things --

132
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
there are four of them --

133
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that you don't come close to. And it's very important to be low power,

134
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and I hope that's picked up more by the industry.

135
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
That the reason that you want to be below two watts is

136
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that's roughly what you can generate with your upper body.

137
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Dual-mode display -- that sunlight display's fantastic.

138
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
We were using it at lunch today in the sunlight, and the more sunlight the better.

139
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And that was really critical. The mesh network, it'll become commonplace.

140
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And of course, "rugged" goes without saying.

141
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And the reason I think design matters isn't because I wanted to go to art school.

142
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And by the way, when I graduated from MIT,

143
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
I thought the worst and silliest thing to do would be to go to Paris for six years. (Laughter)

144
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So, I didn't do that. But design matters for a number of reasons.

145
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
The most important being that it is the best way to make an inexpensive product.

146
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Most people make inexpensive products by taking cheap design,

147
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
cheap labor, cheap components, and making a cheap laptop.

148
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And, in English, the word "cheap" has

149
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
a double meaning, which is really appropriate,

150
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
because it's cheap, in the pejorative sense, as well as inexpensive.

151
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
But if you take a different approach, and you think of very large-scale integration,

152
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
very advanced materials, very advanced manufacturing --

153
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
so you're pouring chemicals in one end, iPods are spewing out the other --

154
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and really cool design, that's what we wanted to do.

155
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And I can race through these and save a lot of time because

156
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Yves and I obviously didn't compare notes.

157
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
These are his slides, and so I don't have to talk about them.

158
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
But it was really, to us, very important as a strategy.

159
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
It wasn't just to kind of make it cute, because somebody --

160
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
you know, good design is very important.

161
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Yves showed one of the power-generating devices.

162
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
The mesh network, the reason I -- and I won't go into it in great detail --

163
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
but when we deliver laptops to kids in the remotest and poorest parts of the world,

164
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
they're connected. There's not just laptops.

165
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And so, we have to drop in satellite dishes. We put in generators.

166
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
It's a lot of stuff that goes behind these. These can talk to each other.

167
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
If you're in a desert, they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart.

168
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
If you're in the jungle, it's about 500 meters. So if a kid bicycles home,

169
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
or walks a few miles, they're going to be off the grid, so to speak.

170
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
They're not going to be near another laptop,

171
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
so you have to nail these onto a tree, and sort of, get it.

172
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
You don't call Verizon or Sprint. You build your own network.

173
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And that's very important, the user interface.

174
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
We are launching with 18 keyboards. English is by far the minority.

175
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Latin is relatively rare, too. You just look at some of the languages.

176
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I'm willing to suspect some of you hadn't even heard of them before.

177
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Is there anybody in the room, one person, unless you work with OLPC,

178
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
is there anybody in the room that can tell me what language

179
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
the keyboard is that's on the screen? There's only one hand -- so you get it.

180
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Yes, you're right. He's right. It's Amharic,

181
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
it's Ethiopian. In Ethiopia, there's never been a keyboard.

182
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
There is no keyboard standard because there's no market.

183
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And this is the big difference.

184
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Again, when you're a nonprofit, you look at children as a mission, not as a market.

185
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
So we went to Ethiopia, and we helped them make a keyboard.

186
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And this will become the standard Ethiopian keyboard.

187
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
So what I want to end with is sort of what we're doing to roll it out.

188
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And we changed strategy completely. I decided at the beginning --

189
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
it was a pretty good thing to decide in the beginning,

190
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
it's not what we're doing now -- is to go to six countries.

191
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Big countries, one of them is not so big, but it's rich.

192
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Here's the six. We went to the six,

193
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and in each case the head of state said he would do it, he'd do a million.

194
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
In the case of Gaddafi, he'd do 1.2 million, and that they would launch it.

195
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
We thought, this is exactly the right strategy, get it out,

196
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and then the little countries could sort of piggyback on these big countries.

197
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
And so I went to each of those countries

198
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
at least six times, met with the head of state probably two or three times.

199
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
In each case, got the ministers, went through a lot of the stuff.

200
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
This was a period in my life where I was traveling 330 days per year.

201
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Not something you'd envy or want to do.

202
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
In the case of Libya, it was a lot of fun meeting Gaddafi in his tent.

203
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
The camel smells were unbelievable.

204
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And it was 45 degrees C. I mean, this was not

205
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
what you'd call a cool experience. And former countries --

206
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
I say former, because none of them really came through this summer --

207
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
there was a big difference between getting a head of state

208
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
to have a photo opportunity, make a press release.

209
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
So we went to smaller ones. Uruguay, bless their hearts.

210
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Small country, not so rich. President said he'd do it, and guess what?

211
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
He did do it. The tender had nothing in it that related to us,

212
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
nothing specific about sunlight-readable, mesh-network, low-power,

213
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
but just a vanilla laptop proposal.

214
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And guess what? We won it hands down.

215
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
When it was announced that they were going to do every child in Uruguay,

216
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
the first 100,000, boom, went to OLPC.

217
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
The next day -- the next day, not even 24 hours had passed -- in Peru,

218
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
the president of Peru said, "We'll do 250." And boom, a little domino effect.

219
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
The president of Rwanda stepped in and said he would do it.

220
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
The president of Ethiopia said he would do it.

221
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And boom, boom, boom. The president of Mongolia.

222
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And so what happens is, these things start to happen with these countries --

223
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
still not enough.

224
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Add up all those countries, it didn't quite get to thing, so we said,

225
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
"Let's start a program in the United States." So, end of August, early September,

226
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
we decide to do this. We announced it near the middle, end --

227
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
just when the Clinton Initiative was taking place.

228
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
We thought that was a good time to announce it.

229
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Launched it on the 12 of November.

230
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
We said it would be just for a short period until the 26. We've extended it until the 31.

231
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
And the "Give One, Get One" program is really important because

232
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
it got a lot of people absolutely interested.

233
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
The first day it was just wild. And then we said,

234
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
"Well, let's get people to give many. Not just one, and get one,

235
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
but maybe give 100, give 1,000." And that's where you come in.

236
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And that's where I think it's very important. I don't want you all to go out and

237
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
buy 400 dollars worth of laptops. Okay? Do it, but that's not going to help. Okay?

238
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
If everybody in this room goes out tonight and orders one of these things for 400 dollars,

239
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
whatever it is, 300 people in the room doing it -- yeah, great.

240
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
I want you do something else.

241
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
And it's not to go out and buy 100 or 1,000, though,

242
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
I invite you to do that, and 10,000 would be even better.

243
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Tell people about it! It's got to become viral, OK?

244
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Use your mailing lists. People in this room have extraordinary mailing lists.

245
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Get your friends to give one, get one.

246
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
And if each one of you sends it to 300 or 400 people, that would be fantastic.

247
0:14:48.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
I won't dwell on the pricing at all.

248
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Just to say that when you do the "Give One, Get One,"

249
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
a lot of press is a bit about, "They didn't make it, it's 188 dollars, it's not 100."

250
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
It will be 100 in two years. It will go below 100.

251
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
We've pledged not to add features, but to bring that price down.

252
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
But it was the countries that wanted it to go up, and

253
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
we let them push it up for all sorts of reasons. So what you can do --

254
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
I've just said it. Don't just give one, get one.

255
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
I just want to end with one last one. This one is not even

256
0:15:18.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
24-hours old, or maybe it's 24-hours.

257
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
The first kids got their laptops. They got them by ship,

258
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:28,000
and I'm talking now about 7,000, 8,000 at a time went out this week.

259
0:15:28.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
They went to Uruguay, Peru, Mexico.

260
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
And it's been slow coming, and we're only making about 5,000 a week,

261
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
but we hope, we hope, sometime in next year,

262
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:44,000
maybe by the middle of the year,

263
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
to hit a million a month. Now put that number,

264
0:15:48.16,000 --> 0:15:5,000
and a million isn't so much. It's not a big number.

265
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:53,000
We're selling a billion cell phones worldwide this year.

266
0:15:53.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
But a million a month in laptop-land is a big number.

267
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
And the world production today, everybody combined, making laptops,

268
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:04,000
is five million a month. So I'm standing here telling you that sometime next year,

269
0:16:04.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
we're going to make 20 percent of the world production.

270
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
And if we do that, there are going to be a lot of lucky kids out there.

271
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
And we hope if you have EG two years from now,

272
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
or whenever you have it again,

273
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:21,000
I won't have bad breath, and I will be invited back,

274
0:16:21.16,000 --> 0:16:24,000
and will have, hopefully by then, maybe 100 million out there to children.

275
0:16:24.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Thank you.

276
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:12.585,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm going to be talking about designing humor,

3
0:00:14.445,000 --> 0:00:15,000
which is sort of an interesting thing, but it goes

4
0:00:16.419,000 --> 0:00:19,000
to some of the discussions about constraints,

5
0:00:20.127,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and how in certain contexts, humor is right,

6
0:00:22.885,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and in other contexts it's wrong.

7
0:00:24.576,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Now, I'm from New York,

8
0:00:27.352,000 --> 0:00:3,000
so it's 100 percent satisfaction here.

9
0:00:30.938,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Actually, that's ridiculous, because when it comes to humor,

10
0:00:34.141,000 --> 0:00:37,000
75 percent is really absolutely the best you can hope for.

11
0:00:37.43,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Nobody is ever satisfied 100 percent with humor

12
0:00:42.413,000 --> 0:00:44,000
except this woman.

13
0:00:45.129,000 --> 0:00:54,000
(Video) Woman: (Laughs)

14
0:01:02.378,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Bob Mankoff: That's my first wife.

15
0:01:03.778,000 --> 0:01:05,000
(Laughter)

16
0:01:06.053,000 --> 0:01:08,000
That part of the relationship went fine.

17
0:01:08.545,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:12.11,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Now let's look at this cartoon.

19
0:01:15.632,000 --> 0:01:16,000
One of the things I'm pointing out is that

20
0:01:17.208,000 --> 0:01:19,000
cartoons appear within the context

21
0:01:19.512,000 --> 0:01:2,000
of The New Yorker magazine,

22
0:01:21.225,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that lovely Caslon type, and it seems

23
0:01:23.166,000 --> 0:01:26,000
like a fairly benign cartoon within this context.

24
0:01:26.64,000 --> 0:01:28,000
It's making a little bit fun of getting older,

25
0:01:28.711,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and, you know, people might like it.

26
0:01:30.063,000 --> 0:01:33,000
But like I said, you cannot satisfy everyone.

27
0:01:33.299,000 --> 0:01:35,000
You couldn't satisfy this guy.

28
0:01:35.745,000 --> 0:01:38,000
"Another joke on old white males. Ha ha. The wit.

29
0:01:38.832,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It's nice, I'm sure to be young and rude,

30
0:01:40.492,000 --> 0:01:43,000
but some day you'll be old, unless you drop dead as I wish."

31
0:01:43.965,000 --> 0:01:46,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:47.183,000 --> 0:01:5,000
The New Yorker is rather a sensitive environment,

33
0:01:50.693,000 --> 0:01:52,000
very easy for people to get their nose out of joint.

34
0:01:53.301,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And one of the things that you realize

35
0:01:56.235,000 --> 0:01:58,000
is it's an unusual environment.

36
0:01:58.702,000 --> 0:02:,000
Here I'm one person talking to you.

37
0:02:00.845,000 --> 0:02:03,000
You're all collective. You all hear each other laugh and know each other laugh.

38
0:02:04.543,000 --> 0:02:08,000
In The New Yorker, it goes out to a wide audience,

39
0:02:08.824,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and when you actually look at that,

40
0:02:10.316,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and nobody knows what anybody else is laughing at,

41
0:02:13.828,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and when you look at that the subjectivity involved in humor

42
0:02:17.144,000 --> 0:02:18,000
is really interesting.

43
0:02:18.727,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Let's look at this cartoon.

44
0:02:20.365,000 --> 0:02:22,000
"Discouraging data on the antidepressant."

45
0:02:22.7,000 --> 0:02:24,000
(Laughter)

46
0:02:24.724,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Indeed, it is discouraging.

47
0:02:27.735,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Now, you would think, well, look,

48
0:02:29.537,000 --> 0:02:3,000
most of you laughed at that.

49
0:02:31.206,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Right? You thought it was funny.

50
0:02:32.627,000 --> 0:02:33,000
In general, that seems like a funny cartoon,

51
0:02:34.309,000 --> 0:02:37,000
but let's look what online survey I did.

52
0:02:37.693,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Generally, about 85 percent of the people liked it.

53
0:02:39.81,000 --> 0:02:42,000
A hundred and nine voted it a 10, the highest. Ten voted it one.

54
0:02:43.173,000 --> 0:02:45,000
But look at the individual responses.

55
0:02:45.484,000 --> 0:02:47,000
"I like animals!!!!!" Look how much they like them.

56
0:02:47.787,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Laughter)

57
0:02:51.314,000 --> 0:02:54,000
"I don't want to hurt them. That doesn't seem very funny to me."

58
0:02:54.413,000 --> 0:02:55,000
This person rated it a two.

59
0:02:56.302,000 --> 0:03:,000
"I don't like to see animals suffer -- even in cartoons."

60
0:03:00.684,000 --> 0:03:05,000
To people like this, I point out we use anesthetic ink.

61
0:03:05.81,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Other people thought it was funny.

62
0:03:07.567,000 --> 0:03:1,000
That actually is the true nature of the distribution of humor

63
0:03:10.636,000 --> 0:03:14,000
when you don't have the contagion of humor.

64
0:03:14.814,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Humor is a type of entertainment.

65
0:03:16.531,000 --> 0:03:19,000
All entertainment contains a little frisson of danger,

66
0:03:20.338,000 --> 0:03:22,000
something that might happen wrong,

67
0:03:22.458,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and yet we like it when there's protection.

68
0:03:24.927,000 --> 0:03:26,000
That's what a zoo is. It's danger. The tiger is there.

69
0:03:27.662,000 --> 0:03:31,000
The bars protect us. That's sort of fun, right?

70
0:03:31.812,000 --> 0:03:32,000
That's a bad zoo.

71
0:03:33.393,000 --> 0:03:35,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:35.916,000 --> 0:03:39,000
It's a very politically correct zoo, but it's a bad zoo.

73
0:03:39.938,000 --> 0:03:41,000
But this is a worse one.

74
0:03:42.093,000 --> 0:03:45,000
(Laughter)

75
0:03:45.898,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So in dealing with humor in the context of The New Yorker,

76
0:03:50.017,000 --> 0:03:52,000
you have to see, where is that tiger going to be?

77
0:03:52.866,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Where is the danger going to exist?

78
0:03:54.228,000 --> 0:03:56,000
How are you going to manage it?

79
0:03:56.447,000 --> 0:04:,000
My job is to look at 1,000 cartoons a week.

80
0:04:00.844,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But The New Yorker only can take 16 or 17 cartoons,

81
0:04:05.063,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and we have 1,000 cartoons.

82
0:04:06.58,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Of course, many, many cartoons must be rejected.

83
0:04:09.456,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Now, we could fit more cartoons in the magazine

84
0:04:12.619,000 --> 0:04:14,000
if we removed the articles.

85
0:04:14.635,000 --> 0:04:17,000
(Laughter)

86
0:04:18.367,000 --> 0:04:22,000
But I feel that would be a huge loss,

87
0:04:23.324,000 --> 0:04:26,000
one I could live with, but still huge.

88
0:04:27.097,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Cartoonists come in through the magazine every week.

89
0:04:30.013,000 --> 0:04:31,000
The average cartoonist who stays with the magazine

90
0:04:32.011,000 --> 0:04:34,000
does 10 or 15 ideas every week.

91
0:04:34.567,000 --> 0:04:37,000
But they mostly are going to be rejected.

92
0:04:37.633,000 --> 0:04:4,000
That's the nature of any creative activity.

93
0:04:40.677,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Many of them fade away. Some of them stay.

94
0:04:44.141,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Matt Diffee is one of them.

95
0:04:45.559,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Here's one of his cartoons.

96
0:04:47.577,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Laughter)

97
0:04:53.152,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Drew Dernavich. "Accounting night at the improv."

98
0:04:56.046,000 --> 0:04:58,000
"Now is the part of the show when we ask the audience

99
0:04:58.15,000 --> 0:05:02,000
to shout out some random numbers."

100
0:05:02.909,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Paul Noth. "He's all right. I just wish he were a little more pro-Israel."

101
0:05:07.685,000 --> 0:05:11,000
(Laughter)

102
0:05:12.458,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Now I know all about rejection,

103
0:05:14.34,000 --> 0:05:18,000
because when I quit -- actually, I was booted out of -- psychology school

104
0:05:18.587,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and decided to become a cartoonist, a natural segue,

105
0:05:22.019,000 --> 0:05:27,000
from 1974 to 1977 I submitted 2,000 cartoons to The New Yorker,

106
0:05:27.093,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and got 2,000 cartoons rejected by The New Yorker.

107
0:05:31.689,000 --> 0:05:35,000
At a certain point, this rejection slip, in 1977 --

108
0:05:36.041,000 --> 0:05:36,000
[We regret that we are unable to use the enclosed material. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to consider it.] —

109
0:05:37.036,000 --> 0:05:38,000
magically changed to this.

110
0:05:38.61,000 --> 0:05:41,000
[Hey! You sold one. No shit! You really sold a cartoon to the fucking New Yorker magazine.]

111
0:05:42.048,000 --> 0:05:44,000
(Laughter)

112
0:05:44.859,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Now of course that's not what happened,

113
0:05:47.128,000 --> 0:05:51,000
but that's the emotional truth.

114
0:05:51.745,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And of course, that is not New Yorker humor.

115
0:05:54.168,000 --> 0:05:55,000
What is New Yorker humor?

116
0:05:55.957,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Well, after 1977, I broke into The New Yorker and started selling cartoons.

117
0:06:00.649,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Finally, in 1980, I received the revered

118
0:06:03.53,000 --> 0:06:05,000
New Yorker contract,

119
0:06:05.724,000 --> 0:06:09,000
which I blurred out parts because it's none of your business.

120
0:06:09.759,000 --> 0:06:12,000
From 1980. "Dear Mr. Mankoff, confirming the agreement

121
0:06:13.269,000 --> 0:06:15,000
there of -- " blah blah blah blah -- blur --

122
0:06:15.722,000 --> 0:06:18,000
"for any idea drawings."

123
0:06:19.15,000 --> 0:06:22,000
With respect to idea drawings, nowhere in the contract

124
0:06:22.176,000 --> 0:06:24,000
is the word "cartoon" mentioned.

125
0:06:24.255,000 --> 0:06:29,000
The word "idea drawings," and that's the sine qua non of New Yorker cartoons.

126
0:06:29.704,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So what is an idea drawing? An idea drawing is something

127
0:06:33.129,000 --> 0:06:36,000
that requires you to think.

128
0:06:36.414,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Now that's not a cartoon. It requires thinking

129
0:06:39.199,000 --> 0:06:41,000
on the part of the cartoonist and thinking on your part

130
0:06:42.196,000 --> 0:06:44,000
to make it into a cartoon.

131
0:06:44.306,000 --> 0:06:49,000
(Laughter)

132
0:06:50.071,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Here are some, generally you get my cast of cartoon mind.

133
0:06:55.214,000 --> 0:07:01,000
"There is no justice in the world. There is some justice in the world. The world is just."

134
0:07:01.359,000 --> 0:07:02,000
This is What Lemmings Believe.

135
0:07:03.327,000 --> 0:07:09,000
(Laughter)

136
0:07:09.616,000 --> 0:07:11,000
The New Yorker and I, when we made comments,

137
0:07:12.541,000 --> 0:07:16,000
the cartoon carries a certain ambiguity about what it actually is.

138
0:07:17.052,000 --> 0:07:19,000
What is it, the cartoon? Is it really about lemmings?

139
0:07:19.34,000 --> 0:07:21,000
No. It's about us.

140
0:07:21.692,000 --> 0:07:23,000
You know, it's my view basically about religion,

141
0:07:24.572,000 --> 0:07:28,000
that the real conflict and all the fights between religion

142
0:07:29.259,000 --> 0:07:31,000
is who has the best imaginary friend.

143
0:07:32.14,000 --> 0:07:37,000
(Laughter)

144
0:07:37.271,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And this is my most well-known cartoon.

145
0:07:39.263,000 --> 0:07:42,000
"No, Thursday's out. How about never — is never good for you?"

146
0:07:43.015,000 --> 0:07:45,000
It's been reprinted thousands of times, totally ripped off.

147
0:07:45.582,000 --> 0:07:47,000
It's even on thongs,

148
0:07:48.344,000 --> 0:07:54,000
but compressed to "How about never — is never good for you?"

149
0:07:54.971,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Now these look like very different forms of humor

150
0:07:58.37,000 --> 0:08:,000
but actually they bear a great similarity.

151
0:08:00.764,000 --> 0:08:04,000
In each instance, our expectations are defied.

152
0:08:05.187,000 --> 0:08:08,000
In each instance, the narrative gets switched.

153
0:08:08.903,000 --> 0:08:1,000
There's an incongruity and a contrast.

154
0:08:11.157,000 --> 0:08:14,000
In "No, Thursday's out. How about never — is never good for you?"

155
0:08:14.406,000 --> 0:08:16,000
what you have is the syntax of politeness

156
0:08:16.886,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and the message of being rude.

157
0:08:19.147,000 --> 0:08:22,000
That really is how humor works. It's a cognitive synergy

158
0:08:22.416,000 --> 0:08:25,000
where we mash up these two things which don't go together

159
0:08:26.195,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and temporarily in our minds exist.

160
0:08:28.976,000 --> 0:08:3,000
He is both being polite and rude.

161
0:08:31.496,000 --> 0:08:34,000
In here, you have the propriety of The New Yorker

162
0:08:34.767,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and the vulgarity of the language.

163
0:08:36.748,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Basically, that's the way humor works.

164
0:08:38.773,000 --> 0:08:4,000
So I'm a humor analyst, you would say.

165
0:08:41.295,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Now E.B. White said, analyzing humor is like dissecting a frog.

166
0:08:44.837,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Nobody is much interested, and the frog dies.

167
0:08:47.485,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Well, I'm going to kill a few, but there won't be any genocide.

168
0:08:52.208,000 --> 0:08:53,000
But really, it makes me —

169
0:08:54.013,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Let's look at this picture. This is an interesting picture,

170
0:08:56.085,000 --> 0:08:57,000
The Laughing Audience.

171
0:08:58.017,000 --> 0:08:59,000
There are the people, fops up there,

172
0:08:59.798,000 --> 0:09:02,000
but everybody is laughing, everybody is laughing

173
0:09:02.923,000 --> 0:09:04,000
except one guy.

174
0:09:05.414,000 --> 0:09:09,000
This guy. Who is he? He's the critic.

175
0:09:09.954,000 --> 0:09:11,000
He's the critic of humor,

176
0:09:12.396,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and really I'm forced to be in that position,

177
0:09:15.564,000 --> 0:09:18,000
when I'm at The New Yorker, and that's the danger

178
0:09:18.86,000 --> 0:09:23,000
that I will become this guy.

179
0:09:23.977,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Now here's a little video made by Matt Diffee, sort of

180
0:09:26.87,000 --> 0:09:29,000
how they imagine if we really exaggerated that.

181
0:09:30.594,000 --> 0:09:33,000
(Video) Bob Mankoff: "Oooh, no.

182
0:09:33.62,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Ehhh.

183
0:09:36.148,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Oooh. Hmm. Too funny.

184
0:09:45.422,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Normally I would but I'm in a pissy mood.

185
0:09:49.36,000 --> 0:09:51,000
I'll enjoy it on my own. Perhaps.

186
0:09:52.059,000 --> 0:09:55,000
No. Nah. No.

187
0:09:55.72,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Overdrawn. Underdrawn.

188
0:09:58.717,000 --> 0:10:,000
Drawn just right, still not funny enough.

189
0:10:01.387,000 --> 0:10:04,000
No. No.

190
0:10:04.653,000 --> 0:10:07,000
For God's sake no, a thousand times no.

191
0:10:08.018,000 --> 0:10:11,000
(Music)

192
0:10:11.292,000 --> 0:10:16,000
No. No. No. No. No. [Four hours later]

193
0:10:17.277,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Hey, that's good, yeah, whatcha got there?

194
0:10:21.043,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Office worker: Got a ham and swiss on rye?BM: No.

195
0:10:23.186,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Office worker: Okay. Pastrami on sourdough?BM: No.

196
0:10:26.111,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Office worker: Smoked turkey with bacon?BM: No.

197
0:10:28.054,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Office worker: Falafel?BM: Let me look at it.

198
0:10:30.256,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Eh, no.

199
0:10:31.696,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Office worker: Grilled cheese?BM: No.

200
0:10:33.111,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Office worker: BLT?BM: No.

201
0:10:34.048,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Office worker: Black forest ham and mozzarella with apple mustard?BM: No.

202
0:10:36.668,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Office worker: Green bean salad?BM: No.

203
0:10:39.189,000 --> 0:10:41,000
(Music)

204
0:10:41.77,000 --> 0:10:42,000
No. No.

205
0:10:43.714,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Definitely no. [Several hours after lunch]

206
0:10:46.944,000 --> 0:10:54,000
(Siren)

207
0:11:08.695,000 --> 0:11:1,000
No. Get out of here.

208
0:11:11.192,000 --> 0:11:12,000
(Laughter)

209
0:11:12.609,000 --> 0:11:15,000
That's sort of an exaggeration of what I do.

210
0:11:16.086,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Now, we do reject, many, many, many cartoons,

211
0:11:19.352,000 --> 0:11:22,000
so many that there are many books called "The Rejection Collection."

212
0:11:22.456,000 --> 0:11:26,000
"The Rejection Collection" is not quite New Yorker kind of humor.

213
0:11:26.834,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And you might notice the bum on the sidewalk here

214
0:11:29.301,000 --> 0:11:32,000
who is boozing and his ventriloquist dummy is puking.

215
0:11:33.124,000 --> 0:11:35,000
See, that's probably not going to be New Yorker humor.

216
0:11:35.612,000 --> 0:11:38,000
It's actually put together by Matt Diffee, one of our cartoonists.

217
0:11:38.889,000 --> 0:11:42,000
So I'll give you some examples of rejection collection humor.

218
0:11:43.311,000 --> 0:11:45,000
"I'm thinking about having a child."

219
0:11:46.022,000 --> 0:11:51,000
(Laughter)

220
0:11:51.31,000 --> 0:11:54,000
There you have an interesting -- the guilty laugh,

221
0:11:55.084,000 --> 0:11:58,000
the laugh against your better judgment.

222
0:11:58.342,000 --> 0:12:01,000
(Laughter)

223
0:12:01.393,000 --> 0:12:04,000
"Ass-head. Please help."

224
0:12:04.555,000 --> 0:12:06,000
(Laughter)

225
0:12:06.838,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Now, in fact, within a context of this book,

226
0:12:10.502,000 --> 0:12:13,000
which says, "Cartoons you never saw and never will see

227
0:12:13.544,000 --> 0:12:15,000
in The New Yorker," this humor is perfect.

228
0:12:16.267,000 --> 0:12:17,000
I'm going to explain why.

229
0:12:17.872,000 --> 0:12:18,000
There's a concept about humor about it being

230
0:12:19.584,000 --> 0:12:21,000
a benign violation.

231
0:12:21.917,000 --> 0:12:22,000
In other words, for something to be funny, we've got to think

232
0:12:23.894,000 --> 0:12:26,000
it's both wrong and also okay at the same time.

233
0:12:27.435,000 --> 0:12:29,000
If we think it's completely wrong, we say, "That's not funny."

234
0:12:30.371,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And if it's completely okay, what's the joke? Okay?

235
0:12:34.036,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And so, this benign, that's true of "No, Thursday's out. How about never — is never good for you?"

236
0:12:39.416,000 --> 0:12:41,000
It's rude. The world really shouldn't be that way.

237
0:12:41.574,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Within that context, we feel it's okay.

238
0:12:44.478,000 --> 0:12:47,000
So within this context, "Asshead. Please help"

239
0:12:47.69,000 --> 0:12:49,000
is a benign violation.

240
0:12:49.734,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Within the context of The New Yorker magazine ...

241
0:12:54.063,000 --> 0:12:57,000
"T-Cell Army: Can the body's immune response

242
0:12:57.606,000 --> 0:13:,000
help treat cancer?" Oh, goodness.

243
0:13:01.516,000 --> 0:13:04,000
You're reading about this smart stuff,

244
0:13:05.278,000 --> 0:13:09,000
this intelligent dissection of the immune system.

245
0:13:09.299,000 --> 0:13:12,000
You glance over at this, and it says,

246
0:13:13.032,000 --> 0:13:18,000
"Asshead. Please help"? God.

247
0:13:18.194,000 --> 0:13:22,000
So there the violation is malign. It doesn't work.

248
0:13:22.794,000 --> 0:13:25,000
There is no such thing as funny in and of itself.

249
0:13:25.917,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Everything will be within the context and our expectations.

250
0:13:29.768,000 --> 0:13:32,000
One way to look at it is this.

251
0:13:33.206,000 --> 0:13:37,000
It's sort of called a meta-motivational theory about how we look,

252
0:13:37.347,000 --> 0:13:38,000
a theory about motivation and the mood we're in

253
0:13:39.195,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and how the mood we're in determines the things we like

254
0:13:42.309,000 --> 0:13:43,000
or dislike.

255
0:13:44.009,000 --> 0:13:48,000
When we're in a playful mood, we want excitement.

256
0:13:48.307,000 --> 0:13:51,000
We want high arousal. We feel excited then.

257
0:13:51.616,000 --> 0:13:53,000
If we're in a purposeful mood, that makes us anxious.

258
0:13:54.22,000 --> 0:13:59,000
"The Rejection Collection" is absolutely in this field.

259
0:13:59.801,000 --> 0:14:01,000
You want to be stimulated. You want to be aroused.

260
0:14:02.157,000 --> 0:14:06,000
You want to be transgressed.

261
0:14:06.647,000 --> 0:14:1,000
It's like this, like an amusement park.

262
0:14:11.017,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Voice: Here we go. (Screams)

263
0:14:20.18,000 --> 0:14:23,000
He laughs. He is both in danger and safe,

264
0:14:24.15,000 --> 0:14:27,000
incredibly aroused. There's no joke. No joke needed.

265
0:14:27.298,000 --> 0:14:3,000
If you arouse people enough and get them stimulated enough,

266
0:14:30.523,000 --> 0:14:32,000
they will laugh at very, very little.

267
0:14:32.789,000 --> 0:14:34,000
This is another cartoon from "The Rejection Collection."

268
0:14:35.074,000 --> 0:14:39,000
"Too snug?"

269
0:14:39.533,000 --> 0:14:41,000
That's a cartoon about terrorism.

270
0:14:41.736,000 --> 0:14:44,000
The New Yorker occupies a very different space.

271
0:14:45.092,000 --> 0:14:48,000
It's a space that is playful in its own way, and also purposeful,

272
0:14:48.817,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and in that space, the cartoons are different.

273
0:14:52.309,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Now I'm going to show you cartoons The New Yorker did

274
0:14:54.678,000 --> 0:14:58,000
right after 9/11, a very, very sensitive area when humor could be used.

275
0:14:59.276,000 --> 0:15:,000
How would The New Yorker attack it?

276
0:15:00.705,000 --> 0:15:04,000
It would not be with a guy with a bomb saying, "Too snug?"

277
0:15:05.258,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Or there was another cartoon I didn't show because

278
0:15:07.482,000 --> 0:15:1,000
actually I thought maybe people would be offended.

279
0:15:11.442,000 --> 0:15:14,000
The great Sam Gross cartoon, this happened

280
0:15:15.088,000 --> 0:15:19,000
after the Muhammad controversy where it's Muhammad in heaven,

281
0:15:19.12,000 --> 0:15:21,000
the suicide bomber is all in little pieces,

282
0:15:21.909,000 --> 0:15:23,000
and he's saying to the suicide bomber,

283
0:15:24.009,000 --> 0:15:27,000
"You'll get the virgins when we find your penis."

284
0:15:27.28,000 --> 0:15:31,000
(Laughter)

285
0:15:31.382,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Better left undrawn.

286
0:15:34.806,000 --> 0:15:36,000
The first week we did no cartoons.

287
0:15:37.454,000 --> 0:15:39,000
That was a black hole for humor, and correctly so.

288
0:15:40.43,000 --> 0:15:42,000
It's not always appropriate every time.

289
0:15:43.028,000 --> 0:15:46,000
But the next week, this was the first cartoon.

290
0:15:46.676,000 --> 0:15:5,000
"I thought I'd never laugh again. Then I saw your jacket."

291
0:15:51.286,000 --> 0:15:54,000
It basically was about, if we were alive,

292
0:15:54.305,000 --> 0:15:55,000
we were going to laugh. We were going to breathe.

293
0:15:56.102,000 --> 0:15:58,000
We were going to exist. Here's another one.

294
0:15:58.373,000 --> 0:16:03,000
"I figure if I don't have that third martini, then the terrorists win."

295
0:16:03.708,000 --> 0:16:06,000
These cartoons are not about them. They're about us.

296
0:16:07.266,000 --> 0:16:09,000
The humor reflects back on us.

297
0:16:09.59,000 --> 0:16:12,000
The easiest thing to do with humor, and it's perfectly legitimate,

298
0:16:13.425,000 --> 0:16:16,000
is a friend makes fun of an enemy.

299
0:16:17.05,000 --> 0:16:19,000
It's called dispositional humor.

300
0:16:19.183,000 --> 0:16:22,000
It's 95 percent of the humor. It's not our humor.

301
0:16:22.652,000 --> 0:16:24,000
Here's another cartoon.

302
0:16:25.062,000 --> 0:16:28,000
"I wouldn't mind living in a fundamentalist Islamic state."

303
0:16:28.694,000 --> 0:16:32,000
(Laughter)

304
0:16:37.851,000 --> 0:16:41,000
Humor does need a target.

305
0:16:42.215,000 --> 0:16:46,000
But interestingly, in The New Yorker, the target is us.

306
0:16:46.391,000 --> 0:16:48,000
The target is the readership and the people who do it.

307
0:16:48.951,000 --> 0:16:5,000
The humor is self-reflective

308
0:16:51.119,000 --> 0:16:53,000
and makes us think about our assumptions.

309
0:16:53.972,000 --> 0:16:56,000
Look at this cartoon by Roz Chast, the guy reading the obituary.

310
0:16:57.507,000 --> 0:16:59,000
"Two years younger than you, 12 years older than you,

311
0:17:00.161,000 --> 0:17:02,000
three years your junior, your age on the dot,

312
0:17:03.127,000 --> 0:17:05,000
exactly your age."

313
0:17:05.695,000 --> 0:17:08,000
That is a deeply profound cartoon.

314
0:17:09.119,000 --> 0:17:13,000
And so The New Yorker is also trying to, in some way,

315
0:17:13.59,000 --> 0:17:16,000
make cartoons say something besides funny

316
0:17:17.297,000 --> 0:17:19,000
and something about us. Here's another one.

317
0:17:19.544,000 --> 0:17:21,000
"I started my vegetarianism for health reasons,

318
0:17:21.752,000 --> 0:17:24,000
Then it became a moral choice, and now it's just to annoy people."

319
0:17:25.075,000 --> 0:17:3,000
(Laughter)

320
0:17:30.722,000 --> 0:17:33,000
"Excuse me — I think there's something wrong with this

321
0:17:33.763,000 --> 0:17:38,000
in a tiny way that no one other than me would ever be able to pinpoint."

322
0:17:39.587,000 --> 0:17:42,000
So it focuses on our obsessions, our narcissism,

323
0:17:43.563,000 --> 0:17:47,000
our foils and our foibles, really not someone else's.

324
0:17:47.828,000 --> 0:17:49,000
The New Yorker demands

325
0:17:50.35,000 --> 0:17:52,000
some cognitive work on your part,

326
0:17:53.067,000 --> 0:17:55,000
and what it demands is what Arthur Koestler,

327
0:17:55.422,000 --> 0:17:57,000
who wrote "The Act of Creation" about the relationship

328
0:17:58.337,000 --> 0:18:,000
between humor, art and science,

329
0:18:01.134,000 --> 0:18:03,000
is what's called bisociation.

330
0:18:03.214,000 --> 0:18:06,000
You have to bring together ideas from different frames of reference,

331
0:18:06.81,000 --> 0:18:09,000
and you have to do it quickly to understand the cartoon.

332
0:18:09.982,000 --> 0:18:11,000
If the different frames of reference don't come together

333
0:18:12.464,000 --> 0:18:13,000
in about .5 seconds, it's not funny,

334
0:18:14.45,000 --> 0:18:15,000
but I think they will for you here.

335
0:18:16.384,000 --> 0:18:18,000
Different frames of reference.

336
0:18:18.458,000 --> 0:18:2,000
"You slept with her, didn't you?"

337
0:18:21.286,000 --> 0:18:26,000
(Laughter)

338
0:18:26.574,000 --> 0:18:28,000
"Lassie! Get help!!"

339
0:18:28.915,000 --> 0:18:31,000
(Laughter)

340
0:18:32.883,000 --> 0:18:34,000
It's called French Army Knife.

341
0:18:35.575,000 --> 0:18:41,000
(Laughter)

342
0:18:42.031,000 --> 0:18:44,000
And this is Einstein in bed. "To you it was fast."

343
0:18:44.699,000 --> 0:18:51,000
(Laughter)

344
0:18:51.93,000 --> 0:18:54,000
Now there are some cartoons that are puzzling.

345
0:18:55.154,000 --> 0:18:59,000
Like, this cartoon would puzzle many people.

346
0:18:59.218,000 --> 0:19:03,000
How many people know what this cartoon means?

347
0:19:03.445,000 --> 0:19:07,000
The dog is signaling he wants to go for a walk.

348
0:19:07.949,000 --> 0:19:12,000
This is the signal for a catcher to walk the dog.

349
0:19:13.655,000 --> 0:19:15,000
That's why we run a feature in the cartoon issue every year

350
0:19:16.196,000 --> 0:19:19,000
called "I Don't Get It: The New Yorker Cartoon I.Q. Test."

351
0:19:19.266,000 --> 0:19:21,000
(Laughter)

352
0:19:21.345,000 --> 0:19:22,000
The other thing The New Yorker plays around with

353
0:19:23.283,000 --> 0:19:25,000
is incongruity, and incongruity, I've shown you,

354
0:19:25.993,000 --> 0:19:26,000
is sort of the basis of humor.

355
0:19:27.581,000 --> 0:19:3,000
Something that's completely normal or logical isn't going to be funny.

356
0:19:30.988,000 --> 0:19:33,000
But the way incongruity works is, observational humor

357
0:19:34.581,000 --> 0:19:36,000
is humor within the realm of reality.

358
0:19:37.003,000 --> 0:19:42,000
"My boss is always telling me what to do." Okay?

359
0:19:42.481,000 --> 0:19:44,000
That could happen. It's humor within the realm of reality.

360
0:19:45.474,000 --> 0:19:47,000
Here, cowboy to a cow:

361
0:19:47.67,000 --> 0:19:51,000
"Very impressive. I'd like to find 5,000 more like you."

362
0:19:52.027,000 --> 0:19:55,000
We understand that. It's absurd. But we're putting the two together.

363
0:19:55.703,000 --> 0:19:58,000
Here, in the nonsense range:

364
0:19:59.201,000 --> 0:20:04,000
"Damn it, Hopkins, didn't you get yesterday's memo?"

365
0:20:04.256,000 --> 0:20:08,000
Now that's a little puzzling, right? It doesn't quite come together.

366
0:20:08.599,000 --> 0:20:1,000
In general, people who enjoy more nonsense,

367
0:20:11.396,000 --> 0:20:12,000
enjoy more abstract art,

368
0:20:13.366,000 --> 0:20:16,000
they tend to be liberal, less conservative, that type of stuff.

369
0:20:16.591,000 --> 0:20:19,000
But for us, and for me, helping design the humor,

370
0:20:20.256,000 --> 0:20:22,000
it doesn't make any sense to compare one to the other.

371
0:20:22.821,000 --> 0:20:26,000
It's sort of a smorgasbord that's made all interesting.

372
0:20:27.236,000 --> 0:20:31,000
So I want to sum all this up with a caption to a cartoon,

373
0:20:31.846,000 --> 0:20:33,000
and I think this sums up the whole thing, really,

374
0:20:34.606,000 --> 0:20:36,000
about The New Yorker cartoons.

375
0:20:36.972,000 --> 0:20:38,000
"It sort of makes you stop and think, doesn't it."

376
0:20:39.844,000 --> 0:20:42,000
(Laughter)

377
0:20:43.277,000 --> 0:20:45,000
And now, when you look at New Yorker cartoons,

378
0:20:45.559,000 --> 0:20:47,000
I'd like you to stop and think a little bit more about them.

379
0:20:47.739,000 --> 0:20:48,000
Thank you.

380
0:20:48.952,000 --> 0:20:51,000
(Applause)

381
0:20:52.589,000 --> 0:20:54,000
Thank you. (Applause)

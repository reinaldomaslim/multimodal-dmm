1
0:00:12.999,000 --> 0:00:17,000
If you want to buy high-quality, low-price cocaine,

2
0:00:18.542,000 --> 0:00:2,000
there really is only one place to go,

3
0:00:21.403,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and that is the dark net anonymous markets.

4
0:00:25.664,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Now, you can't get to these sites

5
0:00:27.312,000 --> 0:00:31,000
with a normal browser -- Chrome or Firefox --

6
0:00:31.799,000 --> 0:00:34,000
because they're on this hidden part of the Internet,

7
0:00:34.956,000 --> 0:00:36,000
known as Tor hidden services,

8
0:00:37.082,000 --> 0:00:41,000
where URLs are a string of meaningless numbers and letters that end in .onion,

9
0:00:41.799,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and which you access with a special browser

10
0:00:44.629,000 --> 0:00:45,000
called the Tor browser.

11
0:00:46.799,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Now, the Tor browser was originally a U.S. Naval intelligence project.

12
0:00:51.399,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It then became open source,

13
0:00:53.304,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and it allows anybody to browse the net

14
0:00:55.915,000 --> 0:00:57,000
without giving away their location.

15
0:00:58.955,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And it does this by encrypting your IP address

16
0:01:02.519,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and then routing it via several other computers around the world

17
0:01:06.319,000 --> 0:01:08,000
that use the same software.

18
0:01:09.508,000 --> 0:01:11,000
You can use it on the normal Internet,

19
0:01:11.799,000 --> 0:01:14,000
but it's also your key to the dark net.

20
0:01:16.438,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And because of this fiendishly clever encryption system,

21
0:01:19.532,000 --> 0:01:24,000
the 20 or 30 -- we don't know exactly -- thousand sites that operate there

22
0:01:24.975,000 --> 0:01:27,000
are incredibly difficult to shut down.

23
0:01:28.642,000 --> 0:01:33,000
It is a censorship-free world visited by anonymous users.

24
0:01:35.268,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Little wonder, then, that it's a natural place to go

25
0:01:39.61,000 --> 0:01:4,000
for anybody with something to hide,

26
0:01:41.546,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and that something, of course, need not be illegal.

27
0:01:46.799,000 --> 0:01:47,000
On the dark net, you will find

28
0:01:48.662,000 --> 0:01:5,000
whistle-blower sites, The New Yorker.

29
0:01:51.225,000 --> 0:01:53,000
You will find political activism blogs.

30
0:01:53.735,000 --> 0:01:56,000
You will find libraries of pirated books.

31
0:01:56.867,000 --> 0:01:59,000
But you'll also find the drugs markets,

32
0:02:00.514,000 --> 0:02:04,000
illegal pornography, commercial hacking services,

33
0:02:04.643,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and much more besides.

34
0:02:06.264,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Now, the dark net is one of the most interesting, exciting places

35
0:02:12.098,000 --> 0:02:13,000
anywhere on the net.

36
0:02:13.799,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And the reason is, because although innovation, of course,

37
0:02:17.499,000 --> 0:02:19,000
takes place in big businesses,

38
0:02:19.799,000 --> 0:02:21,000
takes place in world-class universities,

39
0:02:22.222,000 --> 0:02:24,000
it also takes place in the fringes,

40
0:02:24.799,000 --> 0:02:28,000
because those on the fringes -- the pariahs, the outcasts --

41
0:02:29.366,000 --> 0:02:32,000
they're often the most creative, because they have to be.

42
0:02:33.619,000 --> 0:02:35,000
In this part of the Internet,

43
0:02:36.076,000 --> 0:02:38,000
you will not find a single lolcat,

44
0:02:38.379,000 --> 0:02:4,000
a single pop-up advert anywhere.

45
0:02:41.449,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And that's one of the reasons why I think

46
0:02:43.886,000 --> 0:02:46,000
many of you here will be on the dark net fairly soon.

47
0:02:47.599,000 --> 0:02:49,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:50.177,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Not that I'm suggesting anyone in this audience would use it

49
0:02:53.493,000 --> 0:02:55,000
to go and procure high-quality narcotics.

50
0:02:56.405,000 --> 0:02:57,000
But let's say for a moment that you were.

51
0:02:58.414,000 --> 0:02:59,000
(Laughter)

52
0:03:00.44,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Bear with me.

53
0:03:02.868,000 --> 0:03:06,000
The first thing you will notice on signing up to one of these sites

54
0:03:07.468,000 --> 0:03:08,000
is how familiar it looks.

55
0:03:10.299,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Every single product --

56
0:03:13.289,000 --> 0:03:14,000
thousands of products --

57
0:03:15.177,000 --> 0:03:19,000
has a glossy, high-res image,

58
0:03:19.217,000 --> 0:03:21,000
a detailed product description, a price.

59
0:03:22.414,000 --> 0:03:25,000
There's a "Proceed to checkout" icon.

60
0:03:25.518,000 --> 0:03:27,000
There is even, most beautifully of all,

61
0:03:28.3,000 --> 0:03:3,000
a "Report this item" button.

62
0:03:30.482,000 --> 0:03:32,000
(Laughter)

63
0:03:33.213,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Incredible.

64
0:03:35.163,000 --> 0:03:37,000
You browse through the site, you make your choice,

65
0:03:37.574,000 --> 0:03:39,000
you pay with the crypto-currency bitcoin,

66
0:03:40.017,000 --> 0:03:43,000
you enter an address -- preferably not your home address --

67
0:03:43.07,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and you wait for your product to arrive in the post,

68
0:03:45.799,000 --> 0:03:47,000
which it nearly always does.

69
0:03:49.281,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And the reason it does is not because of the clever encryption.

70
0:03:53.163,000 --> 0:03:54,000
That's important.

71
0:03:54.674,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Something far simpler than that.

72
0:03:58.027,000 --> 0:03:59,000
It's the user reviews.

73
0:03:59.944,000 --> 0:04:,000
(Laughter)

74
0:04:01.283,000 --> 0:04:04,000
You see, every single vendor on these sites

75
0:04:05.078,000 --> 0:04:07,000
uses a pseudonym, naturally enough,

76
0:04:07.42,000 --> 0:04:1,000
but they keep the same pseudonym to build up a reputation.

77
0:04:11.61,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And because it's easy for the buyer to change allegiance whenever they want,

78
0:04:16.934,000 --> 0:04:2,000
the only way of trusting a vendor

79
0:04:21.231,000 --> 0:04:24,000
is if they have a good history of positive feedback

80
0:04:24.893,000 --> 0:04:25,000
from other users of the site.

81
0:04:27.396,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And this introduction of competition and choice

82
0:04:31.897,000 --> 0:04:35,000
does exactly what the economists would predict.

83
0:04:37.346,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Prices tend to go down, product quality tends to go up,

84
0:04:42.056,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and the vendors are attentive,

85
0:04:44.453,000 --> 0:04:46,000
they're polite, they're consumer-centric,

86
0:04:46.908,000 --> 0:04:5,000
offering you all manner of special deals, one-offs,

87
0:04:51.244,000 --> 0:04:54,000
buy-one-get-one-frees, free delivery,

88
0:04:54.439,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to keep you happy.

89
0:04:56.953,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I spoke to Drugsheaven.

90
0:04:59.895,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Drugsheaven was offering excellent and consistent marijuana

91
0:05:05.809,000 --> 0:05:06,000
at a reasonable price.

92
0:05:08.154,000 --> 0:05:11,000
He had a very generous refund policy,

93
0:05:11.987,000 --> 0:05:12,000
detailed T's and C's,

94
0:05:13.799,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and good shipping times.

95
0:05:15.608,000 --> 0:05:17,000
"Dear Drugsheaven," I wrote,

96
0:05:17.893,000 --> 0:05:2,000
via the internal emailing system that's also encrypted, of course.

97
0:05:22.397,000 --> 0:05:26,000
"I'm new here. Do you mind if I buy just one gram of marijuana?"

98
0:05:27.45,000 --> 0:05:29,000
A couple of hours later, I get a reply.

99
0:05:29.598,000 --> 0:05:3,000
They always reply.

100
0:05:31.23,000 --> 0:05:32,000
"Hi there, thanks for your email.

101
0:05:34.154,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Starting small is a wise thing to do. I would, too, if I were you."

102
0:05:39.446,000 --> 0:05:4,000
(Laughter)

103
0:05:41.232,000 --> 0:05:44,000
"So no problem if you'd like to start with just one gram.

104
0:05:44.377,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I do hope we can do business together.

105
0:05:46.912,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Best wishes, Drugsheaven."

106
0:05:48.799,000 --> 0:05:49,000
(Laughter)

107
0:05:50.799,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I don't know why he had a posh English accent, but I assume he did.

108
0:05:56.279,000 --> 0:06:,000
Now, this kind of consumer-centric attitude

109
0:06:00.799,000 --> 0:06:05,000
is the reason why, when I reviewed 120,000 pieces of feedback

110
0:06:06.259,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that had been left on one of these sites over a three-month period,

111
0:06:10.263,000 --> 0:06:13,000
95 percent of them were five out of five.

112
0:06:14.563,000 --> 0:06:16,000
The customer, you see, is king.

113
0:06:17.799,000 --> 0:06:18,000
But what does that mean?

114
0:06:19.033,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Well, on the one hand,

115
0:06:20.998,000 --> 0:06:24,000
that means there are more drugs, more available, more easily,

116
0:06:25.056,000 --> 0:06:26,000
to more people.

117
0:06:26.799,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And by my reckoning, that is not a good thing.

118
0:06:30.799,000 --> 0:06:33,000
But, on the other hand, if you are going to take drugs,

119
0:06:34.536,000 --> 0:06:37,000
you have a reasonably good way

120
0:06:37.621,000 --> 0:06:41,000
of guaranteeing a certain level of purity and quality,

121
0:06:42.059,000 --> 0:06:45,000
which is incredibly important if you're taking drugs.

122
0:06:45.799,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And you can do so from the comfort of your own home,

123
0:06:48.941,000 --> 0:06:52,000
without the risks associated with buying on the streets.

124
0:06:53.961,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Now, as I said,

125
0:06:55.461,000 --> 0:06:59,000
you've got to be creative and innovative to survive in this marketplace.

126
0:07:00.277,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And the 20 or so sites that are currently in operation --

127
0:07:03.395,000 --> 0:07:06,000
by the way, they don't always work, they're not always perfect;

128
0:07:07.124,000 --> 0:07:09,000
the site that I showed you was shut down 18 months ago,

129
0:07:09.75,000 --> 0:07:14,000
but not before it had turned over a billion dollars' worth of trade.

130
0:07:17.47,000 --> 0:07:18,000
But these markets,

131
0:07:18.647,000 --> 0:07:21,000
because of the difficult conditions in which they are operating,

132
0:07:21.733,000 --> 0:07:22,000
the inhospitable conditions,

133
0:07:23.245,000 --> 0:07:26,000
are always innovating, always thinking of ways of getting smarter,

134
0:07:26.617,000 --> 0:07:28,000
more decentralized, harder to censor,

135
0:07:28.879,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and more customer-friendly.

136
0:07:32.346,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Let's take the payment system.

137
0:07:34.383,000 --> 0:07:35,000
You don't pay with your credit card,

138
0:07:36.205,000 --> 0:07:38,000
of course -- that would lead directly back to you.

139
0:07:38.574,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So you use the crypto-currency bitcoin,

140
0:07:40.575,000 --> 0:07:44,000
which is easily exchanged for real-world currencies

141
0:07:45.054,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and gives quite a high degree of anonymity to its users.

142
0:07:49.367,000 --> 0:07:51,000
But at the beginning of these sites, people noticed a flaw.

143
0:07:52.318,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Some of the unscrupulous dealers were running away with peoples' bitcoin

144
0:07:56.407,000 --> 0:07:57,000
before they'd mailed the drugs out.

145
0:07:59.155,000 --> 0:08:04,000
The community came up with a solution, called multi-signature escrow payments.

146
0:08:07.135,000 --> 0:08:1,000
So on purchasing my item,

147
0:08:10.652,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I would send my bitcoin

148
0:08:13.702,000 --> 0:08:17,000
to a neutral, secure third digital wallet.

149
0:08:18.799,000 --> 0:08:2,000
The vendor, who would see that I'd sent it,

150
0:08:21.412,000 --> 0:08:23,000
would be confident that they could then send the product to me,

151
0:08:24.392,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and then when I received it,

152
0:08:25.799,000 --> 0:08:27,000
at least two of the three people engaged in the transaction --

153
0:08:28.799,000 --> 0:08:3,000
vendor, buyer, site administrator --

154
0:08:31.363,000 --> 0:08:33,000
would have to sign the transaction off

155
0:08:33.799,000 --> 0:08:35,000
with a unique digital signature,

156
0:08:35.901,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and then the money would be transferred.

157
0:08:38.263,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Brilliant!

158
0:08:39.587,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Elegant.

159
0:08:40.762,000 --> 0:08:41,000
It works.

160
0:08:42.877,000 --> 0:08:44,000
But then they realized there was a problem with bitcoin,

161
0:08:45.552,000 --> 0:08:46,000
because every bitcoin transaction

162
0:08:47.277,000 --> 0:08:49,000
is actually recorded publicly in a public ledger.

163
0:08:49.799,000 --> 0:08:52,000
So if you're clever, you can try and work out who's behind them.

164
0:08:53.1,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So they came up with a tumbling service.

165
0:08:56.409,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Hundreds of people send their bitcoin into one address,

166
0:08:59.824,000 --> 0:09:,000
they're tumbled and jumbled up,

167
0:09:01.823,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and then the right amount is sent on to the right recipients,

168
0:09:05.637,000 --> 0:09:06,000
but they're different bitcoins:

169
0:09:07.483,000 --> 0:09:08,000
micro-laundering systems.

170
0:09:09.197,000 --> 0:09:1,000
(Laughter)

171
0:09:10.755,000 --> 0:09:11,000
It's incredible.

172
0:09:11.935,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Interested in what drugs are trending right now on the dark net markets?

173
0:09:17.152,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Check Grams, the search engine.

174
0:09:19.253,000 --> 0:09:21,000
You can even buy some advertising space.

175
0:09:21.442,000 --> 0:09:23,000
(Laughter)

176
0:09:23.531,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Are you an ethical consumer worried about what the drugs industry is doing?

177
0:09:29.064,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Yeah.

178
0:09:30.592,000 --> 0:09:33,000
One vendor will offer you fair trade organic cocaine.

179
0:09:34.01,000 --> 0:09:35,000
(Laughter)

180
0:09:35.176,000 --> 0:09:38,000
That's not being sourced from Colombian druglords,

181
0:09:38.495,000 --> 0:09:39,000
but Guatemalan farmers.

182
0:09:39.948,000 --> 0:09:42,000
They even promised to reinvest 20 percent of any profits

183
0:09:43.284,000 --> 0:09:44,000
into local education programs.

184
0:09:45.098,000 --> 0:09:46,000
(Laughter)

185
0:09:46.144,000 --> 0:09:47,000
There's even a mystery shopper.

186
0:09:48.936,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Now, whatever you think about the morality of these sites --

187
0:09:52.344,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and I submit that it's not actually an easy question --

188
0:09:55.683,000 --> 0:10:,000
the creation of functioning, competitive, anonymous markets,

189
0:10:01.209,000 --> 0:10:03,000
where nobody knows who anybody else is,

190
0:10:03.799,000 --> 0:10:06,000
constantly at risk of being shut down by the authorities,

191
0:10:06.922,000 --> 0:10:08,000
is a staggering achievement,

192
0:10:09.48,000 --> 0:10:11,000
a phenomenal achievement.

193
0:10:12.579,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And it's that kind of innovation

194
0:10:16.017,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that's why those on the fringes

195
0:10:18.799,000 --> 0:10:2,000
are often the harbingers of what is to come.

196
0:10:22.36,000 --> 0:10:24,000
It's easy to forget

197
0:10:24.488,000 --> 0:10:26,000
that because of its short life,

198
0:10:26.574,000 --> 0:10:29,000
the Internet has actually changed many times

199
0:10:30.245,000 --> 0:10:31,000
over the last 30 years or so.

200
0:10:31.799,000 --> 0:10:33,000
It started in the '70s as a military project,

201
0:10:34.799,000 --> 0:10:37,000
morphed in the 1980s to an academic network,

202
0:10:38.799,000 --> 0:10:4,000
co-opted by commercial companies in the '90s,

203
0:10:41.285,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and then invaded by all of us via social media in the noughties,

204
0:10:44.764,000 --> 0:10:45,000
but I think it's going to change again.

205
0:10:47.179,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And I think things like the dark net markets --

206
0:10:49.799,000 --> 0:10:52,000
creative, secure, difficult to censor --

207
0:10:53.799,000 --> 0:10:54,000
I think that's the future.

208
0:10:56.929,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And the reason it's the future

209
0:10:58.581,000 --> 0:11:,000
is because we're all worried about our privacy.

210
0:11:01.273,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Surveys consistently show concerns about privacy.

211
0:11:04.522,000 --> 0:11:07,000
The more time we spend online, the more we worry about them,

212
0:11:08.505,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and those surveys show our worries are growing.

213
0:11:10.799,000 --> 0:11:12,000
We're worried about what happens to our data.

214
0:11:12.939,000 --> 0:11:14,000
We're worried about who might be watching us.

215
0:11:15.072,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Since the revelations from Edward Snowden,

216
0:11:17.664,000 --> 0:11:19,000
there's been a huge increase in the number of people

217
0:11:20.134,000 --> 0:11:23,000
using various privacy-enhancing tools.

218
0:11:23.25,000 --> 0:11:26,000
There are now between two and three million daily users

219
0:11:26.511,000 --> 0:11:27,000
of the Tor browser,

220
0:11:27.81,000 --> 0:11:32,000
the majority of which use is perfectly legitimate,

221
0:11:33.001,000 --> 0:11:34,000
sometimes even mundane.

222
0:11:35.658,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And there are hundreds of activists around the world

223
0:11:38.833,000 --> 0:11:43,000
working on techniques and tools to keep you private online --

224
0:11:45.111,000 --> 0:11:47,000
default encrypted messaging services.

225
0:11:47.616,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Ethereum, which is a project which tries to link up

226
0:11:51.663,000 --> 0:11:56,000
the connected but unused hard drives of millions of computers around the world,

227
0:11:56.765,000 --> 0:11:59,000
to create a sort of distributed Internet that no one really controls.

228
0:12:00.66,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Now, we've had distributed computing before, of course.

229
0:12:03.577,000 --> 0:12:07,000
We use it for everything from Skype to the search for extraterrestrial life.

230
0:12:07.799,000 --> 0:12:11,000
But you add distributed computing and powerful encryption --

231
0:12:12.312,000 --> 0:12:15,000
that's very, very hard to censor and control.

232
0:12:16.625,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Another called MaidSafe works on similar principles.

233
0:12:19.462,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Another called Twister, and so on and so on.

234
0:12:23.396,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And here's the thing --

235
0:12:25.41,000 --> 0:12:26,000
the more of us join,

236
0:12:26.898,000 --> 0:12:28,000
the more interesting those sites become,

237
0:12:29.373,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and then the more of us join, and so on.

238
0:12:32.268,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And I think that's what's going to happen.

239
0:12:34.317,000 --> 0:12:36,000
In fact, it's already happening.

240
0:12:36.489,000 --> 0:12:39,000
The dark net is no longer a den for dealers

241
0:12:40.389,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and a hideout for whistle-blowers.

242
0:12:42.98,000 --> 0:12:43,000
It's already going mainstream.

243
0:12:45.698,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Just recently, the musician Aphex Twin released his album as a dark net site.

244
0:12:52.296,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Facebook has started a dark net site.

245
0:12:56.273,000 --> 0:12:59,000
A group of London architects have opened a dark net site

246
0:12:59.93,000 --> 0:13:01,000
for people worried about regeneration projects.

247
0:13:02.799,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Yes, the dark net is going mainstream,

248
0:13:05.396,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and I predict that fairly soon, every social media company,

249
0:13:09.037,000 --> 0:13:1,000
every major news outlet,

250
0:13:10.496,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and therefore most of you in this audience,

251
0:13:13.604,000 --> 0:13:15,000
will be using the dark net, too.

252
0:13:16.942,000 --> 0:13:19,000
So the Internet is about to get more interesting,

253
0:13:19.995,000 --> 0:13:21,000
more exciting, more innovative,

254
0:13:22.799,000 --> 0:13:23,000
more terrible,

255
0:13:24.548,000 --> 0:13:25,000
more destructive.

256
0:13:27.14,000 --> 0:13:29,000
That's good news if you care about liberty.

257
0:13:29.437,000 --> 0:13:3,000
It's good news if you care about freedom.

258
0:13:31.431,000 --> 0:13:33,000
It's good news if you care about democracy.

259
0:13:33.574,000 --> 0:13:34,000
It's also good news

260
0:13:34.976,000 --> 0:13:36,000
if you want to browse for illegal pornography

261
0:13:37.446,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and if you want to buy and sell drugs

262
0:13:39.799,000 --> 0:13:4,000
with impunity.

263
0:13:41.876,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Neither entirely dark, nor entirely light.

264
0:13:45.799,000 --> 0:13:48,000
It's not one side or the other that's going to win out, but both.

265
0:13:50.352,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Thank you very much, indeed.

266
0:13:52.24,000 --> 0:13:55,000
(Applause)

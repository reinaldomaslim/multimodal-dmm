0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:15,000
June 13, 2014

2
0:00:16.32,000 --> 0:00:18,000
started as a routine Friday

3
0:00:18.72,000 --> 0:00:21,000
in Redemption Hospital in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia.

4
0:00:23.12,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Redemption is the largest free public health hospital in the city.

5
0:00:27.24,000 --> 0:00:3,000
We are called upon to serve hundreds of thousands of people.

6
0:00:31.32,000 --> 0:00:33,000
In the best of times it puts strain on our resources.

7
0:00:34.88,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Monthly supplies run out within weeks,

8
0:00:36.92,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and patients without beds would be seated in chairs.

9
0:00:40.72,000 --> 0:00:43,000
That summer, we had a nurse who had been sick for a while.

10
0:00:43.8,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Sick enough to be admitted in our hospital.

11
0:00:46.88,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But our treatment didn't seem to be helping her;

12
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
her symptoms were getting worse:

13
0:00:50.76,000 --> 0:00:53,000
diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, fever and weakness.

14
0:00:55.44,000 --> 0:00:59,000
On that particular Friday, she developed severe respiratory distress,

15
0:00:59.6,000 --> 0:01:,000
and her eyes were menacingly red.

16
0:01:03.04,000 --> 0:01:05,000
One of my fellow doctors, a general surgeon,

17
0:01:05.72,000 --> 0:01:06,000
became suspicious of her condition.

18
0:01:07.48,000 --> 0:01:09,000
He said her symptoms were suggestive of Ebola.

19
0:01:11.2,000 --> 0:01:14,000
We kept a close watch on her, we tried to help her.

20
0:01:14.24,000 --> 0:01:18,000
We were treating her for malaria, typhoid and gastroenteritis.

21
0:01:18.92,000 --> 0:01:2,000
We didn't know it, but by then it was too late.

22
0:01:23.6,000 --> 0:01:25,000
The next morning I walked in to check on my patient.

23
0:01:26.08,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I could tell by the look in her eyes that she was filled with fear.

24
0:01:29.96,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I gave her reassurance, but shortly after ...

25
0:01:33.68,000 --> 0:01:34,000
she died of Ebola.

26
0:01:37.96,000 --> 0:01:39,000
For me, her death was very personal.

27
0:01:40.2,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But this was just the beginning.

28
0:01:42.64,000 --> 0:01:45,000
A virtual biological bomb had exploded.

29
0:01:46.84,000 --> 0:01:5,000
But the word spread faster than the virus, and panic spread across the hospital.

30
0:01:52.56,000 --> 0:01:55,000
All the patients ran away.

31
0:01:56.56,000 --> 0:02:,000
Then, all the nurses and doctors ran away.

32
0:02:02.4,000 --> 0:02:04,000
This was the beginning of our medical tsunami --

33
0:02:05.28,000 --> 0:02:06,000
the devastating Ebola virus

34
0:02:07.12,000 --> 0:02:09,000
that left an indelible scar in our country's history.

35
0:02:10.6,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I was not trained for this.

36
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I had just graduated from medical school two years before.

37
0:02:16.72,000 --> 0:02:17,000
At this time,

38
0:02:18.68,000 --> 0:02:21,000
my total knowledge about Ebola came from a one-page article

39
0:02:21.8,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I had read in medical school.

40
0:02:24.48,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I perceived the disease as so dangerous,

41
0:02:27.36,000 --> 0:02:31,000
this one page in essence had convinced me to run out of the hospital, too,

42
0:02:32.28,000 --> 0:02:33,000
the moment I heard of a case of Ebola.

43
0:02:34.92,000 --> 0:02:37,000
But when it finally happened, I stayed on and decided to help.

44
0:02:38.72,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And so did several other brave health care professionals.

45
0:02:43.2,000 --> 0:02:45,000
But we would pay a heavy price.

46
0:02:45.4,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Many persons and health professionals had become high-risk contacts.

47
0:02:49.36,000 --> 0:02:53,000
This actually meant 21 days counting to potentially disease or death.

48
0:02:55.24,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Our health systems were fragile,

49
0:02:57.32,000 --> 0:02:59,000
our health workers lacked skills and training.

50
0:03:00.96,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So in the weeks and months that followed,

51
0:03:02.96,000 --> 0:03:06,000
health workers were disproportionately affected by the Ebola virus disease.

52
0:03:07.36,000 --> 0:03:12,000
More than 400 nurses, doctors and other health professionals became infected.

53
0:03:13.24,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Unfortunately, my friend, the general surgeon

54
0:03:16.68,000 --> 0:03:19,000
who correctly identified the symptoms in that first case

55
0:03:20.56,000 --> 0:03:21,000
became one of the casualties.

56
0:03:26.04,000 --> 0:03:28,000
On July 27, the president of Liberia

57
0:03:28.76,000 --> 0:03:31,000
imposed quarantine on the worst-affected areas.

58
0:03:32.96,000 --> 0:03:34,000
She closed all the schools and universities

59
0:03:35.28,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and shut down many public events.

60
0:03:37.32,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Four days later,

61
0:03:39.08,000 --> 0:03:4,000
the United States Peace Corps

62
0:03:40.96,000 --> 0:03:44,000
pulled out of Liberia, out of Sierra Leone and Guinea

63
0:03:45,000 --> 0:03:46,000
due to Ebola.

64
0:03:47.76,000 --> 0:03:5,000
In August, six weeks after the nurse died,

65
0:03:51.04,000 --> 0:03:54,000
hundreds of people were dying of the disease each week.

66
0:03:54.12,000 --> 0:03:55,000
People were dying in the streets.

67
0:03:56.72,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Over the months that followed,

68
0:03:58.2,000 --> 0:04:01,000
West Africa would lose thousands of people to Ebola virus disease.

69
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:06,000
In August, I joined a team to set up the Ebola treatment unit

70
0:04:06.24,000 --> 0:04:08,000
at JFK hospital in Monrovia.

71
0:04:08.8,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I was charged with running the second Ebola treatment unit in the city.

72
0:04:13.36,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Our unit provided hope for thousands of patients, families and communities.

73
0:04:19.12,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I not only provided care, I came face to face with Ebola.

74
0:04:23.56,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Living every day as a high-risk Ebola virus disease contact

75
0:04:27.68,000 --> 0:04:28,000
during the worst of the outbreak

76
0:04:29.32,000 --> 0:04:3,000
was one of my worst experiences.

77
0:04:31.079,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I started counting 21 days every day.

78
0:04:33.92,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I lived every moment anticipating the onset of symptoms of the disease.

79
0:04:38.48,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I measured my body temperature several times.

80
0:04:41.44,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I showered with chlorinated water,

81
0:04:43.6,000 --> 0:04:45,000
more concentrated than actually recommended.

82
0:04:46.08,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I chlorinated my phones, my pants, my hands, my car.

83
0:04:49.96,000 --> 0:04:5,000
My clothes became bleached.

84
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Those days you were alone,

85
0:04:55.8,000 --> 0:04:58,000
people were so afraid of touching anybody.

86
0:04:58.96,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Everyone was counted as a potential contact.

87
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Touching would make them sick.

88
0:05:03.72,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I was stigmatized.

89
0:05:05.6,000 --> 0:05:09,000
But if that was what it was for me, who was symptom-free,

90
0:05:09.64,000 --> 0:05:12,000
imagine what it was for someone who actually had symptoms,

91
0:05:13.56,000 --> 0:05:14,000
someone who had Ebola.

92
0:05:18.4,000 --> 0:05:2,000
We learned that to treat Ebola successfully,

93
0:05:20.92,000 --> 0:05:22,000
we had to suspend some of the normal rules of society.

94
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Our president declared a state of emergency in August

95
0:05:28.2,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and suspended certain rights.

96
0:05:30.48,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And the national police even supported our work during the Ebola response.

97
0:05:36.96,000 --> 0:05:39,000
In February 2015, gang members came in for isolation

98
0:05:40.36,000 --> 0:05:41,000
in our Ebola isolation unit.

99
0:05:43.04,000 --> 0:05:45,000
They were also know as the VIP Boys of Monrovia,

100
0:05:45.92,000 --> 0:05:47,000
terrifying small-time drug addicts

101
0:05:48.32,000 --> 0:05:5,000
whose presence could instill a tremendous amount of fear,

102
0:05:51.2,000 --> 0:05:53,000
although they could not legally carry guns.

103
0:05:56.96,000 --> 0:05:59,000
They underwent quarantine for 21 days in our unit and were not arrested.

104
0:06:00.88,000 --> 0:06:01,000
We told the police,

105
0:06:03.88,000 --> 0:06:04,000
"If you arrest them here,

106
0:06:07.32,000 --> 0:06:09,000
they will stop coming, they won't get treated.

107
0:06:10.96,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And the Ebola virus will continue to spread."

108
0:06:14.44,000 --> 0:06:16,000
The police agreed, and we were able to treat the VIP Boys,

109
0:06:17.4,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and they did not have to worry about being arrested while in the unit.

110
0:06:22.48,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Over the course of the outbreak, West Africa had almost 29,000 cases.

111
0:06:27.6,000 --> 0:06:3,000
More than 11,000 people died.

112
0:06:30.8,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And that included 12 of my fine colleagues at John F. Kennedy hospital in Monrovia.

113
0:06:46.64,000 --> 0:06:51,000
In June 2016, exactly 23 months after my first Ebola patient died,

114
0:06:52.2,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Liberia declared its Ebola outbreak ended.

115
0:06:55.8,000 --> 0:06:57,000
We thought that once the outbreak ended,

116
0:06:58.24,000 --> 0:06:59,000
so did the problems.

117
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
We hoped that life would go back to normal.

118
0:07:03.44,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Today, there are more than 17,000 survivors in West Africa.

119
0:07:07.68,000 --> 0:07:09,000
People who actually had Ebola virus disease,

120
0:07:10.4,000 --> 0:07:12,000
lived through it and survived.

121
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
We counted survival rate as a success:

122
0:07:16.88,000 --> 0:07:19,000
the end of suffering for the patient and fulfilling joy for families.

123
0:07:20.32,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Every discharge from the unit was a moment of jubilation.

124
0:07:23.72,000 --> 0:07:24,000
At least so we thought.

125
0:07:26.8,000 --> 0:07:28,000
The best description of the moment of discharge

126
0:07:29.2,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and a rare glimpse into the moment that defines our life post-Ebola

127
0:07:33.12,000 --> 0:07:35,000
was vividly expressed in the words of my best friend

128
0:07:35.92,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and fellow doctor, Philip Ireland, in an interview with "The Times."

129
0:07:40.8,000 --> 0:07:42,000
He said at the time of his release,

130
0:07:43.08,000 --> 0:07:46,000
"There were a lot of people there from JFK hospital:

131
0:07:46.6,000 --> 0:07:49,000
my family, my elder brother, my wife was there.

132
0:07:50.28,000 --> 0:07:53,000
A lot of other doctors were there, too, and members of the media were there.

133
0:07:54.24,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And I felt like Nelson Mandela, it felt like the 'Long Walk to Freedom,'

134
0:07:58.52,000 --> 0:08:,000
and I walked and raised my hands to the heaven,

135
0:08:00.76,000 --> 0:08:02,000
thanking God for saving my life."

136
0:08:04.68,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And Philip said, "Then I saw something else.

137
0:08:07.76,000 --> 0:08:1,000
There were a lot of crying people, people happy to see me.

138
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:15,000
But when I got close to anybody, they backed away."

139
0:08:17.32,000 --> 0:08:2,000
For many Ebola survivors, society still seems to be backing away,

140
0:08:20.76,000 --> 0:08:22,000
even as they struggle to lead a normal life.

141
0:08:23.2,000 --> 0:08:27,000
For these survivors, life can be compared to another health emergency.

142
0:08:29.12,000 --> 0:08:31,000
They may suffer debilitating joint and body pain.

143
0:08:32.12,000 --> 0:08:34,000
The suffering gradually decays over time for most.

144
0:08:34.52,000 --> 0:08:38,000
However, many continue to bear intermittent pain.

145
0:08:39.4,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Some survivors are blind, others have neurological disabilities.

146
0:08:44.28,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Some survivors experience stigmatization every day, in many ways.

147
0:08:48.36,000 --> 0:08:49,000
A lot of children are orphans.

148
0:08:50.24,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Some survivors experience post-traumatic stress disorder.

149
0:08:54.12,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And some survivors lack opportunity for education.

150
0:08:59.08,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Even families can be split apart by fear of Ebola, too.

151
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
There's no definitive cure for transmitting Ebola virus through sex.

152
0:09:07.56,000 --> 0:09:11,000
However, there are successful interventions for prevention.

153
0:09:12.64,000 --> 0:09:14,000
We have worked hard on semen testing,

154
0:09:15.36,000 --> 0:09:18,000
behavioral counseling, safe sex promotion and research.

155
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
For the past year, there have been no cases of sexual transmission.

156
0:09:23.84,000 --> 0:09:25,000
But some male survivors have lost their spouses

157
0:09:26.2,000 --> 0:09:28,000
out of fear they will be infected with Ebola.

158
0:09:28.76,000 --> 0:09:3,000
That's how families are torn apart.

159
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Another tremendous challenge for Ebola survivors

160
0:09:35.44,000 --> 0:09:36,000
is obtaining adequate health care.

161
0:09:37.96,000 --> 0:09:42,000
In theory, Liberia's public health services are free of charge.

162
0:09:43.48,000 --> 0:09:47,000
In practice, our health system lacks the funding and capacity

163
0:09:47.92,000 --> 0:09:49,000
to expand care to all at the point of need.

164
0:09:53.12,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Many survivors have waited many months to undergo surgery

165
0:09:56.32,000 --> 0:09:57,000
to heal their blinding cataracts.

166
0:09:59.2,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Few had to relive the traumatic experience,

167
0:10:01.88,000 --> 0:10:04,000
when their blood was retested for Ebola at the point of admission.

168
0:10:05.44,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Some survivors experienced delayed or deferred admission

169
0:10:08.68,000 --> 0:10:09,000
due to limited bed capacity.

170
0:10:10.92,000 --> 0:10:12,000
No bed available for one more patient.

171
0:10:14.12,000 --> 0:10:18,000
This is neither national policy nor officially condoned,

172
0:10:18.24,000 --> 0:10:22,000
but many people are still afraid of the sporadic resurgence of Ebola virus.

173
0:10:23.84,000 --> 0:10:24,000
The results can be tragic.

174
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I have seen Beatrice, an Ebola survivor, several times now.

175
0:10:29.8,000 --> 0:10:3,000
She's 26 years old.

176
0:10:32.44,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Many of her family members became infected, she luckily survived.

177
0:10:36.52,000 --> 0:10:39,000
But since that day in 2014 she was discharged

178
0:10:39.76,000 --> 0:10:4,000
to cheering health workers,

179
0:10:41.12,000 --> 0:10:42,000
her life has never been the same.

180
0:10:42.96,000 --> 0:10:44,000
She became blind as the result of Ebola.

181
0:10:47.76,000 --> 0:10:5,000
In 2014, the baby of a dear friend of mine was only two months old,

182
0:10:51.44,000 --> 0:10:55,000
when both parents and child were admitted in an Ebola treatment unit in Monrovia.

183
0:10:55.8,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Luckily, they survived.

184
0:10:58.48,000 --> 0:11:,000
My friend's baby is almost three years old now,

185
0:11:01.08,000 --> 0:11:04,000
but cannot stand, cannot walk, cannot speak.

186
0:11:04.32,000 --> 0:11:05,000
He has failure to thrive.

187
0:11:06.76,000 --> 0:11:1,000
There are many more hidden experiences and many stories are yet untold.

188
0:11:13.44,000 --> 0:11:17,000
The survivors of Ebola deserve our attention and support.

189
0:11:20.12,000 --> 0:11:22,000
The only way we can defeat this pandemic

190
0:11:22.76,000 --> 0:11:24,000
is when we ensure that we win this final battle.

191
0:11:26.44,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Our best opportunity is to ensure

192
0:11:28.36,000 --> 0:11:32,000
that every survivor receives adequate care at the point of need

193
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
without any form of stigma and at no cost to them personally.

194
0:11:37.32,000 --> 0:11:4,000
How can a society consider itself healed

195
0:11:42.08,000 --> 0:11:44,000
when a person's entire identity

196
0:11:44.24,000 --> 0:11:47,000
is defined by the fact that they recovered from Ebola?

197
0:11:47.28,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Should a previous disease that a person no longer has

198
0:11:50.28,000 --> 0:11:52,000
become the sum total of their identity,

199
0:11:52.92,000 --> 0:11:54,000
the identifier in their passport

200
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that deters you from traveling to seek medical care abroad?

201
0:11:58.88,000 --> 0:12:,000
Simply the ID that denies you health care.

202
0:12:01.36,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Or prevents you from having a relationship with your spouse.

203
0:12:04.64,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Or denies you of family, of friend or home.

204
0:12:08.12,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Or prevents you from carrying on your normal job,

205
0:12:10.88,000 --> 0:12:13,000
so you can put food on the table or have a roof over your family's head.

206
0:12:15.68,000 --> 0:12:18,000
What is the meaning of the right to life

207
0:12:18.72,000 --> 0:12:21,000
when our life is clouded by stigma and barriers that fuel that stigma?

208
0:12:23.36,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Until we have much better answers to those questions in West Africa,

209
0:12:27.28,000 --> 0:12:28,000
our work is not over yet.

210
0:12:31.84,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Liberians are a resilient people.

211
0:12:35.96,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And we know how to rise to a challenge, even a devastating one.

212
0:12:41.36,000 --> 0:12:42,000
My best memories of the outbreak

213
0:12:42.96,000 --> 0:12:44,000
center on those many people who survived the disease,

214
0:12:45.68,000 --> 0:12:5,000
but I cannot forget the hard-working nurses, doctors, volunteers and staff

215
0:12:51.04,000 --> 0:12:54,000
who risked their own safety in service of humanity.

216
0:12:54.64,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And some even losing their lives in the process.

217
0:12:59.4,000 --> 0:13:,000
During the worst of the contagion,

218
0:13:01.36,000 --> 0:13:05,000
one thing kept us making those perilous daily journeys into the Ebola wards.

219
0:13:06.36,000 --> 0:13:08,000
We had a passion to save lives.

220
0:13:11.64,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Was I afraid during the Ebola outbreak?

221
0:13:13.64,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Of course I was.

222
0:13:16.68,000 --> 0:13:2,000
But for me, the opportunity to protect our global health security

223
0:13:21.28,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and keep communities safe at home and abroad was an honor.

224
0:13:26.12,000 --> 0:13:29,000
So as the dangers became greater, our humanity became stronger.

225
0:13:30.88,000 --> 0:13:31,000
We faced our fears.

226
0:13:34.36,000 --> 0:13:38,000
The global health community working together defeated Ebola,

227
0:13:38.72,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and that ...

228
0:13:40.64,000 --> 0:13:43,000
that is how I know

229
0:13:44.12,000 --> 0:13:47,000
that we can defeat its aftermath

230
0:13:47.88,000 --> 0:13:51,000
in our hearts, in our minds and in our communities.

231
0:13:53.6,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Thank you.

232
0:13:54.84,000 --> 0:13:58,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:25.56,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Charles Van Doren, who was later a senior editor of Britannica,

2
0:00:28.719,000 --> 0:00:31,000
said the ideal encyclopedia should be radical --

3
0:00:31.92,000 --> 0:00:32,000
it should stop being safe.

4
0:00:33.48,000 --> 0:00:36,000
But if you know anything about the history of Britannica since 1962,

5
0:00:36.72,000 --> 0:00:37,000
it was anything but radical:

6
0:00:38.08,000 --> 0:00:42,000
still a very completely safe, stodgy type of encyclopedia.

7
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Wikipedia, on the other hand, begins with a very radical idea,

8
0:00:47.2,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and that's for all of us to imagine a world

9
0:00:49.24,000 --> 0:00:51,000
in which every single person on the planet

10
0:00:51.28,000 --> 0:00:53,000
is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge.

11
0:00:53.88,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And that's what we're doing.

12
0:00:56,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So Wikipedia --

13
0:00:57.183,000 --> 0:00:59,000
you just saw the little demonstration of it --

14
0:00:59.64,000 --> 0:01:01,000
it's a freely licensed encyclopedia.

15
0:01:01.76,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It's written by thousands of volunteers

16
0:01:03.642,000 --> 0:01:05,000
all over the world in many, many languages.

17
0:01:06.32,000 --> 0:01:07,000
It's written using wiki software --

18
0:01:08.08,000 --> 0:01:1,000
which is the type of software he just demonstrated --

19
0:01:10.66,000 --> 0:01:11,000
so anyone can quickly edit and save,

20
0:01:12.399,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and it goes live on the Internet immediately.

21
0:01:15.64,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And everything about Wikipedia is managed by virtually an all-volunteer staff.

22
0:01:20.28,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So when Yochai is talking about new methods of organization,

23
0:01:24.72,000 --> 0:01:26,000
he's exactly describing Wikipedia.

24
0:01:27.24,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And what I'm going to do today

25
0:01:28.693,000 --> 0:01:31,000
is tell you a little bit more about how it really works on the inside.

26
0:01:32.96,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So Wikipedia's owned by the Wikimedia Foundation,

27
0:01:36.12,000 --> 0:01:37,000
which I founded,

28
0:01:37.36,000 --> 0:01:38,000
a nonprofit organization.

29
0:01:38.8,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And our goal, the core aim of the Wikimedia Foundation,

30
0:01:42.84,000 --> 0:01:45,000
is to get a free encyclopedia to every single person on the planet.

31
0:01:46.04,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And so, if you think about what that means,

32
0:01:48.08,000 --> 0:01:5,000
it means a lot more than just building a cool website.

33
0:01:50.64,000 --> 0:01:53,000
We're really interested in all the issues of the digital divide,

34
0:01:53.68,000 --> 0:01:54,000
poverty worldwide,

35
0:01:55.28,000 --> 0:01:58,000
empowering people everywhere to have the information that they need

36
0:01:58.68,000 --> 0:01:59,000
to make good decisions.

37
0:01:59.92,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And so we're going to have to do a lot of work

38
0:02:02.52,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that goes beyond just the Internet.

39
0:02:04.24,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And so that's a big part of why we've chosen the free licensing model,

40
0:02:07.56,000 --> 0:02:1,000
because that empowers local entrepreneurs or anyone who wants to --

41
0:02:10.823,000 --> 0:02:12,000
they can take our content and do anything they like with it --

42
0:02:13.759,000 --> 0:02:14,000
you can copy it, redistribute it --

43
0:02:15.465,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and you can do it commercially or non-commercially.

44
0:02:17.901,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So there's a lot of opportunities that are going to arise around Wikipedia

45
0:02:21.425,000 --> 0:02:22,000
all over the world.

46
0:02:23.48,000 --> 0:02:25,000
We're funded by donations from the public,

47
0:02:25.52,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and one of the more interesting things about that

48
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:31,000
is how little money it actually takes to run Wikipedia.

49
0:02:31.84,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So Yochai showed you the graph of what the cost of a printing press was.

50
0:02:36.4,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And I'm going to tell you what the cost of Wikipedia is.

51
0:02:39.76,000 --> 0:02:4,000
But first, I'll show you how big it is.

52
0:02:41.642,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So we've got over 600,000 articles in English.

53
0:02:46.04,000 --> 0:02:5,000
We've got two million total articles across many, many different languages.

54
0:02:50.52,000 --> 0:02:53,000
The biggest languages are German, Japanese, French --

55
0:02:53.8,000 --> 0:02:56,000
all the Western-European languages are quite big.

56
0:02:57.52,000 --> 0:03:,000
But only around one-third of all of our traffic to our web

57
0:03:00.92,000 --> 0:03:01,000
clusters to the English Wikipedia,

58
0:03:02.58,000 --> 0:03:03,000
which is surprising to a lot of people.

59
0:03:04.462,000 --> 0:03:07,000
A lot of people think in a very English-centric way on the Internet,

60
0:03:07.84,000 --> 0:03:08,000
but for us, we're truly global.

61
0:03:09.76,000 --> 0:03:1,000
We're in many, many languages.

62
0:03:11.88,000 --> 0:03:14,000
How popular we've gotten to be -- we're a top-50 website

63
0:03:15.04,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and we're more popular than the New York Times.

64
0:03:17.255,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So this is where we get to Yochai's discussion.

65
0:03:21.96,000 --> 0:03:24,000
This shows the growth of Wikipedia -- we're the blue line there --

66
0:03:25.32,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and this is the New York Times over there.

67
0:03:28.04,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And what's interesting about this

68
0:03:29.64,000 --> 0:03:33,000
is the New York Times website is a huge, enormous corporate operation

69
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:36,000
with I have no idea how many hundreds of employees.

70
0:03:36.52,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We have exactly one employee,

71
0:03:38.56,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and that employee is our lead software developer.

72
0:03:41.2,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And he's only been our employee since January 2005,

73
0:03:44.4,000 --> 0:03:45,000
all the other growth before that ...

74
0:03:46.24,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So the servers are managed by a ragtag band of volunteers.

75
0:03:49.88,000 --> 0:03:5,000
All the editing is done by volunteers.

76
0:03:51.88,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And the way that we're organized

77
0:03:53.44,000 --> 0:03:55,000
is not like any traditional organization you can imagine.

78
0:03:56.147,000 --> 0:03:58,000
People are always asking, "Well, who's in charge of this?"

79
0:03:58.886,000 --> 0:03:59,000
or "Who does that?"

80
0:04:00.08,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And the answer is: anybody who wants to pitch in.

81
0:04:02.4,000 --> 0:04:05,000
It's a very unusual and chaotic thing.

82
0:04:06.48,000 --> 0:04:08,000
We've got over 90 servers now in three locations.

83
0:04:08.8,000 --> 0:04:13,000
These are managed by volunteer system administrators who are online.

84
0:04:14.08,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I can go online any time of the day or night

85
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and see eight to 10 people waiting for me

86
0:04:20.48,000 --> 0:04:23,000
to ask a question or something, anything about the servers.

87
0:04:24.04,000 --> 0:04:26,000
You could never afford to do this in a company.

88
0:04:26.4,000 --> 0:04:27,000
You could never afford

89
0:04:27.64,000 --> 0:04:3,000
to have a standby crew of people 24 hours a day

90
0:04:31.4,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and do what we're doing at Wikipedia.

91
0:04:34.48,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So we're doing around 1.4 billion page views monthly,

92
0:04:37.72,000 --> 0:04:39,000
so it's really gotten to be a huge thing.

93
0:04:40.36,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And everything is managed by the volunteers.

94
0:04:42.76,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And the total monthly cost for our bandwidth is about 5,000 dollars.

95
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And that's essentially our main cost.

96
0:04:48.96,000 --> 0:04:5,000
We could actually do without the employee.

97
0:04:51.24,000 --> 0:04:55,000
We hired Brian because he was working part-time for two years

98
0:04:55.68,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and full-time at Wikipedia,

99
0:04:57,000 --> 0:04:58,000
so we actually hired him,

100
0:04:58.24,000 --> 0:05:,000
so he could get a life and go to the movies sometimes.

101
0:05:01.955,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So the big question when you've got this really chaotic organization is,

102
0:05:05.36,000 --> 0:05:06,000
why isn't it all rubbish?

103
0:05:06.6,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Why is the website as good as it is?

104
0:05:08.995,000 --> 0:05:09,000
First of all, how good is it?

105
0:05:10.4,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Well, it's pretty good.

106
0:05:11.96,000 --> 0:05:12,000
It isn't perfect,

107
0:05:13.2,000 --> 0:05:15,000
but it's much better than you would expect,

108
0:05:15.24,000 --> 0:05:16,000
given our completely chaotic model.

109
0:05:16.947,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So when you saw him make a ridiculous edit to the page about me,

110
0:05:19.987,000 --> 0:05:22,000
you think, "Oh, this is obviously just going to degenerate into rubbish."

111
0:05:23.76,000 --> 0:05:24,000
But when we've seen quality tests --

112
0:05:25.515,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and there haven't been enough of these yet

113
0:05:27.555,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and I'm really encouraging people to do more,

114
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
comparing Wikipedia to traditional things --

115
0:05:32.32,000 --> 0:05:33,000
we win hands down.

116
0:05:34.12,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So a German magazine compared German Wikipedia,

117
0:05:36.88,000 --> 0:05:39,000
which is much, much smaller than English,

118
0:05:40.24,000 --> 0:05:44,000
to Microsoft Encarta and to Brockhaus multimedial,

119
0:05:44.36,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and we won across the board.

120
0:05:45.84,000 --> 0:05:48,000
They hired experts to come and look at articles and compare the quality,

121
0:05:49.245,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and we were very pleased with that result.

122
0:05:52.32,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So a lot of people have heard about the Wikipedia Bush-Kerry controversy.

123
0:05:57.88,000 --> 0:05:59,000
The media has covered this somewhat extensively.

124
0:06:00.56,000 --> 0:06:02,000
It started out with an article in Red Herring.

125
0:06:03.4,000 --> 0:06:04,000
The reporters called me up and they --

126
0:06:05.24,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I mean, I have to say they spelled my name right,

127
0:06:08.24,000 --> 0:06:12,000
but they really wanted to say the Bush-Kerry election is so contentious,

128
0:06:13.2,000 --> 0:06:15,000
it's tearing apart the Wikipedia community.

129
0:06:15.6,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And so they quote me as saying,

130
0:06:17.12,000 --> 0:06:19,000
"They're the most contentious in the history of Wikipedia."

131
0:06:20.04,000 --> 0:06:22,000
What I actually said is they're not contentious at all.

132
0:06:22.64,000 --> 0:06:24,000
So it's a slight misquote.

133
0:06:24.76,000 --> 0:06:25,000
(Laughter)

134
0:06:26.56,000 --> 0:06:28,000
The articles were edited quite heavily.

135
0:06:28.6,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And it is true that we did have to lock the articles

136
0:06:31.08,000 --> 0:06:32,000
on a couple of occasions.

137
0:06:32.44,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Time magazine recently reported that

138
0:06:34.84,000 --> 0:06:36,000
"Extreme action sometimes has to be taken,

139
0:06:36.88,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and Wales locked the entries on Kerry and Bush for most of 2004."

140
0:06:41.76,000 --> 0:06:45,000
This came after I told the reporter that we had to lock it for --

141
0:06:46.04,000 --> 0:06:48,000
occasionally a little bit here and there.

142
0:06:48.2,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So the truth in general is that the kinds of controversies

143
0:06:51.6,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that you would probably think we have within the Wikipedia community

144
0:06:54.815,000 --> 0:06:56,000
are not really controversies at all.

145
0:06:57.56,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Articles on controversial topics are edited a lot,

146
0:07:00.08,000 --> 0:07:02,000
but they don't cause much controversy within the community.

147
0:07:03.08,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And the reason for this is that most people understand the need for neutrality.

148
0:07:07.6,000 --> 0:07:13,000
The real struggle is not between the right and the left --

149
0:07:14.32,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that's where most people assume --

150
0:07:15.964,000 --> 0:07:17,000
but it's between the party of the thoughtful

151
0:07:18.04,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and the party of the jerks.

152
0:07:19.36,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And no side of the political spectrum

153
0:07:21.2,000 --> 0:07:23,000
has a monopoly on either of those qualities.

154
0:07:23.68,000 --> 0:07:25,000
The actual truth about the specific Bush-Kerry incident

155
0:07:26.28,000 --> 0:07:28,000
is that the Bush-Kerry articles

156
0:07:29.28,000 --> 0:07:31,000
were locked less than one percent of the time in 2004,

157
0:07:32.28,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and it wasn't because they were contentious;

158
0:07:34.36,000 --> 0:07:36,000
it was just because there was routine vandalism --

159
0:07:36.72,000 --> 0:07:39,000
which happens sometimes even on stage ...

160
0:07:40.44,000 --> 0:07:41,000
(Laughter)

161
0:07:41.6,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Sometimes even reporters have reported to me that they vandalized Wikipedia

162
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and were amazed that it was fixed so quickly.

163
0:07:47.52,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And I said -- you know, I always say, please don't do that.

164
0:07:50.32,000 --> 0:07:51,000
That's not a good thing.

165
0:07:51.92,000 --> 0:07:52,000
So how do we do this?

166
0:07:53.44,000 --> 0:07:55,000
How do we manage the quality control?

167
0:07:56.32,000 --> 0:07:57,000
How does it work?

168
0:07:59.12,000 --> 0:08:,000
So there's a few elements,

169
0:08:00.84,000 --> 0:08:03,000
mostly social policies and some elements of the software.

170
0:08:04.12,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So the biggest and the most important thing

171
0:08:06.88,000 --> 0:08:07,000
is our neutral point of view policy.

172
0:08:08.635,000 --> 0:08:1,000
This is something that I set down, from the very beginning,

173
0:08:11.421,000 --> 0:08:15,000
as a core principle of the community that's completely not debatable.

174
0:08:15.48,000 --> 0:08:17,000
It's a social concept of cooperation,

175
0:08:18.4,000 --> 0:08:21,000
so we don't talk a lot about truth and objectivity.

176
0:08:21.92,000 --> 0:08:23,000
The reason for this is if we say

177
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:26,000
we're only going to write the "truth" about some topic,

178
0:08:26.6,000 --> 0:08:29,000
that doesn't do us a damn bit of good of figuring out what to write,

179
0:08:29.831,000 --> 0:08:31,000
because I don't agree with you about what's the truth.

180
0:08:32.391,000 --> 0:08:34,000
But we have this jargon term of neutrality,

181
0:08:34.76,000 --> 0:08:36,000
which has its own long history within the community,

182
0:08:37.24,000 --> 0:08:4,000
which basically says, any time there's a controversial issue,

183
0:08:40.68,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Wikipedia itself should not take a stand on the issue.

184
0:08:43.28,000 --> 0:08:46,000
We should merely report on what reputable parties have said about it.

185
0:08:46.543,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So this neutrality policy is really important for us

186
0:08:49.64,000 --> 0:08:52,000
because it empowers a community that is very diverse

187
0:08:52.92,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to come together and actually get some work done.

188
0:08:55.24,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So we have very diverse contributors

189
0:08:57.4,000 --> 0:09:,000
in terms of political, religious, cultural backgrounds.

190
0:09:00.64,000 --> 0:09:01,000
By having this firm neutrality policy,

191
0:09:02.48,000 --> 0:09:04,000
which is non-negotiable from the beginning,

192
0:09:04.52,000 --> 0:09:05,000
we ensure that people can work together

193
0:09:06.402,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and that the entries don't become simply a war

194
0:09:08.64,000 --> 0:09:1,000
back and forth between the left and the right.

195
0:09:10.807,000 --> 0:09:13,000
If you engage in that type of behavior, you'll be asked to leave the community.

196
0:09:16.24,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So, real-time peer review.

197
0:09:17.72,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Every single change on the site goes to the "Recent changes" page.

198
0:09:20.88,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So as soon as he made his change, it went to the "Recent changes" page.

199
0:09:24.4,000 --> 0:09:27,000
That recent changes page was also fed into an IRC channel,

200
0:09:28.4,000 --> 0:09:29,000
which is an Internet chat channel

201
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:33,000
that people are monitoring with various software tools.

202
0:09:33.92,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And people can get RSS feeds --

203
0:09:36.4,000 --> 0:09:39,000
they can get email notifications of changes.

204
0:09:39.52,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And then users can set up their own personal watch list.

205
0:09:42.2,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So my page is on quite a few volunteers' watch lists,

206
0:09:44.717,000 --> 0:09:45,000
because it is sometimes vandalized.

207
0:09:46.437,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And therefore, what happens is someone will notice the change very quickly,

208
0:09:52.44,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and then they'll just simply revert the change.

209
0:09:55.84,000 --> 0:09:56,000
There's a "new pages feed," for example,

210
0:09:57.78,000 --> 0:09:59,000
so you can go to a certain page of Wikipedia

211
0:09:59.86,000 --> 0:10:,000
and see every new page as it's created.

212
0:10:01.82,000 --> 0:10:02,000
This is really important

213
0:10:02.98,000 --> 0:10:05,000
because a lot of new pages are just garbage that has to be deleted,

214
0:10:06.2,000 --> 0:10:07,000
you know, "ASDFASDF."

215
0:10:07.48,000 --> 0:10:09,000
But also, that's some of the most interesting and fun things,

216
0:10:10.42,000 --> 0:10:11,000
some of the new articles.

217
0:10:11.66,000 --> 0:10:13,000
People will start an article on some interesting topic,

218
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
other people will find that intriguing

219
0:10:16.1,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and jump in and help and make it much better.

220
0:10:18.52,000 --> 0:10:19,000
So we do have edits by anonymous users,

221
0:10:20.44,000 --> 0:10:23,000
which is one of the most controversial and intriguing things about Wikipedia.

222
0:10:24.32,000 --> 0:10:27,000
So, Chris was able to do his change -- he didn't have to log in or anything;

223
0:10:27.96,000 --> 0:10:29,000
he just went on the website and made a change.

224
0:10:30.8,000 --> 0:10:32,000
But it turns out that only about 18 percent

225
0:10:32.88,000 --> 0:10:33,000
of all the edits to the website

226
0:10:34.4,000 --> 0:10:35,000
are done by anonymous users.

227
0:10:35.76,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And that's a really important thing to understand:

228
0:10:38.12,000 --> 0:10:41,000
the vast majority of the edits that go on on the website

229
0:10:41.4,000 --> 0:10:44,000
are from a very close-knit community of maybe 600 to 1,000 people

230
0:10:45.12,000 --> 0:10:46,000
who are in constant communication.

231
0:10:46.764,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And we have over 40 IRC channels, 40 mailing lists.

232
0:10:49.36,000 --> 0:10:5,000
All these people know each other.

233
0:10:50.96,000 --> 0:10:52,000
They communicate. We have off-line meetings.

234
0:10:53.032,000 --> 0:10:55,000
These are the people who are doing the bulk of the site,

235
0:10:55.676,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and they are, in a sense, semi-professionals at what they're doing.

236
0:11:00.96,000 --> 0:11:02,000
The standards we set for ourselves

237
0:11:03.32,000 --> 0:11:06,000
are equal to or higher than professional standards of quality.

238
0:11:06.4,000 --> 0:11:09,000
We don't always meet those standards, but that's what we're striving for.

239
0:11:09.94,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And so that tight community is who really cares for the site,

240
0:11:12.822,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and these are some of the smartest people I've ever met.

241
0:11:15.48,000 --> 0:11:17,000
It's my job to say that, but it's actually true.

242
0:11:17.76,000 --> 0:11:2,000
The type of people who were drawn to writing an encyclopedia for fun

243
0:11:21.52,000 --> 0:11:23,000
tend to be pretty smart people.

244
0:11:23.88,000 --> 0:11:26,000
The tools and the software: there's lots of tools that allow us --

245
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:28,000
allow us, meaning the community --

246
0:11:28.644,000 --> 0:11:3,000
to self-monitor and to monitor all the work.

247
0:11:30.72,000 --> 0:11:32,000
This is an example of a page history on "flat Earth,"

248
0:11:33.24,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and you can see some changes that were made.

249
0:11:35.32,000 --> 0:11:38,000
What's nice about this page is you can immediately take a look at this

250
0:11:38.64,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and see, "OK, I understand now."

251
0:11:40.24,000 --> 0:11:41,000
When somebody goes and looks at --

252
0:11:42.04,000 --> 0:11:44,000
they see that someone, an anonymous IP number,

253
0:11:44.207,000 --> 0:11:45,000
made an edit to my page.

254
0:11:45.72,000 --> 0:11:47,000
That sounds suspicious. Who is this person?

255
0:11:47.8,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Somebody looks at it --

256
0:11:49.04,000 --> 0:11:51,000
they can immediately see highlighted in red

257
0:11:51.08,000 --> 0:11:52,000
all of the changes that took place --

258
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:56,000
to see, OK, well, these words have changed, things like this.

259
0:11:56.64,000 --> 0:11:57,000
So that's one tool that we can use

260
0:11:58.284,000 --> 0:12:,000
to very quickly monitor the history of a page.

261
0:12:01.52,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Another thing that we do within the community

262
0:12:03.84,000 --> 0:12:06,000
is we leave everything very open-ended.

263
0:12:07.24,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Most of the social rules and the methods of work

264
0:12:10.64,000 --> 0:12:12,000
are left completely open-ended in the software.

265
0:12:13.08,000 --> 0:12:15,000
All of that stuff is just on Wiki pages.

266
0:12:15.12,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And so there's nothing in the software that enforces the rules.

267
0:12:18.24,000 --> 0:12:22,000
The example I've got up here is the Votes for Deletion page.

268
0:12:22.28,000 --> 0:12:24,000
So, I mentioned earlier, people type "ASDFASDF" --

269
0:12:24.88,000 --> 0:12:25,000
it needs to be deleted.

270
0:12:26.12,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Cases like that, the administrators just delete it.

271
0:12:28.62,000 --> 0:12:3,000
There's no reason to have a big argument about it.

272
0:12:30.98,000 --> 0:12:33,000
But you can imagine there's a lot of other areas where the question is,

273
0:12:34.339,000 --> 0:12:36,000
is this notable enough to go in an encyclopedia?

274
0:12:36.603,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Is the information verifiable? Is it a hoax? Is it true? Is it what?

275
0:12:40.2,000 --> 0:12:43,000
So we needed a social method for figuring out the answer to this.

276
0:12:43.28,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And so the method that arose organically within the community

277
0:12:46.162,000 --> 0:12:47,000
is the Votes For Deletion page.

278
0:12:47.76,000 --> 0:12:49,000
And in the particular example we have here,

279
0:12:49.8,000 --> 0:12:5,000
it's a film, "Twisted Issues,"

280
0:12:51.32,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and the first person says,

281
0:12:52.8,000 --> 0:12:55,000
"Now this is supposedly a film. It fails the Google test miserably."

282
0:12:56.52,000 --> 0:12:58,000
The Google test is you look in Google and see if it's there,

283
0:12:59.36,000 --> 0:13:02,000
because if something's not even in Google, it probably doesn't exist at all.

284
0:13:03.28,000 --> 0:13:04,000
It's not a perfect rule,

285
0:13:04.88,000 --> 0:13:07,000
but it's a nice starting point for quick research.

286
0:13:08.24,000 --> 0:13:11,000
So somebody says, "Delete it, please. Delete it -- it's not notable."

287
0:13:11.519,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And then somebody says, "Wait, I found it. I found it in a book,

288
0:13:14.559,000 --> 0:13:17,000
'Film Threat Video Guide: the 20 Underground Films You Must See.'"

289
0:13:17.84,000 --> 0:13:18,000
So the next persons says, "Clean it up."

290
0:13:19.769,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Somebody says, "I've found it on IMDB. Keep, keep, keep."

291
0:13:23.2,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And what's interesting about this is that the software is --

292
0:13:26.04,000 --> 0:13:29,000
these votes are just text typed into a page.

293
0:13:29.6,000 --> 0:13:33,000
This is not really a vote so much as it is a dialogue.

294
0:13:33.68,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Now it is true that at the end of the day,

295
0:13:36.44,000 --> 0:13:39,000
an administrator can go through here and take a look at this and say,

296
0:13:39.703,000 --> 0:13:41,000
"OK, 18 deletes, two keeps: we'll delete it."

297
0:13:42.2,000 --> 0:13:45,000
But in other cases, this could be 18 deletes and two keeps,

298
0:13:46,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and we would keep it, because if those last two keeps say,

299
0:13:48.82,000 --> 0:13:5,000
"Wait a minute. Nobody else saw this but I found it in a book,

300
0:13:51.749,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and I found a link to a page that describes it,

301
0:13:53.971,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and I'm going to clean it up tomorrow, so please don't delete it,"

302
0:13:57.091,000 --> 0:13:58,000
then it would survive.

303
0:13:58.3,000 --> 0:14:,000
And it also matters who the people are who are voting.

304
0:14:00.92,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Like I say, it's a tight-knit community.

305
0:14:02.849,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Down here at the bottom, "Keep, real movie," RickK.

306
0:14:05.4,000 --> 0:14:08,000
RickK is a very famous Wikipedian who does an enormous amount of work

307
0:14:08.805,000 --> 0:14:1,000
with vandalism, hoaxes and votes for deletion.

308
0:14:11.56,000 --> 0:14:13,000
His voice carries a lot of weight within the community

309
0:14:14.4,000 --> 0:14:15,000
because he knows what he's doing.

310
0:14:17.4,000 --> 0:14:18,000
So how is all this governed?

311
0:14:19.36,000 --> 0:14:22,000
People really want to know about administrators, things like that.

312
0:14:22.52,000 --> 0:14:25,000
So the Wikipedia governance model, the governance of the community,

313
0:14:26.4,000 --> 0:14:3,000
is a very confusing, but workable mix of consensus --

314
0:14:30.84,000 --> 0:14:32,000
meaning we try not to vote on the content of articles,

315
0:14:33.4,000 --> 0:14:36,000
because the majority view is not necessarily neutral --

316
0:14:37.32,000 --> 0:14:38,000
some amount of democracy --

317
0:14:38.64,000 --> 0:14:39,000
all of the administrators --

318
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:42,000
these are the people who have the ability to delete pages.

319
0:14:42.82,000 --> 0:14:44,000
That doesn't mean that they have the right to delete pages.

320
0:14:45.68,000 --> 0:14:48,000
They still have to follow all the rules -- but they're elected by the community.

321
0:14:49.54,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Sometimes people -- random trolls on the Internet --

322
0:14:51.994,000 --> 0:14:53,000
like to accuse me of handpicking the administrators

323
0:14:54.401,000 --> 0:14:55,000
to bias the content of the encyclopedia.

324
0:14:56.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
I always laugh at this, because I have no idea how they're elected, actually.

325
0:15:00.12,000 --> 0:15:01,000
There's a certain amount of aristocracy.

326
0:15:02.12,000 --> 0:15:04,000
You got a hint of that when I mentioned, like,

327
0:15:04.287,000 --> 0:15:06,000
RickK's voice would carry a lot more weight

328
0:15:06.463,000 --> 0:15:07,000
than someone we don't know.

329
0:15:07.783,000 --> 0:15:09,000
I give this talk sometimes with Angela,

330
0:15:10.52,000 --> 0:15:12,000
who was just re-elected to the board from the community --

331
0:15:13.275,000 --> 0:15:14,000
to the Board of the Foundation,

332
0:15:14.795,000 --> 0:15:17,000
with more than twice the votes of the person who didn't make it.

333
0:15:17.96,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And I always embarrass her because I say,

334
0:15:20.92,000 --> 0:15:21,000
"Well, Angela, for example,

335
0:15:22.24,000 --> 0:15:25,000
could get away with doing absolutely anything within Wikipedia,

336
0:15:25.68,000 --> 0:15:27,000
because she's so admired and so powerful."

337
0:15:27.72,000 --> 0:15:3,000
But the irony is, of course, that Angela can do this because she's the one person

338
0:15:31.56,000 --> 0:15:33,000
who you know would never, ever break any rules of Wikipedia.

339
0:15:34.56,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And I also like to say she's the only person

340
0:15:36.64,000 --> 0:15:39,000
who actually knows all the rules of Wikipedia, so ...

341
0:15:39.88,000 --> 0:15:4,000
And then there's monarchy,

342
0:15:41.143,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and that's my role on the community, so ...

343
0:15:43.183,000 --> 0:15:45,000
(Laughter)

344
0:15:45.6,000 --> 0:15:47,000
I was describing this in Berlin once,

345
0:15:48.24,000 --> 0:15:5,000
and the next day in the newspaper the headline said,

346
0:15:51.04,000 --> 0:15:52,000
"I am the Queen of England."

347
0:15:52.632,000 --> 0:15:53,000
(Laughter)

348
0:15:53.807,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And that's not exactly what I said, but --

349
0:15:56.2,000 --> 0:15:57,000
(Laughter)

350
0:15:57.72,000 --> 0:15:59,000
the point is my role in the community --

351
0:16:00.32,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Within the free software world, there's been a long-standing tradition

352
0:16:05.04,000 --> 0:16:08,000
of the "benevolent dictator" model.

353
0:16:08.28,000 --> 0:16:1,000
So if you look at most of the major free software projects,

354
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:12,000
they have one single person in charge

355
0:16:12.96,000 --> 0:16:15,000
who everyone agrees is the benevolent dictator.

356
0:16:16.32,000 --> 0:16:18,000
Well, I don't like the term "benevolent dictator,"

357
0:16:18.84,000 --> 0:16:21,000
and I don't think that it's my job or my role in the world of ideas

358
0:16:22.84,000 --> 0:16:25,000
to be the dictator of the future of all human knowledge

359
0:16:26.2,000 --> 0:16:27,000
compiled by the world.

360
0:16:27.44,000 --> 0:16:28,000
It just isn't appropriate.

361
0:16:29.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
But there is a need still for a certain amount of monarchy,

362
0:16:31.96,000 --> 0:16:32,000
a certain amount of --

363
0:16:33.56,000 --> 0:16:34,000
sometimes we have to make a decision

364
0:16:35.36,000 --> 0:16:37,000
and we don't want to get bogged down too heavily

365
0:16:37.623,000 --> 0:16:39,000
in formal decision-making processes.

366
0:16:40.36,000 --> 0:16:44,000
So as an example of how this can be important:

367
0:16:45.28,000 --> 0:16:48,000
we recently had a situation where a neo-Nazi website discovered Wikipedia,

368
0:16:49.28,000 --> 0:16:51,000
and they said, "Oh, well, this is horrible,

369
0:16:52.16,000 --> 0:16:53,000
this Jewish conspiracy of a website,

370
0:16:54.08,000 --> 0:16:57,000
and we're going to get certain articles deleted that we don't like.

371
0:16:57.263,000 --> 0:17:,000
And we see they have a voting process, so we're going to send --

372
0:17:00.287,000 --> 0:17:02,000
we have 40,000 members and we're going to send them over

373
0:17:03.12,000 --> 0:17:05,000
and they're all going to vote and get these pages deleted."

374
0:17:05.922,000 --> 0:17:07,000
Well, they managed to get 18 people to show up.

375
0:17:08.137,000 --> 0:17:1,000
That's neo-Nazi math for you.

376
0:17:10.92,000 --> 0:17:13,000
They always think they've got 40,000 members when they've got 18.

377
0:17:14.4,000 --> 0:17:17,000
But they managed to get 18 people to come and vote in a fairly absurd way

378
0:17:17.92,000 --> 0:17:19,000
to delete a perfectly valid article.

379
0:17:19.96,000 --> 0:17:21,000
Of course, the vote ended up being about 85 to 18,

380
0:17:22.72,000 --> 0:17:25,000
so there was no real danger to our democratic processes.

381
0:17:26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
On the other hand, people said, "But what are we going to do?

382
0:17:29.319,000 --> 0:17:3,000
I mean, this could happen.

383
0:17:30.599,000 --> 0:17:32,000
What if some group gets really seriously organized

384
0:17:32.96,000 --> 0:17:34,000
and comes in and wants to vote?"

385
0:17:35.56,000 --> 0:17:37,000
Then I said, "Well, fuck it, we'll just change the rules."

386
0:17:38.359,000 --> 0:17:39,000
That's my job in the community:

387
0:17:40.079,000 --> 0:17:43,000
to say we won't allow our openness and freedom

388
0:17:43.68,000 --> 0:17:45,000
to undermine the quality of the content.

389
0:17:46.28,000 --> 0:17:49,000
And so, as long as people trust me in my role,

390
0:17:49.599,000 --> 0:17:5,000
then that's a valid place for me.

391
0:17:51.48,000 --> 0:17:53,000
Of course, because of the free licensing,

392
0:17:53.54,000 --> 0:17:56,000
if I do a bad job, the volunteers are more than happy to take and leave --

393
0:17:57.041,000 --> 0:17:58,000
I can't tell anyone what to do.

394
0:17:59,000 --> 0:18:03,000
So the final point here is that to understand how Wikipedia works,

395
0:18:03.72,000 --> 0:18:06,000
it's important to understand that our wiki model is the way we work,

396
0:18:06.935,000 --> 0:18:09,000
but we are not fanatical web anarchists.

397
0:18:10.56,000 --> 0:18:13,000
In fact, we're very flexible about the social methodology,

398
0:18:13.96,000 --> 0:18:15,000
because ultimately, the passion of the community

399
0:18:16.4,000 --> 0:18:18,000
is for the quality of the work,

400
0:18:18.44,000 --> 0:18:2,000
not necessarily for the process that we use to generate it.

401
0:18:21.44,000 --> 0:18:22,000
Thank you.

402
0:18:22.68,000 --> 0:18:26,000
(Applause)

403
0:18:26.96,000 --> 0:18:27,000
Ben Saunders: Yeah, hi, Ben Saunders.

404
0:18:28.76,000 --> 0:18:32,000
Jimmy, you mentioned impartiality being a key to Wikipedia's success.

405
0:18:32.92,000 --> 0:18:37,000
It strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children

406
0:18:38.28,000 --> 0:18:39,000
are inherently biased.

407
0:18:40.08,000 --> 0:18:43,000
Have you found Wikipedia being used by teachers

408
0:18:43.72,000 --> 0:18:45,000
and how do you see Wikipedia changing education?

409
0:18:46.2,000 --> 0:18:5,000
Jimmy Wales: Yeah, so, a lot of teachers are beginning to use Wikipedia.

410
0:18:50.44,000 --> 0:18:54,000
There's a media storyline about Wikipedia, which I think is false.

411
0:18:55.04,000 --> 0:18:58,000
It builds on the storyline of bloggers versus newspapers.

412
0:18:58.64,000 --> 0:19:01,000
And the storyline is, there's this crazy thing, Wikipedia,

413
0:19:01.8,000 --> 0:19:04,000
but academics hate it and teachers hate it.

414
0:19:05.28,000 --> 0:19:07,000
And that turns out to not be true.

415
0:19:07.88,000 --> 0:19:09,000
The last time I got an email from a journalist saying,

416
0:19:10.44,000 --> 0:19:11,000
"Why do academics hate Wikipedia?"

417
0:19:12.18,000 --> 0:19:13,000
I sent it from my Harvard email address

418
0:19:14.062,000 --> 0:19:16,000
because I was recently appointed a fellow there.

419
0:19:16.339,000 --> 0:19:18,000
And I said, "Well, they don't all hate it."

420
0:19:18.379,000 --> 0:19:19,000
(Laughter)

421
0:19:19.48,000 --> 0:19:21,000
But I think there's going to be huge impacts.

422
0:19:22.36,000 --> 0:19:25,000
And we actually have a project that I'm personally really excited about,

423
0:19:25.8,000 --> 0:19:26,000
which is the Wikibooks project,

424
0:19:27.32,000 --> 0:19:3,000
which is an effort to create textbooks in all the languages.

425
0:19:30.44,000 --> 0:19:31,000
And that's a much bigger project.

426
0:19:32.04,000 --> 0:19:36,000
It's going to take 20 years or so to come to fruition.

427
0:19:36.68,000 --> 0:19:38,000
But part of that is to fulfill our mission

428
0:19:38.72,000 --> 0:19:4,000
of giving an encyclopedia to every single person on the planet.

429
0:19:41.72,000 --> 0:19:43,000
We don't mean we're going to Spam them with AOL-style CDs.

430
0:19:44.6,000 --> 0:19:46,000
We mean we're going to give them a tool that they can use.

431
0:19:47.42,000 --> 0:19:48,000
And for a lot of people in the world,

432
0:19:49.22,000 --> 0:19:52,000
if I give you an encyclopedia that's written at a university level,

433
0:19:52.42,000 --> 0:19:55,000
it doesn't do you any good without a whole host of literacy materials

434
0:19:56,000 --> 0:19:58,000
to build you up to the point where you can actually use it.

435
0:19:58.8,000 --> 0:20:,000
The Wikibooks project is an effort to do that.

436
0:20:00.967,000 --> 0:20:03,000
And I think that we're going to see -- it may not even come from us;

437
0:20:04.2,000 --> 0:20:05,000
there's all kinds of innovation going on.

438
0:20:06.2,000 --> 0:20:09,000
But freely licensed textbooks are the next big thing in education.

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm a filmmaker.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
For the last 8 years,

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I have dedicated my life

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
to documenting the work

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
of Israelis and Palestinians

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
who are trying to end the conflict

7
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
using peaceful means.

8
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
When I travel with my work

9
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
across Europe and the United States,

10
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
one question always comes up:

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Where is the Palestinian Gandhi?

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Why aren't Palestinians

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
using nonviolent resistance?

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
The challenge I face when I hear this question

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
is that often I have just returned from the Middle East

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
where I spent my time

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
filming dozens of Palestinians

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
who are using nonviolence

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
to defend their lands

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and water resources

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
from Israeli soldiers and settlers.

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
These leaders are trying to forge

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
a massive national nonviolent movement

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
to end the occupation

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and build peace in the region.

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Yet, most of you

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
have probably never heard about them.

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
This divide between what's happening on the ground

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and perceptions abroad

30
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
is one of the key reasons

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
why we don't have yet

32
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
a Palestinian peaceful resistance movement

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that has been successful.

34
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So I'm here today

35
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
to talk about the power of attention,

36
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
the power of your attention,

37
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and the emergence and development

38
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
of nonviolent movements

39
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
in the West Bank, Gaza and elsewhere --

40
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
but today, my case study is going to be Palestine.

41
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I believe that what's mostly missing

42
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
for nonviolence to grow

43
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
is not for Palestinians

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
to start adopting nonviolence,

45
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
but for us to start paying attention

46
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
to those who already are.

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Allow me to illustrate this point

48
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
by taking you to this village

49
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
called Budrus.

50
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
About seven years ago,

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
they faced extinction,

52
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
because Israel announced it would build a separation barrier,

53
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and part of this barrier

54
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
would be built on top of the village.

55
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
They would lose 40 percent of their land

56
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and be surrounded,

57
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
so they would lose free access

58
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
to the rest of the West Bank.

59
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Through inspired local leadership,

60
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
they launched a peaceful resistance campaign

61
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
to stop that from happening.

62
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Let me show you some brief clips,

63
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
so you have a sense

64
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
for what that actually looked like on the ground.

65
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
(Music)

66
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Palestinian Woman: We were told the wall

67
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
would separate Palestine from Israel.

68
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Here in Budrus,

69
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
we realized the wall would steal our land.

70
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Israeli Man: The fence has, in fact,

71
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
created a solution to terror.

72
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Man: Today you're invited

73
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
to a peaceful march.

74
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
You are joined

75
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
by dozens of your Israeli brothers and sisters.

76
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Israeli Activist: Nothing scares the army

77
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
more than nonviolent opposition.

78
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Woman: We saw the men

79
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
trying to push the soldiers,

80
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
but none of them could do that.

81
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
But I think the girls could do it.

82
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Fatah Party Member: We must empty our minds

83
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
of traditional thinking.

84
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Hamas Party Member: We were in complete harmony,

85
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and we wanted to spread it to all of Palestine.

86
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Chanting: One united nation.

87
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Fatah, Hamas and the Popular Front!

88
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
News Anchor: The clashes over the fence continue.

89
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Reporter: Israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd.

90
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
They were allowed to use any force necessary.

91
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
(Gunshots)

92
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Man: These are live bullets.

93
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
It's like Fallujah. Shooting everywhere.

94
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Israeli Activist: I was sure we were all going to die.

95
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
But there were others around me who weren't even cowering.

96
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Israeli Soldier: A nonviolent protest

97
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
is not going to stop the [unclear].

98
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Protester: This is a peaceful march.

99
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
There is no need to use violence.

100
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Chanting: We can do it! We can do it!

101
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
We can do it!

102
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Julia Bacha: When I first heard

103
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
about the story of Budrus,

104
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I was surprised

105
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
that the international media had failed to cover

106
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
the extraordinary set of events

107
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
that happened seven years ago,

108
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
in 2003.

109
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
What was even more surprising

110
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
was the fact that Budrus was successful.

111
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
The residents, after 10 months of peaceful resistance,

112
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
convinced the Israeli government

113
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
to move the route of the barrier off their lands

114
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and to the green line,

115
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
which is the internationally recognized boundary

116
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
between Israel and the Palestinian Territories.

117
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
The resistance in Budrus

118
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
has since spread

119
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
to villages across the West Bank

120
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and to Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem.

121
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Yet the media remains mostly silent

122
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
on these stories.

123
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
This silence carries profound consequences

124
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
for the likelihood

125
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that nonviolence can grow,

126
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
or even survive,

127
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
in Palestine.

128
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Violent resistance

129
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and nonviolent resistance

130
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
share one very important thing in common;

131
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
they are both a form of theater

132
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
seeking an audience to their cause.

133
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
If violent actors

134
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
are the only ones constantly getting front-page covers

135
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and attracting international attention

136
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
to the Palestinian issue,

137
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
it becomes very hard

138
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
for nonviolent leaders

139
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
to make the case to their communities

140
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
that civil disobedience

141
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
is a viable option

142
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
in addressing their plight.

143
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
The power of attention

144
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
is probably going to come as no surprise

145
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
to the parents in the room.

146
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
The surest way

147
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
to make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums

148
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
is by giving him attention

149
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
the first time he throws a fit.

150
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
The tantrum will become

151
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
what childhood psychologists call

152
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
a functional behavior,

153
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
since the child has learned

154
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that he can get parental attention out of it.

155
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Parents can incentivize or disincentivize behavior

156
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
simply by giving or withdrawing

157
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
attention to their children.

158
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
But that's true for adults too.

159
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
In fact, the behavior

160
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
of entire communities and countries

161
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
can be influenced,

162
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
depending on where

163
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
the international community chooses

164
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
to focus its attention.

165
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the Middle East

166
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and bringing peace

167
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
is for us

168
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
to transform nonviolence

169
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
into a functional behavior

170
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
by giving a lot more attention

171
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today.

172
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
In the course of taking my film to villages

173
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
in the West Bank, in Gaza and in East Jerusalem,

174
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I have seen the impact

175
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
that even one documentary film can have

176
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
in influencing the transformation.

177
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
In a village called Wallajeh,

178
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
which sits very close to Jerusalem,

179
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
the community was facing

180
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
a very similar plight to Budrus.

181
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
They were going to be surrounded, lose a lot of their lands

182
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and not have freedom of access,

183
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
either to the West Bank or Jerusalem.

184
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
They had been using nonviolence for about two years

185
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
but had grown disenchanted

186
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
since nobody was paying attention.

187
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So we organized a screening.

188
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
A week later,

189
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
they held the most well-attended

190
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and disciplined

191
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
demonstration to date.

192
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
The organizers say

193
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
that the villagers, upon seeing the story of Budrus

194
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
documented in a film,

195
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
felt that there were indeed people

196
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
following what they were doing,

197
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
that people cared.

198
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So they kept on going.

199
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
On the Israeli side,

200
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
there is a new peace movement called Solidariot,

201
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
which means solidarity in Hebrew.

202
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
The leaders of this movement have been using Budrus

203
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
as one of their primary recruiting tools.

204
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
They report

205
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
that Israelis who had never been active before,

206
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
upon seeing the film,

207
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
understand the power of nonviolence

208
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and start joining their activities.

209
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
The examples of Wallajeh

210
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and the Solidariot movement

211
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
show that even a small-budget independent film

212
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
can play a role

213
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
in transforming nonviolence

214
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
into a functional behavior.

215
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Now imagine the power

216
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
that big media players could have

217
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
if they started covering

218
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
the weekly nonviolent demonstrations

219
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
happening in villages

220
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
like Bil'in, Ni'lin,

221
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Wallajeh,

222
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
in Jerusalem neighborhoods

223
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
like Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan --

224
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
the nonviolent leaders

225
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
would become more visible,

226
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
valued and effective

227
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
in their work.

228
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
I believe

229
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
that the most important thing

230
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
is to understand

231
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
that if we don't pay attention to these efforts,

232
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
they are invisible,

233
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and it's as if they never happened.

234
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
But I have seen first hand

235
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
that if we do,

236
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
they will multiply.

237
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
If they multiply,

238
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
their influence will grow

239
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
in the overall Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

240
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And theirs is the kind of influence

241
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
that can finally

242
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
unblock the situation.

243
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
These leaders have proven that nonviolence works

244
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
in places like Budrus.

245
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Let's give them attention

246
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
so they can prove it works everywhere.

247
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Thank you.

248
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:16.177,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Well when I was asked to do this TEDTalk, I was really chuckled,

3
0:00:18.54,000 --> 0:00:21,000
because, you see, my father's name was Ted,

4
0:00:22.333,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and much of my life, especially my musical life,

5
0:00:26.347,000 --> 0:00:29,000
is really a talk that I'm still having with him,

6
0:00:29.468,000 --> 0:00:32,000
or the part of me that he continues to be.

7
0:00:33.216,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Now Ted was a New Yorker, an all-around theater guy,

8
0:00:36.82,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and he was a self-taught illustrator and musician.

9
0:00:41.135,000 --> 0:00:42,000
He didn't read a note,

10
0:00:42.67,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and he was profoundly hearing impaired.

11
0:00:45.635,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Yet, he was my greatest teacher.

12
0:00:48.893,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Because even through the squeaks of his hearing aids,

13
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
his understanding of music was profound.

14
0:00:55.51,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And for him, it wasn't so much the way the music goes

15
0:00:58.891,000 --> 0:01:02,000
as about what it witnesses and where it can take you.

16
0:01:03.087,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And he did a painting of this experience,

17
0:01:05.704,000 --> 0:01:08,000
which he called "In the Realm of Music."

18
0:01:08.793,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Now Ted entered this realm every day by improvising

19
0:01:15.281,000 --> 0:01:17,000
in a sort of Tin Pan Alley style like this.

20
0:01:18.062,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Music)

21
0:01:24.904,000 --> 0:01:27,000
But he was tough when it came to music.

22
0:01:28.258,000 --> 0:01:3,000
He said, "There are only two things that matter in music:

23
0:01:30.964,000 --> 0:01:32,000
what and how.

24
0:01:33.177,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And the thing about classical music,

25
0:01:36.964,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that what and how, it's inexhaustible."

26
0:01:40.292,000 --> 0:01:42,000
That was his passion for the music.

27
0:01:42.46,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Both my parents really loved it.

28
0:01:44.317,000 --> 0:01:46,000
They didn't know all that much about it,

29
0:01:46.575,000 --> 0:01:49,000
but they gave me the opportunity to discover it

30
0:01:50.302,000 --> 0:01:51,000
together with them.

31
0:01:52.218,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And I think inspired by that memory,

32
0:01:55.43,000 --> 0:01:57,000
it's been my desire to try and bring it

33
0:01:57.433,000 --> 0:01:58,000
to as many other people as I can,

34
0:01:58.478,000 --> 0:02:01,000
sort of pass it on through whatever means.

35
0:02:02.052,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And how people get this music, how it comes into their lives,

36
0:02:07.062,000 --> 0:02:08,000
really fascinates me.

37
0:02:08.518,000 --> 0:02:1,000
One day in New York, I was on the street

38
0:02:10.775,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and I saw some kids playing baseball between stoops and cars and fire hydrants.

39
0:02:16.18,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And a tough, slouchy kid got up to bat,

40
0:02:18.881,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and he took a swing and really connected.

41
0:02:21.585,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And he watched the ball fly for a second,

42
0:02:23.287,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and then he went, "Dah dadaratatatah.

43
0:02:26.691,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Brah dada dadadadah."

44
0:02:30.177,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And he ran around the bases.

45
0:02:32.01,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And I thought, go figure.

46
0:02:34.745,000 --> 0:02:39,000
How did this piece of 18th century Austrian aristocratic entertainment

47
0:02:39.826,000 --> 0:02:43,000
turn into the victory crow of this New York kid?

48
0:02:44.498,000 --> 0:02:48,000
How was that passed on? How did he get to hear Mozart?

49
0:02:48.9,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Well when it comes to classical music,

50
0:02:50.821,000 --> 0:02:52,000
there's an awful lot to pass on,

51
0:02:53.077,000 --> 0:02:56,000
much more than Mozart, Beethoven or Tchiakovsky.

52
0:02:56.814,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Because classical music

53
0:02:58.426,000 --> 0:03:01,000
is an unbroken living tradition

54
0:03:01.843,000 --> 0:03:04,000
that goes back over 1,000 years.

55
0:03:05.093,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And every one of those years

56
0:03:07.137,000 --> 0:03:1,000
has had something unique and powerful to say to us

57
0:03:10.635,000 --> 0:03:13,000
about what it's like to be alive.

58
0:03:13.86,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Now the raw material of it, of course,

59
0:03:16.419,000 --> 0:03:17,000
is just the music of everyday life.

60
0:03:18.135,000 --> 0:03:21,000
It's all the anthems and dance crazes

61
0:03:21.168,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and ballads and marches.

62
0:03:22.903,000 --> 0:03:24,000
But what classical music does

63
0:03:25.593,000 --> 0:03:29,000
is to distill all of these musics down,

64
0:03:30.453,000 --> 0:03:33,000
to condense them to their absolute essence,

65
0:03:34.139,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and from that essence create a new language,

66
0:03:37.427,000 --> 0:03:42,000
a language that speaks very lovingly and unflinchingly

67
0:03:42.912,000 --> 0:03:44,000
about who we really are.

68
0:03:45.012,000 --> 0:03:47,000
It's a language that's still evolving.

69
0:03:47.856,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Now over the centuries it grew into the big pieces we always think of,

70
0:03:51.427,000 --> 0:03:54,000
like concertos and symphonies,

71
0:03:54.427,000 --> 0:03:57,000
but even the most ambitious masterpiece

72
0:03:57.758,000 --> 0:03:59,000
can have as its central mission

73
0:04:00.177,000 --> 0:04:04,000
to bring you back to a fragile and personal moment --

74
0:04:04.677,000 --> 0:04:07,000
like this one from the Beethoven Violin Concerto.

75
0:04:07.885,000 --> 0:04:29,000
(Music)

76
0:04:30.271,000 --> 0:04:35,000
It's so simple, so evocative.

77
0:04:36.255,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So many emotions seem to be inside of it.

78
0:04:39.115,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Yet, of course, like all music,

79
0:04:40.843,000 --> 0:04:42,000
it's essentially not about anything.

80
0:04:43.302,000 --> 0:04:46,000
It's just a design of pitches and silence and time.

81
0:04:47.085,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And the pitches, the notes, as you know, are just vibrations.

82
0:04:51.177,000 --> 0:04:53,000
They're locations in the spectrum of sound.

83
0:04:54.13,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And whether we call them 440 per second, A,

84
0:04:58.231,000 --> 0:05:04,000
or 3,729, B flat -- trust me, that's right --

85
0:05:04.949,000 --> 0:05:08,000
they're just phenomena.

86
0:05:09.045,000 --> 0:05:12,000
But the way we react to different combinations of these phenomena

87
0:05:12.802,000 --> 0:05:15,000
is complex and emotional and not totally understood.

88
0:05:16.596,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And the way we react to them has changed radically over the centuries,

89
0:05:20.427,000 --> 0:05:22,000
as have our preferences for them.

90
0:05:22.802,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So for example, in the 11th century,

91
0:05:26.093,000 --> 0:05:29,000
people liked pieces that ended like this.

92
0:05:29.933,000 --> 0:05:4,000
(Music)

93
0:05:41.666,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And in the 17th century, it was more like this.

94
0:05:46.822,000 --> 0:05:51,000
(Music)

95
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And in the 21st century ...

96
0:05:56.102,000 --> 0:06:03,000
(Music)

97
0:06:03.51,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Now your 21st century ears are quite happy with this last chord,

98
0:06:08.829,000 --> 0:06:11,000
even though a while back it would have puzzled or annoyed you

99
0:06:12.302,000 --> 0:06:13,000
or sent some of you running from the room.

100
0:06:13.802,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And the reason you like it

101
0:06:15.218,000 --> 0:06:17,000
is because you've inherited, whether you knew it or not,

102
0:06:17.706,000 --> 0:06:19,000
centuries-worth of changes

103
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
in musical theory, practice and fashion.

104
0:06:23.76,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And in classical music we can follow these changes very, very accurately

105
0:06:28.85,000 --> 0:06:31,000
because of the music's powerful silent partner,

106
0:06:32.833,000 --> 0:06:35,000
the way it's been passed on: notation.

107
0:06:36.462,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Now the impulse to notate,

108
0:06:38.427,000 --> 0:06:4,000
or, more exactly I should say, encode music

109
0:06:41.218,000 --> 0:06:44,000
has been with us for a very long time.

110
0:06:44.276,000 --> 0:06:47,000
In 200 B.C., a man named Sekulos

111
0:06:48.177,000 --> 0:06:5,000
wrote this song for his departed wife

112
0:06:51.127,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and inscribed it on her gravestone

113
0:06:52.718,000 --> 0:06:54,000
in the notational system of the Greeks.

114
0:06:55.343,000 --> 0:07:22,000
(Music)

115
0:07:22.718,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And a thousand years later,

116
0:07:25.135,000 --> 0:07:29,000
this impulse to notate took an entirely different form.

117
0:07:29.145,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And you can see how this happened

118
0:07:30.51,000 --> 0:07:36,000
in these excerpts from the Christmas mass "Puer Natus est nobis,"

119
0:07:37.093,000 --> 0:07:39,000
"For Us is Born."

120
0:07:39.468,000 --> 0:07:43,000
(Music)

121
0:07:44.101,000 --> 0:07:46,000
In the 10th century, little squiggles were used

122
0:07:46.343,000 --> 0:07:49,000
just to indicate the general shape of the tune.

123
0:07:49.385,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And in the 12th century, a line was drawn, like a musical horizon line,

124
0:07:56.427,000 --> 0:07:59,000
to better pinpoint the pitch's location.

125
0:08:00.005,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And then in the 13th century, more lines and new shapes of notes

126
0:08:08.35,000 --> 0:08:11,000
locked in the concept of the tune exactly,

127
0:08:11.968,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and that led to the kind of notation we have today.

128
0:08:14.635,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Well notation not only passed the music on,

129
0:08:18.306,000 --> 0:08:22,000
notating and encoding the music changed its priorities entirely,

130
0:08:22.987,000 --> 0:08:23,000
because it enabled the musicians

131
0:08:24.943,000 --> 0:08:27,000
to imagine music on a much vaster scale.

132
0:08:28.599,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Now inspired moves of improvisation

133
0:08:31.927,000 --> 0:08:35,000
could be recorded, saved, considered, prioritized,

134
0:08:35.927,000 --> 0:08:37,000
made into intricate designs.

135
0:08:38.468,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And from this moment, classical music became

136
0:08:41.708,000 --> 0:08:43,000
what it most essentially is,

137
0:08:44.302,000 --> 0:08:49,000
a dialogue between the two powerful sides of our nature:

138
0:08:49.343,000 --> 0:08:51,000
instinct and intelligence.

139
0:08:51.718,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And there began to be a real difference at this point

140
0:08:55.093,000 --> 0:08:57,000
between the art of improvisation

141
0:08:58.01,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and the art of composition.

142
0:08:59.418,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Now an improviser senses and plays the next cool move,

143
0:09:03.935,000 --> 0:09:06,000
but a composer is considering all possible moves,

144
0:09:07.552,000 --> 0:09:1,000
testing them out, prioritizing them out,

145
0:09:10.871,000 --> 0:09:14,000
until he sees how they can form a powerful and coherent design

146
0:09:15.343,000 --> 0:09:19,000
of ultimate and enduring coolness.

147
0:09:19.75,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Now some of the greatest composers, like Bach,

148
0:09:21.302,000 --> 0:09:23,000
were combinations of these two things.

149
0:09:23.531,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Bach was like a great improviser with a mind of a chess master.

150
0:09:27.816,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Mozart was the same way.

151
0:09:29.76,000 --> 0:09:32,000
But every musician strikes a different balance

152
0:09:33.006,000 --> 0:09:36,000
between faith and reason, instinct and intelligence.

153
0:09:36.802,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And every musical era had different priorities of these things,

154
0:09:41.71,000 --> 0:09:44,000
different things to pass on, different 'whats' and 'hows'.

155
0:09:45.677,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition

156
0:09:50.245,000 --> 0:09:52,000
the big 'what' was to praise God.

157
0:09:53.093,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And by the 1400s, music was being written

158
0:09:55.718,000 --> 0:09:59,000
that tried to mirror God's mind

159
0:09:59.802,000 --> 0:10:02,000
as could be seen in the design of the night sky.

160
0:10:03.718,000 --> 0:10:06,000
The 'how' was a style called polyphony,

161
0:10:07.01,000 --> 0:10:1,000
music of many independently moving voices

162
0:10:10.76,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that suggested the way the planets seemed to move

163
0:10:13.468,000 --> 0:10:15,000
in Ptolemy's geocentric universe.

164
0:10:16.097,000 --> 0:10:19,000
This was truly the music of the spheres.

165
0:10:19.883,000 --> 0:10:48,000
(Music)

166
0:10:49.177,000 --> 0:10:54,000
This is the kind of music that Leonardo DaVinci would have known.

167
0:10:54.427,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And perhaps its tremendous intellectual perfection and serenity

168
0:10:58.025,000 --> 0:11:,000
meant that something new had to happen --

169
0:11:00.885,000 --> 0:11:04,000
a radical new move, which in 1600 is what did happen.

170
0:11:05.01,000 --> 0:11:11,000
(Music) Singer: Ah, bitter blow!

171
0:11:11.843,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Ah, wicked, cruel fate!

172
0:11:16.635,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Ah, baleful stars!

173
0:11:23.552,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Ah, avaricious heaven!

174
0:11:30.51,000 --> 0:11:33,000
MTT: This, of course, was the birth of opera,

175
0:11:34.218,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and its development put music on a radical new course.

176
0:11:36.83,000 --> 0:11:4,000
The what now was not to mirror the mind of God,

177
0:11:41.185,000 --> 0:11:43,000
but to follow the emotion turbulence of man.

178
0:11:44.135,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And the how was harmony,

179
0:11:47.427,000 --> 0:11:5,000
stacking up the pitches to form chords.

180
0:11:50.718,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And the chords, it turned out,

181
0:11:52.468,000 --> 0:11:56,000
were capable of representing incredible varieties of emotions.

182
0:11:56.552,000 --> 0:12:,000
And the basic chords were the ones we still have with us,

183
0:12:01.351,000 --> 0:12:02,000
the triads,

184
0:12:02.612,000 --> 0:12:05,000
either the major one,

185
0:12:05.871,000 --> 0:12:09,000
which we think is happy,

186
0:12:10.479,000 --> 0:12:13,000
or the minor one,

187
0:12:13.824,000 --> 0:12:16,000
which we perceive as sad.

188
0:12:17.76,000 --> 0:12:2,000
But what's the actual difference between these two chords?

189
0:12:21.029,000 --> 0:12:23,000
It's just these two notes in the middle.

190
0:12:23.266,000 --> 0:12:25,000
It's either E natural,

191
0:12:26.231,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and 659 vibrations per second,

192
0:12:30.947,000 --> 0:12:34,000
or E flat, at 622.

193
0:12:35.635,000 --> 0:12:4,000
So the big difference between human happiness and sadness?

194
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
37 freakin' vibrations.

195
0:12:44.01,000 --> 0:12:47,000
So you can see in a system like this

196
0:12:47.927,000 --> 0:12:49,000
there was enormous subtle potential

197
0:12:49.956,000 --> 0:12:5,000
of representing human emotions.

198
0:12:51.831,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And in fact, as man began to understand more

199
0:12:55.564,000 --> 0:12:57,000
his complex and ambivalent nature,

200
0:12:57.727,000 --> 0:12:59,000
harmony grew more complex to reflect it.

201
0:13:00.385,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Turns out it was capable of expressing emotions

202
0:13:04.444,000 --> 0:13:05,000
beyond the ability of words.

203
0:13:06.177,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Now with all this possibility,

204
0:13:09.51,000 --> 0:13:13,000
classical music really took off.

205
0:13:13.593,000 --> 0:13:16,000
It's the time in which the big forms began to arise.

206
0:13:16.989,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And the effects of technology began to be felt also,

207
0:13:21.593,000 --> 0:13:25,000
because printing put music, the scores, the codebooks of music,

208
0:13:26.029,000 --> 0:13:28,000
into the hands of performers everywhere.

209
0:13:28.039,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And new and improved instruments

210
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
made the age of the virtuoso possible.

211
0:13:33.552,000 --> 0:13:36,000
This is when those big forms arose --

212
0:13:36.802,000 --> 0:13:39,000
the symphonies, the sonatas, the concertos.

213
0:13:39.921,000 --> 0:13:43,000
And in these big architectures of time,

214
0:13:43.927,000 --> 0:13:48,000
composers like Beethoven could share the insights of a lifetime.

215
0:13:49.635,000 --> 0:13:51,000
A piece like Beethoven's Fifth

216
0:13:52.095,000 --> 0:13:56,000
basically witnessing how it was possible

217
0:13:56.453,000 --> 0:14:01,000
for him to go from sorrow and anger,

218
0:14:01.97,000 --> 0:14:04,000
over the course of a half an hour,

219
0:14:05.677,000 --> 0:14:08,000
step by exacting step of his route,

220
0:14:09.468,000 --> 0:14:13,000
to the moment when he could make it across to joy.

221
0:14:13.808,000 --> 0:14:35,000
(Music)

222
0:14:36.302,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And it turned out the symphony could be used for more complex issues,

223
0:14:41.343,000 --> 0:14:43,000
like gripping ones of culture,

224
0:14:43.97,000 --> 0:14:45,000
such as nationalism or quest for freedom

225
0:14:46.718,000 --> 0:14:49,000
or the frontiers of sensuality.

226
0:14:50.589,000 --> 0:14:53,000
But whatever direction the music took,

227
0:14:54.36,000 --> 0:14:56,000
one thing until recently was always the same,

228
0:14:56.898,000 --> 0:14:59,000
and that was when the musicians stopped playing,

229
0:14:59.927,000 --> 0:15:01,000
the music stopped.

230
0:15:02.302,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Now this moment so fascinates me.

231
0:15:05.665,000 --> 0:15:06,000
I find it such a profound one.

232
0:15:07.576,000 --> 0:15:08,000
What happens when the music stops?

233
0:15:08.943,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Where does it go? What's left?

234
0:15:12.385,000 --> 0:15:15,000
What sticks with people in the audience at the end of a performance?

235
0:15:15.673,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Is it a melody or a rhythm

236
0:15:17.445,000 --> 0:15:19,000
or a mood or an attitude?

237
0:15:20.225,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And how might that change their lives?

238
0:15:22.494,000 --> 0:15:25,000
To me this is the intimate, personal side of music.

239
0:15:26.427,000 --> 0:15:3,000
It's the passing on part. It's the 'why' part of it.

240
0:15:30.968,000 --> 0:15:33,000
And to me that's the most essential of all.

241
0:15:34.226,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Mostly it's been a person-to-person thing,

242
0:15:38.185,000 --> 0:15:4,000
a teacher-student, performer-audience thing,

243
0:15:40.792,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and then around 1880 came this new technology

244
0:15:43.569,000 --> 0:15:45,000
that first mechanically then through analogs then digitally

245
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
created a new and miraculous way of passing things on,

246
0:15:50.547,000 --> 0:15:51,000
albeit an impersonal one.

247
0:15:52.335,000 --> 0:15:55,000
People could now hear music all the time,

248
0:15:56.052,000 --> 0:15:56,000
even though it wasn't necessary

249
0:15:56.927,000 --> 0:16:,000
for them to play an instrument, read music or even go to concerts.

250
0:16:01.468,000 --> 0:16:06,000
And technology democratized music by making everything available.

251
0:16:06.772,000 --> 0:16:07,000
It spearheaded a cultural revolution

252
0:16:08.533,000 --> 0:16:12,000
in which artists like Caruso and Bessie Smith were on the same footing.

253
0:16:13.393,000 --> 0:16:16,000
And technology pushed composers to tremendous extremes,

254
0:16:17.314,000 --> 0:16:18,000
using computers and synthesizers

255
0:16:19.014,000 --> 0:16:21,000
to create works of intellectually impenetrable complexity

256
0:16:21.933,000 --> 0:16:25,000
beyond the means of performers and audiences.

257
0:16:26.468,000 --> 0:16:28,000
At the same time technology,

258
0:16:28.968,000 --> 0:16:31,000
by taking over the role that notation had always played,

259
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
shifted the balance within music between instinct and intelligence

260
0:16:36.802,000 --> 0:16:39,000
way over to the instinctive side.

261
0:16:40.093,000 --> 0:16:41,000
The culture in which we live now

262
0:16:41.983,000 --> 0:16:44,000
is awash with music of improvisation

263
0:16:45.052,000 --> 0:16:46,000
that's been sliced, diced, layered

264
0:16:46.677,000 --> 0:16:49,000
and, God knows, distributed and sold.

265
0:16:50.427,000 --> 0:16:53,000
What's the long-term effect of this on us or on music?

266
0:16:53.714,000 --> 0:16:54,000
Nobody knows.

267
0:16:54.721,000 --> 0:16:57,000
The question remains: What happens when the music stops?

268
0:16:58.443,000 --> 0:16:59,000
What sticks with people?

269
0:17:00.425,000 --> 0:17:03,000
Now that we have unlimited access to music, what does stick with us?

270
0:17:04.377,000 --> 0:17:06,000
Well let me show you a story of what I mean

271
0:17:06.797,000 --> 0:17:07,000
by "really sticking with us."

272
0:17:08.589,000 --> 0:17:11,000
I was visiting a cousin of mine in an old age home,

273
0:17:11.677,000 --> 0:17:14,000
and I spied a very shaky old man

274
0:17:15.012,000 --> 0:17:17,000
making his way across the room on a walker.

275
0:17:17.289,000 --> 0:17:19,000
He came over to a piano that was there,

276
0:17:19.805,000 --> 0:17:23,000
and he balanced himself and began playing something like this.

277
0:17:24.135,000 --> 0:17:28,000
(Music)

278
0:17:28.67,000 --> 0:17:36,000
And he said something like, "Me ... boy ... symphony ... Beethoven."

279
0:17:37.533,000 --> 0:17:38,000
And I suddenly got it,

280
0:17:39.085,000 --> 0:17:41,000
and I said, "Friend, by any chance are you trying to play this?"

281
0:17:42.005,000 --> 0:17:46,000
(Music)

282
0:17:46.956,000 --> 0:17:48,000
And he said, "Yes, yes. I was a little boy.

283
0:17:49.385,000 --> 0:17:53,000
The symphony: Isaac Stern, the concerto, I heard it."

284
0:17:53.981,000 --> 0:17:54,000
And I thought, my God,

285
0:17:55.664,000 --> 0:17:57,000
how much must this music mean to this man

286
0:17:58.51,000 --> 0:18:02,000
that he would get himself out of his bed, across the room

287
0:18:02.627,000 --> 0:18:05,000
to recover the memory of this music

288
0:18:05.927,000 --> 0:18:07,000
that, after everything else in his life is sloughing away,

289
0:18:08.835,000 --> 0:18:1,000
still means so much to him?

290
0:18:11.093,000 --> 0:18:14,000
Well, that's why I take every performance so seriously,

291
0:18:15.016,000 --> 0:18:16,000
why it matters to me so much.

292
0:18:16.766,000 --> 0:18:19,000
I never know who might be there, who might be absorbing it

293
0:18:20.218,000 --> 0:18:21,000
and what will happen to it in their life.

294
0:18:21.968,000 --> 0:18:26,000
But now I'm excited that there's more chance than ever before possible

295
0:18:27.055,000 --> 0:18:28,000
of sharing this music.

296
0:18:28.385,000 --> 0:18:29,000
That's what drives my interest in projects

297
0:18:30.131,000 --> 0:18:33,000
like the TV series "Keeping Score" with the San Francisco Symphony

298
0:18:33.51,000 --> 0:18:35,000
that looks at the backstories of music,

299
0:18:36.077,000 --> 0:18:39,000
and working with the young musicians at the New World Symphony

300
0:18:39.254,000 --> 0:18:4,000
on projects that explore the potential

301
0:18:40.848,000 --> 0:18:43,000
of the new performing arts centers

302
0:18:44.354,000 --> 0:18:46,000
for both entertainment and education.

303
0:18:46.728,000 --> 0:18:47,000
And of course, the New World Symphony

304
0:18:48.695,000 --> 0:18:51,000
led to the YouTube Symphony and projects on the internet

305
0:18:52.343,000 --> 0:18:55,000
that reach out to musicians and audiences all over the world.

306
0:18:55.347,000 --> 0:18:59,000
And the exciting thing is all this is just a prototype.

307
0:19:00.127,000 --> 0:19:02,000
There's just a role here for so many people --

308
0:19:02.381,000 --> 0:19:04,000
teachers, parents, performers --

309
0:19:05.177,000 --> 0:19:07,000
to be explorers together.

310
0:19:08.037,000 --> 0:19:1,000
Sure, the big events attract a lot of attention,

311
0:19:10.822,000 --> 0:19:13,000
but what really matters is what goes on every single day.

312
0:19:14.302,000 --> 0:19:18,000
We need your perspectives, your curiosity, your voices.

313
0:19:18.772,000 --> 0:19:21,000
And it excites me now to meet people

314
0:19:21.862,000 --> 0:19:24,000
who are hikers, chefs, code writers, taxi drivers,

315
0:19:24.96,000 --> 0:19:26,000
people I never would have guessed who loved the music

316
0:19:27.725,000 --> 0:19:28,000
and who are passing it on.

317
0:19:28.84,000 --> 0:19:31,000
You don't need to worry about knowing anything.

318
0:19:32.581,000 --> 0:19:35,000
If you're curious, if you have a capacity for wonder, if you're alive,

319
0:19:36.343,000 --> 0:19:39,000
you know all that you need to know.

320
0:19:39.403,000 --> 0:19:41,000
You can start anywhere. Ramble a bit.

321
0:19:41.612,000 --> 0:19:45,000
Follow traces. Get lost. Be surprised, amused inspired.

322
0:19:45.716,000 --> 0:19:49,000
All that 'what', all that 'how' is out there

323
0:19:50.335,000 --> 0:19:52,000
waiting for you to discover its 'why',

324
0:19:52.829,000 --> 0:19:55,000
to dive in and pass it on.

325
0:19:55.887,000 --> 0:19:57,000
Thank you.

326
0:19:58.385,000 --> 0:20:05,000
(Applause)

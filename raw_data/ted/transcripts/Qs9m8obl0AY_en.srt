1
0:00:12.88,000 --> 0:00:15,000
You are a high-ranking military service member

2
0:00:16.28,000 --> 0:00:17,000
deployed to Afghanistan.

3
0:00:19.84,000 --> 0:00:21,000
You are responsible for the lives

4
0:00:22.4,000 --> 0:00:24,000
of hundreds of men and women,

5
0:00:24.56,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and your base is under attack.

6
0:00:27.855,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Incoming mortar rounds are exploding all around you.

7
0:00:32.08,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Struggling to see through the dust and the smoke,

8
0:00:35.4,000 --> 0:00:37,000
you do your best to assist the wounded

9
0:00:38.04,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and then crawl to a nearby bunker.

10
0:00:41.309,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Conscious but dazed by the blasts,

11
0:00:44.04,000 --> 0:00:48,000
you lay on your side and attempt to process what has just happened.

12
0:00:49.8,000 --> 0:00:51,000
As you regain your vision,

13
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
you see a bloody face

14
0:00:54.44,000 --> 0:00:55,000
staring back at you.

15
0:00:57.48,000 --> 0:00:59,000
The image is terrifying,

16
0:01:00.36,000 --> 0:01:02,000
but you quickly come to understand

17
0:01:02.88,000 --> 0:01:03,000
it's not real.

18
0:01:06.24,000 --> 0:01:11,000
This vision continues to visit you multiple times a day and in your sleep.

19
0:01:11.36,000 --> 0:01:14,000
You choose not to tell anyone for fear of losing your job

20
0:01:14.72,000 --> 0:01:15,000
or being seen as weak.

21
0:01:18.08,000 --> 0:01:19,000
You give the vision a name,

22
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Bloody Face in Bunker,

23
0:01:22.12,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and call it BFIB for short.

24
0:01:25.8,000 --> 0:01:28,000
You keep BFIB locked away in your mind,

25
0:01:29.04,000 --> 0:01:3,000
secretly haunting you,

26
0:01:30.84,000 --> 0:01:33,000
for the next seven years.

27
0:01:35.68,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Now close your eyes.

28
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Can you see BFIB?

29
0:01:43.84,000 --> 0:01:45,000
If you can, you're beginning to see the face

30
0:01:46.4,000 --> 0:01:48,000
of the invisible wounds of war,

31
0:01:48.84,000 --> 0:01:5,000
commonly known as post-traumatic stress disorder

32
0:01:51.72,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and traumatic brain injury.

33
0:01:54.32,000 --> 0:01:56,000
While I can't say I have post-traumatic stress disorder,

34
0:01:57.04,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I've never been a stranger to it.

35
0:01:59.8,000 --> 0:02:03,000
When I was a little girl, I would visit my grandparents every summer.

36
0:02:04.68,000 --> 0:02:05,000
It was my grandfather

37
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:09,000
who introduced me to the effects of combat on the psyche.

38
0:02:10.64,000 --> 0:02:13,000
While my grandfather was serving as a Marine in the Korean War,

39
0:02:14.36,000 --> 0:02:17,000
a bullet pierced his neck and rendered him unable to cry out.

40
0:02:19.28,000 --> 0:02:21,000
He watched as a corpsman passed him over,

41
0:02:21.919,000 --> 0:02:22,000
declaring him a goner,

42
0:02:23.48,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and then leaving him to die.

43
0:02:26.96,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Years later, after his physical wounds had healed

44
0:02:29.6,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and he'd returned home,

45
0:02:31.24,000 --> 0:02:34,000
he rarely spoke of his experiences in waking life.

46
0:02:35.88,000 --> 0:02:37,000
But at night I would hear him shouting obscenities

47
0:02:38.56,000 --> 0:02:39,000
from his room down the hall.

48
0:02:41.08,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And during the day I would announce myself as I entered the room,

49
0:02:44.68,000 --> 0:02:46,000
careful not to startle or agitate him.

50
0:02:48.88,000 --> 0:02:5,000
He lived out the remainder of his days

51
0:02:51.44,000 --> 0:02:53,000
isolated and tight-lipped,

52
0:02:53.56,000 --> 0:02:55,000
never finding a way to express himself,

53
0:02:56.36,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and I didn't yet have the tools to guide him.

54
0:03:01.56,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I wouldn't have a name for my grandfather's condition

55
0:03:04.12,000 --> 0:03:05,000
until I was in my 20s.

56
0:03:06.88,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Seeking a graduate degree in art therapy,

57
0:03:09.96,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I naturally gravitated towards the study of trauma.

58
0:03:14.48,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And while sitting in class learning about post-traumatic stress disorder,

59
0:03:17.96,000 --> 0:03:18,000
or PTSD for short,

60
0:03:20.32,000 --> 0:03:23,000
my mission to help service members who suffered like my grandfather

61
0:03:24.04,000 --> 0:03:25,000
began to take form.

62
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
We've had various names for post-traumatic stress

63
0:03:29.84,000 --> 0:03:3,000
throughout the history of war:

64
0:03:32.48,000 --> 0:03:33,000
homesickness,

65
0:03:34.4,000 --> 0:03:35,000
soldier's heart,

66
0:03:36.6,000 --> 0:03:37,000
shell shock,

67
0:03:38.64,000 --> 0:03:4,000
thousand-yard stare, for instance.

68
0:03:41.76,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And while I was pursuing my degree, a new war was raging,

69
0:03:45.44,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and thanks to modern body armor and military vehicles,

70
0:03:48.68,000 --> 0:03:51,000
service members were surviving blast injuries they wouldn't have before.

71
0:03:53.8,000 --> 0:03:55,000
But the invisible wounds were reaching new levels,

72
0:03:56.64,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and this pushed military doctors and researchers

73
0:03:59.92,000 --> 0:04:04,000
to try and truly understand the effects that traumatic brain injury, or TBI,

74
0:04:05.24,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and PTSD have on the brain.

75
0:04:08.76,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Due to advances in technology and neuroimaging,

76
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
we now know there's an actual shutdown in the Broca's,

77
0:04:15.32,000 --> 0:04:19,000
or the speech-language area of the brain, after an individual experiences trauma.

78
0:04:21.4,000 --> 0:04:22,000
This physiological change,

79
0:04:23.24,000 --> 0:04:26,000
or speechless terror as it's often called,

80
0:04:26.36,000 --> 0:04:28,000
coupled with mental health stigma,

81
0:04:28.68,000 --> 0:04:29,000
the fear of being judged

82
0:04:30.44,000 --> 0:04:31,000
or misunderstood,

83
0:04:31.92,000 --> 0:04:33,000
possibly even removed from their current duties,

84
0:04:34.6,000 --> 0:04:38,000
has led to the invisible struggles of our servicemen and women.

85
0:04:39.84,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Generation after generation of veterans

86
0:04:43.44,000 --> 0:04:46,000
have chosen not to talk about their experiences,

87
0:04:46.72,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and suffer in solitude.

88
0:04:50.96,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I had my work cut out for me when I got my first job

89
0:04:53.92,000 --> 0:04:56,000
as an art therapist at the nation's largest military medical center,

90
0:04:57.6,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Walter Reed.

91
0:04:59.48,000 --> 0:05:02,000
After working for a few years on a locked-in patient psychiatric unit,

92
0:05:03.4,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I eventually transferred to the National Intrepid Center of Excellence, NICoE,

93
0:05:08.32,000 --> 0:05:11,000
which leads TBI care for active duty service members.

94
0:05:12.76,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Now, I believed in art therapy,

95
0:05:14.96,000 --> 0:05:17,000
but I was going to have to convince service members,

96
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:21,000
big, tough, strong, manly military men,

97
0:05:21.76,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and some women too,

98
0:05:23.52,000 --> 0:05:27,000
to give art-making as a psychotherapeutic intervention a try.

99
0:05:28.68,000 --> 0:05:31,000
The results have been nothing short of spectacular.

100
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Vivid, symbolic artwork

101
0:05:36.4,000 --> 0:05:38,000
is being created by our servicemen and women,

102
0:05:39.4,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and every work of art tells a story.

103
0:05:43.4,000 --> 0:05:45,000
We've observed that the process of art therapy bypasses

104
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
the speech-language issue with the brain.

105
0:05:49.04,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Art-making accesses the same sensory areas of the brain that encode trauma.

106
0:05:54.48,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Service members can use the art-making to work through their experiences

107
0:05:57.96,000 --> 0:05:58,000
in a nonthreatening way.

108
0:06:00.28,000 --> 0:06:02,000
They can then apply words to their physical creations,

109
0:06:03.2,000 --> 0:06:06,000
reintegrating the left and the right hemispheres of the brain.

110
0:06:08.52,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Now, we've seen this can work with all forms of art --

111
0:06:12.12,000 --> 0:06:14,000
drawing, painting, collage --

112
0:06:15.4,000 --> 0:06:17,000
but what seems to have the most impact

113
0:06:18.68,000 --> 0:06:19,000
is mask-making.

114
0:06:21.12,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Finally, these invisible wounds don't just have a name,

115
0:06:25.8,000 --> 0:06:26,000
they have a face.

116
0:06:29.28,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And when service members create these masks,

117
0:06:31.48,000 --> 0:06:34,000
it allows them to come to grips, literally, with their trauma.

118
0:06:35.68,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And it's amazing how often that enables them

119
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:41,000
to break through the trauma and start to heal.

120
0:06:42.8,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Remember BFIB?

121
0:06:46.32,000 --> 0:06:49,000
That was a real experience for one of my patients,

122
0:06:49.36,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and when he created his mask,

123
0:06:50.84,000 --> 0:06:52,000
he was able to let go of that haunting image.

124
0:06:54.8,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Initially, it was a daunting process for the service member,

125
0:06:57.96,000 --> 0:06:59,000
but eventually he began to think of BFIB as the mask,

126
0:07:00.96,000 --> 0:07:01,000
not his internal wound,

127
0:07:02.64,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and he would go to leave each session,

128
0:07:04.52,000 --> 0:07:07,000
he would hand me the mask, and say, "Melissa, take care of him."

129
0:07:08.44,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Eventually, we placed BFIB in a box to further contain him,

130
0:07:12.76,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and when the service member went to leave the NICoE,

131
0:07:15.24,000 --> 0:07:17,000
he chose to leave BFIB behind.

132
0:07:18.24,000 --> 0:07:2,000
A year later, he had only seen BFIB twice,

133
0:07:20.92,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and both times BFIB was smiling

134
0:07:22.64,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and the service member didn't feel anxious.

135
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Now, whenever that service member is haunted by some traumatic memory,

136
0:07:29.36,000 --> 0:07:3,000
he continues to paint.

137
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Every time he paints these disturbing images,

138
0:07:34.64,000 --> 0:07:36,000
he sees them less or not at all.

139
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Philosophers have told us for thousands of years

140
0:07:42.72,000 --> 0:07:43,000
that the power to create

141
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:46,000
is very closely linked to the power to destroy.

142
0:07:47.72,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Now science is showing us that the part of the brain

143
0:07:50.2,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that registers a traumatic wound

144
0:07:52.24,000 --> 0:07:54,000
can be the part of the brain where healing happens too.

145
0:07:55.8,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And art therapy is showing us how to make that connection.

146
0:08:00.32,000 --> 0:08:01,000
We asked one of our service members

147
0:08:02.24,000 --> 0:08:05,000
to describe how mask-making impacted his treatment,

148
0:08:05.6,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and this is what he had to say.

149
0:08:07.76,000 --> 0:08:1,000
(Video) Service Member: You sort of just zone out into the mask.

150
0:08:10.84,000 --> 0:08:11,000
You zone out into the drawing,

151
0:08:12.32,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and for me, it just released the block,

152
0:08:16.92,000 --> 0:08:18,000
so I was able to do it.

153
0:08:19.6,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And then when I looked at it after two days, I was like,

154
0:08:23.24,000 --> 0:08:26,000
"Holy crap, here's the picture, here's the key, here's the puzzle,"

155
0:08:26.6,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and then from there it just soared.

156
0:08:28.68,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I mean, from there my treatment just when out of sight,

157
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
because they were like, Kurt, explain this, explain this.

158
0:08:34.88,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And for the first time in 23 years,

159
0:08:36.72,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I could actually talk about stuff openly to, like, anybody.

160
0:08:39.64,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I could talk to you about it right now if I wanted to,

161
0:08:42.76,000 --> 0:08:44,000
because it unlocked it.

162
0:08:45.44,000 --> 0:08:46,000
It's just amazing.

163
0:08:46.72,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And it allowed me to put 23 years of PTSD

164
0:08:52.28,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and TBI stuff together in one place

165
0:08:58.28,000 --> 0:09:,000
that has never happened before.

166
0:09:02.04,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Sorry.

167
0:09:03.92,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Melissa Walker: Over the past five years,

168
0:09:05.92,000 --> 0:09:08,000
we've had over 1,000 masks made.

169
0:09:09.76,000 --> 0:09:1,000
It's pretty amazing, isn't it?

170
0:09:12.64,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Thank you.

171
0:09:13.88,000 --> 0:09:15,000
(Applause)

172
0:09:19.44,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I wish I could have shared this process with my grandfather,

173
0:09:23.8,000 --> 0:09:25,000
but I know that he would be thrilled

174
0:09:27.04,000 --> 0:09:28,000
that we are finding ways

175
0:09:28.72,000 --> 0:09:31,000
to help today's and tomorrow's service members heal,

176
0:09:33.4,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and finding the resources within them

177
0:09:36.64,000 --> 0:09:37,000
that they can call upon

178
0:09:38.36,000 --> 0:09:4,000
to heal themselves.

179
0:09:41.68,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Thank you.

180
0:09:42.92,000 --> 0:09:46,000
(Applause)

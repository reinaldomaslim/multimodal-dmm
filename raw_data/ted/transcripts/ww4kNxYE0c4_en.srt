1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I first became fascinated with octopus at an early age.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I grew up in Mobile, Alabama --

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
somebody's got to be from Mobile, right? --

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and Mobile sits at the confluence of five rivers,

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
forming this beautiful delta.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And the delta has alligators crawling

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
in and out of rivers filled with fish

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and cypress trees dripping with snakes,

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
birds of every flavor.

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
It's an absolute magical wonderland to live in --

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
if you're a kid interested in animals, to grow up in.

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And this delta water flows to Mobile Bay, and finally into the Gulf of Mexico.

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And I remember my first real contact with octopus

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
was probably at age five or six.

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I was in the gulf, and I was swimming around and saw a little octopus on the bottom.

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And I reached down and picked him up, and immediately

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
became fascinated and impressed by its speed and its strength and agility.

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
It was prying my fingers apart and moving to the back of my hand.

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
It was all I could do to hold onto this amazing creature.

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Then it sort of calmed down in the palms of my hands

21
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and started flashing colors,

22
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
just pulsing all of these colors.

23
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And as I looked at it, it kind of tucked its arms under it,

24
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
raised into a spherical shape

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and turned chocolate brown with two white stripes.

26
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I'm going, "My gosh!" I had never seen anything like this in my life!

27
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So I marveled for a moment, and then decided it was time to release him,

28
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
so I put him down.

29
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
The octopus left my hands and then did the damnedest thing:

30
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
It landed on the bottom in the rubble

31
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and -- fwoosh! -- vanished

32
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
right before my eyes.

33
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And I knew, right then, at age six,

34
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that is an animal that I want to learn more about. So I did.

35
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And I went off to college and got a degree in marine zoology,

36
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and then moved to Hawaii and entered graduate school

37
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
at the University of Hawaii.

38
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And while a student at Hawaii, I worked at the Waikiki Aquarium.

39
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanks

40
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
but not a lot of invertebrate displays,

41
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
and being the spineless guy, I thought, well

42
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I'll just go out in the field and collect these wonderful animals

43
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I had been learning about as a student

44
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and bring them in, and I built these elaborate sets and put them on display.

45
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Now, the fish in the tanks were gorgeous to look at,

46
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
but they didn't really interact with people.

47
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
But the octopus did.

48
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
If you walked up to an octopus tank,

49
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
especially early in the morning before anyone arrived,

50
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
the octopus would rise up and look at you

51
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and you're thinking, "Is that guy really looking at me? He is looking at me!"

52
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And you walk up to the front of the tank. Then you realize

53
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
that these animals all have different personalities:

54
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Some of them would hold their ground,

55
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
others would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks,

56
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and one in particular, this amazing animal ...

57
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I went up to the front of the tank, and he's just staring at me,

58
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and he had little horns come up above his eyes.

59
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So I went right up to the front of the tank --

60
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I was three or four inches from the front glass --

61
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and the octopus was sitting on a perch, a little rock,

62
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and he came off the rock and he also came down right to the front of the glass.

63
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
So I was staring at this animal about six or seven inches away,

64
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and at that time I could actually focus that close;

65
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
now as I look at my fuzzy fingers I realize those days are long gone.

66
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Anyway, there we were, staring at each other,

67
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and he reaches down and grabs an armful of gravel

68
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and releases it in the jet of water entering the tank

69
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
from the filtration system,

70
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and -- chk chk chk chk chk! -- this gravel hits the front of the glass and falls down.

71
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
He reaches up, takes another armful of gravel, releases it --

72
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
chk chk chk chk chk! -- same thing.

73
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Then he lifts another arm and I lift an arm.

74
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Then he lifts another arm and I lift another arm.

75
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And then I realize the octopus won the arms race,

76
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
because I was out and he had six left. (Laughter)

77
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
But the only way I can describe what I was seeing that day

78
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
was that this octopus was playing,

79
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
which is a pretty sophisticated behavior for a mere invertebrate.

80
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So, about three years into my degree,

81
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
a funny thing happened on the way to the office,

82
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
which actually changed the course of my life.

83
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
A man came into the aquarium. It's a long story, but essentially

84
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
he sent me and a couple of friends of mine to the South Pacific

85
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
to collect animals for him,

86
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and as we left, he gave us two 16-millimeter movie cameras.

87
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
He said, "Make a movie about this expedition."

88
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
"OK, a couple of biologists making a movie --

89
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
this'll be interesting,"

90
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and off we went. And we did, we made a movie,

91
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
which had to be the worst movie ever made

92
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
in the history of movie making,

93
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
but it was a blast. I had so much fun.

94
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And I remember that proverbial light going off in my head,

95
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
thinking, "Wait a minute.

96
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Maybe I can do this all the time.

97
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Yeah, I'll be a filmmaker."

98
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So I literally came back from that job,

99
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
quit school, hung my filmmaking shingle

100
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and just never told anyone that I didn't know what I was doing.

101
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
It's been a good ride.

102
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And what I learned in school though was really beneficial.

103
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
If you're a wildlife filmmaker

104
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and you're going out into the field to film animals,

105
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
especially behavior,

106
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
it helps to have a fundamental background

107
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
on who these animals are,

108
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
how they work and, you know, a bit about their behaviors.

109
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
But where I really learned about octopus

110
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
was in the field, as a filmmaker

111
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
making films with them,

112
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
where you're allowed to spend large periods of time

113
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
with the animals, seeing octopus being octopus

114
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
in their ocean homes.

115
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I remember I took a trip to Australia,

116
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
went to an island called One Tree Island.

117
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And apparently, evolution had occurred

118
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
at a pretty rapid rate on One Tree,

119
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
between the time they named it and the time I arrived,

120
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
because I'm sure there were at least three trees

121
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
on that island when we were there.

122
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Anyway, one tree is situated right next to

123
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
a beautiful coral reef.

124
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
In fact, there's a surge channel

125
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
where the tide is moving back and forth, twice a day, pretty rapidly.

126
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And there's a beautiful reef,

127
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
very complex reef, with lots of animals,

128
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
including a lot of octopus.

129
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And not uniquely

130
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
but certainly, the octopus in Australia

131
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
are masters at camouflage.

132
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
As a matter of fact,

133
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
there's one right there.

134
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So our first challenge was to find these things,

135
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and that was a challenge, indeed.

136
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
But the idea is, we were there for a month

137
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and I wanted to acclimate the animals to us

138
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
so that we could see behaviors without disturbing them.

139
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So the first week was pretty much spent

140
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
just getting as close as we could,

141
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
every day a little closer, a little closer, a little closer.

142
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And you knew what the limit was: they would start getting twitchy

143
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and you'd back up, come back in a few hours.

144
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And after the first week, they ignored us.

145
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
It was like, "I don't know what that thing is, but he's no threat to me."

146
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So they went on about their business

147
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and from a foot away, we're watching mating

148
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and courting and fighting

149
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and it is just an unbelievable experience.

150
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And one of the most fantastic displays

151
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that I remember, or at least visually,

152
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
was a foraging behavior.

153
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And they had a lot of different techniques

154
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
that they would use for foraging,

155
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
but this particular one used vision.

156
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And they would see a coral head,

157
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
maybe 10 feet away,

158
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and start moving over toward that coral head.

159
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And I don't know whether they actually saw crab in it, or imagined that one might be,

160
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
but whatever the case, they would leap off the bottom

161
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and go through the water and land right on top of this coral head,

162
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and then the web between the arms

163
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
would completely engulf the coral head,

164
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
and they would fish out, swim for crabs.

165
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And as soon as the crabs touched the arm, it was lights out.

166
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And I always wondered what happened under that web.

167
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So we created a way to find out, (Laughter)

168
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and I got my first look at that famous beak in action.

169
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
It was fantastic.

170
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
If you're going to make a lot of films about a particular group of animals,

171
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
you might as well pick one that's fairly common.

172
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And octopus are, they live in all the oceans.

173
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
They also live deep.

174
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And I can't say octopus are responsible

175
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
for my really strong interest

176
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
in getting in subs and going deep,

177
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
but whatever the case, I like that.

178
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
It's like nothing you've ever done.

179
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
If you ever really want to get away from it all

180
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and see something that you have never seen,

181
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and have an excellent chance of seeing something

182
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
no one has ever seen, get in a sub.

183
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
You climb in, seal the hatch, turn on a little oxygen,

184
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
turn on the scrubber,

185
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
which removes the CO2 in the air you breathe, and they chuck you overboard.

186
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Down you go. There's no connection to the surface

187
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
apart from a pretty funky radio.

188
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And as you go down, the washing machine

189
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
at the surface calms down.

190
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And it gets quiet.

191
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
And it starts getting really nice.

192
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And as you go deeper, that lovely, blue water you were launched in

193
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
gives way to darker and darker blue.

194
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And finally, it's a rich lavender,

195
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and after a couple of thousand feet, it's ink black.

196
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And now you've entered the realm

197
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
of the mid-water community.

198
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
You could give an entire talk

199
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
about the creatures that live in the mid-water.

200
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Suffice to say though, as far as I'm concerned,

201
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
without question, the most bizarre designs

202
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and outrageous behaviors

203
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
are in the animals that live in the mid-water community.

204
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
But we're just going to zip right past this area,

205
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
this area that includes about 95 percent

206
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
of the living space on our planet

207
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and go to the mid-ocean ridge, which I think is even more extraordinary.

208
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
The mid-ocean ridge is a huge mountain range,

209
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
40,000 miles long, snaking around the entire globe.

210
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And they're big mountains, thousands of feet tall,

211
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
some of which are tens of thousands of feet

212
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and bust through the surface,

213
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
creating islands like Hawaii.

214
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And the top of this mountain range

215
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
is splitting apart, creating a rift valley.

216
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And when you dive into that rift valley, that's where the action is

217
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
because literally thousands of active volcanoes

218
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
are going off at any point in time

219
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
all along this 40,000 mile range.

220
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And as these tectonic plates are spreading apart,

221
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
magma, lava is coming up and filling those gaps,

222
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and you're looking land -- new land --

223
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
being created right before your eyes.

224
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And over the tops of them is 3,000 to 4,000 meters of water

225
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
creating enormous pressure,

226
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
forcing water down through the cracks toward the center of the earth,

227
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
until it hits a magma chamber

228
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
where it becomes superheated

229
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and supersaturated with minerals,

230
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
reverses its flow and starts shooting back to the surface

231
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and is ejected out of the earth like a geyser at Yellowstone.

232
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
In fact, this whole area

233
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
is like a Yellowstone National Park with all of the trimmings.

234
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And this vent fluid is about 600 or 700 degrees F.

235
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
The surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing.

236
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
So it immediately cools,

237
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and it can no longer hold in suspension

238
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
all of the material that it's dissolved,

239
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and it precipitates out, forming black smoke.

240
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And it forms these towers, these chimneys

241
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
that are 10, 20, 30 feet tall.

242
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And all along the sides of these chimneys

243
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
is shimmering with heat and loaded with life.

244
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
You've got black smokers going all over the place

245
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and chimneys that have tube worms

246
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that might be eight to 10 feet long.

247
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And out of the tops of these tube worms

248
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
are these beautiful red plumes.

249
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And living amongst the tangle of tube worms

250
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
is an entire community of animals:

251
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
shrimp, fish, lobsters, crab,

252
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
clams and swarms of arthropods

253
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
that are playing that dangerous game

254
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
between over here is scalding hot and freezing cold.

255
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And this whole ecosystem

256
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
wasn't even known about

257
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
until 33 years ago.

258
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And it completely threw science on its head.

259
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
It made scientists rethink

260
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
where life on Earth might have actually begun.

261
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And before the discovery of these vents,

262
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
all life on Earth, the key to life on Earth,

263
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
was believed to be the sun and photosynthesis.

264
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
But down there, there is no sun,

265
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
there is no photosynthesis;

266
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
it's chemosynthetic environment down there driving it,

267
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and it's all so ephemeral.

268
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
You might film this

269
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
unbelievable hydrothermal vent,

270
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
which you think at the time has to be on another planet.

271
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
It's amazing to think that this is actually on earth;

272
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
it looks like aliens in an alien environment.

273
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
But you go back to the same vent eight years later

274
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and it can be completely dead.

275
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
There's no hot water.

276
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
All of the animals are gone, they're dead,

277
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and the chimneys are still there

278
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
creating a really nice ghost town,

279
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
an eerie, spooky ghost town,

280
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
but essentially devoid of animals, of course.

281
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
But 10 miles down the ridge...

282
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
pshhh! There's another volcano going.

283
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And there's a whole new hydrothermal vent community that has been formed.

284
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And this kind of life and death of hydrothermal vent communities

285
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
is going on every 30 or 40 years

286
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
all along the ridge.

287
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And that ephemeral nature

288
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
of the hydrothermal vent community

289
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
isn't really different from some of the

290
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
areas that I've seen

291
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
in 35 years of traveling around, making films.

292
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Where you go and film a really nice sequence at a bay.

293
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And you go back, and I'm at home,

294
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and I'm thinking, "Okay, what can I shoot ...

295
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Ah! I know where I can shoot that.

296
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
There's this beautiful bay, lots of soft corals and stomatopods."

297
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And you show up, and it's dead.

298
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
There's no coral, algae growing on it, and the water's pea soup.

299
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
You think, "Well, what happened?"

300
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And you turn around,

301
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and there's a hillside behind you with a neighborhood going in,

302
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and bulldozers are pushing piles of soil back and forth.

303
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And over here

304
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
there's a golf course going in.

305
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And this is the tropics.

306
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
It's raining like crazy here.

307
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
So this rainwater is flooding down the hillside,

308
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
carrying with it sediments from the construction site,

309
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
smothering the coral and killing it.

310
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
And fertilizers and pesticides

311
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
are flowing into the bay from the golf course --

312
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
the pesticides killing all the larvae and little animals,

313
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
fertilizer creating this beautiful plankton bloom --

314
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and there's your pea soup.

315
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
But, encouragingly, I've seen just the opposite.

316
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
I've been to a place that was a pretty trashed bay.

317
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And I looked at it, just said, "Yuck,"

318
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and go and work on the other side of the island.

319
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Five years later, come back,

320
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and that same bay is now gorgeous. It's beautiful.

321
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
It's got living coral, fish all over the place,

322
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
crystal clear water, and you go, "How did that happen?"

323
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Well, how it happened is

324
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
the local community galvanized.

325
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
They recognized what was happening on the hillside and put a stop to it;

326
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
enacted laws and made permits required

327
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
to do responsible construction

328
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and golf course maintenance

329
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and stopped the sediments flowing into the bay,

330
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and stopped the chemicals flowing into the bay,

331
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and the bay recovered.

332
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
The ocean has an amazing ability

333
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
to recover, if we'll just leave it alone.

334
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
I think Margaret Mead

335
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
said it best.

336
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
She said that a small group of thoughtful people

337
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
could change the world.

338
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.

339
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And a small group of thoughtful people

340
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
changed that bay.

341
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
I'm a big fan of grassroots organizations.

342
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
I've been to a lot of lectures

343
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
where, at the end of it, inevitably,

344
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
one of the first questions that comes up is,

345
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
"But, but what can I do?

346
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
I'm an individual. I'm one person.

347
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And these problems are so large and global, and it's just overwhelming."

348
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Fair enough question.

349
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
My answer to that is don't look

350
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
at the big, overwhelming issues of the world.

351
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Look in your own backyard.

352
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Look in your heart, actually.

353
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
What do you really care about that isn't right where you live?

354
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
And fix it.

355
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Create a healing zone in your neighborhood

356
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and encourage others to do the same.

357
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And maybe these healing zones can sprinkle a map,

358
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
little dots on a map.

359
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And in fact, the way that we can communicate today --

360
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
where Alaska is instantly knowing what's going on in China,

361
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
and the Kiwis did this, and then over in England they tried to ...

362
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and everybody is talking to everyone else --

363
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
it's not isolated points on a map anymore,

364
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
it's a network we've created.

365
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And maybe these healing zones can start growing,

366
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and possibly even overlap, and good things can happen.

367
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
So that's how I answer that question.

368
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Look in your own backyard, in fact, look in the mirror.

369
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
What can you do that is more responsible

370
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
than what you're doing now?

371
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
And do that, and spread the word.

372
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
The vent community animals

373
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
can't really do much

374
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
about the life and death

375
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
that's going on where they live, but up here we can.

376
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
In theory, we're thinking, rational human beings.

377
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
And we can make changes to our behavior

378
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
that will influence and affect the environment,

379
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
like those people changed the health of that bay.

380
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Now, Sylvia's TED Prize wish

381
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
was to beseech us to do anything we could,

382
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
everything we could,

383
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
to set aside not pin pricks,

384
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
but significant expanses

385
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
of the ocean for preservation,

386
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
"hope spots," she calls them.

387
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
And I applaud that. I loudly applaud that.

388
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
And it's my hope that some of these "hope spots"

389
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
can be in the deep ocean,

390
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
an area that has historically

391
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
been seriously neglected, if not abused.

392
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
The term "deep six" comes to mind:

393
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
"If it's too big or too toxic for a landfill,

394
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
deep six it!"

395
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
So, I hope that we can also keep

396
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
some of these "hope spots" in the deep sea.

397
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Now, I don't get a wish,

398
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
but I certainly can say

399
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
that I will do anything I can

400
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
to support Sylvia Earle's wish.

401
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
And that I do.

402
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Thank you very much. (Applause)

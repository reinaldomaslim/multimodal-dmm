1
0:00:13.052,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Every science fiction writer

2
0:00:15.001,000 --> 0:00:19,000
has a story about a time when the future arrived too soon.

3
0:00:21.12,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I have a lot of those stories.

4
0:00:23.126,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Like, OK, for example:

5
0:00:24.837,000 --> 0:00:28,000
years ago, I was writing a story where the government

6
0:00:28.879,000 --> 0:00:31,000
starts using drones to kill people.

7
0:00:32.653,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I thought that this was a really intense, futuristic idea,

8
0:00:37.484,000 --> 0:00:39,000
but by the time the story was published,

9
0:00:40.506,000 --> 0:00:43,000
the government was already using drones to kill people.

10
0:00:44.237,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Our world is changing so fast,

11
0:00:47.069,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and there's a kind of accelerating feedback loop

12
0:00:49.751,000 --> 0:00:53,000
where technological change and social change feed on each other.

13
0:00:54.241,000 --> 0:00:56,000
When I was a kid in the 1980s,

14
0:00:56.878,000 --> 0:00:59,000
we knew what the future was going to look like.

15
0:01:00.14,000 --> 0:01:05,000
It was going to be some version of "Judge Dredd" or "Blade Runner."

16
0:01:05.338,000 --> 0:01:1,000
It was going to be neon megacities and flying vehicles.

17
0:01:10.456,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But now, nobody knows what the world is going to look like

18
0:01:13.244,000 --> 0:01:15,000
even in just a couple years,

19
0:01:15.331,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and there are so many scary apparitions lurking on the horizon.

20
0:01:19.935,000 --> 0:01:22,000
From climate catastrophe to authoritarianism,

21
0:01:23.672,000 --> 0:01:26,000
everybody is obsessed with apocalypses,

22
0:01:27.058,000 --> 0:01:31,000
even though the world ends all the time, and we keep going.

23
0:01:31.559,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Don't be afraid to think about the future, to dream about the future,

24
0:01:35.765,000 --> 0:01:36,000
to write about the future.

25
0:01:37.644,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I've found it really liberating and fun to do that.

26
0:01:42.077,000 --> 0:01:44,000
It's a way of vaccinating yourself

27
0:01:44.323,000 --> 0:01:47,000
against the worst possible case of future shock.

28
0:01:48.013,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It's also a source of empowerment,

29
0:01:50.251,000 --> 0:01:54,000
because you cannot prepare for something that you haven't already visualized.

30
0:01:55.131,000 --> 0:01:57,000
But there's something that you need to know.

31
0:01:57.718,000 --> 0:02:,000
You don't predict the future;

32
0:02:00.866,000 --> 0:02:02,000
you imagine the future.

33
0:02:04.13,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So as a science fiction writer

34
0:02:05.921,000 --> 0:02:09,000
whose stories often take place years or even centuries from now,

35
0:02:10.7,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I've found that people are really hungry for visions of the future

36
0:02:14.655,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that are both colorful and lived in,

37
0:02:18.042,000 --> 0:02:21,000
but I found that research on its own is not enough to get me there.

38
0:02:21.94,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Instead, I use a mixture of active dreaming

39
0:02:25.569,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and awareness of cutting-edge trends in science and technology

40
0:02:29.915,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and also insight into human history.

41
0:02:33.139,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I think a lot about what I know of human nature

42
0:02:35.461,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and the way that people have responded in the past to huge changes

43
0:02:39.76,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and upheavals and transformations.

44
0:02:42.411,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And I pair that with an attention to detail,

45
0:02:46.012,000 --> 0:02:49,000
because the details are where we live.

46
0:02:49.651,000 --> 0:02:52,000
We tell the story of our world through the tools we create

47
0:02:53.539,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and the spaces that we live in.

48
0:02:55.609,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And at this point, it's helpful to know a couple of terms

49
0:02:59.207,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that science fiction writers use all of the time:

50
0:03:02.666,000 --> 0:03:06,000
"future history" and "second-order effects."

51
0:03:07.78,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Now, future history is basically just what it sounds like.

52
0:03:10.547,000 --> 0:03:13,000
It is a chronology of things that haven't happened yet,

53
0:03:13.922,000 --> 0:03:16,000
like Robert A. Heinlein's famous story cycle,

54
0:03:17.064,000 --> 0:03:2,000
which came with a detailed chart of upcoming events

55
0:03:20.447,000 --> 0:03:22,000
going up into the year 2100.

56
0:03:22.98,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Or, for my most recent novel,

57
0:03:25.141,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I came up with a really complicated time line

58
0:03:27.442,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that goes all the way to the 33rd century

59
0:03:30.885,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and ends with people living on another planet.

60
0:03:34.619,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Meanwhile, a second-order effect is basically the kind of thing

61
0:03:40.008,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that happens after the consequences of a new technology or a huge change.

62
0:03:45.644,000 --> 0:03:5,000
There's a saying often attributed to writer and editor Frederik Pohl

63
0:03:51.182,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that "A good science fiction story

64
0:03:53.306,000 --> 0:03:55,000
should predict not just the invention of the automobile,

65
0:03:56.248,000 --> 0:03:59,000
but also the traffic jam."

66
0:03:59.52,000 --> 0:04:,000
And speaking of traffic jams,

67
0:04:01.166,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I spent a lot of time trying to picture the city of the future.

68
0:04:06.836,000 --> 0:04:07,000
What's it like? What's it made of?

69
0:04:08.548,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Who's it for?

70
0:04:09.975,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I try to picture a green city with vertical farms

71
0:04:15.045,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and structures that are partially grown rather than built

72
0:04:19.671,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and walkways instead of streets,

73
0:04:22.294,000 --> 0:04:25,000
because nobody gets around by car anymore --

74
0:04:25.778,000 --> 0:04:28,000
a city that lives and breathes.

75
0:04:29.777,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And, you know, I kind of start by daydreaming the wildest stuff

76
0:04:34.228,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that I can possibly come up with,

77
0:04:36.238,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and then I go back into research mode,

78
0:04:38.923,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and I try to make it as plausible as I can

79
0:04:41.372,000 --> 0:04:45,000
by looking at a mixture of urban futurism, design porn

80
0:04:46.215,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and technological speculation.

81
0:04:48.542,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And then I go back, and I try to imagine what it would actually be like

82
0:04:53.429,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to be inside that city.

83
0:04:55.565,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So my process kind of begins and ends with imagination,

84
0:05:00.233,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and it's like my imagination is two pieces of bread

85
0:05:04.567,000 --> 0:05:05,000
in a research sandwich.

86
0:05:07.553,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So as a storyteller, first and foremost,

87
0:05:11.184,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I try to live in the world through the eyes of my characters

88
0:05:14.587,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and try to see how they navigate their own personal challenges

89
0:05:18.305,000 --> 0:05:2,000
in the context of the space that I've created.

90
0:05:20.647,000 --> 0:05:22,000
What do they smell? What do they touch?

91
0:05:23.661,000 --> 0:05:26,000
What's it like to fall in love inside a smart city?

92
0:05:27.609,000 --> 0:05:29,000
What do you see when you look out your window,

93
0:05:29.792,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and does it depend on how the window's software interacts with your mood?

94
0:05:33.307,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And finally, I ask myself how a future brilliant city

95
0:05:37.455,000 --> 0:05:42,000
would ensure that nobody is homeless and nobody slips through the cracks.

96
0:05:42.907,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And here's where future history comes in handy,

97
0:05:45.219,000 --> 0:05:48,000
because cities don't just spring up overnight like weeds.

98
0:05:48.679,000 --> 0:05:5,000
They arise and transform.

99
0:05:51.631,000 --> 0:05:57,000
They bear the scars and ornaments of wars, migrations,

100
0:05:57.734,000 --> 0:05:59,000
economic booms, cultural awakenings.

101
0:06:00.426,000 --> 0:06:02,000
A future city should have monuments, yeah,

102
0:06:02.929,000 --> 0:06:05,000
but it should also have layers of past architecture,

103
0:06:06.831,000 --> 0:06:07,000
repurposed buildings

104
0:06:08.279,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and all of the signs of how we got to this place.

105
0:06:12.425,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And then there's second-order effects,

106
0:06:14.776,000 --> 0:06:17,000
like how do things go wrong -- or right --

107
0:06:18.683,000 --> 0:06:2,000
in a way that nobody ever anticipated?

108
0:06:21.031,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Like, if the walls of your apartment are made out of a kind of fungus

109
0:06:25.366,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that can regrow itself to repair any damage,

110
0:06:29.806,000 --> 0:06:31,000
what if people start eating the walls?

111
0:06:32.721,000 --> 0:06:33,000
(Laughter)

112
0:06:33.901,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Speaking of eating:

113
0:06:35.104,000 --> 0:06:38,000
What kind of sewer system does the city of the future have?

114
0:06:38.815,000 --> 0:06:41,000
It's a trick question. There are no sewers.

115
0:06:42.058,000 --> 0:06:45,000
There's something incredibly bizarre about the current system we have

116
0:06:45.46,000 --> 0:06:46,000
in the United States,

117
0:06:46.672,000 --> 0:06:49,000
where your waste gets flushed into a tunnel

118
0:06:49.742,000 --> 0:06:53,000
to be mixed with rainwater and often dumped into the ocean.

119
0:06:54.213,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Not to mention toilet paper.

120
0:06:58.34,000 --> 0:07:,000
A bunch of techies, led by Bill Gates,

121
0:07:00.493,000 --> 0:07:02,000
are trying to reinvent the toilet right now,

122
0:07:02.888,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and it's possible that the toilet of the future

123
0:07:05.225,000 --> 0:07:08,000
could appear incredibly strange to someone living today.

124
0:07:08.699,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So how does the history of the future, all of that trial and error,

125
0:07:13.1,000 --> 0:07:15,000
lead to a better way to go to the bathroom?

126
0:07:15.748,000 --> 0:07:16,000
There are companies right now

127
0:07:17.238,000 --> 0:07:19,000
who are experimenting with a kind of cleaning wand

128
0:07:19.778,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that can substitute for toilet paper,

129
0:07:21.647,000 --> 0:07:24,000
using compressed air or sanitizing sprays to clean you off.

130
0:07:24.861,000 --> 0:07:28,000
But what if those things looked more like flowers than technology?

131
0:07:30.266,000 --> 0:07:33,000
What if your toilet could analyze your waste

132
0:07:33.689,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and let you know if your microbiome might need a little tune-up?

133
0:07:37.449,000 --> 0:07:4,000
What if today's experiments with turning human waste into fuel

134
0:07:40.824,000 --> 0:07:43,000
leads to a smart battery that could help power your home?

135
0:07:44.7,000 --> 0:07:45,000
But back to the city of the future.

136
0:07:46.536,000 --> 0:07:47,000
How do people navigate the space?

137
0:07:48.147,000 --> 0:07:51,000
If there's no streets, how do people even make sense of the geography?

138
0:07:51.957,000 --> 0:07:53,000
I like to think of a place where there are spaces

139
0:07:54.427,000 --> 0:07:56,000
that are partially only in virtual reality

140
0:07:56.899,000 --> 0:07:58,000
that maybe you need special hardware to even discover.

141
0:07:59.852,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Like for one story, I came up with a thing called "the cloudscape interface,"

142
0:08:04.408,000 --> 0:08:08,000
which I described as a chrome spider that plugs into your head

143
0:08:08.801,000 --> 0:08:09,000
using temporal nodes.

144
0:08:10.531,000 --> 0:08:13,000
No, that's not a picture of it, but it's a fun picture I took in a bar.

145
0:08:13.966,000 --> 0:08:14,000
(Laughter)

146
0:08:15.898,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And I got really carried away imagining the bars, restaurants, cafés

147
0:08:20.516,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that you could only find your way inside

148
0:08:22.699,000 --> 0:08:25,000
if you had the correct augmented reality hardware.

149
0:08:25.959,000 --> 0:08:27,000
But again, second-order effects:

150
0:08:28.562,000 --> 0:08:31,000
in a world shaped by augmented reality,

151
0:08:31.744,000 --> 0:08:33,000
what kind of new communities will we have,

152
0:08:33.809,000 --> 0:08:35,000
what kind of new crimes that we haven't even thought of yet?

153
0:08:36.741,000 --> 0:08:39,000
OK, like, let's say that you and I are standing next to each other,

154
0:08:40.293,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and you think that we're in a noisy sports bar,

155
0:08:44.1,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and I think we're in a highbrow salon

156
0:08:47.331,000 --> 0:08:5,000
with a string quartet talking about Baudrillard.

157
0:08:50.795,000 --> 0:08:53,000
I can't possibly imagine what might go wrong in that scenario.

158
0:08:54.299,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Like, it's just -- I'm sure it'll be fine.

159
0:08:57.822,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And then there's social media.

160
0:08:59.374,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I can imagine some pretty frickin' dystopian scenarios

161
0:09:03.543,000 --> 0:09:05,000
where things like internet quizzes,

162
0:09:06.078,000 --> 0:09:09,000
dating apps, horoscopes, bots,

163
0:09:09.213,000 --> 0:09:12,000
all combine to drag you down deeper and deeper rabbit holes

164
0:09:13.229,000 --> 0:09:17,000
into bad relationships and worse politics.

165
0:09:17.649,000 --> 0:09:19,000
But then I think about the conversations that I've had

166
0:09:20.25,000 --> 0:09:21,000
with people who work on AI,

167
0:09:22.165,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and what I always hear from them is that the smarter AI gets,

168
0:09:25.861,000 --> 0:09:27,000
the better it is at making connections.

169
0:09:28.168,000 --> 0:09:32,000
So maybe the social media of the future will be better.

170
0:09:32.541,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Maybe it'll help us to form healthier, less destructive relationships.

171
0:09:37.505,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Maybe we'll have devices that enable togetherness and serendipity.

172
0:09:42.048,000 --> 0:09:43,000
I really hope so.

173
0:09:43.832,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And, you know, I like to think that if strong AI ever really exists,

174
0:09:49.061,000 --> 0:09:52,000
they'll probably enjoy our weird relationship drama

175
0:09:52.976,000 --> 0:09:56,000
the same way that you and I love to obsess about the "Real Housewives of Wherever."

176
0:09:57.801,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And finally, there's medicine.

177
0:09:59.364,000 --> 0:10:02,000
I think a lot about how developments in genetic medicine

178
0:10:03.361,000 --> 0:10:07,000
could improve outcomes for people with cancer or dementia,

179
0:10:07.422,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and maybe one day, your hundredth birthday will be just another milestone

180
0:10:13.216,000 --> 0:10:16,000
on the way to another two or three decades of healthy, active life.

181
0:10:17.011,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Maybe the toilet of the future that I mentioned

182
0:10:19.493,000 --> 0:10:21,000
will improve health outcomes for a lot of people,

183
0:10:22.021,000 --> 0:10:23,000
including people in parts of the world

184
0:10:23.888,000 --> 0:10:26,000
where they don't have these complicated sewer systems that I mentioned.

185
0:10:27.335,000 --> 0:10:29,000
But also, as a transgender person,

186
0:10:29.615,000 --> 0:10:33,000
I like to think: What if we make advances in understanding the endocrine system

187
0:10:34.596,000 --> 0:10:36,000
that improve the options for trans people,

188
0:10:37.611,000 --> 0:10:4,000
the same way that hormones and surgeries expanded the options

189
0:10:41.527,000 --> 0:10:42,000
for the previous generation?

190
0:10:43.151,000 --> 0:10:45,000
So finally: basically, I'm here to tell you,

191
0:10:46.088,000 --> 0:10:47,000
people talk about the future

192
0:10:47.974,000 --> 0:10:5,000
as though it's either going to be a technological wonderland

193
0:10:51.824,000 --> 0:10:55,000
or some kind of apocalyptic poop barbecue.

194
0:10:55.909,000 --> 0:10:56,000
(Laughter)

195
0:10:57.022,000 --> 0:10:59,000
But the truth is, it's not going to be either of those things.

196
0:10:59.981,000 --> 0:11:02,000
It's going to be in the middle. It's going to be both. It's going to be everything.

197
0:11:03.94,000 --> 0:11:04,000
The one thing we do know

198
0:11:05.131,000 --> 0:11:07,000
is that the future is going to be incredibly weird.

199
0:11:07.58,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Just think about how weird the early 21st century would appear

200
0:11:10.861,000 --> 0:11:12,000
to someone from the early 20th.

201
0:11:13.14,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And, you know, there's a kind of logical fallacy that we all have

202
0:11:16.598,000 --> 0:11:19,000
where we expect the future to be an extension of the present.

203
0:11:20.097,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Like, people in the 1980s

204
0:11:21.436,000 --> 0:11:23,000
thought that the Soviet Union would still be around today.

205
0:11:24.935,000 --> 0:11:28,000
But the future is going to be much weirder than we could possibly dream of.

206
0:11:29.77,000 --> 0:11:3,000
But we can try.

207
0:11:30.991,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And I know that there are going to be scary, scary things,

208
0:11:34.841,000 --> 0:11:38,000
but there's also going to be wonders and saving graces.

209
0:11:38.971,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And the first step to finding your way forward

210
0:11:43.275,000 --> 0:11:45,000
is to let your imagination run free.

211
0:11:46.519,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Thank you.

212
0:11:47.703,000 --> 0:11:51,000
(Applause)

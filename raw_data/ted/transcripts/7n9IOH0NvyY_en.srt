1
0:00:12.88,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm here to recruit men to support gender equality.

2
0:00:16.48,000 --> 0:00:19,000
(Cheers)

3
0:00:19.64,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Wait, wait. What?

4
0:00:22.68,000 --> 0:00:24,000
What do men have to do with gender equality?

5
0:00:25.52,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Gender equality is about women, right?

6
0:00:27.52,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I mean, the word gender is about women.

7
0:00:32.2,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Actually, I'm even here speaking as a middle class white man.

8
0:00:36.52,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Now, I wasn't always a middle class white man.

9
0:00:39.44,000 --> 0:00:43,000
It all happened for me about 30 years ago when I was in graduate school,

10
0:00:44.64,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and a bunch of us graduate students got together one day,

11
0:00:48.08,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and we said, you know, there's an explosion

12
0:00:50.76,000 --> 0:00:53,000
of writing and thinking in feminist theory,

13
0:00:54.52,000 --> 0:00:55,000
but there's no courses yet.

14
0:00:56.44,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So we did what graduate students typically do in a situation like that.

15
0:00:59.798,000 --> 0:01:01,000
We said, OK, let's have a study group.

16
0:01:02.48,000 --> 0:01:04,000
We'll read a text, we'll talk about it,

17
0:01:05.08,000 --> 0:01:06,000
we'll have a potluck dinner.

18
0:01:06.68,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:08.2,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So every week, 11 women and me got together.

20
0:01:11.72,000 --> 0:01:13,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:14.52,000 --> 0:01:17,000
We would read some text in feminist theory and have a conversation about it.

22
0:01:18.48,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And during one of our conversations,

23
0:01:20.72,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I witnessed an interaction that changed my life forever.

24
0:01:25.64,000 --> 0:01:27,000
It was a conversation between two women.

25
0:01:28.64,000 --> 0:01:32,000
One of the women was white, and one was black.

26
0:01:32.92,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And the white woman said --

27
0:01:34.28,000 --> 0:01:36,000
this is going to sound very anachronistic now --

28
0:01:36.64,000 --> 0:01:41,000
the white woman said, "All women face the same oppression as women.

29
0:01:42.36,000 --> 0:01:44,000
All women are similarly situated in patriarchy,

30
0:01:45.2,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and therefore all women have a kind of intuitive solidarity or sisterhood."

31
0:01:50.84,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And the black woman said, "I'm not so sure.

32
0:01:54.4,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Let me ask you a question."

33
0:01:56.32,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So the black woman says to the white woman,

34
0:01:59.08,000 --> 0:02:01,000
"When you wake up in the morning and you look in the mirror,

35
0:02:01.96,000 --> 0:02:02,000
what do you see?"

36
0:02:03.2,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And the white woman said, "I see a woman."

37
0:02:05.84,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And the black woman said, "You see, that's the problem for me.

38
0:02:09.04,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Because when I wake up in the morning and I look in the mirror," she said,

39
0:02:12.56,000 --> 0:02:13,000
"I see a black woman.

40
0:02:13.96,000 --> 0:02:18,000
To me, race is visible. But to you, race is invisible. You don't see it."

41
0:02:19.76,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And then she said something really startling.

42
0:02:22.479,000 --> 0:02:23,000
She said, "That's how privilege works.

43
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Privilege is invisible to those who have it."

44
0:02:28.68,000 --> 0:02:31,000
It is a luxury, I will say to the white people sitting in this room,

45
0:02:31.96,000 --> 0:02:34,000
not to have to think about race every split second of our lives.

46
0:02:35.72,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Privilege is invisible to those who have it.

47
0:02:39.48,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Now remember, I was the only man in this group,

48
0:02:41.88,000 --> 0:02:43,000
so when I witnessed this, I went, "Oh no."

49
0:02:44.8,000 --> 0:02:45,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:46.56,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And somebody said, "Well what was that reaction?"

51
0:02:48.92,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And I said, "Well, when I wake up in the morning and I look in the mirror,

52
0:02:52.6,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I see a human being.

53
0:02:54.52,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I'm kind of the generic person.

54
0:02:57,000 --> 0:03:01,000
You know, I'm a middle class white man. I have no race, no class, no gender.

55
0:03:01.04,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I'm universally generalizable."

56
0:03:03.08,000 --> 0:03:04,000
(Laughter)

57
0:03:04.92,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So I like to think that was the moment I became a middle class white man,

58
0:03:08.68,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that class and race and gender were not about other people,

59
0:03:12.64,000 --> 0:03:13,000
they were about me.

60
0:03:14.2,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I had to start thinking about them,

61
0:03:16.4,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and it had been privilege that had kept it invisible to me for so long.

62
0:03:21.2,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Now, I wish I could tell you this story ends 30 years ago

63
0:03:23.891,000 --> 0:03:24,000
in that little discussion group,

64
0:03:25.48,000 --> 0:03:28,000
but I was reminded of it quite recently at my university where I teach.

65
0:03:29.28,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I have a colleague, and she and I both teach the sociology of gender course

66
0:03:33.24,000 --> 0:03:34,000
on alternate semesters.

67
0:03:35.12,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So she gives a guest lecture for me when I teach.

68
0:03:37.52,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I give a guest lecture for her when she teaches.

69
0:03:39.92,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So I walk into her class to give a guest lecture,

70
0:03:43.28,000 --> 0:03:45,000
about 300 students in the room,

71
0:03:45.48,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and as I walk in, one of the students looks up and says,

72
0:03:48.84,000 --> 0:03:5,000
"Oh, finally, an objective opinion."

73
0:03:52.84,000 --> 0:03:55,000
All that semester, whenever my colleague opened her mouth,

74
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:58,000
what my students saw was a woman.

75
0:03:58.4,000 --> 0:04:,000
I mean, if you were to say to my students,

76
0:04:00.52,000 --> 0:04:03,000
"There is structural inequality based on gender in the United States,"

77
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:06,000
they'd say, "Well of course you'd say that.

78
0:04:06.04,000 --> 0:04:07,000
You're a woman. You're biased."

79
0:04:07.541,000 --> 0:04:09,000
When I say it, they go, "Wow, is that interesting.

80
0:04:10.44,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Is that going to be on the test? How do you spell 'structural'?"

81
0:04:13.464,000 --> 0:04:14,000
(Laughter)

82
0:04:15.32,000 --> 0:04:17,000
So I hope you all can see,

83
0:04:17.6,000 --> 0:04:19,000
this is what objectivity looks like.

84
0:04:20.48,000 --> 0:04:23,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

85
0:04:24.24,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Disembodied Western rationality.

86
0:04:27.52,000 --> 0:04:29,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:30.279,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And that, by the way, is why I think men so often wear ties.

88
0:04:34.36,000 --> 0:04:35,000
(Laughter)

89
0:04:36.08,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Because if you are going to embody disembodied Western rationality,

90
0:04:40.68,000 --> 0:04:41,000
you need a signifier,

91
0:04:42.2,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and what could be a better signifier of disembodied Western rationality

92
0:04:46.44,000 --> 0:04:5,000
than a garment that at one end is a noose and the other end points to the genitals?

93
0:04:50.88,000 --> 0:04:54,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

94
0:04:57.64,000 --> 0:05:,000
That is mind-body dualism right there.

95
0:05:04.04,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So making gender visible to men

96
0:05:08.2,000 --> 0:05:12,000
is the first step to engaging men to support gender equality.

97
0:05:13.04,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Now, when men first hear about gender equality,

98
0:05:15.4,000 --> 0:05:16,000
when they first start thinking about it,

99
0:05:17.329,000 --> 0:05:19,000
they often think, many men think,

100
0:05:19.84,000 --> 0:05:23,000
well, that's right, that's fair, that's just,

101
0:05:24.12,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that's the ethical imperative.

102
0:05:27.12,000 --> 0:05:28,000
But not all men.

103
0:05:28.72,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Some men think -- the lightning bolt goes off,

104
0:05:31.44,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and they go, "Oh my God, yes, gender equality,"

105
0:05:34.28,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and they will immediately begin to mansplain to you your oppression.

106
0:05:39.96,000 --> 0:05:43,000
They see supporting gender equality something akin to the cavalry,

107
0:05:44.6,000 --> 0:05:47,000
like, "Thanks very much for bringing this to our attention, ladies,

108
0:05:47.767,000 --> 0:05:48,000
we'll take it from here."

109
0:05:49.32,000 --> 0:05:53,000
This results in a syndrome that I like to call 'premature self-congratulation.'

110
0:05:53.76,000 --> 0:05:57,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

111
0:05:58.08,000 --> 0:06:02,000
There's another group, though, that actively resists gender equality,

112
0:06:02.2,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that sees gender equality as something that is detrimental to men.

113
0:06:07.92,000 --> 0:06:1,000
I was on a TV talk show opposite four white men.

114
0:06:11.76,000 --> 0:06:14,000
This is the beginning of the book I wrote, 'Angry White Men.'

115
0:06:14.96,000 --> 0:06:15,000
These were four angry white men

116
0:06:16.68,000 --> 0:06:19,000
who believed that they, white men in America,

117
0:06:20.56,000 --> 0:06:24,000
were the victims of reverse discrimination in the workplace.

118
0:06:25.84,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And they all told stories about how they were qualified for jobs,

119
0:06:28.92,000 --> 0:06:29,000
qualified for promotions,

120
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
they didn't get them, they were really angry.

121
0:06:32.44,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And the reason I'm telling you this is I want you to hear the title

122
0:06:35.64,000 --> 0:06:36,000
of this particular show.

123
0:06:37.32,000 --> 0:06:39,000
It was a quote from one of the men,

124
0:06:39.48,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and the quote was,

125
0:06:40.92,000 --> 0:06:42,000
"A Black Woman Stole My Job."

126
0:06:44.36,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And they all told their stories,

127
0:06:45.96,000 --> 0:06:47,000
qualified for jobs, qualified for promotions,

128
0:06:48.12,000 --> 0:06:49,000
didn't get it, really angry.

129
0:06:49.48,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And then it was my turn to speak,

130
0:06:51.28,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and I said, "I have just one question for you guys,

131
0:06:53.88,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and it's about the title of the show,

132
0:06:56.52,000 --> 0:06:57,000
'A Black Woman Stole My Job.'

133
0:06:58.4,000 --> 0:07:,000
Actually, it's about one word in the title.

134
0:07:01.32,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I want to know about the word 'my.'

135
0:07:03.88,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Where did you get the idea it was your job?

136
0:07:07.28,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Why isn't the title of the show, 'A Black Woman Got the Job?'

137
0:07:10.6,000 --> 0:07:12,000
or 'A Black Woman Got A Job?'"

138
0:07:13.08,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Because without confronting men's sense of entitlement,

139
0:07:16.24,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I don't think we'll ever understand why so many men resist gender equality.

140
0:07:20.56,000 --> 0:07:26,000
(Applause)

141
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Look, we think this is a level playing field,

142
0:07:30.36,000 --> 0:07:32,000
so any policy that tilts it even a little bit,

143
0:07:32.56,000 --> 0:07:34,000
we think, "Oh my God, water's rushing uphill.

144
0:07:34.72,000 --> 0:07:35,000
It's reverse discrimination against us."

145
0:07:36.649,000 --> 0:07:37,000
(Laughter)

146
0:07:37.88,000 --> 0:07:38,000
So let me be very clear:

147
0:07:39.88,000 --> 0:07:42,000
white men in Europe and the United States

148
0:07:42.92,000 --> 0:07:46,000
are the beneficiaries of the single greatest affirmative action program

149
0:07:46.96,000 --> 0:07:47,000
in the history of the world.

150
0:07:48.52,000 --> 0:07:5,000
It is called "the history of the world."

151
0:07:50.6,000 --> 0:07:54,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

152
0:07:56.76,000 --> 0:08:,000
So, now I've established some of the obstacles to engaging men,

153
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:03,000
but why should we support gender equality?

154
0:08:03.64,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Of course, it's fair, it's right and it's just.

155
0:08:07.12,000 --> 0:08:08,000
But more than that,

156
0:08:08.6,000 --> 0:08:12,000
gender equality is also in our interest as men.

157
0:08:13.52,000 --> 0:08:17,000
If you listen to what men say about what they want in their lives,

158
0:08:18.4,000 --> 0:08:23,000
gender equality is actually a way for us to get the lives we want to live.

159
0:08:23.96,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Gender equality is good for countries.

160
0:08:27.52,000 --> 0:08:31,000
It turns out, according to most studies,

161
0:08:31.6,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that those countries that are the most gender equal

162
0:08:34.6,000 --> 0:08:38,000
are also the countries that score highest on the happiness scale.

163
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And that's not just because they're all in Europe.

164
0:08:41.56,000 --> 0:08:42,000
(Laughter)

165
0:08:42.8,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Even within Europe, those countries that are more gender equal

166
0:08:46.559,000 --> 0:08:48,000
also have the highest levels of happiness.

167
0:08:50.32,000 --> 0:08:51,000
It is also good for companies.

168
0:08:52.88,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Research by Catalyst and others has shown conclusively

169
0:08:56.48,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that the more gender-equal companies are,

170
0:09:00.12,000 --> 0:09:04,000
the better it is for workers,

171
0:09:04.36,000 --> 0:09:05,000
the happier their labor force is.

172
0:09:06.2,000 --> 0:09:09,000
They have lower job turnover. They have lower levels of attrition.

173
0:09:10.08,000 --> 0:09:12,000
They have an easier time recruiting.

174
0:09:12.44,000 --> 0:09:14,000
They have higher rates of retention, higher job satisfaction,

175
0:09:15.4,000 --> 0:09:17,000
higher rates of productivity.

176
0:09:17.64,000 --> 0:09:19,000
So the question I'm often asked in companies is,

177
0:09:20.52,000 --> 0:09:23,000
"Boy, this gender equality thing, that's really going to be expensive, huh?"

178
0:09:24.116,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And I say, "Oh no, in fact, what you have to start calculating

179
0:09:28.36,000 --> 0:09:31,000
is how much gender inequality is already costing you.

180
0:09:32.36,000 --> 0:09:33,000
It is extremely expensive."

181
0:09:34.88,000 --> 0:09:35,000
So it is good for business.

182
0:09:37.64,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And the other thing is, it's good for men.

183
0:09:41.04,000 --> 0:09:43,000
It is good for the kind of lives we want to live,

184
0:09:44.04,000 --> 0:09:47,000
because young men especially have changed enormously,

185
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and they want to have lives that are animated

186
0:09:51.2,000 --> 0:09:53,000
by terrific relationships with their children.

187
0:09:53.96,000 --> 0:09:56,000
They expect their partners, their spouses, their wives,

188
0:09:57.72,000 --> 0:09:58,000
to work outside the home

189
0:09:58.92,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and be just as committed to their careers as they are.

190
0:10:02.44,000 --> 0:10:05,000
I was talking, to give you an illustration of this change --

191
0:10:06.28,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Some of you may remember this.

192
0:10:08.08,000 --> 0:10:13,000
When I was a lot younger, there was a riddle that was posed to us.

193
0:10:13.2,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Some of you may wince to remember this riddle.

194
0:10:15.64,000 --> 0:10:17,000
This riddle went something like this.

195
0:10:18.24,000 --> 0:10:21,000
A man and his son are driving on the freeway,

196
0:10:21.6,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and they're in a terrible accident,

197
0:10:23.6,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and the father is killed,

198
0:10:25.88,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and the son is brought to the hospital emergency room,

199
0:10:28.96,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and as they're bringing the son into the hospital emergency room,

200
0:10:32.04,000 --> 0:10:35,000
the emergency room attending physician sees the boy and says,

201
0:10:35.68,000 --> 0:10:37,000
"Oh, I can't treat him, that's my son."

202
0:10:38.04,000 --> 0:10:39,000
How is this possible?

203
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
We were flummoxed by this.

204
0:10:42.48,000 --> 0:10:44,000
We could not figure this out.

205
0:10:44.68,000 --> 0:10:45,000
(Laughter)

206
0:10:46.64,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Well, I decided to do a little experiment with my 16-year old son.

207
0:10:49.8,000 --> 0:10:52,000
He had a bunch of his friends hanging out at the house

208
0:10:53.28,000 --> 0:10:55,000
watching a game on TV recently.

209
0:10:55.6,000 --> 0:10:57,000
So I decided I would pose this riddle to them,

210
0:10:57.84,000 --> 0:10:59,000
just to see, to gauge the level of change.

211
0:11:00.84,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Well, 16-year-old boys,

212
0:11:02.92,000 --> 0:11:06,000
they immediately turned to me and said, "It's his mom." Right?

213
0:11:06.96,000 --> 0:11:07,000
No problem. Just like that.

214
0:11:08.76,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Except for my son, who said, "Well, he could have two dads."

215
0:11:11.64,000 --> 0:11:16,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

216
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
That's an index, an indicator of how things have changed.

217
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Younger men today expect to be able to balance work and family.

218
0:11:26.84,000 --> 0:11:31,000
They want to be dual-career, dual-carer couples.

219
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
They want to be able to balance work and family with their partners.

220
0:11:35.88,000 --> 0:11:36,000
They want to be involved fathers.

221
0:11:37.8,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Now, it turns out

222
0:11:39.96,000 --> 0:11:42,000
that the more egalitarian our relationships,

223
0:11:43.36,000 --> 0:11:45,000
the happier both partners are.

224
0:11:46.96,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Data from psychologists and sociologists are quite persuasive here.

225
0:11:50.92,000 --> 0:11:55,000
I think we have the persuasive numbers, the data, to prove to men

226
0:11:56.6,000 --> 0:12:,000
that gender equality is not a zero-sum game, but a win-win.

227
0:12:00.8,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Here's what the data show.

228
0:12:02.6,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Now, when men begin the process of engaging

229
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
with balancing work and family,

230
0:12:09.96,000 --> 0:12:12,000
we often have two phrases that we use to describe what we do.

231
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
We pitch in and we help out.

232
0:12:15.72,000 --> 0:12:16,000
(Laughter)

233
0:12:16.96,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And I'm going to propose something a little bit more radical,

234
0:12:19.88,000 --> 0:12:2,000
one word: "share."

235
0:12:21.12,000 --> 0:12:22,000
(Laughter)

236
0:12:22.88,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Because here's what the data show:

237
0:12:24.56,000 --> 0:12:26,000
when men share housework and childcare,

238
0:12:26.88,000 --> 0:12:28,000
their children do better in school.

239
0:12:29.6,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Their children have lower rates of absenteeism,

240
0:12:32.24,000 --> 0:12:33,000
higher rates of achievement.

241
0:12:33.8,000 --> 0:12:35,000
They are less likely to be diagnosed with ADHD.

242
0:12:36.56,000 --> 0:12:38,000
They are less likely to see a child psychiatrist.

243
0:12:39.44,000 --> 0:12:41,000
They are less likely to be put on medication.

244
0:12:42.08,000 --> 0:12:44,000
So when men share housework and childcare,

245
0:12:45.92,000 --> 0:12:47,000
their children are happier and healthier,

246
0:12:48.72,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and men want this.

247
0:12:51.52,000 --> 0:12:53,000
When men share housework and childcare,

248
0:12:53.96,000 --> 0:12:55,000
their wives are happier. Duh.

249
0:12:57.72,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Not only that, their wives are healthier.

250
0:13:00.2,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Their wives are less likely to see a therapist,

251
0:13:02.415,000 --> 0:13:04,000
less likely to be diagnosed with depression,

252
0:13:04.487,000 --> 0:13:07,000
less likely to be put on medication, more likely to go to the gym,

253
0:13:08.28,000 --> 0:13:11,000
report higher levels of marital satisfaction.

254
0:13:11.36,000 --> 0:13:13,000
So when men share housework and childcare,

255
0:13:13.4,000 --> 0:13:14,000
their wives are happier and healthier,

256
0:13:15.28,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and men certainly want this as well.

257
0:13:18.76,000 --> 0:13:2,000
When men share housework and childcare,

258
0:13:20.96,000 --> 0:13:21,000
the men are healthier.

259
0:13:22.72,000 --> 0:13:25,000
They smoke less, drink less, take recreational drugs less often.

260
0:13:26.56,000 --> 0:13:28,000
They are less likely to go to the ER

261
0:13:29.28,000 --> 0:13:32,000
but more like to go to a doctor for routine screenings.

262
0:13:32.48,000 --> 0:13:33,000
They are less likely to see a therapist,

263
0:13:34.44,000 --> 0:13:36,000
less likely to be diagnosed with depression,

264
0:13:36.56,000 --> 0:13:38,000
less likely to be taking prescription medication.

265
0:13:39.08,000 --> 0:13:41,000
So when men share housework and childcare,

266
0:13:41.12,000 --> 0:13:44,000
the men are happier and healthier.

267
0:13:44.32,000 --> 0:13:45,000
And who wouldn't want that?

268
0:13:46.64,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And finally,

269
0:13:47.92,000 --> 0:13:48,000
when men share housework and childcare,

270
0:13:49.88,000 --> 0:13:5,000
they have more sex.

271
0:13:51.12,000 --> 0:13:52,000
(Laughter)

272
0:13:52.56,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Now, of these four fascinating findings,

273
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:57,000
which one do you think Men's Health magazine put on its cover?

274
0:13:57.96,000 --> 0:13:59,000
(Laughter)

275
0:14:00.6,000 --> 0:14:02,000
"Housework Makes Her Horny.

276
0:14:03.8,000 --> 0:14:04,000
(Not When She Does It.)"

277
0:14:05.04,000 --> 0:14:06,000
(Laughter)

278
0:14:06.72,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Now, I will say,

279
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:11,000
just to remind the men in the audience,

280
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:15,000
these data were collected over a really long period of time,

281
0:14:15.84,000 --> 0:14:17,000
so I don't want listeners to say,

282
0:14:18.68,000 --> 0:14:21,000
"Hmm, OK, I think I'll do the dishes tonight."

283
0:14:21.72,000 --> 0:14:24,000
These data were collected over a really long period of time.

284
0:14:25.72,000 --> 0:14:27,000
But I think it shows something important,

285
0:14:29.4,000 --> 0:14:31,000
that when Men's Health magazine put it on their cover,

286
0:14:31.96,000 --> 0:14:33,000
they also called, you'll love this, "Choreplay."

287
0:14:35.44,000 --> 0:14:39,000
So, what we found is something really important,

288
0:14:40.24,000 --> 0:14:42,000
that gender equality

289
0:14:42.36,000 --> 0:14:45,000
is in the interest of countries,

290
0:14:45.44,000 --> 0:14:48,000
of companies, and of men,

291
0:14:48.6,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and their children and their partners,

292
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
that gender equality is not a zero-sum game.

293
0:14:53.64,000 --> 0:14:54,000
It's not a win-lose.

294
0:14:54.92,000 --> 0:14:57,000
It is a win-win for everyone.

295
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
And what we also know

296
0:15:00.44,000 --> 0:15:03,000
is we cannot fully empower women and girls

297
0:15:04.04,000 --> 0:15:06,000
unless we engage boys and men.

298
0:15:06.72,000 --> 0:15:07,000
We know this.

299
0:15:09.32,000 --> 0:15:1,000
And my position is

300
0:15:10.8,000 --> 0:15:14,000
that men need the very things that women have identified

301
0:15:15.04,000 --> 0:15:18,000
that they need to live the lives they say they want to live

302
0:15:18.12,000 --> 0:15:21,000
in order to live the lives that we say we want to live.

303
0:15:22.6,000 --> 0:15:27,000
In 1915, on the eve of one of the great suffrage demonstrations

304
0:15:27.84,000 --> 0:15:28,000
down Fifth Avenue in New York City,

305
0:15:29.84,000 --> 0:15:32,000
a writer in New York wrote an article in a magazine,

306
0:15:33.52,000 --> 0:15:36,000
and the title of the article was,

307
0:15:36.56,000 --> 0:15:37,000
"Feminism for Men."

308
0:15:39.28,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And this was the first line of that article:

309
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
"Feminism will make it possible for the first time for men to be free."

310
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Thank you.

311
0:15:48.4,000 --> 0:15:55,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.872,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I love airplanes.

2
0:00:14.206,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Oh -- I love airplanes.

3
0:00:16.929,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So, when I went to college in the late 90s,

4
0:00:19.357,000 --> 0:00:21,000
it was obvious that I was going to study aerospace.

5
0:00:21.887,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And you wouldn't believe how many people told me,

6
0:00:24.276,000 --> 0:00:26,000
"Oh no, not aerospace.

7
0:00:26.387,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Aerospace is going to be boring,

8
0:00:27.951,000 --> 0:00:29,000
everything in aerospace has already been done."

9
0:00:31.59,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Well, they were a little bit off the mark.

10
0:00:33.685,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And in fact, I think the next decade

11
0:00:35.447,000 --> 0:00:37,000
is going to be another golden age for aviation.

12
0:00:37.669,000 --> 0:00:39,000
For one thing, and this is where I get excited,

13
0:00:39.892,000 --> 0:00:41,000
flight is about to get a lot more personal.

14
0:00:41.945,000 --> 0:00:43,000
So, a little compare and contrast.

15
0:00:44.744,000 --> 0:00:45,000
In the last century,

16
0:00:46.102,000 --> 0:00:49,000
large commercial airplanes have connected cities across the globe.

17
0:00:49.728,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And 100 years ago,

18
0:00:50.919,000 --> 0:00:52,000
it would have been unthinkable for all of us

19
0:00:53.022,000 --> 0:00:55,000
to fly here from around the world for a five-day conference.

20
0:00:55.906,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But we did, and most of us probably without a second thought.

21
0:00:59.128,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And that's a remarkable achievement for humanity.

22
0:01:02.636,000 --> 0:01:06,000
But on a day-to-day basis, we still spend a lot of time in cars.

23
0:01:06.86,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Or actively trying to avoid it.

24
0:01:10.17,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Some of my best friends live in San Francisco,

25
0:01:12.432,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I live in Mountain View, about 40 miles away.

26
0:01:15.408,000 --> 0:01:16,000
We're all busy.

27
0:01:16.779,000 --> 0:01:17,000
At the end of the day,

28
0:01:17.982,000 --> 0:01:19,000
we're separated by something like two hours of heavy traffic.

29
0:01:20.895,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So frankly, we haven't seen each other in a few months.

30
0:01:24.117,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Now, I work in downtown San Jose, which is near the airport.

31
0:01:28.204,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And there are actually days when I can leave work,

32
0:01:31.871,000 --> 0:01:33,000
get on a plane and fly to Los Angeles

33
0:01:34.227,000 --> 0:01:35,000
faster than I can drive to San Francisco.

34
0:01:36.799,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Cities are only getting more populated,

35
0:01:38.76,000 --> 0:01:4,000
the roads are full, and it's really difficult to expand them.

36
0:01:41.673,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And so in a lot of places,

37
0:01:43.053,000 --> 0:01:45,000
there really aren't a lot of good solutions

38
0:01:45.236,000 --> 0:01:46,000
for getting around traffic.

39
0:01:47.891,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But what if you could fly over it?

40
0:01:51.296,000 --> 0:01:52,000
The sky is underutilized,

41
0:01:52.828,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and I would argue it will never be as congested as the roads are.

42
0:01:56.439,000 --> 0:01:58,000
First of all, you've got a whole other dimension,

43
0:01:59.109,000 --> 0:02:03,000
but also just safety considerations and air-traffic management

44
0:02:03.18,000 --> 0:02:05,000
will not allow bumper-to-bumper traffic in the sky.

45
0:02:05.887,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Which means, in many cases,

46
0:02:07.824,000 --> 0:02:1,000
flying can be a long-term, compelling alternative

47
0:02:10.895,000 --> 0:02:11,000
to traveling on the ground.

48
0:02:13.474,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So imagine this:

49
0:02:14.651,000 --> 0:02:16,000
you call an Uber, it takes you to a nearby landing spot --

50
0:02:17.633,000 --> 0:02:19,000
we call these vertiports --

51
0:02:20.03,000 --> 0:02:22,000
there's an airplane waiting for you there,

52
0:02:22.068,000 --> 0:02:24,000
flies you over all of the traffic in the middle,

53
0:02:24.371,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and on the other side, another Uber takes you to your friend's house.

54
0:02:27.689,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And I said Uber,

55
0:02:28.864,000 --> 0:02:31,000
but I really think we need to congratulate the Lyft branding team

56
0:02:31.974,000 --> 0:02:33,000
for their forward thinking in choosing their brand.

57
0:02:34.466,000 --> 0:02:35,000
(Laughter)

58
0:02:36.442,000 --> 0:02:37,000
So in that example,

59
0:02:37.712,000 --> 0:02:38,000
OK, there are a few extra steps, I admit.

60
0:02:39.689,000 --> 0:02:42,000
But it's 30 minutes versus two hours,

61
0:02:43.038,000 --> 0:02:44,000
it costs around 60 dollars,

62
0:02:44.728,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and you get to fly.

63
0:02:46.974,000 --> 0:02:47,000
We're not there yet,

64
0:02:48.173,000 --> 0:02:5,000
but we are a lot closer than you might think.

65
0:02:50.514,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So one of the first things we need

66
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
is we need an aircraft that can take off and land in small spaces

67
0:02:55.489,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and quickly take you where you want to go.

68
0:02:57.554,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And helicopters can do that today,

69
0:02:59.846,000 --> 0:03:02,000
but traditionally, helicopters have been just a little bit too expensive,

70
0:03:03.694,000 --> 0:03:04,000
just a little too hard to pilot

71
0:03:05.385,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and just a little too noisy to be used for daily transportation in cities.

72
0:03:10.323,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Well, electric flight and autonomy are changing that.

73
0:03:14.228,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Electric flight, in particular,

74
0:03:15.76,000 --> 0:03:17,000
unlocks new possibilities for vehicle configurations

75
0:03:18.506,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that we just could not explore in the past.

76
0:03:21.712,000 --> 0:03:22,000
If you use electric motors,

77
0:03:23.061,000 --> 0:03:25,000
you can have many of them around the aircraft,

78
0:03:25.434,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and it doesn't add a lot of extra weight.

79
0:03:27.466,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And that gives you redundancy and safety.

80
0:03:29.514,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And also, they are cleaner, cheaper and quieter

81
0:03:31.753,000 --> 0:03:32,000
than internal combustion engines.

82
0:03:33.601,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Autonomy allows the transportation network to scale,

83
0:03:36.553,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and I actually think it makes the aircraft safer.

84
0:03:39.561,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Commercial flights are already automated for most of their duration,

85
0:03:42.815,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and I believe there will come a day

86
0:03:45.45,000 --> 0:03:48,000
when we won't even trust an airplane that required a human to fly.

87
0:03:50.323,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So, one of our teams at A3

88
0:03:52.609,000 --> 0:03:54,000
wanted to see just how close this future really was.

89
0:03:55.101,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So they built and flew a prototype of one such vehicle.

90
0:03:59.339,000 --> 0:04:,000
And they made a point of only using

91
0:04:01.046,000 --> 0:04:03,000
mature, commercially available technologies today.

92
0:04:04.228,000 --> 0:04:05,000
We call it Vahana.

93
0:04:05.958,000 --> 0:04:06,000
It's fully electric.

94
0:04:08.036,000 --> 0:04:11,000
It takes off and lands vertically, but flies forward like a regular airplane.

95
0:04:11.944,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It's fully self-piloted.

96
0:04:13.952,000 --> 0:04:16,000
You push a button, it takes off, flies and lands, all by itself.

97
0:04:17.809,000 --> 0:04:18,000
The prototype that you see here

98
0:04:19.323,000 --> 0:04:21,000
is designed to carry a single passenger and luggage.

99
0:04:21.8,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And it can go about 20 miles in 15 minutes.

100
0:04:23.842,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And our estimate for a trip like that is it would cost around 40 dollars,

101
0:04:28.214,000 --> 0:04:3,000
which you can really build a business around.

102
0:04:30.358,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It has multiple redundant motors and batteries,

103
0:04:32.826,000 --> 0:04:35,000
you can lose one, it will continue flying and land normally.

104
0:04:36.191,000 --> 0:04:37,000
It's pretty quiet.

105
0:04:37.695,000 --> 0:04:4,000
When it's flying overhead, it will be quieter than a Prius on the highway.

106
0:04:41.22,000 --> 0:04:43,000
It's intelligent and has cameras, lidar and radar,

107
0:04:43.942,000 --> 0:04:45,000
so it can detect and avoid unexpected obstacles.

108
0:04:47.148,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And the team really focused on making it efficient,

109
0:04:49.572,000 --> 0:04:52,000
so the batteries are small, light, and they last longer.

110
0:04:53.556,000 --> 0:04:55,000
For reference, the Vahana battery

111
0:04:56.018,000 --> 0:04:59,000
is less than half the size of a Tesla Model S battery.

112
0:04:59.522,000 --> 0:05:,000
It's about 40 kilowatt-hours.

113
0:05:01.481,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And you can hot swap the batteries in just a few minutes.

114
0:05:05.124,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And I do think that in a few years,

115
0:05:06.815,000 --> 0:05:08,000
people will be comfortable getting by themselves

116
0:05:09.085,000 --> 0:05:13,000
in a self-piloted, electric, VTOL air taxi.

117
0:05:13.545,000 --> 0:05:15,000
But the team is busy working on the next version,

118
0:05:15.895,000 --> 0:05:17,000
which is going to carry at least two passengers

119
0:05:18.149,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and fly quite a bit farther.

120
0:05:19.569,000 --> 0:05:23,000
But more importantly, there are over 20 companies around the world

121
0:05:24.165,000 --> 0:05:26,000
working on vehicles just like this one right now.

122
0:05:28.149,000 --> 0:05:3,000
My best guess is in the next five years,

123
0:05:30.331,000 --> 0:05:32,000
you'll start seeing vertiports in some cities,

124
0:05:32.807,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and little airplane icons on your ride-sharing apps.

125
0:05:36.006,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And it might begin with a dozen,

126
0:05:38.475,000 --> 0:05:4,000
but eventually, we could have hundreds of these,

127
0:05:40.768,000 --> 0:05:41,000
flying around our cities.

128
0:05:42.018,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And it will fundamentally transform our relationship with local travel.

129
0:05:47.658,000 --> 0:05:5,000
In the past century, flight connected our planet,

130
0:05:50.751,000 --> 0:05:52,000
in the next, it will reconnect our local communities,

131
0:05:53.712,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and I hope it will reconnect us to each other.

132
0:05:56.593,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Thank you.

133
0:05:57.784,000 --> 0:06:03,000
(Applause)

134
0:06:05.096,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Chris Anderson: OK, so when these things first roll out --

135
0:06:08.056,000 --> 0:06:11,000
right now, it's a single person aircraft, right?

136
0:06:12.293,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Rodin Lyasoff: Ours is, yes.

137
0:06:13.688,000 --> 0:06:14,000
CA: Yours is.

138
0:06:14.895,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I mean, someone comes out of their car,

139
0:06:17.165,000 --> 0:06:2,000
the door opens, they get in, there's no one else in there.

140
0:06:20.837,000 --> 0:06:21,000
This thing takes off.

141
0:06:22.496,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Could we do a poll here?

142
0:06:23.734,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Because these are early adopters in this room.

143
0:06:25.94,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I want to know who here is excited

144
0:06:28.203,000 --> 0:06:32,000
about the idea of being picked up solo in an auto-flying --

145
0:06:32.942,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Well, there you go!

146
0:06:34.125,000 --> 0:06:35,000
RL: It's pretty good.

147
0:06:35.348,000 --> 0:06:36,000
CA: That is pretty awesome,

148
0:06:36.712,000 --> 0:06:38,000
half of TED is completely stark staring bonkers.

149
0:06:39.03,000 --> 0:06:41,000
(Laughter)

150
0:06:42.307,000 --> 0:06:44,000
RL: So, one of the things we're really focusing on

151
0:06:44.965,000 --> 0:06:45,000
is, really, the cost.

152
0:06:46.22,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So you can really wrap a business around that.

153
0:06:48.825,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And so, that's why some of the features are really driven by price.

154
0:06:52.296,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And the 40-dollar price tag is really a target that we're aiming for.

155
0:06:55.709,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Which should make it accessible to a larger crowd than this one.

156
0:06:59.534,000 --> 0:07:02,000
CA: The biggest blockage in terms of when this rolls out

157
0:07:03.136,000 --> 0:07:06,000
is probably not the technology at this point -- it's regulation, right?

158
0:07:06.716,000 --> 0:07:08,000
RL: That's probably true, yes, I would agree with that.

159
0:07:09.343,000 --> 0:07:11,000
The technology need to mature in terms of safety,

160
0:07:12.144,000 --> 0:07:14,000
to get to the safety levels that we expect from aircraft.

161
0:07:16.245,000 --> 0:07:18,000
But I don't think there are any blockers there,

162
0:07:18.483,000 --> 0:07:19,000
just work needs to get done.

163
0:07:19.944,000 --> 0:07:2,000
CA: So, first, this is ride sharing.

164
0:07:21.706,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Are we that far away from a time

165
0:07:23.373,000 --> 0:07:25,000
when lots of people have one of these in their garage

166
0:07:26.039,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and just kind of, go direct to their friend's house?

167
0:07:29.381,000 --> 0:07:32,000
RL: My personal view is that ride sharing actually allows you to operate

168
0:07:33.021,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that entire business much more efficiently.

169
0:07:37.29,000 --> 0:07:4,000
You know, there are millennials that say they never want to own a car.

170
0:07:40.712,000 --> 0:07:42,000
I think they'll probably feel even stronger about aircraft.

171
0:07:43.546,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So --

172
0:07:44.734,000 --> 0:07:45,000
(Laughter)

173
0:07:46.434,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I really think that the network scales and operates a lot better

174
0:07:50.577,000 --> 0:07:51,000
as a ride-sharing platform,

175
0:07:52.213,000 --> 0:07:55,000
also because the integration with air-traffic management

176
0:07:55.673,000 --> 0:07:58,000
works a lot better if it's handled centrally.

177
0:07:58.706,000 --> 0:07:59,000
CA: Cool. Thank you for that.

178
0:08:00.19,000 --> 0:08:01,000
RL: Thank you. CA: That was amazing.

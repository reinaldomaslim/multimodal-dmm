1
0:00:13.387,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I am a palliative care physician

2
0:00:14.936,000 --> 0:00:16,000
and I would like to talk to you today about health care.

3
0:00:18.393,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I'd like to talk to you about the health and care

4
0:00:22.917,000 --> 0:00:24,000
of the most vulnerable population in our country --

5
0:00:25.788,000 --> 0:00:3,000
those people dealing with the most complex serious health issues.

6
0:00:32.202,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I'd like to talk to you about economics as well.

7
0:00:35.028,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And the intersection of these two should scare the hell out of you --

8
0:00:39.508,000 --> 0:00:4,000
it scares the hell out of me.

9
0:00:42.199,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I'd also like to talk to you about palliative medicine:

10
0:00:45.835,000 --> 0:00:51,000
a paradigm of care for this population, grounded in what they value.

11
0:00:52.544,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Patient-centric care based on their values

12
0:00:55.765,000 --> 0:00:58,000
that helps this population live better and longer.

13
0:01:00.458,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It's a care model that tells the truth

14
0:01:03.744,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and engages one-on-one

15
0:01:05.008,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and meets people where they're at.

16
0:01:09.46,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I'd like to start by telling the story of my very first patient.

17
0:01:13.247,000 --> 0:01:15,000
It was my first day as a physician,

18
0:01:15.307,000 --> 0:01:16,000
with the long white coat ...

19
0:01:17.519,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I stumbled into the hospital

20
0:01:19.025,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and right away there's a gentleman, Harold, 68 years old,

21
0:01:21.849,000 --> 0:01:22,000
came to the emergency department.

22
0:01:23.474,000 --> 0:01:24,000
He had had headaches for about six weeks

23
0:01:25.481,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that got worse and worse and worse and worse.

24
0:01:28.46,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Evaluation revealed he had cancer that had spread to his brain.

25
0:01:33.148,000 --> 0:01:38,000
The attending physician directed me to go share with Harold and his family

26
0:01:39.791,000 --> 0:01:42,000
the diagnosis, the prognosis and options of care.

27
0:01:44.114,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Five hours into my new career,

28
0:01:47.092,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I did the only thing I knew how.

29
0:01:49.922,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I walked in,

30
0:01:51.79,000 --> 0:01:52,000
sat down,

31
0:01:53.717,000 --> 0:01:54,000
took Harold's hand,

32
0:01:55.935,000 --> 0:01:56,000
took his wife's hand

33
0:01:58.142,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and just breathed.

34
0:02:00.5,000 --> 0:02:02,000
He said, "It's not good news is it, sonny?"

35
0:02:03.132,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I said, "No."

36
0:02:04.564,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And so we talked and we listened and we shared.

37
0:02:08.867,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And after a while I said,

38
0:02:10.124,000 --> 0:02:13,000
"Harold, what is it that has meaning to you?

39
0:02:13.373,000 --> 0:02:14,000
What is it that you hold sacred?"

40
0:02:15.026,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And he said,

41
0:02:16.365,000 --> 0:02:17,000
"My family."

42
0:02:18.525,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I said, "What do you want to do?"

43
0:02:20.57,000 --> 0:02:23,000
He slapped me on the knee and said, "I want to go fishing."

44
0:02:23.761,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I said, "That, I know how to do."

45
0:02:26.646,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Harold went fishing the next day.

46
0:02:29.76,000 --> 0:02:3,000
He died a week later.

47
0:02:32.455,000 --> 0:02:34,000
As I've gone through my training in my career,

48
0:02:35.098,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I think back to Harold.

49
0:02:36.609,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And I think that this is a conversation

50
0:02:40.782,000 --> 0:02:42,000
that happens far too infrequently.

51
0:02:43.737,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And it's a conversation that had led us to crisis,

52
0:02:48.173,000 --> 0:02:5,000
to the biggest threat to the American way of life today,

53
0:02:50.861,000 --> 0:02:52,000
which is health care expenditures.

54
0:02:53.926,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So what do we know?

55
0:02:55.127,000 --> 0:02:57,000
We know that this population, the most ill,

56
0:02:58.08,000 --> 0:03:,000
takes up 15 percent of the gross domestic product --

57
0:03:00.688,000 --> 0:03:02,000
nearly 2.3 trillion dollars.

58
0:03:04.307,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So the sickest 15 percent take up 15 percent of the GDP.

59
0:03:07.891,000 --> 0:03:1,000
If we extrapolate this out over the next two decades

60
0:03:11.755,000 --> 0:03:12,000
with the growth of baby boomers,

61
0:03:14.838,000 --> 0:03:17,000
at this rate it is 60 percent of the GDP.

62
0:03:20.177,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Sixty percent of the gross domestic product

63
0:03:22.48,000 --> 0:03:23,000
of the United States of America --

64
0:03:24.128,000 --> 0:03:26,000
it has very little to do with health care at that point.

65
0:03:27.148,000 --> 0:03:28,000
It has to do with a gallon of milk,

66
0:03:29.54,000 --> 0:03:3,000
with college tuition.

67
0:03:31.625,000 --> 0:03:33,000
It has to do with every thing that we value

68
0:03:34.112,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and every thing that we know presently.

69
0:03:38.514,000 --> 0:03:42,000
It has at stake the free-market economy and capitalism

70
0:03:42.729,000 --> 0:03:43,000
of the United States of America.

71
0:03:46.965,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Let's forget all the statistics for a minute, forget the numbers.

72
0:03:50.145,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Let's talk about the value we get for all these dollars we spend.

73
0:03:54.822,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Well, the Dartmouth Atlas, about six years ago,

74
0:03:57.439,000 --> 0:03:59,000
looked at every dollar spent by Medicare --

75
0:04:00.216,000 --> 0:04:01,000
generally this population.

76
0:04:01.851,000 --> 0:04:04,000
We found that those patients who have the highest per capita expenditures

77
0:04:08.05,000 --> 0:04:11,000
had the highest suffering, pain, depression.

78
0:04:12.182,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And, more often than not, they die sooner.

79
0:04:15.824,000 --> 0:04:16,000
How can this be?

80
0:04:17.789,000 --> 0:04:18,000
We live in the United States,

81
0:04:19.217,000 --> 0:04:21,000
it has the greatest health care system on the planet.

82
0:04:21.731,000 --> 0:04:23,000
We spend 10 times more on these patients

83
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
than the second-leading country in the world.

84
0:04:27.196,000 --> 0:04:28,000
That doesn't make sense.

85
0:04:29.764,000 --> 0:04:3,000
But what we know is,

86
0:04:31.147,000 --> 0:04:34,000
out of the top 50 countries on the planet

87
0:04:34.342,000 --> 0:04:37,000
with organized health care systems,

88
0:04:37.949,000 --> 0:04:39,000
we rank 37th.

89
0:04:42.017,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Former Eastern Bloc countries and sub-Saharan African countries

90
0:04:46.327,000 --> 0:04:49,000
rank higher than us as far as quality and value.

91
0:04:52.485,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Something I experience every day in my practice,

92
0:04:55.047,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and I'm sure, something many of you on your own journeys have experienced:

93
0:04:59.927,000 --> 0:05:01,000
more is not more.

94
0:05:04.196,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Those individuals who had more tests,

95
0:05:06.209,000 --> 0:05:07,000
more bells, more whistles,

96
0:05:07.503,000 --> 0:05:09,000
more chemotherapy, more surgery, more whatever --

97
0:05:09.955,000 --> 0:05:11,000
the more that we do to someone,

98
0:05:13.283,000 --> 0:05:15,000
it decreases the quality of their life.

99
0:05:17.422,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And it shortens it, most often.

100
0:05:21.896,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So what are we going to do about this?

101
0:05:23.745,000 --> 0:05:24,000
What are we doing about this?

102
0:05:25.461,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And why is this so?

103
0:05:27.097,000 --> 0:05:28,000
The grim reality, ladies and gentlemen,

104
0:05:29.025,000 --> 0:05:32,000
is that we, the health care industry -- long white-coat physicians --

105
0:05:32.447,000 --> 0:05:33,000
are stealing from you.

106
0:05:34.877,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Stealing from you the opportunity

107
0:05:37.974,000 --> 0:05:39,000
to choose how you want to live your lives

108
0:05:40.358,000 --> 0:05:42,000
in the context of whatever disease it is.

109
0:05:42.863,000 --> 0:05:44,000
We focus on disease and pathology and surgery

110
0:05:45.656,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and pharmacology.

111
0:05:49.319,000 --> 0:05:51,000
We miss the human being.

112
0:05:53.434,000 --> 0:05:54,000
How can we treat this

113
0:05:54.985,000 --> 0:05:55,000
without understanding this?

114
0:05:59.029,000 --> 0:06:,000
We do things to this;

115
0:06:02.948,000 --> 0:06:05,000
we need to do things for this.

116
0:06:08.161,000 --> 0:06:09,000
The triple aim of healthcare:

117
0:06:09.965,000 --> 0:06:12,000
one, improve patient experience.

118
0:06:13.081,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Two, improve the population health.

119
0:06:17.467,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Three, decrease per capita expenditure across a continuum.

120
0:06:23.591,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Our group, palliative care,

121
0:06:25.358,000 --> 0:06:29,000
in 2012, working with the sickest of the sick --

122
0:06:31,000 --> 0:06:32,000
cancer,

123
0:06:32.175,000 --> 0:06:33,000
heart disease, lung disease,

124
0:06:34.017,000 --> 0:06:35,000
renal disease,

125
0:06:35.192,000 --> 0:06:36,000
dementia --

126
0:06:37.681,000 --> 0:06:39,000
how did we improve patient experience?

127
0:06:41.01,000 --> 0:06:42,000
"I want to be at home, Doc."

128
0:06:42.633,000 --> 0:06:44,000
"OK, we'll bring the care to you."

129
0:06:44.868,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Quality of life, enhanced.

130
0:06:47.732,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Think about the human being.

131
0:06:49.114,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Two: population health.

132
0:06:51.069,000 --> 0:06:53,000
How did we look at this population differently,

133
0:06:53.944,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and engage with them at a different level, a deeper level,

134
0:06:56.816,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and connect to a broader sense of the human condition than my own?

135
0:07:01.091,000 --> 0:07:03,000
How do we manage this group,

136
0:07:04.584,000 --> 0:07:05,000
so that of our outpatient population,

137
0:07:06.377,000 --> 0:07:1,000
94 percent, in 2012, never had to go to the hospital?

138
0:07:11.919,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Not because they couldn't.

139
0:07:15.213,000 --> 0:07:16,000
But they didn't have to.

140
0:07:17.022,000 --> 0:07:18,000
We brought the care to them.

141
0:07:19.356,000 --> 0:07:23,000
We maintained their value, their quality.

142
0:07:25.22,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Number three: per capita expenditures.

143
0:07:28.746,000 --> 0:07:29,000
For this population,

144
0:07:30.168,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that today is 2.3 trillion dollars and in 20 years is 60 percent of the GDP,

145
0:07:35.245,000 --> 0:07:39,000
we reduced health care expenditures by nearly 70 percent.

146
0:07:40.873,000 --> 0:07:43,000
They got more of what they wanted based on their values,

147
0:07:44.346,000 --> 0:07:46,000
lived better and are living longer,

148
0:07:47.464,000 --> 0:07:48,000
for two-thirds less money.

149
0:07:54.88,000 --> 0:07:56,000
While Harold's time was limited,

150
0:07:57.663,000 --> 0:07:58,000
palliative care's is not.

151
0:08:00.288,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Palliative care is a paradigm from diagnosis through the end of life.

152
0:08:06.677,000 --> 0:08:07,000
The hours,

153
0:08:08.361,000 --> 0:08:1,000
weeks, months, years,

154
0:08:11.916,000 --> 0:08:12,000
across a continuum --

155
0:08:13.098,000 --> 0:08:14,000
with treatment, without treatment.

156
0:08:15.006,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Meet Christine.

157
0:08:17.196,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Stage III cervical cancer,

158
0:08:19.151,000 --> 0:08:22,000
so, metastatic cancer that started in her cervix,

159
0:08:22.196,000 --> 0:08:23,000
spread throughout her body.

160
0:08:24.719,000 --> 0:08:26,000
She's in her 50s and she is living.

161
0:08:28.743,000 --> 0:08:29,000
This is not about end of life,

162
0:08:30.36,000 --> 0:08:31,000
this is about life.

163
0:08:33.18,000 --> 0:08:34,000
This is not just about the elderly,

164
0:08:35.094,000 --> 0:08:36,000
this is about people.

165
0:08:37.929,000 --> 0:08:38,000
This is Richard.

166
0:08:39.706,000 --> 0:08:4,000
End-stage lung disease.

167
0:08:42.427,000 --> 0:08:44,000
"Richard, what is it that you hold sacred?"

168
0:08:45.581,000 --> 0:08:48,000
"My kids, my wife and my Harley."

169
0:08:49.094,000 --> 0:08:5,000
(Laughter)

170
0:08:50.129,000 --> 0:08:51,000
"Alright!

171
0:08:52.544,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I can't drive you around on it because I can barely pedal a bicycle,

172
0:08:55.806,000 --> 0:08:56,000
but let's see what we can do."

173
0:08:58.385,000 --> 0:09:,000
Richard came to me,

174
0:09:00.946,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and he was in rough shape.

175
0:09:04.444,000 --> 0:09:05,000
He had this little voice telling him

176
0:09:06.249,000 --> 0:09:08,000
that maybe his time was weeks to months.

177
0:09:09.488,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And then we just talked.

178
0:09:10.778,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And I listened and tried to hear --

179
0:09:14.891,000 --> 0:09:15,000
big difference.

180
0:09:16.202,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Use these in proportion to this.

181
0:09:20.479,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I said, "Alright, let's take it one day at a time,"

182
0:09:23.028,000 --> 0:09:25,000
like we do in every other chapter of our life.

183
0:09:26.573,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And we have met Richard where Richard's at day-to-day.

184
0:09:31.006,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And it's a phone call or two a week,

185
0:09:35.059,000 --> 0:09:39,000
but he's thriving in the context of end-stage lung disease.

186
0:09:43.04,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Now, palliative medicine is not just for the elderly,

187
0:09:45.557,000 --> 0:09:47,000
it is not just for the middle-aged.

188
0:09:49.535,000 --> 0:09:5,000
It is for everyone.

189
0:09:51.09,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Meet my friend Jonathan.

190
0:09:53.903,000 --> 0:09:54,000
We have the honor and pleasure

191
0:09:55.407,000 --> 0:09:57,000
of Jonathan and his father joining us here today.

192
0:09:57.751,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Jonathan is in his 20s, and I met him several years ago.

193
0:10:00.607,000 --> 0:10:03,000
He was dealing with metastatic testicular cancer,

194
0:10:04.7,000 --> 0:10:05,000
spread to his brain.

195
0:10:06.465,000 --> 0:10:07,000
He had a stroke,

196
0:10:08.375,000 --> 0:10:09,000
he had brain surgery,

197
0:10:09.947,000 --> 0:10:11,000
radiation, chemotherapy.

198
0:10:13.579,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Upon meeting him and his family,

199
0:10:15.399,000 --> 0:10:17,000
he was a couple of weeks away from a bone marrow transplant,

200
0:10:18.254,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and in listening and engaging,

201
0:10:20.539,000 --> 0:10:25,000
they said, "Help us understand -- what is cancer?"

202
0:10:27.764,000 --> 0:10:28,000
How did we get this far

203
0:10:30.513,000 --> 0:10:32,000
without understanding what we're dealing with?

204
0:10:33.276,000 --> 0:10:35,000
How did we get this far without empowering somebody

205
0:10:35.714,000 --> 0:10:36,000
to know what it is they're dealing with,

206
0:10:37.65,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and then taking the next step and engaging in who they are as human beings

207
0:10:41.282,000 --> 0:10:43,000
to know if that is what we should do?

208
0:10:43.402,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Lord knows we can do any kind of thing to you.

209
0:10:49.133,000 --> 0:10:5,000
But should we?

210
0:10:53.87,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And don't take my word for it.

211
0:10:55.578,000 --> 0:10:59,000
All the evidence that is related to palliative care these days

212
0:11:00.054,000 --> 0:11:04,000
demonstrates with absolute certainty people live better and live longer.

213
0:11:04.199,000 --> 0:11:07,000
There was a seminal article out of the New England Journal of Medicine

214
0:11:07.567,000 --> 0:11:08,000
in 2010.

215
0:11:09.621,000 --> 0:11:11,000
A study done at Harvard by friends of mine, colleagues.

216
0:11:12.309,000 --> 0:11:13,000
End-stage lung cancer:

217
0:11:13.714,000 --> 0:11:15,000
one group with palliative care,

218
0:11:16.695,000 --> 0:11:17,000
a similar group without.

219
0:11:19.782,000 --> 0:11:22,000
The group with palliative care reported less pain,

220
0:11:23.901,000 --> 0:11:24,000
less depression.

221
0:11:25.556,000 --> 0:11:27,000
They needed fewer hospitalizations.

222
0:11:28.487,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And, ladies and gentlemen,

223
0:11:30.639,000 --> 0:11:33,000
they lived three to six months longer.

224
0:11:35.805,000 --> 0:11:38,000
If palliative care were a cancer drug,

225
0:11:39.867,000 --> 0:11:42,000
every cancer doctor on the planet would write a prescription for it.

226
0:11:44.845,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Why don't they?

227
0:11:47.57,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Again, because we goofy, long white-coat physicians

228
0:11:50.938,000 --> 0:11:54,000
are trained and of the mantra of dealing with this,

229
0:11:56.401,000 --> 0:11:57,000
not with this.

230
0:12:02.697,000 --> 0:12:05,000
This is a space that we will all come to at some point.

231
0:12:07.709,000 --> 0:12:09,000
But this conversation today is not about dying,

232
0:12:10.457,000 --> 0:12:11,000
it is about living.

233
0:12:12.289,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Living based on our values,

234
0:12:13.637,000 --> 0:12:14,000
what we find sacred

235
0:12:15.08,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and how we want to write the chapters of our lives,

236
0:12:17.521,000 --> 0:12:18,000
whether it's the last

237
0:12:19.379,000 --> 0:12:2,000
or the last five.

238
0:12:22.258,000 --> 0:12:23,000
What we know,

239
0:12:24.277,000 --> 0:12:25,000
what we have proven,

240
0:12:26.475,000 --> 0:12:28,000
is that this conversation needs to happen today --

241
0:12:29.946,000 --> 0:12:31,000
not next week, not next year.

242
0:12:32.029,000 --> 0:12:34,000
What is at stake is our lives today

243
0:12:34.883,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and the lives of us as we get older

244
0:12:36.707,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and the lives of our children and our grandchildren.

245
0:12:40.31,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Not just in that hospital room

246
0:12:42.207,000 --> 0:12:43,000
or on the couch at home,

247
0:12:44.141,000 --> 0:12:46,000
but everywhere we go and everything we see.

248
0:12:48.326,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Palliative medicine is the answer to engage with human beings,

249
0:12:53.57,000 --> 0:12:56,000
to change the journey that we will all face,

250
0:12:58.304,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and change it for the better.

251
0:13:02.148,000 --> 0:13:03,000
To my colleagues,

252
0:13:04.823,000 --> 0:13:05,000
to my patients,

253
0:13:06.702,000 --> 0:13:07,000
to my government,

254
0:13:08.303,000 --> 0:13:1,000
to all human beings,

255
0:13:10.386,000 --> 0:13:13,000
I ask that we stand and we shout and we demand

256
0:13:14.641,000 --> 0:13:15,000
the best care possible,

257
0:13:17.352,000 --> 0:13:19,000
so that we can live better today

258
0:13:19.606,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and ensure a better life tomorrow.

259
0:13:21.311,000 --> 0:13:22,000
We need to shift today

260
0:13:24.452,000 --> 0:13:26,000
so that we can live tomorrow.

261
0:13:28.838,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Thank you very much.

262
0:13:30.013,000 --> 0:13:31,000
(Applause)

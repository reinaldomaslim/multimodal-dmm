1
0:00:13.071,000 --> 0:00:14,000
How y'all doing?

2
0:00:14.881,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Good.

3
0:00:16.135,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I came here to give you a science lesson

4
0:00:18.944,000 --> 0:00:2,000
about animal mating systems

5
0:00:21.03,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and why defining monogamy has been a challenge for scientists.

6
0:00:25.934,000 --> 0:00:28,000
But you won't need a textbook or to download an online lecture.

7
0:00:29.839,000 --> 0:00:33,000
All you'll simply need to do is revisit the song "OPP"

8
0:00:34.307,000 --> 0:00:35,000
by Naughty by Nature.

9
0:00:35.736,000 --> 0:00:36,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:36.95,000 --> 0:00:38,000
It was released in 1991.

11
0:00:40.808,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Now, "OPP" is a call-and-response song.

12
0:00:43.815,000 --> 0:00:46,000
So throughout the talk, I'm going to put lyrics up on the screen,

13
0:00:47.673,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and I'm going to recite some

14
0:00:49.087,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and I'm going to prompt you

15
0:00:50.474,000 --> 0:00:52,000
when it's your turn to do the response, OK?

16
0:00:52.668,000 --> 0:00:53,000
(Cheers)

17
0:00:53.945,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Now, I know some people in this audience know this song,

18
0:00:56.604,000 --> 0:00:58,000
so I need you to lead the way with the tempo and the rhythm,

19
0:00:59.453,000 --> 0:01:,000
if that's alright, OK?

20
0:01:00.881,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Right, y'all ready?

21
0:01:02.974,000 --> 0:01:03,000
You down with OPP?

22
0:01:04.345,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Audience: Yeah, you know me!

23
0:01:05.736,000 --> 0:01:06,000
DNL: You down with OPP?

24
0:01:07.143,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Audience: Yeah, you know me!

25
0:01:08.522,000 --> 0:01:09,000
DNL: You down with OPP?

26
0:01:09.791,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Audience: Yeah, you know me!

27
0:01:11.157,000 --> 0:01:12,000
DNL: That was perfect.

28
0:01:12.379,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Thank you.

29
0:01:14.768,000 --> 0:01:15,000
"OPP, how can I explain it?

30
0:01:16.474,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I'll take it frame by frame it.

31
0:01:18.006,000 --> 0:01:2,000
To have y'all jumping shout and singing it

32
0:01:20.069,000 --> 0:01:22,000
O is for other, P is for people. scratch your temple.

33
0:01:22.847,000 --> 0:01:24,000
The last P, well, that's not that simple."

34
0:01:25.379,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Now, in the song, the MC hints that it's a five-letter word,

35
0:01:29.093,000 --> 0:01:3,000
but to keep it rated PG,

36
0:01:30.728,000 --> 0:01:32,000
he simply refers to it as "property."

37
0:01:33.983,000 --> 0:01:34,000
(Laughter)

38
0:01:35.157,000 --> 0:01:38,000
The song is about cheating on your significant other.

39
0:01:38.879,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Now, around the time that this song was in heavy rotation,

40
0:01:42.657,000 --> 0:01:47,000
biologists were in deep discussion about whether bird species,

41
0:01:47.998,000 --> 0:01:52,000
notably songbirds and waterfowl were actually monogamous or not.

42
0:01:53.831,000 --> 0:01:56,000
See, for decades, generations of science students

43
0:01:57.141,000 --> 0:02:,000
were taught that well over 90 percent of the bird species were monogamous.

44
0:02:01.657,000 --> 0:02:04,000
A male and female mating faithfully for life.

45
0:02:05.419,000 --> 0:02:07,000
That was until the late 1980s,

46
0:02:07.696,000 --> 0:02:09,000
when a new laboratory technique came on the scene,

47
0:02:10.514,000 --> 0:02:14,000
which could copy DNA from a small tissue or fluid sample

48
0:02:14.546,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and decode the genetics of individuals.

49
0:02:17.046,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Now, before that technique,

50
0:02:19.133,000 --> 0:02:21,000
we were never ever certain about,

51
0:02:21.402,000 --> 0:02:23,000
100 percent, who the parents of baby birds were.

52
0:02:24.744,000 --> 0:02:25,000
All we had were our field notes.

53
0:02:26.792,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And we would know which adults lived in a nest

54
0:02:29.188,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and which ones fed the baby birds.

55
0:02:32.085,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Well, come to find out, study after study kept coming in

56
0:02:37.728,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and we found so much evidence of infidelity --

57
0:02:41.31,000 --> 0:02:42,000
(Laughter)

58
0:02:42.682,000 --> 0:02:43,000
among bird species,

59
0:02:44.072,000 --> 0:02:45,000
particularly these songbirds

60
0:02:45.487,000 --> 0:02:47,000
that we thought were the pinnacle of monogamy.

61
0:02:48.445,000 --> 0:02:51,000
It would have made Maury Povich jealous for the ratings.

62
0:02:51.807,000 --> 0:02:53,000
(Laughter)

63
0:02:54.538,000 --> 0:02:57,000
It rocked biology and ornithology so hard,

64
0:02:57.855,000 --> 0:03:01,000
we had to modify and expand the entire definition of monogamy.

65
0:03:02.974,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Now, it was so bad that this was the headline

66
0:03:06.681,000 --> 0:03:08,000
of the "New York Times" science section,

67
0:03:09.196,000 --> 0:03:1,000
August, 1990.

68
0:03:11.427,000 --> 0:03:13,000
"Mating for Life? It's not for the Birds or the Bees."

69
0:03:14.405,000 --> 0:03:15,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:16.261,000 --> 0:03:18,000
We had to come up with new definitions.

71
0:03:19.538,000 --> 0:03:22,000
The situation where an individual would change partners,

72
0:03:23.228,000 --> 0:03:24,000
either between breeding seasons

73
0:03:25.081,000 --> 0:03:28,000
or just simply because they didn't like their partner anymore?

74
0:03:28.418,000 --> 0:03:3,000
We now call this "serial monogamy."

75
0:03:30.941,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Laughter)

76
0:03:35.815,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I didn't know it was going to be this funny.

77
0:03:37.918,000 --> 0:03:38,000
(Laughter)

78
0:03:40.283,000 --> 0:03:44,000
The situation where we know the male and female pair together

79
0:03:44.807,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and all the babies belong to both partners?

80
0:03:47.379,000 --> 0:03:48,000
We call that "genetic monogamy."

81
0:03:49.37,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And we now recognize that it only holds true

82
0:03:51.839,000 --> 0:03:55,000
for about 14 percent of the songbird species,

83
0:03:55.99,000 --> 0:03:58,000
which we were very certain were truly monogamous.

84
0:03:59.831,000 --> 0:04:,000
And with this reclassification,

85
0:04:01.593,000 --> 0:04:03,000
we realized that in a lot of those field observations

86
0:04:04.367,000 --> 0:04:07,000
where we saw a male and female sharing a nest,

87
0:04:07.505,000 --> 0:04:11,000
comaintaining a territory, even provisioning offspring together,

88
0:04:12.045,000 --> 0:04:16,000
often included a few baby birds that did not belong to the male partner.

89
0:04:17.925,000 --> 0:04:19,000
We call this "social monogamy."

90
0:04:20.312,000 --> 0:04:22,000
(Laughter)

91
0:04:22.756,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And the mechanism responsible?

92
0:04:25.09,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Extra-pair copulation.

93
0:04:29.66,000 --> 0:04:31,000
"It's OPP, time for other people's what you get it

94
0:04:32.394,000 --> 0:04:34,000
there's no room for relationship, there's just room to ..."

95
0:04:35.23,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Audience: "Hit it!"

96
0:04:36.405,000 --> 0:04:38,000
"How many brothers out there know just what I'm getting at?

97
0:04:39.258,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Who thinks it's wrong because I was splitting and cohitting that.

98
0:04:42.754,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Well if you do, that's OPP"

99
0:04:46.238,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Actually, that's EPC

100
0:04:48.77,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Which is the abbreviation for extra-pair copulation.

101
0:04:52.596,000 --> 0:04:54,000
(Laughter)

102
0:04:54.912,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Now, we define extra-pair copulation as the mating outside of a pair bond.

103
0:05:00.119,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And just like we were discovering via science,

104
0:05:02.458,000 --> 0:05:05,000
it can lead to babies that don't belong to the male partner.

105
0:05:06.109,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Alright?

106
0:05:07.288,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Now, I first learned about EPCs years later,

107
0:05:10.966,000 --> 0:05:13,000
after all the science news broke while I was in graduate school.

108
0:05:14.403,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And as we were taking a class,

109
0:05:16.727,000 --> 0:05:18,000
talking about current discoveries and mating systems,

110
0:05:19.625,000 --> 0:05:2,000
this topic comes up.

111
0:05:21.855,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And as my professor's going through the definition

112
0:05:24.483,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and recounting all the dramatic turns of events

113
0:05:27.316,000 --> 0:05:29,000
that lead to these new revelations,

114
0:05:29.506,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I'm sitting in class and a familiar song starts bopping in my head.

115
0:05:33.133,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I'm like, "You down with OPP?

116
0:05:34.792,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Yeah, you know me!"

117
0:05:36.347,000 --> 0:05:37,000
(Laughter)

118
0:05:37.99,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I mean, that's exactly what that song was about:

119
0:05:41.823,000 --> 0:05:42,000
EPCs.

120
0:05:43.355,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And what I recognized

121
0:05:45.206,000 --> 0:05:48,000
is that this gives us an opportunity to revisit this song.

122
0:05:48.871,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Let's switch the lyrics up.

123
0:05:51.815,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So say EPC.

124
0:05:53.593,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Audience: EPC.

125
0:05:54.775,000 --> 0:05:55,000
DNL: Say it, EPC!

126
0:05:56.313,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Audience: EPC!

127
0:05:57.488,000 --> 0:05:58,000
"I like to say it with pride

128
0:05:58.879,000 --> 0:06:,000
now, when you do it, do it well, and make sure that it counts.

129
0:06:01.879,000 --> 0:06:02,000
You're not down with a discount."

130
0:06:03.522,000 --> 0:06:04,000
You down with EPC?

131
0:06:04.744,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Audience: Yeah, you know me!

132
0:06:08.05,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Now, I had always been playing songs in my head

133
0:06:11.558,000 --> 0:06:12,000
while I was in science class,

134
0:06:13.558,000 --> 0:06:16,000
kind of tapping into this index of pop culture and hip-hop songs.

135
0:06:17.585,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But when I would share my analogies with my science professors,

136
0:06:20.895,000 --> 0:06:21,000
all of whom were older white men,

137
0:06:22.847,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I often got blank and confused stares as responses.

138
0:06:27.609,000 --> 0:06:29,000
(Laughter)

139
0:06:29.816,000 --> 0:06:32,000
But when I would share this with people from communities like mine,

140
0:06:33.736,000 --> 0:06:36,000
or other colleagues -- so, diverse communities --

141
0:06:36.974,000 --> 0:06:38,000
this hip-hop science remix was a hit.

142
0:06:39.871,000 --> 0:06:42,000
That's because I was either talking to people who looked and sounded like me,

143
0:06:43.561,000 --> 0:06:46,000
or at the very least, you know, listened to some of the same songs.

144
0:06:46.991,000 --> 0:06:48,000
We were sharing a common cultural lexicon.

145
0:06:50.346,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And with that lexicon, I was able to bring new science terms to them,

146
0:06:54.792,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and together, we were sharing a new comprehension of science for the culture.

147
0:07:01.649,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Now, hip-hop song references

148
0:07:05.769,000 --> 0:07:11,000
are a really good tool for teaching content to students from hip-hop culture

149
0:07:11.904,000 --> 0:07:12,000
or urban communities.

150
0:07:13.357,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And I use it intentionally to connect to those students,

151
0:07:16.561,000 --> 0:07:19,000
tapping into vocabulary that they already know

152
0:07:19.847,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and systems that they already comprehend.

153
0:07:23.228,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And what it does in that process is it ratifies them, us, our culture

154
0:07:29.772,000 --> 0:07:3,000
as knowledge purveyors.

155
0:07:32.691,000 --> 0:07:35,000
I use hip-hop to frame and communicate science

156
0:07:36.101,000 --> 0:07:4,000
because I'm intentionally communicating science to broader audiences

157
0:07:40.625,000 --> 0:07:44,000
that public science outreach has traditionally overlooked.

158
0:07:46.427,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And in the process,

159

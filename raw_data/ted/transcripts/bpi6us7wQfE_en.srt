1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Some of you have heard the story before,

2
0:00:18.12,000 --> 0:00:2,000
but, in fact, there's somebody in the audience

3
0:00:20.32,000 --> 0:00:22,000
who's never heard this story in front of an audience before,

4
0:00:23.2,000 --> 0:00:26,000
so I'm a little more nervous than I normally am telling this story.

5
0:00:26.96,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I used to be a photographer for many years.

6
0:00:29.08,000 --> 0:00:31,000
In 1978, I was working for "TIME Magazine"

7
0:00:31.96,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and I was given a three-day assignment to photograph Amerasian children,

8
0:00:36.12,000 --> 0:00:39,000
children who had been fathered by American GIs all over Southeast Asia,

9
0:00:39.48,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and then abandoned -- 40,000 children all over Asia.

10
0:00:42.84,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I had never heard the word Amerasian before.

11
0:00:45.68,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I spent a few days photographing children in different countries,

12
0:00:49.24,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and like a lot of photographers and a lot of journalists,

13
0:00:52.52,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I always hoped that when my pictures are published,

14
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:57,000
they might actually have an effect on a situation,

15
0:00:57.4,000 --> 0:00:58,000
instead of just documenting it.

16
0:00:58.96,000 --> 0:01:02,000
So, I was so disturbed by what I saw

17
0:01:03.24,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and I was so unhappy with the article that ran afterwards,

18
0:01:07.36,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that I decided I would take six months off.

19
0:01:09.84,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I was 28 years old.

20
0:01:11.28,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I decided I would find six children in different countries,

21
0:01:15.04,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and actually go spend some time with the kids,

22
0:01:17.24,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and try to tell their story a little bit better

23
0:01:19.48,000 --> 0:01:21,000
than I thought I had done for Time magazine.

24
0:01:22.48,000 --> 0:01:23,000
In the course of doing the story,

25
0:01:24.12,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I was looking for children who hadn't been photographed before,

26
0:01:29.8,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and the Pearl Buck Foundation told me that they worked with a lot of Americans

27
0:01:34.76,000 --> 0:01:36,000
who were donating money to help some of these kids.

28
0:01:37.2,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And a man told me,

29
0:01:38.48,000 --> 0:01:4,000
who ran the Pearl Buck Foundation in Korea,

30
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that there was a young girl, who was 11 years old,

31
0:01:43.56,000 --> 0:01:44,000
being raised by her grandmother.

32
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And the grandmother had never let any Westerners see her.

33
0:01:47.88,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Every time any Westerners came to the village, she hid the girl.

34
0:01:50.96,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Of course, I was immediately intrigued.

35
0:01:52.88,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I saw photographs of her and I thought I wanted to go.

36
0:01:55.48,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And the guy just told me,

37
0:01:56.76,000 --> 0:01:58,000
"This grandmother -- there's no way she's ever going to let you

38
0:01:59.76,000 --> 0:02:,000
meet this girl that's she's raising."

39
0:02:01.6,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I took a translator with me and went to this village,

40
0:02:04.12,000 --> 0:02:05,000
found the grandmother, sat down with her.

41
0:02:06.12,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And to my astonishment, she agreed to let me photograph her granddaughter.

42
0:02:09.64,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And I was paying for this myself, so I asked the translator

43
0:02:12.48,000 --> 0:02:14,000
if it would be OK if I stayed for the week.

44
0:02:14.52,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I had a sleeping bag.

45
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
The family had a small shed on the side of the house,

46
0:02:18.88,000 --> 0:02:21,000
so I said, "Could I sleep in my sleeping bag in the evenings?"

47
0:02:22.08,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And I just told the little girl, whose name was Eun-Sook Lee,

48
0:02:27.04,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that if I ever did anything to embarrass her --

49
0:02:29.28,000 --> 0:02:32,000
she didn't speak a word of English, although she looked very American --

50
0:02:32.72,000 --> 0:02:35,000
she could put up her hand and say, "Stop," and I would stop taking pictures.

51
0:02:36.32,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Then my translator left. I couldn't speak a word of Korean.

52
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
This is the first night I met Eun-Sook.

53
0:02:41.12,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Her mother was still alive.

54
0:02:42.48,000 --> 0:02:44,000
She was not raising her, her grandmother was raising her.

55
0:02:45.2,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And what struck me immediately

56
0:02:47.52,000 --> 0:02:5,000
was how in love the two of these people were.

57
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:55,000
The grandmother was incredibly fond, deeply in love with this little girl.

58
0:02:55.24,000 --> 0:02:56,000
They slept on the floor at night.

59
0:02:56.88,000 --> 0:02:59,000
The way they heat their homes in Korea is to put bricks under the floors,

60
0:03:00.36,000 --> 0:03:02,000
so the heat radiates from underneath the floor.

61
0:03:02.6,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Eun-Sook was 11 years old.

62
0:03:03.96,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I had photographed, as I said, a lot of these kids.

63
0:03:06.4,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Eun-Sook was the fifth child that I found to photograph.

64
0:03:09.4,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And almost universally, amongst all the kids,

65
0:03:11.96,000 --> 0:03:13,000
they were really psychologically damaged

66
0:03:14.68,000 --> 0:03:17,000
by having been made fun of, ridiculed, picked on and been rejected.

67
0:03:18.52,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And Korea was probably the place I found to be the worst for these kids.

68
0:03:22.32,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And what struck me immediately in meeting Eun-Sook

69
0:03:25.52,000 --> 0:03:26,000
was how confident she appeared to be,

70
0:03:27.36,000 --> 0:03:29,000
how happy she seemed to be in her own skin.

71
0:03:29.6,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And remember this picture,

72
0:03:30.88,000 --> 0:03:32,000
because I'm going to show you another picture later.

73
0:03:33.36,000 --> 0:03:36,000
She looks much like her grandmother, although she looks so Western.

74
0:03:36.56,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I decided to follow her to school.

75
0:03:38.24,000 --> 0:03:4,000
This is the first morning I stayed with her.

76
0:03:40.36,000 --> 0:03:41,000
This is on the way to school.

77
0:03:41.8,000 --> 0:03:43,000
This is the morning assembly outside her school.

78
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And I noticed that she was clowning around.

79
0:03:51.52,000 --> 0:03:52,000
When the teachers would ask questions,

80
0:03:53.4,000 --> 0:03:55,000
she'd be the first person to raise her hand.

81
0:03:55.84,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Again, not at all shy or withdrawn,

82
0:03:57.8,000 --> 0:03:59,000
or anything like the other children that I'd photographed.

83
0:04:00.56,000 --> 0:04:02,000
The first one to go to the blackboard to answer questions.

84
0:04:03.32,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Getting in trouble for whispering into her best friend's ears.

85
0:04:06.28,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And one of the other things I said to her through the translator --

86
0:04:09.48,000 --> 0:04:13,000
again, this thing about saying stop -- was to not pay attention to me.

87
0:04:14.08,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So she really just completely ignored me most of the time.

88
0:04:16.92,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I noticed that at recess,

89
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
she was the girl who picked the other girls to be on her team.

90
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:24,000
It was very obvious, from the beginning, that she was a leader.

91
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:28,000
This is on the way home. And that's North Korea up along the hill.

92
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
This is up along the DMZ.

93
0:04:29.4,000 --> 0:04:31,000
They would actually cover the windows every night,

94
0:04:31.8,000 --> 0:04:32,000
so that light couldn't be seen,

95
0:04:33.36,000 --> 0:04:35,000
because the South Korean government has said for years

96
0:04:35.92,000 --> 0:04:37,000
that the North Koreans may invade at any time.

97
0:04:38.119,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So the closer you were to North Korea, the more terrifying it was.

98
0:04:41.44,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Very often at school, I'd be taking pictures,

99
0:04:43.76,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and she would whisper into her girlfriends' ears,

100
0:04:46.12,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and then look at me and say, "Stop."

101
0:04:47.96,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And I would stand at attention, and all the girls would crack up,

102
0:04:51.04,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and it was sort of a little joke.

103
0:04:52.68,000 --> 0:04:53,000
(Laughter)

104
0:04:54.08,000 --> 0:04:56,000
The end of the week came and my translator came back,

105
0:04:56.6,000 --> 0:04:57,000
because I'd asked her to come back,

106
0:04:58.32,000 --> 0:05:,000
so I could formally thank the grandmother and Eun-Sook.

107
0:05:01.08,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And in the course of the grandmother talking to the translator,

108
0:05:04.36,000 --> 0:05:05,000
the grandmother started crying.

109
0:05:06.08,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And I said to my translator, "What's going on, why is she crying?"

110
0:05:09.24,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And she spoke to the grandmother for a moment,

111
0:05:11.44,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and then she started getting tears in her eyes.

112
0:05:13.68,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And I said, "What did I do? Why is everyone crying?"

113
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And the translator said,

114
0:05:17.4,000 --> 0:05:19,000
"The grandmother says that she thinks she's dying,

115
0:05:20.24,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and she wants to know if you would take Eun-Sook to America with you."

116
0:05:24.76,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And I said, "I'm 28 years old and I live in hotels,

117
0:05:30.08,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and I'm not married."

118
0:05:31.92,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I mean, I had fallen in love with this girl,

119
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
but you know, emotionally I was about 12 years old.

120
0:05:37.12,000 --> 0:05:38,000
If you know of photographers,

121
0:05:38.72,000 --> 0:05:42,000
the joke is it's the finest form of delayed adolescence ever invented.

122
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
"Sorry, I have to go on an assignment, I'll be back" --

123
0:05:45.8,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and then you never come back.

124
0:05:47.24,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So I asked the translator why she thought she was dying.

125
0:05:52.56,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Can I get her to a hospital? Could I pay to get her a doctor?

126
0:05:55.48,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And she refused any help at all.

127
0:05:57.52,000 --> 0:06:,000
So when I got outside, I gave the translator some money and said,

128
0:06:00.704,000 --> 0:06:02,000
"Go back and see if you can do something."

129
0:06:02.824,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And I gave the grandmother my business card.

130
0:06:04.92,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And I said, "If you're serious, I will try to find a family for her."

131
0:06:08.2,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And I immediately wrote a letter to my best friends in Atlanta, Georgia,

132
0:06:11.64,000 --> 0:06:12,000
who had an 11-year-old son.

133
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And my best friend had mistakenly one day said something

134
0:06:16.48,000 --> 0:06:18,000
about wishing he had another child.

135
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So my friends Gene and Gayle had not heard from me in about a year,

136
0:06:23.08,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and suddenly I was calling,

137
0:06:24.52,000 --> 0:06:27,000
saying "I'm in Korea and I've met this extraordinary girl."

138
0:06:27.8,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And I said, "The grandmother thinks she's sick,

139
0:06:30.52,000 --> 0:06:33,000
but I think maybe we would have to bring the grandmother over also."

140
0:06:34.04,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And I said, "I'll pay for the ... " I mean, I had this whole sort of picture.

141
0:06:37.72,000 --> 0:06:38,000
So anyway, I left.

142
0:06:39,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And my friends actually said they were very interested in adopting her.

143
0:06:44.52,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And I said, "Look, I think I'll scare the grandmother to death,

144
0:06:47.52,000 --> 0:06:49,000
if I tell her that you're willing to adopt her.

145
0:06:50.12,000 --> 0:06:53,000
I want to go back and talk to her." But I was off on assignment.

146
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I figured I'd come back in a couple of weeks

147
0:06:55.28,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and talk to the grandmother.

148
0:06:56.68,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And on Christmas Day, I was in Bangkok with a group of photographers

149
0:06:59.92,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and got a telegram -- back in those days, you got telegrams --

150
0:07:02.88,000 --> 0:07:04,000
from Time magazine saying someone in Korea had died

151
0:07:05.32,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and left their child in a will to me.

152
0:07:07.6,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Did I know anything about this?

153
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Because I hadn't told them what I was doing,

154
0:07:11.28,000 --> 0:07:13,000
because I was so upset with the story they'd run.

155
0:07:13.84,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So, I went back to Korea, and I went back to Eun-Sook's village,

156
0:07:17.24,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and she was gone.

157
0:07:18.48,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And the house that I had spent time in was empty.

158
0:07:21.2,000 --> 0:07:22,000
It was incredibly cold.

159
0:07:22.84,000 --> 0:07:24,000
No one in the village would tell me where Eun-Sook was,

160
0:07:25.48,000 --> 0:07:27,000
because the grandmother had always hidden her from Westerners.

161
0:07:28.44,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And they had no idea about this request that she'd made of me.

162
0:07:31.4,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So I finally found Myung Sung,

163
0:07:33.24,000 --> 0:07:36,000
her best friend that she used to play with after school every day.

164
0:07:36.4,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And Myung Sung, under some pressure from me and the translator,

165
0:07:39.4,000 --> 0:07:41,000
gave us an address on the outside of Seoul.

166
0:07:41.8,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And I went to that address and knocked on the door,

167
0:07:46.44,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and a man answered the door.

168
0:07:47.84,000 --> 0:07:51,000
It was not a very nice area of Seoul, there were mud streets outside of it.

169
0:07:52.76,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And I knocked on the door and Eun-Sook answered the door,

170
0:07:55.48,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and her eyes were bloodshot, and she seemed to be in shock.

171
0:07:58.28,000 --> 0:08:,000
She didn't recognize me -- there was no recognition whatsoever.

172
0:08:01.28,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And this man came to the door and kind of barked something in Korean.

173
0:08:04.56,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And I said to the translator, "What did he say?"

174
0:08:06.84,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And she said, "He wants to know who you are."

175
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And I said, "Tell him that I am a photographer."

176
0:08:11.28,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I started explaining who I was, and he interrupted.

177
0:08:13.72,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And she said, "He says he knows who you are, what do you want?"

178
0:08:16.72,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I said, "Well, tell him that I was asked by this little girl's grandmother

179
0:08:21.2,000 --> 0:08:22,000
to find a family for her."

180
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And he said, "I'm her uncle, she's fine, you can leave now."

181
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
So I was --

182
0:08:30.68,000 --> 0:08:31,000
The door was being slammed in my face,

183
0:08:32.56,000 --> 0:08:34,000
it's incredibly cold, and I'm trying to think,

184
0:08:34.76,000 --> 0:08:37,000
"What would the hero do in a movie, if I was writing this as a movie script?"

185
0:08:38.44,000 --> 0:08:4,000
So I said, "It's really cold, I've come a very long way,

186
0:08:41.12,000 --> 0:08:43,000
do you mind if I come in for a minute? I'm freezing."

187
0:08:43.64,000 --> 0:08:45,000
So the guy reluctantly let us in and we sat down on the floor.

188
0:08:46.6,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And as we started talking, I saw him yell something,

189
0:08:49.079,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and Eun-Sook came and brought us some food.

190
0:08:51.88,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And I had this whole mental picture of -- sort of like Cinderella.

191
0:08:55.24,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I sort of had this picture of this incredibly wonderful,

192
0:08:58.76,000 --> 0:08:59,000
bright, happy little child,

193
0:09:00.76,000 --> 0:09:04,000
who now appeared to be very withdrawn, being enslaved by this family.

194
0:09:05.76,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And I was really appalled, and I couldn't figure out what to do.

195
0:09:08.84,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And the more I tried talking to him, the less friendly he was getting.

196
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
So finally I said "Look," -- this is all through the translator,

197
0:09:15.2,000 --> 0:09:17,000
because, you know, I don't speak a word of Korean --

198
0:09:17.68,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and I said, "Look, I'm really glad that Eun-Sook has a family to live with.

199
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:23,000
I was very worried about her.

200
0:09:23.44,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I made a promise to her grandmother, your mother, that I would find a family,

201
0:09:27.12,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and I'm so happy that you're going to take care of her.

202
0:09:29.76,000 --> 0:09:31,000
But I bought an airline ticket and I'm stuck here for a week.

203
0:09:32.68,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I'm staying in a hotel downtown.

204
0:09:34.28,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Would you like to come and have lunch tomorrow?

205
0:09:36.52,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And you can practice your English."

206
0:09:38.24,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Because he told me -- I was trying to ask him questions about himself.

207
0:09:41.56,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And so I went to the hotel, and I found two older Amerasians.

208
0:09:45.68,000 --> 0:09:49,000
A girl whose mother had been a prostitute,

209
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and she was a prostitute,

210
0:09:52.04,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and a boy who'd been in and out of jail.

211
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And I said to them, "Look, there's a little girl

212
0:09:56.32,000 --> 0:09:59,000
who has a tiny chance of getting out of here

213
0:09:59.48,000 --> 0:10:,000
and going to America.

214
0:10:00.76,000 --> 0:10:02,000
I don't know if it's the right decision or not,

215
0:10:03.12,000 --> 0:10:05,000
but I would like you to come to lunch tomorrow

216
0:10:05.32,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and tell the uncle what it's like to walk down the street,

217
0:10:08.08,000 --> 0:10:1,000
what people say to you, what you do for a living.

218
0:10:10.68,000 --> 0:10:13,000
I want him to understand what happens if she stays here.

219
0:10:13.72,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And I could be wrong, I don't know, but I wish you would come tomorrow."

220
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So, these two came to lunch and we got thrown out of the restaurant.

221
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:24,000
They were yelling at him, it got to be really ugly.

222
0:10:24.48,000 --> 0:10:25,000
We went outside, and he was just furious.

223
0:10:26.457,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And I knew I had totally blown this thing.

224
0:10:28.52,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Here I was again, trying to figure out what to do.

225
0:10:30.92,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And he started yelling at me, and I said to the translator,

226
0:10:33.76,000 --> 0:10:35,000
"Tell him to calm down, what is he saying?"

227
0:10:35.8,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And she said, "He's saying, 'Who the hell are you to walk into my house,

228
0:10:39.24,000 --> 0:10:41,000
some rich American with your cameras around your neck,

229
0:10:41.8,000 --> 0:10:43,000
accusing me of enslaving my niece?

230
0:10:44.52,000 --> 0:10:47,000
This is my niece, I love her, she's my sister's daughter.

231
0:10:47.846,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Who the hell are you to accuse me of something like this?'"

232
0:10:52.28,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And I said, you know, "Look, you're absolutely right.

233
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
I don't pretend to understand what's going on here.

234
0:10:57.6,000 --> 0:10:59,000
All I know is, I've been photographing a lot of these children.

235
0:11:00.6,000 --> 0:11:02,000
I'm in love with your niece,

236
0:11:03.56,000 --> 0:11:05,000
I think she's an incredibly special child."

237
0:11:05.92,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And I said, "Look, I will fly my friends over here from the United States

238
0:11:09.4,000 --> 0:11:11,000
if you want to meet them, to see if you approve of them.

239
0:11:12.08,000 --> 0:11:15,000
I just think that -- what little I know about the situation,

240
0:11:15.72,000 --> 0:11:17,000
she has very little chance here of having the kind of life

241
0:11:18.48,000 --> 0:11:2,000
that you probably would like her to have."

242
0:11:20.52,000 --> 0:11:23,000
So, everyone told me afterwards that inviting the prospective parents over

243
0:11:24.04,000 --> 0:11:26,000
was, again, the stupidest thing I could have possibly done,

244
0:11:26.84,000 --> 0:11:28,000
because who's ever good enough for your relative?

245
0:11:29.2,000 --> 0:11:32,000
But he invited me to come to a ceremony they were having that day

246
0:11:32.32,000 --> 0:11:33,000
for her grandmother.

247
0:11:33.72,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And they actually take items of clothing and photographs,

248
0:11:36.44,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and they burn them as part of the ritual.

249
0:11:39.2,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And you can see how different she looks just in three months.

250
0:11:42.12,000 --> 0:11:44,000
This was now, I think, early February.

251
0:11:44.56,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And the pictures before were taken in September.

252
0:11:48.2,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Well, there was an American Maryknoll priest

253
0:11:50.32,000 --> 0:11:52,000
that I had met in the course of doing the story,

254
0:11:52.6,000 --> 0:11:53,000
who had 75 children living in his house.

255
0:11:54.56,000 --> 0:11:56,000
He had three women helping him take care of these kids.

256
0:11:57.2,000 --> 0:12:,000
And so I suggested to the uncle that we go down and meet Father Keane

257
0:12:00.48,000 --> 0:12:02,000
to find out how the adoption process worked.

258
0:12:02.6,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Because I wanted him to feel

259
0:12:04,000 --> 0:12:06,000
like this was all being done very much above board.

260
0:12:06.44,000 --> 0:12:08,000
So, this is on the way down to the orphanage.

261
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
This is Father Keane. He's just a wonderful guy.

262
0:12:14.24,000 --> 0:12:16,000
He had kids from all over Korea living there,

263
0:12:16.52,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and he would find families for these kids.

264
0:12:19.6,000 --> 0:12:21,000
This is a social worker interviewing Eun-Sook.

265
0:12:22.08,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Now, I had always thought she was completely untouched by all of this,

266
0:12:25.52,000 --> 0:12:26,000
because the grandmother, to me,

267
0:12:27.04,000 --> 0:12:3,000
appeared to be sort of the village wise woman --

268
0:12:30.64,000 --> 0:12:33,000
throughout the day, I noticed people kept coming to visit her grandmother.

269
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And I always had this mental picture

270
0:12:35.92,000 --> 0:12:38,000
that even though they may have been one of the poorer families in the village,

271
0:12:39.64,000 --> 0:12:4,000
they were one of the most respected.

272
0:12:41.4,000 --> 0:12:44,000
And I always felt that the grandmother had kind of demanded, and insisted,

273
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:48,000
that the villagers treat Eun-Sook with the same respect they treated her.

274
0:12:50.4,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Eun-Sook stayed at Father Keane's,

275
0:12:52.52,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and her uncle agreed to let her stay there until the adoption went through.

276
0:12:56.12,000 --> 0:12:57,000
He actually agreed to the adoption.

277
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:,000
And I went off on assignment and came back a week later,

278
0:13:00.68,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and Father Keane said, "I've got to talk to you about Eun-Sook."

279
0:13:03.72,000 --> 0:13:04,000
I said, "Oh God, now what?"

280
0:13:05.08,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And he takes me into this room, closes the door and says,

281
0:13:07.8,000 --> 0:13:1,000
"I have 75 children here in the orphanage, and it's total bedlam."

282
0:13:10.96,000 --> 0:13:11,000
There's clothes, there's kids.

283
0:13:12.44,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Three adults and 75 kids -- you can imagine.

284
0:13:14.8,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And he said, "The second day she was here she made up a list

285
0:13:17.68,000 --> 0:13:19,000
of all of the names of the older kids and the younger kids.

286
0:13:20.68,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And she assigned one of the older kids to each of the younger kids.

287
0:13:24.24,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And then she set up a work detail list of who cleaned the orphanage on what day."

288
0:13:28.84,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And he said, "She's telling me that I'm messy

289
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and I have to clean up my room."

290
0:13:32.6,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And he said, "I don't know who raised her, but she's running the orphanage,

291
0:13:36.2,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and she's been here three days."

292
0:13:37.8,000 --> 0:13:38,000
(Laughter)

293
0:13:39.28,000 --> 0:13:43,000
This was movie day that she organized where all the kids went to the movies.

294
0:13:44.36,000 --> 0:13:47,000
A lot of the kids who had been adopted wrote back to the other kids,

295
0:13:47.6,000 --> 0:13:49,000
telling them what their life was like with their new families.

296
0:13:50.56,000 --> 0:13:52,000
So it was a really big deal when the letters showed up.

297
0:13:53.2,000 --> 0:13:55,000
This is a woman who is now working at the orphanage,

298
0:13:55.68,000 --> 0:13:56,000
whose son had been adopted.

299
0:14:00.12,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Gene and Gayle started studying Korean

300
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
the moment they had gotten my first letter.

301
0:14:04.2,000 --> 0:14:08,000
They really wanted to be able to welcome Eun-Sook into their family.

302
0:14:08.72,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And one of the things Father Keane told me

303
0:14:10.8,000 --> 0:14:12,000
when I came back from one of these trips --

304
0:14:12.84,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Eun-Sook had chosen the name Natasha,

305
0:14:14.76,000 --> 0:14:18,000
which I understood was from her watching a "Rocky and Bullwinkle" cartoon

306
0:14:19.04,000 --> 0:14:2,000
on the American Air Force station.

307
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:23,000
This may be one of those myth-buster things

308
0:14:23.08,000 --> 0:14:25,000
that we'll have to clear up here, in a minute.

309
0:14:25.28,000 --> 0:14:27,000
So, my friend Gene flew over with his son, Tim.

310
0:14:27.6,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Gayle couldn't come.

311
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And they spent a lot of time huddled over a dictionary.

312
0:14:31.8,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And this was Gene showing the uncle

313
0:14:33.52,000 --> 0:14:35,000
where Atlanta was on the map, where he lived.

314
0:14:36.96,000 --> 0:14:38,000
This is the uncle signing the adoption papers.

315
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Now, we went out to dinner that night to celebrate.

316
0:14:42.44,000 --> 0:14:43,000
The uncle went back to his family

317
0:14:44.08,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and Natasha and Tim and Gene and I went out to dinner.

318
0:14:47.56,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And Gene was showing Natasha how to use a knife and fork,

319
0:14:51.44,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and then Natasha was returning the utensil lessons.

320
0:14:56.12,000 --> 0:14:57,000
We went back to our hotel room,

321
0:14:58.04,000 --> 0:15:,000
and Gene was showing Natasha also where Atlanta was.

322
0:15:00.52,000 --> 0:15:01,000
This is the third night we were in Korea.

323
0:15:02.52,000 --> 0:15:05,000
The first night we'd gotten a room for the kids right next to us.

324
0:15:05.6,000 --> 0:15:07,000
I'd been staying in this room for about three months --

325
0:15:08.24,000 --> 0:15:1,000
it was a little 15-story Korean hotel.

326
0:15:11.76,000 --> 0:15:13,000
The second night, we didn't keep the kids' room,

327
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
because we slept on the floor with all the kids at the orphanage.

328
0:15:17.28,000 --> 0:15:18,000
And the third night, we came back --

329
0:15:19.04,000 --> 0:15:21,000
we'd just gone out to dinner, where you saw the pictures --

330
0:15:21.84,000 --> 0:15:23,000
and we got to the front desk, and the guy said,

331
0:15:24.08,000 --> 0:15:26,000
"There's no other free rooms on your floor tonight,

332
0:15:26.52,000 --> 0:15:28,000
you can put the kids five floors below you."

333
0:15:28.64,000 --> 0:15:3,000
And Gene and I looked at each other and said,

334
0:15:30.8,000 --> 0:15:32,000
"We don't want two 11-year-olds five floors away."

335
0:15:33.2,000 --> 0:15:36,000
So his son said, "I have a sleeping bag, I'll sleep on the floor."

336
0:15:36.36,000 --> 0:15:38,000
And I said, "I have one too." So Tim and I slept on the floor,

337
0:15:39.32,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Natasha got one bed, Gene got the other -- kids pass out,

338
0:15:42.12,000 --> 0:15:43,000
it's been very exciting for three days.

339
0:15:44.04,000 --> 0:15:47,000
We're lying in bed, and Gene and I are talking about how cool we are.

340
0:15:47.56,000 --> 0:15:49,000
We said, "That was so great, we saved this little girl's life."

341
0:15:50.56,000 --> 0:15:53,000
We were just like, you know, just full of ourselves.

342
0:15:54.04,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And we fall asleep --

343
0:15:55.4,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and I've been in this room for a couple of months now.

344
0:15:58,000 --> 0:16:01,000
And they always overheat the hotels in Korea terribly,

345
0:16:01.88,000 --> 0:16:03,000
so during the day I always left the window open.

346
0:16:04.2,000 --> 0:16:06,000
And then about midnight, they turn the heat off in the hotel.

347
0:16:07.12,000 --> 0:16:1,000
So at 1am, the whole room would be like 20 below zero, and I'd get up.

348
0:16:10.44,000 --> 0:16:12,000
I'd been doing this every night I'd been there.

349
0:16:12.68,000 --> 0:16:14,000
So, sure enough, it's one o'clock, room's freezing,

350
0:16:15.2,000 --> 0:16:18,000
I go to close the window and I hear people shouting outside,

351
0:16:18.92,000 --> 0:16:2,000
and I thought, "Oh, the bars must have just gotten out."

352
0:16:21.564,000 --> 0:16:23,000
I don't speak Korean, but I'm hearing these voices,

353
0:16:24,000 --> 0:16:26,000
and I'm not hearing anger, I'm hearing terror.

354
0:16:27.24,000 --> 0:16:29,000
So I open the window and I look out,

355
0:16:29.36,000 --> 0:16:31,000
and there's flames coming up the side of our hotel,

356
0:16:32.12,000 --> 0:16:33,000
and the hotel's on fire.

357
0:16:33.84,000 --> 0:16:34,000
So I run over to Gene and I wake him up,

358
0:16:35.8,000 --> 0:16:37,000
and I say, "Don't freak out, I think the hotel's on fire."

359
0:16:38.6,000 --> 0:16:4,000
And now there's smoke and flames coming by our windows --

360
0:16:41.32,000 --> 0:16:42,000
we're on the 11th floor.

361
0:16:42.6,000 --> 0:16:44,000
So the two of us were just like, "Oh my God, oh my God."

362
0:16:45.28,000 --> 0:16:48,000
So we're trying to get Natasha up, and we can't talk to her.

363
0:16:48.68,000 --> 0:16:51,000
You know what kids are like when they've been asleep for like an hour,

364
0:16:52,000 --> 0:16:54,000
it's like they took five Valiums -- they're all over the place.

365
0:16:55,000 --> 0:16:56,000
And we can't talk to her.

366
0:16:56.24,000 --> 0:16:59,000
His son had the L.L.Bean bootlaces, and we're trying to do up his laces.

367
0:16:59.68,000 --> 0:17:02,000
So we try to get to the door, we run to the door, we open the door,

368
0:17:02.88,000 --> 0:17:04,000
and it's like walking into a blast furnace.

369
0:17:04.96,000 --> 0:17:07,000
There's people screaming, the sound of glass breaking, weird thumps.

370
0:17:08.36,000 --> 0:17:1,000
And the whole room filled with smoke in about two seconds.

371
0:17:11.2,000 --> 0:17:13,000
And Gene turns around and says, "We're not going to make it."

372
0:17:14.12,000 --> 0:17:17,000
And he closes the door, and the whole room is now filled with smoke.

373
0:17:17.36,000 --> 0:17:18,000
We're all choking, and there's smoke

374
0:17:19.12,000 --> 0:17:21,000
pouring through the vents, under the doors.

375
0:17:21.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
There's people screaming.

376
0:17:22.44,000 --> 0:17:24,000
I just remember this unbelievable -- just utter chaos.

377
0:17:25.08,000 --> 0:17:28,000
I remember sitting near the bed, and I had two overwhelming feelings.

378
0:17:28.6,000 --> 0:17:31,000
One was absolute terror. "Oh, please God, I just want to wake up.

379
0:17:31.92,000 --> 0:17:33,000
This has got to be a nightmare, this can't be happening.

380
0:17:34.6,000 --> 0:17:35,000
Please, I just want to wake up."

381
0:17:36.2,000 --> 0:17:37,000
And the other is unbelievable guilt.

382
0:17:37.96,000 --> 0:17:39,000
Here I've been playing God with my friends' lives,

383
0:17:40.36,000 --> 0:17:41,000
my friends' son, with Natasha's life,

384
0:17:42.2,000 --> 0:17:45,000
and this what you get when you try playing God, is you hurt people.

385
0:17:45.52,000 --> 0:17:47,000
I remember just being so frightened and terrified.

386
0:17:47.92,000 --> 0:17:48,000
And Gene, who's lying on the floor, says,

387
0:17:49.92,000 --> 0:17:51,000
"We've got to soak towels." I said, "What?"

388
0:17:52,000 --> 0:17:54,000
"We've got to soak towels. We're going to die from the smoke."

389
0:17:54.96,000 --> 0:17:56,000
So got towels and put them over our faces and the kids' faces.

390
0:17:57.889,000 --> 0:17:59,000
Then he said, "Do you have gaffer's tape?"

391
0:17:59.96,000 --> 0:18:,000
"What?" "Do you have gaffer's tape?"

392
0:18:01.72,000 --> 0:18:02,000
I said, "Somewhere in my Halliburton."

393
0:18:03.6,000 --> 0:18:05,000
He says, "We've got to stop the smoke. That's all we can do."

394
0:18:06.482,000 --> 0:18:07,000
I mean, Gene -- thank God for Gene.

395
0:18:08.96,000 --> 0:18:12,000
So we put the room service menus over the vents in the wall,

396
0:18:13.84,000 --> 0:18:15,000
we put blankets at the bottom of the door,

397
0:18:15.92,000 --> 0:18:17,000
we put the kids on the windowsill to try to get some air.

398
0:18:18.64,000 --> 0:18:19,000
And there was a new building, going up,

399
0:18:20.56,000 --> 0:18:22,000
that was being built right across the street from our hotel.

400
0:18:23.44,000 --> 0:18:25,000
And there, in the building, were photographers,

401
0:18:25.655,000 --> 0:18:26,000
waiting for people to jump.

402
0:18:27.48,000 --> 0:18:29,000
Eleven people ended up dying in the fire.

403
0:18:29.6,000 --> 0:18:33,000
Five people jumped and died, other people were killed by the smoke.

404
0:18:33.68,000 --> 0:18:37,000
And there's this loud thumping on the door after about 45 minutes in all this,

405
0:18:38.68,000 --> 0:18:39,000
and people were shouting in Korean.

406
0:18:40.4,000 --> 0:18:41,000
And I remember --

407
0:18:45.16,000 --> 0:18:47,000
Natasha didn't want us opening the door --

408
0:18:47.8,000 --> 0:18:48,000
sorry, I was trying not to open the door,

409
0:18:49.8,000 --> 0:18:51,000
because we'd spent so much time barricading the room.

410
0:18:52.32,000 --> 0:18:54,000
I didn't know who it was, I didn't know what they wanted,

411
0:18:55.04,000 --> 0:18:57,000
and Natasha could tell they were firemen trying to get us out.

412
0:18:58,000 --> 0:19:01,000
I remember a sort of a tussle at the door, trying to get the door open.

413
0:19:01.36,000 --> 0:19:05,000
In any case, 12 hours later -- I mean, they put us in the lobby.

414
0:19:05.8,000 --> 0:19:08,000
Gene ended up using his coat, and his fist in the coat,

415
0:19:09.44,000 --> 0:19:1,000
to break open a liquor cabinet.

416
0:19:11,000 --> 0:19:12,000
People were lying on the floor.

417
0:19:12.56,000 --> 0:19:14,000
It was one of just the most horrifying nights.

418
0:19:14.76,000 --> 0:19:17,000
And then 12 hours later, we rented a car, as we had planned to,

419
0:19:18.52,000 --> 0:19:19,000
and drove back to Natasha's village.

420
0:19:20.52,000 --> 0:19:23,000
And we kept saying, "Do you realize we were dying in a hotel fire,

421
0:19:23.68,000 --> 0:19:24,000
like eight hours ago?"

422
0:19:24.92,000 --> 0:19:25,000
It's so weird how life just goes on.

423
0:19:26.68,000 --> 0:19:29,000
Natasha wanted to introduce her brother and father to all the villagers,

424
0:19:30.12,000 --> 0:19:33,000
and the day we showed up turned out to be a 60-year-old man's birthday.

425
0:19:33.48,000 --> 0:19:34,000
This guy's 60 years old.

426
0:19:34.72,000 --> 0:19:35,000
So it turned into a dual celebration,

427
0:19:36.52,000 --> 0:19:38,000
because Natasha was the first person from this village

428
0:19:39.08,000 --> 0:19:4,000
ever to go to the United States.

429
0:19:40.68,000 --> 0:19:41,000
So, these are the greenhouse tents.

430
0:19:42.4,000 --> 0:19:44,000
This is the elders teaching Gene their dances.

431
0:19:44.6,000 --> 0:19:45,000
We drank a lot of rice wine.

432
0:19:46,000 --> 0:19:48,000
We were both so drunk, I couldn't believe it.

433
0:19:51.92,000 --> 0:19:53,000
This is the last picture before Gene and Tim headed back.

434
0:19:54.92,000 --> 0:19:55,000
The adoption people told us

435
0:19:56.6,000 --> 0:19:59,000
it was going to take a year for the adoption to go through.

436
0:20:00.24,000 --> 0:20:01,000
Like, what could you do for a year?

437
0:20:02.12,000 --> 0:20:05,000
So I found out the name of every official on both the Korean and American side,

438
0:20:05.88,000 --> 0:20:06,000
and I photographed them,

439
0:20:07.16,000 --> 0:20:1,000
and told them how famous they were going to be when this book was done.

440
0:20:10.52,000 --> 0:20:13,000
And four months later, the adoption papers came through.

441
0:20:14.4,000 --> 0:20:17,000
This is saying goodbye to everybody at the orphanage.

442
0:20:17.6,000 --> 0:20:19,000
This is Father Keane with Natasha at the bus stop.

443
0:20:20.96,000 --> 0:20:21,000
Her great aunt at the airport.

444
0:20:22.72,000 --> 0:20:25,000
I had a wonderful deal with Cathay Pacific airlines for many years,

445
0:20:26.16,000 --> 0:20:29,000
where they gave me free passes on all their airlines

446
0:20:29.2,000 --> 0:20:3,000
in return for photography.

447
0:20:30.52,000 --> 0:20:31,000
It was like the ultimate perk.

448
0:20:32.32,000 --> 0:20:33,000
And the pilot, I actually knew --

449
0:20:34.24,000 --> 0:20:36,000
because they used to let me sit in the jump seat,

450
0:20:36.6,000 --> 0:20:37,000
to tell you how long ago this was.

451
0:20:38.28,000 --> 0:20:41,000
This is a TriStar, and so they let Natasha actually sit in the jump seat.

452
0:20:41.76,000 --> 0:20:43,000
And the pilot, Jeff Cowley, actually went back

453
0:20:43.96,000 --> 0:20:47,000
and adopted one of the other kids at the orphanage after meeting Natasha.

454
0:20:48.08,000 --> 0:20:5,000
This is 28 hours later in Atlanta.

455
0:20:50.16,000 --> 0:20:51,000
It's a very long flight.

456
0:20:51.6,000 --> 0:20:54,000
Just to make things even crazier, Gayle, Natasha's new mom,

457
0:20:54.96,000 --> 0:20:56,000
was three days away from giving birth to her own daughter.

458
0:20:58.92,000 --> 0:21:,000
You know, if you were writing this, you'd say,

459
0:21:01.12,000 --> 0:21:03,000
"No, we've got to write the script differently."

460
0:21:03.4,000 --> 0:21:06,000
This is the first night showing Natasha her new cousins and uncles and aunts.

461
0:21:07.12,000 --> 0:21:11,000
Gene and Gayle know everyone in Atlanta -- they're the most social couple imaginable.

462
0:21:11.2,000 --> 0:21:13,000
So, at this point, Natasha doesn't speak a word of English,

463
0:21:14.141,000 --> 0:21:16,000
other than what little Father Keane taught her.

464
0:21:17.16,000 --> 0:21:2,000
This is Kylie, her sister, who's now a doctor, on the right.

465
0:21:23.6,000 --> 0:21:26,000
This is a deal I had with Natasha, which is that when we got to Atlanta

466
0:21:27.04,000 --> 0:21:29,000
she could cut off my beard.

467
0:21:29.72,000 --> 0:21:3,000
She never liked it very much.

468
0:21:32.6,000 --> 0:21:33,000
She learned English in three months.

469
0:21:34.4,000 --> 0:21:36,000
She entered seventh grade at her own age level.

470
0:21:39.36,000 --> 0:21:4,000
Pledge of Allegiance for the first time.

471
0:21:41.32,000 --> 0:21:42,000
This is her cooking teacher.

472
0:21:42.72,000 --> 0:21:44,000
Natasha told me a lot of the kids thought she was stuck up,

473
0:21:45.56,000 --> 0:21:47,000
because they would talk to her and she wouldn't answer,

474
0:21:48.2,000 --> 0:21:5,000
and they didn't realize she didn't speak English very well.

475
0:21:51,000 --> 0:21:52,000
But what I noticed, again as an observer,

476
0:21:53,000 --> 0:21:55,000
was she was choosing who was going to be on her team,

477
0:21:57.48,000 --> 0:22:,000
and seemed to be very popular very, very quickly.

478
0:22:01.2,000 --> 0:22:02,000
Now, remember the picture,

479
0:22:02.52,000 --> 0:22:04,000
how much she looked like her grandmother, at the beginning?

480
0:22:05.32,000 --> 0:22:08,000
People were always telling Natasha how much she looks like her mother, Gayle.

481
0:22:09,000 --> 0:22:1,000
(Laughter)

482
0:22:11.04,000 --> 0:22:14,000
This is a tense moment in the first football game, I think.

483
0:22:17.04,000 --> 0:22:21,000
And Kylie -- I mean, it was almost like Kylie was her own child.

484
0:22:26.2,000 --> 0:22:27,000
She's being baptized.

485
0:22:29,000 --> 0:22:3,000
Now, a lot of parents, when they adopt,

486
0:22:30.92,000 --> 0:22:32,000
actually want to erase their children's history.

487
0:22:33.2,000 --> 0:22:35,000
And Gayle and Gene did the complete opposite.

488
0:22:35.36,000 --> 0:22:37,000
They were studying Korean; they bought Korean clothes.

489
0:22:37.96,000 --> 0:22:39,000
Gene even did a little tile work in the kitchen,

490
0:22:40.24,000 --> 0:22:42,000
which was that, "Once upon a time, there was a beautiful girl

491
0:22:43.16,000 --> 0:22:46,000
that came from the hills of Korea to live happily ever after in Atlanta."

492
0:22:46.613,000 --> 0:22:48,000
She hates this picture -- it was her first job.

493
0:22:48.853,000 --> 0:22:5,000
She bought a bright red Karmann Ghia

494
0:22:51.28,000 --> 0:22:53,000
with the money she made working at Burger King.

495
0:22:53.68,000 --> 0:22:54,000
The captain of the cheerleaders.

496
0:22:56,000 --> 0:22:57,000
Beauty pageant.

497
0:22:58.8,000 --> 0:23:,000
Used to do their Christmas card every year.

498
0:23:00.96,000 --> 0:23:02,000
Gene's been restoring this car for a million years.

499
0:23:07.16,000 --> 0:23:11,000
Kodak hired Natasha to be a translator for them at the Olympics in Korea.

500
0:23:11.32,000 --> 0:23:15,000
Her future husband, Jeff, was working for Canon cameras,

501
0:23:16.24,000 --> 0:23:18,000
and met Natasha at the Olympic Village.

502
0:23:19.76,000 --> 0:23:21,000
This is her first trip back to Korea. So there's her uncle.

503
0:23:23.68,000 --> 0:23:24,000
This is her half sister.

504
0:23:26.72,000 --> 0:23:27,000
She went back to the village.

505
0:23:28.16,000 --> 0:23:29,000
That's her best friend's mother.

506
0:23:32,000 --> 0:23:35,000
And I always thought that was a very Annie Hall kind of outfit.

507
0:23:35.32,000 --> 0:23:36,000
(Laughter)

508
0:23:37.32,000 --> 0:23:4,000
It's just, you know, it was just so interesting, just to watch --

509
0:23:40.4,000 --> 0:23:42,000
this is her mother in the background there.

510
0:23:47.367,000 --> 0:23:48,000
This is Natasha's wedding day.

511
0:23:53.96,000 --> 0:23:54,000
Gene is looking a little older.

512
0:24:06.92,000 --> 0:24:1,000
This is Sydney, who's going to be three years old in a couple of days.

513
0:24:12.28,000 --> 0:24:13,000
And there's Evan.

514
0:24:14.88,000 --> 0:24:16,000
And Natasha, would you just come up, for a second,

515
0:24:17.44,000 --> 0:24:18,000
just maybe to say hello to everybody?

516
0:24:19.28,000 --> 0:24:24,000
(Applause)

517
0:24:29.68,000 --> 0:24:31,000
Natasha's actually never heard me tell the story.

518
0:24:32.04,000 --> 0:24:34,000
You know, we've looked at the pictures together.

519
0:24:34.32,000 --> 0:24:36,000
Natasha: I've seen pictures millions of times,

520
0:24:36.52,000 --> 0:24:39,000
but today was the first time I'm actually seeing him give the whole presentation.

521
0:24:41.2,000 --> 0:24:42,000
I started crying.

522
0:24:43.08,000 --> 0:24:45,000
Rick Smolan: There's about 40 things she's going to tell me,

523
0:24:45.96,000 --> 0:24:48,000
"That wasn't what happened." Natasha: I'll tell you that later.

524
0:24:49.32,000 --> 0:24:52,000
RS: Anyway, thank you, Mike and Richard, so much for letting us tell the story.

525
0:24:53.24,000 --> 0:24:54,000
Thank you, all of you.

526
0:24:54.52,000 --> 0:24:57,000
(Applause)

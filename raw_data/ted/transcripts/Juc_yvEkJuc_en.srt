1
0:00:13.531,000 --> 0:00:17,000
On the 17th of October, 2009,

2
0:00:18.222,000 --> 0:00:22,000
President Mohamed Nasheed of the Maldives did something unusual.

3
0:00:23.811,000 --> 0:00:26,000
He held his cabinet meeting underwater.

4
0:00:31.614,000 --> 0:00:35,000
He literally took his ministers scuba diving, as it were,

5
0:00:36.154,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to warn the world that his country could drown

6
0:00:40.657,000 --> 0:00:42,000
unless we control global warming.

7
0:00:43.741,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Now I don't know whether he got his message across to the world or not,

8
0:00:47.17,000 --> 0:00:48,000
but he certainly caught mine.

9
0:00:49.908,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I saw a political stunt.

10
0:00:52.901,000 --> 0:00:53,000
You see, I'm a politician,

11
0:00:54.601,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and I notice these things.

12
0:00:57.108,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And let's be honest,

13
0:00:58.775,000 --> 0:01:01,000
the Maldives are distant from where I come from --

14
0:01:02.774,000 --> 0:01:03,000
my country is Bhutan --

15
0:01:04.517,000 --> 0:01:07,000
so I didn't lose any sleep over their impending fate.

16
0:01:09.375,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Barely two months later, I saw another political stunt.

17
0:01:14.234,000 --> 0:01:17,000
This time, the prime minister of Nepal,

18
0:01:18.122,000 --> 0:01:21,000
he held his cabinet meeting on Mount Everest.

19
0:01:23.102,000 --> 0:01:28,000
He took all his ministers all the way up to the base camp of Everest

20
0:01:28.452,000 --> 0:01:29,000
to warn the world

21
0:01:30.418,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that the Himalayan glaciers were melting.

22
0:01:33.17,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Now did that worry me?

23
0:01:34.893,000 --> 0:01:35,000
You bet it did.

24
0:01:36.163,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I live in the Himalayas.

25
0:01:39.598,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But did I lose any sleep over his message?

26
0:01:43.205,000 --> 0:01:44,000
No.

27
0:01:44.748,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I wasn't ready to let a political stunt interfere with my beauty sleep.

28
0:01:50.952,000 --> 0:01:51,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:52.746,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Now fast-forward 10 years.

30
0:01:55.865,000 --> 0:01:57,000
In February this year,

31
0:01:58.41,000 --> 0:02:,000
I saw this report.

32
0:02:02.163,000 --> 0:02:05,000
This here report basically concludes

33
0:02:06.178,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that one-third of the ice on the Hindu Kush Himalaya mountains

34
0:02:12.356,000 --> 0:02:14,000
could melt by the end of the century.

35
0:02:15.085,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But that's only if,

36
0:02:17.404,000 --> 0:02:2,000
if we are able to contain global warming

37
0:02:20.635,000 --> 0:02:24,000
to 1.5 degrees centigrade over preindustrial levels.

38
0:02:24.94,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Otherwise, if we can't,

39
0:02:27.834,000 --> 0:02:28,000
the glaciers would melt much faster.

40
0:02:32.766,000 --> 0:02:35,000
1.5 degrees Celsius. "No way," I thought.

41
0:02:36.173,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Even the Paris Agreement's ambitious targets

42
0:02:39.514,000 --> 0:02:42,000
aimed to limit global warming to two degrees centigrade.

43
0:02:43.317,000 --> 0:02:47,000
1.5 degrees centigrade is what they call the best-case scenario.

44
0:02:49.435,000 --> 0:02:51,000
"Now this can't be true," I thought.

45
0:02:51.508,000 --> 0:02:53,000
The Hindu Kush Himalaya region

46
0:02:53.686,000 --> 0:02:56,000
is the world's third-largest repository of ice,

47
0:02:57.536,000 --> 0:02:58,000
after the North and South Poles.

48
0:02:59.21,000 --> 0:03:01,000
That's why we are also called the "Third Pole."

49
0:03:02.361,000 --> 0:03:04,000
There's a lot of ice in the region.

50
0:03:05.377,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And yes, the glaciers, they are melting.

51
0:03:08.38,000 --> 0:03:09,000
We know that.

52
0:03:10.253,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I have been to those in my country.

53
0:03:12.116,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I've seen them, and yes, they are melting.

54
0:03:14.241,000 --> 0:03:15,000
They are vulnerable.

55
0:03:15.822,000 --> 0:03:17,000
"But they can't be that vulnerable," I remember thinking.

56
0:03:21.275,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But what if they are?

57
0:03:23.739,000 --> 0:03:26,000
What if our glaciers melt much more quickly than I anticipate?

58
0:03:28.32,000 --> 0:03:32,000
What if our glaciers are much more vulnerable than previously thought?

59
0:03:32.968,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And what if, as a result, the glacial lakes --

60
0:03:36.463,000 --> 0:03:38,000
now these are lakes that form when glaciers melt --

61
0:03:39.392,000 --> 0:03:42,000
what if those lakes burst under the weight of additional water?

62
0:03:44.585,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And what if those floods cascade into other glacial lakes,

63
0:03:47.378,000 --> 0:03:49,000
creating even bigger outbursts?

64
0:03:50.452,000 --> 0:03:53,000
That would create unprecedented flash floods in my country.

65
0:03:55.113,000 --> 0:03:57,000
That would wreck my country.

66
0:03:58.302,000 --> 0:04:,000
That would wreak havoc in my country.

67
0:04:00.938,000 --> 0:04:03,000
That would have the potential to literally destroy our land,

68
0:04:04.502,000 --> 0:04:06,000
our livelihood, our way of life.

69
0:04:10.491,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So that report caught my attention

70
0:04:14.395,000 --> 0:04:17,000
in ways that political stunts couldn't.

71
0:04:17.759,000 --> 0:04:18,000
It was put together

72
0:04:18.972,000 --> 0:04:22,000
by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, or ICIMOD,

73
0:04:23.561,000 --> 0:04:24,000
which is based in Nepal.

74
0:04:25.6,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Scientists and experts have studied our glaciers for decades,

75
0:04:30.339,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and their report kept me awake at night, agonizing about the bad news

76
0:04:35.084,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and what it meant for my country

77
0:04:37.419,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and my people.

78
0:04:39.75,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So after several sleepless nights,

79
0:04:41.997,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I went to Nepal to visit ICIMOD.

80
0:04:46.892,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I found a team of highly competent and dedicated scientists there,

81
0:04:51.32,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and here's what they told me.

82
0:04:53.828,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Number one:

83
0:04:55.706,000 --> 0:04:59,000
the Hindu Kush Himalaya glaciers have been melting for some time now.

84
0:05:01.716,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Take that glacier, for instance.

85
0:05:05.278,000 --> 0:05:06,000
It's on Mount Everest.

86
0:05:07.12,000 --> 0:05:12,000
As you can see, this once massive glacier has already lost much of its ice.

87
0:05:14.029,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Number two:

88
0:05:15.562,000 --> 0:05:17,000
the glaciers are now melting much more quickly --

89
0:05:17.936,000 --> 0:05:23,000
so quickly, in fact, that at just 1.5 degrees centigrade of global warming,

90
0:05:24.209,000 --> 0:05:26,000
one-third of the glaciers would melt.

91
0:05:28.084,000 --> 0:05:31,000
At two degrees centigrade of global warming,

92
0:05:31.329,000 --> 0:05:33,000
half the glaciers would disappear.

93
0:05:33.815,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And if current trends were to continue,

94
0:05:36.965,000 --> 0:05:39,000
a full two-thirds of our glaciers would vanish.

95
0:05:42.339,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Number three:

96
0:05:44.295,000 --> 0:05:49,000
global warming means that our mountains receive more rain and less snow ...

97
0:05:50.779,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and, unlike snowfall, rain melts ice,

98
0:05:54.505,000 --> 0:05:56,000
which just hurts the health of our glaciers.

99
0:05:58.397,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Number four:

100
0:06:01.457,000 --> 0:06:04,000
pollution in the region has increased the amount of black carbon

101
0:06:04.482,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that's deposited on our glaciers.

102
0:06:06.666,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Black carbon is like soot.

103
0:06:08.045,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Black carbon absorbs heat

104
0:06:10.37,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and just accelerates the melting of glaciers.

105
0:06:14.243,000 --> 0:06:15,000
To summarize,

106
0:06:16.344,000 --> 0:06:18,000
our glaciers are melting rapidly,

107
0:06:19.775,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and global warming is making them melt much more quickly.

108
0:06:25.036,000 --> 0:06:26,000
But what does this mean?

109
0:06:27.539,000 --> 0:06:31,000
It means that the 240 million people

110
0:06:32.334,000 --> 0:06:34,000
who live in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region --

111
0:06:34.867,000 --> 0:06:39,000
in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, China, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar

112
0:06:40.143,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and my own beloved country, Bhutan --

113
0:06:42.793,000 --> 0:06:44,000
these people will be directly affected.

114
0:06:46.932,000 --> 0:06:47,000
When glaciers melt,

115
0:06:48.899,000 --> 0:06:49,000
when there's more rain and less snow,

116
0:06:50.84,000 --> 0:06:54,000
there will be huge changes in the way water behaves.

117
0:06:55.681,000 --> 0:06:56,000
There will be more extremes:

118
0:06:58.8,000 --> 0:07:01,000
more intense rain, more flash floods, more landslides,

119
0:07:01.99,000 --> 0:07:03,000
more glacial lake outburst floods.

120
0:07:04.952,000 --> 0:07:08,000
All this will cause unimaginable destruction

121
0:07:09.388,000 --> 0:07:13,000
in a region that already has some of the poorest people on earth.

122
0:07:15.971,000 --> 0:07:17,000
But it's not just the people in the immediate region

123
0:07:18.821,000 --> 0:07:19,000
who'll be affected.

124
0:07:20.134,000 --> 0:07:23,000
People living downstream will also be hit hard.

125
0:07:25.619,000 --> 0:07:29,000
That's because 10 of their major rivers

126
0:07:30.342,000 --> 0:07:32,000
originate in the Hindu Kush Himalaya mountains.

127
0:07:34.031,000 --> 0:07:38,000
These rivers provide critical water for agriculture

128
0:07:38.588,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and drinking water

129
0:07:40.066,000 --> 0:07:45,000
to more than 1.6 billion people living downstream.

130
0:07:45.094,000 --> 0:07:47,000
That's one in five humans.

131
0:07:49.149,000 --> 0:07:51,000
That's why the Hindu Kush Himalaya mountains

132
0:07:51.278,000 --> 0:07:53,000
are also called the "water towers of Asia."

133
0:07:55.815,000 --> 0:07:56,000
But when glaciers melt,

134
0:07:58.213,000 --> 0:07:59,000
when monsoons turn severe,

135
0:07:59.854,000 --> 0:08:01,000
those rivers will obviously flood,

136
0:08:03.432,000 --> 0:08:05,000
so there will be deluges when water is not required

137
0:08:06.425,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and droughts will be very common,

138
0:08:09.18,000 --> 0:08:1,000
when water is desperately required.

139
0:08:11.147,000 --> 0:08:16,000
In short, Asia's water tower will be broken,

140
0:08:16.966,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and that will be disastrous for one-fifth of humanity.

141
0:08:26.765,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Should the rest of the world care?

142
0:08:29.899,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Should you, for instance, care?

143
0:08:32.472,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Remember, I didn't care when I heard that the Maldives

144
0:08:35.669,000 --> 0:08:36,000
could disappear underwater.

145
0:08:37.544,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And that is the crux of the problem, isn't it?

146
0:08:40.694,000 --> 0:08:41,000
We don't care.

147
0:08:44.428,000 --> 0:08:46,000
We don't care until we are personally affected.

148
0:08:47.729,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I mean, we know. We know climate change is real.

149
0:08:50.444,000 --> 0:08:52,000
We know that we face drastic and dramatic change.

150
0:08:53.036,000 --> 0:08:54,000
We know that it is coming fast.

151
0:08:54.55,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Yet most of us

152
0:08:57.662,000 --> 0:09:,000
act as if everything were normal.

153
0:09:02.359,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So we must care,

154
0:09:04.726,000 --> 0:09:05,000
all of us,

155
0:09:06.332,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and if you can't care for those who are affected by the melting of glaciers,

156
0:09:11.07,000 --> 0:09:12,000
you should at least care for yourself.

157
0:09:14.193,000 --> 0:09:17,000
That's because the Hindu Kush Himalaya mountains --

158
0:09:17.29,000 --> 0:09:2,000
the entire region is like the pulse of the planet.

159
0:09:22.819,000 --> 0:09:24,000
If the region falls sick,

160
0:09:25.215,000 --> 0:09:27,000
the entire planet will eventually suffer.

161
0:09:29.164,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And right now,

162
0:09:30.97,000 --> 0:09:32,000
with our glaciers melting rapidly,

163
0:09:33.67,000 --> 0:09:34,000
the region is not just sick --

164
0:09:35.535,000 --> 0:09:36,000
it is crying out for help.

165
0:09:39.81,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And how will it affect the rest of the world?

166
0:09:42.278,000 --> 0:09:46,000
One obvious scenario is the potential destabilization

167
0:09:46.688,000 --> 0:09:49,000
caused by tens of millions of climate refugees,

168
0:09:50.586,000 --> 0:09:53,000
who'll be forced to move because they have no or little water,

169
0:09:53.787,000 --> 0:09:55,000
or because their livelihoods have been destroyed

170
0:09:56.772,000 --> 0:09:57,000
by the melting of glaciers.

171
0:09:59.391,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Another scenario we can't take lightly

172
0:10:03.14,000 --> 0:10:05,000
is the potential of conflict over water

173
0:10:07.409,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and the political destabilization in a region that has three nuclear powers:

174
0:10:14.353,000 --> 0:10:18,000
China, India, Pakistan.

175
0:10:21.175,000 --> 0:10:26,000
I believe that the situation in our region is grave enough

176
0:10:26.463,000 --> 0:10:3,000
to warrant the creation of a new intergovernmental agency.

177
0:10:32.022,000 --> 0:10:35,000
So as a native from that part of the world,

178
0:10:35.901,000 --> 0:10:38,000
I want to propose here, today,

179
0:10:39.14,000 --> 0:10:42,000
the establishment of the Third Pole Council,

180
0:10:43.846,000 --> 0:10:46,000
a high-level, intergovernmental organization

181
0:10:47.366,000 --> 0:10:5,000
tasked with the singular responsibility

182
0:10:51.054,000 --> 0:10:54,000
of protecting the world's third-largest repository of ice.

183
0:10:55.72,000 --> 0:10:57,000
A Third Pole Council

184
0:10:57.872,000 --> 0:11:,000
would consist of all eight countries located in the region

185
0:11:01.843,000 --> 0:11:02,000
as member countries,

186
0:11:03.125,000 --> 0:11:05,000
as equal member countries,

187
0:11:05.787,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and could also include representative organizations

188
0:11:08.557,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and other countries who have vested interests in the region

189
0:11:12.335,000 --> 0:11:13,000
as non-voting members.

190
0:11:13.915,000 --> 0:11:15,000
But the big idea

191
0:11:15.993,000 --> 0:11:18,000
is to get all stakeholders together to work together.

192
0:11:19.58,000 --> 0:11:23,000
To work together to monitor the health of the glaciers;

193
0:11:24.148,000 --> 0:11:28,000
to work together to shape and implement policies to protect our glaciers,

194
0:11:29.052,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and, by extension,

195
0:11:30.827,000 --> 0:11:35,000
to protect the billions of people who depend on our glaciers.

196
0:11:37.602,000 --> 0:11:38,000
We have to work together,

197
0:11:40.783,000 --> 0:11:44,000
because thinking globally, acting locally ...

198
0:11:46.552,000 --> 0:11:47,000
does not work.

199
0:11:48.015,000 --> 0:11:49,000
We've tried that in Bhutan.

200
0:11:50.463,000 --> 0:11:54,000
We've made immense sacrifices to act locally ...

201
0:11:56.705,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and while individual localized efforts will continue to be important,

202
0:12:01.855,000 --> 0:12:04,000
they cannot stand up to the onslaught of climate change.

203
0:12:05.677,000 --> 0:12:08,000
To stand up to climate change, we must work together.

204
0:12:10.272,000 --> 0:12:13,000
We must think globally and act regionally.

205
0:12:15.017,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Our entire region must come together,

206
0:12:18.956,000 --> 0:12:19,000
to work together,

207
0:12:20.522,000 --> 0:12:21,000
to fight climate change together,

208
0:12:22.508,000 --> 0:12:24,000
to make our voices heard together.

209
0:12:27.751,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And that includes India and China.

210
0:12:32.836,000 --> 0:12:34,000
They must step up their game.

211
0:12:36.197,000 --> 0:12:4,000
They must take the ownership of the fight to protect our glaciers.

212
0:12:41.482,000 --> 0:12:44,000
And for that, these two countries, these two powerful giants,

213
0:12:44.568,000 --> 0:12:46,000
must reduce their own greenhouse gases,

214
0:12:48.646,000 --> 0:12:5,000
control their pollution, and lead the fight.

215
0:12:53.134,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Lead the global fight against climate change.

216
0:12:57.95,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And all that with a renewed sense of urgency.

217
0:13:00.91,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Only then -- and that, too, only maybe --

218
0:13:04.932,000 --> 0:13:05,000
will our region

219
0:13:06.832,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and other regions that depend on our glaciers

220
0:13:09.292,000 --> 0:13:13,000
have any chance to avoid major catastrophes.

221
0:13:15.554,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Time is running out.

222
0:13:18.257,000 --> 0:13:21,000
We must act together, now.

223
0:13:22.4,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Otherwise, the next time Nepal's cabinet meets on Mount Everest,

224
0:13:28.923,000 --> 0:13:3,000
that spectacular backdrop ...

225
0:13:32.534,000 --> 0:13:33,000
may look quite different.

226
0:13:37.316,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And if that happens,

227
0:13:40.031,000 --> 0:13:42,000
if our glaciers melt,

228
0:13:42.268,000 --> 0:13:45,000
rising sea levels could well drown the Maldives.

229
0:13:47.229,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And while they can hold their cabinet meetings underwater

230
0:13:51.575,000 --> 0:13:53,000
to send an SOS to the world,

231
0:13:54.25,000 --> 0:13:56,000
their country can keep existing

232
0:13:56.703,000 --> 0:14:,000
only if their islands keep existing.

233
0:14:03.256,000 --> 0:14:07,000
The Maldives are still distant, away.

234
0:14:09.09,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Their islands are distant from where I live.

235
0:14:13.927,000 --> 0:14:18,000
But now, I pay close attention to what happens out there.

236
0:14:21.259,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Thank you very much.

237
0:14:24.047,000 --> 0:14:28,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.963,000 --> 0:00:13,000
This is a play called "Sell/Buy/Date."

2
0:00:14.892,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It's my first since "Bridge and Tunnel," which I did on Broadway,

3
0:00:17.963,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and this one, I -- thank you --

4
0:00:21.333,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I've excerpted it just for you, so here we go.

5
0:00:29.763,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Right. Class, let's be absolutely certain

6
0:00:32.901,000 --> 0:00:36,000
all electronic devices are switched off before we begin.

7
0:00:38.268,000 --> 0:00:43,000
So class, hopefully you'll recognize what you just heard me say as the -- ?

8
0:00:43.985,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Very good, the cellular phone announcement.

9
0:00:47.199,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Right? This was also known as a mobile phone.

10
0:00:51.378,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So you'll remember, people of that era

11
0:00:53.607,000 --> 0:00:57,000
would have had an external electronic device, right,

12
0:00:58.483,000 --> 0:00:59,000
something like this,

13
0:01:00.434,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and they all would have carried one of these around with them,

14
0:01:03.37,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and amongst their biggest fears was the sheer mortification

15
0:01:06.749,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that one of these might ring at some inopportune moment.

16
0:01:10.139,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Right? So a bit of trivia about that era for you.

17
0:01:12.54,000 --> 0:01:14,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:15.1,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So the format of today's class is

19
0:01:17.851,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I will be presenting multiple BERT modules today

20
0:01:21.793,000 --> 0:01:23,000
from that period in history, right,

21
0:01:24.163,000 --> 0:01:26,000
so starting circa 2016.

22
0:01:26.973,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And remember, this was the very first year of the BERT program.

23
0:01:31.32,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So we've got quite a few of these to get through.

24
0:01:33.69,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Bear in mind, I will be living into various different bodies,

25
0:01:37.697,000 --> 0:01:38,000
different ages,

26
0:01:39.815,000 --> 0:01:42,000
also what were then called races, or ethnic groups,

27
0:01:43.403,000 --> 0:01:45,000
as you'll remember from Unit 1.

28
0:01:45.493,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And -- (Laughter) -- and along the gender continuum,

29
0:01:48.813,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I will be living into males as well.

30
0:01:51.321,000 --> 0:01:52,000
It was quite binary at that time.

31
0:01:52.991,000 --> 0:01:53,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:54.55,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Also, don't forget, we are reading the book module

33
0:01:57.867,000 --> 0:01:58,000
for next week's focus on gender.

34
0:01:59.842,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Now, I know some of you have requested the book in pill form.

35
0:02:03.885,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I know people still believe ingesting it is better for retention,

36
0:02:08.201,000 --> 0:02:13,000
but since we are trying to experience what our forebears did, right,

37
0:02:13.7,000 --> 0:02:18,000
let's please just consider doing the actual ocular reading, okay?

38
0:02:19.207,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And also, how many people have your emotional shunts engaged?

39
0:02:24.222,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Right. Please toggle them off. Okay?

40
0:02:26.916,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I know it's challenging, but I want you to be able to feel the entire

41
0:02:31.861,000 --> 0:02:32,000
natural emo range, all right?

42
0:02:33.719,000 --> 0:02:35,000
It is essential to this part of the syllabus.

43
0:02:37.888,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Yes, Macy?

44
0:02:39.756,000 --> 0:02:42,000
All right. I understand. If you're unwilling to --

45
0:02:43.627,000 --> 0:02:45,000
All right, well, we can discuss that after class.

46
0:02:45.996,000 --> 0:02:47,000
All right, we will discuss your concerns.

47
0:02:48.429,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Just relax. Nobody's died and gone to composting.

48
0:02:52.549,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Okay. After class. Okay? After class.

49
0:02:57.133,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Let's just get started, okay.

50
0:02:59.144,000 --> 0:03:05,000
This first subject identified as a middle-class homemaker.

51
0:03:05.552,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Remember, these early modules

52
0:03:07.851,000 --> 0:03:11,000
in these people's full identities were protected,

53
0:03:11.984,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and this allowed them to speak more freely on our topic,

54
0:03:15.2,000 --> 0:03:18,000
which for many of them was taboo.

55
0:03:20.11,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Okay honey, now, I'm ready when you are.

56
0:03:23.732,000 --> 0:03:26,000
No, sweetheart, I said, I'm ready when you are.

57
0:03:28.06,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I'm freezing.

58
0:03:30.061,000 --> 0:03:33,000
It's like a meat locker in here in this recording studio.

59
0:03:33.206,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I should have brought a shmata.

60
0:03:35.806,000 --> 0:03:38,000
All this fancy technology but they can't afford heat.

61
0:03:40.375,000 --> 0:03:43,000
What is he saying? I can't hear you!

62
0:03:43.678,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I can't hear you through the glass, honey!

63
0:03:46.557,000 --> 0:03:48,000
There you are in my ear.

64
0:03:49.32,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Oh, you can hear me?

65
0:03:51.92,000 --> 0:03:52,000
The whole time.

66
0:03:53.778,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Oh, yes, I am a little chilly.

67
0:03:57.98,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Yes, oh the cold is for the machines, the new technology. Okay.

68
0:04:03.553,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Yes, now remind me again, you're recording not only my voice but my feelings

69
0:04:09.304,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and my memories? Right.

70
0:04:12.414,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Yes, BERT, yes, I read about it.

71
0:04:14.433,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Bio-Empathetic Resonant Technology.

72
0:04:17.484,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Right, right, so people will be able to feel my experience

73
0:04:22.641,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and my memory? Okay.

74
0:04:24.543,000 --> 0:04:25,000
No, right, I'm ready.

75
0:04:25.958,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I just thought you were going to give me a test to see how my memory's doing.

76
0:04:30.055,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I was going to tell you you're too late, it's already bad news.

77
0:04:34.847,000 --> 0:04:36,000
No, no, go ahead, honey.

78
0:04:37.648,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Oh, that's the first question?

79
0:04:39.984,000 --> 0:04:42,000
What do I think of prostitution?

80
0:04:43.258,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Are you soliciting me, young man?

81
0:04:47.483,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I've heard of May-December romances, but what are you, about 20 years old?

82
0:04:53.102,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Eighteen? Eighteen years.

83
0:04:54.844,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I think I have candies in my purse older than 18 years old.

84
0:05:00.463,000 --> 0:05:01,000
(Laughter)

85
0:05:04.281,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I'm teasing you, sweetheart. No, I'm comfortable with any question.

86
0:05:09.94,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Sure. So about the prostitution -- oh, sex worker, sex worker.

87
0:05:15.951,000 --> 0:05:18,000
No, just in my day, they called it prostitution, not sex work.

88
0:05:19.92,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Oh, because it includes pornography also?

89
0:05:22.666,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Okay.

90
0:05:24.477,000 --> 0:05:26,000
No, well, I guess when I was a girl,

91
0:05:26.659,000 --> 0:05:28,000
we didn't really have a name for that either.

92
0:05:29.167,000 --> 0:05:34,000
We would have said dirty magazines, I suppose, or dirty movies.

93
0:05:34.902,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Well, it's not like what you have with the Internet.

94
0:05:38.13,000 --> 0:05:41,000
No, well, I don't mind sharing.

95
0:05:41.636,000 --> 0:05:45,000
My late husband and I, we were a very romantic couple.

96
0:05:47.898,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Lots of tenderness, you understand.

97
0:05:51.794,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Well, as you get older, you know, at one point I thought my husband

98
0:05:55.164,000 --> 0:05:59,000
might be helped by using some of the pills men can take,

99
0:06:01.317,000 --> 0:06:04,000
but he wasn't interested in those,

100
0:06:04.413,000 --> 0:06:1,000
so I thought, what about maybe watching an adult movie on the Internet?

101
0:06:10.474,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Just for inspiration, you understand.

102
0:06:13.908,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Well, at the time, neither of us were very good on the computer,

103
0:06:18.906,000 --> 0:06:2,000
so usually, if we needed help with the Internet,

104
0:06:21.619,000 --> 0:06:25,000
we would just call our children or our grandchildren,

105
0:06:26.597,000 --> 0:06:29,000
but obviously, in this case, that wasn't an option,

106
0:06:30.163,000 --> 0:06:35,000
so I thought, I'll have a look myself, just to see.

107
0:06:35.588,000 --> 0:06:37,000
How difficult could it be?

108
0:06:38.127,000 --> 0:06:41,000
You search for certain key words and you look --

109
0:06:41.76,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Oh wow is right, young man.

110
0:06:43.955,000 --> 0:06:45,000
You can't imagine what I saw.

111
0:06:46.672,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Well, first of all, I was just trying to find, you know, couples,

112
0:06:51.618,000 --> 0:06:53,000
normal couples making love,

113
0:06:55.303,000 --> 0:06:59,000
but this, so many people together at one time.

114
0:06:59.791,000 --> 0:07:02,000
You couldn't tell which part belonged to which body.

115
0:07:03.599,000 --> 0:07:07,000
How they even got the cameras to capture some of this, I couldn't tell you.

116
0:07:07.778,000 --> 0:07:11,000
But the one thing they didn't capture was making love.

117
0:07:14.658,000 --> 0:07:18,000
There was lots of making of something,

118
0:07:19.388,000 --> 0:07:23,000
but they took the love part right out of it, you know, the fun.

119
0:07:23.497,000 --> 0:07:26,000
It was all very extreme, you know?

120
0:07:27.421,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Like you would say, with the extreme sports.

121
0:07:31.149,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Lots of endurance,

122
0:07:34.778,000 --> 0:07:37,000
but never tenderness.

123
0:07:37.8,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So anyway, needless to say, that was $19.95 I'll never get back again,

124
0:07:44.116,000 --> 0:07:48,000
but it only showed up on the credit card as "entertainment services,"

125
0:07:48.945,000 --> 0:07:5,000
so my husband was never the wiser,

126
0:07:51.732,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and after all of that,

127
0:07:55.133,000 --> 0:07:57,000
well, you could say it turned out

128
0:07:57.572,000 --> 0:08:,000
he didn't need the extra inspiration after all.

129
0:08:03.152,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Right, so next subject is a young woman -- (Applause) --

130
0:08:07.924,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Next subject, class, is a young woman called Bella,

131
0:08:10.957,000 --> 0:08:13,000
a university student interviewed in 2016

132
0:08:14.904,000 --> 0:08:17,000
during what was called an Intro to Feminist Porn class

133
0:08:18.828,000 --> 0:08:22,000
as part of her major in sex work at a college in the Bay Area.

134
0:08:23.317,000 --> 0:08:26,000
(Laughter)

135
0:08:26.672,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Yeah, I just want to, like, get a recording of, like,

136
0:08:29.439,000 --> 0:08:31,000
you guys recording me,

137
0:08:31.808,000 --> 0:08:33,000
like a meta recording, or whatever.

138
0:08:34.887,000 --> 0:08:37,000
It's just like this whole experience is just, like, really amazing,

139
0:08:38.611,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and I'd like to capture that for, like, Instagram and my Tumblr.

140
0:08:42.131,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So, like, hi guys, it's me, Bella,

141
0:08:45.126,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and I am, like, being interviewed right now

142
0:08:49.723,000 --> 0:08:54,000
for this, like, really amazing Bio-Empathetic Resonance Technology,

143
0:08:55.505,000 --> 0:09:01,000
which is, like, basically where they are, like, recording, as you can see

144
0:09:01.78,000 --> 0:09:02,000
from these, whatever, like, electrodes,

145
0:09:03.702,000 --> 0:09:08,000
the formation of, like, neuropeptides in my hippocampus, or whatever.

146
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
They will later be able to reconstitute these

147
0:09:12.92,000 --> 0:09:17,000
as, like, my own actual memory, like actual experiences,

148
0:09:19.54,000 --> 0:09:23,000
so other people can, like, actually feel what I'm feeling right now.

149
0:09:24.32,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Okay. Okay.

150
0:09:26.572,000 --> 0:09:31,000
So, like, hello, BERT person of the future who is experiencing me.

151
0:09:32.75,000 --> 0:09:35,000
This is what it feels like to be, like, a college freshman,

152
0:09:36.557,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and also the, like, headache that you are experiencing through me

153
0:09:41.781,000 --> 0:09:47,000
is the, like, residual effect of the Jell-O shots which I had last night

154
0:09:48.2,000 --> 0:09:5,000
at the bi-weekly feminist pole dancing party

155
0:09:51.115,000 --> 0:09:54,000
which I cohost on Wednesdays.

156
0:09:54.157,000 --> 0:09:57,000
It's called "Don't Get All Pole-emical" -- (Laughter) --

157
0:09:57.779,000 --> 0:10:,000
and it's in Beekman Hall,

158
0:10:02.072,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and, what else, like,

159
0:10:04.25,000 --> 0:10:08,000
non-Jell-O shots are also available for vegans,

160
0:10:08.297,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and, oh, okay, yeah, totally, yeah, we should also focus on your questions also.

161
0:10:17.98,000 --> 0:10:21,000
So for your record, I am, like, a sex work studies major

162
0:10:22.182,000 --> 0:10:24,000
but minoring in social media

163
0:10:24.457,000 --> 0:10:26,000
with a concentration on notable YouTube memes.

164
0:10:27.151,000 --> 0:10:29,000
(Laughter)

165
0:10:30.239,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Yes, well, of course, like, I consider myself to be, like,

166
0:10:33.49,000 --> 0:10:35,000
obviously, like, a feminist.

167
0:10:35.579,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I was named for Bella Abzug, who was, like, a famous, like,

168
0:10:40.571,000 --> 0:10:42,000
feminist from history,

169
0:10:42.986,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and, like, also I feel that it is, like, important to, like, represent women

170
0:10:49.255,000 --> 0:10:52,000
who are, like, sex-positive feminists.

171
0:10:54.224,000 --> 0:10:56,000
What is sex-negative?

172
0:10:56.941,000 --> 0:11:,000
Well, like, I guess I would ask, like, what do you think

173
0:11:01.399,000 --> 0:11:04,000
sex-negative is? (Laughter)

174
0:11:04.417,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Yeah, because, like, the terms that we use are, like, so important, because, like,

175
0:11:09.314,000 --> 0:11:16,000
we call it sex work because it helps people understand that, like, it's work,

176
0:11:16.352,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and, like, you know, just like there are, like, healthcare providers

177
0:11:21.228,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and, like, insurance providers,

178
0:11:23.712,000 --> 0:11:28,000
like, we think of these workers as, like, sex care providers.

179
0:11:30.511,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Yeah, but like, I don't think of myself like, providing direct

180
0:11:34.184,000 --> 0:11:38,000
sex care services per se as, like, being a requirement

181
0:11:38.433,000 --> 0:11:4,000
for me to be, like, an advocate.

182
0:11:40.894,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Like, I support other women's right to choose it voluntarily, like,

183
0:11:44.563,000 --> 0:11:46,000
if they enjoy it.

184
0:11:46.676,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Yeah, but, like, I see myself going forward

185
0:11:49.509,000 --> 0:11:52,000
as more likely, like, protecting sex workers',

186
0:11:53.247,000 --> 0:11:56,000
like, legal freedoms and rights.

187
0:11:56.288,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Yeah, so, like, basically, I'm planning on becoming a lawyer.

188
0:12:02.133,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Right, class. (Laughter) (Applause)

189
0:12:03.835,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So these next two modules are also circa 2016.

190
0:12:07.921,000 --> 0:12:1,000
One subject is an Irishwoman with a particularly noteworthy

191
0:12:11.915,000 --> 0:12:13,000
relationship to this issue,

192
0:12:14.847,000 --> 0:12:17,000
but first will be a West Indian woman,

193
0:12:18.509,000 --> 0:12:2,000
a self-described escort

194
0:12:20.831,000 --> 0:12:25,000
who was recorded at a sex workers' rights rally and parade.

195
0:12:26.241,000 --> 0:12:3,000
She was interviewed whilst marching in full carnival headdress

196
0:12:30.792,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and very little else.

197
0:12:36.295,000 --> 0:12:38,000
All right, you want me to start talking now.

198
0:12:38.379,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Yeah, I told you, you can put those wires anywhere you want to

199
0:12:41.509,000 --> 0:12:44,000
as long as it don't get in the way.

200
0:12:45.164,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Yeah, no, but, tell me again what the name of -- BERT? BERT.

201
0:12:50.069,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Yeah, I was telling you, you know, I think I have in all my time

202
0:12:53.108,000 --> 0:12:56,000
I have had at least one client with that name, so this won't be the first time

203
0:12:56.797,000 --> 0:12:58,000
I had BERT all over me.

204
0:13:03.905,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Oh, I'm sorry,

205
0:13:05.218,000 --> 0:13:08,000
but you got to get into the spirit of it if you're going to interview me.

206
0:13:08.67,000 --> 0:13:09,000
All right? You can say it.

207
0:13:10.536,000 --> 0:13:12,000
No justice, no piece! No justice, no piece!

208
0:13:12.934,000 --> 0:13:17,000
But you see the sign? You get it? P-I-E-C-E. No justice, no piece of us.

209
0:13:18.878,000 --> 0:13:19,000
You understand?

210
0:13:20.79,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Right, so that's the part where I was telling you

211
0:13:23.244,000 --> 0:13:27,000
is that when I first came to this country, I worked every job I could find.

212
0:13:27.609,000 --> 0:13:31,000
I was a nanny; I was a home care attendant for all these different old people,

213
0:13:32.299,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and then I said, child, if I have to touch another white man's backside,

214
0:13:36.422,000 --> 0:13:38,000
I might as well get paid a lot more money for it than this,

215
0:13:39.381,000 --> 0:13:4,000
you understand?

216
0:13:41.285,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Pshh, you know how hard it is being a domestic worker?

217
0:13:44.98,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Some of these men, they're heavy.

218
0:13:46.729,000 --> 0:13:48,000
You have to pick them up and flip them over.

219
0:13:49.528,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Now, I let them pick me up and flip me over, you understand?

220
0:13:53.986,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Well, you have to have a sense of humor about it, that's what I think.

221
0:13:57.399,000 --> 0:13:58,000
No, but see, listen,

222
0:13:59.349,000 --> 0:14:02,000
you find me somebody who don't hate some part of their job.

223
0:14:02.739,000 --> 0:14:04,000
I mean, there's a lot of things about this job that I hate,

224
0:14:05.502,000 --> 0:14:06,000
but the money is not one of them,

225
0:14:07.072,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and I will tell you, as long as this is the best possibility

226
0:14:09.891,000 --> 0:14:1,000
for me to make real money,

227
0:14:11.655,000 --> 0:14:15,000
I am going to be Jamaican-No-Fakin' if that's what they want to call me.

228
0:14:15.811,000 --> 0:14:18,000
No, I'm not even from Jamaica. That's how they market me.

229
0:14:19.318,000 --> 0:14:22,000
My family is from Trinidad and the Virgin Islands.

230
0:14:23.495,000 --> 0:14:25,000
They don't know what I do, but you know what?

231
0:14:25.711,000 --> 0:14:28,000
My children, they know that their school fees are paid,

232
0:14:28.977,000 --> 0:14:3,000
they have their books and their computer,

233
0:14:31.484,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and this way, I know that they have a chance.

234
0:14:34.456,000 --> 0:14:36,000
So I'm not going to tell you that what I do, it's easy,

235
0:14:37.266,000 --> 0:14:4,000
I'm not going to tell you that I feel -- what's that you said, liberated?

236
0:14:42.128,000 --> 0:14:44,000
But I'm going to tell you that I feel paid.

237
0:14:46.12,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Right. (Applause)

238
0:14:50.872,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Thanks, that's lovely, and just the cup of tea, love,

239
0:14:53.496,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and just a splash of the whiskey.

240
0:14:55.47,000 --> 0:14:59,000
It's perfect, that's grand. Just a drop more. A splash. Perfect.

241
0:15:00.2,000 --> 0:15:03,000
What was your name? Peter? Is that right, so, Peter?

242
0:15:03.55,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Right. So that, that is the unique part of it for me,

243
0:15:06.708,000 --> 0:15:08,000
right, is that I ended up in both,

244
0:15:10.681,000 --> 0:15:13,000
first in the convent, and then in the prostitution after. That's right.

245
0:15:14.55,000 --> 0:15:15,000
(Laughter)

246
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
So one woman at the university here in Dublin, she wrote about me.

247
0:15:20.12,000 --> 0:15:25,000
She said, Maureen Fitzroy is the living embodiment of the whore-virgin dichotomy.

248
0:15:25.82,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Right? (Laughter)

249
0:15:27.341,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Doesn't it sound like something you need to go into hospital?

250
0:15:30.359,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Well, I've got this terrible dichotomy.

251
0:15:32.248,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Doesn't it.

252
0:15:33.781,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Right. Well, for me though, it was, as a girl, it started with me dad.

253
0:15:37.119,000 --> 0:15:4,000
I mean, half the time, when he spoke to us, it was just a sort of

254
0:15:40.394,000 --> 0:15:44,000
tell us we were all useless rotten idiots and we had no morals, that type of thing.

255
0:15:44.856,000 --> 0:15:47,000
And I certainly didn't do myself any favors.

256
0:15:48.177,000 --> 0:15:5,000
By the time I was 16,

257
0:15:50.406,000 --> 0:15:52,000
I had started messing about with this older fella,

258
0:15:53.285,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and he wanted it to be our little secret,

259
0:15:56.837,000 --> 0:15:58,000
and I did as I was told, didn't I,

260
0:15:59.345,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and when that got back to me dad, he had me sent straightaway to the convent.

261
0:16:06.752,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Well no, that older fella, he would still come to find me in the convent.

262
0:16:11.17,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Yeah, he'd leave me notes

263
0:16:12.766,000 --> 0:16:15,000
tucked into the holes in the brick at the back of the charity shop

264
0:16:16.001,000 --> 0:16:17,000
so we could meet.

265
0:16:17.188,000 --> 0:16:2,000
And he'd tell me how he's leaving his wife,

266
0:16:20.915,000 --> 0:16:24,000
and I believed him, until I got pregnant.

267
0:16:25.141,000 --> 0:16:3,000
I did, Peter, and I left him a note about it in our special place there,

268
0:16:30.458,000 --> 0:16:33,000
and I never did hear from him again.

269
0:16:33.477,000 --> 0:16:38,000
No, I gave it up for adoption so it could have a decent life,

270
0:16:39.07,000 --> 0:16:41,000
and then they wouldn't let me back into the convent.

271
0:16:42.815,000 --> 0:16:45,000
No, my one sister Virginia gave me a fiver for the coach to Dublin,

272
0:16:46.273,000 --> 0:16:47,000
and that's how I ended up here.

273
0:16:48.991,000 --> 0:16:52,000
Well, surprise, surprise, I fell in love with another fella much older than me,

274
0:16:53.12,000 --> 0:16:58,000
and I always say I was just so happy because he didn't drink,

275
0:16:59.349,000 --> 0:17:01,000
I married the bastard.

276
0:17:02.502,000 --> 0:17:05,000
Well, he didn't drink, but he did have just the wee heroin problem, didn't he,

277
0:17:06.184,000 --> 0:17:09,000
and -- That's right, and before I knew it,

278
0:17:09.279,000 --> 0:17:12,000
he was the one who turned me on to the prostitution, my own husband.

279
0:17:13.703,000 --> 0:17:15,000
He had me supporting the both of us.

280
0:17:15.771,000 --> 0:17:16,000
I was 18.

281
0:17:18.144,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Well, it wasn't Pretty Woman, I can tell you that.

282
0:17:22.509,000 --> 0:17:23,000
That Julia Roberts,

283
0:17:25.566,000 --> 0:17:29,000
if she'd ever had to sleep with a man to put a few pounds in her pocket,

284
0:17:29.569,000 --> 0:17:31,000
I don't think she'd ever have made that film.

285
0:17:32.11,000 --> 0:17:34,000
Well, for your record,

286
0:17:34.339,000 --> 0:17:37,000
my opinion of the legalization, I'd say I'm against it.

287
0:17:38.62,000 --> 0:17:4,000
I just, I don't care what these young girls say.

288
0:17:40.864,000 --> 0:17:43,000
You know, living like that, you're just lost,

289
0:17:43.975,000 --> 0:17:45,000
and, you know, I'm 63 years old.

290
0:17:46.483,000 --> 0:17:48,000
I'm still trying to find who I am.

291
0:17:49.503,000 --> 0:17:52,000
You know, I never was a wife or a nun,

292
0:17:53.24,000 --> 0:17:56,000
or a prostitute even, really, not really.

293
0:17:56.56,000 --> 0:17:59,000
Nobody ever asked who I wanted to be.

294
0:17:59.648,000 --> 0:18:,000
They just told me,

295
0:18:01.482,000 --> 0:18:02,000
and if you legalize it,

296
0:18:03.433,000 --> 0:18:06,000
then you're really telling these girls, "Go on and get lost for a living,"

297
0:18:07.264,000 --> 0:18:09,000
and a lot of them, they'll do as they're told.

298
0:18:10.612,000 --> 0:18:15,000
All right, so four perspectives from four quite -- (Applause) --

299
0:18:15.669,000 --> 0:18:17,000
four quite different voices there, right?

300
0:18:17.829,000 --> 0:18:21,000
One woman saying sex itself is natural but the sex industry seems to

301
0:18:22.786,000 --> 0:18:24,000
mechanize or industrialize it.

302
0:18:24.794,000 --> 0:18:28,000
Then the second woman considered sex work to be empowering,

303
0:18:29.162,000 --> 0:18:32,000
liberating, and feminist, though she, herself, notably,

304
0:18:32.991,000 --> 0:18:34,000
did not seem keen to do it.

305
0:18:35.568,000 --> 0:18:39,000
The third woman, who actually was a so-called sex worker

306
0:18:39.995,000 --> 0:18:42,000
did not agree that it was liberating but she wanted the right

307
0:18:43.34,000 --> 0:18:44,000
to the economic empowerment,

308
0:18:45.1,000 --> 0:18:48,000
and then we hear the fourth woman saying not only prostitution itself

309
0:18:48.412,000 --> 0:18:5,000
but proscribed roles for women in general

310
0:18:50.938,000 --> 0:18:53,000
prevented her from ever finding who she was, right?

311
0:18:54.398,000 --> 0:18:55,000
So another fact most people did not know

312
0:18:56.395,000 --> 0:19:01,000
was the average age of an at-risk girl being introduced to the sex industry

313
0:19:02.08,000 --> 0:19:04,000
was 12 or 13.

314
0:19:04.11,000 --> 0:19:07,000
Also consider that the age when all girls in that society

315
0:19:07.146,000 --> 0:19:1,000
first became exposed to sexualized images of women

316
0:19:10.791,000 --> 0:19:12,000
was quite a bit earlier, right?

317
0:19:13.345,000 --> 0:19:17,000
This was a doll called Barbie, right?

318
0:19:18.105,000 --> 0:19:21,000
I initially thought she was an educational tool for anorexia prevention --

319
0:19:21.692,000 --> 0:19:22,000
(Laughter) --

320
0:19:22.842,000 --> 0:19:25,000
but actually she was considered by many

321
0:19:26.209,000 --> 0:19:3,000
to be a wholesome symbol of femininity,

322
0:19:30.272,000 --> 0:19:33,000
and often young girls began what was called dieting.

323
0:19:33.615,000 --> 0:19:37,000
Remember this? This was restricting food intake on purpose

324
0:19:37.854,000 --> 0:19:38,000
by the age of six,

325
0:19:39.234,000 --> 0:19:41,000
and defining themselves based on attractiveness

326
0:19:42.061,000 --> 0:19:43,000
by around that same time. Right?

327
0:19:43.901,000 --> 0:19:44,000
Yes?

328
0:19:45.712,000 --> 0:19:47,000
Right, Bradley, okay, excellent point.

329
0:19:47.756,000 --> 0:19:51,000
So there was a lucrative market in that society in convincing all people

330
0:19:52.585,000 --> 0:19:55,000
they had to look a certain way to even have a sex life, right?

331
0:19:56.463,000 --> 0:20:01,000
But girls, especially, were expected to be "sexy" while avoiding

332
0:20:01.618,000 --> 0:20:04,000
being perceived as "sluts" for being sexual. Right?

333
0:20:04.97,000 --> 0:20:06,000
So there's that shame piece we've heard about.

334
0:20:07.237,000 --> 0:20:08,000
Yes.

335
0:20:08.839,000 --> 0:20:09,000
Valerie, right? Okay, very good.

336
0:20:10.696,000 --> 0:20:12,000
Of course, men were having sex as well,

337
0:20:13.506,000 --> 0:20:15,000
but you'll remember from the reading,

338
0:20:15.944,000 --> 0:20:16,000
what were male sluts called?

339
0:20:18.675,000 --> 0:20:19,000
Very good, they were called men.

340
0:20:20.541,000 --> 0:20:22,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

341
0:20:22.747,000 --> 0:20:27,000
So not easy living in a world like that, right?

342
0:20:28.859,000 --> 0:20:29,000
Though it was not all bad news either.

343
0:20:30.711,000 --> 0:20:33,000
Most women in the early 2000s considered themselves empowered,

344
0:20:34.217,000 --> 0:20:38,000
and men generally felt they were also evolved in this area,

345
0:20:38.45,000 --> 0:20:4,000
and, in fact, most people would have been aware of issues

346
0:20:41.3,000 --> 0:20:42,000
like human trafficking, for example,

347
0:20:43.235,000 --> 0:20:45,000
but they would have seen that as quite separate

348
0:20:45.636,000 --> 0:20:47,000
from more recreational adult entertainment.

349
0:20:48.427,000 --> 0:20:51,000
And so we'll just very briefly, class -- we don't have a lot of time --

350
0:20:51.85,000 --> 0:20:53,000
we'll just very briefly hear from a man

351
0:20:54.065,000 --> 0:20:55,000
on our topic at this stage.

352
0:20:55.839,000 --> 0:21:,000
So this next subject was interviewed on the night of his bachelor party.

353
0:21:03.426,000 --> 0:21:06,000
Dude, can you, all right, can you just keep it down?

354
0:21:06.979,000 --> 0:21:08,000
I'm trying to talk to BERT right now.

355
0:21:09.185,000 --> 0:21:1,000
Oh, your name's not BERT.

356
0:21:11.298,000 --> 0:21:13,000
BERT's the name of the, oh, all right.

357
0:21:13.573,000 --> 0:21:16,000
No, no, no, totally, it's totally fine. I'm mostly sober,

358
0:21:16.638,000 --> 0:21:18,000
so I just want to be helpful.

359
0:21:20.073,000 --> 0:21:23,000
Yeah, and I totally believe in causes, yeah, like, all that stuff.

360
0:21:23.892,000 --> 0:21:24,000
(Laughter)

361
0:21:25.332,000 --> 0:21:27,000
And actually, I'm wearing Toms right now.

362
0:21:28.954,000 --> 0:21:31,000
Yeah, Toms, like, the shoes,

363
0:21:32.56,000 --> 0:21:35,000
like, you buy a pair and then a kid in Africa gets clean water.

364
0:21:36.857,000 --> 0:21:37,000
Yeah. Totally.

365
0:21:38.394,000 --> 0:21:4,000
But what was the question again? Sorry.

366
0:21:41.181,000 --> 0:21:45,000
Of course I believe in women's rights. I'm marrying a woman.

367
0:21:45.889,000 --> 0:21:47,000
(Laughter)

368
0:21:48.389,000 --> 0:21:51,000
No, but I mean, like, just because I'm in a strip club parking lot

369
0:21:52.018,000 --> 0:21:55,000
doesn't mean that I'm, like, a sexist or whatever.

370
0:21:55.042,000 --> 0:21:59,000
My fiancee is totally amazing, she's totally a strong girl, woman,

371
0:21:59.454,000 --> 0:22:01,000
smart woman, like, the whole thing.

372
0:22:01.949,000 --> 0:22:04,000
Yeah, she knows I'm here. She's probably at a strip club herself right now,

373
0:22:05.518,000 --> 0:22:06,000
like, as a joke, same as me.

374
0:22:07.51,000 --> 0:22:09,000
My best man, I told him he could surprise me,

375
0:22:09.602,000 --> 0:22:1,000
and he thought this would be hilarious,

376
0:22:11.597,000 --> 0:22:13,000
but this is not something.

377
0:22:14.35,000 --> 0:22:16,000
Yeah, we all went to B school together.

378
0:22:17.06,000 --> 0:22:18,000
Wharton.

379
0:22:18.54,000 --> 0:22:19,000
(Laughter)

380
0:22:19.724,000 --> 0:22:21,000
Yeah, so, dude, can you guys --

381
0:22:22.171,000 --> 0:22:23,000
All right, but it's my bachelor party,

382
0:22:24.087,000 --> 0:22:27,000
and I can spend it in the parking lot with Anderson Cooper if I want to.

383
0:22:27.595,000 --> 0:22:29,000
All right, I'll see you in there.

384
0:22:31.076,000 --> 0:22:33,000
All right, okay, so Anderson,

385
0:22:33.214,000 --> 0:22:36,000
so, like, first of all, stripping,

386
0:22:37.111,000 --> 0:22:39,000
but then, like, all the other things you're talking about,

387
0:22:39.895,000 --> 0:22:42,000
prostitution and all that stuff, that's, like, not the same thing at all.

388
0:22:43.403,000 --> 0:22:46,000
You know? Like, you keep calling it the sex industry or whatever,

389
0:22:46.659,000 --> 0:22:49,000
but it's like, if the girl wants to be an exotic dancer

390
0:22:50.605,000 --> 0:22:53,000
and she's 18, like, that's her right.

391
0:22:55.092,000 --> 0:22:58,000
Whoa, whoa, I hear what you're saying, but I just feel like people,

392
0:22:58.34,000 --> 0:23:01,000
they just want to make it seem like all dudes are just, like, predators,

393
0:23:01.976,000 --> 0:23:04,000
that we would just automatically go to a prostitute, or whatever.

394
0:23:05.114,000 --> 0:23:09,000
Even, like, when I pledged, you know, like when I rushed my fraternity.

395
0:23:10.35,000 --> 0:23:12,000
My brothers who I'm close to, those guys, they're all like me.

396
0:23:13.337,000 --> 0:23:16,000
We're just normal people, but, like, there's this myth that you must

397
0:23:17.29,000 --> 0:23:21,000
be that guy who is kind of an asshole, and like, all bros before hos or whatever.

398
0:23:21.928,000 --> 0:23:24,000
And actually, like, bros before hos, it doesn't mean like what it sounds like.

399
0:23:26.603,000 --> 0:23:29,000
It's actually just like a joking way of saying that you care about your brothers

400
0:23:30.38,000 --> 0:23:32,000
and you put them first.

401
0:23:33.466,000 --> 0:23:35,000
Yeah, but, you can't blame the media, either.

402
0:23:35.576,000 --> 0:23:37,000
I mean, like, if you go watch "Hangover 2,"

403
0:23:38.11,000 --> 0:23:4,000
and you think that's an instruction manual

404
0:23:40.264,000 --> 0:23:42,000
for your life, like, I don't know what to tell you.

405
0:23:42.8,000 --> 0:23:44,000
You know? You don't watch "Bourne Identity"

406
0:23:44.862,000 --> 0:23:48,000
and go drive your car over a gondola in Venice. (Laughter)

407
0:23:49.736,000 --> 0:23:51,000
Well, yeah, okay, like, if you're a little kid or whatever,

408
0:23:52.672,000 --> 0:23:54,000
of course it's different, but --

409
0:23:54.876,000 --> 0:23:57,000
Yeah, all right, I remember one thing like that.

410
0:23:59.38,000 --> 0:24:02,000
I was at this kid's house one time playing GTA,

411
0:24:03.28,000 --> 0:24:04,000
uh, Grand Theft Auto?

412
0:24:05.417,000 --> 0:24:07,000
Dude, are you from Canada? (Laughter)

413
0:24:09.593,000 --> 0:24:12,000
So, like, whatever, with Grand Theft Auto,

414
0:24:12.986,000 --> 0:24:15,000
you're this kid, like, you're this guy walking around or whatever,

415
0:24:16.16,000 --> 0:24:18,000
and you can basically, like, the more cops you kill,

416
0:24:19.092,000 --> 0:24:21,000
the more points you get, and stuff like that.

417
0:24:21.763,000 --> 0:24:23,000
But also, you can find prostitutes

418
0:24:24.601,000 --> 0:24:27,000
and obviously you can do sexual stuff with them,

419
0:24:27.798,000 --> 0:24:3,000
but you can, like, kill them and take your money back.

420
0:24:32.525,000 --> 0:24:35,000
Yeah, this kid, I remember he ran over a couple of them a few times with his car

421
0:24:36.466,000 --> 0:24:38,000
and he got all these points.

422
0:24:39.32,000 --> 0:24:41,000
We were, like, 10, I think.

423
0:24:43.685,000 --> 0:24:45,000
It felt pretty terrible, actually.

424
0:24:46.827,000 --> 0:24:51,000
No, I don't think I said anything, I just finished playing and went home.

425
0:24:52.845,000 --> 0:24:54,000
All right class, so then there were men who had more than just

426
0:24:55.77,000 --> 0:24:57,000
a passing relationship to this issue. (Laughter)

427
0:24:59.955,000 --> 0:25:03,000
The next subject described himself as a reformed and remorseful pimp

428
0:25:04.88,000 --> 0:25:05,000
turned motivational speaker,

429
0:25:06.526,000 --> 0:25:08,000
life coach and therapist,

430
0:25:08.964,000 --> 0:25:11,000
but if you want to know more about him, you'll have to come to the entire play.

431
0:25:12.934,000 --> 0:25:15,000
Thank you so much, you beautiful TED audience.

432
0:25:16.92,000 --> 0:25:17,000
I will see you for "Sell/Buy/Date."

433
0:25:18.716,000 --> 0:25:23,000
(Applause)

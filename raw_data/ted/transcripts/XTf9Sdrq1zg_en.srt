1
0:00:13.658,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Imagine a place where your neighbors greet your children by name;

2
0:00:19.628,000 --> 0:00:22,000
a place with splendid vistas;

3
0:00:22.955,000 --> 0:00:25,000
a place where you can drive just 20 minutes

4
0:00:26.09,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and put your sailboat on the water.

5
0:00:28.68,000 --> 0:00:3,000
It's a seductive place, isn't it?

6
0:00:32.261,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I don't live there.

7
0:00:33.881,000 --> 0:00:35,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:36.454,000 --> 0:00:42,000
But I did journey on a 27,000-mile trip

9
0:00:42.497,000 --> 0:00:48,000
for two years, to the fastest-growing and whitest counties in America.

10
0:00:50.732,000 --> 0:00:51,000
What is a Whitopia?

11
0:00:52.82,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I define Whitopia in three ways:

12
0:00:55.999,000 --> 0:01:01,000
First, a Whitopia has posted at least six percent population growth since 2000.

13
0:01:03.451,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Secondly, the majority of that growth comes from white migrants.

14
0:01:08.415,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And third, the Whitopia has an ineffable charm,

15
0:01:12.239,000 --> 0:01:14,000
a pleasant look and feel,

16
0:01:14.818,000 --> 0:01:15,000
a je Ne sais quoi.

17
0:01:16.35,000 --> 0:01:19,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:19.583,000 --> 0:01:23,000
To learn how and why Whitopias are ticking,

19
0:01:23.999,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I immersed myself for several months apiece in three of them:

20
0:01:29.446,000 --> 0:01:31,000
first, St. George, Utah;

21
0:01:32.12,000 --> 0:01:34,000
second, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho;

22
0:01:34.581,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and third, Forsyth County, Georgia.

23
0:01:38.883,000 --> 0:01:43,000
First stop, St. George -- a beautiful town of red rock landscapes.

24
0:01:44.433,000 --> 0:01:49,000
In the 1850s, Brigham Young dispatched families to St. George

25
0:01:49.81,000 --> 0:01:52,000
to grow cotton because of the hot, arid climate.

26
0:01:53.118,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And so they called it Utah's Dixie, and the name sticks to this day.

27
0:02:00.368,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I approached my time in each Whitopia like an anthropologist.

28
0:02:05.354,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I made detailed spreadsheets of all the power brokers in the communities,

29
0:02:09.999,000 --> 0:02:12,000
who I needed to meet, where I needed to be,

30
0:02:13.457,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and I threw myself with gusto in these communities.

31
0:02:16.699,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I went to zoning board meetings,

32
0:02:18.999,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I went to Democratic clubs and Republican clubs.

33
0:02:22.786,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I went to poker nights.

34
0:02:27.206,000 --> 0:02:31,000
In St. George, I rented a home at the Entrada,

35
0:02:32.142,000 --> 0:02:35,000
one of the town's premier gated communities.

36
0:02:35.278,000 --> 0:02:39,000
There were no Motel 6's or Howard Johnsons for me.

37
0:02:39.62,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I lived in Whitopia as a resident, and not like a visitor.

38
0:02:44.883,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I rented myself this home by phone.

39
0:02:49.409,000 --> 0:02:51,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:51.972,000 --> 0:02:52,000
(Applause)

41
0:02:53.361,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Golf is the perfect seductive symbol of Whitopia.

42
0:02:59.75,000 --> 0:03:,000
When I went on my journey,

43
0:03:01.584,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I had barely ever held a golf club.

44
0:03:04.723,000 --> 0:03:08,000
By the time I left, I was golfing at least three times a week.

45
0:03:09.422,000 --> 0:03:11,000
(Laughter)

46
0:03:12.133,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Golf helps people bond.

47
0:03:15.093,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Some of the best interviews I ever scored during my trip were on the golf courses.

48
0:03:21.716,000 --> 0:03:26,000
One venture capitalist, for example, invited me to golf in his private club

49
0:03:27.199,000 --> 0:03:29,000
that had no minority members.

50
0:03:30.933,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I also went fishing.

51
0:03:32.432,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Laughter)

52
0:03:34.457,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Because I had never fished, this fellow had to teach me

53
0:03:37.497,000 --> 0:03:39,000
how to cast my line and what bait to use.

54
0:03:42.55,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I also played poker every weekend.

55
0:03:45.845,000 --> 0:03:47,000
It was Texas Hold 'em with a $10 buy-in.

56
0:03:50.058,000 --> 0:03:54,000
My poker mates may have been bluffing about the hands that they drew,

57
0:03:54.341,000 --> 0:03:57,000
but they weren't bluffing about their social beliefs.

58
0:03:57.547,000 --> 0:04:,000
Some of the most raw, salty conversations I ever had

59
0:04:01.174,000 --> 0:04:03,000
during my journey were at the poker table.

60
0:04:04.951,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I'm a gung ho entertainer.

61
0:04:08.14,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I love to cook, I hosted many dinner parties, and in return,

62
0:04:12.14,000 --> 0:04:15,000
people invited me to their dinner parties,

63
0:04:15.312,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and to their barbecues, and to their pool parties,

64
0:04:17.994,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and to their birthday parties.

65
0:04:21.385,000 --> 0:04:22,000
But it wasn't all fun.

66
0:04:23.781,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Immigration turned out to be a big issue in this Whitopia.

67
0:04:28.167,000 --> 0:04:31,000
The St. George's Citizens Council on Illegal Immigration

68
0:04:31.605,000 --> 0:04:35,000
held regular and active protests against immigration,

69
0:04:35.723,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and so what I gleaned from this Whitopia is what a hot debate this would become.

70
0:04:41.648,000 --> 0:04:44,000
It was a real-time preview, and so it has become.

71
0:04:47.084,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Next stop: Almost Heaven, a cabin I rented for myself

72
0:04:52.451,000 --> 0:04:55,000
in Coeur d'Alene, in the beautiful North Idaho panhandle.

73
0:04:57.048,000 --> 0:05:,000
I rented this place for myself, also by phone.

74
0:05:00.095,000 --> 0:05:01,000
(Laughter)

75
0:05:02.53,000 --> 0:05:06,000
The book "A Thousand Places To See Before You Die" lists Coeur d'Alene --

76
0:05:07.374,000 --> 0:05:11,000
it's a gorgeous paradise for huntsmen, boatmen and fishermen.

77
0:05:13.031,000 --> 0:05:16,000
My growing golf skills came in handy in Coeur d'Alene.

78
0:05:16.088,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I golfed with retired LAPD cops.

79
0:05:19.714,000 --> 0:05:24,000
In 1993, around 11,000 families and cops

80
0:05:25.248,000 --> 0:05:31,000
fled Los Angeles after the L.A. racial unrest,

81
0:05:31.382,000 --> 0:05:35,000
for North Idaho, and they've built an expatriated community.

82
0:05:36.809,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Given the conservatism of these cops,

83
0:05:39.846,000 --> 0:05:44,000
there's no surprise that North Idaho has a strong gun culture.

84
0:05:45.212,000 --> 0:05:5,000
In fact, it is said, North Idaho has more gun dealers than gas stations.

85
0:05:53.677,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So what's a resident to do to fit in?

86
0:05:56.837,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I hit the gun club.

87
0:05:58.942,000 --> 0:06:01,000
When I rented a gun, the gentleman behind the counter

88
0:06:02.361,000 --> 0:06:04,000
was perfectly pleasant and kind,

89
0:06:04.999,000 --> 0:06:06,000
until I showed him my New York City driver's license.

90
0:06:08.999,000 --> 0:06:09,000
That's when he got nervous.

91
0:06:11.767,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I'm not as bad a shot as I thought I might have been.

92
0:06:16.448,000 --> 0:06:22,000
What I learned from North Idaho is the peculiar brand of paranoia

93
0:06:22.928,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that can permeate a community when so many cops and guns are around.

94
0:06:30.07,000 --> 0:06:34,000
In North Idaho, in my red pickup truck,

95
0:06:34.801,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I kept a notepad.

96
0:06:36.7,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And in that notepad I counted more Confederate flags than black people.

97
0:06:41.589,000 --> 0:06:44,000
In North Idaho, I found Confederate flags

98
0:06:44.876,000 --> 0:06:48,000
on key chains, on cellphone paraphernalia,

99
0:06:49.125,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and on cars.

100
0:06:51.78,000 --> 0:06:54,000
About a seven-minute drive from my hidden lake cabin

101
0:06:55.249,000 --> 0:06:57,000
was the compound of Aryan Nations,

102
0:06:58.09,000 --> 0:06:59,000
the white supremacist group.

103
0:07:02.384,000 --> 0:07:07,000
America's Promise Ministries, the religious arm of Aryan Nations,

104
0:07:07.48,000 --> 0:07:11,000
happened to have a three-day retreat during my visit.

105
0:07:12.913,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So I decided to crash it.

106
0:07:14.572,000 --> 0:07:16,000
(Laughter)

107
0:07:17.208,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I'm the only non-Aryan journalist I'm aware of ever to have done so.

108
0:07:22.067,000 --> 0:07:23,000
(Laughter)

109
0:07:23.153,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Among the many memorable episodes of that retreat...

110
0:07:27.79,000 --> 0:07:28,000
(Laughter)

111
0:07:29.083,000 --> 0:07:32,000
...is when Abe, an Aryan, sidled up next to me.

112
0:07:32.999,000 --> 0:07:37,000
He slapped my knee, and he said, "Hey Rich, I just want you to know one thing.

113
0:07:38.443,000 --> 0:07:42,000
We are not white supremacists. We are white separatists.

114
0:07:42.967,000 --> 0:07:43,000
We don't think we're better than you,

115
0:07:44.865,000 --> 0:07:45,000
we just want to be away from you."

116
0:07:46.578,000 --> 0:07:5,000
(Laughter)

117
0:07:51.016,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Indeed, most white people in Whitopia are neither white supremacists

118
0:07:58.035,000 --> 0:07:59,000
or white separatists;

119
0:07:59.874,000 --> 0:08:02,000
in fact, they're not there for explicitly racial reasons at all.

120
0:08:04.14,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Rather, they emigrate there

121
0:08:07.22,000 --> 0:08:1,000
for friendliness, comfort, security, safety --

122
0:08:10.952,000 --> 0:08:14,000
reasons that they implicitly associate to whiteness in itself.

123
0:08:17.064,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Next stop was Georgia.

124
0:08:20.224,000 --> 0:08:24,000
In Georgia, I stayed in an exurb north of Atlanta.

125
0:08:25.027,000 --> 0:08:26,000
In Utah, I found poker;

126
0:08:26.846,000 --> 0:08:27,000
in Idaho, I found guns;

127
0:08:28.561,000 --> 0:08:29,000
in Georgia, I found God.

128
0:08:30.139,000 --> 0:08:31,000
(Laughter)

129
0:08:31.402,000 --> 0:08:34,000
The way that I immersed myself in this Whitopia

130
0:08:34.999,000 --> 0:08:37,000
was to become active at First Redeemer Church,

131
0:08:38.414,000 --> 0:08:41,000
a megachurch that's so huge that it has golf carts

132
0:08:41.942,000 --> 0:08:46,000
to escort the congregants around its many parking lots on campus.

133
0:08:47.758,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I was active in the youth ministry.

134
0:08:50.491,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And for me, personally, I was more comfortable in this Whitopia

135
0:08:55.447,000 --> 0:08:59,000
than say, in a Colorado, or an Idaho, or even a suburban Boston.

136
0:09:00.999,000 --> 0:09:03,000
That is because [there], in Georgia,

137
0:09:04.113,000 --> 0:09:08,000
white people and black people are more historically familiar to one another.

138
0:09:09.092,000 --> 0:09:11,000
I was less exotic in this Whitopia.

139
0:09:11.912,000 --> 0:09:13,000
(Laughter)

140
0:09:14.684,000 --> 0:09:15,000
But what does it all mean?

141
0:09:17.042,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Whitopian dreaming, Whitopia migration, is a push-pull phenomenon,

142
0:09:22.447,000 --> 0:09:26,000
full of alarming pushes and alluring pulls,

143
0:09:26.612,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and Whitopia operates at the level of conscious and unconscious bias.

144
0:09:33.86,000 --> 0:09:38,000
It's possible for people to be in Whitopia not for racist reasons,

145
0:09:39.287,000 --> 0:09:41,000
though it has racist outcomes.

146
0:09:43.704,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Many Whitopians feel pushed by illegals,

147
0:09:47.572,000 --> 0:09:52,000
social welfare abuse, minorities, density, crowded schools.

148
0:09:53.113,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Many Whitopians feel pulled by merit,

149
0:09:58.316,000 --> 0:10:03,000
freedom, the allure of privatism -- privatized places, privatized people,

150
0:10:04.104,000 --> 0:10:05,000
privatized things.

151
0:10:07.524,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And I learned in Whitopia how a country can have racism

152
0:10:13.136,000 --> 0:10:14,000
without racists.

153
0:10:15.241,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Many of my smug urban liberal friends

154
0:10:18.052,000 --> 0:10:2,000
couldn't believe I would go on such a venture.

155
0:10:21.447,000 --> 0:10:26,000
The reality is that many white Americans are affable and kind.

156
0:10:27.643,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Interpersonal race relations -- how we treat each other as human beings --

157
0:10:32.436,000 --> 0:10:35,000
are vastly better than in my parents' generation.

158
0:10:37.162,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Can you imagine me going to Whitopia 40 years ago?

159
0:10:41.596,000 --> 0:10:42,000
What a journey that would have been.

160
0:10:43.508,000 --> 0:10:44,000
(Laughter)

161
0:10:45.29,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And yet, some things haven't changed.

162
0:10:47.572,000 --> 0:10:53,000
America is as residentially and educationally segregated today

163
0:10:54.307,000 --> 0:10:56,000
as it was in 1970.

164
0:10:59.523,000 --> 0:11:03,000
As Americans, we often find ways to cook for each other,

165
0:11:04.178,000 --> 0:11:05,000
to dance with each other,

166
0:11:05.822,000 --> 0:11:06,000
to host with each other,

167
0:11:07.719,000 --> 0:11:12,000
but why can't that translate into how we treat each other as communities?

168
0:11:13.235,000 --> 0:11:15,000
It's a devastating irony,

169
0:11:15.379,000 --> 0:11:18,000
how we have gone forward as individuals,

170
0:11:18.715,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and backwards as communities.

171
0:11:23.766,000 --> 0:11:27,000
One of the Whitopian outlooks that really hit me

172
0:11:28.083,000 --> 0:11:3,000
was a proverbial saying:

173
0:11:30.279,000 --> 0:11:33,000
"One black man is a delightful dinner guest;

174
0:11:33.779,000 --> 0:11:35,000
50 black men is a ghetto."

175
0:11:40.879,000 --> 0:11:46,000
One of the big contexts animating my Whitopian journey was the year 2042.

176
0:11:48.668,000 --> 0:11:54,000
By 2042, white people will no longer be the American majority.

177
0:11:55.45,000 --> 0:11:58,000
As such, will there be more Whitopias?

178
0:12:00.926,000 --> 0:12:01,000
In looking at this,

179
0:12:02.637,000 --> 0:12:08,000
the danger of Whitopia is that the more segregation we have,

180
0:12:09.368,000 --> 0:12:14,000
the less we can look at and confront conscious and unconscious bias.

181
0:12:18.304,000 --> 0:12:22,000
I ventured on my two-year, 27,000 mile journey

182
0:12:22.689,000 --> 0:12:27,000
to learn where, why, and how white people are fleeing,

183
0:12:27.8,000 --> 0:12:29,000
but I didn't expect to have so much fun on my journey.

184
0:12:30.566,000 --> 0:12:31,000
(Laughter)

185
0:12:31.597,000 --> 0:12:33,000
I didn't expect to learn so much about myself.

186
0:12:35.408,000 --> 0:12:38,000
I don't expect I'll be living in a Whitopia --

187
0:12:38.88,000 --> 0:12:4,000
or a Blacktopia, for that matter.

188
0:12:41.792,000 --> 0:12:44,000
I do plan to continue golfing every chance I get.

189
0:12:45.225,000 --> 0:12:46,000
(Laughter)

190
0:12:46.811,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And I'll just have to leave the guns and megachurches back in Whitopia.

191
0:12:52.714,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Thank you.

192
0:12:53.89,000 --> 0:12:59,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:19.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
It is interesting that in the United States,

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
the most significant health-care budget

3
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
goes to cardiovascular disease care, whether it's private or public.

4
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
There's no comparison at all.

5
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
In Africa -- where it is a major killer -- it is totally ignored.

6
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And that situation cannot be right. We must do something about it.

7
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
A health status of a nation parallels development of that nation.

8
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
17 million people die every year from heart disease.

9
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
32 million heart attacks and strokes occur.

10
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Most of this is in developing countries, and the majority is in Africa.

11
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
85 percent of global disease burden for cardiovascular disease

12
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
is in developing countries -- not in the West --

13
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and yet 90 percent of the resources are in the West.

14
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Who is at risk? People like you.

15
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
It's not just the Africans that should be concerned about that.

16
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
All friends of Africa, that will have reason to be in Africa at some point in time,

17
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
should be very concerned about this deplorable situation.

18
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Has anyone here wondered what will happen

19
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
if you go back to your room at night,

20
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and you start getting chest pains, shortness of breath, sweating?

21
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
You're having a heart attack. What are you going to do?

22
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Will you fly back to the U.S., Germany, Europe?

23
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
No, you will die. 50 percent will die within 24 hours, if not treated.

24
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
This is what's going on.

25
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
In a look at the map of the U.S. -- the graph here,

26
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
10 million people here, 10 million here.

27
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
By the time you get to 50, it's almost no one left in Nigeria --

28
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
life expectancy is 47.

29
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
It's not because some people don't survive childhood illnesses --

30
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
they do -- but they do not survive after the time that they reach

31
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
about 45 years old and 50 years old.

32
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And those are the times they're most productive.

33
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Those are the times that they should be contributing

34
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
to Africa's development. But they're not there.

35
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
The best way to spiral into a cycle of poverty is to kill the parents.

36
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
If you cannot secure the parents,

37
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
you cannot guarantee the security of the African child.

38
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
What are the risk factors?

39
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
It's very well known. I'm not going to spend a lot of time on those.

40
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
These are just for information:

41
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
hypertension, diabetes, obesity, lack of exercise. The usual suspects.

42
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Right here in Tanzania, 30 percent of individuals have hypertension.

43
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
20 percent are getting treated.

44
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Only less than one percent are adequately treated.

45
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
If we can treat hypertension alone in Africa,

46
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
we'll save 250,000 lives a year. That's quite significant!

47
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Easy to treat. Look at the situation in Mauritius.

48
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
In eight short years -- we're here talking about HIV, malaria,

49
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
which is all good.

50
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
We cannot make the mistakes we've made with malaria and HIV.

51
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
In eight short years, non-communicable diseases

52
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
will become the leading causes of death in Africa.

53
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
That is something to keep in mind. We can't deal with it with situations like this.

54
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
This is a typical African hospital. We can't depend on the elites --

55
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
they go to USA, Germany, U.K. for treatment. Unbelievable.

56
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
You can't depend on foreign aid alone.

57
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Here is the situation: countries are turning inwards.

58
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Post-9/11, [the] United States has had a lot of trouble

59
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
to deal with, their own internal issues.

60
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So, they spend their money trying to fix those problems.

61
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
You can't rightly -- it's not their responsibility,

62
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
it is my responsibility. I have to take care of my own problems.

63
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
If they help, that's good! But that is not my expectation.

64
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
These worsening indices of health care or health studies in Africa

65
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
demand a new look. We cannot keep on doing things

66
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
the way we've always done them.

67
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
If they have not worked, we have to look for alternative solutions.

68
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I'm here to talk to you about solutions.

69
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:33,000
This has been -- what has been a difficult sign to some of us.

70
0:04:33.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Several years ago, we started thinking about it.

71
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Everyone knows the problem. No one knows what the solutions are.

72
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
We decided that we needed to put our money where our mouth is.

73
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Everyone is ready to throw in money,

74
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
in terms of free money aid to developing countries.

75
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Talk about sustainable investment, no one is interested.

76
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
You can't raise money.

77
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
I have done businesses in healthcare in the United States --

78
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I live in Nashville, Tennessee, health care capital of America.

79
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
[It's] very easy to raise money for health-care ventures.

80
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
But start telling them, you know,

81
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
we're going to try to do it in Nigeria -- everyone runs away.

82
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
That is totally wrong. Those of you in the audience here,

83
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
if you want to help Africa, invest money in sustainable development.

84
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Let me lead you through a day in the life of the Heart Institute,

85
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
so you get a glimpse of what we do,

86
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and I'll talk a little bit more about it.

87
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
What we have done is to show that high-quality health care,

88
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
comparable to the best anywhere in the world,

89
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
can be done in a developing country environment.

90
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
We have 25 positions right now -- all of them trained,

91
0:06:44.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
board certified in the USA, Canada or Britain.

92
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
We have every modality that can be done in Vanderbilt,

93
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Cleveland Clinic -- everywhere in the U.S. --

94
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and we do it for about 10 percent of the cost

95
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
that you will need to do those things in the United States.

96
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
(Applause)

97
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Additionally, we have a policy

98
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
that no one is ever turned away because of ability to pay.

99
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We take care of everyone.

100
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
(Applause)

101
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Whether you have one dollar, two dollars -- it doesn't matter.

102
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And I will tell you how we're able to do it.

103
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
We make sure that we select our equipment properly.

104
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
We go for modular units. Units that have multi-modality functions

105
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
have modular components. Easy to repair, and because of that,

106
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
we do not take things that are not durable and cannot last.

107
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
We emphasize training,

108
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and we make sure that this process is regenerative.

109
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Very soon we will all be dead and gone, but the problems will stay,

110
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
unless we have people taking over from where we stopped.

111
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
We made sure that we produced some things ourselves.

112
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:57,000
We do not buy unit doses of radiopharmaceuticals.

113
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
We get the generators from the companies.

114
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
We manufacture them in-house, ourselves. That keeps the costs down.

115
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
So, for a radiopharmaceutical in the U.S. --

116
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that you'll get a unit dose for 250 dollars --

117
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
when we're finished manufacturing it in-house,

118
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
we come at a price of about two dollars.

119
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
(Applause)

120
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
We recognize that the only way to bridge the gap

121
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
between the rich and poor countries

122
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
is through education and technology.

123
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
All these problems we're talking about --

124
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
if we bring development, they will all disappear.

125
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Technology is a great equalizer. How do we make it work?

126
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:39,000
It's been proved: self-care is cost-effective.

127
0:08:39.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
It extends opportunity to the rural centers,

128
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and we can use expertise in a very smart way.

129
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
This is the way our centers are set up.

130
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
We currently have three locations in the Caribbean,

131
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and we're planning a fourth one.

132
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And we have now decided to go into Africa.

133
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
We will be doing the West African Heart Institute

134
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. That project will be starting

135
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
within the next few months. We hope to open in 2008-09.

136
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And we will do other centers.

137
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
This model can be adapted to every disease process.

138
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
All the units, all the centers, are linked

139
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
through a switched hub to a central server,

140
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and all the images are populated to review stations.

141
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And we designed this telemedicine solution. It's proprietary to us,

142
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and we are happy to share what we have learned with anyone

143
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
who is interested in doing it. You can still be profitable.

144
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
We make sure that the telemedicine platform gives access

145
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
to expert medical specialists anywhere in the world,

146
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
just by a click of the button.

147
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
I'll lead you through, to see how this happens.

148
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
This is at the Heart Institute. The doctors from anywhere can log in.

149
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
I can call you in Switzerland and say, "Listen, go into our system.

150
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Look at Mrs. Jones. Look at the study, tell me what you think."

151
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
They'll give me that information,

152
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and we'll make the care of the patient better.

153
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
The patient doesn't have to travel.

154
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
He doesn't have to experience the anxiety of not knowing

155
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
because of limited expertise.

156
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
We also use [an] electronic medical record system.

157
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
I'm happy to say that the things we have implemented --

158
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
80 percent of U.S. practices do not have them, and yet the technology is there.

159
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
But you know, they have that luxury.

160
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Because if you can't get it in Nashville, you can travel to Birmingham,

161
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
two hours away, and you'll get it. If you can't get it in Cleveland,

162
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:42,000
you can go to Cincinnati. We don't have that luxury,

163
0:10:42.33,000 --> 0:10:44,000
so we have to make it happen.

164
0:10:44.33,000 --> 0:10:48,000
When we do it, we will put the cost of care down.

165
0:10:48.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And we'll extend it to the rural centers and make it affordable.

166
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And everyone will get the care they deserve.

167
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
It cannot just be technology, we recognize that.

168
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Prevention must be part of the solution -- we emphasize that.

169
0:11:03.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
But, you know, you have to tell people what can be done.

170
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
It's not possible to tell people to do what is going to be expensive,

171
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and they go home and can't do it.

172
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
They need to be alive, they need to feed.

173
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
We recommend exercise as the most effective, simple, easy thing to do.

174
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
We have had walks every year -- every March, April.

175
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:3,000
We form people into groups and make them go into challenges.

176
0:11:30.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Which group loses the most weight, we give them prizes.

177
0:11:33.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Which groups record more walking distance by pedometer,

178
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
we give them prizes. We do this constantly.

179
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:42,000
We encourage them to bring children.

180
0:11:42.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
That way we start exposing the children from very early on,

181
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
on what these issues are. Because once they learn it,

182
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
they will stay with it. In doing this we have created

183
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:56,000
at least 100 skilled jobs in Jamaica alone,

184
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
and these are physicians with expertise and special training.

185
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
We have taken care of over 1,000 indigent patients that could have died,

186
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
including four free pacemakers in patients

187
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
with complete heart block. For those that understand cardiology,

188
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
complete heart block means certain death.

189
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
If you don't get this pacemaker, you will be dead.

190
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:17,000
So we are pleased with that.

191
0:12:17.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Indirectly, we have saved the government of Jamaica five million dollars

192
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
from people that would have gone to Miami or Atlanta for care.

193
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And we've hopefully saved a lot of lives.

194
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
By the end of this year, we would have contributed over one million dollars

195
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
in indigent care. In the first four months, it's been 340,000 dollars,

196
0:12:38.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
averaging 85,000 dollars a month. The government will not do that,

197
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
because they have competing needs.

198
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
They need to put resources elsewhere. But we can still do it.

199
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
People say, "How can you do that?" This is how we can do that.

200
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:58,000
At least 4,000 rich Jamaicans that were heading to Miami for treatment

201
0:12:58.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
have self-confessed that they did not go to Miami

202
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
because of the Heart Institute of the Caribbean.

203
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And, if they went to Miami, they will spend significantly more --

204
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
eight to 10 times more. And they feel happy spending it at home,

205
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:16,000
getting the same quality of care.

206
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And for that money -- for every one patient that has the money to pay,

207
0:13:22.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
it gives us an opportunity to take care of at least four people

208
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
that do not have the resources to pay.

209
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
(Applause)

210
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
For this to work, this progress must be sustainable.

211
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:39,000
So, we emphasize training. Training is critical.

212
0:13:39.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
We have gone further: we have formed a relationship

213
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
with the University of Technology, Jamaica,

214
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
where I now have an appointment.

215
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And we are starting a biomedical engineering program,

216
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:55,000
so that we will train people locally, who can repair that equipment.

217
0:13:55.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
That way we're not going to deal with obsolescence and all those kinds of issues.

218
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
We're also starting ancillary health-care technology training programs --

219
0:14:04.33,000 --> 0:14:08,000
training people in echocardiography, cardiac ultrasound,

220
0:14:08.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
those kinds of things. Now, with that kind of training,

221
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:13,000
it gives people motivation.

222
0:14:13.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Because now they will get a bachelors degree in medical imaging

223
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and all that kind of stuff. In the process, I want you to just hear

224
0:14:22.33,000 --> 0:14:26,000
from the trainees themselves what it has meant for them.

225
0:14:26.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
(Video) Dr. Jason Topping: My name is Jason Topping.

226
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
I'm a senior resident in anesthesia in intensive care

227
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:33,000
at the University Hospital of the West Indies.

228
0:14:33.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
I came to the Heart Institute in 2006,

229
0:14:36.33,000 --> 0:14:41,000
as part of my elective in my anesthesia and intensive care program.

230
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
I spent three months at the Heart Institute.

231
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:46,000
There's been no doubt around my colleagues

232
0:14:46.33,000 --> 0:14:49,000
about the utility of the training I received here,

233
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and I think there's been an increased interest now in --

234
0:14:54.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
particularly in echocardiography and its use in our setting.

235
0:14:58.33,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Sharon Lazarus: I am an echocardiographer at the Heart Institute of the Caribbean,

236
0:15:03.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
since the past two years. I received training at this institution.

237
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:13,000
I think this aspect of training in cardiology

238
0:15:13.33,000 --> 0:15:17,000
that the Heart Institute of the Caribbean has introduced in Jamaica

239
0:15:17.33,000 --> 0:15:26,000
is very important in terms of diagnosing cardiac diseases.

240
0:15:26.33,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Ernest Madu: The lesson in this is that it can be done, and it can be sustained,

241
0:15:31.33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
and you can make it possible for everyone.

242
0:15:35.33,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Who are we to decide that poor people cannot get the best care?

243
0:15:39.33,000 --> 0:15:43,000
When have you been appointed to play God?

244
0:15:43.33,000 --> 0:15:48,000
It is not my decision. My job is to make sure that every person,

245
0:15:48.33,000 --> 0:15:53,000
no matter what fate has assigned to you, will have the opportunity

246
0:15:53.33,000 --> 0:15:56,000
to get the best quality health care in life.

247
0:15:56.33,000 --> 0:16:,000
Next stop is West African Heart Institute,

248
0:16:00.33,000 --> 0:16:03,000
that we are going to be doing in Port Harcourt, Nigeria,

249
0:16:03.33,000 --> 0:16:07,000
as I said before. We will do other centers across West Africa.

250
0:16:07.33,000 --> 0:16:12,000
We will extend the same system into other areas,

251
0:16:12.33,000 --> 0:16:13,000
like dialysis treatment.

252
0:16:13.33,000 --> 0:16:17,000
And anyone who is interested in doing it in any health care situation,

253
0:16:17.33,000 --> 0:16:22,000
we will be happy to assist you and tell you how we've done it,

254
0:16:22.33,000 --> 0:16:26,000
and how you can do it. If we do this,

255
0:16:26.33,000 --> 0:16:3,000
we can change the face of health care in Africa.

256
0:16:30.33,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Africa has been good to us; it is time for us to give back to Africa.

257
0:16:34.33,000 --> 0:16:37,000
I am going. Those who want to come,

258
0:16:37.33,000 --> 0:16:39,000
I welcome you to come along with me.

259
0:16:39.33,000 --> 0:16:41,000
Thank you.

260
0:16:41.33,000 --> 0:16:45,000
(Applause)

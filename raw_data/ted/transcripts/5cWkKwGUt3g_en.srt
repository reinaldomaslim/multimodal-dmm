1
0:00:12.375,000 --> 0:00:14,000
My name is Jon Gray.

2
0:00:14.417,000 --> 0:00:15,000
They call me "The Dishwasher."

3
0:00:17.583,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I cofounded Ghetto Gastro,

4
0:00:20.125,000 --> 0:00:22,000
a Bronx-based collective

5
0:00:22.292,000 --> 0:00:26,000
that works at the intersection of food, design and art.

6
0:00:27.75,000 --> 0:00:32,000
We create experiences that challenge people's perceptions of the Bronx,

7
0:00:33.417,000 --> 0:00:34,000
the place that I call home.

8
0:00:37.875,000 --> 0:00:38,000
It's a funny thing.

9
0:00:39.625,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I just touched down in Vancouver from Paris a few days ago.

10
0:00:43.625,000 --> 0:00:47,000
We took over the Place Vendôme with the Bronx Brasserie.

11
0:00:48.042,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Oui oui, chérie.

12
0:00:50.25,000 --> 0:00:53,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:53.958,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It's wild, because in Paris, they have this saying,

14
0:00:56.833,000 --> 0:00:57,000
"le Bronx,"

15
0:00:58.333,000 --> 0:01:03,000
which means something is in disarray or a problem.

16
0:01:03.542,000 --> 0:01:04,000
That's the Place Vendôme.

17
0:01:05.125,000 --> 0:01:06,000
We shut it down one time.

18
0:01:06.583,000 --> 0:01:08,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:08.667,000 --> 0:01:11,000
This lingo came into play when the Bronx was burning,

20
0:01:12.583,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and movies like "The Warriors" and "Fort Apache"

21
0:01:16.042,000 --> 0:01:17,000
still make an impression.

22
0:01:18.5,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Some may disagree,

23
0:01:20.375,000 --> 0:01:22,000
but I believe the Bronx was designed to fail.

24
0:01:24.458,000 --> 0:01:26,000
The power broker was a joker.

25
0:01:28.042,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Robert Moses, instead of parting the Red Sea,

26
0:01:31.917,000 --> 0:01:33,000
he parted the Bronx with a six-lane highway

27
0:01:34.542,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and redlined my community.

28
0:01:37.375,000 --> 0:01:39,000
My great-grandparents had a home on Featherbed Lane,

29
0:01:41.125,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and contrary to the name,

30
0:01:42.917,000 --> 0:01:44,000
they couldn't get a good night's rest

31
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:48,000
due to the constant blasting and drilling that was necessary

32
0:01:48.875,000 --> 0:01:5,000
to build the cross-Bronx expressway

33
0:01:51.375,000 --> 0:01:52,000
a block away.

34
0:01:53.125,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I consider these policy decisions

35
0:01:56.333,000 --> 0:01:57,000
design crimes.

36
0:01:58.292,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Applause)

37
0:02:02.542,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Being the resilient people that we are uptown,

38
0:02:05.667,000 --> 0:02:07,000
out of the systematic oppression

39
0:02:08.583,000 --> 0:02:13,000
hip-hop culture rose from the rubble and the ashes like a phoenix.

40
0:02:14.542,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Hip-hop is now a trillion-dollar industry,

41
0:02:17.167,000 --> 0:02:2,000
but this economic activity doesn't make it back to the Bronx

42
0:02:20.542,000 --> 0:02:21,000
or communities like it.

43
0:02:23.542,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Let's take it back to 1986.

44
0:02:26.5,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I was born in the heart of the AIDS crisis,

45
0:02:29.417,000 --> 0:02:3,000
the crack epidemic

46
0:02:31.208,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and the War on Drugs.

47
0:02:33.833,000 --> 0:02:37,000
The only thing that trickled down from Reaganomics was ghettonomics:

48
0:02:38.625,000 --> 0:02:42,000
pain, prison and poverty.

49
0:02:44.292,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I was raised by brilliant, beautiful and accomplished black women.

50
0:02:50.708,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Even so, my pops wasn't in the picture,

51
0:02:54.125,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and I couldn't resist the allure of the streets.

52
0:02:57.625,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Like Biggie said,

53
0:02:59.083,000 --> 0:03:02,000
you're either slinging crack rock or you got a wicked jump shot.

54
0:03:03.875,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Don't get it twisted, my jumper was wet.

55
0:03:06.5,000 --> 0:03:08,000
(Laughter)

56
0:03:08.583,000 --> 0:03:09,000
My shit was wet.

57
0:03:09.875,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Applause)

58
0:03:13.833,000 --> 0:03:15,000
But when I turned 15, I started selling weed,

59
0:03:16.792,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I didn't finish high school,

60
0:03:18.583,000 --> 0:03:21,000
the New York Board of Education banned me from all of those,

61
0:03:21.792,000 --> 0:03:24,000
but I did graduate to selling cocaine when I turned 18.

62
0:03:25.292,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I did well.

63
0:03:26.958,000 --> 0:03:3,000
That was until I got jammed up, caught a case, when I was 20.

64
0:03:31.917,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I was facing 10 years.

65
0:03:34.417,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I posted bail, signed up at the Fashion Institute,

66
0:03:38.542,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I applied the skills that I learned in the streets

67
0:03:40.958,000 --> 0:03:41,000
to start my own fashion brand.

68
0:03:42.833,000 --> 0:03:44,000
My lawyer peeked my ambition,

69
0:03:45.5,000 --> 0:03:48,000
so he suggested that the judge grant me a suspended sentence.

70
0:03:49.292,000 --> 0:03:51,000
For once in my life, a suspension was a good thing.

71
0:03:51.833,000 --> 0:03:53,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:55.292,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Over the course of two years and many court dates,

73
0:03:59.958,000 --> 0:04:,000
my case got dismissed.

74
0:04:02.667,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Both of my brothers have done jail time,

75
0:04:05.75,000 --> 0:04:08,000
so escaping the clutches of the prison industrial system

76
0:04:08.833,000 --> 0:04:1,000
didn't seem realistic to me.

77
0:04:10.875,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Right now, one of my brothers is facing 20 years.

78
0:04:15.042,000 --> 0:04:18,000
My mother put in great effort in taking me out to eat,

79
0:04:18.708,000 --> 0:04:2,000
making sure we visited museums

80
0:04:20.75,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and traveled abroad,

81
0:04:22.708,000 --> 0:04:24,000
basically exposing me to as much culture as she could.

82
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I remembered how as a kid,

83
0:04:29.75,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I used to take over the dinner table and order food for everybody.

84
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Breaking bread has always allowed me to break the mold

85
0:04:37.083,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and connect with people.

86
0:04:39.25,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Me and my homie Les,

87
0:04:40.625,000 --> 0:04:42,000
we grew up on the same block in the Bronx,

88
0:04:42.708,000 --> 0:04:43,000
two street dudes.

89
0:04:44.042,000 --> 0:04:45,000
He happened to be a chef.

90
0:04:45.375,000 --> 0:04:48,000
We always discussed the possibility of doing something in the food game

91
0:04:48.792,000 --> 0:04:49,000
for the benefit of our neighborhood.

92
0:04:51.083,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Les had just won the food show "Chopped."

93
0:04:54.667,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Our homie Malcolm was gearing up to run a pastry kitchen at Noma,

94
0:04:58.833,000 --> 0:05:,000
yeah, world's best Noma in Copenhagen, you know the vibes.

95
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:07,000
My man P had just finished training in I-I-Italy,

96
0:05:07.167,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Milano to be exact.

97
0:05:09.75,000 --> 0:05:12,000
We decided the world needed some Bronx steasoning on it,

98
0:05:13.125,000 --> 0:05:16,000
so we mobbed up and formed Ghetto Gastro.

99
0:05:16.875,000 --> 0:05:19,000
(Applause)

100
0:05:26.167,000 --> 0:05:29,000
While I'm aware our name makes a lot of people uncomfortable,

101
0:05:29.458,000 --> 0:05:3,000
for us "ghetto" means home.

102
0:05:31.583,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Similar to the way someone in Mumbai or Nairobi

103
0:05:34.875,000 --> 0:05:36,000
might use the word "slum,"

104
0:05:37.167,000 --> 0:05:38,000
it's to locate our people

105
0:05:38.875,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and to indict the systems of neglect that created these conditions.

106
0:05:43.542,000 --> 0:05:47,000
(Applause)

107
0:05:48.583,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So what is Ghetto Gastro?

108
0:05:50.542,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Ultimately, it's a movement and a philosophy.

109
0:05:54.333,000 --> 0:05:57,000
We view the work we do as gastrodiplomacy,

110
0:05:57.875,000 --> 0:05:59,000
using food and finesse

111
0:06:00.292,000 --> 0:06:02,000
to open borders and connect culture.

112
0:06:04.458,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Last year in Tokyo,

113
0:06:06.583,000 --> 0:06:09,000
we did a Caribbean patty,

114
0:06:09.833,000 --> 0:06:11,000
we do jerk wagyu beef,

115
0:06:12.25,000 --> 0:06:13,000
shio kombu.

116
0:06:13.708,000 --> 0:06:16,000
We remixed the Bronx classic with the Japanese elements.

117
0:06:18.875,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And for Kwanzaa,

118
0:06:20.625,000 --> 0:06:22,000
we had to pay homage to our Puerto Ricans,

119
0:06:23.625,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and we did a coconut charcoal cognac coquito. Dímelo!

120
0:06:30.833,000 --> 0:06:32,000
(Laughter)

121
0:06:33.625,000 --> 0:06:36,000
This here is our Black Power waffle

122
0:06:36.917,000 --> 0:06:39,000
with some gold leaf syrup.

123
0:06:40.75,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Make sure you don't slip on the drip.

124
0:06:42.625,000 --> 0:06:43,000
(Laughter)

125
0:06:44.542,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Here we got the 36 Brix plant-based velato.

126
0:06:49.292,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Strawberry fields, you know the deal.

127
0:06:53.292,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Compressed watermelon,

128
0:06:55.208,000 --> 0:06:56,000
basil seeds,

129
0:06:56.708,000 --> 0:06:58,000
a little bit of strawberries up there.

130
0:06:59.208,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Back to the Bronx Brasserie,

131
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:06,000
you know we had to hit them in the head with that caviar and cornbread.

132
0:07:06.625,000 --> 0:07:07,000
(Laughter)

133
0:07:08.417,000 --> 0:07:1,000
(Applause)

134
0:07:14.083,000 --> 0:07:16,000
We also practice du-rag diplomacy.

135
0:07:16.833,000 --> 0:07:17,000
(Laughter)

136
0:07:18.417,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Because, we don't edit who we are when we do our thing.

137
0:07:22.542,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Due to our appearance,

138
0:07:23.875,000 --> 0:07:25,000
we often get mistaken for rappers or athletes.

139
0:07:26.708,000 --> 0:07:28,000
It happened here last year at TED.

140
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:3,000
This dude ran down on me

141
0:07:30.667,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and asked me when I was going to perform.

142
0:07:33.458,000 --> 0:07:34,000
How about now?

143
0:07:34.917,000 --> 0:07:38,000
(Applause)

144
0:07:42.75,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So you see,

145
0:07:44.458,000 --> 0:07:46,000
we've been bringing the Bronx to the world

146
0:07:46.833,000 --> 0:07:48,000
but now we focus on bringing the world to the Bronx.

147
0:07:50.75,000 --> 0:07:51,000
We just opened our spot,

148
0:07:52.667,000 --> 0:07:53,000
an idea kitchen

149
0:07:54.5,000 --> 0:07:56,000
where we make and design products,

150
0:07:57.958,000 --> 0:07:58,000
create content --

151
0:07:59.417,000 --> 0:08:05,000
(Music)

152
0:08:12.083,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and host community events.

153
0:08:14.542,000 --> 0:08:16,000
The intention is to build financial capital

154
0:08:17.25,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and creative capital in our hood.

155
0:08:21.292,000 --> 0:08:23,000
We're also collaborating with world-renowned chef

156
0:08:23.625,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Massimo Bottura

157
0:08:26.25,000 --> 0:08:28,000
on a refettorio in the Bronx.

158
0:08:28.625,000 --> 0:08:32,000
A refettorio is a design-focused soup kitchen and community center.

159
0:08:33.458,000 --> 0:08:34,000
You see the vibes.

160
0:08:34.75,000 --> 0:08:37,000
(Applause)

161
0:08:40.917,000 --> 0:08:43,000
The recent outpouring of grief about the murder

162
0:08:44.167,000 --> 0:08:46,000
of rapper and entrepreneur Nipsey Hussle

163
0:08:47.125,000 --> 0:08:52,000
is largely due to the fact that he decided to stay and evolve in place,

164
0:08:52.375,000 --> 0:08:54,000
rather than leave his hood.

165
0:08:54.542,000 --> 0:08:57,000
After his death, some may see this decision as foolish,

166
0:08:57.792,000 --> 0:08:59,000
but I'm making that same decision every day:

167
0:09:00.333,000 --> 0:09:01,000
to live in the Bronx,

168
0:09:01.75,000 --> 0:09:02,000
to create in the Bronx,

169
0:09:03.333,000 --> 0:09:04,000
to invest in the Bronx.

170
0:09:05.333,000 --> 0:09:09,000
(Applause)

171
0:09:14.333,000 --> 0:09:16,000
At Ghetto Gastro, we don't run from the word "ghetto,"

172
0:09:17.208,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and we don't run from the ghetto.

173
0:09:19.583,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Because at the end of the day,

174
0:09:21.417,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Ghetto Gastro is about showing you what we already know:

175
0:09:24.667,000 --> 0:09:25,000
the hood

176
0:09:26.667,000 --> 0:09:27,000
is good.

177
0:09:28.583,000 --> 0:09:32,000
(Applause)

178
0:09:33.042,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Thank you.

179
0:09:34.667,000 --> 0:09:36,000
(Applause)

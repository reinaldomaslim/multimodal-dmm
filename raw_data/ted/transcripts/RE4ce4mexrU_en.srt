1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Imagine if you could record your life --

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
everything you said, everything you did,

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
available in a perfect memory store at your fingertips,

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
so you could go back

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and find memorable moments and relive them,

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
or sift through traces of time

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and discover patterns in your own life

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that previously had gone undiscovered.

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Well that's exactly the journey

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that my family began

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
five and a half years ago.

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
This is my wife and collaborator, Rupal.

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And on this day, at this moment,

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
we walked into the house with our first child,

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
our beautiful baby boy.

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And we walked into a house

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
with a very special home video recording system.

18
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
(Video) Man: Okay.

19
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Deb Roy: This moment

20
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and thousands of other moments special for us

21
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
were captured in our home

22
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
because in every room in the house,

23
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
if you looked up, you'd see a camera and a microphone,

24
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and if you looked down,

25
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
you'd get this bird's-eye view of the room.

26
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Here's our living room,

27
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
the baby bedroom,

28
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
kitchen, dining room

29
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and the rest of the house.

30
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And all of these fed into a disc array

31
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that was designed for a continuous capture.

32
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
So here we are flying through a day in our home

33
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
as we move from sunlit morning

34
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
through incandescent evening

35
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and, finally, lights out for the day.

36
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Over the course of three years,

37
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
we recorded eight to 10 hours a day,

38
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
amassing roughly a quarter-million hours

39
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
of multi-track audio and video.

40
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So you're looking at a piece of what is by far

41
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
the largest home video collection ever made.

42
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And what this data represents

44
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
for our family at a personal level,

45
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
the impact has already been immense,

46
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and we're still learning its value.

47
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Countless moments

48
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
of unsolicited natural moments, not posed moments,

49
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
are captured there,

50
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and we're starting to learn how to discover them and find them.

51
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
But there's also a scientific reason that drove this project,

52
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
which was to use this natural longitudinal data

53
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
to understand the process

54
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
of how a child learns language --

55
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that child being my son.

56
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And so with many privacy provisions put in place

57
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
to protect everyone who was recorded in the data,

58
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
we made elements of the data available

59
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
to my trusted research team at MIT

60
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
so we could start teasing apart patterns

61
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
in this massive data set,

62
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
trying to understand the influence of social environments

63
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
on language acquisition.

64
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
So we're looking here

65
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
at one of the first things we started to do.

66
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
This is my wife and I cooking breakfast in the kitchen,

67
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and as we move through space and through time,

68
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
a very everyday pattern of life in the kitchen.

69
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
In order to convert

70
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
this opaque, 90,000 hours of video

71
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
into something that we could start to see,

72
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
we use motion analysis to pull out,

73
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
as we move through space and through time,

74
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
what we call space-time worms.

75
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And this has become part of our toolkit

76
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
for being able to look and see

77
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
where the activities are in the data,

78
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and with it, trace the pattern of, in particular,

79
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
where my son moved throughout the home,

80
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
so that we could focus our transcription efforts,

81
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
all of the speech environment around my son --

82
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
all of the words that he heard from myself, my wife, our nanny,

83
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and over time, the words he began to produce.

84
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So with that technology and that data

85
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and the ability to, with machine assistance,

86
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
transcribe speech,

87
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
we've now transcribed

88
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
well over seven million words of our home transcripts.

89
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And with that, let me take you now

90
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
for a first tour into the data.

91
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So you've all, I'm sure,

92
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
seen time-lapse videos

93
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
where a flower will blossom as you accelerate time.

94
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I'd like you to now experience

95
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
the blossoming of a speech form.

96
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
My son, soon after his first birthday,

97
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
would say "gaga" to mean water.

98
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And over the course of the next half-year,

99
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
he slowly learned to approximate

100
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
the proper adult form, "water."

101
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So we're going to cruise through half a year

102
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
in about 40 seconds.

103
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
No video here,

104
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
so you can focus on the sound, the acoustics,

105
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
of a new kind of trajectory:

106
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
gaga to water.

107
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
(Audio) Baby: Gagagagagaga

108
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Gaga gaga gaga

109
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
guga guga guga

110
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
wada gaga gaga guga gaga

111
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
wader guga guga

112
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
water water water

113
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
water water water

114
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
water water

115
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
water.

116
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
DR: He sure nailed it, didn't he.

117
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
(Applause)

118
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So he didn't just learn water.

119
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Over the course of the 24 months,

120
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
the first two years that we really focused on,

121
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
this is a map of every word he learned in chronological order.

122
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And because we have full transcripts,

123
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
we've identified each of the 503 words

124
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that he learned to produce by his second birthday.

125
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
He was an early talker.

126
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And so we started to analyze why.

127
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Why were certain words born before others?

128
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
This is one of the first results

129
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that came out of our study a little over a year ago

130
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that really surprised us.

131
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
The way to interpret this apparently simple graph

132
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
is, on the vertical is an indication

133
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
of how complex caregiver utterances are

134
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
based on the length of utterances.

135
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And the [horizontal] axis is time.

136
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And all of the data,

137
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
we aligned based on the following idea:

138
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Every time my son would learn a word,

139
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
we would trace back and look at all of the language he heard

140
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
that contained that word.

141
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And we would plot the relative length of the utterances.

142
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And what we found was this curious phenomena,

143
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
that caregiver speech would systematically dip to a minimum,

144
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
making language as simple as possible,

145
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and then slowly ascend back up in complexity.

146
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And the amazing thing was

147
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
that bounce, that dip,

148
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
lined up almost precisely

149
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
with when each word was born --

150
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
word after word, systematically.

151
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So it appears that all three primary caregivers --

152
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
myself, my wife and our nanny --

153
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
were systematically and, I would think, subconsciously

154
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
restructuring our language

155
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
to meet him at the birth of a word

156
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and bring him gently into more complex language.

157
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And the implications of this -- there are many,

158
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
but one I just want to point out,

159
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
is that there must be amazing feedback loops.

160
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Of course, my son is learning

161
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
from his linguistic environment,

162
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
but the environment is learning from him.

163
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
That environment, people, are in these tight feedback loops

164
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and creating a kind of scaffolding

165
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
that has not been noticed until now.

166
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
But that's looking at the speech context.

167
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
What about the visual context?

168
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
We're not looking at --

169
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
think of this as a dollhouse cutaway of our house.

170
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
We've taken those circular fish-eye lens cameras,

171
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and we've done some optical correction,

172
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and then we can bring it into three-dimensional life.

173
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
So welcome to my home.

174
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
This is a moment,

175
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
one moment captured across multiple cameras.

176
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
The reason we did this is to create the ultimate memory machine,

177
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
where you can go back and interactively fly around

178
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and then breathe video-life into this system.

179
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
What I'm going to do

180
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
is give you an accelerated view of 30 minutes,

181
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
again, of just life in the living room.

182
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
That's me and my son on the floor.

183
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And there's video analytics

184
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
that are tracking our movements.

185
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
My son is leaving red ink. I am leaving green ink.

186
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
We're now on the couch,

187
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
looking out through the window at cars passing by.

188
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And finally, my son playing in a walking toy by himself.

189
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Now we freeze the action, 30 minutes,

190
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
we turn time into the vertical axis,

191
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and we open up for a view

192
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
of these interaction traces we've just left behind.

193
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And we see these amazing structures --

194
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
these little knots of two colors of thread

195
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
we call "social hot spots."

196
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
The spiral thread

197
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
we call a "solo hot spot."

198
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And we think that these affect the way language is learned.

199
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
What we'd like to do

200
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
is start understanding

201
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
the interaction between these patterns

202
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and the language that my son is exposed to

203
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
to see if we can predict

204
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
how the structure of when words are heard

205
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
affects when they're learned --

206
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
so in other words, the relationship

207
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
between words and what they're about in the world.

208
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So here's how we're approaching this.

209
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
In this video,

210
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
again, my son is being traced out.

211
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
He's leaving red ink behind.

212
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And there's our nanny by the door.

213
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
(Video) Nanny: You want water? (Baby: Aaaa.)

214
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Nanny: All right. (Baby: Aaaa.)

215
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
DR: She offers water,

216
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and off go the two worms

217
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
over to the kitchen to get water.

218
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And what we've done is use the word "water"

219
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
to tag that moment, that bit of activity.

220
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And now we take the power of data

221
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and take every time my son

222
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
ever heard the word water

223
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and the context he saw it in,

224
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and we use it to penetrate through the video

225
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and find every activity trace

226
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
that co-occurred with an instance of water.

227
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And what this data leaves in its wake

228
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
is a landscape.

229
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
We call these wordscapes.

230
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
This is the wordscape for the word water,

231
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and you can see most of the action is in the kitchen.

232
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
That's where those big peaks are over to the left.

233
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And just for contrast, we can do this with any word.

234
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
We can take the word "bye"

235
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
as in "good bye."

236
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And we're now zoomed in over the entrance to the house.

237
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And we look, and we find, as you would expect,

238
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
a contrast in the landscape

239
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
where the word "bye" occurs much more in a structured way.

240
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
So we're using these structures

241
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
to start predicting

242
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
the order of language acquisition,

243
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
and that's ongoing work now.

244
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
In my lab, which we're peering into now, at MIT --

245
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
this is at the media lab.

246
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
This has become my favorite way

247
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
of videographing just about any space.

248
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Three of the key people in this project,

249
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Philip DeCamp, Rony Kubat and Brandon Roy are pictured here.

250
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Philip has been a close collaborator

251
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
on all the visualizations you're seeing.

252
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And Michael Fleischman

253
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
was another Ph.D. student in my lab

254
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
who worked with me on this home video analysis,

255
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and he made the following observation:

256
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
that "just the way that we're analyzing

257
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
how language connects to events

258
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
which provide common ground for language,

259
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
that same idea we can take out of your home, Deb,

260
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and we can apply it to the world of public media."

261
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And so our effort took an unexpected turn.

262
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Think of mass media

263
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
as providing common ground

264
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and you have the recipe

265
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
for taking this idea to a whole new place.

266
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
We've started analyzing television content

267
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
using the same principles --

268
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
analyzing event structure of a TV signal --

269
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
episodes of shows,

270
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
commercials,

271
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
all of the components that make up the event structure.

272
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And we're now, with satellite dishes, pulling and analyzing

273
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
a good part of all the TV being watched in the United States.

274
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And you don't have to now go and instrument living rooms with microphones

275
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
to get people's conversations,

276
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
you just tune into publicly available social media feeds.

277
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
So we're pulling in

278
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
about three billion comments a month,

279
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and then the magic happens.

280
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
You have the event structure,

281
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
the common ground that the words are about,

282
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
coming out of the television feeds;

283
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
you've got the conversations

284
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
that are about those topics;

285
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and through semantic analysis --

286
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and this is actually real data you're looking at

287
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
from our data processing --

288
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
each yellow line is showing a link being made

289
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
between a comment in the wild

290
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and a piece of event structure coming out of the television signal.

291
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And the same idea now

292
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
can be built up.

293
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And we get this wordscape,

294
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
except now words are not assembled in my living room.

295
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Instead, the context, the common ground activities,

296
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
are the content on television that's driving the conversations.

297
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And what we're seeing here, these skyscrapers now,

298
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
are commentary

299
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
that are linked to content on television.

300
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Same concept,

301
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
but looking at communication dynamics

302
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
in a very different sphere.

303
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And so fundamentally, rather than, for example,

304
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
measuring content based on how many people are watching,

305
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
this gives us the basic data

306
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
for looking at engagement properties of content.

307
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And just like we can look at feedback cycles

308
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and dynamics in a family,

309
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
we can now open up the same concepts

310
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and look at much larger groups of people.

311
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
This is a subset of data from our database --

312
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
just 50,000 out of several million --

313
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and the social graph that connects them

314
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
through publicly available sources.

315
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And if you put them on one plain,

316
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
a second plain is where the content lives.

317
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
So we have the programs

318
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and the sporting events

319
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and the commercials,

320
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and all of the link structures that tie them together

321
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
make a content graph.

322
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And then the important third dimension.

323
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Each of the links that you're seeing rendered here

324
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
is an actual connection made

325
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
between something someone said

326
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and a piece of content.

327
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And there are, again, now tens of millions of these links

328
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
that give us the connective tissue of social graphs

329
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and how they relate to content.

330
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
And we can now start to probe the structure

331
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
in interesting ways.

332
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
So if we, for example, trace the path

333
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
of one piece of content

334
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
that drives someone to comment on it,

335
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and then we follow where that comment goes,

336
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and then look at the entire social graph that becomes activated

337
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and then trace back to see the relationship

338
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
between that social graph and content,

339
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
a very interesting structure becomes visible.

340
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
We call this a co-viewing clique,

341
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
a virtual living room if you will.

342
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
And there are fascinating dynamics at play.

343
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
It's not one way.

344
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
A piece of content, an event, causes someone to talk.

345
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
They talk to other people.

346
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
That drives tune-in behavior back into mass media,

347
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
and you have these cycles

348
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
that drive the overall behavior.

349
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Another example -- very different --

350
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
another actual person in our database --

351
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and we're finding at least hundreds, if not thousands, of these.

352
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
We've given this person a name.

353
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
This is a pro-amateur, or pro-am media critic

354
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
who has this high fan-out rate.

355
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
So a lot of people are following this person -- very influential --

356
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and they have a propensity to talk about what's on TV.

357
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
So this person is a key link

358
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
in connecting mass media and social media together.

359
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
One last example from this data:

360
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Sometimes it's actually a piece of content that is special.

361
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
So if we go and look at this piece of content,

362
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
President Obama's State of the Union address

363
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
from just a few weeks ago,

364
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and look at what we find in this same data set,

365
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
at the same scale,

366
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
the engagement properties of this piece of content

367
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
are truly remarkable.

368
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
A nation exploding in conversation

369
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
in real time

370
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
in response to what's on the broadcast.

371
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
And of course, through all of these lines

372
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
are flowing unstructured language.

373
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
We can X-ray

374
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and get a real-time pulse of a nation,

375
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
real-time sense

376
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
of the social reactions in the different circuits in the social graph

377
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
being activated by content.

378
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
So, to summarize, the idea is this:

379
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
As our world becomes increasingly instrumented

380
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
and we have the capabilities

381
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
to collect and connect the dots

382
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
between what people are saying

383
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
and the context they're saying it in,

384
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
what's emerging is an ability

385
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
to see new social structures and dynamics

386
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
that have previously not been seen.

387
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
It's like building a microscope or telescope

388
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
and revealing new structures

389
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
about our own behavior around communication.

390
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
And I think the implications here are profound,

391
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
whether it's for science,

392
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
for commerce, for government,

393
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
or perhaps most of all,

394
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
for us as individuals.

395
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
And so just to return to my son,

396
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
when I was preparing this talk, he was looking over my shoulder,

397
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
and I showed him the clips I was going to show to you today,

398
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
and I asked him for permission -- granted.

399
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
And then I went on to reflect,

400
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
"Isn't it amazing,

401
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
this entire database, all these recordings,

402
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
I'm going to hand off to you and to your sister" --

403
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
who arrived two years later --

404
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
"and you guys are going to be able to go back and re-experience moments

405
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
that you could never, with your biological memory,

406
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
possibly remember the way you can now?"

407
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
And he was quiet for a moment.

408
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
And I thought, "What am I thinking?

409
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
He's five years old. He's not going to understand this."

410
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
And just as I was having that thought, he looked up at me and said,

411
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
"So that when I grow up,

412
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
I can show this to my kids?"

413
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
And I thought, "Wow, this is powerful stuff."

414
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
So I want to leave you

415
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
with one last memorable moment

416
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
from our family.

417
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
This is the first time our son

418
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
took more than two steps at once --

419
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
captured on film.

420
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:21,000
And I really want you to focus on something

421
0:18:21.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
as I take you through.

422
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
It's a cluttered environment; it's natural life.

423
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:27,000
My mother's in the kitchen, cooking,

424
0:18:27.26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
and, of all places, in the hallway,

425
0:18:29.26,000 --> 0:18:32,000
I realize he's about to do it, about to take more than two steps.

426
0:18:32.26,000 --> 0:18:34,000
And so you hear me encouraging him,

427
0:18:34.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
realizing what's happening,

428
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
and then the magic happens.

429
0:18:38.26,000 --> 0:18:4,000
Listen very carefully.

430
0:18:40.26,000 --> 0:18:42,000
About three steps in,

431
0:18:42.26,000 --> 0:18:44,000
he realizes something magic is happening,

432
0:18:44.26,000 --> 0:18:47,000
and the most amazing feedback loop of all kicks in,

433
0:18:47.26,000 --> 0:18:49,000
and he takes a breath in,

434
0:18:49.26,000 --> 0:18:51,000
and he whispers "wow"

435
0:18:51.26,000 --> 0:18:55,000
and instinctively I echo back the same.

436
0:18:56.26,000 --> 0:18:59,000
And so let's fly back in time

437
0:18:59.26,000 --> 0:19:01,000
to that memorable moment.

438
0:19:05.26,000 --> 0:19:07,000
(Video) DR: Hey.

439
0:19:07.26,000 --> 0:19:09,000
Come here.

440
0:19:09.26,000 --> 0:19:12,000
Can you do it?

441
0:19:13.26,000 --> 0:19:15,000
Oh, boy.

442
0:19:15.26,000 --> 0:19:18,000
Can you do it?

443
0:19:18.26,000 --> 0:19:2,000
Baby: Yeah.

444
0:19:20.26,000 --> 0:19:23,000
DR: Ma, he's walking.

445
0:19:24.26,000 --> 0:19:26,000
(Laughter)

446
0:19:26.26,000 --> 0:19:28,000
(Applause)

447
0:19:28.26,000 --> 0:19:3,000
DR: Thank you.

448
0:19:30.26,000 --> 0:19:45,000
(Applause)

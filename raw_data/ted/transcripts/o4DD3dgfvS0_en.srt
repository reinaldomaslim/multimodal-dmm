1
0:00:12.719,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Isadora Duncan --

2
0:00:14.629,000 --> 0:00:15,000
(Music) --

3
0:00:16.527,000 --> 0:00:21,000
crazy, long-legged woman from San Francisco,

4
0:00:21.65,000 --> 0:00:25,000
got tired of this country, and she wanted to get out.

5
0:00:27.849,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Isadora was famous somewhere around 1908

6
0:00:32.934,000 --> 0:00:36,000
for putting up a blue curtain,

7
0:00:37.299,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and she would stand

8
0:00:39.504,000 --> 0:00:42,000
with her hands over her solar plexus

9
0:00:43.8,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and she would wait,

10
0:00:47.144,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and she would wait,

11
0:00:49.271,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and then, she would move.

12
0:00:53.45,000 --> 0:00:57,000
(Music)

13
0:01:21.856,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Josh and I and Somi call this piece

14
0:01:27.527,000 --> 0:01:31,000
"The Red Circle and the Blue Curtain."

15
0:01:36.768,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Red circle.

16
0:01:39.508,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Blue curtain.

17
0:01:43.356,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But,

18
0:01:51.397,000 --> 0:01:54,000
this is not the beginning of the 20th century.

19
0:01:55.372,000 --> 0:01:59,000
This is a morning in Vancouver

20
0:02:00.24,000 --> 0:02:02,000
in 2015.

21
0:02:03.824,000 --> 0:02:08,000
(Music)

22
0:02:34.404,000 --> 0:02:41,000
(Singing)

23
0:03:26.068,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Come on, Josh!

24
0:03:28.365,000 --> 0:03:33,000
(Music)

25
0:03:46.522,000 --> 0:03:54,000
(Singing)

26
0:04:07.082,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Go!

27
0:04:24.506,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Are we there yet?

28
0:04:27.14,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I don't think so.

29
0:04:29.34,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Hey, yeah!

30
0:04:31.449,000 --> 0:04:35,000
(Music)

31
0:04:49.583,000 --> 0:04:51,000
What time is it?

32
0:04:51.756,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Music)

33
0:04:53.428,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Where are we?

34
0:04:59.178,000 --> 0:05:,000
Josh.

35
0:05:03.775,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Somi.

36
0:05:06.251,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Bill T.

37
0:05:08.587,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Josh.

38
0:05:13.315,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Somi.

39
0:05:18.185,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Bill T.

40
0:06:02.65,000 --> 0:06:07,000
(Applause)

41
0:06:20.457,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Yeah, yeah!

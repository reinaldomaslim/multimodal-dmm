1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I was here about four years ago,

2
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
talking about the relationship of design and happiness.

3
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
At the very end of it, I showed a list under that title.

4
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I learned very few things in addition since

5
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
(Laughter) --

6
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
but made a whole number of them into projects since.

7
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
These are inflatable monkeys in every city in Scotland:

8
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
"Everybody always thinks they are right."

9
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
They were combined in the media.

10
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
"Drugs are fun in the beginning but become a drag later on."

11
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
We're doing changing media.

12
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
This is a projection that can see the viewer

13
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
as the viewer walks by.

14
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
You can't help but actually ripping that spider web apart.

15
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
All of these things are pieces of graphic design.

16
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
We do them for our clients.

17
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
They are commissioned.

18
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I would never have the money to actually pay for the installment

19
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
or pay for all the billboards or the production of these,

20
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
so there's always a client attached to them.

21
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
These are 65,000 coat hangers in a street

22
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that's lined with fashion stores.

23
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
"Worrying solves nothing."

24
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
"Money does not make me happy"

25
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
appeared first as double-page spreads in a magazine.

26
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
The printer lost the file, didn't tell us.

27
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
When the magazine -- actually, when I got the subscription --

28
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
it was 12 following pages.

29
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
It said, "Money does does make me happy."

30
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And a friend of mine in Austria felt so sorry for me

31
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that he talked the largest casino owner in Linz

32
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
into letting us wrap his building.

33
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So this is the big pedestrian zone in Linz.

34
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
It just says "Money," and if you look down the side street,

35
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
it says, "does not make me happy."

36
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
We had a show that just came down last week in New York.

37
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
We steamed up the windows permanently,

38
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and every hour we had a different designer come in

39
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and write these things that they've learned into the steam in the window.

40
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Everybody participated -- Milton Glaser,

41
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
Massimo Vignelli.

42
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Singapore was quite in discussion.

43
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
This is a little spot that we filmed there

44
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that's to be displayed on the large JumboTrons in Singapore.

45
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And, of course, it's one that's dear to my heart,

46
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
because all of these sentiments --

47
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
some banal, some a bit more profound --

48
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
all originally had come out of my diary.

49
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And I do go often into the diary

50
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and check if I wanted to change something about the situation.

51
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
If it's -- see it for a long enough time,

52
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I actually do something about it.

53
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And the very last one is a billboard.

54
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
This is our roof in New York, the roof of the studio.

55
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
This is newsprint plus stencils that lie on the newsprint.

56
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
We let that lie around in the sun.

57
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
As you all know, newsprint yellows significantly in the sun.

58
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
After a week, we took the stencils and the leaves off,

59
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
shipped the newsprints to Lisbon to a very sunny spot,

60
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
so on day one the billboard said,

61
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
"Complaining is silly. Either act or forget."

62
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Three days later it faded, and a week later,

63
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
no more complaining anywhere.

64
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
(Laughter)

65
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Thank you so much.

66
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
(Applause)

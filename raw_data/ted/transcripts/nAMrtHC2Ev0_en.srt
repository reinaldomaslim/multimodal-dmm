1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
All buildings today have something in common.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
They're made using Victorian technologies.

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
This involves blueprints,

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
industrial manufacturing

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and construction using teams of workers.

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
All of this effort results in an inert object.

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And that means that there is a one-way transfer of energy

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
from our environment into our homes and cities.

9
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
This is not sustainable.

10
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I believe that the only way that it is possible for us

11
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to construct genuinely sustainable homes and cities

12
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
is by connecting them to nature,

13
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
not insulating them from it.

14
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Now, in order to do this, we need the right kind of language.

15
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Living systems are in constant conversation

16
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
with the natural world,

17
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism.

18
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And this is the conversion of one group of substances

19
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
into another, either through

20
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
the production or the absorption of energy.

21
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And this is the way in which living materials

22
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
make the most of their local resources

23
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
in a sustainable way.

24
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
So, I'm interested in the use of

25
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
metabolic materials for the practice of architecture.

26
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But they don't exist. So I'm having to make them.

27
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I'm working with architect Neil Spiller

28
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
at the Bartlett School of Architecture,

29
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and we're collaborating with international scientists

30
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
in order to generate these new materials

31
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
from a bottom up approach.

32
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
That means we're generating them from scratch.

33
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
One of our collaborators is chemist Martin Hanczyc,

34
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and he's really interested in the transition from

35
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
inert to living matter.

36
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Now, that's exactly the kind of process that I'm interested in,

37
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
when we're thinking about sustainable materials.

38
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So, Martin, he works with a system called the protocell.

39
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Now all this is -- and it's magic --

40
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
is a little fatty bag. And it's got a chemical battery in it.

41
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And it has no DNA.

42
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
This little bag is able to conduct itself

43
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
in a way that can only be described as living.

44
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
It is able to move around its environment.

45
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
It can follow chemical gradients.

46
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
It can undergo complex reactions,

47
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
some of which are happily architectural.

48
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So here we are. These are protocells,

49
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
patterning their environment.

50
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
We don't know how they do that yet.

51
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Here, this is a protocell, and it's vigorously shedding this skin.

52
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Now, this looks like a chemical kind of birth.

53
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
This is a violent process.

54
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Here, we've got a protocell to extract carbon dioxide

55
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
out of the atmosphere

56
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and turn it into carbonate.

57
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And that's the shell around that globular fat.

58
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
They are quite brittle. So you've only got a part of one there.

59
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So what we're trying to do is, we're trying to push these technologies

60
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
towards creating bottom-up construction approaches

61
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
for architecture,

62
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
which contrast the current, Victorian, top-down methods

63
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
which impose structure upon matter.

64
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
That can't be energetically sensible.

65
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So, bottom-up materials

66
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
actually exist today.

67
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
They've been in use, in architecture, since ancient times.

68
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
If you walk around the city of Oxford, where we are today,

69
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and have a look at the brickwork,

70
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
which I've enjoyed doing in the last couple of days,

71
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
you'll actually see that a lot of it is made of limestone.

72
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And if you look even closer,

73
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
you'll see, in that limestone, there are little shells

74
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and little skeletons that are piled upon each other.

75
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And then they are fossilized over millions of years.

76
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Now a block of limestone, in itself,

77
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
isn't particularly that interesting.

78
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
It looks beautiful.

79
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
But imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be

80
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
if the surfaces were actually

81
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
in conversation with the atmosphere.

82
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Maybe they could extract carbon dioxide.

83
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Would it give this block of limestone new properties?

84
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Well, most likely it would. It might be able to grow.

85
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It might be able to self-repair, and even respond

86
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to dramatic changes

87
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
in the immediate environment.

88
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So, architects are never happy

89
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
with just one block of an interesting material.

90
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
They think big. Okay?

91
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So when we think about scaling up metabolic materials,

92
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
we can start thinking about ecological interventions

93
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
like repair of atolls,

94
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
or reclamation of parts of a city

95
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that are damaged by water.

96
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So, one of these examples

97
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
would of course be the historic city of Venice.

98
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Now, Venice, as you know, has a tempestuous relationship with the sea,

99
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and is built upon wooden piles.

100
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So we've devised a way by which it may be possible

101
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
for the protocell technology that we're working with

102
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
to sustainably reclaim Venice.

103
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And architect Christian Kerrigan

104
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
has come up with a series of designs that show us

105
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
how it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef

106
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
underneath the city.

107
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So, here is the technology we have today.

108
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
This is our protocell technology,

109
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
effectively making a shell, like its limestone forefathers,

110
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and depositing it in a very complex environment,

111
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
against natural materials.

112
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
We're looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this.

113
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Now, this is the very interesting part.

114
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
We don't just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals.

115
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
What we need it to do is to be

116
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
creatively crafted around the wooden piles.

117
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So, you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually

118
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
moving away from the light,

119
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
toward the dark foundations.

120
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
We've observed this in the laboratory.

121
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
The protocells can actually move away from the light.

122
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
They can actually also move towards the light. You have to just choose your species.

123
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So that these don't just exist as one entity,

124
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
we kind of chemically engineer them.

125
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And so here the protocells are depositing their limestone

126
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
very specifically, around the foundations of Venice,

127
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
effectively petrifying it.

128
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Now, this isn't going to happen tomorrow. It's going to take a while.

129
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
It's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology

130
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
in order for us to become ready

131
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
to test it out in a case-by-case basis

132
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
on the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of Venice.

133
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
But gradually, as the buildings are repaired,

134
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
we will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the city.

135
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
An accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide.

136
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Also it will attract the local marine ecology,

137
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
who will find their own ecological niches within this architecture.

138
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
So, this is really interesting. Now we have an architecture

139
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that connects a city to the natural world

140
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
in a very direct and immediate way.

141
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
But perhaps the most exciting thing about it

142
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
is that the driver of this technology is available everywhere.

143
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
This is terrestrial chemistry. We've all got it,

144
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
which means that this technology is just as appropriate

145
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
for developing countries as it is

146
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
for First World countries.

147
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So, in summary, I'm generating metabolic materials

148
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
as a counterpoise to Victorian technologies,

149
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and building architectures from a bottom-up approach.

150
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Secondly, these metabolic materials

151
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
have some of the properties of living systems,

152
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
which means they can perform in similar ways.

153
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
They can expect to have a lot of forms and functions

154
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
within the practice of architecture.

155
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And finally, an observer in the future

156
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
marveling at a beautiful structure in the environment

157
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
may find it almost impossible to tell

158
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
whether this structure

159
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
has been created by a natural process

160
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
or an artificial one.

161
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Thank you.

162
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.86,000 --> 0:00:19,000
So, I'll start with this: a couple years ago, an event planner called me

2
0:00:20.345,000 --> 0:00:22,000
because I was going to do a speaking event.

3
0:00:22.418,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And she called, and she said,

4
0:00:24.132,000 --> 0:00:27,000
"I'm really struggling with how to write about you on the little flyer."

5
0:00:27.728,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And I thought, "Well, what's the struggle?"

6
0:00:30.488,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And she said, "Well, I saw you speak,

7
0:00:32.416,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and I'm going to call you a researcher, I think,

8
0:00:34.925,000 --> 0:00:36,000
but I'm afraid if I call you a researcher, no one will come,

9
0:00:37.837,000 --> 0:00:39,000
because they'll think you're boring and irrelevant."

10
0:00:40.32,000 --> 0:00:41,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:41.345,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And I was like, "Okay."

12
0:00:42.945,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And she said, "But the thing I liked about your talk

13
0:00:45.447,000 --> 0:00:46,000
is you're a storyteller.

14
0:00:46.687,000 --> 0:00:48,000
So I think what I'll do is just call you a storyteller."

15
0:00:49.99,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And of course, the academic, insecure part of me

16
0:00:52.99,000 --> 0:00:54,000
was like, "You're going to call me a what?"

17
0:00:55.324,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And she said, "I'm going to call you a storyteller."

18
0:00:57.896,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And I was like, "Why not 'magic pixie'?"

19
0:01:00.769,000 --> 0:01:02,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:03.648,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I was like, "Let me think about this for a second."

21
0:01:07.291,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I tried to call deep on my courage.

22
0:01:09.854,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And I thought, you know, I am a storyteller.

23
0:01:12.99,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I'm a qualitative researcher.

24
0:01:14.418,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I collect stories; that's what I do.

25
0:01:16.656,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And maybe stories are just data with a soul.

26
0:01:19.585,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And maybe I'm just a storyteller.

27
0:01:21.99,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And so I said, "You know what?

28
0:01:23.673,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Why don't you just say I'm a researcher-storyteller."

29
0:01:26.338,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And she went, "Ha ha. There's no such thing."

30
0:01:29.99,000 --> 0:01:3,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:31.697,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So I'm a researcher-storyteller, and I'm going to talk to you today --

32
0:01:35.698,000 --> 0:01:37,000
we're talking about expanding perception --

33
0:01:37.771,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and so I want to talk to you and tell some stories

34
0:01:40.177,000 --> 0:01:45,000
about a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception

35
0:01:45.36,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and really actually changed the way that I live and love

36
0:01:48.273,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and work and parent.

37
0:01:50.093,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And this is where my story starts.

38
0:01:52.99,000 --> 0:01:54,000
When I was a young researcher, doctoral student,

39
0:01:55.697,000 --> 0:01:58,000
my first year, I had a research professor who said to us,

40
0:01:59.698,000 --> 0:02:02,000
"Here's the thing, if you cannot measure it, it does not exist."

41
0:02:05.374,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And I thought he was just sweet-talking me.

42
0:02:08.339,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I was like, "Really?" and he was like, "Absolutely."

43
0:02:10.8,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And so you have to understand

44
0:02:13.077,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that I have a bachelor's and a master's in social work,

45
0:02:15.681,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work, so my entire academic career

46
0:02:19.079,000 --> 0:02:24,000
was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the "life's messy, love it."

47
0:02:25.474,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And I'm more of the, "life's messy, clean it up, organize it

48
0:02:30.926,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and put it into a bento box."

49
0:02:32.727,000 --> 0:02:33,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:35.02,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And so to think that I had found my way, to found a career that takes me --

51
0:02:40.355,000 --> 0:02:43,000
really, one of the big sayings in social work is,

52
0:02:43.712,000 --> 0:02:45,000
"Lean into the discomfort of the work."

53
0:02:46.537,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And I'm like, knock discomfort upside the head

54
0:02:49.093,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and move it over and get all A's.

55
0:02:51.395,000 --> 0:02:52,000
That was my mantra.

56
0:02:54.99,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So I was very excited about this.

57
0:02:56.99,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And so I thought, you know what, this is the career for me,

58
0:02:59.99,000 --> 0:03:01,000
because I am interested in some messy topics.

59
0:03:02.99,000 --> 0:03:04,000
But I want to be able to make them not messy.

60
0:03:05.385,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I want to understand them.

61
0:03:06.731,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I want to hack into these things that I know are important

62
0:03:10.332,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and lay the code out for everyone to see.

63
0:03:12.99,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So where I started was with connection.

64
0:03:15.673,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Because, by the time you're a social worker for 10 years,

65
0:03:19.109,000 --> 0:03:23,000
what you realize is that connection is why we're here.

66
0:03:23.84,000 --> 0:03:25,000
It's what gives purpose and meaning to our lives.

67
0:03:27.076,000 --> 0:03:28,000
This is what it's all about.

68
0:03:28.886,000 --> 0:03:3,000
It doesn't matter whether you talk to people

69
0:03:31.007,000 --> 0:03:34,000
who work in social justice, mental health and abuse and neglect,

70
0:03:34.123,000 --> 0:03:39,000
what we know is that connection, the ability to feel connected, is --

71
0:03:39.948,000 --> 0:03:41,000
neurobiologically that's how we're wired --

72
0:03:41.99,000 --> 0:03:42,000
it's why we're here.

73
0:03:43.393,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So I thought, you know what, I'm going to start with connection.

74
0:03:47.067,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Well, you know that situation

75
0:03:48.988,000 --> 0:03:5,000
where you get an evaluation from your boss,

76
0:03:51.52,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and she tells you 37 things that you do really awesome,

77
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and one "opportunity for growth?"

78
0:03:56.728,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Laughter)

79
0:03:59.196,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And all you can think about is that opportunity for growth, right?

80
0:04:02.688,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Well, apparently this is the way my work went as well,

81
0:04:05.41,000 --> 0:04:09,000
because, when you ask people about love, they tell you about heartbreak.

82
0:04:10.411,000 --> 0:04:12,000
When you ask people about belonging,

83
0:04:13.069,000 --> 0:04:16,000
they'll tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded.

84
0:04:17.045,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And when you ask people about connection,

85
0:04:19.57,000 --> 0:04:21,000
the stories they told me were about disconnection.

86
0:04:23.118,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So very quickly -- really about six weeks into this research --

87
0:04:26.167,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unraveled connection

88
0:04:32.213,000 --> 0:04:34,000
in a way that I didn't understand or had never seen.

89
0:04:35.109,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And so I pulled back out of the research

90
0:04:37.11,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and thought, I need to figure out what this is.

91
0:04:39.364,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And it turned out to be shame.

92
0:04:43.212,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And shame is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection:

93
0:04:47.213,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Is there something about me that, if other people know it or see it,

94
0:04:51.793,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that I won't be worthy of connection?

95
0:04:55.593,000 --> 0:04:56,000
The things I can tell you about it:

96
0:04:57.299,000 --> 0:04:58,000
It's universal; we all have it.

97
0:04:58.99,000 --> 0:05:,000
The only people who don't experience shame

98
0:05:01.014,000 --> 0:05:03,000
have no capacity for human empathy or connection.

99
0:05:03.372,000 --> 0:05:04,000
No one wants to talk about it,

100
0:05:04.99,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and the less you talk about it, the more you have it.

101
0:05:09.005,000 --> 0:05:14,000
What underpinned this shame, this "I'm not good enough," --

102
0:05:14.195,000 --> 0:05:15,000
which, we all know that feeling:

103
0:05:15.823,000 --> 0:05:17,000
"I'm not blank enough. I'm not thin enough,

104
0:05:17.896,000 --> 0:05:2,000
rich enough, beautiful enough, smart enough, promoted enough."

105
0:05:21.174,000 --> 0:05:25,000
The thing that underpinned this was excruciating vulnerability.

106
0:05:26.862,000 --> 0:05:3,000
This idea of, in order for connection to happen,

107
0:05:30.99,000 --> 0:05:33,000
we have to allow ourselves to be seen, really seen.

108
0:05:36.061,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And you know how I feel about vulnerability. I hate vulnerability.

109
0:05:39.283,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And so I thought, this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick.

110
0:05:43.805,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I'm going in, I'm going to figure this stuff out,

111
0:05:46.52,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I'm going to spend a year, I'm going to totally deconstruct shame,

112
0:05:49.854,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I'm going to understand how vulnerability works,

113
0:05:52.156,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and I'm going to outsmart it.

114
0:05:54.64,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So I was ready, and I was really excited.

115
0:06:00.239,000 --> 0:06:02,000
As you know, it's not going to turn out well.

116
0:06:02.406,000 --> 0:06:04,000
(Laughter)

117
0:06:04.943,000 --> 0:06:05,000
You know this.

118
0:06:06.561,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So, I could tell you a lot about shame,

119
0:06:08.474,000 --> 0:06:1,000
but I'd have to borrow everyone else's time.

120
0:06:10.595,000 --> 0:06:12,000
But here's what I can tell you that it boils down to --

121
0:06:13.476,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and this may be one of the most important things that I've ever learned

122
0:06:16.882,000 --> 0:06:17,000
in the decade of doing this research.

123
0:06:20.068,000 --> 0:06:24,000
My one year turned into six years:

124
0:06:24.284,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Thousands of stories, hundreds of long interviews, focus groups.

125
0:06:28.99,000 --> 0:06:3,000
At one point, people were sending me journal pages

126
0:06:31.395,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and sending me their stories --

127
0:06:33.256,000 --> 0:06:36,000
thousands of pieces of data in six years.

128
0:06:37.272,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And I kind of got a handle on it.

129
0:06:38.99,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I kind of understood, this is what shame is, this is how it works.

130
0:06:43.452,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I wrote a book, I published a theory, but something was not okay --

131
0:06:49.723,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and what it was is that, if I roughly took the people I interviewed

132
0:06:53.903,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and divided them into people who really have a sense of worthiness --

133
0:07:00.499,000 --> 0:07:02,000
that's what this comes down to, a sense of worthiness --

134
0:07:03.285,000 --> 0:07:06,000
they have a strong sense of love and belonging --

135
0:07:06.531,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and folks who struggle for it,

136
0:07:08.206,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and folks who are always wondering if they're good enough.

137
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
There was only one variable that separated

138
0:07:13.593,000 --> 0:07:15,000
the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging

139
0:07:16.357,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and the people who really struggle for it.

140
0:07:18.64,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And that was, the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging

141
0:07:22.382,000 --> 0:07:24,000
believe they're worthy of love and belonging.

142
0:07:25.704,000 --> 0:07:26,000
That's it.

143
0:07:27.505,000 --> 0:07:28,000
They believe they're worthy.

144
0:07:30.736,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And to me, the hard part of the one thing that keeps us out of connection

145
0:07:36.578,000 --> 0:07:39,000
is our fear that we're not worthy of connection,

146
0:07:39.817,000 --> 0:07:41,000
was something that, personally and professionally,

147
0:07:42.244,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I felt like I needed to understand better.

148
0:07:44.807,000 --> 0:07:48,000
So what I did is I took all of the interviews

149
0:07:49.808,000 --> 0:07:51,000
where I saw worthiness, where I saw people living that way,

150
0:07:52.65,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and just looked at those.

151
0:07:55.314,000 --> 0:07:57,000
What do these people have in common?

152
0:07:57.386,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I have a slight office supply addiction, but that's another talk.

153
0:08:02.053,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So I had a manila folder, and I had a Sharpie,

154
0:08:05.554,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and I was like, what am I going to call this research?

155
0:08:08.198,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And the first words that came to my mind were "whole-hearted."

156
0:08:11.807,000 --> 0:08:14,000
These are whole-hearted people, living from this deep sense of worthiness.

157
0:08:15.347,000 --> 0:08:17,000
So I wrote at the top of the manila folder,

158
0:08:18.227,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and I started looking at the data.

159
0:08:20.18,000 --> 0:08:25,000
In fact, I did it first in a four-day, very intensive data analysis,

160
0:08:26.197,000 --> 0:08:29,000
where I went back, pulled the interviews, the stories, pulled the incidents.

161
0:08:29.798,000 --> 0:08:3,000
What's the theme? What's the pattern?

162
0:08:32.37,000 --> 0:08:34,000
My husband left town with the kids

163
0:08:35.371,000 --> 0:08:37,000
because I always go into this Jackson Pollock crazy thing,

164
0:08:38.372,000 --> 0:08:41,000
where I'm just writing and in my researcher mode.

165
0:08:43.625,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And so here's what I found.

166
0:08:48.114,000 --> 0:08:5,000
What they had in common was a sense of courage.

167
0:08:51.624,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And I want to separate courage and bravery for you for a minute.

168
0:08:54.745,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Courage, the original definition of courage,

169
0:08:57.21,000 --> 0:08:59,000
when it first came into the English language --

170
0:08:59.473,000 --> 0:09:01,000
it's from the Latin word "cor," meaning "heart" --

171
0:09:01.85,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and the original definition was to tell the story of who you are

172
0:09:04.885,000 --> 0:09:05,000
with your whole heart.

173
0:09:07.059,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And so these folks had, very simply, the courage to be imperfect.

174
0:09:13.632,000 --> 0:09:17,000
They had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others,

175
0:09:18.633,000 --> 0:09:19,000
because, as it turns out,

176
0:09:19.856,000 --> 0:09:21,000
we can't practice compassion with other people

177
0:09:22.114,000 --> 0:09:23,000
if we can't treat ourselves kindly.

178
0:09:24.259,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And the last was they had connection, and -- this was the hard part --

179
0:09:28.68,000 --> 0:09:3,000
as a result of authenticity,

180
0:09:31.681,000 --> 0:09:34,000
they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be

181
0:09:34.99,000 --> 0:09:38,000
in order to be who they were, which you have to absolutely do that

182
0:09:39.618,000 --> 0:09:4,000
for connection.

183
0:09:43.323,000 --> 0:09:47,000
The other thing that they had in common was this:

184
0:09:50.91,000 --> 0:09:53,000
They fully embraced vulnerability.

185
0:09:55.679,000 --> 0:10:01,000
They believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful.

186
0:10:06.141,000 --> 0:10:09,000
They didn't talk about vulnerability being comfortable,

187
0:10:09.99,000 --> 0:10:11,000
nor did they really talk about it being excruciating --

188
0:10:12.84,000 --> 0:10:14,000
as I had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing.

189
0:10:15.342,000 --> 0:10:17,000
They just talked about it being necessary.

190
0:10:18.633,000 --> 0:10:21,000
They talked about the willingness to say, "I love you" first ...

191
0:10:24.378,000 --> 0:10:29,000
the willingness to do something where there are no guarantees ...

192
0:10:31.283,000 --> 0:10:35,000
the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call

193
0:10:35.642,000 --> 0:10:36,000
after your mammogram.

194
0:10:38.631,000 --> 0:10:41,000
They're willing to invest in a relationship

195
0:10:41.92,000 --> 0:10:42,000
that may or may not work out.

196
0:10:44.465,000 --> 0:10:45,000
They thought this was fundamental.

197
0:10:47.442,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I personally thought it was betrayal.

198
0:10:50.847,000 --> 0:10:54,000
I could not believe I had pledged allegiance to research, where our job --

199
0:10:55.467,000 --> 0:10:59,000
you know, the definition of research is to control and predict,

200
0:10:59.555,000 --> 0:11:03,000
to study phenomena for the explicit reason to control and predict.

201
0:11:04.222,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And now my mission to control and predict

202
0:11:08.612,000 --> 0:11:11,000
had turned up the answer that the way to live is with vulnerability

203
0:11:12.205,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and to stop controlling and predicting.

204
0:11:14.327,000 --> 0:11:15,000
This led to a little breakdown --

205
0:11:16.902,000 --> 0:11:21,000
(Laughter)

206
0:11:21.99,000 --> 0:11:23,000
-- which actually looked more like this.

207
0:11:24.99,000 --> 0:11:25,000
(Laughter)

208
0:11:26.507,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And it did.

209
0:11:28.508,000 --> 0:11:31,000
I call it a breakdown; my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening.

210
0:11:31.712,000 --> 0:11:32,000
(Laughter)

211
0:11:32.97,000 --> 0:11:34,000
A spiritual awakening sounds better than breakdown,

212
0:11:35.411,000 --> 0:11:36,000
but I assure you, it was a breakdown.

213
0:11:37.212,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And I had to put my data away and go find a therapist.

214
0:11:40.14,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Let me tell you something: you know who you are

215
0:11:42.395,000 --> 0:11:45,000
when you call your friends and say, "I think I need to see somebody.

216
0:11:45.659,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Do you have any recommendations?"

217
0:11:47.489,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Because about five of my friends were like,

218
0:11:49.562,000 --> 0:11:51,000
"Wooo, I wouldn't want to be your therapist."

219
0:11:51.73,000 --> 0:11:53,000
(Laughter)

220
0:11:54.492,000 --> 0:11:55,000
I was like, "What does that mean?"

221
0:11:56.493,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And they're like, "I'm just saying, you know.

222
0:11:59.724,000 --> 0:12:,000
Don't bring your measuring stick."

223
0:12:01.725,000 --> 0:12:03,000
(Laughter)

224
0:12:04.485,000 --> 0:12:05,000
I was like, "Okay."

225
0:12:06.545,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So I found a therapist.

226
0:12:08.403,000 --> 0:12:09,000
My first meeting with her, Diana --

227
0:12:12.109,000 --> 0:12:16,000
I brought in my list of the way the whole-hearted live, and I sat down.

228
0:12:16.427,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And she said, "How are you?"

229
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And I said, "I'm great. I'm okay."

230
0:12:21.879,000 --> 0:12:22,000
She said, "What's going on?"

231
0:12:23.427,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And this is a therapist who sees therapists,

232
0:12:26.07,000 --> 0:12:31,000
because we have to go to those, because their B.S. meters are good.

233
0:12:31.307,000 --> 0:12:32,000
(Laughter)

234
0:12:33.736,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And so I said, "Here's the thing, I'm struggling."

235
0:12:37.593,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And she said, "What's the struggle?"

236
0:12:40.442,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And I said, "Well, I have a vulnerability issue.

237
0:12:42.727,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And I know that vulnerability is the core of shame and fear

238
0:12:48.106,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and our struggle for worthiness,

239
0:12:49.727,000 --> 0:12:54,000
but it appears that it's also the birthplace of joy, of creativity,

240
0:12:55.427,000 --> 0:12:56,000
of belonging, of love.

241
0:12:57.776,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And I think I have a problem, and I need some help."

242
0:13:03.236,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And I said, "But here's the thing: no family stuff, no childhood shit."

243
0:13:08.427,000 --> 0:13:09,000
(Laughter)

244
0:13:10.427,000 --> 0:13:12,000
"I just need some strategies."

245
0:13:13.427,000 --> 0:13:16,000
(Laughter)

246
0:13:17.427,000 --> 0:13:2,000
(Applause)

247
0:13:21.036,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Thank you.

248
0:13:24.283,000 --> 0:13:25,000
So she goes like this.

249
0:13:27.427,000 --> 0:13:29,000
(Laughter)

250
0:13:29.807,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And then I said, "It's bad, right?"

251
0:13:32.427,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And she said, "It's neither good nor bad."

252
0:13:35.427,000 --> 0:13:36,000
(Laughter)

253
0:13:37.284,000 --> 0:13:38,000
"It just is what it is."

254
0:13:39.664,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And I said, "Oh my God, this is going to suck."

255
0:13:42.427,000 --> 0:13:43,000
(Laughter)

256
0:13:45.593,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And it did, and it didn't.

257
0:13:47.871,000 --> 0:13:49,000
And it took about a year.

258
0:13:49.958,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And you know how there are people

259
0:13:51.998,000 --> 0:13:55,000
that, when they realize that vulnerability and tenderness are important,

260
0:13:56.046,000 --> 0:13:58,000
that they surrender and walk into it.

261
0:13:59.231,000 --> 0:14:,000
A: that's not me,

262
0:14:01.215,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and B: I don't even hang out with people like that.

263
0:14:03.636,000 --> 0:14:05,000
(Laughter)

264
0:14:06.427,000 --> 0:14:08,000
For me, it was a yearlong street fight.

265
0:14:09.752,000 --> 0:14:1,000
It was a slugfest.

266
0:14:11.339,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Vulnerability pushed, I pushed back.

267
0:14:13.593,000 --> 0:14:16,000
I lost the fight,

268
0:14:16.704,000 --> 0:14:17,000
but probably won my life back.

269
0:14:18.727,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And so then I went back into the research

270
0:14:20.727,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and spent the next couple of years

271
0:14:22.427,000 --> 0:14:24,000
really trying to understand what they, the whole-hearted,

272
0:14:25.427,000 --> 0:14:3,000
what choices they were making, and what we are doing with vulnerability.

273
0:14:31.427,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Why do we struggle with it so much?

274
0:14:33.791,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Am I alone in struggling with vulnerability?

275
0:14:37.19,000 --> 0:14:38,000
No.

276
0:14:38.427,000 --> 0:14:39,000
So this is what I learned.

277
0:14:41.959,000 --> 0:14:42,000
We numb vulnerability --

278
0:14:44.68,000 --> 0:14:45,000
when we're waiting for the call.

279
0:14:46.291,000 --> 0:14:48,000
It was funny, I sent something out on Twitter and on Facebook

280
0:14:49.204,000 --> 0:14:51,000
that says, "How would you define vulnerability?

281
0:14:51.502,000 --> 0:14:52,000
What makes you feel vulnerable?"

282
0:14:53.074,000 --> 0:14:55,000
And within an hour and a half, I had 150 responses.

283
0:14:55.822,000 --> 0:14:57,000
Because I wanted to know what's out there.

284
0:15:01.204,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Having to ask my husband for help because I'm sick, and we're newly married;

285
0:15:06.251,000 --> 0:15:08,000
initiating sex with my husband;

286
0:15:08.282,000 --> 0:15:1,000
initiating sex with my wife;

287
0:15:11.02,000 --> 0:15:13,000
being turned down; asking someone out;

288
0:15:14.022,000 --> 0:15:16,000
waiting for the doctor to call back;

289
0:15:16.085,000 --> 0:15:18,000
getting laid off; laying off people.

290
0:15:18.451,000 --> 0:15:19,000
This is the world we live in.

291
0:15:20.962,000 --> 0:15:22,000
We live in a vulnerable world.

292
0:15:23.954,000 --> 0:15:25,000
And one of the ways we deal with it is we numb vulnerability.

293
0:15:27.688,000 --> 0:15:28,000
And I think there's evidence --

294
0:15:29.427,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and it's not the only reason this evidence exists,

295
0:15:31.832,000 --> 0:15:33,000
but I think it's a huge cause --

296
0:15:33.965,000 --> 0:15:35,000
We are the most in-debt ...

297
0:15:38.538,000 --> 0:15:39,000
obese ...

298
0:15:40.91,000 --> 0:15:44,000
addicted and medicated adult cohort in U.S. history.

299
0:15:48.315,000 --> 0:15:51,000
The problem is -- and I learned this from the research --

300
0:15:51.609,000 --> 0:15:54,000
that you cannot selectively numb emotion.

301
0:15:55.291,000 --> 0:15:57,000
You can't say, here's the bad stuff.

302
0:15:58.427,000 --> 0:16:,000
Here's vulnerability, here's grief, here's shame,

303
0:16:00.827,000 --> 0:16:01,000
here's fear, here's disappointment.

304
0:16:02.527,000 --> 0:16:03,000
I don't want to feel these.

305
0:16:04.427,000 --> 0:16:06,000
I'm going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin.

306
0:16:07.333,000 --> 0:16:09,000
(Laughter)

307
0:16:10.043,000 --> 0:16:11,000
I don't want to feel these.

308
0:16:11.936,000 --> 0:16:12,000
And I know that's knowing laughter.

309
0:16:13.936,000 --> 0:16:15,000
I hack into your lives for a living.

310
0:16:16.427,000 --> 0:16:17,000
God.

311
0:16:18.427,000 --> 0:16:2,000
(Laughter)

312
0:16:20.998,000 --> 0:16:22,000
You can't numb those hard feelings

313
0:16:23.78,000 --> 0:16:25,000
without numbing the other affects, our emotions.

314
0:16:26.438,000 --> 0:16:27,000
You cannot selectively numb.

315
0:16:27.914,000 --> 0:16:29,000
So when we numb those,

316
0:16:30.545,000 --> 0:16:32,000
we numb joy,

317
0:16:33.092,000 --> 0:16:34,000
we numb gratitude,

318
0:16:34.427,000 --> 0:16:35,000
we numb happiness.

319
0:16:37.148,000 --> 0:16:4,000
And then, we are miserable,

320
0:16:40.295,000 --> 0:16:42,000
and we are looking for purpose and meaning,

321
0:16:42.328,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and then we feel vulnerable,

322
0:16:43.784,000 --> 0:16:45,000
so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin.

323
0:16:46.616,000 --> 0:16:49,000
And it becomes this dangerous cycle.

324
0:16:51.087,000 --> 0:16:54,000
One of the things that I think we need to think about

325
0:16:54.244,000 --> 0:16:55,000
is why and how we numb.

326
0:16:56.928,000 --> 0:16:58,000
And it doesn't just have to be addiction.

327
0:17:00.477,000 --> 0:17:03,000
The other thing we do is we make everything that's uncertain certain.

328
0:17:05.427,000 --> 0:17:1,000
Religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty.

329
0:17:10.537,000 --> 0:17:11,000
"I'm right, you're wrong. Shut up."

330
0:17:14.187,000 --> 0:17:15,000
That's it.

331
0:17:16.611,000 --> 0:17:17,000
Just certain.

332
0:17:18.34,000 --> 0:17:2,000
The more afraid we are, the more vulnerable we are,

333
0:17:20.78,000 --> 0:17:21,000
the more afraid we are.

334
0:17:22.189,000 --> 0:17:24,000
This is what politics looks like today.

335
0:17:24.22,000 --> 0:17:25,000
There's no discourse anymore.

336
0:17:25.919,000 --> 0:17:26,000
There's no conversation.

337
0:17:27.807,000 --> 0:17:28,000
There's just blame.

338
0:17:29.055,000 --> 0:17:31,000
You know how blame is described in the research?

339
0:17:32.553,000 --> 0:17:34,000
A way to discharge pain and discomfort.

340
0:17:37.616,000 --> 0:17:38,000
We perfect.

341
0:17:38.83,000 --> 0:17:41,000
If there's anyone who wants their life to look like this, it would be me,

342
0:17:42.632,000 --> 0:17:43,000
but it doesn't work.

343
0:17:43.883,000 --> 0:17:46,000
Because what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks.

344
0:17:47.527,000 --> 0:17:5,000
(Laughter)

345
0:17:50.99,000 --> 0:17:53,000
Which just, I hope in 100 years, people will look back and go, "Wow."

346
0:17:54.427,000 --> 0:17:56,000
(Laughter)

347
0:17:56.974,000 --> 0:17:59,000
And we perfect, most dangerously, our children.

348
0:18:00.427,000 --> 0:18:02,000
Let me tell you what we think about children.

349
0:18:02.594,000 --> 0:18:04,000
They're hardwired for struggle when they get here.

350
0:18:05.427,000 --> 0:18:07,000
And when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand,

351
0:18:08.333,000 --> 0:18:1,000
our job is not to say, "Look at her, she's perfect.

352
0:18:11.315,000 --> 0:18:12,000
My job is just to keep her perfect --

353
0:18:13.235,000 --> 0:18:16,000
make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and Yale by seventh."

354
0:18:16.666,000 --> 0:18:17,000
That's not our job.

355
0:18:17.927,000 --> 0:18:18,000
Our job is to look and say,

356
0:18:19.56,000 --> 0:18:22,000
"You know what? You're imperfect, and you're wired for struggle,

357
0:18:22.6,000 --> 0:18:24,000
but you are worthy of love and belonging."

358
0:18:25.501,000 --> 0:18:26,000
That's our job.

359
0:18:27.104,000 --> 0:18:29,000
Show me a generation of kids raised like that,

360
0:18:29.358,000 --> 0:18:31,000
and we'll end the problems, I think, that we see today.

361
0:18:31.983,000 --> 0:18:36,000
We pretend that what we do doesn't have an effect on people.

362
0:18:38.871,000 --> 0:18:39,000
We do that in our personal lives.

363
0:18:40.529,000 --> 0:18:41,000
We do that corporate --

364
0:18:41.776,000 --> 0:18:43,000
whether it's a bailout, an oil spill ...

365
0:18:45.386,000 --> 0:18:46,000
a recall.

366
0:18:46.57,000 --> 0:18:47,000
We pretend like what we're doing

367
0:18:48.571,000 --> 0:18:5,000
doesn't have a huge impact on other people.

368
0:18:51.427,000 --> 0:18:54,000
I would say to companies, this is not our first rodeo, people.

369
0:18:55.769,000 --> 0:18:57,000
We just need you to be authentic and real and say ...

370
0:18:59.919,000 --> 0:19:01,000
"We're sorry. We'll fix it."

371
0:19:05.535,000 --> 0:19:07,000
But there's another way, and I'll leave you with this.

372
0:19:08.331,000 --> 0:19:09,000
This is what I have found:

373
0:19:09.736,000 --> 0:19:13,000
To let ourselves be seen, deeply seen, vulnerably seen ...

374
0:19:16.891,000 --> 0:19:2,000
to love with our whole hearts, even though there's no guarantee --

375
0:19:21.304,000 --> 0:19:22,000
and that's really hard,

376
0:19:22.582,000 --> 0:19:25,000
and I can tell you as a parent, that's excruciatingly difficult --

377
0:19:28.495,000 --> 0:19:32,000
to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror,

378
0:19:32.701,000 --> 0:19:34,000
when we're wondering, "Can I love you this much?

379
0:19:35.038,000 --> 0:19:37,000
Can I believe in this this passionately?

380
0:19:37.248,000 --> 0:19:38,000
Can I be this fierce about this?"

381
0:19:39.202,000 --> 0:19:42,000
just to be able to stop and, instead of catastrophizing what might happen,

382
0:19:42.803,000 --> 0:19:43,000
to say, "I'm just so grateful,

383
0:19:44.804,000 --> 0:19:46,000
because to feel this vulnerable means I'm alive."

384
0:19:48.748,000 --> 0:19:51,000
And the last, which I think is probably the most important,

385
0:19:52.434,000 --> 0:19:53,000
is to believe that we're enough.

386
0:19:54.664,000 --> 0:19:57,000
Because when we work from a place, I believe, that says, "I'm enough" ...

387
0:20:00.743,000 --> 0:20:03,000
then we stop screaming and start listening,

388
0:20:04.735,000 --> 0:20:06,000
we're kinder and gentler to the people around us,

389
0:20:07.086,000 --> 0:20:09,000
and we're kinder and gentler to ourselves.

390
0:20:10.125,000 --> 0:20:11,000
That's all I have. Thank you.

391
0:20:11.627,000 --> 0:20:13,000
(Applause)

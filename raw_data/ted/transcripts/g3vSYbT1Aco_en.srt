1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:15,000
If you ask evolutionary biologists

2
0:00:15.84,000 --> 0:00:18,000
when did humans become humans,

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
some of them will say that,

4
0:00:21.28,000 --> 0:00:23,000
well, at some point we started standing on our feet,

5
0:00:24.2,000 --> 0:00:27,000
became biped and became the masters of our environment.

6
0:00:28.88,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Others will say that because our brain started growing much bigger,

7
0:00:34.2,000 --> 0:00:37,000
that we were able to have much more complex cognitive processes.

8
0:00:38.68,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And others might argue that it's because we developed language

9
0:00:43.08,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that allowed us to evolve as a species.

10
0:00:46.96,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Interestingly, those three phenomena are all connected.

11
0:00:51.52,000 --> 0:00:53,000
We are not sure how or in which order,

12
0:00:54.32,000 --> 0:00:55,000
but they are all linked

13
0:00:55.88,000 --> 0:00:58,000
with the change of shape of a little bone in the back of your neck

14
0:01:00.84,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that changed the angle between our head and our body.

15
0:01:04.76,000 --> 0:01:07,000
That means we were able to stand upright

16
0:01:07.84,000 --> 0:01:1,000
but also for our brain to evolve in the back

17
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and for our voice box to grow from seven centimeters for primates

18
0:01:16.64,000 --> 0:01:19,000
to 11 and up to 17 centimetres for humans.

19
0:01:21.08,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And this is called the descent of the larynx.

20
0:01:24.28,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And the larynx is the site of your voice.

21
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
When baby humans are born today, their larynx is not descended yet.

22
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
That only happens at about three months old.

23
0:01:37.04,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So, metaphorically, each of us here

24
0:01:39.32,000 --> 0:01:42,000
has relived the evolution of our whole species.

25
0:01:44.88,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And talking about babies,

26
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
when you were starting to develop in your mother's womb,

27
0:01:49.6,000 --> 0:01:53,000
the first sensation that you had coming from the outside world,

28
0:01:53.84,000 --> 0:01:56,000
at only three weeks old, when you were about the size of a shrimp,

29
0:01:57.8,000 --> 0:01:59,000
were through the tactile sensation

30
0:02:00.52,000 --> 0:02:02,000
coming from the vibrations of your mother's voice.

31
0:02:04.44,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So, as we can see, the human voice is quite meaningful and important

32
0:02:09.44,000 --> 0:02:11,000
at the level of the species,

33
0:02:12.44,000 --> 0:02:13,000
at the level of the society --

34
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:16,000
this is how we communicate and create bonds,

35
0:02:16.96,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and at the personal and interpersonal levels --

36
0:02:20.44,000 --> 0:02:23,000
with our voice, we share much more than words and data,

37
0:02:23.6,000 --> 0:02:25,000
we share basically who we are.

38
0:02:25.76,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And our voice is indistinguishable from how other people see us.

39
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
It is a mask that we wear in society.

40
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:36,000
But our relationship with our own voice is far from obvious.

41
0:02:37.84,000 --> 0:02:41,000
We rarely use our voice for ourselves; we use it as a gift to give to others.

42
0:02:42.64,000 --> 0:02:45,000
It is how we touch each other.

43
0:02:45.84,000 --> 0:02:46,000
It's a dialectical grooming.

44
0:02:47.8,000 --> 0:02:49,000
But what do we think about our own voice?

45
0:02:50.24,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So please raise your hand

46
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:56,000
if you don't like the sound of your voice when you hear it on a recording machine.

47
0:02:56.04,000 --> 0:02:57,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:57.28,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Yeah, thank you, indeed,

49
0:02:58.52,000 --> 0:03:01,000
most people report not liking the sound of their voice recording.

50
0:03:02.44,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So what does that mean?

51
0:03:03.68,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Let's try to understand that in the next 10 minutes.

52
0:03:06.4,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I'm a researcher at the MIT Media Lab,

53
0:03:09.52,000 --> 0:03:1,000
part of the Opera of the Future group,

54
0:03:12.2,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and my research focuses on the relationship

55
0:03:15.28,000 --> 0:03:18,000
people have with their own voice and with the voices of others.

56
0:03:19.76,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I study what we can learn from listening to voices,

57
0:03:23.84,000 --> 0:03:24,000
from the various fields,

58
0:03:25.24,000 --> 0:03:28,000
from neurology to biology, cognitive sciences, linguistics.

59
0:03:30.68,000 --> 0:03:33,000
In our group we create tools and experiences

60
0:03:33.76,000 --> 0:03:37,000
to help people gain a better applied understanding of their voice

61
0:03:38.52,000 --> 0:03:41,000
in order to reduce the biases,

62
0:03:41.6,000 --> 0:03:43,000
to become better listeners,

63
0:03:43.72,000 --> 0:03:45,000
to create more healthy relationships

64
0:03:46.72,000 --> 0:03:48,000
or just to understand themselves better.

65
0:03:50.24,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And this really has to come with a holistic approach on the voice.

66
0:03:55.64,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Because, think about all the applications and implications

67
0:03:59.28,000 --> 0:04:01,000
that the voice may have, as we discover more about it.

68
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Your voice is a very complex phenomenon.

69
0:04:06.32,000 --> 0:04:09,000
It requires a synchronization of more than 100 muscles in your body.

70
0:04:10.48,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And by listening to the voice,

71
0:04:12.88,000 --> 0:04:16,000
we can understand possible failures of what happens inside.

72
0:04:17.68,000 --> 0:04:18,000
For example:

73
0:04:19.84,000 --> 0:04:22,000
listening to very specific types of turbulences

74
0:04:23.36,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and nonlinearity of the voice

75
0:04:25.68,000 --> 0:04:28,000
can help predict very early stages of Parkinson's,

76
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
just through a phone call.

77
0:04:31.519,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Listening to the breathlessness of the voice

78
0:04:34.17,000 --> 0:04:35,000
can help detect heart disease.

79
0:04:37.88,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And we also know that the changes of tempo inside individual words

80
0:04:42.52,000 --> 0:04:44,000
is a very good marker of depression.

81
0:04:46.32,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Your voice is also very linked with your hormone levels.

82
0:04:49.4,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Third parties listening to female voices

83
0:04:52.04,000 --> 0:04:55,000
were able to very accurately place the speaker

84
0:04:55.08,000 --> 0:04:56,000
on their menstrual cycle.

85
0:04:57.56,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Just with acoustic information.

86
0:05:00.8,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And now with technology listening to us all the time,

87
0:05:04.4,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Alexa from Amazon Echo

88
0:05:07.4,000 --> 0:05:09,000
might be able to predict if you're pregnant

89
0:05:09.84,000 --> 0:05:1,000
even before you know it.

90
0:05:11.56,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So think about --

91
0:05:12.92,000 --> 0:05:13,000
(Laughter)

92
0:05:14.12,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Think about the ethical implications of that.

93
0:05:17.72,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Your voice is also very linked to how you create relationships.

94
0:05:20.84,000 --> 0:05:23,000
You have a different voice for every person you talk to.

95
0:05:24.24,000 --> 0:05:27,000
If I take a little snippet of your voice and I analyze it,

96
0:05:27.76,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I can know whether you're talking to your mother, to your brother,

97
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
your friend or your boss.

98
0:05:32.8,000 --> 0:05:37,000
We can also use, as a predictor, the vocal posture.

99
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Meaning, how you decide to place your voice when you talk to someone.

100
0:05:41.96,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And you vocal posture, when you talk to your spouse,

101
0:05:45.2,000 --> 0:05:48,000
can help predict not only if, but also when you will divorce.

102
0:05:50.56,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So there is a lot to learn from listening to voices.

103
0:05:54.08,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And I believe this has to start with understanding

104
0:05:56.48,000 --> 0:05:58,000
that we have more than one voice.

105
0:05:58.52,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So, I'm going to talk about three voices that most of us posses,

106
0:06:02.4,000 --> 0:06:04,000
in a model of what I call the mask.

107
0:06:05.52,000 --> 0:06:06,000
So when you look at the mask,

108
0:06:07.52,000 --> 0:06:09,000
what you see is a projection of a character.

109
0:06:10.36,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Let's call that your outward voice.

110
0:06:12.52,000 --> 0:06:14,000
This is also the most classic way to think about the voice,

111
0:06:15.36,000 --> 0:06:17,000
it's a way of projecting yourself in the world.

112
0:06:18.28,000 --> 0:06:21,000
The mechanism for this projection is well understood.

113
0:06:21.56,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Your lungs contract your diaphragm

114
0:06:23.92,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and that creates a self-sustained vibration of your vocal fold,

115
0:06:27.2,000 --> 0:06:28,000
that creates a sound.

116
0:06:28.72,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And then the way you open and close the cavities in you mouth,

117
0:06:31.92,000 --> 0:06:33,000
your vocal tract is going to transform the sound.

118
0:06:34.64,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So everyone has the same mechanism.

119
0:06:36.88,000 --> 0:06:37,000
But voices are quite unique.

120
0:06:38.68,000 --> 0:06:43,000
It's because very subtle differences in size, physiology, in hormone levels

121
0:06:44.48,000 --> 0:06:47,000
are going to make very subtle differences in your outward voice.

122
0:06:48.84,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And your brain is very good

123
0:06:50.88,000 --> 0:06:53,000
at picking up those subtle differences from other people's outward voices.

124
0:06:55.76,000 --> 0:06:58,000
In our lab, we are working on teaching machines

125
0:06:59.04,000 --> 0:07:01,000
to understand those subtle differences.

126
0:07:01.48,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And we use deep learning to create a real-time speaker identification system

127
0:07:07.36,000 --> 0:07:11,000
to help raise awareness on the use of the shared vocal space --

128
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
so who talks and who never talks during meetings --

129
0:07:15.48,000 --> 0:07:16,000
to increase group intelligence.

130
0:07:17.96,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And one of the difficulties with that is that your voice is also not static.

131
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:26,000
We already said that it changes with every person you talk to

132
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
but it also changes generally throughout your life.

133
0:07:29.12,000 --> 0:07:31,000
At the beginning and at the end of the journey,

134
0:07:31.36,000 --> 0:07:33,000
male and female voices are very similar.

135
0:07:34.08,000 --> 0:07:35,000
It's very hard to distinguish

136
0:07:35.64,000 --> 0:07:38,000
the voice of a very young girl from the voice of a very young boy.

137
0:07:40.28,000 --> 0:07:45,000
But in between, your voice becomes a marker of your fluid identity.

138
0:07:45.4,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Generally, for male voices there's a big change at puberty.

139
0:07:49.36,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And then for female voices,

140
0:07:50.72,000 --> 0:07:53,000
there is a change at each pregnancy and a big change at menopause.

141
0:07:55.32,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So all of that is the voice other people hear when you talk.

142
0:07:59.48,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So why is it that we're so unfamiliar with it?

143
0:08:03.6,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Why is it that it's not the voice that we hear?

144
0:08:07.04,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So, let's think about it.

145
0:08:08.28,000 --> 0:08:11,000
When you wear a mask, you actually don't see the mask.

146
0:08:12.64,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And when you try to observe it, what you will see is inside of the mask.

147
0:08:17.24,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And that's your inward voice.

148
0:08:20.56,000 --> 0:08:22,000
So to understand why it's different,

149
0:08:22.6,000 --> 0:08:25,000
let's try to understand the mechanism of perception of this inward voice.

150
0:08:27.56,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Because your body has many ways of filtering it differently

151
0:08:30.52,000 --> 0:08:32,000
from the outward voice.

152
0:08:32.56,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So to perceive this voice, it first has to travel to your ears.

153
0:08:36.08,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And your outward voice travels through the air

154
0:08:38.68,000 --> 0:08:41,000
while your inward voice travels through your bones.

155
0:08:42.2,000 --> 0:08:43,000
This is called bone conduction.

156
0:08:44.64,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Because of this, your inward voice is going to sound in a lower register

157
0:08:49.679,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and also more musically harmonical than your outward voice.

158
0:08:55.4,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Once it travels there, it has to access your inner ear.

159
0:08:59.32,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And there's this other mechanism taking place here.

160
0:09:01.76,000 --> 0:09:03,000
It's a mechanical filter,

161
0:09:03.88,000 --> 0:09:06,000
it's a little partition that comes and protects your inner ear

162
0:09:07.44,000 --> 0:09:09,000
each time you produce a sound.

163
0:09:10.2,000 --> 0:09:12,000
So it also reduces what you hear.

164
0:09:13.24,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And then there is a third filter, it's a biological filter.

165
0:09:16.88,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Your cochlea -- it's a part of your inner ear that processes the sound --

166
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
is made out of living cells.

167
0:09:23.24,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And those living cells are going to trigger differently

168
0:09:26.36,000 --> 0:09:28,000
according to how often they hear the sound.

169
0:09:28.96,000 --> 0:09:29,000
It's a habituation effect.

170
0:09:31.4,000 --> 0:09:32,000
So because of this,

171
0:09:32.96,000 --> 0:09:35,000
as your voice is the sound you hear the most in your life,

172
0:09:36.04,000 --> 0:09:38,000
you actually hear it less than other sounds.

173
0:09:39.28,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Finally, we have a fourth filter.

174
0:09:41.32,000 --> 0:09:42,000
It's a neurological filter.

175
0:09:43.76,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Neurologists found out recently

176
0:09:46.24,000 --> 0:09:48,000
that when you open your mouth to create a sound,

177
0:09:49.04,000 --> 0:09:51,000
your own auditory cortex shuts down.

178
0:09:54.4,000 --> 0:09:56,000
So you hear your voice

179
0:09:57.32,000 --> 0:10:01,000
but your brain actually never listens to the sound of your voice.

180
0:10:04.04,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Well, evolutionarily that might make sense,

181
0:10:06.6,000 --> 0:10:08,000
because we know cognitively what we are going to sound like

182
0:10:09.6,000 --> 0:10:12,000
so maybe we don't need to spend energy analyzing the signal.

183
0:10:13.56,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And this is called a corollary discharge

184
0:10:17.24,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and it happens for every motion that your body does.

185
0:10:19.76,000 --> 0:10:21,000
The exact definition of a corollary discharge

186
0:10:22,000 --> 0:10:27,000
is a copy of a motor command that is sent by the brain.

187
0:10:27.28,000 --> 0:10:29,000
This copy doesn't create any motion itself

188
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:33,000
but instead is sent to other regions of the brain

189
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:36,000
to inform them of the impending motion.

190
0:10:38.12,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And for the voice, this corollary discharge also has a different name.

191
0:10:42.48,000 --> 0:10:44,000
It is your inner voice.

192
0:10:44.6,000 --> 0:10:45,000
So let's recapitulate.

193
0:10:46.44,000 --> 0:10:48,000
We have the mask, the outward voice,

194
0:10:48.52,000 --> 0:10:51,000
the inside of the mask, your inward voice,

195
0:10:51.64,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and then you have your inner voice.

196
0:10:53.68,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And I like to see this one as the puppeteer

197
0:10:55.76,000 --> 0:10:57,000
that holds the strings of the whole system.

198
0:10:59.44,000 --> 0:11:,000
Your inner voice is

199
0:11:01.08,000 --> 0:11:03,000
the one you hear when you read a text silently,

200
0:11:05.32,000 --> 0:11:07,000
when you rehearse for an important conversation.

201
0:11:08.76,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Sometimes is hard to turn it off,

202
0:11:10.4,000 --> 0:11:14,000
it's really hard to look at the text written in your native language,

203
0:11:14.48,000 --> 0:11:16,000
without having this inner voice read it.

204
0:11:17.8,000 --> 0:11:19,000
It's also the voice that refuse to stop singing

205
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
the stupid song you have in your head.

206
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:23,000
(Laughter)

207
0:11:25.28,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And for some people it's actually impossible to control it.

208
0:11:29,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And that's the case of schizophrenic patients,

209
0:11:31.76,000 --> 0:11:33,000
who have auditory hallucinations.

210
0:11:33.8,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Who can't distinguish at all between voices coming from inside

211
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and outside their head.

212
0:11:38.68,000 --> 0:11:41,000
So in our lab, we are also working on small devices

213
0:11:42.08,000 --> 0:11:44,000
to help those people make those distinctions

214
0:11:44.64,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and know if a voice is internal or external.

215
0:11:48.76,000 --> 0:11:52,000
You can also think about the inner voice as the voice that speaks in your dream.

216
0:11:53.12,000 --> 0:11:55,000
This inner voice can take many forms.

217
0:11:55.24,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And in your dreams, you actually unleash the potential of this inner voice.

218
0:11:59.48,000 --> 0:12:01,000
That's another work we are doing in our lab:

219
0:12:01.56,000 --> 0:12:04,000
trying to access this inner voice in dreams.

220
0:12:06.28,000 --> 0:12:08,000
So even if you can't always control it,

221
0:12:08.6,000 --> 0:12:1,000
the inner voice -- you can always engage with it

222
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
through dialogue, through inner dialogues.

223
0:12:13.52,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And you can even see this inner voice

224
0:12:15.36,000 --> 0:12:17,000
as the missing link between thought and actions.

225
0:12:20.64,000 --> 0:12:23,000
So I hope I've left you with a better appreciation,

226
0:12:23.8,000 --> 0:12:26,000
a new appreciation of all of your voices

227
0:12:27.28,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and the role it plays inside and outside of you --

228
0:12:29.84,000 --> 0:12:33,000
as your voice is a very critical determinant of what makes you humans

229
0:12:34.28,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and of how you interact with the world.

230
0:12:37.12,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Thank you.

231
0:12:38.36,000 --> 0:12:4,000
(Applause)

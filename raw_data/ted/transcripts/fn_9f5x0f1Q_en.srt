1
0:00:15.704,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I think I'll start out and just talk a little bit

2
0:00:18.174,000 --> 0:00:19,000
about what exactly autism is.

3
0:00:19.689,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Autism is a very big continuum

4
0:00:22.348,000 --> 0:00:25,000
that goes from very severe -- the child remains nonverbal --

5
0:00:25.546,000 --> 0:00:27,000
all the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And I actually feel at home here,

7
0:00:30.261,000 --> 0:00:32,000
because there's a lot of autism genetics here.

8
0:00:32.831,000 --> 0:00:33,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:33.887,000 --> 0:00:34,000
You wouldn't have any --

10
0:00:35.069,000 --> 0:00:37,000
(Applause)

11
0:00:38.062,000 --> 0:00:4,000
It's a continuum of traits.

12
0:00:40.122,000 --> 0:00:45,000
When does a nerd turn into Asperger, which is just mild autism?

13
0:00:45.803,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I mean, Einstein and Mozart and Tesla would all be probably diagnosed

14
0:00:50.985,000 --> 0:00:51,000
as autistic spectrum today.

15
0:00:52.901,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And one of the things that is really going to concern me

16
0:00:56.216,000 --> 0:00:58,000
is getting these kids to be the ones

17
0:00:58.475,000 --> 0:01:,000
that are going to invent the next energy things

18
0:01:01.321,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that Bill Gates talked about this morning.

19
0:01:04.058,000 --> 0:01:07,000
OK, now, if you want to understand autism: animals.

20
0:01:07.995,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I want to talk to you now about different ways of thinking.

21
0:01:10.909,000 --> 0:01:12,000
You have to get away from verbal language.

22
0:01:13.783,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I think in pictures. I don't think in language.

23
0:01:18.082,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Now, the thing about the autistic mind is it attends to details.

24
0:01:23.376,000 --> 0:01:26,000
This is a test where you either have to pick out the big letters

25
0:01:26.455,000 --> 0:01:27,000
or the little letters,

26
0:01:27.702,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and the autistic mind picks out the little letters more quickly.

27
0:01:31.947,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And the thing is, the normal brain ignores the details.

28
0:01:35.722,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Well, if you're building a bridge, details are pretty important

29
0:01:38.756,000 --> 0:01:4,000
because it'll fall down if you ignore the details.

30
0:01:41.178,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And one of my big concerns with a lot of policy things today

31
0:01:44.069,000 --> 0:01:45,000
is things are getting too abstract.

32
0:01:45.771,000 --> 0:01:48,000
People are getting away from doing hands-on stuff.

33
0:01:49.022,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I'm really concerned that a lot of the schools

34
0:01:51.206,000 --> 0:01:54,000
have taken out the hands-on classes, because art, and classes like that --

35
0:01:55.198,000 --> 0:01:57,000
those are the classes where I excelled.

36
0:01:57.535,000 --> 0:01:59,000
In my work with cattle,

37
0:01:59.713,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I noticed a lot of little things that most people don't notice

38
0:02:02.715,000 --> 0:02:03,000
would make the cattle balk.

39
0:02:04.027,000 --> 0:02:07,000
For example, this flag waving right in front of the veterinary facility.

40
0:02:07.598,000 --> 0:02:1,000
This feed yard was going to tear down their whole veterinary facility;

41
0:02:10.949,000 --> 0:02:11,000
all they needed to do was move the flag.

42
0:02:12.887,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Rapid movement, contrast.

43
0:02:14.979,000 --> 0:02:17,000
In the early '70s when I started, I got right down in the chutes

44
0:02:18.037,000 --> 0:02:19,000
to see what cattle were seeing.

45
0:02:19.56,000 --> 0:02:2,000
People thought that was crazy.

46
0:02:21.046,000 --> 0:02:24,000
A coat on a fence would make them balk, shadows would make them balk,

47
0:02:24.352,000 --> 0:02:27,000
a hose on the floor -- people weren't noticing these things.

48
0:02:27.44,000 --> 0:02:28,000
A chain hanging down ...

49
0:02:28.98,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And that's shown very, very nicely in the movie.

50
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
In fact, I loved the movie, how they duplicated all my projects.

51
0:02:34.739,000 --> 0:02:35,000
That's the geek side.

52
0:02:36.104,000 --> 0:02:38,000
My drawings got to star in the movie, too.

53
0:02:38.548,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And, actually, it's called "Temple Grandin,"

54
0:02:40.682,000 --> 0:02:41,000
not "Thinking in Pictures."

55
0:02:42.03,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So what is thinking in pictures?

56
0:02:43.619,000 --> 0:02:45,000
It's literally movies in your head.

57
0:02:46.322,000 --> 0:02:48,000
My mind works like Google for images.

58
0:02:49.228,000 --> 0:02:52,000
When I was a young kid, I didn't know my thinking was different.

59
0:02:52.296,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I thought everybody thought in pictures.

60
0:02:54.239,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Then when I did my book, "Thinking in Pictures,"

61
0:02:56.518,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I started interviewing people about how they think.

62
0:02:58.954,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And I was shocked to find out that my thinking was quite different.

63
0:03:02.133,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Like if I say, "Think about a church steeple,"

64
0:03:04.333,000 --> 0:03:06,000
most people get this sort of generalized generic one.

65
0:03:06.87,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Now, maybe that's not true in this room,

66
0:03:08.806,000 --> 0:03:11,000
but it's going to be true in a lot of different places.

67
0:03:12.096,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I see only specific pictures.

68
0:03:14.623,000 --> 0:03:17,000
They flash up into my memory, just like Google for pictures.

69
0:03:18.456,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And in the movie, they've got a great scene in there,

70
0:03:21.023,000 --> 0:03:24,000
where the word "shoe" is said, and a whole bunch of '50s and '60s shoes

71
0:03:24.847,000 --> 0:03:25,000
pop into my imagination.

72
0:03:26.908,000 --> 0:03:28,000
OK, there's my childhood church; that's specific.

73
0:03:29.807,000 --> 0:03:3,000
There's some more, Fort Collins.

74
0:03:31.699,000 --> 0:03:33,000
OK, how about famous ones?

75
0:03:33.77,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And they just kind of come up, kind of like this.

76
0:03:36.471,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Just really quickly, like Google for pictures.

77
0:03:39.406,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And they come up one at a time,

78
0:03:40.989,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and then I think, "OK, well, maybe we can have it snow,

79
0:03:43.964,000 --> 0:03:44,000
or we can have a thunderstorm,"

80
0:03:45.612,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and I can hold it there and turn them into videos.

81
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Now, visual thinking was a tremendous asset

82
0:03:51.497,000 --> 0:03:53,000
in my work designing cattle-handling facilities.

83
0:03:54.799,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And I've worked really hard on improving how cattle are treated

84
0:03:58.023,000 --> 0:03:59,000
at the slaughter plant.

85
0:03:59.199,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I'm not going to go into any gucky slaughter slides.

86
0:04:01.719,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I've got that stuff up on YouTube, if you want to look at it.

87
0:04:04.631,000 --> 0:04:05,000
(Laughter)

88
0:04:05.696,000 --> 0:04:07,000
But one of the things that I was able to do in my design work

89
0:04:08.613,000 --> 0:04:1,000
is I could test-run a piece of equipment in my mind,

90
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
just like a virtual reality computer system.

91
0:04:14.708,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And this is an aerial view of a recreation of one of my projects

92
0:04:18.373,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that was used in the movie.

93
0:04:19.759,000 --> 0:04:21,000
That was like just so super cool.

94
0:04:21.794,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And there were a lot of, kind of, Asperger types and autism types

95
0:04:25.296,000 --> 0:04:26,000
working out there on the movie set, too.

96
0:04:27.268,000 --> 0:04:28,000
(Laughter)

97
0:04:28.468,000 --> 0:04:3,000
But one of the things that really worries me is:

98
0:04:31.283,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Where's the younger version of those kids going today?

99
0:04:34.82,000 --> 0:04:36,000
They're not ending up in Silicon Valley,

100
0:04:37.299,000 --> 0:04:38,000
where they belong.

101
0:04:38.563,000 --> 0:04:39,000
(Laughter)

102
0:04:40.407,000 --> 0:04:44,000
(Applause)

103
0:04:45.339,000 --> 0:04:48,000
One of the things I learned very early on because I wasn't that social,

104
0:04:48.944,000 --> 0:04:51,000
is I had to sell my work, and not myself.

105
0:04:52.706,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And the way I sold livestock jobs is I showed off my drawings,

106
0:04:55.69,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I showed off pictures of things.

107
0:04:57.446,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Another thing that helped me as a little kid

108
0:04:59.709,000 --> 0:05:01,000
is, boy, in the '50s, you were taught manners.

109
0:05:01.962,000 --> 0:05:04,000
You were taught you can't pull the merchandise off the shelves

110
0:05:05.025,000 --> 0:05:06,000
in the store and throw it around.

111
0:05:06.683,000 --> 0:05:08,000
When kids get to be in third or fourth grade,

112
0:05:08.859,000 --> 0:05:1,000
you might see that this kid's going to be a visual thinker,

113
0:05:11.711,000 --> 0:05:12,000
drawing in perspective.

114
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Now, I want to emphasize

115
0:05:14.222,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that not every autistic kid is going to be a visual thinker.

116
0:05:17.712,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Now, I had this brain scan done several years ago,

117
0:05:21.714,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and I used to joke around about having a gigantic Internet trunk line

118
0:05:25.671,000 --> 0:05:26,000
going deep into my visual cortex.

119
0:05:27.622,000 --> 0:05:28,000
This is tensor imaging.

120
0:05:29.521,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And my great big Internet trunk line is twice as big as the control's.

121
0:05:33.397,000 --> 0:05:34,000
The red lines there are me,

122
0:05:35.025,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and the blue lines are the sex and age-matched control.

123
0:05:39.85,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And there I got a gigantic one,

124
0:05:41.896,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and the control over there, the blue one, has got a really small one.

125
0:05:47.101,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And some of the research now is showing

126
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that people on the spectrum actually think with the primary visual cortex.

127
0:05:53.315,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Now, the thing is, the visual thinker is just one kind of mind.

128
0:05:56.38,000 --> 0:05:59,000
You see, the autistic mind tends to be a specialist mind --

129
0:05:59.989,000 --> 0:06:01,000
good at one thing, bad at something else.

130
0:06:03.102,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And where I was bad was algebra.

131
0:06:04.88,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And I was never allowed to take geometry or trig.

132
0:06:07.194,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Gigantic mistake.

133
0:06:08.381,000 --> 0:06:1,000
I'm finding a lot of kids who need to skip algebra,

134
0:06:10.84,000 --> 0:06:11,000
go right to geometry and trig.

135
0:06:12.847,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Now, another kind of mind is the pattern thinker.

136
0:06:15.471,000 --> 0:06:16,000
More abstract.

137
0:06:16.734,000 --> 0:06:18,000
These are your engineers, your computer programmers.

138
0:06:19.321,000 --> 0:06:2,000
This is pattern thinking.

139
0:06:20.739,000 --> 0:06:22,000
That praying mantis is made from a single sheet of paper --

140
0:06:23.648,000 --> 0:06:24,000
no scotch tape, no cuts.

141
0:06:25.089,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And there in the background is the pattern for folding it.

142
0:06:28.648,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Here are the types of thinking:

143
0:06:30.731,000 --> 0:06:32,000
photo-realistic visual thinkers, like me;

144
0:06:33.856,000 --> 0:06:36,000
pattern thinkers, music and math minds.

145
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Some of these oftentimes have problems with reading.

146
0:06:39.872,000 --> 0:06:43,000
You also will see these kind of problems with kids that are dyslexic.

147
0:06:44.377,000 --> 0:06:46,000
You'll see these different kinds of minds.

148
0:06:46.425,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And then there's a verbal mind, they know every fact about everything.

149
0:06:50.023,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Now, another thing is the sensory issues.

150
0:06:52.013,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I was really concerned about having to wear this gadget on my face.

151
0:06:55.692,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And I came in half an hour beforehand

152
0:06:57.87,000 --> 0:06:59,000
so I could have it put on and kind of get used to it,

153
0:07:00.877,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and they got it bent so it's not hitting my chin.

154
0:07:03.639,000 --> 0:07:04,000
But sensory is an issue.

155
0:07:04.815,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Some kids are bothered by fluorescent lights;

156
0:07:06.988,000 --> 0:07:08,000
others have problems with sound sensitivity.

157
0:07:09.497,000 --> 0:07:11,000
You know, it's going to be variable.

158
0:07:12.652,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Now, visual thinking gave me a whole lot of insight

159
0:07:16.096,000 --> 0:07:18,000
into the animal mind.

160
0:07:18.38,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Because think about it: an animal is a sensory-based thinker,

161
0:07:21.837,000 --> 0:07:27,000
not verbal -- thinks in pictures, thinks in sounds, thinks in smells.

162
0:07:28.058,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Think about how much information there is on the local fire hydrant.

163
0:07:31.426,000 --> 0:07:32,000
He knows who's been there --

164
0:07:32.812,000 --> 0:07:33,000
(Laughter)

165
0:07:33.867,000 --> 0:07:34,000
When they were there.

166
0:07:35.048,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Are they friend or foe? Is there anybody he can go mate with?

167
0:07:37.967,000 --> 0:07:39,000
There's a ton of information on that fire hydrant.

168
0:07:40.873,000 --> 0:07:42,000
It's all very detailed information.

169
0:07:43.996,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And looking at these kind of details gave me a lot of insight into animals.

170
0:07:48.688,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Now, the animal mind, and also my mind,

171
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
puts sensory-based information into categories.

172
0:07:56.853,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Man on a horse,

173
0:07:58.58,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and a man on the ground --

174
0:08:00.159,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that is viewed as two totally different things.

175
0:08:02.968,000 --> 0:08:04,000
You could have a horse that's been abused by a rider.

176
0:08:05.491,000 --> 0:08:07,000
They'll be absolutely fine with the veterinarian

177
0:08:07.785,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and with the horseshoer, but you can't ride him.

178
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
You have another horse, where maybe the horseshoer beat him up,

179
0:08:13.459,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and he'll be terrible for anything on the ground with the veterinarian,

180
0:08:17.478,000 --> 0:08:19,000
but a person can ride him.

181
0:08:19.517,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Cattle are the same way.

182
0:08:20.848,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Man on a horse, a man on foot -- they're two different things.

183
0:08:24.797,000 --> 0:08:25,000
You see, it's a different picture.

184
0:08:26.777,000 --> 0:08:29,000
See, I want you to think about just how specific this is.

185
0:08:29.922,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Now, this ability to put information into categories,

186
0:08:33.333,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I find a lot of people are not very good at this.

187
0:08:36.709,000 --> 0:08:38,000
When I'm out troubleshooting equipment

188
0:08:38.901,000 --> 0:08:39,000
or problems with something in a plant,

189
0:08:40.753,000 --> 0:08:42,000
they don't seem to be able to figure out:

190
0:08:42.782,000 --> 0:08:43,000
"Do I have a training-people issue?

191
0:08:44.506,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Or do I have something wrong with the equipment?"

192
0:08:46.965,000 --> 0:08:49,000
In other words, categorize equipment problem from a people problem.

193
0:08:50.683,000 --> 0:08:53,000
I find a lot of people have difficulty doing that.

194
0:08:53.803,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Now, let's say I figure out it's an equipment problem.

195
0:08:56.391,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Is it a minor problem, with something simple I can fix?

196
0:08:59.191,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Or is the whole design of the system wrong?

197
0:09:01.53,000 --> 0:09:03,000
People have a hard time figuring that out.

198
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Let's just look at something like, you know,

199
0:09:06.38,000 --> 0:09:08,000
solving problems with making airlines safer.

200
0:09:08.65,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Yeah, I'm a million-mile flier.

201
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
I do lots and lots of flying,

202
0:09:12.11,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and if I was at the FAA,

203
0:09:15.366,000 --> 0:09:18,000
what would I be doing a lot of direct observation of?

204
0:09:19.457,000 --> 0:09:21,000
It would be their airplane tails.

205
0:09:21.785,000 --> 0:09:23,000
You know, five fatal wrecks in the last 20 years,

206
0:09:24.359,000 --> 0:09:25,000
the tail either came off,

207
0:09:26.158,000 --> 0:09:29,000
or steering stuff inside the tail broke in some way.

208
0:09:30.007,000 --> 0:09:32,000
It's tails, pure and simple.

209
0:09:32.084,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And when the pilots walk around the plane, guess what?

210
0:09:34.641,000 --> 0:09:36,000
They can't see that stuff inside the tail.

211
0:09:36.716,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Now as I think about that,

212
0:09:38.177,000 --> 0:09:41,000
I'm pulling up all of that specific information.

213
0:09:41.66,000 --> 0:09:42,000
It's specific.

214
0:09:42.857,000 --> 0:09:43,000
See, my thinking's bottom-up.

215
0:09:44.376,000 --> 0:09:47,000
I take all the little pieces and I put the pieces together like a puzzle.

216
0:09:48.097,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Now, here is a horse that was deathly afraid of black cowboy hats.

217
0:09:51.888,000 --> 0:09:53,000
He'd been abused by somebody with a black cowboy hat.

218
0:09:54.472,000 --> 0:09:56,000
White cowboy hats, that was absolutely fine.

219
0:09:57.856,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Now, the thing is, the world is going to need

220
0:10:00.43,000 --> 0:10:04,000
all of the different kinds of minds to work together.

221
0:10:04.543,000 --> 0:10:07,000
We've got to work on developing all these different kinds of minds.

222
0:10:07.758,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And one of the things that is driving me really crazy

223
0:10:10.324,000 --> 0:10:12,000
as I travel around and I do autism meetings,

224
0:10:12.695,000 --> 0:10:15,000
is I'm seeing a lot of smart, geeky, nerdy kids,

225
0:10:15.86,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and they just aren't very social,

226
0:10:18.059,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and nobody's working on developing their interest

227
0:10:21.174,000 --> 0:10:22,000
in something like science.

228
0:10:22.926,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And this brings up the whole thing of my science teacher.

229
0:10:25.637,000 --> 0:10:28,000
My science teacher is shown absolutely beautifully in the movie.

230
0:10:28.769,000 --> 0:10:3,000
I was a goofball student when I was in high school.

231
0:10:31.279,000 --> 0:10:33,000
I just didn't care at all about studying,

232
0:10:33.331,000 --> 0:10:36,000
until I had Mr. Carlock's science class.

233
0:10:36.584,000 --> 0:10:38,000
He was now Dr. Carlock in the movie.

234
0:10:39.357,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And he got me challenged to figure out an optical illusion room.

235
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
This brings up the whole thing of you've got to show kids

236
0:10:47.999,000 --> 0:10:48,000
interesting stuff.

237
0:10:49.574,000 --> 0:10:52,000
You know, one of the things that I think maybe TED ought to do

238
0:10:52.911,000 --> 0:10:55,000
is tell all the schools about all the great lectures that are on TED,

239
0:10:56.25,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and there's all kinds of great stuff on the Internet

240
0:10:58.761,000 --> 0:10:59,000
to get these kids turned on.

241
0:11:00.157,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Because I'm seeing a lot of these geeky, nerdy kids,

242
0:11:02.667,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and the teachers out in the Midwest and other parts of the country

243
0:11:05.875,000 --> 0:11:06,000
when you get away from these tech areas,

244
0:11:07.837,000 --> 0:11:09,000
they don't know what to do with these kids.

245
0:11:09.873,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And they're not going down the right path.

246
0:11:11.918,000 --> 0:11:12,000
The thing is, you can make a mind

247
0:11:13.724,000 --> 0:11:15,000
to be more of a thinking and cognitive mind,

248
0:11:16.473,000 --> 0:11:18,000
or your mind can be wired to be more social.

249
0:11:18.972,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And what some of the research now has shown in autism

250
0:11:21.627,000 --> 0:11:24,000
is there may by extra wiring back here in the really brilliant mind,

251
0:11:25.121,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and we lose a few social circuits here.

252
0:11:27.058,000 --> 0:11:29,000
It's kind of a trade-off between thinking and social.

253
0:11:30.033,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And then you can get to the point where it's so severe,

254
0:11:32.649,000 --> 0:11:34,000
you're going to have a person that's going to be non-verbal.

255
0:11:35.529,000 --> 0:11:36,000
In the normal human mind,

256
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
language covers up the visual thinking we share with animals.

257
0:11:40.906,000 --> 0:11:42,000
This is the work of Dr. Bruce Miller.

258
0:11:44.756,000 --> 0:11:47,000
He studied Alzheimer's patients that had frontal temporal lobe dementia.

259
0:11:48.512,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And the dementia ate out the language parts of the brain.

260
0:11:51.559,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And then this artwork came out of somebody

261
0:11:53.854,000 --> 0:11:54,000
who used to install stereos in cars.

262
0:11:56.827,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Now, Van Gogh doesn't know anything about physics,

263
0:12:00.517,000 --> 0:12:03,000
but I think it's very interesting that there was some work done

264
0:12:03.862,000 --> 0:12:05,000
to show that this eddy pattern in this painting

265
0:12:06.609,000 --> 0:12:09,000
followed a statistical model of turbulence,

266
0:12:09.781,000 --> 0:12:11,000
which brings up the whole interesting idea

267
0:12:11.824,000 --> 0:12:14,000
of maybe some of this mathematical patterns is in our own head.

268
0:12:15.586,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And the Wolfram stuff --

269
0:12:17.163,000 --> 0:12:21,000
I was taking notes and writing down all the search words I could use,

270
0:12:21.753,000 --> 0:12:24,000
because I think that's going to go on in my autism lectures.

271
0:12:25.104,000 --> 0:12:27,000
We've got to show these kids interesting stuff.

272
0:12:27.555,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And they've taken out the auto-shop class

273
0:12:29.846,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and the drafting class and the art class.

274
0:12:31.97,000 --> 0:12:33,000
I mean, art was my best subject in school.

275
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
We've got to think about all these different kinds of minds,

276
0:12:37.143,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and we've got to absolutely work with these kind of minds,

277
0:12:39.947,000 --> 0:12:41,000
because we absolutely are going to need

278
0:12:42.259,000 --> 0:12:44,000
these kinds of people in the future.

279
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And let's talk about jobs.

280
0:12:47.524,000 --> 0:12:49,000
OK, my science teacher got me studying,

281
0:12:49.741,000 --> 0:12:51,000
because I was a goofball that didn't want to study.

282
0:12:52.179,000 --> 0:12:54,000
But you know what? I was getting work experience.

283
0:12:54.548,000 --> 0:12:57,000
I'm seeing too many of these smart kids who haven't learned basic things,

284
0:12:58.036,000 --> 0:13:01,000
like how to be on time -- I was taught that when I was eight years old.

285
0:13:01.508,000 --> 0:13:03,000
How to have table manners at granny's Sunday party.

286
0:13:04.087,000 --> 0:13:06,000
I was taught that when I was very, very young.

287
0:13:06.746,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And when I was 13, I had a job at a dressmaker's shop sewing clothes.

288
0:13:11.747,000 --> 0:13:13,000
I did internships in college,

289
0:13:14.359,000 --> 0:13:17,000
I was building things,

290
0:13:17.586,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and I also had to learn how to do assignments.

291
0:13:20.627,000 --> 0:13:23,000
You know, all I wanted to do was draw pictures of horses when I was little.

292
0:13:24.241,000 --> 0:13:26,000
My mother said, "Well let's do a picture of something else."

293
0:13:27.093,000 --> 0:13:29,000
They've got to learn how to do something else.

294
0:13:29.281,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Let's say the kid is fixated on Legos.

295
0:13:31.149,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Let's get him working on building different things.

296
0:13:33.87,000 --> 0:13:36,000
The thing about the autistic mind is it tends to be fixated.

297
0:13:37.49,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Like if the kid loves race cars, let's use race cars for math.

298
0:13:41.392,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Let's figure out how long it takes a race car to go a certain distance.

299
0:13:44.856,000 --> 0:13:47,000
In other words, use that fixation

300
0:13:47.993,000 --> 0:13:5,000
in order to motivate that kid, that's one of the things we need to do.

301
0:13:51.873,000 --> 0:13:54,000
I really get fed up when the teachers,

302
0:13:54.985,000 --> 0:13:56,000
especially when you get away from this part of the country,

303
0:13:57.811,000 --> 0:13:59,000
they don't know what to do with these smart kids.

304
0:14:00.215,000 --> 0:14:01,000
It just drives me crazy.

305
0:14:01.402,000 --> 0:14:03,000
What can visual thinkers do when they grow up?

306
0:14:03.668,000 --> 0:14:05,000
They can do graphic design, all kinds of stuff with computers,

307
0:14:06.641,000 --> 0:14:09,000
photography, industrial design.

308
0:14:11.643,000 --> 0:14:14,000
The pattern thinkers -- they're the ones that are going to be your mathematicians,

309
0:14:15.599,000 --> 0:14:17,000
your software engineers, your computer programmers,

310
0:14:18.13,000 --> 0:14:19,000
all of those kinds of jobs.

311
0:14:20.117,000 --> 0:14:23,000
And then you've got the word minds; they make great journalists,

312
0:14:23.713,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and they also make really, really good stage actors.

313
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Because the thing about being autistic is,

314
0:14:28.676,000 --> 0:14:3,000
I had to learn social skills like being in a play.

315
0:14:31.531,000 --> 0:14:33,000
You just kind of ... you just have to learn it.

316
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
And we need to be working with these students.

317
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
And this brings up mentors.

318
0:14:39.392,000 --> 0:14:42,000
You know, my science teacher was not an accredited teacher.

319
0:14:42.516,000 --> 0:14:43,000
He was a NASA space scientist.

320
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Some states now are getting it to where, if you have a degree in biology

321
0:14:47.688,000 --> 0:14:48,000
or in chemistry,

322
0:14:48.983,000 --> 0:14:5,000
you can come into the school and teach biology or chemistry.

323
0:14:51.844,000 --> 0:14:52,000
We need to be doing that.

324
0:14:53.8,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Because what I'm observing is,

325
0:14:55.614,000 --> 0:14:57,000
the good teachers, for a lot of these kids,

326
0:14:57.687,000 --> 0:14:58,000
are out in the community colleges.

327
0:14:59.359,000 --> 0:15:01,000
But we need to be getting some of these good teachers

328
0:15:01.919,000 --> 0:15:02,000
into the high schools.

329
0:15:03.094,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Another thing that can be very, very, very successful is:

330
0:15:06.674,000 --> 0:15:08,000
there's a lot of people that may have retired

331
0:15:08.806,000 --> 0:15:09,000
from working in the software industry,

332
0:15:10.652,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and they can teach your kid.

333
0:15:12.064,000 --> 0:15:14,000
And it doesn't matter if what they teach them is old,

334
0:15:14.897,000 --> 0:15:16,000
because what you're doing is you're lighting the spark.

335
0:15:17.648,000 --> 0:15:19,000
You're getting that kid turned on.

336
0:15:20.136,000 --> 0:15:23,000
And you get him turned on, then you'll learn all the new stuff.

337
0:15:23.575,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Mentors are just essential.

338
0:15:25.863,000 --> 0:15:28,000
I cannot emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me.

339
0:15:30.204,000 --> 0:15:33,000
And we've got to mentor them, hire them.

340
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
And if you bring them in for internships in your companies,

341
0:15:36.092,000 --> 0:15:38,000
the thing about the autism, Asperger-y kind of mind,

342
0:15:38.589,000 --> 0:15:39,000
you've got to give them a specific task.

343
0:15:40.581,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Don't just say, "Design new software."

344
0:15:42.447,000 --> 0:15:44,000
You've got to tell them something more specific:

345
0:15:44.738,000 --> 0:15:45,000
"We're designing software for a phone

346
0:15:46.659,000 --> 0:15:47,000
and it has to do some specific thing,

347
0:15:48.483,000 --> 0:15:49,000
and it can only use so much memory."

348
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
That's the kind of specificity you need.

349
0:15:52.711,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Well, that's the end of my talk.

350
0:15:54.594,000 --> 0:15:56,000
And I just want to thank everybody for coming.

351
0:15:56.861,000 --> 0:15:57,000
It was great to be here.

352
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
(Applause)

353
0:16:09.786,000 --> 0:16:11,000
(Applause ends)

354
0:16:12.001,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Oh -- you have a question for me? OK.

355
0:16:13.85,000 --> 0:16:15,000
(Applause)

356
0:16:16.271,000 --> 0:16:18,000
Chris Anderson: Thank you so much for that.

357
0:16:18.323,000 --> 0:16:2,000
You know, you once wrote -- I like this quote:

358
0:16:20.673,000 --> 0:16:24,000
"If by some magic, autism had been eradicated from the face of the Earth,

359
0:16:25.258,000 --> 0:16:27,000
then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire

360
0:16:28.259,000 --> 0:16:29,000
at the entrance to a cave."

361
0:16:29.624,000 --> 0:16:3,000
(Laughter)

362
0:16:30.676,000 --> 0:16:33,000
Temple Grandin: Because who do you think made the first stone spear?

363
0:16:33.936,000 --> 0:16:34,000
It was the Asperger guy,

364
0:16:35.118,000 --> 0:16:37,000
and if you were to get rid of all the autism genetics,

365
0:16:37.695,000 --> 0:16:4,000
there'd be no more Silicon Valley, and the energy crisis would not be solved.

366
0:16:41.384,000 --> 0:16:42,000
(Applause)

367
0:16:42.749,000 --> 0:16:44,000
CA: I want to ask you a couple other questions,

368
0:16:45.003,000 --> 0:16:48,000
and if any of these feel inappropriate, it's OK just to say, "Next question."

369
0:16:48.791,000 --> 0:16:51,000
But if there is someone here who has an autistic child,

370
0:16:52.429,000 --> 0:16:56,000
or knows an autistic child and feels kind of cut off from them,

371
0:16:57.793,000 --> 0:16:58,000
what advice would you give them?

372
0:16:59.664,000 --> 0:17:01,000
TG: Well, first of all, we've got to look at age.

373
0:17:02.017,000 --> 0:17:05,000
If you have a two, three or four-year-old, no speech, no social interaction,

374
0:17:05.99,000 --> 0:17:07,000
I can't emphasize enough: Don't wait.

375
0:17:08.303,000 --> 0:17:11,000
You need at least 20 hours a week of one-to-one teaching.

376
0:17:11.612,000 --> 0:17:13,000
The thing is, autism comes in different degrees.

377
0:17:14.129,000 --> 0:17:17,000
About half of the people on the spectrum are not going to learn to talk,

378
0:17:17.66,000 --> 0:17:19,000
and they won't be working in Silicon Valley.

379
0:17:19.785,000 --> 0:17:21,000
That would not be a reasonable thing for them to do.

380
0:17:22.259,000 --> 0:17:25,000
But then you get these smart, geeky kids with a touch of autism,

381
0:17:25.36,000 --> 0:17:27,000
and that's where you've got to get them turned on

382
0:17:27.864,000 --> 0:17:28,000
with doing interesting things.

383
0:17:29.377,000 --> 0:17:32,000
I got social interaction through shared interests --

384
0:17:32.416,000 --> 0:17:35,000
I rode horses with other kids, I made model rockets with other kids,

385
0:17:36.397,000 --> 0:17:37,000
did electronics lab with other kids.

386
0:17:38.399,000 --> 0:17:42,000
And in the '60s, it was gluing mirrors onto a rubber membrane on a speaker

387
0:17:42.674,000 --> 0:17:43,000
to make a light show.

388
0:17:43.879,000 --> 0:17:45,000
That was, like, we considered that super cool.

389
0:17:46.125,000 --> 0:17:47,000
(Laughter)

390
0:17:47.155,000 --> 0:17:48,000
CA: Is it unrealistic for them

391
0:17:48.676,000 --> 0:17:52,000
to hope or think that that child loves them, as some might, as most, wish?

392
0:17:53.44,000 --> 0:17:55,000
TG: Well, I tell you, that child will be loyal,

393
0:17:55.698,000 --> 0:17:58,000
and if your house is burning down, they're going to get you out of it.

394
0:17:59.097,000 --> 0:18:02,000
CA: Wow. So most people, if you ask them what they're most passionate about,

395
0:18:02.78,000 --> 0:18:04,000
they'd say things like, "My kids" or "My lover."

396
0:18:06.27,000 --> 0:18:07,000
What are you most passionate about?

397
0:18:08.046,000 --> 0:18:11,000
TG: I'm passionate about that the things I do

398
0:18:11.101,000 --> 0:18:13,000
are going to make the world a better place.

399
0:18:13.162,000 --> 0:18:15,000
When I have a mother of an autistic child say,

400
0:18:15.408,000 --> 0:18:17,000
"My kid went to college because of your book

401
0:18:17.494,000 --> 0:18:18,000
or one of your lectures,"

402
0:18:18.718,000 --> 0:18:19,000
that makes me happy.

403
0:18:19.893,000 --> 0:18:21,000
You know, the slaughter plants I worked with in the '80s;

404
0:18:22.63,000 --> 0:18:23,000
they were absolutely awful.

405
0:18:23.971,000 --> 0:18:26,000
I developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants,

406
0:18:27.271,000 --> 0:18:28,000
where you just measure outcomes:

407
0:18:28.847,000 --> 0:18:29,000
How many cattle fell down?

408
0:18:30.113,000 --> 0:18:31,000
How many got poked with the prodder?

409
0:18:31.885,000 --> 0:18:33,000
How many cattle are mooing their heads off?

410
0:18:34.278,000 --> 0:18:35,000
And it's very, very simple.

411
0:18:35.636,000 --> 0:18:36,000
You directly observe a few simple things.

412
0:18:37.637,000 --> 0:18:38,000
It's worked really well.

413
0:18:38.825,000 --> 0:18:4,000
I get satisfaction out of seeing stuff

414
0:18:41.188,000 --> 0:18:43,000
that makes real change in the real world.

415
0:18:43.932,000 --> 0:18:45,000
We need a lot more of that, and a lot less abstract stuff.

416
0:18:46.705,000 --> 0:18:47,000
CA: Totally.

417
0:18:47.88,000 --> 0:18:52,000
(Applause)

418
0:18:52.987,000 --> 0:18:55,000
CA: When we were talking on the phone, one of the things you said

419
0:18:56.11,000 --> 0:18:57,000
that really astonished me

420
0:18:57.336,000 --> 0:19:,000
was that one thing you were passionate about was server farms.

421
0:19:01.103,000 --> 0:19:02,000
Tell me about that.

422
0:19:02.278,000 --> 0:19:05,000
TG: Well, the reason why I got really excited when I read about that,

423
0:19:05.679,000 --> 0:19:06,000
it contains knowledge.

424
0:19:07.359,000 --> 0:19:08,000
It's libraries.

425
0:19:09.041,000 --> 0:19:12,000
And to me, knowledge is something that is extremely valuable.

426
0:19:12.584,000 --> 0:19:15,000
So, maybe over 10 years ago now, our library got flooded.

427
0:19:15.724,000 --> 0:19:17,000
This is before the Internet got really big.

428
0:19:17.799,000 --> 0:19:19,000
And I was really upset about all the books being wrecked,

429
0:19:20.504,000 --> 0:19:21,000
because it was knowledge being destroyed.

430
0:19:22.504,000 --> 0:19:26,000
And server farms, or data centers, are great libraries of knowledge.

431
0:19:26.941,000 --> 0:19:27,000
CA: Temple, can I just say,

432
0:19:28.256,000 --> 0:19:3,000
it's an absolute delight to have you at TED.

433
0:19:30.366,000 --> 0:19:31,000
Thank you so much.

434
0:19:31.541,000 --> 0:19:32,000
TG: Well, thank you so much. Thank you.

435
0:19:33.46,000 --> 0:19:38,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.573,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Cancer.

2
0:00:15.121,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Many of us have lost family, friends or loved ones

3
0:00:18.21,000 --> 0:00:19,000
to this horrible disease.

4
0:00:19.914,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I know there are some of you in the audience

5
0:00:22.034,000 --> 0:00:23,000
who are cancer survivors,

6
0:00:23.299,000 --> 0:00:25,000
or who are fighting cancer at this moment.

7
0:00:25.478,000 --> 0:00:26,000
My heart goes out to you.

8
0:00:27.493,000 --> 0:00:32,000
While this word often conjures up emotions of sadness and anger and fear,

9
0:00:32.791,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I bring you good news from the front lines of cancer research.

10
0:00:36.329,000 --> 0:00:39,000
The fact is, we are starting to win the war on cancer.

11
0:00:41.138,000 --> 0:00:42,000
In fact, we lie at the intersection

12
0:00:42.865,000 --> 0:00:46,000
of the three of the most exciting developments within cancer research.

13
0:00:47.078,000 --> 0:00:49,000
The first is cancer genomics.

14
0:00:49.387,000 --> 0:00:51,000
The genome is a composition

15
0:00:51.436,000 --> 0:00:53,000
of all the genetic information encoded by DNA

16
0:00:54.396,000 --> 0:00:55,000
in an organism.

17
0:00:55.787,000 --> 0:00:57,000
In cancers, changes in the DNA called mutations

18
0:00:58.652,000 --> 0:01:,000
are what drive these cancers to go out of control.

19
0:01:01.89,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Around 10 years ago, I was part of the team at Johns Hopkins

20
0:01:05.206,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that first mapped the mutations of cancers.

21
0:01:07.828,000 --> 0:01:09,000
We did this first for colorectal,

22
0:01:10.038,000 --> 0:01:12,000
breast, pancreatic and brain cancers.

23
0:01:12.984,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And since then, there have been over 90 projects in 70 countries

24
0:01:16.52,000 --> 0:01:17,000
all over the world,

25
0:01:18.134,000 --> 0:01:21,000
working to understand the genetic basis of these diseases.

26
0:01:21.533,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Today, tens of thousands of cancers are understood

27
0:01:24.611,000 --> 0:01:26,000
down to exquisite molecular detail.

28
0:01:28.02,000 --> 0:01:3,000
The second revolution is precision medicine,

29
0:01:30.346,000 --> 0:01:32,000
also known as "personalized medicine."

30
0:01:32.774,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Instead of one-size-fits-all methods to be able to treat cancers,

31
0:01:36.375,000 --> 0:01:39,000
there is a whole new class of drugs that are able to target cancers

32
0:01:40.054,000 --> 0:01:42,000
based on their unique genetic profile.

33
0:01:42.737,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Today, there are a host of these tailor-made drugs,

34
0:01:45.691,000 --> 0:01:46,000
called targeted therapies,

35
0:01:47.045,000 --> 0:01:49,000
available to physicians even today

36
0:01:49.252,000 --> 0:01:52,000
to be able to personalize their therapy for their patients,

37
0:01:52.539,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and many others are in development.

38
0:01:55.116,000 --> 0:01:58,000
The third exciting revolution is immunotherapy,

39
0:01:58.438,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and this is really exciting.

40
0:02:00.865,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Scientists have been able to leverage the immune system

41
0:02:03.599,000 --> 0:02:04,000
in the fight against cancer.

42
0:02:05.652,000 --> 0:02:09,000
For example, there have been ways where we find the off switches of cancer,

43
0:02:09.872,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and new drugs have been able to turn the immune system back on,

44
0:02:13.34,000 --> 0:02:14,000
to be able to fight cancer.

45
0:02:14.952,000 --> 0:02:18,000
In addition, there are ways where you can take away immune cells

46
0:02:19.067,000 --> 0:02:2,000
from the body,

47
0:02:20.251,000 --> 0:02:23,000
train them, engineer them and put them back into the body

48
0:02:23.362,000 --> 0:02:24,000
to fight cancer.

49
0:02:24.763,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Almost sounds like science fiction, doesn't it?

50
0:02:27.91,000 --> 0:02:3,000
While I was a researcher at the National Cancer Institute,

51
0:02:30.95,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I had the privilege of working with some of the pioneers of this field

52
0:02:34.429,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and watched the development firsthand.

53
0:02:36.699,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It's been pretty amazing.

54
0:02:38.166,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Today, over 600 clinical trials are open,

55
0:02:41.195,000 --> 0:02:45,000
actively recruiting patients to explore all aspects in immunotherapy.

56
0:02:46.484,000 --> 0:02:49,000
While these three exciting revolutions are ongoing,

57
0:02:49.569,000 --> 0:02:51,000
unfortunately, this is only the beginning,

58
0:02:51.617,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and there are still many, many challenges.

59
0:02:54.852,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Let me illustrate with a patient.

60
0:02:58.021,000 --> 0:03:,000
Here is a patient with a skin cancer called melanoma.

61
0:03:00.956,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It's horrible; the cancer has gone everywhere.

62
0:03:05.026,000 --> 0:03:08,000
However, scientists were able to map the mutations of this cancer

63
0:03:08.77,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and give a specific treatment that targets one of the mutations.

64
0:03:13.77,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And the result is almost miraculous.

65
0:03:16.247,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Tumors almost seem to melt away.

66
0:03:19.73,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Unfortunately, this is not the end of the story.

67
0:03:22.897,000 --> 0:03:24,000
A few months later, this picture is taken.

68
0:03:25.977,000 --> 0:03:26,000
The tumor has come back.

69
0:03:28.447,000 --> 0:03:29,000
The question is: Why?

70
0:03:30.712,000 --> 0:03:32,000
The answer is tumor heterogeneity.

71
0:03:33.927,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Let me explain.

72
0:03:36.944,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Even a cancer as small as one centimeter in diameter

73
0:03:40.456,000 --> 0:03:42,000
harbors over a hundred million different cells.

74
0:03:43.668,000 --> 0:03:44,000
While genetically similar,

75
0:03:45.573,000 --> 0:03:47,000
there are small differences in these different cancers

76
0:03:48.306,000 --> 0:03:5,000
that make them differently prone to different drugs.

77
0:03:51.187,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So even if you have a drug that's highly effective,

78
0:03:53.639,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that kills almost all the cells,

79
0:03:55.398,000 --> 0:03:58,000
there is a chance that there's a small population

80
0:03:58.612,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that's resistant to the drug.

81
0:04:00.41,000 --> 0:04:02,000
This ultimately is the population

82
0:04:02.456,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that comes back,

83
0:04:03.644,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and takes over the patient.

84
0:04:05.707,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So then the question is: What do we do with this information?

85
0:04:08.59,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Well, the key, then,

86
0:04:09.876,000 --> 0:04:13,000
is to apply all these exciting advancements in cancer therapy earlier,

87
0:04:14.77,000 --> 0:04:15,000
as soon as we can,

88
0:04:16.016,000 --> 0:04:18,000
before these resistance clones emerge.

89
0:04:19.05,000 --> 0:04:23,000
The key to cancer and curing cancer is early detection.

90
0:04:24.259,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And we intuitively know this.

91
0:04:25.952,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Finding cancer early results in better outcomes,

92
0:04:29.062,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and the numbers show this as well.

93
0:04:31.132,000 --> 0:04:35,000
For example, in ovarian cancer, if you detect cancer in stage four,

94
0:04:35.399,000 --> 0:04:38,000
only 17 percent of the women survive at five years.

95
0:04:39.088,000 --> 0:04:43,000
However, if you are able to detect this cancer as early as stage one,

96
0:04:43.54,000 --> 0:04:45,000
over 92 percent of women will survive.

97
0:04:46.745,000 --> 0:04:5,000
But the sad fact is, only 15 percent of women are detected at stage one,

98
0:04:51.572,000 --> 0:04:56,000
whereas the vast majority, 70 percent, are detected in stages three and four.

99
0:04:57.168,000 --> 0:05:01,000
We desperately need better detection mechanisms for cancers.

100
0:05:01.873,000 --> 0:05:05,000
The current best ways to screen cancer fall into one of three categories.

101
0:05:06.175,000 --> 0:05:08,000
First is medical procedures,

102
0:05:08.374,000 --> 0:05:1,000
which is like colonoscopy for colon cancer.

103
0:05:11.306,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Second is protein biomarkers, like PSA for prostate cancer.

104
0:05:15.946,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Or third, imaging techniques,

105
0:05:18.882,000 --> 0:05:2,000
such as mammography for breast cancer.

106
0:05:22.239,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Medical procedures are the gold standard;

107
0:05:24.689,000 --> 0:05:26,000
however, they are highly invasive

108
0:05:26.809,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and require a large infrastructure to implement.

109
0:05:30.502,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Protein markers, while effective in some populations,

110
0:05:33.73,000 --> 0:05:35,000
are not very specific in some circumstances,

111
0:05:36.243,000 --> 0:05:38,000
resulting in high numbers of false positives,

112
0:05:38.85,000 --> 0:05:43,000
which then results in unnecessary work-ups and unnecessary procedures.

113
0:05:45.142,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Imaging methods, while useful in some populations,

114
0:05:48.781,000 --> 0:05:5,000
expose patients to harmful radiation.

115
0:05:51.702,000 --> 0:05:53,000
In addition, it is not applicable to all patients.

116
0:05:54.34,000 --> 0:05:58,000
For example, mammography has problems in women with dense breasts.

117
0:05:58.856,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So what we need is a method that is noninvasive,

118
0:06:02.274,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that is light in infrastructure,

119
0:06:04.065,000 --> 0:06:05,000
that is highly specific,

120
0:06:05.968,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that also does not have false positives,

121
0:06:09.213,000 --> 0:06:1,000
does not use any radiation

122
0:06:11.203,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and is applicable to large populations.

123
0:06:14.158,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Even more importantly,

124
0:06:15.356,000 --> 0:06:17,000
we need a method to be able to detect cancers

125
0:06:17.576,000 --> 0:06:19,000
before they're 100 million cells in size.

126
0:06:20.88,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Does such a technology exist?

127
0:06:22.828,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Well, I wouldn't be up here giving a talk if it didn't.

128
0:06:26.722,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I'm excited to tell you about this latest technology we've developed.

129
0:06:31.035,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Central to our technology is a simple blood test.

130
0:06:34.202,000 --> 0:06:37,000
The blood circulatory system, while seemingly mundane,

131
0:06:37.956,000 --> 0:06:39,000
is essential for you to survive,

132
0:06:40.31,000 --> 0:06:42,000
providing oxygen and nutrients to your cells,

133
0:06:42.839,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and removing waste and carbon dioxide.

134
0:06:45.468,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Here's a key biological insight:

135
0:06:48.24,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Cancer cells grow and die faster than normal cells,

136
0:06:51.347,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and when they die,

137
0:06:52.567,000 --> 0:06:54,000
DNA is shed into the blood system.

138
0:06:55.312,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Since we know the signatures of these cancer cells

139
0:06:58.106,000 --> 0:07:,000
from all the different cancer genome sequencing projects,

140
0:07:00.834,000 --> 0:07:02,000
we can look for those signals in the blood

141
0:07:02.899,000 --> 0:07:04,000
to be able to detect these cancers early.

142
0:07:06.229,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So instead of waiting for cancers to be large enough to cause symptoms,

143
0:07:10.052,000 --> 0:07:12,000
or for them to be dense enough to show up on imaging,

144
0:07:12.975,000 --> 0:07:14,000
or for them to be prominent enough

145
0:07:15.441,000 --> 0:07:18,000
for you to be able to visualize on medical procedures,

146
0:07:18.705,000 --> 0:07:21,000
we can start looking for cancers while they are relatively pretty small,

147
0:07:22.721,000 --> 0:07:25,000
by looking for these small amounts of DNA in the blood.

148
0:07:27.635,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So let me tell you how we do this.

149
0:07:29.334,000 --> 0:07:31,000
First, like I said, we start off with a simple blood test --

150
0:07:32.222,000 --> 0:07:34,000
no radiation, no complicated equipment --

151
0:07:34.821,000 --> 0:07:35,000
a simple blood test.

152
0:07:36.311,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Then the blood is shipped to us,

153
0:07:37.871,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and what we do is extract the DNA out of it.

154
0:07:40.93,000 --> 0:07:42,000
While your body is mostly healthy cells,

155
0:07:43.35,000 --> 0:07:46,000
most of the DNA that's detected will be from healthy cells.

156
0:07:47.654,000 --> 0:07:5,000
However, there will be a small amount, less than one percent,

157
0:07:50.745,000 --> 0:07:51,000
that comes from the cancer cells.

158
0:07:53.365,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Then we use molecular biology methods to be able to enrich this DNA

159
0:07:57.595,000 --> 0:08:01,000
for areas of the genome which are known to be associated with cancer,

160
0:08:02.031,000 --> 0:08:04,000
based on the information from the cancer genomics projects.

161
0:08:05.484,000 --> 0:08:08,000
We're able to then put this DNA into DNA-sequencing machines

162
0:08:09.385,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and are able to digitize the DNA into A's, C's, T's and G's

163
0:08:14.099,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and have this final readout.

164
0:08:16.271,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Ultimately, we have information of billions of letters

165
0:08:22.285,000 --> 0:08:25,000
that output from this run.

166
0:08:26.455,000 --> 0:08:29,000
We then apply statistical and computational methods

167
0:08:29.699,000 --> 0:08:31,000
to be able to find the small signal that's present,

168
0:08:32.395,000 --> 0:08:35,000
indicative of the small amount of cancer DNA in the blood.

169
0:08:37.098,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So does this actually work in patients?

170
0:08:39.547,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Well, because there's no way of really predicting right now

171
0:08:43.061,000 --> 0:08:44,000
which patients will get cancer,

172
0:08:44.593,000 --> 0:08:46,000
we use the next best population:

173
0:08:47.261,000 --> 0:08:48,000
cancers in remission;

174
0:08:49.372,000 --> 0:08:51,000
specifically, lung cancer.

175
0:08:52.225,000 --> 0:08:55,000
The sad fact is, even with the best drugs that we have today,

176
0:08:55.558,000 --> 0:08:57,000
most lung cancers come back.

177
0:08:57.794,000 --> 0:08:58,000
The key, then, is to see

178
0:08:59.118,000 --> 0:09:02,000
whether we're able to detect these recurrences of cancers

179
0:09:02.793,000 --> 0:09:03,000
earlier than with standard methods.

180
0:09:05.159,000 --> 0:09:07,000
We just finished a major trial

181
0:09:07.56,000 --> 0:09:1,000
with Professor Charles Swanton at University College London,

182
0:09:11.331,000 --> 0:09:12,000
examining this.

183
0:09:12.521,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Let me walk you through an example of one patient.

184
0:09:16.586,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Here's an example of one patient who undergoes surgery

185
0:09:19.437,000 --> 0:09:2,000
at time point zero,

186
0:09:20.629,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and then undergoes chemotherapy.

187
0:09:23.529,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Then the patient is under remission.

188
0:09:26.038,000 --> 0:09:3,000
He is monitored using clinical exams and imaging methods.

189
0:09:30.969,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Around day 450, unfortunately, the cancer comes back.

190
0:09:37.086,000 --> 0:09:39,000
The question is: Are we able to catch this earlier?

191
0:09:39.595,000 --> 0:09:42,000
During this whole time, we've been collecting blood serially

192
0:09:43.364,000 --> 0:09:46,000
to be able to measure the amount of ctDNA in the blood.

193
0:09:47.38,000 --> 0:09:5,000
So at the initial time point, as expected,

194
0:09:50.701,000 --> 0:09:53,000
there's a high level of cancer DNA in the blood.

195
0:09:54.423,000 --> 0:09:57,000
However, this goes away to zero in subsequent time points

196
0:09:58.114,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and remains negligible after subsequent points.

197
0:10:02.813,000 --> 0:10:07,000
However, around day 340, we see the rise of cancer DNA in the blood,

198
0:10:08.11,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and eventually, it goes up higher for days 400 and 450.

199
0:10:13.235,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Here's the key, if you've missed it:

200
0:10:15.691,000 --> 0:10:19,000
At day 340, we see the rise in the cancer DNA in the blood.

201
0:10:20.696,000 --> 0:10:24,000
That means we are catching this cancer over a hundred days earlier

202
0:10:24.936,000 --> 0:10:25,000
than traditional methods.

203
0:10:26.921,000 --> 0:10:28,000
This is a hundred days earlier where we can give therapies,

204
0:10:29.758,000 --> 0:10:32,000
a hundred days earlier where we can do surgical interventions,

205
0:10:33.101,000 --> 0:10:36,000
or even a hundred days less for the cancer to grow

206
0:10:36.158,000 --> 0:10:39,000
or a hundred days less for resistance to occur.

207
0:10:40.502,000 --> 0:10:44,000
For some patients, this hundred days means the matter of life and death.

208
0:10:45.237,000 --> 0:10:47,000
We're really excited about this information.

209
0:10:48.359,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Because of this assignment, we've done additional studies now

210
0:10:51.48,000 --> 0:10:52,000
in other cancers,

211
0:10:52.766,000 --> 0:10:55,000
including breast cancer, lung cancer

212
0:10:56.125,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and ovarian cancer,

213
0:10:57.888,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and I can't wait to see how much earlier we can find these cancers.

214
0:11:04.174,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Ultimately, I have a dream,

215
0:11:06.214,000 --> 0:11:08,000
a dream of two vials of blood,

216
0:11:09.356,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and that, in the future, as part of all of our standard physical exams,

217
0:11:13.245,000 --> 0:11:14,000
we'll have two vials of blood drawn.

218
0:11:15.641,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And from these two vials of blood we will be able to compare

219
0:11:19.007,000 --> 0:11:22,000
the DNA from all known signatures of cancer,

220
0:11:22.542,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and hopefully then detect cancers months to even years earlier.

221
0:11:27.179,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Even with the therapies we have currently,

222
0:11:29.374,000 --> 0:11:31,000
this could mean that millions of lives could be saved.

223
0:11:31.999,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And if you add on to that recent advancements in immunotherapy

224
0:11:36.194,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and targeted therapies,

225
0:11:37.51,000 --> 0:11:39,000
the end of cancer is in sight.

226
0:11:40.754,000 --> 0:11:42,000
The next time you hear the word "cancer,"

227
0:11:42.935,000 --> 0:11:44,000
I want you to add to the emotions: hope.

228
0:11:46.123,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Hold on.

229
0:11:48.162,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Cancer researchers all around the world are working feverishly

230
0:11:51.759,000 --> 0:11:52,000
to beat this disease,

231
0:11:52.939,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and tremendous progress is being made.

232
0:11:55.776,000 --> 0:11:56,000
This is the beginning of the end.

233
0:11:58.2,000 --> 0:12:,000
We will win the war on cancer.

234
0:12:00.681,000 --> 0:12:01,000
And to me, this is amazing news.

235
0:12:03.013,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Thank you.

236
0:12:04.204,000 --> 0:12:08,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:14.206,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm a potter,

2
0:00:17.224,000 --> 0:00:21,000
which seems like a fairly humble vocation.

3
0:00:21.749,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I know a lot about pots.

4
0:00:24.629,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I've spent about 15 years making them.

5
0:00:28.309,000 --> 0:00:31,000
One of the things that really excites me in my artistic practice

6
0:00:31.339,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and being trained as a potter

7
0:00:34.056,000 --> 0:00:39,000
is that you very quickly learn how to make great things out of nothing;

8
0:00:39.5,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that I spent a lot of time at my wheel with mounds of clay trying stuff;

9
0:00:46.283,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and that the limitations of my capacity, my ability,

10
0:00:49.775,000 --> 0:00:51,000
was based on my hands and my imagination;

11
0:00:52.506,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that if I wanted to make a really nice bowl

12
0:00:54.706,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and I didn't know how to make a foot yet,

13
0:00:56.81,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I would have to learn how to make a foot;

14
0:00:59.829,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that that process of learning has been very, very helpful to my life.

15
0:01:04.983,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I feel like, as a potter,

16
0:01:06.957,000 --> 0:01:1,000
you also start to learn how to shape the world.

17
0:01:11.067,000 --> 0:01:14,000
There have been times in my artistic capacity

18
0:01:14.178,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that I wanted to reflect

19
0:01:17.041,000 --> 0:01:19,000
on other really important moments

20
0:01:19.704,000 --> 0:01:23,000
in the history of the U.S., the history of the world

21
0:01:23.814,000 --> 0:01:24,000
where tough things happened,

22
0:01:25.405,000 --> 0:01:27,000
but how do you talk about tough ideas

23
0:01:28.086,000 --> 0:01:32,000
without separating people from that content?

24
0:01:32.196,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Could I use art like these old, discontinued firehoses from Alabama,

25
0:01:37.792,000 --> 0:01:43,000
to talk about the complexities of a moment of civil rights in the '60s?

26
0:01:43.946,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Is it possible to talk about my father and I doing labor projects?

27
0:01:48.797,000 --> 0:01:52,000
My dad was a roofer, construction guy, he owned small businesses,

28
0:01:52.954,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and at 80, he was ready to retire and his tar kettle was my inheritance.

29
0:01:59.85,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Now, a tar kettle doesn't sound like much of an inheritance. It wasn't.

30
0:02:03.659,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It was stinky and it took up a lot of space in my studio,

31
0:02:07.606,000 --> 0:02:11,000
but I asked my dad if he would be willing to make some art with me,

32
0:02:11.901,000 --> 0:02:14,000
if we could reimagine this kind of nothing material

33
0:02:15.732,000 --> 0:02:17,000
as something very special.

34
0:02:18.217,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And by elevating the material and my dad's skill,

35
0:02:21.607,000 --> 0:02:26,000
could we start to think about tar just like clay, in a new way,

36
0:02:27.905,000 --> 0:02:31,000
shaping it differently, helping us to imagine what was possible?

37
0:02:33.607,000 --> 0:02:37,000
After clay, I was then kind of turned on to lots of different kinds of materials,

38
0:02:37.79,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and my studio grew a lot because I thought, well,

39
0:02:40.762,000 --> 0:02:44,000
it's not really about the material, it's about our capacity to shape things.

40
0:02:44.849,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I became more and more interested in ideas

41
0:02:47.705,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and more and more things that were happening just outside my studio.

42
0:02:53.897,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Just to give you a little bit of context, I live in Chicago.

43
0:02:57.104,000 --> 0:03:,000
I live on the South Side now. I'm a West Sider.

44
0:03:00.359,000 --> 0:03:03,000
For those of you who are not Chicagoans, that won't mean anything,

45
0:03:03.773,000 --> 0:03:05,000
but if I didn't mention that I was a West Sider,

46
0:03:06.025,000 --> 0:03:1,000
there would be a lot of people in the city that would be very upset.

47
0:03:10.204,000 --> 0:03:12,000
The neighborhood that I live in is Grand Crossing.

48
0:03:13.153,000 --> 0:03:16,000
It's a neighborhood that has seen better days.

49
0:03:16.976,000 --> 0:03:2,000
It is not a gated community by far.

50
0:03:21.071,000 --> 0:03:24,000
There is lots of abandonment in my neighborhood,

51
0:03:24.205,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and while I was kind of busy making pots and busy making art

52
0:03:27.711,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and having a good art career,

53
0:03:29.662,000 --> 0:03:31,000
there was all of this stuff that was happening

54
0:03:31.807,000 --> 0:03:32,000
just outside my studio.

55
0:03:34.46,000 --> 0:03:37,000
All of us know about failing housing markets

56
0:03:37.748,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and the challenges of blight,

57
0:03:39.58,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and I feel like we talk about it with some of our cities more than others,

58
0:03:43.057,000 --> 0:03:45,000
but I think a lot of our U.S. cities and beyond

59
0:03:45.991,000 --> 0:03:47,000
have the challenge of blight,

60
0:03:48.011,000 --> 0:03:52,000
abandoned buildings that people no longer know what to do anything with.

61
0:03:52.237,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And so I thought, is there a way that I could start to think

62
0:03:55.093,000 --> 0:04:,000
about these buildings as an extension or an expansion of my artistic practice?

63
0:04:00.479,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And that if I was thinking along with other creatives --

64
0:04:03.498,000 --> 0:04:06,000
architects, engineers, real estate finance people --

65
0:04:07.166,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that us together might be able to kind of think

66
0:04:10.046,000 --> 0:04:13,000
in more complicated ways about the reshaping of cities.

67
0:04:15.085,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And so I bought a building.

68
0:04:16.733,000 --> 0:04:18,000
The building was really affordable.

69
0:04:19.473,000 --> 0:04:2,000
We tricked it out.

70
0:04:21.185,000 --> 0:04:25,000
We made it as beautiful as we could to try to just get some activity happening

71
0:04:25.62,000 --> 0:04:27,000
on my block.

72
0:04:27.872,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Once I bought the building for about 18,000 dollars,

73
0:04:30.31,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I didn't have any money left.

74
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So I started sweeping the building as a kind of performance.

75
0:04:37.599,000 --> 0:04:39,000
This is performance art, and people would come over,

76
0:04:40.341,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and I would start sweeping.

77
0:04:41.897,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Because the broom was free and sweeping was free.

78
0:04:44.544,000 --> 0:04:46,000
It worked out.

79
0:04:46.703,000 --> 0:04:48,000
(Laughter)

80
0:04:48.938,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But we would use the building, then, to stage exhibitions, small dinners,

81
0:04:54.389,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and we found that that building on my block, Dorchester --

82
0:04:58.336,000 --> 0:05:,000
we now referred to the block as Dorchester projects --

83
0:05:01.052,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that in a way that building became a kind of gathering site

84
0:05:04.535,000 --> 0:05:06,000
for lots of different kinds of activity.

85
0:05:06.769,000 --> 0:05:1,000
We turned the building into what we called now the Archive House.

86
0:05:11.222,000 --> 0:05:14,000
The Archive House would do all of these amazing things.

87
0:05:14.403,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Very significant people in the city and beyond

88
0:05:17.747,000 --> 0:05:19,000
would find themselves in the middle of the hood.

89
0:05:20.422,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And that's when I felt like

90
0:05:22.79,000 --> 0:05:24,000
maybe there was a relationship between my history with clay

91
0:05:25.602,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and this new thing that was starting to develop,

92
0:05:28.172,000 --> 0:05:3,000
that we were slowly starting

93
0:05:30.514,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to reshape how people imagined the South Side of the city.

94
0:05:35.44,000 --> 0:05:37,000
One house turned into a few houses,

95
0:05:37.622,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and we always tried to suggest

96
0:05:40.084,000 --> 0:05:43,000
that not only is creating a beautiful vessel important,

97
0:05:44.008,000 --> 0:05:47,000
but the contents of what happens in those buildings is also very important.

98
0:05:47.884,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So we were not only thinking about development,

99
0:05:50.532,000 --> 0:05:52,000
but we were thinking about the program,

100
0:05:52.854,000 --> 0:05:55,000
thinking about the kind of connections that could happen

101
0:05:56.36,000 --> 0:06:,000
between one house and another, between one neighbor and another.

102
0:06:02.159,000 --> 0:06:05,000
This building became what we call the Listening House,

103
0:06:05.181,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and it has a collection of discarded books

104
0:06:08.431,000 --> 0:06:1,000
from the Johnson Publishing Corporation,

105
0:06:11.102,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and other books from an old bookstore that was going out of business.

106
0:06:15.095,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I was actually just wanting to activate these buildings as much as I could

107
0:06:19.368,000 --> 0:06:22,000
with whatever and whoever would join me.

108
0:06:23.678,000 --> 0:06:25,000
In Chicago, there's amazing building stock.

109
0:06:26.612,000 --> 0:06:3,000
This building, which had been the former crack house on the block,

110
0:06:30.791,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and when the building became abandoned,

111
0:06:33.345,000 --> 0:06:36,000
it became a great opportunity to really imagine what else could happen there.

112
0:06:37.246,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So this space we converted into what we call Black Cinema House.

113
0:06:41.298,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Black Cinema House was an opportunity in the hood to screen films

114
0:06:45.419,000 --> 0:06:49,000
that were important and relevant to the folk who lived around me,

115
0:06:49.633,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that if we wanted to show an old Melvin Van Peebles film, we could.

116
0:06:53.348,000 --> 0:06:55,000
If we wanted to show "Car Wash," we could.

117
0:06:56.018,000 --> 0:06:57,000
That would be awesome.

118
0:06:57.991,000 --> 0:06:59,000
The building we soon outgrew,

119
0:07:00.546,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and we had to move to a larger space.

120
0:07:03.053,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Black Cinema House, which was made from just a small piece of clay,

121
0:07:07.488,000 --> 0:07:14,000
had to grow into a much larger piece of clay, which is now my studio.

122
0:07:14.779,000 --> 0:07:17,000
What I realized was that for those of you who are zoning junkies,

123
0:07:18.588,000 --> 0:07:19,000
that some of the things that I was doing

124
0:07:20.582,000 --> 0:07:23,000
in these buildings that had been left behind,

125
0:07:23.881,000 --> 0:07:26,000
they were not the uses by which the buildings were built,

126
0:07:27.713,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and that there are city policies that say,

127
0:07:29.941,000 --> 0:07:32,000
"Hey, a house that is residential needs to stay residential."

128
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
But what do you do in neighborhoods when ain't nobody interested in living there?

129
0:07:38.067,000 --> 0:07:41,000
That the people who have the means to leave have already left?

130
0:07:42.011,000 --> 0:07:44,000
What do we do with these abandoned buildings?

131
0:07:44.498,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And so I was trying to wake them up using culture.

132
0:07:47.703,000 --> 0:07:5,000
We found that that was so exciting for folk,

133
0:07:50.706,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and people were so responsive to the work, that we had to then find bigger buildings.

134
0:07:55.271,000 --> 0:07:57,000
By the time we found bigger buildings,

135
0:07:57.316,000 --> 0:08:01,000
there was, in part, the resources necessary to think about those things.

136
0:08:01.569,000 --> 0:08:05,000
In this bank that we called the Arts Bank, it was in pretty bad shape.

137
0:08:05.901,000 --> 0:08:08,000
There was about six feet of standing water.

138
0:08:09.187,000 --> 0:08:11,000
It was a difficult project to finance,

139
0:08:11.649,000 --> 0:08:13,000
because banks weren't interested in the neighborhood

140
0:08:14.079,000 --> 0:08:16,000
because people weren't interested in the neighborhood

141
0:08:16.641,000 --> 0:08:18,000
because nothing had happened there.

142
0:08:18.742,000 --> 0:08:21,000
It was dirt. It was nothing. It was nowhere.

143
0:08:22.724,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And so we just started imagining, what else could happen in this building?

144
0:08:28.381,000 --> 0:08:33,000
(Applause)

145
0:08:33.846,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And so now that the rumor of my block has spread,

146
0:08:36.615,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and lots of people are starting to visit,

147
0:08:38.595,000 --> 0:08:4,000
we've found that the bank can now be a center

148
0:08:40.696,000 --> 0:08:43,000
for exhibition, archives, music performance,

149
0:08:43.908,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and that there are people who are now interested

150
0:08:46.686,000 --> 0:08:49,000
in being adjacent to those buildings because we brought some heat,

151
0:08:50.224,000 --> 0:08:52,000
that we kind of made a fire.

152
0:08:52.677,000 --> 0:08:56,000
One of the archives that we'll have there is this Johnson Publishing Corporation.

153
0:08:56.926,000 --> 0:08:59,000
We've also started to collect memorabilia from American history,

154
0:09:00.525,000 --> 0:09:03,000
from people who live or have lived in that neighborhood.

155
0:09:04.356,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Some of these images are degraded images of black people,

156
0:09:08.094,000 --> 0:09:11,000
kind of histories of very challenging content,

157
0:09:11.368,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and where better than a neighborhood

158
0:09:13.829,000 --> 0:09:17,000
with young people who are constantly asking themselves about their identity

159
0:09:18.099,000 --> 0:09:2,000
to talk about some of the complexities

160
0:09:20.354,000 --> 0:09:21,000
of race and class?

161
0:09:22.896,000 --> 0:09:25,000
In some ways, the bank represents a hub,

162
0:09:26.623,000 --> 0:09:31,000
that we're trying to create a pretty hardcore node of cultural activity,

163
0:09:31.975,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and that if we could start to make multiple hubs

164
0:09:34.842,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and connect some cool green stuff around there,

165
0:09:37.791,000 --> 0:09:39,000
that the buildings that we've purchased and rehabbed,

166
0:09:40.74,000 --> 0:09:43,000
which is now around 60 or 70 units,

167
0:09:44.014,000 --> 0:09:49,000
that if we could land miniature Versailles on top of that,

168
0:09:49.447,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and connect these buildings by a beautiful greenbelt --

169
0:09:52.93,000 --> 0:09:54,000
(Applause) --

170
0:09:55.855,000 --> 0:09:58,000
that this place where people never wanted to be

171
0:09:59.315,000 --> 0:10:01,000
would become an important destination

172
0:10:01.776,000 --> 0:10:03,000
for folk from all over the country and world.

173
0:10:05.027,000 --> 0:10:08,000
In some ways, it feels very much like I'm a potter,

174
0:10:08.812,000 --> 0:10:11,000
that we tackle the things that are at our wheel,

175
0:10:12.225,000 --> 0:10:14,000
we try with the skill that we have

176
0:10:14.488,000 --> 0:10:18,000
to think about this next bowl that I want to make.

177
0:10:19.028,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And it went from a bowl to a singular house to a block to a neighborhood

178
0:10:23.927,000 --> 0:10:25,000
to a cultural district to thinking about the city,

179
0:10:26.621,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and at every point, there were things that I didn't know that I had to learn.

180
0:10:30.707,000 --> 0:10:33,000
I've never learned so much about zoning law in my life.

181
0:10:33.749,000 --> 0:10:34,000
I never thought I'd have to.

182
0:10:35.529,000 --> 0:10:37,000
But as a result of that, I'm finding that there's not just room

183
0:10:38.486,000 --> 0:10:39,000
for my own artistic practice,

184
0:10:40.227,000 --> 0:10:42,000
there's room for a lot of other artistic practices.

185
0:10:43.803,000 --> 0:10:44,000
So people started asking us,

186
0:10:45.382,000 --> 0:10:47,000
"Well, Theaster, how are you going to go to scale?"

187
0:10:47.853,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and, "What's your sustainability plan?"

188
0:10:49.988,000 --> 0:10:53,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

189
0:10:54.739,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And what I found was that I couldn't export myself,

190
0:10:58.616,000 --> 0:11:01,000
that what seems necessary in cities like Akron, Ohio,

191
0:11:02.355,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and Detroit, Michigan, and Gary, Indiana,

192
0:11:04.955,000 --> 0:11:07,000
is that there are people in those places who already believe in those places,

193
0:11:08.653,000 --> 0:11:1,000
that are already dying to make those places beautiful,

194
0:11:11.579,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and that often, those people who are passionate about a place

195
0:11:15.038,000 --> 0:11:19,000
are disconnected from the resources necessary to make cool things happen,

196
0:11:19.45,000 --> 0:11:21,000
or disconnected from a contingency of people

197
0:11:22.027,000 --> 0:11:23,000
that could help make things happen.

198
0:11:23.908,000 --> 0:11:27,000
So now, we're starting to give advice around the country

199
0:11:28.2,000 --> 0:11:3,000
on how to start with what you got,

200
0:11:30.345,000 --> 0:11:32,000
how to start with the things that are in front of you,

201
0:11:33.14,000 --> 0:11:35,000
how to make something out of nothing,

202
0:11:35.517,000 --> 0:11:39,000
how to reshape your world at a wheel or at your block

203
0:11:40.045,000 --> 0:11:42,000
or at the scale of the city.

204
0:11:42.53,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Thank you so much.

205
0:11:44.225,000 --> 0:11:49,000
(Applause)

206
0:11:51.695,000 --> 0:11:54,000
June Cohen: Thank you. So I think many people watching this

207
0:11:55.201,000 --> 0:11:58,000
will be asking themselves the question you just raised at the end:

208
0:11:58.406,000 --> 0:12:,000
How can they do this in their own city?

209
0:12:00.588,000 --> 0:12:01,000
You can't export yourself.

210
0:12:02.209,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Give us a few pages out of your playbook about what someone who is inspired

211
0:12:05.882,000 --> 0:12:07,000
about their city can do to take on projects like yours?

212
0:12:08.772,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Theaster Gates: One of the things I've found that's really important

213
0:12:11.965,000 --> 0:12:15,000
is giving thought to not just the kind of individual project,

214
0:12:16.052,000 --> 0:12:18,000
like an old house,

215
0:12:18.846,000 --> 0:12:2,000
but what's the relationship between an old house,

216
0:12:21.717,000 --> 0:12:24,000
a local school, a small bodega,

217
0:12:24.875,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and is there some kind of synergy between those things?

218
0:12:27.871,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Can you get those folk talking?

219
0:12:30.169,000 --> 0:12:34,000
I've found that in cases where neighborhoods have failed,

220
0:12:34.72,000 --> 0:12:36,000
they still often have a pulse.

221
0:12:36.903,000 --> 0:12:39,000
How do you identify the pulse in that place, the passionate people,

222
0:12:40.362,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and then how do you get folk who have been fighting,

223
0:12:43.367,000 --> 0:12:47,000
slogging for 20 years, reenergized about the place that they live?

224
0:12:47.758,000 --> 0:12:49,000
And so someone has to do that work.

225
0:12:50.219,000 --> 0:12:54,000
If I were a traditional developer, I would be talking about buildings alone,

226
0:12:54.492,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and then putting a "For Lease" sign in the window.

227
0:12:58.439,000 --> 0:13:,000
I think that you actually have to curate more than that,

228
0:13:01.086,000 --> 0:13:03,000
that there's a way in which you have to be mindful about,

229
0:13:03.784,000 --> 0:13:06,000
what are the businesses that I want to grow here?

230
0:13:06.84,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And then, are there people who live in this place

231
0:13:09.282,000 --> 0:13:11,000
who want to grow those businesses with me?

232
0:13:11.302,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Because I think it's not just a cultural space or housing;

233
0:13:14.135,000 --> 0:13:17,000
there has to be the recreation of an economic core.

234
0:13:17.177,000 --> 0:13:2,000
So thinking about those things together feels right.

235
0:13:20.845,000 --> 0:13:22,000
JC: It's hard to get people to create the spark again

236
0:13:23.651,000 --> 0:13:25,000
when people have been slogging for 20 years.

237
0:13:25.698,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Are there any methods you've found that have helped break through?

238
0:13:28.815,000 --> 0:13:3,000
TG: Yeah, I think that now there are lots of examples

239
0:13:31.782,000 --> 0:13:32,000
of folk who are doing amazing work,

240
0:13:33.616,000 --> 0:13:37,000
but those methods are sometimes like, when the media is constantly saying

241
0:13:38.051,000 --> 0:13:4,000
that only violent things happen in a place,

242
0:13:41.023,000 --> 0:13:44,000
then based on your skill set and the particular context,

243
0:13:44.32,000 --> 0:13:47,000
what are the things that you can do in your neighborhood

244
0:13:47.64,000 --> 0:13:49,000
to kind of fight some of that?

245
0:13:49.765,000 --> 0:13:51,000
So I've found that if you're a theater person,

246
0:13:52.668,000 --> 0:13:54,000
you have outdoor street theater festivals.

247
0:13:54.943,000 --> 0:13:57,000
In some cases, we don't have the resources in certain neighborhoods

248
0:13:58.867,000 --> 0:14:01,000
to do things that are a certain kind of splashy,

249
0:14:02.211,000 --> 0:14:05,000
but if we can then find ways of making sure that people

250
0:14:05.322,000 --> 0:14:06,000
who are local to a place,

251
0:14:06.854,000 --> 0:14:09,000
plus people who could be supportive of the things that are happening locally,

252
0:14:10.686,000 --> 0:14:11,000
when those people get together,

253
0:14:12.45,000 --> 0:14:14,000
I think really amazing things can happen.

254
0:14:14.586,000 --> 0:14:15,000
JC: So interesting.

255
0:14:16.072,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And how can you make sure that the projects you're creating

256
0:14:18.394,000 --> 0:14:19,000
are actually for the disadvantaged

257
0:14:20.159,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and not just for the sort of vegetarian indie movie crowd

258
0:14:24.199,000 --> 0:14:26,000
that might move in to take advantage of them.

259
0:14:26.318,000 --> 0:14:31,000
TG: Right on. So I think this is where it starts to get into the thick weeds.

260
0:14:31.359,000 --> 0:14:33,000
JC: Let's go there. TG: Right now, Grand Crossing

261
0:14:33.996,000 --> 0:14:35,000
is 99 percent black, or at least living,

262
0:14:36.993,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and we know that maybe who owns property in a place

263
0:14:40.313,000 --> 0:14:42,000
is different from who walks the streets every day.

264
0:14:42.774,000 --> 0:14:44,000
So it's reasonable to say that Grand Crossing is already

265
0:14:45.63,000 --> 0:14:48,000
in the process of being something different than it is today.

266
0:14:49.485,000 --> 0:14:54,000
But are there ways to think about housing trusts or land trusts

267
0:14:55.08,000 --> 0:14:57,000
or a mission-based development

268
0:14:57.518,000 --> 0:14:59,000
that starts to protect some of the space that happens,

269
0:15:00.281,000 --> 0:15:04,000
because when you have 7,500 empty lots in a city,

270
0:15:04.6,000 --> 0:15:05,000
you want something to happen there,

271
0:15:06.551,000 --> 0:15:1,000
but you need entities that are not just interested in the development piece,

272
0:15:11.055,000 --> 0:15:14,000
but entities that are interested in the stabilization piece,

273
0:15:14.143,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and I feel like often the developer piece is really motivated,

274
0:15:17.649,000 --> 0:15:2,000
but the other work of a kind of neighborhood consciousness,

275
0:15:21.016,000 --> 0:15:22,000
that part doesn't live anymore.

276
0:15:22.99,000 --> 0:15:26,000
So how do you start to grow up important watchdogs

277
0:15:27.796,000 --> 0:15:29,000
that ensure that the resources that are made available

278
0:15:30.518,000 --> 0:15:31,000
to new folk that are coming in

279
0:15:31.954,000 --> 0:15:34,000
are also distributed to folk who have lived in a place for a long time.

280
0:15:35.346,000 --> 0:15:37,000
JC: That makes so much sense. One more question:

281
0:15:37.955,000 --> 0:15:41,000
You make such a compelling case for beauty and the importance of beauty and the arts.

282
0:15:42.002,000 --> 0:15:45,000
There would be others who would argue that funds would be better spent

283
0:15:45.28,000 --> 0:15:48,000
on basic services for the disadvantaged.

284
0:15:48.484,000 --> 0:15:51,000
How do you combat that viewpoint, or come against it?

285
0:15:52.194,000 --> 0:15:54,000
TG: I believe that beauty is a basic service.

286
0:15:54.694,000 --> 0:16:,000
(Applause)

287
0:16:02.333,000 --> 0:16:05,000
Often what I have found is that when there are resources

288
0:16:06.168,000 --> 0:16:09,000
that have not been made available to certain under-resourced cities

289
0:16:09.628,000 --> 0:16:11,000
or neighborhoods or communities,

290
0:16:11.694,000 --> 0:16:15,000
that sometimes culture is the thing that helps to ignite,

291
0:16:16.397,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and that I can't do everything,

292
0:16:19.037,000 --> 0:16:22,000
but I think that there's a way in which if you can start with culture

293
0:16:22.444,000 --> 0:16:24,000
and get people kind of reinvested in their place,

294
0:16:25.416,000 --> 0:16:29,000
other kinds of adjacent amenities start to grow,

295
0:16:29.689,000 --> 0:16:32,000
and then people can make a demand that's a poetic demand,

296
0:16:33.642,000 --> 0:16:38,000
and the political demands that are necessary to wake up our cities,

297
0:16:38.883,000 --> 0:16:39,000
they also become very poetic.

298
0:16:40.646,000 --> 0:16:41,000
JC: It makes perfect sense to me.

299
0:16:42.558,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Theaster, thank you so much for being here with us today.

300
0:16:45.225,000 --> 0:16:46,000
Thank you. Theaster Gates.

301
0:16:46.476,000 --> 0:16:51,000
(Applause)

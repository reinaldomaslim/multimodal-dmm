1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I spent the better part of a decade

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
looking at American responses to mass atrocity and genocide.

3
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And I'd like to start by sharing with you one moment

4
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that to me sums up what there is to know

5
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
about American and democratic responses to mass atrocity.

6
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And that moment came on April 21, 1994.

7
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
So 14 years ago, almost, in the middle of the Rwandan genocide,

8
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
in which 800,000 people would be systematically exterminated

9
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
by the Rwandan government and some extremist militia.

10
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
On April 21, in the New York Times,

11
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
the paper reported that somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000 people

12
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
had already been killed in the genocide.

13
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
It was in the paper -- not on the front page.

14
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
It was a lot like the Holocaust coverage,

15
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
it was buried in the paper.

16
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Rwanda itself was not seen as newsworthy,

17
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and amazingly, genocide itself was not seen as newsworthy.

18
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
But on April 21, a wonderfully honest moment occurred.

19
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And that was that an American congresswoman

20
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
named Patricia Schroeder from Colorado

21
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
met with a group of journalists.

22
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And one of the journalists said to her, what's up?

23
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
What's going on in the U.S. government?

24
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Two to 300,000 people have just been exterminated

25
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
in the last couple of weeks in Rwanda.

26
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
It's two weeks into the genocide at that time,

27
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
but of course, at that time you don't know how long it's going to last.

28
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And the journalist said, why is there so little response out of Washington?

29
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Why no hearings, no denunciations,

30
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
no people getting arrested in front of the Rwandan embassy

31
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
or in front of the White House? What's the deal?

32
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And she said -- she was so honest -- she said, "It's a great question.

33
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
All I can tell you is that in my congressional office in Colorado

34
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and my office in Washington,

35
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
we're getting hundreds and hundreds of calls

36
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
about the endangered ape and gorilla population in Rwanda,

37
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
but nobody is calling about the people.

38
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
The phones just aren't ringing about the people."

39
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And the reason I give you this moment is there's a deep truth in it.

40
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And that truth is, or was, in the 20th century,

41
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
that while we were beginning to develop endangered species movements,

42
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
we didn't have an endangered people's movement.

43
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
We had Holocaust education in the schools.

44
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Most of us were groomed not only on images of nuclear catastrophe,

45
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
but also on images and knowledge of the Holocaust.

46
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
There's a museum, of course, on the Mall in Washington,

47
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
right next to Lincoln and Jefferson.

48
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I mean, we have owned Never Again culturally,

49
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
appropriately, interestingly.

50
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And yet the politicization of Never Again,

51
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
the operationalization of Never Again,

52
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
had never occurred in the 20th century.

53
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And that's what that moment with Patricia Schroeder I think shows:

54
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
that if we are to bring about an end to the world's worst atrocities,

55
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
we have to make it such.

56
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
There has to be a role --

57
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
there has to be the creation of political noise and political costs

58
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
in response to massive crimes against humanity, and so forth.

59
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So that was the 20th century.

60
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Now here -- and this will be a relief to you at this point in the afternoon --

61
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
there is good news, amazing news, in the 21st century,

62
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and that is that, almost out of nowhere, there has come into being

63
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
an anti-genocide movement, an anti-genocide constituency,

64
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and one that looks destined, in fact, to be permanent.

65
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
It grew up in response to the atrocities in Darfur.

66
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It is comprised of students. There are something like 300 anti-genocide chapters

67
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
on college campuses around the country.

68
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
It's bigger than the anti-apartheid movement.

69
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
There are something like 500 high school chapters

70
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
devoted to stopping the genocide in Darfur.

71
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Evangelicals have joined it. Jewish groups have joined it.

72
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
"Hotel Rwanda" watchers have joined it. It is a cacophonous movement.

73
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
To call it a movement, as with all movements, perhaps, is a little misleading.

74
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
It's diverse. It's got a lot of different approaches.

75
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
It's got all the ups and the downs of movements.

76
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
But it has been amazingly successful in one regard,

77
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
in that it has become,

78
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
it has congealed into this endangered people's movement

79
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
that was missing in the 20th century.

80
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
It sees itself, such as it is, the it,

81
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
as something that will create the impression that there will be political cost,

82
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
there will be a political price to be paid,

83
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
for allowing genocide, for not having an heroic imagination,

84
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
for not being an upstander but for being, in fact, a bystander.

85
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Now because it's student-driven,

86
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
there's some amazing things that the movement has done.

87
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
They have launched a divestment campaign

88
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
that has now convinced, I think, 55 universities in 22 states

89
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
to divest their holdings of stocks

90
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
with regard to companies doing business in Sudan.

91
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
They have a 1-800-GENOCIDE number --

92
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
this is going to sound very kitsch,

93
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
but for those of you who may not be, I mean, may be apolitical,

94
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
but interested in doing something about genocide,

95
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
you dial 1-800-GENOCIDE and you type in your zip code,

96
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and you don't even have to know who your congressperson is.

97
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
It will refer you directly to your congressperson, to your U.S. senator,

98
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
to your governor where divestment legislation is pending.

99
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
They've lowered the transaction costs of stopping genocide.

100
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I think the most innovative thing they've introduced recently

101
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
are genocide grades.

102
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And it takes students to introduce genocide grades.

103
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
So what you now have when a Congress is in session

104
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
is members of Congress calling up these 19-year-olds or 24-year-olds

105
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and saying, I'm just told I have a D minus on genocide;

106
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
what do I do to get a C? I just want to get a C. Help me.

107
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And the students and the others

108
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
who are part of this incredibly energized base

109
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
are there to answer that, and there's always something to do.

110
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Now, what this movement has done is it has extracted from the Bush administration

111
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
from the United States,

112
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
at a time of massive over-stretch -- military, financial, diplomatic --

113
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
a whole series of commitments to Darfur

114
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that no other country in the world is making.

115
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
For instance, the referral of the crimes in Darfur

116
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
to the International Criminal Court,

117
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
which the Bush administration doesn't like.

118
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
The expenditure of 3 billion dollars in refugee camps to try to keep,

119
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
basically, the people who've been displaced from their homes

120
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
by the Sudanese government, by the so-called Janjaweed, the militia,

121
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
to keep those people alive

122
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
until something more durable can be achieved.

123
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And recently, or now not that recently,

124
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
about six months ago, the authorization of a peacekeeping force

125
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
of 26,000 that will go.

126
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And that's all the Bush administration's leadership,

127
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and it's all because of this bottom-up pressure

128
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and the fact that the phones haven't stopped ringing

129
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
from the beginning of this crisis.

130
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
The bad news, however, to this question of will evil prevail,

131
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
is that evil lives on.

132
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
The people in those camps are surrounded on all sides

133
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
by so-called Janjaweed, these men on horseback

134
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
with spears and Kalashnikovs.

135
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Women who go to get firewood in order to heat the humanitarian aid

136
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
in order to feed their families -- humanitarian aid,

137
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
the dirty secret of it is it has to be heated, really, to be edible --

138
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:45,000
are themselves subjected to rape,

139
0:07:45.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
which is a tool of the genocide that is being used.

140
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And the peacekeepers I've mentioned, the force has been authorized,

141
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
but almost no country on Earth has stepped forward since the authorization

142
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
to actually put its troops or its police in harm's way.

143
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So we have achieved an awful lot relative to the 20th century,

144
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and yet far too little relative to the gravity of the crime that is unfolding

145
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
as we sit here, as we speak.

146
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Why the limits to the movement?

147
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Why is what has been achieved, or what the movement has done,

148
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
been necessary but not sufficient to the crime?

149
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I think there are a couple -- there are many reasons --

150
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
but a couple just to focus on briefly.

151
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
The first is that the movement, such as it is,

152
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
stops at America's borders. It is not a global movement.

153
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
It does not have too many compatriots abroad who themselves

154
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
are asking their governments to do more to stop genocide.

155
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And the Holocaust culture that we have in this country

156
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
makes Americans, sort of, more prone to, I think,

157
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
want to bring Never Again to life.

158
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
The guilt that the Clinton administration expressed,

159
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
that Bill Clinton expressed over Rwanda,

160
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
created a space in our society for a consensus

161
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that Rwanda was bad and wrong

162
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and we wish we had done more, and that is something

163
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
that the movement has taken advantage of.

164
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
European governments, for the most part,

165
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
haven't acknowledged responsibility, and there's nothing to kind of

166
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
to push back and up against.

167
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
So this movement, if it's to be durable and global,

168
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
will have to cross borders, and you will have to see

169
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
other citizens in democracies, not simply resting on the assumption

170
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that their government would do something in the face of genocide,

171
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
but actually making it such.

172
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Governments will never gravitate towards crimes of this magnitude

173
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
naturally or eagerly.

174
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:31,000
As we saw, they haven't even gravitated towards protecting our ports

175
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
or reigning in loose nukes.

176
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Why would we expect in a bureaucracy that it would orient itself

177
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
towards distant suffering?

178
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
So one reason is it hasn't gone global.

179
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
The second is, of course, that at this time in particular in America's history,

180
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
we have a credibility problem,

181
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
a legitimacy problem in international institutions.

182
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
It is structurally really, really hard to do,

183
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
as the Bush administration rightly does,

184
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
which is to denounce genocide on a Monday

185
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and then describe water boarding on a Tuesday as a no-brainer

186
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and then turn up on Wednesday and look for troop commitments.

187
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Now, other countries have their own reasons for not wanting to get involved.

188
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Let me be clear.

189
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
They're in some ways using the Bush administration as an alibi.

190
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:17,000
But it is essential for us to be a leader in this sphere,

191
0:10:17.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
of course to restore our standing and our leadership in the world.

192
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
The recovery's going to take some time.

193
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
We have to ask ourselves, what now? What do we do going forward

194
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
as a country and as citizens in relationship to the world's worst places,

195
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
the world's worst suffering, killers, and the kinds of killers

196
0:10:35.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
that could come home to roost sometime in the future?

197
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:46,000
The place that I turned to answer that question was to a man

198
0:10:46.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that many of you may not have ever heard of,

199
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and that is a Brazilian named Sergio Vieira de Mello who,

200
0:10:54.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
as Chris said, was blown up in Iraq in 2003.

201
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:03,000
He was the victim of the first-ever suicide bomb in Iraq.

202
0:11:03.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
It's hard to remember, but there was actually a time in the summer of 2003,

203
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
even after the U.S. invasion, where,

204
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
apart from looting, civilians were relatively safe in Iraq.

205
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Now, who was Sergio? Sergio Vieira de Mello was his name.

206
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
In addition to being Brazilian, he was described to me

207
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
before I met him in 1994 as someone who was a cross between

208
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
James Bond on the one hand and Bobby Kennedy on the other.

209
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And in the U.N., you don't get that many people

210
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:32,000
who actually manage to merge those qualities.

211
0:11:32.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
He was James Bond-like in that he was ingenious.

212
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
He was drawn to the flames, he chased the flames,

213
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:42,000
he was like a moth to the flames. Something of an adrenalin junkie.

214
0:11:42.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
He was successful with women.

215
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
He was Bobby Kennedy-like because in some ways one could never tell

216
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
if he was a realist masquerading as an idealist

217
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
or an idealist masquerading as a realist, as people always wondered

218
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
about Bobby Kennedy and John Kennedy in that way.

219
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
What he was was a decathlete of nation-building, of problem-solving,

220
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
of troubleshooting in the world's worst places

221
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and in the world's most broken places.

222
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
In failing states, genocidal states, under-governed states,

223
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
precisely the kinds of places that threats to this country exist

224
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
on the horizon, and precisely the kinds of places

225
0:12:22.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
where most of the world's suffering tends to get concentrated.

226
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
These are the places he was drawn to.

227
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
He moved with the headlines.

228
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
He was in the U.N. for 34 years. He joined at the age of 21.

229
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Started off when the causes in the wars du jour in the '70s

230
0:12:38.33,000 --> 0:12:4,000
were wars of independence and decolonization.

231
0:12:40.33,000 --> 0:12:42,000
He was there in Bangladesh

232
0:12:42.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
dealing with the outflow of millions of refugees --

233
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:47,000
the largest refugee flow in history up to that point.

234
0:12:47.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
He was in Sudan when the civil war broke out there.

235
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
He was in Cyprus right after the Turkish invasion.

236
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:55,000
He was in Mozambique for the War of Independence.

237
0:12:55.33,000 --> 0:12:58,000
He was in Lebanon. Amazingly, he was in Lebanon -- the U.N. base was used --

238
0:12:58.33,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Palestinians staged attacks out from behind the U.N. base.

239
0:13:02.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Israel then invaded and overran the U.N. base.

240
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Sergio was in Beirut when the U.S. Embassy was hit

241
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
by the first-ever suicide attack against the United States.

242
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
People date the beginning of this new era to 9/11, but surely 1983,

243
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
with the attack on the US Embassy and the Marine barracks --

244
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
which Sergio witnessed -- those are, in fact, in some ways,

245
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:24,000
the dawning of the era that we find ourselves in today.

246
0:13:24.33,000 --> 0:13:27,000
From Lebanon he went to Bosnia in the '90s.

247
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
The issues were, of course, ethnic sectarian violence.

248
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
He was the first person to negotiate with the Khmer Rouge.

249
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Talk about evil prevailing. I mean, here he was in the room

250
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:39,000
with the embodiment of evil in Cambodia.

251
0:13:39.33,000 --> 0:13:41,000
He negotiates with the Serbs.

252
0:13:41.33,000 --> 0:13:45,000
He actually crosses so far into this realm of talking to evil

253
0:13:45.33,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and trying to convince evil that it doesn't need to prevail

254
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
that he earns the nickname -- not Sergio but Serbio

255
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
while he's living in the Balkans and conducting these kinds of negotiations.

256
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
He then goes to Rwanda and to Congo in the aftermath of the genocide,

257
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and he's the guy who has to decide -- huh, OK, the genocide is over;

258
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
800,000 people have been killed; the people responsible are fleeing

259
0:14:06.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
into neighboring countries -- into Congo, into Tanzania.

260
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
I'm Sergio, I'm a humanitarian, and I want to feed those --

261
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
well, I don't want to feed the killers

262
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
but I want to feed the two million people who are with them, so we're going to go,

263
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
we're going to set up camps,

264
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and we're going to supply humanitarian aid.

265
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
But, uh-oh, the killers are within the camps.

266
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Well, I'd like to separate the sheep from the wolves.

267
0:14:26.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Let me go door-to-door to the international community

268
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and see if anybody will give me police or troops to do the separation.

269
0:14:31.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
And their response, of course, was no more than we wanted

270
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
to stop the genocide and put our troops in harm's way to do that,

271
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
nor do we now want to get in the way and pluck genocidaires from camps.

272
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
So then you have to make the decision.

273
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Do you turn off the international spigot of life support

274
0:14:46.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and risk two million civilian lives?

275
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Or do you continue feeding the civilians, knowing that the genocidaires

276
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
are in the camps, literally sharpening their knives for future battle?

277
0:14:57.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
What do you do?

278
0:14:58.33,000 --> 0:15:01,000
It's all lesser-evil terrain in these broken places.

279
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Late '90s: nation-building is the cause du jour.

280
0:15:04.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
He's the guy put in charge. He's the Paul Bremer or the Jerry Bremer

281
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:11,000
of first Kosovo and then East Timor. He governs the places.

282
0:15:11.33,000 --> 0:15:15,000
He's the viceroy. He has to decide on tax policy, on currency,

283
0:15:15.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
on border patrol, on policing. He has to make all these judgments.

284
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:22,000
He's a Brazilian in these places. He speaks seven languages.

285
0:15:22.33,000 --> 0:15:24,000
He's been up to that point in 14 war zones

286
0:15:24.33,000 --> 0:15:27,000
so he's positioned to make better judgments, perhaps,

287
0:15:27.33,000 --> 0:15:29,000
than people who have never done that kind of work.

288
0:15:29.33,000 --> 0:15:33,000
But nonetheless, he is the cutting edge of our experimentation

289
0:15:33.33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
with doing good with very few resources being brought to bear in,

290
0:15:36.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
again, the world's worst places.

291
0:15:38.33,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And then after Timor, 9/11 has happened,

292
0:15:41.33,000 --> 0:15:43,000
he's named U.N. Human Rights Commissioner,

293
0:15:43.33,000 --> 0:15:46,000
and he has to balance liberty and security and figure out,

294
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:49,000
what do you do when the most powerful country in the United Nations

295
0:15:49.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
is bowing out of the Geneva Conventions,

296
0:15:52.33,000 --> 0:15:54,000
bowing out of international law? Do you denounce?

297
0:15:54.33,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Well, if you denounce,

298
0:15:55.33,000 --> 0:15:57,000
you're probably never going to get back in the room.

299
0:15:57.33,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Maybe you stay reticent. Maybe you try to charm President Bush --

300
0:16:02.33,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and that's what he did. And in so doing he earned himself,

301
0:16:05.33,000 --> 0:16:08,000
unfortunately, his final and tragic appointment to Iraq --

302
0:16:08.33,000 --> 0:16:1,000
the one that resulted in his death.

303
0:16:10.33,000 --> 0:16:13,000
One note on his death, which is so devastating,

304
0:16:13.33,000 --> 0:16:15,000
is that despite predicating the war on Iraq

305
0:16:15.33,000 --> 0:16:2,000
on a link between Saddam Hussein and terrorism in 9/11,

306
0:16:20.33,000 --> 0:16:23,000
believe it or not, the Bush administration or the invaders

307
0:16:23.33,000 --> 0:16:27,000
did no planning, no pre-war planning, to respond to terrorism.

308
0:16:27.33,000 --> 0:16:31,000
So Sergio -- this receptacle of all of this learning on how to deal with evil

309
0:16:31.33,000 --> 0:16:33,000
and how to deal with brokenness,

310
0:16:33.33,000 --> 0:16:37,000
lay under the rubble for three and a half hours without rescue.

311
0:16:37.33,000 --> 0:16:41,000
Stateless. The guy who tried to help the stateless people his whole career.

312
0:16:41.33,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Like a refugee. Because he represents the U.N.

313
0:16:43.33,000 --> 0:16:46,000
If you represent everyone, in some ways you represent no one.

314
0:16:46.33,000 --> 0:16:48,000
You're un-owned.

315
0:16:48.33,000 --> 0:16:51,000
And what the American -- the most powerful military in the history of mankind

316
0:16:51.33,000 --> 0:16:53,000
was able to muster for his rescue,

317
0:16:53.33,000 --> 0:16:57,000
believe it or not, was literally these heroic two American soldiers

318
0:16:57.33,000 --> 0:16:59,000
went into the shaft. Building was shaking.

319
0:16:59.33,000 --> 0:17:03,000
One of them had been at 9/11 and lost his buddies on September 11th,

320
0:17:03.33,000 --> 0:17:05,000
and yet went in and risked his life in order to save Sergio.

321
0:17:05.33,000 --> 0:17:09,000
But all they had was a woman's handbag --

322
0:17:09.33,000 --> 0:17:11,000
literally one of those basket handbags --

323
0:17:11.33,000 --> 0:17:15,000
and they tied it to a curtain rope from one of the offices at U.N. headquarters,

324
0:17:15.33,000 --> 0:17:2,000
and created a pulley system into this shaft in this quivering building

325
0:17:20.33,000 --> 0:17:23,000
in the interests of rescuing this person,

326
0:17:23.33,000 --> 0:17:26,000
the person we most need to turn to now, this shepherd,

327
0:17:26.33,000 --> 0:17:29,000
at a time when so many of us feel like we're lacking guidance.

328
0:17:29.33,000 --> 0:17:32,000
And this was the pulley system. This was what we were able to muster for Sergio.

329
0:17:32.33,000 --> 0:17:34,000
The good news, for what it's worth,

330
0:17:34.33,000 --> 0:17:38,000
is after Sergio and 21 others were killed that day in the attack on the U.N.,

331
0:17:38.33,000 --> 0:17:4,000
the military created a search and rescue unit

332
0:17:40.33,000 --> 0:17:44,000
that had the cutting equipment, the shoring wood, the cranes,

333
0:17:44.33,000 --> 0:17:46,000
the things that you would have needed to do the rescue.

334
0:17:46.33,000 --> 0:17:48,000
But it was too late for Sergio.

335
0:17:48.33,000 --> 0:17:5,000
I want to wrap up, but I want to close

336
0:17:50.33,000 --> 0:17:54,000
with what I take to be the four lessons from Sergio's life

337
0:17:54.33,000 --> 0:17:57,000
on this question of how do we prevent evil from prevailing,

338
0:17:57.33,000 --> 0:18:,000
which is how I would have framed the question.

339
0:18:00.33,000 --> 0:18:03,000
Here's this guy who got a 34-year head start

340
0:18:03.33,000 --> 0:18:07,000
thinking about the kinds of questions we as a country are grappling with,

341
0:18:07.33,000 --> 0:18:12,000
we as citizens are grappling with now. What do we take away?

342
0:18:12.33,000 --> 0:18:17,000
First, I think, is his relationship to, in fact, evil is something to learn from.

343
0:18:17.33,000 --> 0:18:2,000
He, over the course of his career, changed a great deal.

344
0:18:20.33,000 --> 0:18:22,000
He had a lot of flaws, but he was very adaptive.

345
0:18:22.33,000 --> 0:18:24,000
I think that was his greatest quality.

346
0:18:24.33,000 --> 0:18:28,000
He started as somebody who would denounce harmdoers,

347
0:18:28.33,000 --> 0:18:31,000
he would charge up to people who were violating international law,

348
0:18:31.33,000 --> 0:18:33,000
and he would say, you're violating, this is the U.N. Charter.

349
0:18:33.33,000 --> 0:18:35,000
Don't you see it's unacceptable what you're doing?

350
0:18:35.33,000 --> 0:18:38,000
And they would laugh at him because he didn't have the power of states,

351
0:18:38.33,000 --> 0:18:4,000
the power of any military or police.

352
0:18:40.33,000 --> 0:18:43,000
He just had the rules, he had the norms, and he tried to use them.

353
0:18:43.33,000 --> 0:18:46,000
And in Lebanon, Southern Lebanon in '82,

354
0:18:46.33,000 --> 0:18:49,000
he said to himself and to everybody else,

355
0:18:49.33,000 --> 0:18:52,000
I will never use the word "unacceptable" again.

356
0:18:52.33,000 --> 0:18:54,000
I will never use it. I will try to make it such,

357
0:18:54.33,000 --> 0:18:56,000
but I will never use that word again.

358
0:18:56.33,000 --> 0:18:58,000
But he lunged in the opposite direction.

359
0:18:58.33,000 --> 0:19:01,000
He started, as I mentioned, to get in the room with evil,

360
0:19:01.33,000 --> 0:19:05,000
to not denounce, and became almost obsequious

361
0:19:05.33,000 --> 0:19:08,000
when he won the nickname Serbio, for instance,

362
0:19:08.33,000 --> 0:19:1,000
and even when he negotiated with the Khmer Rouge

363
0:19:10.33,000 --> 0:19:14,000
would black-box what had occurred prior to entering the room.

364
0:19:14.33,000 --> 0:19:17,000
But by the end of his life, I think he had struck a balance

365
0:19:17.33,000 --> 0:19:19,000
that we as a country can learn from.

366
0:19:19.33,000 --> 0:19:23,000
Be in the room, don't be afraid of talking to your adversaries,

367
0:19:23.33,000 --> 0:19:27,000
but don't bracket what happened before you entered the room.

368
0:19:27.33,000 --> 0:19:32,000
Don't black-box history. Don't check your principles at the door.

369
0:19:32.33,000 --> 0:19:35,000
And I think that's something that we have to be in the room,

370
0:19:35.33,000 --> 0:19:39,000
whether it's Nixon going to China or Khrushchev and Kennedy

371
0:19:39.33,000 --> 0:19:41,000
or Reagan and Gorbachev.

372
0:19:41.33,000 --> 0:19:45,000
All the great progress in this country with relation to our adversaries

373
0:19:45.33,000 --> 0:19:47,000
has come by going into the room.

374
0:19:47.33,000 --> 0:19:5,000
And it doesn't have to be an act of weakness.

375
0:19:50.33,000 --> 0:19:53,000
You can actually do far more to build an international coalition

376
0:19:53.33,000 --> 0:19:56,000
against a harmdoer or a wrongdoer by being in the room

377
0:19:56.33,000 --> 0:19:59,000
and showing to the rest of the world that that person, that regime,

378
0:19:59.33,000 --> 0:20:02,000
is the problem and that you, the United States, are not the problem.

379
0:20:02.33,000 --> 0:20:06,000
Second take-away from Sergio's life, briefly.

380
0:20:06.33,000 --> 0:20:08,000
What I take away, and this in some ways is the most important,

381
0:20:08.33,000 --> 0:20:14,000
he espoused and exhibited a reverence for dignity

382
0:20:14.33,000 --> 0:20:16,000
that was really, really unusual.

383
0:20:16.33,000 --> 0:20:2,000
At a micro level, the individuals around him were visible.

384
0:20:20.33,000 --> 0:20:21,000
He saw them.

385
0:20:21.33,000 --> 0:20:23,000
At a macro level, he thought, you know,

386
0:20:23.33,000 --> 0:20:26,000
we talk about democracy promotion, but we do it in a way sometimes

387
0:20:26.33,000 --> 0:20:29,000
that's an affront to people's dignity.

388
0:20:29.33,000 --> 0:20:31,000
We put people on humanitarian aid

389
0:20:31.33,000 --> 0:20:33,000
and we boast about it because we've spent three billion.

390
0:20:33.33,000 --> 0:20:34,000
It's incredibly important,

391
0:20:34.33,000 --> 0:20:36,000
those people would no longer be alive if the United States, for instance,

392
0:20:36.33,000 --> 0:20:39,000
hadn't spent that money in Darfur,

393
0:20:39.33,000 --> 0:20:4,000
but it's not a way to live.

394
0:20:40.33,000 --> 0:20:43,000
If we think about dignity in our conduct as citizens

395
0:20:43.33,000 --> 0:20:46,000
and as individuals with relation to the people around us,

396
0:20:46.33,000 --> 0:20:48,000
and as a country, if we could inject a regard for dignity

397
0:20:48.33,000 --> 0:20:51,000
into our dealings with other countries,

398
0:20:51.33,000 --> 0:20:53,000
it would be something of a revolution.

399
0:20:53.33,000 --> 0:20:57,000
Third point, very briefly. He talked a lot about freedom from fear.

400
0:20:57.33,000 --> 0:21:,000
And I recognize there is so much to be afraid of.

401
0:21:00.33,000 --> 0:21:02,000
There are so many genuine threats in the world.

402
0:21:02.33,000 --> 0:21:04,000
But what Sergio was talking about is,

403
0:21:04.33,000 --> 0:21:06,000
let's calibrate our relationship to the threat.

404
0:21:06.33,000 --> 0:21:09,000
Let's not hype the threat; let's actually see it clearly.

405
0:21:09.33,000 --> 0:21:12,000
We have reason to be afraid of melting ice caps.

406
0:21:12.33,000 --> 0:21:15,000
We have reason to be afraid that we haven't secured

407
0:21:15.33,000 --> 0:21:18,000
loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union.

408
0:21:18.33,000 --> 0:21:22,000
Let's focus on what are the legitimate challenges and threats,

409
0:21:22.33,000 --> 0:21:27,000
but not lunge into bad decisions because of a panic, of a fear.

410
0:21:27.33,000 --> 0:21:29,000
In times of fear, for instance, one of the things Sergio used to say

411
0:21:29.33,000 --> 0:21:31,000
is, fear is a bad advisor.

412
0:21:31.33,000 --> 0:21:33,000
We lunge towards the extremes

413
0:21:33.33,000 --> 0:21:35,000
when we aren't operating and trying to, again,

414
0:21:35.33,000 --> 0:21:37,000
calibrate our relationship to the world around us.

415
0:21:37.33,000 --> 0:21:4,000
Fourth and final point: he somehow, because he was working

416
0:21:40.33,000 --> 0:21:43,000
in all the world's worst places and all lesser evils,

417
0:21:43.33,000 --> 0:21:45,000
had a humility, of course,

418
0:21:45.33,000 --> 0:21:48,000
and an awareness of the complexity of the world around him.

419
0:21:48.33,000 --> 0:21:5,000
I mean, such an acute awareness of how hard it was.

420
0:21:50.33,000 --> 0:21:54,000
How Sisyphean this task was of mending,

421
0:21:54.33,000 --> 0:21:56,000
and yet aware of that complexity,

422
0:21:56.33,000 --> 0:21:59,000
humbled by it, he wasn't paralyzed by it.

423
0:21:59.33,000 --> 0:22:04,000
And we as citizens, as we go through this experience of the kind of,

424
0:22:04.33,000 --> 0:22:08,000
the crisis of confidence, crisis of competence, crisis of legitimacy,

425
0:22:08.33,000 --> 0:22:11,000
I think there's a temptation to pull back from the world and say,

426
0:22:11.33,000 --> 0:22:13,000
ah, Katrina, Iraq -- we don't know what we're doing.

427
0:22:13.33,000 --> 0:22:16,000
We can't afford to pull back from the world.

428
0:22:16.33,000 --> 0:22:19,000
It's a question of how to be in the world.

429
0:22:19.33,000 --> 0:22:2,000
And the lesson, I think,

430
0:22:20.33,000 --> 0:22:22,000
of the anti-genocide movement that I mentioned,

431
0:22:22.33,000 --> 0:22:24,000
that is a partial success but by no means

432
0:22:24.33,000 --> 0:22:27,000
has it achieved what it has set out to do --

433
0:22:27.33,000 --> 0:22:3,000
it'll be many decades, probably, before that happens --

434
0:22:30.33,000 --> 0:22:34,000
but is that if we want to see change, we have to become the change.

435
0:22:34.33,000 --> 0:22:38,000
We can't rely upon our institutions to do the work

436
0:22:38.33,000 --> 0:22:42,000
of necessarily talking to adversaries on their own

437
0:22:42.33,000 --> 0:22:44,000
without us creating a space for that to happen,

438
0:22:44.33,000 --> 0:22:46,000
for having respect for dignity,

439
0:22:46.33,000 --> 0:22:48,000
and for bringing that combination of humility

440
0:22:48.33,000 --> 0:22:51,000
and a sort of emboldened sense of responsibility

441
0:22:51.33,000 --> 0:22:53,000
to our dealings with the rest of the world.

442
0:22:53.33,000 --> 0:22:55,000
So will evil prevail? Is that the question?

443
0:22:55.33,000 --> 0:22:59,000
I think the short answer is: no, not unless we let it.

444
0:22:59.33,000 --> 0:23:,000
Thank you.

445
0:23:00.33,000 --> 0:23:03,000
(Applause)

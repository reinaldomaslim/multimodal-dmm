1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I just want to say my name is Emmanuel Jal.

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
And I come from a long way.

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I've been telling a story that has been so painful for me.

4
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It's been a tough journey for me, traveling the world,

5
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
telling my story in form of a book.

6
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And also telling it like now.

7
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And also, the easiest one was

8
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
when I was doing it in form of a music.

9
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So I have branded myself as a war child.

10
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I'm doing this

11
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
because of an old lady in my village now,

12
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
who have lost her children.

13
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
There is no newspaper to cover her pain,

14
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
and what she wants to change in this society.

15
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And I'm doing it for a young man

16
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
who want to create a change and has no way to project his voice

17
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
because he can't write.

18
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Or there is no Internet, like Facebook, MySpace,

19
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
YouTube, for them to talk.

20
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Also one thing that kept me pushing this story,

21
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
this painful stories out, the dreams I have,

22
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
sometimes, is like the voices of the dead,

23
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that I have seen

24
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
would tell me, "Don't give up. Keep on going."

25
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Because sometime I feel like stopping and not doing it,

26
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
because I didn't know what I was putting myself into.

27
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Well I was born in the most difficult time,

28
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
when my country was at war.

29
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I saw my village burned down.

30
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
The world that meant a lot to me, I saw it

31
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
vanish in my face.

32
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I saw my aunt in rape when I was only five.

33
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
My mother was claimed by the war.

34
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
My brothers and sisters were scattered.

35
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And up to now, me and my father

36
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
were detached and I still have issues with him.

37
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Seeing people die every day,

38
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
my mother crying,

39
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
it's like I was raised in a violence.

40
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And that made me call myself a war child.

41
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And not only that, when I was eight

42
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I became a child soldier.

43
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I didn't know what was the war for.

44
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
But one thing I knew

45
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
was an image that I saw that stuck in my head.

46
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
When I went to the training camp I say,

47
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
"I want to kill as many Muslims,

48
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and as many Arabs, as possible."

49
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
The training wasn't easy, but that was the driving force,

50
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
because I wanted to revenge for my family.

51
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I wanted to revenge for my village.

52
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Luckily now things have changed

53
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
because I came to discover the truth.

54
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
What was actually killing us wasn't the Muslims,

55
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
wasn't the Arabs.

56
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
It was somebody sitting somewhere manipulating the system,

57
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and using religion to get what they want to get out of us,

58
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
which is the oil, the diamond,

59
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
the gold and the land.

60
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So realizing the truth gave me a position to choose:

61
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
should I continue to hate, or let it go?

62
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So I happened to forgive. Now I sing

63
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
music with the Muslims. I dance with them.

64
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I even had a movie out called "War Child,"

65
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
funded by Muslim people.

66
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So that pain has gone out.

67
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
But my story is huge.

68
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So I'm just going to go into a different step now,

69
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
which is easier for me.

70
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I'm going to give you poem

71
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
called "Forced to Sin,"

72
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
which is from my album "War Child."

73
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I talk about my story.

74
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
One of the journey that I tread

75
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
when I was tempted to eat my friend because we had no food

76
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and we were like around 400.

77
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And only 16 people survived that journey.

78
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So I hope you're going to hear this.

79
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
My dreams are like torment.

80
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
My every moment.

81
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Voices in my brain, of friends that was slain.

82
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Friends like Lual who died by my side,

83
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
of starvation.

84
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
In the burning jungle, and the desert plain.

85
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Next was I, but Jesus heard my cry.

86
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
As I was tempted to eat the rotten flesh

87
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
of my comrade,

88
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
he gave me comfort.

89
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
We used to raid villages,

90
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
stealing chickens, goats and sheeps,

91
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
anything we could eat.

92
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I knew it was rude, but we needed food.

93
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And therefore I was forced to sin,

94
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
forced to sin to make a living,

95
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
forced to sin to make a living.

96
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Sometimes you gotta lose to win.

97
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Never give up. Never give in.

98
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Left home at the age of seven.

99
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
One year later, live with an AK-47 by my side.

100
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Slept with one eye open wide.

101
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Run, duck, play dead and hide.

102
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I've seen my people die like flies.

103
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
But I've never seen a dead body,

104
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
at least one that I've killed.

105
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
But still as I wonder, I won't go under.

106
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Guns barking like lightning and thunder.

107
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
As a child so young and tender,

108
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Words I can't forget I still remember.

109
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
I saw sergeant command raising his hand,

110
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
no retreat, no surrender.

111
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I carry the banner of the trauma.

112
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
War child, child without a mama,

113
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
still fighting in the saga.

114
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Yet as I wage this new war I'm not alone in this drama.

115
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
No sit or stop, as I reach for the top

116
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I'm fully dedicated like a patriotic cop.

117
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I'm on a fight, day and night.

118
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Sometime I do wrong in order to make things right.

119
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
It's like I'm living a dream.

120
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
First time I'm feeling like a human being.

121
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Ah! The children of Darfur.

122
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Your empty bellies on the telly and now it's you

123
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
that I'm fighting for.

124
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Left home.

125
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Don't even know the day I'll ever return.

126
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
My country is war-torn.

127
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Music I used to hear was bombs and fire of guns.

128
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So many people die that I don't even cry no more.

129
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Ask God question, what am I here for.

130
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And why are my people poor.

131
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And why, why when the rest of the children were learning how to read and write,

132
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I was learning how to fight.

133
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I ate snails, vultures, rabbits,

134
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
snakes, and anything that had life.

135
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I was ready to eat.

136
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I know it's a shame. But who is to be blamed?

137
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
That's my story shared in the form of a lesson.

138
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
(Applause)

139
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Thank you.

140
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
(Applause)

141
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
What energized me and kept me going is the music I do.

142
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I never saw anybody

143
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
to tell my story to them

144
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
so they could advise me or do therapy.

145
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
So the music had been my therapy for me.

146
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
It's been where I actually see heaven,

147
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
where I can be happy,

148
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
where I can be a child again, in dances, through music.

149
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So one thing I know about music:

150
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
music is the only thing that has power

151
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
to enter your cell system,

152
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
your mind, your heart,

153
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
influence your soul and your spirit,

154
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and can even influence the way you live

155
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
without even you knowing.

156
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Music is the only thing that can

157
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
make you want to wake up your bed

158
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and shake your leg,

159
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
without even wanting to do it.

160
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And so the power music has

161
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I normally compare to the power love

162
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
when love doesn't see a color.

163
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
You know, if you fall in love with a frog, that's it.

164
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
One testimony about how I find music

165
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
is powerful is when

166
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I was still a soldier back then.

167
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I hated the people in the north.

168
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
But I don't know why I don't hate their music.

169
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
So we party and dance to their music.

170
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And one thing that shocked me is one day

171
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
they brought an Arab musician

172
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
to come and entertain the soldiers.

173
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And I almost broke my leg dancing to his music.

174
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
But I had this question.

175
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So now I'm doing music so I know what the power of music is.

176
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
So what's happening here?

177
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
I've been in a painful journey.

178
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Today is day number 233

179
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
in which I only eat dinner.

180
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I don't eat breakfast. No lunch.

181
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And I've done a campaign called

182
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Lose to Win.

183
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Where I'm losing so that I could win

184
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
the battle that I'm fighting now.

185
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So my breakfast, my lunch,

186
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I donate it to a charity that I founded

187
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
because we want to build a school in Sudan.

188
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And I'm doing this because also

189
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
it's a normal thing in my home, people eat one meal a day.

190
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Here I am in the West. I choose not to.

191
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
So in my village now, kids there,

192
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
they normally listen to BBC, or any radio,

193
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and they are waiting to know,

194
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
the day Emmanuel will eat his breakfast

195
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
it means he got the money to build our school.

196
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And so I made a commitment. I say,

197
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
"I'm gonna not eat my breakfast."

198
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
I thought I was famous enough that I would raise the money within one month,

199
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
but I've been humbled.

200
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
(Laughter)

201
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
So it's taken me 232 days.

202
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And I said, "No stop until we get it."

203
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And like it's been done on Facebook, MySpace.

204
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
The people are giving three dollars.

205
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
The lowest amount we ever got was 20 cents.

206
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Somebody donated 20 cents online.

207
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I don't know how they did it.

208
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
(Laughter)

209
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
But that moved me.

210
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And so, the importance of education to me

211
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
is what I'm willing to die for.

212
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
I'm willing to die for this,

213
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
because I know what it can do to my people.

214
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Education enlighten your brain,

215
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
give you so many chances,

216
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and you're able to survive.

217
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
As a nation we have been crippled.

218
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
For so many years we have fed on aid.

219
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
You see a 20-years-old, 30-years-old

220
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
families in a refugee camps.

221
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
They only get the food that drops from the sky, from the U.N.

222
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
So these people,

223
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
you're killing a whole generation if you just give them aid.

224
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
If anybody want to help us

225
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
this is what we need.

226
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Give us tools. Give the farmers tools.

227
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
It's rain. Africa is fertile. They can grow the crops.

228
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
(Applause)

229
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Invest in education.

230
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Education so that we have strong institution

231
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
that can create a revolution to change everything.

232
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Because we have all those old men

233
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that are creating wars in Africa. They will die soon.

234
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
But if you invest in education

235
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
then we'll be able to change Africa.

236
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
That's what I'm asking.

237
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
(Applause)

238
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
So in order to do that,

239
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
I founded a charter called Gua Africa,

240
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
where we put kids in school.

241
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And now we have a couple in university.

242
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
We have like 40 kids, ex-child soldiers

243
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
mixed with anybody that we feel like we want to support.

244
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And I said "I'm going to put it in practice."

245
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And with the people that are going to follow me and help me do things.

246
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
That's what I want to do to change,

247
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
to make a difference in the world.

248
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Well now, my time is going,

249
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
so I want to sing a song.

250
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
But I'll ask you guys to stand up

251
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
so we celebrate the life of a British aid worker

252
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
called Emma McCune

253
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
that made it possible for me to be here.

254
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
I'm gonna sing this song,

255
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
just to inspire you how this woman has made a difference.

256
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
She came to my country and saw the importance

257
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
of education.

258
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
She said the only way to help Sudan

259
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
is to invest in the women, educating them,

260
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
educating the children,

261
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
so that they could come and create a revolution

262
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
in this complex society.

263
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
So she even ended up marrying a commander

264
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
from the SPLA.

265
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And she rescued over 150 child soldiers.

266
0:13:10.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
One of them happened to be me now.

267
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And so at this moment I want to ask to celebrate Emma with me.

268
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Are you guys ready to celebrate Emma?

269
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Audience: Yes!

270
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Emmanuel Jal: All right.

271
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000

1
0:00:12.95,000 --> 0:00:15,000
The Olympic motto is "Citius, Altius, Fortius."

2
0:00:16.081,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Faster, Higher, Stronger.

3
0:00:18.85,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And athletes have fulfilled that motto rapidly.

4
0:00:22.79,000 --> 0:00:25,000
The winner of the 2012 Olympic marathon

5
0:00:25.946,000 --> 0:00:27,000
ran two hours and eight minutes.

6
0:00:28.262,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Had he been racing against the winner

7
0:00:29.882,000 --> 0:00:31,000
of the 1904 Olympic marathon,

8
0:00:32.348,000 --> 0:00:35,000
he would have won by nearly an hour and a half.

9
0:00:35.681,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Now we all have this feeling

10
0:00:37.453,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that we're somehow just getting better

11
0:00:39.043,000 --> 0:00:41,000
as a human race, inexorably progressing,

12
0:00:41.383,000 --> 0:00:43,000
but it's not like we've evolved into a new species

13
0:00:43.524,000 --> 0:00:44,000
in a century.

14
0:00:44.99,000 --> 0:00:46,000
So what's going on here?

15
0:00:47.598,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I want to take a look at what's really behind

16
0:00:48.959,000 --> 0:00:5,000
this march of athletic progress.

17
0:00:51.649,000 --> 0:00:53,000
In 1936, Jesse Owens

18
0:00:53.946,000 --> 0:00:55,000
held the world record in the 100 meters.

19
0:00:56.283,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Had Jesse Owens been racing last year

20
0:00:58.99,000 --> 0:01:,000
in the world championships of the 100 meters,

21
0:01:01.436,000 --> 0:01:03,000
when Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt finished,

22
0:01:03.91,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Owens would have still had 14 feet to go.

23
0:01:07.318,000 --> 0:01:08,000
That's a lot in sprinter land.

24
0:01:09.197,000 --> 0:01:1,000
To give you a sense of how much it is,

25
0:01:10.7,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I want to share with you a demonstration

26
0:01:12.658,000 --> 0:01:15,000
conceived by sports scientist Ross Tucker.

27
0:01:15.67,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Now picture the stadium last year

28
0:01:17.835,000 --> 0:01:19,000
at the world championships of the 100 meters:

29
0:01:20.464,000 --> 0:01:22,000
thousands of fans waiting with baited breath

30
0:01:22.563,000 --> 0:01:25,000
to see Usain Bolt, the fastest man in history;

31
0:01:26.037,000 --> 0:01:28,000
flashbulbs popping as the nine fastest men in the world

32
0:01:28.912,000 --> 0:01:3,000
coil themselves into their blocks.

33
0:01:31.475,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And I want you to pretend

34
0:01:32.606,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that Jesse Owens is in that race.

35
0:01:34.945,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Now close your eyes for a second and picture the race.

36
0:01:38.19,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Bang! The gun goes off.

37
0:01:39.882,000 --> 0:01:41,000
An American sprinter jumps out to the front.

38
0:01:41.95,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Usain Bolt starts to catch him.

39
0:01:43.9,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Usain Bolt passes him, and as the runners come to the finish,

40
0:01:45.521,000 --> 0:01:47,000
you'll hear a beep as each man crosses the line.

41
0:01:48.198,000 --> 0:01:49,000
(Beeps)

42
0:01:49.875,000 --> 0:01:52,000
That's the entire finish of the race.

43
0:01:52.98,000 --> 0:01:53,000
You can open your eyes now.

44
0:01:54.36,000 --> 0:01:56,000
That first beep was Usain Bolt.

45
0:01:56.97,000 --> 0:01:58,000
That last beep was Jesse Owens.

46
0:01:59.284,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Listen to it again.

47
0:02:01.461,000 --> 0:02:02,000
(Beeps)

48
0:02:03.179,000 --> 0:02:04,000
When you think of it like that,

49
0:02:04.279,000 --> 0:02:06,000
it's not that big a difference, is it?

50
0:02:06.55,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And then consider that Usain Bolt started

51
0:02:08.407,000 --> 0:02:1,000
by propelling himself out of blocks

52
0:02:11.17,000 --> 0:02:13,000
down a specially fabricated carpet

53
0:02:13.509,000 --> 0:02:14,000
designed to allow him to travel

54
0:02:15.265,000 --> 0:02:17,000
as fast as humanly possible.

55
0:02:17.381,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Jesse Owens, on the other hand,

56
0:02:19.052,000 --> 0:02:22,000
ran on cinders, the ash from burnt wood,

57
0:02:22.643,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and that soft surface stole far more energy

58
0:02:24.88,000 --> 0:02:25,000
from his legs as he ran.

59
0:02:26.657,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Rather than blocks, Jesse Owens had a gardening trowel

60
0:02:29.62,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that he had to use to dig holes in the cinders to start from.

61
0:02:33.447,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Biomechanical analysis of the speed

62
0:02:35.551,000 --> 0:02:37,000
of Owens' joints shows that had been running

63
0:02:38.095,000 --> 0:02:39,000
on the same surface as Bolt,

64
0:02:39.609,000 --> 0:02:41,000
he wouldn't have been 14 feet behind,

65
0:02:42.12,000 --> 0:02:44,000
he would have been within one stride.

66
0:02:44.439,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Rather than the last beep,

67
0:02:46.181,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Owens would have been the second beep.

68
0:02:49.121,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Listen to it again.

69
0:02:51.172,000 --> 0:02:52,000
(Beeps)

70
0:02:52.91,000 --> 0:02:54,000
That's the difference track surface technology has made,

71
0:02:55.293,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and it's done it throughout the running world.

72
0:02:57.572,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Consider a longer event.

73
0:02:59.303,000 --> 0:03:01,000
In 1954, Sir Roger Bannister

74
0:03:02.266,000 --> 0:03:05,000
became the first man to run under four minutes in the mile.

75
0:03:05.443,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Nowadays, college kids do that every year.

76
0:03:08.493,000 --> 0:03:1,000
On rare occasions, a high school kid does it.

77
0:03:11.046,000 --> 0:03:12,000
As of the end of last year,

78
0:03:12.788,000 --> 0:03:14,000
1,314 men

79
0:03:15.155,000 --> 0:03:17,000
had run under four minutes in the mile,

80
0:03:17.37,000 --> 0:03:18,000
but like Jesse Owens,

81
0:03:18.82,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Sir Roger Bannister ran on soft cinders

82
0:03:21.562,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that stole far more energy from his legs

83
0:03:23.386,000 --> 0:03:25,000
than the synthetic tracks of today.

84
0:03:25.749,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So I consulted biomechanics experts

85
0:03:27.249,000 --> 0:03:29,000
to find out how much slower it is to run on cinders

86
0:03:29.813,000 --> 0:03:3,000
than synthetic tracks,

87
0:03:31.071,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and their consensus that it's one and a half percent slower.

88
0:03:34.471,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So if you apply a one and a half percent slowdown conversion

89
0:03:37.758,000 --> 0:03:39,000
to every man who ran his sub-four mile

90
0:03:39.944,000 --> 0:03:4,000
on a synthetic track,

91
0:03:41.388,000 --> 0:03:42,000
this is what happens.

92
0:03:43.084,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Only 530 are left.

93
0:03:45.413,000 --> 0:03:46,000
If you look at it from that perspective,

94
0:03:46.81,000 --> 0:03:48,000
fewer than ten new men per [year]

95
0:03:49.13,000 --> 0:03:5,000
have joined the sub-four mile club

96
0:03:50.613,000 --> 0:03:52,000
since Sir Roger Bannister.

97
0:03:52.915,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Now, 530 is a lot more than one,

98
0:03:55.982,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and that's partly because there are many more people

99
0:03:57.498,000 --> 0:03:59,000
training today and they're training more intelligently.

100
0:04:00.012,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Even college kids are professional in their training

101
0:04:02.24,000 --> 0:04:03,000
compared to Sir Roger Bannister,

102
0:04:03.766,000 --> 0:04:04,000
who trained for 45 minutes at a time

103
0:04:05.225,000 --> 0:04:08,000
while he ditched gynecology lectures in med school.

104
0:04:08.315,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And that guy who won the 1904 Olympic marathon

105
0:04:10.718,000 --> 0:04:11,000
in three in a half hours,

106
0:04:12.429,000 --> 0:04:14,000
that guy was drinking rat poison and brandy

107
0:04:14.566,000 --> 0:04:16,000
while he ran along the course.

108
0:04:16.598,000 --> 0:04:18,000
That was his idea of a performance-enhancing drug.

109
0:04:19.221,000 --> 0:04:21,000
(Laughter)

110
0:04:21.284,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Clearly, athletes have gotten more savvy

111
0:04:22.972,000 --> 0:04:24,000
about performance-enhancing drugs as well,

112
0:04:25.446,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and that's made a difference in some sports at some times,

113
0:04:27.717,000 --> 0:04:29,000
but technology has made a difference in all sports,

114
0:04:30.004,000 --> 0:04:32,000
from faster skis to lighter shoes.

115
0:04:32.553,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Take a look at the record for the 100-meter freestyle swim.

116
0:04:35.693,000 --> 0:04:37,000
The record is always trending downward,

117
0:04:38.34,000 --> 0:04:4,000
but it's punctuated by these steep cliffs.

118
0:04:41.09,000 --> 0:04:43,000
This first cliff, in 1956, is the introduction

119
0:04:44.011,000 --> 0:04:45,000
of the flip turn.

120
0:04:45.24,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Rather than stopping and turning around,

121
0:04:47.269,000 --> 0:04:48,000
athletes could somersault under the water

122
0:04:49.113,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and get going right away in the opposite direction.

123
0:04:51.631,000 --> 0:04:53,000
This second cliff, the introduction of gutters

124
0:04:54.423,000 --> 0:04:55,000
on the side of the pool

125
0:04:55.955,000 --> 0:04:56,000
that allows water to splash off,

126
0:04:57.512,000 --> 0:04:58,000
rather than becoming turbulence

127
0:04:58.799,000 --> 0:05:,000
that impedes the swimmers as they race.

128
0:05:01.046,000 --> 0:05:02,000
This final cliff,

129
0:05:02.685,000 --> 0:05:03,000
the introduction of full-body

130
0:05:03.871,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and low-friction swimsuits.

131
0:05:05.768,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Throughout sports, technology has changed the face of performance.

132
0:05:09.457,000 --> 0:05:11,000
In 1972, Eddy Merckx set the record

133
0:05:12.233,000 --> 0:05:14,000
for the longest distance cycled in one hour

134
0:05:14.557,000 --> 0:05:18,000
at 30 miles, 3,774 feet.

135
0:05:18.605,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Now that record improved and improved

136
0:05:20.853,000 --> 0:05:23,000
as bicycles improved and became more aerodynamic

137
0:05:23.872,000 --> 0:05:24,000
all the way until 1996,

138
0:05:25.486,000 --> 0:05:29,000
when it was set at 35 miles, 1,531 feet,

139
0:05:29.921,000 --> 0:05:31,000
nearly five miles farther

140
0:05:32.15,000 --> 0:05:35,000
than Eddy Merckx cycled in 1972.

141
0:05:35.295,000 --> 0:05:38,000
But then in 2000, the International Cycling Union

142
0:05:38.718,000 --> 0:05:4,000
decreed that anyone who wanted to hold that record

143
0:05:41.226,000 --> 0:05:44,000
had to do so with essentially the same equipment

144
0:05:44.298,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that Eddy Merckx used in 1972.

145
0:05:46.963,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Where does the record stand today?

146
0:05:49.218,000 --> 0:05:52,000
30 miles, 4,657 feet,

147
0:05:52.84,000 --> 0:05:55,000
a grand total of 883 feet

148
0:05:55.95,000 --> 0:05:56,000
farther than Eddy Merckx cycled

149
0:05:57.726,000 --> 0:05:58,000
more than four decades ago.

150
0:05:59.427,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Essentially the entire improvement in this record

151
0:06:01.808,000 --> 0:06:03,000
was due to technology.

152
0:06:03.86,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Still, technology isn't the only thing pushing athletes forward.

153
0:06:07.03,000 --> 0:06:08,000
While indeed we haven't evolved

154
0:06:08.481,000 --> 0:06:09,000
into a new species in a century,

155
0:06:10.198,000 --> 0:06:11,000
the gene pool within competitive sports

156
0:06:12.158,000 --> 0:06:14,000
most certainly has changed.

157
0:06:14.55,000 --> 0:06:15,000
In the early half of the 20th century,

158
0:06:16.459,000 --> 0:06:17,000
physical education instructors and coaches

159
0:06:18.144,000 --> 0:06:2,000
had the idea that the average body type

160
0:06:20.416,000 --> 0:06:22,000
was the best for all athletic endeavors:

161
0:06:22.787,000 --> 0:06:25,000
medium height, medium weight, no matter the sport.

162
0:06:26.11,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And this showed in athletes' bodies.

163
0:06:28.082,000 --> 0:06:3,000
In the 1920s, the average elite high-jumper

164
0:06:30.335,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and average elite shot-putter were the same exact size.

165
0:06:34.05,000 --> 0:06:35,000
But as that idea started to fade away,

166
0:06:35.96,000 --> 0:06:37,000
as sports scientists and coaches realized that

167
0:06:38.036,000 --> 0:06:39,000
rather than the average body type,

168
0:06:39.628,000 --> 0:06:4,000
you want highly specialized bodies

169
0:06:41.54,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that fit into certain athletic niches,

170
0:06:43.87,000 --> 0:06:45,000
a form of artificial selection took place,

171
0:06:46.175,000 --> 0:06:48,000
a self-sorting for bodies that fit certain sports,

172
0:06:48.798,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and athletes' bodies became more different from one another.

173
0:06:51.458,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Today, rather than the same size as the average elite high jumper,

174
0:06:55.414,000 --> 0:06:56,000
the average elite shot-putter

175
0:06:56.428,000 --> 0:06:57,000
is two and a half inches taller

176
0:06:58.079,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and 130 pounds heavier.

177
0:07:01.168,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And this happened throughout the sports world.

178
0:07:03.087,000 --> 0:07:05,000
In fact, if you plot on a height versus mass graph

179
0:07:05.752,000 --> 0:07:07,000
one data point for each of two dozen sports

180
0:07:08.28,000 --> 0:07:11,000
in the first half of the 20th century, it looks like this.

181
0:07:11.565,000 --> 0:07:12,000
There's some dispersal,

182
0:07:13.05,000 --> 0:07:16,000
but it's kind of grouped around that average body type.

183
0:07:16.06,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Then that idea started to go away,

184
0:07:17.639,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and at the same time, digital technology --

185
0:07:19.34,000 --> 0:07:21,000
first radio, then television and the Internet --

186
0:07:21.547,000 --> 0:07:23,000
gave millions, or in some cases billions, of people

187
0:07:23.924,000 --> 0:07:26,000
a ticket to consume elite sports performance.

188
0:07:27.103,000 --> 0:07:3,000
The financial incentives and fame and glory afforded elite athletes skyrocketed,

189
0:07:30.976,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and it tipped toward the tiny upper echelon of performance.

190
0:07:35.169,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It accelerated the artificial selection for specialized bodies.

191
0:07:38.596,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And if you plot a data point for these same

192
0:07:40.224,000 --> 0:07:43,000
two dozen sports today, it looks like this.

193
0:07:44.106,000 --> 0:07:45,000
The athletes' bodies have gotten

194
0:07:45.533,000 --> 0:07:47,000
much more different from one another.

195
0:07:47.727,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And because this chart looks like the charts

196
0:07:49.836,000 --> 0:07:5,000
that show the expanding universe,

197
0:07:51.567,000 --> 0:07:53,000
with the galaxies flying away from one another,

198
0:07:54.027,000 --> 0:07:55,000
the scientists who discovered it call it

199
0:07:55.671,000 --> 0:07:58,000
"The Big Bang of Body Types."

200
0:07:58.96,000 --> 0:08:,000
In sports where height is prized, like basketball,

201
0:08:01.368,000 --> 0:08:02,000
the tall athletes got taller.

202
0:08:03.158,000 --> 0:08:06,000
In 1983, the National Basketball Association

203
0:08:06.264,000 --> 0:08:07,000
signed a groundbreaking agreement

204
0:08:07.587,000 --> 0:08:09,000
making players partners in the league,

205
0:08:09.639,000 --> 0:08:1,000
entitled to shares of ticket revenues

206
0:08:11.189,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and television contracts.

207
0:08:13.096,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Suddenly, anybody who could be an NBA player

208
0:08:15.299,000 --> 0:08:16,000
wanted to be,

209
0:08:16.495,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and teams started scouring the globe

210
0:08:18.341,000 --> 0:08:2,000
for the bodies that could help them win championships.

211
0:08:20.621,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Almost overnight,

212
0:08:22.364,000 --> 0:08:23,000
the proportion of men in the NBA

213
0:08:23.742,000 --> 0:08:24,000
who are at least seven feet tall doubled

214
0:08:25.634,000 --> 0:08:26,000
to 10 percent.

215
0:08:27.399,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Today, one in 10 men in the NBA

216
0:08:29.422,000 --> 0:08:31,000
is at least seven feet tall,

217
0:08:31.604,000 --> 0:08:33,000
but a seven-foot-tall man is incredibly rare

218
0:08:33.753,000 --> 0:08:34,000
in the general population --

219
0:08:35.272,000 --> 0:08:37,000
so rare that if you know an American man

220
0:08:37.922,000 --> 0:08:38,000
between the ages of 20 and 40

221
0:08:39.327,000 --> 0:08:41,000
who is at least seven feet tall,

222
0:08:41.463,000 --> 0:08:42,000
there's a 17 percent chance

223
0:08:43.235,000 --> 0:08:44,000
he's in the NBA right now.

224
0:08:45.04,000 --> 0:08:47,000
(Laughter)

225
0:08:47.978,000 --> 0:08:49,000
That is, find six honest seven footers,

226
0:08:50.854,000 --> 0:08:53,000
one is in the NBA right now.

227
0:08:54.084,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And that's not the only way that NBA players' bodies are unique.

228
0:08:56.913,000 --> 0:08:58,000
This is Leonardo da Vinci's "Vitruvian Man,"

229
0:08:59.528,000 --> 0:09:,000
the ideal proportions,

230
0:09:00.951,000 --> 0:09:01,000
with arm span equal to height.

231
0:09:02.95,000 --> 0:09:04,000
My arm span is exactly equal to my height.

232
0:09:05.458,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Yours is probably very nearly so.

233
0:09:07.594,000 --> 0:09:09,000
But not the average NBA player.

234
0:09:09.756,000 --> 0:09:11,000
The average NBA player is a shade under 6'7",

235
0:09:12.563,000 --> 0:09:14,000
with arms that are seven feet long.

236
0:09:14.874,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Not only are NBA players ridiculously tall,

237
0:09:17.672,000 --> 0:09:19,000
they are ludicrously long.

238
0:09:19.95,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Had Leonardo wanted to draw

239
0:09:20.955,000 --> 0:09:21,000
the Vitruvian NBA Player,

240
0:09:22.93,000 --> 0:09:23,000
he would have needed a rectangle and an ellipse,

241
0:09:24.903,000 --> 0:09:26,000
not a circle and a square.

242
0:09:27.685,000 --> 0:09:29,000
So in sports where large size is prized,

243
0:09:29.85,000 --> 0:09:31,000
the large athletes have gotten larger.

244
0:09:31.921,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Conversely, in sports where diminutive stature is an advantage,

245
0:09:34.9,000 --> 0:09:36,000
the small athletes got smaller.

246
0:09:37.117,000 --> 0:09:38,000
The average elite female gymnast

247
0:09:38.78,000 --> 0:09:4,000
shrunk from 5'3" to 4'9" on average

248
0:09:41.543,000 --> 0:09:42,000
over the last 30 years,

249
0:09:42.88,000 --> 0:09:44,000
all the better for their power-to-weight ratio

250
0:09:44.995,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and for spinning in the air.

251
0:09:46.765,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And while the large got larger

252
0:09:48.127,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and the small got smaller,

253
0:09:49.491,000 --> 0:09:51,000
the weird got weirder.

254
0:09:51.919,000 --> 0:09:52,000
The average length of the forearm

255
0:09:53.469,000 --> 0:09:54,000
of a water polo player in relation

256
0:09:55.22,000 --> 0:09:56,000
to their total arm got longer,

257
0:09:57.077,000 --> 0:09:59,000
all the better for a forceful throwing whip.

258
0:09:59.206,000 --> 0:10:,000
And as the large got larger,

259
0:10:00.933,000 --> 0:10:02,000
small got smaller, and the weird weirder.

260
0:10:03.303,000 --> 0:10:05,000
In swimming, the ideal body type

261
0:10:05.496,000 --> 0:10:06,000
is a long torso and short legs.

262
0:10:07.391,000 --> 0:10:08,000
It's like the long hull of a canoe

263
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
for speed over the water.

264
0:10:11.036,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And the opposite is advantageous in running.

265
0:10:12.801,000 --> 0:10:14,000
You want long legs and a short torso.

266
0:10:14.816,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And this shows in athletes' bodies today.

267
0:10:17.012,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Here you see Michael Phelps,

268
0:10:18.607,000 --> 0:10:19,000
the greatest swimmer in history,

269
0:10:20.071,000 --> 0:10:22,000
standing next to Hicham El Guerrouj,

270
0:10:22.94,000 --> 0:10:23,000
the world record holder in the mile.

271
0:10:24.927,000 --> 0:10:26,000
These men are seven inches different in height,

272
0:10:27.744,000 --> 0:10:28,000
but because of the body types

273
0:10:28.946,000 --> 0:10:29,000
advantaged in their sports,

274
0:10:30.809,000 --> 0:10:32,000
they wear the same length pants.

275
0:10:33.197,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Seven inches difference in height,

276
0:10:34.691,000 --> 0:10:36,000
these men have the same length legs.

277
0:10:37.211,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Now in some cases, the search for bodies

278
0:10:39.169,000 --> 0:10:4,000
that could push athletic performance forward

279
0:10:41.142,000 --> 0:10:43,000
ended up introducing into the competitive world

280
0:10:43.785,000 --> 0:10:46,000
populations of people that weren't previously competing at all,

281
0:10:46.924,000 --> 0:10:48,000
like Kenyan distance runners.

282
0:10:49.676,000 --> 0:10:52,000
We think of Kenyans as being great marathoners.

283
0:10:53.006,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Kenyans think of the Kalenjin tribe

284
0:10:55.384,000 --> 0:10:57,000
as being great marathoners.

285
0:10:57.484,000 --> 0:10:59,000
The Kalenjin make up just 12 percent

286
0:10:59.579,000 --> 0:11:,000
of the Kenyan population

287
0:11:01.376,000 --> 0:11:03,000
but the vast majority of elite runners.

288
0:11:03.545,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And they happen, on average,

289
0:11:04.851,000 --> 0:11:06,000
to have a certain unique physiology:

290
0:11:06.955,000 --> 0:11:07,000
legs that are very long

291
0:11:08.036,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and very thin at their extremity,

292
0:11:10.574,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and this is because they have their ancestry

293
0:11:11.992,000 --> 0:11:12,000
at very low latitude

294
0:11:13.427,000 --> 0:11:15,000
in a very hot and dry climate,

295
0:11:15.842,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and an evolutionary adaptation to that

296
0:11:17.732,000 --> 0:11:17,000
is limbs that are very long

297
0:11:18.69,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and very thin at the extremity

298
0:11:20.209,000 --> 0:11:21,000
for cooling purposes.

299
0:11:21.983,000 --> 0:11:24,000
It's the same reason that a radiator has long coils,

300
0:11:25.012,000 --> 0:11:26,000
to increase surface area compared to volume

301
0:11:26.854,000 --> 0:11:27,000
to let heat out,

302
0:11:28.796,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and because the leg is like a pendulum,

303
0:11:30.309,000 --> 0:11:31,000
the longer and thinner it is at the extremity,

304
0:11:31.966,000 --> 0:11:33,000
the more energy-efficient it is to swing.

305
0:11:34.745,000 --> 0:11:36,000
To put Kalenjin running success in perspective,

306
0:11:37.339,000 --> 0:11:39,000
consider that 17 American men in history

307
0:11:40.066,000 --> 0:11:42,000
have run faster than two hours and 10 minutes

308
0:11:42.695,000 --> 0:11:43,000
in the marathon.

309
0:11:43.984,000 --> 0:11:46,000
That's a four-minute-and-58-second-per-mile pace.

310
0:11:47.031,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Thirty-two Kalenjin men did that last October.

311
0:11:49.966,000 --> 0:11:51,000
(Laughter)

312
0:11:52.06,000 --> 0:11:53,000
That's from a source population the size

313
0:11:53.881,000 --> 0:11:55,000
of metropolitan Atlanta.

314
0:11:56.708,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Still, even changing technology

315
0:11:58.282,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and the changing gene pool in sports

316
0:11:59.888,000 --> 0:12:01,000
don't account for all of the changes in performance.

317
0:12:02.361,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Athletes have a different mindset than they once did.

318
0:12:05.251,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Have you ever seen in a movie when someone gets

319
0:12:06.62,000 --> 0:12:07,000
an electrical shock

320
0:12:07.892,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and they're thrown across a room?

321
0:12:10.215,000 --> 0:12:11,000
There's no explosion there.

322
0:12:11.786,000 --> 0:12:12,000
What's happening when that happens is that

323
0:12:13.024,000 --> 0:12:14,000
the electrical impulse is causing

324
0:12:14.486,000 --> 0:12:16,000
all their muscle fibers to twitch at once,

325
0:12:16.616,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and they're throwing themselves across the room.

326
0:12:19.21,000 --> 0:12:2,000
They're essentially jumping.

327
0:12:21.107,000 --> 0:12:22,000
That's the power

328
0:12:22.284,000 --> 0:12:23,000
that's contained in the human body.

329
0:12:24.233,000 --> 0:12:26,000
But normally we can't access nearly all of it.

330
0:12:26.46,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Our brain acts as a limiter,

331
0:12:28.479,000 --> 0:12:3,000
preventing us from accessing all of our physical resources,

332
0:12:30.774,000 --> 0:12:31,000
because we might hurt ourselves,

333
0:12:32.015,000 --> 0:12:33,000
tearing tendons or ligaments.

334
0:12:33.707,000 --> 0:12:36,000
But the more we learn about how that limiter functions,

335
0:12:36.73,000 --> 0:12:37,000
the more we learn how we can push it back

336
0:12:38.61,000 --> 0:12:39,000
just a bit,

337
0:12:40.05,000 --> 0:12:42,000
in some cases by convincing the brain

338
0:12:42.482,000 --> 0:12:43,000
that the body won't be in mortal danger

339
0:12:44.256,000 --> 0:12:45,000
by pushing harder.

340
0:12:46.066,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Endurance and ultra-endurance sports

341
0:12:47.685,000 --> 0:12:48,000
serve as a great example.

342
0:12:49.257,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Ultra-endurance was once thought to be harmful

343
0:12:51.379,000 --> 0:12:52,000
to human health,

344
0:12:52.794,000 --> 0:12:53,000
but now we realize

345
0:12:54.212,000 --> 0:12:55,000
that we have all these traits

346
0:12:55.308,000 --> 0:12:58,000
that are perfect for ultra-endurance:

347
0:12:58.412,000 --> 0:13:,000
no body fur and a glut of sweat glands

348
0:13:01.336,000 --> 0:13:02,000
that keep us cool while running;

349
0:13:02.952,000 --> 0:13:05,000
narrow waists and long legs compared to our frames;

350
0:13:06.352,000 --> 0:13:08,000
large surface area of joints for shock absorption.

351
0:13:09.27,000 --> 0:13:11,000
We have an arch in our foot that acts like a spring,

352
0:13:12.004,000 --> 0:13:14,000
short toes that are better for pushing off

353
0:13:14.107,000 --> 0:13:15,000
than for grasping tree limbs,

354
0:13:15.781,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and when we run,

355
0:13:16.908,000 --> 0:13:17,000
we can turn our torso and our shoulders

356
0:13:18.433,000 --> 0:13:2,000
like this while keeping our heads straight.

357
0:13:20.477,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Our primate cousins can't do that.

358
0:13:21.96,000 --> 0:13:23,000
They have to run like this.

359
0:13:24.27,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And we have big old butt muscles

360
0:13:26.336,000 --> 0:13:28,000
that keep us upright while running.

361
0:13:28.423,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Have you ever looked at an ape's butt?

362
0:13:30.141,000 --> 0:13:33,000
They have no buns because they don't run upright.

363
0:13:33.146,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And as athletes have realized

364
0:13:34.533,000 --> 0:13:36,000
that we're perfectly suited for ultra-endurance,

365
0:13:37.09,000 --> 0:13:38,000
they've taken on feats

366
0:13:38.137,000 --> 0:13:4,000
that would have been unthinkable before,

367
0:13:40.546,000 --> 0:13:43,000
athletes like Spanish endurance racer Kílian Jornet.

368
0:13:44.449,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Here's Kílian running up the Matterhorn.

369
0:13:46.449,000 --> 0:13:47,000
(Laughter)

370
0:13:47.961,000 --> 0:13:49,000
With a sweatshirt there tied around his waist.

371
0:13:50.57,000 --> 0:13:51,000
It's so steep he can't even run here.

372
0:13:52.292,000 --> 0:13:53,000
He's pulling up on a rope.

373
0:13:53.945,000 --> 0:13:54,000
This is a vertical ascent

374
0:13:55.282,000 --> 0:13:57,000
of more than 8,000 feet,

375
0:13:57.391,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and Kílian went up and down

376
0:13:59.058,000 --> 0:14:01,000
in under three hours.

377
0:14:01.439,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Amazing.

378
0:14:03.358,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And talented though he is,

379
0:14:04.547,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Kílian is not a physiological freak.

380
0:14:07.371,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Now that he has done this,

381
0:14:09.05,000 --> 0:14:1,000
other athletes will follow,

382
0:14:10.961,000 --> 0:14:11,000
just as other athletes followed

383
0:14:12.478,000 --> 0:14:13,000
after Sir Roger Bannister

384
0:14:14.052,000 --> 0:14:16,000
ran under four minutes in the mile.

385
0:14:16.19,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Changing technology, changing genes,

386
0:14:17.817,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and a changing mindset.

387
0:14:20.215,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Innovation in sports,

388
0:14:21.999,000 --> 0:14:22,000
whether that's new track surfaces

389
0:14:23.656,000 --> 0:14:24,000
or new swimming techniques,

390
0:14:25.12,000 --> 0:14:26,000
the democratization of sport,

391
0:14:26.99,000 --> 0:14:27,000
the spread to new bodies

392
0:14:28.331,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and to new populations around the world,

393
0:14:30.916,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and imagination in sport,

394
0:14:32.969,000 --> 0:14:33,000
an understanding of what the human body

395
0:14:34.405,000 --> 0:14:35,000
is truly capable of,

396
0:14:36.186,000 --> 0:14:37,000
have conspired to make athletes stronger,

397
0:14:38.078,000 --> 0:14:4,000
faster, bolder,

398
0:14:40.601,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and better than ever.

399
0:14:42.578,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Thank you very much.

400
0:14:44.934,000 --> 0:14:47,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
How do you feed a city?

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It's one of the great questions of our time.

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Yet it's one that's rarely asked.

4
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
We take it for granted that if we go into a shop

5
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
or restaurant, or indeed into this theater's foyer in about an hour's time,

6
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
there is going to be food there waiting for us,

7
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
having magically come from somewhere.

8
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
But when you think that every day for a city the size of London,

9
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
enough food has to be produced,

10
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
transported, bought and sold,

11
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
cooked, eaten, disposed of,

12
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and that something similar has to happen every day

13
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
for every city on earth,

14
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
it's remarkable that cities get fed at all.

15
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
We live in places like this as if

16
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
they're the most natural things in the world,

17
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
forgetting that because we're animals

18
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and that we need to eat,

19
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
we're actually as dependent on the natural world

20
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
as our ancient ancestors were.

21
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And as more of us move into cities,

22
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
more of that natural world is being

23
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me --

24
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
it's soybean fields in Mato Grosso in Brazil --

25
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
in order to feed us.

26
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
These are extraordinary landscapes,

27
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
but few of us ever get to see them.

28
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And increasingly these landscapes

29
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
are not just feeding us either.

30
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
As more of us move into cities,

31
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
more of us are eating meat,

32
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
so that a third of the annual grain crop globally

33
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
now gets fed to animals

34
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
rather than to us human animals.

35
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And given that it takes three times as much grain --

36
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
actually ten times as much grain --

37
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
to feed a human if it's passed through an animal first,

38
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that's not a very efficient way of feeding us.

39
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And it's an escalating problem too.

40
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
By 2050, it's estimated that twice the number

41
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
of us are going to be living in cities.

42
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And it's also estimated that there is going to be twice as much

43
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
meat and dairy consumed.

44
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand.

45
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And that's going to pose an enormous problem.

46
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Six billion hungry carnivores to feed,

47
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
by 2050.

48
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
That's a big problem. And actually if we carry on as we are,

49
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
it's a problem we're very unlikely to be able to solve.

50
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year

51
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
to create new arable land.

52
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Although at the same time we're losing an equivalent amount

53
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
of existing arables to salinization and erosion.

54
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
We're very hungry for fossil fuels too.

55
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
It takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie

56
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
of food that we consume in the West.

57
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And even though there is food that we are producing at great cost,

58
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
we don't actually value it.

59
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Half the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away.

60
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And to end all of this, at the end of this long process,

61
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
we're not even managing to feed the planet properly.

62
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
A billion of us are obese, while a further billion starve.

63
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
None of it makes very much sense.

64
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food now

65
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
is controlled by just five multinational corporations,

66
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
it's a grim picture.

67
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
As we're moving into cities, the world is also embracing a Western diet.

68
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And if we look to the future,

69
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
it's an unsustainable diet.

70
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So how did we get here?

71
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And more importantly, what are we going to do about it?

72
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Well, to answer the slightly easier question first,

73
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
about 10,000 years ago, I would say,

74
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
is the beginning of this process

75
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
in the ancient Near East,

76
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
known as the Fertile Crescent.

77
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Because, as you can see, it was crescent shaped.

78
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And it was also fertile.

79
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And it was here, about 10,000 years ago,

80
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that two extraordinary inventions,

81
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
agriculture and urbanism, happened

82
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
roughly in the same place and at the same time.

83
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
This is no accident,

84
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
because agriculture and cities are bound together. They need each other.

85
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Because it was discovery of grain

86
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
by our ancient ancestors for the first time

87
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that produced a food source that was large enough

88
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and stable enough to support permanent settlements.

89
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And if we look at what those settlements were like,

90
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
we see they were compact.

91
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
They were surrounded by productive farm land

92
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and dominated by large temple complexes

93
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
like this one at Ur,

94
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that were, in fact, effectively,

95
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
spiritualized, central food distribution centers.

96
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Because it was the temples that organized the harvest,

97
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
gathered in the grain, offered it to the gods,

98
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and then offered the grain that the gods didn't eat back to the people.

99
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So, if you like,

100
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities

101
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
was dominated by the grain and the harvest

102
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
that sustained them.

103
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And in fact, that's true of every ancient city.

104
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
But of course not all of them were that small.

105
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Famously, Rome had about a million citizens

106
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
by the first century A.D.

107
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So how did a city like this feed itself?

108
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
The answer is what I call "ancient food miles."

109
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Basically, Rome had access to the sea,

110
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away.

111
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
This is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world,

112
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
because it was very difficult to transport food over roads,

113
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
which were rough.

114
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And the food obviously went off very quickly.

115
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So Rome effectively waged war

116
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
on places like Carthage and Egypt

117
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
just to get its paws on their grain reserves.

118
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And, in fact, you could say that the expansion of the Empire

119
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
was really sort of one long, drawn out

120
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
militarized shopping spree, really.

121
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
(Laughter)

122
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
In fact -- I love the fact, I just have to mention this:

123
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Rome in fact used to import oysters from London,

124
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
at one stage. I think that's extraordinary.

125
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So Rome shaped its hinterland

126
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
through its appetite.

127
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
But the interesting thing is that the other thing also

128
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
happened in the pre-industrial world.

129
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
If we look at a map of London in the 17th century,

130
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
we can see that its grain, which is coming in from the Thames,

131
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
along the bottom of this map.

132
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
So the grain markets were to the south of the city.

133
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And the roads leading up from them

134
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
to Cheapside, which was the main market,

135
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
were also grain markets.

136
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And if you look at the name of one of those streets,

137
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Bread Street, you can tell

138
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
what was going on there 300 years ago.

139
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And the same of course was true for fish.

140
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Fish was, of course, coming in by river as well. Same thing.

141
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And of course Billingsgate, famously, was London's fish market,

142
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
operating on-site here until the mid-1980s.

143
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Which is extraordinary, really, when you think about it.

144
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Everybody else was wandering around

145
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
with mobile phones that looked like bricks

146
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port.

147
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
This is another thing about food in cities:

148
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Once its roots into the city are established,

149
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
they very rarely move.

150
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Meat is a very different story

151
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
because, of course, animals could walk into the city.

152
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So much of London's meat

153
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
was coming from the northwest,

154
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
from Scotland and Wales.

155
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So it was coming in, and arriving at the city at the northwest,

156
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
which is why Smithfield,

157
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
London's very famous meat market, was located up there.

158
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Poultry was coming in from East Anglia and so on, to the northeast.

159
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I feel a bit like a weather woman doing this. Anyway,

160
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and so the birds were coming in

161
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
with their feet protected with little canvas shoes.

162
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And then when they hit the eastern end

163
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
of Cheapside, that's where they were sold,

164
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
which is why it's called Poultry.

165
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And, in fact, if you look at the map of any city

166
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
built before the industrial age,

167
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
you can trace food coming in to it.

168
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
You can actually see how it was physically shaped by food,

169
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
both by reading the names of the streets, which give you a lot of clues.

170
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Friday Street, in a previous life,

171
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
is where you went to buy your fish on a Friday.

172
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
But also you have to imagine it full of food.

173
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Because the streets and the public spaces

174
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
were the only places where food was bought and sold.

175
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And if we look at an image of Smithfield in 1830

176
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this

177
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and be unaware of where your food came from.

178
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
In fact, if you were having Sunday lunch,

179
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window

180
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
about three days earlier.

181
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
So this was obviously an organic city,

182
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
part of an organic cycle.

183
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And then 10 years later everything changed.

184
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
This is an image of the Great Western in 1840.

185
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And as you can see, some of the earliest train passengers

186
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
were pigs and sheep.

187
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So all of a sudden, these animals are no longer walking into market.

188
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
They're being slaughtered out of sight and mind,

189
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
somewhere in the countryside.

190
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And they're coming into the city by rail.

191
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And this changes everything.

192
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
To start off with, it makes it possible

193
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
for the first time to grow cities,

194
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
really any size and shape, in any place.

195
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Cities used to be constrained by geography;

196
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means.

197
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
All of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography.

198
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
And as you can see from these maps of London,

199
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
in the 90 years after the trains came,

200
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed

201
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
by animals coming in on foot, and so on,

202
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
to a large splurge,

203
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
that would be very, very difficult to feed with anybody on foot,

204
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
either animals or people.

205
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And of course that was just the beginning. After the trains came cars,

206
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and really this marks the end of this process.

207
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
It's the final emancipation of the city

208
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
from any apparent relationship with nature at all.

209
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And this is the kind of city that's devoid of smell,

210
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
devoid of mess, certainly devoid of people,

211
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape.

212
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
In fact, what they did to get food was they got in their cars,

213
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts,

214
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
came back with a week's worth of shopping,

215
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and wondered what on earth to do with it.

216
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And this really is the moment when our relationship,

217
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
both with food and cities, changes completely.

218
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Here we have food -- that used to be the center,

219
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
the social core of the city -- at the periphery.

220
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
It used to be a social event, buying and selling food.

221
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Now it's anonymous.

222
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
We used to cook; now we just add water,

223
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
or a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something.

224
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
We don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat.

225
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
We just read the back of a label on a packet.

226
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And we don't value food. We don't trust it.

227
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
So instead of trusting it, we fear it.

228
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And instead of valuing it, we throw it away.

229
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
One of the great ironies of modern food systems

230
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
is that they've made the very thing they promised

231
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
to make easier much harder.

232
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
By making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place,

233
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
they've actually distanced us from our most important relationship,

234
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
which is that of us and nature.

235
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And also they've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver,

236
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
that, as we've seen, are unsustainable.

237
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
So what are we going to do about that?

238
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
It's not a new question.

239
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
500 years ago it's what Thomas More was asking himself.

240
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
This is the frontispiece of his book "Utopia."

241
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And it was a series of semi-independent city-states,

242
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
if that sounds remotely familiar,

243
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
a day's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming-mad,

244
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and grew vegetables in their back gardens,

245
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and ate communal meals together, and so on.

246
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And I think you could argue that

247
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
food is a fundamental ordering principle of Utopia,

248
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
even though More never framed it that way.

249
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And here is another very famous "Utopian" vision,

250
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
that of Ebenezer Howard, "The Garden City."

251
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Same idea: series of semi-independent city-states,

252
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
little blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around,

253
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
joined to one another by railway.

254
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And again, food could be said to be

255
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
the ordering principle of his vision.

256
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
It even got built, but nothing to do with

257
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
this vision that Howard had.

258
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And that is the problem with these Utopian ideas,

259
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
that they are Utopian.

260
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Utopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately.

261
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
It was a kind of joke, because it's got a double derivation from the Greek.

262
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
It can either mean a good place, or no place.

263
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Because it's an ideal. It's an imaginary thing. We can't have it.

264
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And I think, as a conceptual tool

265
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling,

266
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
that makes it not much use.

267
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
So I've come up with an alternative,

268
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
which is Sitopia, from the ancient Greek,

269
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
"sitos" for food, and "topos" for place.

270
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
I believe we already live in Sitopia.

271
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
We live in a world shaped by food,

272
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and if we realize that, we can use food as a really powerful tool --

273
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
a conceptual tool, design tool, to shape the world differently.

274
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
So if we were to do that, what might Sitopia look like?

275
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Well I think it looks a bit like this.

276
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
I have to use this slide. It's just the look on the face of the dog.

277
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
But anyway, this is -- (Laughter)

278
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
it's food at the center of life,

279
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
at the center of family life, being celebrated,

280
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
being enjoyed, people taking time for it.

281
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
This is where food should be in our society.

282
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
But you can't have scenes like this unless you have people like this.

283
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
By the way, these can be men as well.

284
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
It's people who think about food,

285
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
who think ahead, who plan,

286
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables

287
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and actually recognize them.

288
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
We need these people. We're part of a network.

289
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Because without these kinds of people we can't have places like this.

290
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Here, I deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable.

291
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
But networks, markets where food is being grown locally.

292
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
It's common. It's fresh.

293
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
It's part of the social life of the city.

294
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Because without that, you can't have this kind of place,

295
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape,

296
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and is not just a zero-sum commodity

297
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
off in some unseen hell-hole.

298
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Cows with a view.

299
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Steaming piles of humus.

300
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
This is basically bringing the whole thing together.

301
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And this is a community project

302
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
I visited recently in Toronto.

303
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
It's a greenhouse, where kids get told

304
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
all about food and growing their own food.

305
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Here is a plant called Kevin, or maybe it's a

306
0:13:51.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
plant belonging to a kid called Kevin. I don't know.

307
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
But anyway, these kinds of projects

308
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
that are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important.

309
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
So Sitopia, for me, is really a way of seeing.

310
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
It's basically recognizing that Sitopia

311
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
already exists in little pockets everywhere.

312
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
The trick is to join them up,

313
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
to use food as a way of seeing.

314
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
And if we do that, we're going to stop seeing cities

315
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
as big, metropolitan, unproductive blobs, like this.

316
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
We're going to see them more like this,

317
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
as part of the productive, organic framework

318
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
of which they are inevitably a part,

319
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
symbiotically connected.

320
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
But of course, that's not a great image either,

321
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
because we need not to be producing food like this anymore.

322
0:14:33.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
We need to be thinking more about permaculture,

323
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
which is why I think this image just

324
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing.

325
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
It's a re-conceptualization

326
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
of the way food shapes our lives.

327
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
The best image I know of this is from 650 years ago.

328
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:5,000
It's Ambrogio Lorenzetti's "Allegory of Good Government."

329
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
It's about the relationship between the city and the countryside.

330
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
And I think the message of this is very clear.

331
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
If the city looks after the country,

332
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
the country will look after the city.

333
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
And I want us to ask now,

334
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
what would Ambrogio Lorenzetti paint

335
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
if he painted this image today?

336
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
What would an allegory of good government look like today?

337
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Because I think it's an urgent question.

338
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
It's one we have to ask,

339
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
and we have to start answering.

340
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
We know we are what we eat.

341
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
We need to realize that the world is also what we eat.

342
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
But if we take that idea, we can use food

343
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
as a really powerful tool to shape the world better.

344
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Thank you very much.

345
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
(Applause)

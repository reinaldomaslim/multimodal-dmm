1
0:00:13.042,000 --> 0:00:15,000
On this planet today,

2
0:00:15.583,000 --> 0:00:2,000
there are about 50 cities that are larger than five million people.

3
0:00:21.375,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I'm going to share with you the story of one such city,

4
0:00:24.083,000 --> 0:00:26,000
a city of seven million people,

5
0:00:26.5,000 --> 0:00:31,000
but a city that's a temporary megacity, an ephemeral megacity.

6
0:00:31.583,000 --> 0:00:36,000
This is a city that is built for a Hindu religious festival

7
0:00:36.667,000 --> 0:00:37,000
called Kumbh Mela,

8
0:00:38.417,000 --> 0:00:42,000
which occurs every 12 years, in smaller editions every four years,

9
0:00:42.875,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and takes place at the confluence

10
0:00:45.667,000 --> 0:00:48,000
of the Ganges and the Yamuna rivers in India.

11
0:00:49.625,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And for this festival,

12
0:00:52.042,000 --> 0:00:57,000
about 100 million people congregate.

13
0:00:57.083,000 --> 0:00:59,000
The reason so many people congregate here,

14
0:00:59.25,000 --> 0:01:03,000
is the Hindus believe that during the festival,

15
0:01:03.333,000 --> 0:01:04,000
the cycle every 12 years,

16
0:01:04.833,000 --> 0:01:08,000
if you bathe at the confluence of these two great rivers

17
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:11,000
you are freed from rebirth.

18
0:01:11.292,000 --> 0:01:12,000
It's a really compelling idea,

19
0:01:12.958,000 --> 0:01:14,000
you are liberated from life as we know it.

20
0:01:15.583,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And this is what attracts these millions.

21
0:01:19.375,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And an entire megacity is built to house them.

22
0:01:23.042,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Seven million people live there for the 55 days,

23
0:01:26.083,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and the other 100 million visit.

24
0:01:29.375,000 --> 0:01:31,000
These are images from the same spot

25
0:01:31.5,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that we took over the 10 weeks

26
0:01:34.042,000 --> 0:01:37,000
that it takes for the city to emerge.

27
0:01:37.125,000 --> 0:01:38,000
After the monsoon,

28
0:01:38.833,000 --> 0:01:41,000
as the waters of these rivers begin to recede

29
0:01:42.167,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and the sand banks expose themselves,

30
0:01:44.833,000 --> 0:01:47,000
it becomes the terrain for the city.

31
0:01:47.917,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And by the 15th of January,

32
0:01:49.583,000 --> 0:01:51,000
starting 15th of October to 15th of January,

33
0:01:52.458,000 --> 0:01:55,000
in these weeks an entire city emerges.

34
0:01:55.833,000 --> 0:01:58,000
A city that houses seven million people.

35
0:02:00.208,000 --> 0:02:03,000
What is fascinating is this city

36
0:02:03.667,000 --> 0:02:07,000
actually has all the characteristics of a real megacity:

37
0:02:08.25,000 --> 0:02:1,000
a grid is employed to lay the city out.

38
0:02:10.917,000 --> 0:02:12,000
The urban system is a grid

39
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and every street on this city

40
0:02:16.042,000 --> 0:02:19,000
goes across the river on a pontoon bridge.

41
0:02:19.125,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Incredibly resilient,

42
0:02:20.667,000 --> 0:02:25,000
because if there's an unseasonal downpour or if the river changes course,

43
0:02:25.75,000 --> 0:02:26,000
the urban system stays intact,

44
0:02:27.583,000 --> 0:02:31,000
the city adjusts itself to this terrain which can be volatile.

45
0:02:33.792,000 --> 0:02:38,000
It also replicates all forms of physical, as well as social, infrastructure.

46
0:02:39.792,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Water supply, sewage, electricity,

47
0:02:42.708,000 --> 0:02:47,000
there are 1,400 CCTV cameras that are used for security

48
0:02:48.125,000 --> 0:02:51,000
by an entire station that is set up.

49
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:54,000
But also social infrastructure,

50
0:02:54.458,000 --> 0:02:56,000
like clinics, hospitals,

51
0:02:57.167,000 --> 0:02:59,000
all sorts of community services,

52
0:02:59.417,000 --> 0:03:03,000
that make this function like any real megacity would do.

53
0:03:03.917,000 --> 0:03:09,000
10,500 sweepers are employed by the city.

54
0:03:10.042,000 --> 0:03:12,000
It has a governance system, a Mela Adhikari,

55
0:03:12.417,000 --> 0:03:14,000
or the commissioner of the festival,

56
0:03:14.542,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that ensures that land is allocated,

57
0:03:16.958,000 --> 0:03:17,000
there are systems for all of this,

58
0:03:18.625,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that the system of the city, the mobility, all works efficiently.

59
0:03:23.833,000 --> 0:03:28,000
You know, it was the cleanest and the most efficient Indian city

60
0:03:28.958,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I've lived in.

61
0:03:30.25,000 --> 0:03:32,000
(Laughter)

62
0:03:33.583,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And that's what it looks like in comparison to Manhattan,

63
0:03:36.458,000 --> 0:03:38,000
30 square kilometers,

64
0:03:38.5,000 --> 0:03:4,000
that's the scale of the city.

65
0:03:41.458,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And this is not an informal city or a pop-up city.

66
0:03:45.458,000 --> 0:03:48,000
This is a formal city, this is a state enterprise,

67
0:03:48.833,000 --> 0:03:5,000
the government sets this up.

68
0:03:51.375,000 --> 0:03:54,000
In today's world of neoliberalism and capitalism,

69
0:03:54.917,000 --> 0:03:57,000
where the state has devolved itself complete responsibility

70
0:03:58.917,000 --> 0:04:,000
from making and designing cities,

71
0:04:01.708,000 --> 0:04:02,000
this is an incredible case.

72
0:04:03.042,000 --> 0:04:06,000
It's a deliberate, intentional city, a formal city.

73
0:04:07.708,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And it's a city that sits on the ground very lightly.

74
0:04:11.792,000 --> 0:04:13,000
It sits on the banks of these rivers.

75
0:04:14.667,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And it leaves very little mark.

76
0:04:17.667,000 --> 0:04:18,000
There are no foundations;

77
0:04:19.458,000 --> 0:04:22,000
fabric is used to build this entire city.

78
0:04:23.458,000 --> 0:04:26,000
What's also quite incredible

79
0:04:26.833,000 --> 0:04:3,000
is that there are five materials that are used to build this settlement

80
0:04:31.458,000 --> 0:04:32,000
for seven million people:

81
0:04:33.416,000 --> 0:04:36,000
eight-foot tall bamboo, string or rope,

82
0:04:36.542,000 --> 0:04:38,000
nails or screw and a skinning material.

83
0:04:39.167,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Could be corrugated metal, a fabric or plastic.

84
0:04:42.917,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And these materials come together and aggregate.

85
0:04:46.583,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It's like a kit of parts.

86
0:04:48.375,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And it's used all the way from a small tent,

87
0:04:51.958,000 --> 0:04:54,000
which might house five or six people, or a family,

88
0:04:55,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to temples that can house 500, sometimes 1,000 people.

89
0:04:58.875,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And this kit of parts, and this imagination of the city,

90
0:05:02.667,000 --> 0:05:05,000
allows it to be disassembled.

91
0:05:05.833,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And so at the end of the festival, within a week,

92
0:05:08.458,000 --> 0:05:1,000
the entire city is disassembled.

93
0:05:10.625,000 --> 0:05:12,000
These are again images from the same spot.

94
0:05:13.208,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And the terrain is offered back to the river,

95
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
as with the monsoon the water swells again.

96
0:05:19.083,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And it's this sort of imagination as a kit of parts

97
0:05:21.625,000 --> 0:05:22,000
that allows this disassembly

98
0:05:23.375,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and the reabsorption of all this material.

99
0:05:25.875,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So the electricity poles go to little villages in the hinterland,

100
0:05:29.833,000 --> 0:05:31,000
the pontoon bridges are used in small towns,

101
0:05:32.292,000 --> 0:05:34,000
the material is all reabsorbed.

102
0:05:34.667,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Fascinating, it's amazing.

103
0:05:37.875,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Now, you may embrace these Hindu beliefs or not.

104
0:05:41.75,000 --> 0:05:43,000
But you know, this is a stunning example,

105
0:05:44.375,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and it's worthy of reflection.

106
0:05:46.625,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Here, human beings spend an enormous amount of energy and imagination

107
0:05:52.708,000 --> 0:05:54,000
knowing that the city is going to reverse,

108
0:05:54.958,000 --> 0:05:55,000
it's going to be disassembled,

109
0:05:56.625,000 --> 0:05:58,000
it's going to disappear,

110
0:05:58.833,000 --> 0:06:,000
it's the ephemeral megacity.

111
0:06:02.375,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And it has profound lessons to teach us.

112
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Lessons about how to touch the ground lightly,

113
0:06:07.875,000 --> 0:06:09,000
about reversibility,

114
0:06:10.375,000 --> 0:06:11,000
about disassembly.

115
0:06:12.958,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Rather amazing.

116
0:06:16.042,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And you know, we are, as humans, obsessed with permanence.

117
0:06:19.958,000 --> 0:06:21,000
We resist change.

118
0:06:23.042,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It's an impulse that we all have.

119
0:06:25.417,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And we resist change in spite of the fact

120
0:06:28.292,000 --> 0:06:31,000
that change is perhaps the only constant in our lives.

121
0:06:31.875,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Everything has an expiry date,

122
0:06:34.167,000 --> 0:06:37,000
including Spaceship Earth, our planet.

123
0:06:38.5,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So what can we learn from these sorts of settlements?

124
0:06:42.333,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Burning Man, of course much smaller,

125
0:06:44.708,000 --> 0:06:46,000
but reversible.

126
0:06:46.792,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Or the thousands of markets for transaction,

127
0:06:49.792,000 --> 0:06:51,000
that appear around the globe

128
0:06:52.208,000 --> 0:06:55,000
in Asia, Latin America, Africa, this one in Mexico,

129
0:06:55.667,000 --> 0:06:59,000
where the parking lots are animated on the weekends, about 50,000 vendors,

130
0:07:00.292,000 --> 0:07:01,000
but on a temporal cycle.

131
0:07:02.792,000 --> 0:07:04,000
The farmer's market in the Americas:

132
0:07:05.458,000 --> 0:07:09,000
it's an amazing phenomenon, creates new chemistries,

133
0:07:09.5,000 --> 0:07:11,000
extends the margin of space

134
0:07:11.708,000 --> 0:07:14,000
that is unused or not used optimally, like parking lots, for example.

135
0:07:17.292,000 --> 0:07:18,000
In my own city of Mumbai,

136
0:07:18.792,000 --> 0:07:21,000
where I practice as an architect and a planner,

137
0:07:21.917,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I see this in the everyday landscape.

138
0:07:24.542,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I call this the Kinetic City.

139
0:07:26.5,000 --> 0:07:29,000
It twitches like a live organism; it's not static.

140
0:07:29.75,000 --> 0:07:3,000
It changes every day,

141
0:07:31.583,000 --> 0:07:33,000
on sometimes predictable cycles.

142
0:07:34.208,000 --> 0:07:35,000
About six million people

143
0:07:35.875,000 --> 0:07:38,000
live in these kinds of temporary settlements.

144
0:07:39.375,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Like -- unfortunately, like refugee camps,

145
0:07:42.542,000 --> 0:07:45,000
the slums of Mumbai, the favelas of Latin America.

146
0:07:46.083,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Here, the temporary is becoming the new permanent.

147
0:07:49.833,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Here, urbanism is not about grand vision,

148
0:07:54.167,000 --> 0:07:56,000
it's about grand adjustment.

149
0:07:57.625,000 --> 0:08:01,000
On the street in Mumbai, during the Ganesh festival,

150
0:08:02.083,000 --> 0:08:03,000
a transformation.

151
0:08:03.625,000 --> 0:08:06,000
A community hall is created for 10 days.

152
0:08:06.75,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Bollywood films are shown,

153
0:08:08.75,000 --> 0:08:11,000
thousands congregate for dinners and celebration.

154
0:08:12.083,000 --> 0:08:15,000
It's made out of paper-mache and plaster of Paris.

155
0:08:15.167,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Designed to be disassembled,

156
0:08:17.167,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and in 10 days, overnight, it disappears,

157
0:08:20.208,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and the street goes back to anonymity.

158
0:08:22.958,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Or our wonderful open spaces, we call them maidans.

159
0:08:26.667,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And it's used for this incredibly nuanced and complicated,

160
0:08:31.292,000 --> 0:08:33,000
fascinating Indian game, called cricket,

161
0:08:34.208,000 --> 0:08:35,000
which, I believe, the British invented.

162
0:08:36.125,000 --> 0:08:37,000
(Laughter)

163
0:08:37.292,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And in the evenings,

164
0:08:40.083,000 --> 0:08:42,000
a wedding wraps around the cricket pitch --

165
0:08:42.125,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Notice, the cricket pitch is not touched, it's sacred ground.

166
0:08:45.006,000 --> 0:08:46,000
(Laughter)

167
0:08:46.375,000 --> 0:08:49,000
But here, the club members and the wedding party

168
0:08:49.917,000 --> 0:08:51,000
partake in tea through a common kitchen.

169
0:08:52.582,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And at midnight, it's disassembled,

170
0:08:55.542,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and the space offered back to the city.

171
0:08:58.583,000 --> 0:09:,000
Here, urbanism is an elastic condition.

172
0:09:02.583,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And so, if we reflect about these questions,

173
0:09:05.875,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I mean, I think many come to mind.

174
0:09:08.417,000 --> 0:09:1,000
But an important one is,

175
0:09:10.917,000 --> 0:09:11,000
are we really, in our cities,

176
0:09:12.667,000 --> 0:09:14,000
in our imagination about urbanism,

177
0:09:15.417,000 --> 0:09:19,000
making permanent solutions for temporary problems?

178
0:09:19.958,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Are we locking resources into paradigms

179
0:09:22.958,000 --> 0:09:25,000
that we don't even know will be relevant in a decade?

180
0:09:26.458,000 --> 0:09:27,000
This becomes, I think,

181
0:09:27.75,000 --> 0:09:3,000
an interesting question that arises from this research.

182
0:09:31.375,000 --> 0:09:34,000
I mean, look at the abandoned shopping malls in North America,

183
0:09:34.583,000 --> 0:09:35,000
suburban North America.

184
0:09:36.042,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Retail experts have predicted that in the next decade,

185
0:09:40.167,000 --> 0:09:42,000
of the 2,000 malls that exist today,

186
0:09:43.042,000 --> 0:09:45,000
50 percent will be abandoned.

187
0:09:45.333,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Massive amount of material, capturing resources,

188
0:09:50.125,000 --> 0:09:52,000
that will not be relevant soon.

189
0:09:53.292,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Or the Olympic stadiums.

190
0:09:55.167,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Around the globe, cities build these

191
0:09:57.833,000 --> 0:10:,000
under great contestation with massive resources,

192
0:10:01.042,000 --> 0:10:02,000
but after the games go,

193
0:10:03.042,000 --> 0:10:05,000
they can't often get absorbed into the city.

194
0:10:05.5,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Couldn't these be nomadic structures, deflatable,

195
0:10:08.958,000 --> 0:10:09,000
we have the technology for that,

196
0:10:10.792,000 --> 0:10:14,000
that get gifted to smaller towns around the world or in those countries,

197
0:10:15.167,000 --> 0:10:19,000
or are stored and moved for the next Olympics?

198
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:23,000
A massive, inefficient use of resources.

199
0:10:24.667,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Like the circus.

200
0:10:26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I mean, we could imagine it like the circus,

201
0:10:28.125,000 --> 0:10:3,000
this wonderful institution that used to camp in cities,

202
0:10:31,000 --> 0:10:35,000
set up this lovely kind of visual dialogue with the static city.

203
0:10:35.917,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And within it, the amazement.

204
0:10:38.625,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Children of different ethnic groups become suddenly aware of each other,

205
0:10:43.583,000 --> 0:10:45,000
people of color become aware of others,

206
0:10:45.75,000 --> 0:10:48,000
income groups and cultures and ethnicities

207
0:10:48.917,000 --> 0:10:53,000
all come together around the amazement of the ring with animals and performers.

208
0:10:54.417,000 --> 0:10:57,000
New chemistries are created, people become aware of things,

209
0:10:57.708,000 --> 0:11:,000
and this moves on to the next town.

210
0:11:00.792,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Or nature, the fluxes of nature, climate change,

211
0:11:04.375,000 --> 0:11:07,000
how do we deal with this, can we be more accommodating?

212
0:11:07.958,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Can we create softer urban systems?

213
0:11:10.625,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Or are we going to challenge nature continuously

214
0:11:13.25,000 --> 0:11:14,000
with heavy infrastructure,

215
0:11:14.875,000 --> 0:11:16,000
which we are already doing, unsuccessfully?

216
0:11:18.625,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Now, I'm not arguing

217
0:11:20.125,000 --> 0:11:22,000
that we've got to make our cities like a circus,

218
0:11:22.583,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I'm not arguing that cities must be completely temporary.

219
0:11:26.042,000 --> 0:11:27,000
I'm only making a plea

220
0:11:27.667,000 --> 0:11:3,000
that we need to make a shift in our imagination about cities,

221
0:11:30.708,000 --> 0:11:33,000
where we need to reserve more space

222
0:11:33.75,000 --> 0:11:35,000
for uses on a temporal scale.

223
0:11:36.708,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Where we need to use our resources efficiently,

224
0:11:39.833,000 --> 0:11:41,000
to extend the expiry date of our planet.

225
0:11:42.667,000 --> 0:11:45,000
We need to change planning urban design cultures,

226
0:11:45.792,000 --> 0:11:47,000
to think of the temporal, the reversible,

227
0:11:48.625,000 --> 0:11:49,000
the disassembleable.

228
0:11:50.458,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And that can be tremendous

229
0:11:52.625,000 --> 0:11:55,000
in terms of the effect it might have on our lives.

230
0:11:56.917,000 --> 0:11:58,000
I often think back to the Kumbh Mela

231
0:11:59.875,000 --> 0:12:01,000
that I visited with my students and I studied,

232
0:12:02.042,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and this was a moment where the city had been disassembled.

233
0:12:06.25,000 --> 0:12:07,000
A week after the festival was over.

234
0:12:08.125,000 --> 0:12:09,000
There was no mark.

235
0:12:09.417,000 --> 0:12:13,000
The terrain was waiting to be covered over by the water,

236
0:12:13.5,000 --> 0:12:14,000
to be consumed.

237
0:12:14.792,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And I went to thank a high priestess

238
0:12:17.583,000 --> 0:12:2,000
who had helped us and my students through our research

239
0:12:21.25,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and facilitated us through this process.

240
0:12:24.875,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And I went to her with great enthusiasm,

241
0:12:27.167,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and I told her about how much we had learned

242
0:12:29.292,000 --> 0:12:32,000
about infrastructure, the city, the efficiency of the city,

243
0:12:32.917,000 --> 0:12:35,000
the architecture, the five materials that made the city.

244
0:12:36.042,000 --> 0:12:38,000
She looked really amused, she was smiling.

245
0:12:38.708,000 --> 0:12:4,000
In any case, she leaned forward

246
0:12:41.542,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and put her hand on my head to bless me.

247
0:12:44.917,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And she whispered in my ear, she said,

248
0:12:48.542,000 --> 0:12:51,000
"Feel blessed that the Mother Ganges

249
0:12:51.625,000 --> 0:12:55,000
allowed you all to sit in her lap for a few days."

250
0:12:57.375,000 --> 0:12:59,000
I've often thought about this,

251
0:12:59.708,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and of course, I understood what she said.

252
0:13:02.625,000 --> 0:13:05,000
She said, cities, people, architecture will come and go,

253
0:13:06.5,000 --> 0:13:08,000
but the planet is here to stay.

254
0:13:09.625,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Touch it lightly, leave a minimal mark.

255
0:13:13.625,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And I think that's an important lesson for us as citizens and architects.

256
0:13:18.083,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And I think it was this experience

257
0:13:20.708,000 --> 0:13:26,000
that made me believe that impermanence is bigger than permanence

258
0:13:27.083,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and bigger than us all.

259
0:13:28.375,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Thank you for listening.

260
0:13:29.917,000 --> 0:13:35,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:11.96,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Hey look if you guys are anything like

2
0:00:14.88,000 --> 0:00:18,000
me you have found it harder and harder

3
0:00:16.83,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to turn around recently without seeing

4
0:00:19.439,000 --> 0:00:24,000
words like free-range farm-to-table

5
0:00:22.279,000 --> 0:00:27,000
organically produced especially here in

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Colorado now is we've become more

7
0:00:27.93,000 --> 0:00:31,000
conscientious of the way that we eat in

8
0:00:29.82,000 --> 0:00:33,000
recent years these once unfamiliar words

9
0:00:32.82,000 --> 0:00:36,000
have worked their way into our daily

10
0:00:34.739,000 --> 0:00:38,000
lexicon when we started to pay more

11
0:00:37.77,000 --> 0:00:41,000
attention to the way that the food we

12
0:00:39.54,000 --> 0:00:44,000
were eating interacted with our bodies

13
0:00:41.85,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and with the earth the food industry had

14
0:00:44.85,000 --> 0:00:5,000
to listen and the results have been

15
0:00:47.37,000 --> 0:00:53,000
really powerful now those of you out

16
0:00:51.48,000 --> 0:00:55,000
there from states like Washington and

17
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Oregon and of course my fellow

18
0:00:55.71,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Coloradans y'all know what I'm talking

19
0:00:59.73,000 --> 0:01:09,000
about because this is not words like all

20
0:01:06.18,000 --> 0:01:12,000
natural and homegrown are not just being

21
0:01:10.17,000 --> 0:01:17,000
used in our diets there's this whole new

22
0:01:12.299,000 --> 0:01:2,000
industry using this language now you

23
0:01:17.22,000 --> 0:01:23,000
guys know it's weed an industry the

24
0:01:21.119,000 --> 0:01:26,000
taxes sale of about six billion dollars

25
0:01:23.549,000 --> 0:01:28,000
worth of product in 2016 so what if I

26
0:01:27.06,000 --> 0:01:3,000
would have proposed to you that some of

27
0:01:29.4,000 --> 0:01:33,000
what you think you know about this

28
0:01:30.689,000 --> 0:01:35,000
legalized marijuana thing could be wrong

29
0:01:34.189,000 --> 0:01:38,000
listen I get it

30
0:01:36.259,000 --> 0:01:4,000
talking about issues with legal weed is

31
0:01:38.729,000 --> 0:01:42,000
a pretty quick way to get uninvited from

32
0:01:40.35,000 --> 0:01:45,000
the cool kids table I I I know that

33
0:01:42.899,000 --> 0:01:49,000
better than most but I intend to do it

34
0:01:46.229,000 --> 0:01:52,000
anyway first before I get started let me

35
0:01:50.07,000 --> 0:01:55,000
be perfectly clear about one thing my

36
0:01:52.89,000 --> 0:01:57,000
fight is not against the casual adult

37
0:01:55.29,000 --> 0:02:,000
use of marijuana I don't care about that

38
0:01:58.34,000 --> 0:02:02,000
what I care deeply about is this new

39
0:02:00.93,000 --> 0:02:03,000
industry that is working to convince us

40
0:02:03.09,000 --> 0:02:08,000
that we are consuming something natural

41
0:02:04.92,000 --> 0:02:09,000
while fixing social ills when we aren't

42
0:02:08.72,000 --> 0:02:12,000
so let's start with a little bit of weed

43
0:02:10.709,000 --> 0:02:13,000
101 cannabis is a plant that grows

44
0:02:13.23,000 --> 0:02:15,000
naturally

45
0:02:13.87,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and has been used within textiles and

46
0:02:15.91,000 --> 0:02:2,000
even traditional Chinese medicine for

47
0:02:17.68,000 --> 0:02:22,000
thousands of years Genesis 1:12 even

48
0:02:21.88,000 --> 0:02:24,000
tells us that I have given to you all of

49
0:02:23.65,000 --> 0:02:27,000
the seed bearing plants and herbs to use

50
0:02:25.66,000 --> 0:02:3,000
as such that is the microphone it's got

51
0:02:28.18,000 --> 0:02:31,000
a TV preacher sort of thing

52
0:02:32.37,000 --> 0:02:36,000
now cannabis is made up of hundreds of

53
0:02:35.38,000 --> 0:02:38,000
different chemicals but what two of

54
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:44,000
those chemicals are by far the most

55
0:02:38.95,000 --> 0:02:44,000
interesting that CBD and THC so CBD is

56
0:02:44.11,000 --> 0:02:47,000
where almost all of the medicinal

57
0:02:45.85,000 --> 0:02:48,000
properties lie

58
0:02:47.11,000 --> 0:02:51,000
it's an incredibly fascinating part of

59
0:02:49.6,000 --> 0:02:55,000
the plant with real potential to help

60
0:02:52.03,000 --> 0:02:58,000
people it also is totally non

61
0:02:55.69,000 --> 0:03:,000
intoxicating you could take a bath in

62
0:02:58.51,000 --> 0:03:03,000
the stuff while vaping pure CBD and

63
0:03:00.97,000 --> 0:03:1,000
drinking a CBD smoothie and you still

64
0:03:03.7,000 --> 0:03:16,000
couldn't get high I've tried I haven't I

65
0:03:11.23,000 --> 0:03:18,000
haven't that cost a lot of money not now

66
0:03:17.08,000 --> 0:03:21,000
fur is interesting and remarkable a part

67
0:03:19.03,000 --> 0:03:22,000
of the plan is CBD is it actually makes

68
0:03:21.28,000 --> 0:03:24,000
up a really tiny portion of the

69
0:03:22.63,000 --> 0:03:26,000
commercial market the real money is

70
0:03:25.06,000 --> 0:03:29,000
being made in that other chemical in THC

71
0:03:27.359,000 --> 0:03:32,000
so THC is the natural part of the plant

72
0:03:29.859,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that gets you high and before the 1970s

73
0:03:32.709,000 --> 0:03:36,000
cannabis contained less than half of a

74
0:03:34.84,000 --> 0:03:39,000
percent of THC that's was naturally

75
0:03:37.63,000 --> 0:03:43,000
occurring over the last 40 years as we

76
0:03:40.78,000 --> 0:03:46,000
became better gardeners that that

77
0:03:44.319,000 --> 0:03:51,000
percentage of THC started to slowly but

78
0:03:47.56,000 --> 0:03:53,000
steadily rise until recently when the

79
0:03:51.34,000 --> 0:03:56,000
chemists started to get involved so

80
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
these guys moved grow cycles I'm sorry

81
0:03:56.92,000 --> 0:04:01,000
these guys move cultivation exclusively

82
0:03:59.47,000 --> 0:04:04,000
indoors and they may grow cycles

83
0:04:02.019,000 --> 0:04:07,000
extremely and unnaturally short they

84
0:04:05.2,000 --> 0:04:08,000
also started to use pesticides and

85
0:04:07.06,000 --> 0:04:11,000
fertilizers in some ways that we should

86
0:04:08.829,000 --> 0:04:12,000
be concerned with in fact I was recently

87
0:04:11.17,000 --> 0:04:15,000
talking to a buddy who had just left a

88
0:04:13.42,000 --> 0:04:16,000
job at a commercial grow operation

89
0:04:15.19,000 --> 0:04:18,000
because he was so concerned with the

90
0:04:16.87,000 --> 0:04:19,000
chemicals that he was being asked to

91
0:04:18.459,000 --> 0:04:21,000
interact with some of his fellow

92
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
employees were actually encouraged to

93
0:04:22.39,000 --> 0:04:25,000
wear hazmat suits while they were

94
0:04:24.76,000 --> 0:04:27,000
spraying their chemical cocktails on the

95
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
plants

96
0:04:27.76,000 --> 0:04:31,000
with that kind of manipulation the

97
0:04:31.04,000 --> 0:04:36,000
products that are being sold today can

98
0:04:32.66,000 --> 0:04:38,000
contain above 30% THC and our

99
0:04:36.74,000 --> 0:04:43,000
concentrates our concentrates can

100
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
actually contain above 95% THC a far cry

101
0:04:44.21,000 --> 0:04:51,000
from the natural plant listen this isn't

102
0:04:48.68,000 --> 0:04:54,000
your Grandpa's weed

103
0:04:51.94,000 --> 0:04:57,000
this isn't your dad's weed like like

104
0:04:55.64,000 --> 0:05:01,000
this isn't even my weed

105
0:04:58.63,000 --> 0:05:02,000
if you've ever set foot inside one of

106
0:05:01.91,000 --> 0:05:04,000
the thousands of dispensaries that have

107
0:05:03.41,000 --> 0:05:08,000
sprung up in recent years you know that

108
0:05:05.63,000 --> 0:05:1,000
what we're really selling in them is THC

109
0:05:09.19,000 --> 0:05:13,000
all of the weed that you buy

110
0:05:11.12,000 --> 0:05:15,000
commercially lists exactly how much THC

111
0:05:13.37,000 --> 0:05:19,000
it contains as do our other much more

112
0:05:15.98,000 --> 0:05:23,000
popular products like vape pens coffee

113
0:05:19.79,000 --> 0:05:29,000
ice cream condiments granola gum candy

114
0:05:24.56,000 --> 0:05:36,000
baked goods suppositories and of course

115
0:05:29.99,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Lube pretty much no for real pretty much

116
0:05:37.49,000 --> 0:05:41,000
anything that you can imagine

117
0:05:38.81,000 --> 0:05:43,000
introducing into the human body the vast

118
0:05:42.44,000 --> 0:05:48,000
majority of cannabis that's being sold

119
0:05:44.21,000 --> 0:05:52,000
today it isn't really cannabis its THC

120
0:05:48.8,000 --> 0:05:54,000
in either a pure form or in an extremely

121
0:05:52.22,000 --> 0:05:57,000
high in unnatural concentration to say

122
0:05:55.1,000 --> 0:06:,000
that we have legalized weed is subtly

123
0:05:57.53,000 --> 0:06:05,000
misleading we have commercialized THC

124
0:06:01.07,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and it's happened really quickly now the

125
0:06:05.87,000 --> 0:06:08,000
reason why the commercial market is so

126
0:06:07.4,000 --> 0:06:1,000
rapidly exploded is because there is a

127
0:06:09.29,000 --> 0:06:13,000
hell of a lot of money to be made in

128
0:06:11.27,000 --> 0:06:17,000
satisfying and increasing our desire to

129
0:06:14.21,000 --> 0:06:18,000
get high and that money is no longer

130
0:06:17.27,000 --> 0:06:22,000
really being made by the mom-and-pop

131
0:06:18.77,000 --> 0:06:23,000
shops so industry groups and

132
0:06:22.34,000 --> 0:06:25,000
corporations groups like the drug policy

133
0:06:24.14,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Alliance the Marijuana Policy Project

134
0:06:25.93,000 --> 0:06:3,000
ArcView investment the cannabis Industry

135
0:06:28.79,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Association they've chased out and

136
0:06:31.46,000 --> 0:06:35,000
helped to chase out a lot of the

137
0:06:32.93,000 --> 0:06:37,000
small-time growers so these cats know

138
0:06:36.11,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that the best way to get us to continue

139
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:43,000
to or to continue to profit off of us

140
0:06:41.24,000 --> 0:06:45,000
if they follow the alcohol industry's

141
0:06:43.039,000 --> 0:06:47,000
8020 rule as simple as where 80% of the

142
0:06:45.889,000 --> 0:06:51,000
product is consumed by 20% of the

143
0:06:47.6,000 --> 0:06:56,000
consumers the problem users the wealthy

144
0:06:52.419,000 --> 0:07:01,000
white weed lobbyists and seriously they

145
0:06:57.05,000 --> 0:07:03,000
are almost all rich white men they know

146
0:07:01.97,000 --> 0:07:06,000
that we will consume more what they're

147
0:07:03.44,000 --> 0:07:09,000
selling if they jack up the potency they

148
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
also know that we are more than twice as

149
0:07:09.8,000 --> 0:07:12,000
likely to consume THC regularly if we

150
0:07:12.05,000 --> 0:07:16,000
earn under twenty thousand dollars a

151
0:07:13.789,000 --> 0:07:18,000
year then those who are in over fifty

152
0:07:16.34,000 --> 0:07:21,000
thousand dollars a year in other words

153
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
the poorer you are the more likely you

154
0:07:22.22,000 --> 0:07:28,000
are to spend your money on their

155
0:07:24.59,000 --> 0:07:32,000
products and in this country income and

156
0:07:28.759,000 --> 0:07:34,000
race are highly correlated one of the

157
0:07:33.53,000 --> 0:07:36,000
reasons that we often hear cited for the

158
0:07:35.18,000 --> 0:07:38,000
legalization of marijuana is that it

159
0:07:37.25,000 --> 0:07:41,000
will help to stop the disproportionate

160
0:07:39.139,000 --> 0:07:43,000
incarceration rates among minorities

161
0:07:41.419,000 --> 0:07:46,000
which is something everybody in this

162
0:07:43.61,000 --> 0:07:48,000
room should be extremely concerned with

163
0:07:46.479,000 --> 0:07:5,000
unfortunately we don't have to look any

164
0:07:48.949,000 --> 0:07:51,000
further than arrest rates for juveniles

165
0:07:51.229,000 --> 0:07:54,000
here in Colorado to counter that

166
0:07:52.699,000 --> 0:07:57,000
argument according to the Colorado

167
0:07:54.919,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Department of Public Safety since we

168
0:07:58.31,000 --> 0:08:05,000
opened retail in 2014 almost all of

169
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
which are in poor minority neighborhoods

170
0:08:05.74,000 --> 0:08:12,000
we saw an 8% reduction in the arrests of

171
0:08:09.5,000 --> 0:08:15,000
white kids for all weed related activity

172
0:08:13.15,000 --> 0:08:18,000
good on them

173
0:08:15.669,000 --> 0:08:2,000
during that same time period there's a

174
0:08:18.289,000 --> 0:08:22,000
29 percent increase in the arrests of

175
0:08:20.84,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Hispanic kids for weed related activity

176
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and a 58 percent increase in the arrests

177
0:08:26.84,000 --> 0:08:3,000
of black kids for weed related crimes

178
0:08:29.06,000 --> 0:08:33,000
you guys heard that right we are

179
0:08:31.31,000 --> 0:08:35,000
actually arresting more people of color

180
0:08:33.62,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and Colorado than we were prior to

181
0:08:35.839,000 --> 0:08:42,000
commercialization and you're not reading

182
0:08:38.93,000 --> 0:08:46,000
that in the post Colorado Department of

183
0:08:43.459,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Safety legal marijuana coming into focus

184
0:08:47.56,000 --> 0:08:53,000
another big issue that we have is in

185
0:08:50.51,000 --> 0:08:54,000
school suspension rates so schools that

186
0:08:53.87,000 --> 0:08:56,000
are predominantly white

187
0:08:55.1,000 --> 0:09:,000
that is they have a minority population

188
0:08:56.93,000 --> 0:09:01,000
of 25% or fewer in the first full year

189
0:09:00.259,000 --> 0:09:04,000
of data collection following

190
0:09:02.12,000 --> 0:09:06,000
commercialization these schools had a

191
0:09:04.67,000 --> 0:09:09,000
grand total of a hundred and ninety

192
0:09:06.699,000 --> 0:09:12,000
drug-related suspensions almost all of

193
0:09:09.709,000 --> 0:09:15,000
which are for THC at the same time

194
0:09:13.37,000 --> 0:09:2,000
schools with a minority population of

195
0:09:15.79,000 --> 0:09:23,000
seventy-five to a hundred percent had

196
0:09:20.589,000 --> 0:09:27,000
801 drug-related suspensions almost all

197
0:09:24.62,000 --> 0:09:29,000
of which were for THC when discussing

198
0:09:27.769,000 --> 0:09:31,000
minority populations one that

199
0:09:29.839,000 --> 0:09:35,000
unfortunately often gets left out of the

200
0:09:31.88,000 --> 0:09:37,000
conversation is the LGTBQ community now

201
0:09:36.62,000 --> 0:09:41,000
members of this community are more than

202
0:09:38.69,000 --> 0:09:43,000
twice as likely to consume THC than

203
0:09:41.66,000 --> 0:09:47,000
those who identify as heterosexual or

204
0:09:43.79,000 --> 0:09:49,000
cisgender they also unfortunately have

205
0:09:48.199,000 --> 0:09:53,000
higher rates of mental illness and

206
0:09:50.389,000 --> 0:09:55,000
suicide according to a study published

207
0:09:53.6,000 --> 0:09:58,000
in 2014 called going to pot we see that

208
0:09:55.94,000 --> 0:10:,000
the unnaturally high levels of THC found

209
0:09:58.699,000 --> 0:10:03,000
in today's products they actually

210
0:10:01.069,000 --> 0:10:08,000
compound those issues and make them

211
0:10:03.98,000 --> 0:10:09,000
worse unfortunately that seems to matter

212
0:10:08.42,000 --> 0:10:12,000
very little to the folks who are selling

213
0:10:10.49,000 --> 0:10:16,000
these products because as you just saw

214
0:10:12.579,000 --> 0:10:19,000
clearly this is a good consumer base

215
0:10:17.11,000 --> 0:10:21,000
listen man I get it and in many circles

216
0:10:19.61,000 --> 0:10:24,000
legalized marijuana is too much of a

217
0:10:21.35,000 --> 0:10:27,000
sacred cow to question but we need to

218
0:10:25.22,000 --> 0:10:31,000
start this conversation because what's

219
0:10:27.529,000 --> 0:10:33,000
being sold today is not natural and

220
0:10:31.449,000 --> 0:10:36,000
lobbyists and industry are using social

221
0:10:34.279,000 --> 0:10:42,000
justice as a smokescreen so that they

222
0:10:36.589,000 --> 0:10:43,000
can get richer it's my own journey to

223
0:10:42.439,000 --> 0:10:45,000
sobriety that led me to begin

224
0:10:44.12,000 --> 0:10:46,000
questioning a lot of what I was seeing

225
0:10:45.829,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that's kind of one of the things that

226
0:10:47.089,000 --> 0:10:53,000
were taught to do when I left Boulder

227
0:10:50.66,000 --> 0:10:55,000
for the Washington DC area at 12 years

228
0:10:53.839,000 --> 0:10:56,000
old May I was transported into a world

229
0:10:56.06,000 --> 0:10:59,000
where the kind of shoes that you wore

230
0:10:57.74,000 --> 0:11:02,000
mattered more than just about anything

231
0:10:59.3,000 --> 0:11:06,000
else and my family was just too poor to

232
0:11:03.38,000 --> 0:11:08,000
help me play that game so I was faced

233
0:11:06.709,000 --> 0:11:1,000
with a pretty real crisis of identity

234
0:11:08.99,000 --> 0:11:12,000
in this new scene where there's more

235
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:16,000
blacktop than treetops man I just didn't

236
0:11:13.73,000 --> 0:11:19,000
know who I was so I smoked weed for the

237
0:11:16.01,000 --> 0:11:24,000
first time when I was 13 and I loved it

238
0:11:19.91,000 --> 0:11:26,000
I instantly found this social group and

239
0:11:24.5,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and I also just really liked being high

240
0:11:27.32,000 --> 0:11:35,000
like I finally found a way to shut this

241
0:11:29.96,000 --> 0:11:37,000
up I quickly turned to other drugs and

242
0:11:35.36,000 --> 0:11:4,000
alcohol and something just woke up

243
0:11:38.27,000 --> 0:11:41,000
inside of my brain I was a daily user

244
0:11:40.97,000 --> 0:11:43,000
within a couple of months

245
0:11:42.2,000 --> 0:11:46,000
so my addictive use it mirrors many of

246
0:11:44.72,000 --> 0:11:48,000
the stories that I'm sure you've heard

247
0:11:46.4,000 --> 0:11:52,000
before it started out as fun it got

248
0:11:49.37,000 --> 0:11:56,000
scary and then it was just necessary

249
0:11:52.54,000 --> 0:12:02,000
enough said I got wasted for the last

250
0:11:57.11,000 --> 0:12:02,000
time on June 15th of 1996 an iron

251
0:12:09.199,000 --> 0:12:17,000
thank you and I've spent the last 21

252
0:12:13.949,000 --> 0:12:18,000
years trying to both put my life back in

253
0:12:17.249,000 --> 0:12:23,000
order as well as trying to find some

254
0:12:19.499,000 --> 0:12:24,000
peace in this world and one of the ways

255
0:12:23.579,000 --> 0:12:26,000
that I've done that is by working inside

256
0:12:25.169,000 --> 0:12:29,000
of nonprofit drug and alcohol treatment

257
0:12:27.059,000 --> 0:12:31,000
for the last 10 years with groups like

258
0:12:29.399,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Phoenix multi-sport the University of

259
0:12:31.619,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Colorado Hospital and now gap the

260
0:12:34.949,000 --> 0:12:38,000
National Association for lesbian gay

261
0:12:36.899,000 --> 0:12:42,000
transgender bisexual treatment providers

262
0:12:39.66,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and their allies even after all of my

263
0:12:43.709,000 --> 0:12:49,000
work on the frontlines and is a former

264
0:12:46.379,000 --> 0:12:51,000
consumer myself I was shocked and pissed

265
0:12:50.489,000 --> 0:12:54,000
when I started to see what

266
0:12:51.989,000 --> 0:12:55,000
commercialization was doing to cannabis

267
0:12:54.54,000 --> 0:12:59,000
because you see our hope for something

268
0:12:56.699,000 --> 0:13:,000
pure and natural is making it hard for

269
0:12:59.579,000 --> 0:13:03,000
us to see what's really going on and

270
0:13:01.649,000 --> 0:13:05,000
that is that the rich are getting richer

271
0:13:03.66,000 --> 0:13:14,000
on the backs of the poor and lying to

272
0:13:05.879,000 --> 0:13:18,000
our faces the entire time thank you my

273
0:13:15.149,000 --> 0:13:21,000
friends once again I fear that we are

274
0:13:18.959,000 --> 0:13:24,000
allowing industry to take advantage of

275
0:13:22.079,000 --> 0:13:27,000
the most challenged among us in order to

276
0:13:25.199,000 --> 0:13:31,000
turn a profit much like we saw with

277
0:13:27.269,000 --> 0:13:32,000
tobacco and food in years past so when

278
0:13:31.709,000 --> 0:13:34,000
we told the food industry that we

279
0:13:33.239,000 --> 0:13:38,000
understood the impact our choices were

280
0:13:35.61,000 --> 0:13:4,000
having and that we demanded better for

281
0:13:38.279,000 --> 0:13:44,000
ourselves and our families that industry

282
0:13:41.399,000 --> 0:13:45,000
got in the line so is there any reason

283
0:13:44.639,000 --> 0:13:48,000
why we couldn't demand the same thing

284
0:13:46.199,000 --> 0:13:49,000
from this and from future industries who

285
0:13:49.199,000 --> 0:13:53,000
are trying to get a piece of our

286
0:13:50.189,000 --> 0:13:55,000
paychecks what if we made these guys

287
0:13:53.339,000 --> 0:13:57,000
answer some hard questions

288
0:13:55.279,000 --> 0:14:,000
what if we held them to a higher

289
0:13:57.389,000 --> 0:14:03,000
standard than we are right now because

290
0:14:00.419,000 --> 0:14:06,000
as it stands for many in our community

291
0:14:04.279,000 --> 0:14:08,000
the grass isn't greener on this side of

292
0:14:07.139,000 --> 0:14:11,000
commercialization

293
0:14:08.419,000 --> 0:14:14,000
they've just been sold a bag of goods

294
0:14:11.329,000 --> 0:14:14,000
thank you

295
0:14:19.43,000 --> 0:14:23,000
I know it's this is a sensitive topic

296
0:14:22.23,000 --> 0:14:25,000
but a very important one so thank you

297
0:14:23.7,000 --> 0:14:27,000
for for bringing this up and helping us

298
0:14:26.22,000 --> 0:14:3,000
explore it you know a lot of folks are

299
0:14:28.17,000 --> 0:14:32,000
gonna are experiencing health benefits

300
0:14:30.39,000 --> 0:14:34,000
from marijuana and cannabis what would

301
0:14:32.88,000 --> 0:14:36,000
you say to that part of the community

302
0:14:34.55,000 --> 0:14:37,000
I'm actually really glad you brought

303
0:14:36.9,000 --> 0:14:38,000
that up I think one of the most

304
0:14:38.19,000 --> 0:14:42,000
important things that we can do right

305
0:14:39.69,000 --> 0:14:44,000
now is to separate out medicinal and

306
0:14:42.99,000 --> 0:14:45,000
especially what's what's happening in

307
0:14:44.79,000 --> 0:14:48,000
some of the advances that are being made

308
0:14:46.52,000 --> 0:14:5,000
using parts of this plant and even some

309
0:14:49.32,000 --> 0:14:53,000
whole plant medicines from the

310
0:14:51.18,000 --> 0:14:56,000
commercial market for THC and that's I

311
0:14:54.06,000 --> 0:14:58,000
think like crucial we got to stop

312
0:14:56.4,000 --> 0:14:59,000
putting them together and we got to say

313
0:14:58.14,000 --> 0:15:03,000
okay here's the part about getting high

314
0:14:59.88,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and here's the part about the medicine

315
0:15:06.44,000 --> 0:15:12,000
so it sounds like your talks less about

316
0:15:10.71,000 --> 0:15:14,000
being anti cannabis and more about

317
0:15:13.32,000 --> 0:15:17,000
raising awareness about aspects of

318
0:15:15.66,000 --> 0:15:22,000
commercialization is that a fair way to

319
0:15:17.82,000 --> 0:15:28,000
put it yes so I am NOT the anti weed guy

320
0:15:23.03,000 --> 0:15:3,000
I'm the pro logic guy for me to cast

321
0:15:28.92,000 --> 0:15:31,000
stones and listen I'm a drug addict I

322
0:15:30.87,000 --> 0:15:33,000
don't get to do that and I don't want to

323
0:15:32.34,000 --> 0:15:35,000
do that but what's bothering me it was

324
0:15:34.38,000 --> 0:15:37,000
so hard for me

325
0:15:35.43,000 --> 0:15:39,000
it is to see the way that we are like

326
0:15:37.38,000 --> 0:15:41,000
we're just embracing without asking the

327
0:15:39.81,000 --> 0:15:42,000
hard questions when if this was another

328
0:15:41.46,000 --> 0:15:46,000
industry we'd be holding their feet to

329
0:15:43.71,000 --> 0:15:48,000
the fire on some stuff and no I'm not

330
0:15:46.92,000 --> 0:15:5,000
the anti weed guy I'm the pro thought

331
0:15:48.96,000 --> 0:15:52,000
guy so think I don't even care if you're

332
0:15:51.45,000 --> 0:15:54,000
smoking when you do it just as long as

333
0:15:53.07,000 --> 0:15:58,000
you're an adult so long as you're an

334
0:15:54.48,000 --> 0:16:04,000
adult just stink

335
0:15:58.1,000 --> 0:16:04,000

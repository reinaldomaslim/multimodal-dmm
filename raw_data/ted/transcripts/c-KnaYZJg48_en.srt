1
0:00:12.964,000 --> 0:00:14,000
When, in 1960, still a student,

2
0:00:15.734,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I got a traveling fellowship

3
0:00:18.159,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to study housing in North America.

4
0:00:21.22,000 --> 0:00:23,000
We traveled the country.

5
0:00:23.504,000 --> 0:00:26,000
We saw public housing high-rise buildings

6
0:00:26.609,000 --> 0:00:28,000
in all major cities:

7
0:00:28.95,000 --> 0:00:3,000
New York, Philadelphia.

8
0:00:31.03,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Those who have no choice lived there.

9
0:00:33.999,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And then we traveled from suburb to suburb,

10
0:00:36.294,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and I came back thinking,

11
0:00:38.342,000 --> 0:00:4,000
we've got to reinvent the apartment building.

12
0:00:40.996,000 --> 0:00:42,000
There has to be another way of doing this.

13
0:00:43.675,000 --> 0:00:45,000
We can't sustain suburbs,

14
0:00:45.71,000 --> 0:00:47,000
so let's design a building

15
0:00:48.275,000 --> 0:00:51,000
which gives the qualities of a house

16
0:00:51.518,000 --> 0:00:52,000
to each unit.

17
0:00:52.689,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Habitat would be all about gardens,

18
0:00:56.85,000 --> 0:00:57,000
contact with nature,

19
0:00:58.755,000 --> 0:01:,000
streets instead of corridors.

20
0:01:00.939,000 --> 0:01:03,000
We prefabricated it so we would achieve economy,

21
0:01:04.737,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and there it is almost 50 years later.

22
0:01:09.98,000 --> 0:01:12,000
It's a very desirable place to live in.

23
0:01:13.351,000 --> 0:01:15,000
It's now a heritage building,

24
0:01:15.81,000 --> 0:01:18,000
but it did not proliferate.

25
0:01:19.413,000 --> 0:01:23,000
In 1973, I made my first trip to China.

26
0:01:24.117,000 --> 0:01:28,000
It was the Cultural Revolution.

27
0:01:28.383,000 --> 0:01:3,000
We traveled the country,

28
0:01:30.531,000 --> 0:01:33,000
met with architects and planners.

29
0:01:33.76,000 --> 0:01:35,000
This is Beijing then,

30
0:01:35.976,000 --> 0:01:37,000
not a single high rise building

31
0:01:38.848,000 --> 0:01:4,000
in Beijing or Shanghai.

32
0:01:41.132,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Shenzhen didn't even exist as a city.

33
0:01:44.99,000 --> 0:01:47,000
There were hardly any cars.

34
0:01:48.269,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Thirty years later,

35
0:01:50.92,000 --> 0:01:52,000
this is Beijing today.

36
0:01:53.915,000 --> 0:01:54,000
This is Hong Kong.

37
0:01:55.628,000 --> 0:01:57,000
If you're wealthy, you live there,

38
0:01:58.128,000 --> 0:02:,000
if you're poor, you live there,

39
0:02:00.548,000 --> 0:02:02,000
but high density it is, and it's not just Asia.

40
0:02:03.214,000 --> 0:02:04,000
São Paulo, you can travel

41
0:02:05.171,000 --> 0:02:07,000
in a helicopter 45 minutes

42
0:02:07.695,000 --> 0:02:09,000
seeing those high-rise buildings consume

43
0:02:09.705,000 --> 0:02:11,000
the 19th-century low-rise environment.

44
0:02:12.341,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And with it, comes congestion,

45
0:02:14.652,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and we lose mobility, and so on and so forth.

46
0:02:18.674,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So a few years ago, we decided to go back

47
0:02:21.224,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and rethink Habitat.

48
0:02:23.138,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Could we make it more affordable?

49
0:02:25.827,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Could we actually achieve this quality of life

50
0:02:28.89,000 --> 0:02:32,000
in the densities that are prevailing today?

51
0:02:33.297,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And we realized, it's basically about light,

52
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
it's about sun, it's about nature,

53
0:02:39.222,000 --> 0:02:41,000
it's about fractalization.

54
0:02:41.402,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Can we open up the surface of the building

55
0:02:44.631,000 --> 0:02:46,000
so that it has more contact with the exterior?

56
0:02:47.499,000 --> 0:02:49,000
We came up with a number of models:

57
0:02:49.738,000 --> 0:02:52,000
economy models, cheaper to build and more compact;

58
0:02:53.574,000 --> 0:02:55,000
membranes of housing

59
0:02:55.621,000 --> 0:02:57,000
where people could design their own house

60
0:02:57.98,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and create their own gardens.

61
0:03:00.087,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And then we decided to take New York as a test case,

62
0:03:03.968,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and we looked at Lower Manhattan.

63
0:03:06.015,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And we mapped all the building area in Manhattan.

64
0:03:09.84,000 --> 0:03:12,000
On the left is Manhattan today:

65
0:03:13.215,000 --> 0:03:17,000
blue for housing, red for office buildings, retail.

66
0:03:17.602,000 --> 0:03:19,000
On the right, we reconfigured it:

67
0:03:20.201,000 --> 0:03:22,000
the office buildings form the base,

68
0:03:22.518,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and then rising 75 stories above,

69
0:03:25.781,000 --> 0:03:26,000
are apartments.

70
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
There's a street in the air on the 25th level,

71
0:03:30.136,000 --> 0:03:32,000
a community street.

72
0:03:32.15,000 --> 0:03:33,000
It's permeable.

73
0:03:33.759,000 --> 0:03:34,000
There are gardens and open spaces

74
0:03:35.712,000 --> 0:03:36,000
for the community,

75
0:03:37.156,000 --> 0:03:4,000
almost every unit with its own private garden,

76
0:03:40.365,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and community space all around.

77
0:03:43.027,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And most important, permeable, open.

78
0:03:46.187,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It does not form a wall or an obstruction in the city,

79
0:03:49.584,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and light permeates everywhere.

80
0:03:52.419,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And in the last two or three years,

81
0:03:54.076,000 --> 0:03:56,000
we've actually been, for the first time,

82
0:03:56.648,000 --> 0:03:59,000
realizing the quality of life of Habitat

83
0:04:00.361,000 --> 0:04:03,000
in real-life projects across Asia.

84
0:04:04.068,000 --> 0:04:07,000
This in Qinhuangdao in China:

85
0:04:07.302,000 --> 0:04:09,000
middle-income housing, where there is a bylaw

86
0:04:09.88,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that every apartment must receive

87
0:04:12.587,000 --> 0:04:14,000
three hours of sunlight.

88
0:04:15.343,000 --> 0:04:17,000
That's measured in the winter solstice.

89
0:04:18.233,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And under construction in Singapore,

90
0:04:21.66,000 --> 0:04:24,000
again middle-income housing, gardens,

91
0:04:24.882,000 --> 0:04:27,000
community streets and parks and so on and so forth.

92
0:04:28.748,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And Colombo.

93
0:04:31.198,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And I want to touch on one more issue,

94
0:04:33.414,000 --> 0:04:36,000
which is the design of the public realm.

95
0:04:37.099,000 --> 0:04:4,000
A hundred years after we've begun building

96
0:04:40.693,000 --> 0:04:41,000
with tall buildings,

97
0:04:42.425,000 --> 0:04:44,000
we are yet to understand

98
0:04:44.765,000 --> 0:04:46,000
how the tall high-rise building

99
0:04:47.69,000 --> 0:04:49,000
becomes a building block in making a city,

100
0:04:50.525,000 --> 0:04:52,000
in creating the public realm.

101
0:04:53.348,000 --> 0:04:55,000
In Singapore, we had an opportunity:

102
0:04:55.767,000 --> 0:04:58,000
10 million square feet, extremely high density.

103
0:04:58.99,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Taking the concept of outdoor and indoor,

104
0:05:03.112,000 --> 0:05:05,000
promenades and parks integrated

105
0:05:05.363,000 --> 0:05:07,000
with intense urban life.

106
0:05:07.545,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So they are outdoor spaces and indoor spaces,

107
0:05:11.133,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and you move from one to the other,

108
0:05:13.11,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and there is contact with nature,

109
0:05:15.217,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and most relevantly, at every level of the structure,

110
0:05:19.188,000 --> 0:05:21,000
public gardens and open space:

111
0:05:21.877,000 --> 0:05:22,000
on the roof of the podium,

112
0:05:23.643,000 --> 0:05:24,000
climbing up the towers,

113
0:05:25.442,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and finally on the roof, the sky park,

114
0:05:29.38,000 --> 0:05:32,000
two and a half acres, jogging paths, restaurants,

115
0:05:32.754,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and the world's longest swimming pool.

116
0:05:38.109,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And that's all I can tell you in five minutes.

117
0:05:40.865,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Thank you.

118
0:05:42.733,000 --> 0:05:44,000
(Applause)

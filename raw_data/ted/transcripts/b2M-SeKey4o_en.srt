2
0:00:12.495,000 --> 0:00:14,000
In two weeks time, that's the ninth anniversary

3
0:00:15.27,000 --> 0:00:19,000
of the day I first stepped out onto that hallowed "Jeopardy" set.

4
0:00:19.37,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I mean, nine years is a long time.

5
0:00:21.22,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And given "Jeopardy's" average demographics,

6
0:00:23.138,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I think what that means

7
0:00:24.43,000 --> 0:00:27,000
is most of the people who saw me on that show are now dead.

8
0:00:27.621,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:29.804,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But not all, a few are still alive.

10
0:00:31.243,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Occasionally I still get recognized at the mall or whatever.

11
0:00:33.756,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And when I do, it's as a bit of a know-it-all.

12
0:00:36.458,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I think that ship has sailed, it's too late for me.

13
0:00:38.912,000 --> 0:00:4,000
For better or for worse, that's what I'm going to be known as,

14
0:00:41.103,000 --> 0:00:44,000
as the guy who knew a lot of weird stuff.

15
0:00:44.337,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And I can't complain about this.

16
0:00:46.625,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I feel like that was always sort of my destiny,

17
0:00:49.038,000 --> 0:00:52,000
although I had for many years been pretty deeply in the trivia closet.

18
0:00:52.505,000 --> 0:00:54,000
If nothing else, you realize very quickly as a teenager,

19
0:00:55.271,000 --> 0:00:58,000
it is not a hit with girls to know Captain Kirk's middle name.

20
0:00:58.459,000 --> 0:00:59,000
(Laughter)

21
0:00:59.624,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And as a result, I was sort of the deeply closeted kind of know-it-all for many years.

22
0:01:03.855,000 --> 0:01:06,000
But if you go further back, if you look at it, it's all there.

23
0:01:07.079,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I was the kind of kid who was always bugging Mom and Dad

24
0:01:10.208,000 --> 0:01:12,000
with whatever great fact I had just read about --

25
0:01:13.14,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Haley's comet or giant squids

26
0:01:14.841,000 --> 0:01:17,000
or the size of the world's biggest pumpkin pie or whatever it was.

27
0:01:18.77,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I now have a 10-year-old of my own who's exactly the same.

28
0:01:21.987,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And I know how deeply annoying it is, so karma does work.

29
0:01:26.088,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:27.588,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And I loved game shows, fascinated with game shows.

31
0:01:30.421,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I remember crying on my first day of kindergarten back in 1979

32
0:01:33.827,000 --> 0:01:35,000
because it had just hit me, as badly as I wanted to go to school,

33
0:01:36.352,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that I was also going to miss "Hollywood Squares" and "Family Feud."

34
0:01:39.685,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I was going to miss my game shows.

35
0:01:43.912,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And later, in the mid-'80s,

36
0:01:45.602,000 --> 0:01:46,000
when "Jeopardy" came back on the air,

37
0:01:47.213,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I remember running home from school every day to watch the show.

38
0:01:51.286,000 --> 0:01:56,000
It was my favorite show, even before it paid for my house.

39
0:01:56.788,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And we lived overseas, we lived in South Korea where my dad was working,

40
0:01:59.202,000 --> 0:02:01,000
where there was only one English language TV channel.

41
0:02:01.619,000 --> 0:02:02,000
There was Armed Forces TV,

42
0:02:02.869,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and if you didn't speak Korean, that's what you were watching.

43
0:02:05.035,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So me and all my friends would run home every day and watch "Jeopardy."

44
0:02:08.351,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I was always that kind of obsessed trivia kid.

45
0:02:11.352,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I remember being able to play Trivial Pursuit against my parents back in the '80s

46
0:02:16.535,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and holding my own, back when that was a fad.

47
0:02:19.369,000 --> 0:02:21,000
There's a weird sense of mastery you get

48
0:02:21.417,000 --> 0:02:24,000
when you know some bit of boomer trivia that Mom and Dad don't know.

49
0:02:24.662,000 --> 0:02:27,000
You know some Beatles factoid that Dad didn't know.

50
0:02:28.218,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And you think, ah hah, knowledge really is power --

51
0:02:31.202,000 --> 0:02:38,000
the right fact deployed at exactly the right place.

52
0:02:38.386,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I never had a guidance counselor

53
0:02:40.202,000 --> 0:02:42,000
who thought this was a legitimate career path,

54
0:02:42.586,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that thought you could major in trivia

55
0:02:45.035,000 --> 0:02:48,000
or be a professional ex-game show contestant.

56
0:02:48.452,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And so I sold out way too young.

57
0:02:50.852,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I didn't try to figure out what one does with that.

58
0:02:52.286,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I studied computers because I heard that was the thing,

59
0:02:54.751,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and I became a computer programmer --

60
0:02:56.612,000 --> 0:02:57,000
not an especially good one,

61
0:02:58.411,000 --> 0:03:03,000
not an especially happy one at the time when I was first on "Jeopardy" in 2004.

62
0:03:03.42,000 --> 0:03:04,000
But that's what I was doing.

63
0:03:04.745,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And it made it doubly ironic -- my computer background --

64
0:03:07.585,000 --> 0:03:11,000
a few years later, I think 2009 or so,

65
0:03:11.801,000 --> 0:03:13,000
when I got another phone call from "Jeopardy" saying,

66
0:03:14.339,000 --> 0:03:16,000
"It's early days yet, but IBM tells us

67
0:03:16.662,000 --> 0:03:21,000
they want to build a supercomputer to beat you at 'Jeopardy.'

68
0:03:21.746,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Are you up for this?"

69
0:03:23.244,000 --> 0:03:24,000
This was the first I'd heard of it.

70
0:03:24.834,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And of course I said yes, for several reasons.

71
0:03:27.502,000 --> 0:03:29,000
One, because playing "Jeopardy" is a great time.

72
0:03:29.754,000 --> 0:03:32,000
It's fun. It's the most fun you can have with your pants on.

73
0:03:33.426,000 --> 0:03:35,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:35.43,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And I would do it for nothing.

75
0:03:36.835,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I don't think they know that, luckily,

76
0:03:38.568,000 --> 0:03:41,000
but I would go back and play for Arby's coupons.

77
0:03:41.786,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I just love "Jeopardy," and I always have.

78
0:03:43.918,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And second of all, because I'm a nerdy guy and this seemed like the future.

79
0:03:48.152,000 --> 0:03:49,000
People playing computers on game shows

80
0:03:50.018,000 --> 0:03:53,000
was the kind of thing I always imagined would happen in the future,

81
0:03:53.07,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and now I could be on the stage with it.

82
0:03:54.618,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I was not going to say no.

83
0:03:55.702,000 --> 0:03:56,000
The third reason I said yes

84
0:03:56.835,000 --> 0:03:58,000
is because I was pretty confident that I was going to win.

85
0:03:59.435,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I had taken some artificial intelligence classes.

86
0:04:01.571,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I knew there were no computers that could do what you need to do to win on "Jeopardy."

87
0:04:05.901,000 --> 0:04:08,000
People don't realize how tough it is to write that kind of program

88
0:04:09.101,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that can read a "Jeopardy" clue in a natural language like English

89
0:04:12.661,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and understand all the double meanings, the puns, the red herrings,

90
0:04:16.286,000 --> 0:04:18,000
unpack the meaning of the clue.

91
0:04:18.853,000 --> 0:04:22,000
The kind of thing that a three- or four-year-old human, little kid could do,

92
0:04:23.494,000 --> 0:04:25,000
very hard for a computer.

93
0:04:25.719,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And I thought, well this is going to be child's play.

94
0:04:28.828,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Yes, I will come destroy the computer and defend my species.

95
0:04:33.752,000 --> 0:04:34,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:35.603,000 --> 0:04:36,000
But as the years went on,

97
0:04:37.203,000 --> 0:04:4,000
as IBM started throwing money and manpower and processor speed at this,

98
0:04:40.994,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I started to get occasional updates from them,

99
0:04:43.085,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and I started to get a little more worried.

100
0:04:44.87,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I remember a journal article about this new question answering software that had a graph.

101
0:04:50.953,000 --> 0:04:53,000
It was a scatter chart showing performance on "Jeopardy,"

102
0:04:54.87,000 --> 0:04:57,000
tens of thousands of dots representing "Jeopardy" champions up at the top

103
0:04:58.521,000 --> 0:05:,000
with their performance plotted on number of --

104
0:05:00.803,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I was going to say questions answered, but answers questioned, I guess,

105
0:05:04.869,000 --> 0:05:05,000
clues responded to --

106
0:05:06.828,000 --> 0:05:08,000
versus the accuracy of those answers.

107
0:05:09.219,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So there's a certain performance level that the computer would need to get to.

108
0:05:12.578,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And at first, it was very low.

109
0:05:14.369,000 --> 0:05:17,000
There was no software that could compete at this kind of arena.

110
0:05:17.736,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But then you see the line start to go up.

111
0:05:19.92,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And it's getting very close to what they call the winner's cloud.

112
0:05:22.403,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And I noticed in the upper right of the scatter chart

113
0:05:24.077,000 --> 0:05:3,000
some darker dots, some black dots, that were a different color.

114
0:05:30.202,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And thought, what are these?

115
0:05:31.77,000 --> 0:05:34,000
"The black dots in the upper right represent 74-time 'Jeopardy' champion Ken Jennings."

116
0:05:35.662,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And I saw this line coming for me.

117
0:05:37.854,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And I realized, this is it.

118
0:05:38.954,000 --> 0:05:4,000
This is what it looks like when the future comes for you.

119
0:05:40.994,000 --> 0:05:41,000
(Laughter)

120
0:05:42.937,000 --> 0:05:44,000
It's not the Terminator's gun sight;

121
0:05:45.119,000 --> 0:05:49,000
it's a little line coming closer and closer to the thing you can do,

122
0:05:49.286,000 --> 0:05:52,000
the only thing that makes you special, the thing you're best at.

123
0:05:52.421,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And when the game eventually happened about a year later,

124
0:05:57.173,000 --> 0:05:59,000
it was very different than the "Jeopardy" games I'd been used to.

125
0:06:00.036,000 --> 0:06:02,000
We were not playing in L.A. on the regular "Jeopardy" set.

126
0:06:02.537,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Watson does not travel.

127
0:06:04.803,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Watson's actually huge.

128
0:06:05.903,000 --> 0:06:09,000
It's thousands of processors, a terabyte of memory,

129
0:06:10.436,000 --> 0:06:11,000
trillions of bytes of memory.

130
0:06:11.854,000 --> 0:06:13,000
We got to walk through his climate-controlled server room.

131
0:06:14.287,000 --> 0:06:17,000
The only other "Jeopardy" contestant to this day I've ever been inside.

132
0:06:17.912,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And so Watson does not travel.

133
0:06:21.236,000 --> 0:06:25,000
You must come to it; you must make the pilgrimage.

134
0:06:25.27,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So me and the other human player

135
0:06:27.327,000 --> 0:06:3,000
wound up at this secret IBM research lab

136
0:06:30.535,000 --> 0:06:32,000
in the middle of these snowy woods in Westchester County

137
0:06:33.083,000 --> 0:06:34,000
to play the computer.

138
0:06:34.665,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And we realized right away

139
0:06:36.715,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that the computer had a big home court advantage.

140
0:06:39.614,000 --> 0:06:41,000
There was a big Watson logo in the middle of the stage.

141
0:06:41.965,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Like you're going to play the Chicago Bulls,

142
0:06:44.632,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and there's the thing in the middle of their court.

143
0:06:46.932,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And the crowd was full of IBM V.P.s and programmers

144
0:06:50.168,000 --> 0:06:51,000
cheering on their little darling,

145
0:06:52.065,000 --> 0:06:54,000
having poured millions of dollars into this

146
0:06:54.431,000 --> 0:06:56,000
hoping against hope that the humans screw up,

147
0:06:57.369,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and holding up "Go Watson" signs

148
0:06:59.166,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and just applauding like pageant moms every time their little darling got one right.

149
0:07:03.814,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I think guys had "W-A-T-S-O-N" written on their bellies in grease paint.

150
0:07:09.681,000 --> 0:07:14,000
If you can imagine computer programmers with the letters "W-A-T-S-O-N" written on their gut,

151
0:07:15.085,000 --> 0:07:16,000
it's an unpleasant sight.

152
0:07:16.752,000 --> 0:07:19,000
But they were right. They were exactly right.

153
0:07:19.799,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I don't want to spoil it, if you still have this sitting on your DVR,

154
0:07:22.215,000 --> 0:07:25,000
but Watson won handily.

155
0:07:25.382,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And I remember standing there behind the podium

156
0:07:28.249,000 --> 0:07:3,000
as I could hear that little insectoid thumb clicking.

157
0:07:31.014,000 --> 0:07:34,000
It had a robot thumb that was clicking on the buzzer.

158
0:07:34.383,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And you could hear that little tick, tick, tick, tick.

159
0:07:38.498,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And I remember thinking, this is it.

160
0:07:41.251,000 --> 0:07:42,000
I felt obsolete.

161
0:07:42.848,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I felt like a Detroit factory worker of the '80s

162
0:07:45.899,000 --> 0:07:47,000
seeing a robot that could now do his job on the assembly line.

163
0:07:48.75,000 --> 0:07:53,000
I felt like quiz show contestant was now the first job that had become obsolete

164
0:07:53.841,000 --> 0:07:56,000
under this new regime of thinking computers.

165
0:07:57.62,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And it hasn't been the last.

166
0:07:59.577,000 --> 0:08:01,000
If you watch the news, you'll see occasionally --

167
0:08:02.219,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and I see this all the time --

168
0:08:03.911,000 --> 0:08:07,000
that pharmacists now, there's a machine that can fill prescriptions automatically

169
0:08:08.669,000 --> 0:08:1,000
without actually needing a human pharmacist.

170
0:08:11.078,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And a lot of law firms are getting rid of paralegals

171
0:08:13.269,000 --> 0:08:17,000
because there's software that can sum up case laws and legal briefs and decisions.

172
0:08:17.661,000 --> 0:08:19,000
You don't need human assistants for that anymore.

173
0:08:20.169,000 --> 0:08:23,000
I read the other day about a program where you feed it a box score

174
0:08:23.302,000 --> 0:08:24,000
from a baseball or football game

175
0:08:25.086,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and it spits out a news article as if a human had watched the game

176
0:08:27.662,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and was commenting on it.

177
0:08:29.087,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And obviously these new technologies can't do as clever or creative a job

178
0:08:33.086,000 --> 0:08:34,000
as the humans they're replacing,

179
0:08:34.521,000 --> 0:08:37,000
but they're faster, and crucially, they're much, much cheaper.

180
0:08:38.338,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So it makes me wonder what the economic effects of this might be.

181
0:08:43.355,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I've read economists saying that, as a result of these new technologies,

182
0:08:46.701,000 --> 0:08:48,000
we'll enter a new golden age of leisure

183
0:08:48.826,000 --> 0:08:5,000
when we'll all have time for the things we really love

184
0:08:51.119,000 --> 0:08:57,000
because all these onerous tasks will be taken over by Watson and his digital brethren.

185
0:08:58.091,000 --> 0:08:59,000
I've heard other people say quite the opposite,

186
0:08:59.805,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that this is yet another tier of the middle class

187
0:09:02.021,000 --> 0:09:07,000
that's having the thing they can do taken away from them by a new technology

188
0:09:07.055,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and that this is actually something ominous,

189
0:09:08.619,000 --> 0:09:09,000
something that we should worry about.

190
0:09:10.124,000 --> 0:09:11,000
I'm not an economist myself.

191
0:09:11.973,000 --> 0:09:14,000
All I know is how it felt to be the guy put out of work.

192
0:09:15.245,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And it was friggin' demoralizing. It was terrible.

193
0:09:18.305,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Here's the one thing that I was ever good at,

194
0:09:20.536,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and all it took was IBM pouring tens of millions of dollars and its smartest people

195
0:09:24.689,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and thousands of processors working in parallel

196
0:09:27.222,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and they could do the same thing.

197
0:09:29.306,000 --> 0:09:32,000
They could do it a little bit faster and a little better on national TV,

198
0:09:32.537,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and "I'm sorry, Ken. We don't need you anymore."

199
0:09:35.272,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And it made me think, what does this mean,

200
0:09:39.005,000 --> 0:09:4,000
if we're going to be able to start outsourcing,

201
0:09:40.744,000 --> 0:09:43,000
not just lower unimportant brain functions.

202
0:09:44.369,000 --> 0:09:46,000
I'm sure many of you remember a distant time

203
0:09:46.844,000 --> 0:09:48,000
when we had to know phone numbers, when we knew our friends' phone numbers.

204
0:09:49.671,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And suddenly there was a machine that did that,

205
0:09:51.662,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and now we don't need to remember that anymore.

206
0:09:54.055,000 --> 0:09:55,000
I have read that there's now actually evidence

207
0:09:55.938,000 --> 0:09:59,000
that the hippocampus, the part of our brain that handles spacial relationships,

208
0:10:00.382,000 --> 0:10:01,000
physically shrinks and atrophies

209
0:10:02.036,000 --> 0:10:04,000
in people who use tools like GPS,

210
0:10:04.638,000 --> 0:10:06,000
because we're not exercising our sense of direction anymore.

211
0:10:07.202,000 --> 0:10:09,000
We're just obeying a little talking voice on our dashboard.

212
0:10:09.536,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And as a result, a part of our brain that's supposed to do that kind of stuff

213
0:10:12.14,000 --> 0:10:13,000
gets smaller and dumber.

214
0:10:13.953,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And it made me think, what happens when computers are now better

215
0:10:17.744,000 --> 0:10:2,000
at knowing and remembering stuff than we are?

216
0:10:21.244,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Is all of our brain going to start to shrink and atrophy like that?

217
0:10:25.32,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Are we as a culture going to start to value knowledge less?

218
0:10:29.087,000 --> 0:10:32,000
As somebody who has always believed in the importance of the stuff that we know,

219
0:10:32.959,000 --> 0:10:39,000
this was a terrifying idea to me.

220
0:10:40.183,000 --> 0:10:44,000
The more I thought about it, I realized, no, it's still important.

221
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
The things we know are still important.

222
0:10:47.369,000 --> 0:10:5,000
I came to believe there were two advantages

223
0:10:50.371,000 --> 0:10:53,000
that those of us who have these things in our head have

224
0:10:54.042,000 --> 0:10:58,000
over somebody who says, "Oh, yeah. I can Google that. Hold on a second."

225
0:10:58.868,000 --> 0:11:,000
There's an advantage of volume, and there's an advantage of time.

226
0:11:01.536,000 --> 0:11:02,000
The advantage of volume, first,

227
0:11:03.092,000 --> 0:11:05,000
just has to do with the complexity of the world nowadays.

228
0:11:05.724,000 --> 0:11:06,000
There's so much information out there.

229
0:11:07.141,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Being a Renaissance man or woman,

230
0:11:08.425,000 --> 0:11:1,000
that's something that was only possible in the Renaissance.

231
0:11:10.591,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Now it's really not possible

232
0:11:11.857,000 --> 0:11:14,000
to be reasonably educated on every field of human endeavor.

233
0:11:14.941,000 --> 0:11:15,000
There's just too much.

234
0:11:16.545,000 --> 0:11:18,000
They say that the scope of human information

235
0:11:19.042,000 --> 0:11:21,000
is now doubling every 18 months or so,

236
0:11:21.091,000 --> 0:11:23,000
the sum total of human information.

237
0:11:23.627,000 --> 0:11:26,000
That means between now and late 2014,

238
0:11:27.209,000 --> 0:11:3,000
we will generate as much information, in terms of gigabytes,

239
0:11:30.676,000 --> 0:11:34,000
as all of humanity has in all the previous millenia put together.

240
0:11:34.756,000 --> 0:11:36,000
It's doubling every 18 months now.

241
0:11:36.827,000 --> 0:11:39,000
This is terrifying because a lot of the big decisions we make

242
0:11:40.186,000 --> 0:11:43,000
require the mastery of lots of different kinds of facts.

243
0:11:43.462,000 --> 0:11:48,000
A decision like where do I go to school? What should I major in?

244
0:11:48.494,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Who do I vote for?

245
0:11:49.928,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Do I take this job or that one?

246
0:11:51.694,000 --> 0:11:54,000
These are the decisions that require correct judgments

247
0:11:55.328,000 --> 0:11:57,000
about many different kinds of facts.

248
0:11:57.448,000 --> 0:11:58,000
If we have those facts at our mental fingertips,

249
0:11:59.185,000 --> 0:12:01,000
we're going to be able to make informed decisions.

250
0:12:01.885,000 --> 0:12:03,000
If, on the other hand, we need to look them all up,

251
0:12:04.552,000 --> 0:12:05,000
we may be in trouble.

252
0:12:06.412,000 --> 0:12:07,000
According to a National Geographic survey I just saw,

253
0:12:08.35,000 --> 0:12:1,000
somewhere along the lines of 80 percent

254
0:12:10.67,000 --> 0:12:14,000
of the people who vote in a U.S. presidential election about issues like foreign policy

255
0:12:14.685,000 --> 0:12:16,000
cannot find Iraq or Afghanistan on a map.

256
0:12:17.652,000 --> 0:12:19,000
If you can't do that first step,

257
0:12:20.218,000 --> 0:12:23,000
are you really going to look up the other thousand facts you're going to need to know

258
0:12:23.253,000 --> 0:12:25,000
to master your knowledge of U.S. foreign policy?

259
0:12:26.219,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Quite probably not.

260
0:12:27.484,000 --> 0:12:28,000
At some point you're just going to be like,

261
0:12:28.801,000 --> 0:12:29,000
"You know what? There's too much to know. Screw it."

262
0:12:30.668,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And you'll make a less informed decision.

263
0:12:32.468,000 --> 0:12:35,000
The other issue is the advantage of time that you have

264
0:12:35.952,000 --> 0:12:36,000
if you have all these things at your fingertips.

265
0:12:37.886,000 --> 0:12:4,000
I always think of the story of a little girl named Tilly Smith.

266
0:12:41.302,000 --> 0:12:43,000
She was a 10-year-old girl from Surrey, England

267
0:12:43.985,000 --> 0:12:46,000
on vacation with her parents a few years ago in Phuket, Thailand.

268
0:12:47.318,000 --> 0:12:48,000
She runs up to them on the beach one morning

269
0:12:48.968,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and says, "Mom, Dad, we've got to get off the beach."

270
0:12:51.553,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And they say, "What do you mean? We just got here."

271
0:12:54.1,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And she said, "In Mr. Kearney's geography class last month,

272
0:12:57.2,000 --> 0:12:59,000
he told us that when the tide goes out abruptly out to sea

273
0:13:00.135,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and you see the waves churning way out there,

274
0:13:01.827,000 --> 0:13:05,000
that's the sign of a tsunami, and you need to clear the beach."

275
0:13:06.025,000 --> 0:13:08,000
What would you do if your 10-year-old daughter came up to you with this?

276
0:13:08.22,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Her parents thought about it,

277
0:13:09.564,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and they finally, to their credit, decided to believe her.

278
0:13:11.698,000 --> 0:13:13,000
They told the lifeguard, they went back to the hotel,

279
0:13:13.713,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and the lifeguard cleared over 100 people off the beach, luckily,

280
0:13:17.597,000 --> 0:13:19,000
because that was the day of the Boxing Day tsunami,

281
0:13:20.502,000 --> 0:13:21,000
the day after Christmas, 2004,

282
0:13:22.097,000 --> 0:13:25,000
that killed thousands of people in Southeast Asia and around the Indian Ocean.

283
0:13:26.063,000 --> 0:13:28,000
But not on that beach, not on Mai Khao Beach,

284
0:13:28.537,000 --> 0:13:33,000
because this little girl had remembered one fact from her geography teacher a month before.

285
0:13:33.751,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Now when facts come in handy like that --

286
0:13:35.848,000 --> 0:13:38,000
I love that story because it shows you the power of one fact,

287
0:13:39.463,000 --> 0:13:43,000
one remembered fact in exactly the right place at the right time --

288
0:13:43.735,000 --> 0:13:45,000
normally something that's easier to see on game shows than in real life.

289
0:13:46.48,000 --> 0:13:48,000
But in this case it happened in real life.

290
0:13:48.583,000 --> 0:13:49,000
And it happens in real life all the time.

291
0:13:50.202,000 --> 0:13:52,000
It's not always a tsunami, often it's a social situation.

292
0:13:52.416,000 --> 0:13:56,000
It's a meeting or job interview or first date

293
0:13:57.129,000 --> 0:13:58,000
or some relationship that gets lubricated

294
0:13:58.803,000 --> 0:14:01,000
because two people realize they share some common piece of knowledge.

295
0:14:02.183,000 --> 0:14:04,000
You say where you're from, and I say, "Oh, yeah."

296
0:14:04.734,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Or your alma mater or your job,

297
0:14:06.367,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and I know just a little something about it,

298
0:14:08.284,000 --> 0:14:09,000
enough to get the ball rolling.

299
0:14:09.833,000 --> 0:14:1,000
People love that shared connection that gets created

300
0:14:11.702,000 --> 0:14:13,000
when somebody knows something about you.

301
0:14:13.994,000 --> 0:14:17,000
It's like they took the time to get to know you before you even met.

302
0:14:18.004,000 --> 0:14:19,000
That's often the advantage of time.

303
0:14:19.416,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And it's not effective if you say, "Well, hold on.

304
0:14:20.901,000 --> 0:14:25,000
You're from Fargo, North Dakota. Let me see what comes up.

305
0:14:26.465,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Oh, yeah. Roger Maris was from Fargo."

306
0:14:28.367,000 --> 0:14:31,000
That doesn't work. That's just annoying.

307
0:14:31.4,000 --> 0:14:33,000
(Laughter)

308
0:14:33.847,000 --> 0:14:38,000
The great 18th-century British theologian and thinker, friend of Dr. Johnson,

309
0:14:39.549,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Samuel Parr once said, "It's always better to know a thing than not to know it."

310
0:14:45.917,000 --> 0:14:49,000
And if I have lived my life by any kind of creed, it's probably that.

311
0:14:50.45,000 --> 0:14:55,000
I have always believed that the things we know -- that knowledge is an absolute good,

312
0:14:55.983,000 --> 0:14:57,000
that the things we have learned and carry with us in our heads

313
0:14:58.783,000 --> 0:15:,000
are what make us who we are,

314
0:15:00.801,000 --> 0:15:02,000
as individuals and as a species.

315
0:15:03.318,000 --> 0:15:07,000
I don't know if I want to live in a world where knowledge is obsolete.

316
0:15:07.415,000 --> 0:15:1,000
I don't want to live in a world where cultural literacy has been replaced

317
0:15:10.751,000 --> 0:15:11,000
by these little bubbles of specialty,

318
0:15:12.661,000 --> 0:15:15,000
so that none of us know about the common associations

319
0:15:16.167,000 --> 0:15:18,000
that used to bind our civilization together.

320
0:15:18.683,000 --> 0:15:19,000
I don't want to be the last trivia know-it-all

321
0:15:20.617,000 --> 0:15:21,000
sitting on a mountain somewhere,

322
0:15:22.035,000 --> 0:15:26,000
reciting to himself the state capitals and the names of "Simpsons" episodes

323
0:15:26.4,000 --> 0:15:29,000
and the lyrics of Abba songs.

324
0:15:30.066,000 --> 0:15:34,000
I feel like our civilization works when this is a vast cultural heritage that we all share

325
0:15:34.549,000 --> 0:15:37,000
and that we know without having to outsource it to our devices,

326
0:15:37.735,000 --> 0:15:39,000
to our search engines and our smartphones.

327
0:15:40.34,000 --> 0:15:44,000
In the movies, when computers like Watson start to think,

328
0:15:44.967,000 --> 0:15:46,000
things don't always end well.

329
0:15:47.55,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Those movies are never about beautiful utopias.

330
0:15:51.348,000 --> 0:15:56,000
It's always a terminator or a matrix or an astronaut getting sucked out an airlock in "2001."

331
0:15:57.083,000 --> 0:16:,000
Things always go terribly wrong.

332
0:16:00.318,000 --> 0:16:01,000
And I feel like we're sort of at the point now

333
0:16:02.25,000 --> 0:16:06,000
where we need to make that choice of what kind of future we want to be living in.

334
0:16:06.333,000 --> 0:16:07,000
This is a question of leadership,

335
0:16:07.85,000 --> 0:16:1,000
because it becomes a question of who leads the future.

336
0:16:11.517,000 --> 0:16:17,000
On the one hand, we can choose between a new golden age

337
0:16:17.7,000 --> 0:16:2,000
where information is more universally available

338
0:16:21.002,000 --> 0:16:22,000
than it's ever been in human history,

339
0:16:22.663,000 --> 0:16:24,000
where we all have the answers to our questions at our fingertips.

340
0:16:25.034,000 --> 0:16:26,000
And on the other hand,

341
0:16:26.577,000 --> 0:16:28,000
we have the potential to be living in some gloomy dystopia

342
0:16:29.35,000 --> 0:16:31,000
where the machines have taken over

343
0:16:31.369,000 --> 0:16:34,000
and we've all decided it's not important what we know anymore,

344
0:16:34.418,000 --> 0:16:36,000
that knowledge isn't valuable because it's all out there in the cloud,

345
0:16:37.033,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and why would we ever bother learning anything new.

346
0:16:43.144,000 --> 0:16:46,000
Those are the two choices we have. I know which future I would rather be living in.

347
0:16:46.933,000 --> 0:16:48,000
And we can all make that choice.

348
0:16:49.166,000 --> 0:16:52,000
We make that choice by being curious, inquisitive people who like to learn,

349
0:16:52.501,000 --> 0:16:55,000
who don't just say, "Well, as soon as the bell has rung and the class is over,

350
0:16:55.637,000 --> 0:16:56,000
I don't have to learn anymore,"

351
0:16:56.96,000 --> 0:16:59,000
or "Thank goodness I have my diploma. I'm done learning for a lifetime.

352
0:17:00.037,000 --> 0:17:02,000
I don't have to learn new things anymore."

353
0:17:02.396,000 --> 0:17:05,000
No, every day we should be striving to learn something new.

354
0:17:05.703,000 --> 0:17:09,000
We should have this unquenchable curiosity for the world around us.

355
0:17:09.895,000 --> 0:17:11,000
That's where the people you see on "Jeopardy" come from.

356
0:17:12.62,000 --> 0:17:15,000
These know-it-alls, they're not Rainman-style savants

357
0:17:15.701,000 --> 0:17:17,000
sitting at home memorizing the phone book.

358
0:17:17.803,000 --> 0:17:18,000
I've met a lot of them.

359
0:17:19.119,000 --> 0:17:2,000
For the most part, they are just normal folks

360
0:17:20.669,000 --> 0:17:24,000
who are universally interested in the world around them, curious about everything,

361
0:17:24.767,000 --> 0:17:27,000
thirsty for this knowledge about whatever subject.

362
0:17:28.086,000 --> 0:17:3,000
We can live in one of these two worlds.

363
0:17:30.619,000 --> 0:17:33,000
We can live in a world where our brains, the things that we know,

364
0:17:33.92,000 --> 0:17:34,000
continue to be the thing that makes us special,

365
0:17:35.75,000 --> 0:17:41,000
or a world in which we've outsourced all of that to evil supercomputers from the future like Watson.

366
0:17:42.12,000 --> 0:17:44,000
Ladies and gentlemen, the choice is yours.

367
0:17:44.768,000 --> 0:17:46,000
Thank you very much.

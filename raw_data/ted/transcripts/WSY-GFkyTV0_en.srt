You never give it any thought,

3
0:00:13.564,000 --> 0:00:15,000
and there are billions of them out there,

4
0:00:15.869,000 --> 0:00:18,000
but the amount of design and passion and creativity

5
0:00:19.44,000 --> 0:00:23,000
that goes into this little disc is remarkable.

The coffee cup lid is a lid for your coffee cup.

9
0:00:34.374,000 --> 0:00:35,000
It snaps on.

10
0:00:35.735,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It has an opening.

11
0:00:36.982,000 --> 0:00:39,000
You've got lids with a little latch that opens and closes.

12
0:00:40.503,000 --> 0:00:42,000
You've got ones that are in creative shapes.

13
0:00:43.134,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Coffee cup lids have their own vocabulary.

14
0:00:45.86,000 --> 0:00:47,000
People talk about the "peripheral skirts,"

15
0:00:48.25,000 --> 0:00:5,000
the "press-in dimples," the "fragrance outlets,"

16
0:00:51.23,000 --> 0:00:52,000
the "slosh factor."

17
0:00:52.62,000 --> 0:00:53,000
But you need these words,

18
0:00:53.93,000 --> 0:00:55,000
because so much thought and innovation

19
0:00:56.09,000 --> 0:00:58,000
goes into these coffee cup lids.

20
0:00:58.2,000 --> 0:01:,000
Our society is just more and more mobile.

21
0:01:01.22,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Everything is on the move.

22
0:01:02.71,000 --> 0:01:03,000
The good part: it's convenient.

23
0:01:04.237,000 --> 0:01:07,000
You can drink coffee anywhere, you don't have the stay in the diner.

24
0:01:07.464,000 --> 0:01:09,000
It can be in the subway. You can be walking.

25
0:01:09.559,000 --> 0:01:12,000
The bad part is, it's harder to savor a coffee

26
0:01:12.63,000 --> 0:01:14,000
when you're taking it on the road.

27
0:01:15.28,000 --> 0:01:17,000
The first patent for a lid on a cup

28
0:01:17.915,000 --> 0:01:18,000
was in 1934,

29
0:01:19.22,000 --> 0:01:2,000
but it was for cold beverages.

30
0:01:20.87,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And in 1950, this guy named James Reifsnyder

31
0:01:24.23,000 --> 0:01:26,000
invented the first snap-on lid.

32
0:01:27.17,000 --> 0:01:29,000
But it didn't have an opening for drinking.

33
0:01:29.93,000 --> 0:01:32,000
In the '60s there was this huge cultural shift,

34
0:01:33.41,000 --> 0:01:35,000
where people started drinking coffee on the move.

35
0:01:35.96,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And 7-Eleven was the first to sell coffee to go.

36
0:01:39.55,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And then came this revolution in 1967.

37
0:01:42.88,000 --> 0:01:44,000
A man named Alan Frank invented a lid

38
0:01:45.71,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that you could peel a tab off,

39
0:01:47.72,000 --> 0:01:48,000
like in the shape of a guitar pick,

40
0:01:49.5,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and drink it from there.

41
0:01:50.89,000 --> 0:01:52,000
In 1975, another big advance:

42
0:01:53.34,000 --> 0:01:56,000
you could peel back a tab and attach it to the lid itself.

43
0:01:56.97,000 --> 0:01:59,000
So, more and more people started drinking coffee on the go.

44
0:02:00.564,000 --> 0:02:05,000
In 1984, a watershed moment in the history of coffee cup lids:

45
0:02:06.15,000 --> 0:02:08,000
the birth of the traveler lid.

46
0:02:09.091,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And it is iconic -- you've seen it a million times.

47
0:02:11.88,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And it solved a whole host of problems.

48
0:02:14.51,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It's designed so that you don't splash your face,

49
0:02:18.43,000 --> 0:02:2,000
because it's higher than any of the other ones.

50
0:02:21.356,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And it's got this protruding rim,

51
0:02:23.6,000 --> 0:02:26,000
so it slightly cools the coffee before it hits your lips.

52
0:02:26.71,000 --> 0:02:29,000
It's got a small depression in the center for your nose,

53
0:02:30.35,000 --> 0:02:33,000
so you can really get in there and get maximum aroma.

54
0:02:33.57,000 --> 0:02:36,000
It's got this tiny air hole that lets the steam out

55
0:02:36.61,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and stops it from creating a vacuum.

56
0:02:39.36,000 --> 0:02:41,000
This is one of those objects where you just don't notice it

57
0:02:42.21,000 --> 0:02:43,000
until it dribbles on your lap.

58
0:02:43.75,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So I think the coffee cup lid will just continue to evolve,

59
0:02:48.031,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and you're going to see a move away from single-use plastic lids

60
0:02:51.102,000 --> 0:02:53,000
to lids that are a little more sustainable.

61
0:02:53.82,000 --> 0:02:54,000
We're not going to stop moving.

62
0:02:55.314,000 --> 0:02:56,000
We're not going to stop drinking coffee.

63
0:02:57.246,000 --> 0:03:,000
And I think that's what these coffee lid engineers are trying to do,

64
0:03:01.202,000 --> 0:03:05,000
is to make it so that the experience of taking it on the road

65
0:03:05.988,000 --> 0:03:09,000
is as good as sitting in a restaurant, drinking from a ceramic cup.

66
0:03:10.284,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Because, you know, coffee is serious business.

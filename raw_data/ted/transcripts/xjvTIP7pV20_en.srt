1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:13,000
When I was in the fifth grade,

2
0:00:14.24,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I bought an issue of "DC Comics Presents #57"

3
0:00:18.64,000 --> 0:00:2,000
off of a spinner rack at my local bookstore,

4
0:00:21.4,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and that comic book changed my life.

5
0:00:25.12,000 --> 0:00:28,000
The combination of words and pictures did something inside my head

6
0:00:28.52,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that had never been done before,

7
0:00:30.08,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and I immediately fell in love with the medium of comics.

8
0:00:33.8,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I became a voracious comic book reader,

9
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but I never brought them to school.

10
0:00:38.72,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Instinctively, I knew that comic books didn't belong in the classroom.

11
0:00:44.56,000 --> 0:00:46,000
My parents definitely were not fans,

12
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and I was certain that my teachers wouldn't be either.

13
0:00:50.12,000 --> 0:00:52,000
After all, they never used them to teach,

14
0:00:52.4,000 --> 0:00:55,000
comic books and graphic novels were never allowed during silent sustained reading,

15
0:00:56.32,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and they were never sold at our annual book fair.

16
0:00:59.84,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Even so, I kept reading comics,

17
0:01:02.44,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and I even started making them.

18
0:01:04.08,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Eventually I became a published cartoonist,

19
0:01:07.12,000 --> 0:01:09,000
writing and drawing comic books for a living.

20
0:01:10.68,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I also became a high school teacher.

21
0:01:12.96,000 --> 0:01:13,000
This is where I taught:

22
0:01:14.28,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Bishop O'Dowd High School in Oakland, California.

23
0:01:17.12,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I taught a little bit of math and a little bit of art,

24
0:01:19.68,000 --> 0:01:2,000
but mostly computer science,

25
0:01:21.08,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and I was there for 17 years.

26
0:01:23.52,000 --> 0:01:24,000
When I was a brand new teacher,

27
0:01:25.4,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I tried bringing comic books into my classroom.

28
0:01:28.56,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I remember telling my students on the first day of every class

29
0:01:31.68,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that I was also a cartoonist.

30
0:01:33.8,000 --> 0:01:36,000
It wasn't so much that I was planning to teach them with comics,

31
0:01:36.92,000 --> 0:01:4,000
it was more that I was hoping comics would make them think that I was cool.

32
0:01:40.96,000 --> 0:01:41,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:42.4,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I was wrong.

34
0:01:43.8,000 --> 0:01:44,000
This was the '90s,

35
0:01:45.8,000 --> 0:01:49,000
so comic books didn't have the cultural cachet that they do today.

36
0:01:50.12,000 --> 0:01:53,000
My students didn't think I was cool. They thought I was kind of a dork.

37
0:01:54.08,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And even worse, when stuff got hard in my class,

38
0:01:57,000 --> 0:02:,000
they would use comic books as a way of distracting me.

39
0:02:00.32,000 --> 0:02:02,000
They would raise their hands and ask me questions like,

40
0:02:02.96,000 --> 0:02:04,000
"Mr. Yang, who do you think would win in a fight,

41
0:02:05.32,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Superman or the Hulk?"

42
0:02:06.6,000 --> 0:02:07,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:07.64,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I very quickly realized I had to keep my teaching and my cartooning separate.

44
0:02:12.72,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It seemed like my instincts in fifth grade were correct.

45
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Comic books didn't belong in the classroom.

46
0:02:19.8,000 --> 0:02:2,000
But again, I was wrong.

47
0:02:21.8,000 --> 0:02:23,000
A few years into my teaching career,

48
0:02:23.88,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I learned firsthand the educational potential of comics.

49
0:02:28.8,000 --> 0:02:31,000
One semester, I was asked to sub for this Algebra 2 class.

50
0:02:32.36,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I was asked to long-term sub it, and I said yes, but there was a problem.

51
0:02:36.68,000 --> 0:02:39,000
At the time, I was also the school's educational technologist,

52
0:02:40.4,000 --> 0:02:41,000
which meant every couple of weeks

53
0:02:42.32,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I had to miss one or two periods of this Algebra 2 class

54
0:02:45.76,000 --> 0:02:47,000
because I was in another classroom helping another teacher

55
0:02:48.6,000 --> 0:02:5,000
with a computer-related activity.

56
0:02:50.72,000 --> 0:02:53,000
For these Algebra 2 students, that was terrible.

57
0:02:53.88,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I mean, having a long-term sub is bad enough,

58
0:02:56.52,000 --> 0:02:59,000
but having a sub for your sub? That's the worst.

59
0:03:00.36,000 --> 0:03:03,000
In an effort to provide some sort of consistency for my students,

60
0:03:04.24,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I began videotaping myself giving lectures.

61
0:03:07.12,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I'd then give these videos to my sub to play for my students.

62
0:03:10.76,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I tried to make these videos as engaging as possible.

63
0:03:15.24,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I even included these little special effects.

64
0:03:17.4,000 --> 0:03:19,000
For instance, after I finished a problem on the board,

65
0:03:20.28,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I'd clap my hands,

66
0:03:21.92,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and the board would magically erase.

67
0:03:24.36,000 --> 0:03:25,000
(Laughter)

68
0:03:25.8,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I thought it was pretty awesome.

69
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I was pretty certain that my students would love it,

70
0:03:31.04,000 --> 0:03:32,000
but I was wrong.

71
0:03:32.28,000 --> 0:03:33,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:33.68,000 --> 0:03:35,000
These video lectures were a disaster.

73
0:03:36.56,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I had students coming up to me and saying things like,

74
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
"Mr. Yang, we thought you were boring in person,

75
0:03:41.44,000 --> 0:03:44,000
but on video, you are just unbearable."

76
0:03:44.92,000 --> 0:03:45,000
(Laughter)

77
0:03:46.56,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So as a desperate second attempt, I began drawing these lectures as comics.

78
0:03:51.92,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I'd do these very quickly with very little planning.

79
0:03:54.4,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I'd just take a sharpie, draw one panel after the other,

80
0:03:57.24,000 --> 0:03:59,000
figuring out what I wanted to say as I went.

81
0:03:59.96,000 --> 0:04:,000
These comics lectures would come out

82
0:04:01.72,000 --> 0:04:03,000
to anywhere between four and six pages long,

83
0:04:03.84,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I'd xerox these, give them to my sub to hand to my students.

84
0:04:08.84,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And much to my surprise,

85
0:04:11.08,000 --> 0:04:13,000
these comics lectures were a hit.

86
0:04:13.92,000 --> 0:04:16,000
My students would ask me to make these for them

87
0:04:17.48,000 --> 0:04:19,000
even when I could be there in person.

88
0:04:20.44,000 --> 0:04:24,000
It was like they liked cartoon me more than actual me.

89
0:04:24.56,000 --> 0:04:26,000
(Laughter)

90
0:04:26.64,000 --> 0:04:29,000
This surprised me, because my students are part of a generation

91
0:04:30.36,000 --> 0:04:31,000
that was raised on screens,

92
0:04:32.279,000 --> 0:04:35,000
so I thought for sure they would like learning from a screen

93
0:04:35.52,000 --> 0:04:37,000
better than learning from a page.

94
0:04:38.08,000 --> 0:04:39,000
But when I talked to my students

95
0:04:39.76,000 --> 0:04:42,000
about why they liked these comics lectures so much,

96
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I began to understand the educational potential of comics.

97
0:04:47.4,000 --> 0:04:49,000
First, unlike their math textbooks,

98
0:04:50.04,000 --> 0:04:52,000
these comics lectures taught visually.

99
0:04:52.64,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Our students grow up in a visual culture,

100
0:04:55.48,000 --> 0:04:57,000
so they're used to taking in information that way.

101
0:04:58.24,000 --> 0:05:,000
But unlike other visual narratives,

102
0:05:01.04,000 --> 0:05:05,000
like film or television or animation or video,

103
0:05:05.88,000 --> 0:05:07,000
comics are what I call permanent.

104
0:05:08.76,000 --> 0:05:13,000
In a comic, past, present and future all sit side by side on the same page.

105
0:05:14.44,000 --> 0:05:17,000
This means that the rate of information flow

106
0:05:17.88,000 --> 0:05:19,000
is firmly in the hands of the reader.

107
0:05:21.56,000 --> 0:05:25,000
When my students didn't understand something in my comics lecture,

108
0:05:25.6,000 --> 0:05:29,000
they could just reread that passage as quickly or as slowly as they needed.

109
0:05:29.84,000 --> 0:05:32,000
It was like I was giving them a remote control over the information.

110
0:05:33.84,000 --> 0:05:35,000
The same was not true of my video lectures,

111
0:05:36.76,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and it wasn't even true of my in-person lectures.

112
0:05:39.56,000 --> 0:05:43,000
When I speak, I deliver the information as quickly or slowly as I want.

113
0:05:44.32,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So for certain students and certain kinds of information,

114
0:05:47.72,000 --> 0:05:51,000
these two aspects of the comics medium, its visual nature and its permanence,

115
0:05:52.68,000 --> 0:05:55,000
make it an incredibly powerful educational tool.

116
0:05:56.36,000 --> 0:05:57,000
When I was teaching this Algebra 2 class,

117
0:05:58.36,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I was also working on my master's in education at Cal State East Bay.

118
0:06:02.6,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And I was so intrigued by this experience that I had with these comics lectures

119
0:06:06.68,000 --> 0:06:11,000
that I decided to focus my final master's project on comics.

120
0:06:11.8,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I wanted to figure out why American educators

121
0:06:14.8,000 --> 0:06:19,000
have historically been so reluctant to use comic books in their classrooms.

122
0:06:20.04,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Here's what I discovered.

123
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Comic books first became a mass medium in the 1940s,

124
0:06:24.84,000 --> 0:06:26,000
with millions of copies selling every month,

125
0:06:27.28,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and educators back then took notice.

126
0:06:29.44,000 --> 0:06:32,000
A lot of innovative teachers began bringing comics into their classrooms

127
0:06:33.44,000 --> 0:06:34,000
to experiment.

128
0:06:34.8,000 --> 0:06:37,000
In 1944, the "Journal of Educational Sociology"

129
0:06:38.68,000 --> 0:06:41,000
even devoted an entire issue to this topic.

130
0:06:42.28,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Things seemed to be progressing.

131
0:06:44.68,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Teachers were starting to figure things out.

132
0:06:47.08,000 --> 0:06:49,000
But then along comes this guy.

133
0:06:49.4,000 --> 0:06:52,000
This is child psychologist Dr. Fredric Wertham,

134
0:06:53.4,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and in 1954, he wrote a book called "Seduction of the Innocent,"

135
0:06:57.36,000 --> 0:07:01,000
where he argues that comic books cause juvenile delinquency.

136
0:07:01.92,000 --> 0:07:02,000
(Laughter)

137
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:04,000
He was wrong.

138
0:07:04.64,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Now, Dr. Wertham was actually a pretty decent guy.

139
0:07:07.04,000 --> 0:07:1,000
He spent most of his career working with juvenile delinquents,

140
0:07:10.12,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and in his work he noticed that most of his clients read comic books.

141
0:07:15.36,000 --> 0:07:18,000
What Dr. Wertham failed to realize was in the 1940s and '50s,

142
0:07:19.12,000 --> 0:07:23,000
almost every kid in America read comic books.

143
0:07:23.28,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Dr. Wertham does a pretty dubious job of proving his case,

144
0:07:26.64,000 --> 0:07:29,000
but his book does inspire the Senate of the United States

145
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:32,000
to hold a series of hearings

146
0:07:32.12,000 --> 0:07:36,000
to see if in fact comic books caused juvenile delinquency.

147
0:07:36.72,000 --> 0:07:38,000
These hearings lasted for almost two months.

148
0:07:39.48,000 --> 0:07:43,000
They ended inconclusively, but not before doing tremendous damage

149
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:48,000
to the reputation of comic books in the eyes of the American public.

150
0:07:48.2,000 --> 0:07:52,000
After this, respectable American educators all backed away,

151
0:07:52.56,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and they stayed away for decades.

152
0:07:54.4,000 --> 0:07:55,000
It wasn't until the 1970s

153
0:07:55.88,000 --> 0:07:58,000
that a few brave souls started making their way back in.

154
0:07:59.36,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And it really wasn't until pretty recently,

155
0:08:01.44,000 --> 0:08:02,000
maybe the last decade or so,

156
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that comics have seen more widespread acceptance

157
0:08:06.08,000 --> 0:08:07,000
among American educators.

158
0:08:07.88,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Comic books and graphic novels are now finally making their way

159
0:08:12.04,000 --> 0:08:13,000
back into American classrooms

160
0:08:13.92,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and this is even happening at Bishop O'Dowd, where I used to teach.

161
0:08:17.76,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Mr. Smith, one of my former colleagues,

162
0:08:19.68,000 --> 0:08:21,000
uses Scott McCloud's "Understanding Comics"

163
0:08:22.64,000 --> 0:08:25,000
in his literature and film class, because that book gives his students

164
0:08:26.64,000 --> 0:08:31,000
the language with which to discuss the relationship between words and images.

165
0:08:31.76,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Mr. Burns assigns a comics essay to his students every year.

166
0:08:35.68,000 --> 0:08:38,000
By asking his students to process a prose novel using images,

167
0:08:39.64,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Mr. Burns asks them to think deeply

168
0:08:42.2,000 --> 0:08:43,000
not just about the story

169
0:08:44.159,000 --> 0:08:47,000
but also about how that story is told.

170
0:08:47.2,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And Ms. Murrock uses my own "American Born Chinese"

171
0:08:50.32,000 --> 0:08:51,000
with her English 1 students.

172
0:08:52.12,000 --> 0:08:53,000
For her, graphic novels

173
0:08:53.76,000 --> 0:08:56,000
are a great way of fulfilling a Common Core Standard.

174
0:08:57.56,000 --> 0:08:59,000
The Standard states that students ought to be able to analyze

175
0:09:00.48,000 --> 0:09:05,000
how visual elements contribute to the meaning, tone and beauty of a text.

176
0:09:06.76,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Over in the library, Ms. Counts has built a pretty impressive

177
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:12,000
graphic novel collection for Bishop O'Dowd.

178
0:09:12.36,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Now, Ms. Counts and all of her librarian colleagues

179
0:09:15.56,000 --> 0:09:18,000
have really been at the forefront of comics advocacy,

180
0:09:18.6,000 --> 0:09:21,000
really since the early '80s, when a school library journal article

181
0:09:22.12,000 --> 0:09:26,000
stated that the mere presence of graphic novels in the library

182
0:09:26.48,000 --> 0:09:28,000
increased usage by about 80 percent

183
0:09:29.28,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and increased the circulation of noncomics material

184
0:09:33.36,000 --> 0:09:34,000
by about 30 percent.

185
0:09:35.24,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Inspired by this renewed interest from American educators,

186
0:09:38.68,000 --> 0:09:42,000
American cartoonists are now producing more explicitly educational content

187
0:09:43.64,000 --> 0:09:45,000
for the K-12 market than ever before.

188
0:09:46.36,000 --> 0:09:49,000
A lot of this is directed at language arts,

189
0:09:49.56,000 --> 0:09:51,000
but more and more comics and graphic novels

190
0:09:51.64,000 --> 0:09:54,000
are starting to tackle math and science topics.

191
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
STEM comics graphics novels really are like this uncharted territory,

192
0:09:59.68,000 --> 0:10:,000
ready to be explored.

193
0:10:01.92,000 --> 0:10:03,000
America is finally waking up to the fact

194
0:10:04.44,000 --> 0:10:08,000
that comic books do not cause juvenile delinquency.

195
0:10:08.64,000 --> 0:10:09,000
(Laughter)

196
0:10:09.68,000 --> 0:10:13,000
That they really do belong in every educator's toolkit.

197
0:10:13.88,000 --> 0:10:16,000
There's no good reason to keep comic books and graphic novels

198
0:10:17.24,000 --> 0:10:19,000
out of K-12 education.

199
0:10:19.32,000 --> 0:10:2,000
They teach visually,

200
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:23,000
they give our students that remote control.

201
0:10:24.52,000 --> 0:10:26,000
The educational potential is there

202
0:10:27.24,000 --> 0:10:28,000
just waiting to be tapped

203
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:3,000
by creative people like you.

204
0:10:31.44,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Thank you.

205
0:10:32.68,000 --> 0:10:35,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:29,000
This meeting has really been about a digital revolution,

2
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:32,000
but I'd like to argue that it's done; we won.

3
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
We've had a digital revolution but we don't need to keep having it.

4
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And I'd like to look after that,

5
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:42,000
to look what comes after the digital revolution.

6
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So, let me start projecting forward.

7
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:48,000
These are some projects I'm involved in today at MIT,

8
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:51,000
looking what comes after computers.

9
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:56,000
This first one, Internet Zero, up here -- this is a web server

10
0:00:56,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that has the cost and complexity of an RFID tag --

11
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:02,000
about a dollar -- that can go in every light bulb and doorknob,

12
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and this is getting commercialized very quickly.

13
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And what's interesting about it isn't the cost;

14
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:07,000
it's the way it encodes the Internet.

15
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:1,000
It uses a kind of a Morse code for the Internet

16
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:13,000
so you could send it optically; you can communicate acoustically

17
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:15,000
through a power line, through RF.

18
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:17,000
It takes the original principle of the Internet,

19
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:19,000
which is inter-networking computers,

20
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and now lets devices inter-network.

21
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:25,000
That we can take the whole idea that gave birth to the Internet

22
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and bring it down to the physical world in this Internet Zero,

23
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:3,000
this internet of devices.

24
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So this is the next step from there to here,

25
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and this is getting commercialized today.

26
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:4,000
A step after that is a project on fungible computers.

27
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Fungible goods in economics can be extended and traded.

28
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So, half as much grain is half as much useful,

29
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:48,000
but half a baby or half a computer is less useful than

30
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:5,000
a whole baby or a whole computer,

31
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and we've been trying to make computers that work that way.

32
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So, what you see in the background is a prototype.

33
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:58,000
This was from a thesis of a student, Bill Butow, now at Intel,

34
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:01,000
who wondered why, instead of making bigger and bigger chips,

35
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:04,000
you don't make small chips, put them in a viscous medium,

36
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and pour out computing by the pound or by the square inch.

37
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And that's what you see here.

38
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:11,000
On the left was postscript being rendered by a conventional computer;

39
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:14,000
on the right is postscript being rendered from the first prototype

40
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:18,000
we made, but there's no frame buffer, IO processor,

41
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:2,000
any of that stuff -- it's just this material.

42
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Unlike this screen where the dots are placed carefully,

43
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:23,000
this is a raw material.

44
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:26,000
If you add twice as much of it, you have twice as much display.

45
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
If you shoot a gun through the middle, nothing happens.

46
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:33,000
If you need more resource, you just apply more computer.

47
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So, that's the step after this -- of computing as a raw material.

48
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:39,000
That's still conventional bits, the step after that is --

49
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:41,000
this is an earlier prototype in the lab;

50
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:43,000
this is high-speed video slowed down.

51
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Now, integrating chemistry in computation, where the bits are bubbles.

52
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:48,000
This is showing making bits, this is showing --

53
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:5,000
once again, slowed down so you can see it,

54
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:54,000
bits interacting to do logic and multiplexing and de-multiplexing.

55
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:57,000
So, now we can compute that the output arranges material

56
0:02:57,000 --> 0:03:01,000
as well as information. And, ultimately, these are some slides

57
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:04,000
from an early project I did, computing where the bits are stored

58
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:07,000
quantum-mechanically in the nuclei of atoms, so

59
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:11,000
programs rearrange the nuclear structure of molecules.

60
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:15,000
All of these are in the lab pushing further and further and further,

61
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:18,000
not as metaphor but literally integrating bits and atoms,

62
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and they lead to the following recognition.

63
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:24,000
We all know we've had a digital revolution, but what is that?

64
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Well, Shannon took us, in the '40s, from here to here:

65
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:31,000
from a telephone being a speaker wire that degraded with distance

66
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to the Internet. And he proved the first threshold theorem, that shows

67
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:38,000
if you add information and remove it to a signal,

68
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:4,000
you can compute perfectly with an imperfect device.

69
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And that's when we got the Internet.

70
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Von Neumann, in the '50s, did the same thing for computing;

71
0:03:45,000 --> 0:03:48,000
he showed you can have an unreliable computer but restore its state

72
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:52,000
to make it perfect. This was the last great analog computer at MIT:

73
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:54,000
a differential analyzer, and the more you ran it,

74
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:56,000
the worse the answer got.

75
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:59,000
After Von Neumann, we have the Pentium, where the billionth transistor

76
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:02,000
is as reliable as the first one.

77
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:05,000
But all our fabrication is down in this lower left corner.

78
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:08,000
A state-of-the-art airplane factory rotating metal wax at fixed metal,

79
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:11,000
or you maybe melt some plastic. A 10-billion-dollar chip fab

80
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:14,000
uses a process a village artisan would recognize --

81
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:17,000
you spread stuff around and bake it.

82
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:19,000
All the intelligence is external to the system;

83
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:21,000
the materials don't have information.

84
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Yesterday you heard about molecular biology,

85
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:26,000
which fundamentally computes to build.

86
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
It's an information processing system.

87
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:32,000
We've had digital revolutions in communication and computation,

88
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:35,000
but precisely the same idea, precisely the same math

89
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Shannon and Von Neuman did, hasn't yet come out

90
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:4,000
to the physical world. So, inspired by that,

91
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:42,000
colleagues in this program -- the Center for Bits and Atoms

92
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:45,000
at MIT -- which is a group of people, like me,

93
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:48,000
who never understood the boundary between physical science

94
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and computer science. I would even go further and say

95
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:53,000
computer science is one of the worst things that ever happened

96
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to either computers or to science --

97
0:04:55,000 --> 0:04:56,000
(Laughter)

98
0:04:56,000 --> 0:05:,000
-- because the canon -- computer science --

99
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:02,000
many of them are great but the canon of computer science

100
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:05,000
prematurely froze a model of computation

101
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:08,000
based on technology that was available in 1950,

102
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and nature's a much more powerful computer than that.

103
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So, you'll hear, tomorrow, from Saul Griffith. He was one of the

104
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:17,000
first students to emerge from this program.

105
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:2,000
We started to figure out how you can compute to fabricate.

106
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:23,000
This was just a proof of principle he did of tiles

107
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:25,000
that interact magnetically, where you write a code,

108
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:28,000
much like protein folding, that specifies their structure.

109
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So, there's no feedback to a tool metrology;

110
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:36,000
the material itself codes for its structure in just the same ways

111
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that protein are fabricated. So, you can, for example, do that.

112
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:43,000
You can do other things. That's in 2D. It works in 3D.

113
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:45,000
The video on the upper right -- I won't show for time --

114
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:49,000
shows self-replication, templating so something can make something

115
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that can make something, and we're doing that now over, maybe,

116
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:55,000
nine orders of magnitude. Those ideas have been used to show

117
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:58,000
the best fidelity and direct rate DNA to make an organism,

118
0:05:58,000 --> 0:06:01,000
in functionalizing nanoclusters with peptide tails

119
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that code for their assembly -- so, much like the magnets,

120
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:05,000
but now on nanometer scales.

121
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Laser micro-machining: essentially 3D printers that digitally fabricate

122
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:12,000
functional systems, all the way up to building buildings,

123
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:13,000
not by having blueprints,

124
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:16,000
but having the parts code for the structure of the building.

125
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
So, these are early examples in the lab of emerging technologies

126
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:25,000
to digitize fabrication. Computers that don't control tools

127
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:29,000
but computers that are tools, where the output of a program

128
0:06:29,000 --> 0:06:33,000
rearranges atoms as well as bits.

129
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Now, to do that -- with your tax dollars, thank you --

130
0:06:36,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I bought all these machines. We made a modest proposal

131
0:06:4,000 --> 0:06:44,000
to the NSF. We wanted to be able to make anything on any length scale,

132
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:48,000
all in one place, because you can't segregate digital fabrication

133
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:5,000
by a discipline or a length scale.

134
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So we put together focused nano beam writers

135
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and supersonic water jet cutters and excimer micro-machining systems.

136
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:02,000
But I had a problem. Once I had all these machines,

137
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I was spending too much time teaching students to use them.

138
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So I started teaching a class, modestly called,

139
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:1,000
"How To Make Almost Anything." And that wasn't meant to be provocative;

140
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:12,000
it was just for a few research students.

141
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:14,000
But the first day of class looked like this.

142
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:16,000
You know, hundreds of people came in begging,

143
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
all my life I've been waiting for this class; I'll do anything to do it.

144
0:07:19,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Then they'd ask, can you teach it at MIT? It seems too useful?

145
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And then the next --

146
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:25,000
(Laughter)

147
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:26,000
-- surprising thing was they weren't there to do research.

148
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
They were there because they wanted to make stuff.

149
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:32,000
They had no conventional technical background.

150
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:34,000
At the end of a semester they integrated their skills.

151
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I'll show an old video. Kelly was a sculptor, and this is what she did

152
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:4,000
with her semester project.

153
0:07:4,000 --> 0:07:43,000
(Video): Kelly: Hi, I'm Kelly and this is my scream buddy.

154
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Do you ever find yourself in a situation

155
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:53,000
where you really have to scream, but you can't because you're at work,

156
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:56,000
or you're in a classroom, or you're watching your children,

157
0:07:56,000 --> 0:08:01,000
or you're in any number of situations where it's just not permitted?

158
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Well, scream buddy is a portable space for screaming.

159
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:1,000
When a user screams into scream buddy, their scream is silenced.

160
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:14,000
It is also recorded for later release where, when and how

161
0:08:14,000 --> 0:08:15,000
the user chooses.

162
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:38,000
(Scream)

163
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:43,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

164
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:45,000
So, Einstein would like this.

165
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:46,000
This student made a web browser for parrots --

166
0:08:46,000 --> 0:08:49,000
lets parrots surf the Net and talk to other parrots.

167
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:51,000
This student's made an alarm clock you wrestle

168
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:53,000
to prove you're awake; this is one that defends --

169
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:55,000
a dress that defends your personal space.

170
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:57,000
This isn't technology for communication;

171
0:08:57,000 --> 0:08:59,000
it's technology to prevent it.

172
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:02,000
This is a device that lets you see your music.

173
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:05,000
This is a student who made a machine that makes machines,

174
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and he made it by making Lego bricks that do the computing.

175
0:09:08,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Just year after year -- and I finally realized

176
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:14,000
the students were showing the killer app of personal fabrication

177
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:16,000
is products for a market of one person.

178
0:09:16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
You don't need this for what you can get in Wal-Mart;

179
0:09:18,000 --> 0:09:19,000
you need this for what makes you unique.

180
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Ken Olsen famously said, nobody needs a computer in the home.

181
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:25,000
But you don't use it for inventory and payroll;

182
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:28,000
DEC is now twice bankrupt. You don't need personal fabrication

183
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:3,000
in the home to buy what you can buy because you can buy it.

184
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:34,000
You need it for what makes you unique, just like personalization.

185
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:38,000
So, with that, in turn, 20 million dollars today does this;

186
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:42,000
20 years from now we'll make Star Trek replicators that make anything.

187
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:46,000
The students hijacked all the machines I bought to do personal fabrication.

188
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Today, when you spend that much of your money,

189
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:51,000
there's a government requirement to do outreach, which often means

190
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:54,000
classes at a local school, a website -- stuff that's just not that exciting.

191
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:58,000
So, I made a deal with my NSF program managers that

192
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:,000
instead of talking about it, I'd give people the tools.

193
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:02,000
This wasn't meant to be provocative or important,

194
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:06,000
but we put together these Fab Labs. It's about 20,000 dollars in equipment

195
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:11,000
that approximate both what the 20 million dollars does and where it's going.

196
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:14,000
A laser cutter to do press-fit assembly with 3D from 2D,

197
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:16,000
a sign cutter to plot in copper to do electromagnetics,

198
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
a micron scale,

199
0:10:18,000 --> 0:10:2,000
numerically-controlled milling machine for precise structures,

200
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:23,000
programming tools for less than a dollar,

201
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:26,000
100-nanosecond microcontrollers. It lets you work from microns

202
0:10:26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and microseconds on up, and they exploded around the world.

203
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:32,000
This wasn't scheduled, but they went from inner-city Boston

204
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:36,000
to Pobal in India, to Secondi-Takoradi on Ghana's coast

205
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:39,000
to Soshanguve in a township in South Africa,

206
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:43,000
to the far north of Norway, uncovering, or helping uncover,

207
0:10:43,000 --> 0:10:46,000
for all the attention to the digital divide,

208
0:10:46,000 --> 0:10:5,000
we would find unused computers in all these places.

209
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:53,000
A farmer in a rural village -- a kid needs to measure and modify

210
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:57,000
the world, not just get information about it on a screen.

211
0:10:57,000 --> 0:10:59,000
That there's really a fabrication and an instrumentation divide

212
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:02,000
bigger than the digital divide.

213
0:11:02,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And the way you close it is not IT for the masses but IT development for the masses.

214
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:08,000
So, in place after place

215
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:11,000
we saw this same progression: that we'd open one of these Fab Labs,

216
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:14,000
where we didn't -- this is too crazy to think of.

217
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:17,000
We didn't think this up, that we would get pulled to these places;

218
0:11:17,000 --> 0:11:19,000
we'd open it. The first step was just empowerment.

219
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:22,000
You can see it in their face, just this joy of, I can do it.

220
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:24,000
This is a girl in inner-city Boston who had just done a high-tech

221
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:28,000
on-demand craft sale in the inner city community center.

222
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:32,000
It goes on from there to serious hands-on technical education

223
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:37,000
informally, out of schools. In Ghana we had set up one of these labs.

224
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:39,000
We designed a network sensor, and kids would show up

225
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and refuse to leave the lab.

226
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:43,000
There was a girl who insisted we stay late at night --

227
0:11:43,000 --> 0:11:45,000
(Video): Kids: I love the Fab Lab.

228
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:48,000
-- her first night in the lab because she was going to make the sensor.

229
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:51,000
So she insisted on fabbing the board, learning how to stuff it,

230
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:53,000
learning how to program it. She didn't really know

231
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:55,000
what she was doing or why she was doing it, but she knew

232
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:58,000
she just had to do it. There was something electric about it.

233
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:,000
This is late at, you know, 11 o'clock at night

234
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and I think I was the only person surprised when what she built

235
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:05,000
worked the first time.

236
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And I've shown this to engineers at big companies, and they say

237
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:1,000
they can't do this. Any one thing she's doing, they can do better,

238
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:13,000
but it's distributed over many people and many sites

239
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and they can't do in an afternoon

240
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:17,000
what this little girl in rural Ghana is doing.

241
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
(Video): Girl: My name is Valentina Kofi; I am eight years old.

242
0:12:37,000 --> 0:12:4,000
I made a stacking board.

243
0:12:4,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And, again, that was just for the joy of it.

244
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Then these labs started doing serious problem solving --

245
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:48,000
instrumentation for agriculture in India,

246
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:5,000
steam turbines for energy conversion in Ghana,

247
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:54,000
high-gain antennas in thin client computers.

248
0:12:54,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And then, in turn, businesses started to grow,

249
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:56,000
like making these antennas.

250
0:12:56,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And finally, the lab started doing invention.

251
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:,000
We're learning more from them than we're giving them.

252
0:13:,000 --> 0:13:03,000
I was showing my kids in a Fab Lab how to use it.

253
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:07,000
They invented a way to do a construction kit out of a cardboard box --

254
0:13:07,000 --> 0:13:09,000
which, as you see up there, that's becoming a business --

255
0:13:09,000 --> 0:13:12,000
but their design was better than Saul's design at MIT,

256
0:13:12,000 --> 0:13:15,000
so there's now three students at MIT doing their theses on

257
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:18,000
scaling the work of eight-year-old children

258
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:19,000
because they had better designs.

259
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Real invention is happening in these labs.

260
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:24,000
And I still kept -- so, in the last year I've been spending time with

261
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:27,000
heads of state and generals and tribal chiefs who all want this,

262
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and I keep saying, but this isn't the real thing.

263
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Wait, like, 20 years and then we'll be done.

264
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And I finally got what's been going on. This is Kernigan and Ritchie

265
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:37,000
inventing UNIX on a PDP.

266
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:39,000
PDPs came between mainframes and minicomputers.

267
0:13:39,000 --> 0:13:42,000
They were tens of thousands of dollars, hard to use,

268
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:44,000
but they brought computing down to work groups,

269
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and everything we do today happened there.

270
0:13:46,000 --> 0:13:49,000
These Fab Labs are the cost and complexity of a PDP.

271
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:51,000
The projection of digital fabrication

272
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:54,000
isn't a projection for the future; we are now in the PDP era.

273
0:13:54,000 --> 0:13:57,000
We talked in hushed tones about the great discoveries then.

274
0:13:57,000 --> 0:14:,000
It was very chaotic, it wasn't, sort of, clear what was going on.

275
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:03,000
In the same sense we are now, today, in the minicomputer era

276
0:14:03,000 --> 0:14:05,000
of digital fabrication.

277
0:14:05,000 --> 0:14:09,000
The only problem with that is it breaks everybody's boundaries.

278
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:12,000
In DC, I go to every agency that wants to talk, you know;

279
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:14,000
in the Bay Area, I go to every organization you can think of --

280
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:16,000
they all want to talk about it, but it breaks

281
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
their organizational boundaries. In fact, it's illegal for them,

282
0:14:19,000 --> 0:14:23,000
in many cases, to equip ordinary people to create

283
0:14:23,000 --> 0:14:24,000
rather than consume technology.

284
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And that problem is so severe that the ultimate invention

285
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:31,000
coming from this community surprised me:

286
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:35,000
it's the social engineering. That the lab in far north of Norway --

287
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:37,000
this is so far north its satellite dishes look at the ground

288
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:41,000
rather than the sky because that's where the satellites are --

289
0:14:41,000 --> 0:14:42,000
the lab outgrew the little barn that it was in.

290
0:14:42,000 --> 0:14:45,000
It was there because they wanted to find animals in the mountains

291
0:14:45,000 --> 0:14:49,000
but it outgrew it, so they built this extraordinary village for the lab.

292
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:51,000
This isn't a university; it's not a company. It's essentially

293
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:56,000
a village for invention; it's a village for the outliers in society,

294
0:14:56,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and those have been growing up around these Fab Labs

295
0:14:58,000 --> 0:14:59,000
all around the world.

296
0:14:59,000 --> 0:15:03,000
So this program has split into an NGO foundation,

297
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:07,000
a Fab Foundation to support the scaling, a micro VC fund.

298
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:08,000
The person who runs it nicely describes it as

299
0:15:08,000 --> 0:15:12,000
"machines that make machines need businesses that make businesses:"

300
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:15,000
it's a cross between micro-finance and VC to do fan-out,

301
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and then the research partnerships back at MIT for what's

302
0:15:17,000 --> 0:15:2,000
making it possible.

303
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:22,000
So I'd like to leave you with two thoughts.

304
0:15:22,000 --> 0:15:27,000
There's been a sea change in aid, from top-down mega-projects

305
0:15:27,000 --> 0:15:31,000
to bottom-up, grassroots, micro-finance investing in the roots,

306
0:15:31,000 --> 0:15:34,000
so that everybody's got that that's what works.

307
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:37,000
But we still look at technology as top-down mega-projects.

308
0:15:37,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Computing, communication, energy for the rest of the planet

309
0:15:4,000 --> 0:15:42,000
are these top-down mega-projects.

310
0:15:42,000 --> 0:15:44,000
If this room full of heroes is just clever enough,

311
0:15:44,000 --> 0:15:46,000
you can solve the problems.

312
0:15:46,000 --> 0:15:48,000
The message coming from the Fab Labs is that

313
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:5,000
the other five billion people on the planet

314
0:15:5,000 --> 0:15:52,000
aren't just technical sinks; they're sources.

315
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:55,000
The real opportunity is to harness the inventive power of the world

316
0:15:55,000 --> 0:15:59,000
to locally design and produce solutions to local problems.

317
0:15:59,000 --> 0:16:02,000
I thought that's the projection 20 years hence into the future,

318
0:16:02,000 --> 0:16:04,000
but it's where we are today.

319
0:16:04,000 --> 0:16:06,000
It breaks every organizational boundary we can think of.

320
0:16:06,000 --> 0:16:09,000
The hardest thing at this point is the social engineering

321
0:16:09,000 --> 0:16:12,000
and the organizational engineering, but it's here today.

322
0:16:12,000 --> 0:16:14,000
And, finally, any talk like this on the future of computing

323
0:16:14,000 --> 0:16:18,000
is required to show Moore's law, but my favorite version --

324
0:16:18,000 --> 0:16:23,000
this is Gordon Moore's original one from his original paper --

325
0:16:23,000 --> 0:16:25,000
and what's happened is, year after year after year,

326
0:16:25,000 --> 0:16:26,000
we've scaled and we've scaled and we've scaled

327
0:16:26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
and we've scaled, and we've scaled and we've scaled,

328
0:16:3,000 --> 0:16:31,000
and we've scaled and we've scaled,

329
0:16:31,000 --> 0:16:33,000
and there's this looming bug of what's going to happen

330
0:16:33,000 --> 0:16:37,000
at the end of Moore's law; this ultimate bug is coming.

331
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:42,000
But we're coming to appreciate, is the transition from 2D to 3D,

332
0:16:42,000 --> 0:16:45,000
from programming bits to programming atoms,

333
0:16:45,000 --> 0:16:47,000
turns the ends of Moore's law scaling from the ultimate bug

334
0:16:47,000 --> 0:16:49,000
to the ultimate feature.

335
0:16:49,000 --> 0:16:53,000
So, we're just at the edge of this digital revolution in fabrication,

336
0:16:53,000 --> 0:16:56,000
where the output of computation programs the physical world.

337
0:16:56,000 --> 0:16:59,000
So, together, these two projects answer questions

338
0:16:59,000 --> 0:17:03,000
I hadn't asked carefully. The class at MIT shows the killer app

339
0:17:03,000 --> 0:17:05,000
for personal fabrication in the developed world

340
0:17:05,000 --> 0:17:09,000
is technology for a market of one: personal expression in technology

341
0:17:09,000 --> 0:17:12,000
that touches a passion unlike anything I've seen in technology

342
0:17:12,000 --> 0:17:14,000
for a very long time.

343
0:17:14,000 --> 0:17:18,000
And the killer app for the rest of the planet is the instrumentation

344
0:17:18,000 --> 0:17:21,000
and the fabrication divide: people locally developing solutions

345
0:17:21,000 --> 0:17:23,000
to local problems. Thank you.

1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm talking to you about

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
the worst form of human rights violation,

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
the third-largest organized crime,

4
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
a $10 billion industry.

5
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I'm talking to you about modern-day slavery.

6
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I'd like to tell you the story

7
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
of these three children,

8
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Pranitha, Shaheen and Anjali.

9
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Pranitha's mother was a woman in prostitution,

10
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
a prostituted person.

11
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
She got infected with HIV,

12
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and towards the end of her life,

13
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
when she was in the final stages of AIDS,

14
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
she could not prostitute,

15
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
so she sold four-year-old Pranitha to a broker.

16
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
By the time we got the information, we reached there,

17
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Pranitha was already raped by three men.

18
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Shaheen's background I don't even know.

19
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
We found her in a railway track,

20
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
raped by many, many men, I don't know many.

21
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
But the indications of that on her body was

22
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that her intestine was outside her body.

23
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And when we took her to the hospital

24
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
she needed 32 stitches to put back her intestine into her body.

25
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
We still don't know who her parents are, who she is.

26
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
All that we know that hundreds of men

27
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
had used her brutally.

28
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Anjali's father, a drunkard,

29
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
sold his child for pornography.

30
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
You're seeing here images of

31
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
three years, four-year-olds, and five-year-old children

32
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
who have been trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation.

33
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
In this country, and across the globe,

34
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
hundreds and thousands of children,

35
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
as young as three, as young as four,

36
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
are sold into sexual slavery.

37
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
But that's not the only purpose that human beings are sold for.

38
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
They are sold in the name of adoption.

39
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
They are sold in the name of organ trade.

40
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
They are sold in the name of forced labor,

41
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
camel jockeying, anything, everything.

42
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation.

43
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And I tell you stories from there.

44
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
My own journey to work with these children

45
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
started as a teenager.

46
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I was 15 when I was gang-raped by eight men.

47
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I don't remember the rape part of it so much

48
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
as much as the anger part of it.

49
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Yes, there were eight men who defiled me, raped me,

50
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
but that didn't go into my consciousness.

51
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I never felt like a victim, then or now.

52
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
But what lingered from then till now -- I am 40 today --

53
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
is this huge outrageous anger.

54
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Two years, I was ostracized, I was stigmatized, I was isolated,

55
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
because I was a victim.

56
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And that's what we do to all traffic survivors.

57
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
We, as a society, we have PhDs

58
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
in victimizing a victim.

59
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Right from the age of 15,

60
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
when I started looking around me,

61
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I started seeing hundreds and thousands of women and children

62
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
who are left in sexual slavery-like practices,

63
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
but have absolutely no respite,

64
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
because we don't allow them to come in.

65
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
Where does their journey begin?

66
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Most of them come from very optionless families,

67
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
not just poor.

68
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
You have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked.

69
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I had this I.S. officer's daughter,

70
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
who is 14 years old, studying in ninth standard,

71
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
who was raped chatting with one individual,

72
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and ran away from home because she wanted to become a heroine,

73
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
who was trafficked.

74
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I have hundreds and thousands of stories of very very well-to-do families,

75
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and children from well-to-do families,

76
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
who are getting trafficked.

77
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
These people are deceived, forced.

78
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
99.9 percent of them

79
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
resist being inducted into prostitution.

80
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Some pay the price for it.

81
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
They're killed; we don't even hear about them.

82
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
They are voiceless, [unclear],

83
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
nameless people.

84
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
But the rest, who succumb into it,

85
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
go through everyday torture.

86
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Because the men who come to them are not men who want to make you your girlfriends,

87
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
or who want to have a family with you.

88
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
These are men who buy you for an hour, for a day,

89
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and use you, throw you.

90
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Each of the girls that I have rescued --

91
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I have rescued more than 3,200 girls --

92
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
each of them tell me one story in common ...

93
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
(Applause)

94
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
one story about one man, at least,

95
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
putting chili powder in her vagina,

96
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
one man taking a cigarette and burning her,

97
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
one man whipping her.

98
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
We are living among those men: they're our brothers, fathers,

99
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
uncles, cousins, all around us.

100
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And we are silent about them.

101
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
We think it is easy money.

102
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
We think it is shortcut.

103
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
We think the person likes to do what she's doing.

104
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
But the extra bonuses that she gets

105
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
is various infections, sexually transmitted infections,

106
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
HIV, AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea, you name it,

107
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
substance abuse, drugs, everything under the sun.

108
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And one day she gives up on you and me,

109
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
because we have no options for her.

110
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation.

111
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
She believes, "Yes, this is it, this is what my destiny is about."

112
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And this is normal, to get raped by 100 men a day.

113
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And it's abnormal to live in a shelter.

114
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
It's abnormal to get rehabilitated.

115
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
It's in that context that I work.

116
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
It's in that context that I rescue children.

117
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
I've rescued children as young as three years,

118
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and I've rescued women as old as 40 years.

119
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
When I rescued them, one of the biggest challenges I had

120
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
was where do I begin.

121
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Because I had lots of them

122
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
who were already HIV infected.

123
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
One third of the people I rescue

124
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
are HIV positive.

125
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And therefore my challenge was to

126
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
understand how can I get out

127
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
the power from this pain.

128
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And for me, I was my greatest experience.

129
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Understanding my own self,

130
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
understanding my own pain,

131
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
my own isolation,

132
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
was my greatest teacher.

133
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Because what we did with these girls

134
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
is to understand their potential.

135
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
You see a girl here who is trained as a welder.

136
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
She works for a very big company,

137
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
a workshop in Hyderabad,

138
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
making furnitures.

139
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
She earns around 12,000 rupees.

140
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
She is an illiterate girl,

141
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
trained, skilled as a welder.

142
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Why welding and why not computers?

143
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
We felt, one of the things that these girls had

144
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
is immense amount of courage.

145
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
They did not have any pardas inside their body,

146
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
hijabs inside themselves;

147
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
they've crossed the barrier of it.

148
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And therefore they could fight in a male-dominated world,

149
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
very easily, and not feel very shy about it.

150
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
We have trained girls as carpenters,

151
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
as masons,

152
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
as security guards, as cab drivers.

153
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And each one of them are excelling

154
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
in their chosen field,

155
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
gaining confidence, restoring dignity,

156
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and building hopes in their own lives.

157
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
These girls are also working in big construction companies

158
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
like Ram-ki construction, as masons, full-time masons.

159
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
What has been my challenge?

160
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
My challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up.

161
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I've been beaten up more than 14 times in my life.

162
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
I can't hear from my right ear.

163
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
I've lost a staff of mine who was murdered

164
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
while on a rescue.

165
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
My biggest challenge

166
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
is society.

167
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
It's you and me.

168
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
My biggest challenge is your blocks to accept these victims

169
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
as our own.

170
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
A very supportive friend of mine,

171
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
a well-wisher of mine,

172
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
used to give me every month, 2,000 rupees for vegetables.

173
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
When her mother fell sick she said,

174
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
"Sunitha, you have so much of contacts.

175
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Can you get somebody in my house to work,

176
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
so that she can look after my mother?"

177
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And there is a long pause.

178
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And then she says, "Not one of our girls."

179
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
It's very fashionable to talk about human trafficking,

180
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
in this fantastic A-C hall.

181
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
It's very nice for discussion, discourse,

182
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
making films and everything.

183
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
But it is not nice to bring them to our homes.

184
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
It's not nice to give them employment in our factories, our companies.

185
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
It's not nice for our children to study with their children.

186
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
There it ends.

187
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
That's my biggest challenge.

188
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
If I'm here today, I'm here not only as Sunitha Krishnan.

189
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
I'm here as a voice of the victims and survivors of human trafficking.

190
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
They need your compassion.

191
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
They need your empathy.

192
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
They need, much more than anything else,

193
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
your acceptance.

194
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Many times when I talk to people,

195
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I keep telling them one thing:

196
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
don't tell me hundred ways

197
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
how you cannot respond to this problem.

198
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Can you ply your mind for that one way

199
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
that you can respond to the problem?

200
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And that's what I'm here for,

201
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
asking for your support,

202
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
demanding for your support,

203
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
requesting for your support.

204
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Can you break your culture of silence?

205
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Can you speak to at least two persons about this story?

206
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Tell them this story. Convince them to tell the story to another two persons.

207
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
I'm not asking you all to become Mahatma Gandhis

208
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
or Martin Luther Kings, or Medha Patkars,

209
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
or something like that.

210
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
I'm asking you, in your limited world,

211
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
can you open your minds? Can you open your hearts?

212
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Can you just encompass these people too?

213
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Because they are also a part of us.

214
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
They are also part of this world.

215
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
I'm asking you, for these children,

216
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
whose faces you see, they're no more.

217
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
They died of AIDS last year.

218
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
I'm asking you to help them,

219
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
accept as human beings --

220
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
not as philanthropy, not as charity,

221
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
but as human beings who deserve all our support.

222
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
I'm asking you this because no child, no human being,

223
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
deserves what these children have gone through.

224
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Thank you.

225
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
(Applause)

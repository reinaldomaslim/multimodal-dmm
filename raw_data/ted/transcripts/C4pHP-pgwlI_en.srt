0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Marco Tempest: What I'd like to show you today

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
is something in the way of an experiment.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Today's its debut.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
It's a demonstration of augmented reality.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And the visuals you're about to see are not prerecorded.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
They are live

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and reacting to me in real time.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I like to think of it as a kind of technological magic.

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
So fingers crossed.

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And keep your eyes on the big screen.

11
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Augmented reality

12
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
is the melding of the real world

13
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
with computer-generated imagery.

14
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
It seems the perfect medium

15
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
to investigate magic

16
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and ask, why, in a technological age,

17
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
we continue to have

18
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
this magical sense of wonder.

19
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Magic is deception,

20
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
but it is a deception we enjoy.

21
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
To enjoy being deceived,

22
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
an audience must first

23
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
suspend its disbelief.

24
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
It was the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge

25
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
who first suggested this receptive state of mind.

26
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Samuel Taylor Coleridge: I try to convey a semblance of truth in my writing

27
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
to produce for these shadows of the imagination

28
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
a willing suspension of disbelief

29
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that, for a moment,

30
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
constitutes poetic faith.

31
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
MT: This faith in the fictional is essential

32
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
for any kind of theatrical experience.

33
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Without it,

34
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
a script is just words.

35
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Augmented reality

36
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
is just the latest technology.

37
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And sleight of hand

38
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
is just an artful demonstration

39
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
of dexterity.

40
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
We are all very good at suspending our disbelief.

41
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
We do it every day,

42
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
while reading novels,

43
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
watching television

44
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
or going to the movies.

45
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
We willingly enter fictional worlds

46
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
where we cheer our heroes

47
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and cry for friends we never had.

48
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Without this ability

49
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
there is no magic.

50
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
It was Jean Robert-Houdin,

51
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
France's greatest illusionist,

52
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
who first recognized the role of the magician

53
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
as a storyteller.

54
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
He said something that I've posted on the wall of my studio.

55
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Jean Robert-Houdin: A conjurer is not a juggler.

56
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
He is an actor playing the part of a magician.

57
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
MT: Which means magic is theater

58
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and every trick

59
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
is a story.

60
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
The tricks of magic

61
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
follow the archetypes of narrative fiction.

62
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
There are tales of creation and loss,

63
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
death and resurrection,

64
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and obstacles that must be overcome.

65
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Now many of them are intensely dramatic.

66
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
Magicians play with fire and steel,

67
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
defy the fury of the buzzsaw,

68
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
dare to catch a bullet

69
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
or attempt a deadly escape.

70
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
But audiences don't come to see the magician die,

71
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
they come to see him live.

72
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Because the best stories

73
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
always have a happy ending.

74
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
The tricks of magic have one special element.

75
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
They are stories with a twist.

76
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Now Edward de Bono argued

77
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that our brains are pattern matching machines.

78
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
He said that magicians deliberately exploit

79
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
the way their audiences think.

80
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Edward de Bono: Stage magic relies almost wholly

81
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
on the momentum error.

82
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
The audience is led to make assumptions or elaborations

83
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that are perfectly reasonable,

84
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
but do not, in fact, match

85
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
what is being done in front of them.

86
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
MT: In that respect,

87
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
magic tricks are like jokes.

88
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Jokes lead us down a path

89
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
to an expected destination.

90
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
But when the scenario we have imagined suddenly flips

91
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
into something entirely unexpected,

92
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
we laugh.

93
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
The same thing happens

94
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
when people watch magic tricks.

95
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
The finale

96
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
defies logic,

97
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
gives new insight into the problem,

98
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and audiences express their amazement

99
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
with laughter.

100
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
It's fun to be fooled.

101
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
One of the key qualities of all stories

102
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
is that they're made to be shared.

103
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
We feel compelled to tell them.

104
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
When I do a trick at a party --

105
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
(Laughter)

106
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that person will immediately pull their friend over

107
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and ask me to do it again.

108
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
They want to share the experience.

109
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
That makes my job more difficult,

110
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
because, if I want to surprise them,

111
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I need to tell a story that starts the same,

112
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
but ends differently --

113
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
a trick with a twist

114
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
on a twist.

115
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
It keeps me busy.

116
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Now experts believe

117
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
that stories go beyond our capacity for keeping us entertained.

118
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
We think in narrative structures.

119
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
We connect events and emotions

120
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and instinctively transform them

121
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
into a sequence that can be easily understood.

122
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
It's a uniquely human achievement.

123
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
We all want to share our stories,

124
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
whether it is the trick we saw at the party,

125
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
the bad day at the office

126
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
or the beautiful sunset we saw on vacation.

127
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Today, thanks to technology,

128
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
we can share those stories as never before,

129
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
by email, Facebook,

130
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
blogs, tweets,

131
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
on TED.com.

132
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
The tools of social networking,

133
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
these are the digital campfires

134
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
around which the audience gathers

135
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
to hear our story.

136
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
We turn facts into similes and metaphors,

137
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and even fantasies.

138
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
We polish the rough edges of our lives

139
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
so that they feel whole.

140
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Our stories make us the people we are

141
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and, sometimes, the people we want to be.

142
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
They give us our identity

143
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and a sense of community.

144
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And if the story is a good one,

145
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
it might even make us smile.

146
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Thank you.

147
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
(Applause)

148
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Thank you.

149
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
(Applause)

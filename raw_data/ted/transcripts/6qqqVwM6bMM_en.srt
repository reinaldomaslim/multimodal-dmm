1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'd like to take you to another world.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And I'd like to share

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
a 45 year-old love story

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
with the poor,

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
living on less than one dollar a day.

6
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I went to a very elitist, snobbish,

7
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
expensive education in India,

8
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and that almost destroyed me.

9
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I was all set

10
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
to be a diplomat, teacher, doctor --

11
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
all laid out.

12
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Then, I don't look it, but I was the Indian national squash champion

13
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
for three years.

14
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
(Laughter)

15
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
The whole world was laid out for me.

16
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Everything was at my feet.

17
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I could do nothing wrong.

18
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And then I thought out of curiosity

19
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I'd like to go and live and work

20
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and just see what a village is like.

21
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So in 1965,

22
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I went to what was called the worst Bihar famine in India,

23
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and I saw starvation, death,

24
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
people dying of hunger, for the first time.

25
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
It changed my life.

26
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I came back home,

27
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
told my mother,

28
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
"I'd like to live and work in a village."

29
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Mother went into a coma.

30
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
"What is this?

32
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
The whole world is laid out for you, the best jobs are laid out for you,

33
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and you want to go and work in a village?

34
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I mean, is there something wrong with you?"

35
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I said, "No, I've got the best eduction.

36
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
It made me think.

37
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And I wanted to give something back

38
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
in my own way."

39
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
"What do you want to do in a village?

40
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
No job, no money,

41
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
no security, no prospect."

42
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I said, "I want to live

43
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and dig wells for five years."

44
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
"Dig wells for five years?

45
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
You went to the most expensive school and college in India,

46
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and you want to dig wells for five years?"

47
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
She didn't speak to me for a very long time,

48
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
because she thought I'd let my family down.

49
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
But then,

50
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills

51
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
that very poor people have,

52
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
which are never brought into the mainstream --

53
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
which is never identified, respected,

54
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
applied on a large scale.

55
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And I thought I'd start a Barefoot College --

56
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
college only for the poor.

57
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
What the poor thought was important

58
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
would be reflected in the college.

59
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I went to this village for the first time.

60
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Elders came to me

61
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and said, "Are you running from the police?"

62
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
I said, "No."

63
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
(Laughter)

64
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
"You failed in your exam?"

65
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I said, "No."

66
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
"You didn't get a government job?" I said, "No."

67
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
"What are you doing here?

68
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Why are you here?

69
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
The education system in India

70
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
makes you look at Paris and New Delhi and Zurich;

71
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
what are you doing in this village?

72
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Is there something wrong with you you're not telling us?"

73
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I said, "No, I want to actually start a college

74
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
only for the poor.

75
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college."

76
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice.

77
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
They said, "Please,

78
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
don't bring anyone with a degree and qualification

79
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
into your college."

80
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So it's the only college in India

81
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
where, if you should have a Ph.D. or a Master's,

82
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
you are disqualified to come.

83
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
You have to be a cop-out or a wash-out or a dropout

84
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
to come to our college.

85
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
You have to work with your hands.

86
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
You have to have a dignity of labor.

87
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
You have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community

88
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and provide a service to the community.

89
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So we started the Barefoot College,

90
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and we redefined professionalism.

91
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Who is a professional?

92
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
A professional is someone

93
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
who has a combination of competence,

94
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
confidence and belief.

95
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
A water diviner is a professional.

96
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
A traditional midwife

97
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
is a professional.

98
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
A traditional bone setter is a professional.

99
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
These are professionals all over the world.

100
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
You find them in any inaccessible village around the world.

101
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And we thought that these people should come into the mainstream

102
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and show that the knowledge and skills that they have

103
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
is universal.

104
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
It needs to be used, needs to be applied,

105
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
needs to be shown to the world outside --

106
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that these knowledge and skills

107
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
are relevant even today.

108
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
So the college works

109
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
following the lifestyle and workstyle of Mahatma Gandhi.

110
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
You eat on the floor, you sleep on the floor, you work on the floor.

111
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
There are no contracts, no written contracts.

112
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
You can stay with me for 20 years, go tomorrow.

113
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And no one can get more than $100 a month.

114
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
You come for the money, you don't come to Barefoot College.

115
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
You come for the work and the challenge,

116
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
you'll come to the Barefoot College.

117
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
That is where we want you to try crazy ideas.

118
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Whatever idea you have, come and try it.

119
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
It doesn't matter if you fail.

120
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Battered, bruised, you start again.

121
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
It's the only college where the teacher is the learner

122
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and the learner is the teacher.

123
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And it's the only college where we don't give a certificate.

124
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
You are certified by the community you serve.

125
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
You don't need a paper to hang on the wall

126
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
to show that you are an engineer.

127
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So when I said that,

128
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
they said, "Well show us what is possible. What are you doing?

129
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
This is all mumbo-jumbo if you can't show it on the ground."

130
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
So we built the first Barefoot College

131
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
in 1986.

132
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
It was built by 12 Barefoot architects

133
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
who can't read and write,

134
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
built on $1.50 a sq. ft.

135
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
150 people lived there, worked there.

136
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
They got the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2002.

137
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
But then they suspected, they thought there was an architect behind it.

138
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I said, "Yes, they made the blueprints,

139
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
but the Barefoot architects actually constructed the college."

140
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
We are the only ones who actually returned the award for $50,000,

141
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
because they didn't believe us,

142
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and we thought that they were actually casting aspersions

143
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
on the Barefoot architects of Tilonia.

144
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
I asked a forester --

145
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
high-powered, paper-qualified expert --

146
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I said, "What can you build in this place?"

147
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
He had one look at the soil and said, "Forget it. No way.

148
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Not even worth it.

149
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
No water, rocky soil."

150
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I was in a bit of a spot.

151
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And I said, "Okay, I'll go to the old man in village

152
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and say, 'What should I grow in this spot?'"

153
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
He looked quietly at me and said,

154
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
"You build this, you build this, you put this, and it'll work."

155
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
This is what it looks like today.

156
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Went to the roof,

157
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and all the women said, "Clear out.

158
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
The men should clear out because we don't want to share this technology with the men.

159
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
This is waterproofing the roof."

160
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
(Laughter)

161
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
It is a bit of jaggery, a bit of urens

162
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and a bit of other things I don't know.

163
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
But it actually doesn't leak.

164
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Since 1986, it hasn't leaked.

165
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
This technology, the women will not share with the men.

166
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
(Laughter)

167
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
It's the only college

168
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
which is fully solar-electrified.

169
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
All the power comes from the sun.

170
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
45 kilowatts of panels on the roof.

171
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And everything works off the sun for the next 25 years.

172
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So long as the sun shines,

173
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
we'll have no problem with power.

174
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
But the beauty is

175
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
that is was installed

176
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
by a priest, a Hindu priest,

177
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
who's only done eight years of primary schooling --

178
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
never been to school, never been to college.

179
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
He knows more about solar

180
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
than anyone I know anywhere in the world guaranteed.

181
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Food, if you come to the Barefoot College,

182
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
is solar cooked.

183
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
But the people who fabricated that solar cooker

184
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
are women,

185
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
illiterate women,

186
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
who actually fabricate

187
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
the most sophisticated solar cooker.

188
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
It's a parabolic Scheffler solar cooker.

189
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Unfortunately, they're almost half German,

190
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
they're so precise.

191
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
(Laughter)

192
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
You'll never find Indian women so precise.

193
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Absolutely to the last inch,

194
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
they can make that cooker.

195
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And we have 60 meals twice a day

196
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
of solar cooking.

197
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
We have a dentist --

198
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
she's a grandmother, illiterate, who's a dentist.

199
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
She actually looks after the teeth

200
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
of 7,000 children.

201
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Barefoot technology:

202
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
this was 1986 -- no engineer, no architect thought of it --

203
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
but we are collecting rainwater from the roofs.

204
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Very little water is wasted.

205
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
All the roofs are connected underground

206
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
to a 400,000 liter tank,

207
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and no water is wasted.

208
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
If we have four years of drought, we still have water on the campus,

209
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
because we collect rainwater.

210
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
60 percent of children don't go to school,

211
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
because they have to look after animals --

212
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
sheep, goats --

213
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
domestic chores.

214
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So we thought of starting a school

215
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
at night for the children.

216
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Because the night schools of Tilonia,

217
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
over 75,000 children have gone through these night schools.

218
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Because it's for the convenience of the child;

219
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
it's not for the convenience of the teacher.

220
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And what do we teach in these schools?

221
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Democracy, citizenship,

222
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
how you should measure your land,

223
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
what you should do if you're arrested,

224
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
what you should do if your animal is sick.

225
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
This is what we teach in the night schools.

226
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
But all the schools are solar-lit.

227
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Every five years

228
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
we have an election.

229
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Between six to 14 year-old children

230
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
participate in a democratic process,

231
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and they elect a prime minister.

232
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
The prime minister is 12 years old.

233
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
She looks after 20 goats in the morning,

234
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
but she's prime minister in the evening.

235
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
She has a cabinet,

236
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
a minister of education, a minister for energy, a minister for health.

237
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And they actually monitor and supervise

238
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
150 schools for 7,000 children.

239
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
She got the World's Children's Prize five years ago,

240
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and she went to Sweden.

241
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
First time ever going out of her village.

242
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Never seen Sweden.

243
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
Wasn't dazzled at all by what was happening.

244
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And the Queen of Sweden, who's there,

245
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
turned to me and said, "Can you ask this child where she got her confidence from?

246
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
She's only 12 years old,

247
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and she's not dazzled by anything."

248
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And the girl, who's on her left,

249
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
turned to me and looked at the queen straight in the eye

250
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and said, "Please tell her I'm the prime minister."

251
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
(Laughter)

252
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
(Applause)

253
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Where the percentage of illiteracy is very high,

254
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
we use puppetry.

255
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Puppets is the way we communicate.

256
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
You have Jokhim Chacha

257
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
who is 300 years old.

258
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
He is my psychoanalyst. He is my teacher.

259
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
He's my doctor. He's my lawyer.

260
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
He's my donor.

261
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
He actually raises money,

262
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
solves my disputes.

263
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
He solves my problems in the village.

264
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
If there's tension in the village,

265
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
if attendance at the schools goes down

266
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and there's a friction between the teacher and the parent,

267
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
the puppet calls the teacher and the parent in front of the whole village

268
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and says, "Shake hands.

269
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
The attendance must not drop."

270
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
These puppets

271
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
are made out of recycled World Bank reports.

272
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
(Laughter)

273
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
(Applause)

274
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
So this decentralized, demystified approach

275
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
of solar-electrifying villages,

276
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
we've covered all over India

277
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
from Ladakh up to Bhutan --

278
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
all solar-electrified villages

279
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
by people who have been trained.

280
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And we went to Ladakh,

281
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and we asked this woman --

282
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
this, at minus 40, you have to come out of the roof,

283
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
because there's no place, it was all snowed up on both sides --

284
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and we asked this woman,

285
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
"What was the benefit you had

286
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
from solar electricity?"

287
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And she thought for a minute and said,

288
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
"It's the first time I can see my husband's face in winter."

289
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
(Laughter)

290
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Went to Afghanistan.

291
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
One lesson we learned in India

292
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
was men are untrainable.

293
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
(Laughter)

294
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Men are restless,

295
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
men are ambitious,

296
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
men are compulsively mobile,

297
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and they all want a certificate.

298
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
(Laughter)

299
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
All across the globe, you have this tendency

300
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
of men wanting a certificate.

301
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Why? Because they want to leave the village

302
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and go to a city, looking for a job.

303
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
So we came up with a great solution:

304
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
train grandmothers.

305
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
What's the best way of communicating

306
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
in the world today?

307
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Television? No.

308
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Telegraph? No.

309
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Telephone? No.

310
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Tell a woman.

311
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
(Laughter)

312
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
(Applause)

313
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
So we went to Afghanistan for the first time,

314
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and we picked three women

315
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and said, "We want to take them to India."

316
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
They said, "Impossible. They don't even go out of their rooms,

317
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and you want to take them to India."

318
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
I said, "I'll make a concession. I'll take the husbands along as well."

319
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
So I took the husbands along.

320
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Of course, the women were much more intelligent than the men.

321
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
In six months,

322
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
how do we train these women?

323
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Sign language.

324
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
You don't choose the written word.

325
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
You don't choose the spoken word.

326
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
You use sign language.

327
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
And in six months

328
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
they can become solar engineers.

329
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
They go back and solar-electrify their own village.

330
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
This woman went back

331
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and solar-electrified the first village,

332
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
set up a workshop --

333
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
the first village ever to be solar-electrified in Afghanistan

334
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
[was] by the three women.

335
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
This woman

336
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
is an extraordinary grandmother.

337
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
55 years old, and she's solar-electrified 200 houses for me in Afghanistan.

338
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
And they haven't collapsed.

339
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
She actually went and spoke to an engineering department in Afghanistan

340
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and told the head of the department

341
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
the difference between AC and DC.

342
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
He didn't know.

343
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Those three women have trained 27 more women

344
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and solar-electrified 100 villages in Afghanistan.

345
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
We went to Africa,

346
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and we did the same thing.

347
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
All these women sitting at one table from eight, nine countries,

348
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
all chatting to each other, not understanding a word,

349
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
because they're all speaking a different language.

350
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
But their body language is great.

351
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
They're speaking to each other

352
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
and actually becoming solar engineers.

353
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
I went to Sierra Leone,

354
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
and there was this minister driving down in the dead of night --

355
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
comes across this village.

356
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Comes back, goes into the village, says, "Well what's the story?"

357
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
They said, "These two grandmothers ... "

358
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
"Grandmothers?" The minister couldn't believe what was happening.

359
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
"Where did they go?" "Went to India and back."

360
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Went straight to the president.

361
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
He said, "Do you know there's a solar-electrified village in Sierra Leone?"

362
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
He said, "No." Half the cabinet went to see the grandmothers the next day.

363
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
"What's the story."

364
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
So he summoned me and said, "Can you train me 150 grandmothers?"

365
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
I said, "I can't, Mr. President.

366
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
But they will. The grandmothers will."

367
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
So he built me the first Barefoot training center in Sierra Leone.

368
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
And 150 grandmothers have been trained in Sierra Leone.

369
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Gambia:

370
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
we went to select a grandmother in Gambia.

371
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
Went to this village.

372
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
I knew which woman I would like to take.

373
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
The community got together and said, "Take these two women."

374
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
I said, "No, I want to take this woman."

375
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
They said, "Why? She doesn't know the language. You don't know her."

376
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
I said, "I like the body language. I like the way she speaks."

377
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
"Difficult husband; not possible."

378
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
Called the husband, the husband came,

379
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
swaggering, politician, mobile in his hand. "Not possible."

380
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
"Why not?" "The woman, look how beautiful she is."

381
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
I said, "Yeah, she is very beautiful."

382
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
"What happens if she runs off with an Indian man?"

383
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
That was his biggest fear.

384
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
I said, "She'll be happy. She'll ring you up on the mobile."

385
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
She went like a grandmother

386
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
and came back like a tiger.

387
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
She walked out of the plane

388
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
and spoke to the whole press as if she was a veteran.

389
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
She handled the national press,

390
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
and she was a star.

391
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
And when I went back six months later, I said, "Where's your husband?"

392
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
"Oh, somewhere. It doesn't matter."

393
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
(Laughter)

394
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
Success story.

395
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
(Laughter)

396
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
(Applause)

397
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
I'll just wind up by saying

398
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
that I think you don't have to look for solutions outside.

399
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
Look for solutions within.

400
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
And listen to people. They have the solutions in front of you.

401
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
They're all over the world.

402
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
Don't even worry.

403
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
Don't listen to the World Bank, listen to the people on the ground.

404
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:17,000
They have all the solutions in the world.

405
0:18:17.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
I'll end with a quotation by Mahatma Gandhi.

406
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
"First they ignore you,

407
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:24,000
then they laugh at you,

408
0:18:24.26,000 --> 0:18:26,000
then they fight you,

409
0:18:26.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
and then you win."

410
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
Thank you.

411
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:19:01,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
The Highline

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
is an old, elevated rail line

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
that runs for a mile and a half right through Manhattan.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And it was originally a freight line

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that ran down 10th Ave.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And it became known as "Death Avenue"

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
because so many people were run over by the trains

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
that the railroad hired a guy on horseback to run in front,

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and he became known as the "West Side Cowboy."

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
But even with a cowboy,

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
about one person a month

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
was killed and run over.

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So they elevated it.

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
They built it 30 ft. in the air, right through the middle of the city.

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
But with the rise of interstate trucking,

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
it was used less and less.

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And by 1980, the last train rode.

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It was a train loaded with frozen turkeys -- they say, at Thanksgiving --

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
from the meatpacking district.

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
And then it was abandoned.

21
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And I live in the neighborhood,

22
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and I first read about it in the New York Times,

23
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
in an article that said it was going to be demolished.

24
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And I assumed someone was working

25
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
to preserve it or save it

26
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and I could volunteer,

27
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
but I realized no one was doing anything.

28
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I went to my first community board meeting --

29
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
which I'd never been to one before --

30
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and sat next to another guy named Joshua David,

31
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
who's a travel writer.

32
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And at the end of the meeting, we realized

33
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
we were the only two people that were sort of interested in the project;

34
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
most people wanted to tear it down.

35
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So we exchanged business cards,

36
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and we kept calling each other

37
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and decided to start this organization,

38
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Friends of the High Line.

39
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And the goal at first

40
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
was just saving it from demolition,

41
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
but then we also wanted to figure out what we could do with it.

42
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And what first attracted me, or interested me,

43
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
was this view from the street --

44
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
which is this steel structure,

45
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
sort of rusty,

46
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
this industrial relic.

47
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
But when I went up on top,

48
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
it was a mile and a half of wildflowers

49
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
running right through the middle of Manhattan

50
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
with views of the Empire State Building

51
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and the Statue of Liberty and the Hudson River.

52
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And that's really where we started,

53
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
the idea coalesced around, let's make this a park,

54
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and let's have it be sort of inspired

55
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
by this wildscape.

56
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
At the time, there was a lot of opposition.

57
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Mayor Giuliani wanted to tear it down.

58
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I'm going to fast-forward through a lot of lawsuits

59
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and a lot of community engagement.

60
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Mayor Bloomberg came in office, he was very supportive,

61
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
but we still had to make the economic case.

62
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
This was after 9/11;

63
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
the city was in tough times.

64
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So we commissioned an economic feasibility study

65
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
to try to make the case.

66
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And it turns out, we got those numbers wrong.

67
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
We thought it would cost 100 million dollars to build.

68
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So far it's cost about 150 million.

69
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And the main case was,

70
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
this is going to make good economic sense for the city.

71
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So we said over a 20-year time period,

72
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
the value to the city in increased property values

73
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and increased taxes

74
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
would be about 250 million.

75
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
That was enough. It really got the city behind it.

76
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
It turns out we were wrong on that.

77
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Now people estimate it's created about a half a billion dollars,

78
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
or will create about a half a billion dollars,

79
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
in tax revenues for the city.

80
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
We did a design competition,

81
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
selected a design team.

82
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
We worked with them to really create a design

83
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that was inspired by that wildscape.

84
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
There's three sections.

85
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
We opened the fist section in 2009.

86
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It's been successful beyond our dreams.

87
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Last year we had about two million people,

88
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
which is about 10 times what we ever estimated.

89
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
This is one of my favorite features in section one.

90
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
It's this amphitheater right over 10th Ave.

91
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And the first section ends at 20th St. right now.

92
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
The other thing, it's generated, obviously, a lot of economic value;

93
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
it's also inspired, I think, a lot of great architecture.

94
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
There's a point, you can stand here

95
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and see buildings by Frank Gehry,

96
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Jean Nouvel, Shigeru Ban,

97
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Neil Denari.

98
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And the Whitney is moving downtown

99
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and is building their new museum right at the base of the High Line.

100
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And this has been designed by Renzo Piano.

101
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And they're going to break ground in May.

102
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And we've already started construction on section two.

103
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
This is one of my favorite features,

104
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
this flyover where you're eight feet

105
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
off the surface of the High Line,

106
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
running through a canopy of trees.

107
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
The High Line used to be covered in billboards,

108
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and so we've taken a playful take

109
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
where, instead of framing advertisements,

110
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
it's going to frame people in views of the city.

111
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
This was just installed last month.

112
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And then the last section was going to go around the rail yards,

113
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
which is the largest undeveloped site

114
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
in Manhattan.

115
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And the city has planned -- for better or for worse --

116
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
12 million square-feet of development

117
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that the High Line is going to ring around.

118
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
But what really, I think, makes the High Line special

119
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
is the people.

120
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And honestly, even though I love the designs that we were building,

121
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I was always frightened that I wouldn't really love it,

122
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
because I fell in love with that wildscape --

123
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and how could you recreate that magic?

124
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
But what I found

125
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
is it's in the people and how they use it

126
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that, to me, makes it so special.

127
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Just one quick example

128
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
is I realized right after we opened

129
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
that there were all these people holding hands on the High Line.

130
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And I realized New Yorkers don't hold hands;

131
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
we just don't do that outside.

132
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
But you see that happening on the High Line,

133
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and I think that's the power

134
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
that public space can have

135
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
to transform how people experience their city

136
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and interact with each other.

137
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Thanks.

138
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
(Applause)

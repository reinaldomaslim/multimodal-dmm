1
0:00:13.089,000 --> 0:00:16,000
We humans have always been very concerned about the health of our bodies,

2
0:00:17.069,000 --> 0:00:21,000
but we haven't always been that good at figuring out what's important.

3
0:00:21.285,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Take the ancient Egyptians, for example:

4
0:00:23.677,000 --> 0:00:26,000
very concerned about the body parts they thought they'd need in the afterlife,

5
0:00:27.624,000 --> 0:00:29,000
but they left some parts out.

6
0:00:29.714,000 --> 0:00:31,000
This part, for example.

7
0:00:32.337,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Although they very carefully preserved the stomach, the lungs,

8
0:00:35.334,000 --> 0:00:36,000
the liver, and so forth,

9
0:00:36.499,000 --> 0:00:39,000
they just mushed up the brain, drained it out through the nose,

10
0:00:39.535,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and threw it away,

11
0:00:41.259,000 --> 0:00:42,000
which makes sense, really,

12
0:00:42.6,000 --> 0:00:44,000
because what does a brain do for us anyway?

13
0:00:45.439,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But imagine if there were a kind of neglected organ in our bodies

14
0:00:48.637,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that weighed just as much as the brain

15
0:00:50.773,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and in some ways was just as important to who we are,

16
0:00:53.699,000 --> 0:00:56,000
but we knew so little about and treated with such disregard.

17
0:00:57.251,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And imagine if, through new scientific advances,

18
0:01:00.154,000 --> 0:01:01,000
we were just beginning to understand

19
0:01:01.895,000 --> 0:01:03,000
its importance to how we think of ourselves.

20
0:01:04.797,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Wouldn't you want to know more about it?

21
0:01:07.003,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Well, it turns out that we do have something just like that:

22
0:01:10.959,000 --> 0:01:11,000
our gut,

23
0:01:12.641,000 --> 0:01:14,000
or rather, its microbes.

24
0:01:15.303,000 --> 0:01:17,000
But it's not just the microbes in our gut that are important.

25
0:01:18.196,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Microbes all over our body

26
0:01:19.704,000 --> 0:01:21,000
turn out to be really critical to a whole range of differences

27
0:01:22.617,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that make different people who we are.

28
0:01:25.114,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So for example, have you ever noticed

29
0:01:27.428,000 --> 0:01:31,000
how some people get bitten by mosquitos way more often than others?

30
0:01:31.611,000 --> 0:01:35,000
It turns out that everyone's anecdotal experience out camping is actually true.

31
0:01:36.19,000 --> 0:01:38,000
For example, I seldom get bitten by mosquitos,

32
0:01:38.999,000 --> 0:01:4,000
but my partner Amanda attracts them in droves,

33
0:01:41.276,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and the reason why is that we have different microbes on our skin

34
0:01:44.339,000 --> 0:01:47,000
that produce different chemicals that the mosquitos detect.

35
0:01:48.061,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Now, microbes are also really important in the field of medicine.

36
0:01:51.567,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So, for example, what microbes you have in your gut

37
0:01:54.032,000 --> 0:01:58,000
determine whether particular painkillers are toxic to your liver.

38
0:01:58.494,000 --> 0:02:02,000
They also determine whether or not other drugs will work for your heart condition.

39
0:02:02.739,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And, if you're a fruit fly, at least,

40
0:02:05.426,000 --> 0:02:08,000
your microbes determine who you want to have sex with.

41
0:02:08.608,000 --> 0:02:1,000
We haven't demonstrated this in humans yet

42
0:02:10.767,000 --> 0:02:14,000
but maybe it's just a matter of time before we find out. (Laughter)

43
0:02:15.063,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So microbes are performing a huge range of functions.

44
0:02:17.686,000 --> 0:02:18,000
They help us digest our food.

45
0:02:19.452,000 --> 0:02:21,000
They help educate our immune system.

46
0:02:21.726,000 --> 0:02:22,000
They help us resist disease,

47
0:02:23.676,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and they may even be affecting our behavior.

48
0:02:26.184,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So what would a map of all these microbial communities look like?

49
0:02:30.131,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Well, it wouldn't look exactly like this,

50
0:02:32.407,000 --> 0:02:34,000
but it's a helpful guide for understanding biodiversity.

51
0:02:35.286,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Different parts of the world have different landscapes of organisms

52
0:02:39.21,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that are immediately characteristic of one place or another

53
0:02:43.781,000 --> 0:02:45,000
or another.

54
0:02:45.818,000 --> 0:02:48,000
With microbiology, it's kind of the same, although I've got to be honest with you:

55
0:02:49.683,000 --> 0:02:52,000
All the microbes essentially look the same under a microscope.

56
0:02:52.786,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So instead of trying to identify them visually,

57
0:02:55.315,000 --> 0:02:57,000
what we do is we look at their DNA sequences,

58
0:02:57.801,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and in a project called the Human Microbiome Project,

59
0:03:00.725,000 --> 0:03:03,000
NIH funded this $173 million project

60
0:03:04.064,000 --> 0:03:06,000
where hundreds of researchers came together

61
0:03:06.473,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to map out all the A's, T's, G's, and C's,

62
0:03:09.252,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and all of these microbes in the human body.

63
0:03:11.428,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So when we take them together, they look like this.

64
0:03:14.789,000 --> 0:03:17,000
It's a bit more difficult to tell who lives where now, isn't it?

65
0:03:18.72,000 --> 0:03:21,000
What my lab does is develop computational techniques that allow us

66
0:03:22.268,000 --> 0:03:24,000
to take all these terabytes of sequence data

67
0:03:24.879,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and turn them into something that's a bit more useful as a map,

68
0:03:27.892,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and so when we do that with the human microbiome data

69
0:03:30.645,000 --> 0:03:32,000
from 250 healthy volunteers,

70
0:03:32.74,000 --> 0:03:34,000
it looks like this.

71
0:03:35.384,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Each point here represents all the complex microbes

72
0:03:38.564,000 --> 0:03:4,000
in an entire microbial community.

73
0:03:40.747,000 --> 0:03:42,000
See, I told you they basically all look the same.

74
0:03:43.077,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So what we're looking at is each point represents one microbial community

75
0:03:46.966,000 --> 0:03:48,000
from one body site of one healthy volunteer.

76
0:03:49.226,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And so you can see that there's different parts of the map in different colors,

77
0:03:53.022,000 --> 0:03:54,000
almost like separate continents.

78
0:03:54.821,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And what it turns out to be

79
0:03:56.279,000 --> 0:03:58,000
is that those, as the different regions of the body,

80
0:03:58.719,000 --> 0:04:,000
have very different microbes in them.

81
0:04:00.797,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So what we have is we have the oral community up there in green.

82
0:04:04.48,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Over on the other side, we have the skin community in blue,

83
0:04:07.294,000 --> 0:04:09,000
the vaginal community in purple,

84
0:04:09.581,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and then right down at the bottom, we have the fecal community in brown.

85
0:04:13.416,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And we've just over the last few years

86
0:04:15.299,000 --> 0:04:17,000
found out that the microbes in different parts of the body

87
0:04:18.098,000 --> 0:04:2,000
are amazingly different from one another.

88
0:04:20.296,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So if I look at just one person's microbes

89
0:04:23.128,000 --> 0:04:25,000
in the mouth and in the gut,

90
0:04:25.242,000 --> 0:04:28,000
it turns out that the difference between those two microbial communities

91
0:04:28.702,000 --> 0:04:29,000
is enormous.

92
0:04:30.233,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It's bigger than the difference between the microbes in this reef

93
0:04:33.398,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and the microbes in this prairie.

94
0:04:36.131,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So this is incredible when you think about it.

95
0:04:38.662,000 --> 0:04:41,000
What it means is that a few feet of difference in the human body

96
0:04:42.028,000 --> 0:04:44,000
makes more of a difference to your microbial ecology

97
0:04:44.722,000 --> 0:04:46,000
than hundreds of miles on Earth.

98
0:04:46.967,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And this is not to say that two people look basically the same

99
0:04:49.987,000 --> 0:04:5,000
in the same body habitat, either.

100
0:04:51.839,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So you probably heard

101
0:04:53.445,000 --> 0:04:56,000
that we're pretty much all the same in terms of our human DNA.

102
0:04:56.453,000 --> 0:05:,000
You're 99.99 percent identical in terms of your human DNA

103
0:05:00.542,000 --> 0:05:01,000
to the person sitting next to you.

104
0:05:02.409,000 --> 0:05:04,000
But that's not true of your gut microbes:

105
0:05:04.651,000 --> 0:05:06,000
you might only share 10 percent similarity

106
0:05:07.138,000 --> 0:05:1,000
with the person sitting next to you in terms of your gut microbes.

107
0:05:10.648,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So that's as different as the bacteria on this prairie

108
0:05:13.444,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and the bacteria in this forest.

109
0:05:16.46,000 --> 0:05:17,000
So these different microbes

110
0:05:17.909,000 --> 0:05:2,000
have all these different kinds of functions that I told you about,

111
0:05:21.076,000 --> 0:05:22,000
everything from digesting food

112
0:05:22.772,000 --> 0:05:24,000
to involvement in different kinds of diseases,

113
0:05:25.327,000 --> 0:05:26,000
metabolizing drugs, and so forth.

114
0:05:27.193,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So how do they do all this stuff?

115
0:05:29.299,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Well, in part it's because

116
0:05:31.195,000 --> 0:05:34,000
although there's just three pounds of those microbes in our gut,

117
0:05:34.525,000 --> 0:05:35,000
they really outnumber us.

118
0:05:36.285,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And so how much do they outnumber us?

119
0:05:38.505,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Well, it depends on what you think of as our bodies.

120
0:05:41.617,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Is it our cells?

121
0:05:43.102,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Well, each of us consists of about 10 trillion human cells,

122
0:05:46.515,000 --> 0:05:49,000
but we harbor as many as 100 trillion microbial cells.

123
0:05:49.746,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So they outnumber us 10 to one.

124
0:05:52.52,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Now, you might think, well, we're human because of our DNA,

125
0:05:56.431,000 --> 0:05:59,000
but it turns out that each of us has about 20,000 human genes,

126
0:05:59.752,000 --> 0:06:,000
depending on what you count exactly,

127
0:06:01.708,000 --> 0:06:05,000
but as many as two million to 20 million microbial genes.

128
0:06:06.2,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So whichever way we look at it, we're vastly outnumbered

129
0:06:08.959,000 --> 0:06:1,000
by our microbial symbionts.

130
0:06:11.791,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And it turns out that in addition to traces of our human DNA,

131
0:06:15.018,000 --> 0:06:17,000
we also leave traces of our microbial DNA

132
0:06:17.245,000 --> 0:06:18,000
on everything we touch.

133
0:06:19.025,000 --> 0:06:2,000
We showed in a study a few years ago

134
0:06:20.817,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that you can actually match the palm of someone's hand up

135
0:06:23.612,000 --> 0:06:25,000
to the computer mouse that they use routinely

136
0:06:25.889,000 --> 0:06:27,000
with up to 95 percent accuracy.

137
0:06:28.186,000 --> 0:06:3,000
So this came out in a scientific journal a few years ago,

138
0:06:31.042,000 --> 0:06:33,000
but more importantly, it was featured on "CSI: Miami,"

139
0:06:33.595,000 --> 0:06:34,000
so you really know it's true.

140
0:06:35.382,000 --> 0:06:36,000
(Laughter)

141
0:06:36.977,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So where do our microbes come from in the first place?

142
0:06:40.374,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Well if, as I do, you have dogs or kids,

143
0:06:43.021,000 --> 0:06:45,000
you probably have some dark suspicions about that,

144
0:06:45.384,000 --> 0:06:46,000
all of which are true, by the way.

145
0:06:47.363,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So just like we can match you to your computer equipment

146
0:06:50.121,000 --> 0:06:51,000
by the microbes you share,

147
0:06:51.824,000 --> 0:06:53,000
we can also match you up to your dog.

148
0:06:54.032,000 --> 0:06:56,000
But it turns out that in adults,

149
0:06:56.139,000 --> 0:06:58,000
microbial communities are relatively stable,

150
0:06:58.438,000 --> 0:07:,000
so even if you live together with someone,

151
0:07:00.572,000 --> 0:07:02,000
you'll maintain your separate microbial identity

152
0:07:02.97,000 --> 0:07:05,000
over a period of weeks, months, even years.

153
0:07:05.984,000 --> 0:07:07,000
It turns out that our first microbial communities

154
0:07:08.875,000 --> 0:07:1,000
depend a lot on how we're born.

155
0:07:11.025,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So babies that come out the regular way,

156
0:07:13.206,000 --> 0:07:16,000
all of their microbes are basically like the vaginal community,

157
0:07:16.266,000 --> 0:07:18,000
whereas babies that are delivered by C-section,

158
0:07:18.631,000 --> 0:07:2,000
all of their microbes instead look like skin.

159
0:07:21.537,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And this might be associated with some of the differences

160
0:07:24.574,000 --> 0:07:26,000
in health associated with Cesarean birth,

161
0:07:27.362,000 --> 0:07:3,000
such as more asthma, more allergies, even more obesity,

162
0:07:30.578,000 --> 0:07:32,000
all of which have been linked to microbes now,

163
0:07:33.108,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and when you think about it, until recently, every surviving mammal

164
0:07:37.005,000 --> 0:07:39,000
had been delivered by the birth canal,

165
0:07:39.561,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and so the lack of those protective microbes

166
0:07:41.837,000 --> 0:07:43,000
that we've co-evolved with might be really important

167
0:07:44.287,000 --> 0:07:48,000
for a lot of these different conditions that we now know involve the microbiome.

168
0:07:48.796,000 --> 0:07:5,000
When my own daughter was born a couple of years ago

169
0:07:51.533,000 --> 0:07:53,000
by emergency C-section,

170
0:07:53.968,000 --> 0:07:54,000
we took matters into our own hands

171
0:07:55.809,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and made sure she was coated with those vaginal microbes

172
0:07:58.489,000 --> 0:08:,000
that she would have gotten naturally.

173
0:08:00.529,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Now, it's really difficult to tell whether this has had an effect

174
0:08:03.913,000 --> 0:08:05,000
on her health specifically, right?

175
0:08:05.915,000 --> 0:08:08,000
With a sample size of just one child, no matter how much we love her,

176
0:08:09.596,000 --> 0:08:11,000
you don't really have enough of a sample size

177
0:08:11.813,000 --> 0:08:12,000
to figure out what happens on average,

178
0:08:13.759,000 --> 0:08:15,000
but at two years old, she hasn't had an ear infection yet,

179
0:08:16.656,000 --> 0:08:18,000
so we're keeping our fingers crossed on that one.

180
0:08:18.941,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And what's more, we're starting to do clinical trials with more children

181
0:08:22.398,000 --> 0:08:24,000
to figure out whether this has a protective effect generally.

182
0:08:27.031,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So how we're born has a tremendous effect on what microbes we have initially,

183
0:08:32.354,000 --> 0:08:33,000
but where do we go after that?

184
0:08:34.271,000 --> 0:08:36,000
What I'm showing you again here is this map

185
0:08:36.541,000 --> 0:08:37,000
of the Human Microbiome Project Data,

186
0:08:38.539,000 --> 0:08:4,000
so each point represents a sample from one body site

187
0:08:41.302,000 --> 0:08:43,000
from one of 250 healthy adults.

188
0:08:43.842,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And you've seen children develop physically.

189
0:08:45.909,000 --> 0:08:47,000
You've seen them develop mentally.

190
0:08:47.965,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Now, for the first time, you're going to see

191
0:08:50.04,000 --> 0:08:53,000
one of my colleague's children develop microbially.

192
0:08:53.398,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So what we are going to look at

193
0:08:54.963,000 --> 0:08:56,000
is we're going to look at this one baby's stool,

194
0:08:57.65,000 --> 0:08:59,000
the fecal community, which represents the gut,

195
0:09:00.099,000 --> 0:09:03,000
sampled every week for almost two and a half years.

196
0:09:03.268,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And so we're starting on day one.

197
0:09:04.931,000 --> 0:09:07,000
What's going to happen is that the infant is going to start off as this yellow dot,

198
0:09:08.849,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and you can see that he's starting off basically in the vaginal community,

199
0:09:12.329,000 --> 0:09:14,000
as we would expect from his delivery mode.

200
0:09:14.355,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And what's going to happen over these two and a half years

201
0:09:17.069,000 --> 0:09:19,000
is that he's going to travel all the way down

202
0:09:19.211,000 --> 0:09:22,000
to resemble the adult fecal community from healthy volunteers down at the bottom.

203
0:09:23.025,000 --> 0:09:26,000
So I'm just going to start this going and we'll see how that happens.

204
0:09:26.913,000 --> 0:09:3,000
What you can see, and remember each step in this is just one week,

205
0:09:30.949,000 --> 0:09:31,000
what you can see is that week to week,

206
0:09:32.815,000 --> 0:09:36,000
the change in the microbial community of the feces of this one child,

207
0:09:37.498,000 --> 0:09:39,000
the differences week to week are much greater

208
0:09:40.049,000 --> 0:09:42,000
than the differences between individual healthy adults

209
0:09:42.58,000 --> 0:09:43,000
in the Human Microbiome Project cohort,

210
0:09:44.53,000 --> 0:09:46,000
which are those brown dots down at the bottom.

211
0:09:47.006,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And you can see he's starting to approach the adult fecal community.

212
0:09:50.203,000 --> 0:09:51,000
This is up to about two years.

213
0:09:51.718,000 --> 0:09:53,000
But something amazing is about to happen here.

214
0:09:53.888,000 --> 0:09:56,000
So he's getting antibiotics for an ear infection.

215
0:09:56.976,000 --> 0:09:58,000
What you can see is this huge change in the community,

216
0:09:59.53,000 --> 0:10:01,000
followed by a relatively rapid recovery.

217
0:10:01.588,000 --> 0:10:03,000
I'll just rewind that for you.

218
0:10:05.34,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And what we can see is that just over these few weeks,

219
0:10:08.929,000 --> 0:10:09,000
we have a much more radical change,

220
0:10:10.862,000 --> 0:10:12,000
a setback of many months of normal development,

221
0:10:13.392,000 --> 0:10:15,000
followed by a relatively rapid recovery,

222
0:10:15.644,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and by the time he reaches day 838,

223
0:10:19.777,000 --> 0:10:2,000
which is the end of this video,

224
0:10:21.496,000 --> 0:10:24,000
you can see that he has essentially reached the healthy adult stool community,

225
0:10:25.193,000 --> 0:10:27,000
despite that antibiotic intervention.

226
0:10:27.641,000 --> 0:10:3,000
So this is really interesting because it raises fundamental questions

227
0:10:30.969,000 --> 0:10:34,000
about what happens when we intervene at different ages in a child's life.

228
0:10:35.068,000 --> 0:10:38,000
So does what we do early on, where the microbiome is changing so rapidly,

229
0:10:38.679,000 --> 0:10:39,000
actually matter,

230
0:10:39.979,000 --> 0:10:41,000
or is it like throwing a stone into a stormy sea,

231
0:10:42.462,000 --> 0:10:43,000
where the ripples will just be lost?

232
0:10:45.044,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Well, fascinatingly, it turns out that if you give children antibiotics

233
0:10:49.335,000 --> 0:10:5,000
in the first six months of life,

234
0:10:50.985,000 --> 0:10:52,000
they're more likely to become obese later on

235
0:10:53.77,000 --> 0:10:56,000
than if they don't get antibiotics then or only get them later,

236
0:10:56.897,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and so what we do early on may have profound impacts

237
0:10:59.843,000 --> 0:11:02,000
on the gut microbial community and on later health

238
0:11:03.34,000 --> 0:11:05,000
that we're only beginning to understand.

239
0:11:05.666,000 --> 0:11:09,000
So this is fascinating, because one day, in addition to the effects

240
0:11:09.822,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that antibiotics have on antibiotic-resistant bacteria,

241
0:11:12.468,000 --> 0:11:13,000
which are very important,

242
0:11:14.164,000 --> 0:11:16,000
they may also be degrading our gut microbial ecosystems,

243
0:11:17.067,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and so one day we may come to regard antibiotics with the same horror

244
0:11:20.339,000 --> 0:11:22,000
that we currently reserve for those metal tools

245
0:11:22.802,000 --> 0:11:24,000
that the Egyptians used to use to mush up the brains

246
0:11:25.261,000 --> 0:11:27,000
before they drained them out for embalming.

247
0:11:27.325,000 --> 0:11:3,000
So I mentioned that microbes have all these important functions,

248
0:11:30.346,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and they've also now, just over the past few years,

249
0:11:32.995,000 --> 0:11:34,000
been connected to a whole range of different diseases,

250
0:11:35.828,000 --> 0:11:37,000
including inflammatory bowel disease,

251
0:11:37.913,000 --> 0:11:38,000
heart disease, colon cancer,

252
0:11:39.637,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and even obesity.

253
0:11:41.467,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Obesity has a really large effect, as it turns out,

254
0:11:44.113,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and today, we can tell whether you're lean or obese

255
0:11:46.506,000 --> 0:11:47,000
with 90 percent accuracy

256
0:11:48.385,000 --> 0:11:5,000
by looking at the microbes in your gut.

257
0:11:50.497,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Now, although that might sound impressive,

258
0:11:52.786,000 --> 0:11:55,000
in some ways it's a little bit problematic as a medical test,

259
0:11:56.117,000 --> 0:11:58,000
because you can probably tell which of these people is obese

260
0:11:59.114,000 --> 0:12:01,000
without knowing anything about their gut microbes,

261
0:12:01.866,000 --> 0:12:04,000
but it turns out that even if we sequence their complete genomes

262
0:12:04.909,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and had all their human DNA,

263
0:12:06.566,000 --> 0:12:1,000
we could only predict which one was obese with about 60 percent accuracy.

264
0:12:10.932,000 --> 0:12:11,000
So that's amazing, right?

265
0:12:12.306,000 --> 0:12:15,000
What it means that the three pounds of microbes that you carry around with you

266
0:12:16.118,000 --> 0:12:18,000
may be more important for some health conditions

267
0:12:18.46,000 --> 0:12:21,000
than every single gene in your genome.

268
0:12:23.555,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And then in mice, we can do a lot more.

269
0:12:25.792,000 --> 0:12:28,000
So in mice, microbes have been linked to all kinds of additional conditions,

270
0:12:29.437,000 --> 0:12:31,000
including things like multiple sclerosis,

271
0:12:32.153,000 --> 0:12:35,000
depression, autism, and again, obesity.

272
0:12:35.891,000 --> 0:12:37,000
But how can we tell whether these microbial differences

273
0:12:38.655,000 --> 0:12:4,000
that correlate with disease are cause or effect?

274
0:12:41.418,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Well, one thing we can do is we can raise some mice

275
0:12:44.065,000 --> 0:12:46,000
without any microbes of their own in a germ-free bubble.

276
0:12:46.712,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Then we can add in some microbes that we think are important,

277
0:12:49.665,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and see what happens.

278
0:12:51.747,000 --> 0:12:53,000
When we take the microbes from an obese mouse

279
0:12:54.026,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and transplant them into a genetically normal mouse

280
0:12:56.53,000 --> 0:12:58,000
that's been raised in a bubble with no microbes of its own,

281
0:12:59.389,000 --> 0:13:02,000
it becomes fatter than if it got them from a regular mouse.

282
0:13:04.142,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Why this happens is absolutely amazing, though.

283
0:13:06.461,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Sometimes what's going on is that the microbes

284
0:13:08.661,000 --> 0:13:11,000
are helping them digest food more efficiently from the same diet,

285
0:13:11.719,000 --> 0:13:13,000
so they're taking more energy from their food,

286
0:13:13.923,000 --> 0:13:16,000
but other times, the microbes are actually affecting their behavior.

287
0:13:17.154,000 --> 0:13:2,000
What they're doing is they're eating more than the normal mouse,

288
0:13:20.194,000 --> 0:13:23,000
so they only get fat if we let them eat as much as they want.

289
0:13:24.614,000 --> 0:13:26,000
So this is really remarkable, right?

290
0:13:27.3,000 --> 0:13:31,000
The implication is that microbes can affect mammalian behavior.

291
0:13:33.224,000 --> 0:13:37,000
So you might be wondering whether we can also do this sort of thing across species,

292
0:13:37.382,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and it turns out that if you take microbes from an obese person

293
0:13:40.652,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and transplant them into mice you've raised germ-free,

294
0:13:43.715,000 --> 0:13:45,000
those mice will also become fatter

295
0:13:45.805,000 --> 0:13:48,000
than if they received the microbes from a lean person,

296
0:13:48.846,000 --> 0:13:51,000
but we can design a microbial community that we inoculate them with

297
0:13:52.191,000 --> 0:13:54,000
that prevents them from gaining this weight.

298
0:13:55.545,000 --> 0:13:57,000
We can also do this for malnutrition.

299
0:13:57.6,000 --> 0:14:,000
So in a project funded by the Gates Foundation,

300
0:14:00.688,000 --> 0:14:02,000
what we're looking at is children in Malawi

301
0:14:02.871,000 --> 0:14:04,000
who have kwashiorkor, a profound form of malnutrition,

302
0:14:05.529,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and mice that get the kwashiorkor community transplanted into them

303
0:14:08.652,000 --> 0:14:1,000
lose 30 percent of their body mass

304
0:14:11.022,000 --> 0:14:12,000
in just three weeks,

305
0:14:12.201,000 --> 0:14:15,000
but we can restore their health by using the same peanut butter-based supplement

306
0:14:16.019,000 --> 0:14:18,000
that is used for the children in the clinic,

307
0:14:18.132,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and the mice that receive the community

308
0:14:19.988,000 --> 0:14:22,000
from the healthy identical twins of the kwashiorkor children do fine.

309
0:14:24.035,000 --> 0:14:27,000
This is truly amazing because it suggests that we can pilot therapies

310
0:14:27.976,000 --> 0:14:29,000
by trying them out in a whole bunch of different mice

311
0:14:30.483,000 --> 0:14:31,000
with individual people's gut communities

312
0:14:32.413,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and perhaps tailor those therapies all the way down to the individual level.

313
0:14:38.262,000 --> 0:14:4,000
So I think it's really important that everyone has a chance

314
0:14:41.177,000 --> 0:14:43,000
to participate in this discovery.

315
0:14:43.883,000 --> 0:14:44,000
So, a couple of years ago,

316
0:14:45.131,000 --> 0:14:47,000
we started this project called American Gut,

317
0:14:47.202,000 --> 0:14:51,000
which allows you to claim a place for yourself on this microbial map.

318
0:14:51.406,000 --> 0:14:54,000
This is now the largest crowd-funded science project that we know of --

319
0:14:54.763,000 --> 0:14:56,000
over 8,000 people have signed up at this point.

320
0:14:57.651,000 --> 0:14:59,000
What happens is, they send in their samples,

321
0:15:00.229,000 --> 0:15:03,000
we sequence the DNA of their microbes and then release the results back to them.

322
0:15:04.014,000 --> 0:15:07,000
We also release them, de-identified, to scientists, to educators,

323
0:15:07.705,000 --> 0:15:1,000
to interested members of the general public, and so forth,

324
0:15:10.724,000 --> 0:15:13,000
so anyone can have access to the data.

325
0:15:13.879,000 --> 0:15:14,000
On the other hand,

326
0:15:15.05,000 --> 0:15:18,000
when we do tours of our lab at the BioFrontiers Institute,

327
0:15:18.332,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and we explain that we use robots and lasers to look at poop,

328
0:15:21.892,000 --> 0:15:24,000
it turns out that not everyone wants to know.

329
0:15:25.004,000 --> 0:15:26,000
(Laughter)

330
0:15:26.286,000 --> 0:15:27,000
But I'm guessing that many of you do,

331
0:15:28.207,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and so I brought some kits here if you're interested

332
0:15:30.866,000 --> 0:15:32,000
in trying this out for yourself.

333
0:15:35.046,000 --> 0:15:36,000
So why might we want to do this?

334
0:15:36.993,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Well, it turns out that microbes are not just important

335
0:15:39.563,000 --> 0:15:41,000
for finding out where we are in terms of our health,

336
0:15:42.464,000 --> 0:15:44,000
but they can actually cure disease.

337
0:15:44.872,000 --> 0:15:46,000
This is one of the newest things we've been able to visualize

338
0:15:47.797,000 --> 0:15:49,000
with colleagues at the University of Minnesota.

339
0:15:50.536,000 --> 0:15:52,000
So here's that map of the human microbiome again.

340
0:15:53.153,000 --> 0:15:54,000
What we're looking at now --

341
0:15:54.61,000 --> 0:15:57,000
I'm going to add in the community of some people with C. diff.

342
0:15:57.98,000 --> 0:15:59,000
So, this is a terrible form of diarrhea

343
0:16:00.259,000 --> 0:16:02,000
where you have to go up to 20 times a day,

344
0:16:02.604,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and these people have failed antibiotic therapy for two years

345
0:16:05.715,000 --> 0:16:07,000
before they're eligible for this trial.

346
0:16:08.014,000 --> 0:16:12,000
So what would happen if we transplanted some of the stool from a healthy donor,

347
0:16:12.427,000 --> 0:16:13,000
that star down at the bottom,

348
0:16:14.284,000 --> 0:16:15,000
into these patients.

349
0:16:15.7,000 --> 0:16:17,000
Would the good microbes do battle with the bad microbes

350
0:16:18.309,000 --> 0:16:2,000
and help to restore their health?

351
0:16:20.388,000 --> 0:16:22,000
So let's watch exactly what happens there.

352
0:16:22.704,000 --> 0:16:24,000
Four of those patients are about to get a transplant

353
0:16:25.22,000 --> 0:16:26,000
from that healthy donor at the bottom,

354
0:16:27.124,000 --> 0:16:28,000
and what you can see is that immediately,

355
0:16:29.081,000 --> 0:16:31,000
you have this radical change in the gut community.

356
0:16:31.486,000 --> 0:16:33,000
So one day after you do that transplant,

357
0:16:33.555,000 --> 0:16:34,000
all those symptoms clear up,

358
0:16:35.204,000 --> 0:16:36,000
the diarrhea vanishes,

359
0:16:36.759,000 --> 0:16:39,000
and they're essentially healthy again, coming to resemble the donor's community,

360
0:16:40.531,000 --> 0:16:42,000
and they stay there.

361
0:16:42.593,000 --> 0:16:46,000
(Applause)

362
0:16:49.29,000 --> 0:16:51,000
So we're just at the beginning of this discovery.

363
0:16:51.665,000 --> 0:16:53,000
We're just finding out that microbes have implications

364
0:16:54.205,000 --> 0:16:56,000
for all these different kinds of diseases,

365
0:16:56.378,000 --> 0:16:58,000
ranging from inflammatory bowel disease to obesity,

366
0:16:58.846,000 --> 0:17:01,000
and perhaps even autism and depression.

367
0:17:01.929,000 --> 0:17:02,000
What we need to do, though,

368
0:17:03.267,000 --> 0:17:05,000
is we need to develop a kind of microbial GPS,

369
0:17:05.525,000 --> 0:17:07,000
where we don't just know where we are currently

370
0:17:07.846,000 --> 0:17:1,000
but also where we want to go and what we need to do

371
0:17:11.397,000 --> 0:17:12,000
in order to get there,

372
0:17:12.883,000 --> 0:17:14,000
and we need to be able to make this simple enough

373
0:17:15.228,000 --> 0:17:17,000
that even a child can use it. (Laughter)

374
0:17:17.829,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Thank you.

375
0:17:20.058,000 --> 0:17:23,000
(Applause)

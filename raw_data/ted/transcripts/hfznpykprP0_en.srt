1
0:00:13.007,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Now, Hegel -- he very famously said

2
0:00:16.016,000 --> 0:00:18,000
that Africa was a place without history,

3
0:00:18.847,000 --> 0:00:2,000
without past, without narrative.

4
0:00:20.959,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Yet, I'd argue that no other continent has nurtured, has fought for,

5
0:00:26.811,000 --> 0:00:29,000
has celebrated its history more concertedly.

6
0:00:30.303,000 --> 0:00:33,000
The struggle to keep African narrative alive

7
0:00:33.396,000 --> 0:00:35,000
has been one of the most consistent

8
0:00:35.511,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and hard-fought endeavors of African peoples,

9
0:00:38.444,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and it continues to be so.

10
0:00:40.441,000 --> 0:00:44,000
The struggles endured and the sacrifices made to hold onto narrative

11
0:00:45.176,000 --> 0:00:51,000
in the face of enslavement, colonialism, racism, wars and so much else

12
0:00:51.249,000 --> 0:00:53,000
has been the underpinning narrative

13
0:00:53.284,000 --> 0:00:54,000
of our history.

14
0:00:55.434,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And our narrative has not just survived the assaults

15
0:00:58.619,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that history has thrown at it.

16
0:01:00.438,000 --> 0:01:03,000
We've left a body of material culture,

17
0:01:04.184,000 --> 0:01:07,000
artistic magistery and intellectual output.

18
0:01:08.101,000 --> 0:01:12,000
We've mapped and we've charted and we've captured our histories

19
0:01:12.761,000 --> 0:01:15,000
in ways that are the measure of anywhere else on earth.

20
0:01:17.063,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Long before the meaningful arrival of Europeans --

21
0:01:21.643,000 --> 0:01:24,000
indeed, whilst Europe was still mired in its Dark Age --

22
0:01:25.207,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Africans were pioneering techniques in recording, in nurturing history,

23
0:01:31.287,000 --> 0:01:35,000
forging revolutionary methods for keeping their story alive.

24
0:01:36.823,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And living history, dynamic heritage --

25
0:01:39.809,000 --> 0:01:41,000
it remains important to us.

26
0:01:42.145,000 --> 0:01:45,000
We see that manifest in so many ways.

27
0:01:46.576,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I'm reminded of how, just last year -- you might remember it --

28
0:01:51.448,000 --> 0:01:52,000
the first members

29
0:01:52.643,000 --> 0:01:54,000
of the al Qaeda-affiliated Ansar Dine

30
0:01:55.092,000 --> 0:01:58,000
were indicted for war crimes and sent to the Hague.

31
0:01:58.338,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And one of the most notorious was Ahmad al-Faqi,

32
0:02:02.92,000 --> 0:02:03,000
who was a young Malian,

33
0:02:04.388,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and he was charged, not with genocide,

34
0:02:06.538,000 --> 0:02:07,000
not with ethnic cleansing,

35
0:02:08.478,000 --> 0:02:11,000
but with being one of the instigators of a campaign

36
0:02:12.317,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to destroy some of Mali's most important cultural heritage.

37
0:02:16.762,000 --> 0:02:17,000
This wasn't vandalism;

38
0:02:18.584,000 --> 0:02:2,000
these weren't thoughtless acts.

39
0:02:21.389,000 --> 0:02:22,000
One of the things that al-Faqi said

40
0:02:23.242,000 --> 0:02:25,000
when he was asked to identify himself in court

41
0:02:26.199,000 --> 0:02:28,000
was that he was a graduate, that he was a teacher.

42
0:02:29.661,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Over the course of 2012, they engaged in a systematic campaign

43
0:02:35.318,000 --> 0:02:38,000
to destroy Mali's cultural heritage.

44
0:02:39.142,000 --> 0:02:43,000
This was a deeply considered waging of war

45
0:02:43.491,000 --> 0:02:45,000
in the most powerful way that could be envisaged:

46
0:02:46.198,000 --> 0:02:49,000
in destroying narrative, in destroying stories.

47
0:02:50.21,000 --> 0:02:53,000
The attempted destruction of nine shrines,

48
0:02:53.597,000 --> 0:02:54,000
the central mosque

49
0:02:55.115,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and perhaps as many as 4,000 manuscripts

50
0:02:58.632,000 --> 0:03:,000
was a considered act.

51
0:03:01.729,000 --> 0:03:06,000
They understood the power of narrative to hold communities together,

52
0:03:07.105,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and they conversely understood that in destroying stories,

53
0:03:11.347,000 --> 0:03:13,000
they hoped they would destroy a people.

54
0:03:14.286,000 --> 0:03:17,000
But just as Ansar Dine and their insurgency

55
0:03:17.807,000 --> 0:03:2,000
were driven by powerful narratives,

56
0:03:21.047,000 --> 0:03:25,000
so was the local population's defense of Timbuktu and its libraries.

57
0:03:25.428,000 --> 0:03:29,000
These were communities who've grown up with stories of the Mali Empire;

58
0:03:29.682,000 --> 0:03:32,000
lived in the shadow of Timbuktu's great libraries.

59
0:03:32.867,000 --> 0:03:35,000
They'd listened to songs of its origin from their childhood,

60
0:03:36.748,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and they weren't about to give up on that

61
0:03:39.514,000 --> 0:03:4,000
without a fight.

62
0:03:41.12,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Over difficult months of 2012,

63
0:03:44.356,000 --> 0:03:47,000
during the Ansar Dine invasion,

64
0:03:48.332,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Malians, ordinary people, risked their lives

65
0:03:52.182,000 --> 0:03:55,000
to secrete and smuggle documents to safety,

66
0:03:56.628,000 --> 0:03:59,000
doing what they could to protect historic buildings

67
0:03:59.958,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and defend their ancient libraries.

68
0:04:02.282,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And although they weren't always successful,

69
0:04:04.96,000 --> 0:04:07,000
many of the most important manuscripts were thankfully saved,

70
0:04:08.667,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and today each one of the shrines that was damaged during that uprising

71
0:04:13.596,000 --> 0:04:14,000
have been rebuilt,

72
0:04:15.412,000 --> 0:04:2,000
including the 14th-century mosque that is the symbolic heart of the city.

73
0:04:20.654,000 --> 0:04:21,000
It's been fully restored.

74
0:04:22.494,000 --> 0:04:26,000
But even in the bleakest periods of the occupation,

75
0:04:26.923,000 --> 0:04:31,000
enough of the population of Timbuktu simply would not bow

76
0:04:32.34,000 --> 0:04:33,000
to men like al-Faqi.

77
0:04:34.231,000 --> 0:04:37,000
They wouldn't allow their history to be wiped away,

78
0:04:37.318,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and anyone who has visited that part of the world,

79
0:04:40.609,000 --> 0:04:41,000
they will understand why,

80
0:04:42.461,000 --> 0:04:47,000
why stories, why narrative, why histories are of such importance.

81
0:04:47.618,000 --> 0:04:49,000
History matters.

82
0:04:49.978,000 --> 0:04:51,000
History really matters.

83
0:04:53.227,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And for peoples of African descent,

84
0:04:55.487,000 --> 0:05:,000
who have seen their narrative systematically assaulted over centuries,

85
0:05:01.129,000 --> 0:05:03,000
this is critically important.

86
0:05:04.131,000 --> 0:05:08,000
This is part of a recurrent echo across our history

87
0:05:08.203,000 --> 0:05:13,000
of ordinary people making a stand for their story, for their history.

88
0:05:14.385,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Just as in the 19th century,

89
0:05:16.078,000 --> 0:05:19,000
enslaved peoples of African descent in the Caribbean

90
0:05:20.071,000 --> 0:05:22,000
fought under threat of punishment,

91
0:05:22.409,000 --> 0:05:26,000
fought to practice their religions, to celebrate Carnival,

92
0:05:26.584,000 --> 0:05:28,000
to keep their history alive.

93
0:05:29.343,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Ordinary people were prepared to make great sacrifices,

94
0:05:33.247,000 --> 0:05:36,000
some even the ultimate sacrifice,

95
0:05:36.497,000 --> 0:05:37,000
for their history.

96
0:05:38.965,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And it was through control of narrative

97
0:05:41.434,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that some of the most devastating colonial campaigns were crystallized.

98
0:05:45.794,000 --> 0:05:48,000
It was through the dominance of one narrative over another

99
0:05:49.673,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that the worst manifestations of colonialism became palpable.

100
0:05:54.795,000 --> 0:05:57,000
When, in 1874, the British attacked the Ashanti,

101
0:05:58.712,000 --> 0:06:01,000
they overran Kumasi and captured the Asantehene.

102
0:06:02.364,000 --> 0:06:06,000
They knew that controlling territory and subjugating the head of state --

103
0:06:07.161,000 --> 0:06:08,000
it wasn't enough.

104
0:06:08.742,000 --> 0:06:11,000
They recognized that the emotional authority of state

105
0:06:12.29,000 --> 0:06:13,000
lay in its narrative

106
0:06:15.118,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and the symbols that represented it,

107
0:06:17.704,000 --> 0:06:18,000
like the Golden Stool.

108
0:06:19.706,000 --> 0:06:24,000
They understood that control of story was absolutely critical

109
0:06:25.197,000 --> 0:06:27,000
to truly controlling a people.

110
0:06:27.468,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And the Ashanti understood, too,

111
0:06:29.571,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and they never were to relinquish the precious Golden Stool,

112
0:06:34.005,000 --> 0:06:38,000
never to completely capitulate to the British.

113
0:06:39.289,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Narrative matters.

114
0:06:41.657,000 --> 0:06:46,000
In 1871, Karl Mauch, a German geologist working in Southern Africa,

115
0:06:47.339,000 --> 0:06:51,000
he stumbled across an extraordinary complex,

116
0:06:51.42,000 --> 0:06:53,000
a complex of abandoned stone buildings.

117
0:06:54.17,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And he never quite recovered from what he saw:

118
0:06:57.51,000 --> 0:07:,000
a granite, drystone city,

119
0:07:00.767,000 --> 0:07:03,000
stranded on an outcrop above an empty savannah:

120
0:07:04.592,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Great Zimbabwe.

121
0:07:07.073,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And Mauch had no idea who was responsible

122
0:07:10.589,000 --> 0:07:15,000
for what was obviously an astonishing feat of architecture,

123
0:07:15.679,000 --> 0:07:18,000
but he felt sure of one single thing:

124
0:07:19.246,000 --> 0:07:22,000
this narrative needed to be claimed.

125
0:07:23.06,000 --> 0:07:26,000
He later wrote that the wrought architecture of Great Zimbabwe

126
0:07:26.928,000 --> 0:07:28,000
was simply too sophisticated,

127
0:07:29.691,000 --> 0:07:32,000
too special to have been built by Africans.

128
0:07:33.248,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Mauch, like dozens of Europeans that followed in his footsteps,

129
0:07:37.799,000 --> 0:07:39,000
speculated on who might have built the city.

130
0:07:40.603,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And one went as far as to posit,

131
0:07:43.841,000 --> 0:07:48,000
"I do not think that I am far wrong if I suppose that that ruin on the hill

132
0:07:49.59,000 --> 0:07:51,000
is a copy of King Solomon's Temple."

133
0:07:52.165,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And as I'm sure you know, Mauch,

134
0:07:53.92,000 --> 0:07:55,000
he hadn't stumbled upon King Solomon's Temple,

135
0:07:56.888,000 --> 0:07:59,000
but upon a purely African complex of buildings

136
0:08:00.458,000 --> 0:08:03,000
constructed by a purely African civilization

137
0:08:04.109,000 --> 0:08:05,000
from the 11th century onward.

138
0:08:06.089,000 --> 0:08:1,000
But like Leo Frobenius, a fellow German anthropologist

139
0:08:10.264,000 --> 0:08:12,000
who speculated some years later,

140
0:08:12.633,000 --> 0:08:16,000
upon seeing the Nigerian Ife Heads for the very first time,

141
0:08:16.664,000 --> 0:08:21,000
that they must have been artifacts from the long-lost kingdom of Atlantis.

142
0:08:22.095,000 --> 0:08:24,000
He felt, just like Hegel,

143
0:08:24.696,000 --> 0:08:29,000
an almost instinctive need to rob Africa of its history.

144
0:08:31.216,000 --> 0:08:33,000
These ideas are so irrational,

145
0:08:33.646,000 --> 0:08:34,000
so deeply held,

146
0:08:35.483,000 --> 0:08:38,000
that even when faced with the physical archaeology,

147
0:08:38.706,000 --> 0:08:4,000
they couldn't think rationally.

148
0:08:40.739,000 --> 0:08:41,000
They could no longer see.

149
0:08:42.761,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And like so much of Africa's relationship with Enlightenment Europe,

150
0:08:46.966,000 --> 0:08:51,000
it involved appropriation, denigration and control of the continent.

151
0:08:52.773,000 --> 0:08:56,000
It involved an attempt to bend narrative to Europe's ends.

152
0:08:57.955,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And if Mauch had really wanted to find an answer to his question,

153
0:09:02.172,000 --> 0:09:06,000
"Where did Great Zimbabwe or that great stone building come from?"

154
0:09:06.85,000 --> 0:09:08,000
he would have needed to begin his quest

155
0:09:09.074,000 --> 0:09:11,000
a thousand miles away from Great Zimbabwe,

156
0:09:11.787,000 --> 0:09:14,000
at the eastern edge of the continent, where Africa meets the Indian Ocean.

157
0:09:15.63,000 --> 0:09:18,000
He would have needed to trace the gold and the goods

158
0:09:18.862,000 --> 0:09:22,000
from some of the great trading emporia of the Swahili coast to Great Zimbabwe,

159
0:09:23.701,000 --> 0:09:26,000
to gain a sense of the scale and influence

160
0:09:27.184,000 --> 0:09:28,000
of that mysterious culture,

161
0:09:29.088,000 --> 0:09:34,000
to get a picture of Great Zimbabwe as a political, cultural entity

162
0:09:34.294,000 --> 0:09:37,000
through the kingdoms and the civilizations

163
0:09:37.759,000 --> 0:09:39,000
that were drawn under its control.

164
0:09:40.242,000 --> 0:09:45,000
For centuries, traders have been drawn to that bit of the coast

165
0:09:46.463,000 --> 0:09:5,000
from as far away as India and China and the Middle East.

166
0:09:51.233,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And it might be tempting to interpret,

167
0:09:53.944,000 --> 0:09:56,000
because it's exquisitely beautiful, that building,

168
0:09:57.078,000 --> 0:09:59,000
it might be tempting to interpret it

169
0:10:00.09,000 --> 0:10:03,000
as just an exquisite, symbolic jewel,

170
0:10:03.642,000 --> 0:10:05,000
a vast ceremonial sculpture in stone.

171
0:10:07.022,000 --> 0:10:1,000
But the site must have been a complex

172
0:10:10.203,000 --> 0:10:14,000
at the center of a significant nexus of economies

173
0:10:14.782,000 --> 0:10:17,000
that defined this region for a millennium.

174
0:10:18.395,000 --> 0:10:19,000
This matters.

175
0:10:20.135,000 --> 0:10:22,000
These narratives matter.

176
0:10:22.198,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Even today, the fight to tell our story is not just against time.

177
0:10:27.263,000 --> 0:10:3,000
It's not just against organizations like Ansar Dine.

178
0:10:31.01,000 --> 0:10:35,000
It's also in establishing a truly African voice

179
0:10:35.108,000 --> 0:10:37,000
after centuries of imposed histories.

180
0:10:38.775,000 --> 0:10:41,000
We don't just have to recolonize our history,

181
0:10:42.23,000 --> 0:10:46,000
but we have to find ways to build back the intellectual underpinning

182
0:10:47.128,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that Hegel denied was there at all.

183
0:10:49.866,000 --> 0:10:51,000
We have to rediscover African philosophy,

184
0:10:52.61,000 --> 0:10:56,000
African perspectives, African history.

185
0:10:57.651,000 --> 0:11:,000
The flowering of Great Zimbabwe -- it wasn't a freak moment.

186
0:11:01.185,000 --> 0:11:04,000
It was part of a burgeoning change across the whole of the continent.

187
0:11:05.182,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Perhaps the great exemplification of that was Sundiata Keita,

188
0:11:09.532,000 --> 0:11:11,000
the founder of the Mali Empire,

189
0:11:11.749,000 --> 0:11:14,000
probably the greatest empire that West Africa has ever seen.

190
0:11:15.713,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Sundiata Keita was born about 1235,

191
0:11:18.835,000 --> 0:11:21,000
growing up in a time of profound flux.

192
0:11:22.928,000 --> 0:11:25,000
He was seeing the transition between the Berber dynasties to the north,

193
0:11:26.8,000 --> 0:11:29,000
he may have heard about the rise of the Ife to the south

194
0:11:30.094,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and perhaps even the dominance of the Solomaic Dynasty

195
0:11:35.235,000 --> 0:11:36,000
in Ethiopia to the east.

196
0:11:37.516,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And he must have been aware that he was living through a moment

197
0:11:41.176,000 --> 0:11:42,000
of quickening change,

198
0:11:42.895,000 --> 0:11:44,000
of growing confidence in our continent.

199
0:11:46.37,000 --> 0:11:49,000
He must have been aware of new states

200
0:11:49.559,000 --> 0:11:51,000
that were building their influence

201
0:11:52.047,000 --> 0:11:57,000
from as far afield as Great Zimbabwe and the Swahili sultanates,

202
0:11:57.339,000 --> 0:12:03,000
each engaged directly or indirectly beyond the continent itself,

203
0:12:03.61,000 --> 0:12:08,000
each driven also to invest in securing their intellectual and cultural legacy.

204
0:12:09.794,000 --> 0:12:12,000
He probably would have engaged in trade with these peer nations

205
0:12:13.246,000 --> 0:12:16,000
as part of a massive continental nexus

206
0:12:16.773,000 --> 0:12:18,000
of great medieval African economies.

207
0:12:19.608,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And like all of those great empires,

208
0:12:23.231,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Sundiata Keita invested in securing his legacy through history

209
0:12:28.856,000 --> 0:12:29,000
by using story --

210
0:12:31.744,000 --> 0:12:36,000
not just formalizing the idea of storytelling,

211
0:12:37.461,000 --> 0:12:39,000
but in building a whole convention

212
0:12:40.162,000 --> 0:12:43,000
of telling and retelling his story

213
0:12:43.547,000 --> 0:12:45,000
as a key to founding a narrative

214
0:12:45.988,000 --> 0:12:46,000
for his empire.

215
0:12:47.607,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And these stories, in musical form,

216
0:12:50.976,000 --> 0:12:53,000
are still sung today.

217
0:12:55.371,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Now, several decades after the death of Sundiata,

218
0:12:58.699,000 --> 0:13:,000
a new king ascended the throne,

219
0:13:01.122,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Mansa Musa, its most famous emperor.

220
0:13:05.309,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Now, Mansa Musa is famed for his vast gold reserves

221
0:13:08.49,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and for sending envoys to the courts of Europe and the Middle East.

222
0:13:13.238,000 --> 0:13:17,000
He was every bit as ambitious as his predecessors,

223
0:13:17.285,000 --> 0:13:21,000
but saw a different kind of route of securing his place in history.

224
0:13:21.576,000 --> 0:13:25,000
In 1324, Mansa Musa went on pilgrimage to Mecca,

225
0:13:25.607,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and he traveled with a retinue of thousands.

226
0:13:28.962,000 --> 0:13:34,000
It's been said that 100 camels each carried 100 pounds of gold.

227
0:13:35.644,000 --> 0:13:38,000
It's been recorded that he built a fully functioning mosque

228
0:13:39.184,000 --> 0:13:41,000
every Friday of his trip,

229
0:13:41.375,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and performed so many acts of kindness,

230
0:13:44.52,000 --> 0:13:47,000
that the great Berber chronicler, Ibn Battuta, wrote,

231
0:13:48.383,000 --> 0:13:5,000
"He flooded Cairo with kindness,

232
0:13:51.366,000 --> 0:13:54,000
spending so much in the markets of North Africa and the Middle East

233
0:13:54.927,000 --> 0:13:58,000
that it affected the price of gold into the next decade."

234
0:14:00.081,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And on his return,

235
0:14:01.652,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Mansa Musa memorialized his journey

236
0:14:05.885,000 --> 0:14:1,000
by building a mosque at the heart of his empire.

237
0:14:11.792,000 --> 0:14:13,000
And the legacy of what he left behind,

238
0:14:14.462,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Timbuktu,

239
0:14:16.163,000 --> 0:14:21,000
it represents one of the great bodies of written historical material

240
0:14:21.447,000 --> 0:14:23,000
produced by African scholars:

241
0:14:23.654,000 --> 0:14:26,000
about 700,000 medieval documents,

242
0:14:26.9,000 --> 0:14:29,000
ranging from scholarly works to letters,

243
0:14:30.123,000 --> 0:14:33,000
which have been preserved often by private households.

244
0:14:33.195,000 --> 0:14:36,000
And at its peak, in the 15th and 16th centuries,

245
0:14:36.702,000 --> 0:14:39,000
the university there was as influential

246
0:14:40.714,000 --> 0:14:43,000
as any educational establishment in Europe,

247
0:14:43.784,000 --> 0:14:45,000
attracting about 25,000 students.

248
0:14:46.802,000 --> 0:14:49,000
This was in a city of around 100,000 people.

249
0:14:50.392,000 --> 0:14:55,000
It cemented Timbuktu as a world center of learning.

250
0:14:55.594,000 --> 0:14:59,000
But this was a very particular kind of learning

251
0:14:59.825,000 --> 0:15:02,000
that was focused and driven by Islam.

252
0:15:03.594,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And since I first visited Timbuktu,

253
0:15:05.861,000 --> 0:15:07,000
I've visited many other libraries across Africa,

254
0:15:08.746,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and despite Hegel's view that Africa has no history,

255
0:15:14.065,000 --> 0:15:18,000
not only is it a continent with an embarrassment of history,

256
0:15:18.302,000 --> 0:15:22,000
it has developed unrivaled systems for collecting and promoting it.

257
0:15:23.634,000 --> 0:15:25,000
There are thousands of small archives,

258
0:15:26.479,000 --> 0:15:27,000
textile drum stores,

259
0:15:28.401,000 --> 0:15:32,000
that have become more than repositories of manuscripts and material culture.

260
0:15:33.296,000 --> 0:15:36,000
They have become fonts of communal narrative,

261
0:15:36.459,000 --> 0:15:38,000
symbols of continuity,

262
0:15:38.743,000 --> 0:15:41,000
and I'm pretty sure that many of those European philosophers

263
0:15:41.893,000 --> 0:15:44,000
who questioned an African intellectual tradition

264
0:15:45.414,000 --> 0:15:47,000
must have, beneath their prejudices,

265
0:15:48.315,000 --> 0:15:53,000
been aware of the contribution of Africa's intellectuals

266
0:15:53.53,000 --> 0:15:54,000
to Western learning.

267
0:15:54.887,000 --> 0:15:55,000
They must have known

268
0:15:56.149,000 --> 0:15:58,000
of the great North African medieval philosophers

269
0:15:59.001,000 --> 0:16:01,000
who had driven the Mediterranean.

270
0:16:01.517,000 --> 0:16:04,000
They must have known about and been aware of

271
0:16:04.94,000 --> 0:16:09,000
that tradition that is part of Christianity, of the three wise men.

272
0:16:09.993,000 --> 0:16:12,000
And in the medieval period, Balthazar, that third wise man,

273
0:16:14.006,000 --> 0:16:16,000
was represented as an African king.

274
0:16:16.733,000 --> 0:16:18,000
And he became hugely popular

275
0:16:19.361,000 --> 0:16:22,000
as the third intellectual leg of Old World learning,

276
0:16:23.37,000 --> 0:16:26,000
alongside Europe and Asia, as a peer.

277
0:16:27.652,000 --> 0:16:3,000
These things were well-known.

278
0:16:31.552,000 --> 0:16:34,000
These communities did not grow up in isolation.

279
0:16:35.2,000 --> 0:16:39,000
Timbuktu's wealth and power developed because the city became

280
0:16:39.333,000 --> 0:16:43,000
a hub of lucrative intercontinental trade routes.

281
0:16:43.437,000 --> 0:16:45,000
This was one center

282
0:16:45.627,000 --> 0:16:47,000
in a borderless, transcontinental,

283
0:16:48.201,000 --> 0:16:51,000
ambitious, outwardly focused, confident continent.

284
0:16:52.874,000 --> 0:16:55,000
Berber merchants, they carried salt and textiles

285
0:16:56.82,000 --> 0:16:59,000
and new precious goods and learning down into West Africa

286
0:17:00.644,000 --> 0:17:02,000
from across the desert.

287
0:17:03.224,000 --> 0:17:06,000
But as you can see from this map

288
0:17:06.719,000 --> 0:17:1,000
that was produced a little time after the life of Mansa Musa,

289
0:17:10.988,000 --> 0:17:14,000
there was also a nexus of sub-Saharan trade routes,

290
0:17:15.614,000 --> 0:17:18,000
along which African ideas and traditions

291
0:17:18.898,000 --> 0:17:21,000
added to the intellectual worth of Timbuktu

292
0:17:22.545,000 --> 0:17:24,000
and indeed across the desert to Europe.

293
0:17:26.42,000 --> 0:17:29,000
Manuscripts and material culture,

294
0:17:30.174,000 --> 0:17:34,000
they have become fonts of communal narrative,

295
0:17:35.125,000 --> 0:17:37,000
symbols of continuity.

296
0:17:37.192,000 --> 0:17:41,000
And I'm pretty sure that those European intellectuals

297
0:17:41.927,000 --> 0:17:44,000
who cast aspersions on our history,

298
0:17:45.685,000 --> 0:17:48,000
they knew fundamentally about our traditions.

299
0:17:50.155,000 --> 0:17:54,000
And today, as strident forces like Ansar Dine and Boko Haram

300
0:17:54.889,000 --> 0:17:55,000
grow popular in West Africa,

301
0:17:56.826,000 --> 0:18:01,000
it's that spirit of truly indigenous, dynamic, intellectual defiance

302
0:18:02.46,000 --> 0:18:04,000
that holds ancient traditions in good stead.

303
0:18:05.438,000 --> 0:18:08,000
When Mansa Musa made Timbuktu his capital,

304
0:18:08.661,000 --> 0:18:11,000
he looked upon the city as a Medici looked upon Florence:

305
0:18:12.663,000 --> 0:18:17,000
as the center of an open, intellectual, entrepreneurial empire

306
0:18:17.746,000 --> 0:18:2,000
that thrived on great ideas wherever they came from.

307
0:18:21.087,000 --> 0:18:23,000
The city, the culture,

308
0:18:23.36,000 --> 0:18:26,000
the very intellectual DNA of this region

309
0:18:26.502,000 --> 0:18:29,000
remains so beautifully complex and diverse,

310
0:18:30.219,000 --> 0:18:32,000
that it will always remain, in part,

311
0:18:32.912,000 --> 0:18:36,000
located in storytelling traditions that derive from indigenous,

312
0:18:37.248,000 --> 0:18:38,000
pre-Islamic traditions.

313
0:18:39.037,000 --> 0:18:44,000
The highly successful form of Islam that developed in Mali became popular

314
0:18:44.668,000 --> 0:18:46,000
because it accepted those freedoms

315
0:18:46.741,000 --> 0:18:48,000
and that inherent cultural diversity.

316
0:18:49.247,000 --> 0:18:51,000
And the celebration of that complexity,

317
0:18:51.698,000 --> 0:18:55,000
that love of rigorously contested discourse,

318
0:18:55.747,000 --> 0:18:56,000
that appreciation of narrative,

319
0:18:57.615,000 --> 0:19:,000
was and remains, in spite of everything,

320
0:19:00.913,000 --> 0:19:03,000
the very heart of West Africa.

321
0:19:04.347,000 --> 0:19:08,000
And today, as the shrines and the mosque vandalized by Ansar Dine

322
0:19:08.953,000 --> 0:19:09,000
have been rebuilt,

323
0:19:10.134,000 --> 0:19:13,000
many of the instigators of their destruction have been jailed.

324
0:19:13.985,000 --> 0:19:15,000
And we are left with powerful lessons,

325
0:19:16.911,000 --> 0:19:2,000
reminded once again of how our history and narrative

326
0:19:21.291,000 --> 0:19:24,000
have held communities together for millennia,

327
0:19:25.222,000 --> 0:19:28,000
how they remain vital in making sense of modern Africa.

328
0:19:29.906,000 --> 0:19:3,000
And we're also reminded

329
0:19:31.44,000 --> 0:19:36,000
of how the roots of this confident, intellectual, entrepreneurial,

330
0:19:36.488,000 --> 0:19:4,000
outward-facing, culturally porous, tariff-free Africa

331
0:19:41.296,000 --> 0:19:43,000
was once the envy of the world.

332
0:19:44.181,000 --> 0:19:46,000
But those roots, they remain.

333
0:19:46.775,000 --> 0:19:47,000
Thank you very much.

334
0:19:48.012,000 --> 0:19:52,000
(Applause)

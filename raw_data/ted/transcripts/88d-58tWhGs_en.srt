1
0:00:13.722,000 --> 0:00:15,000
When I was a kid, I was afraid of the dark.

2
0:00:18.032,000 --> 0:00:2,000
The darkness is where the monsters are.

3
0:00:21.54,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And I had this little night light outside of my bedroom

4
0:00:26.671,000 --> 0:00:27,000
so that it would never get too dark.

5
0:00:29.973,000 --> 0:00:33,000
But over time, my fear of the dark turned to curiosity.

6
0:00:35.41,000 --> 0:00:37,000
What is out there in the "dark-dark?"

7
0:00:39.41,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And it turns out

8
0:00:41.728,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that trying to understand the darkness is something that's fascinated humans

9
0:00:46.451,000 --> 0:00:48,000
for thousands of years, maybe forever.

10
0:00:49.389,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And we know this

11
0:00:51.27,000 --> 0:00:55,000
because we find their ancient relics of their attempts to map the sky.

12
0:00:58.317,000 --> 0:01:01,000
This tusk is over 30,000 years old.

13
0:01:02.413,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Some people think that it's a carving of Orion

14
0:01:05.428,000 --> 0:01:07,000
or maybe a calendar.

15
0:01:07.944,000 --> 0:01:08,000
We don't know.

16
0:01:09.958,000 --> 0:01:13,000
The Fuxi star map is over 6,000 years old,

17
0:01:14.18,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and it's from a neolithic tomb in ancient China.

18
0:01:17.251,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And that little pile of clamshells

19
0:01:19.721,000 --> 0:01:21,000
underneath the dead guy's foot in the middle --

20
0:01:23.609,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that's supposed to be the Big Dipper.

21
0:01:25.458,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Maybe.

22
0:01:27.284,000 --> 0:01:29,000
The Nebra disk is uncontroversial.

23
0:01:30.902,000 --> 0:01:33,000
You don't have to be an astronomer to know that you're looking at the Moon phases

24
0:01:34.871,000 --> 0:01:35,000
or the Sun in eclipse.

25
0:01:36.331,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And that little group of seven stars, that's the Pleiades, the Seven Sisters.

26
0:01:41.553,000 --> 0:01:42,000
But in any case, the point is clear:

27
0:01:44.72,000 --> 0:01:47,000
astronomers have been mapping the sky for a long time.

28
0:01:48.49,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Why?

29
0:01:50.227,000 --> 0:01:55,000
It's our calling card as a species in the galaxy

30
0:01:55.649,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to figure things out.

31
0:01:58.203,000 --> 0:02:,000
We know our planet,

32
0:02:00.363,000 --> 0:02:01,000
we cure our diseases,

33
0:02:01.988,000 --> 0:02:02,000
we cook our food,

34
0:02:03.752,000 --> 0:02:04,000
we leave our planet.

35
0:02:08.426,000 --> 0:02:09,000
But it's not easy.

36
0:02:11.037,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Understanding the universe is battle.

37
0:02:14.728,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It is unrelenting, it is time-varying,

38
0:02:18.125,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and it is one we are all in together.

39
0:02:21.292,000 --> 0:02:25,000
It is a battle in the darkness against the darkness.

40
0:02:26.853,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Which is why Orion has weapons.

41
0:02:34.17,000 --> 0:02:37,000
In any case, if you're going to engage in this battle,

42
0:02:37.347,000 --> 0:02:38,000
you need to know the battlefield.

43
0:02:39.284,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So at its core,

44
0:02:40.506,000 --> 0:02:42,000
mapping the sky involves three essential elements.

45
0:02:43.196,000 --> 0:02:46,000
You've got objects that are giving off light,

46
0:02:46.407,000 --> 0:02:49,000
you've got telescopes that are collecting that light,

47
0:02:49.772,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and you've got instruments

48
0:02:51.232,000 --> 0:02:53,000
that are helping you understand what that light is.

49
0:02:54.196,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Many of you have mapped the Moon phases over time

50
0:02:57.589,000 --> 0:03:01,000
with your eyes, your eyes being your more basic telescope.

51
0:03:02.133,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And you've understood what that means with your brains,

52
0:03:04.736,000 --> 0:03:06,000
your brains being one of your more basic instruments.

53
0:03:07.506,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Now, if you and a buddy get together,

54
0:03:11.591,000 --> 0:03:14,000
you would spend over 30 years,

55
0:03:14.972,000 --> 0:03:17,000
you would map 1,000 stars extremely precisely.

56
0:03:19.059,000 --> 0:03:21,000
You would move the front line to the battle.

57
0:03:21.552,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And that's what Tycho Brahe and his buddy, or his assistant, really,

58
0:03:25.538,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Johannes Kepler did back in the 1600s.

59
0:03:28.331,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And they moved the line,

60
0:03:30.625,000 --> 0:03:31,000
figured out how planets worked,

61
0:03:32.475,000 --> 0:03:33,000
how they moved around the Sun.

62
0:03:35.141,000 --> 0:03:37,000
But it wasn't until about 100 years ago

63
0:03:37.808,000 --> 0:03:39,000
that we realized

64
0:03:40.103,000 --> 0:03:41,000
it's a big universe.

65
0:03:42.214,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It seems like the universe is just infinite, which it is,

66
0:03:46.469,000 --> 0:03:48,000
but the observable universe is finite.

67
0:03:49.889,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Which means we can win the battle.

68
0:03:54.402,000 --> 0:03:56,000
But if you're going to map the universe,

69
0:03:57.283,000 --> 0:03:59,000
you're not going to do it with one or two of your besties.

70
0:04:00.569,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Mapping the universe takes an army,

71
0:04:03.569,000 --> 0:04:06,000
an army of curious, creative, craftspeople

72
0:04:07.458,000 --> 0:04:1,000
who, working together, can accomplish the extraordinary.

73
0:04:12.476,000 --> 0:04:13,000
I lead this army of creatives,

74
0:04:14.326,000 --> 0:04:17,000
in the fifth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, SDSS.

75
0:04:18.81,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And this is how astronomers have managed to shepherd individual curiosity

76
0:04:23.149,000 --> 0:04:25,000
through its industrial age,

77
0:04:25.284,000 --> 0:04:28,000
preserving the individual ability to make discoveries

78
0:04:28.665,000 --> 0:04:31,000
but putting into place mega machinery to truly advance the frontier.

79
0:04:33.822,000 --> 0:04:36,000
In SDSS, we divide the sky into three mappers:

80
0:04:36.909,000 --> 0:04:39,000
one for the stars, one for the black holes

81
0:04:40.464,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and one for the galaxies.

82
0:04:42.363,000 --> 0:04:44,000
My survey has two hemispheres,

83
0:04:44.665,000 --> 0:04:48,000
five telescopes, or 11, depending on how you count,

84
0:04:48.99,000 --> 0:04:49,000
10 spectrographs

85
0:04:50.573,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and millions of objects.

86
0:04:52.347,000 --> 0:04:53,000
It's a monster.

87
0:04:53.756,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So let's go through the mappers.

88
0:04:57.351,000 --> 0:05:03,000
The Milky Way galaxy has 250 billion plus or minus a few hundred billion stars.

89
0:05:05.497,000 --> 0:05:07,000
That is not a number that you hold in your head.

90
0:05:07.958,000 --> 0:05:09,000
That is a number that doesn't make practical sense

91
0:05:10.323,000 --> 0:05:11,000
to pretty much anybody.

92
0:05:11.632,000 --> 0:05:14,000
You never get 250 billion jelly beans in your hand. You know?

93
0:05:17.543,000 --> 0:05:2,000
We're nowhere near mapping all of those stars yet.

94
0:05:21.345,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So we have to choose the most interesting ones.

95
0:05:24.829,000 --> 0:05:28,000
In SDSS-V, we're mapping six million stars

96
0:05:29.003,000 --> 0:05:31,000
where we think we can measure their age.

97
0:05:31.662,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Because if you can measure the age of a star,

98
0:05:33.86,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that's like having six million clocks spread all throughout the Milky Way.

99
0:05:37.665,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And with that information,

100
0:05:39.127,000 --> 0:05:43,000
we can unravel the history and fossil record of our galaxy

101
0:05:43.771,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and learn how it formed.

102
0:05:47.238,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I'm just going to cut right to the chase here.

103
0:05:50.436,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Black holes are among the most perplexing objects in the universe.

104
0:05:55.627,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Why?

105
0:05:56.807,000 --> 0:06:,000
Because they are literally just math incarnate, in a physical form,

106
0:06:00.842,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that we barely understand.

107
0:06:03.085,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It's like the number zero being animated and walking around the corridors here.

108
0:06:07.751,000 --> 0:06:08,000
That would be super weird.

109
0:06:09.181,000 --> 0:06:1,000
These are weirder.

110
0:06:10.576,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And it's not just like a basketball

111
0:06:12.704,000 --> 0:06:15,000
that you smoosh down into a little point and it's super dense and that's weird.

112
0:06:16.458,000 --> 0:06:18,000
No, smooshed basketballs have a surface.

113
0:06:19.149,000 --> 0:06:22,000
These things don't have surfaces, and we know that now.

114
0:06:23.228,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Because we've seen it.

115
0:06:24.926,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Or the lack of it.

116
0:06:27.609,000 --> 0:06:29,000
What's really interesting about black holes

117
0:06:29.641,000 --> 0:06:32,000
is that we can learn a lot about them by studying the material

118
0:06:33.271,000 --> 0:06:37,000
just as it passes through that point of no information return.

119
0:06:38.098,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Because at that point,

120
0:06:39.574,000 --> 0:06:44,000
it's emitting lots of X-rays and optical and UV and radio waves.

121
0:06:45.376,000 --> 0:06:48,000
We can actually learn how these objects grow.

122
0:06:48.956,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And in SDSS, we're looking at over half a million supermassive black holes,

123
0:06:54.522,000 --> 0:06:56,000
to try to understand how they formed.

124
0:06:58.022,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Like I said,

125
0:07:00.109,000 --> 0:07:02,000
we live in the Milky Way, you guys are all familiar with that.

126
0:07:04.009,000 --> 0:07:07,000
The Milky Way is a completely average galaxy.

127
0:07:08.605,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Nothing funny going on.

128
0:07:10.859,000 --> 0:07:11,000
But it's ours, which is great.

129
0:07:14.794,000 --> 0:07:18,000
We think that the Milky Way, and all the Milky Ways,

130
0:07:18.858,000 --> 0:07:2,000
have this really disturbing past

131
0:07:21.522,000 --> 0:07:24,000
of literally blowing themselves apart.

132
0:07:25.597,000 --> 0:07:28,000
It's like every average guy you know

133
0:07:29.201,000 --> 0:07:31,000
has a history as a punk rock teenager.

134
0:07:32.582,000 --> 0:07:33,000
That's very bizarre.

135
0:07:36.744,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Stars are blowing up in these systems,

136
0:07:38.799,000 --> 0:07:39,000
black holes are growing at their centers

137
0:07:40.807,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and emitting a tremendous amount of energy.

138
0:07:43.387,000 --> 0:07:45,000
How does that happen, how does this transformation happen?

139
0:07:46.355,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And at SDSS, we're going to the bellies of the beast

140
0:07:48.863,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and zooming way in,

141
0:07:50.621,000 --> 0:07:52,000
to look at these processes where they are occurring

142
0:07:53.637,000 --> 0:07:58,000
in order to understand how Sid Vicious grows up into Ward Cleaver.

143
0:08:01.389,000 --> 0:08:02,000
My arsenal.

144
0:08:02.825,000 --> 0:08:04,000
These are my two big telescopes.

145
0:08:04.873,000 --> 0:08:08,000
The Apache Point Observatory hosts the Sloan telescope in New Mexico,

146
0:08:09.788,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile

147
0:08:11.966,000 --> 0:08:13,000
hosts the two-and-a-half-meter telescope, the du Pont.

148
0:08:15.734,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Two and a half meters is the size of our mirror,

149
0:08:18.361,000 --> 0:08:2,000
which was huge for Tycho and Kepler.

150
0:08:20.412,000 --> 0:08:21,000
But it's actually not so big today.

151
0:08:22.25,000 --> 0:08:24,000
There are way bigger telescopes out there.

152
0:08:24.671,000 --> 0:08:29,000
But in SDSS we use new instruments on these old telescopes

153
0:08:29.827,000 --> 0:08:3,000
to make them interesting.

154
0:08:32.422,000 --> 0:08:36,000
We capture light from all of those objects into our aperture,

155
0:08:37.109,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and that light is then focused at the focal plane,

156
0:08:40.061,000 --> 0:08:42,000
where our instruments sit and process that light.

157
0:08:42.831,000 --> 0:08:43,000
What's new in SDSS-V

158
0:08:44.789,000 --> 0:08:47,000
is that we're making the focal plane entirely robotic.

159
0:08:49.051,000 --> 0:08:51,000
That's right: robots.

160
0:08:51.183,000 --> 0:08:52,000
(Laughter)

161
0:08:53.019,000 --> 0:08:55,000
So I'm going to show them to you,

162
0:08:55.149,000 --> 0:08:58,000
but they're fierce and terrifying,

163
0:08:58.806,000 --> 0:09:,000
and I want you all to just take a breath.

164
0:09:01.45,000 --> 0:09:02,000
(Exhales) Trigger warning.

165
0:09:03.722,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And with no apologies to all the Blade Runners among you,

166
0:09:08.516,000 --> 0:09:09,000
here they are.

167
0:09:09.897,000 --> 0:09:1,000
(Laughter)

168
0:09:11.634,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I have 1,000 of these,

169
0:09:13.053,000 --> 0:09:16,000
500 in the focal plane of each telescope in each hemisphere.

170
0:09:18.061,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And this is how they move on the sky.

171
0:09:20.411,000 --> 0:09:22,000
So these are our objects and a star field,

172
0:09:22.722,000 --> 0:09:24,000
so you've got stars, galaxies, black holes.

173
0:09:24.921,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And our robots move to those objects as we pass over them

174
0:09:29.897,000 --> 0:09:3,000
in order to capture the light

175
0:09:31.506,000 --> 0:09:34,000
from those stars and galaxies and black holes, and yes,

176
0:09:35.411,000 --> 0:09:37,000
it is weird to capture black hole light,

177
0:09:37.649,000 --> 0:09:39,000
but we've already gone over that black holes are weird.

178
0:09:42.475,000 --> 0:09:43,000
One more thing.

179
0:09:44.966,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Stars are exploding all the time,

180
0:09:47.451,000 --> 0:09:5,000
like this one did back in 1987 in our cosmic backyard.

181
0:09:53.427,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Black holes are growing all the time.

182
0:09:59.088,000 --> 0:10:02,000
There is a new sky every night.

183
0:10:03.438,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Which means we can't just map the sky one time.

184
0:10:06.795,000 --> 0:10:08,000
We have to map the sky multiple times.

185
0:10:10.782,000 --> 0:10:14,000
So in SDSS-V, we're going back to each part of the sky multiple times

186
0:10:15.035,000 --> 0:10:18,000
in order to see how these objects change over time.

187
0:10:18.416,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Because those changes in time encode the physics,

188
0:10:21.724,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and they encode how these objects are growing and changing.

189
0:10:27.399,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Mow the sky.

190
0:10:30.177,000 --> 0:10:31,000
OK, let me just recap.

191
0:10:32.744,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Global survey, two hemispheres,

192
0:10:36.537,000 --> 0:10:41,000
five telescopes, 10 spectrographs, millions of objects, mow the sky,

193
0:10:41.617,000 --> 0:10:43,000
creative army, robots, yeah.

194
0:10:44.561,000 --> 0:10:45,000
So you're thinking, "Wow.

195
0:10:46.253,000 --> 0:10:48,000
She must have this industrial machine going,

196
0:10:48.982,000 --> 0:10:51,000
no room for the individual, curious, lone wolf genius," right?

197
0:10:52.847,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And you'd be 100 percent wrong.

198
0:10:55.234,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Meet Hanny's Voorwerp.

199
0:10:57.274,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Hanny van Arkel was a Dutch schoolteacher

200
0:10:59.528,000 --> 0:11:02,000
who was analyzing the public versions of the SDSS data,

201
0:11:03.448,000 --> 0:11:06,000
when she found this incredibly rare type of object,

202
0:11:07.272,000 --> 0:11:09,000
which is now a subject of major study.

203
0:11:10.621,000 --> 0:11:11,000
She was able to do this

204
0:11:12.195,000 --> 0:11:16,000
because SDSS, since its beginning and by mandate from the Sloan Foundation,

205
0:11:16.744,000 --> 0:11:18,000
has made its data both publicly available

206
0:11:19.403,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and usable to a broad range of audiences.

207
0:11:23.792,000 --> 0:11:25,000
She's a citizen -- yeah, clap for that.

208
0:11:26.561,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Clap for that.

209
0:11:27.736,000 --> 0:11:3,000
(Applause)

210
0:11:31.006,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Hanny is a citizen scientist,

211
0:11:32.562,000 --> 0:11:33,000
or as I like to call them,

212
0:11:34.37,000 --> 0:11:35,000
"citizen warriors."

213
0:11:36.284,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And she shows that you don't have to be a fancy astrophysicist to participate.

214
0:11:43.037,000 --> 0:11:44,000
You just have to be curious.

215
0:11:46.425,000 --> 0:11:47,000
A few years ago,

216
0:11:48.023,000 --> 0:11:51,000
my four-year-old asked, "Can moons have moons?"

217
0:11:51.989,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And I set about to answer this question

218
0:11:53.982,000 --> 0:11:56,000
because even though many four-year-olds over all of time

219
0:11:57.593,000 --> 0:11:59,000
have probably asked this question,

220
0:11:59.63,000 --> 0:12:02,000
many experts, including myself, didn't know the answer.

221
0:12:04.157,000 --> 0:12:07,000
These are the moons in our solar system that can host hypothetical submoons.

222
0:12:08.491,000 --> 0:12:12,000
And that just goes to show you that there are so many basic questions

223
0:12:12.53,000 --> 0:12:14,000
left to be understood.

224
0:12:17.665,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And this brings me to the most important point about SDSS.

225
0:12:23.036,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Because, yeah, the stars, the galaxies, the black holes, the robots --

226
0:12:27.14,000 --> 0:12:28,000
that's all super cool.

227
0:12:30.879,000 --> 0:12:32,000
But the coolest thing of all

228
0:12:32.966,000 --> 0:12:35,000
is that eensy-weensy creatures on a rubble pile

229
0:12:36.234,000 --> 0:12:39,000
around a totally average star in a totally average galaxy

230
0:12:40.087,000 --> 0:12:43,000
can win the battle to understand their world.

231
0:12:44.714,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Every dot in this video is a galaxy.

232
0:12:51.323,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Every dot.

233
0:12:59.553,000 --> 0:13:05,000
(Cheers) (Applause)

234
0:13:06.339,000 --> 0:13:07,000
I'm showing here the number of galaxies

235
0:13:08.253,000 --> 0:13:11,000
that astronomers have mapped in large surveys since about 1980.

236
0:13:12.109,000 --> 0:13:14,000
You can see SDSS kick in around Y2K.

237
0:13:15.921,000 --> 0:13:17,000
If we stay on this line,

238
0:13:18.525,000 --> 0:13:23,000
we will map every large galaxy in the observable universe by 2060.

239
0:13:25.406,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Think about that.

240
0:13:26.784,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Think about it: we've gone from arranging clamshells

241
0:13:30.934,000 --> 0:13:34,000
to general relativity to SDSS in a few thousand years --

242
0:13:35.045,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and if we hang on 40 more,

243
0:13:39.077,000 --> 0:13:41,000
we can map all the galaxies.

244
0:13:41.859,000 --> 0:13:42,000
But we have to stay on the line.

245
0:13:44.557,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Will that be our choice?

246
0:13:48.684,000 --> 0:13:5,000
There are dark forces in this world

247
0:13:51.347,000 --> 0:13:57,000
that will rob our entire species of our right to understand our universe.

248
0:13:58.466,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Don't be afraid of the dark.

249
0:14:00.498,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Fight back.

250
0:14:02.173,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Join us.

251
0:14:03.387,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Thank you.

252
0:14:04.561,000 --> 0:14:1,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:13.38,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So, asking for help is basically the worst, right?

3
0:00:18.357,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I've actually never seen it on one of those top ten lists

4
0:00:22.333,000 --> 0:00:23,000
of things people fear,

5
0:00:24.032,000 --> 0:00:26,000
like public speaking

6
0:00:26.159,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and death,

7
0:00:27.855,000 --> 0:00:29,000
but I'm pretty sure it actually belongs there.

8
0:00:31.146,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Even though in many ways it's foolish for us to be afraid to admit we need help,

9
0:00:36.046,000 --> 0:00:4,000
whether it's from a loved one or a friend or from a coworker

10
0:00:40.804,000 --> 0:00:41,000
or even from a stranger,

11
0:00:42.811,000 --> 0:00:47,000
somehow it always feel just a little bit uncomfortable and embarrassing

12
0:00:47.967,000 --> 0:00:49,000
to actually ask for help,

13
0:00:50.034,000 --> 0:00:53,000
which is, of course, why most of us try to avoid asking for help

14
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
whenever humanly possible.

15
0:00:55.4,000 --> 0:00:58,000
My father was one of those legions of fathers

16
0:00:58.856,000 --> 0:01:03,000
who, I swear, would rather drive through an alligator-infested swamp

17
0:01:04.263,000 --> 0:01:07,000
than actually ask someone for help getting back to the road.

18
0:01:07.693,000 --> 0:01:1,000
When I was a kid, we took a family vacation.

19
0:01:10.811,000 --> 0:01:13,000
We drove from our home in South Jersey to Colonial Williamsburg.

20
0:01:14.958,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And I remember we got really badly lost.

21
0:01:17.727,000 --> 0:01:19,000
My mother and I pleaded with him

22
0:01:20.302,000 --> 0:01:24,000
to please just pull over and ask someone for directions back to the highway,

23
0:01:24.821,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and he absolutely refused,

24
0:01:26.978,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and, in fact, assured us that we were not lost,

25
0:01:29.91,000 --> 0:01:31,000
he had just always wanted to know what was over here.

26
0:01:32.902,000 --> 0:01:33,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:34.891,000 --> 0:01:36,000
So if we're going to ask for help --

28
0:01:37.285,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and we have to, we all do, practically every day --

29
0:01:41.849,000 --> 0:01:44,000
the only way we're going to even begin to get comfortable with it

30
0:01:45.055,000 --> 0:01:46,000
is to get good at it,

31
0:01:46.948,000 --> 0:01:49,000
to actually increase the chances that when you ask for help from someone,

32
0:01:50.519,000 --> 0:01:52,000
they're actually going to say yes.

33
0:01:52.884,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And not only that, but they're going to find it actually satisfying

34
0:01:56.298,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and rewarding to help you,

35
0:01:57.972,000 --> 0:02:01,000
because that way, they'll be motivated to continue to help you into the future.

36
0:02:02.902,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So research that I and some of my colleagues have done

37
0:02:05.543,000 --> 0:02:09,000
has shed a lot of light on why it is that sometimes people say yes

38
0:02:09.604,000 --> 0:02:1,000
to our requests for help

39
0:02:10.962,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and why sometimes they say no.

40
0:02:13.479,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Now let me just start by saying right now:

41
0:02:16.518,000 --> 0:02:17,000
if you need help,

42
0:02:18.088,000 --> 0:02:21,000
you are going to have to ask for it.

43
0:02:21.265,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Out loud.

44
0:02:22.565,000 --> 0:02:23,000
OK?

45
0:02:23.742,000 --> 0:02:26,000
We all, to some extent, suffer from something that psychologists call

46
0:02:27.068,000 --> 0:02:29,000
"the illusion of transparency" --

47
0:02:29.355,000 --> 0:02:3,000
basically, the mistaken belief

48
0:02:31.049,000 --> 0:02:33,000
that our thoughts and our feelings and our needs

49
0:02:33.972,000 --> 0:02:35,000
are really obvious to other people.

50
0:02:37.348,000 --> 0:02:38,000
This is not true, but we believe it.

51
0:02:39.222,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And so, we just mostly stand around waiting for someone to notice our needs

52
0:02:43.281,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and then spontaneously offer to help us with it.

53
0:02:46.238,000 --> 0:02:48,000
This is a really, really bad assumption.

54
0:02:48.741,000 --> 0:02:51,000
In fact, not only is it very difficult to tell what your needs are,

55
0:02:52.423,000 --> 0:02:55,000
but even the people close to you often struggle to understand

56
0:02:55.744,000 --> 0:02:57,000
how they can support you.

57
0:02:57.817,000 --> 0:02:59,000
My partner has actually had to adopt a habit

58
0:03:00.52,000 --> 0:03:02,000
of asking me multiple times a day,

59
0:03:03.272,000 --> 0:03:05,000
"Are you OK? Do you need anything?"

60
0:03:05.298,000 --> 0:03:09,000
because I am so, so bad at signaling when I need someone's help.

61
0:03:10.085,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Now, he is more patient than I deserve

62
0:03:12.669,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and much more proactive, much more, about helping

63
0:03:16.475,000 --> 0:03:19,000
than any of us have any right to expect other people to be.

64
0:03:20.239,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So if you need help, you're going to have to ask for it.

65
0:03:22.98,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And by the way, even when someone can tell that you need help,

66
0:03:26.424,000 --> 0:03:28,000
how do they know that you want it?

67
0:03:29.1,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Did you ever try to give unsolicited help to someone who, it turns out,

68
0:03:32.979,000 --> 0:03:34,000
did not actually want your help in the first place?

69
0:03:35.44,000 --> 0:03:37,000
They get nasty real quick, don't they?

70
0:03:38.284,000 --> 0:03:4,000
The other day -- true story --

71
0:03:40.884,000 --> 0:03:42,000
my teenage daughter was getting dressed for school,

72
0:03:43.333,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and I decided to give her some unsolicited help about that.

73
0:03:46.414,000 --> 0:03:47,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:47.468,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I happen to think she looks amazing in brighter colors.

75
0:03:50.452,000 --> 0:03:53,000
She tends to prefer sort of darker, more neutral tones.

76
0:03:54.207,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And so I said, very helpfully,

77
0:03:56.668,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that I thought maybe she could go back upstairs

78
0:03:59.224,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and try to find something a little less somber.

79
0:04:02.171,000 --> 0:04:03,000
(Laughter)

80
0:04:04.143,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So, if looks could kill,

81
0:04:06.915,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I would not be standing here right now.

82
0:04:09.365,000 --> 0:04:14,000
We really can't blame other people for not just spontaneously offering to help us

83
0:04:14.619,000 --> 0:04:17,000
when we don't actually know that that's what is wanted.

84
0:04:17.838,000 --> 0:04:18,000
In fact, actually, research shows

85
0:04:19.616,000 --> 0:04:23,000
that 90 percent of the help that coworkers give one another in the workplace

86
0:04:24.243,000 --> 0:04:27,000
is in response to explicit requests for help.

87
0:04:28.052,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So you're going to have to say the words "I need your help." Right?

88
0:04:31.507,000 --> 0:04:32,000
There's no getting around it.

89
0:04:33.158,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Now, to be good at it,

90
0:04:34.42,000 --> 0:04:37,000
to make sure that people actually do help you when you ask for it,

91
0:04:37.645,000 --> 0:04:4,000
there are a few other things that are very helpful to keep in mind.

92
0:04:41.047,000 --> 0:04:44,000
First thing: when you ask for help,

93
0:04:44.123,000 --> 0:04:48,000
be very, very specific about the help you want and why.

94
0:04:49.718,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Vague, sort of indirect requests for help

95
0:04:53.324,000 --> 0:04:56,000
actually aren't very helpful to the helper, right?

96
0:04:56.511,000 --> 0:04:59,000
We don't actually know what it is you want from us,

97
0:04:59.548,000 --> 0:05:,000
and, just as important,

98
0:05:01.228,000 --> 0:05:03,000
we don't know whether or not we can be successful

99
0:05:03.893,000 --> 0:05:04,000
in giving you the help.

100
0:05:05.101,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Nobody wants to give bad help.

101
0:05:07.512,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Like me, you probably get some of these requests

102
0:05:10.403,000 --> 0:05:13,000
from perfectly pleasant strangers on LinkedIn

103
0:05:13.684,000 --> 0:05:17,000
who want to do things like "get together over coffee and connect"

104
0:05:18.656,000 --> 0:05:2,000
or "pick your brain."

105
0:05:21.327,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I ignore these requests literally every time.

106
0:05:24.767,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And it's not that I'm not a nice person.

107
0:05:26.986,000 --> 0:05:28,000
It's just that when I don't know what it is you want from me,

108
0:05:29.907,000 --> 0:05:31,000
like the kind of help you're hoping that can I provide,

109
0:05:32.69,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I'm not interested.

110
0:05:34.35,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Nobody is.

111
0:05:35.729,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I'd have been much more interested if they had just come out and said

112
0:05:39.092,000 --> 0:05:41,000
whatever it is was they were hoping to get from me,

113
0:05:41.565,000 --> 0:05:43,000
because I'm pretty sure they had something specific in mind.

114
0:05:44.489,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So go ahead and say,

115
0:05:45.683,000 --> 0:05:48,000
"I'm hoping to discuss opportunities to work in your company,"

116
0:05:48.791,000 --> 0:05:5,000
or, "I'd like to propose a joint research project

117
0:05:51.796,000 --> 0:05:53,000
in an area I know you're interested in,"

118
0:05:54.365,000 --> 0:05:57,000
or, "I'd like your advice on getting into medical school."

119
0:05:58.343,000 --> 0:06:,000
Technically, I can't help you with that last one

120
0:06:00.667,000 --> 0:06:01,000
because I'm not that kind of doctor,

121
0:06:02.438,000 --> 0:06:05,000
but I could point you in the direction of someone who could.

122
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
OK, second tip.

123
0:06:07.873,000 --> 0:06:08,000
This is really important:

124
0:06:10.054,000 --> 0:06:14,000
please avoid disclaimers, apologies and bribes.

125
0:06:15.214,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Really, really important.

126
0:06:16.484,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Do any of these sound familiar?

127
0:06:18.63,000 --> 0:06:19,000
(Clears throat)

128
0:06:20.949,000 --> 0:06:24,000
'I'm so, so sorry that I have to ask you for this."

129
0:06:25.337,000 --> 0:06:28,000
"I really hate bothering you with this."

130
0:06:28.844,000 --> 0:06:33,000
"If I had any way of doing this without your help, I would."

131
0:06:34.18,000 --> 0:06:35,000
(Laughter)

132
0:06:35.227,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Sometimes it feels like people are so eager to prove

133
0:06:38.375,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that they're not weak and greedy when they ask your for help,

134
0:06:41.512,000 --> 0:06:43,000
they're completely missing out on how uncomfortable

135
0:06:44.371,000 --> 0:06:45,000
they're making you feel.

136
0:06:45.953,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And by the way -- how am I supposed to find it satisfying to help you

137
0:06:49.324,000 --> 0:06:52,000
if you really hated having to ask me for help?

138
0:06:53.198,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And while it is perfectly, perfectly acceptable

139
0:06:56.179,000 --> 0:06:59,000
to pay strangers to do things for you,

140
0:06:59.626,000 --> 0:07:02,000
you need to be very, very careful when it comes to incentivizing

141
0:07:03.535,000 --> 0:07:05,000
your friends and coworkers.

142
0:07:05.767,000 --> 0:07:07,000
When you have a relationship with someone,

143
0:07:07.888,000 --> 0:07:1,000
helping one another is actually a natural part of that relationship.

144
0:07:11.304,000 --> 0:07:13,000
It's how we show one another that we care.

145
0:07:13.936,000 --> 0:07:16,000
If you introduce incentives or payments into that,

146
0:07:17.612,000 --> 0:07:2,000
what can happen is, it starts to feel like it isn't a relationship,

147
0:07:21.312,000 --> 0:07:22,000
it's a transaction.

148
0:07:23.128,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And that actually is experienced as distancing,

149
0:07:25.696,000 --> 0:07:28,000
which, ironically, makes people less likely to help you.

150
0:07:29.702,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So a spontaneous gift

151
0:07:31.674,000 --> 0:07:34,000
after someone gives you some help to show your appreciation and gratitude --

152
0:07:35.539,000 --> 0:07:36,000
perfectly fine.

153
0:07:37.043,000 --> 0:07:4,000
An offer to pay your best friend to help you move into your new apartment

154
0:07:41.002,000 --> 0:07:42,000
is not.

155
0:07:42.62,000 --> 0:07:43,000
OK, third rule,

156
0:07:44.091,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and I really mean this one:

157
0:07:45.825,000 --> 0:07:47,000
please do not ask for help

158
0:07:48.527,000 --> 0:07:5,000
over email or text.

159
0:07:51.351,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Really, seriously, please don't.

160
0:07:53.988,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Email and text are impersonal.

161
0:07:56.206,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I realize sometimes there's no alternative,

162
0:07:58.996,000 --> 0:08:,000
but mostly what happens is,

163
0:08:01.512,000 --> 0:08:03,000
we like to ask for help over email and text

164
0:08:04.509,000 --> 0:08:07,000
because it feels less awkward for us to do so.

165
0:08:08.73,000 --> 0:08:11,000
You know what else feels less awkward over email and text?

166
0:08:12.499,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Telling you no.

167
0:08:14.337,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And it turns out, there's research to support this.

168
0:08:17.214,000 --> 0:08:22,000
In-person requests for help are 30 times more likely to get a yes

169
0:08:22.98,000 --> 0:08:23,000
than a request made by email.

170
0:08:25.313,000 --> 0:08:28,000
So when something is really important and you really need someone's help,

171
0:08:28.855,000 --> 0:08:3,000
make face time to make the request,

172
0:08:31.703,000 --> 0:08:34,000
or use your phone as a phone --

173
0:08:34.867,000 --> 0:08:35,000
(Laughter)

174
0:08:36.731,000 --> 0:08:38,000
to ask for the help that you need.

175
0:08:39.079,000 --> 0:08:4,000
OK.

176
0:08:40.775,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Last one, and this is actually a really, really important one

177
0:08:44.525,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and probably the one that is most overlooked

178
0:08:46.641,000 --> 0:08:47,000
when it comes to asking for help:

179
0:08:48.301,000 --> 0:08:51,000
when you ask someone for their help and they say yes,

180
0:08:51.433,000 --> 0:08:53,000
follow up with them afterward.

181
0:08:54.109,000 --> 0:08:57,000
There's a common misconception that what's rewarding about helping

182
0:08:57.882,000 --> 0:08:59,000
is the act of helping itself.

183
0:09:00.249,000 --> 0:09:01,000
This is not true.

184
0:09:01.691,000 --> 0:09:05,000
What is rewarding about helping is knowing that your help landed,

185
0:09:05.828,000 --> 0:09:06,000
that it had impact,

186
0:09:07.28,000 --> 0:09:08,000
that you were effective.

187
0:09:09.358,000 --> 0:09:12,000
If I have no idea how my help affected you,

188
0:09:13.12,000 --> 0:09:14,000
how am I supposed to feel about it?

189
0:09:14.826,000 --> 0:09:16,000
This happened; I was a university professor for many years,

190
0:09:17.676,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I wrote lots and lots of letters of recommendation

191
0:09:20.124,000 --> 0:09:22,000
for people to get jobs or to go into graduate school.

192
0:09:22.907,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And probably about 95 percent of them,

193
0:09:25.242,000 --> 0:09:27,000
I have no idea what happened.

194
0:09:27.347,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Now, how do I feel about the time and effort I took to do that,

195
0:09:30.926,000 --> 0:09:32,000
when I really have no idea if I helped you,

196
0:09:33.503,000 --> 0:09:35,000
if it actually helped you get the thing that you wanted?

197
0:09:36.407,000 --> 0:09:38,000
In fact, this idea of feeling effective

198
0:09:38.97,000 --> 0:09:43,000
is part of why certain kinds of donor appeals are so, so persuasive --

199
0:09:44.628,000 --> 0:09:46,000
because they allow you to really vividly imagine

200
0:09:47.383,000 --> 0:09:49,000
the effect that your help is going to have.

201
0:09:49.569,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Take something like DonorsChoose.

202
0:09:52.068,000 --> 0:09:55,000
You go online, you can choose the individual teacher by name

203
0:09:55.72,000 --> 0:09:57,000
whose classroom you're going to be able to help

204
0:09:58.236,000 --> 0:10:01,000
by literally buying the specific items they've requested,

205
0:10:01.452,000 --> 0:10:05,000
like microscopes or laptops or flexible seating.

206
0:10:05.748,000 --> 0:10:08,000
An appeal like that makes it so easy for me to imagine

207
0:10:09.219,000 --> 0:10:1,000
the good that my money will do,

208
0:10:10.791,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that I actually get an immediate sense of effectiveness

209
0:10:13.422,000 --> 0:10:14,000
the minute I commit to giving.

210
0:10:15.318,000 --> 0:10:16,000
But you know what else they do?

211
0:10:16.873,000 --> 0:10:17,000
They follow up.

212
0:10:18.499,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Donors actually get letters from the kids in the classroom.

213
0:10:22.048,000 --> 0:10:23,000
They get pictures.

214
0:10:23.548,000 --> 0:10:25,000
They get to know that they made a difference.

215
0:10:26.065,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And this is something we need to all be doing in our everyday lives,

216
0:10:29.356,000 --> 0:10:32,000
especially if we want people to continue to give us help

217
0:10:32.449,000 --> 0:10:33,000
over the long term.

218
0:10:34.341,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Take time to tell your colleague that the help that they gave you

219
0:10:37.742,000 --> 0:10:39,000
really helped you land that big sale,

220
0:10:39.826,000 --> 0:10:42,000
or helped you get that interview that you were really hoping to get.

221
0:10:43.313,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Take time to tell your partner that the support they gave you

222
0:10:46.494,000 --> 0:10:48,000
really made it possible for you to get through a tough time.

223
0:10:50.096,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Take time to tell your catsitter

224
0:10:52.453,000 --> 0:10:54,000
that you're super happy that for some reason,

225
0:10:55.376,000 --> 0:10:58,000
this time the cats didn't break anything while you were away,

226
0:10:58.529,000 --> 0:11:,000
and so they must have done a really good job.

227
0:11:02.149,000 --> 0:11:03,000
The bottom line is:

228
0:11:03.524,000 --> 0:11:05,000
I know -- believe me, I know --

229
0:11:05.985,000 --> 0:11:07,000
that it is not easy to ask for help.

230
0:11:09.348,000 --> 0:11:11,000
We are all a little bit afraid to do it.

231
0:11:11.45,000 --> 0:11:12,000
It makes us feel vulnerable.

232
0:11:13.921,000 --> 0:11:17,000
But the reality of modern work and modern life

233
0:11:18.018,000 --> 0:11:2,000
is that nobody does it alone.

234
0:11:20.372,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Nobody succeeds in a vacuum.

235
0:11:22.399,000 --> 0:11:26,000
More than ever, we actually do have to rely on other people,

236
0:11:26.495,000 --> 0:11:29,000
on their support and collaboration, in order to be successful.

237
0:11:30.993,000 --> 0:11:34,000
So when you need help, ask for it out loud.

238
0:11:35.172,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And when you do, do it in a way that increases your chances

239
0:11:38.454,000 --> 0:11:39,000
that you'll get a yes

240
0:11:39.968,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and makes the other person feel awesome for having helped you,

241
0:11:44.554,000 --> 0:11:45,000
because you both deserve it.

242
0:11:46.604,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Thank you.

243
0:11:47.906,000 --> 0:11:49,000
(Applause)

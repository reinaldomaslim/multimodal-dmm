2
0:00:16.098,000 --> 0:00:2,000
In the past several days, I heard people talking about China.

3
0:00:20.709,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And also, I talked to friends about China and Chinese Internet.

4
0:00:24.663,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Something is very challenging to me.

5
0:00:27.126,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I want to make my friends understand:

6
0:00:30.187,000 --> 0:00:33,000
China is complicated.

7
0:00:33.755,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So I always want to tell the story, like,

8
0:00:35.85,000 --> 0:00:38,000
one hand it is that, the other hand is that.

9
0:00:39.306,000 --> 0:00:41,000
You can't just tell a one sided story.

10
0:00:42.092,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I'll give an example. China is a BRIC country.

11
0:00:45.273,000 --> 0:00:5,000
BRIC country means Brazil, Russia, India and China.

12
0:00:50.683,000 --> 0:00:55,000
This emerging economy really is helping the revival of the world economy.

13
0:00:56.509,000 --> 0:00:59,000
But at the same time, on the other hand,

14
0:00:59.678,000 --> 0:01:01,000
China is a SICK country,

15
0:01:02.582,000 --> 0:01:07,000
the terminology coined by Facebook IPO papers -- file.

16
0:01:08.538,000 --> 0:01:14,000
He said the SICK country means Syria, Iran, China and North Korea.

17
0:01:14.82,000 --> 0:01:18,000
The four countries have no access to Facebook.

18
0:01:19.5,000 --> 0:01:23,000
So basically, China is a SICK BRIC country.

19
0:01:23.618,000 --> 0:01:23,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:24.612,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Another project was built up

21
0:01:26.507,000 --> 0:01:28,000
to watch China and Chinese Internet.

22
0:01:29.351,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And now, today I want to tell you my personal

23
0:01:32.734,000 --> 0:01:37,000
observation in the past several years, from that wall.

24
0:01:37.966,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So, if you are a fan of the Game of Thrones,

25
0:01:41.527,000 --> 0:01:45,000
you definitely know how important a big wall is for an old kingdom.

26
0:01:46.51,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It prevents weird things from the north.

27
0:01:51.386,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Same was true for China.

28
0:01:54.583,000 --> 0:01:57,000
In the north, there was a great wall, Chang Cheng.

29
0:01:58.143,000 --> 0:02:03,000
It protected China from invaders for 2,000 years.

30
0:02:03.515,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But China also has a great firewall.

31
0:02:07.578,000 --> 0:02:11,000
That's the biggest digital boundary in the whole world.

32
0:02:11.907,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It's not only to defend the Chinese regime from overseas,

33
0:02:16.232,000 --> 0:02:19,000
from the universal values, but also to prevent

34
0:02:19.936,000 --> 0:02:22,000
China's own citizens to access the global free Internet,

35
0:02:23.611,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and even separate themselves into blocks, not united.

36
0:02:28.899,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So, basically the "Internet" has two Internets.

37
0:02:33.045,000 --> 0:02:36,000
One is the Internet, the other is the Chinanet.

38
0:02:37.037,000 --> 0:02:4,000
But if you think the Chinanet is something

39
0:02:40.829,000 --> 0:02:46,000
like a deadland, wasteland, I think it's wrong.

40
0:02:47.351,000 --> 0:02:52,000
But we also use a very simple metaphor, the cat and the mouse game,

41
0:02:53.088,000 --> 0:02:56,000
to describe in the past 15 years

42
0:02:56.111,000 --> 0:02:59,000
the continuing fight between Chinese

43
0:02:59.511,000 --> 0:03:02,000
censorship, government censorship, the cat,

44
0:03:02.791,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and the Chinese Internet users. That means us, the mouse.

45
0:03:08.943,000 --> 0:03:12,000
But sometimes this kind of a metaphor is too simple.

46
0:03:13.136,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So today I want to upgrade it to 2.0 version.

47
0:03:18.571,000 --> 0:03:21,000
In China, we have 500 million Internet users.

48
0:03:22.333,000 --> 0:03:26,000
That's the biggest population of Netizens, Internet users, in the whole world.

49
0:03:27.188,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So even though China's is a totally censored Internet,

50
0:03:32.699,000 --> 0:03:35,000
but still, Chinese Internet society is really booming.

51
0:03:36.293,000 --> 0:03:38,000
How to make it? It's simple.

52
0:03:39.003,000 --> 0:03:41,000
You have Google, we have Baidu.

53
0:03:41.704,000 --> 0:03:44,000
You have Twitter, we have Weibo.

54
0:03:44.818,000 --> 0:03:47,000
You have Facebook, we have Renren.

55
0:03:47.843,000 --> 0:03:52,000
You have YouTube, we have Youku and Tudou.

56
0:03:53.176,000 --> 0:03:57,000
The Chinese government blocked every

57
0:03:57.706,000 --> 0:04:,000
single international Web 2.0 service,

58
0:04:01.417,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and we Chinese copycat every one.

59
0:04:04.233,000 --> 0:04:05,000
(Laughter)

60
0:04:05.626,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So, that's the kind of the thing I call smart censorship.

61
0:04:10.241,000 --> 0:04:13,000
That's not only to censor you.

62
0:04:13.809,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Sometimes this Chinese national Internet policy is very simple:

63
0:04:18.408,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Block and clone.

64
0:04:20.795,000 --> 0:04:25,000
On the one hand, he wants to satisfy people's need of a social network,

65
0:04:25.899,000 --> 0:04:28,000
which is very important; people really love social networking.

66
0:04:29.179,000 --> 0:04:31,000
But on the other hand, they want to keep the server

67
0:04:32.004,000 --> 0:04:36,000
in Beijing so they can access the data any time they want.

68
0:04:36.534,000 --> 0:04:4,000
That's also the reason Google was pulled out from China,

69
0:04:40.782,000 --> 0:04:41,000
because they can't accept the fact

70
0:04:42.591,000 --> 0:04:46,000
that Chinese government wants to keep the server.

71
0:04:47.39,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Sometimes the Arab dictators didn't understand these two hands.

72
0:04:52.818,000 --> 0:04:55,000
For example, Mubarak, he shut down the Internet.

73
0:04:56.571,000 --> 0:04:59,000
He wanted to prevent the Netizens [from criticizing] him.

74
0:04:59.683,000 --> 0:05:04,000
But once Netizens can't go online, they go in the street.

75
0:05:05.373,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And now the result is very simple.

76
0:05:08.653,000 --> 0:05:13,000
We all know Mubarak is technically dead.

77
0:05:14.263,000 --> 0:05:18,000
But also, Ben Ali, Tunisian president,

78
0:05:18.775,000 --> 0:05:19,000
didn't follow the second rule.

79
0:05:20.701,000 --> 0:05:23,000
That means keep the server in your hands.

80
0:05:24.654,000 --> 0:05:29,000
He allowed Facebook, a U.S.-based service,

81
0:05:30.499,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to continue to stay on inside of Tunisia.

82
0:05:33.901,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So he can't prevent it, his own citizens to post

83
0:05:37.473,000 --> 0:05:39,000
critical videos against his corruption.

84
0:05:40.125,000 --> 0:05:44,000
The same thing happend. He was the first

85
0:05:44.174,000 --> 0:05:47,000
to topple during the Arab Spring.

86
0:05:47.191,000 --> 0:05:52,000
But those two very smart international censorship policies

87
0:05:52.341,000 --> 0:05:58,000
didn't prevent Chinese social media [from] becoming a really public sphere,

88
0:05:58.678,000 --> 0:06:03,000
a pathway of public opinion and the nightmare of Chinese officials.

89
0:06:04.351,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Because we have 300 million microbloggers in China.

90
0:06:08.879,000 --> 0:06:11,000
It's the entire population of the United States.

91
0:06:12.711,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So when these 300 million people, microbloggers,

92
0:06:16.575,000 --> 0:06:2,000
even they block the tweet in our censored platform.

93
0:06:21.343,000 --> 0:06:24,000
But itself -- the Chinanet -- but itself can create

94
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
very powerful energy, which has never happened

95
0:06:29.425,000 --> 0:06:3,000
in the Chinese history.

96
0:06:31.079,000 --> 0:06:35,000
2011, in July, two [unclear] trains crashed,

97
0:06:35.775,000 --> 0:06:37,000
in Wenzhou, a southern city.

98
0:06:38.031,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Right after the train crash,

99
0:06:39.655,000 --> 0:06:44,000
authorities literally wanted to cover up the train, bury the train.

100
0:06:44.671,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So it angered the Chinese Netizens.

101
0:06:46.887,000 --> 0:06:49,000
The first five days after the train crash,

102
0:06:49.95,000 --> 0:06:53,000
there were 10 million criticisms of the posting

103
0:06:54.095,000 --> 0:06:57,000
on social media, which never happened in Chinese history.

104
0:06:57.848,000 --> 0:07:,000
And later this year, the rail minister

105
0:07:01.176,000 --> 0:07:06,000
was sacked and sentenced to jail for 10 years.

106
0:07:06.642,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And also, recently, very funny debate between

107
0:07:11.689,000 --> 0:07:14,000
the Beijing Environment Ministry

108
0:07:14.985,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and the American Embassy in Beijing

109
0:07:18.353,000 --> 0:07:2,000
because the Ministry blamed

110
0:07:20.818,000 --> 0:07:22,000
the American Embassy for intervening in

111
0:07:22.963,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Chinese internal politics by disclosing

112
0:07:26.392,000 --> 0:07:28,000
the air quality data of Beijing.

113
0:07:29.076,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So, the up is the Embassy data, the PM 2.5.

114
0:07:35.964,000 --> 0:07:4,000
He showed 148, they showed it's dangerous for the sensitive group.

115
0:07:41.908,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So a suggestion, it's not good to go outside.

116
0:07:45.71,000 --> 0:07:5,000
But that is the Ministry's data. He shows 50.

117
0:07:51.334,000 --> 0:07:54,000
He says it's good. It's good to go outside.

118
0:07:54.686,000 --> 0:07:57,000
But 99 percent of Chinese microbloggers

119
0:07:58.23,000 --> 0:08:01,000
stand firmly on the Embassy's side.

120
0:08:01.99,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I live in Beijing. Every day, I just watch

121
0:08:06.662,000 --> 0:08:14,000
the American Embassy's data to decide whether I should open my window.

122
0:08:15.393,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Why is Chinese social networking, even within the censorship,

123
0:08:19.684,000 --> 0:08:23,000
so booming? Part of the reason is Chinese languages.

124
0:08:23.928,000 --> 0:08:26,000
You know, Twitter and Twitter clones have a kind of

125
0:08:27.6,000 --> 0:08:29,000
a limitation of 140 characters.

126
0:08:30.065,000 --> 0:08:34,000
But in English it's 20 words or a sentence with a short link.

127
0:08:34.264,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Maybe in Germany, in German language, it may be just "Aha!"

128
0:08:37.512,000 --> 0:08:39,000
(Laughter)

129
0:08:40.046,000 --> 0:08:45,000
But in Chinese language, it's really about 140 characters,

130
0:08:45.791,000 --> 0:08:47,000
means a paragraph, a story.

131
0:08:48.467,000 --> 0:08:52,000
You can almost have all the journalistic elements there.

132
0:08:52.705,000 --> 0:08:55,000
For example, this is Hamlet, of Shakespeare.

133
0:08:56.392,000 --> 0:08:59,000
It's the same content. One, you can see exactly

134
0:09:00.183,000 --> 0:09:06,000
one Chinese tweet is equal to 3.5 English tweets.

135
0:09:06.696,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Chinese is always cheating, right?

136
0:09:09.953,000 --> 0:09:12,000
So because of this, the Chinese really regard this

137
0:09:13.866,000 --> 0:09:18,000
microblogging as a media, not only a headline to media.

138
0:09:18.947,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And also, the clone, Sina company is

139
0:09:22.658,000 --> 0:09:24,000
the guy who cloned Twitter.

140
0:09:24.745,000 --> 0:09:26,000
It even has its own name, with Weibo.

141
0:09:27.166,000 --> 0:09:29,000
"Weibo" is the Chinese translation for "microblog".

142
0:09:29.601,000 --> 0:09:3,000
It has its own innovation.

143
0:09:31.505,000 --> 0:09:34,000
At the commenting area, [it makes] the Chinese Weibo

144
0:09:35.138,000 --> 0:09:38,000
more like Facebook, rather than the original Twitter.

145
0:09:38.88,000 --> 0:09:42,000
So these innovations and clones, as the Weibo and microblogging,

146
0:09:43.304,000 --> 0:09:45,000
when it came to China in 2009,

147
0:09:45.624,000 --> 0:09:49,000
it immediately became a media platform itself.

148
0:09:49.637,000 --> 0:09:53,000
It became the media platform of 300 million readers.

149
0:09:53.838,000 --> 0:09:54,000
It became the media.

150
0:09:55.739,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Anything not mentioned in Weibo,

151
0:09:58.164,000 --> 0:10:03,000
it does not appear to exist for the Chinese public.

152
0:10:03.448,000 --> 0:10:05,000
But also, Chinese social media is

153
0:10:05.884,000 --> 0:10:09,000
really changing Chinese mindsets and Chinese life.

154
0:10:10.279,000 --> 0:10:13,000
For example, they give the voiceless people

155
0:10:13.768,000 --> 0:10:15,000
a channel to make your voice heard.

156
0:10:16.521,000 --> 0:10:21,000
We had a petition system. It's a remedy outside the judicial system,

157
0:10:21.964,000 --> 0:10:24,000
because the Chinese central government wants to keep a myth:

158
0:10:25.041,000 --> 0:10:29,000
The emperor is good. The old local officials are thugs.

159
0:10:29.667,000 --> 0:10:32,000
So that's why the petitioner, the victims, the peasants,

160
0:10:33.058,000 --> 0:10:36,000
want to take the train to Beijing to petition to the central government,

161
0:10:36.689,000 --> 0:10:38,000
they want the emperor to settle the problem.

162
0:10:39.484,000 --> 0:10:41,000
But when more and more people go to Beijing,

163
0:10:42.323,000 --> 0:10:45,000
they also cause the risk of a revolution.

164
0:10:45.846,000 --> 0:10:47,000
So they send them back in recent years.

165
0:10:48.718,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And even some of them were put into black jails.

166
0:10:52.285,000 --> 0:10:55,000
But now we have Weibo, so I call it the Weibo petition.

167
0:10:55.886,000 --> 0:10:57,000
People just use their cell phones to tweet.

168
0:10:58.725,000 --> 0:11:01,000
So your sad stories, by some chance your story

169
0:11:02.302,000 --> 0:11:05,000
will be picked up by reporters, professors or celebrities.

170
0:11:05.943,000 --> 0:11:06,000
One of them is Yao Chen,

171
0:11:07.856,000 --> 0:11:1,000
she is the most popular microblogger in China,

172
0:11:11.245,000 --> 0:11:14,000
who has about 21 million followers.

173
0:11:15.104,000 --> 0:11:18,000
They're almost like a national TV station.

174
0:11:18.726,000 --> 0:11:21,000
If you -- so a sad story will be picked up by her.

175
0:11:22.062,000 --> 0:11:26,000
So this Weibo social media, even in the censorship,

176
0:11:26.51,000 --> 0:11:31,000
still gave the Chinese a real chance for 300 million people

177
0:11:32.25,000 --> 0:11:35,000
every day chatting together, talking together.

178
0:11:35.574,000 --> 0:11:37,000
It's like a big TED, right?

179
0:11:38.48,000 --> 0:11:41,000
But also, it is like the first time a public sphere

180
0:11:42.328,000 --> 0:11:43,000
happened in China.

181
0:11:44.032,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Chinese people start to learn how to negotiate

182
0:11:47.247,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and talk to people.

183
0:11:50.432,000 --> 0:11:53,000
But also, the cat, the censorship, is not sleeping.

184
0:11:54.136,000 --> 0:11:58,000
It's so hard to post some sensitive words on the Chinese Weibo.

185
0:11:58.382,000 --> 0:12:01,000
For example, you can't post the name of the president,

186
0:12:01.589,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Hu Jintao, and also you can't post the city of Chongqing, the name,

187
0:12:07.167,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and until recently, you can't search the surname of top leaders.

188
0:12:11.901,000 --> 0:12:15,000
So, the Chinese are very good at these puns

189
0:12:16.234,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and alternative wording and even memes.

190
0:12:19.906,000 --> 0:12:21,000
They even name themselves -- you know,

191
0:12:22.151,000 --> 0:12:24,000
use the name of this world-changing

192
0:12:24.646,000 --> 0:12:27,000
battle between the grass-mud horse and the river crab.

193
0:12:28.617,000 --> 0:12:3,000
The grass-mud horse is caoníma,

194
0:12:30.626,000 --> 0:12:32,000
is the phonogram for motherfucker,

195
0:12:33.58,000 --> 0:12:39,000
the Netizens call themselves.

196
0:12:39.796,000 --> 0:12:41,000
River crab is héxiè, is the phonogram for

197
0:12:42.413,000 --> 0:12:44,000
harmonization, for censorship.

198
0:12:45.307,000 --> 0:12:5,000
So that's kind of a caoníma versus the héxiè, that's very good.

199
0:12:50.427,000 --> 0:12:55,000
So, when some very political, exciting moments happened,

200
0:12:56.404,000 --> 0:13:01,000
you can see on Weibo, you see a lot of very weird stories happened.

201
0:13:01.985,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Weird phrases and words, even if you have a PhD

202
0:13:06.817,000 --> 0:13:09,000
of Chinese language, you can't understand them.

203
0:13:10.284,000 --> 0:13:12,000
But you can't even expand more, no, because

204
0:13:13.107,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Chinese Sina Weibo, when it was founded

205
0:13:16.03,000 --> 0:13:21,000
was exactly one month after the official blocking of Twitter.com.

206
0:13:21.166,000 --> 0:13:23,000
That means from the very beginning,

207
0:13:23.262,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Weibo has already convinced the Chinese government,

208
0:13:27.454,000 --> 0:13:29,000
we will not become the stage for

209
0:13:30.198,000 --> 0:13:32,000
any kind of a threat to the regime.

210
0:13:32.79,000 --> 0:13:34,000
For example, anything you want to post,

211
0:13:34.99,000 --> 0:13:36,000
like "get together" or "meet up" or "walk,"

212
0:13:37.885,000 --> 0:13:41,000
it is automatically recorded and data mined

213
0:13:42.078,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and reported to a poll for further political analyzing.

214
0:13:48.606,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Even if you want to have some gathering,

215
0:13:50.606,000 --> 0:13:53,000
before you go there, the police are already waiting for you.

216
0:13:54.286,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Why? Because they have the data.

217
0:13:56.094,000 --> 0:13:58,000
They have everything in their hands.

218
0:13:58.286,000 --> 0:14:04,000
So they can use the 1984 scenario data mining of the dissident.

219
0:14:04.51,000 --> 0:14:07,000
So the crackdown is very serious.

220
0:14:08.109,000 --> 0:14:1,000
But I want you to notice a very funny thing

221
0:14:10.65,000 --> 0:14:12,000
during the process of the cat-and-mouse.

222
0:14:13.538,000 --> 0:14:17,000
The cat is the censorship, but Chinese is not only one cat,

223
0:14:17.763,000 --> 0:14:2,000
but also has local cats. Central cat and local cats.

224
0:14:21.391,000 --> 0:14:22,000
(Laughter)

225
0:14:23.317,000 --> 0:14:26,000
You know, the server is in the [central] cats' hands,

226
0:14:26.391,000 --> 0:14:3,000
so even that -- when the Netizens criticize the local government,

227
0:14:31.013,000 --> 0:14:35,000
the local government has not any access to the data in Beijing.

228
0:14:35.651,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Without bribing the central cats,

229
0:14:37.539,000 --> 0:14:4,000
he can do nothing, only apologize.

230
0:14:40.965,000 --> 0:14:42,000
So these three years, in the past three years,

231
0:14:43.693,000 --> 0:14:45,000
social movements about microblogging

232
0:14:46.339,000 --> 0:14:48,000
really changed local government,

233
0:14:48.7,000 --> 0:14:5,000
became more and more transparent,

234
0:14:50.956,000 --> 0:14:52,000
because they can't access the data.

235
0:14:53.804,000 --> 0:14:56,000
The server is in Beijing.

236
0:14:57.417,000 --> 0:14:58,000
The story about the train crash,

237
0:14:58.887,000 --> 0:15:01,000
maybe the question is not about why 10 million

238
0:15:02.094,000 --> 0:15:06,000
criticisms in five days, but why the Chinese central government

239
0:15:06.34,000 --> 0:15:09,000
allowed the five days of freedom of speech online.

240
0:15:09.564,000 --> 0:15:1,000
It's never happened before.

241
0:15:11.473,000 --> 0:15:14,000
And so it's very simple, because even the top leaders

242
0:15:14.924,000 --> 0:15:17,000
were fed up with this guy, this independent kingdom.

243
0:15:18.445,000 --> 0:15:19,000
So they want an excuse --

244
0:15:20.115,000 --> 0:15:23,000
public opinion is a very good excuse to punish him.

245
0:15:23.572,000 --> 0:15:25,000
But also, the Bo Xilai case recently, very big news,

246
0:15:26.542,000 --> 0:15:27,000
he's a princeling.

247
0:15:27.873,000 --> 0:15:31,000
But from February to April this year,

248
0:15:31.992,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Weibo really became a marketplace of rumors.

249
0:15:34.695,000 --> 0:15:37,000
You can almost joke everything about these princelings,

250
0:15:38.032,000 --> 0:15:41,000
everything! It's almost like you're living in the United States.

251
0:15:41.432,000 --> 0:15:45,000
But if you dare to retweet or mention any fake coup

252
0:15:46.081,000 --> 0:15:49,000
about Beijing, you definitely will be arrested.

253
0:15:50.024,000 --> 0:15:55,000
So this kind of freedom is a targeted and precise window.

254
0:15:55.947,000 --> 0:15:58,000
So Chinese in China, censorship is normal.

255
0:15:59.816,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Something you find is, freedom is weird.

256
0:16:02.561,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Something will happen behind it.

257
0:16:04.328,000 --> 0:16:07,000
Because he was a very popular Leftist leader,

258
0:16:07.484,000 --> 0:16:09,000
so the central government wanted to purge him,

259
0:16:09.688,000 --> 0:16:13,000
and he was very cute, he convinced all the Chinese people,

260
0:16:13.77,000 --> 0:16:14,000
why he is so bad.

261
0:16:15.6,000 --> 0:16:18,000
So Weibo, the 300 million public sphere,

262
0:16:19.378,000 --> 0:16:23,000
became a very good, convenient tool for a political fight.

263
0:16:23.889,000 --> 0:16:25,000
But this technology is very new,

264
0:16:26.046,000 --> 0:16:27,000
but technically is very old.

265
0:16:27.712,000 --> 0:16:29,000
It was made famous by Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong,

266
0:16:30.64,000 --> 0:16:32,000
because he mobilized millions of Chinese people

267
0:16:33.537,000 --> 0:16:37,000
in the Cultural Revolution to destroy every local government.

268
0:16:37.619,000 --> 0:16:39,000
It's very simple, because Chinese central government

269
0:16:40.489,000 --> 0:16:42,000
doesn't need to even lead the public opinion.

270
0:16:42.625,000 --> 0:16:46,000
They just give them a target window to not censor people.

271
0:16:47.156,000 --> 0:16:52,000
Not censoring in China has become a political tool.

272
0:16:53.065,000 --> 0:16:56,000
So that's the update about this game, cat-and-mouse.

273
0:16:57.035,000 --> 0:16:59,000
Social media changed Chinese mindset.

274
0:16:59.205,000 --> 0:17:02,000
More and more Chinese intend to embrace freedom of speech

275
0:17:02.715,000 --> 0:17:04,000
and human rights as their birthright,

276
0:17:04.875,000 --> 0:17:07,000
not some imported American privilege.

277
0:17:08.497,000 --> 0:17:11,000
But also, it gave the Chinese a national public sphere

278
0:17:12.209,000 --> 0:17:16,000
for people to, it's like a training of their citizenship,

279
0:17:16.539,000 --> 0:17:18,000
preparing for future democracy.

280
0:17:19.11,000 --> 0:17:21,000
But it didn't change the Chinese political system,

281
0:17:21.566,000 --> 0:17:24,000
and also the Chinese central government utilized this

282
0:17:24.811,000 --> 0:17:27,000
centralized server structure to strengthen its power

283
0:17:28.747,000 --> 0:17:32,000
to counter the local government and the different factions.

284
0:17:33.245,000 --> 0:17:35,000
So, what's the future?

285
0:17:36.017,000 --> 0:17:38,000
After all, we are the mouse.

286
0:17:38.201,000 --> 0:17:41,000
Whatever the future is, we should fight against the [cat].

287
0:17:42.001,000 --> 0:17:45,000
There is not only in China, but also in the United States

288
0:17:45.992,000 --> 0:17:49,000
there are some very small, cute but bad cats.

289
0:17:50.821,000 --> 0:17:51,000
(Laughter)

290
0:17:52.465,000 --> 0:17:58,000
SOPA, PIPA, ACTA, TPP and ITU.

291
0:17:59.203,000 --> 0:18:04,000
And also, like Facebook and Google, they claim they are friends of the mouse,

292
0:18:04.558,000 --> 0:18:08,000
but sometimes we see them dating the cats.

293
0:18:08.745,000 --> 0:18:11,000
So my conclusion is very simple.

294
0:18:11.929,000 --> 0:18:13,000
We Chinese fight for our freedom,

295
0:18:14.774,000 --> 0:18:17,000
you just watch your bad cats.

296
0:18:18.369,000 --> 0:18:2,000
Don't let them hook [up] with the Chinese cats.

297
0:18:21.272,000 --> 0:18:23,000
Only in this way, in the future,

298
0:18:24.113,000 --> 0:18:27,000
we will achieve the dreams of the mouse:

299
0:18:27.361,000 --> 0:18:3,000
that we can tweet anytime, anywhere, without fear.

300
0:18:31.337,000 --> 0:18:38,000
(Applause)

301
0:18:38.696,000 --> 0:18:39,000
Thank you.

302
0:18:40.381,000 --> 0:18:44,000
(Applause)

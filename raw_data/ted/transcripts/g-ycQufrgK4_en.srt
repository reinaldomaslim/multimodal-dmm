1
0:00:12.879,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Have you ever experienced a moment in your life

2
0:00:16.849,000 --> 0:00:19,000
that was so painful and confusing,

3
0:00:20.276,000 --> 0:00:21,000
that all you wanted to do

4
0:00:22.098,000 --> 0:00:25,000
was learn as much as you could to make sense of it all?

5
0:00:25.818,000 --> 0:00:29,000
When I was 13, a close family friend who was like an uncle to me

6
0:00:30.465,000 --> 0:00:32,000
passed away from pancreatic cancer.

7
0:00:33.398,000 --> 0:00:35,000
When the disease hit so close to home,

8
0:00:35.766,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I knew I needed to learn more.

9
0:00:37.849,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So I went online to find answers.

10
0:00:40.716,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Using the Internet, I found a variety of statistics on pancreatic cancer,

11
0:00:45.485,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and what I had found shocked me.

12
0:00:48.41,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Over 85 percent of all pancreatic cancers are diagnosed late,

13
0:00:53.411,000 --> 0:00:56,000
when someone has less than a two percent chance of survival.

14
0:00:57.772,000 --> 0:01:,000
Why are we so bad at detecting pancreatic cancer?

15
0:01:01.885,000 --> 0:01:02,000
The reason?

16
0:01:03.677,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Today's current "modern" medicine is a 60-year-old technique.

17
0:01:07.522,000 --> 0:01:08,000
That's older than my dad.

18
0:01:09.516,000 --> 0:01:12,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:13.563,000 --> 0:01:18,000
But also, it's extremely expensive, costing 800 dollars per test,

20
0:01:19.564,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and it's grossly inaccurate, missing 30 percent of all pancreatic cancers.

21
0:01:25.519,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Your doctor would have to be ridiculously suspicious that you have the cancer

22
0:01:29.56,000 --> 0:01:3,000
in order to give you this test.

23
0:01:31.958,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Learning this, I knew there had to be a better way.

24
0:01:35.714,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So, I set up scientific criteria

25
0:01:37.859,000 --> 0:01:39,000
as to what a sensor would have to look like

26
0:01:39.969,000 --> 0:01:41,000
in order to effectively diagnose pancreatic cancer.

27
0:01:43.357,000 --> 0:01:44,000
The sensor would have to be:

28
0:01:44.953,000 --> 0:01:48,000
inexpensive, rapid, simple, sensitive,

29
0:01:49.819,000 --> 0:01:52,000
selective, and minimally invasive.

30
0:01:54.352,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Now, there's a reason why this test hasn't been updated in over six decades.

31
0:01:59.396,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And that's because when we're looking for pancreatic cancer,

32
0:02:02.377,000 --> 0:02:03,000
we're looking at your bloodstream,

33
0:02:04.089,000 --> 0:02:08,000
which is already abundant in all these tons and tons of protein,

34
0:02:08.839,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and you're looking for this miniscule difference in this tiny amount of protein.

35
0:02:12.638,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Just this one protein.

36
0:02:14.135,000 --> 0:02:15,000
That's next to impossible.

37
0:02:16.044,000 --> 0:02:19,000
However, undeterred due to my teenage optimism --

38
0:02:19.799,000 --> 0:02:2,000
(Laughter)

39
0:02:21.008,000 --> 0:02:25,000
(Applause)

40
0:02:25.604,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I went online to a teenager's two best friends, Google and Wikipedia.

41
0:02:30.859,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I got everything for my homework from those two sources.

42
0:02:33.799,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:35.08,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And what I had found was an article

44
0:02:37.653,000 --> 0:02:4,000
that listed a database of over 8,000 different proteins

45
0:02:41.524,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that are found when you have pancreatic cancer.

46
0:02:43.967,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So, I decided to go and make it my new mission

47
0:02:47.448,000 --> 0:02:48,000
to go through all these proteins,

48
0:02:49.205,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and see which ones could serve as a bio-marker for pancreatic cancer.

49
0:02:53.087,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And to make it a bit simpler for myself,

50
0:02:55.387,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I decided to map out scientific criteria, and here it is.

51
0:02:59.799,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Essentially, first, the protein would have to be found in all pancreatic cancers,

52
0:03:03.769,000 --> 0:03:04,000
at high levels in the bloodstream,

53
0:03:05.536,000 --> 0:03:08,000
in the earliest stages, but also only in cancer.

54
0:03:09.553,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And so I'm just plugging and chugging through this gargantuan task,

55
0:03:12.936,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and finally, on the 4,000th try,

56
0:03:15.819,000 --> 0:03:16,000
when I'm close to losing my sanity,

57
0:03:17.759,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I find the protein.

58
0:03:19.408,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And the name of the protein I'd located was called mesothelin,

59
0:03:23.389,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and it's just your ordinary, run-of-the-mill type protein,

60
0:03:26.278,000 --> 0:03:29,000
unless, of course, you have pancreatic, ovarian or lung cancer,

61
0:03:29.566,000 --> 0:03:32,000
in which case it's found at these very high levels in your bloodstream.

62
0:03:32.925,000 --> 0:03:36,000
But also, the key is that it's found in the earliest stages of the disease,

63
0:03:37.608,000 --> 0:03:39,000
when someone has close to 100 percent chance of survival.

64
0:03:41.144,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So now that I'd found a reliable protein I could detect,

65
0:03:44.489,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I then shifted my focus to actually detecting that protein,

66
0:03:47.45,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and thus, pancreatic cancer.

67
0:03:50.103,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Now, my breakthrough came in a very unlikely place,

68
0:03:53.104,000 --> 0:03:56,000
possibly the most unlikely place for innovation --

69
0:03:56.135,000 --> 0:04:,000
my high school biology class, the absolute stifler of innovation.

70
0:04:00.282,000 --> 0:04:02,000
(Laughter)

71
0:04:02.839,000 --> 0:04:04,000
(Applause)

72
0:04:06.101,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And I had snuck in this article on these things called carbon nanotubes,

73
0:04:09.813,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and that's just a long, thin pipe of carbon

74
0:04:12.294,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that's an atom thick, and one 50,000th the diameter of your hair.

75
0:04:16.092,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And despite their extremely small sizes,

76
0:04:18.552,000 --> 0:04:19,000
they have these incredible properties.

77
0:04:20.523,000 --> 0:04:22,000
They're kind of like the superheroes of material science.

78
0:04:23.266,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And while I was sneakily reading this article under my desk in my biology class,

79
0:04:27.337,000 --> 0:04:3,000
we were supposed to be paying attention to these other kind of cool molecules,

80
0:04:31.123,000 --> 0:04:32,000
called antibodies.

81
0:04:32.517,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And these are pretty cool because they only react

82
0:04:34.829,000 --> 0:04:35,000
with one specific protein,

83
0:04:36.39,000 --> 0:04:38,000
but they're not nearly as interesting as carbon nanotubes.

84
0:04:39.42,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And so then, I was sitting in class, and suddenly it hit me:

85
0:04:44.849,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I could combine what I was reading about, carbon nanotubes,

86
0:04:48.829,000 --> 0:04:51,000
with what I was supposed to be thinking about, antibodies.

87
0:04:51.869,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Essentially, I could weave a bunch of these antibodies

88
0:04:54.554,000 --> 0:04:56,000
into a network of carbon nanotubes,

89
0:04:56.789,000 --> 0:04:59,000
such that you have a network that only reacts with one protein,

90
0:05:00.439,000 --> 0:05:03,000
but also, due to the properties of these nanotubes,

91
0:05:03.819,000 --> 0:05:04,000
it will change its electrical properties,

92
0:05:05.819,000 --> 0:05:06,000
based on the amount of protein present.

93
0:05:08.252,000 --> 0:05:09,000
However, there's a catch.

94
0:05:10.364,000 --> 0:05:13,000
These networks of carbon nanotubes are extremely flimsy.

95
0:05:14.037,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And since they're so delicate, they need to be supported.

96
0:05:17.211,000 --> 0:05:18,000
So that's why I chose to use paper.

97
0:05:19.532,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Making a cancer sensor out of paper is about as simple

98
0:05:22.523,000 --> 0:05:24,000
as making chocolate chip cookies, which I love.

99
0:05:24.964,000 --> 0:05:26,000
(Laughs)

100
0:05:27.869,000 --> 0:05:29,000
You start with some water, pour in some nanotubes,

101
0:05:30.869,000 --> 0:05:34,000
add antibodies, mix it up, take some paper, dip it, dry it,

102
0:05:35.869,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and you can detect cancer.

103
0:05:39.267,000 --> 0:05:45,000
(Applause)

104
0:05:45.729,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Then, suddenly, a thought occurred

105
0:05:48.859,000 --> 0:05:51,000
that kind of put a blemish on my amazing plan here.

106
0:05:53.278,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I can't really do cancer research on my kitchen countertop.

107
0:05:56.239,000 --> 0:05:57,000
My mom wouldn't really like that.

108
0:05:58.516,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So instead, I decided to go for a lab.

109
0:06:01.611,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So I typed up a budget, a materials list, a timeline, and a procedure,

110
0:06:06.237,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and I emailed it to 200 different professors

111
0:06:08.933,000 --> 0:06:11,000
at Johns Hopkins University and the National Institutes of Health --

112
0:06:12.232,000 --> 0:06:15,000
essentially, anyone that had anything to do with pancreatic cancer.

113
0:06:15.486,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I sat back waiting for these positive emails to be pouring in,

114
0:06:18.635,000 --> 0:06:2,000
saying, "You're a genius! You're going to save us all!"

115
0:06:21.456,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And --

116
0:06:22.751,000 --> 0:06:24,000
(Laughter)

117
0:06:25.651,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Then reality took hold, and over the course of a month,

118
0:06:29.655,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I got 199 rejections out of those 200 emails.

119
0:06:34.235,000 --> 0:06:36,000
One professor even went through my entire procedure,

120
0:06:36.775,000 --> 0:06:39,000
painstakingly -- I'm not really sure where he got all this time --

121
0:06:39.896,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and he went through and said why each and every step

122
0:06:43.508,000 --> 0:06:45,000
was like the worst mistake I could ever make.

123
0:06:46.458,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Clearly, the professors did not have as high of an opinion of my work as I did.

124
0:06:52.367,000 --> 0:06:53,000
However, there is a silver lining.

125
0:06:54.348,000 --> 0:06:56,000
One professor said, "Maybe I might be able to help you, kid."

126
0:06:57.339,000 --> 0:06:58,000
So, I went in that direction.

127
0:06:59.678,000 --> 0:07:02,000
(Laughter)

128
0:07:03.762,000 --> 0:07:04,000
As you can never say no to a kid.

129
0:07:06.157,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And so then, three months later,

130
0:07:08.769,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I finally nailed down a harsh deadline with this guy,

131
0:07:11.664,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and I get into his lab, I get all excited, and then I sit down,

132
0:07:15.258,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I start opening my mouth and talking,

133
0:07:17.162,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and five seconds later, he calls in another Ph.D.

134
0:07:19.634,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Ph.D.s just flock into this little room,

135
0:07:23.392,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and they're just firing these questions at me,

136
0:07:25.56,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and by the end, I kind of felt like I was in a clown car.

137
0:07:28.384,000 --> 0:07:3,000
There were 20 Ph.D.s, plus me and the professor

138
0:07:30.6,000 --> 0:07:31,000
crammed into this tiny office space,

139
0:07:32.466,000 --> 0:07:34,000
with them firing these rapid-fire questions at me,

140
0:07:35.467,000 --> 0:07:37,000
trying to sink my procedure.

141
0:07:37.651,000 --> 0:07:39,000
How unlikely is that? I mean, pshhh.

142
0:07:39.962,000 --> 0:07:42,000
(Laughter)

143
0:07:44.419,000 --> 0:07:46,000
However, subjecting myself to that interrogation --

144
0:07:47.38,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I answered all their questions, and I guessed on quite a few

145
0:07:50.351,000 --> 0:07:51,000
but I got them right --

146
0:07:51.622,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and I finally landed the lab space I needed.

147
0:07:55.819,000 --> 0:07:58,000
But it was shortly afterwards that I discovered my once brilliant procedure

148
0:07:59.639,000 --> 0:08:01,000
had something like a million holes in it,

149
0:08:01.789,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and over the course of seven months,

150
0:08:03.574,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I painstakingly filled each and every one of those holes.

151
0:08:06.533,000 --> 0:08:07,000
The result?

152
0:08:07.784,000 --> 0:08:11,000
One small paper sensor that costs three cents and takes five minutes to run.

153
0:08:12.981,000 --> 0:08:15,000
This makes it 168 times faster,

154
0:08:16.43,000 --> 0:08:18,000
over 26,000 times less expensive,

155
0:08:19.253,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and over 400 times more sensitive than our current standard

156
0:08:22.799,000 --> 0:08:23,000
for pancreatic cancer detection.

157
0:08:25.745,000 --> 0:08:31,000
(Applause)

158
0:08:34.738,000 --> 0:08:36,000
One of the best parts of the sensor, though,

159
0:08:37.079,000 --> 0:08:39,000
is that it has close to 100 percent accuracy,

160
0:08:39.604,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and can detect the cancer in the earliest stages,

161
0:08:42.314,000 --> 0:08:44,000
when someone has close to 100 percent chance of survival.

162
0:08:45.496,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And so in the next two to five years,

163
0:08:47.467,000 --> 0:08:5,000
this sensor could potentially lift the pancreatic cancer survival rates

164
0:08:50.826,000 --> 0:08:54,000
from a dismal 5.5 percent to close to 100 percent,

165
0:08:54.948,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and it would do similar for ovarian and lung cancer.

166
0:08:58.091,000 --> 0:08:59,000
But it wouldn't stop there.

167
0:09:00.245,000 --> 0:09:01,000
By switching out that antibody,

168
0:09:01.923,000 --> 0:09:04,000
you can look at a different protein, thus, a different disease --

169
0:09:05.453,000 --> 0:09:07,000
potentially any disease in the entire world.

170
0:09:08.869,000 --> 0:09:12,000
So that ranges from heart disease, to malaria, HIV, AIDS,

171
0:09:13.517,000 --> 0:09:15,000
as well as other forms of cancer -- anything.

172
0:09:16.462,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And so, hopefully one day,

173
0:09:18.433,000 --> 0:09:2,000
we can all have that one extra uncle,

174
0:09:20.869,000 --> 0:09:23,000
that one mother, that one brother, sister,

175
0:09:24.127,000 --> 0:09:26,000
we can have that one more family member to love.

176
0:09:27.023,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And that our hearts will be rid of that one disease burden

177
0:09:31.809,000 --> 0:09:33,000
that comes from pancreatic, ovarian and lung cancer,

178
0:09:34.759,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and potentially any disease.

179
0:09:36.859,000 --> 0:09:38,000
But through the Internet, anything is possible.

180
0:09:39.684,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Theories can be shared,

181
0:09:40.988,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and you don't have to be a professor with multiple degrees

182
0:09:43.739,000 --> 0:09:44,000
to have your ideas valued.

183
0:09:45.269,000 --> 0:09:49,000
It's a neutral space, where what you look like, age or gender --

184
0:09:49.334,000 --> 0:09:5,000
it doesn't matter.

185
0:09:50.594,000 --> 0:09:51,000
It's just your ideas that count.

186
0:09:53.113,000 --> 0:09:57,000
For me, it's all about looking at the Internet in an entirely new way,

187
0:09:57.839,000 --> 0:09:59,000
to realize that there's so much more to it

188
0:09:59.959,000 --> 0:10:01,000
than just posting duck-face pictures of yourself online.

189
0:10:03.464,000 --> 0:10:04,000
(Laughter)

190
0:10:05.277,000 --> 0:10:06,000
You could be changing the world.

191
0:10:08.202,000 --> 0:10:13,000
So if a 15 year-old who didn't even know what a pancreas was

192
0:10:13.488,000 --> 0:10:15,000
could find a new way to detect pancreatic cancer --

193
0:10:17.451,000 --> 0:10:18,000
just imagine what you could do.

194
0:10:19.376,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Thank you.

195
0:10:20.638,000 --> 0:10:26,000
(Applause)

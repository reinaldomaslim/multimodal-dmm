1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I want to talk to you about something

2
0:00:18.363,000 --> 0:00:19,000
kind of big.

3
0:00:21.942,000 --> 0:00:22,000
We'll start here.

4
0:00:24.837,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Sixty-five million years ago --

5
0:00:26.81,000 --> 0:00:27,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:27.871,000 --> 0:00:3,000
the dinosaurs had a bad day.

7
0:00:30.934,000 --> 0:00:32,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:33.569,000 --> 0:00:36,000
A chunk of rock six miles across,

9
0:00:36.868,000 --> 0:00:39,000
moving something like 50 times the speed of a rifle bullet,

10
0:00:40.633,000 --> 0:00:41,000
slammed into the Earth.

11
0:00:42.438,000 --> 0:00:44,000
It released its energy all at once,

12
0:00:44.918,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and it was an explosion that was mind-numbing.

13
0:00:48.47,000 --> 0:00:5,000
If you took every nuclear weapon ever built

14
0:00:51.355,000 --> 0:00:52,000
at the height of the Cold War,

15
0:00:52.938,000 --> 0:00:53,000
lumped them together,

16
0:00:54.334,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and blew them up at the same time,

17
0:00:56.86,000 --> 0:01:,000
that would be one one-millionth of the energy released at that moment.

18
0:01:02.256,000 --> 0:01:05,000
The dinosaurs had a really bad day.

19
0:01:05.77,000 --> 0:01:06,000
OK?

20
0:01:06.959,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Now, a six-mile-wide rock is very large.

21
0:01:09.324,000 --> 0:01:1,000
We all live here in Boulder.

22
0:01:10.713,000 --> 0:01:12,000
If you look out your window and see Longs Peak --

23
0:01:13.137,000 --> 0:01:14,000
you're probably familiar with it --

24
0:01:14.876,000 --> 0:01:17,000
now, scoop up Longs Peak and put it out in space.

25
0:01:17.913,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Take ... Meeker, Mt. Meeker.

26
0:01:20.622,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Lump that in there, and put that in space as well.

27
0:01:23.383,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And Mt. Everest. And K2.

28
0:01:26.435,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And the Indian peaks.

29
0:01:28.022,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Then you're starting to get an idea of how much rock we're talking about, OK?

30
0:01:31.91,000 --> 0:01:32,000
We know it was that big

31
0:01:33.111,000 --> 0:01:35,000
because of the impact it had and the crater it left.

32
0:01:35.971,000 --> 0:01:38,000
It hit in what we now know as Yucatan, the Gulf of Mexico.

33
0:01:39.96,000 --> 0:01:41,000
You can see here, there's the Yucatan Peninsula,

34
0:01:42.594,000 --> 0:01:44,000
if you recognize Cozumel off the east coast there.

35
0:01:44.991,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Here is how big of a crater was left.

36
0:01:47.731,000 --> 0:01:48,000
It was huge.

37
0:01:48.928,000 --> 0:01:5,000
To give you a sense of the scale ... there you go.

38
0:01:51.54,000 --> 0:01:54,000
The scale here is 50 miles on top, a hundred kilometers on the bottom.

39
0:01:55.557,000 --> 0:01:58,000
This thing was 300 kilometers across -- 200 miles --

40
0:01:58.633,000 --> 0:02:01,000
an enormous crater that excavated out vast amounts of earth

41
0:02:02.234,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that splashed around the globe and set fires all over the planet,

42
0:02:06.829,000 --> 0:02:08,000
threw up enough dust to block out the sun.

43
0:02:09.098,000 --> 0:02:13,000
It wiped out 75 percent of all species on Earth.

44
0:02:13.468,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Now, not all asteroids are that big.

45
0:02:16.38,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Some of them are smaller.

46
0:02:18.61,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Here is one that came in

47
0:02:21.493,000 --> 0:02:25,000
over the United States in October of 1992.

48
0:02:25.872,000 --> 0:02:26,000
It came in on a Friday night.

49
0:02:27.632,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Why is that important?

50
0:02:28.912,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Because back then, video cameras were just starting to become popular,

51
0:02:32.708,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and parents would bring them to their kids' football games

52
0:02:36.684,000 --> 0:02:37,000
to film their kids playing football.

53
0:02:38.531,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And since this came in on a Friday,

54
0:02:40.682,000 --> 0:02:43,000
they were able to get this great footage of this thing breaking up

55
0:02:44.147,000 --> 0:02:47,000
as it came in over West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey

56
0:02:47.626,000 --> 0:02:48,000
until it did that

57
0:02:48.96,000 --> 0:02:49,000
to a car in New York.

58
0:02:50.414,000 --> 0:02:51,000
(Laughter)

59
0:02:52.014,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Now, this is not a 200-mile-wide crater,

60
0:02:55.536,000 --> 0:02:58,000
but then again, you can see the rock, which is sitting right here,

61
0:02:59.041,000 --> 0:03:,000
about the size of a football,

62
0:03:00.459,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that hit that car and did that damage.

63
0:03:02.865,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Now, this thing was probably about the size of a school bus

64
0:03:05.7,000 --> 0:03:06,000
when it first came in.

65
0:03:06.881,000 --> 0:03:07,000
It broke up through atmospheric pressure,

66
0:03:08.882,000 --> 0:03:1,000
it crumbled, and then the pieces fell apart

67
0:03:11.005,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and did some damage.

68
0:03:12.513,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Now, you wouldn't want that falling on your foot or your head,

69
0:03:16.463,000 --> 0:03:17,000
because it would do that to it.

70
0:03:17.983,000 --> 0:03:18,000
That would be bad.

71
0:03:19.96,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But it won't wipe out, you know, all life on Earth, so that's fine.

72
0:03:23.248,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But it turns out, you don't need something six miles across

73
0:03:26.96,000 --> 0:03:27,000
to do a lot of damage.

74
0:03:28.227,000 --> 0:03:31,000
There is a median point between tiny rock and gigantic rock,

75
0:03:31.946,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and in fact, if any of you have ever been to near Winslow, Arizona,

76
0:03:35.838,000 --> 0:03:38,000
there is a crater in the desert there that is so iconic

77
0:03:39.381,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that it is actually called "Meteor Crater."

78
0:03:41.965,000 --> 0:03:43,000
To give you a sense of scale, this is about a mile wide.

79
0:03:44.966,000 --> 0:03:47,000
If you look up at the top, that's a parking lot,

80
0:03:48.229,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and those are recreational vehicles right there.

81
0:03:51.147,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So it's about a mile across, 600 feet deep.

82
0:03:54.245,000 --> 0:03:59,000
The object that formed this was probably about 30 to 50 yards across,

83
0:03:59.694,000 --> 0:04:02,000
so roughly the size of Macky Auditorium here.

84
0:04:03.412,000 --> 0:04:05,000
It came in at speeds that were tremendous,

85
0:04:06.015,000 --> 0:04:08,000
slammed into the ground, blew up,

86
0:04:08.363,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and exploded with the energy of roughly a 20-megaton nuclear bomb --

87
0:04:12.18,000 --> 0:04:13,000
a very hefty bomb.

88
0:04:13.771,000 --> 0:04:15,000
This was 50,000 years ago,

89
0:04:15.905,000 --> 0:04:17,000
so it may have wiped out a few buffalo or antelope,

90
0:04:18.799,000 --> 0:04:2,000
or something like that out in the desert,

91
0:04:21.381,000 --> 0:04:24,000
but it probably would not have caused global devastation.

92
0:04:25.206,000 --> 0:04:28,000
It turns out that these things don't have to hit the ground

93
0:04:28.853,000 --> 0:04:29,000
to do a lot of damage.

94
0:04:30.46,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Now, in 1908, over Siberia, near the Tunguska region --

95
0:04:34.341,000 --> 0:04:37,000
for those of you who are Dan Aykroyd fans and saw "Ghostbusters,"

96
0:04:37.546,000 --> 0:04:39,000
when he talked about the greatest cross-dimensional rift

97
0:04:40.206,000 --> 0:04:41,000
since the Siberia blast of 1909,

98
0:04:42.164,000 --> 0:04:44,000
where he got the date wrong, but that's OK.

99
0:04:44.797,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Laughter)

100
0:04:45.933,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It was 1908. That's fine. I can live with that.

101
0:04:48.224,000 --> 0:04:49,000
(Laughter)

102
0:04:50.081,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Another rock came into the Earth's atmosphere

103
0:04:53.18,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and this one blew up above the ground,

104
0:04:55.396,000 --> 0:04:57,000
several miles up above the surface of the Earth.

105
0:04:57.733,000 --> 0:05:02,000
The heat from the explosion set fire to the forest below it,

106
0:05:02.933,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and then the shock wave came down and knocked down trees

107
0:05:06.134,000 --> 0:05:08,000
for hundreds of square miles.

108
0:05:08.976,000 --> 0:05:09,000
This did a huge amount of damage.

109
0:05:10.977,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And again, this was a rock probably roughly the size

110
0:05:13.746,000 --> 0:05:15,000
of this auditorium that we're sitting in.

111
0:05:15.848,000 --> 0:05:16,000
In Meteor Crater, it was made of metal,

112
0:05:17.849,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and metal is much tougher, so it made it to the ground.

113
0:05:20.517,000 --> 0:05:22,000
The one over Tunguska was probably made of rock,

114
0:05:22.848,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and that's much more crumbly, so it blew up in the air.

115
0:05:25.666,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Either way, these are tremendous explosions -- 20 megatons.

116
0:05:30.375,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Now, when these things blow up,

117
0:05:32.448,000 --> 0:05:35,000
they're not going to do global ecological damage.

118
0:05:35.859,000 --> 0:05:38,000
They're not going to do something like the dinosaur killer did.

119
0:05:39.051,000 --> 0:05:4,000
They're just not big enough.

120
0:05:40.544,000 --> 0:05:42,000
But they will do global economic damage,

121
0:05:43.254,000 --> 0:05:45,000
because they don't have to hit, necessarily,

122
0:05:45.796,000 --> 0:05:46,000
to do this kind of damage.

123
0:05:47.329,000 --> 0:05:49,000
They don't have to do global devastation.

124
0:05:49.96,000 --> 0:05:51,000
If one of these things were to hit pretty much anywhere,

125
0:05:52.796,000 --> 0:05:53,000
it would cause a panic.

126
0:05:53.975,000 --> 0:05:55,000
But if it came over a city, an important city --

127
0:05:56.264,000 --> 0:05:58,000
not that any city is more important than others,

128
0:05:58.552,000 --> 0:06:01,000
but some of them we depend on more on the global economic basis --

129
0:06:01.915,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that could do a huge amount of damage to us as a civilization.

130
0:06:07.145,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So, now that I've scared the crap out of you --

131
0:06:10.691,000 --> 0:06:11,000
(Laughter)

132
0:06:11.82,000 --> 0:06:12,000
what can we do about this?

133
0:06:13.821,000 --> 0:06:15,000
This is a potential threat.

134
0:06:15.932,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Let me note that we have not had a giant impact like the dinosaur killer

135
0:06:20.342,000 --> 0:06:21,000
for 65 million years.

136
0:06:21.653,000 --> 0:06:22,000
They're very rare.

137
0:06:23.014,000 --> 0:06:25,000
The smaller ones happen more often,

138
0:06:25.157,000 --> 0:06:27,000
but probably on the order of a millennium,

139
0:06:27.708,000 --> 0:06:3,000
every few centuries or every few thousand years.

140
0:06:31.108,000 --> 0:06:33,000
But it's still something to be aware of.

141
0:06:33.184,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Well, what do we do about them?

142
0:06:34.748,000 --> 0:06:36,000
The first thing we have to do is find them.

143
0:06:36.879,000 --> 0:06:4,000
This is an image of an asteroid that passed us in 2009.

144
0:06:41.145,000 --> 0:06:42,000
It's right here.

145
0:06:42.966,000 --> 0:06:44,000
But you can see that it's extremely faint.

146
0:06:45.461,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I don't know if you can see that in the back row.

147
0:06:47.818,000 --> 0:06:48,000
These are just stars.

148
0:06:49.257,000 --> 0:06:51,000
This is a rock that was about 30 yards across,

149
0:06:51.514,000 --> 0:06:53,000
so roughly the size of the ones that blew up over Tunguska

150
0:06:54.417,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and hit Arizona 50,000 years ago.

151
0:06:56.667,000 --> 0:06:57,000
These things are faint.

152
0:06:57.853,000 --> 0:06:59,000
They're hard to see, and the sky is really big.

153
0:07:00.303,000 --> 0:07:01,000
We have to find these things first.

154
0:07:02.247,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Well, the good news is, we're looking for them.

155
0:07:04.55,000 --> 0:07:06,000
NASA has devoted money to this;

156
0:07:06.867,000 --> 0:07:08,000
the National Science Foundation and other countries

157
0:07:09.292,000 --> 0:07:1,000
are interested in doing this.

158
0:07:10.731,000 --> 0:07:12,000
We're building telescopes that are looking for the threat.

159
0:07:13.508,000 --> 0:07:15,000
That's a great first step. But what's the second step?

160
0:07:16.098,000 --> 0:07:19,000
The second step is if we see one heading toward us, we have to stop it.

161
0:07:19.57,000 --> 0:07:2,000
What do we do?

162
0:07:20.745,000 --> 0:07:22,000
You've probably heard about the asteroid Apophis.

163
0:07:23.121,000 --> 0:07:25,000
If you haven't yet, you will.

164
0:07:25.285,000 --> 0:07:27,000
If you've heard about the Mayan 2012 apocalypse,

165
0:07:27.974,000 --> 0:07:28,000
you're going to hear about Apophis,

166
0:07:29.69,000 --> 0:07:32,000
because you're keyed in to all the doomsday networks, anyway.

167
0:07:33.007,000 --> 0:07:34,000
(Laughter)

168
0:07:34.739,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Apophis is an asteroid that was discovered in 2004.

169
0:07:37.785,000 --> 0:07:4,000
It's roughly 250 [meters] across, so it's pretty big --

170
0:07:41.541,000 --> 0:07:43,000
bigger than a football stadium.

171
0:07:43.874,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And it's going to pass by the Earth in April of 2029.

172
0:07:47.394,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And it's going to pass us so close

173
0:07:49.139,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that it's actually going to come underneath our weather satellites.

174
0:07:52.878,000 --> 0:07:55,000
The Earth's gravity is going to bend the orbit of this thing so much

175
0:07:56.601,000 --> 0:07:57,000
that if it's just right,

176
0:07:58.027,000 --> 0:08:,000
if it passes through this region of space,

177
0:08:00.512,000 --> 0:08:03,000
this kidney-bean-shaped region called the keyhole,

178
0:08:03.993,000 --> 0:08:06,000
the Earth's gravity will bend it just enough that seven years later,

179
0:08:07.517,000 --> 0:08:1,000
on April 13 -- which is a Friday, I'll note -- in the year 2036 --

180
0:08:11.538,000 --> 0:08:12,000
(Laughter)

181
0:08:12.585,000 --> 0:08:13,000
you can't plan that kind of stuff --

182
0:08:14.349,000 --> 0:08:15,000
(Laughter)

183
0:08:15.435,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Apophis is going to hit us.

184
0:08:16.937,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And it's 250 meters across, so it would do unbelievable damage.

185
0:08:21.32,000 --> 0:08:24,000
The good news is that the odds of it actually passing through this keyhole

186
0:08:24.941,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and hitting us next go-around are one in a million, roughly --

187
0:08:27.936,000 --> 0:08:28,000
very, very low odds.

188
0:08:29.111,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So I personally am not lying awake at night worrying about this at all.

189
0:08:32.541,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I don't think Apophis is a problem.

190
0:08:34.259,000 --> 0:08:36,000
In fact, Apophis is a blessing in disguise,

191
0:08:36.551,000 --> 0:08:38,000
because it woke us up to the dangers of these things.

192
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
This thing was discovered just a few years ago

193
0:08:41.361,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and could hit us a few years from now.

194
0:08:43.228,000 --> 0:08:46,000
It won't, but it gives us a chance to study these kinds of asteroids.

195
0:08:46.866,000 --> 0:08:49,000
We didn't really necessarily understand these keyholes, and now we do,

196
0:08:50.396,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and it turns out that's really important,

197
0:08:52.564,000 --> 0:08:54,000
because how do you stop an asteroid like this?

198
0:08:55.066,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Well, let me ask you:

199
0:08:56.612,000 --> 0:08:59,000
What happens if you're standing in the road and a car's headed for you?

200
0:09:00.058,000 --> 0:09:01,000
What do you do?

201
0:09:01.252,000 --> 0:09:03,000
You do this. Right? Move, and the car goes past you.

202
0:09:03.73,000 --> 0:09:05,000
But we can't move the Earth, at least not easily,

203
0:09:06.074,000 --> 0:09:07,000
but we can move a small asteroid.

204
0:09:07.812,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And it turns out, we've even done it.

205
0:09:10.031,000 --> 0:09:13,000
In the year 2005, NASA launched a probe called Deep Impact,

206
0:09:14.016,000 --> 0:09:18,000
which slammed a piece of itself into the nucleus of a comet.

207
0:09:18.501,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Comets are very much like asteroids.

208
0:09:20.394,000 --> 0:09:22,000
The purpose wasn't to push it out of the way;

209
0:09:22.537,000 --> 0:09:25,000
the purpose was to make a crater to excavate the material

210
0:09:25.696,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and see what was underneath the surface of this comet,

211
0:09:28.275,000 --> 0:09:29,000
which we learned quite a bit about.

212
0:09:29.995,000 --> 0:09:31,000
We did move the comet a little tiny bit --

213
0:09:32.298,000 --> 0:09:33,000
not very much, but that wasn't the point.

214
0:09:34.299,000 --> 0:09:35,000
However, think about this:

215
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
This thing is orbiting the Sun at 10, 20 miles per second.

216
0:09:40.536,000 --> 0:09:42,000
We shot a space probe at it and hit it, OK?

217
0:09:43.259,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Imagine how hard that must be, and we did it.

218
0:09:45.914,000 --> 0:09:46,000
That means we can do it again.

219
0:09:47.741,000 --> 0:09:51,000
If we see an asteroid that's coming toward us, headed right for us,

220
0:09:51.904,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and we have two years to go?

221
0:09:53.61,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Boom! We hit it.

222
0:09:54.98,000 --> 0:09:56,000
You know, if you watch the movies --

223
0:09:57.527,000 --> 0:09:58,000
(Laughter)

224
0:09:58.609,000 --> 0:09:59,000
you might think:

225
0:09:59.785,000 --> 0:10:,000
Why don't we use a nuclear weapon?

226
0:10:01.446,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Well, you can try that, but the problem is timing.

227
0:10:03.823,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Shoot a nuclear weapon at this thing,

228
0:10:05.637,000 --> 0:10:07,000
you have to blow it up within a few milliseconds of tolerance,

229
0:10:08.593,000 --> 0:10:09,000
or else you'll miss it.

230
0:10:09.793,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And there are a lot of other problems with that; it's very hard to do.

231
0:10:13.118,000 --> 0:10:15,000
But just hitting something? That's pretty easy.

232
0:10:15.345,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I think even NASA can do that, and proved that they can.

233
0:10:18.007,000 --> 0:10:19,000
(Laughter)

234
0:10:19.04,000 --> 0:10:22,000
The problem is, if you hit this asteroid, you've changed the orbit,

235
0:10:22.493,000 --> 0:10:23,000
you measure the orbit,

236
0:10:23.669,000 --> 0:10:25,000
then you find out, oh yeah, we just pushed it into a keyhole,

237
0:10:26.62,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and now it's going to hit us in three years.

238
0:10:28.721,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Well, my opinion is: fine!

239
0:10:30.873,000 --> 0:10:31,000
It's not hitting us in six months --

240
0:10:32.766,000 --> 0:10:33,000
that's good.

241
0:10:33.952,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Now we have three years to do something else.

242
0:10:36.744,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And you can hit it again.

243
0:10:38.136,000 --> 0:10:39,000
That's kind of ham-fisted;

244
0:10:39.47,000 --> 0:10:41,000
you might just push it into a third keyhole or whatever,

245
0:10:42.163,000 --> 0:10:43,000
so you don't do that.

246
0:10:43.36,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And this is the part --

247
0:10:45.026,000 --> 0:10:46,000
it's the part I just love.

248
0:10:46.35,000 --> 0:10:48,000
(Laughter)

249
0:10:48.989,000 --> 0:10:52,000
After the big macho "Grr ... bam! We're gonna hit this thing in the face,"

250
0:10:53.471,000 --> 0:10:55,000
then we bring in the velvet gloves.

251
0:10:56.293,000 --> 0:10:57,000
(Laughter)

252
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
There's a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts,

253
0:11:01.073,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and they call themselves The B612 Foundation.

254
0:11:03.53,000 --> 0:11:05,000
For those of you who've read "The Little Prince,"

255
0:11:05.9,000 --> 0:11:06,000
you understand that reference, I hope --

256
0:11:07.892,000 --> 0:11:09,000
the little prince lived on an asteroid called B612.

257
0:11:10.371,000 --> 0:11:13,000
These are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts, like I said, engineers.

258
0:11:14.107,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Rusty Schweickart, who was an Apollo 9 astronaut, is on this.

259
0:11:17.391,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Dan Durda, my friend who made this image,

260
0:11:19.534,000 --> 0:11:22,000
works here at Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, on Walnut Street.

261
0:11:23.465,000 --> 0:11:24,000
He created this image for this.

262
0:11:25.024,000 --> 0:11:27,000
He's actually one of the astronomers who works for them.

263
0:11:27.702,000 --> 0:11:29,000
If we see an asteroid that's going to hit the Earth

264
0:11:30.329,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and we have enough time,

265
0:11:32.066,000 --> 0:11:34,000
we can hit it to move it into a better orbit.

266
0:11:34.445,000 --> 0:11:38,000
But then what we do is launch a probe that has to weigh a ton or two.

267
0:11:39.27,000 --> 0:11:41,000
It doesn't have to be huge -- a couple of tons, not that big --

268
0:11:42.28,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and you park it near the asteroid.

269
0:11:44.017,000 --> 0:11:47,000
You don't land on it, because these things are tumbling end over end.

270
0:11:47.372,000 --> 0:11:48,000
It's very hard to land on them.

271
0:11:48.992,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Instead you get near it.

272
0:11:50.178,000 --> 0:11:52,000
The gravity of the asteroid pulls on the probe,

273
0:11:52.426,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and the probe has a couple of tons of mass.

274
0:11:54.474,000 --> 0:11:55,000
It has a little tiny bit of gravity,

275
0:11:56.231,000 --> 0:11:59,000
but it's enough that it can pull the asteroid,

276
0:11:59.484,000 --> 0:12:,000
and you have your rocket set up --

277
0:12:01.133,000 --> 0:12:03,000
you can barely see it here, but there's rocket plumes --

278
0:12:04.026,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and these guys are connected by their own gravity,

279
0:12:07.424,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and if you move the probe very slowly -- very, very gently,

280
0:12:10.996,000 --> 0:12:15,000
you can very easily finesse that rock into a safe orbit.

281
0:12:16.043,000 --> 0:12:19,000
You can even put in orbit around the Earth where we could mine it,

282
0:12:19.192,000 --> 0:12:21,000
although that's a whole other thing; I won't go into that.

283
0:12:22.01,000 --> 0:12:23,000
(Laughter)

284
0:12:23.061,000 --> 0:12:24,000
But we'd be rich!

285
0:12:24.837,000 --> 0:12:29,000
(Laughter)

286
0:12:30.295,000 --> 0:12:32,000
So think about this, right?

287
0:12:33.005,000 --> 0:12:36,000
There are these giant rocks flying out there, and they're hitting us,

288
0:12:36.317,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and they're doing damage to us.

289
0:12:37.863,000 --> 0:12:38,000
But we've figured out how to do this,

290
0:12:39.696,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and all the pieces are in place to do this.

291
0:12:41.937,000 --> 0:12:44,000
We have astronomers with telescopes, looking for them.

292
0:12:45.162,000 --> 0:12:47,000
We have very, very smart people,

293
0:12:47.457,000 --> 0:12:5,000
who are concerned about this and figuring out how to fix the problem,

294
0:12:50.873,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and we have the technology to do this.

295
0:12:52.729,000 --> 0:12:54,000
This probe actually can't use chemical rockets.

296
0:12:54.955,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Chemical rockets provide too much thrust, too much push.

297
0:12:57.637,000 --> 0:12:58,000
The probe would just shoot away.

298
0:12:59.223,000 --> 0:13:01,000
We invented something called an ion drive,

299
0:13:01.298,000 --> 0:13:03,000
which is a very, very, very low-thrust engine.

300
0:13:03.876,000 --> 0:13:06,000
It generates the force a piece of paper would have on your hand --

301
0:13:07.209,000 --> 0:13:1,000
incredibly light, but it can run for months and years,

302
0:13:11.197,000 --> 0:13:13,000
providing that very gentle push.

303
0:13:13.551,000 --> 0:13:15,000
If anybody here is a fan of the original "Star Trek,"

304
0:13:16.164,000 --> 0:13:18,000
they ran across an alien ship that had an ion drive,

305
0:13:18.983,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and Spock said, "They're very technically sophisticated.

306
0:13:21.699,000 --> 0:13:23,000
They're a hundred years ahead of us with this drive."

307
0:13:24.224,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Yeah, we have an ion drive now.

308
0:13:25.794,000 --> 0:13:27,000
We don't have the Enterprise, but we've got an ion drive now.

309
0:13:28.8,000 --> 0:13:29,000
(Laughter)

310
0:13:30.77,000 --> 0:13:32,000
(Applause)

311
0:13:32.91,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Spock.

312
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
(Laughter)

313
0:13:36.316,000 --> 0:13:37,000
So ...

314
0:13:39.048,000 --> 0:13:4,000
That's the difference --

315
0:13:40.716,000 --> 0:13:42,000
that's the difference between us and the dinosaurs.

316
0:13:43.677,000 --> 0:13:44,000
This happened to them.

317
0:13:45.898,000 --> 0:13:46,000
It doesn't have to happen to us.

318
0:13:47.737,000 --> 0:13:5,000
The difference between the dinosaurs and us

319
0:13:50.919,000 --> 0:13:52,000
is that we have a space program

320
0:13:53.058,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and we can vote,

321
0:13:54.804,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and so we can change our future.

322
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
(Laughter)

323
0:13:58.821,000 --> 0:14:,000
We have the ability to change our future.

324
0:14:00.937,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Sixty-five million years from now,

325
0:14:02.938,000 --> 0:14:05,000
we don't have to have our bones collecting dust in a museum.

326
0:14:06.866,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Thank you very much.

327
0:14:08.058,000 --> 0:14:11,000
(Applause)

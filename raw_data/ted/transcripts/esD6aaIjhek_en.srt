Today I want to talk about the meaning of words,

2
0:00:16.42,000 --> 0:00:17,000
how we define them

3
0:00:17.74,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and how they, almost as revenge,

4
0:00:20.02,000 --> 0:00:21,000
define us.

5
0:00:21.3,000 --> 0:00:24,000
The English language is a magnificent sponge.

6
0:00:24.38,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I love the English language. I'm glad that I speak it.

7
0:00:27.06,000 --> 0:00:29,000
But for all that, it has a lot of holes.

8
0:00:30.3,000 --> 0:00:32,000
In Greek, there's a word, "lachesism"

9
0:00:32.66,000 --> 0:00:35,000
which is the hunger for disaster.

10
0:00:36.54,000 --> 0:00:39,000
You know, when you see a thunderstorm on the horizon

11
0:00:40.14,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and you just find yourself rooting for the storm.

12
0:00:43.9,000 --> 0:00:44,000

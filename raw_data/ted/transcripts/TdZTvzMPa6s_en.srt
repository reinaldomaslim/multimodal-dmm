1
0:00:13.992,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Yes, it's dark.

2
0:00:16.968,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'm wondering how long we can all stand it

3
0:00:20.421,000 --> 0:00:24,000
without picking up our phone and turning the flashlights on.

4
0:00:25.847,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Seconds?

5
0:00:27.689,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Minutes?

6
0:00:29.276,000 --> 0:00:3,000
A whole hour?

7
0:00:33.768,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Don't worry, I'm not going to give you my whole speech in the dark.

8
0:00:38.606,000 --> 0:00:4,000
But it's something I'm used to.

9
0:00:41.146,000 --> 0:00:46,000
For more than 10 years, I and two million people back home

10
0:00:46.368,000 --> 0:00:48,000
have been living in darkness,

11
0:00:49.264,000 --> 0:00:51,000
locked between two borders

12
0:00:51.756,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that are nearly impossible to leave, literally,

13
0:00:56.623,000 --> 0:01:02,000
in an area that spans 25 miles long and about five miles wide.

14
0:01:03.942,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I am Palestinian, and I am from Gaza.

15
0:01:07.903,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I grew up there and I still live there.

16
0:01:12.82,000 --> 0:01:16,000
In Gaza, we have a whole lot of nothing.

17
0:01:17.812,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And I aim to create something from that nothing.

18
0:01:21.315,000 --> 0:01:24,000
When a community is cut off from the world,

19
0:01:24.427,000 --> 0:01:25,000
all that we need to do is ... what?

20
0:01:26.403,000 --> 0:01:28,000
To think outside the box.

21
0:01:28.871,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Way outside the box.

22
0:01:32.911,000 --> 0:01:36,000
That thinking led me to two projects

23
0:01:37.151,000 --> 0:01:4,000
to address two serious issues in my community.

24
0:01:41.818,000 --> 0:01:45,000
The need for building materials and the need for electricity and energy.

25
0:01:47.133,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Two essential ingredients of life.

26
0:01:51.077,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Both are in lack of supply in Gaza.

27
0:01:57.323,000 --> 0:01:59,000
First, I'm not here ...

28
0:02:01.791,000 --> 0:02:04,000
just to talk about the occupation we have back home.

29
0:02:05.902,000 --> 0:02:09,000
The siege, the wars, the bombs, the protests

30
0:02:10.695,000 --> 0:02:11,000
or the death toll.

31
0:02:12.545,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I am here because I wanted to show that we can live through it all.

32
0:02:18.497,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I am here because I wanted to make a change.

33
0:02:21.949,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I am here to tell you

34
0:02:23.719,000 --> 0:02:26,000
that I am a statistic that cannot be ignored.

35
0:02:29.953,000 --> 0:02:34,000
In the 2014 war, thousands of houses were destroyed.

36
0:02:36.421,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Those houses were made from sunbaked stones and blocks.

37
0:02:43.48,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Those houses stood for decades and decades.

38
0:02:47.313,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Those houses were for my family, friends, neighbors,

39
0:02:51.49,000 --> 0:02:52,000
everyone I know.

40
0:02:54.587,000 --> 0:02:56,000
At that time, I asked myself a question:

41
0:02:56.793,000 --> 0:02:57,000
What can I do for people?

42
0:02:58.952,000 --> 0:02:59,000
How can I help them?

43
0:03:01.151,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I knew we weren't able to get cement, aggregate and sand

44
0:03:08.151,000 --> 0:03:1,000
to rebuild what the war destroyed.

45
0:03:11.191,000 --> 0:03:15,000
But also, maybe we can use something from inside the community,

46
0:03:15.919,000 --> 0:03:16,000
something we already had.

47
0:03:18.911,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I started to put things together.

48
0:03:20.955,000 --> 0:03:24,000
First, paper as a filler, instead of the aggregate we import.

49
0:03:25.839,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But that did not work out.

50
0:03:27.823,000 --> 0:03:32,000
What about using glass powder to replace part of the cement?

51
0:03:33.685,000 --> 0:03:34,000
But that failed, too.

52
0:03:36.098,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I guessed making building blocks out of mud would be a great idea.

53
0:03:40.479,000 --> 0:03:42,000
But unfortunately, it didn't work out.

54
0:03:43.673,000 --> 0:03:46,000
During the process of burning the mud blocks,

55
0:03:47.506,000 --> 0:03:5,000
we had a huge amount of ashes.

56
0:03:51.815,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And I was like, "Why don't we use those ashes?"

57
0:03:55.704,000 --> 0:03:57,000
The idea flashed in my mind.

58
0:03:57.887,000 --> 0:04:01,000
"Let's use it and combine it with the rubble of the demolished houses

59
0:04:02.632,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and make building blocks out of it."

60
0:04:06.378,000 --> 0:04:1,000
After more than 150 failed experiments,

61
0:04:10.649,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and over six months of research,

62
0:04:13.585,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I actually made it.

63
0:04:16.688,000 --> 0:04:22,000
(Applause)

64
0:04:23.508,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I created a building block

65
0:04:27.99,000 --> 0:04:3,000
out of the ashes and rubble of the demolished houses.

66
0:04:34.371,000 --> 0:04:36,000
It's here, it came all the way with me.

67
0:04:36.847,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Well, it came before me.

68
0:04:39.45,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So, it's lighter,

69
0:04:41.871,000 --> 0:04:43,000
it's cheaper, and it's stronger.

70
0:04:46.094,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Applause)

71
0:04:55.262,000 --> 0:04:56,000
This building block --

72
0:04:56.823,000 --> 0:04:59,000
of course, you ask yourself, "How did this girl do it?"

73
0:04:59.974,000 --> 0:05:01,000
It's not that hard, and it's not that easy.

74
0:05:02.831,000 --> 0:05:05,000
First, we collected rubble from all around the Gaza Strip.

75
0:05:07.419,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Then we combined it with the ashes that came from the landfills.

76
0:05:11.68,000 --> 0:05:13,000
When the recipe is done, it's time for baking.

77
0:05:14.855,000 --> 0:05:17,000
So we mold the blocks, as you can see in the photo,

78
0:05:18.03,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and we cure it using water steam.

79
0:05:22.046,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I call the material "Green Cake,"

80
0:05:24.569,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and people now can use it not only to rebuild old houses,

81
0:05:28.507,000 --> 0:05:31,000
but also to build new complete structures.

82
0:05:32.95,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Green Cake so far has created jobs for more than 30 people.

83
0:05:37.688,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And we were able to rebuild around 50 apartments,

84
0:05:42.506,000 --> 0:05:46,000
each one of them the size of a household almost for eight people.

85
0:05:48.704,000 --> 0:05:54,000
We also trained fresh graduates, female and male,

86
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
which is not very common in the community.

87
0:05:59.538,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And we got several awards, locally and globally.

88
0:06:03.198,000 --> 0:06:06,000
This block is not just only a building block.

89
0:06:06.306,000 --> 0:06:08,000
It changed the stereotype about women in Gaza

90
0:06:09.152,000 --> 0:06:12,000
that stated this type of work is meant for men.

91
0:06:15.242,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Education is the strongest weapon we have

92
0:06:19.267,000 --> 0:06:22,000
to fight for our freedom, decent life and future.

93
0:06:24.284,000 --> 0:06:27,000
My background helped me to do this block.

94
0:06:27.498,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I went to the Islamic University of Gaza, and I studied civil engineering,

95
0:06:31.633,000 --> 0:06:34,000
where there was a one-to-six female-to-male ratio.

96
0:06:36.228,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Everyone told me I would end up without a job.

97
0:06:40.18,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I went for a major that's meant for men.

98
0:06:44.204,000 --> 0:06:48,000
But their lack of encouragement did not deter me; it inspired me.

99
0:06:49.978,000 --> 0:06:55,000
(Applause)

100
0:06:57.112,000 --> 0:07:,000
After this long journey with the block, and after two years,

101
0:07:00.873,000 --> 0:07:03,000
what Gaza does need is not just building blocks.

102
0:07:04.744,000 --> 0:07:06,000
We also need electricity, we need the energy.

103
0:07:09.013,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I developed a new company called SunBox.

104
0:07:13.363,000 --> 0:07:16,000
SunBox is a smart solar kit that we source from China,

105
0:07:16.792,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and we engineer it to fit the market need.

106
0:07:19.942,000 --> 0:07:22,000
It powers not only light, but also laptops, phones,

107
0:07:23.711,000 --> 0:07:25,000
internet connection, a fan or a TV.

108
0:07:26.743,000 --> 0:07:28,000
We teach local vendors and technicians

109
0:07:29.219,000 --> 0:07:32,000
to sell, install and provide customer services for people.

110
0:07:34.303,000 --> 0:07:36,000
We got the project off the ground

111
0:07:36.565,000 --> 0:07:39,000
by providing 15 families with solar energy.

112
0:07:40.883,000 --> 0:07:42,000
One of the solar units we installed in a refugee camp.

113
0:07:43.494,000 --> 0:07:45,000
The next day I came to check what happened with the solar,

114
0:07:46.429,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and I found a whole neighborhood watching a football match

115
0:07:49.257,000 --> 0:07:5,000
using our device.

116
0:07:50.586,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I was like, "Wow, that's going to create a huge impact in the community."

117
0:07:55.41,000 --> 0:07:58,000
That encouraged us to go to the second round

118
0:07:58.549,000 --> 0:08:01,000
of bringing 200 units.

119
0:08:02.156,000 --> 0:08:04,000
But each unit costs around 350 dollars.

120
0:08:05.339,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And a Palestinian family can't afford the 350 dollars.

121
0:08:08.792,000 --> 0:08:1,000
So we had to think, again, outside the box:

122
0:08:10.966,000 --> 0:08:11,000
How can we make this happen?

123
0:08:13.006,000 --> 0:08:17,000
If a whole neighborhood can watch a football match using one device,

124
0:08:17.246,000 --> 0:08:2,000
it means two, three and four families can share one device

125
0:08:21.142,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and enjoy the electricity.

126
0:08:24.111,000 --> 0:08:26,000
What we did is, we created a new business model

127
0:08:26.371,000 --> 0:08:28,000
called "sharing is caring."

128
0:08:29.141,000 --> 0:08:3,000
(Laughter)

129
0:08:31.093,000 --> 0:08:33,000
The sharing is caring business model

130
0:08:33.529,000 --> 0:08:36,000
says two families share one unit, three families share one unit,

131
0:08:37.331,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and they split the cost, so they can afford paying for it.

132
0:08:40.871,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Well, the idea caught on.

133
0:08:42.76,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I didn't expect that, but it just happened.

134
0:08:45.673,000 --> 0:08:46,000
In less than two weeks,

135
0:08:46.964,000 --> 0:08:5,000
we were able to provide over 200 people with electricity.

136
0:08:51.674,000 --> 0:08:56,000
(Applause)

137
0:08:57.519,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And the question here: How did the idea catch on?

138
0:09:01.149,000 --> 0:09:03,000
We went to community centers --

139
0:09:03.531,000 --> 0:09:04,000
those are places, you know for whom?

140
0:09:05.467,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Only for men.

141
0:09:06.649,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So it was so weird for a woman to go there.

142
0:09:08.76,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And I told them, "We have a great idea.

143
0:09:10.696,000 --> 0:09:11,000
We will give you electricity,

144
0:09:12.125,000 --> 0:09:14,000
you give us people who need this electricity."

145
0:09:16.641,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Now, families are approaching us from all around the Gaza Strip.

146
0:09:20.133,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I received a phone call from the team this morning, saying,

147
0:09:22.934,000 --> 0:09:25,000
"Majd, please, we are under pressure, we work 16 hours a day,

148
0:09:26.475,000 --> 0:09:28,000
we will not be able to work like this.

149
0:09:28.539,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Families are calling us every second. They want solar energy."

150
0:09:33.569,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Muna, from one of the families we installed the solar unit for,

151
0:09:37.546,000 --> 0:09:39,000
she told me, "You know, Majd,

152
0:09:40.536,000 --> 0:09:43,000
I've never imagined I will control something in my life.

153
0:09:44.664,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Now I can control my source of energy.

154
0:09:47.935,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I feel so special."

155
0:09:50.133,000 --> 0:09:54,000
What you take for granted is a privilege for others.

156
0:09:56.494,000 --> 0:09:57,000
People like Muna.

157
0:09:58.545,000 --> 0:10:,000
She doesn't want to fight.

158
0:10:00.772,000 --> 0:10:04,000
She doesn't want to stay in a bad life.

159
0:10:05.061,000 --> 0:10:07,000
She's only looking for a better life.

160
0:10:08.18,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Our vision, or I would say, everyone's vision in Gaza --

161
0:10:12.792,000 --> 0:10:15,000
which I am very privileged to represent the people back home --

162
0:10:16.614,000 --> 0:10:19,000
is to have a good life, a future.

163
0:10:21.4,000 --> 0:10:23,000
We need to build the infrastructure of hope.

164
0:10:23.86,000 --> 0:10:26,000
We want to tell them it's possible to happen,

165
0:10:26.942,000 --> 0:10:28,000
it's possible to be treated as a human being.

166
0:10:29.736,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I don't have to cross four borders to come here.

167
0:10:32.205,000 --> 0:10:33,000
I can just go to the airport,

168
0:10:33.932,000 --> 0:10:34,000
see the people outside,

169
0:10:35.302,000 --> 0:10:37,000
see what the world looks like.

170
0:10:38.651,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Thank you so much.

171
0:10:39.897,000 --> 0:10:43,000
(Applause)

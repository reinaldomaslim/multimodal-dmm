1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I'd like to speak about technology trends,

2
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:33,000
which is something that many of you follow --

3
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
but we also follow, for related reasons.

4
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Obviously, being a technology magazine, technology trends

5
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:44,000
are something that we write about and need to know about.

6
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:47,000
But also it's part of being any monthly magazine --

7
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:5,000
you live in the future. And we have a long lead-time.

8
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:52,000
We have to plan issues many months in advance;

9
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:55,000
we have to guess at what public appetites are going to be six months,

10
0:00:55,000 --> 0:01:,000
nine months down the road. So we're in the forecasting business.

11
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:02,000
We also, like a lot of companies, create a product

12
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that's based on technology trends.

13
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:08,000
In this case, ours is about ideas and information, and, if we're lucky,

14
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:12,000
some entertainment. But the concept's quite the same.

15
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And so we have to understand

16
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:16,000
not only why tech's important, where it's going,

17
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
but also, very importantly, when -- the timing is everything.

18
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And it's interesting, when you look at the predictions made

19
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
during the peak of the boom in the 1990s, about e-commerce,

20
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:36,000
or Internet traffic, or broadband adoption, or Internet advertising,

21
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:4,000
they were all right -- they were just wrong in time.

22
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Almost every one of those has come true just a few years later.

23
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But the difference of a few years on stock-market valuations

24
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:52,000
is obviously extreme. And that's why timing is everything.

25
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:54,000
You've probably seen something like this before.

26
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:56,000
This is the classic Gartner Hype Curve, which talks about

27
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:59,000
kind of the trajectory of a technology's lifespan.

28
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And just for fun, we put a bunch of technologies on it,

29
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:05,000
to show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak,

30
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:06,000
or whether they were about to crash

31
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:09,000
into the trough of disillusionment,

32
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:14,000
or rise back in the slope of enlightenment, etc.

33
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And this is one way to do technology forecasting: get a sense

34
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:21,000
of where technology is and then anticipate the next upturn.

35
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:24,000
We tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important;

36
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:28,000
we'll typically do it twice. Once, we want to do it first.

37
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:31,000
We want to be the first to do it, for the geeks who appreciate that,

38
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:33,000
we'll catch it right there at the technology-trigger.

39
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
You can see in 1997, we put Linux on the cover.

40
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:41,000
But then it comes back. And sufficiently big technologies

41
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:43,000
are going to hit the mainstream, and they're going to burst out.

42
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And then it's time to do it again. Last year.

43
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And that's one way that we try to time technology trends.

44
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends

45
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that I call my "grand unified theory of predicting the future,"

46
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:05,000
but it's closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future.

47
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:08,000
It's based on the presumption, the observation even,

48
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that all important technologies go through four stages in their life --

49
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:17,000
at least one of the four stages, sometimes all four of the stages.

50
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And at each one of these stages, can be seen as a collision --

51
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:25,000
a collision with something else --

52
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:29,000
for example, a critical price-line that changes both the technology

53
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and also changes its effect on the world. It's an inflection point.

54
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And these are the inflection points that tell you

55
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:4,000
what the next chapter in that technology's life is going to be,

56
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and maybe how you can do something about it.

57
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:46,000
The first is the critical price.

58
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:48,000
The first stage in a technology's advance

59
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:52,000
is that it'll fall below a critical price.

60
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:54,000
After it falls below a critical price, it will tend,

61
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:59,000
if it's successful, to rise above a critical mass, a penetration.

62
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Many technologies, at that point, displace another technology,

63
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and that's another important point.

64
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And then finally, a lot of technologies commoditize.

65
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Towards the end of their life, they become nearly free.

66
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it;

67
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:2,000
it's an opportunity for the technology to change.

68
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And even if you missed, you know, the first boom of Wi-Fi --

69
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:28,000
you know, Wi-Fi did the critical price, it did the critical mass,

70
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:31,000
but hasn't done displacement yet, and hasn't done free yet --

71
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:33,000
there's still more opportunity in that.

72
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I'd like to demonstrate what I mean by this

73
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:37,000
by telling the story of the DVD,

74
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:4,000
which is a technology which has done all of these.

75
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:43,000
The DVD, as you know, was introduced in the mid-1990s

76
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and it was quite expensive. But you can see that by 1998,

77
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:53,000
it had fallen below 400 dollars, and 400 dollars was a psychological threshold.

78
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And it started to take off. And you can see that the units

79
0:04:57,000 --> 0:05:03,000
started to trend up, the hidden inflection point -- it was taking off.

80
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:08,000
The next thing it hit, a year later, was critical mass. In this case,

81
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:12,000
20 percent is often a good proxy for critical mass in a household.

82
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And what's interesting here

83
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:19,000
is that something else took off along with it: home-theater units.

84
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Suddenly you have a DVD in the house;

85
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:23,000
you've got high-quality digital video;

86
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:25,000
you have a reason to have a big-screen television;

87
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:29,000
you have a reason for Dolby 5.1 surround-sound.

88
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them,

89
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and bring the rest of your entertainment in.

90
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
What's interesting also is -- note that Netflix was founded in 1999.

91
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Reed Hastings is here. He clearly saw that that was a moment,

92
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that was an inflection point that he could do something with.

93
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:48,000
The next phase it hit was displacement.

94
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:52,000
You can see around 2001 it finally out-sold the VCR.

95
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And here too, you can see the implications in the world at large.

96
0:05:58,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Netflix was right -- the Netflix model could capitalize on the DVD

97
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:05,000
in a way that the video-rental stores couldn't.

98
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Among the DVD's many assets is that it's very small;

99
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:11,000
you can stick it in the mailer and post it cheaply.

100
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:15,000
That gave an advantage; that was an implication

101
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:19,000
of the technology's rise that wasn't obvious to everybody.

102
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And then finally, DVDs are approaching free.

103
0:06:22,000 --> 0:06:24,000
There's a company called Apex, a no-name Chinese firm,

104
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:28,000
who has, several times in the past year, been the number-one

105
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:35,000
DVD seller in America. Their average price, for last year, was 48 dollars.

106
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:37,000
You're aware of the

107
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:41,000
perhaps apocryphal Wal-Mart stampede

108
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:45,000
over the 30-dollar DVD.

109
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:47,000
But they're getting very, very cheap,

110
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and look at the interesting implication of it. As they get cheaper,

111
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:54,000
the premium brands, the Sonys and such, are losing market share,

112
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and the no-names, the Apexes, are gaining them.

113
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:58,000
They're being commodified, and that's what happens

114
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:03,000
when things go to zero. It's a tough market out there.

115
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:06,000
(Laughter)

116
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Now they've introduced these four ways of looking at technology,

117
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:11,000
these four stages of technology's life.

118
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I'd like to talk about some other technologies out there,

119
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:17,000
just technologies on our radar -- and I'll use this lens,

120
0:07:17,000 --> 0:07:19,000
these four, as a way to kind of tell you

121
0:07:19,000 --> 0:07:22,000
where each one of those technologies is in its development.

122
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:25,000
They're not necessarily the top-10 technologies out there --

123
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:26,000
they're just examples of technologies

124
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that are in each one of these periods.

125
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:32,000
But I think that the implications of them approaching

126
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:35,000
these crossovers, these intersections, are interesting to think about.

127
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Start with gene sequencing.

128
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:4,000
As you probably know, gene sequencing -- in a large part,

129
0:07:4,000 --> 0:07:43,000
because it's built on computers -- is falling in price

130
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:45,000
at a kind of a Moore's Law-like level.

131
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:48,000
It is now possible -- will be possible,

132
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and if Craig Venter indeed comes today,

133
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:52,000
he may tell you something about this --

134
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:57,000
to sequence the human genome for 40 million dollars by the end of this year.

135
0:07:57,000 --> 0:08:02,000
That's as opposed to billions just a few years ago.

136
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:07,000
You know, our ability to capture the tools of creation

137
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:09,000
is getting closer and closer.

138
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:12,000
What's interesting is that at the same time, the number of genes

139
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:14,000
that we're discovering is rising very quickly.

140
0:08:14,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Each one of these genes has potential diagnostic test.

141
0:08:17,000 --> 0:08:19,000
There will come a day

142
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:23,000
when you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done, very cheaply,

143
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:28,000
if you want to know. You can learn about your own mosaic.

144
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Here's another technology that's approaching a critical price.

145
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:35,000
This is a fascinating research from WHO that shows the effect

146
0:08:35,000 --> 0:08:42,000
of generic drugs on anti-retroviral drug compounds and cocktails.

147
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:48,000
In January 2000, the price was 10,000 dollars, or 27 dollars a day.

148
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:51,000
The generics came in, first in Brazil and elsewhere,

149
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and the effect was just dramatic on pricing.

150
0:08:55,000 --> 0:09:,000
Today it's less than 50 cents a day.

151
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And what's interesting is if you look at the price elasticity,

152
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:08,000
if you look at the correlation between these two,

153
0:09:08,000 --> 0:09:11,000
as the anti-retrovirals come down, the number of people you can treat

154
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:17,000
goes radically up. And the Clinton Foundation and WHO

155
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:21,000
believe that they can treat three million people worldwide by 2005 --

156
0:09:21,000 --> 0:09:23,000
two million in sub-Saharan Africa.

157
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that.

158
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Linux is another good example.

159
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Now we've switched to critical mass.

160
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:32,000
These are now technologies that are hitting critical mass.

161
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:38,000
If you look here, here's Linux in red, and it's hit 20 percent.

162
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Interestingly, it's done a crossover before,

163
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:42,000
but not the crossovers that matter.

164
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:45,000
The crossover that's going to matter is the one with the blue.

165
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:47,000
But you can look and see the direction those lines are going,

166
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:5,000
you can see that at the 20 percent, it's now taken seriously.

167
0:09:5,000 --> 0:09:54,000
It's not just for the geeks any more.

168
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:56,000
That is, I imagine, what people in Redmond

169
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:58,000
wake up in the middle of the night thinking about.

170
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:,000
(Laughter)

171
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Another technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars.

172
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:07,000
I don't know whether anybody has a Prius 2004, but they're fantastic.

173
0:10:07,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And if you look at the trends here, by about 2008 --

174
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and I don't think this is a crazy forecast --

175
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:15,000
they'll be two percent of auto sales.

176
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Two percent isn't 20 percent, but in the car business,

177
0:10:18,000 --> 0:10:24,000
which is slow moving, that's huge; that's arrival.

178
0:10:24,000 --> 0:10:27,000
At two percent, you start seeing them on the roads everywhere.

179
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And what's interesting about the hybrids taking off

180
0:10:31,000 --> 0:10:35,000
is you've now introduced electric motors to the automobile industry.

181
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:39,000
It's the first radical change in automobile technology in 100 years.

182
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And once you have electric motors, you can do anything:

183
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:45,000
you can change the structure of the car in any way you want.

184
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:48,000
You can have regenerative braking; you can have drive-by-wire;

185
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:5,000
you can have replaceable body shapes --

186
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:52,000
it's a little thing that starts with a hybrid,

187
0:10:52,000 --> 0:10:55,000
but it can lead to a whole new era of the car.

188
0:10:55,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Voice Over IP is something you may have heard something about.

189
0:10:58,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Again, it's kind of coming out of nowhere;

190
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:01,000
it's a little hard to use right now.

191
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:05,000
There's a company created by the Kazaa founders called Skype.

192
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Look at these numbers. They launched it in August of last year;

193
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:13,000
they already have nearly four million registered users --

194
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:16,000
that's critical mass.

195
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And the same thing's happening on the carrier side.

196
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:23,000
You're looking at IP taking over from some of the traditional

197
0:11:23,000 --> 0:11:27,000
telecom standards. This is a tipping point --

198
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:31,000
if Malcolm's here, forgive me -- and it's going to change the economics,

199
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and the speed, and the players in the industry.

200
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:41,000
It's going to look a little bit like that.

201
0:11:41,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And finally, free. Free is really, really interesting.

202
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Free is something that comes with digital, because

203
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:59,000
the reproduction costs are essentially free. It comes with IP,

204
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:02,000
because it's such an efficient protocol. It comes with fiber optics,

205
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:03,000
because there's so much bandwidth.

206
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Free is really, you know, the gift of Silicon Valley to the world.

207
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:11,000
It's an economic force; it's a technical force.

208
0:12:11,000 --> 0:12:15,000
It's a deflationary force, if not handled right.

209
0:12:15,000 --> 0:12:18,000
It is abundance, as opposed to scarcity.

210
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Free is probably the most interesting thing.

211
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And here you have just the number of songs

212
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:25,000
that can be stored on a hard drive.

213
0:12:25,000 --> 0:12:29,000
You know, there could be a film's [unclear] there,

214
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:32,000
but it's basically, every song ever made could be stored

215
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:39,000
on 400 dollars worth of storage by 2008. It takes that entire element,

216
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:43,000
the physical element, of songs off the table.

217
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:44,000
And you've seen the numbers.

218
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:48,000
I mean, you know, the music industry is imploding

219
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:51,000
in front of our very eyes, and Hollywood's worried as well.

220
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:56,000
They're facing a force that they haven't faced before.

221
0:12:56,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And their response is draconian, and not necessarily

222
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:07,000
the one that's going to get them out of this.

223
0:13:07,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And finally, I'll give you one last example of free --

224
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:13,000
perhaps the most powerful of all. I mentioned fiber optics --

225
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:15,000
their abundance tends to make things free.

226
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:19,000
This is the price of a phone call to India per minute.

227
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And what's interesting is that it was just 1990

228
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:25,000
when it was more than two dollars a minute.

229
0:13:25,000 --> 0:13:33,000
India had, still has, a regulated phone system and so did we.

230
0:13:33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
It was surprisingly non-innovative, moved very slowly,

231
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:41,000
but then there was just so much fiber out there,

232
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:45,000
you couldn't hold back, and look how quickly the price fell.

233
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:49,000
It's seven cents a minute, in many cases.

234
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:54,000
And the consequence of cheap phone calling, free phone calling,

235
0:13:54,000 --> 0:13:59,000
to India, is the pissed-off programmer, is the outsourcing.

236
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:03,000
It is probably one of the most dramatic shifts in globalization

237
0:14:03,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and one of the most powerful economic tools

238
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:07,000
that we're seeing in our world today.

239
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:12,000
The force of India, and then China, and any other country

240
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:14,000
that can contact our markets

241
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and will work with our companies -- because the communications are free --

242
0:14:19,000 --> 0:14:21,000
is just beginning to be felt.

243
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:22,000
And I think that's probably one

244
0:14:22,000 --> 0:14:24,000
of the most important technology trends that we're looking at today.

245
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Thank you.

1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I don't come to you today as an expert.

2
0:00:14.68,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I come to you as someone who has been really interested

3
0:00:17.64,000 --> 0:00:2,000
in how I get better at what I do

4
0:00:20.72,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and how we all do.

5
0:00:23,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I think it's not just how good you are now,

6
0:00:25.08,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I think it's how good you're going to be that really matters.

7
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I was visiting this birth center in the north of India.

8
0:00:32.64,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I was watching the birth attendants,

9
0:00:34.8,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and I realized I was witnessing in them an extreme form of this very struggle,

10
0:00:39.72,000 --> 0:00:43,000
which is how people improve in the face of complexity --

11
0:00:43.84,000 --> 0:00:44,000
or don't.

12
0:00:46.2,000 --> 0:00:48,000
The women here are delivering in a region

13
0:00:48.76,000 --> 0:00:52,000
where the typical birth center has a one-in-20 death rate for the babies,

14
0:00:54.72,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and the moms are dying at a rate ten times higher than they do elsewhere.

15
0:00:59.64,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Now, we've known the critical practices

16
0:01:02.28,000 --> 0:01:04,000
that stop the big killers in birth for decades,

17
0:01:05.64,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and the thing about it is that even in this place --

18
0:01:09.64,000 --> 0:01:1,000
in this place especially,

19
0:01:11.08,000 --> 0:01:12,000
the simplest things are not simple.

20
0:01:13.4,000 --> 0:01:16,000
We know for example you should wash hands and put on clean gloves,

21
0:01:18.28,000 --> 0:01:19,000
but here,

22
0:01:19.6,000 --> 0:01:21,000
the tap is in another room,

23
0:01:22.4,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and they don't have clean gloves.

24
0:01:25.68,000 --> 0:01:26,000
To reuse their gloves,

25
0:01:26.96,000 --> 0:01:28,000
they wash them in this basin of dilute bleach,

26
0:01:30.56,000 --> 0:01:33,000
but you can see there's still blood on the gloves from the last delivery.

27
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Ten percent of babies are born with difficulty breathing everywhere.

28
0:01:43.44,000 --> 0:01:44,000
We know what to do.

29
0:01:44.72,000 --> 0:01:47,000
You dry the baby with a clean cloth to stimulate them to breathe.

30
0:01:48.92,000 --> 0:01:49,000
If they don't start to breathe,

31
0:01:50.64,000 --> 0:01:51,000
you suction out their airways.

32
0:01:52.56,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And if that doesn't work, you give them breaths with the baby mask.

33
0:01:57.52,000 --> 0:02:01,000
But these are skills that they've learned mostly from textbooks,

34
0:02:01.8,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and that baby mask is broken.

35
0:02:09.6,000 --> 0:02:11,000
In this one disturbing image for me

36
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:16,000
is a picture that brings home just how dire the situation is.

37
0:02:17.04,000 --> 0:02:19,000
This is a baby 10 minutes after birth,

38
0:02:19.4,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and he's alive,

39
0:02:22.039,000 --> 0:02:23,000
but only just.

40
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
No clean cloth,

41
0:02:25.56,000 --> 0:02:26,000
has not been dried,

42
0:02:27.68,000 --> 0:02:28,000
not warming skin to skin,

43
0:02:31.44,000 --> 0:02:33,000
an unsterile clamp across the cord.

44
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
He's an infection waiting to happen,

45
0:02:35.96,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and he's losing his temperature by the minute.

46
0:02:41.12,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Successful child delivery requires a successful team of people.

47
0:02:45.28,000 --> 0:02:47,000
A whole team has to be skilled and coordinated;

48
0:02:47.52,000 --> 0:02:49,000
the nurses who do the deliveries in a place like this,

49
0:02:50.52,000 --> 0:02:51,000
the doctor who backs them up,

50
0:02:52.2,000 --> 0:02:56,000
the supply clerk who's responsible for 22 critical drugs and supplies

51
0:02:56.8,000 --> 0:02:58,000
being in stock and at the bedside,

52
0:02:59.2,000 --> 0:03:,000
the medical officer in charge,

53
0:03:00.8,000 --> 0:03:03,000
responsible for the quality of the whole facility.

54
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:08,000
The thing is they are all experienced professionals.

55
0:03:09.8,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I didn't meet anybody who hadn't been part of thousands of deliveries.

56
0:03:15.36,000 --> 0:03:17,000
But against the complexities that they face,

57
0:03:18.08,000 --> 0:03:2,000
they seem to be at their limits.

58
0:03:21.12,000 --> 0:03:23,000
They were not getting better anymore.

59
0:03:25.36,000 --> 0:03:28,000
It's how good you're going to be that really matters.

60
0:03:32.2,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It presses on a fundamental question.

61
0:03:35.24,000 --> 0:03:39,000
How do professionals get better at what they do?

62
0:03:39.88,000 --> 0:03:4,000
How do they get great?

63
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And there are two views about this.

64
0:03:42.88,000 --> 0:03:44,000
One is the traditional pedagogical view.

65
0:03:45.52,000 --> 0:03:46,000
That is that you go to school,

66
0:03:47.2,000 --> 0:03:5,000
you study, you practice, you learn, you graduate,

67
0:03:50.84,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and then you go out into the world

68
0:03:52.52,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and you make your way on your own.

69
0:03:54.2,000 --> 0:03:58,000
A professional is someone who is capable of managing their own improvement.

70
0:03:59.4,000 --> 0:04:03,000
That is the approach that virtually all professionals have learned by.

71
0:04:04.36,000 --> 0:04:05,000
That's how doctors learn,

72
0:04:05.64,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that's how lawyers do,

73
0:04:07.08,000 --> 0:04:08,000
scientists ...

74
0:04:09.52,000 --> 0:04:1,000
musicians.

75
0:04:12.96,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And the thing is, it works.

76
0:04:15.36,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Consider for example legendary Juilliard violin instructor Dorothy DeLay.

77
0:04:20.56,000 --> 0:04:23,000
She trained an amazing roster of violin virtuosos:

78
0:04:24.28,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Midori, Sarah Chang, Itzhak Perlman.

79
0:04:26.84,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Each of them came to her as young talents,

80
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and they worked with her over years.

81
0:04:32.64,000 --> 0:04:33,000
What she worked on most, she said,

82
0:04:34.32,000 --> 0:04:38,000
was inculcating in them habits of thinking and of learning

83
0:04:38.88,000 --> 0:04:4,000
so that they could make their way in the world without her

84
0:04:41.64,000 --> 0:04:42,000
when they were done.

85
0:04:45.2,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Now, the contrasting view comes out of sports.

86
0:04:50.08,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And they say "You are never done,

87
0:04:52.8,000 --> 0:04:53,000
everybody needs a coach."

88
0:04:54.76,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Everyone.

89
0:04:56.4,000 --> 0:04:58,000
The greatest in the world needs a coach.

90
0:05:01.36,000 --> 0:05:03,000
So I tried to think about this as a surgeon.

91
0:05:05.64,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Pay someone to come into my operating room,

92
0:05:10.12,000 --> 0:05:12,000
observe me and critique me.

93
0:05:14.12,000 --> 0:05:15,000
That seems absurd.

94
0:05:16.56,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Expertise means not needing to be coached.

95
0:05:20.76,000 --> 0:05:21,000
So then which view is right?

96
0:05:25.08,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I learned that coaching came into sports as a very American idea.

97
0:05:30.96,000 --> 0:05:31,000
In 1875,

98
0:05:32.44,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Harvard and Yale played one of the very first American-rules football games.

99
0:05:36.84,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Yale hired a head coach;

100
0:05:39.6,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Harvard did not.

101
0:05:41.4,000 --> 0:05:42,000
The results?

102
0:05:42.64,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Over the next three decades,

103
0:05:44.2,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Harvard won just four times.

104
0:05:47.64,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Harvard hired a coach.

105
0:05:50.32,000 --> 0:05:51,000
(Laughter)

106
0:05:52.12,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And it became the way that sports works.

107
0:05:56,000 --> 0:05:57,000
But is it necessary then?

108
0:05:57.52,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Does it transfer into other fields?

109
0:06:01.24,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I decided to ask, of all people,

110
0:06:03.6,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Itzhak Perlman.

111
0:06:05.96,000 --> 0:06:07,000
He had trained the Dorothy DeLay way

112
0:06:08.32,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and became arguably the greatest violinist of his generation.

113
0:06:12.84,000 --> 0:06:15,000
One of the beautiful things about getting to write for "The New Yorker"

114
0:06:16.24,000 --> 0:06:18,000
is I call people up, and they return my phone calls.

115
0:06:19.08,000 --> 0:06:2,000
(Laughter)

116
0:06:20.64,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And Perlman returned my phone call.

117
0:06:23.36,000 --> 0:06:25,000
So we ended up having an almost two-hour conversation

118
0:06:25.861,000 --> 0:06:28,000
about how he got to where he got in his career.

119
0:06:30.24,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And I asked him, I said, "Why don't violinists have coaches?"

120
0:06:34.96,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And he said, "I don't know,

121
0:06:37.32,000 --> 0:06:38,000
but I always had a coach."

122
0:06:39.8,000 --> 0:06:41,000
"You always had a coach?"

123
0:06:41.84,000 --> 0:06:43,000
"Oh yeah, my wife, Toby."

124
0:06:45.36,000 --> 0:06:48,000
They had graduated together from Juilliard,

125
0:06:48.68,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and she had given up her job as a concert violinist

126
0:06:52.24,000 --> 0:06:53,000
to be his coach,

127
0:06:53.64,000 --> 0:06:54,000
sitting in the audience,

128
0:06:55.12,000 --> 0:06:57,000
observing him and giving him feedback.

129
0:06:57.52,000 --> 0:06:59,000
"Itzhak, in that middle section,

130
0:07:00.44,000 --> 0:07:02,000
you know you sounded a little bit mechanical.

131
0:07:03.08,000 --> 0:07:04,000
What can you differently next time?"

132
0:07:06.24,000 --> 0:07:09,000
It was crucial to everything he became, he said.

133
0:07:10.84,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Turns out there are numerous problems in making it on your own.

134
0:07:15.52,000 --> 0:07:17,000
You don't recognize the issues that are standing in your way

135
0:07:18.4,000 --> 0:07:19,000
or if you do,

136
0:07:19.64,000 --> 0:07:21,000
you don't necessarily know how to fix them.

137
0:07:21.8,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And the result is that somewhere along the way,

138
0:07:24.96,000 --> 0:07:25,000
you stop improving.

139
0:07:28.6,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And I thought about that,

140
0:07:30.12,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and I realized that was exactly what had happened to me as a surgeon.

141
0:07:34.56,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I'd entered practice in 2003,

142
0:07:37.04,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and for the first several years,

143
0:07:38.64,000 --> 0:07:42,000
it was just this steady, upward improvement in my learning curve.

144
0:07:43.04,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I watched my complication rates drop from one year to the next.

145
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And after about five years,

146
0:07:48.92,000 --> 0:07:49,000
they leveled out.

147
0:07:51.12,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And a few more years after that,

148
0:07:52.72,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I realized I wasn't getting any better anymore.

149
0:07:56.2,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And I thought: "Is this as good as I'm going to get?"

150
0:08:00.32,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So I thought a little more and I said ...

151
0:08:03.24,000 --> 0:08:04,000
"OK,

152
0:08:05.08,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I'll try a coach."

153
0:08:07.36,000 --> 0:08:11,000
So I asked a former professor of mine who had retired,

154
0:08:11.52,000 --> 0:08:12,000
his name is Bob Osteen,

155
0:08:13.36,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and he agreed to come to my operating room

156
0:08:16.24,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and observe me.

157
0:08:19.28,000 --> 0:08:2,000
The case --

158
0:08:20.52,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I remember that first case.

159
0:08:21.88,000 --> 0:08:22,000
It went beautifully.

160
0:08:23.36,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I didn't think there would be anything much he'd have to say

161
0:08:26.24,000 --> 0:08:27,000
when we were done.

162
0:08:27.6,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Instead, he had a whole page dense with notes.

163
0:08:31.32,000 --> 0:08:32,000
(Laughter)

164
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
"Just small things," he said.

165
0:08:34.76,000 --> 0:08:35,000
(Laughter)

166
0:08:35.88,000 --> 0:08:36,000
But it's the small things that matter.

167
0:08:39.2,000 --> 0:08:42,000
"Did you notice that the light had swung out of the wound

168
0:08:42.44,000 --> 0:08:43,000
during the case?

169
0:08:43.84,000 --> 0:08:44,000
You spent about half an hour

170
0:08:45.6,000 --> 0:08:48,000
just operating off the light from reflected surfaces."

171
0:08:49.88,000 --> 0:08:5,000
"Another thing I noticed," he said,

172
0:08:51.64,000 --> 0:08:54,000
"Your elbow goes up in the air every once in a while.

173
0:08:54.96,000 --> 0:08:56,000
That means you're not in full control.

174
0:08:57.64,000 --> 0:09:01,000
A surgeon's elbows should be down at their sides resting comfortably.

175
0:09:01.68,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So that means if you feel your elbow going in the air,

176
0:09:04.28,000 --> 0:09:07,000
you should get a different instrument, or just move your feet."

177
0:09:09.04,000 --> 0:09:11,000
It was a whole other level of awareness.

178
0:09:14.08,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And I had to think,

179
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
you know, there was something fundamentally profound about this.

180
0:09:21.92,000 --> 0:09:23,000
He was describing what great coaches do,

181
0:09:24.92,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and what they do is they are your external eyes and ears,

182
0:09:27.96,000 --> 0:09:29,000
providing a more accurate picture of your reality.

183
0:09:31.08,000 --> 0:09:32,000
They're recognizing the fundamentals.

184
0:09:33.64,000 --> 0:09:35,000
They're breaking your actions down

185
0:09:36,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and then helping you build them back up again.

186
0:09:38.84,000 --> 0:09:39,000
After two months of coaching,

187
0:09:40.84,000 --> 0:09:42,000
I felt myself getting better again.

188
0:09:43.64,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And after a year,

189
0:09:44.88,000 --> 0:09:46,000
I saw my complications drop down even further.

190
0:09:49.68,000 --> 0:09:5,000
It was painful.

191
0:09:51.44,000 --> 0:09:53,000
I didn't like being observed,

192
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and at times I didn't want to have to work on things.

193
0:09:57.08,000 --> 0:10:,000
I also felt there were periods where I would get worse before I got better.

194
0:10:01.28,000 --> 0:10:02,000
But it made me realize

195
0:10:02.56,000 --> 0:10:05,000
that the coaches were onto something profoundly important.

196
0:10:09.24,000 --> 0:10:1,000
In my other work,

197
0:10:10.96,000 --> 0:10:13,000
I lead a health systems innovation center called Ariadne Labs,

198
0:10:14.52,000 --> 0:10:17,000
where we work on problems in the delivery of health care,

199
0:10:18.48,000 --> 0:10:19,000
including global childbirth.

200
0:10:20.64,000 --> 0:10:21,000
As part of it,

201
0:10:21.88,000 --> 0:10:23,000
we had worked with the World Health Organization

202
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
to devise a safe childbirth checklist.

203
0:10:26.6,000 --> 0:10:27,000
It lays out the fundamentals.

204
0:10:28.56,000 --> 0:10:29,000
It breaks down the fundamentals --

205
0:10:30.24,000 --> 0:10:32,000
the critical actions a team needs to go through

206
0:10:33.08,000 --> 0:10:35,000
when a woman comes in in labor,

207
0:10:35.4,000 --> 0:10:36,000
when she's ready to push,

208
0:10:37.36,000 --> 0:10:38,000
when the baby is out,

209
0:10:39.04,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and then when the mom and baby are ready to go home.

210
0:10:42.44,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And we knew

211
0:10:43.68,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that just handing out a checklist wasn't going to change very much,

212
0:10:46.88,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and even just teaching it in the classroom wasn't necessarily going to be enough

213
0:10:51.12,000 --> 0:10:55,000
to get people to make the changes that you needed to bring it alive.

214
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And I thought on my experience and said,

215
0:10:57.88,000 --> 0:10:58,000
"What if we tried coaching?

216
0:11:00.28,000 --> 0:11:02,000
What if we tried coaching at a massive scale?"

217
0:11:04.92,000 --> 0:11:06,000
We found some incredible partners,

218
0:11:07.36,000 --> 0:11:09,000
including the government of India,

219
0:11:10.08,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and we ran a trial there in 120 birth centers.

220
0:11:13.96,000 --> 0:11:16,000
In Uttar Pradesh, in India's largest state.

221
0:11:17.96,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Half of the centers basically we just observed,

222
0:11:23,000 --> 0:11:25,000
but the other half got visits from coaches.

223
0:11:25.96,000 --> 0:11:28,000
We trained an army of doctors and nurses like this one

224
0:11:29.76,000 --> 0:11:33,000
who learned to observe the care and also the managers

225
0:11:34.12,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and then help them build on their strengths

226
0:11:36.44,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and address their weaknesses.

227
0:11:38.88,000 --> 0:11:41,000
One of the skills for example they had to work on with people --

228
0:11:41.96,000 --> 0:11:43,000
turned out to be fundamentally important --

229
0:11:44.04,000 --> 0:11:45,000
was communication.

230
0:11:45.28,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Getting the nurses to practice speaking up when the baby mask is broken

231
0:11:49.68,000 --> 0:11:5,000
or the gloves are not in stock

232
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
or someone's not washing their hands.

233
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And then getting others, including the managers,

234
0:11:55.28,000 --> 0:11:56,000
to practice listening.

235
0:11:57.88,000 --> 0:12:01,000
This small army of coaches ended up coaching 400 nurses

236
0:12:02.76,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and other birth attendants,

237
0:12:04.2,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and 100 physicians and managers.

238
0:12:07.92,000 --> 0:12:11,000
We tracked the results across 160,000 births.

239
0:12:13.28,000 --> 0:12:14,000
The results ...

240
0:12:15,000 --> 0:12:17,000
in the control group you had --

241
0:12:17.56,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and these are the ones who did not get coaching --

242
0:12:19.92,000 --> 0:12:22,000
they delivered on only one-third of 18 basic practices

243
0:12:23.8,000 --> 0:12:24,000
that we were measuring.

244
0:12:25.08,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And most important was over the course of the years of study,

245
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:3,000
we saw no improvement over time.

246
0:12:30.88,000 --> 0:12:32,000
The other folks got four months of coaching

247
0:12:33.28,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and then it tapered off over eight months,

248
0:12:35.64,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and we saw them increase

249
0:12:37.48,000 --> 0:12:4,000
to greater than two-thirds of the practices being delivered.

250
0:12:42.32,000 --> 0:12:43,000
It works.

251
0:12:43.88,000 --> 0:12:46,000
We could see the improvement in quality,

252
0:12:47.2,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and you could see it happen across a whole range of centers

253
0:12:50.04,000 --> 0:12:53,000
that suggested that coaching could be a whole line of way

254
0:12:53.28,000 --> 0:12:55,000
that we bring value to what we do.

255
0:12:56.48,000 --> 0:12:59,000
You can imagine the whole job category that could reach out in the world

256
0:13:00.28,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and that millions of people could fulfill.

257
0:13:04.24,000 --> 0:13:06,000
We were clearly at the beginning of it, though,

258
0:13:06.48,000 --> 0:13:08,000
because there was still a distance to go.

259
0:13:08.6,000 --> 0:13:1,000
You have to put all of the checklist together

260
0:13:10.84,000 --> 0:13:13,000
to achieve the substantial reductions in mortality.

261
0:13:14.24,000 --> 0:13:17,000
But we began seeing the first places that were getting there,

262
0:13:17.96,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and this center was one of them

263
0:13:19.92,000 --> 0:13:22,000
because coaching helped them learn to execute on the fundamentals.

264
0:13:24.6,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And you could see it here.

265
0:13:27.24,000 --> 0:13:29,000
This is a 23-year-old woman

266
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
who had come in by ambulance,

267
0:13:32.28,000 --> 0:13:34,000
in labor with her third child.

268
0:13:35.52,000 --> 0:13:4,000
She broke her water in the triage area,

269
0:13:41.32,000 --> 0:13:44,000
so they brought her directly to the labor and delivery room,

270
0:13:44.72,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and then they ran through their checks.

271
0:13:46.64,000 --> 0:13:47,000
I put the time stamp on here

272
0:13:48.36,000 --> 0:13:5,000
so you could see how quickly all of this happens

273
0:13:51.28,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and how much more complicated that makes things.

274
0:13:54.48,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Within four minutes,

275
0:13:55.88,000 --> 0:13:58,000
they had taken the blood pressure, measured her pulse

276
0:13:59.08,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and also measured the heart rate of the baby.

277
0:14:02.44,000 --> 0:14:05,000
That meant that the blood pressure cuff and the fetal Doppler monitor,

278
0:14:05.8,000 --> 0:14:07,000
they were all there, and the nurse knew how to use them.

279
0:14:08.52,000 --> 0:14:09,000
The team was skilled and coordinated.

280
0:14:11.24,000 --> 0:14:12,000
The mom was doing great,

281
0:14:12.52,000 --> 0:14:14,000
the baby's heart rate was 143, which is normal.

282
0:14:16.08,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Eight minutes later, the intensity of the contractions picked up,

283
0:14:2,000 --> 0:14:22,000
so the nurse washed her hands,

284
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
put on clean gloves,

285
0:14:23.8,000 --> 0:14:26,000
examined her and found that her cervix was fully dilated.

286
0:14:27.24,000 --> 0:14:28,000
The baby was ready to come.

287
0:14:29.8,000 --> 0:14:32,000
She then went straight over to do her next set of checks.

288
0:14:33.28,000 --> 0:14:35,000
All of the equipment, she worked her way through

289
0:14:35.56,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and made sure she had everything she needed at the bedside.

290
0:14:38.4,000 --> 0:14:4,000
The baby mask was there, the sterile towel,

291
0:14:40.48,000 --> 0:14:42,000
the sterile equipment that you needed.

292
0:14:42.88,000 --> 0:14:47,000
And then three minutes later, one push and that baby was out.

293
0:14:48.44,000 --> 0:14:5,000
(Applause)

294
0:14:52.96,000 --> 0:14:53,000
I was watching this delivery,

295
0:14:54.48,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and suddenly I realized that the mood in that room had changed.

296
0:15:00.24,000 --> 0:15:02,000
The nurse was looking at the community health worker

297
0:15:02.72,000 --> 0:15:03,000
who had come in with the woman

298
0:15:04.2,000 --> 0:15:06,000
because that baby did not seem to be alive.

299
0:15:08.2,000 --> 0:15:11,000
She was blue and floppy and not breathing.

300
0:15:12.76,000 --> 0:15:14,000
She would be one of that one-in-20.

301
0:15:16.84,000 --> 0:15:19,000
But the nurse kept going with her checkpoints.

302
0:15:19.88,000 --> 0:15:21,000
She dried that baby with a clean towel.

303
0:15:22.8,000 --> 0:15:24,000
And after a minute, when that didn't stimulate that baby,

304
0:15:25.68,000 --> 0:15:28,000
she ran to get the baby mask

305
0:15:28.88,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and the other one went to get the suction.

306
0:15:31.48,000 --> 0:15:34,000
She didn't have a mechanical suction because you could count on electricity,

307
0:15:35.12,000 --> 0:15:36,000
so she used a mouth suction,

308
0:15:36.52,000 --> 0:15:37,000
and within 20 seconds,

309
0:15:37.8,000 --> 0:15:39,000
she was clearing out that little girl's airways.

310
0:15:40.76,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And she got back a green, thick liquid,

311
0:15:42.68,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and within a minute of being able to do that

312
0:15:44.8,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and suctioning out over and over,

313
0:15:46.44,000 --> 0:15:47,000
that baby started to breathe.

314
0:15:47.88,000 --> 0:15:51,000
(Applause)

315
0:15:53.64,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Another minute and that baby was crying.

316
0:15:57.36,000 --> 0:15:59,000
And five minutes after that,

317
0:15:59.44,000 --> 0:16:02,000
she was pink and warming on her mother's chest,

318
0:16:02.72,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and that mother reached out to grab that nurse's hand,

319
0:16:05.84,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and they could all breathe.

320
0:16:09.32,000 --> 0:16:12,000
I saw a team transformed because of coaching.

321
0:16:13.56,000 --> 0:16:16,000
And I saw at least one life saved because of it.

322
0:16:17.92,000 --> 0:16:19,000
We followed up with that mother a few months later.

323
0:16:20.76,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Mom and baby were doing great.

The baby's name is Anshika.

325
0:16:27.24,000 --> 0:16:28,000
It means "beautiful."

326
0:16:3,000 --> 0:16:31,000
And she is what's possible

327
0:16:31.84,000 --> 0:16:32,000
when we really understand

328
0:16:33.56,000 --> 0:16:35,000
how people get better at what they do.

329
0:16:36.72,000 --> 0:16:37,000
Thank you.

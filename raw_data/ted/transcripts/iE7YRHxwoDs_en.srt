2
0:00:18.906,000 --> 0:00:2,000
So, this is my grandfather,

3
0:00:21.872,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Salman Schocken,

4
0:00:23.373,000 --> 0:00:27,000
who was born into a poor and uneducated family

5
0:00:27.81,000 --> 0:00:3,000
with six children to feed,

6
0:00:31.247,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and when he was 14 years old, he was forced to

7
0:00:34.943,000 --> 0:00:37,000
drop out of school in order to help put bread on the table.

8
0:00:38.903,000 --> 0:00:41,000
He never went back to school.

9
0:00:42.323,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Instead, he went on to build a glittering empire

10
0:00:46.47,000 --> 0:00:48,000
of department stores.

11
0:00:48.578,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Salman was the consummate perfectionist,

12
0:00:51.831,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and every one of his stores was a jewel

13
0:00:54.395,000 --> 0:00:55,000
of Bauhaus architecture.

14
0:00:56.324,000 --> 0:00:59,000
He was also the ultimate self-learner,

15
0:00:59.514,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and like everything else, he did it in grand style.

16
0:01:02.417,000 --> 0:01:04,000
He surrounded himself with an entourage

17
0:01:05.105,000 --> 0:01:08,000
of young, unknown scholars like Martin Buber

18
0:01:08.492,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and Shai Agnon and Franz Kafka,

19
0:01:11.631,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and he paid each one of them a monthly salary

20
0:01:14.556,000 --> 0:01:17,000
so that they could write in peace.

21
0:01:17.607,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And yet, in the late '30s, Salman saw what's coming.

22
0:01:22.544,000 --> 0:01:25,000
He fled Germany, together with his family,

23
0:01:25.858,000 --> 0:01:27,000
leaving everything else behind.

24
0:01:27.947,000 --> 0:01:3,000
His department stores confiscated,

25
0:01:31.157,000 --> 0:01:34,000
he spent the rest of his life in a relentless pursuit

26
0:01:34.246,000 --> 0:01:36,000
of art and culture.

27
0:01:36.715,000 --> 0:01:37,000
This high school dropout

28
0:01:38.654,000 --> 0:01:4,000
died at the age of 82,

29
0:01:40.934,000 --> 0:01:44,000
a formidable intellectual, cofounder and first CEO

30
0:01:45.063,000 --> 0:01:47,000
of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,

31
0:01:47.208,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and founder of Schocken Books,

32
0:01:48.972,000 --> 0:01:51,000
an acclaimed imprint that was later acquired

33
0:01:52.343,000 --> 0:01:53,000
by Random House.

34
0:01:54.013,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Such is the power of self-study.

35
0:01:57.989,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And these are my parents.

36
0:02:00.505,000 --> 0:02:04,000
They too did not enjoy the privilege of college education.

37
0:02:04.552,000 --> 0:02:07,000
They were too busy building a family and a country.

38
0:02:08.523,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And yet, just like Salman, they were lifelong,

39
0:02:12.551,000 --> 0:02:15,000
tenacious self-learners, and our home was stacked

40
0:02:16.309,000 --> 0:02:2,000
with thousands of books, records and artwork.

41
0:02:20.472,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I remember quite vividly my father telling me

42
0:02:22.868,000 --> 0:02:26,000
that when everyone in the neighborhood will have a TV set,

43
0:02:27.7,000 --> 0:02:31,000
then we'll buy a normal F.M. radio. (Laughter)

44
0:02:32.318,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And that's me,

45
0:02:35.347,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I was going to say holding my first abacus,

46
0:02:37.071,000 --> 0:02:4,000
but actually holding what my father would consider

47
0:02:40.082,000 --> 0:02:42,000
an ample substitute to an iPad. (Laughter)

48
0:02:43.034,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So one thing that I took from home is this notion

49
0:02:46.696,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that educators don't necessarily have to teach.

50
0:02:49.537,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Instead, they can provide an environment and resources

51
0:02:52.766,000 --> 0:02:57,000
that tease out your natural ability to learn on your own.

52
0:02:57.914,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Self-study, self-exploration, self-empowerment:

53
0:03:02.008,000 --> 0:03:05,000
these are the virtues of a great education.

54
0:03:05.328,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So I'd like to share with you a story about a self-study,

55
0:03:09.523,000 --> 0:03:11,000
self-empowering computer science course

56
0:03:12.077,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that I built, together with my brilliant colleague Noam Nisan.

57
0:03:16.263,000 --> 0:03:18,000
As you can see from the pictures, both Noam and I

58
0:03:19.02,000 --> 0:03:22,000
had an early fascination with first principles,

59
0:03:22.438,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and over the years, as our knowledge of

60
0:03:23.96,000 --> 0:03:26,000
science and technology became more sophisticated,

61
0:03:27.535,000 --> 0:03:3,000
this early awe with the basics

62
0:03:30.731,000 --> 0:03:32,000
has only intensified.

63
0:03:32.831,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So it's not surprising that, about 12 years ago, when

64
0:03:36.53,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Noam and I were already computer science professors,

65
0:03:40.012,000 --> 0:03:43,000
we were equally frustrated by the same phenomenon.

66
0:03:43.764,000 --> 0:03:45,000
As computers became increasingly more complex,

67
0:03:46.582,000 --> 0:03:49,000
our students were losing the forest for the trees,

68
0:03:49.786,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and indeed, it is impossible to connect

69
0:03:52.873,000 --> 0:03:54,000
with the soul of the machine if you interact

70
0:03:55.515,000 --> 0:03:58,000
with a black box P.C. or a Mac which is shrouded

71
0:03:58.924,000 --> 0:04:01,000
by numerous layers of closed, proprietary software.

72
0:04:02.3,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So Noam and I had this insight that if we want our students

73
0:04:05.99,000 --> 0:04:07,000
to understand how computers work,

74
0:04:08.009,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and understand it in the marrow of their bones,

75
0:04:11.097,000 --> 0:04:12,000
then perhaps the best way to go about it

76
0:04:12.658,000 --> 0:04:16,000
is to have them build a complete, working,

77
0:04:17.252,000 --> 0:04:2,000
general-purpose, useful computer, hardware and software,

78
0:04:20.964,000 --> 0:04:23,000
from the ground up, from first principles.

79
0:04:24.494,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Now, we had to start somewhere, and so Noam and I

80
0:04:28.702,000 --> 0:04:31,000
decided to base our cathedral, so to speak,

81
0:04:32.192,000 --> 0:04:35,000
on the simplest possible building block,

82
0:04:35.331,000 --> 0:04:37,000
which is something called NAND.

83
0:04:38.132,000 --> 0:04:41,000
It is nothing more than a trivial logic gate

84
0:04:42.07,000 --> 0:04:45,000
with four input-output states.

85
0:04:45.108,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So we now start this journey by telling our students

86
0:04:47.774,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that God gave us NAND — (Laughter) —

87
0:04:49.842,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and told us to build a computer, and when we asked how,

88
0:04:53.827,000 --> 0:04:56,000
God said, "One step at a time."

89
0:04:57.011,000 --> 0:05:,000
And then, following this advice, we start

90
0:05:00.104,000 --> 0:05:02,000
with this lowly, humble NAND gate,

91
0:05:03.063,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and we walk our students through an elaborate sequence

92
0:05:05.003,000 --> 0:05:08,000
of projects in which they gradually build a chip set,

93
0:05:08.74,000 --> 0:05:12,000
a hardware platform, an assembler, a virtual machine,

94
0:05:12.852,000 --> 0:05:15,000
a basic operating system and a compiler

95
0:05:16.429,000 --> 0:05:22,000
for a simple, Java-like language that we call "JACK."

96
0:05:22.618,000 --> 0:05:24,000
The students celebrate the end of this tour de force

97
0:05:25.166,000 --> 0:05:27,000
by using JACK to write all sorts of cool games

98
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:3,000
like Pong, Snake and Tetris.

99
0:05:30.992,000 --> 0:05:33,000
You can imagine the tremendous joy of playing

100
0:05:34.607,000 --> 0:05:37,000
with a Tetris game that you wrote in JACK

101
0:05:37.631,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and then compiled into machine language in a compiler

102
0:05:40.421,000 --> 0:05:42,000
that you wrote also, and then seeing the result

103
0:05:42.829,000 --> 0:05:44,000
running on a machine that you built starting

104
0:05:45.712,000 --> 0:05:48,000
with nothing more than a few thousand NAND gates.

105
0:05:48.996,000 --> 0:05:51,000
It's a tremendous personal triumph of going

106
0:05:52.186,000 --> 0:05:56,000
from first principles all the way to a fantastically complex

107
0:05:56.911,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and useful system.

108
0:05:59.262,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Noam and I worked five years to facilitate

109
0:06:03.659,000 --> 0:06:06,000
this ascent and to create the tools and infrastructure

110
0:06:06.867,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that will enable students to build it in one semester.

111
0:06:10.04,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And this is the great team that helped us make it happen.

112
0:06:14.079,000 --> 0:06:18,000
The trick was to decompose the computer's construction

113
0:06:18.326,000 --> 0:06:2,000
into numerous stand-alone modules,

114
0:06:21.28,000 --> 0:06:24,000
each of which could be individually specified,

115
0:06:25.18,000 --> 0:06:3,000
built and unit-tested in isolation from the rest of the project.

116
0:06:30.415,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And from day one, Noam and I decided to put

117
0:06:33.404,000 --> 0:06:36,000
all these building blocks freely available in open source

118
0:06:36.94,000 --> 0:06:37,000
on the Web.

119
0:06:38.42,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So chip specifications, APIs, project descriptions,

120
0:06:42.891,000 --> 0:06:45,000
software tools, hardware simulators, CPU emulators,

121
0:06:46.795,000 --> 0:06:49,000
stacks of hundreds of slides, lectures --

122
0:06:50.497,000 --> 0:06:52,000
we laid out everything on the Web

123
0:06:52.724,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and invited the world to come over,

124
0:06:55.751,000 --> 0:06:56,000
take whatever they need,

125
0:06:57.287,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and do whatever they want with it.

126
0:06:59.677,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And then something fascinating happened.

127
0:07:03.576,000 --> 0:07:04,000
The world came.

128
0:07:05.159,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And in short order, thousands of people

129
0:07:08.317,000 --> 0:07:09,000
were building our machine.

130
0:07:09.861,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And NAND2Tetris became one of the first

131
0:07:13.785,000 --> 0:07:16,000
massive, open, online courses,

132
0:07:17.015,000 --> 0:07:19,000
although seven years ago we had no idea that what

133
0:07:19.759,000 --> 0:07:21,000
we were doing is called MOOCs.

134
0:07:21.92,000 --> 0:07:24,000
We just observed how self-organized courses

135
0:07:25.778,000 --> 0:07:28,000
were kind of spontaneously spawning

136
0:07:28.86,000 --> 0:07:29,000
out of our materials.

137
0:07:30.243,000 --> 0:07:33,000
For example, Pramode C.E.,

138
0:07:33.334,000 --> 0:07:34,000
an engineer from Kerala, India,

139
0:07:35.243,000 --> 0:07:36,000
has organized groups of self-learners

140
0:07:37.052,000 --> 0:07:4,000
who build our computer under his good guidance.

141
0:07:40.096,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And Parag Shah, another engineer, from Mumbai,

142
0:07:43.118,000 --> 0:07:45,000
has unbundled our projects into smaller,

143
0:07:45.963,000 --> 0:07:47,000
more manageable bites that he now serves

144
0:07:47.985,000 --> 0:07:5,000
in his pioneering do-it-yourself computer science program.

145
0:07:51.787,000 --> 0:07:54,000
The people who are attracted to these courses

146
0:07:55.198,000 --> 0:07:57,000
typically have a hacker mentality.

147
0:07:57.618,000 --> 0:07:59,000
They want to figure out how things work,

148
0:07:59.723,000 --> 0:08:,000
and they want to do it in groups,

149
0:08:01.483,000 --> 0:08:03,000
like this hackers club in Washington, D.C.,

150
0:08:04.294,000 --> 0:08:07,000
that uses our materials to offer community courses.

151
0:08:07.959,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And because these materials are widely available

152
0:08:10.905,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and open-source, different people take them

153
0:08:13.599,000 --> 0:08:15,000
to very different and unpredictable directions.

154
0:08:16.542,000 --> 0:08:18,000
For example, Yu Fangmin, from Guangzhou,

155
0:08:19.455,000 --> 0:08:21,000
has used FPGA technology

156
0:08:22.301,000 --> 0:08:25,000
to build our computer and show others how to do the same

157
0:08:26.026,000 --> 0:08:29,000
using a video clip, and Ben Craddock developed

158
0:08:29.389,000 --> 0:08:32,000
a very nice computer game that unfolds

159
0:08:32.99,000 --> 0:08:36,000
inside our CPU architecture, which is quite a complex

160
0:08:37.959,000 --> 0:08:39,000
3D maze that Ben developed

161
0:08:40.444,000 --> 0:08:43,000
using the Minecraft 3D simulator engine.

162
0:08:44.352,000 --> 0:08:47,000
The Minecraft community went bananas over this project,

163
0:08:47.37,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and Ben became an instant media celebrity.

164
0:08:50.754,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And indeed, for quite a few people,

165
0:08:53.656,000 --> 0:08:57,000
taking this NAND2Tetris pilgrimage, if you will,

166
0:08:57.733,000 --> 0:08:59,000
has turned into a life-changing experience.

167
0:09:00.445,000 --> 0:09:03,000
For example, take Dan Rounds, who is a music

168
0:09:03.634,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and math major from East Lansing, Michigan.

169
0:09:06.403,000 --> 0:09:09,000
A few weeks ago, Dan posted a victorious post

170
0:09:09.847,000 --> 0:09:11,000
on our website, and I'd like to read it to you.

171
0:09:12.467,000 --> 0:09:15,000
So here's what Dan said.

172
0:09:15.925,000 --> 0:09:17,000
"I did the coursework because understanding computers

173
0:09:18.737,000 --> 0:09:21,000
is important to me, just like literacy and numeracy,

174
0:09:22.083,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and I made it through. I never worked harder on anything,

175
0:09:25.1,000 --> 0:09:27,000
never been challenged to this degree.

176
0:09:27.809,000 --> 0:09:29,000
But given what I now feel capable of doing,

177
0:09:30.196,000 --> 0:09:32,000
I would certainly do it again.

178
0:09:32.354,000 --> 0:09:34,000
To anyone considering NAND2Tetris,

179
0:09:34.604,000 --> 0:09:37,000
it's a tough journey, but you'll be profoundly changed."

180
0:09:38.35,000 --> 0:09:42,000
So Dan demonstrates the many self-learners

181
0:09:43.25,000 --> 0:09:47,000
who take this course off the Web, on their own traction,

182
0:09:47.896,000 --> 0:09:51,000
on their own initiative, and it's quite amazing because

183
0:09:52.485,000 --> 0:09:56,000
these people cannot care less about

184
0:09:57.072,000 --> 0:09:58,000
grades.

185
0:09:58.314,000 --> 0:10:01,000
They are doing it because of one motivation only.

186
0:10:02.219,000 --> 0:10:05,000
They have a tremendous passion to learn.

187
0:10:05.705,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And with that in mind,

188
0:10:07.629,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I'd like to say a few words about traditional college grading.

189
0:10:12.233,000 --> 0:10:14,000
I'm sick of it.

190
0:10:14.593,000 --> 0:10:15,000
We are obsessed with grades

191
0:10:16.026,000 --> 0:10:17,000
because we are obsessed with data,

192
0:10:17.892,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and yet grading takes away all the fun from failing,

193
0:10:22.479,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and a huge part of education

194
0:10:24.955,000 --> 0:10:25,000
is about failing.

195
0:10:26.546,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Courage, according to Churchill,

196
0:10:29.021,000 --> 0:10:31,000
is the ability to go from one defeat to another

197
0:10:31.967,000 --> 0:10:33,000
without losing enthusiasm. (Laughter)

198
0:10:34.581,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And [Joyce] said that mistakes

199
0:10:38.411,000 --> 0:10:39,000
are the portals of discovery.

200
0:10:39.88,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And yet we don't tolerate mistakes,

201
0:10:43.226,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and we worship grades.

202
0:10:44.535,000 --> 0:10:47,000
So we collect your B pluses and your A minuses

203
0:10:48.323,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and we aggregate them into a number like 3.4,

204
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
which is stamped on your forehead

205
0:10:53.071,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and sums up who you are.

206
0:10:55.514,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Well, in my opinion, we went too far with this nonsense,

207
0:10:58.797,000 --> 0:11:,000
and grading became degrading.

208
0:11:01.478,000 --> 0:11:05,000
So with that, I'd like to say a few words about upgrading,

209
0:11:06.379,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and share with you a glimpse from my current project,

210
0:11:10.804,000 --> 0:11:12,000
which is different from the previous one,

211
0:11:12.834,000 --> 0:11:14,000
but it shares exactly the same characteristics

212
0:11:14.848,000 --> 0:11:17,000
of self-learning, learning by doing,

213
0:11:18.675,000 --> 0:11:2,000
self-exploration and community-building,

214
0:11:21.45,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and this project deals with K-12 math education,

215
0:11:27.31,000 --> 0:11:28,000
beginning with early age math,

216
0:11:29.214,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and we do it on tablets because we believe that

217
0:11:33.707,000 --> 0:11:37,000
math, like anything else, should be taught hands on.

218
0:11:38.112,000 --> 0:11:41,000
So here's what we do. Basically, we developed

219
0:11:41.267,000 --> 0:11:44,000
numerous mobile apps, every one of them explaining

220
0:11:45.025,000 --> 0:11:46,000
a particular concept in math.

221
0:11:46.522,000 --> 0:11:49,000
So for example, let's take area.

222
0:11:49.963,000 --> 0:11:51,000
When you deal with a concept like area --

223
0:11:52.435,000 --> 0:11:57,000
well, we also provide a set of tools that the child

224
0:11:57.679,000 --> 0:11:59,000
is invited to experiment with in order to learn.

225
0:12:00.31,000 --> 0:12:03,000
So if area is what interests us, then one thing

226
0:12:04.263,000 --> 0:12:08,000
which is natural to do is to tile the area

227
0:12:08.401,000 --> 0:12:11,000
of this particular shape and simply count

228
0:12:12.051,000 --> 0:12:15,000
how many tiles it takes to cover it completely.

229
0:12:15.914,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And this little exercise here gives you a first

230
0:12:18.396,000 --> 0:12:21,000
good insight of the notion of area.

231
0:12:21.825,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Moving along, what about the area of this figure?

232
0:12:24.615,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Well, if you try to tile it, it doesn't work too well, does it.

233
0:12:29.272,000 --> 0:12:31,000
So instead, you can experiment

234
0:12:31.576,000 --> 0:12:33,000
with these different tools here by some process

235
0:12:34.256,000 --> 0:12:36,000
of guided trial and error,

236
0:12:36.295,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and at some point you will discover that one thing

237
0:12:39.133,000 --> 0:12:42,000
that you can do among several legitimate transformations

238
0:12:42.221,000 --> 0:12:44,000
is the following one. You can cut the figure,

239
0:12:45.052,000 --> 0:12:48,000
you can rearrange the parts, you can glue them

240
0:12:48.668,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and then proceed to tile just like we did before.

241
0:12:51.785,000 --> 0:12:56,000
(Applause)

242
0:12:57.06,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Now this particular transformation

243
0:12:59.783,000 --> 0:13:02,000
did not change the area of the original figure,

244
0:13:03.767,000 --> 0:13:05,000
so a six-year-old who plays with this

245
0:13:05.954,000 --> 0:13:07,000
has just discovered a clever algorithm

246
0:13:08.838,000 --> 0:13:12,000
to compute the area of any given parallelogram.

247
0:13:12.878,000 --> 0:13:13,000
We don't replace teachers, by the way.

248
0:13:14.734,000 --> 0:13:17,000
We believe that teachers should be empowered, not replaced.

249
0:13:17.863,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Moving along, what about the area of a triangle?

250
0:13:21.158,000 --> 0:13:23,000
So after some guided trial and error,

251
0:13:23.953,000 --> 0:13:26,000
the child will discover, with or without help,

252
0:13:27.888,000 --> 0:13:3,000
that he or she can duplicate the original figure

253
0:13:31.746,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and then take the result, transpose it,

254
0:13:35.154,000 --> 0:13:38,000
glue it to the original and then proceed [with] what we did before:

255
0:13:38.902,000 --> 0:13:45,000
cut, rearrange, paste — oops— paste and glue,

256
0:13:46.63,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and tile.

257
0:13:48.226,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Now this transformation has doubled the area

258
0:13:52.053,000 --> 0:13:55,000
of the original figure, and therefore we have just learned

259
0:13:55.903,000 --> 0:13:58,000
that the area of the triangle equals the area of this rectangle

260
0:13:59.669,000 --> 0:14:01,000
divided by two.

261
0:14:02.123,000 --> 0:14:05,000
But we discovered it by self-exploration.

262
0:14:05.571,000 --> 0:14:11,000
So, in addition to learning some useful geometry,

263
0:14:11.651,000 --> 0:14:15,000
the child has been exposed to some pretty sophisticated

264
0:14:16.038,000 --> 0:14:19,000
science strategies, like reduction,

265
0:14:19.065,000 --> 0:14:21,000
which is the art of

266
0:14:21.979,000 --> 0:14:24,000
transforming a complex problem into a simple one,

267
0:14:25.565,000 --> 0:14:27,000
or generalization, which is at the heart

268
0:14:27.934,000 --> 0:14:29,000
of any scientific discipline,

269
0:14:30.777,000 --> 0:14:32,000
or the fact that some properties are invariant

270
0:14:33.367,000 --> 0:14:36,000
under some transformations.

271
0:14:36.391,000 --> 0:14:39,000
And all this is something that a very young child

272
0:14:39.676,000 --> 0:14:43,000
can pick up using such mobile apps.

273
0:14:43.985,000 --> 0:14:46,000
So presently, we are doing the following:

274
0:14:47.079,000 --> 0:14:51,000
First of all, we are decomposing the K-12 math curriculum

275
0:14:51.388,000 --> 0:14:53,000
into numerous such apps.

276
0:14:54.279,000 --> 0:14:56,000
And because we cannot do it on our own,

277
0:14:56.856,000 --> 0:14:59,000
we've developed a very fancy authoring tool

278
0:14:59.95,000 --> 0:15:02,000
that any author, any parent or actually anyone

279
0:15:03.225,000 --> 0:15:05,000
who has an interest in math education,

280
0:15:05.578,000 --> 0:15:08,000
can use this authoring tool to develop similar apps

281
0:15:08.85,000 --> 0:15:11,000
on tablets without programming.

282
0:15:12.255,000 --> 0:15:15,000
And finally, we are putting together an adaptive ecosystem

283
0:15:15.475,000 --> 0:15:17,000
that will match different learners

284
0:15:18.303,000 --> 0:15:23,000
with different apps according to their evolving learning style.

285
0:15:23.68,000 --> 0:15:25,000
The driving force behind this project

286
0:15:26.201,000 --> 0:15:28,000
is my colleague Shmulik London,

287
0:15:29.148,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and, you see, just like

288
0:15:31.792,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Salman did about 90 years ago,

289
0:15:35.865,000 --> 0:15:38,000
the trick is to surround yourself with brilliant people,

290
0:15:39.836,000 --> 0:15:41,000
because at the end,

291
0:15:42.592,000 --> 0:15:43,000
it's all about people.

292
0:15:44.495,000 --> 0:15:47,000
And a few years ago, I was walking in Tel Aviv

293
0:15:47.914,000 --> 0:15:49,000
and I saw this graffiti on a wall,

294
0:15:50.744,000 --> 0:15:51,000
and I found it so compelling

295
0:15:52.535,000 --> 0:15:54,000
that by now I preach it to my students,

296
0:15:54.678,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and I'd like to try to preach it to you.

297
0:15:56.944,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Now, I don't know how many people here are familiar

298
0:15:58.684,000 --> 0:15:59,000
with the term "mensch."

299
0:16:00.512,000 --> 0:16:02,000
It basically means to be human

300
0:16:03.12,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and to do the right thing.

301
0:16:05.055,000 --> 0:16:07,000
And with that, what this graffiti says is,

302
0:16:07.484,000 --> 0:16:09,000
"High-tech schmigh-tech.

303
0:16:09.57,000 --> 0:16:11,000
The most important thing is to be a mensch." (Laughter)

304
0:16:12.133,000 --> 0:16:15,000
Thank you. (Applause)

305
0:16:15.528,000 --> 0:16:19,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.166,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I've been living in rural East Africa for about 10 years,

2
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and I want to share a field perspective with you on global poverty.

3
0:00:19.934,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I believe that the greatest failure of the human race

4
0:00:22.532,000 --> 0:00:25,000
is the fact that we've left more than one billion of our members behind.

5
0:00:26.335,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Hungry, extreme poverty:

6
0:00:28.701,000 --> 0:00:31,000
these often seem like gigantic, insurmountable problems,

7
0:00:32.013,000 --> 0:00:33,000
too big to solve.

8
0:00:34.006,000 --> 0:00:35,000
But as a field practitioner,

9
0:00:35.739,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I believe these are actually very solvable problems

10
0:00:38.567,000 --> 0:00:4,000
if we just take the right strategies.

11
0:00:42.39,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Archimedes was an ancient Greek thinker,

12
0:00:44.529,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and he taught us that if we lean on the right levers,

13
0:00:47.037,000 --> 0:00:48,000
we can move the world.

14
0:00:48.959,000 --> 0:00:51,000
In the fight against extreme poverty, I believe there are three powerful levers

15
0:00:52.699,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that we can lean on.

16
0:00:54.096,000 --> 0:00:57,000
This talk is all about those levers, and why they make poverty

17
0:00:57.122,000 --> 0:00:59,000
a winnable fight in our lifetimes.

18
0:00:59.994,000 --> 0:01:,000
What is extreme poverty?

19
0:01:02.287,000 --> 0:01:03,000
When I first moved to rural East Africa,

20
0:01:04.256,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I stayed overnight with a farm family.

21
0:01:06.629,000 --> 0:01:08,000
They were wonderful people.

22
0:01:08.753,000 --> 0:01:1,000
They invited me into their home. We sang songs together

23
0:01:11.649,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and ate a simple dinner.

24
0:01:12.824,000 --> 0:01:14,000
They gave me a blanket to sleep on the floor.

25
0:01:15.359,000 --> 0:01:17,000
In the morning, however, there was nothing to eat.

26
0:01:18.265,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And then at lunchtime, I watched with an increasingly sick feeling

27
0:01:22.041,000 --> 0:01:26,000
as the eldest girl in the family cooked porridge as a substitute for lunch.

28
0:01:26.703,000 --> 0:01:3,000
For that meal, every child drank one cup to survive.

29
0:01:31.575,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And I cannot tell you how ashamed I felt

30
0:01:33.589,000 --> 0:01:34,000
when they handed one of those cups to me,

31
0:01:35.576,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and I knew I had to accept their hospitality.

32
0:01:38.781,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Children need food not only to survive but also to grow physically and mentally.

33
0:01:43.265,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Every day they fail to eat, they lose a little bit of their future.

34
0:01:47.114,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Amongst the extreme poor, one in three children

35
0:01:50.02,000 --> 0:01:53,000
are permanently stunted from a lifetime of not eating enough.

36
0:01:54.326,000 --> 0:01:56,000
When that's combined with poor access to health care,

37
0:01:56.862,000 --> 0:02:,000
one in 10 extremely poor children die before they reach age five.

38
0:02:01.819,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And only one quarter of children complete high school

39
0:02:04.38,000 --> 0:02:05,000
because they lack school fees.

40
0:02:05.908,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Hunger and extreme poverty curb human potential in every possible way.

41
0:02:12.771,000 --> 0:02:16,000
We see ourselves as a thinking, feeling and moral human race,

42
0:02:17.085,000 --> 0:02:2,000
but until we solve these problems for all of our members,

43
0:02:20.144,000 --> 0:02:21,000
we fail that standard,

44
0:02:22.332,000 --> 0:02:24,000
because every person on this planet matters.

45
0:02:24.698,000 --> 0:02:25,000
This child matters.

46
0:02:27.125,000 --> 0:02:28,000
These children matter.

47
0:02:29.638,000 --> 0:02:3,000
This girl matters.

48
0:02:32.209,000 --> 0:02:33,000
You know, we see things like this,

49
0:02:33.922,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and we're upset by them,

50
0:02:35.523,000 --> 0:02:36,000
but they seem like such big problems.

51
0:02:37.349,000 --> 0:02:39,000
We don't know how to take effective action.

52
0:02:40.893,000 --> 0:02:41,000
But remember our friend Archimedes.

53
0:02:43.572,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Global poverty has powerful levers.

54
0:02:45.924,000 --> 0:02:46,000
It's a problem like any other.

55
0:02:48.023,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I live and work in the field, and as a practitioner,

56
0:02:50.493,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I believe these are very solvable problems.

57
0:02:53.32,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So for the next 10 minutes,

58
0:02:54.825,000 --> 0:02:56,000
let's not be sad about the state of the world.

59
0:02:57.003,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Let's engage our brains.

60
0:02:58.858,000 --> 0:03:,000
Let's engage our collective passion for problem-solving

61
0:03:01.627,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and figure out what those levers are.

62
0:03:04.416,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Lever number one: most of the world's poor are farmers.

63
0:03:08.157,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Think about how extraordinary this is.

64
0:03:10.244,000 --> 0:03:12,000
If this picture represents the world's poor,

65
0:03:12.729,000 --> 0:03:15,000
then more than half engage in farming as a major source of income.

66
0:03:16.368,000 --> 0:03:17,000
This gets me really excited.

67
0:03:18.319,000 --> 0:03:2,000
All of these people, one profession.

68
0:03:21.247,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Think how powerful this is.

69
0:03:22.727,000 --> 0:03:25,000
When farmers become more productive, then more than half the world's poor

70
0:03:26.269,000 --> 0:03:28,000
earn more money and climb out of poverty.

71
0:03:28.697,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And it gets better.

72
0:03:29.941,000 --> 0:03:31,000
The product of farming is, of course, food.

73
0:03:32.22,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So when farmers become more productive, they earn more food,

74
0:03:35.849,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and they don't just help themselves,

75
0:03:37.594,000 --> 0:03:4,000
but they help to feed healthy communities and thriving economies.

76
0:03:41.228,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And when farmers become more productive, they reduce environmental pressure.

77
0:03:45.443,000 --> 0:03:47,000
We only have two ways we can feed the world:

78
0:03:47.749,000 --> 0:03:5,000
we can either make our existing farmland a lot more productive,

79
0:03:51.096,000 --> 0:03:54,000
or we can clear cut forest and savannah to make more farmland,

80
0:03:54.4,000 --> 0:03:56,000
which would be environmentally disastrous.

81
0:03:57.688,000 --> 0:04:,000
Farmers are basically a really important leverage point.

82
0:04:01.496,000 --> 0:04:02,000
When farmers become more productive,

83
0:04:03.453,000 --> 0:04:05,000
they earn more income, they climb out of poverty,

84
0:04:06.088,000 --> 0:04:1,000
they feed their communities and they reduce environmental land pressure.

85
0:04:10.187,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Farmers stand at the center of the world.

86
0:04:14.306,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And not a farmer like this one,

87
0:04:16.03,000 --> 0:04:17,000
but rather this lady.

88
0:04:18.055,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Most of the farmers I know are actually women.

89
0:04:20.699,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Look at the strength and the will radiating from this woman.

90
0:04:23.995,000 --> 0:04:25,000
She is physically strong, mentally tough,

91
0:04:26.231,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and she will do whatever it takes to earn a better life for her children.

92
0:04:29.686,000 --> 0:04:32,000
If we're going to put the future of humanity in one person's hands,

93
0:04:32.854,000 --> 0:04:33,000
then I'm really glad it's her.

94
0:04:34.691,000 --> 0:04:39,000
(Applause)

95
0:04:40.125,000 --> 0:04:41,000
There's just one problem:

96
0:04:41.405,000 --> 0:04:45,000
many smallholder farmers lack access to basic tools and knowledge.

97
0:04:46.748,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Currently, they take a little bit of saved food grain from the prior year,

98
0:04:50.46,000 --> 0:04:53,000
they plant it in the ground and they till it with a manual hand hoe.

99
0:04:53.864,000 --> 0:04:55,000
These are tools and techniques that date to the Bronze Age,

100
0:04:56.653,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and it's why many farmers are still very poor.

101
0:05:00.755,000 --> 0:05:01,000
But good news, again.

102
0:05:02.161,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Lever number two:

103
0:05:03.336,000 --> 0:05:07,000
humanity actually solved the problem of agricultural poverty a century ago.

104
0:05:08.449,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Let me walk you through the three most basic factors in farming.

105
0:05:11.944,000 --> 0:05:15,000
First, hybrid seed is created when you cross two seeds together.

106
0:05:16.365,000 --> 0:05:18,000
If you naturally pollinate a high-yielding variety

107
0:05:19.193,000 --> 0:05:21,000
together with a drought-resistant variety,

108
0:05:21.528,000 --> 0:05:24,000
you get a hybrid that inherits positive traits from both of its parents.

109
0:05:25.39,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Next, conventional fertilizer, if used responsibly,

110
0:05:29.111,000 --> 0:05:3,000
is environmentally sustainable.

111
0:05:31.433,000 --> 0:05:33,000
If you micro-dose just a pinch of fertilizer

112
0:05:34.451,000 --> 0:05:36,000
to a plant that's taller than I am,

113
0:05:36.559,000 --> 0:05:38,000
you unlock enormous yield gain.

114
0:05:39.118,000 --> 0:05:4,000
These are known as farm inputs.

115
0:05:41.241,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Farm inputs need to be combined with good practice.

116
0:05:43.865,000 --> 0:05:47,000
When you space your seeds and plant with massive amounts of compost,

117
0:05:47.983,000 --> 0:05:49,000
farmers multiply their harvests.

118
0:05:50.946,000 --> 0:05:52,000
These proven tools and practices have more than tripled

119
0:05:53.546,000 --> 0:05:56,000
agricultural productivity in every major region of the world,

120
0:05:56.618,000 --> 0:05:58,000
moving mass numbers of people out of poverty.

121
0:05:59.928,000 --> 0:06:02,000
We just haven't finished delivering these things to everybody just yet,

122
0:06:03.291,000 --> 0:06:04,000
particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa.

123
0:06:05.925,000 --> 0:06:06,000
So overall, this is amazing news.

124
0:06:07.671,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Humanity actually solved agricultural poverty a century ago,

125
0:06:11.677,000 --> 0:06:12,000
in theory.

126
0:06:12.908,000 --> 0:06:14,000
We just haven't delivered these things to everybody just yet.

127
0:06:16.354,000 --> 0:06:18,000
In this century, the reason that people remain poor

128
0:06:18.765,000 --> 0:06:2,000
is because maybe they live in remote places.

129
0:06:20.995,000 --> 0:06:22,000
They lack access to these things.

130
0:06:24.154,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Therefore, ending poverty is simply a matter

131
0:06:26.739,000 --> 0:06:29,000
of delivering proven goods and services to people.

132
0:06:30.185,000 --> 0:06:32,000
We don't need more genius types right now.

133
0:06:32.507,000 --> 0:06:36,000
The humble delivery guy is going to end global poverty in our lifetime.

134
0:06:38.088,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So these are the three levers,

135
0:06:39.6,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and the most powerful lever is simply delivery.

136
0:06:43.033,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Wherever the world's companies, governments and nonprofits

137
0:06:46.344,000 --> 0:06:48,000
set up delivery networks for life-improving goods,

138
0:06:49.4,000 --> 0:06:51,000
we eliminate poverty.

139
0:06:52.023,000 --> 0:06:53,000
OK, so that sounds really nice in theory,

140
0:06:54.04,000 --> 0:06:55,000
but what about in practice?

141
0:06:55.354,000 --> 0:06:57,000
What do these delivery networks look like?

142
0:06:58.006,000 --> 0:07:,000
I want to share the concrete example that I know best,

143
0:07:00.565,000 --> 0:07:01,000
my organization, One Acre Fund.

144
0:07:03.165,000 --> 0:07:04,000
We only serve the farmer,

145
0:07:04.584,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and our job is to provide her with the tools that she needs to succeed.

146
0:07:08.284,000 --> 0:07:1,000
We start off by delivering farm inputs to really rural places.

147
0:07:11.262,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Now, this may appear initially very challenging,

148
0:07:13.552,000 --> 0:07:15,000
but it's pretty possible. Let me show you.

149
0:07:15.787,000 --> 0:07:18,000
We buy farm inputs with the combined power of our farmer network,

150
0:07:18.871,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and store it in 20 warehouses like this.

151
0:07:21.638,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Then, during input delivery, we rent hundreds of 10-ton trucks

152
0:07:25.638,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and send them out to where farmers are waiting in the field.

153
0:07:28.953,000 --> 0:07:31,000
They then get their individual orders and walk it home to their farms.

154
0:07:32.415,000 --> 0:07:34,000
It's kind of like Amazon for rural farmers.

155
0:07:35.694,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Importantly, realistic delivery also includes finance, a way to pay.

156
0:07:40.536,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Farmers pay us little by little over time, covering most of our expenses.

157
0:07:45.587,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And then we surround all that with training.

158
0:07:48.151,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Our rural field officers deliver practical, hands-on training

159
0:07:51.826,000 --> 0:07:52,000
to farmers in the field

160
0:07:53.255,000 --> 0:07:54,000
every two weeks.

161
0:07:55.496,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Wherever we deliver our services, farmers use these tools

162
0:07:59.104,000 --> 0:08:,000
to climb out of poverty.

163
0:08:01.193,000 --> 0:08:03,000
This is a farmer in our program, Consolata.

164
0:08:04.033,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Look at the pride on her face.

165
0:08:06.212,000 --> 0:08:09,000
She has achieved a modest prosperity that I believe is the human right

166
0:08:09.894,000 --> 0:08:11,000
of every hardworking person on the planet.

167
0:08:13.264,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Today, I'm proud to say that we're serving about 400,000 farmers like Consolata.

168
0:08:18.19,000 --> 0:08:23,000
(Applause)

169
0:08:23.881,000 --> 0:08:25,000
The key to doing this is scalable delivery.

170
0:08:26.482,000 --> 0:08:28,000
In any given area, we hire a rural field officer

171
0:08:29.395,000 --> 0:08:32,000
who delivers our services to 200 farmers, on average,

172
0:08:32.575,000 --> 0:08:34,000
with more than 1,000 people living in those families.

173
0:08:35.805,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Today, we have 2,000 of these rural field officers

174
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
growing very quickly.

175
0:08:40.665,000 --> 0:08:41,000
This is our delivery army,

176
0:08:42.991,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and we're just one organization.

177
0:08:44.682,000 --> 0:08:47,000
There are many companies, governments and nonprofits

178
0:08:47.87,000 --> 0:08:49,000
that have delivery armies just like this.

179
0:08:50.105,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And I believe we stand at a moment in time

180
0:08:52.175,000 --> 0:08:56,000
where collectively, we are capable of delivering farm services to all farmers.

181
0:08:57.755,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Let me show you how possible this is.

182
0:08:59.96,000 --> 0:09:,000
This is a map of Sub-Saharan Africa,

183
0:09:01.853,000 --> 0:09:03,000
with a map of the United States for scale.

184
0:09:03.982,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I chose Sub-Saharan Africa because this is a huge delivery territory.

185
0:09:07.394,000 --> 0:09:08,000
It's very challenging.

186
0:09:09.248,000 --> 0:09:12,000
But we analyzed every 50-mile by 50-mile block on the continent,

187
0:09:13.292,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and we found that half of farmers live in just these shaded regions.

188
0:09:19.265,000 --> 0:09:21,000
That's a remarkably small area overall.

189
0:09:22.195,000 --> 0:09:24,000
If you were to lay these boxes next to each other

190
0:09:24.528,000 --> 0:09:25,000
within a map of the United States,

191
0:09:26.188,000 --> 0:09:28,000
they would only cover the Eastern United States.

192
0:09:29.284,000 --> 0:09:32,000
You can order pizza anywhere in this territory

193
0:09:32.832,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and it'll arrive to your house hot, fresh and delicious.

194
0:09:36.581,000 --> 0:09:39,000
If America can deliver pizza to an area of this size,

195
0:09:39.872,000 --> 0:09:42,000
then Africa's companies, governments and non-profits

196
0:09:42.919,000 --> 0:09:45,000
can deliver farm services to all of her farmers.

197
0:09:45.966,000 --> 0:09:46,000
This is possible.

198
0:09:48.995,000 --> 0:09:5,000
I'm going to wrap up by generalizing beyond just farming.

199
0:09:52.292,000 --> 0:09:54,000
In every field of human development,

200
0:09:54.423,000 --> 0:09:57,000
humanity has already invented effective tools to end poverty.

201
0:09:58.276,000 --> 0:09:59,000
We just need to deliver them.

202
0:10:00.322,000 --> 0:10:02,000
So again, in every area of human development,

203
0:10:02.587,000 --> 0:10:05,000
super-smart people a long time ago invented inexpensive,

204
0:10:06.013,000 --> 0:10:07,000
highly effective tools.

205
0:10:07.869,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Humanity is armed to the teeth

206
0:10:09.825,000 --> 0:10:12,000
with simple, effective solutions to poverty.

207
0:10:13.596,000 --> 0:10:15,000
We just need to deliver these to a pretty small area.

208
0:10:17.266,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Again using the map of Sub-Saharan Africa as an example,

209
0:10:20.392,000 --> 0:10:23,000
remember that rural poverty is concentrated in these blue shaded areas.

210
0:10:24.44,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Urban poverty is even more concentrated, in these green little dots.

211
0:10:29.282,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Again, using a map of the United States for scale,

212
0:10:32.317,000 --> 0:10:35,000
this is what I would call a highly achievable delivery zone.

213
0:10:36.346,000 --> 0:10:38,000
In fact, for the first time in human history,

214
0:10:38.532,000 --> 0:10:41,000
we have a vast amount of delivery infrastructure available to us.

215
0:10:42.055,000 --> 0:10:44,000
The world's companies, governments and non-profits

216
0:10:44.803,000 --> 0:10:46,000
have delivery armies that are fully capable

217
0:10:47.05,000 --> 0:10:49,000
of covering this relatively small area.

218
0:10:49.927,000 --> 0:10:51,000
We just lack the will.

219
0:10:52.913,000 --> 0:10:53,000
If we are willing,

220
0:10:54.348,000 --> 0:10:55,000
every one of us has a role to play.

221
0:10:57.92,000 --> 0:11:,000
We first need more people to pursue careers in human development,

222
0:11:01.315,000 --> 0:11:03,000
especially if you live in a developing nation.

223
0:11:03.487,000 --> 0:11:06,000
We need more front line health workers, teachers, farmer trainers,

224
0:11:06.997,000 --> 0:11:08,000
sales agents for life-improving goods.

225
0:11:09.439,000 --> 0:11:11,000
These are the delivery people that dedicate their careers

226
0:11:12.133,000 --> 0:11:13,000
to improving the lives of others.

227
0:11:14.532,000 --> 0:11:15,000
But we also need a lot of support roles.

228
0:11:17.731,000 --> 0:11:19,000
These are roles available at just my organization alone,

229
0:11:20.606,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and we're just one out of many.

230
0:11:22.399,000 --> 0:11:25,000
This may surprise you, but no matter what your technical specialty,

231
0:11:26.197,000 --> 0:11:28,000
there is a role for you in this fight.

232
0:11:29.158,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And no matter how logistically possible it is to end poverty,

233
0:11:32.529,000 --> 0:11:33,000
we need a lot more resources.

234
0:11:34.448,000 --> 0:11:35,000
This is our number one constraint.

235
0:11:36.811,000 --> 0:11:39,000
For private investors, we need a big expansion of venture capital,

236
0:11:40.211,000 --> 0:11:43,000
private equity, working capital, available in emerging markets.

237
0:11:44.477,000 --> 0:11:47,000
But there are also limits to what private business can accomplish.

238
0:11:47.928,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Private businesses often struggle to profitably serve the extreme poor,

239
0:11:51.897,000 --> 0:11:53,000
so philanthropy still has a major role to play.

240
0:11:54.998,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Anybody can give, but we need more leadership.

241
0:11:58.112,000 --> 0:11:59,000
We need more visionary philanthropists

242
0:12:00.083,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and global leaders who will take problems in human development

243
0:12:04.019,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and lead humanity to wipe them off the face of the planet.

244
0:12:08.276,000 --> 0:12:1,000
If you're interested in these ideas, check out this website.

245
0:12:11.122,000 --> 0:12:12,000
We need more leaders.

246
0:12:14.174,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Humanity has put people on the moon.

247
0:12:16.22,000 --> 0:12:18,000
We've invented supercomputers that fit into our pockets

248
0:12:18.821,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and connect us with anybody on the planet.

249
0:12:20.901,000 --> 0:12:23,000
We've run marathons at a five-minute mile pace.

250
0:12:24.207,000 --> 0:12:26,000
We are an exceptional people.

251
0:12:27.822,000 --> 0:12:3,000
But we've left more than one billion of our members behind.

252
0:12:31.485,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Until every girl like this one has an opportunity

253
0:12:33.807,000 --> 0:12:34,000
to earn her full human potential,

254
0:12:36.047,000 --> 0:12:39,000
we have failed to become a truly moral and just human race.

255
0:12:40.516,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Logistically speaking, it's incredibly possible

256
0:12:43.296,000 --> 0:12:44,000
to end extreme poverty.

257
0:12:45.22,000 --> 0:12:47,000
We just need to deliver proven goods and services

258
0:12:48.126,000 --> 0:12:49,000
to everybody.

259
0:12:49.665,000 --> 0:12:52,000
If we have the will, every one of us has a role to play.

260
0:12:54.024,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Let's deploy our time, our careers,

261
0:12:56.937,000 --> 0:12:57,000
our collective wealth.

262
0:12:58.781,000 --> 0:13:,000
Let us deliver an end to extreme poverty

263
0:13:01.541,000 --> 0:13:02,000
in this lifetime.

264
0:13:03.971,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Thank you.

265
0:13:05.146,000 --> 0:13:12,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
(Laughter)

2
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I was afraid of womanhood.

3
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Not that I'm not afraid now,

4
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
but I've learned to pretend.

5
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I've learned to be flexible.

6
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
In fact, I've developed some interesting tools

7
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
to help me deal with this fear.

8
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Let me explain.

9
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Back in the '50s and '60s, when I was growing up,

10
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and pretty and gentle and soft,

12
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and we were supposed to fit into roles

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that were sort of shadowy --

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
really not quite clear what we were supposed to be.

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
There were plenty of role models all around us.

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
We had our mothers, our aunts, our cousins, our sisters,

18
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and of course, the ever-present media

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
bombarding us with images and words,

20
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
telling us how to be.

21
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Now my mother was different.

22
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
She was a homemaker,

23
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
but she and I didn't go out and do girlie things together,

24
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and she didn't buy me pink outfits.

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Instead, she knew what I needed, and she bought me a book of cartoons.

26
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And I just ate it up.

27
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I drew, and I drew,

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and since I knew that humor was acceptable in my family,

29
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I could draw, do what I wanted to do,

30
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and not have to perform, not have to speak --

31
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I was very shy --

32
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and I could still get approval.

33
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I was launched as a cartoonist.

34
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Now when we're young,

35
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
we don't always know. We know there are rules out there,

36
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
but we don't always know --

37
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
we don't perform them right,

38
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
even though we are imprinted at birth

39
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
with these things,

40
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and we're told

41
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
what the most important color in the world is.

42
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
We're told what shape we're supposed to be in.

43
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
We're told what to wear --

45
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Laughter)

46
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
-- and how to do our hair --

47
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
-- and how to behave.

49
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Now the rules that I'm talking about

50
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
are constantly being monitored by the culture.

51
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
We're being corrected,

52
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and the primary policemen are women,

53
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
because we are the carriers of the tradition.

54
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
We pass it down from generation to generation.

55
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Not only that --

56
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
we always have this vague notion

57
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
that something's expected of us.

58
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And on top of all off these rules,

59
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
they keep changing.

60
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
(Laughter)

61
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
We don't know what's going on half the time,

62
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
so it puts us in a very tenuous position.

63
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
(Laughter)

64
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Now if you don't like these rules,

65
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and many of us don't --

66
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I know I didn't, and I still don't,

67
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
even though I follow them half the time,

68
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
not quite aware that I'm following them --

69
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
what better way than to change them [than] with humor?

70
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Humor relies on the traditions of a society.

71
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
It takes what we know, and it twists it.

72
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
It takes the codes of behavior and the codes of dress,

73
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and it makes it unexpected,

74
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and that's what elicits a laugh.

75
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Now what if you put together women and humor?

76
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I think you can get change.

77
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Because women are on the ground floor,

78
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and we know the traditions so well,

79
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
we can bring a different voice to the table.

80
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Now I started drawing

81
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
in the middle of a lot of chaos.

82
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I grew up not far from here in Washington D.C.

83
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
during the Civil Rights movement, the assassinations,

84
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
the Watergate hearings and then the feminist movement,

85
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and I think I was drawing,

86
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
trying to figure out what was going on.

87
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And then also my family was in chaos,

88
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and I drew to try to bring my family together --

89
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
(Laughter)

90
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
-- try to bring my family together with laughter.

91
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
It didn't work.

92
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
My parents got divorced, and my sister was arrested.

93
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
But I found my place.

94
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I found that I didn't have to wear high heels,

95
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I didn't have to wear pink,

96
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and I could feel like I fit in.

97
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Now when I was a little older, in my 20s,

98
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I realized there are not many women in cartooning.

99
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And I thought, "Well, maybe I can break

100
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
the little glass ceiling of cartooning,"

101
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and so I did. I became a cartoonist.

102
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And then I thought -- in my 40s I started thinking,

103
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
"Well, why don't I do something?

104
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I always loved political cartoons,

105
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
so why don't I do something with the content of my cartoons

106
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
to make people think about the stupid rules that we're following

107
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
as well as laugh?"

108
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Now my perspective

109
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
is a particularly --

110
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
(Laughter)

111
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
-- my perspective is a particularly American perspective.

112
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I can't help it. I live here.

113
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Even though I've traveled a lot,

114
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I still think like an American woman.

115
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
But I believe that the rules that I'm talking about

116
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
are universal, of course --

117
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
that each culture has its different codes of behavior

118
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and dress and traditions,

119
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and each woman has to deal with these same things

120
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that we do here in the U.S.

121
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Consequently, we have.

122
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Women, because we're on the ground, we know the tradition.

123
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
We have amazing antennae.

124
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Now my work lately

125
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
has been to collaborate with international cartoonists,

126
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
which I so enjoy,

127
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and it's given me a greater appreciation

128
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
for the power of cartoons

129
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
to get at the truth,

130
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
to get at the issues quickly and succinctly.

131
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And not only that, it can get to the viewer

132
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
through not only the intellect, but through the heart.

133
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
My work also has allowed me to collaborate

134
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
with women cartoonists from across the world --

135
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
countries such as Saudi Arabia,

136
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Iran, Turkey,

137
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Argentina, France --

138
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
and we have sat together and laughed

139
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and talked and shared our difficulties.

140
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And these women are working so hard to get their voices heard

141
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
in some very difficult circumstances.

142
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
But I feel blessed to be able to work with them.

143
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And we talk about

144
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
how women have such strong perceptions,

145
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
because of our tenuous position

146
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and our role as tradition-keepers,

147
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
that we can have the great potential

148
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
to be change-agents.

149
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And I think, I truly believe,

150
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
that we can change this thing

151
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
one laugh at a time.

152
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Thank you.

153
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
(Applause)

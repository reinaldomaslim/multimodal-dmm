1
0:00:12.78,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I was a blue-eyed, chubby-cheeked five-year-old

2
0:00:15.46,000 --> 0:00:18,000
when I joined my family on the picket line for the first time.

3
0:00:19.66,000 --> 0:00:21,000
My mom made me leave my dolls in the minivan.

4
0:00:22.62,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I'd stand on a street corner in the heavy Kansas humidity,

5
0:00:25.74,000 --> 0:00:27,000
surrounded by a few dozen relatives,

6
0:00:28.38,000 --> 0:00:31,000
with my tiny fists clutching a sign that I couldn't read yet:

7
0:00:32.5,000 --> 0:00:33,000
"Gays are worthy of death."

8
0:00:34.94,000 --> 0:00:35,000
This was the beginning.

9
0:00:36.86,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Our protests soon became a daily occurrence

10
0:00:39.1,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and an international phenomenon,

11
0:00:41.06,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and as a member of Westboro Baptist Church,

12
0:00:43.54,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I became a fixture on picket lines across the country.

13
0:00:46.7,000 --> 0:00:48,000
The end of my antigay picketing career

14
0:00:49.06,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and life as I knew it,

15
0:00:50.5,000 --> 0:00:51,000
came 20 years later,

16
0:00:52.18,000 --> 0:00:54,000
triggered in part by strangers on Twitter

17
0:00:54.7,000 --> 0:00:56,000
who showed me the power of engaging the other.

18
0:00:59.1,000 --> 0:01:,000
In my home,

19
0:01:00.34,000 --> 0:01:03,000
life was framed as an epic spiritual battle between good and evil.

20
0:01:04.02,000 --> 0:01:06,000
The good was my church and its members,

21
0:01:06.62,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and the evil was everyone else.

22
0:01:09.7,000 --> 0:01:1,000
My church's antics were such

23
0:01:11.18,000 --> 0:01:13,000
that we were constantly at odds with the world,

24
0:01:13.62,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and that reinforced our otherness on a daily basis.

25
0:01:17.46,000 --> 0:01:19,000
"Make a difference between the unclean and the clean,"

26
0:01:20.1,000 --> 0:01:21,000
the verse says,

27
0:01:21.46,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and so we did.

28
0:01:22.82,000 --> 0:01:24,000
From baseball games to military funerals,

29
0:01:24.98,000 --> 0:01:27,000
we trekked across the country with neon protest signs in hand

30
0:01:28.78,000 --> 0:01:3,000
to tell others exactly how "unclean" they were

31
0:01:31.78,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and exactly why they were headed for damnation.

32
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
This was the focus of our whole lives.

33
0:01:38.22,000 --> 0:01:42,000
This was the only way for me to do good in a world that sits in Satan's lap.

34
0:01:43.18,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And like the rest of my 10 siblings,

35
0:01:45.18,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I believed what I was taught with all my heart,

36
0:01:47.66,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and I pursued Westboro's agenda with a special sort of zeal.

37
0:01:51.82,000 --> 0:01:53,000
In 2009, that zeal brought me to Twitter.

38
0:01:55.38,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Initially, the people I encountered on the platform

39
0:01:57.82,000 --> 0:01:59,000
were just as hostile as I expected.

40
0:02:00.06,000 --> 0:02:02,000
They were the digital version of the screaming hordes

41
0:02:02.58,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I'd been seeing at protests since I was a kid.

42
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But in the midst of that digital brawl,

43
0:02:07.74,000 --> 0:02:09,000
a strange pattern developed.

44
0:02:10.1,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Someone would arrive at my profile with the usual rage and scorn,

45
0:02:14.78,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I would respond with a custom mix of Bible verses, pop culture references

46
0:02:18.94,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and smiley faces.

47
0:02:21.299,000 --> 0:02:25,000
They would be understandably confused and caught off guard,

48
0:02:25.46,000 --> 0:02:26,000
but then a conversation would ensue.

49
0:02:27.94,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And it was civil --

50
0:02:29.22,000 --> 0:02:31,000
full of genuine curiosity on both sides.

51
0:02:32.18,000 --> 0:02:35,000
How had the other come to such outrageous conclusions about the world?

52
0:02:36.94,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Sometimes the conversation even bled into real life.

53
0:02:39.98,000 --> 0:02:4,000
People I'd sparred with on Twitter

54
0:02:41.66,000 --> 0:02:43,000
would come out to the picket line to see me

55
0:02:44.02,000 --> 0:02:45,000
when I protested in their city.

56
0:02:46.66,000 --> 0:02:48,000
A man named David was one such person.

57
0:02:49.34,000 --> 0:02:51,000
He ran a blog called "Jewlicious,"

58
0:02:52.62,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and after several months of heated but friendly arguments online,

59
0:02:55.74,000 --> 0:02:57,000
he came out to see me at a picket in New Orleans.

60
0:02:58.74,000 --> 0:03:01,000
He brought me a Middle Eastern dessert from Jerusalem, where he lives,

61
0:03:02.42,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and I brought him kosher chocolate

62
0:03:04.7,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and held a "God hates Jews" sign.

63
0:03:06.78,000 --> 0:03:08,000
(Laughter)

64
0:03:08.86,000 --> 0:03:1,000
There was no confusion about our positions,

65
0:03:10.94,000 --> 0:03:13,000
but the line between friend and foe was becoming blurred.

66
0:03:14.62,000 --> 0:03:16,000
We'd started to see each other as human beings,

67
0:03:16.9,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and it changed the way we spoke to one another.

68
0:03:20.1,000 --> 0:03:21,000
It took time,

69
0:03:21.34,000 --> 0:03:24,000
but eventually these conversations planted seeds of doubt in me.

70
0:03:24.9,000 --> 0:03:27,000
My friends on Twitter took the time to understand Westboro's doctrines,

71
0:03:28.58,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and in doing so,

72
0:03:29.82,000 --> 0:03:32,000
they were able to find inconsistencies I'd missed my entire life.

73
0:03:33.94,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Why did we advocate the death penalty for gays

74
0:03:36.86,000 --> 0:03:39,000
when Jesus said, "Let he who is without sin cast the first stone?"

75
0:03:41.1,000 --> 0:03:43,000
How could we claim to love our neighbor

76
0:03:43.58,000 --> 0:03:45,000
while at the same time praying for God to destroy them?

77
0:03:47.7,000 --> 0:03:5,000
The truth is that the care shown to me by these strangers on the internet

78
0:03:51.54,000 --> 0:03:52,000
was itself a contradiction.

79
0:03:54.02,000 --> 0:03:55,000
It was growing evidence

80
0:03:55.3,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that people on the other side were not the demons I'd been led to believe.

81
0:04:00.02,000 --> 0:04:02,000
These realizations were life-altering.

82
0:04:03.06,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Once I saw that we were not the ultimate arbiters of divine truth

83
0:04:06.34,000 --> 0:04:07,000
but flawed human beings,

84
0:04:08.14,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I couldn't pretend otherwise.

85
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I couldn't justify our actions --

86
0:04:12.74,000 --> 0:04:14,000
especially our cruel practice of protesting funerals

87
0:04:15.74,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and celebrating human tragedy.

88
0:04:19.34,000 --> 0:04:2,000
These shifts in my perspective

89
0:04:20.82,000 --> 0:04:23,000
contributed to a larger erosion of trust in my church,

90
0:04:23.94,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and eventually it made it impossible for me to stay.

91
0:04:28.5,000 --> 0:04:32,000
In spite of overwhelming grief and terror, I left Westboro in 2012.

92
0:04:34.58,000 --> 0:04:35,000
In those days just after I left,

93
0:04:36.5,000 --> 0:04:39,000
the instinct to hide was almost paralyzing.

94
0:04:40.06,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I wanted to hide from the judgement of my family,

95
0:04:42.42,000 --> 0:04:44,000
who I knew would never speak to me again --

96
0:04:44.66,000 --> 0:04:46,000
people whose thoughts and opinions had meant everything to me.

97
0:04:48.1,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And I wanted to hide from the world I'd rejected for so long --

98
0:04:51.5,000 --> 0:04:53,000
people who had no reason at all to give me a second chance

99
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
after a lifetime of antagonism.

100
0:04:57.42,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And yet, unbelievably,

101
0:04:59.02,000 --> 0:05:,000
they did.

102
0:05:00.5,000 --> 0:05:03,000
The world had access to my past because it was all over the internet --

103
0:05:03.9,000 --> 0:05:05,000
thousands of tweets and hundreds of interviews,

104
0:05:06.3,000 --> 0:05:09,000
everything from local TV news to "The Howard Stern Show" --

105
0:05:09.82,000 --> 0:05:11,000
but so many embraced me with open arms anyway.

106
0:05:13.62,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I wrote an apology for the harm I'd caused,

107
0:05:15.74,000 --> 0:05:18,000
but I also knew that an apology could never undo any of it.

108
0:05:19.78,000 --> 0:05:21,000
All I could do was try to build a new life

109
0:05:22.06,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and find a way somehow to repair some of the damage.

110
0:05:26.38,000 --> 0:05:28,000
People had every reason to doubt my sincerity,

111
0:05:28.78,000 --> 0:05:29,000
but most of them didn't.

112
0:05:30.7,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And --

113
0:05:32.5,000 --> 0:05:33,000
given my history,

114
0:05:33.74,000 --> 0:05:34,000
it was more than I could've hoped for --

115
0:05:35.7,000 --> 0:05:37,000
forgiveness and the benefit of the doubt.

116
0:05:38.18,000 --> 0:05:39,000
It still amazes me.

117
0:05:40.34,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I spent my first year away from home

118
0:05:44.3,000 --> 0:05:45,000
adrift with my younger sister,

119
0:05:46.02,000 --> 0:05:47,000
who had chosen to leave with me.

120
0:05:48.62,000 --> 0:05:49,000
We walked into an abyss,

121
0:05:50.18,000 --> 0:05:53,000
but we were shocked to find the light and a way forward

122
0:05:53.9,000 --> 0:05:55,000
in the same communities we'd targeted for so long.

123
0:05:57.42,000 --> 0:05:58,000
David,

124
0:05:58.66,000 --> 0:05:59,000
my "Jewlicious" friend from Twitter,

125
0:06:00.58,000 --> 0:06:03,000
invited us to spend time among a Jewish community in Los Angeles.

126
0:06:04.34,000 --> 0:06:07,000
We slept on couches in the home of a Hasidic rabbi and his wife

127
0:06:07.58,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and their four kids --

128
0:06:09.42,000 --> 0:06:11,000
the same rabbi that I'd protested three years earlier

129
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
with a sign that said, "Your rabbi is a whore."

130
0:06:16.74,000 --> 0:06:19,000
We spent long hours talking about theology and Judaism and life

131
0:06:20.7,000 --> 0:06:22,000
while we washed dishes in their kosher kitchen

132
0:06:22.94,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and chopped vegetables for dinner.

133
0:06:25.42,000 --> 0:06:26,000
They treated us like family.

134
0:06:27.46,000 --> 0:06:29,000
They held nothing against us,

135
0:06:29.58,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and again I was astonished.

136
0:06:32.58,000 --> 0:06:33,000
That period was full of turmoil,

137
0:06:34.3,000 --> 0:06:36,000
but one part I've returned to often

138
0:06:36.62,000 --> 0:06:38,000
is a surprising realization I had during that time --

139
0:06:40.34,000 --> 0:06:44,000
that it was a relief and a privilege to let go of the harsh judgments

140
0:06:44.62,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that instinctively ran through my mind about nearly every person I saw.

141
0:06:49.5,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I realized that now I needed to learn.

142
0:06:52.86,000 --> 0:06:53,000
I needed to listen.

143
0:06:55.34,000 --> 0:06:57,000
This has been at the front of my mind lately,

144
0:06:57.5,000 --> 0:06:59,000
because I can't help but see in our public discourse

145
0:07:00.46,000 --> 0:07:04,000
so many of the same destructive impulses that ruled my former church.

146
0:07:05.38,000 --> 0:07:08,000
We celebrate tolerance and diversity more than at any other time in memory,

147
0:07:09.34,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and still we grow more and more divided.

148
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
We want good things --

149
0:07:14.18,000 --> 0:07:17,000
justice, equality, freedom, dignity, prosperity --

150
0:07:17.82,000 --> 0:07:18,000
but the path we've chosen

151
0:07:19.14,000 --> 0:07:22,000
looks so much like the one I walked away from four years ago.

152
0:07:23.18,000 --> 0:07:26,000
We've broken the world into us and them,

153
0:07:26.34,000 --> 0:07:28,000
only emerging from our bunkers long enough

154
0:07:28.42,000 --> 0:07:3,000
to lob rhetorical grenades at the other camp.

155
0:07:31.66,000 --> 0:07:34,000
We write off half the country as out-of-touch liberal elites

156
0:07:35.38,000 --> 0:07:37,000
or racist misogynist bullies.

157
0:07:38.02,000 --> 0:07:41,000
No nuance, no complexity, no humanity.

158
0:07:42.3,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Even when someone does call for empathy and understanding for the other side,

159
0:07:46.14,000 --> 0:07:47,000
the conversation nearly always devolves

160
0:07:48.06,000 --> 0:07:5,000
into a debate about who deserves more empathy.

161
0:07:51.54,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And just as I learned to do,

162
0:07:53.06,000 --> 0:07:56,000
we routinely refuse to acknowledge the flaws in our positions

163
0:07:56.62,000 --> 0:07:57,000
or the merits in our opponent's.

164
0:07:59.02,000 --> 0:08:,000
Compromise is anathema.

165
0:08:01.42,000 --> 0:08:05,000
We even target people on our own side when they dare to question the party line.

166
0:08:06.62,000 --> 0:08:1,000
This path has brought us cruel, sniping, deepening polarization,

167
0:08:11.14,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and even outbreaks of violence.

168
0:08:13.38,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I remember this path.

169
0:08:15.46,000 --> 0:08:17,000
It will not take us where we want to go.

170
0:08:18.9,000 --> 0:08:2,000
What gives me hope is that we can do something about this.

171
0:08:22.38,000 --> 0:08:23,000
The good news is that it's simple,

172
0:08:24.66,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and the bad news is that it's hard.

173
0:08:27.02,000 --> 0:08:3,000
We have to talk and listen to people we disagree with.

174
0:08:31.86,000 --> 0:08:32,000
It's hard because we often can't fathom

175
0:08:33.78,000 --> 0:08:35,000
how the other side came to their positions.

176
0:08:36.62,000 --> 0:08:38,000
It's hard because righteous indignation,

177
0:08:39.22,000 --> 0:08:42,000
that sense of certainty that ours is the right side,

178
0:08:42.42,000 --> 0:08:43,000
is so seductive.

179
0:08:44.739,000 --> 0:08:47,000
It's hard because it means extending empathy and compassion

180
0:08:48.1,000 --> 0:08:5,000
to people who show us hostility and contempt.

181
0:08:51.42,000 --> 0:08:53,000
The impulse to respond in kind is so tempting,

182
0:08:55.18,000 --> 0:08:56,000
but that isn't who we want to be.

183
0:08:57.14,000 --> 0:08:58,000
We can resist.

184
0:08:58.82,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And I will always be inspired to do so by those people I encountered on Twitter,

185
0:09:03.3,000 --> 0:09:06,000
apparent enemies who became my beloved friends.

186
0:09:07.02,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And in the case of one particularly understanding and generous guy,

187
0:09:10.46,000 --> 0:09:11,000
my husband.

188
0:09:12.62,000 --> 0:09:14,000
There was nothing special about the way I responded to him.

189
0:09:16.78,000 --> 0:09:18,000
What was special was their approach.

190
0:09:19.9,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I thought about it a lot over the past few years

191
0:09:22.5,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and I found four things they did differently

192
0:09:25.38,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that made real conversation possible.

193
0:09:28.82,000 --> 0:09:3,000
These four steps were small but powerful,

194
0:09:31.18,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and I do everything I can to employ them in difficult conversations today.

195
0:09:36.06,000 --> 0:09:39,000
The first is don't assume bad intent.

196
0:09:40.06,000 --> 0:09:41,000
My friends on Twitter realized

197
0:09:41.54,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that even when my words were aggressive and offensive,

198
0:09:44.5,000 --> 0:09:46,000
I sincerely believed I was doing the right thing.

199
0:09:47.42,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Assuming ill motives almost instantly cuts us off

200
0:09:50.42,000 --> 0:09:54,000
from truly understanding why someone does and believes as they do.

201
0:09:54.74,000 --> 0:09:55,000
We forget that they're a human being

202
0:09:56.5,000 --> 0:09:58,000
with a lifetime of experience that shaped their mind,

203
0:09:59.5,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and we get stuck on that first wave of anger,

204
0:10:02.22,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and the conversation has a very hard time ever moving beyond it.

205
0:10:06.62,000 --> 0:10:08,000
But when we assume good or neutral intent,

206
0:10:09.3,000 --> 0:10:12,000
we give our minds a much stronger framework for dialogue.

207
0:10:13.98,000 --> 0:10:15,000
The second is ask questions.

208
0:10:17.58,000 --> 0:10:19,000
When we engage people across ideological divides,

209
0:10:20.18,000 --> 0:10:22,000
asking questions helps us map the disconnect

210
0:10:22.66,000 --> 0:10:23,000
between our differing points of view.

211
0:10:25.02,000 --> 0:10:27,000
That's important because we can't present effective arguments

212
0:10:27.94,000 --> 0:10:3,000
if we don't understand where the other side is actually coming from

213
0:10:32.14,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and because it gives them an opportunity to point out flaws in our positions.

214
0:10:36.9,000 --> 0:10:38,000
But asking questions serves another purpose;

215
0:10:39.38,000 --> 0:10:41,000
it signals to someone that they're being heard.

216
0:10:42.58,000 --> 0:10:44,000
When my friends on Twitter stopped accusing

217
0:10:44.74,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and started asking questions,

218
0:10:46.54,000 --> 0:10:48,000
I almost automatically mirrored them.

219
0:10:49.58,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Their questions gave me room to speak,

220
0:10:51.46,000 --> 0:10:54,000
but they also gave me permission to ask them questions

221
0:10:54.86,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and to truly hear their responses.

222
0:10:57.7,000 --> 0:10:59,000
It fundamentally changed the dynamic of our conversation.

223
0:11:02.14,000 --> 0:11:03,000
The third is stay calm.

224
0:11:04.82,000 --> 0:11:05,000
This takes practice and patience,

225
0:11:06.66,000 --> 0:11:07,000
but it's powerful.

226
0:11:08.54,000 --> 0:11:12,000
At Westboro, I learned not to care how my manner of speaking affected others.

227
0:11:12.86,000 --> 0:11:15,000
I thought my rightness justified my rudeness --

228
0:11:15.94,000 --> 0:11:18,000
harsh tones, raised voices, insults, interruptions --

229
0:11:19.7,000 --> 0:11:21,000
but that strategy is ultimately counterproductive.

230
0:11:22.78,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Dialing up the volume and the snark is natural in stressful situations,

231
0:11:26.58,000 --> 0:11:31,000
but it tends to bring the conversation to an unsatisfactory, explosive end.

232
0:11:32.42,000 --> 0:11:35,000
When my husband was still just an anonymous Twitter acquaintance,

233
0:11:35.7,000 --> 0:11:37,000
our discussions frequently became hard and pointed,

234
0:11:38.58,000 --> 0:11:39,000
but we always refused to escalate.

235
0:11:41.18,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Instead, he would change the subject.

236
0:11:43.14,000 --> 0:11:45,000
He would tell a joke or recommend a book

237
0:11:45.38,000 --> 0:11:48,000
or gently excuse himself from the conversation.

238
0:11:49.38,000 --> 0:11:5,000
We knew the discussion wasn't over,

239
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
just paused for a time to bring us back to an even keel.

240
0:11:55.42,000 --> 0:11:58,000
People often lament that digital communication makes us less civil,

241
0:11:58.62,000 --> 0:12:02,000
but this is one advantage that online conversations have over in-person ones.

242
0:12:03.5,000 --> 0:12:05,000
We have a buffer of time and space

243
0:12:06.14,000 --> 0:12:09,000
between us and the people whose ideas we find so frustrating.

244
0:12:10.1,000 --> 0:12:12,000
We can use that buffer.

245
0:12:12.18,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Instead of lashing out, we can pause, breathe,

246
0:12:15.9,000 --> 0:12:17,000
change the subject or walk away,

247
0:12:18.1,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and then come back to it when we're ready.

248
0:12:22.02,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And finally ...

249
0:12:24.58,000 --> 0:12:25,000
make the argument.

250
0:12:27.94,000 --> 0:12:28,000
This might seem obvious,

251
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
but one side effect of having strong beliefs

252
0:12:31.86,000 --> 0:12:32,000
is that we sometimes assume

253
0:12:33.5,000 --> 0:12:38,000
that the value of our position is or should be obvious and self-evident,

254
0:12:38.62,000 --> 0:12:4,000
that we shouldn't have to defend our positions

255
0:12:40.86,000 --> 0:12:43,000
because they're so clearly right and good

256
0:12:43.98,000 --> 0:12:45,000
that if someone doesn't get it, it's their problem --

257
0:12:46.58,000 --> 0:12:47,000
that it's not my job to educate them.

258
0:12:49.38,000 --> 0:12:5,000
But if it were that simple,

259
0:12:50.74,000 --> 0:12:51,000
we would all see things the same way.

260
0:12:53.18,000 --> 0:12:55,000
As kind as my friends on Twitter were,

261
0:12:55.66,000 --> 0:12:57,000
if they hadn't actually made their arguments,

262
0:12:58.06,000 --> 0:13:01,000
it would've been so much harder for me to see the world in a different way.

263
0:13:02.78,000 --> 0:13:04,000
We are all a product of our upbringing,

264
0:13:05.22,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and our beliefs reflect our experiences.

265
0:13:08.38,000 --> 0:13:11,000
We can't expect others to spontaneously change their own minds.

266
0:13:12.38,000 --> 0:13:13,000
If we want change,

267
0:13:13.82,000 --> 0:13:14,000
we have to make the case for it.

268
0:13:16.98,000 --> 0:13:2,000
My friends on Twitter didn't abandon their beliefs or their principles --

269
0:13:21.06,000 --> 0:13:22,000
only their scorn.

270
0:13:23.06,000 --> 0:13:26,000
They channeled their infinitely justifiable offense

271
0:13:26.7,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and came to me with pointed questions tempered with kindness and humor.

272
0:13:31.7,000 --> 0:13:33,000
They approached me as a human being,

273
0:13:33.82,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and that was more transformative

274
0:13:35.42,000 --> 0:13:39,000
than two full decades of outrage, disdain and violence.

275
0:13:40.58,000 --> 0:13:43,000
I know that some might not have the time or the energy or the patience

276
0:13:44.38,000 --> 0:13:45,000
for extensive engagement,

277
0:13:45.66,000 --> 0:13:47,000
but as difficult as it can be,

278
0:13:47.74,000 --> 0:13:49,000
reaching out to someone we disagree with

279
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
is an option that is available to all of us.

280
0:13:53.1,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And I sincerely believe that we can do hard things,

281
0:13:56.94,000 --> 0:13:58,000
not just for them but for us and our future.

282
0:14:00.3,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Escalating disgust and intractable conflict

283
0:14:02.82,000 --> 0:14:04,000
are not what we want for ourselves,

284
0:14:04.98,000 --> 0:14:05,000
or our country

285
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
or our next generation.

286
0:14:09.34,000 --> 0:14:13,000
My mom said something to me a few weeks before I left Westboro,

287
0:14:13.66,000 --> 0:14:14,000
when I was desperately hoping

288
0:14:15.1,000 --> 0:14:17,000
there was a way I could stay with my family.

289
0:14:18.74,000 --> 0:14:2,000
People I have loved with every pulse of my heart

290
0:14:21.14,000 --> 0:14:24,000
since even before I was that chubby-cheeked five-year-old,

291
0:14:24.5,000 --> 0:14:26,000
standing on a picket line holding a sign I couldn't read.

292
0:14:27.98,000 --> 0:14:29,000
She said, "You're just a human being,

293
0:14:30.66,000 --> 0:14:31,000
my dear, sweet child."

294
0:14:33.58,000 --> 0:14:35,000
She was asking me to be humble --

295
0:14:35.86,000 --> 0:14:38,000
not to question but to trust God and my elders.

296
0:14:39.78,000 --> 0:14:42,000
But to me, she was missing the bigger picture --

297
0:14:43.34,000 --> 0:14:44,000
that we're all just human beings.

298
0:14:45.94,000 --> 0:14:47,000
That we should be guided by that most basic fact,

299
0:14:48.9,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and approach one another with generosity and compassion.

300
0:14:52.14,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Each one of us contributes to the communities

301
0:14:54.46,000 --> 0:14:56,000
and the cultures and the societies that we make up.

302
0:14:57.82,000 --> 0:15:01,000
The end of this spiral of rage and blame begins with one person

303
0:15:02.5,000 --> 0:15:06,000
who refuses to indulge these destructive, seductive impulses.

304
0:15:07.74,000 --> 0:15:1,000
We just have to decide that it's going to start with us.

305
0:15:10.78,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Thank you.

306
0:15:12.02,000 --> 0:15:16,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
These rocks have been hitting our earth for about three billion years,

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and are responsible for much of what’s gone on on our planet.

3
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
This is an example of a real meteorite,

4
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and you can see all the melting of the iron

5
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
from the speed and the heat when a meteorite hits the earth,

6
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and just how much of it survives and melts.

7
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
From a meteorite from space,

8
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
we’re over here with an original Sputnik.

9
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
This is one of the seven surviving Sputniks that was not launched into space.

10
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
This is not a copy.

11
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
The space age began 50 years ago in October,

12
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and that’s exactly what Sputnik looked like.

13
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And it wouldn’t be fun to talk about the space age

14
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
without seeing a flag that was carried

15
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
to the moon and back, on Apollo 11.

16
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
The astronauts each got to carry

17
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
about ten silk flags in their personal kits.

18
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
They would bring them back and mount them.

19
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So this has actually been carried to the moon

20
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and back.

21
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
So that’s for fun.

22
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
The dawn of books is, of course, important.

23
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And it wouldn’t be interesting to talk about the dawn of books

24
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
without having a copy of a Guttenberg Bible.

25
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
You can see how portable and handy it was to have your own Guttenberg

26
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
in 1455.

27
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
But what’s interesting about the Guttenberg Bible, and the dawn of this technology,

28
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
is not the book.

29
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
You see, the book was not driven by reading.

30
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
In 1455, nobody could read.

31
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So why did the printing press succeed?

32
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
This is an original page of a Guttenberg Bible.

33
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So you’re looking here at one of the first printed books

34
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
using movable type in the history of man,

35
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
550 years ago.

36
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
We are living at the age here at the end of the book,

37
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
where electronic paper will undoubtedly replace it.

38
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
But why is this so interesting? Here’s the quick story.

39
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
It turns out that in the 1450s,

40
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
the Catholic Church needed money,

41
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and so they

42
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
actually hand-wrote these things called indulgences,

43
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
which were forgiveness’s on pieces of paper.

44
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
They traveled all around Europe

45
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and sold by the hundreds or by the thousands.

46
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
They got you out of purgatory faster.

47
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And when the printing press was invented

48
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
what they found was they could print indulgences,

49
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
which was the equivalent of printing money.

50
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And so all of Western Europe started buying printing presses in 1455 --

51
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
to print out thousands,

52
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and then hundreds of thousands,

53
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and then ultimately millions

54
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
of single, small pieces of paper

55
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that got you out of middle hell and into heaven.

56
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
That is why the printing press succeeded,

57
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and that is why Martin Luther

58
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
nailed his 90 theses to the door:

59
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
because he was complaining that the Catholic Church had gone amok

60
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
in printing out indulgences and selling them

61
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
in every town and village and city in all of Western Europe.

62
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
So the printing press, ladies and gentlemen,

63
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
was driven entirely by the printing of forgivenesses

64
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and had nothing to do with reading.

65
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
More tomorrow. I also have pictures coming of the library

66
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
for those of you that have asked for pictures.

67
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
We’re going to have some tomorrow.

68
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
(Applause)

69
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Instead of showing an object from the stage

70
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I’m going to do something special for the first time.

71
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
We are going to show, actually, what the library looks like, OK?

72
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So, I am married to the most wonderful woman in the world.

73
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
You’re going to find out why in a minute,

74
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
because when I went to see Eileen,

75
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
this is what I said I wanted to build.

76
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
This is the Library of Human Imagination.

77
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
The room itself is three stories tall.

78
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
In the glass panels are 5,000 years of human imagination

79
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that are computer controlled.

80
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
The room is a theatre. It changes colors.

81
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And all throughout the library are different objects, different spaces.

82
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
It’s designed like an Escher print.

83
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Here is some of the lower level of the library,

84
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
where the exhibits constantly change.

85
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
You can walk through. You can touch.

86
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
You can see exactly how many of these types of items would fit in a room.

87
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
There’s my very own Saturn V.

88
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Everybody should have one, OK? (Laughter)

89
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So you can see here in the lower level of the library

90
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
the books and the objects.

91
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
In the glass panels all along is sort of the history of imagination.

92
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
There is a glass bridge that you walk across

93
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that’s suspended in space.

94
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So it’s a leap of imagination.

95
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
How do we create?

96
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Part of the question that I have answered is,

97
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
is we create by surrounding ourselves with stimuli:

98
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
with human achievement, with history,

99
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
with the things that drive us and make us human --

100
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
the passionate discovery, the bones of dinosaurs long gone,

101
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
the maps of space that we’ve experienced,

102
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and ultimately the hallways that stimulate our mind and our imagination.

103
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So hopefully tomorrow I’ll show

104
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
one or two more objects from the stage,

105
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
but for today I just wanted to say thank you

106
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
for all the people that came and talked to us about it.

107
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And Eileen and I are thrilled to open our home

108
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and share it with the TED community.

109
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
(Applause)

110
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
TED is all about patterns in the clouds.

111
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It’s all about connections.

112
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
It’s all about seeing things

113
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
that everybody else has seen before

114
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
but thinking about them in ways that nobody has thought of them before.

115
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And that’s really what discovery and imagination is all about.

116
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
For example, we can look

117
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
at a DNA molecule model here.

118
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
None of us really have ever seen one,

119
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
but we know it exists because we’ve been taught

120
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
to understand this molecule.

121
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But we can also look at an Enigma machine

122
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
from the Nazis in World War II

123
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that was a coding and decoding machine.

124
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Now, you might say, what does this have to do with this?

125
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Well, this is the code for life,

126
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and this is a code for death.

127
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
These two molecules

128
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
code and decode.

129
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And yet, looking at them, you would see a machine and a molecule.

130
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
But once you’ve seen them in a new way,

131
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
you realize that both of these things really are connected.

132
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And they’re connected primarily because of this here.

133
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
You see, this is a human brain model, OK?

134
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And it’s rare, because we never really get to see a brain.

135
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
We get to see a skull. But there it is.

136
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
All of imagination -- everything that we think,

137
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
we feel, we sense -- comes through the human brain.

138
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And once we create new patterns in this brain,

139
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
once we shape the brain in a new way,

140
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
it never returns to its original shape.

141
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And I’ll give you a quick example.

142
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
We think about the Internet;

143
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
we think about information that goes across the Internet.

144
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And we never think about the hidden connection.

145
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But I brought along here a lump of coal --

146
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
right here, one lump of coal.

147
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And what does a lump of coal have to do with the Internet?

148
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
You see, it takes the energy in one lump of coal

149
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
to move one megabyte of information across the net.

150
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So every time you download a file,

151
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
each megabyte is a lump of coal.

152
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
What that means is, a 200-megabyte file

153
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
looks like this, ladies and gentlemen. OK?

154
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So the next time you download a gigabyte,

155
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
or two gigabytes, it’s not for free, OK?

156
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
The connection is the energy it takes to run the web ,

157
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
and to make everything we think possible, possible.

158
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Thanks, Chris.

159
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.246,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I'm a process engineer, I know all about boilers and incinerators

2
0:00:20.544,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and fabric filters, and cyclones, and things like that.

3
0:00:24.226,000 --> 0:00:26,000
But I also have Marfan syndrome.

4
0:00:26.282,000 --> 0:00:27,000
This is an inherited disorder.

5
0:00:28.181,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And in 1992, I participated in a genetic study,

6
0:00:32.376,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and found to my horror, as you can see from the slide,

7
0:00:35.834,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that my ascending aorta was not in the normal range,

8
0:00:39.635,000 --> 0:00:4,000
the green line at the bottom.

9
0:00:41.255,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Everyone in here will be between 3.2-3.6,

10
0:00:44.162,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and I was already up at 4.4.

11
0:00:46.726,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And as you can see, my aorta dilated progressively,

12
0:00:50.936,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and I got closer and closer to the point where surgery was going to be necessary.

13
0:00:55.976,000 --> 0:00:57,000
The surgery on offer was pretty gruesome.

14
0:00:59.217,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Anesthetize you, open your chest,

15
0:01:01.827,000 --> 0:01:03,000
put you on an artificial heart and lung machine,

16
0:01:04.7,000 --> 0:01:07,000
drop your body temperature to about 18 centigrade,

17
0:01:07.893,000 --> 0:01:09,000
stop your heart, cut the aorta out,

18
0:01:10.581,000 --> 0:01:13,000
replace it with a plastic valve and a plastic aorta.

19
0:01:14.333,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And most importantly, commit you to a lifetime of anticoagulation therapy.

20
0:01:19.364,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Normally, warfarin.

21
0:01:21.216,000 --> 0:01:23,000
The thought of the surgery was not attractive.

22
0:01:23.854,000 --> 0:01:26,000
The thought of the warfarin was really quite frightening.

23
0:01:28.295,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So I said to myself,

24
0:01:29.585,000 --> 0:01:32,000
"I'm an engineer, I'm in R&D, this is just a plumbing problem."

25
0:01:33.04,000 --> 0:01:35,000
"I can do this, I can change this."

26
0:01:35.07,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So I set out to change the entire treatment for aortic dilation.

27
0:01:41.919,000 --> 0:01:43,000
The project aim is really quite simple.

28
0:01:45.856,000 --> 0:01:47,000
The only real problem with the ascending aorta

29
0:01:48.781,000 --> 0:01:49,000
in people with Marfan syndrome

30
0:01:50.366,000 --> 0:01:51,000
is that it lacks some tensile strength.

31
0:01:53.252,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So, the possibility exists to simply externally wrap the pipe,

32
0:01:58.875,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and it would remain stable and operate quite happily.

33
0:02:02.433,000 --> 0:02:06,000
If your high-pressure hose pipe or hydraulic line bulges a little,

34
0:02:07.128,000 --> 0:02:1,000
you just wrap some tape around it, it really is that simple.

35
0:02:10.652,000 --> 0:02:12,000
In concept, though not in execution.

36
0:02:14.498,000 --> 0:02:17,000
The great advantage of an external support, for me,

37
0:02:17.612,000 --> 0:02:19,000
was that I could retain all of my own bits,

38
0:02:20.325,000 --> 0:02:22,000
all of my own endothelium and valves,

39
0:02:22.641,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and not need any anticoagulation therapy.

40
0:02:27.001,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So, where do we start?

41
0:02:28.307,000 --> 0:02:3,000
This is a sagittal slice through me.

42
0:02:31.311,000 --> 0:02:35,000
In the middle, you can see that little structure squeezing out,

43
0:02:35.853,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that's the left ventricle,

44
0:02:37.364,000 --> 0:02:39,000
pushing blood out through the aortic valve.

45
0:02:40.209,000 --> 0:02:43,000
You can see two of the leaflets of the aortic valve working there.

46
0:02:43.4,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Up into the ascending aorta.

47
0:02:45.27,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And it's that part, the ascending aorta,

48
0:02:49.248,000 --> 0:02:53,000
which dilates and ultimately bursts, which of course is fatal.

49
0:02:54.57,000 --> 0:02:57,000
We started by organizing image acquisition

50
0:02:57.764,000 --> 0:03:02,000
from magnetic resonance and CT imaging machines,

51
0:03:02.848,000 --> 0:03:06,000
from which to make a model of the patient's aorta.

52
0:03:09.281,000 --> 0:03:11,000
This is a model of my aorta.

53
0:03:11.504,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I've got a real one in my pocket,

54
0:03:13.371,000 --> 0:03:15,000
if anyone would like to look at it, and play with it.

55
0:03:15.875,000 --> 0:03:16,000
(Laughter)

56
0:03:16.908,000 --> 0:03:18,000
You can see it's quite a complex structure.

57
0:03:18.997,000 --> 0:03:2,000
It has a funny tri-lobal shape at the bottom,

58
0:03:21.566,000 --> 0:03:22,000
which contains the aortic valve.

59
0:03:23.585,000 --> 0:03:24,000
It then comes back into a round form,

60
0:03:25.567,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and then tapers and curves off.

61
0:03:28.668,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It's quite a difficult structure to produce.

62
0:03:33.012,000 --> 0:03:34,000
This is a sort of CAD model of me,

63
0:03:34.825,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and this is one of the later CAD models.

64
0:03:36.765,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We went through an iterative process of producing better and better models.

65
0:03:41.025,000 --> 0:03:43,000
When we produced that model,

66
0:03:43.94,000 --> 0:03:47,000
we turned it into a solid, plastic model, as you can see,

67
0:03:48.239,000 --> 0:03:51,000
using a rapid prototyping technique, another engineering technique.

68
0:03:52.72,000 --> 0:03:53,000
We then used that former

69
0:03:54.06,000 --> 0:03:58,000
to manufacture a perfectly bespoke porous textile mesh,

70
0:03:58.731,000 --> 0:04:01,000
which takes the shape of the former and perfectly fits the aorta.

71
0:04:02.932,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So this is absolutely personalized medicine at its best, really.

72
0:04:07.224,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Every patient we do has an absolutely bespoke implant.

73
0:04:12.757,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Once you've made it, the installation is quite easy.

74
0:04:15.834,000 --> 0:04:19,000
John Pepper, bless his heart, professor of cardiothoracic surgery.

75
0:04:21.154,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Never done it before in his life, he put the first one in, didn't like it,

76
0:04:24.656,000 --> 0:04:25,000
he put the second one in.

77
0:04:26.047,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Happy, away I went.

78
0:04:27.345,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Four and a half hours on the table, and everything was done.

79
0:04:30.179,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So the surgical implantation was actually the easiest part.

80
0:04:34.005,000 --> 0:04:37,000
If you compare our new treatment to the existing alternative,

81
0:04:37.217,000 --> 0:04:38,000
the composite aortic root graft,

82
0:04:39.008,000 --> 0:04:41,000
there are one or two startling comparisons

83
0:04:41.387,000 --> 0:04:43,000
which I'm sure will be clear to all of you.

84
0:04:44.735,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Two hours to install one of our devices,

85
0:04:47.033,000 --> 0:04:5,000
compared to 6 hours for the existing treatment.

86
0:04:51.444,000 --> 0:04:54,000
As I said, the existing treatment requires the heart-lung bypass machine,

87
0:04:54.949,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and it requires a total body cooling.

88
0:04:56.765,000 --> 0:04:58,000
We don't need any of that. We work on a beating heart.

89
0:04:59.468,000 --> 0:05:,000
He opens you up,

90
0:05:00.783,000 --> 0:05:02,000
he accesses the aorta while your heart is beating,

91
0:05:03.243,000 --> 0:05:04,000
all at the right temperature.

92
0:05:04.729,000 --> 0:05:06,000
No breaking into your circulatory system.

93
0:05:06.907,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So it really is great.

94
0:05:08.42,000 --> 0:05:11,000
But for me, absolutely the best point is,

95
0:05:11.783,000 --> 0:05:13,000
there is no anticoagulation therapy required.

96
0:05:14.671,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I don't take any drugs at all,

97
0:05:16.386,000 --> 0:05:18,000
other than recreational ones that I would choose to take.

98
0:05:19.147,000 --> 0:05:2,000
(Laughter)

99
0:05:20.524,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And in fact, if you speak to people who are on long-term warfarin,

100
0:05:23.78,000 --> 0:05:25,000
it is a serious compromise to your quality of life,

101
0:05:26.708,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and even worse, it inevitably foreshortens your life.

102
0:05:31.246,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Likewise, if you have the artificial valve option,

103
0:05:33.771,000 --> 0:05:34,000
you're committed to antibiotic therapy

104
0:05:35.605,000 --> 0:05:38,000
whenever you have any intrusive medical treatment,

105
0:05:38.696,000 --> 0:05:4,000
even trips to the dentist require that you take antibiotics,

106
0:05:41.653,000 --> 0:05:43,000
in case you get an internal infection on the valve.

107
0:05:44.512,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Again, I don't have any of that, so I'm entirely free,

108
0:05:47.531,000 --> 0:05:48,000
my artery is fixed.

109
0:05:49.452,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I haven't got to worry about it, which is a rebirth for me.

110
0:05:55.486,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Back to the theme of the presentation, multidisciplinary research,

111
0:05:58.607,000 --> 0:06:01,000
how on earth does a process engineer used to working with boilers

112
0:06:01.758,000 --> 0:06:04,000
end up producing a medical device which transforms his own life?

113
0:06:05.759,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Well, the answer to that is, a multidisciplinary team.

114
0:06:08.907,000 --> 0:06:1,000
This is a list of the core team,

115
0:06:11.643,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and you can see there aren't only two principal technical disciplines there,

116
0:06:16.89,000 --> 0:06:17,000
medicine and engineering,

117
0:06:18.182,000 --> 0:06:22,000
but also, there are various specialists from within those two disciplines.

118
0:06:22.739,000 --> 0:06:26,000
John Pepper was the cardiac surgeon who did all the actual work on me.

119
0:06:27.643,000 --> 0:06:3,000
But everyone else had to contribute one way or another.

120
0:06:30.987,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Raad Mohiaddin, a medical radiologist.

121
0:06:32.821,000 --> 0:06:36,000
We had to get good-quality images from which to make the CAD model.

122
0:06:36.894,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Warren Thornton, who still does all our CAD models for us,

123
0:06:39.741,000 --> 0:06:41,000
had to write a bespoke piece of CAD code

124
0:06:42.749,000 --> 0:06:47,000
to produce this model from this really rather difficult input data set.

125
0:06:49.861,000 --> 0:06:52,000
There are some barriers to this, though, there are some problems.

126
0:06:53.042,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Jargon is a big one.

127
0:06:54.319,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I would think no one in this room understands the first four jargon points.

128
0:06:59.905,000 --> 0:07:02,000
The engineers amongst you will recognize "rapid prototyping" and "CAD."

129
0:07:03.375,000 --> 0:07:06,000
The medics amongst you, if there are any, will recognize the first two,

130
0:07:06.733,000 --> 0:07:09,000
but there will be nobody else here that understands all those four words.

131
0:07:10.39,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Taking the jargon out was very important

132
0:07:12.434,000 --> 0:07:16,000
to ensure that everyone in the team understood exactly what was meant

133
0:07:16.615,000 --> 0:07:17,000
when a particular phrase was used.

134
0:07:19.289,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Our disciplinary conventions were funny as well.

135
0:07:21.845,000 --> 0:07:24,000
We took a lot of horizontal slice images through me,

136
0:07:24.904,000 --> 0:07:27,000
produced those slices and used them to build a CAD model.

137
0:07:28.842,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And the very first CAD model we made,

138
0:07:30.727,000 --> 0:07:34,000
the surgeons were playing with it and couldn't quite figure it out.

139
0:07:35.49,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And then we realized that it was actually a mirror image of the real aorta.

140
0:07:39.379,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And it was a mirror image because in the real world,

141
0:07:42.86,000 --> 0:07:43,000
we always look down on plans,

142
0:07:44.695,000 --> 0:07:46,000
plans of houses, or streets, or maps.

143
0:07:47.268,000 --> 0:07:49,000
In the medical world, they look up at plans.

144
0:07:50.449,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So the horizontal images were all in inversion.

145
0:07:53.951,000 --> 0:07:55,000
So, one needs to be careful with disciplinary conventions.

146
0:07:56.69,000 --> 0:08:,000
Everyone needs to understand what is assumed and what is not.

147
0:08:02.092,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Institutional barriers were another serious headache in the project.

148
0:08:06.211,000 --> 0:08:08,000
The Brompton Hospital was taken over

149
0:08:08.324,000 --> 0:08:1,000
by the Imperial College School of Medicine.

150
0:08:10.614,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And there are some seriously bad relationship problems

151
0:08:14.281,000 --> 0:08:15,000
between the two organizations.

152
0:08:15.762,000 --> 0:08:17,000
I was working with the Imperial and the Brompton,

153
0:08:18.096,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and this generated some serious problems for the project.

154
0:08:20.791,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Really, problems that shouldn't exist.

155
0:08:23.847,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Research & Ethics Committee.

156
0:08:25.27,000 --> 0:08:27,000
If you want to do anything new in surgery,

157
0:08:27.294,000 --> 0:08:29,000
you have to get a license from your local Research & Ethics.

158
0:08:30.307,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I'm sure it's the same in Poland.

159
0:08:32.156,000 --> 0:08:37,000
There will be some form of equivalent which licenses new types of surgery.

160
0:08:37.608,000 --> 0:08:4,000
We didn't only have the bureaucratic problems associated with that,

161
0:08:40.775,000 --> 0:08:42,000
we also had professional jealousies.

162
0:08:42.886,000 --> 0:08:44,000
There were people on the Research & Ethics committee

163
0:08:45.339,000 --> 0:08:47,000
who really didn't want to see John Pepper succeed again.

164
0:08:48.092,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Because he is so successful.

165
0:08:49.967,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And they made extra problems for us.

166
0:08:53.701,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Bureaucratic problems.

167
0:08:55.674,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Ultimately, when you have a new treatment,

168
0:08:58.352,000 --> 0:09:02,000
you have to have a guidance note for all the hospitals in the country.

169
0:09:02.393,000 --> 0:09:05,000
In the UK, we have the National Institute and Clinical Excellence.

170
0:09:06.037,000 --> 0:09:08,000
You have an equivalent in Poland, no doubt.

171
0:09:08.061,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And we had to get past the NICE problem.

172
0:09:11.37,000 --> 0:09:13,000
We now have a great clinical guidance, out on the net.

173
0:09:14.156,000 --> 0:09:18,000
So any other hospitals interested can come along, read the NICE report,

174
0:09:18.82,000 --> 0:09:2,000
get in touch with us, and then get doing it themselves.

175
0:09:24.026,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Funding barriers, another big area to be concerned with.

176
0:09:30.424,000 --> 0:09:32,000
A big problem with understanding one of those perspectives.

177
0:09:33.258,000 --> 0:09:37,000
When we first approached one of the big, charitable UK organizations

178
0:09:37.545,000 --> 0:09:38,000
that fund this kind of stuff,

179
0:09:39.082,000 --> 0:09:41,000
we essentially gave them an engineering proposal.

180
0:09:41.511,000 --> 0:09:43,000
They didn't understand it, they were doctors, next to God,

181
0:09:44.331,000 --> 0:09:45,000
it must be rubbish, they binned it.

182
0:09:46.205,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So in the end, I went after private investors, just gave up on it.

183
0:09:49.465,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Most R&D is going to be institutionally funded,

184
0:09:52.719,000 --> 0:09:54,000
by the Polish Academy of Sciences

185
0:09:55.103,000 --> 0:09:58,000
or the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, or whatever.

186
0:09:58.792,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And you need to get past those people.

187
0:10:01.009,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Jargon is a huge problem when you try to work across disciplines,

188
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
because in an engineering world, we all understand CAD and RP.

189
0:10:07.831,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Not in the medical world.

190
0:10:10.009,000 --> 0:10:13,000
I suppose the funding bureaucrats ultimately have to get their act together.

191
0:10:13.605,000 --> 0:10:15,000
They've really got to start talking to each other,

192
0:10:15.981,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and exercise a bit of imagination, if that's not too much to ask.

193
0:10:19.361,000 --> 0:10:2,000
(Laughter)

194
0:10:20.596,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Which it probably is.

195
0:10:22.509,000 --> 0:10:23,000
(Laughter)

196
0:10:23.848,000 --> 0:10:25,000
I've coined the phrase "obstructive conservatism."

197
0:10:26.232,000 --> 0:10:29,000
So many people in the medical world don't want to change.

198
0:10:29.838,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Particularly when some jumped-up engineer has come along with the answer.

199
0:10:33.378,000 --> 0:10:34,000
They don't want to change.

200
0:10:34.789,000 --> 0:10:36,000
They simply want to do whatever they've done before.

201
0:10:37.242,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And in fact, many surgeons in the UK are still waiting

202
0:10:40.565,000 --> 0:10:43,000
for one of our patients to have some sort of an episode,

203
0:10:43.718,000 --> 0:10:45,000
so that they could say, "Told you that was no good."

204
0:10:46.397,000 --> 0:10:48,000
We've actually got 30 patients.

205
0:10:48.657,000 --> 0:10:49,000
At seven and a half years,

206
0:10:50.507,000 --> 0:10:52,000
we've got 90 post-op patient years between us,

207
0:10:52.696,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and we haven't had a single problem.

208
0:10:54.496,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And still, there are people in the UK saying,

209
0:10:56.658,000 --> 0:10:58,000
"That external aortic root, it will never work, you know."

210
0:10:59.787,000 --> 0:11:01,000
It really is a problem.

211
0:11:02.216,000 --> 0:11:04,000
I'm sure everyone in this room has come across arrogance

212
0:11:05.043,000 --> 0:11:07,000
amongst medics, doctors, surgeons, at some point.

213
0:11:08.835,000 --> 0:11:12,000
The middle point is simply the way that the doctors protect themselves.

214
0:11:13.223,000 --> 0:11:15,000
"Well, of course, I'm looking after my patient."

215
0:11:15.598,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I think it's not good, but that's my view.

216
0:11:19.999,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Egos, of course, again a huge problem.

217
0:11:22.122,000 --> 0:11:23,000
If you work in a multidisciplinary team,

218
0:11:24.084,000 --> 0:11:26,000
you've got to give your guys the benefit of the doubt,

219
0:11:26.913,000 --> 0:11:27,000
you've got to express support for them.

220
0:11:28.813,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Tom Treasure, professor of cardiothoracic surgery.

221
0:11:32.303,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Incredible guy.

222
0:11:33.548,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Dead easy to give him respect.

223
0:11:35.062,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Him giving me respect? Slightly different.

224
0:11:37.851,000 --> 0:11:38,000
(Laughter)

225
0:11:39.327,000 --> 0:11:4,000
That's all the bad news.

226
0:11:40.682,000 --> 0:11:44,000
The good news is, the benefits are stonkingly huge.

227
0:11:44.927,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Translate that one! I bet they can't.

228
0:11:47.06,000 --> 0:11:48,000
(Laughter)

229
0:11:48.728,000 --> 0:11:51,000
When you have a group of people with different professional training,

230
0:11:51.991,000 --> 0:11:52,000
a different professional experience,

231
0:11:53.916,000 --> 0:11:55,000
they not only have a different knowledge base,

232
0:11:56.089,000 --> 0:11:58,000
but also a different perspective on everything.

233
0:11:58.334,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And if you can bring them together,

234
0:12:00.059,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and get them talking and understanding each other,

235
0:12:02.895,000 --> 0:12:04,000
the results can be spectacular.

236
0:12:05.527,000 --> 0:12:1,000
You can find really novel solutions that have never been looked at before,

237
0:12:10.642,000 --> 0:12:11,000
very quickly and easily.

238
0:12:12.388,000 --> 0:12:15,000
You can short-cut huge amounts of work

239
0:12:15.681,000 --> 0:12:18,000
simply by using the extended knowledge base you have.

240
0:12:19.31,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And as a result, it's an entirely different use

241
0:12:24.106,000 --> 0:12:26,000
of the technology and the knowledge around you.

242
0:12:27.168,000 --> 0:12:31,000
The result of all this is that you can get incredibly quick progress

243
0:12:31.307,000 --> 0:12:33,000
on incredibly small budgets.

244
0:12:33.8,000 --> 0:12:36,000
I'm so embarrassed at how cheap it was to get from my idea

245
0:12:37.697,000 --> 0:12:38,000
to me being implanted

246
0:12:39.055,000 --> 0:12:41,000
that I'm not prepared to tell you what it cost,

247
0:12:41.339,000 --> 0:12:45,000
because I suspect there are absolutely standard surgical treatments,

248
0:12:45.628,000 --> 0:12:46,000
probably in the USA,

249
0:12:46.998,000 --> 0:12:5,000
which cost more for a one-off patient

250
0:12:51.814,000 --> 0:12:55,000
than the cost of us getting from my dream to my reality.

251
0:12:56.715,000 --> 0:12:58,000
That's all I want to say, and I've got three minutes left.

252
0:12:59.501,000 --> 0:13:,000
So, Ewa's going to like me.

253
0:13:01.399,000 --> 0:13:04,000
If you have any questions, please come up and talk to me later on,

254
0:13:04.519,000 --> 0:13:06,000
it would be a pleasure to speak with you.

255
0:13:06.652,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Many thanks.

256
0:13:07.684,000 --> 0:13:08,000
(Applause)

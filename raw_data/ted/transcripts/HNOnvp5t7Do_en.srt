1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Chris Anderson: Julian, welcome.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It's been reported that WikiLeaks, your baby,

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
has, in the last few years

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
has released more classified documents

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
than the rest of the world's media combined.

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Can that possibly be true?

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Julian Assange: Yeah, can it possibly be true?

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
It's a worry -- isn't it? -- that the rest of the world's media

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
is doing such a bad job

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
that a little group of activists

11
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
is able to release more

12
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
of that type of information

13
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
than the rest of the world press combined.

14
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
CA: How does it work?

15
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
How do people release the documents?

16
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And how do you secure their privacy?

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
JA: So these are -- as far as we can tell --

18
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
classical whistleblowers,

19
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and we have a number of ways for them

20
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
to get information to us.

21
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
So we use this state-of-the-art encryption

22
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
to bounce stuff around the Internet, to hide trails,

23
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
pass it through legal jurisdictions

24
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
like Sweden and Belgium

25
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
to enact those legal protections.

26
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
We get information in the mail,

27
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
the regular postal mail,

28
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
encrypted or not,

29
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
vet it like a regular news organization, format it --

30
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
which is sometimes something that's quite hard to do,

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
when you're talking about

32
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
giant databases of information --

33
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
release it to the public

34
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and then defend ourselves

35
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
against the inevitable legal and political attacks.

36
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
CA: So you make an effort to ensure

37
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
the documents are legitimate,

38
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
but you actually

39
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
almost never know who the identity of the source is?

40
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
JA: That's right, yeah. Very rarely do we ever know,

41
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and if we find out at some stage

42
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
then we destroy that information as soon as possible.

43
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
(Phone ring) God damn it.

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
CA: I think that's the CIA asking what the code is

46
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
for a TED membership.

47
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So let's take [an] example, actually.

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
This is something

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
you leaked a few years ago.

51
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
If we can have this document up ...

52
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago.

53
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Can you tell us what you leaked and what happened?

54
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
JA: So this is the Kroll Report.

55
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
This was a secret intelligence report

56
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
commissioned by the Kenyan government

57
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
after its election in 2004.

58
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Prior to 2004, Kenya was ruled

59
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
by Daniel arap Moi

60
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
for about 18 years.

61
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
He was a soft dictator of Kenya.

62
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And when Kibaki got into power --

63
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
through a coalition of forces that were trying

64
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
to clean up corruption in Kenya --

65
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
they commissioned this report,

66
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
spent about two million pounds

67
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
on this and an associated report.

68
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And then the government sat on it

69
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and used it for political leverage on Moi,

70
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
who was the richest man --

71
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
still is the richest man -- in Kenya.

72
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
It's the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism.

73
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So I went there in 2007,

74
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and we managed to get hold of this

75
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
just prior to the election --

76
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
the national election, December 28.

77
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
When we released that report,

78
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
we did so three days after the new president, Kibaki,

79
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
had decided to pal up with

80
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
the man that he was going to clean out,

81
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Daniel arap Moi,

82
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
so this report then

83
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
became a dead albatross

84
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
around President Kibaki's neck.

85
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
CA: And -- I mean, to cut a long story short --

86
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
word of the report leaked into Kenya,

87
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
not from the official media, but indirectly,

88
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and in your opinion, it actually shifted the election.

89
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
JA: Yeah. So this became front page of the Guardian

90
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of Kenya,

91
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
in Tanzanian and South African press.

92
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And so it came in from the outside.

93
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And that, after a couple of days,

94
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
made the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it.

95
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And it ran for 20 nights straight on Kenyan TV,

96
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
shifted the vote by 10 percent,

97
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
according to a Kenyan intelligence report,

98
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
which changed the result of the election.

99
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
CA: Wow, so your leak

100
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
really substantially changed the world?

101
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
JA: Yep.

102
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
(Applause)

103
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
CA: Here's -- We're going to just show

104
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
a short clip from this

105
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Baghdad airstrike video.

106
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
The video itself is longer,

107
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
but here's a short clip.

108
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
This is -- this is intense material, I should warn you.

109
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Radio: ... just fuckin', once you get on 'em just open 'em up.

110
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I see your element, uh, got about four Humvees, uh, out along ...

111
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
You're clear. All right. Firing.

112
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Let me know when you've got them. Let's shoot.

113
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Light 'em all up.

114
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
C'mon, fire!

115
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Machine gun fire)

116
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Keep shoot 'n. Keep shoot 'n.

117
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Machine gun fire)

118
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Keep shoot 'n.

119
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Hotel ... Bushmaster Two-Six, Bushmaster Two-Six,

120
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
we need to move, time now!

121
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
All right, we just engaged all eight individuals.

122
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Yeah, we see two birds [helicopters], and we're still firing.

123
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Roger. I got 'em.

124
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Two-Six, this is Two-Six, we're mobile.

125
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Oops, I'm sorry. What was going on?

126
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
God damn it, Kyle. All right, hahaha. I hit 'em.

127
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
CA: So, what was the impact of that?

128
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
JA: The impact on the people who worked on it

129
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
was severe.

130
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
We ended up sending two people to Baghdad

131
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
to further research that story.

132
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So this is just the first of three attacks

133
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that occurred in that scene.

134
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
CA: So, I mean, 11 people died in that attack, right,

135
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
including two Reuters employees?

136
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
JA: Yeah. Two Reuters employees,

137
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
two young children were wounded.

138
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
There were between 18 and 26 people killed all together.

139
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
CA: And releasing this caused

140
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
widespread outrage.

141
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
What was the key element of this

142
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that actually caused the outrage, do you think?

143
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
JA: I don't know. I guess people can see

144
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
the gross disparity in force.

145
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
You have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street,

146
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and then an Apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer

147
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
firing 30-millimeter cannon shells

148
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
on everyone --

149
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
looking for any excuse to do so --

150
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and killing people rescuing the wounded.

151
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And there was two journalists involved that clearly weren't insurgents

152
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
because that's their full-time job.

153
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
CA: I mean, there's been this U.S. intelligence analyst,

154
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Bradley Manning, arrested,

155
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and it's alleged that he confessed in a chat room

156
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
to have leaked this video to you,

157
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
along with 280,000

158
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
classified U.S. embassy cables.

159
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I mean, did he?

160
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
JA: We have denied receiving those cables.

161
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
He has been charged,

162
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
about five days ago,

163
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
with obtaining 150,000 cables

164
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and releasing 50.

165
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Now, we had released,

166
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
early in the year,

167
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
a cable from the Reykjavik U.S. embassy,

168
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
but this is not necessarily connected.

169
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I mean, I was a known visitor of that embassy.

170
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
CA: I mean, if you did receive thousands

171
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
of U.S. embassy diplomatic cables ...

172
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
JA: We would have released them. (CA: You would?)

173
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
JA: Yeah. (CA: Because?)

174
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
JA: Well, because these sort of things

175
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
reveal what the true state

176
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
of, say,

177
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Arab governments are like,

178
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
the true human-rights abuses in those governments.

179
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
If you look at declassified cables,

180
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that's the sort of material that's there.

181
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
CA: So let's talk a little more broadly about this.

182
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I mean, in general, what's your philosophy?

183
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Why is it right

184
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
to encourage leaking of secret information?

185
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
JA: Well, there's a question as to what sort of information is important in the world,

186
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
what sort of information

187
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
can achieve reform.

188
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
And there's a lot of information.

189
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So information that organizations

190
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
are spending economic effort into concealing,

191
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
that's a really good signal

192
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that when the information gets out,

193
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
there's a hope of it doing some good --

194
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
because the organizations that know it best,

195
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
that know it from the inside out,

196
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
are spending work to conceal it.

197
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And that's what we've found in practice,

198
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and that's what the history of journalism is.

199
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
CA: But are there risks with that,

200
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
either to the individuals concerned

201
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
or indeed to society at large,

202
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
where leaking can actually have

203
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
an unintended consequence?

204
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
JA: Not that we have seen with anything we have released.

205
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
I mean, we have a harm immunization policy.

206
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
We have a way of dealing with information

207
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that has sort of personal --

208
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
personally identifying information in it.

209
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
But there are legitimate secrets --

210
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
you know, your records with your doctor;

211
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
that's a legitimate secret --

212
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward

213
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that are really sort of well-motivated.

214
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
CA: So they are well-motivated.

215
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And what would you say to, for example,

216
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
the, you know, the parent of someone

217
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
whose son is out serving the U.S. military,

218
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and he says, "You know what,

219
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
you've put up something that someone had an incentive to put out.

220
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
It shows a U.S. soldier laughing

221
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
at people dying.

222
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
That gives the impression, has given the impression,

223
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
to millions of people around the world

224
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
that U.S. soldiers are inhuman people.

225
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Actually, they're not. My son isn't. How dare you?"

226
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
What would you say to that?

227
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
JA: Yeah, we do get a lot of that.

228
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
But remember, the people in Baghdad,

229
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
the people in Iraq, the people in Afghanistan --

230
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
they don't need to see the video;

231
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
they see it every day.

232
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
So it's not going to change their opinion. It's not going to change their perception.

233
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
That's what they see every day.

234
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
It will change the perception and opinion

235
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
of the people who are paying for it all,

236
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and that's our hope.

237
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
CA: So you found a way to shine light

238
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
into what you see

239
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government.

240
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Light is good.

241
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
But do you see any irony in the fact that,

242
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
in order for you to shine that light,

243
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
you have to, yourself,

244
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
create secrecy around your sources?

245
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
JA: Not really. I mean, we don't have

246
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
any WikiLeaks dissidents yet.

247
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
We don't have sources who are dissidents on other sources.

248
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Should they come forward, that would be a tricky situation for us,

249
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
but we're presumably acting in such a way

250
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
that people feel

251
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
morally compelled

252
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
to continue our mission, not to screw it up.

253
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
CA: I'd actually be interested, just based on what we've heard so far --

254
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
I'm curious as to the opinion in the TED audience.

255
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
You know, there might be a couple of views

256
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
of WikiLeaks and of Julian.

257
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
You know, hero -- people's hero --

258
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
bringing this important light.

259
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Dangerous troublemaker.

260
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Who's got the hero view?

261
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Who's got the dangerous troublemaker view?

262
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
JA: Oh, come on. There must be some.

263
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
CA: It's a soft crowd, Julian, a soft crowd.

264
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
We have to try better. Let's show them another example.

265
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Now here's something that you haven't yet leaked,

266
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
but I think for TED you are.

267
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I mean it's an intriguing story that's just happened, right?

268
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
What is this?

269
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
JA: So this is a sample of what we do

270
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
sort of every day.

271
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
So late last year -- in November last year --

272
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
there was a series of well blowouts

273
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
in Albania,

274
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
like the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico,

275
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
but not quite as big.

276
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And we got a report --

277
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
a sort of engineering analysis into what happened --

278
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
saying that, in fact, security guards

279
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
from some rival, various competing oil firms

280
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
had, in fact, parked trucks there and blown them up.

281
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And part of the Albanian government was in this, etc., etc.

282
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
And the engineering report

283
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
had nothing on the top of it,

284
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
so it was an extremely difficult document for us.

285
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
We couldn't verify it because we didn't know

286
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
who wrote it and knew what it was about.

287
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was

288
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up.

289
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
So under that basis, we put it out and said,

290
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
"Look, we're skeptical about this thing.

291
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
We don't know, but what can we do?

292
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
The material looks good, it feels right,

293
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
but we just can't verify it."

294
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And we then got a letter

295
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
just this week

296
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
from the company who wrote it,

297
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
wanting to track down the source --

298
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
(Laughter)

299
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
saying, "Hey, we want to track down the source."

300
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And we were like, "Oh, tell us more.

301
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
What document is it, precisely, you're talking about?

302
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Can you show that you had legal authority over that document?

303
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Is it really yours?"

304
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
So they sent us this screen shot

305
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
with the author

306
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
in the Microsoft Word ID.

307
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Yeah.

308
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
(Applause)

309
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
That's happened quite a lot though.

310
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
This is like one of our methods

311
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
of identifying, of verifying, what a material is,

312
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
is to try and get these guys to write letters.

313
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
CA: Yeah. Have you had information

314
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
from inside BP?

315
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
JA: Yeah, we have a lot, but I mean, at the moment,

316
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort.

317
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
So our publication rate

318
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
over the past few months

319
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
has been sort of minimized

320
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
while we're re-engineering our back systems

321
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
for the phenomenal public interest that we have.

322
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
That's a problem.

323
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
I mean, like any sort of growing startup organization,

324
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
we are sort of overwhelmed

325
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
by our growth,

326
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and that means we're getting enormous quantity

327
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
of whistleblower disclosures

328
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
of a very high caliber

329
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
but don't have enough people to actually

330
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
process and vet this information.

331
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
CA: So that's the key bottleneck,

332
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
basically journalistic volunteers

333
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and/or the funding of journalistic salaries?

334
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
JA: Yep. Yeah, and trusted people.

335
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
I mean, we're an organization

336
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
that is hard to grow very quickly

337
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
because of the sort of material we deal with,

338
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
so we have to restructure

339
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
in order to have people

340
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
who will deal with the highest national security stuff,

341
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and then lower security cases.

342
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
CA: So help us understand a bit about you personally

343
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
and how you came to do this.

344
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And I think I read that as a kid

345
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
you went to 37 different schools.

346
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Can that be right?

347
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
JA: Well, my parents were in the movie business

348
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and then on the run from a cult,

349
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
so the combination between the two ...

350
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
(Laughter)

351
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
CA: I mean, a psychologist might say

352
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
that's a recipe for breeding paranoia.

353
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
JA: What, the movie business?

354
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
(Laughter)

355
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
(Applause)

356
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
CA: And you were also -- I mean,

357
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
you were also a hacker at an early age

358
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and ran into the authorities early on.

359
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
JA: Well, I was a journalist.

360
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
You know, I was a very young journalist activist at an early age.

361
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
I wrote a magazine,

362
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
was prosecuted for it when I was a teenager.

363
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
So you have to be careful with hacker.

364
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
I mean there's like -- there's a method

365
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
that can be deployed for various things.

366
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Unfortunately, at the moment,

367
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
it's mostly deployed by the Russian mafia

368
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
in order to steal your grandmother's bank accounts.

369
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
So this phrase is not,

370
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
not as nice as it used to be.

371
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
CA: Yeah, well, I certainly don't think

372
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
you're stealing anyone's grandmother's bank account,

373
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
but what about

374
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
your core values?

375
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Can you give us a sense of what they are

376
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and maybe some incident in your life

377
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
that helped determine them?

378
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
JA: I'm not sure about the incident.

379
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
But the core values:

380
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
well, capable, generous men

381
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
do not create victims;

382
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
they nurture victims.

383
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
And that's something from my father

384
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
and something from other capable, generous men

385
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
that have been in my life.

386
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
CA: Capable, generous men do not create victims;

387
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
they nurture victims?

388
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
JA: Yeah. And you know,

389
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
I'm a combative person,

390
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
so I'm not actually so big on the nurture,

391
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
but some way --

392
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
there is another way of nurturing victims,

393
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
which is to police perpetrators

394
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
of crime.

395
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
And so that is something

396
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
that has been in my character

397
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
for a long time.

398
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
CA: So just tell us, very quickly in the last minute, the story:

399
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
what happened in Iceland?

400
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
You basically published something there,

401
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
ran into trouble with a bank,

402
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
then the news service there

403
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
was injuncted from running the story.

404
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
Instead, they publicized your side.

405
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
That made you very high-profile in Iceland. What happened next?

406
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
JA: Yeah, this is a great case, you know.

407
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
Iceland went through this financial crisis.

408
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
It was the hardest hit of any country in the world.

409
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
Its banking sector was 10 times the GDP

410
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
of the rest of the economy.

411
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
Anyway, so we release this report

412
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
in July last year.

413
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
And the national TV station was injuncted

414
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
five minutes before it went on air,

415
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
like out of a movie: injunction landed on the news desk,

416
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
and the news reader was like,

417
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
"This has never happened before. What do we do?"

418
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Well, we just show the website instead,

419
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
for all that time, as a filler,

420
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
and we became very famous in Iceland,

421
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
went to Iceland and spoke about this issue.

422
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
And there was a feeling in the community

423
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
that that should never happen again,

424
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
and as a result,

425
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
working with Icelandic politicians

426
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
and some other international legal experts,

427
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
we put together a new sort of

428
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
package of legislation for Iceland

429
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
to sort of become an offshore haven

430
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
for the free press,

431
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
with the strongest journalistic protections in the world,

432
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:06,000
with a new Nobel Prize

433
0:18:06.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
for freedom of speech.

434
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
Iceland's a Nordic country,

435
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:13,000
so, like Norway, it's able to tap into the system.

436
0:18:13.26,000 --> 0:18:15,000
And just a month ago,

437
0:18:15.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
this was passed by the Icelandic parliament unanimously.

438
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
CA: Wow.

439
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:26,000
(Applause)

440
0:18:26.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
Last question, Julian.

441
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
When you think of the future then,

442
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:18:32,000
do you think it's more likely to be

443
0:18:32.26,000 --> 0:18:34,000
Big Brother exerting more control,

444
0:18:34.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
more secrecy,

445
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
or us watching

446
0:18:38.26,000 --> 0:18:4,000
Big Brother,

447
0:18:40.26,000 --> 0:18:43,000
or it's just all to be played for either way?

448
0:18:43.26,000 --> 0:18:45,000
JA: I'm not sure which way it's going to go.

449
0:18:45.26,000 --> 0:18:47,000
I mean, there's enormous pressures

450
0:18:47.26,000 --> 0:18:5,000
to harmonize freedom of speech legislation

451
0:18:50.26,000 --> 0:18:53,000
and transparency legislation around the world --

452
0:18:53.26,000 --> 0:18:55,000
within the E.U.,

453
0:18:55.26,000 --> 0:18:57,000
between China and the United States.

454
0:18:57.26,000 --> 0:19:,000
Which way is it going to go? It's hard to see.

455
0:19:00.26,000 --> 0:19:02,000
That's why it's a very interesting time to be in --

456
0:19:02.26,000 --> 0:19:04,000
because with just a little bit of effort,

457
0:19:04.26,000 --> 0:19:07,000
we can shift it one way or the other.

458
0:19:07.26,000 --> 0:19:1,000
CA: Well, it looks like I'm reflecting the audience's opinion

459
0:19:10.26,000 --> 0:19:12,000
to say, Julian, be careful,

460
0:19:12.26,000 --> 0:19:14,000
and all power to you.

461
0:19:14.26,000 --> 0:19:16,000
JA: Thank you, Chris. (CA: Thank you.)

462
0:19:16.26,000 --> 0:19:26,000
(Applause)

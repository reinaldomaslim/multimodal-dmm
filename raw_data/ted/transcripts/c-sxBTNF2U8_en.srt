0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
The night before I was heading for Scotland,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I was invited to host the final

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
of "China's Got Talent" show in Shanghai

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
with the 80,000 live audience in the stadium.

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Guess who was the performing guest?

6
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Susan Boyle.

7
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And I told her, "I'm going to Scotland the next day."

8
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
She sang beautifully,

9
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and she even managed to say a few words in Chinese:

10
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000

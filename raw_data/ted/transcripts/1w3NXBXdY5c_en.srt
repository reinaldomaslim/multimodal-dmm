1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:14,000
When you walk into your neighborhood public library,

2
0:00:15.64,000 --> 0:00:18,000
you expect the librarian to help you find your next favorite book

3
0:00:19.28,000 --> 0:00:22,000
or some accurate information on a topic at interest.

4
0:00:22.96,000 --> 0:00:24,000
You don't probably expect the librarian

5
0:00:25.28,000 --> 0:00:28,000
to come running out from behind the reference desk with Narcan,

6
0:00:28.96,000 --> 0:00:32,000
ready to revive someone overdosing on heroin or fentanyl.

7
0:00:34.52,000 --> 0:00:36,000
But this is happening at some libraries.

8
0:00:37.28,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Public libraries have always been about community support

9
0:00:40.6,000 --> 0:00:42,000
with all kinds of services and programs

10
0:00:42.84,000 --> 0:00:44,000
from assisting with job seeking efforts

11
0:00:45.2,000 --> 0:00:47,000
to locating resources for voter rights

12
0:00:47.88,000 --> 0:00:5,000
to providing free meals to kids and teens even.

13
0:00:51.2,000 --> 0:00:54,000
But what we think of as community support takes on new urgency

14
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
when you're in the middle of an opioid and overdose crisis.

15
0:00:59.24,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I work at the McPherson Square Library of the Free Library of Philadelphia.

16
0:01:03.36,000 --> 0:01:04,000
It's located in Kensington,

17
0:01:05.24,000 --> 0:01:08,000
one of the lowest income communities in Philadelphia,

18
0:01:08.56,000 --> 0:01:12,000
with a long history of being isolated from resources and opportunity.

19
0:01:13.72,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And because of that,

20
0:01:14.96,000 --> 0:01:18,000
it has been the center to the city's drug trade and drug use for decades.

21
0:01:20.92,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And so inside the neighborhood,

22
0:01:22.64,000 --> 0:01:25,000
our library is nestled inside of a park,

23
0:01:25.72,000 --> 0:01:27,000
which has unfortunately garnered a reputation

24
0:01:28.08,000 --> 0:01:3,000
for being a place to find and use drugs,

25
0:01:30.88,000 --> 0:01:31,000
especially heroin,

26
0:01:32.52,000 --> 0:01:33,000
out in the open,

27
0:01:34.36,000 --> 0:01:38,000
putting us and the community in direct contact

28
0:01:38.68,000 --> 0:01:4,000
with the drug trade and use on a daily basis.

29
0:01:41.44,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And so inside the library,

30
0:01:43.12,000 --> 0:01:46,000
it is routine to see people visibly intoxicated on opioids:

31
0:01:46.72,000 --> 0:01:49,000
eyes closing, body swaying slowly.

32
0:01:49.8,000 --> 0:01:52,000
It is routine for me to ask them if they are OK,

33
0:01:52.84,000 --> 0:01:53,000
but at the same time remind them

34
0:01:54.44,000 --> 0:01:55,000
if they can't keep their eyes open,

35
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
they have to go.

36
0:01:57.72,000 --> 0:02:,000
It is routine for our volunteer, Teddy,

37
0:02:01.12,000 --> 0:02:06,000
to pick up dozens of discarded needles on our property and throughout the park.

38
0:02:07.28,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And it is normal for kids to come into the library

39
0:02:10.24,000 --> 0:02:12,000
to tell me or our guard, Sterling,

40
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that someone is outside using,

41
0:02:15.36,000 --> 0:02:19,000
which typically means finding someone injecting on our front steps,

42
0:02:19.44,000 --> 0:02:2,000
benches

43
0:02:20.68,000 --> 0:02:21,000
or near the building,

44
0:02:21.96,000 --> 0:02:24,000
then asking them to move along because kids see them.

45
0:02:25.68,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And it is normal for the community

46
0:02:27.8,000 --> 0:02:3,000
to see people in various states of intoxication and withdrawal,

47
0:02:31.8,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to see people buying and selling,

48
0:02:34.36,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and to see people act and react violently.

49
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I'm not sharing this to sensationalize Kensington.

50
0:02:42.12,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I'm sharing this because this is the reality of a community

51
0:02:46.92,000 --> 0:02:49,000
that is constantly striving to move forward,

52
0:02:50.24,000 --> 0:02:52,000
but due to factors like structural racism,

53
0:02:52.72,000 --> 0:02:53,000
urban segregation,

54
0:02:54.24,000 --> 0:02:56,000
the cyclical nature of poverty,

55
0:02:56.6,000 --> 0:02:57,000
of trauma --

56
0:02:57.92,000 --> 0:02:59,000
the community has inequitable access

57
0:03:00.32,000 --> 0:03:03,000
to education, health care, employment and more.

58
0:03:04.96,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And this is also what it's like when the drug trade and use

59
0:03:08.28,000 --> 0:03:1,000
affects every aspect of life in the neighborhood.

60
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And the opioid epidemic has only amplified that stress.

61
0:03:16.44,000 --> 0:03:19,000
When I was hired by the Free Library in 2013,

62
0:03:19.76,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I specifically chose to work at McPherson

63
0:03:22.84,000 --> 0:03:25,000
because I understand what it's like to grow up in an environment

64
0:03:25.92,000 --> 0:03:28,000
where substance use disorder shapes the everyday,

65
0:03:29.12,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and I wanted to use those personal experiences

66
0:03:31.84,000 --> 0:03:32,000
as a guide for my work.

67
0:03:34.12,000 --> 0:03:35,000
But before I get to that,

68
0:03:35.52,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I want to share what it was like

69
0:03:37.2,000 --> 0:03:39,000
to witness this epidemic grow in Kensington.

70
0:03:41.08,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Like many other communities, we were just not prepared.

71
0:03:44.4,000 --> 0:03:46,000
We began to take notice of IDs we were seeing:

72
0:03:46.96,000 --> 0:03:48,000
addresses from nearby and upstate counties

73
0:03:49.84,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and then slowly out-of-state ones.

74
0:03:52.2,000 --> 0:03:56,000
People from Arkansas, Ohio, South Carolina, Alabama

75
0:03:56.4,000 --> 0:03:58,000
coming to Philadelphia for cheap heroin.

76
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:04,000
People began to linger longer and longer in our public restroom,

77
0:04:04.04,000 --> 0:04:06,000
causing us to pay more attention to the restroom

78
0:04:06.44,000 --> 0:04:08,000
than to our daily responsibilities

79
0:04:08.68,000 --> 0:04:11,000
because it was an accessible place to use drugs just purchased.

80
0:04:12.84,000 --> 0:04:15,000
One day our toilet clogged so badly in the restroom,

81
0:04:16.64,000 --> 0:04:18,000
we were forced to close our library for two days

82
0:04:19.48,000 --> 0:04:21,000
because the culprit of the clog was discarded needles.

83
0:04:22.88,000 --> 0:04:24,000
For a while prior to that incident,

84
0:04:25.08,000 --> 0:04:28,000
we had been asking for a sharps container for the restroom,

85
0:04:28.279,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and after that,

86
0:04:29.519,000 --> 0:04:32,000
the library administration quickly approved installing one

87
0:04:32.68,000 --> 0:04:34,000
along with hiring bathroom monitors.

88
0:04:36.88,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And as the weather warmed,

89
0:04:38.36,000 --> 0:04:39,000
we struggled to respond.

90
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:43,000
People began camping out in the park for days, weeks.

91
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:46,000
You could walk outside on a sunny, warm day

92
0:04:46.44,000 --> 0:04:51,000
to find multiple groups of people in various states of intoxication

93
0:04:51.64,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and children playing in between them.

94
0:04:54.12,000 --> 0:04:59,000
The amount of needles collected by Teddy on a monthly basis skyrocketed

95
0:04:59.52,000 --> 0:05:03,000
from 100 to 300 to 500 to 800,

96
0:05:03.84,000 --> 0:05:04,000
to over 1,000,

97
0:05:06.12,000 --> 0:05:09,000
with many found on our front steps and the playground.

98
0:05:11.04,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Then there were the overdoses.

99
0:05:14.64,000 --> 0:05:17,000
So many occurred outside in the park,

100
0:05:18.32,000 --> 0:05:2,000
some inside the library.

101
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Sterling, our guard, would spend his time walking in and out of the building

102
0:05:25.8,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and throughout the park,

103
0:05:27.08,000 --> 0:05:3,000
constantly making sure everyone was safe,

104
0:05:30.32,000 --> 0:05:31,000
because at times,

105
0:05:32.2,000 --> 0:05:35,000
our fear of having someone overdose and die came close.

106
0:05:36.68,000 --> 0:05:38,000
One overdose in particular occurred after school,

107
0:05:39.4,000 --> 0:05:42,000
so the library was full of kids, noise and commotion.

108
0:05:42.8,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And in all of that,

109
0:05:44.32,000 --> 0:05:46,000
we heard the thud from inside the public restroom.

110
0:05:47.52,000 --> 0:05:5,000
When we opened the door, we found a man on the floor, unresponsive.

111
0:05:50.72,000 --> 0:05:52,000
He was pulled out in plain sight of everyone --

112
0:05:52.96,000 --> 0:05:54,000
kids, teens, adults, families.

113
0:05:55.8,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Someone on staff called 911,

114
0:05:57.8,000 --> 0:05:59,000
someone else escorted the kids and teens downstairs,

115
0:06:00.76,000 --> 0:06:02,000
somebody went to flag down the ambulance in the park.

116
0:06:04.48,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And the rest of us --

117
0:06:06.28,000 --> 0:06:07,000
we just waited.

118
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
This had become our overdose drill

119
0:06:10.28,000 --> 0:06:12,000
because at the time, it was all we could do.

120
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So we waited and we watched this man lose air --

121
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
seize up.

122
0:06:17.88,000 --> 0:06:18,000
He was dying.

123
0:06:19.96,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I don't know how many of you have witnessed an overdose on opioids,

124
0:06:23.76,000 --> 0:06:24,000
but it's horrific

125
0:06:25.24,000 --> 0:06:27,000
because you know the gasping for air,

126
0:06:27.88,000 --> 0:06:29,000
the loss of color in someone's face,

127
0:06:30.28,000 --> 0:06:33,000
is a timer running down on the chances of this person surviving.

128
0:06:35.36,000 --> 0:06:36,000
But luckily for this man,

129
0:06:36.76,000 --> 0:06:37,000
the ambulance arrived

130
0:06:38.2,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and he received a dose of naloxone through injection.

131
0:06:42.6,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And I remember he jolted like he was electrocuted,

132
0:06:45.85,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and he pulled the needle out,

133
0:06:47.316,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and he told the paramedics to back off.

134
0:06:50.4,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And then he stood up, and he walked out.

135
0:06:54.08,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And we --

136
0:06:55.32,000 --> 0:06:56,000
we went back to work

137
0:06:56.96,000 --> 0:06:59,000
because people were still asking for time on the computers,

138
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
kids still needed help with their homework

139
0:07:02.36,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and this was our job --

140
0:07:03.6,000 --> 0:07:04,000
our purpose.

141
0:07:07.04,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I think that incident stays with me because of the waiting.

142
0:07:11.68,000 --> 0:07:12,000
It made me feel helpless.

143
0:07:13.88,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And it was that feeling of helplessness that reminded me so well of my childhood.

144
0:07:18.56,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Before I was born, both of my parents began using heroin.

145
0:07:22.64,000 --> 0:07:24,000
It made our lives chaotic and unstable:

146
0:07:24.88,000 --> 0:07:26,000
promises being made and constantly broken,

147
0:07:27.36,000 --> 0:07:29,000
their fighting, the weight of their secret --

148
0:07:29.6,000 --> 0:07:33,000
the weight of our secret kept so much so-called "normal" out of our lives.

149
0:07:35.76,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Every time we'd be dropped off at our grandparent's house,

150
0:07:38.52,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I'd be stuck on the thought that I was never going to see them again.

151
0:07:41.8,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Every time we'd be left in a car, at a house, at a store,

152
0:07:45.4,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I'd cry.

153
0:07:47,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And every time I saw those El tracks --

154
0:07:49.6,000 --> 0:07:52,000
the same ones I take to work now to McPherson --

155
0:07:52.84,000 --> 0:07:53,000
from the backseat of a car,

156
0:07:54.68,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I'd be angry,

157
0:07:56.2,000 --> 0:07:58,000
because even kids know

158
0:07:58.4,000 --> 0:08:,000
when their parents are trying to score drugs.

159
0:08:02.04,000 --> 0:08:05,000
There was so little I could do to control what was going on around me,

160
0:08:06.76,000 --> 0:08:08,000
that that feeling of helplessness was overwhelming.

161
0:08:09.36,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I struggled in school, struggled to read,

162
0:08:12.24,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I was prone to anger and depression.

163
0:08:14.28,000 --> 0:08:16,000
When I was 11 years old, I started smoking,

164
0:08:16.64,000 --> 0:08:19,000
which shortly after led to my own experiences with drugs and alcohol.

165
0:08:21.28,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I convinced myself that my parents' past would be my future.

166
0:08:26.12,000 --> 0:08:28,000
But eventually both of my parents entered recovery

167
0:08:28.84,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and maintained recovery from opioid use.

168
0:08:31.04,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And their strength and their commitment

169
0:08:33.6,000 --> 0:08:36,000
provided support and stability for me and my siblings,

170
0:08:37.28,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and it was those personal experiences that brought me to McPherson.

171
0:08:41.8,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Choosing to be a librarian

172
0:08:43.48,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and choosing to be at McPherson

173
0:08:45.24,000 --> 0:08:47,000
was me letting go of that feeling of helplessness

174
0:08:48.039,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and finding ways to be supportive to others.

175
0:08:51.28,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And one way to provide support

176
0:08:53.36,000 --> 0:08:55,000
was learning how to administer Narcan.

177
0:08:56.64,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Public libraries respond to the needs of their communities,

178
0:09:00.28,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and not knowing how to utilize Narcan

179
0:09:02.36,000 --> 0:09:05,000
was a disservice to the needs of our community.

180
0:09:05.88,000 --> 0:09:06,000
We were on the frontlines

181
0:09:07.36,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and desperately needed access to this lifesaving tool.

182
0:09:11.4,000 --> 0:09:14,000
So finally in late February of 2017,

183
0:09:14.64,000 --> 0:09:16,000
after much advocating,

184
0:09:16.88,000 --> 0:09:19,000
we finally received training from Prevention Point Philadelphia

185
0:09:20.48,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and about a month of so later,

186
0:09:21.96,000 --> 0:09:23,000
I utilized Narcan for the first time to save someone's life.

187
0:09:25.56,000 --> 0:09:26,000
It was after school again,

188
0:09:26.84,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and Teddy came into the library

189
0:09:28.36,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and said someone was overdosing on a front bench.

190
0:09:30.92,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Someone on staff called 911 again,

191
0:09:32.6,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and I grabbed the Narcan kit.

192
0:09:34.36,000 --> 0:09:37,000
The woman was barely in her 20s and barely breathing.

193
0:09:38.04,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Her friend was frantically slapping her in the face

194
0:09:40.68,000 --> 0:09:41,000
in hopes of reviving her.

195
0:09:42.68,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I administered the Narcan nasally,

196
0:09:44.76,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and thankfully she came to.

197
0:09:46.8,000 --> 0:09:47,000
But before the ambulance arrived,

198
0:09:48.52,000 --> 0:09:49,000
she and her friend ran off.

199
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And when I finally turned around,

200
0:09:53.48,000 --> 0:09:54,000
I saw the kids --

201
0:09:55.32,000 --> 0:09:57,000
kids that come into the library on a daily basis,

202
0:09:57.84,000 --> 0:09:59,000
some that I have known for years --

203
0:10:00.48,000 --> 0:10:02,000
standing on the steps of the building.

204
0:10:02.72,000 --> 0:10:03,000
They saw everything.

205
0:10:04.36,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And they didn't seem like they were visibly upset or in shock,

206
0:10:08.6,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and so I walked into the building,

207
0:10:10.28,000 --> 0:10:12,000
right into our workroom, and I cried.

208
0:10:12.8,000 --> 0:10:14,000
I cried partly from the shock of what just happened

209
0:10:15.24,000 --> 0:10:17,000
because I never thought I'd be saving anybody's life ever,

210
0:10:19.04,000 --> 0:10:2,000
but I mostly cried because of the kids.

211
0:10:21.52,000 --> 0:10:22,000
This is their normal.

212
0:10:24,000 --> 0:10:25,000
This is the community's normal.

213
0:10:26.76,000 --> 0:10:29,000
This is a catastrophic normal,

214
0:10:29.88,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and in that moment,

215
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
I was forced to confront once again that this should never be normal,

216
0:10:34.92,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and as with my childhood,

217
0:10:36.52,000 --> 0:10:38,000
when you're in it, you just accept it.

218
0:10:39.96,000 --> 0:10:41,000
The opioid epidemic is not just about those living

219
0:10:42.96,000 --> 0:10:43,000
with opioid use disorder

220
0:10:44.68,000 --> 0:10:47,000
because the reach of the epidemic goes well beyond those living with this

221
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and their families.

222
0:10:49.44,000 --> 0:10:51,000
It impacts the entire community.

223
0:10:52.76,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Kensington was a community in crisis before this

224
0:10:56,000 --> 0:10:58,000
for reasons that are endemic and intertwined,

225
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and anyone familiar with the neighborhood can think of why:

226
0:11:02.08,000 --> 0:11:03,000
racial disparities,

227
0:11:03.52,000 --> 0:11:06,000
failure of local and federal government to properly fund schools,

228
0:11:08.08,000 --> 0:11:09,000
lack of economic opportunity.

229
0:11:10.44,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And what we're trying to do at McPherson

230
0:11:13.24,000 --> 0:11:17,000
is find ways to support this community out of crisis.

231
0:11:17.88,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And perhaps now, because of the epidemic,

232
0:11:20.12,000 --> 0:11:22,000
more people are paying attention to Kensington.

233
0:11:22.36,000 --> 0:11:24,000
But regardless of that,

234
0:11:24.44,000 --> 0:11:25,000
at McPherson,

235
0:11:25.68,000 --> 0:11:28,000
we will continue to do what we can with the resources we have

236
0:11:29.48,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and we will continue to provide whatever help we can

237
0:11:32.12,000 --> 0:11:34,000
in hopes of keeping our community safe and healthy

238
0:11:35.52,000 --> 0:11:38,000
because public libraries have always been more than just books.

239
0:11:40.36,000 --> 0:11:42,000
We are physical shelter,

240
0:11:42.44,000 --> 0:11:43,000
a classroom,

241
0:11:44.76,000 --> 0:11:45,000
a safe haven,

242
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
a lunch room,

243
0:11:47.88,000 --> 0:11:48,000
a resource hub

244
0:11:49.88,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and yes,

245
0:11:51.12,000 --> 0:11:52,000
even a lifeline.

246
0:11:52.48,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Thank you.

247
0:11:53.72,000 --> 0:11:56,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.755,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm excited to be here to speak about vets,

2
0:00:15.046,000 --> 0:00:16,000
because I didn't join the Army

3
0:00:16.652,000 --> 0:00:18,000
because I wanted to go to war.

4
0:00:18.8,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I didn't join the Army because I had a lust

5
0:00:21.518,000 --> 0:00:24,000
or a need to go overseas and fight.

6
0:00:25.175,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Frankly, I joined the Army because

7
0:00:27.515,000 --> 0:00:28,000
college is really damn expensive,

8
0:00:29.242,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and they were going to help with that,

9
0:00:30.951,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and I joined the Army because

10
0:00:33.291,000 --> 0:00:35,000
it was what I knew,

11
0:00:35.447,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and it was what I knew that I thought I could do well.

12
0:00:38.309,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I didn't come from a military family.

13
0:00:40.707,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I'm not a military brat.

14
0:00:41.95,000 --> 0:00:43,000
No one in my family ever had joined the military at all,

15
0:00:44.729,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and how I first got introduced to the military

16
0:00:47.015,000 --> 0:00:49,000
was when I was 13 years old

17
0:00:49.11,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and I got sent away to military school,

18
0:00:51.789,000 --> 0:00:52,000
because my mother had been threatening me

19
0:00:53.458,000 --> 0:00:56,000
with this idea of military school ever since I was eight years old.

20
0:00:56.564,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I had some issues when I was coming up,

21
0:00:59.631,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and my mother would always tell me, she's like,

22
0:01:01.659,000 --> 0:01:02,000
"You know, if you don't get this together,

23
0:01:03.105,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I'm going to send you to military school."

24
0:01:04.371,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And I'd look at her, and I'd say, "Mommy,

25
0:01:05.931,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I'll work harder."

26
0:01:07.863,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And then when I was nine years old,

27
0:01:09.347,000 --> 0:01:11,000
she started giving me brochures to show me she wasn't playing around,

28
0:01:11.575,000 --> 0:01:12,000
so I'd look at the brochures, and I'm like,

29
0:01:12.87,000 --> 0:01:14,000
"Okay, Mommy, I can see you're serious, and I'll work harder."

30
0:01:15.197,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And then when I was 10 and 11,

31
0:01:17.349,000 --> 0:01:2,000
my behavior just kept on getting worse.

32
0:01:20.503,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I was on academic and disciplinary probation

33
0:01:22.87,000 --> 0:01:25,000
before I hit double digits,

34
0:01:26.601,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and I first felt handcuffs on my wrists

35
0:01:29.543,000 --> 0:01:3,000
when I was 11 years old.

36
0:01:31.491,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And so when I was 13 years old,

37
0:01:33.107,000 --> 0:01:35,000
my mother came up to me, and she was like,

38
0:01:35.121,000 --> 0:01:36,000
"I'm not going to do this anymore.

39
0:01:36.857,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I'm going to send you to military school."

40
0:01:38.403,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And I looked at her, and I said, "Mommy,

41
0:01:40.241,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I can see you're upset, and I'm going to work harder."

42
0:01:43.381,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And she was like, "No, you're going next week."

43
0:01:45.476,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And that was how I first got introduced

44
0:01:47.881,000 --> 0:01:49,000
to this whole idea of the military,

45
0:01:50.471,000 --> 0:01:52,000
because she thought this was a good idea.

46
0:01:53.367,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I had to disagree with her wholeheartedly

47
0:01:55.179,000 --> 0:01:56,000
when I first showed up there,

48
0:01:56.479,000 --> 0:01:57,000
because literally in the first four days,

49
0:01:58.279,000 --> 0:02:,000
I had already run away five times from this school.

50
0:02:00.447,000 --> 0:02:01,000
They had these big black gates that surrounded the school,

51
0:02:02.333,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and every time they would turn their backs,

52
0:02:04.423,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I would just simply run out of the black gates

53
0:02:06.879,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and take them up on their offer that if we don't want to be there,

54
0:02:08.741,000 --> 0:02:09,000
we can leave at any time.

55
0:02:10.171,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So I just said, "Well, if that's the case,

56
0:02:11.864,000 --> 0:02:14,000
then I'd like to leave." (Laughter)

57
0:02:15.112,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And it never worked.

58
0:02:17.223,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And I kept on getting lost.

59
0:02:19.397,000 --> 0:02:2,000
But then eventually,

60
0:02:20.579,000 --> 0:02:22,000
after staying there for a little while,

61
0:02:23.109,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and after the end of that first year

62
0:02:24.511,000 --> 0:02:25,000
at this military school,

63
0:02:26.359,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I realized that I actually was growing up.

64
0:02:31.015,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I realized the things that I enjoyed about this school

65
0:02:34.539,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and the thing that I enjoyed about the structure

66
0:02:36.887,000 --> 0:02:38,000
was something that I'd never found before:

67
0:02:39.634,000 --> 0:02:41,000
the fact that I finally felt like I was part of something bigger,

68
0:02:42.503,000 --> 0:02:44,000
part of a team, and it actually mattered to people

69
0:02:44.953,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that I was there,

70
0:02:46.665,000 --> 0:02:49,000
the fact that leadership wasn't just a punchline there,

71
0:02:49.855,000 --> 0:02:52,000
but that it was a real, actually core part

72
0:02:53.131,000 --> 0:02:55,000
of the entire experience.

73
0:02:55.28,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And so when it was time for me to actually

74
0:02:57.404,000 --> 0:02:59,000
finish up high school,

75
0:02:59.448,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I started thinking about what I wanted to do,

76
0:03:02.116,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and just like probably most students,

77
0:03:03.92,000 --> 0:03:06,000
had no idea what that meant or what I wanted to do.

78
0:03:07.314,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And I thought about the people who I

79
0:03:09.009,000 --> 0:03:11,000
respected and admired.

80
0:03:11.298,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I thought about a lot of the people,

81
0:03:12.984,000 --> 0:03:14,000
in particular a lot of the men, in my life

82
0:03:15.803,000 --> 0:03:16,000
who I looked up to.

83
0:03:17.732,000 --> 0:03:18,000
They all happened to wear the uniform

84
0:03:19.607,000 --> 0:03:2,000
of the United States of America,

85
0:03:21.546,000 --> 0:03:23,000
so for me, the question and the answer

86
0:03:23.791,000 --> 0:03:25,000
really became pretty easy.

87
0:03:25.858,000 --> 0:03:26,000
The question of what I wanted to do

88
0:03:27.606,000 --> 0:03:28,000
was filled in very quickly with saying,

89
0:03:29.244,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I guess I'll be an Army officer.

90
0:03:32.443,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So the Army then went through this process

91
0:03:34.267,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and they trained me up,

92
0:03:35.468,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and when I say I didn't join the Army

93
0:03:36.87,000 --> 0:03:37,000
because I wanted to go to war,

94
0:03:38.5,000 --> 0:03:4,000
the truth is, I joined in 1996.

95
0:03:40.583,000 --> 0:03:42,000
There really wasn't a whole lot going on.

96
0:03:43.353,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I didn't ever feel like I was in danger.

97
0:03:45.419,000 --> 0:03:46,000
When I went to my mom,

98
0:03:46.542,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I first joined the Army when I was 17 years old,

99
0:03:48.155,000 --> 0:03:49,000
so I literally needed parental permission

100
0:03:49.864,000 --> 0:03:5,000
to join the Army,

101
0:03:50.947,000 --> 0:03:51,000
so I kind of gave the paperwork to my mom,

102
0:03:52.427,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and she just assumed it was kind of like military school.

103
0:03:54.42,000 --> 0:03:55,000
She was like, "Well, it was good for him before,

104
0:03:55.724,000 --> 0:03:57,000
so I guess I'll just let him keep doing it,"

105
0:03:58.107,000 --> 0:04:,000
having no idea that the paperwork that she was signing

106
0:04:00.908,000 --> 0:04:02,000
was actually signing her son up

107
0:04:02.94,000 --> 0:04:05,000
to become an Army officer.

108
0:04:06.138,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And I went through the process,

109
0:04:07.912,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and again the whole time still just thinking,

110
0:04:09.706,000 --> 0:04:12,000
this is great, maybe I'll serve on a weekend,

111
0:04:13.529,000 --> 0:04:18,000
or two weeks during the year, do drill,

112
0:04:18.643,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and then a couple years after I signed up,

113
0:04:21.359,000 --> 0:04:23,000
a couple years after my mother signed those papers,

114
0:04:23.945,000 --> 0:04:26,000
the whole world changed.

115
0:04:27.671,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And after 9/11, there was an entirely new context

116
0:04:30.875,000 --> 0:04:33,000
about the occupation that I chose.

117
0:04:34.865,000 --> 0:04:38,000
When I first joined, I never joined to fight,

118
0:04:39.43,000 --> 0:04:4,000
but now that I was in,

119
0:04:41.1,000 --> 0:04:44,000
this is exactly what was now going to happen.

120
0:04:44.887,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And I thought about so much about the soldiers

121
0:04:48.234,000 --> 0:04:49,000
who I eventually had to end up leading.

122
0:04:50.091,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I remember when we first, right after 9/11,

123
0:04:52.601,000 --> 0:04:54,000
three weeks after 9/11, I was on a plane heading overseas,

124
0:04:55.224,000 --> 0:04:56,000
but I wasn't heading overseas with the military,

125
0:04:57.21,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I was heading overseas because I got a scholarship

126
0:04:59.245,000 --> 0:05:,000
to go overseas.

127
0:05:00.566,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I received the scholarship to go overseas

128
0:05:02.416,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and to go study and live overseas,

129
0:05:04.716,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and I was living in England and that was interesting,

130
0:05:06.788,000 --> 0:05:07,000
but at the same time, the same people who

131
0:05:08.254,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I was training with,

132
0:05:10.998,000 --> 0:05:12,000
the same soldiers that I went through all my training with,

133
0:05:13.411,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and we prepared for war,

134
0:05:15.6,000 --> 0:05:18,000
they were now actually heading over to it.

135
0:05:19.086,000 --> 0:05:2,000
They were now about to find themselves

136
0:05:20.967,000 --> 0:05:22,000
in the middle of places the fact is

137
0:05:23.151,000 --> 0:05:24,000
the vast majority of people,

138
0:05:24.719,000 --> 0:05:26,000
the vast majority of us as we were training,

139
0:05:26.985,000 --> 0:05:29,000
couldn't even point out on a map.

140
0:05:30.924,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I spent a couple years finishing graduate school,

141
0:05:32.69,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and the whole entire time while I'm sitting there

142
0:05:34.95,000 --> 0:05:35,000
in buildings at Oxford

143
0:05:36.536,000 --> 0:05:38,000
that were literally built hundreds of years

144
0:05:38.91,000 --> 0:05:39,000
before the United States was even founded,

145
0:05:40.758,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and I'm sitting there talking to dons

146
0:05:43.93,000 --> 0:05:46,000
about the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand,

147
0:05:47.894,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and how that influenced the start of World War I,

148
0:05:52.216,000 --> 0:05:54,000
where the entire time my heart and my head

149
0:05:54.46,000 --> 0:05:56,000
were on my soldiers

150
0:05:57.344,000 --> 0:05:58,000
who were now throwing on Kevlars

151
0:05:59.314,000 --> 0:06:,000
and grabbing their flak vests

152
0:06:00.75,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and figuring out how exactly do I change around

153
0:06:03.298,000 --> 0:06:05,000
or how exactly do I clean a machine gun

154
0:06:05.59,000 --> 0:06:08,000
in the darkness.

155
0:06:08.638,000 --> 0:06:1,000
That was the new reality.

156
0:06:11.571,000 --> 0:06:13,000
By the time I finished that up and I rejoined

157
0:06:13.944,000 --> 0:06:15,000
my military unit and we were getting ready to deploy to Afghanistan,

158
0:06:16.634,000 --> 0:06:17,000
there were soldiers in my unit who were now

159
0:06:18.222,000 --> 0:06:2,000
on their second and third deployments

160
0:06:20.32,000 --> 0:06:21,000
before I even had my first.

161
0:06:21.74,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I remember walking out with my unit for the first time,

162
0:06:23.728,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and when you join the Army

163
0:06:25.092,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and you go through a combat tour,

164
0:06:26.748,000 --> 0:06:27,000
everyone looks at your shoulder,

165
0:06:28.082,000 --> 0:06:31,000
because on your shoulder is your combat patch.

166
0:06:31.86,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And so immediately as you meet people,

167
0:06:33.136,000 --> 0:06:34,000
you shake their hand,

168
0:06:34.552,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and then your eyes go to their shoulder,

169
0:06:36.411,000 --> 0:06:37,000
because you want to see where did they serve,

170
0:06:38.024,000 --> 0:06:39,000
or what unit did they serve with?

171
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And I was the only person walking around

172
0:06:41.024,000 --> 0:06:43,000
with a bare shoulder,

173
0:06:43.314,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and it burned every time someone stared at it.

174
0:06:47.404,000 --> 0:06:5,000
But you get a chance to talk to your soldiers,

175
0:06:50.412,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and you ask them why did they sign up.

176
0:06:54.19,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I signed up because college was expensive.

177
0:06:58.279,000 --> 0:07:02,000
A lot of my soldiers signed up for completely different reasons.

178
0:07:02.7,000 --> 0:07:03,000
They signed up because of a sense of obligation.

179
0:07:04.632,000 --> 0:07:05,000
They signed up because they were angry

180
0:07:06.441,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and they wanted to do something about it.

181
0:07:08.258,000 --> 0:07:09,000
They signed up because

182
0:07:09.57,000 --> 0:07:1,000
their family said this was important.

183
0:07:11.416,000 --> 0:07:13,000
They signed up because they wanted some form of revenge.

184
0:07:13.628,000 --> 0:07:17,000
They signed for a whole collection of different reasons.

185
0:07:18.276,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And now we all found ourselves overseas

186
0:07:21.044,000 --> 0:07:24,000
fighting in these conflicts.

187
0:07:24.945,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And what was amazing to me was that I

188
0:07:27.456,000 --> 0:07:31,000
very naively started hearing this statement

189
0:07:31.778,000 --> 0:07:34,000
that I never fully understood,

190
0:07:35.044,000 --> 0:07:37,000
because right after 9/11, you start hearing this idea

191
0:07:37.402,000 --> 0:07:38,000
where people come up to you and they say,

192
0:07:38.759,000 --> 0:07:4,000
"Well, thank you for your service."

193
0:07:41.396,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And I just kind of followed in and started saying

194
0:07:43.359,000 --> 0:07:44,000
the same things to all my soldiers.

195
0:07:44.994,000 --> 0:07:45,000
This is even before I deployed.

196
0:07:46.575,000 --> 0:07:49,000
But I really had no idea what that even meant.

197
0:07:50.07,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I just said it because it sounded right.

198
0:07:52.074,000 --> 0:07:53,000
I said it because it sounded like the right thing to say

199
0:07:53.85,000 --> 0:07:54,000
to people who had served overseas.

200
0:07:55.494,000 --> 0:07:57,000
"Thank you for your service."

201
0:07:57.924,000 --> 0:07:59,000
But I had no idea what the context was

202
0:07:59.94,000 --> 0:08:01,000
or what that even,

203
0:08:02.27,000 --> 0:08:05,000
what it even meant to the people who heard it.

204
0:08:05.84,000 --> 0:08:09,000
When I first came back from Afghanistan,

205
0:08:10.626,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I thought that if you make it back from conflict,

206
0:08:14.1,000 --> 0:08:17,000
then the dangers were all over.

207
0:08:17.941,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I thought that if you made it back from a conflict zone

208
0:08:20.138,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that somehow you could kind of

209
0:08:22.437,000 --> 0:08:23,000
wipe the sweat off your brow and say,

210
0:08:23.671,000 --> 0:08:26,000
"Whew, I'm glad I dodged that one,"

211
0:08:27.415,000 --> 0:08:28,000
without understanding that for so many people,

212
0:08:29.223,000 --> 0:08:31,000
as they come back home,

213
0:08:31.366,000 --> 0:08:33,000
the war keeps going.

214
0:08:33.665,000 --> 0:08:35,000
It keeps playing out in all of our minds.

215
0:08:35.919,000 --> 0:08:37,000
It plays out in all of our memories.

216
0:08:38.557,000 --> 0:08:42,000
It plays out in all of our emotions.

217
0:08:43.22,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Please forgive us

218
0:08:44.557,000 --> 0:08:49,000
if we don't like being in big crowds.

219
0:08:49.767,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Please forgive us

220
0:08:52.03,000 --> 0:08:54,000
when we spend one week in a place

221
0:08:54.354,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that has 100 percent light discipline,

222
0:08:56.702,000 --> 0:08:58,000
because you're not allowed to walk around with white lights,

223
0:08:58.93,000 --> 0:08:59,000
because if anything has a white light,

224
0:09:00.417,000 --> 0:09:01,000
it can be seen from miles away,

225
0:09:01.894,000 --> 0:09:02,000
versus if you use little green

226
0:09:03.607,000 --> 0:09:04,000
or little blue lights,

227
0:09:04.774,000 --> 0:09:05,000
they cannot be seen from far away.

228
0:09:06.706,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So please forgive us if out of nowhere,

229
0:09:08.839,000 --> 0:09:11,000
we go from having 100 percent light discipline

230
0:09:12.046,000 --> 0:09:14,000
to then a week later being back in the middle of Times Square,

231
0:09:14.599,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and we have a difficult time adjusting to that.

232
0:09:19.73,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Please forgive us

233
0:09:21.162,000 --> 0:09:22,000
when you transition back to a family

234
0:09:23.001,000 --> 0:09:27,000
who has completely been maneuvering without you,

235
0:09:27.105,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and now when you come back, it's not that easy

236
0:09:29.132,000 --> 0:09:32,000
to fall back into a sense of normality,

237
0:09:32.776,000 --> 0:09:36,000
because the whole normal has changed.

238
0:09:37.258,000 --> 0:09:4,000
I remember when I came back, I wanted to talk to people.

239
0:09:40.82,000 --> 0:09:42,000
I wanted people to ask me about my experiences.

240
0:09:43.579,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I wanted people to come up to me and tell me,

241
0:09:45.327,000 --> 0:09:46,000
"What did you do?"

242
0:09:46.642,000 --> 0:09:47,000
I wanted people to come up to me and tell me,

243
0:09:48.129,000 --> 0:09:49,000
"What was it like? What was the food like?

244
0:09:49.747,000 --> 0:09:53,000
What was the experience like? How are you doing?"

245
0:09:54.272,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And the only questions I got from people was,

246
0:09:56.333,000 --> 0:09:58,000
"Did you shoot anybody?"

247
0:09:59.064,000 --> 0:10:,000
And those were the ones who were even curious

248
0:10:00.89,000 --> 0:10:03,000
enough to say anything.

249
0:10:04.548,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Because sometimes there's this fear

250
0:10:06.218,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and there's this apprehension that if I say anything,

251
0:10:07.783,000 --> 0:10:08,000
I'm afraid I'll offend,

252
0:10:09.259,000 --> 0:10:1,000
or I'm afraid I'll trigger something,

253
0:10:10.633,000 --> 0:10:14,000
so the common default is just saying nothing.

254
0:10:15.291,000 --> 0:10:17,000
The problem with that

255
0:10:17.89,000 --> 0:10:18,000
is then it feels like your service

256
0:10:19.496,000 --> 0:10:21,000
was not even acknowledged,

257
0:10:22.01,000 --> 0:10:25,000
like no one even cared.

258
0:10:25.017,000 --> 0:10:28,000
"Thank you for your service,"

259
0:10:28.04,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and we move on.

260
0:10:31.133,000 --> 0:10:33,000
What I wanted to better understand

261
0:10:33.809,000 --> 0:10:36,000
was what's behind that,

262
0:10:37.123,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and why "thank you for your service" isn't enough.

263
0:10:42.875,000 --> 0:10:45,000
The fact is, we have literally

264
0:10:46.491,000 --> 0:10:48,000
2.6 million men and women

265
0:10:49.048,000 --> 0:10:51,000
who are veterans of Iraq or Afghanistan

266
0:10:51.972,000 --> 0:10:53,000
who are all amongst us.

267
0:10:54.642,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Sometimes we know who they are,

268
0:10:56.122,000 --> 0:10:59,000
sometimes we don't,

269
0:10:59.234,000 --> 0:11:01,000
but there is that feeling, the shared experience,

270
0:11:01.401,000 --> 0:11:03,000
the shared bond

271
0:11:04.325,000 --> 0:11:05,000
where we know that that experience

272
0:11:06.197,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and that chapter of our life,

273
0:11:08.206,000 --> 0:11:1,000
while it might be closed,

274
0:11:10.921,000 --> 0:11:14,000
it's still not over.

275
0:11:14.967,000 --> 0:11:15,000
We think about "thank you for your service,"

276
0:11:16.596,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and people say, "So what does 'thank you for your service' mean to you?"

277
0:11:18.665,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Well, "Thank you for your service" means to me,

278
0:11:20.345,000 --> 0:11:24,000
it means acknowledging our stories,

279
0:11:24.423,000 --> 0:11:26,000
asking us who we are,

280
0:11:27.289,000 --> 0:11:29,000
understanding the strength

281
0:11:29.702,000 --> 0:11:33,000
that so many people, so many people who we serve with, have,

282
0:11:33.932,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and why that service means so much.

283
0:11:37.652,000 --> 0:11:39,000
"Thank you for your service" means acknowledging the fact

284
0:11:39.786,000 --> 0:11:4,000
that just because we've now come home

285
0:11:41.604,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and we've taken off the uniform

286
0:11:42.895,000 --> 0:11:44,000
does not mean our larger service to this country

287
0:11:45.175,000 --> 0:11:47,000
is somehow over.

288
0:11:47.851,000 --> 0:11:49,000
The fact is, there's still a tremendous amount

289
0:11:50.732,000 --> 0:11:54,000
that can be offered and can be given.

290
0:11:54.922,000 --> 0:11:55,000
When I look at people

291
0:11:56.352,000 --> 0:12:,000
like our friend Taylor Urruela,

292
0:12:01.01,000 --> 0:12:02,000
who in Iraq loses his leg,

293
0:12:02.754,000 --> 0:12:04,000
had two big dreams in his life.

294
0:12:05.412,000 --> 0:12:08,000
One was to be a soldier. The other was to be a baseball player.

295
0:12:08.48,000 --> 0:12:12,000
He loses his leg in Iraq.

296
0:12:13.28,000 --> 0:12:14,000
He comes back

297
0:12:14.904,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and instead of deciding that,

298
0:12:16.598,000 --> 0:12:18,000
well, now since I've lost my leg, that second dream is over,

299
0:12:19.016,000 --> 0:12:21,000
he decides that he still has that dream of playing baseball,

300
0:12:21.43,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and he starts this group called VETSports,

301
0:12:23.402,000 --> 0:12:24,000
which now works with veterans all over the country

302
0:12:25.313,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and uses sports as a way of healing.

303
0:12:30.648,000 --> 0:12:32,000
People like Tammy Duckworth,

304
0:12:32.991,000 --> 0:12:33,000
who was a helicopter pilot

305
0:12:34.239,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and with the helicopter that she was flying,

306
0:12:36.105,000 --> 0:12:37,000
you need to use both your hands

307
0:12:37.644,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and also your legs to steer,

308
0:12:39.175,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and her helicopter gets hit,

309
0:12:40.644,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and she's trying to steer the chopper,

310
0:12:41.906,000 --> 0:12:42,000
but the chopper's not reacting

311
0:12:43.823,000 --> 0:12:44,000
to her instructions and to her commands.

312
0:12:45.504,000 --> 0:12:47,000
She's trying to land the chopper safely,

313
0:12:48.015,000 --> 0:12:49,000
but the chopper doesn't land safely,

314
0:12:49.656,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and the reason it's not landing safely

315
0:12:50.768,000 --> 0:12:52,000
is because it's not responding to the commands that her legs are giving

316
0:12:53.441,000 --> 0:12:57,000
because her legs were blown off.

317
0:12:58.289,000 --> 0:13:,000
She barely survives.

318
0:13:01.194,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Medics come and they save her life,

319
0:13:05.1,000 --> 0:13:07,000
but then as she's doing her recuperation back at home,

320
0:13:07.561,000 --> 0:13:11,000
she realizes that, "My job's still not done."

321
0:13:11.871,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And now she uses her voice

322
0:13:13.355,000 --> 0:13:15,000
as a Congresswoman from Illinois

323
0:13:15.547,000 --> 0:13:17,000
to fight and advocate for a collection of issues

324
0:13:18.505,000 --> 0:13:21,000
to include veterans issues.

325
0:13:22.37,000 --> 0:13:24,000
We signed up because

326
0:13:25.096,000 --> 0:13:29,000
we love this country we represent.

327
0:13:29.566,000 --> 0:13:31,000
We signed up because

328
0:13:31.91,000 --> 0:13:33,000
we believe in the idea and we believe in the people

329
0:13:34.468,000 --> 0:13:36,000
to our left and to our right.

330
0:13:37.256,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And the only thing we then ask is that

331
0:13:39.168,000 --> 0:13:41,000
"thank you for your service"

332
0:13:41.43,000 --> 0:13:44,000
needs to be more than just a quote break,

333
0:13:44.554,000 --> 0:13:46,000
that "thank you for your service" means

334
0:13:47.18,000 --> 0:13:49,000
honestly digging in

335
0:13:49.406,000 --> 0:13:51,000
to the people who have stepped up

336
0:13:52.356,000 --> 0:13:55,000
simply because they were asked to,

337
0:13:56.199,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and what that means for us not just now,

338
0:13:58.228,000 --> 0:14:01,000
not just during combat operations,

339
0:14:01.72,000 --> 0:14:04,000
but long after the last vehicle has left

340
0:14:05.069,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and after the last shot has been taken.

341
0:14:09.943,000 --> 0:14:11,000
These are the people who I served with,

342
0:14:12.773,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and these are the people who I honor.

343
0:14:16.477,000 --> 0:14:18,000
So thank you for your service.

344
0:14:18.648,000 --> 0:14:21,000
(Applause)

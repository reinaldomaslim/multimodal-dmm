1
0:00:13.11,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I want you to touch your face.

2
0:00:15.406,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Go on.

3
0:00:17.406,000 --> 0:00:18,000
What do you feel?

4
0:00:18.833,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Soft? Squishy?

5
0:00:21.313,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It's you, right? You're feeling you?

6
0:00:24.929,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Well, it's not quite true.

7
0:00:27.207,000 --> 0:00:3,000
You're actually feeling thousands of microscopic creatures

8
0:00:30.476,000 --> 0:00:32,000
that live on our face and fingers.

9
0:00:34.301,000 --> 0:00:35,000
You're feeling some of the fungi

10
0:00:36.047,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that drifted down from the air ducts today.

11
0:00:38.951,000 --> 0:00:39,000
They set off our allergies

12
0:00:40.942,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and smell of mildew.

13
0:00:43.865,000 --> 0:00:47,000
You're feeling some of the 100 billion bacterial cells

14
0:00:48.033,000 --> 0:00:49,000
that live on our skin.

15
0:00:50.273,000 --> 0:00:53,000
They've been munching away at your skin oils and replicating,

16
0:00:54.203,000 --> 0:00:56,000
producing the smells of body odor.

17
0:00:57.384,000 --> 0:00:59,000
You're likely even touching the fecal bacteria

18
0:01:00.323,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that sprayed onto you the last time you flushed a toilet,

19
0:01:04.007,000 --> 0:01:07,000
or those bacteria that live in our water pipes

20
0:01:07.155,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and sprayed onto you with your last shower.

21
0:01:10.486,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Sorry.

22
0:01:11.661,000 --> 0:01:12,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:13.153,000 --> 0:01:16,000
You're probably even giving a microscopic high five

24
0:01:16.741,000 --> 0:01:19,000
to the two species of mites that live on our faces,

25
0:01:20.49,000 --> 0:01:21,000
on all of our faces.

26
0:01:22.697,000 --> 0:01:24,000
They've spent the night squirming across your face

27
0:01:25.367,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and having sex on the bridge of your nose.

28
0:01:28.239,000 --> 0:01:3,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:31.79,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Many of them are now leaking their gut contents onto your pores.

30
0:01:35.976,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:38.056,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Now look at your finger.

32
0:01:40.186,000 --> 0:01:42,000
How's it feel? Gross?

33
0:01:42.311,000 --> 0:01:44,000
In desperate need of soap or bleach?

34
0:01:46.192,000 --> 0:01:47,000
That's how you feel now,

35
0:01:47.83,000 --> 0:01:49,000
but it's not going to be how you feel in the future.

36
0:01:51.274,000 --> 0:01:52,000
For the last 100 years,

37
0:01:53.223,000 --> 0:01:54,000
we've had an adversarial relationship

38
0:01:55.224,000 --> 0:01:57,000
with the microscopic life nearest us.

39
0:01:57.863,000 --> 0:01:59,000
If I told you there was a bug in your house

40
0:02:00.009,000 --> 0:02:01,000
or bacteria in your sink,

41
0:02:01.267,000 --> 0:02:03,000
there was a human-devised solution for that,

42
0:02:03.618,000 --> 0:02:06,000
a product to eradicate, exterminate,

43
0:02:06.778,000 --> 0:02:07,000
disinfect.

44
0:02:08.663,000 --> 0:02:11,000
We strive to remove most of the microscopic life in our world now.

45
0:02:13.642,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But in doing so, we're ignoring the best source of new technology

46
0:02:18.359,000 --> 0:02:19,000
on this planet.

47
0:02:20.444,000 --> 0:02:25,000
The last 100 years have featured human solutions to microbial problems,

48
0:02:26.114,000 --> 0:02:31,000
but the next 100 years will feature microbial solutions to human problems.

49
0:02:32.331,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I'm a scientist, and I work with researchers

50
0:02:34.724,000 --> 0:02:37,000
at North Carolina State University and the University of Colorado

51
0:02:38.024,000 --> 0:02:41,000
to uncover the microscopic life that is nearest us,

52
0:02:42.637,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and that's often in our most intimate and boring environments,

53
0:02:46.529,000 --> 0:02:49,000
be it under our couches, in our backyards,

54
0:02:49.711,000 --> 0:02:5,000
or in our belly buttons.

55
0:02:51.903,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I do this work because it turns out that we know very little

56
0:02:54.797,000 --> 0:02:56,000
about the microscopic life that's nearest us.

57
0:02:58.101,000 --> 0:03:,000
As of a few years ago, no scientist could tell you

58
0:03:00.598,000 --> 0:03:02,000
what bugs or microorganisms live in your home --

59
0:03:04.328,000 --> 0:03:07,000
your home, the place you know better than anywhere else.

60
0:03:08.427,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And so I and teams of others

61
0:03:10.191,000 --> 0:03:12,000
are armed with Q-tips and tweezers

62
0:03:12.408,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and advanced DNA techniques

63
0:03:14.298,000 --> 0:03:16,000
to uncover the microscopic life nearest us.

64
0:03:18.042,000 --> 0:03:22,000
In doing so, we found over 600 species of bugs

65
0:03:22.126,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that live in USA homes,

66
0:03:24.05,000 --> 0:03:26,000
everything from spiders and cockroaches

67
0:03:26.571,000 --> 0:03:28,000
to tiny mites that cling to feathers.

68
0:03:29.91,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And we found over 100,000 species of bacteria and fungi

69
0:03:35.259,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that live in our dust bunnies,

70
0:03:37.298,000 --> 0:03:4,000
thousands more that live on our clothes or in our showers.

71
0:03:42.146,000 --> 0:03:43,000
We've gone further still,

72
0:03:43.714,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and we looked at the microorganisms

73
0:03:45.454,000 --> 0:03:49,000
that live inside the bodies of each of those bugs in our home.

74
0:03:50.328,000 --> 0:03:53,000
In each bug, for example, a wasp,

75
0:03:53.762,000 --> 0:03:57,000
we see a microscopic jungle unfold in a petri plate,

76
0:03:57.996,000 --> 0:04:,000
a world of hundreds of vibrant species.

77
0:04:01.297,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Behold the biological cosmos!

78
0:04:05.351,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So many of the species you're looking at right now

79
0:04:07.804,000 --> 0:04:08,000
don't yet have names.

80
0:04:09.723,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Most of the life around us remains unknown.

81
0:04:13.65,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I remember the first time I discovered and got to name a new species.

82
0:04:17.177,000 --> 0:04:2,000
It was a fungus that lives in the nest of a paper wasp.

83
0:04:20.695,000 --> 0:04:22,000
It's white and fluffy,

84
0:04:22.944,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and I named it "mucor nidicola,"

85
0:04:25.512,000 --> 0:04:28,000
meaning in Latin that it lives in the nest of another.

86
0:04:29.772,000 --> 0:04:31,000
This is a picture of it growing on a dinosaur,

87
0:04:32.64,000 --> 0:04:35,000
because everyone thinks dinosaurs are cool.

88
0:04:36.506,000 --> 0:04:38,000
At the time, I was in graduate school,

89
0:04:38.846,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and I was so excited that I had found this new life form.

90
0:04:42.592,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I called up my dad, and I go,

91
0:04:44.392,000 --> 0:04:47,000
"Dad! I just discovered a new microorganism species."

92
0:04:48.394,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And he laughed and he goes,

93
0:04:49.919,000 --> 0:04:52,000
"That's great. I hope you also discovered a cure for it."

94
0:04:53.211,000 --> 0:04:54,000
(Laughter)

95
0:04:54.681,000 --> 0:04:55,000
"Cure it."

96
0:04:57.022,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Now, my dad is my biggest fan,

97
0:04:59.753,000 --> 0:05:03,000
so in that crushing moment where he wanted to kill my new little life form,

98
0:05:04.147,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I realized that actually I had failed him,

99
0:05:06.717,000 --> 0:05:08,000
both as a daughter and a scientist.

100
0:05:08.902,000 --> 0:05:11,000
In my years toiling away in labs and in people's backyards,

101
0:05:12.852,000 --> 0:05:15,000
investigating and cataloging the microscopic life around us,

102
0:05:16.556,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I'd never made clear my true mission to him.

103
0:05:20.264,000 --> 0:05:21,000
My goal is not to find technology

104
0:05:22.204,000 --> 0:05:24,000
to kill the new microscopic life around us.

105
0:05:25.135,000 --> 0:05:29,000
My goal is to find new technology from this life, that will help save us.

106
0:05:31.315,000 --> 0:05:36,000
The diversity of life in our homes is more than a list of 100,000 new species.

107
0:05:37.091,000 --> 0:05:4,000
It is 100,000 new sources of solutions to human problems.

108
0:05:42.268,000 --> 0:05:44,000
I know it's hard to believe that anything that's so small

109
0:05:44.993,000 --> 0:05:45,000
or only has one cell

110
0:05:46.175,000 --> 0:05:47,000
can do anything powerful,

111
0:05:47.518,000 --> 0:05:48,000
but they can.

112
0:05:48.879,000 --> 0:05:5,000
These creatures are microscopic alchemists,

113
0:05:51.748,000 --> 0:05:53,000
with the ability to transform their environment

114
0:05:54.63,000 --> 0:05:56,000
with an arsenal of chemical tools.

115
0:05:57.745,000 --> 0:05:59,000
This means that they can live anywhere on this planet,

116
0:06:00.752,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and they can eat whatever food is around them.

117
0:06:04.372,000 --> 0:06:08,000
This means they can eat everything from toxic waste to plastic,

118
0:06:09.895,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and they can produce waste products like oil and battery power

119
0:06:14.434,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and even tiny nuggets of real gold.

120
0:06:18.549,000 --> 0:06:21,000
They can transform the inedible into nutritive.

121
0:06:22.567,000 --> 0:06:24,000
They can make sugar into alcohol.

122
0:06:25.746,000 --> 0:06:26,000
They give chocolate its flavor,

123
0:06:27.683,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and soil the power to grow.

124
0:06:30.273,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I'm here to tell you

125
0:06:31.464,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that the next 100 years will feature these microscopic creatures

126
0:06:34.635,000 --> 0:06:35,000
solving more of our problems.

127
0:06:36.78,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And we have a lot of problems to choose from.

128
0:06:39.582,000 --> 0:06:42,000
We've got the mundane: bad-smelling clothes or bland food.

129
0:06:44.284,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And we've got the monumental:

130
0:06:46.345,000 --> 0:06:49,000
disease, pollution, war.

131
0:06:51.146,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And so this is my mission:

132
0:06:52.854,000 --> 0:06:55,000
to not just catalog the microscopic life around us,

133
0:06:56.108,000 --> 0:06:59,000
but to find out what it's uniquely well-suited to help us with.

134
0:07:00.501,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Here's an example.

135
0:07:01.89,000 --> 0:07:02,000
We started with a pest,

136
0:07:03.546,000 --> 0:07:05,000
a wasp that lives on many of our homes.

137
0:07:06.527,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Inside that wasp, we plucked out a little-known microorganism species

138
0:07:11.478,000 --> 0:07:12,000
with a unique ability:

139
0:07:13.595,000 --> 0:07:14,000
it could make beer.

140
0:07:15.706,000 --> 0:07:18,000
This is a trait that only a few species on this planet have.

141
0:07:19.255,000 --> 0:07:21,000
In fact, all commercially produced beer you've ever had

142
0:07:22.14,000 --> 0:07:25,000
likely came from one of only three microorganism species.

143
0:07:26.549,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Yet our species, it could make a beer that tasted like honey,

144
0:07:31.416,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and it could also make a delightfully tart beer.

145
0:07:34.863,000 --> 0:07:37,000
In fact, this microorganism species that lives in the belly of a wasp,

146
0:07:39.427,000 --> 0:07:41,000
it could make a valuable sour beer

147
0:07:41.748,000 --> 0:07:44,000
better than any other species on this planet.

148
0:07:46.496,000 --> 0:07:49,000
There are now four species that produce commercial beer.

149
0:07:51.017,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Where you used to see a pest,

150
0:07:53.356,000 --> 0:07:55,000
now think of tasting your future favorite beer.

151
0:07:57.745,000 --> 0:07:58,000
As a second example,

152
0:07:59.298,000 --> 0:08:02,000
I worked with researchers to dig in the dirt in people's backyards.

153
0:08:03.313,000 --> 0:08:07,000
There, we uncovered a microorganism that could make novel antibiotics,

154
0:08:07.394,000 --> 0:08:1,000
antibiotics that can kill the world's worst superbugs.

155
0:08:11.51,000 --> 0:08:14,000
This was an awesome thing to find,

156
0:08:14.743,000 --> 0:08:15,000
but here's the secret:

157
0:08:16.984,000 --> 0:08:17,000
for the last 60 years,

158
0:08:18.928,000 --> 0:08:2,000
most of the antibiotics on the market

159
0:08:21.241,000 --> 0:08:23,000
have come from similar soil bacteria.

160
0:08:24.089,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Every day, you and I and everyone in this room

161
0:08:27.138,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and on this planet,

162
0:08:28.904,000 --> 0:08:32,000
are saved by similar soil bacteria that produce most of our antibiotics.

163
0:08:35.045,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Where you used to see dirt,

164
0:08:36.742,000 --> 0:08:37,000
now think of medication.

165
0:08:40.222,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Perhaps my favorite example comes from colleagues

166
0:08:42.892,000 --> 0:08:44,000
who are studying a pond scum microorganism,

167
0:08:45.812,000 --> 0:08:48,000
which is tragically named after the cow dung it was first found in.

168
0:08:50.208,000 --> 0:08:53,000
It's pretty unremarkable and would be unworthy of discussion,

169
0:08:54.19,000 --> 0:08:57,000
except that the researchers found that if you feed it to mice,

170
0:08:57.736,000 --> 0:08:59,000
it vaccinates against PTSD.

171
0:09:01.662,000 --> 0:09:02,000
It vaccinates against fear.

172
0:09:05.238,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Where you used to see pond scum, now think of hope.

173
0:09:09.897,000 --> 0:09:11,000
There are so many more microbial examples

174
0:09:12.325,000 --> 0:09:14,000
that I don't have time to talk about today.

175
0:09:14.942,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I gave you examples of solutions that came from just three species,

176
0:09:20.35,000 --> 0:09:24,000
but imagine what those other 100,000 species in your dust bunnies

177
0:09:24.72,000 --> 0:09:25,000
might be able to do.

178
0:09:26.571,000 --> 0:09:29,000
In the future, they might be able to make you sexier

179
0:09:30.578,000 --> 0:09:31,000
or smarter

180
0:09:32.855,000 --> 0:09:33,000
or perhaps live longer.

181
0:09:36.303,000 --> 0:09:38,000
So I want you to look at your finger again.

182
0:09:39.005,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Think about all those microscopic creatures

183
0:09:41.315,000 --> 0:09:42,000
that are unknown.

184
0:09:42.786,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Think about in the future what they might be able to do

185
0:09:45.815,000 --> 0:09:46,000
or make

186
0:09:47.528,000 --> 0:09:49,000
or whose life they might be able to save.

187
0:09:50.891,000 --> 0:09:51,000
How does your finger feel right now?

188
0:09:53.322,000 --> 0:09:54,000
A little bit powerful?

189
0:09:56.384,000 --> 0:09:58,000
That's because you're feeling the future.

190
0:09:59.03,000 --> 0:10:,000
Thank you.

191
0:10:00.623,000 --> 0:10:04,000
(Applause)

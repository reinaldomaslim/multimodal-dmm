1
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
As a clergyman,

2
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
you can imagine how

3
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
out of place I feel.

4
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I feel like a fish out of water,

5
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
or maybe an owl out of the air.

6
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I was preaching in San Jose some time ago,

8
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and my friend Mark Kvamme,

9
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
who helped introduce me

10
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
to this conference,

11
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
brought several CEOs

12
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and leaders

13
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
of some of the companies here in the Silicon Valley

14
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
to have breakfast with me, or I with them.

15
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And I was so stimulated.

16
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And had such -- it was an

17
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
eye-opening experience

18
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to hear them talk about

19
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
the world that is yet to come

20
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
through technology

21
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and science.

22
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I know that we're near the end of this conference,

23
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and some of you may be wondering

24
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
why they have a speaker

25
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
from the field of religion.

26
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Richard can answer that,

27
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
because he made that decision.

28
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
But some years ago I was on an elevator in Philadelphia,

29
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
coming down.

30
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I was to address a conference

31
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
at a hotel.

32
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And on that elevator a man said,

33
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
"I hear Billy Graham is staying in this hotel."

34
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And another man looked in my direction and said,

35
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
"Yes, there he is. He's on this elevator with us."

36
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And this man looked me up and down

37
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
for about 10 seconds,

38
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and he said, "My, what an anticlimax!"

39
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I hope

41
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that you won't feel that these few moments with me

42
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
is not a -- is an anticlimax,

43
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
after all these tremendous

44
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
talks that you've heard,

45
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and addresses, which I intend to listen to every one of them.

46
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
But I was

47
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
on an airplane in the east some years ago,

48
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and the man sitting across the aisle from me

49
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
was the mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina.

50
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
His name was John Belk. Some of you will probably know him.

51
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And there was a drunk man on there,

52
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
and he got up out of his seat two or three times,

53
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and he was making everybody upset

54
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
by what he was trying to do.

55
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And he was slapping the stewardess

56
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and pinching her as she went by,

57
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and everybody was upset with him.

58
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And finally, John Belk said,

59
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
"Do you know who's sitting here?"

60
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And the man said, "No, who?"

61
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
He said, "It's Billy Graham,

62
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
the preacher."

63
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
He said, "You don't say!"

64
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And he turned to me, and he said, "Put her there!"

65
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
He said, "Your sermons have certainly helped me."

66
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
(Laughter)

67
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And I suppose that that's true

68
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
with thousands of people.

69
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I know that as you have been peering into the future,

71
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and as we've heard some of it here tonight,

72
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I would like to live in that age

73
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and see what is going to be.

74
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
But I won't,

75
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
because I'm 80 years old. This is my eightieth year,

76
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and I know that my time is brief.

77
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I have phlebitis at the moment, in both legs,

78
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and that's the reason that I had to have a little help in getting up here,

79
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
because I have Parkinson's disease

80
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
in addition to that,

81
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and some other problems that I won't talk about.

82
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
But this is not the first time

84
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that we've had a technological revolution.

85
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
We've had others.

86
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And there's one that I want to talk about.

87
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
In one generation,

88
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
the nation of the people of Israel

89
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
had a tremendous and dramatic change

90
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that made them a great power in the Near East.

91
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
A man by the name of David

92
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
came to the throne,

93
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and King David became one of the great leaders

94
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
of his generation.

95
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
He was a man of tremendous leadership.

96
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
He had the favor of God with him.

97
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
He was a brilliant poet,

98
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
philosopher, writer, soldier --

99
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
with strategies in battle and conflict

100
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that people study even today.

101
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
But about two centuries before David,

102
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
the Hittites

103
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
had discovered the secret

104
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
of smelting and processing of iron,

105
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and, slowly, that skill spread.

106
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
But they wouldn't allow the Israelis

107
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
to look into it, or to have any.

108
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
But David changed all of that,

109
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and he introduced the Iron Age

110
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
to Israel.

111
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And the Bible says that David laid up great stores of iron,

112
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
and which archaeologists have found,

113
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that in present-day Palestine,

114
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
there are evidences of that generation.

115
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Now, instead of crude tools

116
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
made of sticks and stones,

117
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Israel now had iron plows,

118
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and sickles, and hoes

119
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and military weapons.

120
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And in the course of one generation,

121
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Israel was completely changed.

122
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
The introduction of iron, in some ways,

123
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
had an impact

124
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
a little bit like the microchip

125
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
has had on our generation.

126
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And

127
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
David found

128
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
that there were many problems that technology could not solve.

129
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
There were many problems still left.

130
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And they're still with us, and you haven't solved them,

131
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
and I haven't heard anybody here speak to that.

132
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
How do we solve these three problems

133
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that I'd like to mention?

134
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
The first one that David saw

135
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
was human evil.

136
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Where does it come from?

137
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
How do we solve it?

138
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Over again and again

139
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
in the Psalms,

140
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
which Gladstone said was the greatest book in the world,

141
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
David describes the evils of the human race.

142
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And yet he says,

143
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
"He restores my soul."

144
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Have you ever thought about what a contradiction we are?

145
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
On one hand, we can probe the deepest secrets of the universe

146
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and dramatically push back the frontiers of technology,

147
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
as this conference vividly demonstrates.

148
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
We've seen under the sea,

149
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
three miles down,

150
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
or galaxies hundreds of billions of years

151
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
out in the future.

152
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
But on the other hand,

153
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
something is wrong.

154
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Our battleships,

155
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
our soldiers,

156
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
are on a frontier now,

157
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
almost ready to go to war

158
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
with Iraq.

159
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Now, what causes this?

160
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Why do we have these wars in every generation,

161
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and in every part of the world?

162
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And revolutions?

163
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
We can't get along with other people,

164
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
even in our own families.

165
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
We find ourselves in the paralyzing grip

166
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
of self-destructive habits we can't break.

167
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Racism and injustice and violence sweep our world,

168
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
bringing a tragic harvest of heartache and death.

169
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Even the most sophisticated among us

170
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
seem powerless to break this cycle.

171
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I would like to see Oracle

172
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
take up that,

173
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
or

174
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
some other

175
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
technological geniuses work on this.

176
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
How do we change man,

177
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
so that he doesn't lie and cheat,

178
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and our newspapers are not filled with stories

179
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
of fraud in business or labor

180
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
or athletics or wherever?

181
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
The Bible says the problem is within us,

182
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
within our hearts and our souls.

183
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Our problem is that we are separated

184
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
from our Creator,

185
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
which we call God,

186
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and we need to have our souls restored,

187
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
something only God can do.

188
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Jesus said, "For out of the heart

189
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
come evil thoughts:

190
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
murders, sexual immorality,

191
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
theft, false testimonies,

192
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
slander."

193
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
The British philosopher Bertrand Russell

194
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
was not a religious man,

195
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
but he said, "It's in our hearts that the evil lies,

196
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and it's from our hearts

197
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
that it must be plucked out."

198
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Albert Einstein --

199
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I was just talking to someone, when I was speaking at Princeton,

200
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and I met

201
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Mr. Einstein.

202
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
He didn't have a doctor's degree, because he said

203
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
nobody was qualified to give him one.

204
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
(Laughter)

205
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
But he made this statement.

206
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
He said, "It's easier to denature plutonium

207
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
than to denature the evil spirit of man."

208
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And many of you, I'm sure,

209
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
have thought about that

210
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and puzzled over it.

211
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
You've seen people

212
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
take beneficial technological advances,

213
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
such as the Internet we've heard about tonight,

214
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and twist them into something corrupting.

215
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
You've seen brilliant people devise computer viruses

216
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
that bring down whole systems.

217
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
The Oklahoma City bombing was simple technology,

218
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
horribly used.

219
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
The problem is not technology.

220
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
The problem is the person or persons using it.

221
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
King David said

222
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
that he knew the depths of his own soul.

223
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
He couldn't free himself from personal problems

224
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and personal evils

225
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
that included murder and adultery.

226
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Yet King David sought God's forgiveness,

227
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and said, "You can restore my soul."

228
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
You see, the Bible teaches

229
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
that we're more than a body and a mind.

230
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
We are a soul.

231
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And there's something inside of us

232
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
that is beyond our understanding.

233
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
That's the part of us that yearns

234
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
for God, or something more

235
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
than we find in technology.

236
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Your soul is that part of you that

237
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
yearns for meaning in life,

238
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and which seeks for something beyond this life.

239
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
It's the part of you that yearns, really, for God.

240
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
I find [that] young people all over the world

241
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
are searching for something.

242
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
They don't know what it is. I speak at many universities,

243
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and I have many questions and answer periods, and

244
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
whether it's Cambridge, or Harvard,

245
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
or Oxford --

246
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
I've spoken at all of those universities.

247
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
I'm going to Harvard in about three or four --

248
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
no, it's about two months from now --

249
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
to give a lecture.

250
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And I'll be asked the same questions that I was asked

251
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
the last few times I've been there.

252
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And it'll be on

253
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
these questions:

254
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
where did I come from? Why am I here? Where am I going?

255
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
What's life all about? Why am I here?

256
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Even if you have no religious belief,

257
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
there are times when you wonder that there's something else.

258
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Thomas Edison also said,

259
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
"When you see everything that happens in the world of science,

260
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and in the working of the universe,

261
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
you cannot deny that there's a captain on the bridge."

262
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
I remember once,

263
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
I sat beside Mrs. Gorbachev

264
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
at a White House dinner.

265
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
I went to Ambassador Dobrynin, whom I knew very well.

266
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And I'd been to Russia several times under the Communists,

267
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and they'd given me marvelous freedom that I didn't expect.

268
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And I knew Mr. Dobrynin very well,

269
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and I said,

270
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
"I'm going to sit beside Mrs. Gorbachev tonight.

271
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
What shall I talk to her about?"

272
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And he surprised me with the answer.

273
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
He said, "Talk to her about religion and philosophy.

274
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
That's what she's really interested in."

275
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
I was a little bit surprised, but that evening

276
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
that's what we talked about,

277
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and it was a stimulating conversation.

278
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And afterward, she said,

279
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
"You know, I'm an atheist,

280
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
but I know that there's something up there

281
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
higher than we are."

282
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
The second problem

283
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
that King David realized he could not solve

284
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
was the problem of human suffering.

285
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Writing the oldest book in the world was Job,

286
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and he said,

287
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
"Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward."

288
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Yes, to be sure, science has done much to push back

289
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
certain types of human suffering.

290
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
But I'm --

291
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
in a few months, I'll be 80 years of age.

292
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
I admit that I'm very grateful

293
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
for all the medical advances

294
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
that have kept me in relatively good health

295
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
all these years.

296
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
My doctors at the Mayo Clinic urged me

297
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
not to take this trip out here to this -- to be here.

298
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
I haven't given a talk in nearly four months.

299
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And when you speak as much as I do,

300
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
three or four times a day,

301
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
you get rusty.

302
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
That's the reason I'm using this podium

303
0:14:43.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and using these notes.

304
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Every time you ever hear me on the television or somewhere,

305
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
I'm ad-libbing.

306
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
I'm not reading. I never read an address.

307
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
I never read a speech or a talk or a lecture.

308
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
I talk ad lib.

309
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
But tonight, I've

310
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
got some notes here so that if

311
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
I begin to forget,

312
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
which I do sometimes,

313
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
I've got something I can turn to.

314
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
But even here among us,

315
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
most --

316
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
in the most advanced society in the world,

317
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
we have poverty.

318
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
We have families that self-destruct,

319
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
friends that betray us.

320
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Unbearable psychological pressures bear down on us.

321
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:36,000
I've never met a person in the world

322
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:38,000
that didn't have a problem

323
0:15:38.16,000 --> 0:15:4,000
or a worry.

324
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
Why do we suffer? It's an age-old question

325
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
that we haven't answered.

326
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Yet David again and again said

327
0:15:49.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
that he would turn to God.

328
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
He said, "The Lord is my shepherd."

329
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
The final problem that David knew he could not solve

330
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
was death.

331
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
Many commentators have said that death

332
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:08,000
is the forbidden subject of our generation.

333
0:16:08.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Most people live as if

334
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:13,000
they're never going to die.

335
0:16:13.16,000 --> 0:16:16,000
Technology projects the myth

336
0:16:16.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
of control over our mortality.

337
0:16:20.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
We see people on our screens.

338
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:24,000
Marilyn Monroe is just as beautiful on the screen

339
0:16:24.16,000 --> 0:16:26,000
as she was in person,

340
0:16:26.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and our -- many young people think she's still alive.

341
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
They don't know that she's dead.

342
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Or Clark Gable, or whoever it is.

343
0:16:34.16,000 --> 0:16:38,000
The old stars, they come to life.

344
0:16:38.16,000 --> 0:16:4,000
And they're --

345
0:16:41.16,000 --> 0:16:44,000
they're just as great on that screen as they were in person.

346
0:16:46.16,000 --> 0:16:48,000
But death is inevitable.

347
0:16:48.16,000 --> 0:16:51,000
I spoke some time ago to

348
0:16:51.16,000 --> 0:16:54,000
a joint session of Congress, last year.

349
0:16:55.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
And we were meeting in that room,

350
0:16:58.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
the statue room.

351
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:02,000
About 300 of them were there.

352
0:17:03.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
And I said, "There's one thing that we have in common in this room,

353
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:09,000
all of us together, whether Republican or Democrat,

354
0:17:10.16,000 --> 0:17:12,000
or whoever."

355
0:17:12.16,000 --> 0:17:14,000
I said, "We're all going to die.

356
0:17:14.16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
And we have that in common with all these great men of the past

357
0:17:17.16,000 --> 0:17:2,000
that are staring down at us."

358
0:17:21.16,000 --> 0:17:23,000
And it's often difficult for young people

359
0:17:23.16,000 --> 0:17:25,000
to understand that.

360
0:17:26.16,000 --> 0:17:29,000
It's difficult for them to understand that they're going to die.

361
0:17:30.16,000 --> 0:17:34,000
As the ancient writer of Ecclesiastes wrote,

362
0:17:34.16,000 --> 0:17:37,000
he said, there's every activity under heaven.

363
0:17:38.16,000 --> 0:17:41,000
There's a time to be born,

364
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:43,000
and there's a time to die.

365
0:17:43.16,000 --> 0:17:46,000
I've stood at the deathbed

366
0:17:46.16,000 --> 0:17:48,000
of several famous people,

367
0:17:48.16,000 --> 0:17:5,000
whom you would know.

368
0:17:50.16,000 --> 0:17:52,000
I've talked to them.

369
0:17:52.16,000 --> 0:17:54,000
I've seen them in those agonizing moments

370
0:17:54.16,000 --> 0:17:57,000
when they were scared to death.

371
0:17:57.16,000 --> 0:18:,000
And yet, a few years earlier,

372
0:18:01.16,000 --> 0:18:03,000
death never crossed their mind.

373
0:18:03.16,000 --> 0:18:06,000
I talked to a woman this past week

374
0:18:07.16,000 --> 0:18:09,000
whose father

375
0:18:10.16,000 --> 0:18:12,000
was a famous doctor.

376
0:18:13.16,000 --> 0:18:16,000
She said he never thought of God, never talked about God,

377
0:18:16.16,000 --> 0:18:19,000
didn't believe in God. He was an atheist.

378
0:18:21.16,000 --> 0:18:23,000
But she said,

379
0:18:23.16,000 --> 0:18:25,000
as he came to die,

380
0:18:25.16,000 --> 0:18:29,000
he sat up on the side of the bed one day,

381
0:18:29.16,000 --> 0:18:32,000
and he asked the nurse if he could see the chaplain.

382
0:18:32.16,000 --> 0:18:34,000
And he said, for the first time in his life

383
0:18:34.16,000 --> 0:18:37,000
he'd thought about the inevitable,

384
0:18:39.16,000 --> 0:18:41,000
and about God.

385
0:18:41.16,000 --> 0:18:43,000
Was there a God?

386
0:18:45.16,000 --> 0:18:48,000
A few years ago, a university student asked me,

387
0:18:49.16,000 --> 0:18:52,000
"What is the greatest surprise in your life?"

388
0:18:52.16,000 --> 0:18:54,000
And I said, "The greatest surprise in my life

389
0:18:54.16,000 --> 0:18:57,000
is the brevity of life.

390
0:18:57.16,000 --> 0:19:,000
It passes so fast."

391
0:19:02.16,000 --> 0:19:04,000
But it does not need to have to be that way.

392
0:19:04.16,000 --> 0:19:07,000
Wernher von Braun,

393
0:19:07.16,000 --> 0:19:1,000
in the aftermath of World War II concluded, quote:

394
0:19:10.16,000 --> 0:19:13,000
"science and religion are not antagonists.

395
0:19:13.16,000 --> 0:19:16,000
On the contrary, they're sisters."

396
0:19:17.16,000 --> 0:19:19,000
He put it on a personal basis.

397
0:19:19.16,000 --> 0:19:22,000
I knew Dr. von Braun very well.

398
0:19:22.16,000 --> 0:19:24,000
And he said, "Speaking for myself,

399
0:19:24.16,000 --> 0:19:27,000
I can only say that the grandeur of the cosmos

400
0:19:27.16,000 --> 0:19:29,000
serves only to confirm

401
0:19:29.16,000 --> 0:19:32,000
a belief in the certainty of a creator."

402
0:19:32.16,000 --> 0:19:34,000
He also said,

403
0:19:34.16,000 --> 0:19:36,000
"In our search to know God,

404
0:19:36.16,000 --> 0:19:39,000
I've come to believe that the life of Jesus Christ

405
0:19:40.16,000 --> 0:19:43,000
should be the focus of our efforts and inspiration.

406
0:19:44.16,000 --> 0:19:46,000
The reality of this life and His resurrection

407
0:19:46.16,000 --> 0:19:49,000
is the hope of mankind."

408
0:19:49.16,000 --> 0:19:51,000
I've done a lot of speaking in Germany

409
0:19:51.16,000 --> 0:19:54,000
and in France, and in different parts of the world --

410
0:19:54.16,000 --> 0:19:57,000
105 countries it's been my privilege to speak in.

411
0:19:59.16,000 --> 0:20:02,000
And I was invited one day to visit

412
0:20:03.16,000 --> 0:20:05,000
Chancellor Adenauer,

413
0:20:05.16,000 --> 0:20:08,000
who was looked upon as sort of the founder of modern Germany,

414
0:20:10.16,000 --> 0:20:12,000
since the war.

415
0:20:12.16,000 --> 0:20:14,000
And he once -- and he said to me,

416
0:20:14.16,000 --> 0:20:16,000
he said, "Young man." He said,

417
0:20:16.16,000 --> 0:20:19,000
"Do you believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ?"

418
0:20:20.16,000 --> 0:20:22,000
And I said, "Sir, I do."

419
0:20:22.16,000 --> 0:20:24,000
He said, "So do I."

420
0:20:24.16,000 --> 0:20:26,000
He said, "When I leave office,

421
0:20:26.16,000 --> 0:20:29,000
I'm going to spend my time writing a book

422
0:20:29.16,000 --> 0:20:32,000
on why Jesus Christ rose again,

423
0:20:32.16,000 --> 0:20:35,000
and why it's so important to believe that."

424
0:20:38.16,000 --> 0:20:4,000
In one of his plays,

425
0:20:40.16,000 --> 0:20:42,000
Alexander Solzhenitsyn

426
0:20:43.16,000 --> 0:20:45,000
depicts a man dying,

427
0:20:45.16,000 --> 0:20:48,000
who says to those gathered around his bed,

428
0:20:48.16,000 --> 0:20:5,000
"The moment when it's terrible to feel regret

429
0:20:50.16,000 --> 0:20:53,000
is when one is dying."

430
0:20:53.16,000 --> 0:20:57,000
How should one live in order not to feel regret when one is dying?

431
0:20:58.16,000 --> 0:21:,000
Blaise Pascal

432
0:21:00.16,000 --> 0:21:02,000
asked exactly that question

433
0:21:02.16,000 --> 0:21:04,000
in seventeenth-century France.

434
0:21:04.16,000 --> 0:21:06,000
Pascal has been called the architect

435
0:21:06.16,000 --> 0:21:08,000
of modern civilization.

436
0:21:09.16,000 --> 0:21:11,000
He was a brilliant scientist

437
0:21:11.16,000 --> 0:21:13,000
at the frontiers of mathematics,

438
0:21:13.16,000 --> 0:21:15,000
even as a teenager.

439
0:21:16.16,000 --> 0:21:19,000
He is viewed by many as the founder of the probability theory,

440
0:21:20.16,000 --> 0:21:24,000
and a creator of the first model of a computer.

441
0:21:24.16,000 --> 0:21:26,000
And of course, you are all familiar with

442
0:21:26.16,000 --> 0:21:29,000
the computer language named for him.

443
0:21:29.16,000 --> 0:21:31,000
Pascal explored in depth our human dilemmas

444
0:21:31.16,000 --> 0:21:35,000
of evil, suffering and death.

445
0:21:35.16,000 --> 0:21:38,000
He was astounded

446
0:21:38.16,000 --> 0:21:41,000
at the phenomenon we've been considering:

447
0:21:41.16,000 --> 0:21:43,000
that people can achieve extraordinary heights

448
0:21:43.16,000 --> 0:21:46,000
in science, the arts and human enterprise,

449
0:21:46.16,000 --> 0:21:49,000
yet they also are full of anger, hypocrisy

450
0:21:49.16,000 --> 0:21:52,000
and have -- and self-hatreds.

451
0:21:53.16,000 --> 0:21:55,000
Pascal saw us as a remarkable mixture

452
0:21:55.16,000 --> 0:21:58,000
of genius and self-delusion.

453
0:21:58.16,000 --> 0:22:,000
On November 23,

454
0:22:00.16,000 --> 0:22:02,000
1654,

455
0:22:03.16,000 --> 0:22:06,000
Pascal had a profound religious experience.

456
0:22:07.16,000 --> 0:22:1,000
He wrote in his journal these words:

457
0:22:10.16,000 --> 0:22:12,000
"I submit myself,

458
0:22:12.16,000 --> 0:22:14,000
absolutely,

459
0:22:15.16,000 --> 0:22:18,000
to Jesus Christ, my redeemer."

460
0:22:18.16,000 --> 0:22:2,000
A French historian said,

461
0:22:20.16,000 --> 0:22:23,000
two centuries later,

462
0:22:23.16,000 --> 0:22:25,000
"Seldom has so mighty an intellect

463
0:22:26.16,000 --> 0:22:29,000
submitted with such humility

464
0:22:29.16,000 --> 0:22:32,000
to the authority of Jesus Christ."

465
0:22:33.16,000 --> 0:22:36,000
Pascal came to believe not only the love and the grace of God

466
0:22:36.16,000 --> 0:22:39,000
could bring us back into harmony,

467
0:22:41.16,000 --> 0:22:43,000
but he believed

468
0:22:43.16,000 --> 0:22:46,000
that his own sins and failures could be forgiven,

469
0:22:46.16,000 --> 0:22:49,000
and that when he died he would go to a place called heaven.

470
0:22:51.16,000 --> 0:22:53,000
He experienced it in a way that went beyond

471
0:22:53.16,000 --> 0:22:55,000
scientific observation and reason.

472
0:22:55.16,000 --> 0:22:58,000
It was he who penned the well-known words,

473
0:22:58.16,000 --> 0:23:,000
"The heart has its reasons,

474
0:23:01.16,000 --> 0:23:04,000
which reason knows not of."

475
0:23:04.16,000 --> 0:23:07,000
Equally well known is Pascal's Wager.

476
0:23:07.16,000 --> 0:23:1,000
Essentially, he said this: "if you bet on God,

477
0:23:11.16,000 --> 0:23:13,000
and open yourself to his love,

478
0:23:13.16,000 --> 0:23:16,000
you lose nothing, even if you're wrong.

479
0:23:16.16,000 --> 0:23:19,000
But if instead you bet that there is no God,

480
0:23:20.16,000 --> 0:23:23,000
then you can lose it all, in this life and the life to come."

481
0:23:25.16,000 --> 0:23:27,000
For Pascal, scientific knowledge

482
0:23:27.16,000 --> 0:23:3,000
paled beside the knowledge of God.

483
0:23:31.16,000 --> 0:23:33,000
The knowledge of God was far beyond

484
0:23:33.16,000 --> 0:23:36,000
anything that ever crossed his mind.

485
0:23:36.16,000 --> 0:23:38,000
He was ready to face him

486
0:23:38.16,000 --> 0:23:41,000
when he died at the age of 39.

487
0:23:41.16,000 --> 0:23:43,000
King David lived to be 70,

488
0:23:43.16,000 --> 0:23:46,000
a long time in his era.

489
0:23:46.16,000 --> 0:23:49,000
Yet he too had to face death,

490
0:23:49.16,000 --> 0:23:51,000
and he wrote these words:

491
0:23:51.16,000 --> 0:23:55,000
"even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

492
0:23:55.16,000 --> 0:23:57,000
I will fear no evil,

493
0:23:57.16,000 --> 0:23:59,000
for you are with me."

494
0:23:59.16,000 --> 0:24:02,000
This was David's answer to three dilemmas

495
0:24:02.16,000 --> 0:24:05,000
of evil, suffering and death.

496
0:24:05.16,000 --> 0:24:08,000
It can be yours, as well,

497
0:24:09.16,000 --> 0:24:11,000
as you seek the living God

498
0:24:11.16,000 --> 0:24:13,000
and allow him to fill your life

499
0:24:13.16,000 --> 0:24:16,000
and give you hope for the future.

500
0:24:18.16,000 --> 0:24:2,000
When I was 17 years of age,

501
0:24:22.16,000 --> 0:24:25,000
I was born and reared on a farm in North Carolina.

502
0:24:26.16,000 --> 0:24:28,000
I milked cows every morning, and I had to milk the same cows every evening

503
0:24:28.16,000 --> 0:24:3,000
when I came home from school.

504
0:24:30.16,000 --> 0:24:32,000
And there were 20 of them that I had --

505
0:24:32.16,000 --> 0:24:35,000
that I was responsible for,

506
0:24:35.16,000 --> 0:24:38,000
and I worked on the farm

507
0:24:38.16,000 --> 0:24:41,000
and tried to keep up with my studies.

508
0:24:41.16,000 --> 0:24:44,000
I didn't make good grades in high school.

509
0:24:44.16,000 --> 0:24:47,000
I didn't make them in college, until

510
0:24:47.16,000 --> 0:24:49,000
something happened in my heart.

511
0:24:49.16,000 --> 0:24:52,000
One day, I was faced face-to-face

512
0:24:53.16,000 --> 0:24:55,000
with Christ.

513
0:24:55.16,000 --> 0:24:58,000
He said, "I am the way, the truth and the life."

514
0:24:59.16,000 --> 0:25:02,000
Can you imagine that? "I am the truth.

515
0:25:02.16,000 --> 0:25:05,000
I'm the embodiment of all truth."

516
0:25:05.16,000 --> 0:25:07,000
He was a liar.

517
0:25:09.16,000 --> 0:25:11,000
Or he was insane.

518
0:25:12.16,000 --> 0:25:14,000
Or he was what he claimed to be.

519
0:25:14.16,000 --> 0:25:16,000
Which was he?

520
0:25:16.16,000 --> 0:25:18,000
I had to make that decision.

521
0:25:18.16,000 --> 0:25:2,000
I couldn't prove it.

522
0:25:20.16,000 --> 0:25:22,000
I couldn't take it to a laboratory

523
0:25:22.16,000 --> 0:25:24,000
and experiment with it.

524
0:25:24.16,000 --> 0:25:27,000
But by faith I said, I believe him,

525
0:25:28.16,000 --> 0:25:31,000
and he came into my heart

526
0:25:31.16,000 --> 0:25:33,000
and changed my life.

527
0:25:33.16,000 --> 0:25:36,000
And now I'm ready,

528
0:25:36.16,000 --> 0:25:38,000
when I hear that call,

529
0:25:38.16,000 --> 0:25:41,000
to go into the presence of God.

530
0:25:41.16,000 --> 0:25:43,000
Thank you, and God bless all of you.

531
0:25:43.16,000 --> 0:25:53,000
(Applause)

532
0:25:54.16,000 --> 0:25:56,000
Thank you for the privilege. It was great.

533
0:25:56.16,000 --> 0:25:58,000
Richard Wurman: You did it.

534
0:25:58.16,000 --> 0:25:59,000
Thanks.

535
0:26:00.16,000 --> 0:26:15,000
(Applause)

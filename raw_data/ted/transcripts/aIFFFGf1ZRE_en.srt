1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm a believer.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'm a believer in global warming,

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and my record is good

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
on the subject.

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
But my subject

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
is national security.

7
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
We have to get off of oil purchased

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
from the enemy.

9
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I'm talking about OPEC oil.

10
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And let me take you back

11
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
100 years

12
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
to 1912.

13
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
You're probably thinking that was my birth year.

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
It wasn't. It was 1928.

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But go back to 1912,

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
100 years ago,

18
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and look at that point

19
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
what we, our country, was faced with.

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
It's the same energy question

21
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that you're looking at today,

22
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
but it's different sources of fuel.

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
A hundred years ago

24
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
we were looking at coal, of course,

25
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and we were looking at whale oil

26
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and we were looking at crude oil.

27
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
At that point,

28
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
we were looking for a fuel

29
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
that was cleaner,

30
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
it was cheaper,

31
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and it wasn't ours though,

32
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
it was theirs.

33
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
So at that point, 1912,

34
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
we selected crude oil over whale oil

35
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and some more coal.

36
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
But as we moved on

37
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
to the period now, 100 years later,

38
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
we're back really

39
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
at another decision point.

40
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
What is the decision point?

41
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
It's what we're going to use

42
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
in the future.

43
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So from here,

44
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
it's pretty clear to me,

45
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
we would prefer to have

46
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
cleaner, cheaper,

47
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
domestic, ours --

48
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and we have that, we have that --

49
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
which is natural gas.

50
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So here you are,

51
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that the cost of all this to the world

52
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
is 89 million barrels of oil,

53
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
give or take a few barrels, every day.

54
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And the cost annually

55
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
is three trillion dollars.

56
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And one trillion of that

57
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
goes to OPEC.

58
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
That has got to be stopped.

59
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Now if you look at the cost of OPEC,

60
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
it cost seven trillion dollars --

61
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
on the Milken Institute study last year --

62
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
seven trillion dollars

63
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
since 1976,

64
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
is what we paid for oil from OPEC.

65
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Now that includes the cost of military

66
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and the cost of the fuel both.

67
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But it's the greatest transfer of wealth,

68
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
from one group to another

69
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
in the history of mankind.

70
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And it continues.

71
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Now when you look

72
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
at where is the transfer of wealth,

73
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
you can see here

74
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that we have the arrows

75
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
going into the Mid-East

76
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and away from us.

77
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And with that,

78
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
we have found ourselves

79
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
to be the world's policemen.

80
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
We are policing the world,

81
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and how are we doing that?

82
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I know the response to this.

83
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I would bet there aren't 10 percent of you in the room

84
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that know how many aircraft carriers there are in the world.

85
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Raise your hand if you think you know.

86
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
There are 12.

87
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
One is under construction by the Chinese

88
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and the other 11 belong to us.

89
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Why do we have 11 aircraft carriers?

90
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Do we have a corner on the market?

91
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Are we smarter than anybody else? I'm not sure.

92
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
If you look at where they're located --

93
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and on this slide it's the red blobs on there --

94
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
there are five that are operating in the Mid-East,

95
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and the rest of them are in the United States.

96
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
They just move back to the Mid-East and those come back.

97
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So actually most of the 11 we have

98
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
are tied up in the Mid-East.

99
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Why? Why are they in the Mid-East?

100
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
They're there to control,

101
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
keep the shipping lanes open

102
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and make oil available.

103
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And the United States uses about 20 million barrels a day,

104
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
which is about 25 percent of all the oil used

105
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
everyday in the world.

106
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And we're doing it with four percent of the population.

107
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Somehow that doesn't seem right.

108
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
That's not sustainable.

109
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So where do we go from here?

110
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Does that continue?

111
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Yes, it's going to continue.

112
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
The slide you're looking at here

113
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
is 1990 to 2040.

114
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Over that period

115
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
you are going to double your demand.

116
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And when you look at what we're using the oil for,

117
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
70 percent of it

118
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
is used for transportation fuel.

119
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So when somebody says,

120
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
"Let's go more nuclear,

121
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
let's go wind, let's go solar,"

122
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
fine; I'm for anything American,

123
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
anything American.

124
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
But if you're going to do anything

125
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
about the dependency on foreign oil,

126
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
you have to address transportation.

127
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So here we are

128
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
using 20 million barrels a day --

129
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
producing eight, importing 12,

130
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and from the 12,

131
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
five comes from OPEC.

132
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
When you look at the biggest user and the second largest user,

133
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
we use 20 million barrels

134
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and the Chinese use 10.

135
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
The Chinese have a little bit better plan --

136
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
or they have a plan;

137
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
we have no plan.

138
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
In the history of America,

139
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
we've never had an energy plan.

140
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
We don't even realize the resources

141
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that we have available to us.

142
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
If you take the last 10 years

143
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and bring forward,

144
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
you've transferred to OPEC a trillion dollars.

145
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
If you go forward the next 10 years

146
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and cap the price of oil at 100 dollars a barrel,

147
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
you will pay 2.2 trillion.

148
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
That's not sustainable either.

149
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
But the days of cheap oil are over.

150
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
They're over.

151
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
They make it very clear to you,

152
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
the Saudis do,

153
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
they have to have 94 dollars a barrel

154
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
to make their social commitments.

155
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Now I had people in Washington last week told me,

156
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
he said, "The Saudis can produce the oil

157
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
for five dollars a barrel.

158
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
That has nothing to do with it.

159
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
It's what they have to pay for

160
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
is what we are going to pay for oil."

161
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
There is no free market for oil.

162
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
The oil is priced off the margin.

163
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And the OPEC nations

164
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
are the ones that price the oil.

165
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So where are we headed from here?

166
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
We're headed to natural gas.

167
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Natural gas will do everything

168
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
we want it to do.

169
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
It's 130 octane fuel.

170
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
It's 25 percent cleaner than oil.

171
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
It's ours, we have an abundance of it.

172
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And it does not require a refinery.

173
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
It comes out of the ground at 130 octane.

174
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Run it through the separator and you're ready to use it.

175
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
It's going to be very simple for us to use.

176
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
It's going to be simple to accomplish this.

177
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
You're going to find, and I'll tell you in just a minute,

178
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
what you're looking for to make it happen.

179
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
But here you can look at the list.

180
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Natural gas will fit all of those.

181
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
It will replace or be able to be used for that.

182
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
It's for power generation, transportation,

183
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
it's peaking fuel, it's all those.

184
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
Do we have enough natural gas?

185
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Look at the bar on the left. It's 24 trillion.

186
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
It's what we use a year.

187
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Go forward

188
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and the estimates that you have

189
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
from the EIA and onto the industry estimates --

190
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
the industry knows what they're talking about --

191
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
we've got 4,000 trillion cubic feet

192
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
of natural gas that's available to us.

193
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
How does that translate

194
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
to barrels of oil equivalent?

195
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
It would be three times

196
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
what the Saudis claim they have.

197
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And they claim they have 250 billion barrels of oil,

198
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
which I do not believe.

199
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I think it's probably 175 billion barrels.

200
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
But anyway, whether they say they're right or whatever,

201
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
we have plenty of natural gas.

202
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
So I have tried to target

203
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
on where we use the natural gas.

204
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And where I've targeted

205
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
is on the heavy-duty trucks.

206
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
There are eight million of them.

207
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
You take eight million trucks --

208
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
these are 18-wheelers --

209
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and take them to natural gas,

210
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
reduce carbon by 30 percent,

211
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
it is cheaper

212
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and it will cut our imports

213
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
three million barrels.

214
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
So you will cut 60 percent off of OPEC

215
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
with eight million trucks.

216
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
There are 250 million vehicles in America.

217
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
So what you have

218
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
is natural gas is the bridge fuel,

219
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
is the way I see it.

220
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I don't have to worry

221
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
about the bridge to where at my age.

222
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
(Laughter)

223
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
That's your concern.

224
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
But when you look at the natural gas we have

225
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
it could very well be

226
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
the bridge to natural gas,

227
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
because you have plenty of natural gas.

228
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
But as I said, I'm for anything American.

229
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Now let me take you -- I've been a realist --

230
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
I went from theorist early to realist.

231
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
I'm back to theorist again.

232
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
If you look at the world,

233
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
you have methane hydrates in the ocean

234
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
around every continent.

235
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And here you can see methane,

236
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
if that's the way you're going to go,

237
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
that there's plenty of methane --

238
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
natural gas is methane,

239
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
methane and natural gas are interchangeable --

240
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
but if you decide

241
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
that you're going to use some methane --

242
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and I'm gone, so it's up to you --

243
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
but we do have

244
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
plenty of methane hydrates.

245
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
So I think I've made my point

246
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
that we have to get on our own resources in America.

247
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
If we do --

248
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
it's costing us a billion dollars a day for oil.

249
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And yet, we have no energy plan.

250
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
So there's nothing going on

251
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that impresses me

252
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
in Washington on that plan,

253
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
other than I'm trying to focus

254
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
on that eight million 18-wheelers.

255
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
If we could do that,

256
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
I think we would take our first step

257
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
to an energy plan.

258
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
If we did, we could see

259
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
that our own resources are easier to use

260
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
than anybody can imagine.

261
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Thank you.

262
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
(Applause)

263
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Chris Anderson: Thanks for that.

264
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So from your point of view,

265
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
you had this great Pickens Plan

266
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
that was based on wind energy,

267
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and you abandoned it basically

268
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
because the economics changed.

269
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
What happened?

270
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
TBP: I lost 150 million dollars.

271
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
(Laughter)

272
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
That'll make you abandon something.

273
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
No, what happened to us, Chris,

274
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
is that power, it's priced off the margin.

275
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And so the margin is natural gas.

276
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And at the time I went into the wind business,

277
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
natural gas was nine dollars.

278
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Today it's two dollars and forty cents.

279
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
You cannot do a wind deal

280
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
under six dollars an MCF.

281
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
CA: So what happened was

282
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
that, through increased ability

283
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
to use fracking technology,

284
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
the calculated reserves of natural gas kind of exploded

285
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and the price plummeted,

286
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
which made wind uncompetitive.

287
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
In a nutshell that's what happened?

288
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
TBP: That's what happened.

289
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
We found out that we could go to the source rock,

290
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
which were the carboniferous shales in the basins.

291
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
The first one was Barnett Shale in Texas

292
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and then the Marcellus up in the Northeast

293
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
across New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia;

294
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and Haynesville in Louisiana.

295
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
This stuff is everywhere.

296
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
We are overwhelmed with natural gas.

297
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
CA: And now you're a big investor in that and bringing that to market?

298
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
TBP: Well you say a big investor.

299
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
It's my life.

300
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
I'm a geologist, got out of school in '51,

301
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and I've been in the industry my entire life.

302
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Now I do own stocks.

303
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
I'm not a big natural gas producer.

304
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Somebody the other day said

305
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
I was the second largest natural gas producer in the United States.

306
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Don't I wish.

307
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
But no, I'm not. I own stocks.

308
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
But I also am in the fueling business.

309
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
CA: But natural gas is a fossil fuel.

310
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
You burn it,

311
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
you release CO2.

312
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
So you believe in the threat of climate change.

313
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Why doesn't that prospect

314
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
concern you?

315
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
TBP: Well you're going to have to use something.

316
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
What do you have to replace it?

317
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
(Laughter)

318
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
CA: No, no. The argument that it's a bridge fuel makes sense,

319
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
because the amount of CO2 per unit of energy

320
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
is lower than oil and coal, correct?

321
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And so everyone can be at least happy

322
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
to see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas.

323
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
But if that's it

324
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and that becomes the reason

325
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
that renewables don't get invested in,

326
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
then, long-term, we're screwed anyway, right?

327
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
TBP: Well I'm not ready to give up,

328
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
but Jim and I talked

329
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
there as he left,

330
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and I said, "How do you feel about natural gas?"

331
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
And he said, "Well it's a bridge fuel, is what it is."

332
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And I said, "Bridge to what?

333
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Where are we headed?"

334
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
See but again, I told you, I don't have to worry with that.

335
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
You all do.

336
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
CA: But I don't think that's right, Boone.

337
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
I think you're a person who believes in your legacy.

338
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
You've made the money you need.

339
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
You're one of the few people in a position

340
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
to really swing the debate.

341
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Do you support the idea of some kind of price on carbon?

342
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Does that make sense?

343
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
TBP: I don't like that

344
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
because it ends up the government is going to run the program.

345
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
I can tell you it will be a failure.

346
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
The government is not successful

347
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
on these things.

348
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
They just aren't, it's a bad deal.

349
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
Look at Solyndra, or whatever it was.

350
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
I mean, that was told to be a bad idea 10 times,

351
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
they went ahead and did it anyway.

352
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
But that only blew out 500 million.

353
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
I think it's closer to a billion.

354
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
But Chris, I think where we're headed,

355
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
the long-term,

356
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
I don't mind going back to nuclear.

357
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
And I can tell you what the last page

358
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
of the report that will take them five years to write

359
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
will be.

360
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
One, don't build a reformer on a fault.

361
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
(Laughter)

362
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And number two,

363
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
do not build a reformer on the ocean.

364
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
And now I think reformers are safe.

365
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Move them inland

366
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and on very stable ground

367
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and build the reformers.

368
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
There isn't anything wrong with nuke.

369
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
You're going to have to have energy. There is no question.

370
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
You can't -- okay.

371
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
CA: One of the questions from the audience

372
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
is, with fracking and the natural gas process,

373
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
what about the problem of methane leaking from that,

374
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
methane being a worse global warming gas

375
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
than CO2?

376
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Is that a concern?

377
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
TBP: Fracking? What is fracking?

378
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
CA: Fracking.

379
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
TBP: I'm teasing.

380
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
(Laughter)

381
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
CA: We've got a little bit of accent incompatibility here, you know.

382
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
TBP: No, let me tell you,

383
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
I've told you what my age was.

384
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
I got out of school in '51.

385
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
I witnessed my first frack job

386
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
at border Texas in 1953.

387
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Fracking came out in '47,

388
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
and don't believe for a minute

389
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
when our president gets up there

390
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
and says the Department of Energy 30 years ago

391
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
developed fracking.

392
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
I don't know what in the hell he's talking about.

393
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
I mean seriously, the Department of Energy

394
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
did not have anything to do with fracking.

395
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
The first frack job was in '47.

396
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
I saw my first one in '53.

397
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
I've fracked over 3,000 wells in my life.

398
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Never had a problem

399
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
with messing up an aquifer or anything else.

400
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
Now the largest aquifer in North America

401
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
is from Midland, Texas to the South Dakota border,

402
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
across eight states --

403
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
big aquifer:

404
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Ogallala, Triassic age.

405
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
There had to have been 800,000 wells fracked

406
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas

407
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
in that aquifer.

408
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
There's no problems.

409
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
I don't understand why

410
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
the media is focused on Eastern Pennsylvania.

411
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
CA: All right, so you don't support a carbon tax of any kind

412
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
or a price on carbon.

413
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
Your picture then I guess

414
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
of how the world eventually gets off fossil fuels

415
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
is through innovation ultimately,

416
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
that we'll someday make solar and nuclear cost competitive?

417
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
TBP: Solar and wind, Jim and I agreed on that in 13 seconds.

418
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
That is, it's going to be a small part,

419
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
because you can't rely on it.

420
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
CA: So how does the world get off fossil fuels?

421
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
TBP: How do we get there?

422
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
We have so much natural gas,

423
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
a day will not come

424
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
where you say, "Well let's don't use that anymore."

425
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
You'll keep using it. It is the cleanest of all.

426
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
And if you look at California,

427
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
they use 2,500 buses.

428
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
LAMTA have been on natural gas

429
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
for 25 years.

430
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
The Ft. Worth T

431
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
has been on it for 25 years.

432
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
Why? Air quality was the reason they used natural gas

433
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:27,000
and got away from diesel.

434
0:18:27.26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
Why are all the trash trucks today in Southern California

435
0:18:29.26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
on natural gas?

436
0:18:31.26,000 --> 0:18:33,000
It's because of air quality.

437
0:18:33.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
I know what you're telling me, and I'm not disagreeing with you.

438
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:39,000
How in the hell can we get off the natural gas at some point?

439
0:18:39.26,000 --> 0:18:42,000
And I say, that is your problem.

440
0:18:42.26,000 --> 0:18:44,000
(Laughter)

441
0:18:44.26,000 --> 0:18:46,000
CA: All right,

442
0:18:46.26,000 --> 0:18:48,000
so it's the bridge fuel.

443
0:18:48.26,000 --> 0:18:5,000
What is at the other end of that bridge

444
0:18:50.26,000 --> 0:18:52,000
is for this audience to figure out.

445
0:18:52.26,000 --> 0:18:54,000
If someone comes to you with a plan

446
0:18:54.26,000 --> 0:18:56,000
that really looks like it might be part of this solution,

447
0:18:56.26,000 --> 0:18:59,000
are you ready to invest in those technologies,

448
0:18:59.26,000 --> 0:19:01,000
even if they aren't maximized for profits,

449
0:19:01.26,000 --> 0:19:04,000
they might be maximized for the future health of the planet?

450
0:19:04.26,000 --> 0:19:07,000
TBP: I lost 150 million on the wind, okay.

451
0:19:07.26,000 --> 0:19:1,000
Yeah, sure, I'm game for it.

452
0:19:10.26,000 --> 0:19:13,000
Because, again,

453
0:19:13.26,000 --> 0:19:17,000
I'm trying to get energy solved for America.

454
0:19:17.26,000 --> 0:19:2,000
And anything American

455
0:19:20.26,000 --> 0:19:22,000
will work for me.

456
0:19:22.26,000 --> 0:19:24,000
CA: Boone, I really, really appreciate you coming here,

457
0:19:24.26,000 --> 0:19:26,000
engaging in this conversation.

458
0:19:26.26,000 --> 0:19:29,000
I think there's a lot of people who will want to engage with you.

459
0:19:29.26,000 --> 0:19:31,000
And that was a real gift you gave this audience.

460
0:19:31.26,000 --> 0:19:34,000
Thank you so much. (TBP: You bet, Chris. Thank you.)

461
0:19:34.26,000 --> 0:19:36,000
(Applause)

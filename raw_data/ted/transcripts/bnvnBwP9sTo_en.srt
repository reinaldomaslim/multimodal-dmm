1
0:00:12.732,000 --> 0:00:15,000
My name is Katrina Spade, and I grew up in a medical family

2
0:00:16.3,000 --> 0:00:19,000
where it was fairly normal to talk about death and dying at the dinner table.

3
0:00:20.9,000 --> 0:00:23,000
But I didn't go into medicine like so many of my family members.

4
0:00:24.5,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Instead, I went to architecture school to learn how to design.

5
0:00:29.74,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And while I was there, I began to be curious

6
0:00:32.14,000 --> 0:00:35,000
about what would happen to my physical body after I died.

7
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
What would my nearest and dearest do with me?

8
0:00:39.78,000 --> 0:00:42,000
So if the existence and the fact of your own mortality

9
0:00:43.54,000 --> 0:00:44,000
doesn't get you down,

10
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
the state of our current funerary practices will.

11
0:00:49.74,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Today, almost 50 percent of Americans choose conventional burial.

12
0:00:55.42,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Conventional burial begins with embalming,

13
0:00:57.66,000 --> 0:00:59,000
where funeral staff drain bodily fluid

14
0:01:00.46,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and replace it with a mixture designed to preserve the corpse

15
0:01:04.34,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and give it a lifelike glow.

16
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Then, as you know, bodies are buried in a casket

17
0:01:10.82,000 --> 0:01:12,000
in a concrete-lined grave

18
0:01:13.02,000 --> 0:01:14,000
in a cemetery.

19
0:01:16.3,000 --> 0:01:18,000
All told, in US cemeteries,

20
0:01:18.62,000 --> 0:01:21,000
we bury enough metal to build a Golden Gate Bridge,

21
0:01:23.94,000 --> 0:01:26,000
enough wood to build 1,800 single family homes,

22
0:01:27.86,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and enough formaldehyde-laden embalming fluid

23
0:01:30.66,000 --> 0:01:33,000
to fill eight Olympic-size swimming pools.

24
0:01:34.98,000 --> 0:01:38,000
In addition, cemeteries all over the world are reaching capacity.

25
0:01:39.54,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Turns out, it doesn't really make good business sense

26
0:01:42.38,000 --> 0:01:45,000
to sell someone a piece of land for eternity.

27
0:01:45.94,000 --> 0:01:47,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:47.98,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Whose idea was that?

29
0:01:49.62,000 --> 0:01:52,000
In some places, you can't buy a plot no matter how much money you have.

30
0:01:54.5,000 --> 0:01:57,000
As a result, cremation rates have risen fast.

31
0:01:58.1,000 --> 0:02:03,000
In 1950, if you suggested your grandmother be incinerated after she died,

32
0:02:03.18,000 --> 0:02:05,000
you'd probably be kicked from the family deathbed.

33
0:02:06.34,000 --> 0:02:09,000
But today, almost half of Americans choose cremation,

34
0:02:10.02,000 --> 0:02:11,000
citing simpler,

35
0:02:12.5,000 --> 0:02:13,000
cheaper

36
0:02:13.94,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and more ecological as reasons.

37
0:02:17.54,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I used to think that cremation was a sustainable form of disposition,

38
0:02:22.34,000 --> 0:02:23,000
but just think about it for a second.

39
0:02:24.78,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Cremation destroys the potential we have

40
0:02:27.7,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to give back to the earth after we've died.

41
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
It uses an energy-intensive process to turn bodies into ash,

42
0:02:35.46,000 --> 0:02:38,000
polluting the air and contributing to climate change.

43
0:02:39.62,000 --> 0:02:41,000
All told, cremations in the US

44
0:02:41.94,000 --> 0:02:45,000
emit a staggering 600 million pounds of carbon dioxide

45
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
into the atmosphere annually.

46
0:02:49.9,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The truly awful truth

47
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
is that the very last thing that most of us will do on this earth

48
0:02:56.86,000 --> 0:02:57,000
is poison it.

49
0:03:02.94,000 --> 0:03:07,000
It's like we've created, accepted and death-denied our way into a status quo

50
0:03:08.66,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that puts as much distance between ourselves and nature

51
0:03:12.3,000 --> 0:03:13,000
as is humanly possible.

52
0:03:14.42,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Our modern funerary practices are designed to stave off

53
0:03:17.3,000 --> 0:03:19,000
the natural processes that happen to a body after death.

54
0:03:20.62,000 --> 0:03:23,000
In other words, they're meant to prevent us from decomposing.

55
0:03:25.14,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But the truth

56
0:03:26.98,000 --> 0:03:28,000
is that nature is really, really good at death.

57
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
We've all seen it.

58
0:03:32.66,000 --> 0:03:34,000
When organic material dies in nature,

59
0:03:35.42,000 --> 0:03:38,000
microbes and bacteria break it down into nutrient-rich soil,

60
0:03:39.18,000 --> 0:03:4,000
completing the life cycle.

61
0:03:41.62,000 --> 0:03:44,000
In nature, death creates life.

62
0:03:47.82,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Back in architecture school, I was thinking about all this,

63
0:03:52.22,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and I set out on a plan to redesign death care.

64
0:03:55.82,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Could I create a system

65
0:03:57.9,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that was beneficial to the earth

66
0:03:59.78,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and that used nature as a guide rather than something to be feared?

67
0:04:04.5,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Something that was gentle to the planet?

68
0:04:07.22,000 --> 0:04:09,000
That planet, after all, supports our living bodies

69
0:04:09.94,000 --> 0:04:1,000
our whole lives.

70
0:04:12.98,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And while I was mulling this all over

71
0:04:15.5,000 --> 0:04:16,000
over the drawing board,

72
0:04:17.42,000 --> 0:04:18,000
the phone rang.

73
0:04:19.34,000 --> 0:04:2,000
It was my friend Kate.

74
0:04:21.46,000 --> 0:04:24,000
She was like, "Hey, have you heard about the farmers

75
0:04:25.1,000 --> 0:04:27,000
who are composting whole cows?"

76
0:04:29.18,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And I was like, "Mmmm."

77
0:04:31.339,000 --> 0:04:32,000
(Laughter)

78
0:04:34.7,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Turns out that farmers in agricultural institutions

79
0:04:37.42,000 --> 0:04:4,000
have been practicing something called livestock mortality composting

80
0:04:40.86,000 --> 0:04:41,000
for decades.

81
0:04:42.42,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Mortality composting is where you take an animal high in nitrogen

82
0:04:46.42,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and cover it with co-composting materials that are high in carbon.

83
0:04:50.22,000 --> 0:04:53,000
It's an aerobic process, so it requires oxygen,

84
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and it requires plenty of moisture as well.

85
0:04:56.62,000 --> 0:05:,000
In the most basic setup, a cow is covered with a few feet of wood chips,

86
0:05:01.02,000 --> 0:05:02,000
which are high in carbon,

87
0:05:02.38,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and left outside for nature, for breezes to provide oxygen

88
0:05:06.7,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and rain to provide moisture.

89
0:05:09.62,000 --> 0:05:11,000
In about nine months,

90
0:05:11.86,000 --> 0:05:14,000
all that remains is a nutrient-rich compost.

91
0:05:15.86,000 --> 0:05:18,000
The flesh has been decomposed entirely,

92
0:05:19.22,000 --> 0:05:2,000
as have the bones.

93
0:05:22.34,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I know.

94
0:05:23.58,000 --> 0:05:24,000
(Laughter)

95
0:05:25.1,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So I would definitely call myself a decomposition nerd,

96
0:05:29.3,000 --> 0:05:32,000
but I am far, far from a scientist,

97
0:05:33.06,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and one way you can tell this is true

98
0:05:34.9,000 --> 0:05:38,000
is that I have often called the process of composting "magic."

99
0:05:39.22,000 --> 0:05:42,000
(Laughter)

100
0:05:43.1,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So basically, all we humans need to do

101
0:05:46.5,000 --> 0:05:48,000
is create the right environment for nature to do its job.

102
0:05:49.86,000 --> 0:05:52,000
It's like the opposite of antibacterial soap.

103
0:05:53.38,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Instead of fighting them,

104
0:05:54.66,000 --> 0:05:57,000
we welcome microbes and bacteria in with open arms.

105
0:05:58.66,000 --> 0:06:,000
These tiny, amazing creatures

106
0:06:01.42,000 --> 0:06:05,000
break down molecules into smaller molecules and atoms,

107
0:06:05.46,000 --> 0:06:08,000
which are then incorporated into new molecules.

108
0:06:10.1,000 --> 0:06:13,000
In other words, that cow is transformed.

109
0:06:13.98,000 --> 0:06:14,000
It's no longer a cow.

110
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
It's been cycled back into nature.

111
0:06:19.62,000 --> 0:06:2,000
See? Magic.

112
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
You can probably imagine the light bulb that went off in my head

113
0:06:27.34,000 --> 0:06:28,000
after I received that phone call.

114
0:06:29.46,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I began designing a system

115
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
based on the principles of livestock mortality composting

116
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that would take human beings and transform them into soil.

117
0:06:43.66,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Fast-forward five years

118
0:06:45.58,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and the project has grown in ways I truly never could have imagined.

119
0:06:49.82,000 --> 0:06:53,000
We've created a scalable, replicable non-profit urban model

120
0:06:54.3,000 --> 0:06:57,000
based on the science of livestock mortality composting

121
0:06:57.82,000 --> 0:06:59,000
that turns human beings into soil.

122
0:07:01.42,000 --> 0:07:04,000
We've partnered and collaborated with experts in soil science,

123
0:07:04.78,000 --> 0:07:06,000
decomposition, alternative death care,

124
0:07:07.34,000 --> 0:07:08,000
law and architecture.

125
0:07:09.5,000 --> 0:07:11,000
We've raised funds from foundations and individuals

126
0:07:12.78,000 --> 0:07:15,000
in order to design a prototype of this system,

127
0:07:16.46,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and we've heard from tens of thousands of people all over the world

128
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
who want this option to be available.

129
0:07:24.9,000 --> 0:07:25,000
OK.

130
0:07:26.14,000 --> 0:07:27,000
In the next few years,

131
0:07:27.98,000 --> 0:07:32,000
it's our goal to build the first full-scale human composting facility

132
0:07:33.9,000 --> 0:07:34,000
right in the city of Seattle.

133
0:07:35.7,000 --> 0:07:38,000
(Applause)

134
0:07:43.7,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Imagine it,

135
0:07:45.7,000 --> 0:07:46,000
part public park,

136
0:07:47.66,000 --> 0:07:48,000
part funeral home,

137
0:07:49.42,000 --> 0:07:51,000
part memorial to the people we love,

138
0:07:52.14,000 --> 0:07:55,000
a place where we can reconnect with the cycles of nature

139
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and treat bodies with gentleness and respect.

140
0:08:00.46,000 --> 0:08:01,000
The infrastructure is simple.

141
0:08:02.42,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Inside a vertical core,

142
0:08:04.06,000 --> 0:08:08,000
bodies and wood chips undergo accelerated natural decomposition,

143
0:08:08.18,000 --> 0:08:09,000
or composting,

144
0:08:09.5,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and are transformed into soil.

145
0:08:12.98,000 --> 0:08:16,000
When someone dies, their body is taken to a human composting facility.

146
0:08:18.3,000 --> 0:08:2,000
After wrapping the deceased in a simple shroud,

147
0:08:21.1,000 --> 0:08:24,000
friends and family carry the body to the top of the core,

148
0:08:24.98,000 --> 0:08:26,000
which contains the natural decomposition system.

149
0:08:30.5,000 --> 0:08:31,000
During a laying in ceremony,

150
0:08:32.38,000 --> 0:08:34,000
they gently place the body into the core

151
0:08:34.78,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and cover it with wood chips.

152
0:08:37.18,000 --> 0:08:4,000
This begins the gentle transformation from human to soil.

153
0:08:42.82,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Over the next few weeks, the body decomposes naturally.

154
0:08:46.78,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Microbes and bacteria break down carbon, then protein,

155
0:08:49.58,000 --> 0:08:51,000
to create a new substance,

156
0:08:51.7,000 --> 0:08:52,000
a rich, earthy soil.

157
0:08:54.46,000 --> 0:08:56,000
This soil can then be used to grow new life.

158
0:08:57.62,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Eventually, you could be a lemon tree.

159
0:09:01.406,000 --> 0:09:02,000
(Applause)

160
0:09:02.58,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Yeah, thank you.

161
0:09:03.82,000 --> 0:09:06,000
(Applause)

162
0:09:09.7,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Who's thinking about lemon meringue pie right now?

163
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
(Laughter)

164
0:09:14.42,000 --> 0:09:15,000
A lemon drop?

165
0:09:16.54,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Something stronger?

166
0:09:19.14,000 --> 0:09:21,000
So in addition to housing the core,

167
0:09:21.38,000 --> 0:09:23,000
these buildings will function to support the grieving

168
0:09:24.1,000 --> 0:09:27,000
by providing space for memorial services and end-of-life planning.

169
0:09:28.38,000 --> 0:09:3,000
The potential for repurposing is huge.

170
0:09:30.94,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Old churches and industrial warehouses can be converted into places

171
0:09:35.58,000 --> 0:09:37,000
where we create soil and honor life.

172
0:09:39.62,000 --> 0:09:41,000
We want to bring back the aspect of ritual

173
0:09:41.82,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that's been diluted over the past hundred years

174
0:09:44.62,000 --> 0:09:46,000
as cremation rates have risen

175
0:09:46.74,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and religious affiliation has declined.

176
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Our Seattle facility will function as a model for these places

177
0:09:54.82,000 --> 0:09:55,000
all over the world.

178
0:09:56.94,000 --> 0:09:59,000
We've heard from communities in South Africa, Australia,

179
0:10:00.1,000 --> 0:10:02,000
the UK, Canada and beyond.

180
0:10:03.78,000 --> 0:10:05,000
We're creating a design toolkit

181
0:10:06.18,000 --> 0:10:09,000
that will help others design and build facilities

182
0:10:10.06,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that will contain technical specifications

183
0:10:12.66,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and regulatory best practices.

184
0:10:14.9,000 --> 0:10:16,000
We want to help individuals, organizations,

185
0:10:17.42,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and down the road, municipalities

186
0:10:19.66,000 --> 0:10:21,000
design and build facilities in their own cities.

187
0:10:23.86,000 --> 0:10:26,000
The idea is that every one of these places should look and feel completely different

188
0:10:27.86,000 --> 0:10:28,000
with the same system inside.

189
0:10:29.78,000 --> 0:10:33,000
They're really meant to be designed for the neighborhood in which they reside

190
0:10:33.86,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and the community which they serve.

191
0:10:38.3,000 --> 0:10:41,000
The other idea is for supportive staff to be on hand

192
0:10:41.54,000 --> 0:10:44,000
to help families with the care and preparation of loved ones' bodies.

193
0:10:46.34,000 --> 0:10:49,000
We're banishing practices that bewilder and disempower

194
0:10:49.78,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and creating a system that is beautiful and meaningful

195
0:10:54.14,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and transparent.

196
0:10:56.9,000 --> 0:10:58,000
We believe that access to ecological death care

197
0:10:59.58,000 --> 0:11:,000
is a human right.

198
0:11:04.46,000 --> 0:11:07,000
OK, so you know the old saying,

199
0:11:07.58,000 --> 0:11:09,000
if you can compost a cow, you can compost a human?

200
0:11:10.18,000 --> 0:11:13,000
(Laughter)

201
0:11:15.1,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Turns out, it's true.

202
0:11:18.14,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Since 2014, we've been running a pilot project

203
0:11:21.22,000 --> 0:11:22,000
in the hills of North Carolina

204
0:11:23.1,000 --> 0:11:26,000
with the Forensic Anthropology Department at Western Carolina University.

205
0:11:28.02,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Six donor bodies have been covered in wood chips,

206
0:11:31.42,000 --> 0:11:33,000
oxygen provided by breezes,

207
0:11:33.74,000 --> 0:11:35,000
microbes and bacteria doing their jobs.

208
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
This pilot program has allowed us to demonstrate that it's possible

209
0:11:40.78,000 --> 0:11:43,000
to harness the incredible power of natural decomposition

210
0:11:44.5,000 --> 0:11:45,000
to turn human bodies into soil,

211
0:11:47.22,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and we're working with other universities as well.

212
0:11:50.3,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Soil scientists at Washington State University,

213
0:11:54.34,000 --> 0:11:55,000
the grad students, anyway,

214
0:11:55.9,000 --> 0:11:59,000
are working to compost teeth with amalgam fillings

215
0:11:59.98,000 --> 0:12:01,000
so that we can understand what happens to the mercury therein.

216
0:12:03.86,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Next up, we'll be beginning experiments

217
0:12:05.94,000 --> 0:12:08,000
to determine what happens to chemo drugs and pharmaceuticals

218
0:12:09.42,000 --> 0:12:1,000
during the composting process,

219
0:12:11.18,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and whether additional remediation will be needed.

220
0:12:17.46,000 --> 0:12:18,000
By the way,

221
0:12:19.22,000 --> 0:12:21,000
composting creates a great deal of heat,

222
0:12:21.74,000 --> 0:12:23,000
especially this particular type of composting.

223
0:12:25.7,000 --> 0:12:29,000
One week after we began composting our fifth donor body,

224
0:12:30.5,000 --> 0:12:33,000
the temperature inside that mound of wood chips

225
0:12:33.66,000 --> 0:12:36,000
reached 158 degrees Fahrenheit.

226
0:12:37.94,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Imagine harnessing that heat to create energy

227
0:12:40.98,000 --> 0:12:42,000
or comfort the grieving on a cold day.

228
0:12:44.86,000 --> 0:12:45,000
The death care revolution has begun.

229
0:12:47.54,000 --> 0:12:48,000
It's an exciting time to be alive.

230
0:12:51.46,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Thank you.

231
0:12:52.7,000 --> 0:12:55,000
(Applause)

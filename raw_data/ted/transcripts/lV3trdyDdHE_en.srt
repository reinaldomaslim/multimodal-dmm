1
0:00:12.546,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I was in New York during Hurricane Sandy,

2
0:00:14.793,000 --> 0:00:16,000
and this little white dog called Maui

3
0:00:17.033,000 --> 0:00:18,000
was staying with me.

4
0:00:18.918,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Half the city was dark because of a power cut,

5
0:00:21.39,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and I was living on the dark side.

6
0:00:23.614,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Now, Maui was terrified of the dark,

7
0:00:25.723,000 --> 0:00:27,000
so I had to carry him up the stairs,

8
0:00:27.827,000 --> 0:00:3,000
actually down the stairs first, for his walk,

9
0:00:30.915,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and then bring him back up.

10
0:00:32.803,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I was also hauling gallons of bottles of water

11
0:00:35.784,000 --> 0:00:37,000
up to the seventh floor every day.

12
0:00:37.883,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And through all of this,

13
0:00:39.456,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I had to hold a torch between my teeth.

14
0:00:41.76,000 --> 0:00:43,000
The stores nearby were out of flashlights

15
0:00:44.404,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and batteries and bread.

16
0:00:47.341,000 --> 0:00:49,000
For a shower, I walked 40 blocks

17
0:00:50.004,000 --> 0:00:51,000
to a branch of my gym.

18
0:00:51.978,000 --> 0:00:54,000
But these were not the major preoccupations of my day.

19
0:00:55.057,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It was just as critical for me to be the first person in

20
0:00:58.358,000 --> 0:01:01,000
at a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers

21
0:01:01.65,000 --> 0:01:02,000
to juice my multiple devices.

22
0:01:03.499,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I started to prospect under the benches of bakeries

23
0:01:06.224,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and the entrances of pastry shops for plug points.

24
0:01:09.849,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I wasn't the only one.

25
0:01:11.418,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Even in the rain, people stood between Madison and 5th Avenue

26
0:01:15.182,000 --> 0:01:17,000
under their umbrellas charging their cell phones

27
0:01:17.646,000 --> 0:01:19,000
from outlets on the street.

28
0:01:19.683,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Nature had just reminded us

29
0:01:21.94,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that it was stronger than all our technology,

30
0:01:24.256,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and yet here we were, obsessed about being wired.

31
0:01:27.525,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I think there's nothing like a crisis

32
0:01:29.401,000 --> 0:01:32,000
to tell you what's really important and what's not,

33
0:01:32.59,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and Sandy made me realize that our devices

34
0:01:36.152,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and their connectivity matter to us

35
0:01:38.418,000 --> 0:01:42,000
right up there with food and shelter.

36
0:01:42.936,000 --> 0:01:45,000
The self as we once knew it no longer exists,

37
0:01:46.253,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and I think that an abstract, digital universe

38
0:01:48.745,000 --> 0:01:5,000
has become a part of our identity,

39
0:01:51.27,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and I want to talk to you about what I think that means.

40
0:01:55.522,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I'm a novelist, and I'm interested in the self

41
0:01:58.365,000 --> 0:02:,000
because the self and fiction have a lot in common.

42
0:02:00.834,000 --> 0:02:03,000
They're both stories, interpretations.

43
0:02:04.151,000 --> 0:02:06,000
You and I can experience things without a story.

44
0:02:06.604,000 --> 0:02:08,000
We might run up the stairs too quickly

45
0:02:08.686,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and we might get breathless.

46
0:02:10.373,000 --> 0:02:12,000
But the larger sense that we have of our lives,

47
0:02:12.903,000 --> 0:02:15,000
the slightly more abstract one, is indirect.

48
0:02:16.263,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Our story of our life is based on direct experience,

49
0:02:19.383,000 --> 0:02:2,000
but it's embellished.

50
0:02:21.277,000 --> 0:02:23,000
A novel needs scene after scene to build,

51
0:02:24.125,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and the story of our life needs an arc as well.

52
0:02:27.273,000 --> 0:02:29,000
It needs months and years.

53
0:02:29.964,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Discrete moments from our lives are its chapters.

54
0:02:32.982,000 --> 0:02:34,000
But the story is not about these chapters.

55
0:02:35.572,000 --> 0:02:36,000
It's the whole book.

56
0:02:37.517,000 --> 0:02:4,000
It's not only about the heartbreak and the happiness,

57
0:02:40.86,000 --> 0:02:42,000
the victories and the disappointments,

58
0:02:43.039,000 --> 0:02:45,000
but it's because how because of these,

59
0:02:45.244,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and sometimes, more importantly, in spite of these,

60
0:02:48.397,000 --> 0:02:5,000
we find our place in the world

61
0:02:50.492,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and we change it and we change ourselves.

62
0:02:53.572,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Our story, therefore, needs two dimensions of time:

63
0:02:56.965,000 --> 0:02:59,000
a long arc of time that is our lifespan,

64
0:02:59.98,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and the timeframe of direct experience

65
0:03:02.483,000 --> 0:03:03,000
that is the moment.

66
0:03:03.936,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Now the self that experiences directly

67
0:03:06.066,000 --> 0:03:07,000
can only exist in the moment,

68
0:03:07.967,000 --> 0:03:09,000
but the one that narrates needs several moments,

69
0:03:10.729,000 --> 0:03:12,000
a whole sequence of them,

70
0:03:12.843,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and that's why our full sense of self

71
0:03:15.088,000 --> 0:03:17,000
needs both immersive experience

72
0:03:18.02,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and the flow of time.

73
0:03:20.465,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Now, the flow of time is embedded in everything,

74
0:03:23.614,000 --> 0:03:25,000
in the erosion of a grain of sand,

75
0:03:26.182,000 --> 0:03:29,000
in the budding of a little bud into a rose.

76
0:03:29.974,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Without it, we would have no music.

77
0:03:32.509,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Our own emotions and state of mind

78
0:03:34.547,000 --> 0:03:36,000
often encode time,

79
0:03:36.66,000 --> 0:03:38,000
regret or nostalgia about the past,

80
0:03:39.218,000 --> 0:03:42,000
hope or dread about the future.

81
0:03:42.718,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I think that technology has altered that flow of time.

82
0:03:46.663,000 --> 0:03:48,000
The overall time that we have for our narrative,

83
0:03:49.186,000 --> 0:03:51,000
our lifespan, has been increasing,

84
0:03:51.36,000 --> 0:03:54,000
but the smallest measure, the moment, has shrunk.

85
0:03:54.477,000 --> 0:03:56,000
It has shrunk because our instruments enable us

86
0:03:56.813,000 --> 0:03:59,000
in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time,

87
0:04:00.073,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding

88
0:04:03.343,000 --> 0:04:04,000
of the material world,

89
0:04:05.216,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and this granular understanding

90
0:04:06.652,000 --> 0:04:08,000
has generated reams of data

91
0:04:08.955,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that our brains can no longer comprehend

92
0:04:11.316,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and for which we need more and more complicated computers.

93
0:04:14.751,000 --> 0:04:16,000
All of this to say that the gap

94
0:04:17.025,000 --> 0:04:19,000
between what we can perceive and what we can measure

95
0:04:19.606,000 --> 0:04:2,000
is only going to widen.

96
0:04:21.528,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Science can do things with and in a picosecond,

97
0:04:24.564,000 --> 0:04:26,000
but you and I are never going to have the inner experience

98
0:04:27.267,000 --> 0:04:3,000
of a millionth of a millionth of a second.

99
0:04:30.453,000 --> 0:04:34,000
You and I answer only to nature's rhythm and flow,

100
0:04:34.495,000 --> 0:04:36,000
to the sun, the moon and the seasons,

101
0:04:37.434,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and this is why we need that long arc of time

102
0:04:40.174,000 --> 0:04:42,000
with the past, the present and the future

103
0:04:42.403,000 --> 0:04:43,000
to see things for what they are,

104
0:04:44.167,000 --> 0:04:45,000
to separate signal from noise

105
0:04:46.01,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and the self from sensations.

106
0:04:48.566,000 --> 0:04:51,000
We need time's arrow to understand cause and effect,

107
0:04:52.175,000 --> 0:04:53,000
not just in the material world,

108
0:04:53.93,000 --> 0:04:56,000
but in our own intentions and our motivations.

109
0:04:57.22,000 --> 0:05:,000
What happens when that arrow goes awry?

110
0:05:01.21,000 --> 0:05:04,000
What happens when time warps?

111
0:05:04.694,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So many of us today have the sensation

112
0:05:06.643,000 --> 0:05:08,000
that time's arrow is pointing everywhere

113
0:05:08.887,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and nowhere at once.

114
0:05:11.152,000 --> 0:05:13,000
This is because time doesn't flow in the digital world

115
0:05:13.839,000 --> 0:05:16,000
in the same way that it does in the natural one.

116
0:05:17.828,000 --> 0:05:19,000
We all know that the Internet has shrunk space

117
0:05:20.528,000 --> 0:05:21,000
as well as time.

118
0:05:21.758,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Far away over there is now here.

119
0:05:24.071,000 --> 0:05:26,000
News from India is a stream on my smartphone app

120
0:05:26.8,000 --> 0:05:28,000
whether I'm in New York or New Delhi.

121
0:05:29.679,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And that's not all.

122
0:05:31.114,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Your last job, your dinner reservations from last year,

123
0:05:33.583,000 --> 0:05:36,000
your former friends, lie on a flat plain with today's friends,

124
0:05:36.859,000 --> 0:05:38,000
because the Internet also archives,

125
0:05:38.994,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and it warps the past.

126
0:05:40.788,000 --> 0:05:42,000
With no distinction left between the past,

127
0:05:42.938,000 --> 0:05:45,000
the present and the future, and the here or there,

128
0:05:46.21,000 --> 0:05:49,000
we are left with this moment everywhere,

129
0:05:50.026,000 --> 0:05:52,000
this moment that I'll call the digital now.

130
0:05:52.45,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Just how can we prioritize

131
0:05:54.618,000 --> 0:05:56,000
in the landscape of the digital now?

132
0:05:56.977,000 --> 0:05:57,000
This digital now is not the present,

133
0:05:58.882,000 --> 0:06:,000
because it's always a few seconds ahead,

134
0:06:00.935,000 --> 0:06:01,000
with Twitter streams that are already trending

135
0:06:02.768,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and news from other time zones.

136
0:06:04.745,000 --> 0:06:06,000
This isn't the now of a shooting pain in your foot

137
0:06:07.455,000 --> 0:06:09,000
or the second that you bite into a pastry

138
0:06:09.943,000 --> 0:06:12,000
or the three hours that you lose yourself in a great book.

139
0:06:13.28,000 --> 0:06:14,000
This now bears very little physical

140
0:06:15.132,000 --> 0:06:17,000
or psychological reference to our own state.

141
0:06:18.073,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Its focus, instead, is to distract us

142
0:06:20.333,000 --> 0:06:21,000
at every turn on the road.

143
0:06:22.283,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Every digital landmark is an invitation

144
0:06:24.454,000 --> 0:06:26,000
to leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else

145
0:06:26.869,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and do something else.

146
0:06:28.488,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Are you reading an interview by an author?

147
0:06:30.481,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Why not buy his book? Tweet it. Share it.

148
0:06:33.121,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Like it. Find other books exactly like his.

149
0:06:35.85,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Find other people reading those books.

150
0:06:38.718,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Travel can be liberating,

151
0:06:40.762,000 --> 0:06:41,000
but when it is incessant, we become

152
0:06:42.523,000 --> 0:06:44,000
permanent exiles without repose.

153
0:06:44.75,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Choice is freedom, but not when it's constantly

154
0:06:47.494,000 --> 0:06:49,000
for its own sake.

155
0:06:49.541,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Not just is the digital now far from the present,

156
0:06:52.129,000 --> 0:06:54,000
but it's in direct competition with it,

157
0:06:54.791,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and this is because not just am I absent from it,

158
0:06:57.173,000 --> 0:06:58,000
but so are you.

159
0:06:58.266,000 --> 0:07:,000
Not just are we absent from it, but so is everyone else.

160
0:07:01.057,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And therein lies its greatest convenience and horror.

161
0:07:04.747,000 --> 0:07:06,000
I can order foreign language books in the middle of the night,

162
0:07:07.575,000 --> 0:07:08,000
shop for Parisian macarons,

163
0:07:09.374,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and leave video messages that get picked up later.

164
0:07:11.831,000 --> 0:07:12,000
At all times, I can operate

165
0:07:13.806,000 --> 0:07:15,000
at a different rhythm and pace from you,

166
0:07:16.042,000 --> 0:07:17,000
while I sustain the illusion

167
0:07:17.959,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that I'm tapped into you in real time.

168
0:07:21.487,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Sandy was a reminder

169
0:07:23.096,000 --> 0:07:25,000
of how such an illusion can shatter.

170
0:07:25.201,000 --> 0:07:26,000
There were those with power and water,

171
0:07:27.065,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and those without.

172
0:07:28.561,000 --> 0:07:3,000
There are those who went back to their lives,

173
0:07:30.894,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and those who are still displaced

174
0:07:32.931,000 --> 0:07:34,000
after so many months.

175
0:07:35.286,000 --> 0:07:37,000
For some reason, technology seems to perpetuate

176
0:07:37.988,000 --> 0:07:4,000
the illusion for those who have it that everyone does,

177
0:07:41.434,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and then, like an ironic slap in the face,

178
0:07:44.062,000 --> 0:07:46,000
it makes it true.

179
0:07:46.18,000 --> 0:07:47,000
For example, it's said that there are more people

180
0:07:47.857,000 --> 0:07:5,000
in India with access to cell phones than toilets.

181
0:07:50.991,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Now if this rift, which is already so great

182
0:07:53.413,000 --> 0:07:54,000
in many parts of the world,

183
0:07:54.875,000 --> 0:07:57,000
between the lack of infrastructure and the spread of technology,

184
0:07:58.23,000 --> 0:07:59,000
isn't somehow bridged,

185
0:07:59.812,000 --> 0:08:01,000
there will be ruptures between the digital

186
0:08:01.863,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and the real.

187
0:08:04.038,000 --> 0:08:07,000
For us as individuals who live in the digital now

188
0:08:07.676,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and spend most of our waking moments in it,

189
0:08:10.155,000 --> 0:08:12,000
the challenge is to live in two streams of time

190
0:08:12.332,000 --> 0:08:14,000
that are parallel and almost simultaneous.

191
0:08:15.276,000 --> 0:08:19,000
How does one live inside distraction?

192
0:08:19.376,000 --> 0:08:2,000
We might think that those younger than us,

193
0:08:21.326,000 --> 0:08:24,000
those who are born into this, will adapt more naturally.

194
0:08:24.94,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Possibly, but I remember my childhood.

195
0:08:28.078,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I remember my grandfather revising

196
0:08:29.782,000 --> 0:08:31,000
the capitals of the world with me.

197
0:08:32.044,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Buda and Pest were separated by the Danube,

198
0:08:34.794,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and Vienna had a Spanish riding school.

199
0:08:37.569,000 --> 0:08:39,000
If I were a child today, I could easily learn this information

200
0:08:40.468,000 --> 0:08:42,000
with apps and hyperlinks,

201
0:08:42.633,000 --> 0:08:43,000
but it really wouldn't be the same,

202
0:08:44.544,000 --> 0:08:46,000
because much later, I went to Vienna,

203
0:08:46.824,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and I went to the Spanish riding school,

204
0:08:48.792,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and I could feel my grandfather right beside me.

205
0:08:52.157,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Night after night, he took me up on the terrace,

206
0:08:54.727,000 --> 0:08:56,000
on his shoulders, and pointed out Jupiter

207
0:08:57.505,000 --> 0:09:,000
and Saturn and the Great Bear to me.

208
0:09:00.733,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And even here, when I look at the Great Bear,

209
0:09:03.428,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I get back that feeling of being a child,

210
0:09:06.184,000 --> 0:09:08,000
hanging onto his head and trying to balance myself

211
0:09:08.562,000 --> 0:09:1,000
on his shoulder,

212
0:09:10.782,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and I can get back that feeling of being a child again.

213
0:09:13.982,000 --> 0:09:15,000
What I had with my grandfather was wrapped

214
0:09:16.449,000 --> 0:09:19,000
so often in information and knowledge and fact,

215
0:09:19.691,000 --> 0:09:21,000
but it was about so much more

216
0:09:21.715,000 --> 0:09:24,000
than information or knowledge or fact.

217
0:09:25.505,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Time-warping technology challenges

218
0:09:27.629,000 --> 0:09:28,000
our deepest core,

219
0:09:29.581,000 --> 0:09:32,000
because we are able to archive the past

220
0:09:33.348,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and some of it becomes hard to forget,

221
0:09:36.589,000 --> 0:09:38,000
even as the current moment

222
0:09:39.193,000 --> 0:09:41,000
is increasingly unmemorable.

223
0:09:41.812,000 --> 0:09:43,000
We want to clutch, and we are left instead

224
0:09:44.552,000 --> 0:09:46,000
clutching at a series of static moments.

225
0:09:47.015,000 --> 0:09:49,000
They're like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them.

226
0:09:49.721,000 --> 0:09:51,000
By archiving everything, we think that we can store it,

227
0:09:52.514,000 --> 0:09:53,000
but time is not data.

228
0:09:54.479,000 --> 0:09:56,000
It cannot be stored.

229
0:09:56.612,000 --> 0:09:58,000
You and I know exactly what it means like

230
0:09:58.628,000 --> 0:09:59,000
to be truly present in a moment.

231
0:10:00.532,000 --> 0:10:01,000
It might have happened while we were

232
0:10:01.749,000 --> 0:10:02,000
playing an instrument,

233
0:10:03.508,000 --> 0:10:04,000
or looking into the eyes of someone we've known

234
0:10:05.356,000 --> 0:10:07,000
for a very long time.

235
0:10:07.54,000 --> 0:10:1,000
At such moments, our selves are complete.

236
0:10:10.571,000 --> 0:10:12,000
The self that lives in the long narrative arc

237
0:10:12.639,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and the self that experiences the moment

238
0:10:14.722,000 --> 0:10:15,000
become one.

239
0:10:16.114,000 --> 0:10:17,000
The present encapsulates the past

240
0:10:18.056,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and a promise for the future.

241
0:10:20.487,000 --> 0:10:21,000
The present joins a flow of time

242
0:10:22.455,000 --> 0:10:24,000
from before and after.

243
0:10:24.698,000 --> 0:10:27,000
I first experienced these feelings with my grandmother.

244
0:10:28.255,000 --> 0:10:3,000
I wanted to learn to skip, and she found an old rope

245
0:10:30.594,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and she tucked up her sari

246
0:10:31.946,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and she jumped over it.

247
0:10:33.674,000 --> 0:10:35,000
I wanted to learn to cook, and she kept me in the kitchen,

248
0:10:36.328,000 --> 0:10:4,000
cutting, cubing and chopping for a whole month.

249
0:10:40.436,000 --> 0:10:42,000
My grandmother taught me that things happen

250
0:10:42.843,000 --> 0:10:45,000
in the time they take, that time can't be fought,

251
0:10:46.564,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and because it will pass and it will move,

252
0:10:48.397,000 --> 0:10:51,000
we owe the present moment our full attention.

253
0:10:51.511,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Attention is time.

254
0:10:54.155,000 --> 0:10:56,000
One of my yoga instructors once said

255
0:10:56.338,000 --> 0:10:58,000
that love is attention,

256
0:10:58.581,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and definitely from my grandmother,

257
0:11:00.415,000 --> 0:11:04,000
love and attention were one and the same thing.

258
0:11:04.741,000 --> 0:11:06,000
The digital world cannibalizes time,

259
0:11:07.324,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and in doing so, I want to suggest

260
0:11:10.704,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that what it threatens

261
0:11:12.378,000 --> 0:11:14,000
is the completeness of ourselves.

262
0:11:14.808,000 --> 0:11:16,000
It threatens the flow of love.

263
0:11:17.166,000 --> 0:11:19,000
But we don't need to let it.

264
0:11:19.187,000 --> 0:11:2,000
We can choose otherwise.

265
0:11:20.655,000 --> 0:11:22,000
We've seen again and again

266
0:11:22.732,000 --> 0:11:24,000
just how creative technology can be,

267
0:11:24.962,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and in our lives and in our actions,

268
0:11:27.202,000 --> 0:11:3,000
we can choose those solutions and those innovations

269
0:11:31.191,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and those moments that restore the flow of time

270
0:11:34.299,000 --> 0:11:37,000
instead of fragmenting it.

271
0:11:37.92,000 --> 0:11:39,000
We can slow down and we can tune in

272
0:11:40.5,000 --> 0:11:42,000
to the ebb and flow of time.

273
0:11:43.172,000 --> 0:11:46,000
We can choose to take time back.

274
0:11:47.12,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Thank you.

275
0:11:49.32,000 --> 0:11:53,000
(Applause)

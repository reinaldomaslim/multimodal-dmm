1
0:00:12.136,000 --> 0:00:15,000
This talk contains mature language Viewer discretion is advised

2
0:00:17.293,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Let's get this out of the way.

3
0:00:20.15,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I'm here because I wrote a book about civility,

4
0:00:24.374,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and because that book came out

5
0:00:26.742,000 --> 0:00:29,000
right around the 2016 American presidential election,

6
0:00:30.735,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I started getting lots of invitations to come and talk about civility

7
0:00:36.411,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and why we need more of it in American politics.

8
0:00:40.38,000 --> 0:00:41,000
So great.

9
0:00:42.737,000 --> 0:00:46,000
The only problem was that I had written that book about civility

10
0:00:46.817,000 --> 0:00:5,000
because I was convinced that civility is ...

11
0:00:52.222,000 --> 0:00:53,000
bullshit.

12
0:00:53.404,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:55.476,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Now, that may sound like a highly uncivil thing to say,

14
0:00:58.549,000 --> 0:01:,000
and lucky for you, and for my publisher,

15
0:01:01.041,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I did eventually come to change my mind.

16
0:01:03.824,000 --> 0:01:05,000
In the course of writing that book

17
0:01:05.851,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and studying the long history of civility and religious tolerance

18
0:01:09.534,000 --> 0:01:1,000
in the 17th century,

19
0:01:11.288,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I came to discover that there is a virtue of civility,

20
0:01:16.146,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and far from being bullshit, it's actually absolutely essential,

21
0:01:20.067,000 --> 0:01:22,000
especially for tolerant societies,

22
0:01:22.148,000 --> 0:01:27,000
so societies like this one, that promise not only to protect diversity

23
0:01:27.521,000 --> 0:01:31,000
but also the heated and sometimes even hateful disagreements

24
0:01:32.411,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that that diversity inspires.

25
0:01:35.4,000 --> 0:01:37,000
You see, the thing about disagreement

26
0:01:37.572,000 --> 0:01:39,000
is that there is a reason

27
0:01:39.948,000 --> 0:01:42,000
that "disagreeable" is a synonym for "unpleasant."

28
0:01:44.337,000 --> 0:01:46,000
As the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes pointed out

29
0:01:47.219,000 --> 0:01:49,000
all the way back in 1642,

30
0:01:49.984,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that's because the mere act of disagreement is offensive.

31
0:01:55.972,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And Hobbes is still right. It works like this:

32
0:01:58.45,000 --> 0:02:,000
so, if you and I disagree,

33
0:02:01.37,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and I'm right, because I always am,

34
0:02:04.672,000 --> 0:02:09,000
how am I to make sense of the fact that you are so very, very wrong?

35
0:02:10.488,000 --> 0:02:13,000
It couldn't possibly be that you've just come to a different conclusion

36
0:02:13.939,000 --> 0:02:14,000
in good faith?

37
0:02:15.114,000 --> 0:02:18,000
No, you must be up to something, you must be stupid,

38
0:02:18.224,000 --> 0:02:2,000
bigoted, interested.

39
0:02:20.282,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Maybe you're insane.

40
0:02:21.65,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And the same goes the other way. Right?

41
0:02:23.64,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So the mere fact of your disagreeing with me

42
0:02:27.09,000 --> 0:02:32,000
is implicitly an insult not only to my views, but to my intelligence, too.

43
0:02:32.852,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And things only get worse when the disagreements at stake

44
0:02:36.256,000 --> 0:02:38,000
are the ones that we somehow consider to be fundamental,

45
0:02:39.217,000 --> 0:02:42,000
whether to our worldviews or to our identities.

46
0:02:42.666,000 --> 0:02:44,000
You know the kinds of disagreement I mean.

47
0:02:45.254,000 --> 0:02:47,000
One doesn't discuss religion or politics

48
0:02:47.932,000 --> 0:02:51,000
or increasingly, the politics of popular culture, at the dinner table,

49
0:02:52.257,000 --> 0:02:53,000
because these are the disagreements,

50
0:02:54.026,000 --> 0:02:57,000
these are the things that people really, seriously disagree about,

51
0:02:57.512,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and they define themselves against their opponents in the controversy.

52
0:03:03.535,000 --> 0:03:06,000
But of course those fundamental disagreements

53
0:03:06.718,000 --> 0:03:08,000
are precisely the ones that tolerant societies

54
0:03:09.684,000 --> 0:03:12,000
like the United States propose to tolerate,

55
0:03:13.419,000 --> 0:03:16,000
which perhaps explains why, historically, at least,

56
0:03:17.085,000 --> 0:03:21,000
tolerant societies haven't been the happy-clappy communities of difference

57
0:03:21.721,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that you sometimes hear about.

58
0:03:23.649,000 --> 0:03:27,000
No, they tend to be places where people have to hold their noses

59
0:03:28.249,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and rub along together despite their mutual contempt.

60
0:03:32.282,000 --> 0:03:34,000
That's what I learned from studying religious tolerance

61
0:03:34.948,000 --> 0:03:36,000
in early modern England and America.

62
0:03:37.521,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And I also learned that the virtue that makes

63
0:03:40.815,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that un-murderous coexistence, if you will, possible,

64
0:03:46.703,000 --> 0:03:47,000
is the virtue of civility,

65
0:03:48.648,000 --> 0:03:52,000
because civility makes our disagreements tolerable

66
0:03:53.101,000 --> 0:03:59,000
so that we can share a life together even if we don't share a faith --

67
0:03:59.945,000 --> 0:04:01,000
religious, political or otherwise.

68
0:04:03.838,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Still, I couldn't help but notice

69
0:04:06.926,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that when most people talk about civility today --

70
0:04:09.974,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and boy, do they talk about civility a lot --

71
0:04:12.919,000 --> 0:04:13,000
they seem to have something else in mind.

72
0:04:14.942,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So if civility is the virtue that makes it possible to tolerate disagreement

73
0:04:19.316,000 --> 0:04:22,000
so that we can actually engage with our opponents,

74
0:04:22.356,000 --> 0:04:23,000
talking about civility

75
0:04:24.055,000 --> 0:04:26,000
seems to be mainly a strategy of disengagement.

76
0:04:27.839,000 --> 0:04:3,000
It's a little bit like threatening to take your ball and go home

77
0:04:31.324,000 --> 0:04:33,000
when the game isn't going your way.

78
0:04:33.91,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Because the funny thing about incivility

79
0:04:36.023,000 --> 0:04:39,000
is that it's always the sin of our opponents.

80
0:04:40.044,000 --> 0:04:41,000
It's funny.

81
0:04:41.428,000 --> 0:04:42,000
When it comes to our own bad behavior,

82
0:04:43.313,000 --> 0:04:46,000
well, we seem to develop sudden-onset amnesia,

83
0:04:46.794,000 --> 0:04:51,000
or we can always justify it as an appropriate response

84
0:04:51.945,000 --> 0:04:53,000
to the latest outrage from our opponents.

85
0:04:54.771,000 --> 0:04:58,000
So, "How can I be civil to someone who is set out to destroy

86
0:04:59.264,000 --> 0:05:,000
everything I stand for?

87
0:05:00.855,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And by the way, they started it."

88
0:05:03.423,000 --> 0:05:04,000
It's all terrifically convenient.

89
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Also convenient is the fact that most of today's big civility talkers

90
0:05:11.478,000 --> 0:05:13,000
tend to be quite vague and fuzzy

91
0:05:13.927,000 --> 0:05:16,000
when it comes to what they think civility actually entails.

92
0:05:17.948,000 --> 0:05:21,000
We're told that civility is simply a synonym for respect,

93
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
for good manners, for politeness,

94
0:05:25.138,000 --> 0:05:3,000
but at the same time, it's clear that to accuse someone of incivility

95
0:05:30.181,000 --> 0:05:33,000
is much, much worse than calling them impolite,

96
0:05:34.134,000 --> 0:05:39,000
because to be uncivil is to be potentially intolerable

97
0:05:39.481,000 --> 0:05:42,000
in a way that merely being rude isn't.

98
0:05:42.561,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So to call someone uncivil, to accuse them of incivility,

99
0:05:46.593,000 --> 0:05:5,000
is a way of communicating that they are somehow beyond the pale,

100
0:05:51.244,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that they're not worth engaging with at all.

101
0:05:55.82,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So here's the thing:

102
0:05:58.135,000 --> 0:06:,000
civility isn't bullshit,

103
0:06:00.565,000 --> 0:06:04,000
it's precious because it's the virtue that makes fundamental disagreement

104
0:06:06.554,000 --> 0:06:08,000
not only possible but even sometimes occasionally productive.

105
0:06:10.412,000 --> 0:06:12,000
It's precious, but it's also really, really difficult.

106
0:06:15.058,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Civility talk, on the other hand,

107
0:06:17.718,000 --> 0:06:19,000
well, that's really easy,

108
0:06:20.599,000 --> 0:06:21,000
really easy,

109
0:06:22.007,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and it also is almost always complete bullshit,

110
0:06:26.919,000 --> 0:06:29,000
which makes things slightly awkward for me

111
0:06:30.316,000 --> 0:06:32,000
as I continue to talk to you about civility.

112
0:06:33.165,000 --> 0:06:34,000
(Laughter)

113
0:06:34.801,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Anyway, we tend to forget it,

114
0:06:38.413,000 --> 0:06:41,000
but politicians and intellectuals have been warning us for decades now

115
0:06:41.964,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that the United States is facing a crisis of civility,

116
0:06:44.584,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and they've tended to blame that crisis on technological developments,

117
0:06:47.93,000 --> 0:06:51,000
on things like cable TV, talk radio, social media.

118
0:06:52.002,000 --> 0:06:53,000
But any historian will tell you

119
0:06:53.571,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that there never was a golden age of disagreement,

120
0:06:55.944,000 --> 0:06:56,000
let alone good feelings,

121
0:06:57.494,000 --> 0:06:58,000
not in American politics.

122
0:06:59.352,000 --> 0:07:02,000
In my book, though, I argue that the first modern crisis of civility

123
0:07:02.917,000 --> 0:07:04,000
actually began about 500 years ago,

124
0:07:05.761,000 --> 0:07:08,000
when a certain professor of theology named Martin Luther

125
0:07:09.41,000 --> 0:07:12,000
took advantage of a recent advancement in communications technology,

126
0:07:13.125,000 --> 0:07:14,000
the printing press,

127
0:07:14.403,000 --> 0:07:17,000
to call the Pope the Antichrist,

128
0:07:18.768,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and thus inadvertently launch the Protestant Reformation.

129
0:07:22.174,000 --> 0:07:26,000
So think of the press, if you will, as the Twitter of the 16th century,

130
0:07:26.483,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and Martin Luther as the original troll.

131
0:07:29.087,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And I'm not exaggerating here.

132
0:07:31.256,000 --> 0:07:34,000
He once declared himself unable to pray

133
0:07:34.63,000 --> 0:07:36,000
without at the same time cursing

134
0:07:36.789,000 --> 0:07:39,000
his "anti-Christian," i.e. Catholic, opponents.

135
0:07:40.171,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And of course, those Catholic opponents clutched their pearls

136
0:07:43.113,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and called for civility then, too,

137
0:07:44.822,000 --> 0:07:46,000
but all the while, they gave as good as they got

138
0:07:47.156,000 --> 0:07:48,000
with traditional slurs like "heretic,"

139
0:07:49.022,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and, worst of all, "Protestant,"

140
0:07:52.262,000 --> 0:07:55,000
which began in the 16th century as an insult.

141
0:07:57.377,000 --> 0:08:,000
The thing about civility talk, then as now,

142
0:08:00.524,000 --> 0:08:04,000
was that you could call out your opponent for going low,

143
0:08:05.525,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and then take advantage of the moral high ground

144
0:08:07.796,000 --> 0:08:09,000
to go as low or lower,

145
0:08:10.168,000 --> 0:08:12,000
because calling for civility sets up the speaker

146
0:08:12.46,000 --> 0:08:15,000
as a model of decorum while implicitly, subtly stigmatizing

147
0:08:16.271,000 --> 0:08:18,000
anyone with the temerity to disagree as uncivil.

148
0:08:20.433,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And so civility talk in the 17th century becomes a really effective way

149
0:08:24.989,000 --> 0:08:26,000
for members of the religious establishment

150
0:08:27.149,000 --> 0:08:32,000
to silence, suppress, exclude dissenters outside of the established church,

151
0:08:32.42,000 --> 0:08:34,000
especially when they spoke out against the status quo.

152
0:08:35.329,000 --> 0:08:37,000
So Anglican ministers could lecture atheists

153
0:08:37.729,000 --> 0:08:39,000
on the offensiveness of their discourse.

154
0:08:40.1,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Everyone could complain about the Quakers

155
0:08:42.45,000 --> 0:08:44,000
for refusing to doff and don their hats

156
0:08:44.641,000 --> 0:08:47,000
or their "uncouth" practice of shaking hands.

157
0:08:48.601,000 --> 0:08:5,000
But those accusations of incivility

158
0:08:50.84,000 --> 0:08:52,000
pretty soon became pretexts for persecution.

159
0:08:54.738,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So far, so familiar, right?

160
0:08:57.112,000 --> 0:08:59,000
We see that strategy again and again.

161
0:08:59.699,000 --> 0:09:04,000
It's used to silence civil rights protesters in the 20th century.

162
0:09:04.802,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And I think it explains why partisans on both sides of the aisle

163
0:09:08.938,000 --> 0:09:1,000
keep reaching for this, frankly, antiquated,

164
0:09:11.572,000 --> 0:09:13,000
early modern language of civility

165
0:09:14.256,000 --> 0:09:18,000
precisely when they want to communicate that certain people and certain views

166
0:09:18.481,000 --> 0:09:2,000
are beyond the pale,

167
0:09:20.598,000 --> 0:09:22,000
but they want to save themselves the trouble

168
0:09:22.741,000 --> 0:09:24,000
of actually making an argument.

169
0:09:25.067,000 --> 0:09:28,000
So no wonder skeptics like me tend to roll our eyes

170
0:09:28.559,000 --> 0:09:3,000
when the calls for conversational virtue begin,

171
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
because instead of healing our social and political divisions,

172
0:09:34.298,000 --> 0:09:37,000
it seems like so much civility talk is actually making the problem worse.

173
0:09:37.813,000 --> 0:09:4,000
It's saving us the trouble of actually speaking to each other,

174
0:09:41.258,000 --> 0:09:44,000
allowing us to speak past each other or at each other

175
0:09:45.219,000 --> 0:09:47,000
while signaling our superior virtue

176
0:09:47.638,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and letting the audience know which side we're on.

177
0:09:51.388,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And given this, I think one might be forgiven, as I did,

178
0:09:55.54,000 --> 0:09:58,000
for assuming that because so much civility talk is bullshit,

179
0:09:58.723,000 --> 0:10:,000
well then, the virtue of civility must be bullshit, too.

180
0:10:02.675,000 --> 0:10:05,000
But here, again, I think a little historical perspective goes a long way.

181
0:10:06.424,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Because remember, the same early modern crisis of civility

182
0:10:09.855,000 --> 0:10:1,000
that launched the Reformation

183
0:10:11.838,000 --> 0:10:13,000
also gave birth to tolerant societies,

184
0:10:14.623,000 --> 0:10:16,000
places like Rhode Island, Pennsylvania,

185
0:10:17.322,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and indeed, eventually the United States,

186
0:10:19.966,000 --> 0:10:23,000
places that at least aspired to protect disagreement

187
0:10:24.855,000 --> 0:10:25,000
as well as diversity,

188
0:10:27.997,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and what made that possible was the virtue of civility.

189
0:10:33.401,000 --> 0:10:34,000
What made disagreement tolerable,

190
0:10:35.148,000 --> 0:10:37,000
what it made it possible for us to share a life,

191
0:10:38.089,000 --> 0:10:4,000
even when we didn't share a faith,

192
0:10:40.493,000 --> 0:10:41,000
was a virtue,

193
0:10:42.327,000 --> 0:10:45,000
but one, I think, that is perhaps less aspirational

194
0:10:45.581,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and a lot more confrontational

195
0:10:47.534,000 --> 0:10:5,000
than the one that people who talk about civility a lot today

196
0:10:51.193,000 --> 0:10:52,000
tend to have in mind.

197
0:10:52.519,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So I like to call that virtue "mere civility."

198
0:10:57.288,000 --> 0:11:,000
You may know it as the virtue that allows us to get through

199
0:11:01.162,000 --> 0:11:03,000
our relations with an ex-spouse,

200
0:11:03.622,000 --> 0:11:04,000
or a bad neighbor,

201
0:11:05.154,000 --> 0:11:07,000
not to mention a member of the other party.

202
0:11:07.973,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Because to be merely civil is to meet a low bar grudgingly,

203
0:11:14.289,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and that, again, makes sense,

204
0:11:15.989,000 --> 0:11:18,000
because civility is a virtue that's meant to help us disagree,

205
0:11:19.696,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and as Hobbes told us all those centuries ago,

206
0:11:22.735,000 --> 0:11:25,000
disagreeable means unpleasant for a reason.

207
0:11:28.576,000 --> 0:11:33,000
But if it isn't bullshit, what exactly is civility or mere civility?

208
0:11:33.61,000 --> 0:11:34,000
What does it require?

209
0:11:35.575,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Well, to start, it is not and cannot be

210
0:11:40.06,000 --> 0:11:43,000
the same thing as being respectful or polite,

211
0:11:43.758,000 --> 0:11:46,000
because we need civility precisely when we're dealing with those people

212
0:11:47.148,000 --> 0:11:51,000
that we find it the most difficult, or maybe even impossible, to respect.

213
0:11:52.401,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Similarly, being civil can't be the same as being nice,

214
0:11:55.537,000 --> 0:12:01,000
because being nice means not telling people what you really think about them

215
0:12:01.704,000 --> 0:12:03,000
or their wrong, wrong views.

216
0:12:04.948,000 --> 0:12:07,000
No, being civil means speaking your mind,

217
0:12:10.008,000 --> 0:12:13,000
but to your opponent's face,

218
0:12:13.413,000 --> 0:12:14,000
not behind her back.

219
0:12:16.13,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Being merely civil means not pulling our punches,

220
0:12:20.821,000 --> 0:12:23,000
but at the same time, it means maybe not landing all those punches all at once,

221
0:12:24.625,000 --> 0:12:26,000
because the point of mere civility

222
0:12:27.13,000 --> 0:12:31,000
is to allow us to disagree, to disagree fundamentally,

223
0:12:31.236,000 --> 0:12:37,000
but to do so without denying or destroying the possibility of a common life tomorrow

224
0:12:37.784,000 --> 0:12:4,000
with the people that we think are standing in our way today.

225
0:12:42.768,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And in that sense, I think civility is actually closely related

226
0:12:45.896,000 --> 0:12:47,000
to another virtue, the virtue of courage.

227
0:12:48.229,000 --> 0:12:54,000
So mere civility is having the courage to make yourself disagreeable,

228
0:12:54.642,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and to stay that way,

229
0:12:56.539,000 --> 0:12:59,000
but to do so while staying in the room

230
0:13:00.062,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and staying present to your opponents.

231
0:13:03.745,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And it also means that, sometimes, calling bullshit on people's civility talk

232
0:13:08.452,000 --> 0:13:1,000
is really the only civil thing to do.

233
0:13:11.133,000 --> 0:13:12,000
At least that's what I think.

234
0:13:13.934,000 --> 0:13:17,000
But look, if I've learned anything from studying the long history

235
0:13:18.03,000 --> 0:13:2,000
of religious tolerance in the 17th century, it's this:

236
0:13:21.905,000 --> 0:13:25,000
if you're talking about civility as a way to avoid an argument,

237
0:13:26.793,000 --> 0:13:29,000
to isolate yourself in the more agreeable company

238
0:13:30.745,000 --> 0:13:32,000
of the like-minded who already agree with you,

239
0:13:34.433,000 --> 0:13:37,000
if you find yourself never actually speaking to anyone

240
0:13:38.156,000 --> 0:13:42,000
who really, truly, fundamentally disagrees with you,

241
0:13:42.663,000 --> 0:13:44,000
well, you're doing civility wrong.

242
0:13:47.091,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Thank you.

243
0:13:48.266,000 --> 0:13:52,000
(Applause)

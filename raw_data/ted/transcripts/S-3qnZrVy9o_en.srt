1
0:00:12.856,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I would like to begin with a little experiment.

2
0:00:15.555,000 --> 0:00:18,000
In a moment, I'm going to ask if you would close your eyes

3
0:00:18.67,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and see if you can work out

4
0:00:20.166,000 --> 0:00:22,000
what emotions you're feeling right now.

5
0:00:23.1,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Now, you're not going to tell anyone or anything.

6
0:00:25.436,000 --> 0:00:29,000
The idea is to see how easy or perhaps hard you find it

7
0:00:29.887,000 --> 0:00:31,000
to pinpoint exactly what you're feeling.

8
0:00:32.503,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And I thought I'd give you 10 seconds to do this.

9
0:00:35.968,000 --> 0:00:36,000
OK?

10
0:00:37.436,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Right, let's start.

11
0:00:48.15,000 --> 0:00:49,000
OK, that's it, time's up.

12
0:00:49.551,000 --> 0:00:5,000
How did it go?

13
0:00:51.113,000 --> 0:00:53,000
You were probably feeling a little bit under pressure,

14
0:00:53.705,000 --> 0:00:55,000
maybe suspicious of the person next to you.

15
0:00:55.895,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Did they definitely have their eyes closed?

16
0:00:58.642,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Perhaps you felt some strange, distant worry

17
0:01:01.876,000 --> 0:01:03,000
about that email you sent this morning

18
0:01:04.23,000 --> 0:01:07,000
or excitement about something you've got planned for this evening.

19
0:01:07.408,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Maybe you felt that exhilaration that comes when we get together

20
0:01:10.577,000 --> 0:01:11,000
in big groups of people like this;

21
0:01:12.344,000 --> 0:01:14,000
the Welsh called it "hwyl,"

22
0:01:14.536,000 --> 0:01:16,000
from the word for boat sails.

23
0:01:17.66,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Or maybe you felt all of these things.

24
0:01:20.338,000 --> 0:01:23,000
There are some emotions which wash the world in a single color,

25
0:01:23.787,000 --> 0:01:26,000
like the terror felt as a car skids.

26
0:01:27.344,000 --> 0:01:29,000
But more often, our emotions crowd and jostle together

27
0:01:29.966,000 --> 0:01:31,000
until it is actually quite hard to tell them apart.

28
0:01:33.351,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Some slide past so quickly you'd hardly even notice them,

29
0:01:37.166,000 --> 0:01:39,000
like the nostalgia that will make you reach out

30
0:01:39.618,000 --> 0:01:41,000
to grab a familiar brand in the supermarket.

31
0:01:42.949,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And then there are others that we hurry away from,

32
0:01:45.375,000 --> 0:01:46,000
fearing that they'll burst on us,

33
0:01:47.956,000 --> 0:01:5,000
like the jealousy that causes you to search a loved one's pockets.

34
0:01:52.86,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And of course, there are some emotions which are so peculiar,

35
0:01:55.792,000 --> 0:01:57,000
you might not even know what to call them.

36
0:01:57.891,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Perhaps sitting there, you had a little tingle of a desire

37
0:02:00.794,000 --> 0:02:04,000
for an emotion one eminent French sociologist called "ilinx,"

38
0:02:05.136,000 --> 0:02:08,000
the delirium that comes with minor acts of chaos.

39
0:02:08.686,000 --> 0:02:11,000
For example, if you stood up right now and emptied the contents of your bag

40
0:02:12.36,000 --> 0:02:13,000
all over the floor.

41
0:02:13.58,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Perhaps you experienced one of those odd, untranslatable emotions

42
0:02:17.531,000 --> 0:02:19,000
for which there's no obvious English equivalent.

43
0:02:20.34,000 --> 0:02:23,000
You might have felt the feeling the Dutch called "gezelligheid,"

44
0:02:23.649,000 --> 0:02:27,000
being cozy and warm inside with friends when it's cold and damp outside.

45
0:02:28.273,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Maybe if you were really lucky,

46
0:02:30.613,000 --> 0:02:31,000
you felt this:

47
0:02:32.358,000 --> 0:02:33,000
"basorexia,"

48
0:02:33.729,000 --> 0:02:35,000
a sudden urge to kiss someone.

49
0:02:35.79,000 --> 0:02:37,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:38.799,000 --> 0:02:39,000
We live in an age

51
0:02:40.626,000 --> 0:02:44,000
when knowledge of emotions is an extremely important commodity,

52
0:02:45.53,000 --> 0:02:48,000
where emotions are used to explain many things,

53
0:02:49.192,000 --> 0:02:5,000
exploited by our politicians,

54
0:02:51.133,000 --> 0:02:53,000
manipulated by algorithms.

55
0:02:53.288,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Emotional intelligence, which is the skill of being able to recognize and name

56
0:02:58.162,000 --> 0:03:,000
your own emotions and those of other people,

57
0:03:00.662,000 --> 0:03:04,000
is considered so important, that this is taught in our schools and businesses

58
0:03:04.873,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and encouraged by our health services.

59
0:03:07.962,000 --> 0:03:08,000
But despite all of this,

60
0:03:09.809,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I sometimes wonder

61
0:03:11.012,000 --> 0:03:14,000
if the way we think about emotions is becoming impoverished.

62
0:03:15.491,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Sometimes, we're not even that clear what an emotion even is.

63
0:03:21.509,000 --> 0:03:22,000
You've probably heard the theory

64
0:03:23.479,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that our entire emotional lives can be boiled down

65
0:03:26.087,000 --> 0:03:29,000
to a handful of basic emotions.

66
0:03:29.345,000 --> 0:03:31,000
This idea is actually about 2,000 years old,

67
0:03:31.834,000 --> 0:03:32,000
but in our own time,

68
0:03:33.022,000 --> 0:03:37,000
some evolutionary psychologists have suggested that these six emotions --

69
0:03:37.311,000 --> 0:03:41,000
happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, anger, surprise --

70
0:03:42.089,000 --> 0:03:45,000
are expressed by everyone across the globe in exactly the same way,

71
0:03:45.652,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and therefore represent the building blocks

72
0:03:48.359,000 --> 0:03:5,000
of our entire emotional lives.

73
0:03:51.042,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Well, if you look at an emotion like this,

74
0:03:53.233,000 --> 0:03:55,000
then it looks like a simple reflex:

75
0:03:55.386,000 --> 0:03:57,000
it's triggered by an external predicament,

76
0:03:57.646,000 --> 0:03:58,000
it's hardwired,

77
0:03:59.451,000 --> 0:04:01,000
it's there to protect us from harm.

78
0:04:02.073,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So you see a bear, your heart rate quickens,

79
0:04:04.561,000 --> 0:04:08,000
your pupils dilate, you feel frightened, you run very, very fast.

80
0:04:09.878,000 --> 0:04:11,000
The problem with this picture is,

81
0:04:11.989,000 --> 0:04:15,000
it doesn't entirely capture what an emotion is.

82
0:04:16.592,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Of course, the physiology is extremely important,

83
0:04:19.574,000 --> 0:04:22,000
but it's not the only reason why we feel the way we do

84
0:04:22.749,000 --> 0:04:23,000
at any given moment.

85
0:04:26.102,000 --> 0:04:28,000
What if I was to tell you that in the 12th century,

86
0:04:29.104,000 --> 0:04:32,000
some troubadours didn't see yawning

87
0:04:32.88,000 --> 0:04:35,000
as caused by tiredness or boredom like we do today,

88
0:04:36.654,000 --> 0:04:39,000
but thought it a symbol of the deepest love?

89
0:04:40.907,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Or that in that same period, brave men -- knights --

90
0:04:45.17,000 --> 0:04:48,000
commonly fainted out of dismay?

91
0:04:49.474,000 --> 0:04:5,000
What if I was to tell you

92
0:04:50.74,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that some early Christians who lived in the desert

93
0:04:53.527,000 --> 0:04:56,000
believed that flying demons who mainly came out at lunchtime

94
0:04:57.439,000 --> 0:05:01,000
could infect them with an emotion they called "accidie,"

95
0:05:02.325,000 --> 0:05:04,000
a kind of lethargy that was sometimes so intense

96
0:05:04.943,000 --> 0:05:05,000
it could even kill them?

97
0:05:07.234,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Or that boredom, as we know and love it today,

98
0:05:11.394,000 --> 0:05:14,000
was first really only felt by the Victorians,

99
0:05:14.445,000 --> 0:05:19,000
in response to new ideas about leisure time and self-improvement?

100
0:05:20.57,000 --> 0:05:21,000
What if we were to think again

101
0:05:22.094,000 --> 0:05:24,000
about those odd, untranslatable words for emotions

102
0:05:24.936,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and wonder whether some cultures might feel an emotion more intensely

103
0:05:29.19,000 --> 0:05:32,000
just because they've bothered to name and talk about it,

104
0:05:33.01,000 --> 0:05:35,000
like the Russian "toska,"

105
0:05:35.503,000 --> 0:05:37,000
a feeling of maddening dissatisfaction

106
0:05:38.234,000 --> 0:05:4,000
said to blow in from the great plains.

107
0:05:43.111,000 --> 0:05:46,000
The most recent developments in cognitive science show

108
0:05:47.1,000 --> 0:05:5,000
that emotions are not simple reflexes,

109
0:05:50.515,000 --> 0:05:53,000
but immensely complex, elastic systems

110
0:05:53.649,000 --> 0:05:56,000
that respond both to the biologies that we've inherited

111
0:05:56.821,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and to the cultures that we live in now.

112
0:05:59.494,000 --> 0:06:01,000
They are cognitive phenomena.

113
0:06:01.614,000 --> 0:06:03,000
They're shaped not just by our bodies, but by our thoughts,

114
0:06:04.587,000 --> 0:06:06,000
our concepts, our language.

115
0:06:07.979,000 --> 0:06:11,000
The neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett has become very interested

116
0:06:12.433,000 --> 0:06:15,000
in this dynamic relationship between words and emotions.

117
0:06:16.558,000 --> 0:06:19,000
She argues that when we learn a new word for an emotion,

118
0:06:20.035,000 --> 0:06:22,000
new feelings are sure to follow.

119
0:06:24.272,000 --> 0:06:27,000
As a historian, I've long suspected that as language changes,

120
0:06:28.276,000 --> 0:06:29,000
our emotions do, too.

121
0:06:30.527,000 --> 0:06:33,000
When we look to the past, it's easy to see that emotions have changed,

122
0:06:34.45,000 --> 0:06:35,000
sometimes very dramatically,

123
0:06:36.398,000 --> 0:06:39,000
in response to new cultural expectations and religious beliefs,

124
0:06:39.915,000 --> 0:06:42,000
new ideas about gender, ethnicity and age,

125
0:06:43.065,000 --> 0:06:47,000
even in response to new political and economic ideologies.

126
0:06:48.106,000 --> 0:06:51,000
There is a historicity to emotions

127
0:06:51.528,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that we are only recently starting to understand.

128
0:06:56.228,000 --> 0:07:,000
So I agree absolutely that it does us good to learn new words for emotions,

129
0:07:00.423,000 --> 0:07:02,000
but I think we need to go further.

130
0:07:02.843,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I think to be truly emotionally intelligent,

131
0:07:05.541,000 --> 0:07:09,000
we need to understand where those words have come from,

132
0:07:09.877,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and what ideas about how we ought to live and behave

133
0:07:14.079,000 --> 0:07:16,000
they are smuggling along with them.

134
0:07:17.753,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Let me tell you a story.

135
0:07:19.582,000 --> 0:07:23,000
It begins in a garret in the late 17th century,

136
0:07:23.736,000 --> 0:07:25,000
in the Swiss university town of Basel.

137
0:07:26.286,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Inside, there's a dedicated student living some 60 miles away from home.

138
0:07:31.975,000 --> 0:07:32,000
He stops turning up to his lectures,

139
0:07:33.791,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and his friends come to visit and they find him dejected and feverish,

140
0:07:38.535,000 --> 0:07:39,000
having heart palpitations,

141
0:07:40.425,000 --> 0:07:42,000
strange sores breaking out on his body.

142
0:07:43.338,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Doctors are called,

143
0:07:44.526,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and they think it's so serious that prayers are said for him

144
0:07:47.429,000 --> 0:07:48,000
in the local church.

145
0:07:48.609,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And it's only when they're preparing to return this young man home

146
0:07:51.838,000 --> 0:07:52,000
so that he can die,

147
0:07:53.054,000 --> 0:07:54,000
that they realize what's going on,

148
0:07:54.809,000 --> 0:07:56,000
because once they lift him onto the stretcher,

149
0:07:57.08,000 --> 0:07:58,000
his breathing becomes less labored.

150
0:07:58.801,000 --> 0:08:,000
And by the time he's got to the gates of his hometown,

151
0:08:01.62,000 --> 0:08:03,000
he's almost entirely recovered.

152
0:08:04.186,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And that's when they realize

153
0:08:05.623,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that he's been suffering from a very powerful form of homesickness.

154
0:08:09.812,000 --> 0:08:11,000
It's so powerful, that it might have killed him.

155
0:08:13.347,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Well, in 1688, a young doctor, Johannes Hofer,

156
0:08:16.639,000 --> 0:08:18,000
heard of this case and others like it

157
0:08:18.695,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and christened the illness "nostalgia."

158
0:08:22.843,000 --> 0:08:25,000
The diagnosis quickly caught on in medical circles around Europe.

159
0:08:26.347,000 --> 0:08:28,000
The English actually thought they were probably immune

160
0:08:28.943,000 --> 0:08:3,000
because of all the travel they did in the empire and so on.

161
0:08:31.802,000 --> 0:08:33,000
But soon there were cases cropping up in Britain, too.

162
0:08:34.374,000 --> 0:08:36,000
The last person to die from nostalgia

163
0:08:37.266,000 --> 0:08:41,000
was an American soldier fighting during the First World War in France.

164
0:08:43.363,000 --> 0:08:46,000
How is it possible that you could die from nostalgia

165
0:08:46.956,000 --> 0:08:47,000
less than a hundred years ago?

166
0:08:48.792,000 --> 0:08:51,000
But today, not only does the word mean something different --

167
0:08:51.888,000 --> 0:08:54,000
a sickening for a lost time rather than a lost place --

168
0:08:55.348,000 --> 0:08:58,000
but homesickness itself is seen as less serious,

169
0:08:58.67,000 --> 0:09:,000
sort of downgraded from something you could die from

170
0:09:01.235,000 --> 0:09:04,000
to something you're mainly worried your kid might be suffering from

171
0:09:04.508,000 --> 0:09:05,000
at a sleepover.

172
0:09:05.7,000 --> 0:09:09,000
This change seems to have happened in the early 20th century.

173
0:09:09.842,000 --> 0:09:1,000
But why?

174
0:09:11.085,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Was it the invention of telephones or the expansion of the railways?

175
0:09:15.341,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Was it perhaps the coming of modernity,

176
0:09:18.346,000 --> 0:09:21,000
with its celebration of restlessness and travel and progress

177
0:09:22.099,000 --> 0:09:24,000
that made sickening for the familiar

178
0:09:24.64,000 --> 0:09:25,000
seem rather unambitious?

179
0:09:27.324,000 --> 0:09:32,000
You and I inherit that massive transformation in values,

180
0:09:32.366,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and it's one reason why we might not feel homesickness today

181
0:09:35.647,000 --> 0:09:37,000
as acutely as we used to.

182
0:09:39.139,000 --> 0:09:41,000
It's important to understand

183
0:09:41.219,000 --> 0:09:44,000
that these large historical changes influence our emotions

184
0:09:44.779,000 --> 0:09:47,000
partly because they affect how we feel about how we feel.

185
0:09:48.991,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Today, we celebrate happiness.

186
0:09:51.988,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Happiness is supposed to make us better workers

187
0:09:55.281,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and parents and partners;

188
0:09:57.472,000 --> 0:09:59,000
it's supposed to make us live longer.

189
0:09:59.972,000 --> 0:10:,000
In the 16th century,

190
0:10:01.821,000 --> 0:10:03,000
sadness was thought to do most of those things.

191
0:10:04.693,000 --> 0:10:07,000
It's even possible to read self-help books from that period

192
0:10:08.115,000 --> 0:10:1,000
which try to encourage sadness in readers

193
0:10:10.712,000 --> 0:10:12,000
by giving them lists of reasons to be disappointed.

194
0:10:13.702,000 --> 0:10:14,000
(Laughter)

195
0:10:14.768,000 --> 0:10:18,000
These self-help authors thought you could cultivate sadness as a skill,

196
0:10:19.039,000 --> 0:10:22,000
since being expert in it would make you more resilient

197
0:10:22.221,000 --> 0:10:25,000
when something bad did happen to you, as invariably it would.

198
0:10:26.195,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I think we could learn from this today.

199
0:10:28.655,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Feel sad today, and you might feel impatient, even a little ashamed.

200
0:10:33.85,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Feel sad in the 16th century, and you might feel a little bit smug.

201
0:10:39.391,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Of course, our emotions don't just change across time,

202
0:10:42.686,000 --> 0:10:44,000
they also change from place to place.

203
0:10:45.526,000 --> 0:10:49,000
The Baining people of Papua New Guinea speak of "awumbuk,"

204
0:10:50.129,000 --> 0:10:54,000
a feeling of lethargy that descends when a houseguest finally leaves.

205
0:10:54.331,000 --> 0:10:55,000
(Laughter)

206
0:10:55.442,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Now, you or I might feel relief,

207
0:10:58.055,000 --> 0:11:,000
but in Baining culture,

208
0:11:00.196,000 --> 0:11:03,000
departing guests are thought to shed a sort of heaviness

209
0:11:03.297,000 --> 0:11:04,000
so they can travel more easily,

210
0:11:05.075,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and this heaviness infects the air and causes this awumbuk.

211
0:11:08.227,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And so what they do is leave a bowl of water out overnight

212
0:11:11.072,000 --> 0:11:12,000
to absorb this air,

213
0:11:12.272,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and then very early the next morning, they wake up and have a ceremony

214
0:11:15.672,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and throw the water away.

215
0:11:16.92,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Now, here's a good example

216
0:11:18.207,000 --> 0:11:22,000
of spiritual practices and geographical realities combining

217
0:11:22.268,000 --> 0:11:24,000
to bring a distinct emotion into life

218
0:11:24.746,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and make it disappear again.

219
0:11:27.836,000 --> 0:11:31,000
One of my favorite emotions is a Japanese word, "amae."

220
0:11:33.425,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Amae is a very common word in Japan,

221
0:11:35.781,000 --> 0:11:37,000
but it is actually quite hard to translate.

222
0:11:37.833,000 --> 0:11:39,000
It means something like the pleasure that you get

223
0:11:40.396,000 --> 0:11:43,000
when you're able to temporarily hand over responsibility for your life

224
0:11:44.414,000 --> 0:11:45,000
to someone else.

225
0:11:45.742,000 --> 0:11:46,000
(Laughter)

226
0:11:46.776,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Now, anthropologists suggest

227
0:11:48.467,000 --> 0:11:52,000
that one reason why this word might have been named and celebrated

228
0:11:52.519,000 --> 0:11:53,000
in Japan

229
0:11:53.731,000 --> 0:11:56,000
is because of that country's traditionally collectivist culture,

230
0:11:57.689,000 --> 0:12:,000
whereas the feeling of dependency

231
0:12:00.779,000 --> 0:12:02,000
may be more fraught amongst English speakers,

232
0:12:03.663,000 --> 0:12:07,000
who have learned to value self-sufficiency and individualism.

233
0:12:09.152,000 --> 0:12:11,000
This might be a little simplistic,

234
0:12:11.563,000 --> 0:12:12,000
but it is tantalizing.

235
0:12:13.889,000 --> 0:12:18,000
What might our emotional languages tell us not just about what we feel,

236
0:12:19.287,000 --> 0:12:21,000
but about what we value most?

237
0:12:24.877,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Most people who tell us to pay attention to our well-being

238
0:12:29.005,000 --> 0:12:32,000
talk of the importance of naming our emotions.

239
0:12:32.738,000 --> 0:12:35,000
But these names aren't neutral labels.

240
0:12:35.995,000 --> 0:12:38,000
They are freighted with our culture's values and expectations,

241
0:12:39.244,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and they transmit ideas about who we think we are.

242
0:12:43.65,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Learning new and unusual words for emotions will help attune us

243
0:12:47.746,000 --> 0:12:5,000
to the more finely grained aspects of our inner lives.

244
0:12:51.802,000 --> 0:12:54,000
But more than this, I think these words are worth caring about,

245
0:12:55.532,000 --> 0:12:58,000
because they remind us how powerful the connection is

246
0:12:58.899,000 --> 0:12:59,000
between what we think

247
0:13:00.415,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and how we end up feeling.

248
0:13:03.156,000 --> 0:13:07,000
True emotional intelligence requires that we understand

249
0:13:07.195,000 --> 0:13:11,000
the social, the political, the cultural forces

250
0:13:12.023,000 --> 0:13:15,000
that have shaped what we've come to believe about our emotions

251
0:13:15.58,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and understand how happiness or hatred or love or anger

252
0:13:21.722,000 --> 0:13:23,000
might still be changing now.

253
0:13:24.698,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Because if we want to measure our emotions

254
0:13:27.61,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and teach them in our schools

255
0:13:29.577,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and listen as our politicians tell us how important they are,

256
0:13:33.21,000 --> 0:13:35,000
then it is a good idea that we understand

257
0:13:35.434,000 --> 0:13:36,000
where the assumptions we have about them

258
0:13:37.414,000 --> 0:13:38,000
have come from,

259
0:13:38.618,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and whether they still truly speak to us now.

260
0:13:43.478,000 --> 0:13:45,000
I want to end with an emotion I often feel

261
0:13:45.582,000 --> 0:13:46,000
when I'm working as a historian.

262
0:13:47.59,000 --> 0:13:49,000
It's a French word, "dépaysement."

263
0:13:50.495,000 --> 0:13:54,000
It evokes the giddy disorientation that you feel in an unfamiliar place.

264
0:13:55.328,000 --> 0:13:57,000
One of my favorite parts of being a historian

265
0:13:57.448,000 --> 0:13:59,000
is when something I've completely taken for granted,

266
0:13:59.956,000 --> 0:14:01,000
some very familiar part of my life,

267
0:14:02.551,000 --> 0:14:04,000
is suddenly made strange again.

268
0:14:05.262,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Dépaysement is unsettling,

269
0:14:08.103,000 --> 0:14:09,000
but it's exciting, too.

270
0:14:09.982,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And I hope you might be having just a little glimpse of it right now.

271
0:14:13.54,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Thank you.

272
0:14:14.731,000 --> 0:14:16,000
(Applause)

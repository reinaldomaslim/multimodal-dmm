1
0:00:12.694,000 --> 0:00:16,000
What's the scariest thing you've ever done?

2
0:00:17.547,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Or another way to say it is,

3
0:00:20.597,000 --> 0:00:23,000
what's the most dangerous thing that you've ever done?

4
0:00:24.071,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And why did you do it?

5
0:00:28.254,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I know what the most dangerous thing is

6
0:00:29.872,000 --> 0:00:3,000
that I've ever done

7
0:00:31.065,000 --> 0:00:33,000
because NASA does the math.

8
0:00:33.349,000 --> 0:00:35,000
You look back to the first five shuttle launches,

9
0:00:35.701,000 --> 0:00:37,000
the odds of a catastrophic event

10
0:00:38.289,000 --> 0:00:39,000
during the first five shuttle launches

11
0:00:39.869,000 --> 0:00:41,000
was one in nine.

12
0:00:42.793,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And even when I first flew in the shuttle

13
0:00:44.691,000 --> 0:00:46,000
back in 1995, 74 shuttle flight,

14
0:00:47.379,000 --> 0:00:48,000
the odds were still now that we look back

15
0:00:49.369,000 --> 0:00:54,000
about one in 38 or so -- one in 35, one in 40.

16
0:00:55.037,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Not great odds, so it's a really interesting day

17
0:00:57.604,000 --> 0:00:59,000
when you wake up at the Kennedy Space Center

18
0:00:59.896,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and you're going to go to space that day

19
0:01:02.266,000 --> 0:01:03,000
because you realize by the end of the day

20
0:01:04.001,000 --> 0:01:07,000
you're either going to be floating effortlessly, gloriously in space,

21
0:01:07.631,000 --> 0:01:1,000
or you'll be dead.

22
0:01:10.748,000 --> 0:01:13,000
You go into, at the Kennedy Space Center,

23
0:01:14.108,000 --> 0:01:15,000
the suit-up room,

24
0:01:16.098,000 --> 0:01:2,000
the same room that our childhood heroes

25
0:01:20.353,000 --> 0:01:21,000
got dressed in,

26
0:01:21.611,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin got suited in

27
0:01:24.586,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to go ride the Apollo rocket to the moon.

28
0:01:26.727,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And I got my pressure suit built around me

29
0:01:30.194,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and rode down outside in the van

30
0:01:34.056,000 --> 0:01:35,000
heading out to the launchpad --

31
0:01:35.631,000 --> 0:01:37,000
in the Astro van -- heading out to the launchpad,

32
0:01:38.533,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and as you come around the corner

33
0:01:40.642,000 --> 0:01:42,000
at the Kennedy Space Center,

34
0:01:42.647,000 --> 0:01:45,000
it's normally predawn, and in the distance,

35
0:01:46.032,000 --> 0:01:49,000
lit up by the huge xenon lights,

36
0:01:49.034,000 --> 0:01:52,000
is your spaceship --

37
0:01:52.449,000 --> 0:01:55,000
the vehicle that is going to take you off the planet.

38
0:01:56.289,000 --> 0:01:58,000
The crew is sitting in the Astro van

39
0:01:58.893,000 --> 0:02:,000
sort of hushed, almost holding hands,

40
0:02:01.008,000 --> 0:02:03,000
looking at that as it gets bigger and bigger.

41
0:02:03.557,000 --> 0:02:05,000
We ride the elevator up

42
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and we crawl in, on your hands and knees

43
0:02:08.355,000 --> 0:02:09,000
into the spaceship, one at a time,

44
0:02:10.003,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and you worm your way up

45
0:02:11.65,000 --> 0:02:13,000
into your chair and plunk yourself down

46
0:02:14.217,000 --> 0:02:16,000
on your back.

47
0:02:16.505,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And the hatch is closed,

48
0:02:20.453,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and suddenly,

49
0:02:22.6,000 --> 0:02:26,000
what has been a lifetime of both dreams and denial

50
0:02:27.27,000 --> 0:02:28,000
is becoming real,

51
0:02:28.725,000 --> 0:02:29,000
something that I dreamed about,

52
0:02:29.798,000 --> 0:02:31,000
in fact, that I chose to do when I was nine years old,

53
0:02:32.345,000 --> 0:02:35,000
is now suddenly within not too many minutes

54
0:02:35.719,000 --> 0:02:36,000
of actually happening.

55
0:02:37.577,000 --> 0:02:39,000
In the astronaut business --

56
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
the shuttle is a very complicated vehicle;

57
0:02:42.133,000 --> 0:02:45,000
it's the most complicated flying machine ever built.

58
0:02:45.968,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And in the astronaut business, we have a saying, which is,

59
0:02:49.305,000 --> 0:02:5,000
there is no problem so bad

60
0:02:51.273,000 --> 0:02:53,000
that you can't make it worse.

61
0:02:53.593,000 --> 0:02:54,000
(Laughter)

62
0:02:54.831,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And so you're very conscious in the cockpit;

63
0:02:57.933,000 --> 0:02:58,000
you're thinking about all of the things

64
0:02:59.371,000 --> 0:03:,000
that you might have to do,

65
0:03:00.562,000 --> 0:03:02,000
all the switches and all the wickets you have to go through.

66
0:03:02.873,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And as the time gets closer and closer,

67
0:03:05.066,000 --> 0:03:06,000
this excitement is building.

68
0:03:06.735,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And then about three and a half minutes before launch,

69
0:03:08.895,000 --> 0:03:09,000
the huge nozzles on the back,

70
0:03:10.702,000 --> 0:03:11,000
like the size of big church bells,

71
0:03:12.386,000 --> 0:03:13,000
swing back and forth

72
0:03:13.515,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and the mass of them is such

73
0:03:14.86,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that it sways the whole vehicle,

74
0:03:16.557,000 --> 0:03:18,000
like the vehicle is alive underneath you,

75
0:03:19.441,000 --> 0:03:22,000
like an elephant getting up off its knees or something.

76
0:03:23.095,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And then about 30 seconds before launch,

77
0:03:25.391,000 --> 0:03:26,000
the vehicle is completely alive --

78
0:03:27.223,000 --> 0:03:28,000
it is ready to go --

79
0:03:28.43,000 --> 0:03:29,000
the APUs are running,

80
0:03:29.591,000 --> 0:03:3,000
the computers are all self-contained,

81
0:03:31.46,000 --> 0:03:32,000
it's ready to leave the planet.

82
0:03:32.949,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And 15 seconds before launch, this happens:

83
0:03:36.237,000 --> 0:03:4,000
(Video) Voice: 12, 11, 10,

84
0:03:40.675,000 --> 0:03:44,000
nine, eight, seven, six --

85
0:03:44.703,000 --> 0:03:46,000
(Space shuttle preparing for takeoff)

86
0:03:47.251,000 --> 0:03:49,000
-- start, two, one,

87
0:03:50.143,000 --> 0:03:54,000
booster ignition, and liftoff of the space shuttle Discovery,

88
0:03:54.286,000 --> 0:03:58,000
returning to the space station, paving the way ...

89
0:03:58.317,000 --> 0:04:09,000
(Space shuttle taking off)

90
0:04:10.901,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Chris Hadfield: It is incredibly powerful

91
0:04:13.161,000 --> 0:04:14,000
to be on board one of these things.

92
0:04:14.964,000 --> 0:04:16,000
You are in the grip of something

93
0:04:16.995,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that is vastly more powerful than yourself.

94
0:04:19.192,000 --> 0:04:21,000
It's shaking you so hard you can't focus

95
0:04:21.815,000 --> 0:04:22,000
on the instruments in front of you.

96
0:04:23.262,000 --> 0:04:25,000
It's like you're in the jaws of some enormous dog

97
0:04:26.178,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and there's a foot in the small of your back

98
0:04:28.924,000 --> 0:04:29,000
pushing you into space,

99
0:04:30.451,000 --> 0:04:32,000
accelerating wildly straight up,

100
0:04:32.5,000 --> 0:04:33,000
shouldering your way through the air,

101
0:04:34.202,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and you're in a very complex place --

102
0:04:36.733,000 --> 0:04:37,000
paying attention, watching the vehicle

103
0:04:38.538,000 --> 0:04:39,000
go through each one of its wickets

104
0:04:40.189,000 --> 0:04:42,000
with a steadily increasing smile on your face.

105
0:04:42.61,000 --> 0:04:45,000
After two minutes, those solid rockets explode off

106
0:04:45.807,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and then you just have the liquid engines,

107
0:04:48.221,000 --> 0:04:49,000
the hydrogen and oxygen,

108
0:04:49.674,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and it's as if you're in a dragster

109
0:04:51.141,000 --> 0:04:52,000
with your foot to the floor

110
0:04:52.916,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and accelerating like you've never accelerated.

111
0:04:55.335,000 --> 0:04:56,000
You get lighter and lighter,

112
0:04:56.65,000 --> 0:04:58,000
the force gets on us heavier and heavier.

113
0:04:59.076,000 --> 0:05:,000
It feels like

114
0:05:00.452,000 --> 0:05:02,000
someone's pouring cement on you or something.

115
0:05:02.536,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Until finally,

116
0:05:03.82,000 --> 0:05:05,000
after about eight minutes and 40 seconds or so,

117
0:05:06.488,000 --> 0:05:08,000
we are finally at exactly the right altitude,

118
0:05:08.683,000 --> 0:05:1,000
exactly the right speed,

119
0:05:10.765,000 --> 0:05:13,000
the right direction, the engine shut off,

120
0:05:13.845,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and we're weightless.

121
0:05:16.067,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And we're alive.

122
0:05:18.969,000 --> 0:05:19,000
It's an amazing experience.

123
0:05:20.425,000 --> 0:05:23,000
But why would we take that risk?

124
0:05:23.733,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Why would you do something that dangerous?

125
0:05:27.453,000 --> 0:05:29,000
In my case the answer is fairly straightforward.

126
0:05:29.522,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I was inspired as a youngster

127
0:05:32.576,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that this was what I wanted to do.

128
0:05:34.167,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I watched the first people walk on the moon

129
0:05:36.36,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and to me, it was just an obvious thing --

130
0:05:38.591,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I want to somehow turn myself into that.

131
0:05:41.593,000 --> 0:05:42,000
But the real question is,

132
0:05:42.775,000 --> 0:05:44,000
how do you deal with the danger of it

133
0:05:45.39,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and the fear that comes from it?

134
0:05:47.546,000 --> 0:05:5,000
How do you deal with fear versus danger?

135
0:05:51.244,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And having the goal in mind, thinking about where it might lead,

136
0:05:54.311,000 --> 0:05:55,000
directed me to a life of

137
0:05:56.12,000 --> 0:05:59,000
looking at all of the small details to allow

138
0:05:59.465,000 --> 0:06:,000
this to become possible,

139
0:06:01.166,000 --> 0:06:03,000
to be able to launch and go help build a space station

140
0:06:04.075,000 --> 0:06:06,000
where you are on board a million-pound creation

141
0:06:06.535,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that's going around the world at five miles a second,

142
0:06:09.371,000 --> 0:06:1,000
eight kilometers a second,

143
0:06:10.746,000 --> 0:06:12,000
around the world 16 times a day,

144
0:06:13.255,000 --> 0:06:16,000
with experiments on board that are teaching us

145
0:06:17.24,000 --> 0:06:18,000
what the substance of the universe is made of

146
0:06:19.232,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and running 200 experiments inside.

147
0:06:21.818,000 --> 0:06:22,000
But maybe even more importantly,

148
0:06:23.666,000 --> 0:06:26,000
allowing us to see the world in a way

149
0:06:27.483,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that is impossible through any other means,

150
0:06:30.105,000 --> 0:06:31,000
to be able to look down

151
0:06:31.644,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and have -- if your jaw could drop, it would --

152
0:06:34.947,000 --> 0:06:37,000
the jaw-dropping gorgeousness of the turning orb

153
0:06:38.937,000 --> 0:06:42,000
like a self-propelled art gallery of fantastic,

154
0:06:43.7,000 --> 0:06:46,000
constantly changing beauty that is the world itself.

155
0:06:47.411,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And you see, because of the speed,

156
0:06:48.946,000 --> 0:06:51,000
a sunrise or a sunset every 45 minutes

157
0:06:52.772,000 --> 0:06:55,000
for half a year.

158
0:06:55.941,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And the most magnificent part of all that

159
0:06:58.392,000 --> 0:07:,000
is to go outside on a spacewalk.

160
0:07:01.191,000 --> 0:07:06,000
You are in a one-person spaceship

161
0:07:06.599,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that is your spacesuit,

162
0:07:08.067,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and you're going through space with the world.

163
0:07:11.831,000 --> 0:07:12,000
It's an entirely different perspective,

164
0:07:13.584,000 --> 0:07:14,000
you're not looking up at the universe,

165
0:07:14.999,000 --> 0:07:17,000
you and the Earth are going through the universe together.

166
0:07:18.481,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And you're holding on with one hand,

167
0:07:20.28,000 --> 0:07:22,000
looking at the world turn beside you.

168
0:07:22.404,000 --> 0:07:25,000
It's roaring silently

169
0:07:26.196,000 --> 0:07:28,000
with color and texture as it pours by

170
0:07:28.965,000 --> 0:07:29,000
mesmerizingly next to you.

171
0:07:30.941,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And if you can tear your eyes away from that

172
0:07:33.627,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and you look under your arm

173
0:07:35.089,000 --> 0:07:37,000
down at the rest of everything,

174
0:07:37.327,000 --> 0:07:42,000
it's unfathomable blackness,

175
0:07:42.724,000 --> 0:07:45,000
with a texture you feel like you could stick your hand into.

176
0:07:45.792,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and you are holding on with one hand,

177
0:07:48.207,000 --> 0:07:5,000
one link to the other seven billion people.

178
0:07:50.632,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And I was outside on my first spacewalk

179
0:07:52.77,000 --> 0:07:55,000
when my left eye went blind,

180
0:07:56.546,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and I didn't know why.

181
0:07:58.216,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Suddenly my left eye slammed shut

182
0:07:59.826,000 --> 0:08:,000
in great pain

183
0:08:00.95,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and I couldn't figure out why my eye wasn't working.

184
0:08:05.009,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I was thinking, what do I do next?

185
0:08:06.365,000 --> 0:08:08,000
I thought, well maybe that's why we have two eyes,

186
0:08:08.62,000 --> 0:08:09,000
so I kept working.

187
0:08:09.873,000 --> 0:08:12,000
But unfortunately, without gravity,

188
0:08:13.212,000 --> 0:08:14,000
tears don't fall.

189
0:08:15.142,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So you just get a bigger and bigger ball of whatever that is

190
0:08:18.166,000 --> 0:08:2,000
mixed with your tears on your eye

191
0:08:20.174,000 --> 0:08:22,000
until eventually, the ball becomes so big

192
0:08:22.652,000 --> 0:08:24,000
that the surface tension takes it across the bridge of your nose

193
0:08:25.213,000 --> 0:08:26,000
like a tiny little waterfall

194
0:08:26.947,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and goes "goosh" into your other eye,

195
0:08:29.023,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and now I was completely blind

196
0:08:32.49,000 --> 0:08:35,000
outside the spaceship.

197
0:08:35.588,000 --> 0:08:37,000
So what's the scariest thing you've ever done?

198
0:08:38.167,000 --> 0:08:41,000
(Laughter)

199
0:08:41.869,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Maybe it's spiders.

200
0:08:43.349,000 --> 0:08:44,000
A lot of people are afraid of spiders.

201
0:08:44.878,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I think you should be afraid of spiders --

202
0:08:46.607,000 --> 0:08:48,000
spiders are creepy and they've got long, hairy legs,

203
0:08:49.29,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and spiders like this one, the brown recluse --

204
0:08:52.717,000 --> 0:08:54,000
it's horrible. If a brown recluse bites you,

205
0:08:54.859,000 --> 0:08:55,000
you end with one of these horrible, big necrotic things

206
0:08:56.593,000 --> 0:08:57,000
on your leg

207
0:08:57.696,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and there might be one right now

208
0:08:58.949,000 --> 0:09:01,000
sitting on the chair behind you, in fact.

209
0:09:02.027,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And how do you know?

210
0:09:03.112,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And so a spider lands on you,

211
0:09:04.486,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and you go through this great, spasmy attack

212
0:09:06.527,000 --> 0:09:07,000
because spiders are scary.

213
0:09:08.255,000 --> 0:09:1,000
But then you could say, well is there a brown recluse

214
0:09:10.759,000 --> 0:09:11,000
sitting on the chair beside me or not?

215
0:09:12.134,000 --> 0:09:14,000
I don't know. Are there brown recluses here?

216
0:09:14.148,000 --> 0:09:16,000
So if you actually do the research, you find out that

217
0:09:16.831,000 --> 0:09:19,000
in the world there are about 50,000 different types of spiders,

218
0:09:19.876,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and there are about two dozen that are venomous

219
0:09:22.551,000 --> 0:09:23,000
out of 50,000.

220
0:09:23.902,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And if you're in Canada, because of the cold winters

221
0:09:26.27,000 --> 0:09:3,000
here in B.C., there's about 720, 730 different types of spiders

222
0:09:30.75,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and there's one -- one --

223
0:09:32.652,000 --> 0:09:32,000
that is venomous,

224
0:09:33.511,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and its venom isn't even fatal,

225
0:09:35.217,000 --> 0:09:36,000
it's just kind of like a nasty sting.

226
0:09:37.118,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And that spider -- not only that,

227
0:09:39.043,000 --> 0:09:42,000
but that spider has beautiful markings on it,

228
0:09:42.256,000 --> 0:09:46,000
it's like "I'm dangerous. I got a big radiation symbol on my back, it's the black widow."

229
0:09:46.404,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So, if you're even slightly careful

230
0:09:48.662,000 --> 0:09:5,000
you can avoid running into the one spider --

231
0:09:51.104,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and it lives close the ground,

232
0:09:53.25,000 --> 0:09:55,000
you're walking along, you are never going to go through

233
0:09:55.702,000 --> 0:09:56,000
a spider web where a black widow bites you.

234
0:09:57.552,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Spider webs like this, it doesn't build those,

235
0:09:59.525,000 --> 0:10:,000
it builds them down in the corners.

236
0:10:01.155,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And its a black widow because

237
0:10:02.747,000 --> 0:10:03,000
the female spider eats the male;

238
0:10:04.086,000 --> 0:10:05,000
it doesn't care about you.

239
0:10:05.877,000 --> 0:10:06,000
So in fact,

240
0:10:07.342,000 --> 0:10:09,000
the next time you walk into a spiderweb,

241
0:10:09.641,000 --> 0:10:12,000
you don't need to panic and go with your caveman reaction.

242
0:10:13.516,000 --> 0:10:17,000
The danger is entirely different than the fear.

243
0:10:18.105,000 --> 0:10:2,000
How do you get around it, though?

244
0:10:20.438,000 --> 0:10:21,000
How do you change your behavior?

245
0:10:21.692,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Well, next time you see a spiderweb,

246
0:10:23.176,000 --> 0:10:25,000
have a good look, make sure it's not a black widow spider,

247
0:10:25.39,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and then walk into it.

248
0:10:27.182,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And then you see another spiderweb

249
0:10:28.82,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and walk into that one.

250
0:10:30.042,000 --> 0:10:32,000
It's just a little bit of fluffy stuff. It's not a big deal.

251
0:10:32.288,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And the spider that may come out is no more threat to you than a lady bug

252
0:10:35.804,000 --> 0:10:37,000
or a butterfly.

253
0:10:38.672,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And then I guarantee you if you walk through 100 spiderwebs

254
0:10:41.6,000 --> 0:10:42,000
you will have changed

255
0:10:43.188,000 --> 0:10:45,000
your fundamental human behavior,

256
0:10:45.743,000 --> 0:10:46,000
your caveman reaction,

257
0:10:47.248,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and you will now be able to walk in the park in the morning

258
0:10:50.075,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and not worry about that spiderweb --

259
0:10:51.864,000 --> 0:10:53,000
or into your grandma's attic or whatever,

260
0:10:54.324,000 --> 0:10:59,000
into your own basement.

261
0:10:59.409,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And you can apply this to anything.

262
0:11:02.92,000 --> 0:11:04,000
If you're outside on a spacewalk and you're blinded,

263
0:11:05.735,000 --> 0:11:07,000
your natural reaction would be to panic, I think.

264
0:11:08.359,000 --> 0:11:1,000
It would make you nervous and worried.

265
0:11:10.419,000 --> 0:11:12,000
But we had considered all the venom,

266
0:11:12.907,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and we had practiced with a whole variety of different spiderwebs.

267
0:11:15.788,000 --> 0:11:16,000
We knew everything there is to know

268
0:11:17.522,000 --> 0:11:18,000
about the spacesuit

269
0:11:18.98,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and we trained underwater thousands of times.

270
0:11:21.493,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And we don't just practice things going right,

271
0:11:23.224,000 --> 0:11:25,000
we practice things going wrong all the time,

272
0:11:26.048,000 --> 0:11:29,000
so that you are constantly walking through those spiderwebs.

273
0:11:29.312,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And not just underwater, but also in virtual reality labs

274
0:11:32.389,000 --> 0:11:33,000
with the helmet and the gloves

275
0:11:33.78,000 --> 0:11:34,000
so you feel like it's realistic.

276
0:11:35.187,000 --> 0:11:38,000
So when you finally actually get outside on a spacewalk,

277
0:11:38.515,000 --> 0:11:39,000
it feels much different than it would

278
0:11:40.477,000 --> 0:11:41,000
if you just went out first time.

279
0:11:42.315,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And even if you're blinded,

280
0:11:44.076,000 --> 0:11:47,000
your natural, panicky reaction doesn't happen.

281
0:11:47.722,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Instead you kind of look around and go,

282
0:11:49.081,000 --> 0:11:5,000
"Okay, I can't see,

283
0:11:50.733,000 --> 0:11:52,000
but I can hear, I can talk,

284
0:11:53.155,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Scott Parazynski is out here with me.

285
0:11:54.884,000 --> 0:11:55,000
He could come over and help me."

286
0:11:56.315,000 --> 0:11:59,000
We actually practiced incapacitated crew rescue,

287
0:12:00.229,000 --> 0:12:01,000
so he could float me like a blimp

288
0:12:02.02,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and stuff me into the airlock if he had to.

289
0:12:04.195,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I could find my own way back.

290
0:12:06.395,000 --> 0:12:07,000
It's not nearly as big a deal.

291
0:12:07.765,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And actually, if you keep on crying for a while,

292
0:12:09.787,000 --> 0:12:11,000
whatever that gunk was that's in your eye starts to dilute

293
0:12:12.182,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and you can start to see again,

294
0:12:13.702,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and Houston, if you negotiate with them,

295
0:12:15.769,000 --> 0:12:17,000
they will let you then keep working.

296
0:12:18.766,000 --> 0:12:2,000
We finished everything on the spacewalk

297
0:12:20.825,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and when we came back inside,

298
0:12:22.422,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Jeff got some cotton batting and took the crusty stuff around my eyes,

299
0:12:26.145,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and it turned out it was just the anti-fog,

300
0:12:28.597,000 --> 0:12:31,000
sort of a mixture of oil and soap, that got in my eye.

301
0:12:32.044,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And now we use Johnson's No More Tears,

302
0:12:35.592,000 --> 0:12:36,000
which we probably should've been using

303
0:12:36.907,000 --> 0:12:39,000
right from the very beginning. (Laughter)

304
0:12:40.543,000 --> 0:12:44,000
But the key to that is

305
0:12:45.489,000 --> 0:12:46,000
by looking at the difference

306
0:12:47.044,000 --> 0:12:48,000
between perceived danger and actual danger,

307
0:12:49.039,000 --> 0:12:5,000
where is the real risk?

308
0:12:50.406,000 --> 0:12:52,000
What is the real thing that you should be afraid of?

309
0:12:52.46,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Not just a generic fear of bad things happening.

310
0:12:55.228,000 --> 0:12:57,000
You can fundamentally change your reaction to things

311
0:12:57.595,000 --> 0:12:59,000
so that it allows you to go places

312
0:13:00.532,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and see things and do things

313
0:13:02.169,000 --> 0:13:04,000
that otherwise would be completely denied to you ...

314
0:13:04.665,000 --> 0:13:07,000
where you could see the hardpan south of the Sahara,

315
0:13:08.012,000 --> 0:13:09,000
or you can see New York City

316
0:13:09.964,000 --> 0:13:11,000
in a way that is almost dreamlike,

317
0:13:12.063,000 --> 0:13:16,000
or the unconscious gingham of Eastern Europe fields

318
0:13:16.586,000 --> 0:13:18,000
or the Great Lakes

319
0:13:18.717,000 --> 0:13:2,000
as a collection of small puddles.

320
0:13:21.473,000 --> 0:13:24,000
You can see the fault lines of San Francisco

321
0:13:24.703,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and the way the water pours out under the bridge,

322
0:13:26.601,000 --> 0:13:27,000
just entirely different

323
0:13:28.333,000 --> 0:13:29,000
than any other way that you could have

324
0:13:30.002,000 --> 0:13:33,000
if you had not found a way to conquer your fear.

325
0:13:33.285,000 --> 0:13:35,000
You see a beauty that otherwise

326
0:13:35.724,000 --> 0:13:37,000
never would have happened.

327
0:13:39.694,000 --> 0:13:4,000
It's time to come home at the end.

328
0:13:41.448,000 --> 0:13:42,000
This is our spaceship,

329
0:13:42.767,000 --> 0:13:43,000
the Soyuz, that little one.

330
0:13:43.874,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Three of us climb in,

331
0:13:45.339,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and then this spaceship detaches from the station

332
0:13:47.791,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and falls into the atmosphere.

333
0:13:49.461,000 --> 0:13:5,000
These two parts here

334
0:13:51.083,000 --> 0:13:53,000
actually melt, we jettison them and they burn up

335
0:13:53.247,000 --> 0:13:54,000
in the atmosphere.

336
0:13:54.329,000 --> 0:13:56,000
The only part that survives is the little bullet

337
0:13:56.582,000 --> 0:13:57,000
that we're riding in,

338
0:13:57.758,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and it falls into the atmosphere,

339
0:13:59.796,000 --> 0:14:,000
and in essence

340
0:14:01.372,000 --> 0:14:04,000
you are riding a meteorite home,

341
0:14:04.933,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and riding meteorites is scary,

342
0:14:07.866,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and it ought to be.

343
0:14:09.379,000 --> 0:14:11,000
But instead of riding into the atmosphere

344
0:14:11.618,000 --> 0:14:12,000
just screaming, like you would

345
0:14:12.856,000 --> 0:14:14,000
if suddenly you found yourself riding a meteorite

346
0:14:15.201,000 --> 0:14:17,000
back to Earth -- (Laughter) --

347
0:14:18.131,000 --> 0:14:2,000
instead, 20 years previously

348
0:14:20.555,000 --> 0:14:22,000
we had started studying Russian,

349
0:14:23.171,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and then once you learn Russian, then we

350
0:14:25.751,000 --> 0:14:27,000
learned orbital mechanics in Russian,

351
0:14:28.265,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and then we learned vehicle control theory,

352
0:14:31.235,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and then we got into the simulator

353
0:14:32.704,000 --> 0:14:34,000
and practiced over and over and over again.

354
0:14:35.276,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And in fact, you can fly this meteorite

355
0:14:37.286,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and steer it and land in about a 15-kilometer circle

356
0:14:39.495,000 --> 0:14:4,000
anywhere on the Earth.

357
0:14:40.919,000 --> 0:14:42,000
So in fact, when our crew was coming back

358
0:14:43.844,000 --> 0:14:45,000
into the atmosphere inside the Soyuz,

359
0:14:46.404,000 --> 0:14:48,000
we weren't screaming, we were laughing;

360
0:14:48.78,000 --> 0:14:49,000
it was fun.

361
0:14:49.848,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And when the great big parachute opened,

362
0:14:51.776,000 --> 0:14:52,000
we knew that if it didn't open

363
0:14:52.995,000 --> 0:14:53,000
there's a second parachute,

364
0:14:54.21,000 --> 0:14:56,000
and it runs on a nice little clockwork mechanism.

365
0:14:56.391,000 --> 0:14:58,000
So we came back, we came thundering back

366
0:14:58.773,000 --> 0:14:59,000
to Earth and this is what it looked like

367
0:15:00.659,000 --> 0:15:02,000
to land in a Soyuz, in Kazakhstan.

368
0:15:03.259,000 --> 0:15:05,000
(Video) Reporter: And you can see one of those

369
0:15:05.282,000 --> 0:15:07,000
search and recovery helicopters, once again

370
0:15:07.998,000 --> 0:15:1,000
that helicopter part of dozen such Russian

371
0:15:11.009,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Mi-8 helicopters.

372
0:15:15.637,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Touchdown -- 3:14 and 48 seconds,

373
0:15:19.546,000 --> 0:15:2,000
a.m. Central Time.

374
0:15:21.021,000 --> 0:15:22,000
CH: And you roll to a stop

375
0:15:22.192,000 --> 0:15:23,000
as if someone threw your spaceship at the ground

376
0:15:23.861,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and it tumbles end over end,

377
0:15:25.243,000 --> 0:15:26,000
but you're ready for it

378
0:15:26.249,000 --> 0:15:27,000
you're in a custom-built seat,

379
0:15:27.625,000 --> 0:15:28,000
you know how the shock absorber works.

380
0:15:29.062,000 --> 0:15:3,000
And then eventually the Russians reach in,

381
0:15:31.053,000 --> 0:15:32,000
drag you out,

382
0:15:32.211,000 --> 0:15:33,000
plunk you into a chair,

383
0:15:33.911,000 --> 0:15:36,000
and you can now look back at

384
0:15:37.354,000 --> 0:15:4,000
what was an incredible experience.

385
0:15:40.536,000 --> 0:15:41,000
You have taken the dreams of that

386
0:15:42.503,000 --> 0:15:43,000
nine-year-old boy,

387
0:15:44.115,000 --> 0:15:45,000
which were impossible

388
0:15:45.754,000 --> 0:15:47,000
and dauntingly scary,

389
0:15:48.644,000 --> 0:15:49,000
dauntingly terrifying,

390
0:15:50.344,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and put them into practice,

391
0:15:53.068,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and figured out a way to reprogram yourself,

392
0:15:56.301,000 --> 0:15:58,000
to change your primal fear

393
0:15:58.429,000 --> 0:16:,000
so that it allowed you to come back

394
0:16:01.328,000 --> 0:16:04,000
with a set of experiences and a level of inspiration

395
0:16:05.268,000 --> 0:16:06,000
for other people

396
0:16:06.611,000 --> 0:16:09,000
that never could have been possible otherwise.

397
0:16:11.12,000 --> 0:16:17,000
Just to finish, they asked me to play that guitar.

398
0:16:17.347,000 --> 0:16:19,000
I know this song,

399
0:16:19.607,000 --> 0:16:24,000
and it's really a tribute to the genius

400
0:16:24.827,000 --> 0:16:26,000
of David Bowie himself,

401
0:16:26.86,000 --> 0:16:27,000
but it's also, I think,

402
0:16:28.773,000 --> 0:16:3,000
a reflection of the fact that we are not machines

403
0:16:31.211,000 --> 0:16:32,000
exploring the universe,

404
0:16:32.544,000 --> 0:16:33,000
we are people,

405
0:16:33.657,000 --> 0:16:35,000
and we're taking

406
0:16:35.821,000 --> 0:16:37,000
that ability to adapt

407
0:16:37.997,000 --> 0:16:38,000
and that ability to understand

408
0:16:39.527,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and the ability to take

409
0:16:41.503,000 --> 0:16:45,000
our own self-perception into a new place.

410
0:16:46.369,000 --> 0:16:51,000
(Music)

411
0:16:52.099,000 --> 0:16:56,000

1
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
There's an ancient and universal concept that words have power,

2
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that spells exist,

3
0:00:31.358,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and that if we could only pronounce the right words,

4
0:00:34.079,000 --> 0:00:36,000
then -- whoosh! -- you know, an avalanche would come

5
0:00:36.932,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and wipe out the hobbits, right?

6
0:00:38.961,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So this is a very attractive idea,

7
0:00:40.972,000 --> 0:00:42,000
because we're very lazy, like the Sorcerer's Apprentice,

8
0:00:43.623,000 --> 0:00:45,000
or the world's greatest computer programmer.

9
0:00:45.718,000 --> 0:00:46,000
This idea has a lot of traction with us.

10
0:00:47.652,000 --> 0:00:49,000
We love the idea that words, when pronounced,

11
0:00:49.814,000 --> 0:00:5,000
are little more than pure information,

12
0:00:51.656,000 --> 0:00:53,000
but they evoke physical action in the real world

13
0:00:53.939,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that helps us do work.

14
0:00:55.122,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So, of course, with lots of programmable computers

15
0:00:57.554,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and robots around,

16
0:00:58.729,000 --> 0:00:59,000
this is an easy thing to picture.

17
0:01:00.585,000 --> 0:01:02,000
How many of you know what I'm talking about?

18
0:01:02.674,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Raise your right hand.

19
0:01:03.849,000 --> 0:01:05,000
How many don't know what I'm talking about?

20
0:01:05.876,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Raise your left hand.

21
0:01:07.051,000 --> 0:01:09,000
So that's great. So that was too easy.

22
0:01:09.954,000 --> 0:01:12,000
You guys have very insecure computers, OK?

23
0:01:13.097,000 --> 0:01:16,000
So now the thing is, this is a different kind of spell.

24
0:01:16.749,000 --> 0:01:18,000
This is a computer program made of zeros and ones.

25
0:01:19.13,000 --> 0:01:21,000
It can be pronounced on a computer, does something like this.

26
0:01:22.012,000 --> 0:01:25,000
The important thing is we can write it in a high-level language.

27
0:01:25.046,000 --> 0:01:26,000
A computer magician can write this thing.

28
0:01:27.032,000 --> 0:01:3,000
It can be compiled into zeros and ones and pronounced by a computer.

29
0:01:30.27,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And that's what makes computers powerful,

30
0:01:32.293,000 --> 0:01:34,000
these high-level languages that can be compiled.

31
0:01:34.577,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And so, I'm here to tell you, you don't need a computer

32
0:01:37.457,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to actually have a spell.

33
0:01:39.375,000 --> 0:01:41,000
In fact, what you can do at the molecular level

34
0:01:41.684,000 --> 0:01:42,000
is that if you encode information --

35
0:01:43.682,000 --> 0:01:45,000
you encode a spell or program as molecules --

36
0:01:45.896,000 --> 0:01:48,000
then physics can actually directly interpret that information

37
0:01:49.539,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and run a program.

38
0:01:50.714,000 --> 0:01:51,000
It's what happens in proteins.

39
0:01:52.17,000 --> 0:01:54,000
When this amino-acid sequence gets pronounced as atoms,

40
0:01:54.815,000 --> 0:01:56,000
these little letters are sticky for each other.

41
0:01:57.059,000 --> 0:02:,000
It collapses into a three-dimensional shape that turns it into a nanomachine

42
0:02:00.967,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that actually cuts DNA.

43
0:02:02.561,000 --> 0:02:04,000
The interesting thing is that if you change the sequence,

44
0:02:05.338,000 --> 0:02:07,000
you change the three-dimensional folding.

45
0:02:07.37,000 --> 0:02:08,000
You get, now, a DNA stapler, instead.

46
0:02:09.354,000 --> 0:02:12,000
These are the kind of molecular programs we want to be able to write.

47
0:02:12.64,000 --> 0:02:13,000
The problem is, we don't know

48
0:02:14.05,000 --> 0:02:17,000
the machine language of proteins or have a compiler for proteins.

49
0:02:17.203,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So I've joined a growing band of people

50
0:02:19.093,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that try to make molecular spells using DNA.

51
0:02:21.331,000 --> 0:02:23,000
We use DNA because it's cheaper, it's easier to handle,

52
0:02:23.959,000 --> 0:02:25,000
it's something we understand really well --

53
0:02:26.054,000 --> 0:02:29,000
so well, in fact, that we think we can actually write

54
0:02:29.161,000 --> 0:02:32,000
programming languages for DNA and have molecular compilers.

55
0:02:32.598,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So then, we think we can do that.

56
0:02:34.203,000 --> 0:02:37,000
One of my first questions doing this was:

57
0:02:37.712,000 --> 0:02:39,000
How can you make an arbitrary shape or pattern out of DNA?

58
0:02:40.507,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I decided to use a type of DNA origami,

59
0:02:42.742,000 --> 0:02:43,000
where you take a long strand of DNA

60
0:02:44.471,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and fold it into whatever shape or pattern you might want.

61
0:02:47.304,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So here's a shape.

62
0:02:48.491,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I actually spent about a year in my home in my underwear, coding,

63
0:02:51.875,000 --> 0:02:53,000
like Linus [Torvalds], in that picture before.

64
0:02:54.051,000 --> 0:02:57,000
This program takes a shape and spits out 250 DNA sequences.

65
0:02:57.62,000 --> 0:03:,000
These short DNA sequences are what are going to fold the long strand

66
0:03:00.841,000 --> 0:03:01,000
into this shape that we want to make.

67
0:03:02.634,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So you send an e-mail with these sequences in it

68
0:03:04.905,000 --> 0:03:05,000
to a company,

69
0:03:06.081,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and the company pronounces them on a DNA synthesizer,

70
0:03:08.784,000 --> 0:03:1,000
a machine about the size of a photocopier.

71
0:03:11.298,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And they take your e-mail,

72
0:03:13.298,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and every letter in your e-mail, they replace with a 30-atom cluster --

73
0:03:16.683,000 --> 0:03:18,000
one for each letter, A, T, C and G in DNA.

74
0:03:19.113,000 --> 0:03:21,000
They string them up in the right sequence,

75
0:03:21.148,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and then they send them back to you via FedEx.

76
0:03:23.333,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So you get 250 of these in the mail in little tubes.

77
0:03:25.798,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I mix them together, add a little bit of salt water,

78
0:03:28.265,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and then add this long strand I was telling you about,

79
0:03:30.825,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that I've stolen from a virus.

80
0:03:32.309,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And then what happens is,

81
0:03:33.556,000 --> 0:03:35,000
you heat this whole thing up to about boiling.

82
0:03:35.734,000 --> 0:03:37,000
You cool it down to room temperature,

83
0:03:37.82,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and as you do, those short strands do the following thing:

84
0:03:41.006,000 --> 0:03:44,000
each one of them binds that long strand in one place,

85
0:03:44.426,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and then has a second half that binds that long strand in a distant place,

86
0:03:47.998,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and brings those two parts of the long strand

87
0:03:50.291,000 --> 0:03:52,000
close together so they stick together.

88
0:03:52.36,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So the net effect of all 250 of these strands

89
0:03:55.071,000 --> 0:03:59,000
is to fold the long strand into the shape you're looking for.

90
0:03:59.422,000 --> 0:04:,000
It'll approximate that shape.

91
0:04:00.838,000 --> 0:04:01,000
We do this for real, in the test tube.

92
0:04:02.691,000 --> 0:04:04,000
In each little drop of water, you get 50 billion of these guys.

93
0:04:05.683,000 --> 0:04:07,000
With a microscope, you can see them on a surface.

94
0:04:08.022,000 --> 0:04:11,000
The neat thing is if you change the sequence and change the spell,

95
0:04:11.161,000 --> 0:04:12,000
just change the sequence of the staples,

96
0:04:13.116,000 --> 0:04:15,000
you can make a molecule that looks like this.

97
0:04:15.942,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And, you know, he likes to hang out with his buddies.

98
0:04:18.976,000 --> 0:04:19,000
A lot of them are actually pretty good.

99
0:04:20.886,000 --> 0:04:22,000
If you change the spell again, you change the sequence again,

100
0:04:23.792,000 --> 0:04:25,000
you get really nice, 130-nanometer triangles.

101
0:04:26.122,000 --> 0:04:27,000
If you do it again,

102
0:04:27.509,000 --> 0:04:29,000
you can get arbitrary patterns.

103
0:04:29.744,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So on a rectangle, you can paint patterns of North and South America,

104
0:04:34.165,000 --> 0:04:35,000
or the words, "DNA."

105
0:04:35.37,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So that's DNA origami. That's one way.

106
0:04:38.407,000 --> 0:04:41,000
There are many ways of casting molecular spells using DNA.

107
0:04:42.374,000 --> 0:04:43,000
What we really want to do in the end

108
0:04:44.14,000 --> 0:04:47,000
is learn how to program self-assembly so we can build anything, right?

109
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:5,000
We want to be able to build technological artifacts

110
0:04:50.414,000 --> 0:04:51,000
that are maybe good for the world.

111
0:04:52.099,000 --> 0:04:54,000
We want to learn how to build biological artifacts,

112
0:04:55.054,000 --> 0:04:56,000
like people and whales and trees.

113
0:04:56.799,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And if it's the case that we can reach that level of complexity,

114
0:04:59.845,000 --> 0:05:02,000
if our ability to program molecules gets to be that good,

115
0:05:03.129,000 --> 0:05:04,000
then that will truly be magic.

116
0:05:05.889,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Thank you very much.

117
0:05:07.064,000 --> 0:05:08,000
(Applause)

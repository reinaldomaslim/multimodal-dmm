2
0:00:16.21,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Now, extinction is a different kind of death.

3
0:00:21.272,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It's bigger.

4
0:00:23.895,000 --> 0:00:26,000
We didn't really realize that until 1914,

5
0:00:26.975,000 --> 0:00:29,000
when the last passenger pigeon, a female named Martha,

6
0:00:30.19,000 --> 0:00:33,000
died at the Cincinnati zoo.

7
0:00:33.208,000 --> 0:00:36,000
This had been the most abundant bird in the world

8
0:00:36.749,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that'd been in North America for six million years.

9
0:00:40.356,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Suddenly it wasn't here at all.

10
0:00:43.661,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Flocks that were a mile wide and 400 miles long

11
0:00:47.738,000 --> 0:00:49,000
used to darken the sun.

12
0:00:50.385,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Aldo Leopold said this was a biological storm,

13
0:00:53.455,000 --> 0:00:55,000
a feathered tempest.

14
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And indeed it was a keystone species

15
0:00:58.704,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that enriched the entire eastern deciduous forest,

16
0:01:02.72,000 --> 0:01:04,000
from the Mississippi to the Atlantic,

17
0:01:05.004,000 --> 0:01:08,000
from Canada down to the Gulf.

18
0:01:08.319,000 --> 0:01:11,000
But it went from five billion birds to zero in just a couple decades.

19
0:01:11.632,000 --> 0:01:12,000
What happened?

20
0:01:12.832,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Well, commercial hunting happened.

21
0:01:14.985,000 --> 0:01:17,000
These birds were hunted for meat that was sold by the ton,

22
0:01:18.944,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and it was easy to do because when those big flocks

23
0:01:21.264,000 --> 0:01:23,000
came down to the ground, they were so dense

24
0:01:23.536,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that hundreds of hunters and netters could show up

25
0:01:25.904,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and slaughter them by the tens of thousands.

26
0:01:28.91,000 --> 0:01:31,000
It was the cheapest source of protein in America.

27
0:01:31.928,000 --> 0:01:32,000
By the end of the century, there was nothing left

28
0:01:33.903,000 --> 0:01:37,000
but these beautiful skins in museum specimen drawers.

29
0:01:38.743,000 --> 0:01:39,000
There's an upside to the story.

30
0:01:40.618,000 --> 0:01:41,000
This made people realize that the same thing

31
0:01:42.532,000 --> 0:01:44,000
was about to happen to the American bison,

32
0:01:45.024,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and so these birds saved the buffalos.

33
0:01:48.429,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But a lot of other animals weren't saved.

34
0:01:50.103,000 --> 0:01:54,000
The Carolina parakeet was a parrot that lit up backyards everywhere.

35
0:01:54.894,000 --> 0:01:56,000
It was hunted to death for its feathers.

36
0:01:57.24,000 --> 0:02:,000
There was a bird that people liked on the East Coast called the heath hen.

37
0:02:00.342,000 --> 0:02:03,000
It was loved. They tried to protect it. It died anyway.

38
0:02:03.351,000 --> 0:02:06,000
A local newspaper spelled out, "There is no survivor,

39
0:02:06.725,000 --> 0:02:1,000
there is no future, there is no life to be recreated in this form ever again."

40
0:02:11.542,000 --> 0:02:13,000
There's a sense of deep tragedy that goes with these things,

41
0:02:14.213,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and it happened to lots of birds that people loved.

42
0:02:16.638,000 --> 0:02:18,000
It happened to lots of mammals.

43
0:02:18.846,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Another keystone species is a famous animal

44
0:02:21.469,000 --> 0:02:23,000
called the European aurochs.

45
0:02:23.534,000 --> 0:02:25,000
There was sort of a movie made about it recently.

46
0:02:25.989,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And the aurochs was like the bison.

47
0:02:28.597,000 --> 0:02:31,000
This was an animal that basically kept the forest

48
0:02:31.777,000 --> 0:02:36,000
mixed with grasslands across the entire Europe and Asian continent,

49
0:02:36.829,000 --> 0:02:38,000
from Spain to Korea.

50
0:02:39.173,000 --> 0:02:41,000
The documentation of this animal goes back

51
0:02:41.301,000 --> 0:02:44,000
to the Lascaux cave paintings.

52
0:02:44.526,000 --> 0:02:46,000
The extinctions still go on.

53
0:02:46.718,000 --> 0:02:49,000
There's an ibex in Spain called the bucardo.

54
0:02:49.747,000 --> 0:02:51,000
It went extinct in 2000.

55
0:02:52.093,000 --> 0:02:54,000
There was a marvelous animal, a marsupial wolf

56
0:02:54.85,000 --> 0:02:57,000
called the thylacine in Tasmania, south of Australia,

57
0:02:58.581,000 --> 0:03:,000
called the Tasmanian tiger.

58
0:03:00.651,000 --> 0:03:04,000
It was hunted until there were just a few left to die in zoos.

59
0:03:04.969,000 --> 0:03:07,000
A little bit of film was shot.

60
0:03:18.853,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Sorrow, anger, mourning.

61
0:03:24.11,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Don't mourn. Organize.

62
0:03:27.266,000 --> 0:03:3,000
What if you could find out that, using the DNA in museum specimens,

63
0:03:30.885,000 --> 0:03:32,000
fossils maybe up to 200,000 years old

64
0:03:33.882,000 --> 0:03:35,000
could be used to bring species back,

65
0:03:36.32,000 --> 0:03:37,000
what would you do? Where would you start?

66
0:03:37.944,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Well, you'd start by finding out if the biotech is really there.

67
0:03:40.858,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I started with my wife, Ryan Phelan,

68
0:03:42.95,000 --> 0:03:45,000
who ran a biotech business called DNA Direct,

69
0:03:46.084,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and through her, one of her colleagues, George Church,

70
0:03:50.133,000 --> 0:03:52,000
one of the leading genetic engineers

71
0:03:52.828,000 --> 0:03:55,000
who turned out to be also obsessed with passenger pigeons

72
0:03:55.837,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and a lot of confidence

73
0:03:57.448,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that methodologies he was working on

74
0:03:59.76,000 --> 0:04:01,000
might actually do the deed.

75
0:04:01.849,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So he and Ryan organized and hosted a meeting

76
0:04:05.104,000 --> 0:04:07,000
at the Wyss Institute in Harvard bringing together

77
0:04:07.368,000 --> 0:04:11,000
specialists on passenger pigeons, conservation ornithologists, bioethicists,

78
0:04:11.979,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and fortunately passenger pigeon DNA had already been sequenced

79
0:04:16.092,000 --> 0:04:19,000
by a molecular biologist named Beth Shapiro.

80
0:04:19.383,000 --> 0:04:21,000
All she needed from those specimens at the Smithsonian

81
0:04:22.262,000 --> 0:04:24,000
was a little bit of toe pad tissue,

82
0:04:24.917,000 --> 0:04:27,000
because down in there is what is called ancient DNA.

83
0:04:28.3,000 --> 0:04:3,000
It's DNA which is pretty badly fragmented,

84
0:04:31.272,000 --> 0:04:35,000
but with good techniques now, you can basically reassemble the whole genome.

85
0:04:36.164,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Then the question is, can you reassemble,

86
0:04:38.485,000 --> 0:04:4,000
with that genome, the whole bird?

87
0:04:40.98,000 --> 0:04:42,000
George Church thinks you can.

88
0:04:43.484,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So in his book, "Regenesis," which I recommend,

89
0:04:46.549,000 --> 0:04:49,000
he has a chapter on the science of bringing back extinct species,

90
0:04:50.012,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and he has a machine called

91
0:04:51.548,000 --> 0:04:54,000
the Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering machine.

92
0:04:54.996,000 --> 0:04:55,000
It's kind of like an evolution machine.

93
0:04:56.73,000 --> 0:04:58,000
You try combinations of genes that you write

94
0:04:59.436,000 --> 0:05:02,000
at the cell level and then in organs on a chip,

95
0:05:02.676,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and the ones that win, that you can then put

96
0:05:04.585,000 --> 0:05:06,000
into a living organism. It'll work.

97
0:05:07.282,000 --> 0:05:1,000
The precision of this, one of George's famous unreadable slides,

98
0:05:10.476,000 --> 0:05:14,000
nevertheless points out that there's a level of precision here

99
0:05:15.075,000 --> 0:05:17,000
right down to the individual base pair.

100
0:05:17.641,000 --> 0:05:21,000
The passenger pigeon has 1.3 billion base pairs in its genome.

101
0:05:21.78,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So what you're getting is the capability now

102
0:05:24.785,000 --> 0:05:27,000
of replacing one gene with another variation of that gene.

103
0:05:28.31,000 --> 0:05:29,000
It's called an allele.

104
0:05:30.213,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Well that's what happens in normal hybridization anyway.

105
0:05:33.063,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So this is a form of synthetic hybridization of the genome

106
0:05:36.254,000 --> 0:05:37,000
of an extinct species

107
0:05:38.134,000 --> 0:05:41,000
with the genome of its closest living relative.

108
0:05:41.664,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Now along the way, George points out that

109
0:05:44.379,000 --> 0:05:47,000
his technology, the technology of synthetic biology,

110
0:05:48.19,000 --> 0:05:51,000
is currently accelerating at four times the rate of Moore's Law.

111
0:05:51.996,000 --> 0:05:55,000
It's been doing that since 2005, and it's likely to continue.

112
0:05:56.284,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Okay, the closest living relative of the passenger pigeon

113
0:05:58.988,000 --> 0:06:01,000
is the band-tailed pigeon. They're abundant. There's some around here.

114
0:06:02.282,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Genetically, the band-tailed pigeon already is

115
0:06:06.37,000 --> 0:06:08,000
mostly living passenger pigeon.

116
0:06:08.738,000 --> 0:06:1,000
There's just some bits that are band-tailed pigeon.

117
0:06:11.173,000 --> 0:06:13,000
If you replace those bits with passenger pigeon bits,

118
0:06:13.917,000 --> 0:06:17,000
you've got the extinct bird back, cooing at you.

119
0:06:18.132,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Now, there's work to do.

120
0:06:20.04,000 --> 0:06:22,000
You have to figure out exactly what genes matter.

121
0:06:22.754,000 --> 0:06:24,000
So there's genes for the short tail in the band-tailed pigeon,

122
0:06:25.396,000 --> 0:06:27,000
genes for the long tail in the passenger pigeon,

123
0:06:28.096,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and so on with the red eye, peach-colored breast, flocking, and so on.

124
0:06:31.654,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Add them all up and the result won't be perfect.

125
0:06:34.525,000 --> 0:06:35,000
But it should be be perfect enough,

126
0:06:36.503,000 --> 0:06:38,000
because nature doesn't do perfect either.

127
0:06:39.149,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So this meeting in Boston led to three things.

128
0:06:43.325,000 --> 0:06:46,000
First off, Ryan and I decided to create a nonprofit

129
0:06:46.871,000 --> 0:06:49,000
called Revive and Restore that would push de-extinction generally

130
0:06:50.524,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and try to have it go in a responsible way,

131
0:06:53.675,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and we would push ahead with the passenger pigeon.

132
0:06:56.963,000 --> 0:07:,000
Another direct result was a young grad student named Ben Novak,

133
0:07:01.028,000 --> 0:07:04,000
who had been obsessed with passenger pigeons since he was 14

134
0:07:04.284,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and had also learned how to work with ancient DNA,

135
0:07:07.347,000 --> 0:07:1,000
himself sequenced the passenger pigeon,

136
0:07:10.658,000 --> 0:07:12,000
using money from his family and friends.

137
0:07:13.273,000 --> 0:07:15,000
We hired him full-time.

138
0:07:15.42,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Now, this photograph I took of him last year at the Smithsonian,

139
0:07:19.084,000 --> 0:07:21,000
he's looking down at Martha,

140
0:07:21.315,000 --> 0:07:23,000
the last passenger pigeon alive.

141
0:07:24.1,000 --> 0:07:26,000
So if he's successful, she won't be the last.

142
0:07:26.835,000 --> 0:07:28,000
The third result of the Boston meeting was the realization

143
0:07:29.717,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that there are scientists all over the world

144
0:07:31.55,000 --> 0:07:32,000
working on various forms of de-extinction,

145
0:07:33.524,000 --> 0:07:34,000
but they'd never met each other.

146
0:07:35.339,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And National Geographic got interested

147
0:07:37.323,000 --> 0:07:39,000
because National Geographic has the theory that

148
0:07:39.806,000 --> 0:07:42,000
the last century, discovery was basically finding things,

149
0:07:43.179,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and in this century, discovery is basically making things.

150
0:07:47.256,000 --> 0:07:48,000
De-extinction falls in that category.

151
0:07:49.08,000 --> 0:07:52,000
So they hosted and funded this meeting. And 35 scientists,

152
0:07:52.914,000 --> 0:07:55,000
they were conservation biologists and molecular biologists,

153
0:07:56.194,000 --> 0:07:59,000
basically meeting to see if they had work to do together.

154
0:07:59.61,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Some of these conservation biologists are pretty radical.

155
0:08:01.976,000 --> 0:08:04,000
There's three of them who are not just re-creating ancient species,

156
0:08:05.538,000 --> 0:08:08,000
they're recreating extinct ecosystems

157
0:08:08.659,000 --> 0:08:11,000
in northern Siberia, in the Netherlands, and in Hawaii.

158
0:08:12.527,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Henri, from the Netherlands,

159
0:08:14.802,000 --> 0:08:16,000
with a Dutch last name I won't try to pronounce,

160
0:08:17.493,000 --> 0:08:19,000
is working on the aurochs.

161
0:08:19.738,000 --> 0:08:23,000
The aurochs is the ancestor of all domestic cattle,

162
0:08:24.091,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and so basically its genome is alive, it's just unevenly distributed.

163
0:08:29.665,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So what they're doing is working with seven breeds

164
0:08:32.079,000 --> 0:08:36,000
of primitive, hardy-looking cattle like that Maremmana primitivo on the top there

165
0:08:36.834,000 --> 0:08:39,000
to rebuild, over time, with selective back-breeding,

166
0:08:40.299,000 --> 0:08:42,000
the aurochs.

167
0:08:42.362,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Now, re-wilding is moving faster in Korea

168
0:08:45.395,000 --> 0:08:46,000
than it is in America,

169
0:08:47.254,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and so the plan is, with these re-wilded areas all over Europe,

170
0:08:50.914,000 --> 0:08:53,000
they will introduce the aurochs to do its old job,

171
0:08:54.122,000 --> 0:08:55,000
its old ecological role,

172
0:08:56.064,000 --> 0:08:59,000
of clearing the somewhat barren, closed-canopy forest

173
0:08:59.323,000 --> 0:09:02,000
so that it has these biodiverse meadows in it.

174
0:09:03.134,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Another amazing story

175
0:09:04.949,000 --> 0:09:07,000
came from Alberto Fernández-Arias.

176
0:09:08.347,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Alberto worked with the bucardo in Spain.

177
0:09:11.666,000 --> 0:09:13,000
The last bucardo was a female named Celia

178
0:09:14.499,000 --> 0:09:18,000
who was still alive, but then they captured her,

179
0:09:19.062,000 --> 0:09:21,000
they got a little bit of tissue from her ear,

180
0:09:21.474,000 --> 0:09:24,000
they cryopreserved it in liquid nitrogen,

181
0:09:24.658,000 --> 0:09:25,000
released her back into the wild,

182
0:09:26.444,000 --> 0:09:29,000
but a few months later, she was found dead under a fallen tree.

183
0:09:30.194,000 --> 0:09:32,000
They took the DNA from that ear,

184
0:09:32.802,000 --> 0:09:35,000
they planted it as a cloned egg in a goat,

185
0:09:36.242,000 --> 0:09:38,000
the pregnancy came to term,

186
0:09:38.316,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and a live baby bucardo was born.

187
0:09:40.531,000 --> 0:09:42,000
It was the first de-extinction in history.

188
0:09:43.379,000 --> 0:09:46,000
(Applause)

189
0:09:46.922,000 --> 0:09:47,000
It was short-lived.

190
0:09:48.149,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Sometimes interspecies clones have respiration problems.

191
0:09:51.787,000 --> 0:09:54,000
This one had a malformed lung and died after 10 minutes,

192
0:09:54.828,000 --> 0:09:57,000
but Alberto was confident that

193
0:09:57.908,000 --> 0:09:59,000
cloning has moved along well since then,

194
0:10:00.308,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and this will move ahead, and eventually

195
0:10:01.847,000 --> 0:10:03,000
there will be a population of bucardos

196
0:10:03.854,000 --> 0:10:06,000
back in the mountains in northern Spain.

197
0:10:07.111,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Cryopreservation pioneer of great depth is Oliver Ryder.

198
0:10:10.937,000 --> 0:10:12,000
At the San Diego zoo, his frozen zoo

199
0:10:13.324,000 --> 0:10:16,000
has collected the tissues from over 1,000 species

200
0:10:17.275,000 --> 0:10:19,000
over the last 35 years.

201
0:10:20.253,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Now, when it's frozen that deep,

202
0:10:22.284,000 --> 0:10:24,000
minus 196 degrees Celsius,

203
0:10:25.004,000 --> 0:10:27,000
the cells are intact and the DNA is intact.

204
0:10:27.636,000 --> 0:10:29,000
They're basically viable cells,

205
0:10:29.713,000 --> 0:10:32,000
so someone like Bob Lanza at Advanced Cell Technology

206
0:10:33.341,000 --> 0:10:36,000
took some of that tissue from an endangered animal

207
0:10:36.556,000 --> 0:10:38,000
called the Javan banteng, put it in a cow,

208
0:10:38.75,000 --> 0:10:41,000
the cow went to term, and what was born

209
0:10:41.8,000 --> 0:10:46,000
was a live, healthy baby Javan banteng,

210
0:10:46.881,000 --> 0:10:49,000
who thrived and is still alive.

211
0:10:50.284,000 --> 0:10:52,000
The most exciting thing for Bob Lanza

212
0:10:53.06,000 --> 0:10:55,000
is the ability now to take any kind of cell

213
0:10:55.748,000 --> 0:10:57,000
with induced pluripotent stem cells

214
0:10:58.196,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and turn it into germ cells, like sperm and eggs.

215
0:11:02.169,000 --> 0:11:04,000
So now we go to Mike McGrew

216
0:11:04.452,000 --> 0:11:07,000
who is a scientist at Roslin Institute in Scotland,

217
0:11:07.948,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and Mike's doing miracles with birds.

218
0:11:10.252,000 --> 0:11:13,000
So he'll take, say, falcon skin cells, fibroblast,

219
0:11:13.772,000 --> 0:11:15,000
turn it into induced pluripotent stem cells.

220
0:11:16.56,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Since it's so pluripotent, it can become germ plasm.

221
0:11:19.99,000 --> 0:11:21,000
He then has a way to put the germ plasm

222
0:11:22.246,000 --> 0:11:25,000
into the embryo of a chicken egg

223
0:11:25.79,000 --> 0:11:28,000
so that that chicken will have, basically,

224
0:11:29.061,000 --> 0:11:3,000
the gonads of a falcon.

225
0:11:30.902,000 --> 0:11:31,000
You get a male and a female each of those,

226
0:11:32.816,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and out of them comes falcons.

227
0:11:35.757,000 --> 0:11:36,000
(Laughter)

228
0:11:37.716,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Real falcons out of slightly doctored chickens.

229
0:11:42.841,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Ben Novak was the youngest scientist at the meeting.

230
0:11:45.318,000 --> 0:11:47,000
He showed how all of this can be put together.

231
0:11:47.747,000 --> 0:11:49,000
The sequence of events: he'll put together the genomes

232
0:11:50.293,000 --> 0:11:52,000
of the band-tailed pigeon and the passenger pigeon,

233
0:11:52.671,000 --> 0:11:54,000
he'll take the techniques of George Church

234
0:11:55.621,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and get passenger pigeon DNA,

235
0:11:57.902,000 --> 0:11:59,000
the techniques of Robert Lanza and Michael McGrew,

236
0:12:00.587,000 --> 0:12:02,000
get that DNA into chicken gonads,

237
0:12:02.846,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and out of the chicken gonads get passenger pigeon eggs, squabs,

238
0:12:07.065,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and now you're getting a population of passenger pigeons.

239
0:12:10.551,000 --> 0:12:11,000
It does raise the question of,

240
0:12:12.495,000 --> 0:12:13,000
they're not going to have passenger pigeon parents

241
0:12:14.468,000 --> 0:12:16,000
to teach them how to be a passenger pigeon.

242
0:12:17.094,000 --> 0:12:19,000
So what do you do about that?

243
0:12:19.35,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Well birds are pretty hard-wired, as it happens,

244
0:12:22.023,000 --> 0:12:24,000
so most of that is already in their DNA,

245
0:12:24.39,000 --> 0:12:26,000
but to supplement it, part of Ben's idea

246
0:12:27.174,000 --> 0:12:28,000
is to use homing pigeons

247
0:12:28.83,000 --> 0:12:31,000
to help train the young passenger pigeons how to flock

248
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and how to find their way to their old nesting grounds

249
0:12:34.734,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and feeding grounds.

250
0:12:37.883,000 --> 0:12:38,000
There were some conservationists,

251
0:12:39.521,000 --> 0:12:42,000
really famous conservationists like Stanley Temple,

252
0:12:42.597,000 --> 0:12:44,000
who is one of the founders of conservation biology,

253
0:12:45.213,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and Kate Jones from the IUCN, which does the Red List.

254
0:12:49.869,000 --> 0:12:5,000
They're excited about all this,

255
0:12:51.83,000 --> 0:12:53,000
but they're also concerned that it might be competitive

256
0:12:54.333,000 --> 0:12:57,000
with the extremely important efforts to protect

257
0:12:57.371,000 --> 0:12:59,000
endangered species that are still alive,

258
0:12:59.581,000 --> 0:13:,000
that haven't gone extinct yet.

259
0:13:01.427,000 --> 0:13:03,000
You see, you want to work on protecting the animals out there.

260
0:13:03.8,000 --> 0:13:07,000
You want to work on getting the market for ivory in Asia down

261
0:13:08.029,000 --> 0:13:11,000
so you're not using 25,000 elephants a year.

262
0:13:11.907,000 --> 0:13:14,000
But at the same time, conservation biologists are realizing

263
0:13:14.957,000 --> 0:13:16,000
that bad news bums people out.

264
0:13:17.541,000 --> 0:13:19,000
And so the Red List is really important, keep track of

265
0:13:20.266,000 --> 0:13:23,000
what's endangered and critically endangered, and so on.

266
0:13:23.59,000 --> 0:13:26,000
But they're about to create what they call a Green List,

267
0:13:26.615,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and the Green List will have species that are doing fine, thank you,

268
0:13:30.997,000 --> 0:13:32,000
species that were endangered, like the bald eagle,

269
0:13:33.301,000 --> 0:13:36,000
but they're much better off now, thanks to everybody's good work,

270
0:13:36.916,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and protected areas around the world

271
0:13:39.082,000 --> 0:13:4,000
that are very, very well managed.

272
0:13:40.843,000 --> 0:13:44,000
So basically, they're learning how to build on good news.

273
0:13:44.946,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And they see reviving extinct species

274
0:13:48.057,000 --> 0:13:5,000
as the kind of good news you might be able to build on.

275
0:13:50.937,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Here's a couple related examples.

276
0:13:54.262,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Captive breeding will be a major part of bringing back these species.

277
0:13:57.473,000 --> 0:14:,000
The California condor was down to 22 birds in 1987.

278
0:14:00.889,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Everybody thought is was finished.

279
0:14:02.598,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Thanks to captive breeding at the San Diego Zoo,

280
0:14:05.418,000 --> 0:14:09,000
there's 405 of them now, 226 are out in the wild.

281
0:14:09.438,000 --> 0:14:13,000
That technology will be used on de-extincted animals.

282
0:14:13.647,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Another success story is the mountain gorilla in Central Africa.

283
0:14:17.114,000 --> 0:14:2,000
In 1981, Dian Fossey was sure they were going extinct.

284
0:14:20.497,000 --> 0:14:22,000
There were just 254 left.

285
0:14:22.53,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Now there are 880. They're increasing in population

286
0:14:26.069,000 --> 0:14:28,000
by three percent a year.

287
0:14:28.162,000 --> 0:14:31,000
The secret is, they have an eco-tourism program,

288
0:14:31.553,000 --> 0:14:32,000
which is absolutely brilliant.

289
0:14:33.222,000 --> 0:14:35,000
So this photograph was taken last month by Ryan

290
0:14:35.857,000 --> 0:14:37,000
with an iPhone.

291
0:14:38.633,000 --> 0:14:42,000
That's how comfortable these wild gorillas are with visitors.

292
0:14:42.948,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Another interesting project, though it's going to need some help,

293
0:14:46.683,000 --> 0:14:47,000
is the northern white rhinoceros.

294
0:14:48.594,000 --> 0:14:49,000
There's no breeding pairs left.

295
0:14:50.555,000 --> 0:14:52,000
But this is the kind of thing that

296
0:14:52.725,000 --> 0:14:56,000
a wide variety of DNA for this animal is available in the frozen zoo.

297
0:14:56.865,000 --> 0:14:58,000
A bit of cloning, you can get them back.

298
0:14:59.66,000 --> 0:15:01,000
So where do we go from here?

299
0:15:01.85,000 --> 0:15:02,000
These have been private meetings so far.

300
0:15:03.514,000 --> 0:15:05,000
I think it's time for the subject to go public.

301
0:15:06.171,000 --> 0:15:07,000
What do people think about it?

302
0:15:07.638,000 --> 0:15:09,000
You know, do you want extinct species back?

303
0:15:09.717,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Do you want extinct species back?

304
0:15:12.569,000 --> 0:15:17,000
(Applause)

305
0:15:17.835,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Tinker Bell is going to come fluttering down.

306
0:15:20.331,000 --> 0:15:21,000
It is a Tinker Bell moment,

307
0:15:21.545,000 --> 0:15:23,000
because what are people excited about with this?

308
0:15:23.941,000 --> 0:15:25,000
What are they concerned about?

309
0:15:25.992,000 --> 0:15:27,000
We're also going to push ahead with the passenger pigeon.

310
0:15:28.439,000 --> 0:15:31,000
So Ben Novak, even as we speak, is joining the group

311
0:15:32.209,000 --> 0:15:35,000
that Beth Shapiro has at UC Santa Cruz.

312
0:15:35.53,000 --> 0:15:36,000
They're going to work on the genomes

313
0:15:36.918,000 --> 0:15:38,000
of the passenger pigeon and the band-tailed pigeon.

314
0:15:39.205,000 --> 0:15:42,000
As that data matures, they'll send it to George Church,

315
0:15:43.114,000 --> 0:15:46,000
who will work his magic, get passenger pigeon DNA out of that.

316
0:15:47.009,000 --> 0:15:49,000
We'll get help from Bob Lanza and Mike McGrew

317
0:15:49.853,000 --> 0:15:52,000
to get that into germ plasm that can go into chickens

318
0:15:52.92,000 --> 0:15:54,000
that can produce passenger pigeon squabs

319
0:15:55.488,000 --> 0:15:57,000
that can be raised by band-tailed pigeon parents,

320
0:15:57.952,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and then from then on, it's passenger pigeons all the way,

321
0:16:00.208,000 --> 0:16:03,000
maybe for the next six million years.

322
0:16:03.344,000 --> 0:16:05,000
You can do the same thing, as the costs come down,

323
0:16:05.659,000 --> 0:16:08,000
for the Carolina parakeet, for the great auk,

324
0:16:08.881,000 --> 0:16:1,000
for the heath hen, for the ivory-billed woodpecker,

325
0:16:11.676,000 --> 0:16:13,000
for the Eskimo curlew, for the Caribbean monk seal,

326
0:16:13.782,000 --> 0:16:15,000
for the woolly mammoth.

327
0:16:16.648,000 --> 0:16:18,000
Because the fact is, humans have made a huge hole

328
0:16:19.124,000 --> 0:16:22,000
in nature in the last 10,000 years.

329
0:16:22.214,000 --> 0:16:24,000
We have the ability now,

330
0:16:24.253,000 --> 0:16:28,000
and maybe the moral obligation, to repair some of the damage.

331
0:16:29.117,000 --> 0:16:33,000
Most of that we'll do by expanding and protecting wildlands,

332
0:16:33.665,000 --> 0:16:34,000
by expanding and protecting

333
0:16:35.334,000 --> 0:16:39,000
the populations of endangered species.

334
0:16:39.861,000 --> 0:16:41,000
But some species

335
0:16:42.016,000 --> 0:16:47,000
that we killed off totally

336
0:16:47.199,000 --> 0:16:5,000
we could consider bringing back

337
0:16:50.513,000 --> 0:16:53,000
to a world that misses them.

338
0:16:53.68,000 --> 0:16:55,000
Thank you.

339
0:16:55.89,000 --> 0:17:06,000
(Applause)

340
0:17:07.088,000 --> 0:17:08,000
Chris Anderson: Thank you.

341
0:17:08.942,000 --> 0:17:09,000
I've got a question.

342
0:17:10.754,000 --> 0:17:14,000
So, this is an emotional topic. Some people stand.

343
0:17:15.504,000 --> 0:17:17,000
I suspect there are some people out there sitting,

344
0:17:18.36,000 --> 0:17:21,000
kind of asking tormented questions, almost, about,

345
0:17:21.369,000 --> 0:17:22,000
well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute,

346
0:17:23.279,000 --> 0:17:26,000
there's something wrong with mankind

347
0:17:26.376,000 --> 0:17:29,000
interfering in nature in this way.

348
0:17:29.856,000 --> 0:17:32,000
There's going to be unintended consequences.

349
0:17:33.328,000 --> 0:17:35,000
You're going to uncork some sort of Pandora's box

350
0:17:36.105,000 --> 0:17:39,000
of who-knows-what. Do they have a point?

351
0:17:40.091,000 --> 0:17:41,000
Stewart Brand: Well, the earlier point is

352
0:17:41.591,000 --> 0:17:44,000
we interfered in a big way by making these animals go extinct,

353
0:17:45.142,000 --> 0:17:47,000
and many of them were keystone species,

354
0:17:47.683,000 --> 0:17:49,000
and we changed the whole ecosystem they were in

355
0:17:50.192,000 --> 0:17:51,000
by letting them go.

356
0:17:51.985,000 --> 0:17:53,000
Now, there's the shifting baseline problem, which is,

357
0:17:54.566,000 --> 0:17:55,000
so when these things come back,

358
0:17:56.104,000 --> 0:17:58,000
they might replace some birds that are there

359
0:17:58.395,000 --> 0:18:,000
that people really know and love.

360
0:18:00.789,000 --> 0:18:02,000
I think that's, you know, part of how it'll work.

361
0:18:03.536,000 --> 0:18:05,000
This is a long, slow process --

362
0:18:06.421,000 --> 0:18:08,000
One of the things I like about it, it's multi-generation.

363
0:18:08.655,000 --> 0:18:1,000
We will get woolly mammoths back.

364
0:18:10.712,000 --> 0:18:11,000
CA: Well it feels like both the conversation

365
0:18:12.488,000 --> 0:18:14,000
and the potential here are pretty thrilling.

366
0:18:14.776,000 --> 0:18:15,000
Thank you so much for presenting. SB: Thank you.

367
0:18:16.49,000 --> 0:18:18,000
CA: Thank you. (Applause)

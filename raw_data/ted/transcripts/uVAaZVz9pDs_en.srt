1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'm going to talk to you today about my work on suspended animation.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Now, usually when I mention suspended animation,

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
people will flash me the Vulcan sign and laugh.

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
But now, I'm not talking about gorking people out

5
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
to fly to Mars or even Pandora,

6
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
as much fun as that may be.

7
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I'm talking about

8
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
the concept of using suspended animation

9
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
to help people out in trauma.

10
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So what do I mean

11
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
when I say "suspended animation"?

12
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
It is the process by which

13
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
animals de-animate,

14
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
appear dead

15
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
and then can wake up again without being harmed.

16
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
OK, so here is the sort of big idea:

17
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
If you look out at nature,

18
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
you find that

19
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
as you tend to see suspended animation,

20
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
you tend to see immortality.

21
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And so, what I'm going to tell you about

22
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
is a way to tell a person who's in trauma --

23
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
find a way to de-animate them a bit

24
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
so they're a little more immortal

25
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
when they have that heart attack.

26
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
An example of an organism or two

27
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
that happens to be quite immortal

28
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
would be plant seeds

29
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
or bacterial spores.

30
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
These creatures are

31
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
some of the most immortal life forms on our planet,

32
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and they tend to spend most of their time

33
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
in suspended animation.

34
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Bacterial spores are thought now by scientists

35
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
to exist as individual cells

36
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
that are alive, but in suspended animation

37
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
for as long as 250 million years.

38
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
To suggest that this all, sort of, about little, tiny creatures,

39
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I want to bring it close to home.

40
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
In the immortal germ line

41
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
of human beings --

42
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that is, the eggs that sit in the ovaries --

43
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
they actually sit there in a state of suspended animation

44
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
for up to 50 years in the life of each woman.

45
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So then there's also my favorite example

46
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
of suspended animation.

47
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
This is Sea-Monkeys.

48
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Those of you with children,

49
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
you know about them.

50
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
You go to the pet store or the toy store,

51
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and you can buy these things.

52
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
You just open the bag, and you just dump them

53
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
into the plastic aquarium,

54
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and in about a week or so, you'll have little shrimps swimming around.

55
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Well, I wasn't so interested in the swimming.

56
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I was interested in what was going on in the bag,

57
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
the bag on the toy store shelf

58
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
where those shrimp sat

59
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
in suspended animation indefinitely.

60
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So these ideas of suspended animation

61
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
are not just about cells and weird, little organisms.

62
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Occasionally, human beings

63
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
are briefly de-animated,

64
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and the stories of people who are briefly de-animated

65
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that interest me the most

66
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
are those having to do with the cold.

67
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Ten years ago, there was a skier in Norway

68
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
that was trapped in an icy waterfall,

69
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and she was there for two hours before they extracted her.

70
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
She was extremely cold,

71
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and she had no heartbeat --

72
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
for all intents and purposes she was dead, frozen.

73
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Seven hours later,

74
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
still without a heartbeat,

75
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
they brought her back to life, and she went on to be

76
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
the head radiologist

77
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
in the hospital that treated her.

78
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
A couple of years later --

79
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
so I get really excited about these things --

80
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
about a couple of years later,

81
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
there was a 13-month-old, she was from Canada.

82
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Her father had gone out in the wintertime; he was working night shift,

83
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
and she followed him outside in nothing but a diaper.

84
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And they found her hours later,

85
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
frozen, lifeless,

86
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and they brought her back to life.

87
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
There was a 65-year-old woman

88
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
in Duluth, Minnesota last year

89
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that was found frozen and without a pulse

90
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
in her front yard one morning in the winter,

91
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and they brought her back to life.

92
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
The next day, she was doing so well, they wanted to run tests on her.

93
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
She got cranky and just went home.

94
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
(Laughter)

95
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So, these are miracles, right?

96
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
These are truly miraculous things that happen.

97
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Doctors have a saying

98
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that, in fact, "You're not dead until you're warm and dead."

99
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And it's true. It's true.

100
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
In the New England Journal of Medicine,

101
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
there was a study published that showed

102
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that with appropriate rewarming,

103
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
people who had suffered without a heartbeat for three hours

104
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
could be brought back to life without any neurologic problems.

105
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
That's over 50 percent.

106
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So what I was trying to do is think of a way

107
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
that we could study

108
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
suspended animation

109
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to think about a way

110
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
to reproduce, maybe,

111
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
what happened to the skier.

112
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Well, I have to tell you something very odd,

113
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and that is that being exposed to low oxygen

114
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
does not always kill.

115
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So, in this room, there's 20 percent oxygen or so,

116
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and if we reduce the oxygen concentration,

117
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
we will all be dead.

118
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And, in fact, the animals we were working with in the lab --

119
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
these little garden worms, nematodes --

120
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
they were also dead when we exposed them to low oxygen.

121
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And here's the thing that should freak you out.

122
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And that is that, when we lower the oxygen concentration further

123
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
by 100 times, to 10 parts per million,

124
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
they were not dead,

125
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
they were in suspended animation,

126
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and we could bring them back to life without any harm.

127
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And this precise oxygen concentration,

128
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
10 parts per million,

129
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that caused suspended animation,

130
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
is conserved.

131
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
We can see it in a variety of different organisms.

132
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
One of the creatures we see it in

133
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
is a fish.

134
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
And we can turn its heartbeat on and off by going in and out

135
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
of suspended animation like you would a light switch.

136
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
So this was pretty shocking to me,

137
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
that we could do this.

138
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And so I was wondering, when we were trying

139
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
to reproduce the work with the skier,

140
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
that we noticed that, of course,

141
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
she had no oxygen consumption,

142
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and so maybe she was in a similar state of suspended animation.

143
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
But, of course, she was also extremely cold.

144
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
So we wondered what would happen

145
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
if we took our suspended animals and exposed them to the cold.

146
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And so, what we found out

147
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
was that, if you take animals

148
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that are animated like you and I,

149
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and you make them cold -- that is, these were the garden worms --

150
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
now they're dead.

151
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
But if you have them in suspended animation,

152
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and move them into the cold, they're all alive.

153
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And there's the very important thing there:

154
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
If you want to survive the cold,

155
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
you ought to be suspended. Right?

156
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
It's a really good thing.

157
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And so, we were thinking about that,

158
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
about this relationship between these things,

159
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
and thinking about whether or not that's what happened to the skier.

160
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And so we wondered: Might there be some agent

161
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that is in us, something that we make ourselves,

162
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
that we might be able to regulate our own metabolic flexibility

163
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
in such a way as to be able to survive

164
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
when we got extremely cold, and might otherwise pass away?

165
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I thought it might be interesting to sort of hunt for such things.

166
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
You know?

167
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I should mention briefly here

168
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that physiology textbooks that you can read about

169
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
will tell you that this is a kind of heretical thing to suggest.

170
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
We have, from the time we are slapped on the butt

171
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
until we take our last dying breath --

172
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that's when we're newborn to when we're dead --

173
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
we cannot reduce our metabolic rate

174
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
below what's called a standard,

175
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
or basal metabolic rate.

176
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
But I knew that there were examples

177
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
of creatures, also mammals,

178
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
that do reduce their metabolic rate

179
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
such as ground squirrels and bears,

180
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
they reduce their metabolic rate

181
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
in the wintertime when they hibernate.

182
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
So I wondered: Might we be able to find some agent or trigger

183
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
that might induce such a state in us?

184
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And so, we went looking for such things.

185
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And this was a period of time when we failed tremendously.

186
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Ken Robinson is here. He talked about the glories of failure.

187
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Well, we had a lot of them.

188
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
We tried many different chemicals and agents,

189
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and we failed over and over again.

190
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
So, one time, I was at home

191
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
watching television on the couch

192
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
while my wife was putting our child to bed,

193
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and I was watching a television show.

194
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
It was a television show --

195
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
it was a NOVA show on PBS --

196
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
about caves in New Mexico.

197
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And this particular cave was Lechuguilla,

198
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and this cave is incredibly toxic to humans.

199
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
The researchers had to suit up just to enter it.

200
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
It's filled with this toxic gas,

201
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
hydrogen sulfide.

202
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Now, hydrogen sulfide is curiously present in us.

203
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
We make it ourselves.

204
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
The highest concentration is in our brains.

205
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Yet, it was used

206
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
as a chemical warfare agent in World War I.

207
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
It's an extraordinarily toxic thing.

208
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
In fact, in chemical accidents,

209
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
hydrogen sulfide is known to --

210
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
if you breathe too much of it, you collapse to the ground,

211
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
you appear dead,

212
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
but if you were brought out into room air, you can be reanimated without harm,

213
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
if they do that quickly.

214
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
So, I thought, "Wow, I have to get some of this."

215
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
(Laughter)

216
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Now, it's post-9/11 America,

217
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and when you go into the research institute,

218
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and you say, "Hi.

219
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
I'd like to buy some concentrated,

220
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
compressed gas cylinders

221
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
of a lethal gas

222
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
because I have these ideas, see,

223
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
about wanting to suspend people.

224
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
It's really going to be OK."

225
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So that's kind of a tough day,

226
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
but I said, "There really is

227
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
some basis for thinking why you might want to do this."

228
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
As I said, this agent is in us,

229
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
and, in fact, here's a curious thing,

230
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
it binds to the very place inside of your cells

231
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
where oxygen binds, and where you burn it,

232
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and that you do this burning to live.

233
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And so we thought, like in a game of musical chairs,

234
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
might we be able to give a person

235
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
some hydrogen sulfide,

236
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and might it be able to occupy that place

237
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
like in a game of musical chairs where oxygen might bind?

238
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And because you can't bind the oxygen,

239
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
maybe you wouldn't consume it,

240
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and then maybe it would reduce your demand for oxygen.

241
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I mean, who knows?

242
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
So -- (Laughter)

243
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
So, there's the bit about the dopamine

244
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and being a little bit, what do you call it, delusional,

245
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and you might suggest that was it.

246
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And so, we wanted to find out

247
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
might we be able to use

248
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
hydrogen sulfide in the presence of cold,

249
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and we wanted to see whether we could

250
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
reproduce this skier in a mammal.

251
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Now, mammals are warm-blooded creatures,

252
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and when we get cold, we shake and we shiver, right?

253
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
We try to keep our core temperature at 37 degrees

254
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
by actually burning more oxygen.

255
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
So, it was interesting for us

256
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
when we applied hydrogen sulfide

257
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
to a mouse when it was also cold

258
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
because what happened is the core temperature

259
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
of the mouse got cold.

260
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
It stopped moving.

261
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
It appeared dead.

262
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Its oxygen consumption rate

263
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
fell by tenfold.

264
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And here's the really important point.

265
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
I told you hydrogen sulfide is in us.

266
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
It's rapidly metabolized,

267
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and all you have to do after six hours of being

268
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
in this state of de-animation

269
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
is simply put the thing out in room air,

270
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and it warms up, and it's none the worse for wear.

271
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Now, this was cosmic.

272
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Really. Because we had found a way

273
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
to de-animate a mammal,

274
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and it didn't hurt it.

275
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Now, we'd found a way to reduce

276
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
its oxygen consumption

277
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
to rock-bottom levels, and it was fine.

278
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Now, in this state of de-animation,

279
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
it could not go out dancing,

280
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
but it was not dead,

281
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and it was not harmed.

282
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
So we started to think: Is this the agent

283
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
that might have been present in the skier,

284
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and might have she had more of it than someone else,

285
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and might that have been able to reduce

286
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
her demand for oxygen

287
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
before she got so cold that

288
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
she otherwise would have died,

289
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
as we found out with our worm experiments?

290
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
So, we wondered:

291
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Can we do anything useful

292
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
with this capacity to

293
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
control metabolic flexibility?

294
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And one of the things we wondered --

295
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
I'm sure some of you out there are economists,

296
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and you know all about supply and demand.

297
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And when supply is equal to demand,

298
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
everything's fine,

299
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
but when supply falls,

300
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
in this case of oxygen,

301
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and demand stays high, you're dead.

302
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
So, what I just told you

303
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
is we can now reduce demand.

304
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
We ought to be able to lower supply

305
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
to unprecedented low levels without killing the animal.

306
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
And with money we got from DARPA,

307
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
we could show just that.

308
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
If you give mice hydrogen sulfide,

309
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
you can lower their demand for oxygen,

310
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and you can put them into oxygen concentrations

311
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
that are as low as 5,000 feet above the top of Mt. Everest,

312
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and they can sit there for hours, and there's no problem.

313
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Well this was really cool.

314
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
We also found out that we could subject animals

315
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
to otherwise lethal blood loss, and we could save them

316
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
if we gave them hydrogen sulfide.

317
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
So these proof of concept experiments

318
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
led me to say "I should found a company,

319
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and we should take this out to a wider playing field."

320
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
I founded a company called Ikaria

321
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
with others' help.

322
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And this company, the first thing it did

323
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
was make a liquid formulation of hydrogen sulfide

324
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
an injectable form that we could put in

325
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and send it out to physician scientists all over the world

326
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
who work on models of critical care medicine,

327
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and the results are incredibly positive.

328
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
In one model of heart attack,

329
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
animals given hydrogen sulfide

330
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
showed a 70 percent reduction in heart damage

331
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
compared to those who got the standard of care that

332
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
you and I would receive if we were to have a heart attack here today.

333
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Same is true for organ failure,

334
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
when you have loss of function owing to poor perfusion of kidney, of liver,

335
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
acute respiratory distress syndrome

336
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and damage suffered in cardiac-bypass surgery.

337
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
So, these are the thought leaders in trauma medicine

338
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
all over the world saying this is true,

339
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
so it seems that exposure to hydrogen sulfide

340
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
decreases damage that you receive

341
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
from being exposed to otherwise lethal-low oxygen.

342
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
And I should say that the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide

343
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
required to get this benefit

344
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
are low, incredibly low.

345
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
In fact, so low that physicians will not have to lower or dim

346
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
the metabolism of people much at all

347
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
to see the benefit I just mentioned,

348
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
which is a wonderful thing, if you're thinking about adopting this.

349
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
You don't want to be gorking people out

350
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
just to save them, it's really confusing.

351
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
(Laughter)

352
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
So, I want to say that we're in human trials.

353
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Now, and so --

354
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
(Applause)

355
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Thank you. The Phase 1 safety studies are over,

356
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
and we're doing fine, we're now moved on.

357
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
We have to get to Phase 2 and Phase 3. It's going to take us a few years.

358
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
This has all moved very quickly,

359
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
and the mouse experiments

360
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
of hibernating mice happened in 2005;

361
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
the first human studies were done in 2008,

362
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
and we should know in a couple of years

363
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
whether it works or not.

364
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
And this all happened really quickly

365
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
because of a lot of help from a lot of people.

366
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
I want to mention that, first of all,

367
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
my wife, without whom this talk and my work would not be possible,

368
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
so thank you very much.

369
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Also, the brilliant scientists who work at my lab

370
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and also others on staff,

371
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington --

372
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
wonderful place to work.

373
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
And also the wonderful scientists

374
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
and businesspeople at Ikaria.

375
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
One thing those people did out there

376
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
was take this technology of hydrogen sulfide,

377
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
which is this start-up company that's burning venture capital very quickly,

378
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
and they fused it with another company

379
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
that sells another toxic gas

380
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
that's more toxic than hydrogen sulfide,

381
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
and they give it to newborn babies who would otherwise die

382
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
from a failure to be able to oxygenate their tissues properly.

383
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
And this gas that is delivered in over

384
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
a thousand critical care hospitals worldwide,

385
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
now is approved, on label,

386
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
and saves thousands of babies a year

387
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
from certain death.

388
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
(Applause)

389
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
So it's really incredible

390
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
for me to be a part of this.

391
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
And I want to say that I think we're on the path

392
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
of understanding metabolic flexibility

393
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
in a fundamental way,

394
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
and that in the not too distant future,

395
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
an EMT might give an injection of hydrogen sulfide,

396
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
or some related compound,

397
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
to a person suffering severe injuries,

398
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
and that person might de-animate a bit,

399
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
they might become a little more immortal.

400
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Their metabolism will fall

401
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
as though you were dimming a switch on a lamp at home.

402
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
And then, they will have the time, that will buy them the time,

403
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
to be transported to the hospital

404
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
to get the care they need.

405
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
And then, after they get that care --

406
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
like the mouse, like the skier,

407
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
like the 65-year-old woman --

408
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
they'll wake up.

409
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
A miracle?

410
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
We hope not, or maybe we just hope

411
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
to make miracles a little more common.

412
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
Thank you very much.

413
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
(Applause)

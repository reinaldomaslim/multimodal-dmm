1
0:00:13.135,000 --> 0:00:16,000
For my husband, it was love at first sight.

2
0:00:16.976,000 --> 0:00:17,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:18.27,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Here's what happened.

4
0:00:19.889,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Years ago, Rudy,

5
0:00:21.863,000 --> 0:00:25,000
who I had strictly put in the friend zone at the time,

6
0:00:25.95,000 --> 0:00:27,000
came over to my house and met my dad,

7
0:00:28.434,000 --> 0:00:31,000
a pharmaceutical scientist who had just retired

8
0:00:31.576,000 --> 0:00:33,000
after bringing a drug to market.

9
0:00:34.339,000 --> 0:00:35,000
My dad said,

10
0:00:35.696,000 --> 0:00:37,000
"Ah, you probably wouldn't have heard of it.

11
0:00:37.771,000 --> 0:00:38,000
It's for IPF,

12
0:00:39.326,000 --> 0:00:42,000
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis."

13
0:00:42.644,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Rudy paused for a long time, and then he said,

14
0:00:46.588,000 --> 0:00:5,000
"That's the disease that took my father's life 15 years ago."

15
0:00:52.016,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Rudy says that this is the moment he fell in love.

16
0:00:55.127,000 --> 0:00:56,000
(Laughter)

17
0:00:56.919,000 --> 0:00:57,000
With my father.

18
0:00:58.095,000 --> 0:01:,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:00.847,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Even though it was too late for my dad to save his,

20
0:01:04.363,000 --> 0:01:07,000
he felt that destiny had delivered us this full-circle moment.

21
0:01:09.224,000 --> 0:01:13,000
In my family, we have a special love for my father's inventions.

22
0:01:13.589,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And in particular, we have a reverence for his patents.

23
0:01:17.498,000 --> 0:01:2,000
We have framed patents on the wall in our house.

24
0:01:21.887,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And there's a recognition in our family that everything I've been able to do --

25
0:01:26.571,000 --> 0:01:29,000
college, law school, health justice work --

26
0:01:29.96,000 --> 0:01:32,000
all of it is because America enabled my father

27
0:01:33.309,000 --> 0:01:36,000
to fulfill his potential as an inventor.

28
0:01:37.411,000 --> 0:01:41,000
(Applause)

29
0:01:42.363,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Last year, I met the director of the US Patent Office

30
0:01:46.066,000 --> 0:01:47,000
for the first time,

31
0:01:47.281,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and I sent my family a selfie from that office in Virginia.

32
0:01:50.98,000 --> 0:01:51,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:52.005,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I got so many emojis back,

34
0:01:53.924,000 --> 0:01:55,000
you would have thought I had met Beyoncé.

35
0:01:56.349,000 --> 0:01:57,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:58.187,000 --> 0:01:59,000
But truth be told,

37
0:01:59.371,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I was actually there to talk about a problem --

38
0:02:01.776,000 --> 0:02:06,000
how our outdated patent system is fueling the high cost of medicines

39
0:02:06.855,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and costing lives.

40
0:02:09.315,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Today, over two billion people live without access to medicines.

41
0:02:13.696,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And against this global crisis,

42
0:02:15.68,000 --> 0:02:17,000
drug prices are skyrocketing,

43
0:02:17.95,000 --> 0:02:19,000
including in wealthier countries.

44
0:02:20.355,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Thirty-four million Americans have lost a family member or a friend

45
0:02:25.2,000 --> 0:02:26,000
in the last five years,

46
0:02:27.081,000 --> 0:02:29,000
not because the treatment didn't exist,

47
0:02:29.406,000 --> 0:02:31,000
but because they couldn't afford it.

48
0:02:32.287,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Rising drug costs are pushing families into homelessness,

49
0:02:36.248,000 --> 0:02:38,000
seniors into bankruptcy

50
0:02:38.605,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and parents to crowdfunding treatment for their critically ill children.

51
0:02:43.919,000 --> 0:02:46,000
There are many reasons for this crisis,

52
0:02:47.014,000 --> 0:02:5,000
but one is the outdated patent system

53
0:02:50.442,000 --> 0:02:53,000
that America tries to export to the rest of the world.

54
0:02:55.026,000 --> 0:02:57,000
The original intention behind the patent system

55
0:02:57.713,000 --> 0:02:59,000
was to motivate people to invent

56
0:03:00.264,000 --> 0:03:03,000
by rewarding them with a time-limited monopoly.

57
0:03:03.876,000 --> 0:03:07,000
But today, that intention has been distorted beyond recognition.

58
0:03:08.661,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Corporations have teams of lawyers and lobbyists

59
0:03:11.908,000 --> 0:03:16,000
whose sole job is to extend patent protection as long as possible.

60
0:03:17.795,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And they've kept the patent office busy.

61
0:03:20.755,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It took 155 years for the US Patent Office

62
0:03:24.427,000 --> 0:03:26,000
to issue its first five million patents.

63
0:03:27.149,000 --> 0:03:32,000
It took just 27 years for it to issue the next five million.

64
0:03:32.704,000 --> 0:03:35,000
We haven't gotten drastically more inventive.

65
0:03:35.819,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Corporations have gotten drastically better at gaming the system.

66
0:03:40.946,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Drug patents have exploded --

67
0:03:43.224,000 --> 0:03:47,000
between 2006 and 2016, they doubled.

68
0:03:48.246,000 --> 0:03:49,000
But consider this:

69
0:03:50.659,000 --> 0:03:55,000
The vast majority of medicines associated with new drug patents

70
0:03:56.334,000 --> 0:03:57,000
are not new.

71
0:03:57.617,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Nearly eight out of 10 are for existing ones,

72
0:04:01.712,000 --> 0:04:03,000
like insulin or aspirin.

73
0:04:05.133,000 --> 0:04:08,000
My organization, a team of lawyers and scientists,

74
0:04:08.95,000 --> 0:04:13,000
recently conducted an investigation into the 12 best-selling drugs in America.

75
0:04:14.553,000 --> 0:04:16,000
We found that, on average,

76
0:04:16.688,000 --> 0:04:21,000
there are 125 patents filed on each medicine.

77
0:04:22.204,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Often for things we've known how to do for decades,

78
0:04:25.419,000 --> 0:04:27,000
like putting two pills into one.

79
0:04:28.855,000 --> 0:04:31,000
The higher a patent wall a company builds,

80
0:04:31.99,000 --> 0:04:33,000
the longer they hold on to their monopoly.

81
0:04:34.65,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And with no one to compete with,

82
0:04:36.975,000 --> 0:04:38,000
they can set prices at whim.

83
0:04:39.316,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And because these are medicines

84
0:04:41.332,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and not designer watches,

85
0:04:43.443,000 --> 0:04:45,000
we have no choice but to pay.

86
0:04:46.678,000 --> 0:04:5,000
The patent wall is a strategy to block competition.

87
0:04:51.075,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Not for the 14 years maximum

88
0:04:54.292,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that America's founders originally envisioned,

89
0:04:57.987,000 --> 0:05:,000
or the 20 years allowed by law today,

90
0:05:01.395,000 --> 0:05:04,000
but for 40 years or more.

91
0:05:04.854,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Meanwhile, prices on these drugs have continued to increase --

92
0:05:08.703,000 --> 0:05:1,000
68 percent since 2012.

93
0:05:12.306,000 --> 0:05:15,000
That's seven times the rate of inflation.

94
0:05:16.728,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And people are struggling or even dying,

95
0:05:19.371,000 --> 0:05:21,000
because they can't afford the meds.

96
0:05:22.912,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Now I want to be really clear about something.

97
0:05:25.468,000 --> 0:05:29,000
This isn't about making the pharmaceutical industry the bad guy.

98
0:05:29.523,000 --> 0:05:31,000
What I'm talking about today

99
0:05:31.683,000 --> 0:05:34,000
is whether the system we created to promote progress

100
0:05:35.701,000 --> 0:05:37,000
is actually working as intended.

101
0:05:39.121,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Sure, the pharmaceutical companies are gaming the system,

102
0:05:43.058,000 --> 0:05:45,000
but they're gaming it because they can.

103
0:05:46.04,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Because we have failed to adapt this system

104
0:05:49.68,000 --> 0:05:51,000
to meet today's realities.

105
0:05:52.151,000 --> 0:05:53,000
The government is handing out

106
0:05:53.779,000 --> 0:05:56,000
one of the most prized rewards in business --

107
0:05:57.117,000 --> 0:06:02,000
the opportunity to create a product that is protected from competition --

108
0:06:02.49,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and asking for less and less in return on our behalf.

109
0:06:06.72,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Imagine awarding 100 Pulitzer Prizes to one author for the same book.

110
0:06:12.744,000 --> 0:06:13,000
(Murmurs)

111
0:06:14.735,000 --> 0:06:15,000
It doesn't have to be this way.

112
0:06:16.719,000 --> 0:06:19,000
We can create a modern patent system

113
0:06:19.8,000 --> 0:06:22,000
to meet the needs of a 21st-century society.

114
0:06:23.243,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And to do that,

115
0:06:24.466,000 --> 0:06:27,000
we need to reimagine the patent system to serve the public,

116
0:06:27.847,000 --> 0:06:29,000
not just corporations.

117
0:06:30.736,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So how do we do it?

118
0:06:32.752,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Five reforms.

119
0:06:34.633,000 --> 0:06:37,000
First, we need to stop handing out so many patents.

120
0:06:39.077,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Back under the Kennedy administration,

121
0:06:41.205,000 --> 0:06:44,000
in an effort to curb rising drug costs,

122
0:06:44.777,000 --> 0:06:46,000
a congressman from Tennessee proposed an idea.

123
0:06:48.211,000 --> 0:06:49,000
He said,

124
0:06:49.552,000 --> 0:06:5,000
"If you want to tweak a drug,

125
0:06:51.18,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and you want to get another patent on it,

126
0:06:53.6,000 --> 0:06:57,000
the modified version has to be significantly better, therapeutically,

127
0:06:57.792,000 --> 0:06:58,000
for patients."

128
0:06:59.419,000 --> 0:07:,000
Because of intense lobbying,

129
0:07:01.061,000 --> 0:07:03,000
this idea never saw the light of day.

130
0:07:04.464,000 --> 0:07:06,000
But a reimagined patent system

131
0:07:07.099,000 --> 0:07:12,000
would resurrect and evolve this simple, yet elegant proposition.

132
0:07:12.147,000 --> 0:07:13,000
That to get a patent,

133
0:07:13.567,000 --> 0:07:16,000
you have to invent something substantially better

134
0:07:16.837,000 --> 0:07:18,000
than what's already out there.

135
0:07:18.916,000 --> 0:07:2,000
This shouldn't be controversial.

136
0:07:21.265,000 --> 0:07:22,000
As a society,

137
0:07:22.686,000 --> 0:07:26,000
we reserve the big rewards for the big ideas.

138
0:07:26.942,000 --> 0:07:3,000
We don't give Michelin stars to chefs who just tweak a recipe --

139
0:07:31.133,000 --> 0:07:35,000
we give them to chefs who change how we think about food.

140
0:07:35.579,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And yet, we hand out patents worth billions of dollars

141
0:07:38.626,000 --> 0:07:39,000
for minor changes.

142
0:07:40.523,000 --> 0:07:41,000
It's time to raise the bar.

143
0:07:43.499,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Second,

144
0:07:45.101,000 --> 0:07:49,000
we need to change the financial incentives of the Patent Office.

145
0:07:49.538,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Right now, the revenue of the Patent Office

146
0:07:52.117,000 --> 0:07:55,000
is directly linked to the number of patents that it grants.

147
0:07:57.292,000 --> 0:08:02,000
That's like private prisons getting paid more to hold more people --

148
0:08:02.903,000 --> 0:08:05,000
it naturally leads to more incarceration,

149
0:08:06.704,000 --> 0:08:07,000
not less.

150
0:08:08.125,000 --> 0:08:1,000
The same is true for patents.

151
0:08:12.173,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Third, we need more public participation.

152
0:08:16.093,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Right now, the patent system is like a black box.

153
0:08:19.204,000 --> 0:08:24,000
It's a two-way conversation between the patent office and industry.

154
0:08:24.653,000 --> 0:08:27,000
You and I aren't invited to that party.

155
0:08:28.454,000 --> 0:08:3,000
But imagine if instead,

156
0:08:30.565,000 --> 0:08:35,000
the Patent Office became a dynamic center for citizen learning and ingenuity,

157
0:08:36.221,000 --> 0:08:4,000
staffed not just by technical experts and bureaucrats,

158
0:08:40.293,000 --> 0:08:43,000
but also by great public-health storytellers

159
0:08:43.73,000 --> 0:08:45,000
with a passion for science.

160
0:08:46.133,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Regular citizens could get accessible information

161
0:08:50.08,000 --> 0:08:52,000
about complex technologies

162
0:08:52.111,000 --> 0:08:55,000
like artificial intelligence or gene editing,

163
0:08:55.964,000 --> 0:08:59,000
enabling us to participate in the policy conversations

164
0:09:00.527,000 --> 0:09:03,000
that directly impact our health and lives.

165
0:09:05.948,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Fourth,

166
0:09:08.095,000 --> 0:09:1,000
we need to get the right to go to court.

167
0:09:11.245,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Right now in America, after a patent is granted,

168
0:09:14.912,000 --> 0:09:16,000
the public has no legal standing.

169
0:09:17.895,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Only those with a commercial interest, usually other drug companies,

170
0:09:22.831,000 --> 0:09:23,000
have that right.

171
0:09:24.68,000 --> 0:09:27,000
But I've witnessed firsthand how lives can be saved

172
0:09:28.411,000 --> 0:09:31,000
when everyday citizens have the right to go to court.

173
0:09:32.72,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Back in 2006 in India,

174
0:09:34.953,000 --> 0:09:37,000
my organization worked with patient advocates

175
0:09:38.096,000 --> 0:09:42,000
to challenge, legally, unjust HIV drug patents,

176
0:09:42.517,000 --> 0:09:44,000
at a time when so many people were dying,

177
0:09:45.474,000 --> 0:09:47,000
because medicines were priced out of reach.

178
0:09:48.268,000 --> 0:09:5,000
We were able to bring down the prices of medicines

179
0:09:50.83,000 --> 0:09:52,000
by up to 87 percent.

180
0:09:53.006,000 --> 0:09:57,000
(Applause)

181
0:09:57.847,000 --> 0:09:58,000
On just three drugs,

182
0:09:59.759,000 --> 0:10:02,000
we were able to save health systems half a billion dollars.

183
0:10:04.212,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Now, cases like these can save millions of lives

184
0:10:09.3,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and billions of dollars.

185
0:10:11.434,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Imagine if Americans had the right to go to court, too.

186
0:10:17.259,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And lastly, we need stronger oversight.

187
0:10:21.969,000 --> 0:10:26,000
We need an independent unit that can serve as a public advocate,

188
0:10:27.501,000 --> 0:10:3,000
regularly monitoring the activities of the Patent Office

189
0:10:30.993,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and reporting to Congress.

190
0:10:33.592,000 --> 0:10:34,000
If a unit like this had existed,

191
0:10:35.609,000 --> 0:10:39,000
it would have caught, for example, the Silicon Valley company Theranos

192
0:10:40.267,000 --> 0:10:43,000
before it got so many patents for blood testing

193
0:10:44.046,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and landed an evaluation of nine billion dollars,

194
0:10:47.593,000 --> 0:10:48,000
when in reality,

195
0:10:48.871,000 --> 0:10:5,000
there was no invention there at all.

196
0:10:51.673,000 --> 0:10:55,000
This kind of accountability is going to become increasingly urgent.

197
0:10:56.609,000 --> 0:10:58,000
In the age of 23andMe,

198
0:10:58.894,000 --> 0:11:,000
important questions are being asked

199
0:11:01.032,000 --> 0:11:04,000
about whether companies can patent and sell

200
0:11:04.315,000 --> 0:11:07,000
our genetic information and our patient data.

201
0:11:08.004,000 --> 0:11:1,000
We need to be part of those conversations

202
0:11:10.702,000 --> 0:11:11,000
before it's too late.

203
0:11:12.821,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Our information is being used to create the new therapies.

204
0:11:17.133,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And when that moment of diagnosis comes for me and my family,

205
0:11:21.696,000 --> 0:11:22,000
or for you and yours,

206
0:11:23.617,000 --> 0:11:27,000
are we going to have to crowdfund to save the lives of those we love?

207
0:11:28.66,000 --> 0:11:3,000
That's not the world I want to live in.

208
0:11:31.184,000 --> 0:11:34,000
It's not the world I want for my two-year-old son.

209
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
My dad is growing older now,

210
0:11:40.188,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and he is still as quietly brilliant and morally directed as ever.

211
0:11:45.478,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Sometimes people ask us whether things get heated between us:

212
0:11:49.414,000 --> 0:11:5,000
the patent-holding scientist

213
0:11:51.303,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and his patent-reforming lawyer daughter.

214
0:11:55.377,000 --> 0:11:59,000
It's such a profound misunderstanding of what's at stake,

215
0:12:00.002,000 --> 0:12:03,000
because this is not about scientists versus activists,

216
0:12:04.005,000 --> 0:12:06,000
or invention versus protection.

217
0:12:06.74,000 --> 0:12:08,000
This is about people,

218
0:12:08.812,000 --> 0:12:11,000
our quest to invent and our right to live.

219
0:12:12.629,000 --> 0:12:16,000
My dad and I understand that our ingenuity and our dignity

220
0:12:16.79,000 --> 0:12:18,000
go hand in hand.

221
0:12:19.281,000 --> 0:12:21,000
We are on the same side.

222
0:12:21.868,000 --> 0:12:24,000
It is time to reimagine a patent system

223
0:12:25.122,000 --> 0:12:27,000
that reflects that knowing.

224
0:12:27.71,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Thank you.

225
0:12:28.884,000 --> 0:12:32,000
(Applause)

0:00:16.124,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Having spent 18 years as a child of the state

3
0:00:20.369,000 --> 0:00:22,000
in children's homes and foster care,

4
0:00:22.675,000 --> 0:00:25,000
you could say that I'm an expert on the subject,

5
0:00:25.723,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and in being an expert, I want to let you know that

6
0:00:29.281,000 --> 0:00:34,000
being an expert does in no way make you right

7
0:00:34.888,000 --> 0:00:37,000
in light of the truth.

8
0:00:37.888,000 --> 0:00:41,000
If you're in care, legally the government is your

9
0:00:42.076,000 --> 0:00:45,000
parent, loco parentis.

10
0:00:45.803,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Margaret Thatcher was my mother. (Laughter)

11
0:00:49.752,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Let's not talk about breastfeeding. (Laughter)

12
0:00:53.401,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Harry Potter was a foster child.

13
0:00:56.539,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Pip from "Great Expectations" was adopted;

14
0:01:01.579,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Superman was a foster child;

15
0:01:04.661,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Cinderella was a foster child;

16
0:01:08.189,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo,

17
0:01:11.797,000 --> 0:01:13,000
was fostered and institutionalized;

18
0:01:14.719,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Batman was orphaned;

19
0:01:19.094,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Lyra Belacqua from Philip Pullman's "Northern Lights"

20
0:01:22.792,000 --> 0:01:23,000
was fostered;

21
0:01:24.481,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Jane Eyre, adopted;

22
0:01:27.216,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Roald Dahl's James from "James and the Giant Peach;"

23
0:01:31.799,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Matilda; Moses -- Moses! (Laughter)

24
0:01:37.311,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Moses! (Laughter) --

25
0:01:39.758,000 --> 0:01:43,000
the boys in Michael Morpurgo's "Friend or Foe;"

26
0:01:44.254,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Alem in Benjamin Zephaniah's "Refugee Boy;"

27
0:01:48.07,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Luke Skywalker --

28
0:01:50.654,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Luke Skywalker! (Laughter) --

29
0:01:53.525,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Oliver Twist;

30
0:01:55.812,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Cassia in "The Concubine of Shanghai" by Hong Ying;

31
0:02:00.023,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Celie in Alice Walker's "The Color Purple."

32
0:02:03.38,000 --> 0:02:07,000
All of these great fictional characters, all of them

33
0:02:07.992,000 --> 0:02:1,000
who were hurt by their condition,

34
0:02:11.989,000 --> 0:02:15,000
all of them who spawned thousands of other books

35
0:02:16.637,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and other films, all of them

36
0:02:19.092,000 --> 0:02:23,000
were fostered, adopted or orphaned.

37
0:02:23.245,000 --> 0:02:28,000
It seems that writers know that the child

38
0:02:28.809,000 --> 0:02:35,000
outside of family reflects on what family truly is

39
0:02:35.958,000 --> 0:02:38,000
more than what it promotes itself to be.

40
0:02:39.548,000 --> 0:02:43,000
That is, they also use extraordinary skills

41
0:02:44.515,000 --> 0:02:48,000
to deal with extraordinary situations on a daily basis.

42
0:02:49.344,000 --> 0:02:52,000
How have we not made the connection?

43
0:02:52.866,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And why have we not made the connection, between

44
0:02:56.904,000 --> 0:02:58,000
— How has that happened? —

45
0:02:59.104,000 --> 0:03:02,000
between these incredible characters of popular culture

46
0:03:02.672,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and religions, and the fostered, adopted or orphaned child

47
0:03:07.76,000 --> 0:03:11,000
in our midst? It's not our pity that they need.

48
0:03:12.392,000 --> 0:03:14,000
It's our respect.

49
0:03:14.993,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I know famous musicians,

50
0:03:17.61,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I know actors and film stars and millionaires and novelists

51
0:03:22.682,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and top lawyers and television executives

52
0:03:26.183,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and magazine editors and national journalists

53
0:03:28.633,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and dustbinmen and hairdressers, all who were

54
0:03:31.474,000 --> 0:03:34,000
looked after children, fostered, adopted or orphaned,

55
0:03:35.01,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and many of them grow into their adult lives

56
0:03:37.682,000 --> 0:03:41,000
in fear of speaking of their background, as if it may

57
0:03:41.953,000 --> 0:03:45,000
somehow weaken their standing in the foreground,

58
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
as if it were somehow Kryptonite, as if it were a time bomb

59
0:03:50.302,000 --> 0:03:54,000
strapped on the inside. Children in care,

60
0:03:54.349,000 --> 0:03:57,000
who've had a life in care, deserve the right

61
0:03:57.483,000 --> 0:04:02,000
to own and live the memory of their own childhood.

62
0:04:03.333,000 --> 0:04:05,000
It is that simple.

63
0:04:05.612,000 --> 0:04:09,000
My own mother — and I should say this here —

64
0:04:09.618,000 --> 0:04:12,000
she same to this country in the late '60s,

65
0:04:13.472,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and she was, you know, she found herself pregnant,

66
0:04:17.237,000 --> 0:04:19,000
as women did in the late '60s. You know what I mean?

67
0:04:19.332,000 --> 0:04:2,000
They found themselves pregnant.

68
0:04:21.281,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And she sort of, she had no idea of the context

69
0:04:25.955,000 --> 0:04:29,000
in which she'd landed.

70
0:04:30.075,000 --> 0:04:33,000
In the 1960s -- I should give you some context -- in the 1960s,

71
0:04:33.923,000 --> 0:04:36,000
if you were pregnant and you were single,

72
0:04:37.274,000 --> 0:04:39,000
you were seen as a threat to the community.

73
0:04:40.175,000 --> 0:04:45,000
You were separated from your family by the state.

74
0:04:46.034,000 --> 0:04:48,000
You were separated from your family and placed into

75
0:04:48.736,000 --> 0:04:5,000
mother and baby homes.

76
0:04:50.858,000 --> 0:04:53,000
You were appointed a social worker.

77
0:04:53.999,000 --> 0:04:55,000
The adoptive parents were lined up.

78
0:04:56.389,000 --> 0:05:,000
It was the primary purpose of the social worker, the aim,

79
0:05:00.474,000 --> 0:05:03,000
to get the woman at her most vulnerable time

80
0:05:03.815,000 --> 0:05:08,000
in her entire life, to sign the adoption papers.

81
0:05:09.168,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So the adoption papers were signed.

82
0:05:11.053,000 --> 0:05:14,000
The mother and baby's homes were often run by nuns.

83
0:05:14.623,000 --> 0:05:17,000
The adoption papers were signed,

84
0:05:17.799,000 --> 0:05:2,000
the child was given to the adoptive parents, and the mother

85
0:05:21.495,000 --> 0:05:23,000
shipped back to her community

86
0:05:23.919,000 --> 0:05:25,000
to say that she'd been on a little break.

87
0:05:26.91,000 --> 0:05:28,000
A little break.

88
0:05:29.596,000 --> 0:05:3,000
A little break.

89
0:05:31.274,000 --> 0:05:34,000
The first secret of shame for a woman

90
0:05:34.839,000 --> 0:05:39,000
for being a woman, "a little break."

91
0:05:39.918,000 --> 0:05:42,000
The adoption process took, like, a matter of months,

92
0:05:43.009,000 --> 0:05:46,000
so it was a closed shop, you know, sealed deal,

93
0:05:46.889,000 --> 0:05:52,000
an industrious, utilitarian solution:

94
0:05:53.394,000 --> 0:05:56,000
the government, the farmer,

95
0:05:56.752,000 --> 0:05:59,000
the adopting parents, the consumer,

96
0:06:00.599,000 --> 0:06:04,000
the mother, the earth, and the child, the crop.

97
0:06:05.401,000 --> 0:06:09,000
It's kind of easy to patronize the past,

98
0:06:10.055,000 --> 0:06:14,000
to forego our responsibilities in the present.

99
0:06:14.959,000 --> 0:06:17,000
What happened then is a direct reflection

100
0:06:18.811,000 --> 0:06:23,000
of what is happening now. Everybody believed themselves

101
0:06:24.055,000 --> 0:06:28,000
to be doing the right thing by God and by the state

102
0:06:28.592,000 --> 0:06:34,000
for the big society, fast-tracking adoption.

103
0:06:35.479,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So anyway, she comes here, 1967, she's pregnant,

104
0:06:40.672,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and she comes from Ethiopia that was celebrating

105
0:06:45.75,000 --> 0:06:47,000
its own jubilee at the time

106
0:06:48.448,000 --> 0:06:5,000
under the Emperor Haile Selassie,

107
0:06:51.218,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and she lands months before the Enoch Powell speech,

108
0:06:56.344,000 --> 0:06:58,000
the "Rivers of Blood" speech.

109
0:06:58.464,000 --> 0:07:02,000
She lands months before the Beatles release "The White Album,"

110
0:07:03.086,000 --> 0:07:05,000
months before Martin Luther King was killed.

111
0:07:05.77,000 --> 0:07:07,000
It was a summer of love if you were white.

112
0:07:08.221,000 --> 0:07:11,000
If you were black, it was a summer of hate.

113
0:07:11.913,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So she goes from Oxford, she's sent to the north of England

114
0:07:17.563,000 --> 0:07:21,000
to a mother and baby home, and appointed a social worker.

115
0:07:21.923,000 --> 0:07:25,000
It's her plan. You know, I have to say this in the Houses --

116
0:07:26.163,000 --> 0:07:3,000
It's her plan to have me fostered for a short period of time

117
0:07:30.434,000 --> 0:07:33,000
while she studies. But the social worker,

118
0:07:34.009,000 --> 0:07:36,000
he had a different agenda.

119
0:07:37.003,000 --> 0:07:41,000
He found the foster parents, and he said to them,

120
0:07:41.21,000 --> 0:07:44,000
"Treat this as an adoption. He's yours forever.

121
0:07:45.042,000 --> 0:07:48,000
His name is Norman." (Laughter)

122
0:07:48.489,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Norman! (Laughter)

123
0:07:50.826,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Norman!

124
0:07:53.538,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So they took me. I was a message, they said.

125
0:07:59.764,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I was a sign from God, they said.

126
0:08:02.223,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I was Norman Mark Greenwood.

127
0:08:05.967,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Now, for the next 11 years, all I know is that this woman,

128
0:08:09.386,000 --> 0:08:11,000
this birth woman, should have her eyes scratched out

129
0:08:11.974,000 --> 0:08:14,000
for not signing the adoption papers. She was an evil woman

130
0:08:14.976,000 --> 0:08:17,000
too selfish to sign, so I spent those 11 years

131
0:08:18.053,000 --> 0:08:2,000
kneeling and praying.

132
0:08:20.809,000 --> 0:08:23,000
I tried praying. I swear I tried praying.

133
0:08:23.93,000 --> 0:08:26,000
"God, can I have a bike for Christmas?"

134
0:08:27.738,000 --> 0:08:31,000
But I would always answer myself, "Yes, of course you can."

135
0:08:32.086,000 --> 0:08:33,000
(Laughter)

136
0:08:33.7,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And then I was supposed to determine whether that

137
0:08:36.437,000 --> 0:08:39,000
was the voice of God or it was the voice of the Devil.

138
0:08:39.969,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And it turns out I've got the Devil inside of me.

139
0:08:47.328,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Who knew? (Laughter)

140
0:08:49.736,000 --> 0:08:51,000
So anyway, two years sort of passed,

141
0:08:52.632,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and they had a child of their own,

142
0:08:54.41,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and then another two years passed, and they had another child of their own,

143
0:08:56.874,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and then another time passed

144
0:08:59.165,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and they had another child that they called an accident,

145
0:09:01.742,000 --> 0:09:04,000
which I thought was an unusual name. (Laughter)

146
0:09:05.15,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And I was on the cusp of, sort of, adolescence,

147
0:09:08.879,000 --> 0:09:12,000
so I was starting to take biscuits from the tin without asking.

148
0:09:13.284,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I was starting to stay out a little bit late, etc., etc.

149
0:09:17.061,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Now, in their religiosity, in their naivete,

150
0:09:20.464,000 --> 0:09:22,000
my mom and dad, which I believed them to be forever,

151
0:09:22.901,000 --> 0:09:25,000
as they said they were, my mom and dad

152
0:09:26.169,000 --> 0:09:32,000
conceived that I had the Devil inside of me.

153
0:09:32.978,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And what -- I should say this here, because this is how

154
0:09:35.036,000 --> 0:09:36,000
they engineered my leaving.

155
0:09:36.995,000 --> 0:09:39,000
They sat me at a table, my foster mom, and she said to me,

156
0:09:40.384,000 --> 0:09:42,000
"You don't love us, do you?" At 11 years old.

157
0:09:42.452,000 --> 0:09:45,000
They've had three other children. I'm the fourth. The third was an accident.

158
0:09:45.961,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And I said, "Yeah, of course I do." Because you do.

159
0:09:50.006,000 --> 0:09:52,000
My foster mother asked me to go away to think about love

160
0:09:52.157,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and what it is and to read the Scriptures and to come back tomorrow

161
0:09:55.001,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and give my most honest and truthful answer.

162
0:09:57.944,000 --> 0:09:59,000
So this was an opportunity. If they were asking me

163
0:10:00.784,000 --> 0:10:02,000
whether I loved them or not, then I mustn't love them,

164
0:10:03.12,000 --> 0:10:05,000
which led me to the miracle of thought that I thought they wanted me to get to.

165
0:10:05.985,000 --> 0:10:07,000
"I will ask God for forgiveness and His light will shine

166
0:10:08.656,000 --> 0:10:11,000
through me to them. How fantastic." This was an opportunity.

167
0:10:12.424,000 --> 0:10:14,000
The theology was perfect, the timing unquestionable,

168
0:10:15.209,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and the answer as honest as a sinner could get.

169
0:10:18.112,000 --> 0:10:22,000
"I mustn't love you," I said to them. "But I will ask God for forgiveness."

170
0:10:22.8,000 --> 0:10:24,000
"Because you don't love us, Norman,

171
0:10:25.352,000 --> 0:10:27,000
clearly you've chosen your path."

172
0:10:27.696,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Twenty-four hours later, my social worker,

173
0:10:30.494,000 --> 0:10:33,000
this strange man who used to visit me every couple of months,

174
0:10:33.543,000 --> 0:10:36,000
he's waiting for me in the car as I say goodbye to my parents.

175
0:10:36.755,000 --> 0:10:38,000
I didn't say goodbye to anybody, not my mother, my father,

176
0:10:39.331,000 --> 0:10:4,000
my sisters, my brothers, my aunts, my uncles,

177
0:10:41.159,000 --> 0:10:44,000
my cousins, my grandparents, nobody.

178
0:10:44.788,000 --> 0:10:47,000
On the way to the children's home, I started to ask myself,

179
0:10:48.335,000 --> 0:10:5,000
"What's happened to me?"

180
0:10:51.31,000 --> 0:10:54,000
It's not that I'd had the rug pulled from beneath me

181
0:10:54.463,000 --> 0:10:58,000
as much as the entire floor had been taken away.

182
0:10:59.278,000 --> 0:11:02,000
When I got to the —

183
0:11:03.078,000 --> 0:11:07,000
For the next four, five years,

184
0:11:07.461,000 --> 0:11:11,000
I was held in four different children's homes.

185
0:11:12.314,000 --> 0:11:15,000
On the third children's home, at 15,

186
0:11:15.591,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I started to rebel, and what I did was,

187
0:11:18.758,000 --> 0:11:22,000
I got three tins of paint, Airfix paint that you use for models,

188
0:11:23.087,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and I was -- it was a big children's home, big Victorian children's home --

189
0:11:26.918,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and I was in a little turret at the top of it,

190
0:11:28.758,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and I poured them, red, yellow and green,

191
0:11:32.061,000 --> 0:11:37,000
the colors of Africa, down the tiles.

192
0:11:37.102,000 --> 0:11:39,000
You couldn't see it from the street, because the home

193
0:11:39.606,000 --> 0:11:41,000
was surrounded by beech trees.

194
0:11:42.058,000 --> 0:11:46,000
For doing this, I was incarcerated for a year

195
0:11:47.014,000 --> 0:11:49,000
in an assessment center which was actually

196
0:11:49.999,000 --> 0:11:53,000
a remand center. It was a virtual prison

197
0:11:54.719,000 --> 0:11:57,000
for young people.

198
0:11:58.617,000 --> 0:12:,000
By the way, years later, my social worker said

199
0:12:00.67,000 --> 0:12:01,000
that I should never have been put in there.

200
0:12:02.129,000 --> 0:12:04,000
I wasn't charged for anything. I hadn't done anything wrong.

201
0:12:04.784,000 --> 0:12:08,000
But because I had no family to inquire about me,

202
0:12:09.51,000 --> 0:12:13,000
they could do anything to me.

203
0:12:14.261,000 --> 0:12:17,000
I'm 17 years old, and

204
0:12:17.615,000 --> 0:12:2,000
they had a padded cell.

205
0:12:21.256,000 --> 0:12:26,000
They would march me down corridors in last-size order.

206
0:12:27.216,000 --> 0:12:29,000
They -- I was put in a dormitory

207
0:12:29.481,000 --> 0:12:32,000
with a confirmed Nazi sympathizer.

208
0:12:33.401,000 --> 0:12:36,000
All of the staff were ex-police -- interesting --

209
0:12:36.723,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and ex-probation officers.

210
0:12:38.737,000 --> 0:12:42,000
The man who ran it was an ex-army officer.

211
0:12:42.8,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Every time I had a visit by a person who I did not know

212
0:12:45.96,000 --> 0:12:48,000
who would feed me grapes, once every three months,

213
0:12:49.694,000 --> 0:12:51,000
I was strip-searched.

214
0:12:51.905,000 --> 0:12:54,000
That home was full of young boys who were on remand

215
0:12:55.158,000 --> 0:13:,000
for things like murder.

216
0:13:00.426,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And this was the preparation that I was being given

217
0:13:04.458,000 --> 0:13:1,000
after 17 years as a child of the state.

218
0:13:10.509,000 --> 0:13:12,000
I have to tell this story.

219
0:13:13.092,000 --> 0:13:15,000
I have to tell it, because there was no one

220
0:13:15.362,000 --> 0:13:17,000
to put two and two together.

221
0:13:18.315,000 --> 0:13:21,000
I slowly became aware that I knew nobody

222
0:13:21.342,000 --> 0:13:24,000
that knew me for longer than a year.

223
0:13:24.836,000 --> 0:13:26,000
See, that's what family does.

224
0:13:27.685,000 --> 0:13:29,000
It gives you reference points.

225
0:13:30.076,000 --> 0:13:32,000
I'm not defining a good family from a bad family.

226
0:13:32.564,000 --> 0:13:33,000
I'm just saying that you know when your birthday is

227
0:13:34.38,000 --> 0:13:36,000
by virtue of the fact that somebody tells you when your birthday is,

228
0:13:37.036,000 --> 0:13:38,000
a mother, a father, a sister, a brother, an aunt, an uncle,

229
0:13:38.983,000 --> 0:13:4,000
a cousin, a grandparent. It matters to someone,

230
0:13:40.993,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and therefore it matters to you. Understand,

231
0:13:43.28,000 --> 0:13:47,000
I was 14 years old, tucked away in myself, into myself,

232
0:13:47.509,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and I wasn't touched either, physically touched.

233
0:13:52.291,000 --> 0:14:,000
I'm reporting back. I'm reporting back simply to say that

234
0:14:00.418,000 --> 0:14:03,000
when I left the children's home I had two things

235
0:14:03.633,000 --> 0:14:06,000
that I wanted to do. One was to find my family,

236
0:14:07.43,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and the other was to write poetry.

237
0:14:08.96,000 --> 0:14:1,000
In creativity I saw light.

238
0:14:11.509,000 --> 0:14:16,000
In the imagination I saw the endless possibility of life,

239
0:14:16.671,000 --> 0:14:21,000
the endless truth, the permanent creation of reality,

240
0:14:22.572,000 --> 0:14:28,000
the place where anger was an expression

241
0:14:29.035,000 --> 0:14:32,000
in the search for love, a place where dysfunction

242
0:14:32.783,000 --> 0:14:36,000
is a true reaction to untruth.

243
0:14:37.501,000 --> 0:14:4,000
I've just got to say it to you all: I found all of my family

244
0:14:41.048,000 --> 0:14:44,000
in my adult life. I spent all of my adult life finding them,

245
0:14:44.411,000 --> 0:14:48,000
and I've now got a fully dysfunctional family just like everybody else.

246
0:14:48.426,000 --> 0:14:51,000
But I'm reporting back to you to say quite simply

247
0:14:52.166,000 --> 0:14:57,000
that you can define how strong a democracy is

248
0:14:57.678,000 --> 0:15:02,000
by how its government treats its child.

249
0:15:02.911,000 --> 0:15:04,000
I don't mean children. I mean the child of the state.

250
0:15:04.967,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Thanks very much. It's been an honor. (Applause)

251
0:15:09.934,000 --> 0:15:11,000
(Applause)

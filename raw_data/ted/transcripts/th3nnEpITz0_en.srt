0:00:13.24,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Here's a startling fact:

3
0:00:15.095,000 --> 0:00:18,000
in the 45 years since the introduction of the automated teller machine,

4
0:00:18.84,000 --> 0:00:2,000
those vending machines that dispense cash,

5
0:00:21.72,000 --> 0:00:24,000
the number of human bank tellers employed in the United States

6
0:00:24.92,000 --> 0:00:25,000
has roughly doubled,

7
0:00:26.2,000 --> 0:00:29,000
from about a quarter of a million to a half a million.

8
0:00:29.52,000 --> 0:00:32,000
A quarter of a million in 1970 to about a half a million today,

9
0:00:32.58,000 --> 0:00:36,000
with 100,000 added since the year 2000.

10
0:00:36.84,000 --> 0:00:38,000
These facts, revealed in a recent book

11
0:00:39.28,000 --> 0:00:42,000
by Boston University economist James Bessen,

12
0:00:42.44,000 --> 0:00:44,000
raise an intriguing question:

13
0:00:44.64,000 --> 0:00:45,000
what are all those tellers doing,

14
0:00:46.56,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and why hasn't automation eliminated their employment by now?

15
0:00:50.6,000 --> 0:00:51,000
If you think about it,

16
0:00:51.96,000 --> 0:00:54,000
many of the great inventions of the last 200 years

17
0:00:55.12,000 --> 0:00:57,000
were designed to replace human labor.

18
0:00:58.72,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Tractors were developed

19
0:01:00.52,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to substitute mechanical power for human physical toil.

20
0:01:04.88,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Assembly lines were engineered

21
0:01:07.24,000 --> 0:01:1,000
to replace inconsistent human handiwork

22
0:01:10.6,000 --> 0:01:11,000
with machine perfection.

23
0:01:12.56,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Computers were programmed to swap out

24
0:01:15.8,000 --> 0:01:17,000
error-prone, inconsistent human calculation

25
0:01:18.48,000 --> 0:01:19,000
with digital perfection.

26
0:01:20.76,000 --> 0:01:22,000
These inventions have worked.

27
0:01:22.96,000 --> 0:01:24,000
We no longer dig ditches by hand,

28
0:01:25.04,000 --> 0:01:27,000
pound tools out of wrought iron

29
0:01:27.12,000 --> 0:01:29,000
or do bookkeeping using actual books.

30
0:01:30.24,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And yet, the fraction of US adults employed in the labor market

31
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:37,000
is higher now in 2016

32
0:01:37.88,000 --> 0:01:39,000
than it was 125 years ago, in 1890,

33
0:01:40.64,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and it's risen in just about every decade

34
0:01:43.68,000 --> 0:01:45,000
in the intervening 125 years.

35
0:01:46.56,000 --> 0:01:47,000
This poses a paradox.

36
0:01:48.76,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Our machines increasingly do our work for us.

37
0:01:51.84,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Why doesn't this make our labor redundant and our skills obsolete?

38
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Why are there still so many jobs?

39
0:01:59.72,000 --> 0:02:,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:01.48,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I'm going to try to answer that question tonight,

41
0:02:03.84,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and along the way, I'm going to tell you what this means for the future of work

42
0:02:07.6,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and the challenges that automation does and does not pose

43
0:02:11.8,000 --> 0:02:12,000
for our society.

44
0:02:14.52,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Why are there so many jobs?

45
0:02:17.68,000 --> 0:02:2,000
There are actually two fundamental economic principles at stake.

46
0:02:21.08,000 --> 0:02:23,000
One has to do with human genius

47
0:02:23.8,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and creativity.

48
0:02:25.24,000 --> 0:02:27,000
The other has to do with human insatiability,

49
0:02:28.12,000 --> 0:02:29,000
or greed, if you like.

50
0:02:29.72,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I'm going to call the first of these the O-ring principle,

51
0:02:32.48,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and it determines the type of work that we do.

52
0:02:34.68,000 --> 0:02:36,000
The second principle is the never-get-enough principle,

53
0:02:37.32,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and it determines how many jobs there actually are.

54
0:02:41.44,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Let's start with the O-ring.

55
0:02:43.8,000 --> 0:02:45,000
ATMs, automated teller machines,

56
0:02:46.6,000 --> 0:02:49,000
had two countervailing effects on bank teller employment.

57
0:02:49.96,000 --> 0:02:51,000
As you would expect, they replaced a lot of teller tasks.

58
0:02:52.68,000 --> 0:02:54,000
The number of tellers per branch fell by about a third.

59
0:02:56.24,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But banks quickly discovered that it also was cheaper to open new branches,

60
0:03:00.08,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and the number of bank branches increased by about 40 percent

61
0:03:03.24,000 --> 0:03:04,000
in the same time period.

62
0:03:04.76,000 --> 0:03:08,000
The net result was more branches and more tellers.

63
0:03:09.44,000 --> 0:03:12,000
But those tellers were doing somewhat different work.

64
0:03:12.88,000 --> 0:03:15,000
As their routine, cash-handling tasks receded,

65
0:03:16.56,000 --> 0:03:18,000
they became less like checkout clerks

66
0:03:18.72,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and more like salespeople,

67
0:03:20.56,000 --> 0:03:22,000
forging relationships with customers,

68
0:03:22.64,000 --> 0:03:23,000
solving problems

69
0:03:23.88,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and introducing them to new products like credit cards, loans and investments:

70
0:03:28.12,000 --> 0:03:31,000
more tellers doing a more cognitively demanding job.

71
0:03:32.84,000 --> 0:03:33,000
There's a general principle here.

72
0:03:35.12,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Most of the work that we do

73
0:03:36.84,000 --> 0:03:39,000
requires a multiplicity of skills,

74
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and brains and brawn,

75
0:03:44.36,000 --> 0:03:47,000
technical expertise and intuitive mastery,

76
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:5,000
perspiration and inspiration in the words of Thomas Edison.

77
0:03:51.48,000 --> 0:03:54,000
In general, automating some subset of those tasks

78
0:03:54.76,000 --> 0:03:56,000
doesn't make the other ones unnecessary.

79
0:03:57,000 --> 0:03:59,000
In fact, it makes them more important.

80
0:04:01.08,000 --> 0:04:02,000
It increases their economic value.

81
0:04:03.08,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Let me give you a stark example.

82
0:04:05.12,000 --> 0:04:08,000
In 1986, the space shuttle Challenger

83
0:04:08.96,000 --> 0:04:1,000
exploded and crashed back down to Earth

84
0:04:11.28,000 --> 0:04:12,000
less than two minutes after takeoff.

85
0:04:13.72,000 --> 0:04:16,000
The cause of that crash, it turned out,

86
0:04:16.84,000 --> 0:04:19,000
was an inexpensive rubber O-ring in the booster rocket

87
0:04:20.4,000 --> 0:04:22,000
that had frozen on the launchpad the night before

88
0:04:23.28,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and failed catastrophically moments after takeoff.

89
0:04:26.68,000 --> 0:04:28,000
In this multibillion dollar enterprise

90
0:04:29.519,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that simple rubber O-ring

91
0:04:31.24,000 --> 0:04:33,000
made the difference between mission success

92
0:04:33.839,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and the calamitous death of seven astronauts.

93
0:04:37.6,000 --> 0:04:4,000
An ingenious metaphor for this tragic setting

94
0:04:41.36,000 --> 0:04:43,000
is the O-ring production function,

95
0:04:43.6,000 --> 0:04:45,000
named by Harvard economist Michael Kremer

96
0:04:46.12,000 --> 0:04:48,000
after the Challenger disaster.

97
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
The O-ring production function conceives of the work

98
0:04:50.76,000 --> 0:04:52,000
as a series of interlocking steps,

99
0:04:53.12,000 --> 0:04:54,000
links in a chain.

100
0:04:54.4,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Every one of those links must hold for the mission to succeed.

101
0:04:58.12,000 --> 0:05:,000
If any of them fails,

102
0:05:00.28,000 --> 0:05:03,000
the mission, or the product or the service,

103
0:05:03.6,000 --> 0:05:04,000
comes crashing down.

104
0:05:05.56,000 --> 0:05:09,000
This precarious situation has a surprisingly positive implication,

105
0:05:10.52,000 --> 0:05:11,000
which is that improvements

106
0:05:12.44,000 --> 0:05:14,000
in the reliability of any one link in the chain

107
0:05:15.44,000 --> 0:05:18,000
increases the value of improving any of the other links.

108
0:05:19.24,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Concretely, if most of the links are brittle and prone to breakage,

109
0:05:24.24,000 --> 0:05:26,000
the fact that your link is not that reliable

110
0:05:26.72,000 --> 0:05:27,000
is not that important.

111
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Probably something else will break anyway.

112
0:05:30.024,000 --> 0:05:33,000
But as all the other links become robust and reliable,

113
0:05:34.04,000 --> 0:05:37,000
the importance of your link becomes more essential.

114
0:05:37.56,000 --> 0:05:39,000
In the limit, everything depends upon it.

115
0:05:40.64,000 --> 0:05:43,000
The reason the O-ring was critical to space shuttle Challenger

116
0:05:44.2,000 --> 0:05:46,000
is because everything else worked perfectly.

117
0:05:47.48,000 --> 0:05:49,000
If the Challenger were kind of the space era equivalent

118
0:05:50.08,000 --> 0:05:52,000
of Microsoft Windows 2000 --

119
0:05:52.64,000 --> 0:05:54,000
(Laughter)

120
0:05:54.76,000 --> 0:05:56,000
the reliability of the O-ring wouldn't have mattered

121
0:05:57.24,000 --> 0:05:58,000
because the machine would have crashed.

122
0:05:59.122,000 --> 0:06:,000
(Laughter)

123
0:06:01.96,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Here's the broader point.

124
0:06:03.56,000 --> 0:06:06,000
In much of the work that we do, we are the O-rings.

125
0:06:07.4,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Yes, ATMs could do certain cash-handling tasks

126
0:06:10.96,000 --> 0:06:13,000
faster and better than tellers,

127
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:16,000
but that didn't make tellers superfluous.

128
0:06:16.08,000 --> 0:06:19,000
It increased the importance of their problem-solving skills

129
0:06:19.4,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and their relationships with customers.

130
0:06:22.04,000 --> 0:06:25,000
The same principle applies if we're building a building,

131
0:06:25.36,000 --> 0:06:27,000
if we're diagnosing and caring for a patient,

132
0:06:27.92,000 --> 0:06:3,000
or if we are teaching a class

133
0:06:31.08,000 --> 0:06:33,000
to a roomful of high schoolers.

134
0:06:33.56,000 --> 0:06:35,000
As our tools improve,

135
0:06:35.96,000 --> 0:06:37,000
technology magnifies our leverage

136
0:06:38.08,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and increases the importance of our expertise

137
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and our judgment and our creativity.

138
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And that brings me to the second principle:

139
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
never get enough.

140
0:06:50.28,000 --> 0:06:52,000
You may be thinking, OK, O-ring, got it,

141
0:06:52.72,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that says the jobs that people do will be important.

142
0:06:55.84,000 --> 0:06:57,000
They can't be done by machines, but they still need to be done.

143
0:06:58.84,000 --> 0:07:,000
But that doesn't tell me how many jobs there will need to be.

144
0:07:01.76,000 --> 0:07:03,000
If you think about it, isn't it kind of self-evident

145
0:07:04.24,000 --> 0:07:06,000
that once we get sufficiently productive at something,

146
0:07:06.8,000 --> 0:07:08,000
we've basically worked our way out of a job?

147
0:07:08.92,000 --> 0:07:1,000
In 1900, 40 percent of all US employment

148
0:07:11.72,000 --> 0:07:12,000
was on farms.

149
0:07:13,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Today, it's less than two percent.

150
0:07:15.28,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Why are there so few farmers today?

151
0:07:17.48,000 --> 0:07:18,000
It's not because we're eating less.

152
0:07:19.36,000 --> 0:07:21,000
(Laughter)

153
0:07:22.04,000 --> 0:07:24,000
A century of productivity growth in farming

154
0:07:24.8,000 --> 0:07:26,000
means that now, a couple of million farmers

155
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:29,000
can feed a nation of 320 million.

156
0:07:29.76,000 --> 0:07:3,000
That's amazing progress,

157
0:07:31.44,000 --> 0:07:35,000
but it also means there are only so many O-ring jobs left in farming.

158
0:07:35.6,000 --> 0:07:38,000
So clearly, technology can eliminate jobs.

159
0:07:38.64,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Farming is only one example.

160
0:07:40.4,000 --> 0:07:41,000
There are many others like it.

161
0:07:43.44,000 --> 0:07:46,000
But what's true about a single product or service or industry

162
0:07:47.44,000 --> 0:07:49,000
has never been true about the economy as a whole.

163
0:07:50.24,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Many of the industries in which we now work --

164
0:07:52.76,000 --> 0:07:54,000
health and medicine,

165
0:07:54.92,000 --> 0:07:56,000
finance and insurance,

166
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
electronics and computing --

167
0:07:59.72,000 --> 0:08:01,000
were tiny or barely existent a century ago.

168
0:08:02.48,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Many of the products that we spend a lot of our money on --

169
0:08:05.32,000 --> 0:08:07,000
air conditioners, sport utility vehicles,

170
0:08:07.48,000 --> 0:08:08,000
computers and mobile devices --

171
0:08:09.2,000 --> 0:08:1,000
were unattainably expensive,

172
0:08:10.88,000 --> 0:08:12,000
or just hadn't been invented a century ago.

173
0:08:13.92,000 --> 0:08:17,000
As automation frees our time, increases the scope of what is possible,

174
0:08:18.92,000 --> 0:08:21,000
we invent new products, new ideas, new services

175
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that command our attention,

176
0:08:23.76,000 --> 0:08:24,000
occupy our time

177
0:08:25.32,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and spur consumption.

178
0:08:27.76,000 --> 0:08:3,000
You may think some of these things are frivolous --

179
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:33,000
extreme yoga, adventure tourism,

180
0:08:33.8,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Pokémon GO --

181
0:08:35.08,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and I might agree with you.

182
0:08:36.979,000 --> 0:08:39,000
But people desire these things, and they're willing to work hard for them.

183
0:08:40.48,000 --> 0:08:42,000
The average worker in 2015

184
0:08:42.68,000 --> 0:08:46,000
wanting to attain the average living standard in 1915

185
0:08:46.96,000 --> 0:08:49,000
could do so by working just 17 weeks a year,

186
0:08:50.32,000 --> 0:08:51,000
one third of the time.

187
0:08:52.24,000 --> 0:08:54,000
But most people don't choose to do that.

188
0:08:54.44,000 --> 0:08:55,000
They are willing to work hard

189
0:08:56.159,000 --> 0:08:59,000
to harvest the technological bounty that is available to them.

190
0:09:00.48,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Material abundance has never eliminated perceived scarcity.

191
0:09:04.6,000 --> 0:09:06,000
In the words of economist Thorstein Veblen,

192
0:09:07.2,000 --> 0:09:09,000
invention is the mother of necessity.

193
0:09:11.52,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Now ...

194
0:09:13.4,000 --> 0:09:14,000
So if you accept these two principles,

195
0:09:15.28,000 --> 0:09:17,000
the O-ring principle and the never-get-enough principle,

196
0:09:18.2,000 --> 0:09:19,000
then you agree with me.

197
0:09:19.56,000 --> 0:09:2,000
There will be jobs.

198
0:09:21.56,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Does that mean there's nothing to worry about?

199
0:09:23.76,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Automation, employment, robots and jobs --

200
0:09:26.56,000 --> 0:09:27,000
it'll all take care of itself?

201
0:09:29.12,000 --> 0:09:3,000
No.

202
0:09:30.36,000 --> 0:09:32,000
That is not my argument.

203
0:09:32.44,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Automation creates wealth

204
0:09:35,000 --> 0:09:37,000
by allowing us to do more work in less time.

205
0:09:37.6,000 --> 0:09:38,000
There is no economic law

206
0:09:39.2,000 --> 0:09:41,000
that says that we will use that wealth well,

207
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and that is worth worrying about.

208
0:09:44.8,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Consider two countries,

209
0:09:46.64,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Norway and Saudi Arabia.

210
0:09:48.8,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Both oil-rich nations,

211
0:09:50.4,000 --> 0:09:53,000
it's like they have money spurting out of a hole in the ground.

212
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:55,000
(Laughter)

213
0:09:55.56,000 --> 0:10:,000
But they haven't used that wealth equally well to foster human prosperity,

214
0:10:00.8,000 --> 0:10:01,000
human prospering.

215
0:10:02.44,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Norway is a thriving democracy.

216
0:10:05.2,000 --> 0:10:08,000
By and large, its citizens work and play well together.

217
0:10:08.88,000 --> 0:10:11,000
It's typically numbered between first and fourth

218
0:10:11.92,000 --> 0:10:13,000
in rankings of national happiness.

219
0:10:14.68,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy

220
0:10:17.36,000 --> 0:10:2,000
in which many citizens lack a path for personal advancement.

221
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:24,000
It's typically ranked 35th among nations in happiness,

222
0:10:24.52,000 --> 0:10:26,000
which is low for such a wealthy nation.

223
0:10:26.64,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Just by way of comparison,

224
0:10:28,000 --> 0:10:3,000
the US is typically ranked around 12th or 13th.

225
0:10:31.4,000 --> 0:10:33,000
The difference between these two countries

226
0:10:33.52,000 --> 0:10:34,000
is not their wealth

227
0:10:34.8,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and it's not their technology.

228
0:10:36.56,000 --> 0:10:37,000
It's their institutions.

229
0:10:38.56,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Norway has invested to build a society

230
0:10:41.76,000 --> 0:10:44,000
with opportunity and economic mobility.

231
0:10:45.12,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Saudi Arabia has raised living standards

232
0:10:47.32,000 --> 0:10:5,000
while frustrating many other human strivings.

233
0:10:50.6,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Two countries, both wealthy,

234
0:10:53.4,000 --> 0:10:54,000
not equally well off.

235
0:10:55.88,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And this brings me to the challenge that we face today,

236
0:11:00.24,000 --> 0:11:02,000
the challenge that automation poses for us.

237
0:11:02.4,000 --> 0:11:04,000
The challenge is not that we're running out of work.

238
0:11:04.88,000 --> 0:11:05,000
The US has added 14 million jobs

239
0:11:06.84,000 --> 0:11:08,000
since the depths of the Great Recession.

240
0:11:09,000 --> 0:11:11,000
The challenge is that many of those jobs

241
0:11:11.56,000 --> 0:11:12,000
are not good jobs,

242
0:11:12.88,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and many citizens cannot qualify for the good jobs

243
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
that are being created.

244
0:11:17.84,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Employment growth in the United States and in much of the developed world

245
0:11:21.36,000 --> 0:11:22,000
looks something like a barbell

246
0:11:22.84,000 --> 0:11:25,000
with increasing poundage on either end of the bar.

247
0:11:26.24,000 --> 0:11:27,000
On the one hand,

248
0:11:27.48,000 --> 0:11:29,000
you have high-education, high-wage jobs

249
0:11:30.32,000 --> 0:11:33,000
like doctors and nurses, programmers and engineers,

250
0:11:33.92,000 --> 0:11:34,000
marketing and sales managers.

251
0:11:35.68,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Employment is robust in these jobs, employment growth.

252
0:11:38.72,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Similarly, employment growth is robust in many low-skill,

253
0:11:42.76,000 --> 0:11:45,000
low-education jobs like food service,

254
0:11:45.84,000 --> 0:11:47,000
cleaning, security,

255
0:11:48.12,000 --> 0:11:49,000
home health aids.

256
0:11:50.08,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Simultaneously, employment is shrinking

257
0:11:53.2,000 --> 0:11:57,000
in many middle-education, middle-wage, middle-class jobs,

258
0:11:57.28,000 --> 0:12:,000
like blue-collar production and operative positions

259
0:12:01.12,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and white-collar clerical and sales positions.

260
0:12:04.12,000 --> 0:12:06,000
The reasons behind this contracting middle

261
0:12:06.4,000 --> 0:12:07,000
are not mysterious.

262
0:12:07.64,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Many of those middle-skill jobs

263
0:12:09.64,000 --> 0:12:11,000
use well-understood rules and procedures

264
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
that can increasingly be codified in software

265
0:12:15.28,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and executed by computers.

266
0:12:18.2,000 --> 0:12:21,000
The challenge that this phenomenon creates,

267
0:12:21.6,000 --> 0:12:23,000
what economists call employment polarization,

268
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
is that it knocks out rungs in the economic ladder,

269
0:12:26.8,000 --> 0:12:27,000
shrinks the size of the middle class

270
0:12:28.64,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and threatens to make us a more stratified society.

271
0:12:31.8,000 --> 0:12:35,000
On the one hand, a set of highly paid, highly educated professionals

272
0:12:35.88,000 --> 0:12:36,000
doing interesting work,

273
0:12:37.32,000 --> 0:12:4,000
on the other, a large number of citizens in low-paid jobs

274
0:12:40.76,000 --> 0:12:45,000
whose primary responsibility is to see to the comfort and health of the affluent.

275
0:12:46.44,000 --> 0:12:48,000
That is not my vision of progress,

276
0:12:48.8,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and I doubt that it is yours.

277
0:12:51.44,000 --> 0:12:53,000
But here is some encouraging news.

278
0:12:53.48,000 --> 0:12:57,000
We have faced equally momentous economic transformations in the past,

279
0:12:58.36,000 --> 0:13:,000
and we have come through them successfully.

280
0:13:01.08,000 --> 0:13:05,000
In the late 1800s and early 1900s,

281
0:13:06.04,000 --> 0:13:1,000
when automation was eliminating vast numbers of agricultural jobs --

282
0:13:10.6,000 --> 0:13:12,000
remember that tractor? --

283
0:13:12.96,000 --> 0:13:14,000
the farm states faced a threat of mass unemployment,

284
0:13:15.68,000 --> 0:13:18,000
a generation of youth no longer needed on the farm

285
0:13:19.52,000 --> 0:13:2,000
but not prepared for industry.

286
0:13:22.08,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Rising to this challenge,

287
0:13:23.68,000 --> 0:13:24,000
they took the radical step

288
0:13:25.2,000 --> 0:13:27,000
of requiring that their entire youth population

289
0:13:28.04,000 --> 0:13:3,000
remain in school and continue their education

290
0:13:30.92,000 --> 0:13:32,000
to the ripe old age of 16.

291
0:13:33.6,000 --> 0:13:34,000
This was called the high school movement,

292
0:13:35.6,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and it was a radically expensive thing to do.

293
0:13:38.44,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Not only did they have to invest in the schools,

294
0:13:40.72,000 --> 0:13:42,000
but those kids couldn't work at their jobs.

295
0:13:43.44,000 --> 0:13:46,000
It also turned out to be one of the best investments

296
0:13:46.76,000 --> 0:13:48,000
the US made in the 20th century.

297
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:51,000
It gave us the most skilled, the most flexible

298
0:13:51.36,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and the most productive workforce in the world.

299
0:13:54.08,000 --> 0:13:58,000
To see how well this worked, imagine taking the labor force of 1899

300
0:13:58.64,000 --> 0:14:,000
and bringing them into the present.

301
0:14:00.88,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Despite their strong backs and good characters,

302
0:14:03.84,000 --> 0:14:06,000
many of them would lack the basic literacy and numeracy skills

303
0:14:07.64,000 --> 0:14:09,000
to do all but the most mundane jobs.

304
0:14:10.6,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Many of them would be unemployable.

305
0:14:13.84,000 --> 0:14:16,000
What this example highlights is the primacy of our institutions,

306
0:14:17.6,000 --> 0:14:18,000
most especially our schools,

307
0:14:19.4,000 --> 0:14:21,000
in allowing us to reap the harvest

308
0:14:21.96,000 --> 0:14:23,000
of our technological prosperity.

309
0:14:24.28,000 --> 0:14:26,000
It's foolish to say there's nothing to worry about.

310
0:14:26.72,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Clearly we can get this wrong.

311
0:14:29.64,000 --> 0:14:32,000
If the US had not invested in its schools and in its skills

312
0:14:33.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
a century ago with the high school movement,

313
0:14:35.44,000 --> 0:14:36,000
we would be a less prosperous,

314
0:14:37.12,000 --> 0:14:4,000
a less mobile and probably a lot less happy society.

315
0:14:40.76,000 --> 0:14:42,000
But it's equally foolish to say that our fates are sealed.

316
0:14:43.52,000 --> 0:14:44,000
That's not decided by the machines.

317
0:14:45.24,000 --> 0:14:46,000
It's not even decided by the market.

318
0:14:47,000 --> 0:14:49,000
It's decided by us and by our institutions.

319
0:14:50.36,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Now, I started this talk with a paradox.

320
0:14:52.96,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Our machines increasingly do our work for us.

321
0:14:55.64,000 --> 0:14:57,000
Why doesn't that make our labor superfluous,

322
0:14:57.92,000 --> 0:14:58,000
our skills redundant?

323
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Isn't it obvious that the road to our economic and social hell

324
0:15:02.6,000 --> 0:15:04,000
is paved with our own great inventions?

325
0:15:06.04,000 --> 0:15:1,000
History has repeatedly offered an answer to that paradox.

326
0:15:10.24,000 --> 0:15:13,000
The first part of the answer is that technology magnifies our leverage,

327
0:15:13.88,000 --> 0:15:15,000
increases the importance, the added value

328
0:15:16.52,000 --> 0:15:19,000
of our expertise, our judgment and our creativity.

329
0:15:20.08,000 --> 0:15:21,000
That's the O-ring.

330
0:15:21.88,000 --> 0:15:23,000
The second part of the answer is our endless inventiveness

331
0:15:24.64,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and bottomless desires

332
0:15:26.12,000 --> 0:15:28,000
means that we never get enough, never get enough.

333
0:15:28.48,000 --> 0:15:3,000
There's always new work to do.

334
0:15:31.96,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Adjusting to the rapid pace of technological change

335
0:15:35.32,000 --> 0:15:36,000
creates real challenges,

336
0:15:36.8,000 --> 0:15:38,000
seen most clearly in our polarized labor market

337
0:15:39.8,000 --> 0:15:41,000
and the threat that it poses to economic mobility.

338
0:15:43.32,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Rising to this challenge is not automatic.

339
0:15:46.4,000 --> 0:15:47,000
It's not costless.

340
0:15:47.92,000 --> 0:15:48,000
It's not easy.

341
0:15:49.36,000 --> 0:15:5,000
But it is feasible.

342
0:15:51.12,000 --> 0:15:52,000
And here is some encouraging news.

343
0:15:52.96,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Because of our amazing productivity,

344
0:15:55.12,000 --> 0:15:56,000
we're rich.

345
0:15:56.4,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Of course we can afford to invest in ourselves and in our children

346
0:15:59.56,000 --> 0:16:02,000
as America did a hundred years ago with the high school movement.

347
0:16:02.92,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Arguably, we can't afford not to.

348
0:16:06.12,000 --> 0:16:07,000
Now, you may be thinking,

349
0:16:07.92,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Professor Autor has told us a heartwarming tale

350
0:16:10.8,000 --> 0:16:11,000
about the distant past,

351
0:16:12.6,000 --> 0:16:13,000
the recent past,

352
0:16:14,000 --> 0:16:17,000
maybe the present, but probably not the future.

353
0:16:17.32,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Because everybody knows that this time is different.

354
0:16:21.28,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Right? Is this time different?

355
0:16:24.12,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Of course this time is different.

356
0:16:26.04,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Every time is different.

357
0:16:27.76,000 --> 0:16:3,000
On numerous occasions in the last 200 years,

358
0:16:31.4,000 --> 0:16:33,000
scholars and activists have raised the alarm

359
0:16:34.2,000 --> 0:16:37,000
that we are running out of work and making ourselves obsolete:

360
0:16:37.76,000 --> 0:16:41,000
for example, the Luddites in the early 1800s;

361
0:16:42.4,000 --> 0:16:44,000
US Secretary of Labor James Davis

362
0:16:45.36,000 --> 0:16:47,000
in the mid-1920s;

363
0:16:47.8,000 --> 0:16:52,000
Nobel Prize-winning economist Wassily Leontief in 1982;

364
0:16:53,000 --> 0:16:56,000
and of course, many scholars,

365
0:16:56.28,000 --> 0:16:58,000
pundits, technologists

366
0:16:58.44,000 --> 0:16:59,000
and media figures today.

367
0:17:01.6,000 --> 0:17:04,000
These predictions strike me as arrogant.

368
0:17:05.8,000 --> 0:17:07,000
These self-proclaimed oracles are in effect saying,

369
0:17:08.52,000 --> 0:17:11,000
"If I can't think of what people will do for work in the future,

370
0:17:11.96,000 --> 0:17:13,000
then you, me and our kids

371
0:17:14.88,000 --> 0:17:15,000
aren't going to think of it either."

372
0:17:17.76,000 --> 0:17:18,000
I don't have the guts

373
0:17:19.72,000 --> 0:17:22,000
to take that bet against human ingenuity.

374
0:17:22.92,000 --> 0:17:24,000
Look, I can't tell you what people are going to do for work

375
0:17:25.92,000 --> 0:17:26,000
a hundred years from now.

376
0:17:27.839,000 --> 0:17:29,000
But the future doesn't hinge on my imagination.

377
0:17:31.28,000 --> 0:17:34,000
If I were a farmer in Iowa in the year 1900,

378
0:17:35.079,000 --> 0:17:38,000
and an economist from the 21st century teleported down to my field

379
0:17:38.64,000 --> 0:17:4,000
and said, "Hey, guess what, farmer Autor,

380
0:17:42,000 --> 0:17:43,000
in the next hundred years,

381
0:17:43.56,000 --> 0:17:46,000
agricultural employment is going to fall from 40 percent of all jobs

382
0:17:47.36,000 --> 0:17:48,000
to two percent

383
0:17:48.6,000 --> 0:17:5,000
purely due to rising productivity.

384
0:17:51.4,000 --> 0:17:54,000
What do you think the other 38 percent of workers are going to do?"

385
0:17:55.4,000 --> 0:17:57,000
I would not have said, "Oh, we got this.

386
0:17:58.24,000 --> 0:18:,000
We'll do app development, radiological medicine,

387
0:18:01.12,000 --> 0:18:03,000
yoga instruction, Bitmoji."

388
0:18:04.12,000 --> 0:18:05,000
(Laughter)

389
0:18:05.68,000 --> 0:18:06,000
I wouldn't have had a clue.

390
0:18:07.84,000 --> 0:18:09,000
But I hope I would have had the wisdom to say,

391
0:18:10.36,000 --> 0:18:14,000
"Wow, a 95 percent reduction in farm employment

392
0:18:14.4,000 --> 0:18:16,000
with no shortage of food.

393
0:18:16.56,000 --> 0:18:18,000
That's an amazing amount of progress.

394
0:18:19,000 --> 0:18:22,000
I hope that humanity finds something remarkable to do

395
0:18:22.4,000 --> 0:18:23,000
with all of that prosperity."

396
0:18:25.12,000 --> 0:18:28,000
And by and large, I would say that it has.

397
0:18:29.96,000 --> 0:18:3,000
Thank you very much.

398
0:18:31.24,000 --> 0:18:36,000
(Applause)

Transcriber: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Camille Martínez

2
0:00:15.219,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Can you hear me OK?

3
0:00:16.403,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Audience: Yes.

4
0:00:17.935,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Jim Hudspeth: OK. Well, if you can, it's really amazing,

5
0:00:20.618,000 --> 0:00:24,000
because my voice is changing the air pressure where you sit

6
0:00:24.792,000 --> 0:00:27,000
by just a few billionths of the atmospheric level,

7
0:00:28.097,000 --> 0:00:29,000
yet we take it for granted

8
0:00:29.656,000 --> 0:00:32,000
that your ears can capture that infinitesimal signal

9
0:00:33.055,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and use it to signal to the brain the full range of auditory experiences:

10
0:00:37.579,000 --> 0:00:4,000
the human voice, music, the natural world.

11
0:00:42.349,000 --> 0:00:43,000
How does your ear do that?

12
0:00:44.029,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And the answer to that is:

13
0:00:45.811,000 --> 0:00:48,000
through the cells that are the real hero of this presentation --

14
0:00:49.336,000 --> 0:00:51,000
the ear's sensory receptors,

15
0:00:51.557,000 --> 0:00:53,000
which are called "hair cells."

16
0:00:53.987,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Now, these hair cells are unfortunately named,

17
0:00:57.676,000 --> 0:00:59,000
because they have nothing at all to do with the kind of hair

18
0:01:00.549,000 --> 0:01:01,000
of which I have less and less.

19
0:01:02.25,000 --> 0:01:06,000
These cells were originally named that by early microscopists,

20
0:01:07.221,000 --> 0:01:1,000
who noticed that emanating from one end of the cell

21
0:01:10.645,000 --> 0:01:12,000
was a little cluster of bristles.

22
0:01:13.227,000 --> 0:01:16,000
With modern electron microscopy, we can see much better

23
0:01:16.698,000 --> 0:01:19,000
the nature of the special feature that gives the hair cell its name.

24
0:01:20.536,000 --> 0:01:21,000
That's the hair bundle.

25
0:01:22.184,000 --> 0:01:28,000
It's this cluster of 20 to several hundred fine cylindrical rods

26
0:01:28.552,000 --> 0:01:3,000
that stand upright at the top end of the cell.

27
0:01:31.874,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And this apparatus is what is responsible for your hearing me right this instant.

28
0:01:38.283,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Now, I must say that I am somewhat in love with these cells.

29
0:01:41.41,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I've spent 45 years in their company --

30
0:01:44.426,000 --> 0:01:45,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:45.468,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and part of the reason is that they're really beautiful.

32
0:01:48.117,000 --> 0:01:49,000
There's an aesthetic component to it.

33
0:01:50.075,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Here, for example, are the cells

34
0:01:52.188,000 --> 0:01:55,000
with which an ordinary chicken conducts its hearing.

35
0:01:55.441,000 --> 0:01:58,000
These are the cells that a bat uses for its sonar.

36
0:01:59.142,000 --> 0:02:03,000
We use these large hair cells from a frog for many of our experiments.

37
0:02:03.621,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Hair cells are found all the way down to the most primitive of fishes,

38
0:02:07.74,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and those of reptiles often have this really beautiful,

39
0:02:11.168,000 --> 0:02:12,000
almost crystalline, order.

40
0:02:13.468,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But above and beyond its beauty,

41
0:02:15.433,000 --> 0:02:17,000
the hair bundle is an antenna.

42
0:02:18.195,000 --> 0:02:23,000
It's a machine for converting sound vibrations into electrical responses

43
0:02:23.938,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that the brain can then interpret.

44
0:02:26.707,000 --> 0:02:29,000
At the top of each hair bundle, as you can see in this image,

45
0:02:30.047,000 --> 0:02:33,000
there's a fine filament connecting each of the little hairs,

46
0:02:33.485,000 --> 0:02:34,000
the stereocilia.

47
0:02:35.185,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It's here marked with a little red triangle.

48
0:02:38.04,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And this filament has at its base a couple of ion channels,

49
0:02:41.823,000 --> 0:02:43,000
which are proteins that span the membrane.

50
0:02:44.535,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And here's how it works.

51
0:02:47.053,000 --> 0:02:5,000
This rat trap represents an ion channel.

52
0:02:50.424,000 --> 0:02:53,000
It has a pore that passes potassium ions and calcium ions.

53
0:02:54.434,000 --> 0:02:58,000
It has a little molecular gate that can be open, or it can be closed.

54
0:02:58.871,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And its status is set by this elastic band which represents that protein filament.

55
0:03:05.242,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Now, imagine that this arm represents one stereocilium

56
0:03:09.141,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and this arm represents the adjacent, shorter one

57
0:03:12.247,000 --> 0:03:14,000
with the elastic band between them.

58
0:03:14.57,000 --> 0:03:17,000
When sound energy impinges upon the hair bundle,

59
0:03:17.68,000 --> 0:03:2,000
it pushes it in the direction towards its taller edge.

60
0:03:20.863,000 --> 0:03:22,000
The sliding of the stereocilia puts tension in the link

61
0:03:23.685,000 --> 0:03:26,000
until the channels open and ions rush into the cell.

62
0:03:27.255,000 --> 0:03:29,000
When the hair bundle is pushed in the opposite direction,

63
0:03:29.986,000 --> 0:03:3,000
the channels close.

64
0:03:31.42,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And, most importantly,

65
0:03:32.871,000 --> 0:03:34,000
a back-and-forth motion of the hair bundle,

66
0:03:35.192,000 --> 0:03:39,000
as ensues during the application of acoustic waves,

67
0:03:39.809,000 --> 0:03:41,000
alternately opens and closes the channel,

68
0:03:42.354,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and each opening admits millions and millions of ions into the cell.

69
0:03:47.128,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Those ions constitute an electrical current

70
0:03:49.648,000 --> 0:03:5,000
that excites the cell.

71
0:03:51.453,000 --> 0:03:53,000
The excitation is passed to a nerve fiber,

72
0:03:53.905,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and then propagates into the brain.

73
0:03:57.084,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Notice that the intensity of the sound

74
0:03:59.116,000 --> 0:04:01,000
is represented by the magnitude of this response.

75
0:04:01.861,000 --> 0:04:03,000
A louder sound pushes the hair bundle farther,

76
0:04:04.768,000 --> 0:04:05,000
opens the channel longer,

77
0:04:06.275,000 --> 0:04:07,000
lets more ions in

78
0:04:07.804,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and gives rise to a bigger response.

79
0:04:12.944,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Now, this mode of operation has the advantage of great speed.

80
0:04:16.735,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Some of our senses, such as vision,

81
0:04:19.253,000 --> 0:04:21,000
use chemical reactions that take time.

82
0:04:22.042,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And as a consequence of that,

83
0:04:23.476,000 --> 0:04:27,000
if I show you a series of pictures at intervals of 20 or 30 per second,

84
0:04:27.83,000 --> 0:04:29,000
you get the sense of a continuous image.

85
0:04:30.714,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Because it doesn't use reactions,

86
0:04:32.808,000 --> 0:04:36,000
the hair cell is fully 1,000 times faster than our other senses.

87
0:04:37.195,000 --> 0:04:41,000
We can hear sounds at frequencies as great as 20,000 cycles per second,

88
0:04:42.118,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and some animals have ever faster ears.

89
0:04:44.703,000 --> 0:04:48,000
The ears of bats and whales, for example, can respond to their sonar pulses

90
0:04:49.529,000 --> 0:04:52,000
at 150,000 cycles a second.

91
0:04:53.905,000 --> 0:04:58,000
But this speed doesn't entirely explain why the ear performs so well.

92
0:04:59.512,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And it turns out that our hearing benefits from an amplifier,

93
0:05:03.836,000 --> 0:05:05,000
something called the "active process."

94
0:05:07.004,000 --> 0:05:09,000
The active process enhances our hearing

95
0:05:09.957,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and makes possible all the remarkable features that I've already mentioned.

96
0:05:15.034,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Let me tell you how it works.

97
0:05:17.658,000 --> 0:05:2,000
First of all, the active process amplifies sound,

98
0:05:21.266,000 --> 0:05:26,000
so you can hear, at threshold, sounds that move the hair bundle

99
0:05:26.329,000 --> 0:05:28,000
by a distance of only about three-tenths of a nanometer.

100
0:05:29.047,000 --> 0:05:31,000
That's the diameter of one water molecule.

101
0:05:31.6,000 --> 0:05:32,000
It's really astonishing.

102
0:05:33.883,000 --> 0:05:37,000
The system can also operate

103
0:05:38.09,000 --> 0:05:41,000
over an enormously wide dynamic range.

104
0:05:41.927,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Why do we need this amplification?

105
0:05:43.885,000 --> 0:05:46,000
The amplification, in ancient times, was useful

106
0:05:47.023,000 --> 0:05:51,000
because it was valuable for us to hear the tiger before the tiger could hear us.

107
0:05:51.953,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And these days, it's essential as a distant early warning system.

108
0:05:56.969,000 --> 0:05:58,000
It's valuable to be able to hear fire alarms

109
0:05:59.856,000 --> 0:06:04,000
or contemporary dangerous such as speeding fire engines or police cars or the like.

110
0:06:06.542,000 --> 0:06:11,000
When the amplification fails, our hearing's sensitivity plummets,

111
0:06:11.93,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and an individual may then need an electronic hearing aid

112
0:06:16.245,000 --> 0:06:18,000
to supplant the damaged biological one.

113
0:06:19.559,000 --> 0:06:23,000
This active process also enhances our frequency selectivity.

114
0:06:24.022,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Even an untrained individual can distinguish two tones

115
0:06:27.295,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that differ by only two-tenths of a percent,

116
0:06:30.112,000 --> 0:06:34,000
which is one-thirtieth of the difference between two piano notes,

117
0:06:34.429,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and a trained musician can do even better.

118
0:06:37.27,000 --> 0:06:39,000
This fine discrimination is useful

119
0:06:39.606,000 --> 0:06:41,000
in our ability to distinguish different voices

120
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and to understand the nuances of speech.

121
0:06:44.799,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And, again, if the active process deteriorates,

122
0:06:47.706,000 --> 0:06:49,000
it becomes harder to carry out verbal communication.

123
0:06:51.423,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Finally, the active process is valuable in setting the very broad range

124
0:06:55.824,000 --> 0:06:58,000
of sound intensities that our ears can tolerate,

125
0:06:59.274,000 --> 0:07:02,000
from the very faintest sound that you can hear, such as a dropped pen,

126
0:07:03.097,000 --> 0:07:05,000
to the loudest sound that you can stand --

127
0:07:05.336,000 --> 0:07:07,000
say, a jackhammer or a jet plane.

128
0:07:07.727,000 --> 0:07:12,000
The amplitude of sounds spans a range of one millionfold,

129
0:07:12.834,000 --> 0:07:14,000
which is more than is encompassed by any other sense

130
0:07:15.527,000 --> 0:07:17,000
or by any man-made device of which I'm aware.

131
0:07:18.831,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And again, if this system deteriorates,

132
0:07:21.409,000 --> 0:07:23,000
an affected individual may have a hard time

133
0:07:24.175,000 --> 0:07:25,000
hearing the very faintest sounds

134
0:07:26.047,000 --> 0:07:29,000
or tolerating the very loudest ones.

135
0:07:30.122,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Now, to understand how the hair cell does its thing,

136
0:07:32.837,000 --> 0:07:35,000
one has to situate it within its environment within the ear.

137
0:07:36.792,000 --> 0:07:38,000
We learn in school that the organ of hearing

138
0:07:39.168,000 --> 0:07:41,000
is the coiled, snail-shaped cochlea.

139
0:07:41.944,000 --> 0:07:43,000
It's an organ about the size of a chickpea.

140
0:07:44.295,000 --> 0:07:47,000
It's embedded in the bone on either side of the skull.

141
0:07:48.211,000 --> 0:07:5,000
We also learn that an optical prism

142
0:07:51.061,000 --> 0:07:55,000
can separate white light into its constituent frequencies,

143
0:07:55.206,000 --> 0:07:57,000
which we see as distinct colors.

144
0:07:58.129,000 --> 0:07:59,000
In an analogous way,

145
0:07:59.824,000 --> 0:08:02,000
the cochlea acts as sort of an acoustic prism

146
0:08:03.289,000 --> 0:08:07,000
that splits apart complex sounds into their component frequencies.

147
0:08:08.139,000 --> 0:08:1,000
So when a piano is sounded,

148
0:08:10.237,000 --> 0:08:13,000
different notes blend together into a chord.

149
0:08:13.497,000 --> 0:08:14,000
The cochlea undoes that process.

150
0:08:15.371,000 --> 0:08:18,000
It separates them and represents each at a different position.

151
0:08:19.282,000 --> 0:08:21,000
In this picture, you can see where three notes --

152
0:08:21.628,000 --> 0:08:23,000
middle C and the two extreme notes on a piano --

153
0:08:24.467,000 --> 0:08:25,000
are represented in the cochlea.

154
0:08:26.61,000 --> 0:08:29,000
The lowest frequencies go all the way up to the top of the cochlea.

155
0:08:30.474,000 --> 0:08:32,000
The highest frequencies, down to 20,000 Hz,

156
0:08:33.329,000 --> 0:08:35,000
go all the way to the bottom of the cochlea,

157
0:08:35.892,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and every other frequency is represented somewhere in between.

158
0:08:40.171,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And, as this diagram shows,

159
0:08:42.001,000 --> 0:08:46,000
successive musical tones are represented a few tens of hair cells apart

160
0:08:46.975,000 --> 0:08:47,000
along the cochlear surface.

161
0:08:49.442,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Now, this separation of frequencies

162
0:08:51.343,000 --> 0:08:54,000
is really key in our ability to identify different sounds,

163
0:08:55.163,000 --> 0:08:56,000
because very musical instrument,

164
0:08:56.798,000 --> 0:08:57,000
every voice,

165
0:08:58.039,000 --> 0:09:01,000
emits a distinct constellation of tones.

166
0:09:01.523,000 --> 0:09:03,000
The cochlea separates those frequencies,

167
0:09:04.249,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and the 16,000 hair cells then report to the brain

168
0:09:08.055,000 --> 0:09:09,000
how much of each frequency is present.

169
0:09:10.213,000 --> 0:09:13,000
The brain can then compare all the nerve signals

170
0:09:13.244,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and decide what particular tone is being heard.

171
0:09:17.623,000 --> 0:09:21,000
But this doesn't explain everything that I want to explain.

172
0:09:21.836,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Where's the magic?

173
0:09:23.013,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I told you already about the great things that the hair cell can do.

174
0:09:27.463,000 --> 0:09:29,000
How does it carry out the active process

175
0:09:29.894,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and do all the remarkable features that I mentioned at the outset?

176
0:09:33.587,000 --> 0:09:34,000
The answer is instability.

177
0:09:36.046,000 --> 0:09:39,000
We used to think that the hair bundle was a passive object,

178
0:09:39.204,000 --> 0:09:42,000
it just sat there, except when it was stimulated.

179
0:09:42.509,000 --> 0:09:44,000
But in fact, it's an active machine.

180
0:09:44.753,000 --> 0:09:47,000
It's constantly using internal energy to do mechanical work

181
0:09:48.518,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and enhance our hearing.

182
0:09:50.281,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So even at rest, in the absence of any input,

183
0:09:53.636,000 --> 0:09:55,000
an active hair bundle is constantly trembling.

184
0:09:55.897,000 --> 0:09:57,000
It's constantly twitching back and forth.

185
0:09:58.145,000 --> 0:10:,000
But when even a weak sound is applied to it,

186
0:10:00.588,000 --> 0:10:03,000
it latches on to that sound and begins to move very neatly

187
0:10:03.749,000 --> 0:10:04,000
in a one-to-one way with it,

188
0:10:05.366,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and by so doing, it amplifies the signal about a thousand times.

189
0:10:10.984,000 --> 0:10:14,000
This same instability also enhances our frequency selectivity,

190
0:10:15.764,000 --> 0:10:17,000
for a given hair cell tends to oscillate best

191
0:10:18.505,000 --> 0:10:2,000
at the frequency at which it normally trembles

192
0:10:21.379,000 --> 0:10:22,000
when it's not being stimulated.

193
0:10:25.216,000 --> 0:10:3,000
So, this apparatus not only gives us our remarkably acute hearing,

194
0:10:30.622,000 --> 0:10:32,000
but also gives us the very sharp tuning.

195
0:10:37.139,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I want to offer you a short demonstration

196
0:10:39.713,000 --> 0:10:4,000
of something related to this.

197
0:10:41.456,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I'll ask the people who are running the sound system

198
0:10:44.537,000 --> 0:10:47,000
to turn up its sensitivity at one specific frequency.

199
0:10:48.111,000 --> 0:10:51,000
So just as a hair cell is tuned to one frequency,

200
0:10:51.755,000 --> 0:10:55,000
the amplifier will now enhance a particular frequency in my voice.

201
0:10:56.44,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Notice how specific tones emerge more clearly from the background.

202
0:11:02.157,000 --> 0:11:04,000
This is exactly what hair cells do.

203
0:11:04.841,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Each hair cell amplifies and reports one specific frequency

204
0:11:09.473,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and ignores all the others.

205
0:11:11.384,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And the whole set of hair cells, as a group, can then report to the brain

206
0:11:15.487,000 --> 0:11:18,000
exactly what frequencies are present in a given sound,

207
0:11:18.568,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and the brain can determine what melody is being heard

208
0:11:21.319,000 --> 0:11:23,000
or what speech is being intended.

209
0:11:25.775,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Now, an amplifier such as the public address system

210
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
can also cause problems.

211
0:11:31.075,000 --> 0:11:33,000
If the amplification is turned up too far,

212
0:11:33.337,000 --> 0:11:35,000
it goes unstable and begins to howl

213
0:11:35.84,000 --> 0:11:36,000
or emit sounds.

214
0:11:37.17,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And one wonders why the active process doesn't do the same thing.

215
0:11:40.377,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Why don't our ears beam out sounds?

216
0:11:43.396,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And the answer is that they do.

217
0:11:45.577,000 --> 0:11:49,000
In a suitably quiet environment, 70 percent of normal people

218
0:11:50.02,000 --> 0:11:53,000
will have one or more sounds coming out of their ears.

219
0:11:54.008,000 --> 0:11:55,000
(Laughter)

220
0:11:55.382,000 --> 0:11:57,000
I'll give you an example of this.

221
0:11:59.811,000 --> 0:12:02,000
You will hear two emissions at high frequencies

222
0:12:03.019,000 --> 0:12:04,000
coming from a normal human ear.

223
0:12:04.817,000 --> 0:12:06,000
You may also be able to discern background noise,

224
0:12:07.74,000 --> 0:12:08,000
like the microphone's hiss,

225
0:12:09.126,000 --> 0:12:12,000
the gurgling of a stomach, the heartbeat, the rustling of clothes.

226
0:12:14.951,000 --> 0:12:2,000
(Hums, microphone hiss, dampened taps, clothes rustling)

227
0:12:29.941,000 --> 0:12:3,000
This is typical.

228
0:12:31.117,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Most ears emit just a handful of tones,

229
0:12:33.053,000 --> 0:12:35,000
but some can emit as many as 30.

230
0:12:35.634,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Every ear is unique, so my right ear is different from my left,

231
0:12:38.94,000 --> 0:12:4,000
my ear is different from your ear,

232
0:12:41.002,000 --> 0:12:42,000
but unless an ear is damaged,

233
0:12:42.474,000 --> 0:12:45,000
it continues to emit the same spectrum of frequencies

234
0:12:46.034,000 --> 0:12:48,000
over a period of years or even decades.

235
0:12:49.031,000 --> 0:12:5,000
So what's going on?

236
0:12:50.803,000 --> 0:12:55,000
It turns out that the ear can control its own sensitivity,

237
0:12:55.919,000 --> 0:12:56,000
its own amplification.

238
0:12:57.683,000 --> 0:13:,000
So if you're in a very loud environment, like a sporting event

239
0:13:00.987,000 --> 0:13:01,000
or a musical concert,

240
0:13:02.7,000 --> 0:13:03,000
you don't need any amplification,

241
0:13:04.496,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and the system is turned down all the way.

242
0:13:07.177,000 --> 0:13:09,000
If you are in a room like this auditorium,

243
0:13:09.426,000 --> 0:13:11,000
you might have a little bit of amplification,

244
0:13:11.593,000 --> 0:13:14,000
but of course the public address system does most of the work for you.

245
0:13:15.233,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And finally, if you go into a really quiet room

246
0:13:17.507,000 --> 0:13:18,000
where you can hear a pin drop,

247
0:13:18.986,000 --> 0:13:2,000
the system is turned up almost all the way.

248
0:13:21.839,000 --> 0:13:24,000
But if you go into an ultraquiet room such as a sound chamber,

249
0:13:25.351,000 --> 0:13:27,000
the system turns itself up to 11,

250
0:13:27.782,000 --> 0:13:28,000
it goes unstable

251
0:13:29.187,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and it begins to emit sound.

252
0:13:31.52,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And these emissions constitute a really strong demonstration

253
0:13:34.74,000 --> 0:13:37,000
of just how active the hair cell can be.

254
0:13:39.141,000 --> 0:13:43,000
So in the last minute, I want to turn to another question that might come up,

255
0:13:43.701,000 --> 0:13:44,000
which is: Where do we go from here?

256
0:13:45.45,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And I would say that there are three issues

257
0:13:47.516,000 --> 0:13:49,000
that I would really like to address in the future.

258
0:13:50.317,000 --> 0:13:52,000
The first is: What is the molecular motor

259
0:13:52.724,000 --> 0:13:55,000
that's responsible for the hair cell's amplification?

260
0:13:56.024,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Somehow, nature has stumbled across a system

261
0:13:59.117,000 --> 0:14:04,000
that can oscillate or amplify at 20,000 cycles per second,

262
0:14:04.362,000 --> 0:14:05,000
or even more.

263
0:14:06.078,000 --> 0:14:09,000
That's much faster than any other biological oscillation,

264
0:14:09.285,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and we would like to understand where it comes from.

265
0:14:12.538,000 --> 0:14:15,000
The second issue is how the hair cell's amplification is adjusted

266
0:14:16.4,000 --> 0:14:18,000
to deal with the acoustic circumstances.

267
0:14:19.051,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Who turns the knob to increase or decrease the amplification

268
0:14:23.144,000 --> 0:14:25,000
in a quiet or in a loud environment?

269
0:14:26.665,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And the third issue is one that concerns all of us,

270
0:14:29.373,000 --> 0:14:33,000
which is what we can do about the deterioration of our hearing.

271
0:14:34.118,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Thirty million Americans,

272
0:14:35.495,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and more than 400 million people worldwide,

273
0:14:38.321,000 --> 0:14:4,000
have significant problems on a daily basis

274
0:14:40.908,000 --> 0:14:42,000
with understanding speech in a noisy environment

275
0:14:43.62,000 --> 0:14:44,000
or over the telephone.

276
0:14:45.553,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Many have even worse deficits.

277
0:14:47.753,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Moreover, these deficits tend to get worse with time,

278
0:14:50.753,000 --> 0:14:51,000
because when human hair cells die,

279
0:14:52.754,000 --> 0:14:54,000
they're not replaced by cell division.

280
0:14:56.045,000 --> 0:14:59,000
But we know that nonmammalian animals can replace their cells,

281
0:15:00.017,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and those creatures' cells are dying and being replaced throughout life,

282
0:15:03.447,000 --> 0:15:05,000
so the animals maintain normal hearing.

283
0:15:06.587,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Here's an example from a little zebra fish.

284
0:15:09.02,000 --> 0:15:11,000
The cell at the top will undergo a division

285
0:15:11.669,000 --> 0:15:13,000
to produce two new hair cells.

286
0:15:14.253,000 --> 0:15:16,000
They dance for a little bit,

287
0:15:16.459,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and then settle down and go to work.

288
0:15:19.126,000 --> 0:15:22,000
So we believe that if we can decode the molecular signals that are used

289
0:15:22.699,000 --> 0:15:25,000
by these other animals to regenerate their hair cells,

290
0:15:26.198,000 --> 0:15:28,000
we'll be able to do the same thing for humans.

291
0:15:29.048,000 --> 0:15:32,000
And our group and many other groups are now engaged in research

292
0:15:32.561,000 --> 0:15:34,000
trying to resurrect these amazing hair cells.

293
0:15:35.998,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Thank you for your attention.

294
0:15:37.506,000 --> 0:15:4,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.592,000 --> 0:00:15,000
This is me at age seven.

2
0:00:17.839,000 --> 0:00:18,000
And this is also me.

3
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
(Applause and cheering)

4
0:00:24.845,000 --> 0:00:28,000
To be standing here in Kakuma refugee camp feels so surreal,

5
0:00:29.215,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and I'm overcome with so much emotion.

6
0:00:32.255,000 --> 0:00:34,000
These very grounds are where I was born

7
0:00:34.282,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and spent the first seven years of my life.

8
0:00:37.878,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I think many people are surprised to hear

9
0:00:39.982,000 --> 0:00:41,000
that I had a great upbringing here at Kakuma.

10
0:00:43.25,000 --> 0:00:44,000
But I was happy,

11
0:00:44.523,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I was smart, I had friends

12
0:00:47.013,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and above all, I had hope for a brighter future.

13
0:00:50.842,000 --> 0:00:53,000
That's not to say that we didn't have our obstacles.

14
0:00:53.945,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I mean, boy were there struggles.

15
0:00:55.6,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I would sometimes get sick with malaria

16
0:00:58.114,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and didn't always know where our next meal would come from.

17
0:01:01.596,000 --> 0:01:04,000
But the sense of community that is here in Kakuma

18
0:01:05.046,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and the pride that everyone here possesses

19
0:01:07.515,000 --> 0:01:08,000
is simply unparalleled.

20
0:01:11.716,000 --> 0:01:14,000
When I was younger, I remember conflicts breaking out.

21
0:01:15.155,000 --> 0:01:18,000
That tends to happen when people come from different backgrounds

22
0:01:18.438,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and don't speak the same language.

23
0:01:20.326,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Eventually, Swahili --

24
0:01:21.631,000 --> 0:01:22,000
the main language here --

25
0:01:22.894,000 --> 0:01:23,000
became our common ground.

26
0:01:24.867,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I made friends with the kids at the camp

27
0:01:26.819,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and even started embracing some of their cultures,

28
0:01:29.526,000 --> 0:01:32,000
celebrating holidays like Christmas even though I was raised Muslim.

29
0:01:33.772,000 --> 0:01:35,000
The other kids would embrace my culture as well,

30
0:01:36.486,000 --> 0:01:38,000
sometimes even praying right alongside me.

31
0:01:39.943,000 --> 0:01:41,000
It was easy, as children, to come together,

32
0:01:42.685,000 --> 0:01:43,000
blend all of our beliefs

33
0:01:44.161,000 --> 0:01:47,000
to form our own unique, multicultural environment.

34
0:01:49.258,000 --> 0:01:5,000
My name is Halima Aden

35
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and I'm a black, Muslim, Somali-American from Kenya.

36
0:01:56.03,000 --> 0:01:58,000
(Applause)

37
0:01:59.012,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Some have called me a trailblazer --

38
0:02:01.303,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I was the first Muslim homecoming queen at my high school,

39
0:02:04.346,000 --> 0:02:06,000
the first Somali student senator at my college

40
0:02:07.133,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and the first hijab-wearing woman in many places,

41
0:02:09.964,000 --> 0:02:11,000
like the Miss Minnesota USA beauty pageant,

42
0:02:12.959,000 --> 0:02:15,000
the runways of Milan and New York Fashion Weeks

43
0:02:16.042,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and even on the historic cover of British "Vogue."

44
0:02:19.778,000 --> 0:02:2,000
As you can see,

45
0:02:21.73,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I'm not afraid to be the first, to step out on my own,

46
0:02:24.873,000 --> 0:02:25,000
to take risks and seek change,

47
0:02:26.493,000 --> 0:02:28,000
because that's what being a minority is about.

48
0:02:29.018,000 --> 0:02:31,000
It's about using yourself as a vessel to create change

49
0:02:31.963,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and being a human representation for the power of diversity.

50
0:02:36.5,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And now I use my platform to spread an important message of acceptance.

51
0:02:42.472,000 --> 0:02:43,000
But it hasn't always been easy.

52
0:02:44.726,000 --> 0:02:47,000
When we first arrived to the United States and made St. Louis, Missouri home,

53
0:02:49.464,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I remember asking my mom, "Is this really America?"

54
0:02:54.194,000 --> 0:02:56,000
There were things that were sadly familiar,

55
0:02:57.092,000 --> 0:02:58,000
like hearing gunshots at night

56
0:02:58.638,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and the streets looking impoverished.

57
0:03:01.328,000 --> 0:03:03,000
But there were things that were also very different.

58
0:03:04.188,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Like when I started first grade,

59
0:03:05.9,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I noticed how the kids played in groups.

60
0:03:08.032,000 --> 0:03:1,000
In America, we call them "cliques."

61
0:03:10.182,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Back here, we all played together.

62
0:03:13.024,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Gender didn't matter,

63
0:03:14.619,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and race most certainly never mattered.

64
0:03:17.246,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I remember asking myself,

65
0:03:19.429,000 --> 0:03:2,000
"Why don't they understand Swahili?

66
0:03:21.653,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Swahili is the language that brings people together."

67
0:03:26.605,000 --> 0:03:27,000
To make matters worse,

68
0:03:27.811,000 --> 0:03:3,000
the school I was enrolled in didn't have an English immersion program.

69
0:03:32.033,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So everyday I would get up,

70
0:03:34.249,000 --> 0:03:36,000
go to school, sit in my desk

71
0:03:36.368,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and never learn a thing.

72
0:03:38.773,000 --> 0:03:39,000
This is when I started losing hope,

73
0:03:40.794,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and I wanted nothing more than return to Kakuma,

74
0:03:43.9,000 --> 0:03:44,000
a refugee camp.

75
0:03:47.838,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Soon, my mother learned that many Somalis found refuge

76
0:03:50.771,000 --> 0:03:51,000
in a small town in Minnesota.

77
0:03:53.113,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So when I was eight, we moved to Minnesota.

78
0:03:57.326,000 --> 0:04:01,000
My life changed as I met other students who spoke Somali,

79
0:04:01.464,000 --> 0:04:04,000
attended a school that had an English immersion program

80
0:04:04.743,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and found teachers that would go above and beyond,

81
0:04:07.506,000 --> 0:04:09,000
staying there after school hours and lunch breaks,

82
0:04:10.18,000 --> 0:04:13,000
dedicated to helping me find success in the classroom.

83
0:04:14.427,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Being a child refugee has taught me that one could be stripped of everything:

84
0:04:19.356,000 --> 0:04:21,000
food, shelter, clean drinking water,

85
0:04:22.324,000 --> 0:04:23,000
even friendship,

86
0:04:23.937,000 --> 0:04:26,000
but the one thing that no one could ever take away from you

87
0:04:27.04,000 --> 0:04:28,000
is your education.

88
0:04:28.778,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So I made studying my top priority

89
0:04:31.557,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and soon started flourishing within the classroom.

90
0:04:36.154,000 --> 0:04:39,000
As I grew older, I became more aware of others

91
0:04:39.405,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and how they viewed my race and background.

92
0:04:42.303,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Specifically, when I started wearing the head scarf known as a hijab.

93
0:04:46.665,000 --> 0:04:48,000
When I first started wearing it, I was excited.

94
0:04:49.342,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I remember admiring my mother's, and I wanted to emulate her beauty.

95
0:04:54.055,000 --> 0:04:56,000
But when I started middle school,

96
0:04:56.316,000 --> 0:04:58,000
the students teased me about not having hair,

97
0:04:59.116,000 --> 0:05:,000
so to prove them wrong,

98
0:05:00.75,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I started showing them my hair --

99
0:05:03.217,000 --> 0:05:07,000
something that goes against my beliefs, but something I felt pressured to do.

100
0:05:07.943,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I wanted so badly to fit in at the time.

101
0:05:12.62,000 --> 0:05:17,000
When I reflect on the issues of race, religion, identity,

102
0:05:17.683,000 --> 0:05:19,000
a lot of painful memories come to mind.

103
0:05:20.644,000 --> 0:05:23,000
It would be easy for me to blame those of another culture

104
0:05:23.958,000 --> 0:05:25,000
for making me feel the pain I felt,

105
0:05:26.708,000 --> 0:05:27,000
but when I think deeper,

106
0:05:28.145,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I also recognize that the most impactful,

107
0:05:31.073,000 --> 0:05:34,000
positive, life-changing events that have happened to me

108
0:05:34.605,000 --> 0:05:36,000
are thanks to those people who are different than me.

109
0:05:38.6,000 --> 0:05:41,000
It was at this moment that I decided to step outside of my comfort zone

110
0:05:42.283,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and compete in a pageant wearing a hijab and burkini.

111
0:05:46.422,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I saw it as an opportunity to be a voice for women

112
0:05:49.543,000 --> 0:05:51,000
who, like myself, had felt underrepresented.

113
0:05:53.767,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And although I didn't capture the crown,

114
0:05:55.848,000 --> 0:05:57,000
that experience opened so many doors for me.

115
0:05:58.952,000 --> 0:06:01,000
I was receiving emails and messages from women all over the world,

116
0:06:02.967,000 --> 0:06:06,000
telling me that I've inspired them by simply staying true to myself.

117
0:06:08.107,000 --> 0:06:09,000
The other "firsts" kept coming.

118
0:06:10.763,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I was invited to New York City by fashion icon Carine Roitfeld

119
0:06:15.528,000 --> 0:06:17,000
to shoot my very first editorial.

120
0:06:18.212,000 --> 0:06:21,000
It was around this time that I became the first hijab-wearing model,

121
0:06:21.8,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and in my first year,

122
0:06:23.368,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I graced the covers of nine fashion magazines.

123
0:06:27.21,000 --> 0:06:29,000
It was a whirlwind, to say the least.

124
0:06:29.991,000 --> 0:06:31,000
But with all the overnight success,

125
0:06:32.384,000 --> 0:06:34,000
there was one thing that remained constant --

126
0:06:35.328,000 --> 0:06:38,000
the thought that this could be what brings me back here to Kakuma,

127
0:06:39.139,000 --> 0:06:4,000
the place that I call home.

128
0:06:42.78,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And just a few months ago, something incredible happened to me.

129
0:06:47.767,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I was in New York City, on a photo shoot,

130
0:06:50.434,000 --> 0:06:53,000
when I met South Sudanese model Adut Akech,

131
0:06:53.507,000 --> 0:06:56,000
who also happened to be born right here in Kakuma.

132
0:06:58.163,000 --> 0:07:01,000
That experience in itself is the definition of hope.

133
0:07:02.399,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I mean, just imagine:

134
0:07:04.363,000 --> 0:07:07,000
two girls born in the same refugee camp,

135
0:07:08.029,000 --> 0:07:11,000
reunited for the first time on the cover of British "Vogue."

136
0:07:12.557,000 --> 0:07:17,000
(Applause and cheering)

137
0:07:18.74,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I was given the distinct pleasure of partnering up with UNICEF,

138
0:07:22.527,000 --> 0:07:25,000
knowing firsthand the work that they do for children in need.

139
0:07:27.286,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And I want you to remember

140
0:07:28.97,000 --> 0:07:31,000
that although the children here may be refugees,

141
0:07:33.016,000 --> 0:07:34,000
they are children.

142
0:07:35.23,000 --> 0:07:4,000
They deserve every opportunity to flourish, to hope, to dream --

143
0:07:41.114,000 --> 0:07:42,000
to be successful.

144
0:07:44.522,000 --> 0:07:48,000
My story began right here in Kakuma refugee camp,

145
0:07:49.257,000 --> 0:07:5,000
a place of hope.

146
0:07:51.501,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Thank you.

147
0:07:52.676,000 --> 0:07:56,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.784,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Alright, so I want you to imagine that you get a text from a friend, and it reads ...

2
0:00:18.872,000 --> 0:00:21,000
"You will NOT believe what just happened. I'm SO MAD right now!"

3
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
So you do the dutiful thing as a friend, and you ask for details.

4
0:00:26.744,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And they tell you a story about what happened to them

5
0:00:29.307,000 --> 0:00:31,000
at the gym or at work or on their date last night.

6
0:00:31.771,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And you listen and you try to understand why they're so mad.

7
0:00:35.548,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Maybe even secretly judge whether or not they should be so mad.

8
0:00:38.875,000 --> 0:00:4,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:41.009,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And maybe you even offer some suggestions.

10
0:00:43.109,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Now, in that moment, you are doing essentially what I get to do every day,

11
0:00:46.673,000 --> 0:00:47,000
because I'm an anger researcher,

12
0:00:48.577,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and as an anger researcher, I spend a good part of my professional life --

13
0:00:52.931,000 --> 0:00:54,000
who am I kidding, also my personal life --

14
0:00:55.733,000 --> 0:00:56,000
studying why people get mad.

15
0:00:58.042,000 --> 0:01:,000
I study the types of thoughts they have when they get mad,

16
0:01:00.812,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and I even study what they do when they get mad,

17
0:01:03.117,000 --> 0:01:05,000
whether it's getting into fights or breaking things,

18
0:01:05.609,000 --> 0:01:07,000
or even yelling at people in all caps on the internet.

19
0:01:08.18,000 --> 0:01:08,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:09.188,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And as you can imagine,

21
0:01:10.578,000 --> 0:01:11,000
when people hear I'm an anger researcher,

22
0:01:12.585,000 --> 0:01:14,000
they want to talk to me about their anger,

23
0:01:14.609,000 --> 0:01:16,000
they want to share with me their anger stories.

24
0:01:16.846,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And it's not because they need a therapist,

25
0:01:18.871,000 --> 0:01:19,000
though that does sometimes happen,

26
0:01:20.53,000 --> 0:01:21,000
it's really because anger is universal.

27
0:01:22.434,000 --> 0:01:25,000
It's something we all feel and it's something they can relate to.

28
0:01:25.561,000 --> 0:01:27,000
We've been feeling it since the first few months of life,

29
0:01:28.292,000 --> 0:01:31,000
when we didn't get what we wanted in our cries of protests,

30
0:01:31.538,000 --> 0:01:34,000
things like, "What do you mean you won't pick up the rattle, Dad,

31
0:01:34.927,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I want it!"

32
0:01:36.109,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:38.141,000 --> 0:01:42,000
We feel it throughout our teenage years, as my mom can certainly attest to with me.

34
0:01:42.546,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Sorry, Mom.

35
0:01:44.188,000 --> 0:01:45,000
We feel it to the very end.

36
0:01:46.017,000 --> 0:01:49,000
In fact, anger has been with us at some of the worst moments of our lives.

37
0:01:50.321,000 --> 0:01:52,000
It's a natural and expected part of our grief.

38
0:01:53.195,000 --> 0:01:56,000
But it's also been with us in some of the best moments of our lives,

39
0:01:56.432,000 --> 0:01:59,000
with those special occasions like weddings and vacations

40
0:01:59.472,000 --> 0:02:01,000
often marred by these everyday frustrations --

41
0:02:02.292,000 --> 0:02:03,000
bad weather, travel delays --

42
0:02:03.836,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that feel horrible in the moment,

43
0:02:05.864,000 --> 0:02:08,000
but then are ultimately forgotten when things go OK.

44
0:02:09.99,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I have a lot of conversations with people about their anger

45
0:02:12.8,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and it's through those conversations that I've learned that many people,

46
0:02:16.221,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and I bet many people in this room right now,

47
0:02:18.387,000 --> 0:02:19,000
you see anger as a problem.

48
0:02:19.704,000 --> 0:02:21,000
You see the way it interferes in your life,

49
0:02:21.782,000 --> 0:02:24,000
the way it damages relationships, maybe even the ways it's scary.

50
0:02:24.95,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And while I get all of that, I see anger a little differently,

51
0:02:28.18,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and today, I want to tell you something really important

52
0:02:30.831,000 --> 0:02:31,000
about your anger, and it's this:

53
0:02:32.387,000 --> 0:02:35,000
anger is a powerful and healthy force in your life.

54
0:02:35.823,000 --> 0:02:36,000
It's good that you feel it.

55
0:02:37.546,000 --> 0:02:38,000
You need to feel it.

56
0:02:39.792,000 --> 0:02:41,000
But to understand all that, we actually have to back up

57
0:02:42.395,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and talk about why we get mad in the first place.

58
0:02:44.731,000 --> 0:02:46,000
A lot of this goes back to the work of an anger researcher

59
0:02:47.517,000 --> 0:02:51,000
named Dr. Jerry Deffenbacher, who wrote about this back in 1996

60
0:02:51.581,000 --> 0:02:53,000
in a book chapter on how to deal with problematic anger.

61
0:02:54.284,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Now, for most of us, and I bet most of you,

62
0:02:56.531,000 --> 0:02:57,000
it feels as simple as this:

63
0:02:58.497,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I get mad when I'm provoked.

64
0:03:00.506,000 --> 0:03:01,000
You hear it in the language people use.

65
0:03:02.434,000 --> 0:03:03,000
They say things like,

66
0:03:03.632,000 --> 0:03:05,000
"It makes me so mad when people drive this slow,"

67
0:03:06.022,000 --> 0:03:1,000
or, "I got mad because she left the milk out again."

68
0:03:10.091,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Or my favorite,

69
0:03:11.272,000 --> 0:03:14,000
"I don't have an anger problem -- people just need to stop messing with me."

70
0:03:14.942,000 --> 0:03:15,000
(Laughter)

71
0:03:16.527,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Now, in the spirit of better understanding those types of provocations,

72
0:03:20.736,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I ask a lot of people, including my friends and colleagues and even family,

73
0:03:25.022,000 --> 0:03:27,000
"What are the things that really get to you?

74
0:03:27.173,000 --> 0:03:28,000
What makes you mad?"

75
0:03:28.538,000 --> 0:03:31,000
By the way, now is a good time to point out one of the advantages

76
0:03:31.649,000 --> 0:03:32,000
of being an anger researcher

77
0:03:33.022,000 --> 0:03:36,000
is that I've spent more than a decade generating a comprehensive list

78
0:03:36.323,000 --> 0:03:39,000
of all the things that really irritate my colleagues.

79
0:03:39.507,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Just in case I need it.

80
0:03:40.911,000 --> 0:03:43,000
(Laughter)

81
0:03:44.919,000 --> 0:03:46,000
But their answers are fascinating,

82
0:03:47.102,000 --> 0:03:49,000
because they say things like,

83
0:03:49.561,000 --> 0:03:5,000
"when my sports team loses,"

84
0:03:51.561,000 --> 0:03:53,000
"people who chew too loudly."

85
0:03:53.982,000 --> 0:03:55,000
That is surprisingly common, by the way.

86
0:03:56.434,000 --> 0:03:59,000
"People who walk too slowly," that one's mine.

87
0:03:59.974,000 --> 0:04:,000
And of course, "roundabouts."

88
0:04:01.973,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Roundabouts --

89
0:04:03.173,000 --> 0:04:04,000
(Laughter)

90
0:04:05.188,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I can tell you honestly, there is no rage like roundabout rage.

91
0:04:08.323,000 --> 0:04:1,000
(Laughter)

92
0:04:11.219,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Sometimes their answers aren't minor at all.

93
0:04:13.324,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Sometimes they talk about racism and sexism and bullying

94
0:04:16.856,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and environmental destruction -- big, global problems we all face.

95
0:04:21.839,000 --> 0:04:22,000
But sometimes,

96
0:04:23.077,000 --> 0:04:26,000
their answers are very specific, maybe even oddly specific.

97
0:04:26.815,000 --> 0:04:28,000
"That wet line you get across your shirt

98
0:04:28.974,000 --> 0:04:31,000
when you accidentally lean against the counter of a public bathroom."

99
0:04:32.346,000 --> 0:04:33,000
(Laughter)

100
0:04:33.894,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Super gross, right?

101
0:04:35.529,000 --> 0:04:36,000
(Laughter)

102
0:04:37.061,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Or "Flash drives: there's only two ways to plug them in,

103
0:04:40.512,000 --> 0:04:42,000
so why does it always take me three tries?"

104
0:04:42.726,000 --> 0:04:46,000
(Laughter)

105
0:04:47.233,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Now whether it's minor or major, whether it's general or specific,

106
0:04:50.962,000 --> 0:04:51,000
we can look at these examples

107
0:04:52.617,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and we can tease out some common themes.

108
0:04:55.272,000 --> 0:04:57,000
We get angry in situations that are unpleasant,

109
0:04:58.137,000 --> 0:05:,000
that feel unfair, where our goals are blocked,

110
0:05:00.827,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that could have been avoided, and that leave us feeling powerless.

111
0:05:03.965,000 --> 0:05:04,000
This is a recipe for anger.

112
0:05:06.1,000 --> 0:05:07,000
But you can also tell

113
0:05:07.512,000 --> 0:05:1,000
that anger is probably not the only thing we're feeling in these situations.

114
0:05:11.385,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Anger doesn't happen in a vacuum.

115
0:05:13.038,000 --> 0:05:16,000
We can feel angry at the same time that we're scared or sad,

116
0:05:16.498,000 --> 0:05:18,000
or feeling a host of other emotions.

117
0:05:19.053,000 --> 0:05:2,000
But here's the thing:

118
0:05:20.53,000 --> 0:05:23,000
these provocations -- they aren't making us mad.

119
0:05:23.752,000 --> 0:05:24,000
At least not on their own,

120
0:05:25.086,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and we know that, because if they were,

121
0:05:26.973,000 --> 0:05:29,000
we'd all get angry over the same things, and we don't.

122
0:05:30.077,000 --> 0:05:33,000
The reasons I get angry are different than the reasons you get angry,

123
0:05:33.379,000 --> 0:05:35,000
so there's got to be something else going on.

124
0:05:35.521,000 --> 0:05:36,000
What is that something else?

125
0:05:37.038,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Well, we know what we're doing and feeling at the moment of that provocation matters.

126
0:05:42.331,000 --> 0:05:45,000
We call this the pre-anger state -- are you hungry, are you tired,

127
0:05:46.085,000 --> 0:05:49,000
are you anxious about something else, are you running late for something?

128
0:05:49.569,000 --> 0:05:5,000
When you're feeling those things,

129
0:05:51.442,000 --> 0:05:53,000
those provocations feel that much worse.

130
0:05:54.752,000 --> 0:05:56,000
But what matters most is not the provocation,

131
0:05:57.149,000 --> 0:05:59,000
it's not the pre-anger state, it's this:

132
0:05:59.744,000 --> 0:06:,000
it's how we interpret that provocation,

133
0:06:01.641,000 --> 0:06:03,000
it's how we make sense of it in our lives.

134
0:06:04.394,000 --> 0:06:05,000
When something happens to us,

135
0:06:05.823,000 --> 0:06:08,000
we first decide, is this good or bad?

136
0:06:08.927,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Is it fair or unfair, is it blameworthy, is it punishable?

137
0:06:12.99,000 --> 0:06:15,000
That's primary appraisal, it's when you evaluate the event itself.

138
0:06:16.832,000 --> 0:06:18,000
We decide what it means in the context of our lives

139
0:06:19.269,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and once we've done that, we decide how bad it is.

140
0:06:21.649,000 --> 0:06:22,000
That's secondary appraisal.

141
0:06:23.919,000 --> 0:06:25,000
We say, "Is this the worst thing that's ever happened,

142
0:06:26.488,000 --> 0:06:27,000
or can I cope with this?

143
0:06:28.815,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Now, to illustrate that, I want you to imagine you are driving somewhere.

144
0:06:33.052,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And before I go any further, I should tell you,

145
0:06:35.386,000 --> 0:06:36,000
if I were an evil genius

146
0:06:37.306,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and I wanted to create a situation that was going to make you mad,

147
0:06:40.902,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that situation would look a lot like driving.

148
0:06:43.364,000 --> 0:06:43,000
(Laughter)

149
0:06:44.383,000 --> 0:06:45,000
It's true.

150
0:06:45.565,000 --> 0:06:47,000
You are, by definition, on your way somewhere,

151
0:06:47.756,000 --> 0:06:51,000
so everything that happens -- traffic, other drivers, road construction --

152
0:06:52.357,000 --> 0:06:54,000
it feels like it's blocking your goals.

153
0:06:54.529,000 --> 0:06:57,000
There are all these written and unwritten rules of the road,

154
0:06:57.744,000 --> 0:07:,000
and those rules are routinely violated right in front of you,

155
0:07:01.022,000 --> 0:07:02,000
usually without consequence.

156
0:07:02.561,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And who's violating those rules?

157
0:07:04.331,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Anonymous others, people you will never see again,

158
0:07:06.95,000 --> 0:07:09,000
making them a very easy target for your wrath.

159
0:07:10.109,000 --> 0:07:11,000
(Laughter)

160
0:07:11.911,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So you're driving somewhere, thus teed up to be angry,

161
0:07:15.631,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and the person in front of you is driving well below the speed limit.

162
0:07:20.118,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And it's frustrating

163
0:07:21.365,000 --> 0:07:23,000
because you can't really see why they're driving so slow.

164
0:07:24.34,000 --> 0:07:25,000
That's primary appraisal.

165
0:07:25.682,000 --> 0:07:28,000
You've looked at this and you've said it's bad and it's blameworthy.

166
0:07:28.966,000 --> 0:07:3,000
But maybe you also decide it's not that big a deal.

167
0:07:31.591,000 --> 0:07:33,000
You're not in a hurry, doesn't matter.

168
0:07:33.908,000 --> 0:07:35,000
That's secondary appraisal -- you don't get angry.

169
0:07:37.218,000 --> 0:07:4,000
But now imagine you're on your way to a job interview.

170
0:07:41.72,000 --> 0:07:43,000
What that person is doing, it hasn't changed, right?

171
0:07:44.228,000 --> 0:07:47,000
So primary appraisal doesn't change; still bad, still blameworthy.

172
0:07:48.315,000 --> 0:07:5,000
But your ability to cope with it sure does.

173
0:07:51.18,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Because all of a sudden,

174
0:07:52.593,000 --> 0:07:54,000
you're going to be late to that job interview.

175
0:07:54.784,000 --> 0:07:55,000
All of a sudden,

176
0:07:55.959,000 --> 0:07:56,000
you are not going to get your dream job,

177
0:07:57.893,000 --> 0:07:59,000
the one that was going to give you piles and piles of money.

178
0:08:00.87,000 --> 0:08:01,000
(Laughter)

179
0:08:01.895,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Somebody else is going to get your dream job

180
0:08:04.252,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and you're going to be broke.

181
0:08:05.926,000 --> 0:08:06,000
You're going to be destitute.

182
0:08:07.68,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Might as well stop now, turn around, move in with your parents.

183
0:08:10.657,000 --> 0:08:12,000
(Laughter)

184
0:08:12.839,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Why?

185
0:08:14.027,000 --> 0:08:15,000
"Because of this person in front of me.

186
0:08:15.925,000 --> 0:08:16,000
This is not a person, this is a monster."

187
0:08:17.942,000 --> 0:08:18,000
(Laughter)

188
0:08:18.966,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And this monster is here just to ruin your life.

189
0:08:22.504,000 --> 0:08:23,000
(Laughter)

190
0:08:23.918,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Now that thought process,

191
0:08:25.791,000 --> 0:08:29,000
it's called catastrophizing, the one where we make the worst of things.

192
0:08:30.521,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And it's one of the primary types of thoughts that we know

193
0:08:33.276,000 --> 0:08:34,000
is associated with chronic anger.

194
0:08:34.965,000 --> 0:08:36,000
But there's a couple of others.

195
0:08:37.061,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Misattributing causation.

196
0:08:38.649,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Angry people tend to put blame where it doesn't belong.

197
0:08:41.45,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Not just on people,

198
0:08:43.356,000 --> 0:08:44,000
but actually inanimate objects as well.

199
0:08:45.268,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And if you think that sound ridiculous,

200
0:08:47.181,000 --> 0:08:49,000
think about the last time you lost your car keys and you said,

201
0:08:50.134,000 --> 0:08:51,000
"Where did those car keys go?"

202
0:08:51.609,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Because you know they ran off on their own.

203
0:08:53.657,000 --> 0:08:55,000
(Laughter)

204
0:08:56.591,000 --> 0:08:58,000
They tend to overgeneralize, they use words like "always,"

205
0:08:59.48,000 --> 0:09:01,000
"never," "every," "this always happens to me,"

206
0:09:02.17,000 --> 0:09:03,000
"I never get what I want"

207
0:09:03.575,000 --> 0:09:05,000
or "I hit every stoplight on the way here today."

208
0:09:06.879,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Demandingness: they put their own needs ahead of the needs of others:

209
0:09:10.173,000 --> 0:09:12,000
"I don't care why this person is driving so slow,

210
0:09:12.498,000 --> 0:09:15,000
they need to speed up or move over so I can get to this job interview."

211
0:09:16.425,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And finally, inflammatory labeling.

212
0:09:19.275,000 --> 0:09:21,000
They call people fools, idiots, monsters,

213
0:09:22.171,000 --> 0:09:25,000
or a whole bunch of things I've been told I'm not allowed to say

214
0:09:25.243,000 --> 0:09:26,000
during this TED Talk.

215
0:09:26.434,000 --> 0:09:27,000
(Laughter)

216
0:09:27.879,000 --> 0:09:28,000
So for a long time,

217
0:09:29.173,000 --> 0:09:32,000
psychologists have referred to these as cognitive distortions

218
0:09:32.653,000 --> 0:09:33,000
or even irrational beliefs.

219
0:09:34.231,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And yeah, sometimes they are irrational.

220
0:09:37.462,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Maybe even most of the time.

221
0:09:39.208,000 --> 0:09:41,000
But sometimes, these thoughts are totally rational.

222
0:09:42.649,000 --> 0:09:43,000
There is unfairness in the world.

223
0:09:44.403,000 --> 0:09:45,000
There are cruel, selfish people,

224
0:09:46.139,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and it's not only OK to be angry when we're treated poorly,

225
0:09:50.021,000 --> 0:09:53,000
it's right to be angry when we're treated poorly.

226
0:09:53.846,000 --> 0:09:57,000
If there's one thing I want you to remember from my talk today, it's this:

227
0:09:57.871,000 --> 0:10:,000
your anger exists in you as an emotion

228
0:10:01.641,000 --> 0:10:05,000
because it offered your ancestors, both human and nonhuman,

229
0:10:06.323,000 --> 0:10:08,000
with an evolutionary advantage.

230
0:10:08.857,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Just as your fear alerts you to danger,

231
0:10:11.966,000 --> 0:10:13,000
your anger alerts you to injustice.

232
0:10:14.146,000 --> 0:10:16,000
It's one of the ways your brain communicates to you

233
0:10:16.728,000 --> 0:10:17,000
that you have had enough.

234
0:10:19.022,000 --> 0:10:22,000
What's more, it energizes you to confront that injustice.

235
0:10:22.44,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Think for a second about the last time you got mad.

236
0:10:25.67,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Your heart rate increased.

237
0:10:27.432,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Your breathing increased, you started to sweat.

238
0:10:30.297,000 --> 0:10:31,000
That's your sympathetic nervous system,

239
0:10:32.185,000 --> 0:10:35,000
otherwise known as your fight-or-flight system,

240
0:10:35.387,000 --> 0:10:38,000
kicking in to offer you the energy you need to respond.

241
0:10:39.758,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And that's just the stuff you noticed.

242
0:10:41.608,000 --> 0:10:45,000
At the same time, your digestive system slowed down so you could conserve energy.

243
0:10:46.123,000 --> 0:10:47,000
That's why your mouth went dry.

244
0:10:48.021,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And your blood vessels dilated to get blood to your extremities.

245
0:10:52.089,000 --> 0:10:53,000
That's why your face went red.

246
0:10:53.566,000 --> 0:10:56,000
It's all part of this complex pattern of physiological experiences

247
0:10:57.129,000 --> 0:10:58,000
that exist today

248
0:10:58.391,000 --> 0:11:,000
because they helped your ancestors

249
0:11:01.173,000 --> 0:11:04,000
deal with cruel and unforgiving forces of nature.

250
0:11:04.976,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And the problem is that the thing your ancestors did

251
0:11:08.231,000 --> 0:11:09,000
to deal with their anger,

252
0:11:09.528,000 --> 0:11:1,000
to physically fight,

253
0:11:10.88,000 --> 0:11:12,000
they are no longer reasonable or appropriate.

254
0:11:13.061,000 --> 0:11:16,000
You can't and you shouldn't swing a club every time you're provoked.

255
0:11:16.864,000 --> 0:11:18,000
(Laughter)

256
0:11:19.728,000 --> 0:11:2,000
But here's the good news.

257
0:11:21.49,000 --> 0:11:22,000
You are capable of something

258
0:11:22.938,000 --> 0:11:24,000
your nonhuman ancestors weren't capable of.

259
0:11:25.419,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And that is the capacity to regulate your emotions.

260
0:11:29.174,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Even when you want to lash out,

261
0:11:30.992,000 --> 0:11:32,000
you can stop yourself and you can channel that anger

262
0:11:33.698,000 --> 0:11:35,000
into something more productive.

263
0:11:36.119,000 --> 0:11:37,000
So often when we talk about anger,

264
0:11:37.942,000 --> 0:11:39,000
we talk about how to keep from getting angry.

265
0:11:40.633,000 --> 0:11:42,000
We tell people to calm down or relax.

266
0:11:43.188,000 --> 0:11:45,000
We even tell people to let it go.

267
0:11:45.49,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And all of that assumes that anger is bad and that it's wrong to feel it.

268
0:11:50.712,000 --> 0:11:52,000
But instead, I like to think of anger as a motivator.

269
0:11:53.557,000 --> 0:11:56,000
The same way your thirst motivates you to get a drink of water,

270
0:11:56.708,000 --> 0:11:58,000
the same way your hunger motivates you to get a bite to eat,

271
0:11:59.684,000 --> 0:12:02,000
your anger can motivate you to respond to injustice.

272
0:12:03.609,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Because we don't have to think too hard to find things we should be mad about.

273
0:12:08.085,000 --> 0:12:09,000
When we go back to the beginning,

274
0:12:09.721,000 --> 0:12:12,000
yeah, some of those things, they're silly and not worth getting angry over.

275
0:12:13.715,000 --> 0:12:16,000
But racism, sexism, bullying, environmental destruction,

276
0:12:16.946,000 --> 0:12:18,000
those things are real, those things are terrible,

277
0:12:19.272,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and the only way to fix them is to get mad first

278
0:12:22.522,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and then channel that anger into fighting back.

279
0:12:26.053,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And you don't have to fight back with aggression or hostility or violence.

280
0:12:30.307,000 --> 0:12:33,000
There are infinite ways that you can express your anger.

281
0:12:33.458,000 --> 0:12:35,000
You can protest, you can write letters to the editor,

282
0:12:36.403,000 --> 0:12:38,000
you can donate to and volunteer for causes,

283
0:12:38.97,000 --> 0:12:4,000
you can create art, you can create literature,

284
0:12:41.763,000 --> 0:12:42,000
you can create poetry and music,

285
0:12:43.748,000 --> 0:12:45,000
you can create a community that cares for one another

286
0:12:46.271,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and does not allow those atrocities to happen.

287
0:12:49.331,000 --> 0:12:51,000
So the next time you feel yourself getting angry,

288
0:12:52.236,000 --> 0:12:54,000
instead of trying to turn it off,

289
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
I hope you'll listen to what that anger is telling you.

290
0:12:56.929,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And then I hope you'll channel it into something positive and productive.

291
0:13:00.785,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Thank you.

292
0:13:01.96,000 --> 0:13:04,000
(Applause)

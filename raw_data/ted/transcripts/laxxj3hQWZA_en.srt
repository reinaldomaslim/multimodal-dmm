1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
As a particle physicist, I study the elementary particles

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and how they interact on the most fundamental level.

3
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
For most of my research career, I've been using accelerators,

4
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
such as the electron accelerator at Stanford University, just up the road,

5
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
to study things on the smallest scale.

6
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
But more recently, I've been turning my attention

7
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
to the universe on the largest scale.

8
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Because, as I'll explain to you,

9
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
the questions on the smallest and the largest scale are actually very connected.

10
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So I'm going to tell you about our twenty-first-century view of the universe,

11
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
what it's made of and what the big questions in the physical sciences are --

12
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
at least some of the big questions.

13
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So, recently, we have realized

14
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
that the ordinary matter in the universe --

15
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and by ordinary matter, I mean you, me,

16
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
the planets, the stars, the galaxies --

17
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
the ordinary matter makes up only a few percent

18
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
of the content of the universe.

19
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Almost a quarter, or approximately a quarter

20
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
of the matter in the universe, is stuff that's invisible.

21
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
By invisible, I mean it doesn't absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum.

22
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
It doesn't emit in the electromagnetic spectrum. It doesn't reflect.

23
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
It doesn't interact with the electromagnetic spectrum,

24
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
which is what we use to detect things.

25
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
It doesn't interact at all. So how do we know it's there?

26
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
We know it's there by its gravitational effects.

27
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
In fact, this dark matter dominates

28
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
the gravitational effects in the universe on a large scale,

29
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and I'll be telling you about the evidence for that.

30
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
What about the rest of the pie?

31
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
The rest of the pie is a very mysterious substance called dark energy.

32
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
More about that later, OK.

33
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So for now, let's turn to the evidence for dark matter.

34
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
In these galaxies, especially in a spiral galaxy like this,

35
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
most of the mass of the stars is concentrated in the middle of the galaxy.

36
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
This huge mass of all these stars keeps stars in circular orbits in the galaxy.

37
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So we have these stars going around in circles like this.

38
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
As you can imagine, even if you know physics, this should be intuitive, OK --

39
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that stars that are closer to the mass in the middle will be rotating at a higher speed

40
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
than those that are further out here, OK.

41
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
So what you would expect is that if you measured the orbital speed of the stars,

42
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
that they should be slower on the edges than on the inside.

43
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
In other words, if we measured speed as a function of distance --

44
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
this is the only time I'm going to show a graph, OK --

45
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
we would expect that it goes down as the distance increases

46
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
from the center of the galaxy.

47
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
When those measurements are made,

48
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant,

49
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
as a function of distance.

50
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
If it's constant, that means that the stars out here

51
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
are feeling the gravitational effects of matter that we do not see.

52
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
In fact, this galaxy and every other galaxy

53
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
appears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter.

54
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And this cloud of matter is much more spherical than the galaxy themselves,

55
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and it extends over a much wider range than the galaxy.

56
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So we see the galaxy and fixate on that, but it's actually a cloud of dark matter

57
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
that's dominating the structure and the dynamics of this galaxy.

58
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Galaxies themselves are not strewn randomly in space;

59
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
they tend to cluster.

60
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And this is an example of a very, actually, famous cluster, the Coma cluster.

61
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And there are thousands of galaxies in this cluster.

62
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
They're the white, fuzzy, elliptical things here.

63
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So these galaxy clusters -- we take a snapshot now,

64
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
we take a snapshot in a decade, it'll look identical.

65
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
But these galaxies are actually moving at extremely high speeds.

66
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
They're moving around in this gravitational potential well of this cluster, OK.

67
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So all of these galaxies are moving.

68
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
We can measure the speeds of these galaxies, their orbital velocities,

69
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and figure out how much mass is in this cluster.

70
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
And again, what we find is that there is much more mass there

71
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
than can be accounted for by the galaxies that we see.

72
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Or if we look in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum,

73
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
we see that there's a lot of gas in this cluster, as well.

74
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But that cannot account for the mass either.

75
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
In fact, there appears to be about ten times as much mass here

76
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
in the form of this invisible or dark matter

77
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
as there is in the ordinary matter, OK.

78
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
It would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly.

79
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I'm just putting this big, blue blob on there, OK,

80
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
to try to remind you that it's there.

81
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Can we see it more visually? Yes, we can.

82
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And so let me lead you through how we can do this.

83
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So here's an observer:

84
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
it could be an eye; it could be a telescope.

85
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And suppose there's a galaxy out here in the universe.

86
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
How do we see that galaxy?

87
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
A ray of light leaves the galaxy and travels through the universe

88
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
for perhaps billions of years

89
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
before it enters the telescope or your eye.

90
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Now, how do we deduce where the galaxy is?

91
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Well, we deduce it by the direction that the ray is traveling

92
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
as it enters our eye, right?

93
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
We say, the ray of light came this way;

94
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
the galaxy must be there, OK.

95
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Now, suppose I put in the middle a cluster of galaxies --

96
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and don't forget the dark matter, OK.

97
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Now, if we consider a different ray of light, one going off like this,

98
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
we now need to take into account

99
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
what Einstein predicted when he developed general relativity.

100
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And that was that the gravitational field, due to mass,

101
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
will deflect not only the trajectory of particles,

102
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
but will deflect light itself.

103
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So this light ray will not continue in a straight line,

104
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
but would rather bend and could end up going into our eye.

105
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Where will this observer see the galaxy?

106
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
You can respond. Up, right?

107
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
We extrapolate backwards and say the galaxy is up here.

108
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Is there any other ray of light

109
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that could make into the observer's eye from that galaxy?

110
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Yes, great. I see people going down like this.

111
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So a ray of light could go down, be bent

112
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
up into the observer's eye,

113
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and the observer sees a ray of light here.

114
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Now, take into account the fact that we live in

115
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
a three-dimensional universe, OK,

116
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
a three-dimensional space.

117
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Are there any other rays of light that could make it into the eye?

118
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Yes! The rays would lie on a -- I'd like to see -- yeah, on a cone.

119
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So there's a whole ray of light -- rays of light on a cone --

120
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
that will all be bent by that cluster

121
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and make it into the observer's eye.

122
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
If there is a cone of light coming into my eye, what do I see?

123
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
A circle, a ring. It's called an Einstein ring. Einstein predicted that, OK.

124
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Now, it will only be a perfect ring if the source, the deflector

125
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and the eyeball, in this case, are all in a perfectly straight line.

126
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
If they're slightly skewed, we'll see a different image.

127
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Now, you can do an experiment tonight over the reception, OK,

128
0:06:44.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
to figure out what that image will look like.

129
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Because it turns out that there is a kind of lens that we can devise,

130
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that has the right shape to produce this kind of effect.

131
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
We call this gravitational lensing.

132
0:06:56.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And so, this is your instrument, OK.

133
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
(Laughter).

134
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
But ignore the top part.

135
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
It's the base that I want you to concentrate, OK.

136
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So, actually, at home, whenever we break a wineglass,

137
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I save the bottom, take it over to the machine shop.

138
0:07:10.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We shave it off, and I have a little gravitational lens, OK.

139
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So it's got the right shape to produce the lensing.

140
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And so the next thing you need to do in your experiment

141
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
is grab a napkin. I grabbed a piece of graph paper -- I'm a physicist. (Laughter)

142
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
So, a napkin. Draw a little model galaxy in the middle.

143
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And now put the lens over the galaxy,

144
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and what you'll find is that you'll see a ring, an Einstein ring.

145
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Now, move the base off to the side,

146
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and the ring will split up into arcs, OK.

147
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And you can put it on top of any image.

148
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
On the graph paper, you can see

149
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
how all the lines on the graph paper have been distorted.

150
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And again, this is a kind of an accurate model

151
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
of what happens with the gravitational lensing.

152
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
OK, so the question is: do we see this in the sky?

153
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Do we see arcs in the sky when we look at, say, a cluster of galaxies?

154
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And the answer is yes.

155
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
And so, here's an image from the Hubble Space Telescope.

156
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Many of the images you are seeing

157
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
are earlier from the Hubble Space Telescope.

158
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Well, first of all, for the golden shape galaxies --

159
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
those are the galaxies in the cluster.

160
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
They're the ones that are embedded in that sea of dark matter

161
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
that are causing the bending of the light

162
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
to cause these optical illusions, or mirages, practically,

163
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
of the background galaxies.

164
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So the streaks that you see, all these streaks,

165
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
are actually distorted images of galaxies that are much further away.

166
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
So what we can do, then, is based on how much distortion

167
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
we see in those images, we can calculate how much mass

168
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
there must be in this cluster.

169
0:08:36.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And it's an enormous amount of mass.

170
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And also, you can tell by eye, by looking at this,

171
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that these arcs are not centered on individual galaxies.

172
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
They are centered on some more spread out structure,

173
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and that is the dark matter

174
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
in which the cluster is embedded, OK.

175
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing

176
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
at least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye.

177
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
OK, so, a quick review then, to see that you're following.

178
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:05,000
So the evidence that we have

179
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
that a quarter of the universe is dark matter --

180
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
this gravitationally attracting stuff --

181
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
is that galaxies, the speed with which stars orbiting galaxies

182
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
is much too large; it must be embedded in dark matter.

183
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
The speed with which galaxies within clusters are orbiting is much too large;

184
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
it must be embedded in dark matter.

185
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And we see these gravitational lensing effects, these distortions

186
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
that say that, again, clusters are embedded in dark matter.

187
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
OK. So now, let's turn to dark energy.

188
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
So to understand the evidence for dark energy, we need to discuss something

189
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
that Stephen Hawking referred to in the previous session.

190
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And that is the fact that space itself is expanding.

191
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So if we imagine a section of our infinite universe --

192
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and so I've put down four spiral galaxies, OK --

193
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and imagine that you put down a set of tape measures,

194
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
so every line on here corresponds to a tape measure,

195
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
horizontal or vertical, for measuring where things are.

196
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
If you could do this, what you would find

197
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
that with each passing day, each passing year,

198
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
each passing billions of years, OK,

199
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
the distance between galaxies is getting greater.

200
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And it's not because galaxies are moving

201
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:17,000
away from each other through space.

202
0:10:17.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
They're not necessarily moving through space.

203
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
They're moving away from each other

204
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
because space itself is getting bigger, OK.

205
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
That's what the expansion of the universe or space means.

206
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
So they're moving further apart.

207
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Now, what Stephen Hawking mentioned, as well,

208
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
is that after the Big Bang, space expanded at a very rapid rate.

209
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:44,000
But because gravitationally attracting matter

210
0:10:44.33,000 --> 0:10:46,000
is embedded in this space,

211
0:10:46.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
it tends to slow down the expansion of the space, OK.

212
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
So the expansion slows down with time.

213
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
So, in the last century, OK, people debated

214
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
about whether this expansion of space would continue forever;

215
0:11:01.33,000 --> 0:11:03,000
whether it would slow down, you know,

216
0:11:03.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
will be slowing down, but continue forever;

217
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
slow down and stop, asymptotically stop;

218
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
or slow down, stop, and then reverse, so it starts to contract again.

219
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
So a little over a decade ago,

220
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
two groups of physicists and astronomers

221
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
set out to measure the rate at which

222
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
the expansion of space was slowing down, OK.

223
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:3,000
By how much less is it expanding today,

224
0:11:30.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
compared to, say, a couple of billion years ago?

225
0:11:33.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
The startling answer to this question, OK, from these experiments,

226
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:42,000
was that space is expanding at a faster rate today

227
0:11:42.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
than it was a few billion years ago, OK.

228
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
So the expansion of space is actually speeding up.

229
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
This was a completely surprising result.

230
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
There is no persuasive theoretical argument for why this should happen, OK.

231
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
No one was predicting ahead of time this is what's going to be found.

232
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
It was the opposite of what was expected.

233
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
So we need something to be able to explain that.

234
0:12:05.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Now it turns out, in the mathematics,

235
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
you can put it in as a term that's an energy,

236
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
but it's a completely different type of energy

237
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
from anything we've ever seen before.

238
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
We call it dark energy,

239
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and it has this effect of causing space to expand.

240
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
But we don't have a good motivation

241
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:23,000
for putting it in there at this point, OK.

242
0:12:23.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
So it's really unexplained as to why we need to put it in.

243
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Now, so at this point, then, what I want to really emphasize to you,

244
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:32,000
is that, first of all, dark matter and dark energy

245
0:12:32.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
are completely different things, OK.

246
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
There are really two mysteries out there as to what makes up most of the universe,

247
0:12:38.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and they have very different effects.

248
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Dark matter, because it gravitationally attracts,

249
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
it tends to encourage the growth of structure, OK.

250
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:51,000
So clusters of galaxies will tend to form,

251
0:12:51.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
because of all this gravitational attraction.

252
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Dark energy, on the other hand,

253
0:12:55.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
is putting more and more space between the galaxies,

254
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:02,000
makes it, the gravitational attraction between them decrease,

255
0:13:02.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and so it impedes the growth of structure.

256
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:08,000
So by looking at things like clusters of galaxies,

257
0:13:08.33,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and how they -- their number density,

258
0:13:12.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
how many there are as a function of time --

259
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
we can learn about how dark matter and dark energy

260
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
compete against each other in structure forming.

261
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:24,000
In terms of dark matter, I said that we don't have any,

262
0:13:24.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
you know, really persuasive argument for dark energy.

263
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Do we have anything for dark matter? And the answer is yes.

264
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
We have well-motivated candidates for the dark matter.

265
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Now, what do I mean by well motivated?

266
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:42,000
I mean that we have mathematically consistent theories

267
0:13:42.33,000 --> 0:13:44,000
that were actually introduced

268
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
to explain a completely different phenomenon, OK,

269
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:49,000
things that I haven't even talked about,

270
0:13:49.33,000 --> 0:13:52,000
that each predict the existence

271
0:13:52.33,000 --> 0:13:55,000
of a very weakly interacting, new particle.

272
0:13:55.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
So, this is exactly what you want in physics:

273
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
where a prediction comes out of a mathematically consistent theory

274
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
that was actually developed for something else.

275
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
But we don't know if either of those

276
0:14:06.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
are actually the dark matter candidate, OK.

277
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
One or both, who knows? Or it could be something completely different.

278
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Now, we look for these dark matter particles

279
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
because, after all, they are here in the room, OK,

280
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and they didn't come in the door.

281
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:2,000
They just pass through anything.

282
0:14:20.33,000 --> 0:14:22,000
They can come through the building, through the Earth --

283
0:14:22.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
they're so non-interacting.

284
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
So one way to look for them is to build detectors

285
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
that are extremely sensitive to a dark matter particle coming through and bumping it.

286
0:14:31.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
So a crystal that will ring if that happens.

287
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
So one of my colleagues up the road and his collaborators

288
0:14:36.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
have built such a detector.

289
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And they've put it deep down in an iron mine in Minnesota,

290
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
OK, deep under the ground, and in fact, in the last couple of days

291
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:47,000
announced the most sensitive results so far.

292
0:14:47.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
They haven't seen anything, OK, but it puts limits on what the mass

293
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are.

294
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
There's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year

295
0:14:57.33,000 --> 0:15:,000
and it will look towards the middle of the galaxy,

296
0:15:00.33,000 --> 0:15:02,000
to see if we can see dark matter particles annihilating

297
0:15:02.33,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and producing gamma rays that could be detected with this.

298
0:15:06.33,000 --> 0:15:09,000
The Large Hadron Collider, a particle physics accelerator,

299
0:15:09.33,000 --> 0:15:12,000
that we'll be turning on later this year.

300
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:15,000
It is possible that dark matter particles might be produced

301
0:15:15.33,000 --> 0:15:17,000
at the Large Hadron Collider.

302
0:15:17.33,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Now, because they are so non-interactive,

303
0:15:18.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
they will actually escape the detector,

304
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:24,000
so their signature will be missing energy, OK.

305
0:15:24.33,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Now, unfortunately, there is a lot of new physics

306
0:15:27.33,000 --> 0:15:29,000
whose signature could be missing energy,

307
0:15:29.33,000 --> 0:15:31,000
so it will be hard to tell the difference.

308
0:15:31.33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And finally, for future endeavors, there are telescopes being designed

309
0:15:36.33,000 --> 0:15:4,000
specifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy --

310
0:15:40.33,000 --> 0:15:43,000
ground-based telescopes, and there are three space-based telescopes

311
0:15:43.33,000 --> 0:15:45,000
that are in competition right now

312
0:15:45.33,000 --> 0:15:48,000
to be launched to investigate dark matter and dark energy.

313
0:15:48.33,000 --> 0:15:5,000
So in terms of the big questions:

314
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
what is dark matter? What is dark energy?

315
0:15:52.33,000 --> 0:15:54,000
The big questions facing physics.

316
0:15:54.33,000 --> 0:15:57,000
And I'm sure you have lots of questions,

317
0:15:57.33,000 --> 0:15:59,000
which I very much look forward to addressing

318
0:15:59.33,000 --> 0:16:01,000
over the next 72 hours, while I'm here. Thank you.

319
0:16:01.33,000 --> 0:16:04,000

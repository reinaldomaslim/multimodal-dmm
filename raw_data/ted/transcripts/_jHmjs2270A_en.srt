1
0:00:12.719,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Take a look at this work of art.

2
0:00:16.178,000 --> 0:00:17,000
What is it that you see?

3
0:00:19.064,000 --> 0:00:22,000
At first glance, it looks to be a grandfather clock

4
0:00:22.739,000 --> 0:00:23,000
with a sheet thrown over it

5
0:00:24.506,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and a rope tied around the center.

6
0:00:27.657,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But a first look always warrants a second.

7
0:00:31.591,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Look again.

8
0:00:33.751,000 --> 0:00:34,000
What do you see now?

9
0:00:35.83,000 --> 0:00:36,000
If you look more closely,

10
0:00:37.767,000 --> 0:00:41,000
you'll realize that this entire work of art

11
0:00:41.941,000 --> 0:00:43,000
is made from one piece of sculpture.

12
0:00:44.845,000 --> 0:00:45,000
There is no clock,

13
0:00:46.462,000 --> 0:00:47,000
there is no rope,

14
0:00:48.026,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and there is no sheet.

15
0:00:50.022,000 --> 0:00:53,000
It is one piece of bleached Honduras mahogany.

16
0:00:54.969,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Now let me be clear:

17
0:00:56.683,000 --> 0:01:,000
this exercise was not about looking at sculpture.

18
0:01:02.509,000 --> 0:01:03,000
It's about looking

19
0:01:04.44,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and understanding that looking closely can save a life,

20
0:01:09.239,000 --> 0:01:1,000
change your company

21
0:01:10.733,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and even help you understand why your children behave the way they do.

22
0:01:15.574,000 --> 0:01:17,000
It's a skill that I call visual intelligence,

23
0:01:18.432,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and I use works of art to teach everybody,

24
0:01:21.035,000 --> 0:01:25,000
from everyday people to those for whom looking is the job,

25
0:01:25.748,000 --> 0:01:29,000
like Navy SEALs and homicide detectives and trauma nurses.

26
0:01:31.464,000 --> 0:01:34,000
The fact is that no matter how skilled you might be at looking,

27
0:01:35.294,000 --> 0:01:38,000
you still have so much to learn about seeing.

28
0:01:38.632,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Because we all think we get it in a first glance and a sudden flash,

29
0:01:43.085,000 --> 0:01:47,000
but the real skill is in understanding how to look slowly

30
0:01:47.6,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and how to look more carefully.

31
0:01:49.499,000 --> 0:01:51,000
The talent is in remembering --

32
0:01:51.895,000 --> 0:01:55,000
in the crush of the daily urgencies that demand our attention --

33
0:01:55.972,000 --> 0:01:59,000
to step back and look through those lenses to help us see

34
0:02:00.049,000 --> 0:02:01,000
what we've been missing all along.

35
0:02:03.026,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So how can looking at painting and sculpture help?

36
0:02:06.702,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Because art is a powerful tool.

37
0:02:10.187,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It's a powerful tool that engages both sight and insight

38
0:02:14.795,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and reframes our understanding of where we are and what we see.

39
0:02:20.535,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Here's an example of a work of art

40
0:02:23.6,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that reminded me that visual intelligence --

41
0:02:26.553,000 --> 0:02:27,000
it's an ongoing learning process

42
0:02:28.527,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and one that really is never mastered.

43
0:02:31.121,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I came across this quiet, seemingly abstract painting,

44
0:02:34.935,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and I had to step up to it twice,

45
0:02:37.262,000 --> 0:02:38,000
even three times,

46
0:02:38.502,000 --> 0:02:41,000
to understand why it resonated so deeply.

47
0:02:42.146,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Now, I've seen the Washington Monument in person thousands of times,

48
0:02:46.48,000 --> 0:02:49,000
well aware of the change in the color of marble a third of the way up,

49
0:02:50.478,000 --> 0:02:53,000
but I had never really looked at it out of context

50
0:02:53.702,000 --> 0:02:54,000
or truly as a work of art.

51
0:02:56.67,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And here, Georgia O'Keeffe's painting of this architectural icon made me realize

52
0:03:02.558,000 --> 0:03:04,000
that if we put our mind to it,

53
0:03:04.772,000 --> 0:03:07,000
it's possible to see everyday things

54
0:03:07.958,000 --> 0:03:09,000
in a wholly new and eye-opening perspective.

55
0:03:11.863,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Now, there are some skeptics that believe that art just belongs in an art museum.

56
0:03:17.849,000 --> 0:03:2,000
They believe that it has no practical use beyond its aesthetic value.

57
0:03:21.639,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I know who they are in every audience I teach.

58
0:03:24.204,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Their arms are crossed, their legs are crossed,

59
0:03:26.973,000 --> 0:03:27,000
their body language is saying,

60
0:03:28.649,000 --> 0:03:3,000
"What am I going to learn from this lady who talks fast

61
0:03:31.246,000 --> 0:03:32,000
about painting and sculpture?"

62
0:03:34.875,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So how do I make it relevant for them?

63
0:03:39.078,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I ask them to look at this work of art,

64
0:03:41.333,000 --> 0:03:43,000
like this portrait by Kumi Yamashita.

65
0:03:44.388,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And I ask them to step in close,

66
0:03:46.43,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and even closer still,

67
0:03:48.675,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and while they're looking at the work of art,

68
0:03:50.936,000 --> 0:03:52,000
they need to be asking questions about what they see.

69
0:03:54.341,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And if they ask the right questions,

70
0:03:56.107,000 --> 0:03:57,000
like, "What is this work of art?

71
0:03:57.749,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Is it a painting? Is it a sculpture?

72
0:03:59.548,000 --> 0:04:,000
What is it made of?" ...

73
0:04:00.722,000 --> 0:04:03,000
they will find out that this entire work of art

74
0:04:03.975,000 --> 0:04:04,000
is made of a wooden board,

75
0:04:05.743,000 --> 0:04:06,000
10,000 nails

76
0:04:07.396,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and one unbroken piece of sewing thread.

77
0:04:10.663,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Now that might be interesting to some of you,

78
0:04:12.865,000 --> 0:04:15,000
but what does it have to do with the work that these people do?

79
0:04:15.91,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And the answer is everything.

80
0:04:17.777,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Because we all interact with people multiple times on a daily basis,

81
0:04:22.085,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and we need to get better at asking questions

82
0:04:24.515,000 --> 0:04:25,000
about what it is that we see.

83
0:04:27.42,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Learning to frame the question in such a way

84
0:04:30.005,000 --> 0:04:33,000
as to elicit the information that we need to do our jobs,

85
0:04:33.08,000 --> 0:04:34,000
is a critical life skill.

86
0:04:35.664,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Like the radiologist who told me

87
0:04:37.974,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that looking at the negative spaces in a painting

88
0:04:40.498,000 --> 0:04:44,000
helped her discern more discreet abnormalities in an MRI.

89
0:04:45.072,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Or the police officer who said that understanding the emotional dynamic

90
0:04:50.261,000 --> 0:04:51,000
between people in a painting

91
0:04:51.843,000 --> 0:04:55,000
helped him to read body language at a domestic violence crime scene,

92
0:04:56.156,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and it enabled him to think twice before drawing and firing his weapon.

93
0:05:01.579,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And even parents can look to see absences of color in paintings

94
0:05:06.609,000 --> 0:05:09,000
to understand that what their children say to them

95
0:05:10.151,000 --> 0:05:12,000
is as important as what they don't say.

96
0:05:13.766,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So how do I --

97
0:05:16.472,000 --> 0:05:19,000
how do I train to be more visually intelligent?

98
0:05:20.384,000 --> 0:05:22,000
It comes down to four As.

99
0:05:22.685,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Every new situation, every new problem --

100
0:05:25.191,000 --> 0:05:26,000
we practice four As.

101
0:05:26.749,000 --> 0:05:27,000
First, we assess our situation.

102
0:05:28.262,000 --> 0:05:3,000
We ask, "What do we have in front of us?"

103
0:05:30.521,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Then, we analyze it.

104
0:05:32.083,000 --> 0:05:33,000
We say, "What's important?

105
0:05:33.432,000 --> 0:05:34,000
What do I need? What don't I need?"

106
0:05:35.188,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Then, we articulate it in a conversation, in a memo, in a text, in an email.

107
0:05:38.978,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And then, we act: we make a decision.

108
0:05:42.461,000 --> 0:05:44,000
We all do this multiple times a day,

109
0:05:44.843,000 --> 0:05:47,000
but we don't realize what a role seeing and looking plays

110
0:05:48.511,000 --> 0:05:49,000
in all of those actions,

111
0:05:50.114,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and how visual intelligence can really improve everything.

112
0:05:54.625,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So recently, I had a group of counterterrorism officials

113
0:05:57.315,000 --> 0:05:58,000
at a museum in front of this painting.

114
0:05:59.298,000 --> 0:06:02,000
El Greco's painting, "The Purification of the Temple,"

115
0:06:02.752,000 --> 0:06:06,000
in which Christ, in the center, in a sweeping and violent gesture,

116
0:06:06.863,000 --> 0:06:08,000
is expelling the sinners from the temple of prayer.

117
0:06:10.321,000 --> 0:06:13,000
The group of counterterrorism officials had five minutes with that painting,

118
0:06:13.956,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and in that short amount of time, they had to assess the situation,

119
0:06:17.892,000 --> 0:06:18,000
analyze the details,

120
0:06:19.606,000 --> 0:06:2,000
articulate what, if anything,

121
0:06:21.322,000 --> 0:06:23,000
they would do if they were in that painting.

122
0:06:25.329,000 --> 0:06:28,000
As you can imagine, observations and insights differed.

123
0:06:28.753,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Who would they talk to?

124
0:06:29.928,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Who would be the best witness?

125
0:06:31.458,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Who was a good potential witness?

126
0:06:33.068,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Who was lurking?

127
0:06:34.243,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Who had the most information?

128
0:06:36.131,000 --> 0:06:39,000
But my favorite comment came from a seasoned cop

129
0:06:39.627,000 --> 0:06:41,000
who looked at the central figure and said,

130
0:06:41.766,000 --> 0:06:42,000
"You see that guy in the pink?" --

131
0:06:43.425,000 --> 0:06:44,000
referring to Christ --

132
0:06:44.679,000 --> 0:06:46,000
he said, "I'd collar him, he's causing all the trouble."

133
0:06:47.345,000 --> 0:06:5,000
(Laughter)

134
0:06:50.497,000 --> 0:06:55,000
So looking at art gives us a perfect vehicle to rethink how we solve problems

135
0:06:55.918,000 --> 0:06:56,000
without the aid of technology.

136
0:06:57.584,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Looking at the work of Felix Gonzalez-Torres,

137
0:07:00.291,000 --> 0:07:03,000
you see two clocks in perfect synchronicity.

138
0:07:03.949,000 --> 0:07:07,000
The hour, minute and second hand perfectly aligned.

139
0:07:07.99,000 --> 0:07:1,000
They are installed side by side and they're touching,

140
0:07:11.316,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and they are entitled "'Untitled' (Perfect Lovers)."

141
0:07:15.431,000 --> 0:07:17,000
But closer analysis makes you realize

142
0:07:17.567,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that these are two battery-operated clocks,

143
0:07:20.74,000 --> 0:07:21,000
which in turn makes you understand --

144
0:07:22.599,000 --> 0:07:23,000
"Hey, wait a minute ...

145
0:07:23.865,000 --> 0:07:25,000
One of those batteries is going to stop before the other.

146
0:07:26.592,000 --> 0:07:29,000
One of those clocks is going to slow down and die before the other

147
0:07:29.772,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and it's going to alter the symmetry of the artwork."

148
0:07:33.073,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Just articulating that thought process

149
0:07:36.205,000 --> 0:07:39,000
includes the necessity of a contingency plan.

150
0:07:40.687,000 --> 0:07:42,000
You need to have contingencies for the unforeseen,

151
0:07:43.391,000 --> 0:07:45,000
the unexpected and the unknown,

152
0:07:45.891,000 --> 0:07:47,000
whenever and however they may happen.

153
0:07:50.15,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Now, using art to increase our visual intelligence

154
0:07:53.771,000 --> 0:07:55,000
involves planning for contingencies,

155
0:07:55.856,000 --> 0:07:57,000
understanding the big picture and the small details

156
0:07:58.278,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and noticing what's not there.

157
0:08:00.399,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So in this painting by Magritte,

158
0:08:02.877,000 --> 0:08:05,000
noticing that there are no tracks under the train,

159
0:08:06.051,000 --> 0:08:08,000
there is no fire in the fireplace

160
0:08:08.239,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and there are no candles in the candlesticks

161
0:08:10.441,000 --> 0:08:12,000
actually more accurately describes the painting

162
0:08:13.282,000 --> 0:08:16,000
than if you were to say, "Well, there's a train coming out of a fireplace,

163
0:08:16.821,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and there are candlesticks on the mantle."

164
0:08:18.931,000 --> 0:08:2,000
It may sound counterintuitive to say what isn't there,

165
0:08:21.618,000 --> 0:08:23,000
but it's really a very valuable tool.

166
0:08:24.398,000 --> 0:08:26,000
When a detective who had learned about visual intelligence

167
0:08:27.182,000 --> 0:08:28,000
in North Carolina

168
0:08:28.357,000 --> 0:08:29,000
was called to the crime scene,

169
0:08:29.857,000 --> 0:08:3,000
it was a boating fatality,

170
0:08:31.321,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and the eyewitness told this detective that the boat had flipped over

171
0:08:34.905,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and the occupant had drowned underneath.

172
0:08:38.055,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Now, instinctively, crime scene investigators look for what is apparent,

173
0:08:41.729,000 --> 0:08:43,000
but this detective did something different.

174
0:08:43.953,000 --> 0:08:45,000
He looked for what wasn't there, which is harder to do.

175
0:08:47.045,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And he raised the question:

176
0:08:48.384,000 --> 0:08:5,000
if the boat had really tipped flipped over --

177
0:08:51.32,000 --> 0:08:53,000
as the eyewitness said that it did --

178
0:08:53.562,000 --> 0:08:55,000
how come the papers that were kept at one end of the boat

179
0:08:56.341,000 --> 0:08:57,000
were completely dry?

180
0:08:58.9,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Based on that one small but critical observation,

181
0:09:02.312,000 --> 0:09:05,000
the investigation shifted from accidental death to homicide.

182
0:09:08.257,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Now, equally important to saying what isn't there

183
0:09:10.921,000 --> 0:09:14,000
is the ability to find visual connections where they may not be apparent.

184
0:09:16.442,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Like Marie Watt's totem pole of blankets.

185
0:09:19.518,000 --> 0:09:23,000
It illustrates that finding hidden connections in everyday objects

186
0:09:23.626,000 --> 0:09:24,000
can resonate so deeply.

187
0:09:25.796,000 --> 0:09:27,000
The artist collected blankets from all different people

188
0:09:28.501,000 --> 0:09:29,000
in her community,

189
0:09:29.993,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and she had the owners of the blankets write, on a tag,

190
0:09:33.271,000 --> 0:09:35,000
the significance of the blanket to the family.

191
0:09:36.448,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Some of the blankets had been used for baby blankets,

192
0:09:39.137,000 --> 0:09:41,000
some of them had been used as picnic blankets,

193
0:09:41.361,000 --> 0:09:43,000
some of them had been used for the dog.

194
0:09:44.386,000 --> 0:09:46,000
We all have blankets in our homes

195
0:09:47.216,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and understand the significance that they play.

196
0:09:50.704,000 --> 0:09:52,000
But similarly, I instruct new doctors:

197
0:09:53.069,000 --> 0:09:54,000
when they walk into a patient's room,

198
0:09:54.989,000 --> 0:09:57,000
before they pick up that medical chart,

199
0:09:58.205,000 --> 0:09:59,000
just look around the room.

200
0:10:00.031,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Are there balloons or cards,

201
0:10:02.35,000 --> 0:10:04,000
or that special blanket on the bed?

202
0:10:05.471,000 --> 0:10:08,000
That tells the doctor there's a connection to the outside world.

203
0:10:09.195,000 --> 0:10:12,000
If that patient has someone in the outside world

204
0:10:12.916,000 --> 0:10:13,000
to assist them and help them,

205
0:10:14.853,000 --> 0:10:18,000
the doctor can implement the best care with that connection in mind.

206
0:10:20.075,000 --> 0:10:23,000
In medicine, people are connected as humans

207
0:10:23.285,000 --> 0:10:26,000
before they're identified as doctor and patient.

208
0:10:27.699,000 --> 0:10:29,000
But this method of enhancing perception --

209
0:10:30.278,000 --> 0:10:31,000
it need not be disruptive,

210
0:10:31.78,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and it doesn't necessitate an overhaul in looking.

211
0:10:35.173,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Like Jorge Méndez Blake's sculpture of building a brick wall

212
0:10:39.166,000 --> 0:10:41,000
above Kafka's book "El Castillo"

213
0:10:42.024,000 --> 0:10:46,000
shows that more astute observation can be subtle and yet invaluable.

214
0:10:47.835,000 --> 0:10:48,000
You can discern the book,

215
0:10:49.637,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and you can see how it disrupted the symmetry

216
0:10:51.987,000 --> 0:10:53,000
of the bricks directly above it,

217
0:10:54.362,000 --> 0:10:56,000
but by the time you get to the end of the sculpture,

218
0:10:56.862,000 --> 0:10:57,000
you can no longer see the book.

219
0:10:59.108,000 --> 0:11:02,000
But looking at the work of art in its entirety,

220
0:11:02.252,000 --> 0:11:06,000
you see that the impact of the work's disruption on the bricks

221
0:11:06.556,000 --> 0:11:08,000
is nuanced and unmistakable.

222
0:11:09.529,000 --> 0:11:1,000
One thought,

223
0:11:10.95,000 --> 0:11:11,000
one idea,

224
0:11:12.636,000 --> 0:11:15,000
one innovation can alter an approach,

225
0:11:16.322,000 --> 0:11:17,000
change a process

226
0:11:17.876,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and even save lives.

227
0:11:20.599,000 --> 0:11:23,000
I've been teaching visual intelligence for over 15 years,

228
0:11:24.376,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and to my great amazement and astonishment --

229
0:11:27.616,000 --> 0:11:29,000
to my never-ending astonishment and amazement,

230
0:11:30.416,000 --> 0:11:33,000
I have seen that looking at art with a critical eye

231
0:11:33.968,000 --> 0:11:36,000
can help to anchor us in our world of uncharted waters,

232
0:11:37.404,000 --> 0:11:39,000
whether you are a paramilitary trooper,

233
0:11:39.667,000 --> 0:11:41,000
a caregiver, a doctor or a mother.

234
0:11:43.156,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Because let's face it, things go wrong.

235
0:11:46.678,000 --> 0:11:47,000
(Laughter)

236
0:11:47.703,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Things go wrong.

237
0:11:48.937,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And don't misunderstand me,

238
0:11:50.308,000 --> 0:11:51,000
I'd eat that doughnut in a minute.

239
0:11:51.979,000 --> 0:11:52,000
(Laughter)

240
0:11:53.061,000 --> 0:11:57,000
But we need to understand the consequences of what it is that we observe,

241
0:11:57.73,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and we need to convert observable details into actionable knowledge.

242
0:12:02.918,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Like Jennifer Odem's sculpture of tables standing sentinel

243
0:12:06.937,000 --> 0:12:08,000
on the banks of the Mississippi River

244
0:12:09.013,000 --> 0:12:1,000
in New Orleans,

245
0:12:10.455,000 --> 0:12:13,000
guarding against the threat of post-Katrina floodwaters

246
0:12:13.694,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and rising up against adversity,

247
0:12:16.503,000 --> 0:12:18,000
we too have the ability to act affirmatively

248
0:12:19.376,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and affect positive change.

249
0:12:21.923,000 --> 0:12:23,000
I have been mining the world of art

250
0:12:24.245,000 --> 0:12:27,000
to help people across the professional spectrum

251
0:12:27.322,000 --> 0:12:29,000
to see the extraordinary in the everyday,

252
0:12:30.03,000 --> 0:12:32,000
to articulate what is absent

253
0:12:33.727,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and to be able to inspire creativity and innovation,

254
0:12:37.144,000 --> 0:12:38,000
no matter how small.

255
0:12:38.629,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And most importantly,

256
0:12:40.212,000 --> 0:12:43,000
to forge human connections where they may not be apparent,

257
0:12:44.036,000 --> 0:12:48,000
empowering us all to see our work and the world writ large

258
0:12:48.933,000 --> 0:12:49,000
with a new set of eyes.

259
0:12:50.879,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Thank you.

260
0:12:52.054,000 --> 0:12:58,000
(Applause)

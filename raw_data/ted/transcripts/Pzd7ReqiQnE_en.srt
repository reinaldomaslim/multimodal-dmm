1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm a savant,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
or more precisely,

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
a high-functioning

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
autistic savant.

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
It's a rare condition.

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And rarer still when accompanied,

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
as in my case,

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
by self-awareness

9
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and a mastery of language.

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Very often when I meet someone

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and they learn this about me,

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
there's a certain kind of awkwardness.

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I can see it in their eyes.

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
They want to ask me something.

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And in the end, quite often,

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
the urge is stronger than they are

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and they blurt it out:

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
"If I give you my date of birth,

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
can you tell me what day of the week I was born on?"

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Or they mention cube roots

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
or ask me to recite a long number or long text.

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I hope you'll forgive me

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
if I don't perform

25
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
a kind of one-man savant show for you today.

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I'm going to talk instead

27
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
about something

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
far more interesting

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
than dates of birth or cube roots --

30
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
a little deeper

31
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and a lot closer, to my mind, than work.

32
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I want to talk to you briefly

33
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
about perception.

34
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
When he was writing the plays and the short stories

35
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
that would make his name,

36
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Anton Chekhov kept a notebook

37
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
in which he noted down

38
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
his observations

39
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
of the world around him --

40
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
little details

41
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that other people seem to miss.

42
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Every time I read Chekhov

43
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and his unique vision of human life,

44
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I'm reminded of why I too

45
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
became a writer.

46
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
In my books,

47
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I explore the nature of perception

48
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and how different kinds of perceiving

49
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
create different kinds of knowing

50
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and understanding.

51
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Here are three questions

52
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
drawn from my work.

53
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Rather than try to figure them out,

54
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I'm going to ask you to consider for a moment

55
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
the intuitions

56
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and the gut instincts

57
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
that are going through your head and your heart

58
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
as you look at them.

59
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
For example, the calculation:

60
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
can you feel where on the number line

61
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
the solution is likely to fall?

62
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Or look at the foreign word and the sounds:

63
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
can you get a sense of the range of meanings

64
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
that it's pointing you towards?

65
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
And in terms of the line of poetry,

66
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
why does the poet use the word hare

67
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
rather than rabbit?

68
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I'm asking you to do this

69
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
because I believe our personal perceptions, you see,

70
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
are at the heart

71
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
of how we acquire knowledge.

72
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Aesthetic judgments,

73
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
rather than abstract reasoning,

74
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
guide and shape the process

75
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
by which we all come to know

76
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
what we know.

77
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I'm an extreme example of this.

78
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
My worlds of words and numbers

79
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
blur with color, emotion

80
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and personality.

81
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
As Juan said,

82
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
it's the condition that scientists call synesthesia,

83
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
an unusual cross-talk

84
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
between the senses.

85
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Here are the numbers one to 12

86
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
as I see them --

87
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
every number with its own shape and character.

88
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
One is a flash of white light.

89
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Six is a tiny and very sad black hole.

90
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
The sketches are in black and white here,

91
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
but in my mind they have colors.

92
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Three is green.

93
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Four is blue.

94
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Five is yellow.

95
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I paint as well.

96
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And here is one of my paintings.

97
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
It's a multiplication of two prime numbers.

98
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Three-dimensional shapes

99
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and the space they create in the middle

100
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
creates a new shape,

101
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
the answer to the sum.

102
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
What about bigger numbers?

103
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Well you can't get much bigger than Pi,

104
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
the mathematical constant.

105
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
It's an infinite number --

106
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
literally goes on forever.

107
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
In this painting that I made

108
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
of the first 20 decimals of Pi,

109
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I take the colors

110
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and the emotions and the textures

111
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and I pull them all together

112
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
into a kind of rolling numerical landscape.

113
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
But it's not only numbers that I see in colors.

114
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Words too, for me,

115
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
have colors and emotions

116
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and textures.

117
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And this is an opening phrase

118
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
from the novel "Lolita."

119
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And Nabokov was himself synesthetic.

120
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And you can see here

121
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
how my perception of the sound L

122
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
helps the alliteration

123
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
to jump right out.

124
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Another example:

125
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
a little bit more mathematical.

126
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And I wonder if some of you will notice

127
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
the construction of the sentence

128
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
from "The Great Gatsby."

129
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
There is a procession of syllables --

130
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
wheat, one;

131
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
prairies, two;

132
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
lost Swede towns, three --

133
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
one, two, three.

134
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And this effect is very pleasant on the mind,

135
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and it helps the sentence

136
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
to feel right.

137
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Let's go back to the questions

138
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I posed you a moment ago.

139
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
64 multiplied by 75.

140
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
If some of you play chess,

141
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
you'll know that 64

142
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
is a square number,

143
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and that's why chessboards,

144
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
eight by eight,

145
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
have 64 squares.

146
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So that gives us a form

147
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that we can picture, that we can perceive.

148
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
What about 75?

149
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Well if 100,

150
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
if we think of 100 as being like a square,

151
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
75 would look like this.

152
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So what we need to do now

153
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
is put those two pictures

154
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
together in our mind --

155
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
something like this.

156
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
64 becomes 6,400.

157
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And in the right-hand corner,

158
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
you don't have to calculate anything.

159
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Four across, four up and down --

160
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
it's 16.

161
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So what the sum is actually asking you to do

162
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
is 16,

163
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
16, 16.

164
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
That's a lot easier

165
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
than the way that the school taught you to do math, I'm sure.

166
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
It's 16, 16, 16, 48,

167
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
4,800 --

168
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
4,800,

169
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
the answer to the sum.

170
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Easy when you know how.

171
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
(Laughter)

172
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
The second question was an Icelandic word.

173
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I'm assuming there are not many people here

174
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
who speak Icelandic.

175
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So let me narrow the choices down to two.

176
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Hnugginn:

177
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
is it a happy word,

178
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
or a sad word?

179
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
What do you say?

180
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Okay.

181
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Some people say it's happy.

182
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Most people, a majority of people,

183
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
say sad.

184
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And it actually means sad.

185
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
(Laughter)

186
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Why do, statistically,

187
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
a majority of people

188
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
say that a word is sad, in this case,

189
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
heavy in other cases?

190
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
In my theory, language evolves in such a way

191
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that sounds match,

192
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
correspond with, the subjective,

193
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
with the personal,

194
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
intuitive experience

195
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
of the listener.

196
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Let's have a look at the third question.

197
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
It's a line from a poem by John Keats.

198
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Words, like numbers,

199
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
express fundamental relationships

200
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
between objects

201
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and events and forces

202
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that constitute our world.

203
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
It stands to reason that we, existing in this world,

204
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
should in the course of our lives

205
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
absorb intuitively those relationships.

206
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And poets, like other artists,

207
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
play with those intuitive understandings.

208
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
In the case of hare,

209
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
it's an ambiguous sound in English.

210
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
It can also mean the fibers that grow from a head.

211
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And if we think of that --

212
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
let me put the picture up --

213
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
the fibers represent vulnerability.

214
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
They yield to the slightest movement

215
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
or motion or emotion.

216
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So what you have is an atmosphere

217
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
of vulnerability and tension.

218
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
The hare itself, the animal --

219
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
not a cat, not a dog, a hare --

220
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
why a hare?

221
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Because think of the picture --

222
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
not the word, the picture.

223
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
The overlong ears,

224
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
the overlarge feet,

225
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
helps us to picture, to feel intuitively,

226
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
what it means to limp

227
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and to tremble.

228
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
So in these few minutes,

229
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
I hope I've been able to share

230
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
a little bit of my vision of things

231
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and to show you

232
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that words can have colors and emotions,

233
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
numbers, shapes and personalities.

234
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
The world is richer,

235
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
vaster

236
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
than it too often seems to be.

237
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I hope that I've given you the desire

238
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
to learn to see the world with new eyes.

239
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Thank you.

240
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.502,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Technology can change our understanding of nature.

2
0:00:16.693,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Take for example the case of lions.

3
0:00:19.844,000 --> 0:00:21,000
For centuries, it's been said that female lions

4
0:00:22.014,000 --> 0:00:24,000
do all of the hunting out in the open savanna,

5
0:00:24.743,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and male lions do nothing until it's time for dinner.

6
0:00:28.724,000 --> 0:00:31,000
You've heard this too, I can tell.

7
0:00:31.736,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Well recently, I led an airborne mapping campaign

8
0:00:34.322,000 --> 0:00:36,000
in the Kruger National Park in South Africa.

9
0:00:36.994,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Our colleagues put GPS tracking collars

10
0:00:39.586,000 --> 0:00:4,000
on male and female lions,

11
0:00:41.183,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and we mapped their hunting behavior

12
0:00:42.791,000 --> 0:00:43,000
from the air.

13
0:00:44.239,000 --> 0:00:46,000
The lower left shows a lion sizing up

14
0:00:46.905,000 --> 0:00:48,000
a herd of impala for a kill,

15
0:00:48.917,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and the right shows what I call

16
0:00:50.486,000 --> 0:00:51,000
the lion viewshed.

17
0:00:52.349,000 --> 0:00:54,000
That's how far the lion can see in all directions

18
0:00:54.971,000 --> 0:00:58,000
until his or her view is obstructed by vegetation.

19
0:00:59.146,000 --> 0:01:,000
And what we found

20
0:01:00.587,000 --> 0:01:02,000
is that male lions are not the lazy hunters

21
0:01:03.093,000 --> 0:01:04,000
we thought them to be.

22
0:01:04.617,000 --> 0:01:06,000
They just use a different strategy.

23
0:01:06.754,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Whereas the female lions hunt

24
0:01:08.506,000 --> 0:01:09,000
out in the open savanna

25
0:01:09.638,000 --> 0:01:11,000
over long distances, usually during the day,

26
0:01:12.299,000 --> 0:01:15,000
male lions use an ambush strategy

27
0:01:15.309,000 --> 0:01:18,000
in dense vegetation, and often at night.

28
0:01:19.042,000 --> 0:01:22,000
This video shows the actual hunting viewsheds

29
0:01:22.048,000 --> 0:01:23,000
of male lions on the left

30
0:01:23.913,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and females on the right.

31
0:01:25.902,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Red and darker colors show more dense vegetation,

32
0:01:28.458,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and the white are wide open spaces.

33
0:01:30.573,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And this is the viewshed right literally at the eye level

34
0:01:33.673,000 --> 0:01:35,000
of hunting male and female lions.

35
0:01:36.203,000 --> 0:01:38,000
All of a sudden, you get a very clear understanding

36
0:01:38.532,000 --> 0:01:4,000
of the very spooky conditions under which

37
0:01:41.385,000 --> 0:01:43,000
male lions do their hunting.

38
0:01:43.465,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I bring up this example to begin,

39
0:01:44.961,000 --> 0:01:48,000
because it emphasizes how little we know about nature.

40
0:01:49.429,000 --> 0:01:51,000
There's been a huge amount of work done so far

41
0:01:52.104,000 --> 0:01:55,000
to try to slow down our losses of tropical forests,

42
0:01:55.732,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and we are losing our forests at a rapid rate,

43
0:01:57.681,000 --> 0:01:58,000
as shown in red on the slide.

44
0:01:59.595,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I find it ironic that we're doing so much,

45
0:02:01.935,000 --> 0:02:04,000
yet these areas are fairly unknown to science.

46
0:02:05.568,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So how can we save what we don't understand?

47
0:02:08.225,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Now I'm a global ecologist and an Earth explorer

48
0:02:10.887,000 --> 0:02:11,000
with a background in physics and chemistry

49
0:02:12.578,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and biology and a lot of other boring subjects,

50
0:02:15.782,000 --> 0:02:18,000
but above all, I'm obsessed with what we don't know

51
0:02:18.784,000 --> 0:02:19,000
about our planet.

52
0:02:20.496,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So I created this,

53
0:02:22.17,000 --> 0:02:25,000
the Carnegie Airborne Observatory, or CAO.

54
0:02:25.447,000 --> 0:02:27,000
It may look like a plane with a fancy paint job,

55
0:02:27.504,000 --> 0:02:29,000
but I packed it with over 1,000 kilos

56
0:02:30.264,000 --> 0:02:32,000
of high-tech sensors, computers,

57
0:02:32.7,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and a very motivated staff

58
0:02:34.911,000 --> 0:02:36,000
of Earth scientists and pilots.

59
0:02:37.38,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Two of our instruments are very unique:

60
0:02:39.24,000 --> 0:02:4,000
one is called an imaging spectrometer

61
0:02:40.994,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that can actually measure the chemical composition

62
0:02:42.856,000 --> 0:02:44,000
of plants as we fly over them.

63
0:02:45.785,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Another one is a set of lasers,

64
0:02:47.711,000 --> 0:02:48,000
very high-powered lasers,

65
0:02:49.442,000 --> 0:02:5,000
that fire out of the bottom of the plane,

66
0:02:51.402,000 --> 0:02:52,000
sweeping across the ecosystem

67
0:02:53.274,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and measuring it at nearly 500,000 times per second

68
0:02:57.371,000 --> 0:02:59,000
in high-resolution 3D.

69
0:02:59.849,000 --> 0:03:,000
Here's an image of the Golden Gate Bridge

70
0:03:01.833,000 --> 0:03:03,000
in San Francisco, not far from where I live.

71
0:03:04.005,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Although we flew straight over this bridge,

72
0:03:05.808,000 --> 0:03:06,000
we imaged it in 3D, captured its color

73
0:03:07.464,000 --> 0:03:09,000
in just a few seconds.

74
0:03:09.511,000 --> 0:03:11,000
But the real power of the CAO

75
0:03:11.606,000 --> 0:03:13,000
is its ability to capture the actual building blocks

76
0:03:13.781,000 --> 0:03:14,000
of ecosystems.

77
0:03:15.55,000 --> 0:03:16,000
This is a small town in the Amazon,

78
0:03:17.249,000 --> 0:03:18,000
imaged with the CAO.

79
0:03:18.864,000 --> 0:03:19,000
We can slice through our data

80
0:03:20.603,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and see, for example, the 3D structure

81
0:03:22.867,000 --> 0:03:24,000
of the vegetation and the buildings,

82
0:03:25.2,000 --> 0:03:26,000
or we can use the chemical information

83
0:03:27.109,000 --> 0:03:29,000
to actually figure out how fast the plants are growing

84
0:03:29.84,000 --> 0:03:3,000
as we fly over them.

85
0:03:31.183,000 --> 0:03:34,000
The hottest pinks are the fastest-growing plants.

86
0:03:34.669,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And we can see biodiversity in ways

87
0:03:36.586,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that you never could have imagined.

88
0:03:38.745,000 --> 0:03:39,000
This is what a rainforest might look like

89
0:03:40.296,000 --> 0:03:42,000
as you fly over it in a hot air balloon.

90
0:03:42.503,000 --> 0:03:44,000
This is how we see a rainforest,

91
0:03:44.597,000 --> 0:03:46,000
in kaleidoscopic color that tells us

92
0:03:46.942,000 --> 0:03:48,000
that there are many species living with one another.

93
0:03:49.884,000 --> 0:03:5,000
But you have to remember that these trees

94
0:03:51.808,000 --> 0:03:53,000
are literally bigger than whales,

95
0:03:54.104,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and what that means is that they're impossible to understand

96
0:03:57.016,000 --> 0:03:59,000
just by walking on the ground below them.

97
0:03:59.991,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So our imagery is 3D, it's chemical, it's biological,

98
0:04:04.629,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and this tells us not only the species

99
0:04:06.387,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that are living in the canopy,

100
0:04:08.271,000 --> 0:04:09,000
but it tells us a lot of information

101
0:04:10.191,000 --> 0:04:13,000
about the rest of the species that occupy the rainforest.

102
0:04:13.767,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Now I created the CAO

103
0:04:15.898,000 --> 0:04:17,000
in order to answer questions that have proven

104
0:04:18.037,000 --> 0:04:21,000
extremely challenging to answer from any other vantage point,

105
0:04:21.389,000 --> 0:04:23,000
such as from the ground, or from satellite sensors.

106
0:04:24.266,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I want to share three of those questions with you today.

107
0:04:27.503,000 --> 0:04:28,000
The first questions is,

108
0:04:29.21,000 --> 0:04:3,000
how do we manage our carbon reserves

109
0:04:30.939,000 --> 0:04:32,000
in tropical forests?

110
0:04:33.695,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Tropical forests contain a huge amount of carbon in the trees,

111
0:04:37.254,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and we need to keep that carbon in those forests

112
0:04:39.668,000 --> 0:04:42,000
if we're going to avoid any further global warming.

113
0:04:43.082,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Unfortunately, global carbon emissions

114
0:04:45.308,000 --> 0:04:46,000
from deforestation

115
0:04:47.071,000 --> 0:04:5,000
now equals the global transportation sector.

116
0:04:50.246,000 --> 0:04:54,000
That's all ships, airplanes, trains and automobiles combined.

117
0:04:54.549,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So it's understandable that policy negotiators

118
0:04:57.64,000 --> 0:04:59,000
have been working hard to reduce deforestation,

119
0:05:00.128,000 --> 0:05:01,000
but they're doing it on landscapes

120
0:05:01.999,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that are hardly known to science.

121
0:05:04.138,000 --> 0:05:06,000
If you don't know where the carbon is exactly,

122
0:05:06.499,000 --> 0:05:08,000
in detail, how can you know what you're losing?

123
0:05:09.351,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Basically, we need a high-tech accounting system.

124
0:05:13.408,000 --> 0:05:15,000
With our system, we're able to see the carbon stocks

125
0:05:15.724,000 --> 0:05:17,000
of tropical forests in utter detail.

126
0:05:18.522,000 --> 0:05:2,000
The red shows, obviously, closed-canopy tropical forest,

127
0:05:21.377,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and then you see the cookie cutting,

128
0:05:23.395,000 --> 0:05:26,000
or the cutting of the forest in yellows and greens.

129
0:05:27.302,000 --> 0:05:29,000
It's like cutting a cake except this cake

130
0:05:30.125,000 --> 0:05:32,000
is about whale deep.

131
0:05:32.324,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And yet, we can zoom in and see the forest

132
0:05:34.292,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and the trees at the same time.

133
0:05:36.305,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And what's amazing is, even though we flew

134
0:05:38.507,000 --> 0:05:4,000
very high above this forest,

135
0:05:40.784,000 --> 0:05:41,000
later on in analysis, we can go in

136
0:05:42.687,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and actually experience the treetrops,

137
0:05:44.907,000 --> 0:05:46,000
leaf by leaf, branch by branch,

138
0:05:47.254,000 --> 0:05:5,000
just as the other species that live in this forest

139
0:05:50.761,000 --> 0:05:52,000
experience it along with the trees themselves.

140
0:05:53.578,000 --> 0:05:55,000
We've been using the technology to explore

141
0:05:55.744,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and to actually put out the first carbon geographies

142
0:05:58.614,000 --> 0:05:59,000
in high resolution

143
0:06:00.228,000 --> 0:06:02,000
in faraway places like the Amazon Basin

144
0:06:02.474,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and not-so-faraway places like the United States

145
0:06:04.761,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and Central America.

146
0:06:06.494,000 --> 0:06:09,000
What I'm going to do is I'm going to take you on a high-resolution, first-time tour

147
0:06:09.994,000 --> 0:06:12,000
of the carbon landscapes of Peru and then Panama.

148
0:06:13.923,000 --> 0:06:15,000
The colors are going to be going from red to blue.

149
0:06:16.685,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Red is extremely high carbon stocks,

150
0:06:18.679,000 --> 0:06:2,000
your largest cathedral forests you can imagine,

151
0:06:21.218,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and blue are very low carbon stocks.

152
0:06:23.46,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And let me tell you, Peru alone is an amazing place,

153
0:06:25.894,000 --> 0:06:27,000
totally unknown in terms of its carbon geography

154
0:06:28.283,000 --> 0:06:29,000
until today.

155
0:06:29.869,000 --> 0:06:3,000
We can fly to this area in northern Peru

156
0:06:31.715,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and see super high carbon stocks in red,

157
0:06:33.851,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and the Amazon River and floodplain

158
0:06:35.34,000 --> 0:06:36,000
cutting right through it.

159
0:06:37.085,000 --> 0:06:38,000
We can go to an area of utter devastation

160
0:06:38.983,000 --> 0:06:39,000
caused by deforestation in blue,

161
0:06:40.818,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and the virus of deforestation spreading out in orange.

162
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
We can also fly to the southern Andes

163
0:06:46.944,000 --> 0:06:47,000
to see the tree line and see exactly how

164
0:06:48.794,000 --> 0:06:49,000
the carbon geography ends

165
0:06:50.71,000 --> 0:06:52,000
as we go up into the mountain system.

166
0:06:53.416,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And we can go to the biggest swamp in the western Amazon.

167
0:06:56.321,000 --> 0:06:57,000
It's a watery dreamworld

168
0:06:57.694,000 --> 0:06:59,000
akin to Jim Cameron's "Avatar."

169
0:07:00.04,000 --> 0:07:03,000
We can go to one of the smallest tropical countries,

170
0:07:03.344,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Panama, and see also a huge range

171
0:07:05.701,000 --> 0:07:06,000
of carbon variation,

172
0:07:07.263,000 --> 0:07:09,000
from high in red to low in blue.

173
0:07:09.264,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Unfortunately, most of the carbon is lost in the lowlands,

174
0:07:12.196,000 --> 0:07:13,000
but what you see that's left,

175
0:07:13.742,000 --> 0:07:15,000
in terms of high carbon stocks in greens and reds,

176
0:07:16.475,000 --> 0:07:18,000
is the stuff that's up in the mountains.

177
0:07:18.589,000 --> 0:07:2,000
One interesting exception to this

178
0:07:20.947,000 --> 0:07:21,000
is right in the middle of your screen.

179
0:07:22.563,000 --> 0:07:24,000
You're seeing the buffer zone around the Panama Canal.

180
0:07:25.207,000 --> 0:07:26,000
That's in the reds and yellows.

181
0:07:27.12,000 --> 0:07:28,000
The canal authorities are using force

182
0:07:28.86,000 --> 0:07:31,000
to protect their watershed and global commerce.

183
0:07:31.975,000 --> 0:07:32,000
This kind of carbon mapping

184
0:07:33.465,000 --> 0:07:34,000
has transformed conservation

185
0:07:35.383,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and resource policy development.

186
0:07:36.979,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It's really advancing our ability to save forests

187
0:07:39.339,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and to curb climate change.

188
0:07:41.714,000 --> 0:07:44,000
My second question: How do we prepare for climate change

189
0:07:45.145,000 --> 0:07:47,000
in a place like the Amazon rainforest?

190
0:07:47.291,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Let me tell you, I spend a lot of time

191
0:07:48.944,000 --> 0:07:51,000
in these places, and we're seeing the climate changing already.

192
0:07:52.169,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Temperatures are increasing,

193
0:07:53.781,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and what's really happening is we're getting a lot of droughts,

194
0:07:56.413,000 --> 0:07:57,000
recurring droughts.

195
0:07:58.07,000 --> 0:07:59,000
The 2010 mega-drought is shown here

196
0:07:59.887,000 --> 0:08:02,000
with red showing an area about the size of Western Europe.

197
0:08:03.337,000 --> 0:08:05,000
The Amazon was so dry in 2010

198
0:08:05.599,000 --> 0:08:07,000
that even the main stem of the Amazon river itself

199
0:08:08.001,000 --> 0:08:1,000
dried up partially, as you see in the photo

200
0:08:10.15,000 --> 0:08:13,000
in the lower portion of the slide.

201
0:08:13.556,000 --> 0:08:16,000
What we found is that in very remote areas,

202
0:08:16.726,000 --> 0:08:18,000
these droughts are having a big negative impact

203
0:08:19.472,000 --> 0:08:2,000
on tropical forests.

204
0:08:21.06,000 --> 0:08:23,000
For example, these are all of the dead trees in red

205
0:08:23.78,000 --> 0:08:26,000
that suffered mortality following the 2010 drought.

206
0:08:26.841,000 --> 0:08:27,000
This area happens to be on the border

207
0:08:28.718,000 --> 0:08:29,000
of Peru and Brazil,

208
0:08:30.117,000 --> 0:08:31,000
totally unexplored,

209
0:08:31.653,000 --> 0:08:33,000
almost totally unknown scientifically.

210
0:08:34.456,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So what we think, as Earth scientists,

211
0:08:36.922,000 --> 0:08:37,000
is species are going to have to migrate

212
0:08:38.881,000 --> 0:08:4,000
with climate change from the east in Brazil

213
0:08:41.673,000 --> 0:08:43,000
all the way west into the Andes

214
0:08:43.737,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and up into the mountains

215
0:08:45.21,000 --> 0:08:48,000
in order to minimize their exposure to climate change.

216
0:08:48.746,000 --> 0:08:5,000
One of the problems with this is that humans

217
0:08:50.754,000 --> 0:08:53,000
are taking apart the western Amazon as we speak.

218
0:08:53.779,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Look at this 100-square-kilometer gash

219
0:08:55.888,000 --> 0:08:57,000
in the forest created by gold miners.

220
0:08:58.79,000 --> 0:09:,000
You see the forest in green in 3D,

221
0:09:01.068,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and you see the effects of gold mining

222
0:09:02.902,000 --> 0:09:04,000
down below the soil surface.

223
0:09:05.441,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Species have nowhere to migrate in a system like this, obviously.

224
0:09:09.9,000 --> 0:09:11,000
If you haven't been to the Amazon, you should go.

225
0:09:12.552,000 --> 0:09:14,000
It's an amazing experience every time,

226
0:09:14.59,000 --> 0:09:15,000
no matter where you go.

227
0:09:16.133,000 --> 0:09:19,000
You're going to probably see it this way, on a river.

228
0:09:19.529,000 --> 0:09:2,000
But what happens is a lot of times

229
0:09:21.293,000 --> 0:09:22,000
the rivers hide what's really going on

230
0:09:23.145,000 --> 0:09:25,000
back in the forest itself.

231
0:09:25.91,000 --> 0:09:26,000
We flew over this same river,

232
0:09:27.624,000 --> 0:09:28,000
imaged the system in 3D.

233
0:09:29.464,000 --> 0:09:3,000
The forest is on the left.

234
0:09:31.28,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And then we can digitally remove the forest

235
0:09:33.266,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and see what's going on below the canopy.

236
0:09:35.725,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And in this case, we found gold mining activity,

237
0:09:38.175,000 --> 0:09:39,000
all of it illegal,

238
0:09:39.412,000 --> 0:09:41,000
set back away from the river's edge,

239
0:09:41.608,000 --> 0:09:42,000
as you'll see in those strange pockmarks

240
0:09:43.512,000 --> 0:09:45,000
coming up on your screen on the right.

241
0:09:45.539,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Don't worry, we're working with the authorities

242
0:09:47.868,000 --> 0:09:49,000
to deal with this and many, many other problems

243
0:09:50.319,000 --> 0:09:52,000
in the region.

244
0:09:52.929,000 --> 0:09:55,000
So in order to put together a conservation plan

245
0:09:55.984,000 --> 0:09:56,000
for these unique, important corridors

246
0:09:57.724,000 --> 0:09:59,000
like the western Amazon and the Andes Amazon corridor,

247
0:10:00.711,000 --> 0:10:02,000
we have to start making

248
0:10:02.875,000 --> 0:10:04,000
geographically explicit plans now.

249
0:10:05.283,000 --> 0:10:08,000
How do we do that if we don't know the geography of biodiversity in the region,

250
0:10:09.258,000 --> 0:10:1,000
if it's so unknown to science?

251
0:10:10.953,000 --> 0:10:11,000
So what we've been doing is using

252
0:10:12.817,000 --> 0:10:14,000
the laser-guided spectroscopy from the CAO

253
0:10:15.79,000 --> 0:10:17,000
to map for the first time the biodiversity

254
0:10:18.014,000 --> 0:10:19,000
of the Amazon rainforest.

255
0:10:19.593,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Here you see actual data showing different species in different colors.

256
0:10:23.13,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Reds are one type of species, blues are another,

257
0:10:25.27,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and greens are yet another.

258
0:10:27.615,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And when we take this together and scale up

259
0:10:29.778,000 --> 0:10:3,000
to the regional level,

260
0:10:31.662,000 --> 0:10:33,000
we get a completely new geography

261
0:10:34.231,000 --> 0:10:38,000
of biodiversity unknown prior to this work.

262
0:10:38.619,000 --> 0:10:4,000
This tells us where the big biodiversity changes

263
0:10:40.767,000 --> 0:10:42,000
occur from habitat to habitat,

264
0:10:42.781,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and that's really important because it tells us

265
0:10:44.964,000 --> 0:10:46,000
a lot about where species may migrate to

266
0:10:47.859,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and migrate from as the climate shifts.

267
0:10:50.742,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And this is the pivotal information that's needed

268
0:10:53.964,000 --> 0:10:56,000
by decision makers to develop protected areas

269
0:10:57.472,000 --> 0:11:,000
in the context of their regional development plans.

270
0:11:00.891,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And third and final question is,

271
0:11:02.788,000 --> 0:11:04,000
how do we manage biodiversity on a planet

272
0:11:04.896,000 --> 0:11:05,000
of protected ecosystems?

273
0:11:06.874,000 --> 0:11:08,000
The example I started out with about lions hunting,

274
0:11:09.625,000 --> 0:11:1,000
that was a study we did

275
0:11:11.48,000 --> 0:11:12,000
behind the fence line of a protected area

276
0:11:13.472,000 --> 0:11:14,000
in South Africa.

277
0:11:15.204,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And the truth is, much of Africa's nature

278
0:11:17.202,000 --> 0:11:18,000
is going to persist into the future

279
0:11:19.117,000 --> 0:11:22,000
in protected areas like I show in blue on the screen.

280
0:11:22.363,000 --> 0:11:24,000
This puts incredible pressure and responsibility

281
0:11:24.839,000 --> 0:11:25,000
on park management.

282
0:11:26.458,000 --> 0:11:28,000
They need to do and make decisions

283
0:11:29.075,000 --> 0:11:32,000
that will benefit all of the species that they're protecting.

284
0:11:32.366,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Some of their decisions have really big impacts.

285
0:11:35.435,000 --> 0:11:37,000
For example, how much and where

286
0:11:37.511,000 --> 0:11:39,000
to use fire as a management tool?

287
0:11:40.151,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Or, how to deal with a large species like elephants,

288
0:11:43.376,000 --> 0:11:45,000
which may, if their populations get too large,

289
0:11:45.829,000 --> 0:11:47,000
have a negative impact on the ecosystem

290
0:11:47.876,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and on other species.

291
0:11:49.478,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And let me tell you, these types of dynamics

292
0:11:51.971,000 --> 0:11:52,000
really play out on the landscape.

293
0:11:53.919,000 --> 0:11:55,000
In the foreground is an area with lots of fire

294
0:11:56.38,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and lots of elephants:

295
0:11:57.647,000 --> 0:12:,000
wide open savanna in blue, and just a few trees.

296
0:12:01.323,000 --> 0:12:03,000
As we cross this fence line, now we're getting

297
0:12:03.504,000 --> 0:12:05,000
into an area that has had protection from fire

298
0:12:05.828,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and zero elephants:

299
0:12:07.685,000 --> 0:12:11,000
dense vegetation, a radically different ecosystem.

300
0:12:11.843,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And in a place like Kruger,

301
0:12:14.233,000 --> 0:12:15,000
the soaring elephant densities

302
0:12:15.974,000 --> 0:12:16,000
are a real problem.

303
0:12:17.717,000 --> 0:12:19,000
I know it's a sensitive issue for many of you,

304
0:12:20.081,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and there are no easy answers with this.

305
0:12:22.741,000 --> 0:12:24,000
But what's good is that the technology we've developed

306
0:12:25.057,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and we're working with in South Africa, for example,

307
0:12:27.529,000 --> 0:12:3,000
is allowing us to map every single tree in the savanna,

308
0:12:30.885,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and then through repeat flights

309
0:12:32.454,000 --> 0:12:33,000
we're able to see which trees

310
0:12:34.2,000 --> 0:12:36,000
are being pushed over by elephants,

311
0:12:36.23,000 --> 0:12:39,000
in the red as you see on the screen, and how much that's happening

312
0:12:39.488,000 --> 0:12:41,000
in different types of landscapes in the savanna.

313
0:12:42.025,000 --> 0:12:43,000
That's giving park managers

314
0:12:43.666,000 --> 0:12:45,000
a very first opportunity to use

315
0:12:46.029,000 --> 0:12:49,000
tactical management strategies that are more nuanced

316
0:12:49.371,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and don't lead to those extremes that I just showed you.

317
0:12:54.282,000 --> 0:12:56,000
So really, the way we're looking

318
0:12:56.905,000 --> 0:12:58,000
at protected areas nowadays

319
0:12:58.946,000 --> 0:13:,000
is to think of it as tending to a circle of life,

320
0:13:01.834,000 --> 0:13:03,000
where we have fire management,

321
0:13:03.882,000 --> 0:13:07,000
elephant management, those impacts on the structure of the ecosystem,

322
0:13:08.016,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and then those impacts

323
0:13:10.006,000 --> 0:13:12,000
affecting everything from insects

324
0:13:12.312,000 --> 0:13:14,000
up to apex predators like lions.

325
0:13:15.112,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Going forward, I plan to greatly expand

326
0:13:16.877,000 --> 0:13:17,000
the airborne observatory.

327
0:13:18.605,000 --> 0:13:2,000
I'm hoping to actually put the technology into orbit

328
0:13:20.772,000 --> 0:13:21,000
so we can manage the entire planet

329
0:13:22.455,000 --> 0:13:23,000
with technologies like this.

330
0:13:24.188,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Until then, you're going to find me flying

331
0:13:26.037,000 --> 0:13:28,000
in some remote place that you've never heard of.

332
0:13:28.54,000 --> 0:13:3,000
I just want to end by saying that technology is

333
0:13:31.082,000 --> 0:13:34,000
absolutely critical to managing our planet,

334
0:13:34.821,000 --> 0:13:36,000
but even more important is the understanding

335
0:13:36.92,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and wisdom to apply it.

336
0:13:38.652,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Thank you.

337
0:13:40.751,000 --> 0:13:44,000
(Applause)

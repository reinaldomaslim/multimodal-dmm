Translator: Jenny Zurawell

2
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
What I want to talk about is, as background,

3
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:31,000
is the idea that cars are art.

4
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:34,000
This is actually quite meaningful to me,

5
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:38,000
because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole --

6
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:41,000
we don't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it --

7
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and cars are thought so much as a product

8
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that it's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side

9
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:5,000
under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art.

10
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And so cars, as art, brings it into an emotional plane -- if you accept that --

11
0:00:56,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital A.

12
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Now at this point you're going to see a picture of Michelangelo.

13
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:05,000
This is completely different than automobiles.

14
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Automobiles are self-moving things, right? Elevators are automobiles.

15
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And they're not very emotional; they solve a purpose;

16
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and certainly automobiles have been around for 100 years

17
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and have made our lives functionally a lot better in many ways;

18
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:22,000
they've also been a real pain in the ass,

19
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:26,000
because automobiles are really the thing we have to solve.

20
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
We have to solve the pollution, we have to solve the congestion --

21
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:32,000
but that's not what interests me in this speech.

22
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:37,000
What interests me in this speech is cars. Automobiles may be what you use,

23
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:4,000
but cars are what we are, in many ways.

24
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And as long as we can solve the problems of automobiles,

25
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and I believe we can, with fuel cells or hydrogen, like BMW is really hip on,

26
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and lots of other things, then I think we can look past that

27
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and try and understand why this hook is in many of us --

28
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:59,000
of this car-y-ness -- and what that means, what we can learn from it.

29
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:02,000
That's what I want to get to. Cars are not a suit of clothes;

30
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:06,000
cars are an avatar. Cars are an expansion of yourself:

31
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:1,000
they take your thoughts, your ideas, your emotions, and they multiply it --

32
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:13,000
your anger, whatever. It's an avatar.

33
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:16,000
It's a super-waldo that you happen to be inside of, and if you feel sexy,

34
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
the car is sexy. And if you're full of road rage,

35
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:21,000
you've got a "Chevy: Like a Rock," right?

36
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Cars are a sculpture -- did you know this?

37
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:27,000
That every car you see out there is sculpted by hand.

38
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Many people think, "Well, it's computers,

39
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and it's done by machines and stuff like that."

40
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Well, they reproduce it, but the originals are all done by hand.

41
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:38,000
It's done by men and women who believe a lot in their craft.

42
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a car

43
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum.

44
0:02:45,000 --> 0:02:49,000
That tension between the need to express, the need to discover,

45
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:51,000
then you put something new into it,

46
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and at the same time you have bounds of craftsmanship.

47
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Rules that say, this is how you handle surfaces;

48
0:02:57,000 --> 0:03:01,000
this is what control is all about; this is how you show you're a master of your craft.

49
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And that tension, that discovery, that push for something new --

50
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and at the same time, that sense of obligation

51
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to the regards of craftsmanship --

52
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that's as strong in cars as it is in anything.

53
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:12,000
We work in clay, which hasn't changed much

54
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:15,000
since Michelangelo started screwing around with it,

55
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and there's a very interesting analogy to that too.

56
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Real quickly -- Michelangelo once said he's there to "discover the figure within," OK?

57
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:26,000
There we go, the automobile.

58
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
That was 100 years right there -- did you catch that?

59
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Between that one there, and that one there, it changed a lot didn't it?

60
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:35,000
OK, it's not marketing; there's a very interesting car concept here,

61
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:37,000
but the marketing part is not what I want to talk about here.

62
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I want to talk about this.

63
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Why it means you have to wash a car, what is it, that sensuality

64
0:03:41,000 --> 0:03:46,000
you have to touch about it? That's the sculpture that goes into it. That sensuality.

65
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And it's done by men and women working just like this, making cars.

66
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Now this little quote about sculpture from Henry Moore,

67
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I believe that that "pressure within" that Moore's talking about --

68
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:58,000
at least when it comes to cars --

69
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:01,000
comes right back to this idea of the mean.

70
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It's that will to live, that need to survive, to express itself,

71
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that comes in a car, and takes over people like me.

72
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And we tell other people, "Do this, do this, do this," until this thing comes alive.

73
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:14,000
We are completely infected. And beauty can be the result

74
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:16,000
of this infectiousness; it's quite wonderful.

75
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
This sculpture is, of course, at the heart of all of it,

76
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and it's really what puts the craftsmanship into our cars.

77
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And it's not a whole lot different, really, when they're working like this,

78
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
or when somebody works like this.

79
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:31,000
It's that same kind of commitment, that same kind of beauty.

80
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Now, now I get to the point. I want to talk about cars as art.

81
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Art, in the Platonic sense, is truth; it's beauty, and love.

82
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Now this is really where designers in car business diverge from the engineers.

83
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:44,000
We don't really have a problem talking about love.

84
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:47,000
We don't have a problem talking about truth or beauty in that sense.

85
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:49,000
That's what we're searching for --

86
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:52,000
when we're working our craft, we are really trying to find that truth out there.

87
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:54,000
We're not trying to find vanity and beauty.

88
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:56,000
We're trying to find the beauty in the truth.

89
0:04:56,000 --> 0:05:,000
However, engineers tend to look at things a little bit more Newtonian,

90
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:02,000
instead of this quantum approach.

91
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:04,000
We're dealing with irrationalisms,

92
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and we're dealing with paradoxes that we admit exist,

93
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and the engineers tend to look things a little bit more like

94
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:13,000
two and two is four, and if you get 4.0 it's better, and 4.000 is even better.

95
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence

96
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:19,000
in why we're doing what we're doing.

97
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:21,000
We've pretty much accepted the fact, though,

98
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that we are the women in the organization at BMW --

99
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:26,000
BMW is a very manly type business, -- men, men, men; it's engineers.

100
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And we're kind of the female side to that. That's OK,

101
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that's cool. You go off and be manly. We're going to be a little bit more female.

102
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Because what we're interested in is finding form that's more than just a function.

103
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:42,000
We're interested in finding beauty that's more than just an aesthetic;

104
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:44,000
it's really a truth.

105
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And I think this idea of soul, as being at the heart of great cars,

106
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:5,000
is very applicable. You all know it. You know a car when you've seen it,

107
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:52,000
with soul. You know how strong this is.

108
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Well, this experience of love, and the experience of design, to me,

109
0:05:56,000 --> 0:05:59,000
are interchangeable. And now I'm coming to my story.

110
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I discovered something about love and design through a project called Deep Blue.

111
0:06:04,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And first of all, you have to go with me for a second, and say,

112
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:11,000
you know, you could take the word "love" out of a lot of things in our society,

113
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:13,000
put the word "design" in, and it still works,

114
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:16,000
like this quote here, you know. It kind of works, you know?

115
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
You can understand that. It works in truisms.

116
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:21,000
"All is fair in design and war."

117
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Certainly we live in a competitive society.

118
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I think this one here, there's a pop song

119
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that really describes Philippe Starck for me, you know, this is like

120
0:06:29,000 --> 0:06:32,000
you know, this is like puppy love, you know, this is cool right?

121
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Toothbrush, cool.

122
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:37,000
It really only gets serious when you look at something like this. OK?

123
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:39,000
(Laughter)

124
0:06:39,000 --> 0:06:41,000
This is one substitution that I believe

125
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:43,000
all of us, in design management, are guilty of.

126
0:06:43,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And this idea that there is more to love,

127
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:53,000
more to design, when it gets down to your neighbor, your other,

128
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:56,000
it can be physical like this, and maybe in the future it will be.

129
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:58,000
But right now it's in dealing with our own people,

130
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:02,000
our own teams who are doing the creating. So, to my story.

131
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:06,000
The idea of people-work is what we work with here,

132
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and I have to make a bond with my designers when we're creating BMWs.

133
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:13,000
We have to have a shared intimacy, a shared vision --

134
0:07:13,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that means we have to work as one family;

135
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:17,000
we have to understand ourselves that way.

136
0:07:17,000 --> 0:07:2,000
There's good times; there's interesting times;

137
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and there's some stress times too.

138
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:24,000
You want to do cars, you've got to go outside.

139
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:27,000
You've got to do cars in the rain; you've got to do cars in the snow.

140
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:3,000
That's, by the way, is a presentation we made to our board of directors.

141
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:33,000
We haul their butts out in the snow, too. You want to know cars outside?

142
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Well, you've got to stand outside to do this.

143
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And because these are artists, they have very artistic temperaments.

144
0:07:4,000 --> 0:07:45,000
All right? Now one thing about art is, art is discovery,

145
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and art is discovering yourself through your art. Right?

146
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And one thing about cars is we're all a little bit like Pygmalion,

147
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:55,000
we are completely in love with our own creations.

148
0:07:55,000 --> 0:08:,000
This is one of my favorite paintings, it really describes our relationship with cars.

149
0:08:,000 --> 0:08:02,000
This is sick beyond belief.

150
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:04,000
(Laughter)

151
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:08,000
But because of this, the intimacy with which we work together as a team

152
0:08:08,000 --> 0:08:11,000
takes on a new dimension, a new meaning.

153
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:15,000
We have a shared center; we have a shared focus --

154
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:19,000
that car stays at the middle of all our relationships.

155
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And it's my job, in the competitive process, to narrow this down.

156
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I heard today about Joseph's death genes

157
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that have to go in and kill cell reproduction.

158
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:34,000
You know, that's what I have to do sometimes.

159
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:37,000
We start out with 10 cars; we narrow it down to five cars,

160
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:4,000
down to three cars, down to two cars, down to one car,

161
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and I'm in the middle of that killing, basically.

162
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Someone's love, someone's baby.

163
0:08:46,000 --> 0:08:49,000
This is very difficult, and you have to have a bond with your team

164
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:53,000
that permits you to do this, because their life is wrapped up in that too.

165
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:56,000
They've got that gene infected in them as well,

166
0:08:56,000 --> 0:09:,000
and they want that to live, more than anything else.

167
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Well, this project, Deep Blue, put me in contact with my team

168
0:09:03,000 --> 0:09:06,000
in a way that I never expected, and I want to pass it on to you,

169
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:08,000
because I want you to reflect on this, perhaps in your own relationships.

170
0:09:08,000 --> 0:09:13,000
We wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap of faith for BMW.

171
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:17,000
We wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way we'd done it,

172
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:2,000
that I only had a phone number that connected me to them.

173
0:09:2,000 --> 0:09:25,000
So, what we did was: instead of having a staff of artists that are just your wrist,

174
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:29,000
we decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers

175
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:33,000
to find out what's the successor to the SUV phenomenon in America.

176
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
This is 1996 we did this project. And so we sent them off with this team name,

177
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Deep Blue. Now many people know Deep Blue from IBM --

178
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:43,000
we actually stole it from them because we figured

179
0:09:43,000 --> 0:09:46,000
if anybody read our faxes they'd think we're talking about computers.

180
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:48,000
It turned out it was quite clever because Deep Blue,

181
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:52,000
in a company like BMW, has a hook -- "Deep Blue," wow, cool name.

182
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:55,000
So people get wrapped up in it. And we took a team of designers,

183
0:09:55,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and we sent them off to America. And we gave them a budget,

184
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:,000
what we thought was a set of deliverables,

185
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:02,000
a timetable, and nothing else.

186
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Like I said, I just had a phone number that connected me to them.

187
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And a group of engineers worked in Germany,

188
0:10:07,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and the idea was they would work separately

189
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:12,000
on this problem of what's the successor to the SUV.

190
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:15,000
They would come together, compare notes. Then they would work apart,

191
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:17,000
come together, and they would produce together

192
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:21,000
a monumental set of diverse opinions that didn't pollute each other's ideas --

193
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:24,000
but at the same time came together and resolved the problems.

194
0:10:24,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Hopefully, really understand the customer at its heart,

195
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:33,000
where the customer is, live with them in America. So -- sent the team off,

196
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and actually something different happened. They went other places.

197
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:4,000
(Laughter)

198
0:10:4,000 --> 0:10:46,000
They disappeared, quite honestly, and all I got was postcards.

199
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Now, I got some postcards of these guys in Las Vegas,

200
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and I got some postcards of these guys in the Grand Canyon,

201
0:10:52,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and I got these postcards of Niagara Falls,

202
0:10:54,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and pretty soon they're in New York, and I don't know where else.

203
0:10:57,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And I'm telling myself, "This is going to be a great car,

204
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:06,000
they're doing research that I've never even thought about before."

205
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Right? And they decided that instead of, like, having a studio,

206
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and six or seven apartments,

207
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
it was cheaper to rent Elizabeth Taylor's ex-house in Malibu.

208
0:11:2,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And -- at least they told me it was her house,

209
0:11:23,000 --> 0:11:26,000
I guess it was at one time, she had a party there or something.

210
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
But anyway, this was the house, and they all lived there.

211
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Now this is 24/7 living, half-a-dozen people who'd left their --

212
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:39,000
some had left their wives behind and families behind,

213
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and they literally lived in this house

214
0:11:41,000 --> 0:11:44,000
for the entire six months the project was in America,

215
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:47,000
but the first three months were the most intensive.

216
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And one of the young women in the project,

217
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:53,000
she was a fantastic lady, she actually built her room in the bathroom.

218
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:56,000
The bathroom was so big, she built the bed over the bathtub --

219
0:11:56,000 --> 0:11:58,000
it's quite fascinating.

220
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:02,000
On the other hand, I didn't know anything about this. OK?

221
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Nothing. This is all going on, and all I'm getting is postcards

222
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:07,000
of these guys in Las Vegas, or whatever,

223
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:1,000
saying, "Don't worry Chris, this is really going to be good." OK?

224
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:13,000
So my concept of what a design studio was probably --

225
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:16,000
I wasn't up to speed on where these guys were.

226
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
However, the engineers back in Munich

227
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:23,000
had taken on this kind of Newtonian solution,

228
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and they were trying to find how many cup holders

229
0:12:25,000 --> 0:12:27,000
can dance on the head of a pin, and, you know,

230
0:12:27,000 --> 0:12:32,000
these really serious questions that are confronting the modern consumer.

231
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And one was hoping that these two teams would get together,

232
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and this collusion of incredible creativity,

233
0:12:37,000 --> 0:12:39,000
under these incredible surroundings,

234
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and these incredibly stressed-out engineers,

235
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:45,000
would create some incredible solutions.

236
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Well, what I didn't know was, and what we found out was --

237
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:53,000
these guys, they can't even like talk to each other under those conditions.

238
0:12:53,000 --> 0:12:57,000
You get a divergence of Newtonian and quantum thinking at that point,

239
0:12:57,000 --> 0:13:03,000
you have a split in your dialog that is so deep, and so far,

240
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:07,000
that they cannot bring this together at all.

241
0:13:07,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And so we had our first meeting, after three months, in Tiburon,

242
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:14,000
which is just up the road from here -- you know Tiburon?

243
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And the idea was after the first three months of this independent research

244
0:13:17,000 --> 0:13:19,000
they would present it all to Dr. Goschel --

245
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:22,000
who is now my boss, and at that time he was co-mentor on the project --

246
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and they would present their results.

247
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:26,000
We would see where we were going,

248
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
we would see the first indication of what could be

249
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:32,000
the successive phenomenon to the SUV in America.

250
0:13:32,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And so I had these ideas in my head, that this is going to be great.

251
0:13:35,000 --> 0:13:37,000
I mean, I'm going to see so much work, it's so intense --

252
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:4,000
I know probably Las Vegas meant a lot about it,

253
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and I'm not really sure where the Grand Canyon came in either --

254
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:45,000
but somehow all this is going to come together,

255
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and I'm going to see some really great product.

256
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:49,000
So we went to Tiburon, after three months,

257
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and the team had gotten together the week before,

258
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:55,000
many days ahead of time.

259
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:59,000
The engineers flew over, and designers got together with them,

260
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and they put their presentation together.

261
0:14:02,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Well, it turns out that the engineers hadn't done anything.

262
0:14:08,000 --> 0:14:11,000
And they hadn't done anything because --

263
0:14:11,000 --> 0:14:16,000
kind of, like in car business, engineers are there to solve problems,

264
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and we were asking them to create a problem.

265
0:14:19,000 --> 0:14:22,000
And the engineers were waiting for the designers to say,

266
0:14:22,000 --> 0:14:26,000
"This is the problem that we've created, now help us solve it."

267
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And they couldn't talk about it. So what happened was,

268
0:14:3,000 --> 0:14:33,000
the engineers showed up with nothing.

269
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And the engineers told the designers,

270
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:39,000
"If you go in with all your stuff, we'll walk out,

271
0:14:39,000 --> 0:14:42,000
we'll walk right out of the project."

272
0:14:42,000 --> 0:14:44,000
So I didn't know any of this,

273
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and we got a presentation that had an agenda, looked like this.

274
0:14:46,000 --> 0:14:49,000
There was a whole lot of dialog.

275
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:52,000
We spent four hours being told all about vocabulary

276
0:14:52,000 --> 0:14:56,000
that needs to be built between engineers and designers.

277
0:14:56,000 --> 0:14:59,000
And here I'm expecting at any moment, "OK, they're going to turn the page,

278
0:14:59,000 --> 0:15:01,000
and I'm going to see the cars, I'm going to see the sketches,

279
0:15:01,000 --> 0:15:04,000
I'm going to see maybe some idea of where it's going."

280
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Dialog kept on going, with mental maps of words, and pretty soon

281
0:15:09,000 --> 0:15:12,000
it was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance,

282
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:16,000
I was seriously being baffled with bullshit.

283
0:15:16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
And if you can imagine what this is like,

284
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:22,000
to have these months of postcard indication of how great this team is working,

285
0:15:22,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and they're out there spending all this money, and they're learning,

286
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:27,000
and they're doing all this stuff.

287
0:15:27,000 --> 0:15:33,000
I went fucking ballistic, right? I went nuts.

288
0:15:33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
You can probably remember Tiburon, it used to look like this.

289
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:43,000
After four hours of this, I stood up, and I took this team apart.

290
0:15:43,000 --> 0:15:47,000
I screamed at them, I yelled at them, "What the hell are you doing?

291
0:15:47,000 --> 0:15:49,000
You're letting me down, you're my designers,

292
0:15:49,000 --> 0:15:51,000
you're supposed to be the creative ones,

293
0:15:51,000 --> 0:15:53,000
what the hell is going on around here?"

294
0:15:53,000 --> 0:15:56,000
It was probably one of my better tirades, I have some good ones,

295
0:15:56,000 --> 0:15:59,000
but this was probably one of my better ones. And I went into these people;

296
0:15:59,000 --> 0:16:01,000
how could they take BMW's money,

297
0:16:01,000 --> 0:16:07,000
how could they have a holiday for three months and produce nothing, nothing?

298
0:16:07,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Because of course they didn't tell us that they had three station wagons

299
0:16:12,000 --> 0:16:19,000
full of drawings, model concepts, pictures -- everything I wanted,

300
0:16:19,000 --> 0:16:24,000
they'd locked up in the cars, because they had shown solidarity with the engineers --

301
0:16:24,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and they'd decided not to show me anything,

302
0:16:27,000 --> 0:16:3,000
in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start,

303
0:16:3,000 --> 0:16:32,000
because they hadn't realized, of course,

304
0:16:32,000 --> 0:16:34,000
that they couldn't do problem creating.

305
0:16:34,000 --> 0:16:36,000
So we went to lunch --

306
0:16:36,000 --> 0:16:41,000
(Laughter)

307
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:44,000
And I've got to tell you, this was one seriously quiet lunch.

308
0:16:44,000 --> 0:16:46,000
The engineers all sat at one end of the table,

309
0:16:46,000 --> 0:16:49,000
the designers and I sat at the other end of the table, really quiet.

310
0:16:49,000 --> 0:16:56,000
And I was just fucking furious, furious. OK?

311
0:16:56,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Probably because they had all the fun and I didn't, you know.

312
0:16:58,000 --> 0:17:,000
That's what you get furious about right?

313
0:17:,000 --> 0:17:02,000
And somebody asked me about Catherine, my wife, you know,

314
0:17:02,000 --> 0:17:04,000
did she fly out with me or something?

315
0:17:04,000 --> 0:17:08,000
I said, "No," and it triggered a set of thoughts about my wife.

316
0:17:08,000 --> 0:17:12,000
And I recalled that when Catherine and I were married,

317
0:17:12,000 --> 0:17:17,000
the priest gave a very nice sermon, and he said something very important.

318
0:17:17,000 --> 0:17:2,000
He said, "Love is not selfish," he said,

319
0:17:2,000 --> 0:17:24,000
"Love does not mean counting how many times I say, 'I love you.'

320
0:17:24,000 --> 0:17:27,000
It doesn't mean you had sex this many times this month,

321
0:17:27,000 --> 0:17:29,000
and it's two times less than last month,

322
0:17:29,000 --> 0:17:31,000
so that means you don't love me as much.

323
0:17:31,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Love is not selfish." And I thought about this, and I thought,

324
0:17:36,000 --> 0:17:44,000
"You know, I'm not showing love here. I'm seriously not showing love.

325
0:17:44,000 --> 0:17:48,000
I'm in the air, I'm in the air without trust.

326
0:17:48,000 --> 0:17:53,000
This cannot be. This cannot be that I'm expecting a certain number of sketches,

327
0:17:53,000 --> 0:17:58,000
and to me that's my quantification method for qualifying a team.

328
0:17:58,000 --> 0:18:,000
This cannot be."

329
0:18:,000 --> 0:18:03,000
So I told them this story. I said, "Guys, I'm thinking about something here,

330
0:18:03,000 --> 0:18:07,000
this isn't right. I can't have a relationship with you guys

331
0:18:07,000 --> 0:18:1,000
based on a premise that is a quantifiable one.

332
0:18:1,000 --> 0:18:18,000
Based on a dictate premise that says, 'I'm a boss, you do what I say, without trust.'"

333
0:18:18,000 --> 0:18:2,000
I said "This can't be."

334
0:18:2,000 --> 0:18:26,000
Actually, we all broke down into tears, to be quite honest about it,

335
0:18:26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
because they still could not tell me how much frustration they had built up

336
0:18:31,000 --> 0:18:35,000
inside of them, not being able to show me what I wanted,

337
0:18:35,000 --> 0:18:4,000
and merely having to ask me to trust them that it would come.

338
0:18:4,000 --> 0:18:43,000
And I think we felt much closer that day,

339
0:18:43,000 --> 0:18:46,000
we cut a lot of strings that didn't need to be there,

340
0:18:46,000 --> 0:18:51,000
and we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about.

341
0:18:51,000 --> 0:18:55,000
We put the car back at the center of our thoughts, and we put love,

342
0:18:55,000 --> 0:18:59,000
I think, truly back into the center of the process.

343
0:18:59,000 --> 0:19:02,000
By the way, that team went on to create six different concepts

344
0:19:02,000 --> 0:19:05,000
for the next model of what would be the proposal

345
0:19:05,000 --> 0:19:08,000
for the next generation after SUVs in America.

346
0:19:08,000 --> 0:19:12,000
One of those was the idea of a crossover coupes --

347
0:19:12,000 --> 0:19:17,000
you see it downstairs, the X Coupe -- they had a lot of fun with that.

348
0:19:17,000 --> 0:19:2,000
It was the rendition of our motorcycle,

349
0:19:2,000 --> 0:19:24,000
the GS, as Carl Magnusson says, "brute-iful,"

350
0:19:24,000 --> 0:19:29,000
as the idea of what could be a motorcycle, if you add two more wheels.

351
0:19:29,000 --> 0:19:33,000
And so, in conclusion, my lesson that I wanted to pass on to you,

352
0:19:33,000 --> 0:19:37,000
was this one here. I'm also going to steal a little quote out of "Little Prince."

353
0:19:37,000 --> 0:19:4,000
There's a lot to be said about trust and love,

354
0:19:4,000 --> 0:19:43,000
if you know that those two words are synonymous for design.

355
0:19:43,000 --> 0:19:47,000
I had a very, very meaningful relationship with my team that day,

356
0:19:47,000 --> 0:19:49,000
and it's stayed that way ever since.

357
0:19:49,000 --> 0:19:53,000
And I hope that you too find that there's more to design,

358
0:19:53,000 --> 0:19:57,000
and more towards the art of the design, than doing it yourself.

359
0:19:57,000 --> 0:20:01,000
It's true that the trust and the love, that makes it worthwhile.

360
0:20:01,000 --> 0:20:03,000
Thanks so much.

361
0:20:03,000 --> 0:20:05,000
(Applause)

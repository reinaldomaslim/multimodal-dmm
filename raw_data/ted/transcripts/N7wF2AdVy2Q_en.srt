1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Late in January 1975,

2
0:00:15.4,000 --> 0:00:19,000
a 17-year-old German girl called Vera Brandes

3
0:00:19.84,000 --> 0:00:22,000
walked out onto the stage of the Cologne Opera House.

4
0:00:24.24,000 --> 0:00:26,000
The auditorium was empty.

5
0:00:27.04,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It was lit only by the dim, green glow of the emergency exit sign.

6
0:00:32.2,000 --> 0:00:35,000
This was the most exciting day of Vera's life.

7
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
She was the youngest concert promoter in Germany,

8
0:00:39.2,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and she had persuaded the Cologne Opera House

9
0:00:41.64,000 --> 0:00:44,000
to host a late-night concert of jazz

10
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:47,000
from the American musician, Keith Jarrett.

11
0:00:48.8,000 --> 0:00:51,000
1,400 people were coming.

12
0:00:51.84,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And in just a few hours,

13
0:00:53.44,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Jarrett would walk out on the same stage,

14
0:00:55.88,000 --> 0:00:56,000
he'd sit down at the piano

15
0:00:57.24,000 --> 0:01:,000
and without rehearsal or sheet music,

16
0:01:01.08,000 --> 0:01:02,000
he would begin to play.

17
0:01:04.32,000 --> 0:01:05,000
But right now,

18
0:01:05.56,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Vera was introducing Keith to the piano in question,

19
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and it wasn't going well.

20
0:01:11.12,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Jarrett looked to the instrument a little warily,

21
0:01:13.8,000 --> 0:01:14,000
played a few notes,

22
0:01:15.36,000 --> 0:01:16,000
walked around it,

23
0:01:16.599,000 --> 0:01:17,000
played a few more notes,

24
0:01:18.08,000 --> 0:01:19,000
muttered something to his producer.

25
0:01:19.8,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Then the producer came over to Vera and said ...

26
0:01:24.28,000 --> 0:01:27,000
"If you don't get a new piano, Keith can't play."

27
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:31,000
There'd been a mistake.

28
0:01:31.48,000 --> 0:01:33,000
The opera house had provided the wrong instrument.

29
0:01:33.88,000 --> 0:01:35,000
This one had this harsh, tinny upper register,

30
0:01:36.56,000 --> 0:01:38,000
because all the felt had worn away.

31
0:01:39.64,000 --> 0:01:42,000
The black notes were sticking,

32
0:01:42.8,000 --> 0:01:43,000
the white notes were out of tune,

33
0:01:44.72,000 --> 0:01:45,000
the pedals didn't work

34
0:01:46.4,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and the piano itself was just too small.

35
0:01:48.6,000 --> 0:01:49,000
It wouldn't create the volume

36
0:01:50.04,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that would fill a large space such as the Cologne Opera House.

37
0:01:54.52,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So Keith Jarrett left.

38
0:01:58.4,000 --> 0:01:59,000
He went and sat outside in his car,

39
0:02:01.04,000 --> 0:02:02,000
leaving Vera Brandes

40
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:06,000
to get on the phone to try to find a replacement piano.

41
0:02:07.68,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Now she got a piano tuner,

42
0:02:09.32,000 --> 0:02:1,000
but she couldn't get a new piano.

43
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And so she went outside

44
0:02:14.88,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and she stood there in the rain,

45
0:02:17.52,000 --> 0:02:18,000
talking to Keith Jarrett,

46
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:23,000
begging him not to cancel the concert.

47
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And he looked out of his car

48
0:02:25.6,000 --> 0:02:28,000
at this bedraggled, rain-drenched German teenager,

49
0:02:30.28,000 --> 0:02:31,000
took pity on her,

50
0:02:32.08,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and said,

51
0:02:33.96,000 --> 0:02:36,000
"Never forget ... only for you."

52
0:02:39.12,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And so a few hours later,

53
0:02:40.92,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Jarrett did indeed step out onto the stage of the opera house,

54
0:02:45.4,000 --> 0:02:48,000
he sat down at the unplayable piano

55
0:02:49.6,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and began.

56
0:02:51.32,000 --> 0:02:53,000
(Music)

57
0:03:04.72,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Within moments it became clear that something magical was happening.

58
0:03:10.08,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Jarrett was avoiding those upper registers,

59
0:03:12.68,000 --> 0:03:14,000
he was sticking to the middle tones of the keyboard,

60
0:03:15.32,000 --> 0:03:19,000
which gave the piece a soothing, ambient quality.

61
0:03:19.96,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But also, because the piano was so quiet,

62
0:03:22.52,000 --> 0:03:26,000
he had to set up these rumbling, repetitive riffs in the bass.

63
0:03:26.96,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And he stood up twisting, pounding down on the keys,

64
0:03:32.24,000 --> 0:03:37,000
desperately trying to create enough volume to reach the people in the back row.

65
0:03:37.88,000 --> 0:03:39,000
It's an electrifying performance.

66
0:03:39.92,000 --> 0:03:41,000
It somehow has this peaceful quality,

67
0:03:42.88,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and at the same time it's full of energy,

68
0:03:44.96,000 --> 0:03:45,000
it's dynamic.

69
0:03:47.2,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And the audience loved it.

70
0:03:49.56,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Audiences continue to love it

71
0:03:51.24,000 --> 0:03:54,000
because the recording of the Köln Concert

72
0:03:54.36,000 --> 0:03:56,000
is the best-selling piano album in history

73
0:03:56.88,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and the best-selling solo jazz album in history.

74
0:04:02.56,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Keith Jarrett had been handed a mess.

75
0:04:06.28,000 --> 0:04:09,000
He had embraced that mess, and it soared.

76
0:04:12.52,000 --> 0:04:16,000
But let's think for a moment about Jarrett's initial instinct.

77
0:04:17.36,000 --> 0:04:18,000
He didn't want to play.

78
0:04:18.96,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Of course,

79
0:04:20.2,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I think any of us, in any remotely similar situation,

80
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
would feel the same way, we'd have the same instinct.

81
0:04:25.76,000 --> 0:04:28,000
We don't want to be asked to do good work with bad tools.

82
0:04:29.079,000 --> 0:04:32,000
We don't want to have to overcome unnecessary hurdles.

83
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
But Jarrett's instinct was wrong,

84
0:04:37.12,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and thank goodness he changed his mind.

85
0:04:39.84,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And I think our instinct is also wrong.

86
0:04:44.8,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I think we need to gain a bit more appreciation

87
0:04:48.24,000 --> 0:04:53,000
for the unexpected advantages of having to cope with a little mess.

88
0:04:55.56,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So let me give you some examples

89
0:04:57.72,000 --> 0:04:59,000
from cognitive psychology,

90
0:05:00.2,000 --> 0:05:01,000
from complexity science,

91
0:05:01.64,000 --> 0:05:02,000
from social psychology,

92
0:05:03.12,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and of course, rock 'n' roll.

93
0:05:05.68,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So cognitive psychology first.

94
0:05:07.76,000 --> 0:05:08,000
We've actually known for a while

95
0:05:09.6,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that certain kinds of difficulty,

96
0:05:11.96,000 --> 0:05:12,000
certain kinds of obstacle,

97
0:05:13.56,000 --> 0:05:14,000
can actually improve our performance.

98
0:05:15.346,000 --> 0:05:16,000
For example,

99
0:05:17.08,000 --> 0:05:18,000
the psychologist Daniel Oppenheimer,

100
0:05:18.84,000 --> 0:05:19,000
a few years ago,

101
0:05:20.08,000 --> 0:05:22,000
teamed up with high school teachers.

102
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And he asked them to reformat the handouts

103
0:05:24.92,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that they were giving to some of their classes.

104
0:05:28.2,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So the regular handout would be formatted in something straightforward,

105
0:05:31.558,000 --> 0:05:33,000
such as Helvetica or Times New Roman.

106
0:05:34.84,000 --> 0:05:37,000
But half these classes were getting handouts that were formatted

107
0:05:37.88,000 --> 0:05:4,000
in something sort of intense, like Haettenschweiler,

108
0:05:41.6,000 --> 0:05:45,000
or something with a zesty bounce, like Comic Sans italicized.

109
0:05:45.64,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Now, these are really ugly fonts,

110
0:05:47.48,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and they're difficult fonts to read.

111
0:05:49.68,000 --> 0:05:51,000
But at the end of the semester,

112
0:05:51.8,000 --> 0:05:53,000
students were given exams,

113
0:05:54.44,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and the students who'd been asked to read the more difficult fonts,

114
0:05:58.12,000 --> 0:06:,000
had actually done better on their exams,

115
0:06:00.2,000 --> 0:06:01,000
in a variety of subjects.

116
0:06:01.76,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And the reason is,

117
0:06:03.8,000 --> 0:06:05,000
the difficult font had slowed them down,

118
0:06:06.36,000 --> 0:06:08,000
forced them to work a bit harder,

119
0:06:08.44,000 --> 0:06:1,000
to think a bit more about what they were reading,

120
0:06:11.04,000 --> 0:06:12,000
to interpret it ...

121
0:06:13.36,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and so they learned more.

122
0:06:16.32,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Another example.

123
0:06:18.76,000 --> 0:06:23,000
The psychologist Shelley Carson has been testing Harvard undergraduates

124
0:06:23.88,000 --> 0:06:25,000
for the quality of their attentional filters.

125
0:06:26.88,000 --> 0:06:27,000
What do I mean by that?

126
0:06:28.28,000 --> 0:06:3,000
What I mean is, imagine you're in a restaurant,

127
0:06:30.52,000 --> 0:06:31,000
you're having a conversation,

128
0:06:32.28,000 --> 0:06:35,000
there are all kinds of other conversations going on in the restaurant,

129
0:06:35.44,000 --> 0:06:36,000
you want to filter them out,

130
0:06:36.8,000 --> 0:06:38,000
you want to focus on what's important to you.

131
0:06:38.96,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Can you do that?

132
0:06:40.2,000 --> 0:06:42,000
If you can, you have good, strong attentional filters.

133
0:06:43.2,000 --> 0:06:45,000
But some people really struggle with that.

134
0:06:45.28,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Some of Carson's undergraduate subjects struggled with that.

135
0:06:49.04,000 --> 0:06:51,000
They had weak filters, they had porous filters --

136
0:06:52,000 --> 0:06:55,000
let a lot of external information in.

137
0:06:55.4,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And so what that meant is they were constantly being interrupted

138
0:06:58.56,000 --> 0:07:,000
by the sights and the sounds of the world around them.

139
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
If there was a television on while they were doing their essays,

140
0:07:04.24,000 --> 0:07:05,000
they couldn't screen it out.

141
0:07:05.68,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Now, you would think that that was a disadvantage ...

142
0:07:09.48,000 --> 0:07:1,000
but no.

143
0:07:10.72,000 --> 0:07:13,000
When Carson looked at what these students had achieved,

144
0:07:14.72,000 --> 0:07:15,000
the ones with the weak filters

145
0:07:16.52,000 --> 0:07:18,000
were vastly more likely

146
0:07:18.96,000 --> 0:07:2,000
to have some real creative milestone in their lives,

147
0:07:21.76,000 --> 0:07:23,000
to have published their first novel,

148
0:07:24.12,000 --> 0:07:25,000
to have released their first album.

149
0:07:27.2,000 --> 0:07:3,000
These distractions were actually grists to their creative mill.

150
0:07:30.92,000 --> 0:07:33,000
They were able to think outside the box because their box was full of holes.

151
0:07:36.2,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Let's talk about complexity science.

152
0:07:37.96,000 --> 0:07:38,000
So how do you solve a really complex --

153
0:07:39.842,000 --> 0:07:41,000
the world's full of complicated problems --

154
0:07:41.88,000 --> 0:07:43,000
how do you solve a really complicated problem?

155
0:07:44.08,000 --> 0:07:46,000
For example, you try to make a jet engine.

156
0:07:46.24,000 --> 0:07:48,000
There are lots and lots of different variables,

157
0:07:48.48,000 --> 0:07:49,000
the operating temperature, the materials,

158
0:07:50.457,000 --> 0:07:52,000
all the different dimensions, the shape.

159
0:07:52.92,000 --> 0:07:54,000
You can't solve that kind of problem all in one go,

160
0:07:55.48,000 --> 0:07:56,000
it's too hard.

161
0:07:56.72,000 --> 0:07:57,000
So what do you do?

162
0:07:57.96,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Well, one thing you can do is try to solve it step-by-step.

163
0:08:02.92,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So you have some kind of prototype

164
0:08:04.64,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and you tweak it, you test it, you improve it.

165
0:08:08.08,000 --> 0:08:1,000
You tweak it, you test it, you improve it.

166
0:08:12.04,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Now, this idea of marginal gains will eventually get you a good jet engine.

167
0:08:17.56,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And it's been quite widely implemented in the world.

168
0:08:20.88,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So you'll hear about it, for example, in high performance cycling,

169
0:08:24.4,000 --> 0:08:27,000
web designers will talk about trying to optimize their web pages,

170
0:08:27.72,000 --> 0:08:29,000
they're looking for these step-by-step gains.

171
0:08:30.04,000 --> 0:08:32,000
That's a good way to solve a complicated problem.

172
0:08:34.44,000 --> 0:08:36,000
But you know what would make it a better way?

173
0:08:38.6,000 --> 0:08:39,000
A dash of mess.

174
0:08:41.32,000 --> 0:08:43,000
You add randomness,

175
0:08:43.36,000 --> 0:08:44,000
early on in the process,

176
0:08:44.76,000 --> 0:08:45,000
you make crazy moves,

177
0:08:46.28,000 --> 0:08:49,000
you try stupid things that shouldn't work,

178
0:08:49.679,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and that will tend to make the problem-solving work better.

179
0:08:52.72,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And the reason for that is

180
0:08:54.28,000 --> 0:08:56,000
the trouble with the step-by-step process,

181
0:08:56.36,000 --> 0:08:57,000
the marginal gains,

182
0:08:57.6,000 --> 0:09:,000
is they can walk you gradually down a dead end.

183
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And if you start with the randomness, that becomes less likely,

184
0:09:05.4,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and your problem-solving becomes more robust.

185
0:09:10.44,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Let's talk about social psychology.

186
0:09:12.72,000 --> 0:09:15,000
So the psychologist Katherine Phillips, with some colleagues,

187
0:09:15.84,000 --> 0:09:19,000
recently gave murder mystery problems to some students,

188
0:09:19.92,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and these students were collected in groups of four

189
0:09:22.8,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and they were given dossiers with information about a crime --

190
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
alibis and evidence, witness statements and three suspects.

191
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And the groups of four students were asked to figure out who did it,

192
0:09:35.2,000 --> 0:09:36,000
who committed the crime.

193
0:09:37.28,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And there were two treatments in this experiment.

194
0:09:40.76,000 --> 0:09:43,000
In some cases these were four friends,

195
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:45,000
they all knew each other well.

196
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
In other cases,

197
0:09:47.96,000 --> 0:09:48,000
three friends and a stranger.

198
0:09:51.04,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And you can see where I'm going with this.

199
0:09:53.12,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Obviously I'm going to say

200
0:09:54.4,000 --> 0:09:57,000
that the groups with the stranger solved the problem more effectively,

201
0:09:57.84,000 --> 0:09:58,000
which is true, they did.

202
0:09:59.8,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Actually, they solved the problem quite a lot more effectively.

203
0:10:03.32,000 --> 0:10:05,000
So the groups of four friends,

204
0:10:07.12,000 --> 0:10:09,000
they only had a 50-50 chance of getting the answer right.

205
0:10:10.12,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Which is actually not that great --

206
0:10:11.84,000 --> 0:10:13,000
in multiple choice, for three answers? 50-50's not good.

207
0:10:14.8,000 --> 0:10:15,000
(Laughter)

208
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
The three friends and the stranger,

209
0:10:17.72,000 --> 0:10:19,000
even though the stranger didn't have any extra information,

210
0:10:20.56,000 --> 0:10:21,000
even though it was just a case

211
0:10:22.12,000 --> 0:10:28,000
of how that changed the conversation to accommodate that awkwardness,

212
0:10:28.44,000 --> 0:10:29,000
the three friends and the stranger,

213
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
they had a 75 percent chance of finding the right answer.

214
0:10:32.85,000 --> 0:10:33,000
That's quite a big leap in performance.

215
0:10:34.6,000 --> 0:10:36,000
But I think what's really interesting

216
0:10:36.96,000 --> 0:10:39,000
is not just that the three friends and the stranger did a better job,

217
0:10:40.223,000 --> 0:10:41,000
but how they felt about it.

218
0:10:42.4,000 --> 0:10:46,000
So when Katherine Phillips interviewed the groups of four friends,

219
0:10:47.36,000 --> 0:10:48,000
they had a nice time,

220
0:10:49.24,000 --> 0:10:5,000
they also thought they'd done a good job.

221
0:10:52.72,000 --> 0:10:53,000
They were complacent.

222
0:10:54.8,000 --> 0:10:56,000
When she spoke to the three friends and the stranger,

223
0:10:57.32,000 --> 0:10:58,000
they had not had a nice time --

224
0:10:58.84,000 --> 0:11:,000
it's actually rather difficult, it's rather awkward ...

225
0:11:02.48,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and they were full of doubt.

226
0:11:06.2,000 --> 0:11:08,000
They didn't think they'd done a good job even though they had.

227
0:11:10.08,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And I think that really exemplifies

228
0:11:11.84,000 --> 0:11:13,000
the challenge that we're dealing with here.

229
0:11:14.68,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Because, yeah --

230
0:11:16.52,000 --> 0:11:17,000
the ugly font,

231
0:11:18.4,000 --> 0:11:19,000
the awkward stranger,

232
0:11:20.2,000 --> 0:11:21,000
the random move ...

233
0:11:22.28,000 --> 0:11:25,000
these disruptions help us solve problems,

234
0:11:25.68,000 --> 0:11:27,000
they help us become more creative.

235
0:11:28.04,000 --> 0:11:3,000
But we don't feel that they're helping us.

236
0:11:30.12,000 --> 0:11:32,000
We feel that they're getting in the way ...

237
0:11:33.04,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and so we resist.

238
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And that's why the last example is really important.

239
0:11:39.36,000 --> 0:11:41,000
So I want to talk about somebody

240
0:11:41.6,000 --> 0:11:45,000
from the background of the world of rock 'n' roll.

241
0:11:46.56,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And you may know him, he's actually a TED-ster.

242
0:11:49.48,000 --> 0:11:5,000
His name is Brian Eno.

243
0:11:50.88,000 --> 0:11:52,000
He is an ambient composer -- rather brilliant.

244
0:11:53.72,000 --> 0:11:55,000
He's also a kind of catalyst

245
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
behind some of the great rock 'n' roll albums of the last 40 years.

246
0:12:01.2,000 --> 0:12:04,000
He's worked with David Bowie on "Heroes,"

247
0:12:04.84,000 --> 0:12:07,000
he worked with U2 on "Achtung Baby" and "The Joshua Tree,"

248
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:09,000
he's worked with DEVO,

249
0:12:09.56,000 --> 0:12:11,000
he's worked with Coldplay, he's worked with everybody.

250
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And what does he do to make these great rock bands better?

251
0:12:17.72,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Well, he makes a mess.

252
0:12:19.84,000 --> 0:12:2,000
He disrupts their creative processes.

253
0:12:21.68,000 --> 0:12:23,000
It's his role to be the awkward stranger.

254
0:12:23.8,000 --> 0:12:24,000
It's his role to tell them

255
0:12:25.24,000 --> 0:12:28,000
that they have to play the unplayable piano.

256
0:12:28.44,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And one of the ways in which he creates this disruption

257
0:12:31.12,000 --> 0:12:33,000
is through this remarkable deck of cards --

258
0:12:34.68,000 --> 0:12:36,000
I have my signed copy here -- thank you, Brian.

259
0:12:38.56,000 --> 0:12:39,000
They're called The Oblique Strategies,

260
0:12:40.44,000 --> 0:12:41,000
he developed them with a friend of his.

261
0:12:42.8,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And when they're stuck in the studio,

262
0:12:46.88,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Brian Eno will reach for one of the cards.

263
0:12:49.2,000 --> 0:12:5,000
He'll draw one at random,

264
0:12:50.68,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and he'll make the band follow the instructions on the card.

265
0:12:54.96,000 --> 0:12:55,000
So this one ...

266
0:12:57.04,000 --> 0:12:58,000
"Change instrument roles."

267
0:12:58.36,000 --> 0:13:,000
Yeah, everyone swap instruments -- Drummer on the piano --

268
0:13:01.099,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Brilliant, brilliant idea.

269
0:13:03.12,000 --> 0:13:06,000
"Look closely at the most embarrassing details. Amplify them."

270
0:13:08.36,000 --> 0:13:12,000
"Make a sudden, destructive, unpredictable action. Incorporate."

271
0:13:14.96,000 --> 0:13:15,000
These cards are disruptive.

272
0:13:17.08,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Now, they've proved their worth in album after album.

273
0:13:21.88,000 --> 0:13:23,000
The musicians hate them.

274
0:13:24.2,000 --> 0:13:25,000
(Laughter)

275
0:13:25.72,000 --> 0:13:28,000
So Phil Collins was playing drums on an early Brian Eno album.

276
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
He got so frustrated he started throwing beer cans across the studio.

277
0:13:34.4,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Carlos Alomar, great rock guitarist,

278
0:13:36.8,000 --> 0:13:39,000
working with Eno on David Bowie's "Lodger" album,

279
0:13:40.6,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and at one point he turns to Brian and says,

280
0:13:43.2,000 --> 0:13:46,000
"Brian, this experiment is stupid."

281
0:13:49.36,000 --> 0:13:51,000
But the thing is it was a pretty good album,

282
0:13:53.12,000 --> 0:13:54,000
but also,

283
0:13:55.04,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Carlos Alomar, 35 years later, now uses The Oblique Strategies.

284
0:13:59.88,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And he tells his students to use The Oblique Strategies

285
0:14:02.64,000 --> 0:14:03,000
because he's realized something.

286
0:14:05.24,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it isn't helping you.

287
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:14,000
The strategies actually weren't a deck of cards originally,

288
0:14:14.786,000 --> 0:14:15,000
they were just a list --

289
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
list on the recording studio wall.

290
0:14:17.84,000 --> 0:14:2,000
A checklist of things you might try if you got stuck.

291
0:14:23.28,000 --> 0:14:24,000
The list didn't work.

292
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Know why?

293
0:14:29.4,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Not messy enough.

294
0:14:31.68,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Your eye would go down the list

295
0:14:33.72,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and it would settle on whatever was the least disruptive,

296
0:14:37.8,000 --> 0:14:38,000
the least troublesome,

297
0:14:40.48,000 --> 0:14:43,000
which of course misses the point entirely.

298
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
And what Brian Eno came to realize was,

299
0:14:48.56,000 --> 0:14:52,000
yes, we need to run the stupid experiments,

300
0:14:53.08,000 --> 0:14:55,000
we need to deal with the awkward strangers,

301
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
we need to try to read the ugly fonts.

302
0:14:57.32,000 --> 0:14:58,000
These things help us.

303
0:14:58.6,000 --> 0:14:59,000
They help us solve problems,

304
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:01,000
they help us be more creative.

305
0:15:01.92,000 --> 0:15:02,000
But also ...

306
0:15:04.32,000 --> 0:15:07,000
we really need some persuasion if we're going to accept this.

307
0:15:08.2,000 --> 0:15:09,000
So however we do it ...

308
0:15:10.4,000 --> 0:15:12,000
whether it's sheer willpower,

309
0:15:12.48,000 --> 0:15:14,000
whether it's the flip of a card

310
0:15:15.56,000 --> 0:15:18,000
or whether it's a guilt trip from a German teenager,

311
0:15:19.68,000 --> 0:15:21,000
all of us, from time to time,

312
0:15:21.84,000 --> 0:15:25,000
need to sit down and try and play the unplayable piano.

313
0:15:27.64,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Thank you.

314
0:15:28.88,000 --> 0:15:29,000
(Applause)

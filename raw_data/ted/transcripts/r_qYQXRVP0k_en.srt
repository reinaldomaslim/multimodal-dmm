1
0:00:12.498,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So I'd like you to come back with me

2
0:00:15.157,000 --> 0:00:16,000
just for a few minutes

3
0:00:17.058,000 --> 0:00:19,000
to a dark night in China,

4
0:00:19.927,000 --> 0:00:21,000
the night I met my husband.

5
0:00:22.648,000 --> 0:00:25,000
It was a city so long ago that it was still called

6
0:00:26.091,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Peking.

7
0:00:28.204,000 --> 0:00:3,000
So I went to a party.

8
0:00:30.825,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I sat down next to a stout, middle-aged man

9
0:00:34.208,000 --> 0:00:37,000
with owl glasses and a bow tie,

10
0:00:37.722,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and he turned out to be a Fulbright scholar,

11
0:00:40.615,000 --> 0:00:43,000
there in China specifically to study

12
0:00:44.179,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Sino-Soviet relations.

13
0:00:46.27,000 --> 0:00:48,000
What a gift it was to the eager,

14
0:00:48.67,000 --> 0:00:5,000
young foreign correspondent that I was then.

15
0:00:51.428,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I'd pump him for information,

16
0:00:53.436,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I'm mentally scribbling notes

17
0:00:55.093,000 --> 0:00:57,000
for the stories I plan to write.

18
0:00:57.402,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I talk to him for hours.

19
0:00:59.887,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Only months later,

20
0:01:03.398,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I discover who he really was.

21
0:01:05.772,000 --> 0:01:07,000
He was the China representative

22
0:01:08.545,000 --> 0:01:12,000
for the American Soybean Association.

23
0:01:12.774,000 --> 0:01:15,000
"I don't understand. Soybeans?

24
0:01:16.044,000 --> 0:01:18,000
You told me you were a Fulbright scholar."

25
0:01:18.799,000 --> 0:01:19,000
"Well, how long would you have talked to me

26
0:01:20.687,000 --> 0:01:22,000
if I told you we're in soybeans?"

27
0:01:22.729,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:25.21,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I said, "You jerk."

29
0:01:28.502,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Only jerk wasn't the word I used.

30
0:01:32.255,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I said, "You could've gotten me fired."

31
0:01:36.402,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And he said, "Let's get married."

32
0:01:39.939,000 --> 0:01:4,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:41.226,000 --> 0:01:43,000
"Travel the world and have lots of kids."

34
0:01:44.122,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So we did.

35
0:01:46.22,000 --> 0:01:48,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:48.265,000 --> 0:01:53,000
(Applause)

37
0:01:53.507,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And what an alive man Terence Bryan Foley

38
0:01:57.247,000 --> 0:01:58,000
turned out to be.

39
0:01:58.694,000 --> 0:01:59,000
He was a Chinese scholar

40
0:02:00.337,000 --> 0:02:01,000
who later, in his 60s,

41
0:02:02.203,000 --> 0:02:04,000
got a Ph.D. in Chinese history.

42
0:02:04.755,000 --> 0:02:06,000
He spoke six languages,

43
0:02:07.243,000 --> 0:02:09,000
he played 15 musical instruments,

44
0:02:09.731,000 --> 0:02:1,000
he was a licensed pilot,

45
0:02:11.507,000 --> 0:02:14,000
he had once been a San Francisco cable car operator,

46
0:02:14.678,000 --> 0:02:16,000
he was an expert in swine nutrition,

47
0:02:17.512,000 --> 0:02:2,000
dairy cattle, Dixieland jazz, film noir,

48
0:02:21.293,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and we did travel the country, and the world,

49
0:02:25.477,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and we did have a lot of kids.

50
0:02:27.706,000 --> 0:02:28,000
We followed my job, and it seemed like

51
0:02:29.448,000 --> 0:02:32,000
there was nothing that we couldn't do.

52
0:02:33.015,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So when we found the cancer,

53
0:02:36.797,000 --> 0:02:38,000
it doesn't seem strange to us at all

54
0:02:39.362,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that without saying a word to each other,

55
0:02:41.995,000 --> 0:02:43,000
we believed that,

56
0:02:44.421,000 --> 0:02:46,000
if we were smart enough

57
0:02:46.68,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and strong enough and brave enough,

58
0:02:51.011,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and we worked hard enough,

59
0:02:53.484,000 --> 0:02:58,000
we could keep him from dying ever.

60
0:02:58.762,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And for years, it seemed like we were succeeding.

61
0:03:02.261,000 --> 0:03:04,000
The surgeon emerged from the surgery.

62
0:03:05.14,000 --> 0:03:07,000
What'd he say? He said what surgeons always say:

63
0:03:07.417,000 --> 0:03:09,000
"We got it all."

64
0:03:09.419,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Then there was a setback when the pathologists

65
0:03:12.462,000 --> 0:03:14,000
looked at the kidney cancer closely.

66
0:03:14.835,000 --> 0:03:15,000
It turned out to be a rare,

67
0:03:16.464,000 --> 0:03:17,000
exceedingly aggressive type,

68
0:03:18.273,000 --> 0:03:21,000
with a diagnosis that was almost universally fatal

69
0:03:21.355,000 --> 0:03:23,000
in several weeks at most.

70
0:03:23.746,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And yet, he did not die.

71
0:03:27.456,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Mysteriously, he lived on.

72
0:03:30.966,000 --> 0:03:32,000
He coached Little League for our son.

73
0:03:33.05,000 --> 0:03:35,000
He built a playhouse for our daughter.

74
0:03:35.602,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And meanwhile, I'm burying myself in the Internet

75
0:03:38.676,000 --> 0:03:39,000
looking for specialists.

76
0:03:40.35,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I'm looking for a cure.

77
0:03:42.911,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So a year goes by

78
0:03:44.988,000 --> 0:03:47,000
before the cancer, as cancers do,

79
0:03:48.194,000 --> 0:03:5,000
reappears,

80
0:03:50.194,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and with it comes another death sentence,

81
0:03:52.27,000 --> 0:03:54,000
this time nine months.

82
0:03:54.463,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So we try another treatment, aggressive, nasty.

83
0:03:58.477,000 --> 0:03:59,000
It makes him so sick, he has to quit it,

84
0:04:00.297,000 --> 0:04:03,000
yet still he lives on.

85
0:04:03.314,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Then another year goes by.

86
0:04:05.21,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Two years go by.

87
0:04:06.76,000 --> 0:04:07,000
More specialists.

88
0:04:08.249,000 --> 0:04:09,000
We take the kids to Italy.

89
0:04:10.169,000 --> 0:04:12,000
We take the kids to Australia.

90
0:04:12.638,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And then more years pass,

91
0:04:15.35,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and the cancer begins to grow.

92
0:04:17.74,000 --> 0:04:19,000
This time, there's new treatments on the horizon.

93
0:04:20.275,000 --> 0:04:21,000
They're exotic. They're experimental.

94
0:04:22.211,000 --> 0:04:25,000
They're going to attack the cancer in new ways.

95
0:04:25.419,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So he enters a clinical trial, and it works.

96
0:04:29.745,000 --> 0:04:3,000
The cancer begins to shrink,

97
0:04:31.674,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and for the third time,

98
0:04:33.951,000 --> 0:04:36,000
we've dodged death.

99
0:04:37.31,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So now I ask you,

100
0:04:40.607,000 --> 0:04:42,000
how do I feel

101
0:04:42.996,000 --> 0:04:44,000
when the time finally comes

102
0:04:45.51,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and there's another dark night,

103
0:04:48.016,000 --> 0:04:5,000
sometime between midnight and 2 a.m.?

104
0:04:50.517,000 --> 0:04:52,000
This time it's on the intensive care ward

105
0:04:53.491,000 --> 0:04:54,000
when a twentysomething resident

106
0:04:55.329,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that I've never met before

107
0:04:57.532,000 --> 0:04:59,000
tells me that Terence is dying,

108
0:05:00.125,000 --> 0:05:02,000
perhaps tonight.

109
0:05:02.324,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So what do I say when he says,

110
0:05:05.117,000 --> 0:05:07,000
"What do you want me to do?"

111
0:05:07.931,000 --> 0:05:09,000
There's another drug out there.

112
0:05:09.943,000 --> 0:05:1,000
It's newer. It's more powerful.

113
0:05:11.631,000 --> 0:05:13,000
He started it just two weeks ago.

114
0:05:14.2,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Perhaps there's still hope ahead.

115
0:05:17.309,000 --> 0:05:18,000
So what do I say?

116
0:05:19.264,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I say, "Keep him alive if you can."

117
0:05:22.62,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And Terence died six days later.

118
0:05:26.135,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So we fought, we struggled, we triumphed.

119
0:05:30.183,000 --> 0:05:31,000
It was an exhilarating fight,

120
0:05:31.979,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and I'd repeat the fight today

121
0:05:33.696,000 --> 0:05:35,000
without a moment's hesitation.

122
0:05:36.345,000 --> 0:05:38,000
We fought together, we lived together.

123
0:05:39.296,000 --> 0:05:41,000
It turned what could have been

124
0:05:41.4,000 --> 0:05:43,000
seven of the grimmest years of our life

125
0:05:44.134,000 --> 0:05:47,000
into seven of the most glorious.

126
0:05:47.745,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It was also an expensive fight.

127
0:05:50.52,000 --> 0:05:51,000
It was the kind of fight and the kind of choices

128
0:05:52.481,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that everyone here agrees

129
0:05:54.115,000 --> 0:05:56,000
pump up the cost of end-of-life care,

130
0:05:56.52,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and of healthcare for all of us.

131
0:05:58.806,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And for me, for us,

132
0:06:01.888,000 --> 0:06:03,000
we pushed the fight right over the edge,

133
0:06:03.97,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and I never got the chance to say to him

134
0:06:07.195,000 --> 0:06:1,000
what I say to him now almost every day:

135
0:06:10.615,000 --> 0:06:13,000
"Hey, buddy, it was a hell of a ride."

136
0:06:13.692,000 --> 0:06:15,000
We never got the chance to say goodbye.

137
0:06:16.18,000 --> 0:06:18,000
We never thought it was the end.

138
0:06:18.459,000 --> 0:06:23,000
We always had hope.

139
0:06:23.638,000 --> 0:06:26,000
So what do we make of all of this?

140
0:06:27.502,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Being a journalist, after Terence died,

141
0:06:31.08,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I wrote a book, "The Cost Of Hope."

142
0:06:34.369,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I wrote it because I wanted to know

143
0:06:36.519,000 --> 0:06:37,000
why I did what I did,

144
0:06:38.205,000 --> 0:06:39,000
why he did what he did,

145
0:06:40.006,000 --> 0:06:42,000
why everyone around us did what they did.

146
0:06:42.561,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And what did I discover?

147
0:06:44.197,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Well, one of the things I discovered is that

148
0:06:45.771,000 --> 0:06:48,000
experts think that one answer to

149
0:06:48.848,000 --> 0:06:5,000
what I did at the end was a piece of paper,

150
0:06:51.598,000 --> 0:06:53,000
the advance directive,

151
0:06:53.756,000 --> 0:06:57,000
to help families get past the seemingly irrational choices.

152
0:06:58.096,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Yet I had that piece of paper.

153
0:07:02.21,000 --> 0:07:04,000
We both did.

154
0:07:04.263,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And they were readily available.

155
0:07:05.953,000 --> 0:07:06,000
I had them right at hand.

156
0:07:07.892,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Both of them said the same thing:

157
0:07:10.251,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Do nothing if there is no further hope.

158
0:07:14.752,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I knew Terence's wishes

159
0:07:16.972,000 --> 0:07:19,000
as clearly and as surely as I knew my own.

160
0:07:20.786,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Yet we never got to no further hope.

161
0:07:25.99,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Even with that clear-cut paper in our hands,

162
0:07:28.747,000 --> 0:07:31,000
we just kept redefining hope.

163
0:07:32.003,000 --> 0:07:37,000
I believed I could keep him from dying,

164
0:07:37.295,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and I'd be embarrassed to say that if I hadn't seen

165
0:07:40.109,000 --> 0:07:42,000
so many people and have talked to so many people

166
0:07:42.32,000 --> 0:07:44,000
who have felt exactly the same way.

167
0:07:44.994,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Right up until days before his death,

168
0:07:48.928,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I felt strongly

169
0:07:52.254,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and powerfully, and, you might say, irrationally,

170
0:07:56.297,000 --> 0:08:01,000
that I could keep him from dying ever.

171
0:08:01.544,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Now, what do the experts call this?

172
0:08:04.779,000 --> 0:08:06,000
They say it's denial.

173
0:08:07.126,000 --> 0:08:09,000
It's a strong word, isn't it?

174
0:08:09.317,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Yet I will tell you that denial

175
0:08:11.714,000 --> 0:08:16,000
isn't even close to a strong enough word

176
0:08:16.828,000 --> 0:08:18,000
to describe what those of us

177
0:08:19.474,000 --> 0:08:22,000
facing the death of our loved ones go through.

178
0:08:23.112,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And I hear the medical professionals say,

179
0:08:25.453,000 --> 0:08:27,000
"Well, we'd like to do such-and-such,

180
0:08:27.536,000 --> 0:08:29,000
but the family's in denial.

181
0:08:29.987,000 --> 0:08:31,000
The family won't listen to reason.

182
0:08:32.163,000 --> 0:08:34,000
They're in denial.

183
0:08:34.185,000 --> 0:08:36,000
How can they insist on this treatment at the end?

184
0:08:36.537,000 --> 0:08:39,000
It's so clear, yet they're in denial."

185
0:08:39.841,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Now, I think this maybe isn't

186
0:08:41.848,000 --> 0:08:44,000
a very useful way of thinking.

187
0:08:44.852,000 --> 0:08:46,000
It's not just families either.

188
0:08:47.13,000 --> 0:08:49,000
The medical professionals too,

189
0:08:49.255,000 --> 0:08:52,000
you out there, you're in denial too.

190
0:08:52.615,000 --> 0:08:54,000
You want to help. You want to fix.

191
0:08:55.468,000 --> 0:08:56,000
You want to do.

192
0:08:57.294,000 --> 0:08:59,000
You've succeeded in everything you've done,

193
0:09:00.102,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and having a patient die,

194
0:09:02.144,000 --> 0:09:05,000
well, that must feel like failure.

195
0:09:05.723,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I saw it firsthand.

196
0:09:07.567,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Just days before Terence died,

197
0:09:10.269,000 --> 0:09:12,000
his oncologist said,

198
0:09:12.287,000 --> 0:09:15,000
"Tell Terence that better days are just ahead."

199
0:09:15.535,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Days before he died.

200
0:09:17.917,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Yet Ira Byock,

201
0:09:19.35,000 --> 0:09:21,000
the director of palliative medicine at Dartmouth

202
0:09:21.698,000 --> 0:09:23,000
said, "You know, the best doctor in the world

203
0:09:24.629,000 --> 0:09:28,000
has never succeeded in making anyone immortal."

204
0:09:29.237,000 --> 0:09:35,000
So what the experts call "denial," I call "hope,"

205
0:09:35.743,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and I'd like to borrow a phrase

206
0:09:38.077,000 --> 0:09:41,000
from my friends in software design.

207
0:09:41.298,000 --> 0:09:44,000
You just redefine denial and hope,

208
0:09:44.86,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and it becomes a feature of being human.

209
0:09:48.088,000 --> 0:09:49,000
It's not a bug.

210
0:09:49.949,000 --> 0:09:51,000
It's a feature.

211
0:09:52.275,000 --> 0:09:55,000
(Laughter)

212
0:09:55.369,000 --> 0:09:58,000
So we need to think more constructively

213
0:09:59.063,000 --> 0:10:03,000
about this very common, very profound

214
0:10:03.375,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and very powerful human emotion.

215
0:10:07.331,000 --> 0:10:09,000
It's part of the human condition,

216
0:10:09.955,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and yet our system and our thinking

217
0:10:12.132,000 --> 0:10:15,000
isn't built to accommodate it.

218
0:10:15.301,000 --> 0:10:18,000
So Terence told me a story on that long-ago night,

219
0:10:18.356,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and I believed it.

220
0:10:20.261,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Maybe I wanted to believe it.

221
0:10:23.375,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And during Terence's illness, I, we,

222
0:10:28.704,000 --> 0:10:29,000
we wanted to believe the story

223
0:10:30.426,000 --> 0:10:32,000
of our fight together too.

224
0:10:33.021,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Giving up the fight -- for that's how it felt,

225
0:10:36.757,000 --> 0:10:37,000
it felt like giving up --

226
0:10:38.696,000 --> 0:10:4,000
meant giving up not only his life

227
0:10:41.413,000 --> 0:10:44,000
but also our story,

228
0:10:45.12,000 --> 0:10:47,000
our story of us as fighters,

229
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
the story of us as invincible,

230
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and for the doctors, the story of themselves

231
0:10:52.468,000 --> 0:10:54,000
as healers.

232
0:10:55.026,000 --> 0:10:57,000
So what do we need?

233
0:10:57.71,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Maybe we don't need a new piece of paper.

234
0:11:00.649,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Maybe we need a new story,

235
0:11:03.596,000 --> 0:11:07,000
not a story about giving up the fight

236
0:11:07.605,000 --> 0:11:09,000
or of hopelessness,

237
0:11:09.876,000 --> 0:11:12,000
but rather a story of victory and triumph,

238
0:11:13.287,000 --> 0:11:17,000
of a valiant battle and, eventually,

239
0:11:18.13,000 --> 0:11:2,000
a graceful retreat,

240
0:11:20.45,000 --> 0:11:23,000
a story that acknowledges

241
0:11:23.457,000 --> 0:11:26,000
that not even the greatest general defeats every foe,

242
0:11:27.22,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that no doctor has ever succeeded

243
0:11:29.841,000 --> 0:11:31,000
in making anyone immortal,

244
0:11:32.231,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and that no wife, no matter how hard she tried,

245
0:11:38.297,000 --> 0:11:42,000
has ever stopped even the bravest,

246
0:11:42.982,000 --> 0:11:46,000
wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband

247
0:11:47.031,000 --> 0:11:51,000
from dying when it was his time to go.

248
0:11:51.224,000 --> 0:11:53,000
People did mention hospice,

249
0:11:53.537,000 --> 0:11:56,000
but I wouldn't listen.

250
0:11:56.908,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Hospice was for people who were dying,

251
0:12:00.833,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and Terence wasn't dying.

252
0:12:03.606,000 --> 0:12:05,000
As a result, he spent just four days in hospice,

253
0:12:06.516,000 --> 0:12:07,000
which I'm sure, as you all know,

254
0:12:08.333,000 --> 0:12:1,000
is a pretty typical outcome,

255
0:12:10.423,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and we never said goodbye

256
0:12:11.935,000 --> 0:12:14,000
because we were unprepared for the end.

257
0:12:14.99,000 --> 0:12:17,000
We have a noble path to curing the disease,

258
0:12:18.737,000 --> 0:12:2,000
patients and doctors alike,

259
0:12:21.067,000 --> 0:12:23,000
but there doesn't seem to be

260
0:12:23.19,000 --> 0:12:25,000
a noble path to dying.

261
0:12:25.79,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Dying is seen as failing,

262
0:12:28.848,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and we had a heroic narrative

263
0:12:31.5,000 --> 0:12:33,000
for fighting together,

264
0:12:33.593,000 --> 0:12:38,000
but we didn't have a heroic narrative for letting go.

265
0:12:38.623,000 --> 0:12:42,000
So maybe we need a narrative

266
0:12:42.741,000 --> 0:12:45,000
for acknowledging the end, and for saying goodbye,

267
0:12:46.217,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and maybe our new story will be

268
0:12:48.779,000 --> 0:12:52,000
about a hero's fight, and a hero's goodbye.

269
0:12:53.385,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Terence loved poetry,

270
0:12:55.852,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy

271
0:12:59.079,000 --> 0:13:01,000
is one of my favorite poets.

272
0:13:01.508,000 --> 0:13:03,000
So I'll give you a couple lines from him.

273
0:13:04.392,000 --> 0:13:06,000
This is a poem about Mark Antony.

274
0:13:06.608,000 --> 0:13:08,000
You know Mark Antony, the conquering hero,

275
0:13:09.301,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Cleopatra's guy?

276
0:13:11.166,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Actually, one of Cleopatra's guys.

277
0:13:13.703,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And he's been a pretty good general.

278
0:13:16.128,000 --> 0:13:17,000
He's won all the fights,

279
0:13:17.188,000 --> 0:13:19,000
he's eluded all the people that are out to get him,

280
0:13:19.643,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and yet this time, finally,

281
0:13:21.431,000 --> 0:13:22,000
he's come to the city of Alexandria

282
0:13:23.18,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and realized he's lost.

283
0:13:24.862,000 --> 0:13:25,000
The people are leaving. They're playing instruments.

284
0:13:26.578,000 --> 0:13:27,000
They're singing.

285
0:13:27.901,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And suddenly he knows he's been defeated.

286
0:13:30.501,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And he suddenly knows

287
0:13:32.68,000 --> 0:13:34,000
he's been deserted by the gods,

288
0:13:35.205,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and it's time to let go.

289
0:13:37.145,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And the poet tells him what to do.

290
0:13:39.112,000 --> 0:13:42,000
He tells him how to say a noble goodbye,

291
0:13:42.378,000 --> 0:13:45,000
a goodbye that's fit for a hero.

292
0:13:46.225,000 --> 0:13:48,000
"As if long-prepared,

293
0:13:48.974,000 --> 0:13:5,000
as if courageous,

294
0:13:51.653,000 --> 0:13:53,000
as it becomes you

295
0:13:54.25,000 --> 0:13:56,000
who were worthy of such a city,

296
0:13:56.422,000 --> 0:13:58,000
approach the window with a firm step,

297
0:13:58.825,000 --> 0:14:,000
and with emotion,

298
0:14:01.36,000 --> 0:14:03,000
but not with the entreaties

299
0:14:03.559,000 --> 0:14:05,000
or the complaints of a coward,

300
0:14:06.32,000 --> 0:14:07,000
as a last enjoyment,

301
0:14:08.291,000 --> 0:14:1,000
listen to the sounds,

302
0:14:10.415,000 --> 0:14:13,000
the exquisite instruments of the musical troops,

303
0:14:13.749,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and bid her farewell,

304
0:14:16.03,000 --> 0:14:2,000
the Alexandria you are losing."

305
0:14:20.445,000 --> 0:14:23,000
That's a goodbye for a man who was larger than life,

306
0:14:24.135,000 --> 0:14:26,000
a goodbye for a man

307
0:14:26.153,000 --> 0:14:27,000
for whom anything,

308
0:14:28.127,000 --> 0:14:31,000
well, almost anything,

309
0:14:31.235,000 --> 0:14:32,000
was possible,

310
0:14:33.125,000 --> 0:14:36,000
a goodbye for a man who kept hope alive.

311
0:14:36.265,000 --> 0:14:38,000
And isn't that what we're missing?

312
0:14:38.458,000 --> 0:14:4,000
How can we learn that people's decisions

313
0:14:40.517,000 --> 0:14:41,000
about their loved ones

314
0:14:42.027,000 --> 0:14:45,000
are often based strongly, powerfully,

315
0:14:45.956,000 --> 0:14:47,000
many times irrationally,

316
0:14:48.808,000 --> 0:14:5,000
on the slimmest of hopes?

317
0:14:51.152,000 --> 0:14:54,000
The overwhelming presence of hope

318
0:14:54.174,000 --> 0:14:55,000
isn't denial.

319
0:14:55.597,000 --> 0:14:57,000
It's part of our DNA as humans,

320
0:14:58.417,000 --> 0:15:,000
and maybe it's time our healthcare system --

321
0:15:00.735,000 --> 0:15:04,000
doctors, patients, insurance companies, us,

322
0:15:05.219,000 --> 0:15:08,000
started accounting for the power of that hope.

323
0:15:09.193,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Hope isn't a bug.

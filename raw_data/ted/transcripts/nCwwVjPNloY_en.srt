1
0:00:13.227,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I was a Marine with 1/1 Weapons Company,

2
0:00:15.299,000 --> 0:00:16,000
81's platoon,

3
0:00:16.474,000 --> 0:00:18,000
out in Camp Pendleton, California.

4
0:00:18.503,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Oorah!

5
0:00:19.679,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Audience: Oorah!

6
0:00:20.855,000 --> 0:00:21,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:21.88,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I joined a few months after September 11,

8
0:00:23.872,000 --> 0:00:26,000
feeling like I think most people in the country did at the time,

9
0:00:26.915,000 --> 0:00:29,000
filled with a sense of patriotism and retribution

10
0:00:30.224,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and the desire to do something --

11
0:00:31.89,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that, coupled with that fact that I wasn't doing anything.

12
0:00:34.659,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I was 17, just graduated from high school that past summer,

13
0:00:37.929,000 --> 0:00:39,000
living in the back room of my parents' house paying rent,

14
0:00:40.655,000 --> 0:00:42,000
in the small town I was raised in in Northern Indiana,

15
0:00:43.268,000 --> 0:00:44,000
called Mishawaka.

16
0:00:44.45,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I can spell that later for people who are interested --

17
0:00:47.052,000 --> 0:00:48,000
(Laughter)

18
0:00:48.08,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Mishawaka is many good things but cultural hub of the world it is not,

19
0:00:51.964,000 --> 0:00:52,000
so my only exposure to theater and film

20
0:00:53.884,000 --> 0:00:55,000
was limited to the plays I did in high school

21
0:00:56.037,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and Blockbuster Video, may she rest in peace.

22
0:00:58.289,000 --> 0:00:59,000
(Laughter)

23
0:00:59.485,000 --> 0:01:,000
I was serious enough about acting

24
0:01:01.156,000 --> 0:01:04,000
that I auditioned for Juilliard when I was a senior in high school,

25
0:01:04.488,000 --> 0:01:05,000
didn't get in,

26
0:01:05.663,000 --> 0:01:07,000
determined college wasn't for me and applied nowhere else,

27
0:01:08.413,000 --> 0:01:09,000
which was a genius move.

28
0:01:09.73,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I also did that Hail Mary LA acting odyssey

29
0:01:13.205,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that I always heard stories about,

30
0:01:14.864,000 --> 0:01:16,000
of actors moving to LA with, like, seven dollars

31
0:01:17.189,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and finding work and successful careers.

32
0:01:19.156,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I got as far as Amarillo, Texas, before my car broke down.

33
0:01:22.536,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I spent all my money repairing it,

34
0:01:24.287,000 --> 0:01:25,000
finally made it to Santa Monica --

35
0:01:25.956,000 --> 0:01:26,000
not even LA --

36
0:01:27.258,000 --> 0:01:29,000
stayed for 48 hours wandering the beach, basically,

37
0:01:29.941,000 --> 0:01:3,000
got in my car, drove home,

38
0:01:31.251,000 --> 0:01:32,000
thus ending my acting career, so --

39
0:01:32.981,000 --> 0:01:33,000
(Laughter)

40
0:01:34.283,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Seventeen, Mishawaka ...

41
0:01:36.195,000 --> 0:01:39,000
parents' house, paying rent, selling vacuums ...

42
0:01:40.047,000 --> 0:01:41,000
telemarketing,

43
0:01:41.626,000 --> 0:01:43,000
cutting grass at the local 4-H fairgrounds.

44
0:01:43.833,000 --> 0:01:45,000
This was my world going into September, 2001.

45
0:01:46.149,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So after the 11th,

46
0:01:47.324,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and feeling an overwhelming sense of duty,

47
0:01:49.55,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and just being pissed off in general -- at myself,

48
0:01:51.925,000 --> 0:01:52,000
my parents, the government;

49
0:01:53.345,000 --> 0:01:55,000
not having confidence, not having a respectable job,

50
0:01:55.822,000 --> 0:01:58,000
my shitty mini-fridge that I just drove to California and back --

51
0:01:58.948,000 --> 0:02:,000
I joined the Marine Corps and loved it. I loved being a Marine.

52
0:02:01.945,000 --> 0:02:04,000
It's one of the things I'm most proud of having done in my life.

53
0:02:05.007,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Firing weapons was cool,

54
0:02:06.197,000 --> 0:02:08,000
driving and detonating expensive things was great.

55
0:02:08.656,000 --> 0:02:1,000
But I found I loved the Marine Corps the most

56
0:02:10.788,000 --> 0:02:12,000
for the thing I was looking for the least when I joined,

57
0:02:13.453,000 --> 0:02:14,000
which was the people:

58
0:02:14.638,000 --> 0:02:17,000
these weird dudes -- a motley crew of characters

59
0:02:18.242,000 --> 0:02:2,000
from a cross section of the United States --

60
0:02:20.648,000 --> 0:02:22,000
that on the surface I had nothing in common with.

61
0:02:23.003,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And over time,

62
0:02:24.635,000 --> 0:02:25,000
all the political and personal bravado

63
0:02:26.485,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that led me to the military dissolved,

64
0:02:28.386,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and for me, the Marine Corps became synonymous with my friends.

65
0:02:31.392,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And then, a few years into my service

66
0:02:33.704,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and months away from deploying to Iraq,

67
0:02:35.807,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I dislocated my sternum in a mountain-biking accident,

68
0:02:38.696,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and had to be medically separated.

69
0:02:40.362,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Those never in the military may find this hard to understand,

70
0:02:43.319,000 --> 0:02:46,000
but being told I wasn't getting deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan

71
0:02:46.406,000 --> 0:02:47,000
was very devastating for me.

72
0:02:47.873,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I have a very clear image of leaving the base hospital on a stretcher

73
0:02:51.138,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and my entire platoon is waiting outside to see if I was OK.

74
0:02:54.032,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And then, suddenly, I was a civilian again.

75
0:02:56.49,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I knew I wanted to give acting another shot,

76
0:02:58.719,000 --> 0:02:59,000
because -- again, this is me --

77
0:03:00.547,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I thought all civilian problems are small compared to the military.

78
0:03:04.29,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I mean, what can you really bitch about now, you know?

79
0:03:07.071,000 --> 0:03:08,000
"It's hot.

80
0:03:08.672,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Someone should turn on the air conditioner."

81
0:03:10.928,000 --> 0:03:11,000
"This coffee line is too long."

82
0:03:13.155,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I was a Marine,

83
0:03:14.331,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I knew how to survive.

84
0:03:15.506,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I'd go to New York and become an actor.

85
0:03:17.468,000 --> 0:03:18,000
If things didn't work out,

86
0:03:18.753,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I'd live in Central Park and dumpster-dive behind Panera Bread.

87
0:03:21.761,000 --> 0:03:22,000
(Laughter)

88
0:03:22.786,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I re-auditioned for Juilliard and this time I was lucky,

89
0:03:25.5,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I got in.

90
0:03:26.675,000 --> 0:03:28,000
But I was surprised by how complex the transition was

91
0:03:29.24,000 --> 0:03:3,000
from military to civilian.

92
0:03:30.565,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And I was relatively healthy; I can't imagine going through that process

93
0:03:34.064,000 --> 0:03:35,000
on top of a mental or physical injury.

94
0:03:35.95,000 --> 0:03:36,000
But regardless, it was difficult.

95
0:03:37.565,000 --> 0:03:39,000
In part, because I was in acting school --

96
0:03:39.759,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I couldn't justify going to voice and speech class,

97
0:03:43.757,000 --> 0:03:45,000
throwing imaginary balls of energy at the back of the room,

98
0:03:46.612,000 --> 0:03:48,000
doing acting exercises where I gave birth to myself --

99
0:03:49.199,000 --> 0:03:5,000
(Laughter)

100
0:03:50.224,000 --> 0:03:52,000
while my friends were serving without me overseas.

101
0:03:52.982,000 --> 0:03:54,000
But also, because I didn't know how to apply the things

102
0:03:55.615,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I learned in the military to a civilian context.

103
0:03:57.992,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I mean that both practically and emotionally.

104
0:04:00.175,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Practically, I had to get a job.

105
0:04:01.768,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And I was an Infantry Marine,

106
0:04:03.524,000 --> 0:04:05,000
where you're shooting machine guns and firing mortars.

107
0:04:06.104,000 --> 0:04:09,000
There's not a lot of places you can put those skills in the civilian world.

108
0:04:09.675,000 --> 0:04:1,000
(Laughter)

109
0:04:10.7,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Emotionally, I struggled to find meaning.

110
0:04:13.103,000 --> 0:04:14,000
In the military, everything has meaning.

111
0:04:15.088,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Everything you do is either steeped in tradition

112
0:04:17.365,000 --> 0:04:18,000
or has a practical purpose.

113
0:04:18.717,000 --> 0:04:19,000
You can't smoke in the field

114
0:04:20.094,000 --> 0:04:22,000
because you don't want to give away your position.

115
0:04:22.469,000 --> 0:04:24,000
You don't touch your face -- you have to maintain

116
0:04:24.788,000 --> 0:04:25,000
a personal level of health and hygiene.

117
0:04:26.694,000 --> 0:04:27,000
You face this way when "Colors" plays,

118
0:04:28.544,000 --> 0:04:3,000
out of respect for people who went before you.

119
0:04:30.758,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Walk this way, talk this way because of this.

120
0:04:32.922,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Your uniform is maintained to the inch.

121
0:04:34.826,000 --> 0:04:36,000
How diligently you followed those rules spoke volumes

122
0:04:37.343,000 --> 0:04:38,000
about the kind of Marine you were.

123
0:04:39.002,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Your rank said something about your history

124
0:04:41.054,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and the respect you had earned.

125
0:04:42.562,000 --> 0:04:43,000
In the civilian world there's no rank.

126
0:04:44.418,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Here you're just another body,

127
0:04:45.881,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and I felt like I constantly had to prove my worth all over again.

128
0:04:49.112,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And the respect civilians were giving me while I was in uniform

129
0:04:52.136,000 --> 0:04:53,000
didn't exist when I was out of it.

130
0:04:53.786,000 --> 0:04:54,000
There didn't seem to be a ...

131
0:04:55.563,000 --> 0:04:56,000
a sense of community,

132
0:04:56.787,000 --> 0:04:58,000
whereas in the military, I felt this sense of community.

133
0:04:59.477,000 --> 0:05:,000
How often in the civilian world

134
0:05:01.748,000 --> 0:05:04,000
are you put in a life-or-death situation with your closest friends

135
0:05:05.006,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and they constantly demonstrate that they're not going to abandon you?

136
0:05:08.336,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And meanwhile, at acting school ...

137
0:05:10.413,000 --> 0:05:12,000
(Laughter)

138
0:05:12.895,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I was really, for the first time,

139
0:05:14.593,000 --> 0:05:16,000
discovering playwrights and characters and plays

140
0:05:16.902,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that had nothing to do with the military,

141
0:05:18.889,000 --> 0:05:2,000
but were somehow describing my military experience

142
0:05:21.268,000 --> 0:05:23,000
in a way that before to me was indescribable.

143
0:05:23.839,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And I felt myself becoming less aggressive

144
0:05:26.254,000 --> 0:05:29,000
as I was able to put words to feelings for the first time

145
0:05:29.481,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and realizing what a valuable tool that was.

146
0:05:31.624,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And when I was reflecting on my time in the military,

147
0:05:34.128,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I wasn't first thinking on the stereotypical drills

148
0:05:36.563,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and discipline and pain of it;

149
0:05:38.039,000 --> 0:05:4,000
but rather, the small, intimate human moments,

150
0:05:40.277,000 --> 0:05:41,000
moments of great feeling:

151
0:05:41.634,000 --> 0:05:43,000
friends going AWOL because they missed their families,

152
0:05:44.283,000 --> 0:05:45,000
friends getting divorced,

153
0:05:45.542,000 --> 0:05:46,000
grieving together, celebrating together,

154
0:05:47.564,000 --> 0:05:48,000
all within the backdrop of the military.

155
0:05:49.523,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I saw my friends battling these circumstances,

156
0:05:51.829,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and I watched the anxiety it produced in them and me,

157
0:05:54.884,000 --> 0:05:56,000
not being able to express our feelings about it.

158
0:05:58.026,000 --> 0:06:01,000
The military and theater communities are actually very similar.

159
0:06:01.098,000 --> 0:06:03,000
You have a group of people trying to accomplish a mission

160
0:06:03.847,000 --> 0:06:05,000
greater than themselves; it's not about you.

161
0:06:05.934,000 --> 0:06:07,000
You have a role, you have to know your role within that team.

162
0:06:08.926,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Every team has a leader or director;

163
0:06:11.109,000 --> 0:06:13,000
sometimes they're smart, sometimes they're not.

164
0:06:13.683,000 --> 0:06:15,000
You're forced to be intimate with complete strangers

165
0:06:16.311,000 --> 0:06:17,000
in a short amount of time;

166
0:06:17.62,000 --> 0:06:19,000
the self-discipline, the self-maintenance.

167
0:06:20.132,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I thought, how great would it be to create a space

168
0:06:22.639,000 --> 0:06:25,000
that combined these two seemingly dissimilar communities,

169
0:06:25.99,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that brought entertainment to a group of people

170
0:06:28.249,000 --> 0:06:3,000
that, considering their occupation,

171
0:06:30.368,000 --> 0:06:32,000
could handle something a bit more thought-provoking

172
0:06:32.836,000 --> 0:06:33,000
than the typical mandatory-fun events

173
0:06:34.693,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that I remember being "volun-told" to go to in the military --

174
0:06:37.778,000 --> 0:06:38,000
(Laughter)

175
0:06:38.804,000 --> 0:06:4,000
all well-intended but slightly offensive events,

176
0:06:41.106,000 --> 0:06:43,000
like "Win a Date with a San Diego Chargers Cheerleader,"

177
0:06:43.781,000 --> 0:06:45,000
where you answer a question about pop culture,

178
0:06:45.981,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and if you get it right you win a date,

179
0:06:47.898,000 --> 0:06:49,000
which was a chaperoned walk around the parade deck

180
0:06:50.268,000 --> 0:06:52,000
with this already married, pregnant cheerleader --

181
0:06:52.683,000 --> 0:06:53,000
(Laughter)

182
0:06:53.874,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Nothing against cheerleaders, I love cheerleaders.

183
0:06:56.278,000 --> 0:06:59,000
The point is more, how great would it be to have theater presented

184
0:06:59.414,000 --> 0:07:02,000
through characters that were accessible without being condescending.

185
0:07:02.662,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So we started this nonprofit called Arts in the Armed Forces,

186
0:07:05.591,000 --> 0:07:06,000
where we tried to do that,

187
0:07:07.27,000 --> 0:07:09,000
tried to join these two seemingly dissimilar communities.

188
0:07:10.212,000 --> 0:07:13,000
We pick a play or select monologues from contemporary American plays

189
0:07:14.051,000 --> 0:07:17,000
that are diverse in age and race like a military audience is,

190
0:07:17.749,000 --> 0:07:19,000
grab a group of incredible theater-trained actors,

191
0:07:20.122,000 --> 0:07:21,000
arm them with incredible material,

192
0:07:21.999,000 --> 0:07:23,000
keep production value as minimal as possible --

193
0:07:24.243,000 --> 0:07:27,000
no sets, no costumes, no lights, just reading it --

194
0:07:27.303,000 --> 0:07:29,000
to throw all the emphasis on the language

195
0:07:29.806,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and to show that theater can be created at any setting.

196
0:07:32.545,000 --> 0:07:33,000
It's a powerful thing,

197
0:07:33.749,000 --> 0:07:35,000
getting in a room with complete strangers

198
0:07:36.659,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and reminding ourselves of our humanity,

199
0:07:39.331,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and that self-expression is just as valuable a tool

200
0:07:41.752,000 --> 0:07:42,000
as a rifle on your shoulder.

201
0:07:43.133,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And for an organization like the military,

202
0:07:45.162,000 --> 0:07:47,000
that prides itself on having acronyms for acronyms,

203
0:07:48.113,000 --> 0:07:49,000
you can get lost in the sauce

204
0:07:49.56,000 --> 0:07:51,000
when it comes to explaining a collective experience.

205
0:07:52.266,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And I can think of no better community

206
0:07:54.134,000 --> 0:07:56,000
to arm with a new means of self-expression

207
0:07:56.229,000 --> 0:07:58,000
than those protecting our country.

208
0:07:58.275,000 --> 0:08:,000
We've gone all over the United States and the world,

209
0:08:00.779,000 --> 0:08:02,000
from Walter Reed in Bethesda, Maryland,

210
0:08:03.484,000 --> 0:08:05,000
to Camp Pendleton, to Camp Arifjan in Kuwait,

211
0:08:05.954,000 --> 0:08:06,000
to USAG Bavaria,

212
0:08:07.687,000 --> 0:08:09,000
on- and off-Broadway theaters in New York.

213
0:08:09.751,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And for the performing artists we bring,

214
0:08:11.847,000 --> 0:08:12,000
it's a window into a culture

215
0:08:13.539,000 --> 0:08:15,000
they otherwise would not have had exposure to.

216
0:08:15.723,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And for the military, it's the exact same.

217
0:08:17.766,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And in doing this for the past six years,

218
0:08:19.777,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I'm always reminded that acting is many things.

219
0:08:22.032,000 --> 0:08:25,000
It's a craft, it's a political act, it's a business, it's --

220
0:08:25.888,000 --> 0:08:27,000
whatever adjective is most applicable to you.

221
0:08:28.037,000 --> 0:08:29,000
But it's also a service.

222
0:08:29.5,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I didn't get to finish mine,

223
0:08:31.048,000 --> 0:08:32,000
so whenever I get to be of service

224
0:08:32.704,000 --> 0:08:35,000
to this ultimate service industry, the military, for me, again --

225
0:08:36.005,000 --> 0:08:38,000
there's not many things better than that.

226
0:08:38.076,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Thank you.

227
0:08:39.428,000 --> 0:08:43,000
(Applause)

228
0:08:44.04,000 --> 0:08:47,000
We're going to be doing a piece from Marco Ramirez,

229
0:08:47.988,000 --> 0:08:48,000
called "I am not Batman."

230
0:08:49.706,000 --> 0:08:52,000
An incredible actor and good friend of mine, Jesse Perez,

231
0:08:52.758,000 --> 0:08:53,000
is going to be reading,

232
0:08:53.957,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and Matt Johnson, who I just met a couple hours ago.

233
0:08:56.465,000 --> 0:08:58,000
They're doing it together for the first time,

234
0:08:58.64,000 --> 0:08:59,000
so we'll see how it goes.

235
0:08:59.902,000 --> 0:09:,000
Jesse Perez and Matt Johnson.

236
0:09:01.845,000 --> 0:09:04,000
(Applause)

237
0:09:12.669,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Jesse Perez: It's the middle of the night

238
0:09:14.66,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and the sky is glowing like mad, radioactive red.

239
0:09:16.994,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And if you squint, you can maybe see the moon

240
0:09:19.14,000 --> 0:09:21,000
through a thick layer of cigarette smoke and airplane exhaust

241
0:09:22.03,000 --> 0:09:23,000
that covers the whole city,

242
0:09:23.345,000 --> 0:09:25,000
like a mosquito net that won't let the angels in.

243
0:09:25.667,000 --> 0:09:26,000
(Drum beat)

244
0:09:26.731,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And if you look up high enough,

245
0:09:28.241,000 --> 0:09:31,000
you can see me standing on the edge of an 87-story building.

246
0:09:31.702,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And up there, a place for gargoyles and broken clock towers

247
0:09:35.153,000 --> 0:09:37,000
that have stayed still and dead for maybe like 100 years,

248
0:09:38.153,000 --> 0:09:39,000
up there is me.

249
0:09:39.688,000 --> 0:09:4,000
(Beat)

250
0:09:40.742,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And I'm frickin' Batman.

251
0:09:42.35,000 --> 0:09:43,000
(Beat)

252
0:09:43.413,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And I gots Batmobiles and batarangs

253
0:09:45.602,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and frickin' bat caves, like, for real.

254
0:09:48.021,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And all it takes is a broom closet

255
0:09:49.739,000 --> 0:09:5,000
or a back room or a fire escape,

256
0:09:51.707,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and Danny's hand-me-down jeans are gone.

257
0:09:54.722,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And my navy blue polo shirt,

258
0:09:56.642,000 --> 0:09:59,000
the one that looks kinda good on me but has that hole on it near the butt

259
0:10:00.143,000 --> 0:10:03,000
from when it got snagged on the chain-link fence behind Arturo's

260
0:10:03.191,000 --> 0:10:05,000
but it isn't even a big deal because I tuck that part in

261
0:10:05.907,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and it's, like, all good.

262
0:10:07.15,000 --> 0:10:08,000
That blue polo shirt -- it's gone, too!

263
0:10:09.091,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And I get like, like ... transformational.

264
0:10:12.122,000 --> 0:10:13,000
(Beat)

265
0:10:13.434,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And nobody pulls out a belt and whips Batman for talkin' back.

266
0:10:16.793,000 --> 0:10:17,000
(Beat)

267
0:10:17.834,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Or for not talkin' back.

268
0:10:19.278,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And nobody calls Batman simple

269
0:10:21.626,000 --> 0:10:22,000
or stupid

270
0:10:23.199,000 --> 0:10:24,000
or skinny.

271
0:10:24.784,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And nobody fires Batman's brother from the Eastern Taxi Company

272
0:10:28.027,000 --> 0:10:3,000
'cause they was making cutbacks, neither.

273
0:10:30.083,000 --> 0:10:31,000
'Cause they got nothing but respect.

274
0:10:31.996,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And not like afraid-respect,

275
0:10:34.155,000 --> 0:10:36,000
just, like, respect-respect.

276
0:10:36.558,000 --> 0:10:37,000
(Laughter)

277
0:10:37.583,000 --> 0:10:38,000
'Cause nobody's afraid of you.

278
0:10:39.114,000 --> 0:10:41,000
'Cause Batman doesn't mean nobody no harm.

279
0:10:41.272,000 --> 0:10:42,000
(Beat)

280
0:10:42.297,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Ever. (Double beat)

281
0:10:43.875,000 --> 0:10:45,000
'Cause all Batman really wants to do is save people

282
0:10:46.336,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and maybe pay abuela's bills one day

283
0:10:48.107,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and die happy.

284
0:10:49.282,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And maybe get, like, mad-famous for real.

285
0:10:51.502,000 --> 0:10:52,000
(Laughter)

286
0:10:52.537,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Oh -- and kill the Joker.

287
0:10:53.898,000 --> 0:10:54,000
(Drum roll)

288
0:10:55.382,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Tonight, like most nights, I'm all alone.

289
0:10:58.064,000 --> 0:11:,000
And I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'

290
0:11:00.281,000 --> 0:11:01,000
like a eagle

291
0:11:01.487,000 --> 0:11:02,000
or like a --

292
0:11:02.681,000 --> 0:11:03,000
no, yeah, like a eagle.

293
0:11:04.414,000 --> 0:11:05,000
(Laughter)

294
0:11:05.439,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And my cape is flapping in the wind cause it's frickin' long

295
0:11:08.281,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and my pointy ears are on,

296
0:11:09.719,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and that mask that covers like half my face is on, too,

297
0:11:12.573,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and I got, like, bulletproof stuff all in my chest so no one can hurt me.

298
0:11:16.073,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And nobody -- nobody! --

299
0:11:17.811,000 --> 0:11:19,000
is gonna come between Batman ...

300
0:11:19.874,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and justice.

301
0:11:21.077,000 --> 0:11:22,000
(Drums) (Laughter)

302
0:11:22.903,000 --> 0:11:23,000
From where I am,

303
0:11:24.435,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I can hear everything.

304
0:11:26.046,000 --> 0:11:27,000
(Silence)

305
0:11:27.236,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Somewhere in the city,

306
0:11:28.42,000 --> 0:11:31,000
there's a old lady picking Styrofoam leftovers up out of a trash can

307
0:11:31.66,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and she's putting a piece of sesame chicken someone spit out

308
0:11:34.534,000 --> 0:11:35,000
into her own mouth.

309
0:11:35.869,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And somewhere there's a doctor with a wack haircut in a black lab coat

310
0:11:39.202,000 --> 0:11:4,000
trying to find a cure for the diseases

311
0:11:41.084,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that are gonna make us all extinct for real one day.

312
0:11:44.066,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And somewhere there's a man,

313
0:11:45.45,000 --> 0:11:46,000
a man in a janitor's uniform,

314
0:11:46.871,000 --> 0:11:47,000
stumbling home drunk and dizzy

315
0:11:48.828,000 --> 0:11:51,000
after spending half his paycheck on 40-ounce bottles of twist-off beer,

316
0:11:52.604,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and the other half on a four-hour visit to some lady's house

317
0:11:55.572,000 --> 0:11:57,000
on a street where the lights have all been shot out

318
0:11:58.021,000 --> 0:12:01,000
by people who'd rather do what they do in this city in the dark.

319
0:12:01.078,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And half a block away from janitor man,

320
0:12:03.028,000 --> 0:12:05,000
there's a group of good-for-nothings who don't know no better,

321
0:12:05.966,000 --> 0:12:07,000
waiting for janitor man with rusted bicycle chains

322
0:12:08.514,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and imitation Louisville Sluggers,

323
0:12:10.207,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and if they don't find a cent on him,

324
0:12:12.013,000 --> 0:12:13,000
which they won't,

325
0:12:13.188,000 --> 0:12:16,000
they'll just pound at him till the muscles in their arms start burning,

326
0:12:16.57,000 --> 0:12:18,000
till there's no more teeth to crack out.

327
0:12:18.667,000 --> 0:12:19,000
But they don't count on me.

328
0:12:20.664,000 --> 0:12:22,000
They don't count on no Dark Knight,

329
0:12:22.935,000 --> 0:12:24,000
with a stomach full of grocery-store brand macaroni and cheese

330
0:12:25.953,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and cut-up Vienna sausages.

331
0:12:27.566,000 --> 0:12:28,000
(Laughter)

332
0:12:28.591,000 --> 0:12:3,000
'Cause they'd rather believe I don't exist.

333
0:12:31.893,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And from 87 stories up, I can hear one of the good-for-nothings say,

334
0:12:35.53,000 --> 0:12:37,000
"Gimme the cash!" -- real fast like that,

335
0:12:37.855,000 --> 0:12:38,000
just, "Gimme me the fuckin' cash!"

336
0:12:39.622,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And I see janitor man mumble something in drunk language and turn pale,

337
0:12:43.199,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and from 87 stories up,

338
0:12:44.4,000 --> 0:12:47,000
I can hear his stomach trying to hurl its way out his Dickies.

339
0:12:47.532,000 --> 0:12:48,000
So I swoop down, like, mad-fast

340
0:12:49.437,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and I'm like darkness, I'm like, "Swoosh!"

341
0:12:52.476,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And I throw a batarang at the one naked lightbulb.

342
0:12:54.955,000 --> 0:12:55,000
(Cymbal)

343
0:12:56.018,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And they're all like, "Whoa, muthafucker!

344
0:12:58.17,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Who just turned out the lights?"

345
0:12:59.785,000 --> 0:13:,000
(Laughter)

346
0:13:00.81,000 --> 0:13:01,000
"What's that over there?" "What?"

347
0:13:02.503,000 --> 0:13:03,000
"Gimme me what you got, old man!"

348
0:13:04.12,000 --> 0:13:05,000
"Did anybody hear that?"

349
0:13:05.31,000 --> 0:13:08,000
"Hear what? There ain't nothing. No, really -- there ain't no bat!"

350
0:13:09.174,000 --> 0:13:1,000
But then ...

351
0:13:10.425,000 --> 0:13:13,000
one out of the three good-for-nothings gets it to the head -- pow!

352
0:13:13.928,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And number two swings blindly into the dark cape before him,

353
0:13:16.809,000 --> 0:13:17,000
but before his fist hits anything,

354
0:13:18.642,000 --> 0:13:19,000
I grab a trash can lid and --

355
0:13:20.57,000 --> 0:13:21,000
right in the gut!

356
0:13:21.781,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And number one comes back with the jump kick,

357
0:13:23.92,000 --> 0:13:25,000
but I know judo karate, too, so I'm like --

358
0:13:26.575,000 --> 0:13:29,000
(Drums)

359
0:13:30.38,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Twice!

360
0:13:31.555,000 --> 0:13:32,000
(Drums)

361
0:13:32.58,000 --> 0:13:33,000
(Laughter)

362
0:13:33.829,000 --> 0:13:34,000
(Drums)

363
0:13:35.305,000 --> 0:13:36,000
But before I can do any more damage,

364
0:13:37.089,000 --> 0:13:39,000
suddenly we all hear a "click-click."

365
0:13:40.217,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And suddenly everything gets quiet.

366
0:13:43.049,000 --> 0:13:45,000
And the one good-for-nothing left standing

367
0:13:45.089,000 --> 0:13:46,000
grips a handgun and aims it straight up,

368
0:13:47.05,000 --> 0:13:48,000
like he's holding Jesus hostage,

369
0:13:48.655,000 --> 0:13:5,000
like he's threatening maybe to blow a hole in the moon.

370
0:13:51.564,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And the good-for-nothing who got it to the head,

371
0:13:53.86,000 --> 0:13:54,000
who tried to jump-kick me,

372
0:13:55.152,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and the other good-for-nothing who got it in the gut,

373
0:13:57.669,000 --> 0:13:59,000
is both scrambling back away from the dark figure before 'em.

374
0:14:00.574,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And the drunk man, the janitor man,

375
0:14:02.281,000 --> 0:14:04,000
is huddled in a corner, praying to Saint Anthony

376
0:14:04.568,000 --> 0:14:06,000
'cause that's the only one he could remember.

377
0:14:06.708,000 --> 0:14:07,000
(Double beat)

378
0:14:07.733,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And there's me:

379
0:14:09.31,000 --> 0:14:1,000
eyes glowing white,

380
0:14:10.704,000 --> 0:14:12,000
cape blowing softly in the wind.

381
0:14:12.735,000 --> 0:14:13,000
(Beat)

382
0:14:13.76,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Bulletproof chest heaving,

383
0:14:15.281,000 --> 0:14:17,000
my heart beating right through it in a Morse code for:

384
0:14:17.845,000 --> 0:14:18,000
"Fuck with me

385
0:14:19.02,000 --> 0:14:2,000
just once

386
0:14:20.195,000 --> 0:14:21,000
come on

387
0:14:21.37,000 --> 0:14:22,000
just try."

388
0:14:22.83,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And the one good-for-nothing left standing,

389
0:14:24.934,000 --> 0:14:25,000
the one with the handgun --

390
0:14:26.273,000 --> 0:14:27,000
yeah, he laughs.

391
0:14:27.448,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And he lowers his arm.

392
0:14:28.654,000 --> 0:14:29,000
And he points it at me

393
0:14:29.988,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and gives the moon a break.

394
0:14:31.463,000 --> 0:14:33,000
And he aims it right between my pointy ears,

395
0:14:33.66,000 --> 0:14:35,000
like goal posts and he's special teams.

396
0:14:37.444,000 --> 0:14:39,000
And janitor man is still calling Saint Anthony,

397
0:14:40.137,000 --> 0:14:41,000
but he ain't pickin' up.

398
0:14:42.277,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And for a second,

399
0:14:43.979,000 --> 0:14:44,000
it seems like ...

400
0:14:47.04,000 --> 0:14:48,000
maybe I'm gonna lose.

401
0:14:50.899,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Nah!

402
0:14:52.081,000 --> 0:14:53,000
(Drums)

403
0:14:53.121,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Shoot! Shoot! Fwa-ka-ka!

404
0:14:54.33,000 --> 0:14:55,000
"Don't kill me, man!"

405
0:14:55.505,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Snap! Wrist crack! Neck! Slash!

406
0:14:57.487,000 --> 0:15:,000
Skin meets acid: "Ahhhhhhh!"

407
0:15:01.494,000 --> 0:15:02,000
And he's on the floor

408
0:15:02.756,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and I'm standing over him

409
0:15:03.978,000 --> 0:15:04,000
and I got the gun in my hands now

410
0:15:05.911,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and I hate guns, I hate holding 'em 'cause I'm Batman.

411
0:15:08.599,000 --> 0:15:09,000
And, asterisk:

412
0:15:09.801,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Batman don't like guns 'cause his parents got iced by guns a long time ago.

413
0:15:13.383,000 --> 0:15:14,000
But for just a second,

414
0:15:14.622,000 --> 0:15:15,000
my eyes glow white,

415
0:15:15.964,000 --> 0:15:16,000
and I hold this thing

416
0:15:17.147,000 --> 0:15:18,000
for I could speak to the good-for-nothing

417
0:15:19.154,000 --> 0:15:2,000
in a language he maybe understands.

418
0:15:20.924,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Click-click!

419
0:15:22.495,000 --> 0:15:23,000
(Beat)

420
0:15:23.532,000 --> 0:15:25,000
And the good-for-nothings become good-for-disappearing

421
0:15:26.121,000 --> 0:15:29,000
into whatever toxic waste, chemical sludge shithole they crawled out of.

422
0:15:30.784,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And it's just me and janitor man.

423
0:15:33.555,000 --> 0:15:34,000
And I pick him up,

424
0:15:35.049,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and I wipe sweat and cheap perfume off his forehead.

425
0:15:38.206,000 --> 0:15:39,000
And he begs me not to hurt him

426
0:15:39.666,000 --> 0:15:41,000
and I grab him tight by his janitor-man shirt collar,

427
0:15:42.22,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and I pull him to my face

428
0:15:43.531,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and he's taller than me but the cape helps,

429
0:15:45.635,000 --> 0:15:47,000
so he listens when I look him straight in the eyes.

430
0:15:48.052,000 --> 0:15:49,000
And I say two words to him:

431
0:15:50.467,000 --> 0:15:51,000
"Go home."

432
0:15:53.282,000 --> 0:15:54,000
And he does,

433
0:15:54.552,000 --> 0:15:56,000
checking behind his shoulder every 10 feet.

434
0:15:57.044,000 --> 0:15:59,000
And I swoosh from building to building on his way there

435
0:15:59.657,000 --> 0:16:,000
'cause I know where he lives.

436
0:16:01.085,000 --> 0:16:03,000
And I watch his hands tremble as he pulls out his key chain

437
0:16:03.913,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and opens the door to his building.

438
0:16:05.646,000 --> 0:16:06,000
And I'm back in bed

439
0:16:06.941,000 --> 0:16:08,000
before he even walks in through the front door.

440
0:16:09.548,000 --> 0:16:1,000
And I hear him turn on the faucet

441
0:16:11.191,000 --> 0:16:13,000
and pour himself a glass of warm tap water.

442
0:16:13.796,000 --> 0:16:14,000
And he puts the glass back in the sink.

443
0:16:16.399,000 --> 0:16:17,000
And I hear his footsteps.

444
0:16:18.63,000 --> 0:16:2,000
And they get slower as they get to my room.

445
0:16:21.758,000 --> 0:16:24,000
And he creaks my door open, like, mad-slow.

446
0:16:25.953,000 --> 0:16:26,000
And he takes a step in,

447
0:16:27.805,000 --> 0:16:28,000
which he never does.

448
0:16:29.677,000 --> 0:16:3,000
(Beat)

449
0:16:31.167,000 --> 0:16:32,000
And he's staring off into nowhere,

450
0:16:32.821,000 --> 0:16:34,000
his face, the color of sidewalks in summer.

451
0:16:35.51,000 --> 0:16:36,000
And I act like I'm just waking up

452
0:16:37.115,000 --> 0:16:39,000
and I say, "Ah, what's up, Pop?"

453
0:16:40.452,000 --> 0:16:42,000
And janitor man says nothing to me.

454
0:16:43.753,000 --> 0:16:44,000
But I see in the dark,

455
0:16:44.938,000 --> 0:16:45,000
I see his arms go limp

456
0:16:46.335,000 --> 0:16:48,000
and his head turns back, like, towards me.

457
0:16:48.473,000 --> 0:16:5,000
And he lifts it for I can see his face,

458
0:16:50.873,000 --> 0:16:51,000
for I could see his eyes.

459
0:16:52.763,000 --> 0:16:54,000
And his cheeks is drippin', but not with sweat.

460
0:16:55.704,000 --> 0:16:56,000
And he just stands there breathing,

461
0:16:57.509,000 --> 0:16:59,000
like he remembers my eyes glowing white,

462
0:16:59.965,000 --> 0:17:01,000
like he remembers my bulletproof chest,

463
0:17:03.513,000 --> 0:17:04,000
like he remembers he's my pop.

464
0:17:09.575,000 --> 0:17:11,000
And for a long time I don't say nothin'.

465
0:17:14.583,000 --> 0:17:16,000
And he turns around, hand on the doorknob.

466
0:17:16.633,000 --> 0:17:17,000
And he ain't looking my way,

467
0:17:18.085,000 --> 0:17:2,000
but I hear him mumble two words to me:

468
0:17:22.253,000 --> 0:17:23,000
"I'm sorry."

469
0:17:26.317,000 --> 0:17:29,000
And I lean over, and I open my window just a crack.

470
0:17:30.697,000 --> 0:17:31,000
If you look up high enough,

471
0:17:33.036,000 --> 0:17:34,000

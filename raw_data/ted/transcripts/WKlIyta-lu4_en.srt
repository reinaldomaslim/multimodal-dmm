1
0:00:12.513,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I was born to two amazing professors who were not religious.

2
0:00:17.439,000 --> 0:00:19,000
In fact, my father's regular response

3
0:00:19.837,000 --> 0:00:23,000
to the question about why we didn't go to church on Sundays was,

4
0:00:23.861,000 --> 0:00:26,000
"When others go to pray, I go to play."

5
0:00:27.122,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Tennis, in case you're wondering.

6
0:00:30.034,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Faith found me and my siblings when university students came to our house

7
0:00:34.51,000 --> 0:00:35,000
to invite us to Sunday school.

8
0:00:36.875,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I was drawn by their sense of personal conviction

9
0:00:40.704,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and their life of service,

10
0:00:42.749,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and opted for baptism into the Christian faith

11
0:00:46.02,000 --> 0:00:48,000
as my 10th birthday present.

12
0:00:48.634,000 --> 0:00:51,000
My faith has shaped my work as a social entrepreneur,

13
0:00:52.246,000 --> 0:00:54,000
attempting to address Africa's most pressing challenges

14
0:00:54.912,000 --> 0:00:56,000
over the last 17 years,

15
0:00:57.262,000 --> 0:01:,000
and my work training youth as leaders

16
0:01:01.15,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and promoting ethics across Africa.

17
0:01:05.094,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Twenty-nine years later,

18
0:01:06.724,000 --> 0:01:08,000
as a Sunday school teacher myself,

19
0:01:09.172,000 --> 0:01:12,000
my faith was challenged by a young nine-year-old

20
0:01:12.91,000 --> 0:01:13,000
who asked a series of questions.

21
0:01:15.895,000 --> 0:01:16,000
He asked,

22
0:01:17.447,000 --> 0:01:2,000
"Ms. Ndidi, does God hate Africans?"

23
0:01:22.345,000 --> 0:01:24,000
To which I quickly retorted, "Of course not.

24
0:01:24.592,000 --> 0:01:26,000
God loves all his children equally."

25
0:01:27.634,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Then he asked, "So why do so many young African children die?"

26
0:01:32.685,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I stumbled and mumbled as I responded.

27
0:01:35.53,000 --> 0:01:38,000
"There are many reasons why young African children die.

28
0:01:39.491,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Most of them are man-made, and we cannot blame God."

29
0:01:43.533,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So he asked, "Why does he let it happen?

30
0:01:46.158,000 --> 0:01:47,000
He could stop it."

31
0:01:47.859,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And I said ...

32
0:01:49.973,000 --> 0:01:51,000
"Yes he could, yes he could,

33
0:01:52.045,000 --> 0:01:54,000
but he sent us here as change agents,

34
0:01:54.967,000 --> 0:01:56,000
light of the world, salt of the earth,

35
0:01:57.612,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and we are failing."

36
0:02:00.839,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Africa has had a mixed affair with organized religion,

37
0:02:04.428,000 --> 0:02:06,000
with both positive and negative consequences.

38
0:02:08.624,000 --> 0:02:11,000
The Christian missionaries educated most of our political elite,

39
0:02:12.133,000 --> 0:02:14,000
like Senghor and Nkrumah,

40
0:02:14.244,000 --> 0:02:17,000
built many of our first hospitals and schools.

41
0:02:18.747,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Similarly, Islam has introduced commerce and mathematics

42
0:02:24.873,000 --> 0:02:25,000
across the continent.

43
0:02:27.372,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Today, we have over a billion Africans who profess a strong faith.

44
0:02:34.443,000 --> 0:02:37,000
What is the net effect of this on our continent?

45
0:02:39.155,000 --> 0:02:43,000
A recent "Economist" article said that the face of the future

46
0:02:43.854,000 --> 0:02:45,000
of the world's most popular religion is African.

47
0:02:48.4,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Now, both Islam and Christianity underscore the importance of social impact

48
0:02:53.582,000 --> 0:02:54,000
as critical tenets of our faith.

49
0:02:56.983,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Muhammad is noted for stating

50
0:03:00.953,000 --> 0:03:04,000
that he is not a believer who goes to bed on a full stomach

51
0:03:05.262,000 --> 0:03:07,000
when his neighbor to his side is hungry.

52
0:03:08.456,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And all through the New Testament,

53
0:03:10.383,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Jesus Christ talks about loving your neighbors as yourselves,

54
0:03:14.654,000 --> 0:03:16,000
giving to the poor, caring for the sick,

55
0:03:18.604,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and James, too, says that "faith without works is dead."

56
0:03:23.236,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So I strongly believe that faith-based organizations have a critical role to play

57
0:03:28.593,000 --> 0:03:3,000
in driving social impact in Africa.

58
0:03:31.321,000 --> 0:03:35,000
But for this to occur, we need three critical changes.

59
0:03:36.355,000 --> 0:03:38,000
The first is that we need to change our mindsets.

60
0:03:39.983,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Both as people of faith and of those who are not religious,

61
0:03:43.539,000 --> 0:03:45,000
their perceptions of those of us who are people of faith.

62
0:03:47.471,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Now, for people of faith and those of us who are religious,

63
0:03:51.681,000 --> 0:03:53,000
we often say, "If God wills, I'll do this;

64
0:03:54.512,000 --> 0:03:56,000
inshallah, I'll do that --

65
0:03:56.822,000 --> 0:03:58,000
by God's grace, I'll do this."

66
0:03:59.988,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Now there are many things, I believe, that we can control --

67
0:04:04.108,000 --> 0:04:05,000
some we cannot.

68
0:04:06.431,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I believe that God is all-powerful,

69
0:04:08.459,000 --> 0:04:09,000
but he's not a micromanager.

70
0:04:11.066,000 --> 0:04:12,000
(Laughter)

71
0:04:13.082,000 --> 0:04:16,000
He has sent us here as his change agents,

72
0:04:16.329,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and we must stop making excuses

73
0:04:18.234,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and using him.

74
0:04:20.478,000 --> 0:04:22,000
That means that if you're a teacher,

75
0:04:22.852,000 --> 0:04:24,000
go to school and give your students the best.

76
0:04:25.889,000 --> 0:04:26,000
If you're a public-sector official,

77
0:04:27.588,000 --> 0:04:3,000
release the funds meant for that school or public health-care center

78
0:04:31.144,000 --> 0:04:34,000
instead of stealing it for your personal purposes.

79
0:04:35.629,000 --> 0:04:39,000
By claiming that we have no power over our past, present and future,

80
0:04:40.426,000 --> 0:04:43,000
we give too much authority to the wicked

81
0:04:43.919,000 --> 0:04:46,000
who steal funds and beg God for forgiveness.

82
0:04:49.376,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Now for those of you who are not religious,

83
0:04:51.465,000 --> 0:04:53,000
you also have to change your mindsets about us.

84
0:04:54.449,000 --> 0:04:56,000
There are many of us who are hardworking,

85
0:04:57.13,000 --> 0:04:59,000
ethical and intellectual.

86
0:04:59.694,000 --> 0:05:,000
It might surprise you.

87
0:05:00.969,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Laughter)

88
0:05:03.203,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Now the second step

89
0:05:04.706,000 --> 0:05:07,000
is that we have to utilize our resources and assets

90
0:05:08.247,000 --> 0:05:09,000
for social impact.

91
0:05:10.052,000 --> 0:05:11,000
In England,

92
0:05:11.36,000 --> 0:05:16,000
1,900 churches have been shut down since 1969,

93
0:05:17.291,000 --> 0:05:19,000
due to shrinking congregations,

94
0:05:19.942,000 --> 0:05:21,000
while in Africa, every single day,

95
0:05:22.212,000 --> 0:05:23,000
a church or mosque is being built.

96
0:05:24.728,000 --> 0:05:27,000
In some communities, you might not find a public health center,

97
0:05:27.832,000 --> 0:05:29,000
a post office or even a school,

98
0:05:30.281,000 --> 0:05:31,000
but you'll find a church or mosque.

99
0:05:32.842,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Some of these churches and mosques are world-class,

100
0:05:36.659,000 --> 0:05:37,000
with excellent audio-visual systems,

101
0:05:38.669,000 --> 0:05:39,000
wonderful meeting spaces,

102
0:05:40.523,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and they organize events that rival international concerts.

103
0:05:44.935,000 --> 0:05:47,000
The sad reality is that many of them are empty during the week.

104
0:05:49.939,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I live in the Lekki area of Lagos,

105
0:05:53.264,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and in my community, there are at least 50 really nice churches,

106
0:05:57.708,000 --> 0:05:59,000
but there's no adult literacy center,

107
0:06:00.27,000 --> 0:06:01,000
no homeless shelter

108
0:06:02.183,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and very few public schools and hospitals.

109
0:06:05.601,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Many of these spaces could be utilized for social change.

110
0:06:11.258,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Imagine if every single church in Lekki opened its doors

111
0:06:16.235,000 --> 0:06:17,000
to the homeless at night,

112
0:06:18.013,000 --> 0:06:22,000
gave them a sleeping bag, a warm meal and a voucher in the morning

113
0:06:22.528,000 --> 0:06:23,000
to learn a vocational course,

114
0:06:24.392,000 --> 0:06:27,000
offered by the unemployed youth who attend that church.

115
0:06:27.48,000 --> 0:06:29,000
That would demonstrate what we preach

116
0:06:30.472,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and what we speak about as people of faith,

117
0:06:33.831,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and what led me to Christianity in the first place.

118
0:06:38.675,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Similarly, we have to utilize our resources for social change.

119
0:06:45.506,000 --> 0:06:48,000
The 2016 "why give" survey conducted in Kenya

120
0:06:49.301,000 --> 0:06:54,000
reveals that close to 60 percent of adults give to faith-based organizations --

121
0:06:55.068,000 --> 0:06:57,000
even more than they give their extended families.

122
0:06:58.165,000 --> 0:06:59,000
This is not unique to Kenya.

123
0:07:00.681,000 --> 0:07:01,000
It's quite prevalent across Africa.

124
0:07:03.395,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Many of our faith-based organizations have tremendous amounts of wealth

125
0:07:07.246,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that can be utilized for social change.

126
0:07:10.99,000 --> 0:07:13,000
We have to check the sources of uses of these funds

127
0:07:14.059,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and curb the excesses by our faith-based organizations.

128
0:07:18.607,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Now, this will require courage on the part of members,

129
0:07:22.439,000 --> 0:07:26,000
who will have to put their imams and priests on straight salaries,

130
0:07:26.918,000 --> 0:07:29,000
require audited financial statements that will be published

131
0:07:31.583,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and even reject contributions from unethical sources.

132
0:07:36.893,000 --> 0:07:37,000
But it's possible.

133
0:07:38.669,000 --> 0:07:41,000
We're already seeing positive examples in South Africa and Kenya,

134
0:07:42.09,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and the organizations,

135
0:07:43.265,000 --> 0:07:46,000
such as the Africa Council for Accreditation and Accountability

136
0:07:47.075,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that's checking faith-based organizations

137
0:07:49.361,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and ensuring that they comply with biblical standards of stewardship.

138
0:07:54.824,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Now, the third step

139
0:07:56.594,000 --> 0:07:58,000
is that we have to partner with all stakeholders,

140
0:07:59.309,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and this is especially relevant for the non-religious in the audience.

141
0:08:04.024,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Recognizing the power and potential of faith-based organizations,

142
0:08:09.752,000 --> 0:08:12,000
leveraging their assets, their scale,

143
0:08:12.871,000 --> 0:08:14,000
the public trust and credibility they have,

144
0:08:15.119,000 --> 0:08:16,000
their lower operating costs,

145
0:08:16.478,000 --> 0:08:17,000
their access to the grassroots

146
0:08:17.988,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and their presence abroad.

147
0:08:19.802,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Politicians recognize this,

148
0:08:21.761,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and campaign seasons are always filled with stops and picture opportunities

149
0:08:26.079,000 --> 0:08:27,000
with leading faith leaders.

150
0:08:28.214,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Sadly, once elected,

151
0:08:29.699,000 --> 0:08:32,000
many of these faith-based organizations are ignored.

152
0:08:33.211,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And in fact, a World Bank survey revealed

153
0:08:35.64,000 --> 0:08:4,000
that 30 to 70 percent of assets owned by medical organizations in Africa

154
0:08:41.434,000 --> 0:08:43,000
are actually owned by faith-based organizations,

155
0:08:44.062,000 --> 0:08:48,000
but that there's very little collaboration between the faith community

156
0:08:48.206,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and public health-care systems.

157
0:08:50.835,000 --> 0:08:53,000
One positive example is from Ghana,

158
0:08:53.903,000 --> 0:08:57,000
where the Ghana Catholic Health Service partnered with a range of stakeholders

159
0:08:58.376,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and was able to realize a 31 percent reduction in mortality.

160
0:09:05.47,000 --> 0:09:08,000
I believe there's so much potential that can be realized

161
0:09:08.677,000 --> 0:09:1,000
when we walk across the divide of faith

162
0:09:11.629,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and, hand in hand, try to solve many of our problems.

163
0:09:15.471,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Similarly, faith-based organizations can support the transfer

164
0:09:18.768,000 --> 0:09:19,000
of critical skills and knowledge.

165
0:09:20.922,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Many of you in the NGO community or in the private sectors

166
0:09:24.199,000 --> 0:09:28,000
realize how difficult it is to even attract 150 to 200 people

167
0:09:28.897,000 --> 0:09:29,000
to your conferences,

168
0:09:30.087,000 --> 0:09:31,000
sometimes even offering stipends,

169
0:09:32.002,000 --> 0:09:34,000
reimbursements of transportation costs.

170
0:09:34.128,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Meanwhile, faith-based organizations draw thousands and millions

171
0:09:38.637,000 --> 0:09:39,000
every Sunday or Friday ...

172
0:09:42.077,000 --> 0:09:45,000
with the promise of a good sermon.

173
0:09:46.534,000 --> 0:09:49,000
The truth is we cannot address issues around family planning

174
0:09:50.392,000 --> 0:09:52,000
without faith-based organizations in Africa.

175
0:09:53.775,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Issues such as democratic rights and voter registration,

176
0:09:56.459,000 --> 0:09:58,000
ensuring that every member of a congregation

177
0:09:58.983,000 --> 0:09:59,000
has a voter registration card,

178
0:10:00.856,000 --> 0:10:02,000
understands their democratic rights

179
0:10:03.185,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and can exercise that.

180
0:10:06.291,000 --> 0:10:08,000
I really think it's critical that we consider partnering

181
0:10:09.244,000 --> 0:10:11,000
with faith-based organizations to deliver social impact.

182
0:10:13.39,000 --> 0:10:16,000
It's also important to note that African faith-based organizations

183
0:10:16.916,000 --> 0:10:17,000
have a strong presence globally.

184
0:10:19.324,000 --> 0:10:23,000
There are over 2,000 African nuns and priests in leadership positions

185
0:10:23.468,000 --> 0:10:24,000
in Europe,

186
0:10:24.899,000 --> 0:10:27,000
with more influence than some of our diplomatic envoys,

187
0:10:28.463,000 --> 0:10:3,000
operating at a fraction of the cost.

188
0:10:30.757,000 --> 0:10:33,000
They can serve as influencers and supporters.

189
0:10:34.274,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Similarly, some African churches have a presence

190
0:10:37.567,000 --> 0:10:38,000
in countries across the globe,

191
0:10:39.113,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and the Redeemed Christian Church of God has a presence in 196 countries,

192
0:10:43.59,000 --> 0:10:46,000
serving as a bridge to the diaspora and providing support.

193
0:10:47.461,000 --> 0:10:51,000
If our public-sector organizations could partner with these institutions,

194
0:10:51.741,000 --> 0:10:54,000
we could unlock the potential of our diaspora populations.

195
0:10:56.986,000 --> 0:10:59,000
I know some of you are still struggling with this topic,

196
0:11:00.496,000 --> 0:11:02,000
but I challenge you to think about it.

197
0:11:02.798,000 --> 0:11:04,000
A wise man once said, "Faith is a risk,

198
0:11:06.099,000 --> 0:11:09,000
but it's a risk that I cannot afford not to take."

199
0:11:09.999,000 --> 0:11:13,000
I would suggest that partnerships with faith-based organizations are a risk,

200
0:11:14.399,000 --> 0:11:18,000
but one that all stakeholders that are committed to social impact in Africa

201
0:11:19.008,000 --> 0:11:2,000
cannot afford not to take.

202
0:11:21.942,000 --> 0:11:24,000
I often reflect on my conversation with that young boy,

203
0:11:25.118,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and I believe I should have ended it a little differently.

204
0:11:28.372,000 --> 0:11:31,000
First, I should have commended him for asking tough questions.

205
0:11:32.537,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Africa needs more young people who challenge the status quo,

206
0:11:35.984,000 --> 0:11:36,000
even in the faith communities.

207
0:11:38.698,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Secondly, I should have given him a little more hope.

208
0:11:42.083,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Not hope in the afterlife,

209
0:11:43.731,000 --> 0:11:46,000
but hope in Africa today,

210
0:11:46.819,000 --> 0:11:47,000
because the faithful are powerful.

211
0:11:49.636,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Not just because of their beliefs but because of their assets,

212
0:11:53.002,000 --> 0:11:56,000
their resources, their army of volunteers,

213
0:11:56.827,000 --> 0:12:,000
and because working together, across the divide,

214
0:12:01.094,000 --> 0:12:06,000
we can live as positive examples for what our children --

215
0:12:06.166,000 --> 0:12:07,000
my children, your children --

216
0:12:07.756,000 --> 0:12:08,000
deserve to see.

217
0:12:09.472,000 --> 0:12:12,000
An Africa that demonstrates that God loves Africans

218
0:12:13.089,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and that we are just as capable as any other world region

219
0:12:16.626,000 --> 0:12:17,000
in solving our problems

220
0:12:18.24,000 --> 0:12:19,000
in peace ...

221
0:12:20.314,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and love.

222
0:12:23.361,000 --> 0:12:25,000
I love this quote that says,

223
0:12:26.194,000 --> 0:12:31,000
"Hope is the ability to hear the melody of the future.

224
0:12:32.855,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Faith is the willingness and the courage

225
0:12:35.903,000 --> 0:12:36,000
to dance to it today."

226
0:12:38.889,000 --> 0:12:42,000
I hope that we, as people of faith,

227
0:12:43.009,000 --> 0:12:46,000
can truly live up to the promise of social impact

228
0:12:46.739,000 --> 0:12:49,000
that we have been called to do as change agents in society.

229
0:12:51.232,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And I believe that working with you,

230
0:12:53.35,000 --> 0:12:54,000
all stakeholders,

231
0:12:54.625,000 --> 0:12:57,000
we can truly solve Africa's most pressing challenges.

232
0:12:58.483,000 --> 0:12:59,000
I have that hope ...

233
0:13:00.986,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and I have the faith,

234
0:13:02.955,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and I've started to dance.

235
0:13:04.625,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Won't you join me?

236
0:13:05.89,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Thank you.

237
0:13:07.065,000 --> 0:13:1,000
(Applause)

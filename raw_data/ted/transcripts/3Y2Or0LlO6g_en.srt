1
0:00:16.379,000 --> 0:00:19,000
You may have heard about the Koran's idea of paradise

2
0:00:19.832,000 --> 0:00:21,000
being 72 virgins,

3
0:00:22.135,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and I promise I will come back to those virgins.

4
0:00:25.112,000 --> 0:00:27,000
But in fact, here in the Northwest, we're living very close

5
0:00:28.09,000 --> 0:00:3,000
to the real Koranic idea of paradise,

6
0:00:30.717,000 --> 0:00:35,000
defined 36 times as "gardens watered by running streams."

7
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Since I live on a houseboat on the running stream of Lake Union,

8
0:00:41.421,000 --> 0:00:43,000
this makes perfect sense to me.

9
0:00:43.667,000 --> 0:00:46,000
But the thing is, how come it's news to most people?

10
0:00:47.967,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I know many well-intentioned non-Muslims

11
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
who've begun reading the Koran, but given up,

12
0:00:52.851,000 --> 0:00:54,000
disconcerted by its "otherness."

13
0:00:56.172,000 --> 0:00:58,000
The historian Thomas Carlyle considered Muhammad

14
0:00:58.924,000 --> 0:00:59,000
one of the world's greatest heroes,

15
0:01:00.924,000 --> 0:01:02,000
yet even he called the Koran

16
0:01:03.36,000 --> 0:01:08,000
"as toilsome reading as I ever undertook; a wearisome, confused jumble."

17
0:01:08.75,000 --> 0:01:1,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:11.05,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Part of the problem, I think, is that we imagine

19
0:01:14.08,000 --> 0:01:17,000
that the Koran can be read as we usually read a book --

20
0:01:17.76,000 --> 0:01:19,000
as though we can curl up with it on a rainy afternoon

21
0:01:20.76,000 --> 0:01:21,000
with a bowl of popcorn within reach,

22
0:01:22.76,000 --> 0:01:23,000
as though God --

23
0:01:24.304,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and the Koran is entirely in the voice of God speaking to Muhammad --

24
0:01:28.07,000 --> 0:01:3,000
were just another author on the best-seller list.

25
0:01:32.935,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Yet, the fact that so few people do actually read the Koran

26
0:01:37.012,000 --> 0:01:42,000
is precisely why it's so easy to quote -- that is, to misquote.

27
0:01:42.298,000 --> 0:01:43,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:43.346,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Phrases and snippets taken out of context

29
0:01:45.76,000 --> 0:01:47,000
in what I call the "highlighter version,"

30
0:01:47.86,000 --> 0:01:5,000
which is the one favored by both Muslim fundamentalists

31
0:01:50.971,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and anti-Muslim Islamophobes.

32
0:01:54.256,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So this past spring,

33
0:01:56.106,000 --> 0:02:,000
as I was gearing up to begin writing a biography of Muhammad,

34
0:02:00.192,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I realized I needed to read the Koran properly --

35
0:02:04.45,000 --> 0:02:06,000
as properly as I could, that is.

36
0:02:07.236,000 --> 0:02:1,000
My Arabic is reduced by now to wielding a dictionary,

37
0:02:10.37,000 --> 0:02:12,000
so I took four well-known translations

38
0:02:12.76,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and decided to read them side by side, verse by verse,

39
0:02:16.949,000 --> 0:02:2,000
along with a transliteration and the original seventh-century Arabic.

40
0:02:24.072,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Now, I did have an advantage.

41
0:02:27.743,000 --> 0:02:31,000
My last book was about the story behind the Shi'a-Sunni split,

42
0:02:32.435,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and for that, I'd worked closely with the earliest Islamic histories,

43
0:02:35.872,000 --> 0:02:38,000
so I knew the events to which the Koran constantly refers,

44
0:02:39.658,000 --> 0:02:4,000
its frame of reference.

45
0:02:41.659,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I knew enough, that is, to know that I'd be a tourist in the Koran --

46
0:02:46.76,000 --> 0:02:47,000
an informed one,

47
0:02:48.76,000 --> 0:02:49,000
an experienced one, even,

48
0:02:50.259,000 --> 0:02:52,000
but still an outsider,

49
0:02:52.632,000 --> 0:02:55,000
an agnostic Jew reading someone else's holy book.

50
0:02:56.478,000 --> 0:02:58,000
(Laughter)

51
0:02:58.577,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So I read slowly.

52
0:03:00.171,000 --> 0:03:04,000
(Laughter)

53
0:03:04.68,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I'd set aside three weeks for this project,

54
0:03:07.191,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and that, I think, is what is meant by "hubris" --

55
0:03:10.085,000 --> 0:03:14,000
(Laughter)

56
0:03:14.395,000 --> 0:03:16,000
because it turned out to be three months.

57
0:03:16.595,000 --> 0:03:17,000
(Laughter)

58
0:03:18.506,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I did resist the temptation to skip to the back,

59
0:03:21.028,000 --> 0:03:24,000
where the shorter and more clearly mystical chapters are.

60
0:03:24.219,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But every time I thought I was beginning to get a handle on the Koran --

61
0:03:27.76,000 --> 0:03:29,000
that feeling of "I get it now" --

62
0:03:30.066,000 --> 0:03:32,000
it would slip away overnight,

63
0:03:32.153,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and I'd come back in the morning,

64
0:03:33.831,000 --> 0:03:35,000
wondering if I wasn't lost in a strange land.

65
0:03:37.298,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And yet, the terrain was very familiar.

66
0:03:40.577,000 --> 0:03:42,000
The Koran declares that it comes to renew the message

67
0:03:43.464,000 --> 0:03:44,000
of the Torah and the Gospels.

68
0:03:44.921,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So one-third of it reprises the stories of Biblical figures

69
0:03:48.433,000 --> 0:03:52,000
like Abraham, Moses, Joseph, Mary, Jesus.

70
0:03:54.001,000 --> 0:03:56,000
God himself was utterly familiar

71
0:03:56.669,000 --> 0:03:59,000
from his earlier manifestation as Yahweh,

72
0:03:59.76,000 --> 0:04:02,000
jealously insisting on no other gods.

73
0:04:03.898,000 --> 0:04:08,000
The presence of camels, mountains, desert wells and springs

74
0:04:08.986,000 --> 0:04:11,000
took me back to the year I spent wandering the Sinai Desert.

75
0:04:13.186,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And then there was the language, the rhythmic cadence of it,

76
0:04:16.76,000 --> 0:04:19,000
reminding me of evenings spent listening to Bedouin elders

77
0:04:20.005,000 --> 0:04:22,000
recite hours-long narrative poems

78
0:04:23.006,000 --> 0:04:24,000
entirely from memory.

79
0:04:26.087,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And I began to grasp why it's said

80
0:04:30.814,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that the Koran is really the Koran only in Arabic.

81
0:04:35.799,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Take the Fatihah, the seven-verse opening chapter

82
0:04:39.711,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that is the Lord's Prayer and the Shema Yisrael of Islam combined.

83
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It's just 29 words in Arabic,

84
0:04:47.321,000 --> 0:04:5,000
but anywhere from 65 to 72 in translation.

85
0:04:51.186,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And yet the more you add, the more seems to go missing.

86
0:04:56.127,000 --> 0:05:,000
The Arabic has an incantatory, almost hypnotic quality

87
0:05:00.76,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that begs to be heard rather than read,

88
0:05:04.042,000 --> 0:05:05,000
felt more than analyzed.

89
0:05:06.505,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It wants to be chanted out loud,

90
0:05:08.588,000 --> 0:05:1,000
to sound its music in the ear and on the tongue.

91
0:05:12.015,000 --> 0:05:16,000
So the Koran in English is a kind of shadow of itself,

92
0:05:16.76,000 --> 0:05:18,000
or as Arthur Arberry called his version,

93
0:05:19.615,000 --> 0:05:2,000
"an interpretation."

94
0:05:22.76,000 --> 0:05:24,000
But all is not lost in translation.

95
0:05:26.06,000 --> 0:05:28,000
As the Koran promises, patience is rewarded,

96
0:05:28.76,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and there are many surprises --

97
0:05:30.333,000 --> 0:05:33,000
a degree of environmental awareness, for instance,

98
0:05:33.513,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and of humans as mere stewards of God's creation,

99
0:05:37.106,000 --> 0:05:38,000
unmatched in the Bible.

100
0:05:39.609,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And where the Bible is addressed exclusively to men,

101
0:05:42.51,000 --> 0:05:44,000
using the second- and third-person masculine,

102
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
the Koran includes women --

103
0:05:47.76,000 --> 0:05:48,000
talking, for instance,

104
0:05:49.208,000 --> 0:05:51,000
of believing men and believing women,

105
0:05:51.656,000 --> 0:05:54,000
honorable men and honorable women.

106
0:05:56.244,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Or take the infamous verse about killing the unbelievers.

107
0:06:01.111,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Yes, it does say that,

108
0:06:02.76,000 --> 0:06:04,000
but in a very specific context:

109
0:06:05.51,000 --> 0:06:09,000
the anticipated conquest of the sanctuary city of Mecca,

110
0:06:09.871,000 --> 0:06:11,000
where fighting was usually forbidden.

111
0:06:12.419,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And the permission comes hedged about with qualifiers.

112
0:06:15.966,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Not "You must kill unbelievers in Mecca,"

113
0:06:18.76,000 --> 0:06:2,000
but you can, you are allowed to,

114
0:06:21.023,000 --> 0:06:25,000
but only after a grace period is over,

115
0:06:25.418,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and only if there's no other pact in place,

116
0:06:28.3,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and only if they try to stop you getting to the Kaaba,

117
0:06:31.76,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and only if they attack you first.

118
0:06:34.5,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And even then -- God is merciful;

119
0:06:38.129,000 --> 0:06:4,000
forgiveness is supreme --

120
0:06:40.182,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and so, essentially,

121
0:06:42.924,000 --> 0:06:43,000
better if you don't.

122
0:06:44.401,000 --> 0:06:47,000
(Laughter)

123
0:06:47.867,000 --> 0:06:49,000
This was perhaps the biggest surprise --

124
0:06:50.654,000 --> 0:06:52,000
how flexible the Koran is,

125
0:06:52.76,000 --> 0:06:55,000
at least in minds that are not fundamentally inflexible.

126
0:06:57.656,000 --> 0:07:,000
"Some of these verses are definite in meaning," it says,

127
0:07:01.327,000 --> 0:07:02,000
"and others are ambiguous."

128
0:07:04.141,000 --> 0:07:07,000
The perverse at heart will seek out the ambiguities,

129
0:07:07.967,000 --> 0:07:11,000
trying to create discord by pinning down meanings of their own.

130
0:07:12.62,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Only God knows the true meaning.

131
0:07:16.291,000 --> 0:07:19,000
The phrase "God is subtle" appears again and again,

132
0:07:20.277,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and indeed, the whole of the Koran is far more subtle

133
0:07:22.903,000 --> 0:07:24,000
than most of us have been led to believe.

134
0:07:25.431,000 --> 0:07:3,000
As in, for instance, that little matter of virgins and paradise.

135
0:07:31.704,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Old-fashioned orientalism comes into play here.

136
0:07:35.851,000 --> 0:07:39,000
The word used four times is "houris,"

137
0:07:40.453,000 --> 0:07:44,000
rendered as dark-eyed maidens with swelling breasts,

138
0:07:44.934,000 --> 0:07:47,000
or as fair, high-bosomed virgins.

139
0:07:49.199,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Yet all there is in the original Arabic is that one word: houris.

140
0:07:54.505,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Not a swelling breast or high bosom in sight.

141
0:07:57.033,000 --> 0:07:59,000
(Laughter)

142
0:07:59.561,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Now this may be a way of saying "pure beings," like in angels,

143
0:08:04.142,000 --> 0:08:07,000
or it may be like the Greek "kouros" or "kore,"

144
0:08:07.179,000 --> 0:08:08,000
an eternal youth.

145
0:08:08.545,000 --> 0:08:1,000
But the truth is, nobody really knows.

146
0:08:11.305,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And that's the point.

147
0:08:13.466,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Because the Koran is quite clear

148
0:08:15.906,000 --> 0:08:19,000
when it says that you'll be "a new creation in paradise,"

149
0:08:20.76,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and that you will be "recreated in a form unknown to you,"

150
0:08:25.913,000 --> 0:08:27,000
which seems to me a far more appealing prospect

151
0:08:28.472,000 --> 0:08:29,000
than a virgin.

152
0:08:30.075,000 --> 0:08:36,000
(Laughter)

153
0:08:38.252,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And that number 72 never appears.

154
0:08:41.587,000 --> 0:08:44,000
There are no 72 virgins in the Koran.

155
0:08:45.277,000 --> 0:08:48,000
That idea only came into being 300 years later,

156
0:08:48.546,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and most Islamic scholars see it as the equivalent

157
0:08:51.547,000 --> 0:08:54,000
of people with wings sitting on clouds and strumming harps.

158
0:08:56.593,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Paradise is quite the opposite.

It's not virginity;

it's plenty.

Thank you.

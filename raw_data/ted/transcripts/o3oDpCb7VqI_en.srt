1
0:00:12.921,000 --> 0:00:13,000
This is my great uncle,

2
0:00:14.918,000 --> 0:00:17,000
my father's father's younger brother.

3
0:00:17.936,000 --> 0:00:18,000
His name was Joe McKenna.

4
0:00:20.142,000 --> 0:00:24,000
He was a young husband and a semi-pro basketball player

5
0:00:25.089,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and a fireman in New York City.

6
0:00:29.407,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Family history says he loved being a fireman,

7
0:00:32.007,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and so in 1938, on one of his days off,

8
0:00:35.542,000 --> 0:00:37,000
he elected to hang out at the firehouse.

9
0:00:39.019,000 --> 0:00:43,000
To make himself useful that day, he started polishing all the brass,

10
0:00:43.218,000 --> 0:00:46,000
the railings on the fire truck, the fittings on the walls,

11
0:00:46.612,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and one of the fire hose nozzles,

12
0:00:48.957,000 --> 0:00:5,000
a giant, heavy piece of metal,

13
0:00:51.465,000 --> 0:00:54,000
toppled off a shelf and hit him.

14
0:00:55.574,000 --> 0:00:58,000
A few days later, his shoulder started to hurt.

15
0:00:59.382,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Two days after that, he spiked a fever.

16
0:01:02.656,000 --> 0:01:04,000
The fever climbed and climbed.

17
0:01:05.141,000 --> 0:01:06,000
His wife was taking care of him,

18
0:01:07.091,000 --> 0:01:11,000
but nothing she did made a difference, and when they got the local doctor in,

19
0:01:11.393,000 --> 0:01:13,000
nothing he did mattered either.

20
0:01:14.149,000 --> 0:01:17,000
They flagged down a cab and took him to the hospital.

21
0:01:17.911,000 --> 0:01:2,000
The nurses there recognized right away that he had an infection,

22
0:01:21.905,000 --> 0:01:25,000
what at the time they would have called "blood poisoning,"

23
0:01:26.061,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and though they probably didn't say it,

24
0:01:28.174,000 --> 0:01:29,000
they would have known right away

25
0:01:30.031,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that there was nothing they could do.

26
0:01:33.77,000 --> 0:01:36,000
There was nothing they could do because the things we use now

27
0:01:36.788,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to cure infections didn't exist yet.

28
0:01:39.737,000 --> 0:01:42,000
The first test of penicillin, the first antibiotic,

29
0:01:43.173,000 --> 0:01:45,000
was three years in the future.

30
0:01:45.843,000 --> 0:01:49,000
People who got infections either recovered, if they were lucky,

31
0:01:50.547,000 --> 0:01:51,000
or they died.

32
0:01:52.322,000 --> 0:01:54,000
My great uncle was not lucky.

33
0:01:54.411,000 --> 0:01:57,000
He was in the hospital for a week, shaking with chills,

34
0:01:57.708,000 --> 0:01:58,000
dehydrated and delirious,

35
0:01:59.566,000 --> 0:02:01,000
sinking into a coma as his organs failed.

36
0:02:02.468,000 --> 0:02:04,000
His condition grew so desperate

37
0:02:04.604,000 --> 0:02:08,000
that the people from his firehouse lined up to give him transfusions

38
0:02:09.234,000 --> 0:02:12,000
hoping to dilute the infection surging through his blood.

39
0:02:13.497,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Nothing worked. He died.

40
0:02:17.143,000 --> 0:02:19,000
He was 30 years old.

41
0:02:20.115,000 --> 0:02:21,000
If you look back through history,

42
0:02:22.088,000 --> 0:02:25,000
most people died the way my great uncle died.

43
0:02:25.362,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Most people didn't die of cancer or heart disease,

44
0:02:28.032,000 --> 0:02:32,000
the lifestyle diseases that afflict us in the West today.

45
0:02:32.49,000 --> 0:02:35,000
They didn't die of those diseases because they didn't live long enough

46
0:02:36.229,000 --> 0:02:37,000
to develop them.

47
0:02:38.225,000 --> 0:02:4,000
They died of injuries --

48
0:02:40.338,000 --> 0:02:42,000
being gored by an ox,

49
0:02:42.823,000 --> 0:02:43,000
shot on a battlefield,

50
0:02:44.727,000 --> 0:02:47,000
crushed in one of the new factories of the Industrial Revolution --

51
0:02:48.465,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and most of the time from infection,

52
0:02:51.846,000 --> 0:02:54,000
which finished what those injuries began.

53
0:02:56.492,000 --> 0:02:59,000
All of that changed when antibiotics arrived.

54
0:03:00.599,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Suddenly, infections that had been a death sentence

55
0:03:04.198,000 --> 0:03:07,000
became something you recovered from in days.

56
0:03:07.588,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It seemed like a miracle,

57
0:03:10.63,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and ever since, we have been living inside the golden epoch of the miracle drugs.

58
0:03:17.294,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And now, we are coming to an end of it.

59
0:03:21.241,000 --> 0:03:26,000
My great uncle died in the last days of the pre-antibiotic era.

60
0:03:26.303,000 --> 0:03:31,000
We stand today on the threshold of the post-antibiotic era,

61
0:03:31.457,000 --> 0:03:34,000
in the earliest days of a time when simple infections

62
0:03:35.219,000 --> 0:03:39,000
such as the one Joe had will kill people once again.

63
0:03:40.884,000 --> 0:03:43,000
In fact, they already are.

64
0:03:44.785,000 --> 0:03:46,000
People are dying of infections again because of a phenomenon

65
0:03:47.618,000 --> 0:03:49,000
called antibiotic resistance.

66
0:03:50.381,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Briefly, it works like this.

67
0:03:52.119,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Bacteria compete against each other for resources, for food,

68
0:03:57.091,000 --> 0:04:01,000
by manufacturing lethal compounds that they direct against each other.

69
0:04:01.758,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Other bacteria, to protect themselves,

70
0:04:04.103,000 --> 0:04:07,000
evolve defenses against that chemical attack.

71
0:04:07.354,000 --> 0:04:09,000
When we first made antibiotics,

72
0:04:09.676,000 --> 0:04:13,000
we took those compounds into the lab and made our own versions of them,

73
0:04:13.878,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and bacteria responded to our attack the way they always had.

74
0:04:19.674,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Here is what happened next:

75
0:04:22.098,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Penicillin was distributed in 1943,

76
0:04:25.488,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and widespread penicillin resistance arrived by 1945.

77
0:04:30.619,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Vancomycin arrived in 1972,

78
0:04:33.568,000 --> 0:04:36,000
vancomycin resistance in 1988.

79
0:04:37.028,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Imipenem in 1985,

80
0:04:39.15,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and resistance to in 1998.

81
0:04:42.192,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Daptomycin, one of the most recent drugs, in 2003,

82
0:04:45.86,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and resistance to it just a year later in 2004.

83
0:04:50.575,000 --> 0:04:53,000
For 70 years, we played a game of leapfrog --

84
0:04:54.335,000 --> 0:04:56,000
our drug and their resistance,

85
0:04:57.261,000 --> 0:05:,000
and then another drug, and then resistance again --

86
0:05:00.906,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and now the game is ending.

87
0:05:03.437,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Bacteria develop resistance so quickly that pharmaceutical companies

88
0:05:07.477,000 --> 0:05:11,000
have decided making antibiotics is not in their best interest,

89
0:05:11.842,000 --> 0:05:13,000
so there are infections moving across the world

90
0:05:14.652,000 --> 0:05:17,000
for which, out of the more than 100 antibiotics

91
0:05:18.111,000 --> 0:05:2,000
available on the market,

92
0:05:20.34,000 --> 0:05:23,000
two drugs might work with side effects,

93
0:05:23.754,000 --> 0:05:25,000
or one drug,

94
0:05:26.238,000 --> 0:05:27,000
or none.

95
0:05:28.096,000 --> 0:05:29,000
This is what that looks like.

96
0:05:30.278,000 --> 0:05:34,000
In 2000, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC,

97
0:05:34.458,000 --> 0:05:36,000
identified a single case

98
0:05:36.501,000 --> 0:05:38,000
in a hospital in North Carolina

99
0:05:38.753,000 --> 0:05:41,000
of an infection resistant to all but two drugs.

100
0:05:42.886,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Today, that infection, known as KPC,

101
0:05:47.205,000 --> 0:05:49,000
has spread to every state but three,

102
0:05:49.805,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and to South America, Europe

103
0:05:52.15,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and the Middle East.

104
0:05:54.867,000 --> 0:05:56,000
In 2008, doctors in Sweden

105
0:05:57.189,000 --> 0:05:59,000
diagnosed a man from India with a different infection

106
0:05:59.975,000 --> 0:06:02,000
resistant to all but one drug that time.

107
0:06:03.69,000 --> 0:06:05,000
The gene that creates that resistance,

108
0:06:05.919,000 --> 0:06:11,000
known as NDM, has now spread from India into China, Asia, Africa,

109
0:06:12.444,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Europe and Canada, and the United States.

110
0:06:17.129,000 --> 0:06:19,000
It would be natural to hope

111
0:06:19.688,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that these infections are extraordinary cases,

112
0:06:23.287,000 --> 0:06:24,000
but in fact,

113
0:06:25.145,000 --> 0:06:27,000
in the United States and Europe,

114
0:06:27.606,000 --> 0:06:29,000
50,000 people a year

115
0:06:30.322,000 --> 0:06:34,000
die of infections which no drugs can help.

116
0:06:34.966,000 --> 0:06:37,000
A project chartered by the British government

117
0:06:38.008,000 --> 0:06:41,000
known as the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance

118
0:06:41.746,000 --> 0:06:48,000
estimates that the worldwide toll right now is 700,000 deaths a year.

119
0:06:50.291,000 --> 0:06:54,000
That is a lot of deaths,

120
0:06:54.655,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and yet, the chances are good that you don't feel at risk,

121
0:06:57.767,000 --> 0:07:,000
that you imagine these people were hospital patients

122
0:07:00.995,000 --> 0:07:01,000
in intensive care units

123
0:07:02.713,000 --> 0:07:05,000
or nursing home residents near the ends of their lives,

124
0:07:06.66,000 --> 0:07:09,000
people whose infections are remote from us,

125
0:07:09.841,000 --> 0:07:12,000
in situations we can't identify with.

126
0:07:14.455,000 --> 0:07:17,000
What you didn't think about, none of us do,

127
0:07:17.852,000 --> 0:07:21,000
is that antibiotics support almost all of modern life.

128
0:07:23.721,000 --> 0:07:25,000
If we lost antibiotics,

129
0:07:25.932,000 --> 0:07:26,000
here's what else we'd lose:

130
0:07:27.836,000 --> 0:07:31,000
First, any protection for people with weakened immune systems --

131
0:07:32.015,000 --> 0:07:35,000
cancer patients, AIDS patients,

132
0:07:35.475,000 --> 0:07:39,000
transplant recipients, premature babies.

133
0:07:39.979,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Next, any treatment that installs foreign objects in the body:

134
0:07:44.391,000 --> 0:07:47,000
stents for stroke, pumps for diabetes,

135
0:07:48.269,000 --> 0:07:51,000
dialysis, joint replacements.

136
0:07:52.193,000 --> 0:07:55,000
How many athletic baby boomers need new hips and knees?

137
0:07:55.908,000 --> 0:07:57,000
A recent study estimates that without antibiotics,

138
0:07:58.717,000 --> 0:08:01,000
one out of ever six would die.

139
0:08:02.664,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Next, we'd probably lose surgery.

140
0:08:05.869,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Many operations are preceded

141
0:08:08.191,000 --> 0:08:1,000
by prophylactic doses of antibiotics.

142
0:08:11.139,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Without that protection,

143
0:08:12.811,000 --> 0:08:16,000
we'd lose the ability to open the hidden spaces of the body.

144
0:08:17.015,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So no heart operations,

145
0:08:19.848,000 --> 0:08:21,000
no prostate biopsies,

146
0:08:22.68,000 --> 0:08:24,000
no Cesarean sections.

147
0:08:25.792,000 --> 0:08:29,000
We'd have to learn to fear infections that now seem minor.

148
0:08:30.784,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Strep throat used to cause heart failure.

149
0:08:34.592,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Skin infections led to amputations.

150
0:08:37.819,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Giving birth killed, in the cleanest hospitals,

151
0:08:40.722,000 --> 0:08:42,000
almost one woman out of every 100.

152
0:08:43.717,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Pneumonia took three children out of every 10.

153
0:08:49.22,000 --> 0:08:51,000
More than anything else,

154
0:08:51.333,000 --> 0:08:55,000
we'd lose the confident way we live our everyday lives.

155
0:08:56.836,000 --> 0:09:,000
If you knew that any injury could kill you,

156
0:09:01.043,000 --> 0:09:04,000
would you ride a motorcycle,

157
0:09:04.289,000 --> 0:09:07,000
bomb down a ski slope,

158
0:09:07.5,000 --> 0:09:1,000
climb a ladder to hang your Christmas lights,

159
0:09:10.976,000 --> 0:09:13,000
let your kid slide into home plate?

160
0:09:15.573,000 --> 0:09:18,000
After all, the first person to receive penicillin,

161
0:09:18.638,000 --> 0:09:21,000
a British policeman named Albert Alexander,

162
0:09:22.516,000 --> 0:09:26,000
who was so ravaged by infection that his scalp oozed pus

163
0:09:26.858,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and doctors had to take out an eye,

164
0:09:29.783,000 --> 0:09:32,000
was infected by doing something very simple.

165
0:09:34.172,000 --> 0:09:38,000
He walked into his garden and scratched his face on a thorn.

166
0:09:40.831,000 --> 0:09:43,000
That British project I mentioned which estimates that the worldwide toll

167
0:09:44.481,000 --> 0:09:47,000
right now is 700,000 deaths a year

168
0:09:48.358,000 --> 0:09:54,000
also predicts that if we can't get this under control by 2050,

169
0:09:54.535,000 --> 0:10:01,000
not long, the worldwide toll will be 10 million deaths a year.

170
0:10:02.127,000 --> 0:10:04,000
How did we get to this point

171
0:10:04.829,000 --> 0:10:06,000
where what we have to look forward to

172
0:10:06.864,000 --> 0:10:09,000
is those terrifying numbers?

173
0:10:10.347,000 --> 0:10:14,000
The difficult answer is, we did it to ourselves.

174
0:10:14.875,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Resistance is an inevitable biological process,

175
0:10:17.847,000 --> 0:10:21,000
but we bear the responsibility for accelerating it.

176
0:10:22.49,000 --> 0:10:25,000
We did this by squandering antibiotics

177
0:10:26.043,000 --> 0:10:3,000
with a heedlessness that now seems shocking.

178
0:10:31.408,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Penicillin was sold over the counter until the 1950s.

179
0:10:35.494,000 --> 0:10:38,000
In much of the developing world, most antibiotics still are.

180
0:10:39.209,000 --> 0:10:42,000
In the United States, 50 percent

181
0:10:42.971,000 --> 0:10:45,000
of the antibiotics given in hospitals are unnecessary.

182
0:10:46.663,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Forty-five percent of the prescriptions written in doctor's offices

183
0:10:51.037,000 --> 0:10:54,000
are for conditions that antibiotics cannot help.

184
0:10:56.577,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And that's just in healthcare.

185
0:10:59.247,000 --> 0:11:03,000
On much of the planet, most meat animals get antibiotics every day of their lives,

186
0:11:04.1,000 --> 0:11:06,000
not to cure illnesses,

187
0:11:06.376,000 --> 0:11:09,000
but to fatten them up and to protect them against

188
0:11:09.835,000 --> 0:11:12,000
the factory farm conditions they are raised in.

189
0:11:13.806,000 --> 0:11:16,000
In the United States, possibly 80 percent

190
0:11:16.824,000 --> 0:11:22,000
of the antibiotics sold every year go to farm animals, not to humans,

191
0:11:23.527,000 --> 0:11:26,000
creating resistant bacteria that move off the farm

192
0:11:27.203,000 --> 0:11:29,000
in water, in dust,

193
0:11:29.827,000 --> 0:11:31,000
in the meat the animals become.

194
0:11:32.985,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Aquaculture depends on antibiotics too,

195
0:11:35.91,000 --> 0:11:36,000
particularly in Asia,

196
0:11:37.559,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and fruit growing relies on antibiotics

197
0:11:40.902,000 --> 0:11:44,000
to protect apples, pears, citrus, against disease.

198
0:11:46.491,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And because bacteria can pass their DNA to each other

199
0:11:52.117,000 --> 0:11:56,000
like a traveler handing off a suitcase at an airport,

200
0:11:56.552,000 --> 0:12:,000
once we have encouraged that resistance into existence,

201
0:12:01.36,000 --> 0:12:03,000
there is no knowing where it will spread.

202
0:12:05.723,000 --> 0:12:06,000
This was predictable.

203
0:12:07.674,000 --> 0:12:09,000
In fact, it was predicted

204
0:12:10.506,000 --> 0:12:14,000
by Alexander Fleming, the man who discovered penicillin.

205
0:12:14.941,000 --> 0:12:17,000
He was given the Nobel Prize in 1945 in recognition,

206
0:12:18.935,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and in an interview shortly after, this is what he said:

207
0:12:23.282,000 --> 0:12:27,000
"The thoughtless person playing with penicillin treatment

208
0:12:27.549,000 --> 0:12:3,000
is morally responsible for the death of a man

209
0:12:30.823,000 --> 0:12:32,000
who succumbs to infection

210
0:12:33.147,000 --> 0:12:35,000
with a pencillin-resistant organism."

211
0:12:36.05,000 --> 0:12:4,000
He added, "I hope this evil can be averted."

212
0:12:40.986,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Can we avert it?

213
0:12:43.842,000 --> 0:12:46,000
There are companies working on novel antibiotics,

214
0:12:47.51,000 --> 0:12:5,000
things the superbugs have never seen before.

215
0:12:51.086,000 --> 0:12:53,000
We need those new drugs badly,

216
0:12:53.803,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and we need incentives:

217
0:12:56.055,000 --> 0:12:58,000
discovery grants, extended patents,

218
0:12:58.586,000 --> 0:13:04,000
prizes, to lure other companies into making antibiotics again.

219
0:13:05.343,000 --> 0:13:07,000
But that probably won't be enough.

220
0:13:08.059,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Here's why: Evolution always wins.

221
0:13:12.703,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Bacteria birth a new generation every 20 minutes.

222
0:13:16.627,000 --> 0:13:2,000
It takes pharmaceutical chemistry 10 years to derive a new drug.

223
0:13:21.41,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Every time we use an antibiotic,

224
0:13:24.266,000 --> 0:13:27,000
we give the bacteria billions of chances

225
0:13:27.54,000 --> 0:13:28,000
to crack the codes

226
0:13:29.281,000 --> 0:13:32,000
of the defenses we've constructed.

227
0:13:32.486,000 --> 0:13:34,000
There has never yet been a drug

228
0:13:34.877,000 --> 0:13:36,000
they could not defeat.

229
0:13:37.431,000 --> 0:13:4,000
This is asymmetric warfare,

230
0:13:40.961,000 --> 0:13:44,000
but we can change the outcome.

231
0:13:45.929,000 --> 0:13:51,000
We could build systems to harvest data to tell us automatically and specifically

232
0:13:52.334,000 --> 0:13:54,000
how antibiotics are being used.

233
0:13:55.263,000 --> 0:13:57,000
We could build gatekeeping into drug order systems

234
0:13:58.096,000 --> 0:14:01,000
so that every prescription gets a second look.

235
0:14:01.811,000 --> 0:14:07,000
We could require agriculture to give up antibiotic use.

236
0:14:08.243,000 --> 0:14:11,000
We could build surveillance systems

237
0:14:11.275,000 --> 0:14:15,000
to tell us where resistance is emerging next.

238
0:14:15.501,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Those are the tech solutions.

239
0:14:18.264,000 --> 0:14:2,000
They probably aren't enough either,

240
0:14:20.888,000 --> 0:14:23,000
unless we help.

241
0:14:27.785,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Antibiotic resistance is a habit.

242
0:14:30.479,000 --> 0:14:33,000
We all know how hard it is to change a habit.

243
0:14:33.567,000 --> 0:14:37,000
But as a society, we've done that in the past.

244
0:14:38.397,000 --> 0:14:41,000
People used to toss litter into the streets,

245
0:14:41.972,000 --> 0:14:42,000
used to not wear seatbelts,

246
0:14:43.737,000 --> 0:14:47,000
used to smoke inside public buildings.

247
0:14:48.404,000 --> 0:14:5,000
We don't do those things anymore.

248
0:14:51.144,000 --> 0:14:53,000
We don't trash the environment

249
0:14:53.466,000 --> 0:14:56,000
or court devastating accidents

250
0:14:56.623,000 --> 0:14:58,000
or expose others to the possibility of cancer,

251
0:14:59.595,000 --> 0:15:02,000
because we decided those things were expensive,

252
0:15:03.102,000 --> 0:15:07,000
destructive, not in our best interest.

253
0:15:07.815,000 --> 0:15:09,000
We changed social norms.

254
0:15:11.135,000 --> 0:15:15,000
We could change social norms around antibiotic use too.

255
0:15:17.499,000 --> 0:15:19,000
I know that the scale of antibiotic resistance

256
0:15:19.774,000 --> 0:15:2,000
seems overwhelming,

257
0:15:21.678,000 --> 0:15:24,000
but if you've ever bought a fluorescent lightbulb

258
0:15:25.138,000 --> 0:15:27,000
because you were concerned about climate change,

259
0:15:27.854,000 --> 0:15:3,000
or read the label on a box of crackers

260
0:15:30.989,000 --> 0:15:34,000
because you think about the deforestation from palm oil,

261
0:15:35.47,000 --> 0:15:37,000
you already know what it feels like

262
0:15:38.349,000 --> 0:15:43,000
to take a tiny step to address an overwhelming problem.

263
0:15:43.829,000 --> 0:15:47,000
We could take those kinds of steps for antibiotic use too.

264
0:15:48.31,000 --> 0:15:55,000
We could forgo giving an antibiotic if we're not sure it's the right one.

265
0:15:56.251,000 --> 0:16:02,000
We could stop insisting on a prescription for our kid's ear infection

266
0:16:02.564,000 --> 0:16:03,000
before we're sure what caused it.

267
0:16:05.678,000 --> 0:16:08,000
We could ask every restaurant,

268
0:16:09.045,000 --> 0:16:1,000
every supermarket,

269
0:16:10.856,000 --> 0:16:11,000
where their meat comes from.

270
0:16:12.806,000 --> 0:16:13,000
We could promise each other

271
0:16:14.64,000 --> 0:16:18,000
never again to buy chicken or shrimp or fruit

272
0:16:18.745,000 --> 0:16:2,000
raised with routine antibiotic use,

273
0:16:21.629,000 --> 0:16:23,000
and if we did those things,

274
0:16:24.323,000 --> 0:16:28,000
we could slow down the arrival of the post-antibiotic world.

275
0:16:29.547,000 --> 0:16:33,000
But we have to do it soon.

276
0:16:33.68,000 --> 0:16:37,000
Penicillin began the antibiotic era in 1943.

277
0:16:38.185,000 --> 0:16:43,000
In just 70 years, we walked ourselves up to the edge of disaster.

278
0:16:44.291,000 --> 0:16:46,000
We won't get 70 years

279
0:16:46.613,000 --> 0:16:49,000
to find our way back out again.

280
0:16:50.769,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Thank you very much.

281
0:16:52.789,000 --> 0:16:57,000
(Applause)

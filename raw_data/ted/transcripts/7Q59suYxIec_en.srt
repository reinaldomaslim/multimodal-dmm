1
0:00:13.047,000 --> 0:00:16,000
We love to engage on the issues of the day.

2
0:00:16.302,000 --> 0:00:17,000
We love it.

3
0:00:17.484,000 --> 0:00:18,000
We comment on the news,

4
0:00:18.966,000 --> 0:00:2,000
we post our views on social media,

5
0:00:21.333,000 --> 0:00:23,000
we march, we protest ...

6
0:00:24.095,000 --> 0:00:27,000
But who among us is working on solutions,

7
0:00:27.874,000 --> 0:00:29,000
big solutions to big issues,

8
0:00:30.358,000 --> 0:00:31,000
like gun violence,

9
0:00:32.294,000 --> 0:00:33,000
mistreatment of workers,

10
0:00:34.053,000 --> 0:00:35,000
flood, famine, drought?

11
0:00:35.786,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Who is on it?

12
0:00:38.331,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Boom!

13
0:00:40.781,000 --> 0:00:41,000
These guys.

14
0:00:42.105,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:44.142,000 --> 0:00:46,000
What? You were hoping for Peter Parker?

16
0:00:46.862,000 --> 0:00:47,000
The Avengers?

17
0:00:48.314,000 --> 0:00:5,000
You don't expect this beacon of diversity,

18
0:00:51.086,000 --> 0:00:57,000
these good-looking, nicely dressed dudes just oozing charisma to solve the issues?

19
0:00:57.425,000 --> 0:01:,000
Well good, because they're actually not going to solve the issues.

20
0:01:00.6,000 --> 0:01:03,000
But before you dismiss them,

21
0:01:03.968,000 --> 0:01:05,000
let me say, they're not going to solve the issues,

22
0:01:06.392,000 --> 0:01:08,000
but they will show us how.

23
0:01:09.1,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So who are they?

24
0:01:10.866,000 --> 0:01:11,000
They're activist investors:

25
0:01:12.95,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Carl Icahn, Dan Loeb, Paul Singer, Barry Rosenstein.

26
0:01:18.891,000 --> 0:01:21,000
These are the modern-day OGs of Wall Street.

27
0:01:22.498,000 --> 0:01:23,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:23.575,000 --> 0:01:24,000
These are scary dudes.

29
0:01:24.761,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I don't mean Green Goblin scary.

30
0:01:26.44,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I mean real scary.

31
0:01:29.169,000 --> 0:01:33,000
The fear they strike in the hearts of a company's CEO and board

32
0:01:33.838,000 --> 0:01:34,000
when they enter its stock

33
0:01:35.721,000 --> 0:01:39,000
is the same fear you feel when you hear a bear outside your tent,

34
0:01:40.599,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and it's dark,

35
0:01:41.866,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and you're sitting there with a mouthful of Doritos --

36
0:01:44.422,000 --> 0:01:45,000
(Laughter)

37
0:01:45.507,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that just moments ago,

38
0:01:46.685,000 --> 0:01:48,000
you had snuck out of the tent to pull down from the bear hang,

39
0:01:49.677,000 --> 0:01:5,000
because you had the munchies.

40
0:01:51.099,000 --> 0:01:52,000
That fear.

41
0:01:53.245,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And in that moment, you are praying,

42
0:01:54.987,000 --> 0:01:57,000
"Oh Lord, please let this bear be passing through."

43
0:01:58.397,000 --> 0:02:,000
That bear is not passing through!

44
0:02:01.253,000 --> 0:02:03,000
That bear made a detour for you.

45
0:02:04.041,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Bears like Doritos!

46
0:02:06.066,000 --> 0:02:07,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:07.222,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Activists like money.

48
0:02:09.55,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Some activists also like Doritos, but they definitely want money.

49
0:02:16.313,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And the way they make money, the way they create value,

50
0:02:20.671,000 --> 0:02:22,000
is by getting management of corporations

51
0:02:23.293,000 --> 0:02:24,000
to make changes.

52
0:02:26.005,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Now, some will argue that the changes they create,

53
0:02:29.151,000 --> 0:02:31,000
the value they create, is too short-term in nature.

54
0:02:32.349,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And others will say the tactics they use are egregious.

55
0:02:36.13,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I agree.

56
0:02:37.568,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Long, drawn-out lawsuits,

57
0:02:39.304,000 --> 0:02:4,000
public smear campaigns --

58
0:02:40.812,000 --> 0:02:42,000
there is no need for that.

59
0:02:43.741,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But I must say, there's a small handful of activists,

60
0:02:46.918,000 --> 0:02:47,000
very small,

61
0:02:48.238,000 --> 0:02:5,000
that go to great lengths to be constructive and collaborative.

62
0:02:51.198,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And overall, we have to give credit where credit is due.

63
0:02:53.944,000 --> 0:02:56,000
As a group, they have managed to catalyze large-scale change

64
0:02:57.814,000 --> 0:02:58,000
in large corporations,

65
0:02:59.059,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and that's no small feat.

66
0:03:02.4,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Now, imagine a world

67
0:03:04.888,000 --> 0:03:07,000
where all investors were working with management to make change,

68
0:03:07.972,000 --> 0:03:08,000
not just to make more money,

69
0:03:10.981,000 --> 0:03:12,000
but to improve the environment and society.

70
0:03:13.948,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Imagine what a greener and better world this would be.

71
0:03:18.636,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Now, why? Why would an investor bother?

72
0:03:20.612,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And at first, blush I'm with you: Why would an investor care?

73
0:03:23.56,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Because if doing well on ESG issues --

74
0:03:25.927,000 --> 0:03:27,000
environmental, social and governance issues --

75
0:03:28.736,000 --> 0:03:3,000
was just an act of good corporate citizenship,

76
0:03:32.441,000 --> 0:03:33,000
then I agree, investors would not care.

77
0:03:34.374,000 --> 0:03:35,000
But the good news,

78
0:03:35.841,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and perhaps the saving grace for our collective futures,

79
0:03:39.043,000 --> 0:03:42,000
is that it's so much more than an act of good corporate citizenship.

80
0:03:43.376,000 --> 0:03:44,000
It's good business.

81
0:03:45.383,000 --> 0:03:47,000
There's now enough evidence that shows a clear correlation

82
0:03:48.167,000 --> 0:03:51,000
between ESG performance and financial performance.

83
0:03:51.397,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Companies that do good for the environment and society

84
0:03:54.628,000 --> 0:03:55,000
also do well financially.

85
0:03:57.362,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And some of the best companies are catching on.

86
0:03:59.831,000 --> 0:04:,000
Like Adidas:

87
0:04:01.186,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Adidas is cleaning up the ocean and making money in the process.

88
0:04:05.132,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Adidas teamed up with an organization called Parley for the Oceans.

89
0:04:09.356,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Parley goes out and collects plastic waste from the ocean.

90
0:04:12.917,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Adidas uses the plastic waste to make shoes.

91
0:04:15.409,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Shoes made with plastic from the ocean:

92
0:04:18.04,000 --> 0:04:2,000
good for the environment and good for business.

93
0:04:21.21,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Because if you know that rapidly growing consumer segment known as hipsters --

94
0:04:25.721,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and I know you know hipsters --

95
0:04:27.387,000 --> 0:04:3,000
then you know that a hipster faced with the choice between a no-name shoe

96
0:04:31.024,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and an Adidas made with plastic from the ocean

97
0:04:33.334,000 --> 0:04:36,000
will pick the Adidas every day of the week and twice on Sunday,

98
0:04:37.332,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and then walk around like it's no big deal

99
0:04:39.769,000 --> 0:04:42,000
but look for every opportunity to talk about them.

100
0:04:43.605,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Like, in an Uber Pool.

101
0:04:45.439,000 --> 0:04:46,000
(Laughter)

102
0:04:46.509,000 --> 0:04:48,000
"Hey, I noticed you looking at my feet."

103
0:04:49.144,000 --> 0:04:53,000
"What? Dude, no, I'm just making slides. I'm a consultant. I make slides.

104
0:04:53.334,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I'm making PowerPoint slides, I'm not looking --"

105
0:04:55.708,000 --> 0:04:56,000
"No, it's fine.

106
0:04:56.9,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I get why you'd be looking.

107
0:04:58.327,000 --> 0:05:,000
The plastic on my shoe must be bothering you.

108
0:05:00.455,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Well, let me talk about it for the rest of this ride.

109
0:05:03.007,000 --> 0:05:05,000
You see, the plastic on my shoe is from the ocean,

110
0:05:05.441,000 --> 0:05:07,000
on my feet, not in your fish,

111
0:05:07.616,000 --> 0:05:09,000
being walked on, not being munched on.

112
0:05:09.796,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Happy feet. Happy fish. Happy ocean.

113
0:05:12.343,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Doing my part. I got eco-shoes. I got eco-shoes.

114
0:05:14.71,000 --> 0:05:15,000
You need some eco-shoes?"

115
0:05:16.563,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And so on, just cornering him. We've all been there.

116
0:05:19.051,000 --> 0:05:21,000
"Hey, pass me your cell phone. I'll give you a discount code.

117
0:05:21.949,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Let me give you a discount code."

118
0:05:23.58,000 --> 0:05:24,000
We've all been --

119
0:05:24.755,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Folks, I have jumped out of moving Uber Pools.

120
0:05:26.927,000 --> 0:05:27,000
(Laughter)

121
0:05:28.056,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Just, moving, highway, I'm out. I'm out.

122
0:05:32.567,000 --> 0:05:35,000
But we've got to forgive the hipsters, we need to love the hipsters.

123
0:05:35.878,000 --> 0:05:37,000
We need hipsters, and we need companies like Adidas,

124
0:05:38.391,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and what we need most is for investors to convince other companies

125
0:05:41.915,000 --> 0:05:42,000
to behave like Adidas.

126
0:05:43.551,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And herein lies the challenge.

127
0:05:45.969,000 --> 0:05:48,000
There's a growing group of investors, call them "conscious investors."

128
0:05:49.887,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Conscious investors care about ESG issues.

129
0:05:53.791,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And they talk a lot about engaging management on ESG issues.

130
0:05:58.002,000 --> 0:06:,000
But they don't actually get management to make changes

131
0:06:00.671,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that will improve the environment and society.

132
0:06:04.078,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And this is where conscious investors can take a page from the playbook

133
0:06:07.678,000 --> 0:06:08,000
of the activist investors,

134
0:06:09.633,000 --> 0:06:12,000
because the activist investors have no issues getting management to make changes.

135
0:06:13.574,000 --> 0:06:15,000
They have no issues turning up the heat.

136
0:06:16.124,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Take Paul Singer.

137
0:06:17.346,000 --> 0:06:19,000
He's an old-school Wall Street OG,

138
0:06:19.713,000 --> 0:06:22,000
now in his 70s, loves Doritos, loves making money.

139
0:06:24.474,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Argentina owed Paul 600 million dollars

140
0:06:27.905,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and would not pay.

141
0:06:30.386,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Big mistake.

142
0:06:31.576,000 --> 0:06:34,000
You can't take money from an OG and not pay it back.

143
0:06:35.425,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Paul went to war with Argentina.

144
0:06:37.896,000 --> 0:06:39,000
I am not inventing.

145
0:06:40.014,000 --> 0:06:41,000
This is big. This was huge.

146
0:06:41.607,000 --> 0:06:43,000
This was bigger than Tyson vs Holyfield,

147
0:06:44.27,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Ali vs Foreman.

148
0:06:45.661,000 --> 0:06:47,000
This was man vs country.

149
0:06:47.726,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Paul Singer started going around the world trying to seize up Argentinian assets.

150
0:06:52.497,000 --> 0:06:56,000
At one point, he tried to seize an Argentinian navy vessel

151
0:06:57.186,000 --> 0:06:58,000
off the coast of Ghana.

152
0:06:58.464,000 --> 0:07:01,000
He tried to take over a 350-foot ship

153
0:07:01.924,000 --> 0:07:04,000
while big navy officers with big guns were on the ship.

154
0:07:05.866,000 --> 0:07:08,000
He got the police in Ghana to show up with a crane

155
0:07:09.424,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and threaten to board the ship,

156
0:07:10.927,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and it wasn't until the navy officers drew their weapons

157
0:07:15.463,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that they called off the operation.

158
0:07:17.77,000 --> 0:07:19,000
That's what I call turning up the heat.

159
0:07:20.382,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Now, you may say

160
0:07:22.479,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Paul lost the battle.

161
0:07:24.797,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And I'll say, Paul won the war,

162
0:07:26.392,000 --> 0:07:27,000
because Paul didn't get paid one time,

163
0:07:28.256,000 --> 0:07:31,000
he got paid 20 times his original investment.

164
0:07:32.831,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Then you have Barry Rosenstein.

165
0:07:34.377,000 --> 0:07:35,000
His fund, Jana Partners,

166
0:07:35.69,000 --> 0:07:37,000
started stealth-mode buying up stock in Whole Foods,

167
0:07:38.169,000 --> 0:07:4,000
at a time when Whole Foods was struggling.

168
0:07:40.596,000 --> 0:07:41,000
They got to eight percent, came out,

169
0:07:42.52,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and pushed Whole Foods to sell itself to Amazon,

170
0:07:45.3,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and not because Barry wanted same-day delivery of his organic Doritos.

171
0:07:49.373,000 --> 0:07:5,000
(Laughter)

172
0:07:50.998,000 --> 0:07:51,000
He wanted to make some money.

173
0:07:53.008,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Now, the CEO of Whole Foods, John Mackey, and the board

174
0:07:55.822,000 --> 0:07:59,000
did not want to sell themselves to Amazon,

175
0:08:00.054,000 --> 0:08:02,000
because that would be the prime example of selling out.

176
0:08:03.275,000 --> 0:08:05,000
But in the end, they caved.

177
0:08:05.879,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Why? Because Barry turned up the heat,

178
0:08:08.481,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and he made 300 million dollars in the process.

179
0:08:11.777,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And he did not leave a very nice impression on John.

180
0:08:15.605,000 --> 0:08:17,000
You're not going to see John and Barry just hugging it out

181
0:08:18.387,000 --> 0:08:19,000
at the Whole Foods café.

182
0:08:20.765,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Let's take a very different example now:

183
0:08:23.524,000 --> 0:08:25,000
the Chicago Teachers' Pension Fund,

184
0:08:26.829,000 --> 0:08:28,000
a $10 billion conscious investor.

185
0:08:29.915,000 --> 0:08:31,000
They recently came out hard against private prisons in the US,

186
0:08:32.87,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and good for them.

187
0:08:34.259,000 --> 0:08:37,000
As a new parent, I tell you, I am troubled by devastating images

188
0:08:37.348,000 --> 0:08:4,000
of young children being ripped out of the arms of their parents

189
0:08:40.877,000 --> 0:08:41,000
at the US border

190
0:08:42.085,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and being placed in private detention facilities that did too little

191
0:08:45.595,000 --> 0:08:48,000
to help the kids maintain contact with their parents.

192
0:08:49.6,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So what did the Chicago teachers do?

193
0:08:52.459,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Did they get management to make changes?

194
0:08:55.279,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Did they turn up the heat?

195
0:08:56.568,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Did they look management in the eye and say,

196
0:08:58.711,000 --> 0:08:59,000
"This is no way to run a business.

197
0:09:01.044,000 --> 0:09:03,000
There's a different way to do things. Let me show you"?

198
0:09:03.693,000 --> 0:09:06,000
No. They just sold their stock.

199
0:09:07.972,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Selling did nothing.

200
0:09:09.452,000 --> 0:09:11,000
It's not like management woke up the next day

201
0:09:11.853,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and had an epiphany and said,

202
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
"Gosh, the teachers sold their stock. We'd better be nice to the kids."

203
0:09:16.85,000 --> 0:09:17,000
No. That didn't happen.

204
0:09:18.971,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And despite a decade of several high-profile divestitures

205
0:09:22.976,000 --> 0:09:23,000
in private prison stock in the US,

206
0:09:24.784,000 --> 0:09:25,000
the stock has continued to climb.

207
0:09:26.513,000 --> 0:09:3,000
The stock over that same period has outperformed the market.

208
0:09:31.941,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And the biggest issue is,

209
0:09:33.221,000 --> 0:09:36,000
we went from a set of conscious investors owning the stock

210
0:09:36.842,000 --> 0:09:4,000
to it potentially being owned by investors who don't care about these issues

211
0:09:41.632,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and don't care what you think about these issues.

212
0:09:44.423,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And this is my issue with conscious investors.

213
0:09:47.018,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Their MO is to divest

214
0:09:49.175,000 --> 0:09:51,000
or divert money into ESG-focused funds.

215
0:09:52.887,000 --> 0:09:55,000
You can't divest your way to a greener world.

216
0:09:57.261,000 --> 0:09:59,000
You can divest your way to a greener portfolio,

217
0:09:59.603,000 --> 0:10:,000
not to a greener world.

218
0:10:02.722,000 --> 0:10:03,000
So what's it going to take?

219
0:10:04.079,000 --> 0:10:06,000
What's it going to take to flip the script,

220
0:10:06.154,000 --> 0:10:08,000
to get conscious investors to go from divesting to engaging,

221
0:10:09.03,000 --> 0:10:12,000
to go from talking about engaging to actually working with management

222
0:10:12.532,000 --> 0:10:16,000
to make changes that will improve their ESG performance?

223
0:10:17.478,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Because there's a lot suggesting they should and they could.

224
0:10:20.4,000 --> 0:10:23,000
They should, given the clear correlation between ESG performance

225
0:10:23.497,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and financial performance.

226
0:10:25.877,000 --> 0:10:27,000
They could because the activists have shown us they could.

227
0:10:29.529,000 --> 0:10:31,000
A shareholder can drive change in a company.

228
0:10:31.717,000 --> 0:10:34,000
The difference is, Paul and Barry do what they do to make money.

229
0:10:36.433,000 --> 0:10:41,000
The conscious investors would do it to improve society and the environment

230
0:10:41.556,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and make money in the process

231
0:10:43.333,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and do it a little more collaboratively and constructively.

232
0:10:47.245,000 --> 0:10:5,000
And they have the backing of the some of the largest investors.

233
0:10:50.274,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Vanguard and BlackRock -- together, they manage trillions.

234
0:10:53.287,000 --> 0:10:56,000
They've been increasingly vocal about the importance of ESG.

235
0:10:57.542,000 --> 0:11:,000
The CEO of BlackRock has been increasingly vocal in his annual letters

236
0:11:01.55,000 --> 0:11:02,000
about this issue.

237
0:11:03.512,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Even Jana Partners, the same OGs that John called "greedy bastards,"

238
0:11:08.306,000 --> 0:11:1,000
recently co-wrote an open letter to the board of Apple,

239
0:11:10.995,000 --> 0:11:13,000
saying, "Hey, your smartphones are addictive for children.

240
0:11:14.969,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Fix it."

241
0:11:16.813,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Apple is working on it.

242
0:11:19.983,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So what it's going to take is some pressure.

243
0:11:22.744,000 --> 0:11:24,000
It's going to take some pressure on conscious investors

244
0:11:25.373,000 --> 0:11:27,000
to, in turn, put some pressure on management

245
0:11:28.224,000 --> 0:11:32,000
to make changes that will improve the environment and society.

246
0:11:33.52,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And where do they start?

247
0:11:34.7,000 --> 0:11:36,000
They start by picking an issue that matters to them

248
0:11:37.535,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and taking a stand on it.

249
0:11:39.376,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Take a stand on an issue that lines up with your purpose:

250
0:11:43.313,000 --> 0:11:45,000
water preservation, labor rights, diversity.

251
0:11:45.982,000 --> 0:11:47,000
As long as it lines up with your purpose, you are golden.

252
0:11:49.393,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And the biggest unlock?

253
0:11:51.052,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Get the senior-most investment professionals focused on this.

254
0:11:56.59,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Today, when an activist shows up to a campaign,

255
0:11:58.892,000 --> 0:12:01,000
it's the senior investment professional talking to the CEO and the board

256
0:12:02.375,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and everyone hears about it.

257
0:12:03.849,000 --> 0:12:06,000
When a conscious investor shows up to talk about an ESG issue,

258
0:12:07.42,000 --> 0:12:09,000
it's some junior person in the risk department

259
0:12:09.885,000 --> 0:12:12,000
talking to some junior person in the investor relations department,

260
0:12:13.079,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and nobody hears about it, and that needs to change.

261
0:12:15.657,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And it's not some massive leap.

262
0:12:17.314,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Today, when a company underperforms financially,

263
0:12:19.709,000 --> 0:12:2,000
who is on the hook?

264
0:12:20.901,000 --> 0:12:21,000
The senior investment professional.

265
0:12:22.595,000 --> 0:12:23,000
So what do they do?

266
0:12:23.777,000 --> 0:12:25,000
They drop everything and work with management,

267
0:12:26.006,000 --> 0:12:27,000
collaboratively and constructively,

268
0:12:27.742,000 --> 0:12:3,000
to make changes to improve the company's financial performance.

269
0:12:31.27,000 --> 0:12:34,000
The same should be true when the company underperforms on ESG issues.

270
0:12:34.959,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And yes, that requires standardization on how we measure ESG,

271
0:12:38.721,000 --> 0:12:39,000
but we're on it.

272
0:12:41.201,000 --> 0:12:42,000
So folks, here's my call to action:

273
0:12:43.766,000 --> 0:12:44,000
it's your money.

274
0:12:45.362,000 --> 0:12:46,000
It's your pension fund,

275
0:12:46.895,000 --> 0:12:47,000
it's your sovereign wealth fund.

276
0:12:48.748,000 --> 0:12:49,000
it's your university's endowment.

277
0:12:50.419,000 --> 0:12:51,000
It's your money.

278
0:12:51.795,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And it's your right to have your money managed in line with your values.

279
0:12:55.91,000 --> 0:12:56,000
So use your voice

280
0:12:57.803,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and trust that it matters.

281
0:12:59.902,000 --> 0:13:02,000
It was your voice that got the investors more conscious in the first place.

282
0:13:03.759,000 --> 0:13:04,000
You protested for years,

283
0:13:05.708,000 --> 0:13:07,000
because you didn't feel right about your money being invested

284
0:13:08.658,000 --> 0:13:1,000
in companies whose values don't line up with yours.

285
0:13:11.466,000 --> 0:13:12,000
It's time to use that voice again.

286
0:13:13.373,000 --> 0:13:15,000
But this time, instead of pushing them to divest,

287
0:13:15.715,000 --> 0:13:18,000
push them to engage, truly engage, truly work with management

288
0:13:19.273,000 --> 0:13:22,000
to make changes that will improve their ESG performance.

289
0:13:24.449,000 --> 0:13:26,000
You made them aware of the issues.

290
0:13:26.548,000 --> 0:13:27,000
You can now focus them on fixing them.

291
0:13:29.074,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Thank you.

292
0:13:30.661,000 --> 0:13:32,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.917,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I want to talk today about how reading can change our lives

2
0:00:18.417,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and about the limits of that change.

3
0:00:21.75,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I want to talk to you about how reading can give us a shareable world

4
0:00:26.042,000 --> 0:00:28,000
of powerful human connection.

5
0:00:29.833,000 --> 0:00:32,000
But also about how that connection is always partial.

6
0:00:33.417,000 --> 0:00:38,000
How reading is ultimately a lonely, idiosyncratic undertaking.

7
0:00:39.625,000 --> 0:00:41,000
The writer who changed my life

8
0:00:42.5,000 --> 0:00:46,000
was the great African American novelist James Baldwin.

9
0:00:46.958,000 --> 0:00:49,000
When I was growing up in Western Michigan in the 1980s,

10
0:00:50.25,000 --> 0:00:53,000
there weren't many Asian American writers interested in social change.

11
0:00:55.292,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And so I think I turned to James Baldwin

12
0:00:58.542,000 --> 0:01:02,000
as a way to fill this void, as a way to feel racially conscious.

13
0:01:03.958,000 --> 0:01:06,000
But perhaps because I knew I wasn't myself African American,

14
0:01:07.958,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I also felt challenged and indicted by his words.

15
0:01:12.5,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Especially these words:

16
0:01:15.458,000 --> 0:01:18,000
"There are liberals who have all the proper attitudes,

17
0:01:19.083,000 --> 0:01:2,000
but no real convictions.

18
0:01:22.083,000 --> 0:01:25,000
When the chips are down and you somehow expect them to deliver,

19
0:01:26.042,000 --> 0:01:28,000
they are somehow not there."

20
0:01:28.542,000 --> 0:01:3,000
They are somehow not there.

21
0:01:31.375,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I took those words very literally.

22
0:01:33.75,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Where should I put myself?

23
0:01:36.5,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I went to the Mississippi Delta,

24
0:01:38.542,000 --> 0:01:41,000
one of the poorest regions in the United States.

25
0:01:41.708,000 --> 0:01:43,000
This is a place shaped by a powerful history.

26
0:01:44.625,000 --> 0:01:49,000
In the 1960s, African Americans risked their lives to fight for education,

27
0:01:49.792,000 --> 0:01:5,000
to fight for the right to vote.

28
0:01:52.625,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I wanted to be a part of that change,

29
0:01:55.083,000 --> 0:01:58,000
to help young teenagers graduate and go to college.

30
0:02:00.25,000 --> 0:02:02,000
When I got to the Mississippi Delta,

31
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:05,000
it was a place that was still poor,

32
0:02:05.458,000 --> 0:02:06,000
still segregated,

33
0:02:07.208,000 --> 0:02:09,000
still dramatically in need of change.

34
0:02:10.958,000 --> 0:02:13,000
My school, where I was placed,

35
0:02:14.417,000 --> 0:02:18,000
had no library, no guidance counselor,

36
0:02:18.75,000 --> 0:02:2,000
but it did have a police officer.

37
0:02:21.75,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Half the teachers were substitutes

38
0:02:24.333,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and when students got into fights,

39
0:02:26.333,000 --> 0:02:29,000
the school would send them to the local county jail.

40
0:02:32.25,000 --> 0:02:34,000
This is the school where I met Patrick.

41
0:02:35.25,000 --> 0:02:39,000
He was 15 and held back twice, he was in the eighth grade.

42
0:02:40.208,000 --> 0:02:42,000
He was quiet, introspective,

43
0:02:42.708,000 --> 0:02:44,000
like he was always in deep thought.

44
0:02:45.542,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And he hated seeing other people fight.

45
0:02:49.5,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I saw him once jump between two girls when they got into a fight

46
0:02:53.333,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and he got himself knocked to the ground.

47
0:02:57.375,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Patrick had just one problem.

48
0:02:59.917,000 --> 0:03:,000
He wouldn't come to school.

49
0:03:03.249,000 --> 0:03:05,000
He said that sometimes school was just too depressing

50
0:03:05.75,000 --> 0:03:08,000
because people were always fighting and teachers were quitting.

51
0:03:10.042,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And also, his mother worked two jobs and was just too tired to make him come.

52
0:03:16.417,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So I made it my job to get him to come to school.

53
0:03:19.208,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And because I was crazy and 22 and zealously optimistic,

54
0:03:23.292,000 --> 0:03:25,000
my strategy was just to show up at his house

55
0:03:25.458,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and say, "Hey, why don't you come to school?"

56
0:03:28.542,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And this strategy actually worked,

57
0:03:30.208,000 --> 0:03:32,000
he started to come to school every day.

58
0:03:32.667,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And he started to flourish in my class.

59
0:03:35.083,000 --> 0:03:37,000
He was writing poetry, he was reading books.

60
0:03:38.917,000 --> 0:03:4,000
He was coming to school every day.

61
0:03:43.042,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Around the same time

62
0:03:44.542,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that I had figured out how to connect to Patrick,

63
0:03:47.25,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I got into law school at Harvard.

64
0:03:51.583,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I once again faced this question, where should I put myself,

65
0:03:54.958,000 --> 0:03:55,000
where do I put my body?

66
0:03:57.458,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And I thought to myself

67
0:04:00.125,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that the Mississippi Delta was a place where people with money,

68
0:04:03.667,000 --> 0:04:04,000
people with opportunity,

69
0:04:05.583,000 --> 0:04:06,000
those people leave.

70
0:04:07.875,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And the people who stay behind

71
0:04:09.333,000 --> 0:04:11,000
are the people who don't have the chance to leave.

72
0:04:12.833,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I didn't want to be a person who left.

73
0:04:15.125,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I wanted to be a person who stayed.

74
0:04:18.333,000 --> 0:04:2,000
On the other hand, I was lonely and tired.

75
0:04:21.292,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And so I convinced myself that I could do more change

76
0:04:26.125,000 --> 0:04:29,000
on a larger scale if I had a prestigious law degree.

77
0:04:31.541,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So I left.

78
0:04:34.75,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Three years later,

79
0:04:36.375,000 --> 0:04:38,000
when I was about to graduate from law school,

80
0:04:38.792,000 --> 0:04:39,000
my friend called me

81
0:04:40.542,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and told me that Patrick had got into a fight and killed someone.

82
0:04:47.333,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I was devastated.

83
0:04:49.417,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Part of me didn't believe it,

84
0:04:51.875,000 --> 0:04:53,000
but part of me also knew that it was true.

85
0:04:55.583,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I flew down to see Patrick.

86
0:04:58.75,000 --> 0:05:,000
I visited him in jail.

87
0:05:02.542,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And he told me that it was true.

88
0:05:06.208,000 --> 0:05:08,000
That he had killed someone.

89
0:05:08.625,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And he didn't want to talk more about it.

90
0:05:11.833,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I asked him what had happened with school

91
0:05:13.875,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and he said that he had dropped out the year after I left.

92
0:05:18.042,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And then he wanted to tell me something else.

93
0:05:20.708,000 --> 0:05:23,000
He looked down and he said that he had had a baby daughter

94
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:25,000
who was just born.

95
0:05:25.792,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And he felt like he had let her down.

96
0:05:30.625,000 --> 0:05:33,000
That was it, our conversation was rushed and awkward.

97
0:05:35.417,000 --> 0:05:4,000
When I stepped outside the jail, a voice inside me said,

98
0:05:40.5,000 --> 0:05:41,000
"Come back.

99
0:05:41.792,000 --> 0:05:44,000
If you don't come back now, you'll never come back."

100
0:05:48.292,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So I graduated from law school and I went back.

101
0:05:52.833,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I went back to see Patrick,

102
0:05:54.542,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I went back to see if I could help him with his legal case.

103
0:05:58.917,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And this time, when I saw him a second time,

104
0:06:02.292,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I thought I had this great idea, I said,

105
0:06:04.583,000 --> 0:06:07,000
"Hey, Patrick, why don't you write a letter to your daughter,

106
0:06:08.208,000 --> 0:06:11,000
so that you can keep her on your mind?"

107
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And I handed him a pen and a piece of paper,

108
0:06:15.708,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and he started to write.

109
0:06:18.542,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But when I saw the paper that he handed back to me,

110
0:06:21.375,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I was shocked.

111
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I didn't recognize his handwriting,

112
0:06:27.125,000 --> 0:06:29,000
he had made simple spelling mistakes.

113
0:06:31.167,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And I thought to myself that as a teacher,

114
0:06:33.875,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I knew that a student could dramatically improve

115
0:06:37.375,000 --> 0:06:4,000
in a very quick amount of time,

116
0:06:40.458,000 --> 0:06:43,000
but I never thought that a student could dramatically regress.

117
0:06:46.375,000 --> 0:06:47,000
What even pained me more,

118
0:06:48.292,000 --> 0:06:51,000
was seeing what he had written to his daughter.

119
0:06:51.5,000 --> 0:06:52,000
He had written,

120
0:06:52.917,000 --> 0:06:56,000
"I'm sorry for my mistakes, I'm sorry for not being there for you."

121
0:06:58.458,000 --> 0:07:,000
And this was all he felt he had to say to her.

122
0:07:02.25,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And I asked myself how can I convince him that he has more to say,

123
0:07:06.583,000 --> 0:07:09,000
parts of himself that he doesn't need to apologize for.

124
0:07:10.958,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I wanted him to feel

125
0:07:12.25,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that he had something worthwhile to share with his daughter.

126
0:07:17.917,000 --> 0:07:2,000
For every day the next seven months,

127
0:07:21.125,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I visited him and brought books.

128
0:07:23.833,000 --> 0:07:26,000
My tote bag became a little library.

129
0:07:27.708,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I brought James Baldwin,

130
0:07:29.792,000 --> 0:07:33,000
I brought Walt Whitman, C.S. Lewis.

131
0:07:34.708,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I brought guidebooks to trees, to birds,

132
0:07:39.542,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and what would become his favorite book, the dictionary.

133
0:07:43.667,000 --> 0:07:44,000
On some days,

134
0:07:45.375,000 --> 0:07:48,000
we would sit for hours in silence, both of us reading.

135
0:07:50.083,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And on other days,

136
0:07:51.958,000 --> 0:07:54,000
we would read together, we would read poetry.

137
0:07:55.5,000 --> 0:07:58,000
We started by reading haikus, hundreds of haikus,

138
0:07:59.417,000 --> 0:08:01,000
a deceptively simple masterpiece.

139
0:08:02.333,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And I would ask him, "Share with me your favorite haikus."

140
0:08:05.167,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And some of them are quite funny.

141
0:08:08.25,000 --> 0:08:09,000
So there's this by Issa:

142
0:08:10.125,000 --> 0:08:13,000
"Don't worry, spiders, I keep house casually."

143
0:08:14.75,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And this: "Napped half the day, no one punished me!"

144
0:08:20.667,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And this gorgeous one, which is about the first day of snow falling,

145
0:08:25.125,000 --> 0:08:29,000
"Deer licking first frost from each other's coats."

146
0:08:31.25,000 --> 0:08:34,000
There's something mysterious and gorgeous

147
0:08:34.292,000 --> 0:08:36,000
just about the way a poem looks.

148
0:08:36.958,000 --> 0:08:4,000
The empty space is as important as the words themselves.

149
0:08:43.375,000 --> 0:08:45,000
We read this poem by W.S. Merwin,

150
0:08:45.917,000 --> 0:08:49,000
which he wrote after he saw his wife working in the garden

151
0:08:50.167,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and realized that they would spend the rest of their lives together.

152
0:08:55.167,000 --> 0:08:57,000
"Let me imagine that we will come again

153
0:08:57.542,000 --> 0:09:,000
when we want to and it will be spring

154
0:09:00.958,000 --> 0:09:03,000
We will be no older than we ever were

155
0:09:04.167,000 --> 0:09:07,000
The worn griefs will have eased like the early cloud

156
0:09:08.125,000 --> 0:09:11,000
through which morning slowly comes to itself"

157
0:09:11.917,000 --> 0:09:14,000
I asked Patrick what his favorite line was, and he said,

158
0:09:15.333,000 --> 0:09:18,000
"We will be no older than we ever were."

159
0:09:20.375,000 --> 0:09:24,000
He said it reminded him of a place where time just stops,

160
0:09:24.833,000 --> 0:09:26,000
where time doesn't matter anymore.

161
0:09:27.792,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And I asked him if he had a place like that,

162
0:09:29.875,000 --> 0:09:31,000
where time lasts forever.

163
0:09:32.292,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And he said, "My mother."

164
0:09:35.875,000 --> 0:09:39,000
When you read a poem alongside someone else,

165
0:09:40.208,000 --> 0:09:41,000
the poem changes in meaning.

166
0:09:43.333,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Because it becomes personal to that person, becomes personal to you.

167
0:09:49.5,000 --> 0:09:51,000
We then read books, we read so many books,

168
0:09:52.208,000 --> 0:09:55,000
we read the memoir of Frederick Douglass,

169
0:09:55.375,000 --> 0:09:58,000
an American slave who taught himself to read and write

170
0:09:59,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and who escaped to freedom because of his literacy.

171
0:10:03.875,000 --> 0:10:05,000
I had grown up thinking of Frederick Douglass as a hero

172
0:10:06.542,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and I thought of this story as one of uplift and hope.

173
0:10:10.917,000 --> 0:10:12,000
But this book put Patrick in a kind of panic.

174
0:10:14.875,000 --> 0:10:19,000
He fixated on a story Douglass told of how, over Christmas,

175
0:10:19.958,000 --> 0:10:22,000
masters give slaves gin

176
0:10:23.083,000 --> 0:10:26,000
as a way to prove to them that they can't handle freedom.

177
0:10:26.583,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Because slaves would be stumbling on the fields.

178
0:10:31.5,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Patrick said he related to this.

179
0:10:34.333,000 --> 0:10:37,000
He said that there are people in jail who, like slaves,

180
0:10:37.833,000 --> 0:10:39,000
don't want to think about their condition,

181
0:10:40.083,000 --> 0:10:41,000
because it's too painful.

182
0:10:41.917,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Too painful to think about the past,

183
0:10:44.125,000 --> 0:10:47,000
too painful to think about how far we have to go.

184
0:10:48.958,000 --> 0:10:5,000
His favorite line was this line:

185
0:10:51.875,000 --> 0:10:54,000
"Anything, no matter what, to get rid of thinking!

186
0:10:55.5,000 --> 0:11:,000
It was this everlasting thinking of my condition that tormented me."

187
0:11:01.958,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Patrick said that Douglass was brave to write, to keep thinking.

188
0:11:07.083,000 --> 0:11:12,000
But Patrick would never know how much he seemed like Douglass to me.

189
0:11:12.667,000 --> 0:11:15,000
How he kept reading, even though it put him in a panic.

190
0:11:17.25,000 --> 0:11:2,000
He finished the book before I did,

191
0:11:20.333,000 --> 0:11:23,000
reading it in a concrete stairway with no light.

192
0:11:25.583,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And then we went on to read one of my favorite books,

193
0:11:28.333,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Marilynne Robinson's "Gilead,"

194
0:11:30.542,000 --> 0:11:34,000
which is an extended letter from a father to his son.

195
0:11:34.708,000 --> 0:11:36,000
He loved this line:

196
0:11:37.083,000 --> 0:11:39,000
"I'm writing this in part to tell you

197
0:11:39.292,000 --> 0:11:42,000
that if you ever wonder what you've done in your life ...

198
0:11:42.625,000 --> 0:11:44,000
you have been God's grace to me,

199
0:11:44.667,000 --> 0:11:47,000
a miracle, something more than a miracle."

200
0:11:49.375,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Something about this language, its love, its longing, its voice,

201
0:11:55.042,000 --> 0:11:57,000
rekindled Patrick's desire to write.

202
0:11:58.292,000 --> 0:12:01,000
And he would fill notebooks upon notebooks

203
0:12:01.417,000 --> 0:12:04,000
with letters to his daughter.

204
0:12:04.75,000 --> 0:12:06,000
In these beautiful, intricate letters,

205
0:12:07.708,000 --> 0:12:12,000
he would imagine him and his daughter going canoeing down the Mississippi river.

206
0:12:13.708,000 --> 0:12:15,000
He would imagine them finding a mountain stream

207
0:12:16.542,000 --> 0:12:18,000
with perfectly clear water.

208
0:12:20.042,000 --> 0:12:22,000
As I watched Patrick write,

209
0:12:23.25,000 --> 0:12:25,000
I thought to myself,

210
0:12:25.417,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and I now ask all of you,

211
0:12:27.5,000 --> 0:12:32,000
how many of you have written a letter to somebody you feel you have let down?

212
0:12:34.042,000 --> 0:12:39,000
It is just much easier to put those people out of your mind.

213
0:12:40.083,000 --> 0:12:44,000
But Patrick showed up every day, facing his daughter,

214
0:12:44.75,000 --> 0:12:46,000
holding himself accountable to her,

215
0:12:47.708,000 --> 0:12:5,000
word by word with intense concentration.

216
0:12:54.417,000 --> 0:12:56,000
I wanted in my own life

217
0:12:58.042,000 --> 0:13:01,000
to put myself at risk in that way.

218
0:13:01.125,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Because that risk reveals the strength of one's heart.

219
0:13:08.625,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Let me take a step back and just ask an uncomfortable question.

220
0:13:12.708,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Who am I to tell this story, as in this Patrick story?

221
0:13:18.042,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Patrick's the one who lived with this pain

222
0:13:21.042,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and I have never been hungry a day in my life.

223
0:13:27.25,000 --> 0:13:28,000
I thought about this question a lot,

224
0:13:29.042,000 --> 0:13:32,000
but what I want to say is that this story is not just about Patrick.

225
0:13:32.792,000 --> 0:13:33,000
It's about us,

226
0:13:34.333,000 --> 0:13:36,000
it's about the inequality between us.

227
0:13:37.667,000 --> 0:13:38,000
The world of plenty

228
0:13:40.375,000 --> 0:13:43,000
that Patrick and his parents and his grandparents

229
0:13:44.042,000 --> 0:13:45,000
have been shut out of.

230
0:13:45.875,000 --> 0:13:48,000
In this story, I represent that world of plenty.

231
0:13:49.792,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And in telling this story, I didn't want to hide myself.

232
0:13:53.625,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Hide the power that I do have.

233
0:13:57.333,000 --> 0:14:,000
In telling this story, I wanted to expose that power

234
0:14:00.917,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and then to ask,

235
0:14:03.333,000 --> 0:14:05,000
how do we diminish the distance between us?

236
0:14:08.25,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Reading is one way to close that distance.

237
0:14:11.875,000 --> 0:14:15,000
It gives us a quiet universe that we can share together,

238
0:14:16.333,000 --> 0:14:18,000
that we can share in equally.

239
0:14:20.5,000 --> 0:14:23,000
You're probably wondering now what happened to Patrick.

240
0:14:23.625,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Did reading save his life?

241
0:14:26.583,000 --> 0:14:28,000
It did and it didn't.

242
0:14:29.875,000 --> 0:14:31,000
When Patrick got out of prison,

243
0:14:32.792,000 --> 0:14:34,000
his journey was excruciating.

244
0:14:36.292,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Employers turned him away because of his record,

245
0:14:39.792,000 --> 0:14:42,000
his best friend, his mother, died at age 43

246
0:14:42.958,000 --> 0:14:44,000
from heart disease and diabetes.

247
0:14:45.458,000 --> 0:14:47,000
He's been homeless, he's been hungry.

248
0:14:50.25,000 --> 0:14:54,000
So people say a lot of things about reading that feel exaggerated to me.

249
0:14:55.792,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Being literate didn't stop him form being discriminated against.

250
0:14:59.792,000 --> 0:15:01,000
It didn't stop his mother from dying.

251
0:15:03.708,000 --> 0:15:05,000
So what can reading do?

252
0:15:07.375,000 --> 0:15:1,000
I have a few answers to end with today.

253
0:15:12.667,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Reading charged his inner life

254
0:15:17.083,000 --> 0:15:2,000
with mystery, with imagination,

255
0:15:20.167,000 --> 0:15:21,000
with beauty.

256
0:15:22.292,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Reading gave him images that gave him joy:

257
0:15:27.417,000 --> 0:15:32,000
mountain, ocean, deer, frost.

258
0:15:33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Words that taste of a free, natural world.

259
0:15:39.625,000 --> 0:15:42,000
Reading gave him a language for what he had lost.

260
0:15:43.167,000 --> 0:15:47,000
How precious are these lines from the poet Derek Walcott?

261
0:15:47.833,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Patrick memorized this poem.

262
0:15:50.083,000 --> 0:15:52,000
"Days that I have held,

263
0:15:52.208,000 --> 0:15:54,000
days that I have lost,

264
0:15:54.5,000 --> 0:15:57,000
days that outgrow, like daughters,

265
0:15:57.75,000 --> 0:15:58,000
my harboring arms."

266
0:16:00.667,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Reading taught him his own courage.

267
0:16:03.667,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Remember that he kept reading Frederick Douglass,

268
0:16:07,000 --> 0:16:09,000
even though it was painful.

269
0:16:09.167,000 --> 0:16:12,000
He kept being conscious, even though being conscious hurts.

270
0:16:14.208,000 --> 0:16:16,000
Reading is a form of thinking,

271
0:16:16.792,000 --> 0:16:2,000
that's why it's difficult to read because we have to think.

272
0:16:20.875,000 --> 0:16:24,000
And Patrick chose to think, rather than to not think.

273
0:16:28,000 --> 0:16:31,000
And last, reading gave him a language to speak to his daughter.

274
0:16:33.375,000 --> 0:16:36,000
Reading inspired him to want to write.

275
0:16:36.625,000 --> 0:16:4,000
The link between reading and writing is so powerful.

276
0:16:40.792,000 --> 0:16:42,000
When we begin to read,

277
0:16:42.875,000 --> 0:16:44,000
we begin to find the words.

278
0:16:45.958,000 --> 0:16:49,000
And he found the words to imagine the two of them together.

279
0:16:50.625,000 --> 0:16:51,000
He found the words

280
0:16:53.958,000 --> 0:16:55,000
to tell her how much he loved her.

281
0:16:58.042,000 --> 0:17:01,000
Reading also changed our relationship with each other.

282
0:17:02,000 --> 0:17:04,000
It gave us an occasion for intimacy,

283
0:17:04.083,000 --> 0:17:06,000
to see beyond our points of view.

284
0:17:07,000 --> 0:17:09,000
And reading took an unequal relationship

285
0:17:09.708,000 --> 0:17:11,000
and gave us a momentary equality.

286
0:17:14.125,000 --> 0:17:16,000
When you meet somebody as a reader,

287
0:17:17.083,000 --> 0:17:18,000
you meet him for the first time,

288
0:17:19.083,000 --> 0:17:2,000
newly, freshly.

289
0:17:21.875,000 --> 0:17:24,000
There is no way you can know what his favorite line will be.

290
0:17:26.458,000 --> 0:17:29,000
What memories and private griefs he has.

291
0:17:30.833,000 --> 0:17:34,000
And you face the ultimate privacy of his inner life.

292
0:17:35.666,000 --> 0:17:38,000
And then you start to wonder, "Well, what is my inner life made of?

293
0:17:39.125,000 --> 0:17:42,000
What do I have that's worthwhile to share with another?"

294
0:17:45,000 --> 0:17:46,000
I want to close

295
0:17:48.208,000 --> 0:17:52,000
on some of my favorite lines from Patrick's letters to his daughter.

296
0:17:53.333,000 --> 0:17:55,000
"The river is shadowy in some places

297
0:17:56.125,000 --> 0:17:59,000
but the light shines through the cracks of trees ...

298
0:17:59.417,000 --> 0:18:02,000
On some branches hang plenty of mulberries.

299
0:18:03,000 --> 0:18:06,000
You stretch your arm straight out to grab some."

300
0:18:08.042,000 --> 0:18:1,000
And this lovely letter, where he writes,

301
0:18:10.5,000 --> 0:18:14,000
"Close your eyes and listen to the sounds of the words.

302
0:18:14.875,000 --> 0:18:16,000
I know this poem by heart

303
0:18:17.083,000 --> 0:18:19,000
and I would like you to know it, too."

304
0:18:21.375,000 --> 0:18:22,000
Thank you so much everyone.

305
0:18:23.208,000 --> 0:18:26,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.472,000 --> 0:00:16,000
We often hear these days that the immigration system is broken.

2
0:00:16.954,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I want to make the case today that our immigration conversation is broken

3
0:00:21.624,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and to suggest some ways that, together, we might build a better one.

4
0:00:26.735,000 --> 0:00:28,000
In order to do that, I'm going to propose some new questions

5
0:00:29.658,000 --> 0:00:3,000
about immigration,

6
0:00:31.046,000 --> 0:00:32,000
the United States

7
0:00:32.276,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and the world,

8
0:00:33.623,000 --> 0:00:38,000
questions that might move the borders of the immigration debate.

9
0:00:39.495,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I'm not going to begin with the feverish argument that we're currently having,

10
0:00:43.679,000 --> 0:00:47,000
even as the lives and well-being of immigrants are being put at risk

11
0:00:48.213,000 --> 0:00:5,000
at the US border and far beyond it.

12
0:00:51.567,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Instead, I'm going to begin with me in graduate school

13
0:00:54.225,000 --> 0:00:57,000
in New Jersey in the mid-1990s, earnestly studying US history,

14
0:00:57.929,000 --> 0:01:,000
which is what I currently teach as a professor at Vanderbilt University

15
0:01:01.368,000 --> 0:01:02,000
in Nashville, Tennessee.

16
0:01:03.602,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And when I wasn't studying,

17
0:01:05.112,000 --> 0:01:07,000
sometimes to avoid writing my dissertation,

18
0:01:07.38,000 --> 0:01:09,000
my friends and I would go into town

19
0:01:10.227,000 --> 0:01:14,000
to hand out neon-colored flyers, protesting legislation

20
0:01:15.088,000 --> 0:01:18,000
that was threatening to take away immigrants' rights.

21
0:01:19.481,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Our flyers were sincere, they were well-meaning,

22
0:01:22.313,000 --> 0:01:24,000
they were factually accurate ...

23
0:01:24.561,000 --> 0:01:26,000
But I realize now, they were also kind of a problem.

24
0:01:27.642,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Here's what they said:

25
0:01:28.839,000 --> 0:01:32,000
"Don't take away immigrant rights to public education,

26
0:01:33.366,000 --> 0:01:35,000
to medical services, to the social safety net.

27
0:01:36.114,000 --> 0:01:37,000
They work hard.

28
0:01:37.685,000 --> 0:01:38,000
They pay taxes.

29
0:01:39.605,000 --> 0:01:4,000
They're law-abiding.

30
0:01:41.484,000 --> 0:01:43,000
They use social services less than Americans do.

31
0:01:45.054,000 --> 0:01:47,000
They're eager to learn English,

32
0:01:47.135,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and their children serve in the US military all over the world."

33
0:01:52.419,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Now, these are, of course, arguments that we hear every day.

34
0:01:55.942,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Immigrants and their advocates use them

35
0:01:59.444,000 --> 0:02:02,000
as they confront those who would deny immigrants their rights

36
0:02:03.198,000 --> 0:02:05,000
or even exclude them from society.

37
0:02:06.453,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And up to a certain point, it makes perfect sense

38
0:02:09.122,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that these would be the kinds of claims that immigrants' defenders would turn to.

39
0:02:14.595,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But in the long term, and maybe even in the short term,

40
0:02:18.448,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I think these arguments can be counterproductive.

41
0:02:21.996,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Why?

42
0:02:23.525,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Because it's always an uphill battle

43
0:02:25.637,000 --> 0:02:28,000
to defend yourself on your opponent's terrain.

44
0:02:29.669,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And, unwittingly, the handouts my friends and I were handing out

45
0:02:33.657,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and the versions of these arguments that we hear today

46
0:02:37.075,000 --> 0:02:39,000
were actually playing the anti-immigrants game.

47
0:02:40.701,000 --> 0:02:42,000
We were playing that game in part by envisioning

48
0:02:43.461,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that immigrants were outsiders,

49
0:02:45.714,000 --> 0:02:48,000
rather than, as I'm hoping to suggest in a few minutes,

50
0:02:48.879,000 --> 0:02:52,000
people that are already, in important ways, on the inside.

51
0:02:54.303,000 --> 0:02:57,000
It's those who are hostile to immigrants, the nativists,

52
0:02:57.864,000 --> 0:02:59,000
who have succeeded in framing the immigration debate

53
0:03:00.682,000 --> 0:03:02,000
around three main questions.

54
0:03:03.588,000 --> 0:03:08,000
First, there's the question of whether immigrants can be useful tools.

55
0:03:09.235,000 --> 0:03:12,000
How can we use immigrants?

56
0:03:12.776,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Will they make us richer and stronger?

57
0:03:17.751,000 --> 0:03:19,000
The nativist answer to this question is no,

58
0:03:20.691,000 --> 0:03:22,000
immigrants have little or nothing to offer.

59
0:03:24.993,000 --> 0:03:28,000
The second question is whether immigrants are others.

60
0:03:30.201,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Can immigrants become more like us?

61
0:03:34.705,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Are they capable of becoming more like us?

62
0:03:37.395,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Are they capable of assimilating?

63
0:03:39.052,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Are they willing to assimilate?

64
0:03:41.477,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Here, again, the nativist answer is no,

65
0:03:43.836,000 --> 0:03:47,000
immigrants are permanently different from us and inferior to us.

66
0:03:49.157,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And the third question is whether immigrants are parasites.

67
0:03:54.745,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Are they dangerous to us? And will they drain our resources?

68
0:03:59.177,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Here, the nativist answer is yes and yes,

69
0:04:02.781,000 --> 0:04:05,000
immigrants pose a threat and they sap our wealth.

70
0:04:07.761,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I would suggest that these three questions and the nativist animus behind them

71
0:04:11.87,000 --> 0:04:15,000
have succeeded in framing the larger contours of the immigration debate.

72
0:04:15.984,000 --> 0:04:19,000
These questions are anti-immigrant and nativist at their core,

73
0:04:20.859,000 --> 0:04:25,000
built around a kind of hierarchical division of insiders and outsiders,

74
0:04:26.777,000 --> 0:04:27,000
us and them,

75
0:04:28.364,000 --> 0:04:3,000
in which only we matter,

76
0:04:31.038,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and they don't.

77
0:04:33.201,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And what gives these questions traction and power

78
0:04:36.641,000 --> 0:04:38,000
beyond the circle of committed nativists

79
0:04:38.829,000 --> 0:04:42,000
is the way they tap into an everyday, seemingly harmless sense

80
0:04:43.5,000 --> 0:04:44,000
of national belonging

81
0:04:45.251,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and activate it, heighten it

82
0:04:47.94,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and inflame it.

83
0:04:50.74,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Nativists commit themselves to making stark distinctions

84
0:04:55.205,000 --> 0:04:57,000
between insiders and outsiders.

85
0:04:57.743,000 --> 0:05:01,000
But the distinction itself is at the heart of the way nations define themselves.

86
0:05:02.658,000 --> 0:05:05,000
The fissures between inside and outside,

87
0:05:06.44,000 --> 0:05:1,000
which often run deepest along lines of race and religion,

88
0:05:11.146,000 --> 0:05:14,000
are always there to be deepened and exploited.

89
0:05:15.37,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And that potentially gives nativist approaches resonance

90
0:05:19.517,000 --> 0:05:22,000
far beyond those who consider themselves anti-immigrant,

91
0:05:23.376,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and remarkably, even among some who consider themselves pro-immigrant.

92
0:05:28.325,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So, for example, when Immigrants Act allies

93
0:05:32.755,000 --> 0:05:35,000
answer these questions the nativists are posing,

94
0:05:35.981,000 --> 0:05:36,000
they take them seriously.

95
0:05:37.342,000 --> 0:05:4,000
They legitimate those questions and, to some extent,

96
0:05:40.521,000 --> 0:05:43,000
the anti-immigrant assumptions that are behind them.

97
0:05:44.414,000 --> 0:05:47,000
When we take these questions seriously without even knowing it,

98
0:05:48.154,000 --> 0:05:51,000
we're reinforcing the closed, exclusionary borders

99
0:05:51.999,000 --> 0:05:53,000
of the immigration conversation.

100
0:05:55.458,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So how did we get here?

101
0:05:56.649,000 --> 0:06:,000
How did these become the leading ways that we talk about immigration?

102
0:06:01.523,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Here, we need some backstory,

103
0:06:02.976,000 --> 0:06:04,000
which is where my history training comes in.

104
0:06:05.332,000 --> 0:06:11,000
During the first century of the US's status as an independent nation,

105
0:06:11.562,000 --> 0:06:14,000
it did very little to restrict immigration at the national level.

106
0:06:15.298,000 --> 0:06:17,000
In fact, many policymakers and employers worked hard

107
0:06:17.847,000 --> 0:06:19,000
to recruit immigrants

108
0:06:20.386,000 --> 0:06:21,000
to build up industry

109
0:06:22.032,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and to serve as settlers, to seize the continent.

110
0:06:26.948,000 --> 0:06:28,000
But after the Civil War,

111
0:06:29.561,000 --> 0:06:33,000
nativist voices rose in volume and in power.

112
0:06:35.371,000 --> 0:06:39,000
The Asian, Latin American, Caribbean and European immigrants

113
0:06:40.307,000 --> 0:06:42,000
who dug Americans' canals,

114
0:06:43.105,000 --> 0:06:44,000
cooked their dinners,

115
0:06:44.928,000 --> 0:06:45,000
fought their wars

116
0:06:46.644,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and put their children to bed at night

117
0:06:48.869,000 --> 0:06:51,000
were met with a new and intense xenophobia,

118
0:06:52.452,000 --> 0:06:55,000
which cast immigrants as permanent outsiders

119
0:06:56.039,000 --> 0:06:59,000
who should never be allowed to become insiders.

120
0:07:00.148,000 --> 0:07:02,000
By the mid-1920s, the nativists had won,

121
0:07:02.889,000 --> 0:07:03,000
erecting racist laws

122
0:07:04.635,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that closed out untold numbers of vulnerable immigrants and refugees.

123
0:07:11.158,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Immigrants and their allies did their best to fight back,

124
0:07:14.355,000 --> 0:07:16,000
but they found themselves on the defensive,

125
0:07:16.853,000 --> 0:07:19,000
caught in some ways in the nativists' frames.

126
0:07:20.775,000 --> 0:07:24,000
When nativists said that immigrants weren't useful,

127
0:07:25.633,000 --> 0:07:27,000
their allies said yes, they are.

128
0:07:28.932,000 --> 0:07:32,000
When nativists accused immigrants of being others,

129
0:07:33.898,000 --> 0:07:35,000
their allies promised that they would assimilate.

130
0:07:37.789,000 --> 0:07:43,000
When nativists charged that immigrants were dangerous parasites,

131
0:07:43.843,000 --> 0:07:46,000
their allies emphasized their loyalty, their obedience,

132
0:07:46.975,000 --> 0:07:48,000
their hard work and their thrift.

133
0:07:50.293,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Even as advocates welcomed immigrants,

134
0:07:53.77,000 --> 0:07:59,000
many still regarded immigrants as outsiders to be pitied, to be rescued,

135
0:08:00.213,000 --> 0:08:01,000
to be uplifted

136
0:08:02.048,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and to be tolerated,

137
0:08:04.217,000 --> 0:08:09,000
but never fully brought inside as equals in rights and respect.

138
0:08:11.194,000 --> 0:08:17,000
After World War II, and especially from the mid-1960s until really recently,

139
0:08:17.914,000 --> 0:08:19,000
immigrants and their allies turned the tide,

140
0:08:20.295,000 --> 0:08:23,000
overthrowing mid-20th century restriction

141
0:08:23.721,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and winning instead a new system that prioritized family reunification,

142
0:08:28.341,000 --> 0:08:29,000
the admission of refugees

143
0:08:29.984,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and the admission of those with special skills.

144
0:08:33.642,000 --> 0:08:34,000
But even then,

145
0:08:34.836,000 --> 0:08:38,000
they didn't succeed in fundamentally changing the terms of the debate,

146
0:08:39.482,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and so that framework endured,

147
0:08:41.721,000 --> 0:08:45,000
ready to be taken up again in our own convulsive moment.

148
0:08:47.744,000 --> 0:08:49,000
That conversation is broken.

149
0:08:50.793,000 --> 0:08:53,000
The old questions are harmful and divisive.

150
0:08:55.486,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So how do we get from that conversation

151
0:08:58.027,000 --> 0:09:02,000
to one that's more likely to get us closer to a world that is fairer,

152
0:09:02.6,000 --> 0:09:03,000
that is more just,

153
0:09:04.195,000 --> 0:09:05,000
that's more secure?

154
0:09:07.036,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I want to suggest that what we have to do

155
0:09:09.399,000 --> 0:09:12,000
is one of the hardest things that any society can do:

156
0:09:13.112,000 --> 0:09:16,000
to redraw the boundaries of who counts,

157
0:09:17.113,000 --> 0:09:2,000
of whose life, whose rights

158
0:09:20.311,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and whose thriving matters.

159
0:09:23.485,000 --> 0:09:25,000
We need to redraw the boundaries.

160
0:09:26.308,000 --> 0:09:29,000
We need to redraw the borders of us.

161
0:09:31.242,000 --> 0:09:36,000
In order to do that, we need to first take on a worldview that's widely held

162
0:09:36.545,000 --> 0:09:38,000
but also seriously flawed.

163
0:09:39.08,000 --> 0:09:41,000
According to that worldview,

164
0:09:41.372,000 --> 0:09:44,000
there's the inside of the national boundaries, inside the nation,

165
0:09:45.103,000 --> 0:09:49,000
which is where we live, work and mind our own business.

166
0:09:49.766,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And then there's the outside; there's everywhere else.

167
0:09:53.635,000 --> 0:09:56,000
According to this worldview, when immigrants cross into the nation,

168
0:09:57.483,000 --> 0:09:59,000
they're moving from the outside to the inside,

169
0:10:00.473,000 --> 0:10:02,000
but they remain outsiders.

170
0:10:03.145,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Any power or resources they receive

171
0:10:07.337,000 --> 0:10:1,000
are gifts from us rather than rights.

172
0:10:11.371,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Now, it's not hard to see why this is such a commonly held worldview.

173
0:10:16.236,000 --> 0:10:19,000
It's reinforced in everyday ways that we talk and act and behave,

174
0:10:20.042,000 --> 0:10:23,000
down to the bordered maps that we hang up in our schoolrooms.

175
0:10:23.727,000 --> 0:10:26,000
The problem with this worldview is that it just doesn't correspond

176
0:10:27.379,000 --> 0:10:29,000
to the way the world actually works,

177
0:10:29.64,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and the way it has worked in the past.

178
0:10:33.111,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Of course, American workers have built up wealth in society.

179
0:10:38.391,000 --> 0:10:39,000
But so have immigrants,

180
0:10:39.607,000 --> 0:10:42,000
particularly in parts of the American economy that are indispensable

181
0:10:43.485,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and where few Americans work, like agriculture.

182
0:10:46.84,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Since the nation's founding,

183
0:10:48.462,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Americans have been inside the American workforce.

184
0:10:53.66,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Of course, Americans have built up institutions in society

185
0:10:59.006,000 --> 0:11:,000
that guarantee rights.

186
0:11:01.199,000 --> 0:11:02,000
But so have immigrants.

187
0:11:02.699,000 --> 0:11:05,000
They've been there during every major social movement,

188
0:11:06.095,000 --> 0:11:08,000
like civil rights and organized labor,

189
0:11:08.575,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that have fought to expand rights in society for everyone.

190
0:11:12.364,000 --> 0:11:15,000
So immigrants are already inside the struggle

191
0:11:15.836,000 --> 0:11:17,000
for rights, democracy and freedom.

192
0:11:19.979,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And finally, Americans and other citizens of the Global North

193
0:11:24.125,000 --> 0:11:26,000
haven't minded their own business,

194
0:11:26.54,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and they haven't stayed within their own borders.

195
0:11:28.906,000 --> 0:11:3,000
They haven't respected other nations' borders.

196
0:11:31.083,000 --> 0:11:33,000
They've gone out into the world with their armies,

197
0:11:33.442,000 --> 0:11:35,000
they've taken over territories and resources,

198
0:11:35.922,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and they've extracted enormous profits from many of the countries

199
0:11:39.617,000 --> 0:11:4,000
that immigrants are from.

200
0:11:42.402,000 --> 0:11:47,000
In this sense, many immigrants are actually already inside American power.

201
0:11:49.268,000 --> 0:11:53,000
With this different map of inside and outside in mind,

202
0:11:54.18,000 --> 0:11:56,000
the question isn't whether receiving countries

203
0:11:57.143,000 --> 0:11:59,000
are going to let immigrants in.

204
0:11:59.899,000 --> 0:12:,000
They're already in.

205
0:12:02.033,000 --> 0:12:04,000
The question is whether the United States and other countries

206
0:12:04.972,000 --> 0:12:08,000
are going to give immigrants access to the rights and resources

207
0:12:09.054,000 --> 0:12:12,000
that their work, their activism and their home countries

208
0:12:13.033,000 --> 0:12:16,000
have already played a fundamental role in creating.

209
0:12:18.468,000 --> 0:12:2,000
With this new map in mind,

210
0:12:20.827,000 --> 0:12:24,000
we can turn to a set of tough, new, urgently needed questions,

211
0:12:25.374,000 --> 0:12:28,000
radically different from the ones we've asked before --

212
0:12:29.117,000 --> 0:12:33,000
questions that might change the borders of the immigration debate.

213
0:12:34.509,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Our three questions are about workers' rights,

214
0:12:38.798,000 --> 0:12:39,000
about responsibility

215
0:12:40.497,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and about equality.

216
0:12:44.933,000 --> 0:12:46,000
First, we need to be asking about workers' rights.

217
0:12:48.405,000 --> 0:12:52,000
How do existing policies make it harder for immigrants to defend themselves

218
0:12:52.719,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and easier for them to be exploited,

219
0:12:54.615,000 --> 0:12:57,000
driving down wages, rights and protections for everyone?

220
0:12:58.742,000 --> 0:13:01,000
When immigrants are threatened with roundups, detention and deportations,

221
0:13:02.402,000 --> 0:13:04,000
their employers know that they can be abused,

222
0:13:04.538,000 --> 0:13:06,000
that they can be told that if they fight back,

223
0:13:06.991,000 --> 0:13:07,000
they'll be turned over to ICE.

224
0:13:09.46,000 --> 0:13:11,000
When employers know

225
0:13:11.734,000 --> 0:13:14,000
that they can terrorize an immigrant with his lack of papers,

226
0:13:16.161,000 --> 0:13:18,000
it makes that worker hyper-exploitable,

227
0:13:18.241,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and that has impacts not only for immigrant workers

228
0:13:21.117,000 --> 0:13:22,000
but for all workers.

229
0:13:24.375,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Second, we need to ask questions about responsibility.

230
0:13:28.004,000 --> 0:13:31,000
What role have rich, powerful countries like the United States

231
0:13:31.954,000 --> 0:13:33,000
played in making it hard or impossible

232
0:13:34.463,000 --> 0:13:37,000
for immigrants to stay in their home countries?

233
0:13:38.331,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Picking up and moving from your country is difficult and dangerous,

234
0:13:41.586,000 --> 0:13:44,000
but many immigrants simply do not have the option of staying home

235
0:13:45.324,000 --> 0:13:47,000
if they want to survive.

236
0:13:47.531,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Wars, trade agreements

237
0:13:49.282,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and consumer habits rooted in the Global North

238
0:13:51.956,000 --> 0:13:55,000
play a major and devastating role here.

239
0:13:57.489,000 --> 0:14:,000
What responsibilities do the United States,

240
0:14:00.564,000 --> 0:14:02,000
the European Union and China --

241
0:14:02.617,000 --> 0:14:04,000
the world's leading carbon emitters --

242
0:14:04.884,000 --> 0:14:08,000
have to the millions of people already uprooted by global warming?

243
0:14:11.979,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And third, we need to ask questions about equality.

244
0:14:15.569,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Global inequality is a wrenching, intensifying problem.

245
0:14:20.037,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Income and wealth gaps are widening around the world.

246
0:14:23.504,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Increasingly, what determines whether you're rich or poor,

247
0:14:26.856,000 --> 0:14:27,000
more than anything else,

248
0:14:28.195,000 --> 0:14:29,000
is what country you're born in,

249
0:14:30.057,000 --> 0:14:33,000
which might seem great if you're from a prosperous country.

250
0:14:33.133,000 --> 0:14:37,000
But it actually means a profoundly unjust distribution

251
0:14:37.72,000 --> 0:14:42,000
of the chances for a long, healthy, fulfilling life.

252
0:14:43.464,000 --> 0:14:45,000
When immigrants send money or goods home to their family,

253
0:14:46.175,000 --> 0:14:49,000
it plays a significant role in narrowing these gaps,

254
0:14:49.348,000 --> 0:14:51,000
if a very incomplete one.

255
0:14:51.771,000 --> 0:14:54,000
It does more than all of the foreign aid programs

256
0:14:54.83,000 --> 0:14:55,000
in the world combined.

257
0:14:58.778,000 --> 0:15:,000
We began with the nativist questions,

258
0:15:01.373,000 --> 0:15:03,000
about immigrants as tools,

259
0:15:04.007,000 --> 0:15:05,000
as others

260
0:15:05.642,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and as parasites.

261
0:15:07.666,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Where might these new questions about worker rights,

262
0:15:11.18,000 --> 0:15:12,000
about responsibility

263
0:15:12.801,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and about equality

264
0:15:14.379,000 --> 0:15:15,000
take us?

265
0:15:16.4,000 --> 0:15:2,000
These questions reject pity, and they embrace justice.

266
0:15:21.888,000 --> 0:15:24,000
These questions reject the nativist and nationalist division

267
0:15:25.638,000 --> 0:15:26,000
of us versus them.

268
0:15:27.083,000 --> 0:15:3,000
They're going to help prepare us for problems that are coming

269
0:15:30.299,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and problems like global warming that are already upon us.

270
0:15:35.493,000 --> 0:15:38,000
It's not going to be easy to turn away from the questions that we've been asking

271
0:15:39.308,000 --> 0:15:41,000
towards this new set of questions.

272
0:15:42.281,000 --> 0:15:43,000
It's no small challenge

273
0:15:43.723,000 --> 0:15:47,000
to take on and broaden the borders of us.

274
0:15:48.874,000 --> 0:15:52,000
It will take wit, inventiveness and courage.

275
0:15:53.228,000 --> 0:15:55,000
The old questions have been with us for a long time,

276
0:15:55.861,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and they're not going to give way on their own,

277
0:15:58.601,000 --> 0:16:,000
and they're not going to give way overnight.

278
0:16:01.907,000 --> 0:16:03,000
And even if we manage to change the questions,

279
0:16:04.101,000 --> 0:16:05,000
the answers are going to be complicated,

280
0:16:06.067,000 --> 0:16:09,000
and they're going to require sacrifices and tradeoffs.

281
0:16:10.377,000 --> 0:16:13,000
And in an unequal world, we're always going to have to pay attention

282
0:16:13.68,000 --> 0:16:16,000
to the question of who has the power to join the conversation

283
0:16:17.177,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and who doesn't.

284
0:16:18.878,000 --> 0:16:2,000
But the borders of the immigration debate

285
0:16:21.339,000 --> 0:16:22,000
can be moved.

286
0:16:23.098,000 --> 0:16:25,000
It's up to all of us to move them.

287
0:16:26.542,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Thank you.

288
0:16:27.774,000 --> 0:16:29,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.817,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm a bit of a perfectionist.

2
0:00:16.086,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Now, how many times have you heard that one?

3
0:00:19.683,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Over drinks, maybe, with friends, or perhaps with family at Thanksgiving.

4
0:00:25.281,000 --> 0:00:27,000
It's everyone's favorite flaw,

5
0:00:27.844,000 --> 0:00:3,000
it's that now quite common response

6
0:00:31.101,000 --> 0:00:35,000
to the difficult, final question at job interviews:

7
0:00:36.165,000 --> 0:00:37,000
"My biggest weakness?

8
0:00:38.864,000 --> 0:00:39,000
That's my perfectionism."

9
0:00:41.339,000 --> 0:00:44,000
You see, for something that supposedly holds us back,

10
0:00:45.261,000 --> 0:00:48,000
it's quite remarkable how many of us are quite happy to hold our hands up

11
0:00:48.809,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and say we're perfectionists.

12
0:00:51.25,000 --> 0:00:55,000
But there's an interesting and serious point

13
0:00:55.754,000 --> 0:01:01,000
because our begrudging admiration for perfection is so pervasive

14
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that we never really stop to question that concept in its own terms.

15
0:01:06.363,000 --> 0:01:09,000
What does it say about us and our society

16
0:01:10.157,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that there is a kind of celebration in perfection?

17
0:01:14.489,000 --> 0:01:2,000
We tend to hold perfectionism up as an insignia of worth.

18
0:01:21.704,000 --> 0:01:23,000
The emblem of the successful.

19
0:01:25.718,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Yet, in my time studying perfectionism,

20
0:01:27.996,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I've seen limited evidence that perfectionists are more successful.

21
0:01:31.861,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Quite the contrary --

22
0:01:33.068,000 --> 0:01:36,000
they feel discontented and dissatisfied

23
0:01:36.212,000 --> 0:01:4,000
amid a lingering sense that they're never quite perfect enough.

24
0:01:40.322,000 --> 0:01:42,000
We know from clinician case reports

25
0:01:42.553,000 --> 0:01:45,000
that perfectionism conceals a host of psychological difficulties,

26
0:01:45.835,000 --> 0:01:49,000
including things like depression, anxiety, anorexia, bulimia

27
0:01:49.989,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and even suicide ideation.

28
0:01:52.252,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And what's more worrying is that over the last 25 years,

29
0:01:56.06,000 --> 0:01:59,000
we have seen perfectionism rise at an alarming rate.

30
0:02:00.209,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And at the same time,

31
0:02:01.634,000 --> 0:02:04,000
we have seen more mental illness among young people than ever before.

32
0:02:05.209,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Rates of suicide in the US alone

33
0:02:08.403,000 --> 0:02:11,000
increased by 25 percent across the last two decades.

34
0:02:12.379,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And we're beginning to see similar trends emerge across Canada,

35
0:02:15.561,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and in my home country, the United Kingdom.

36
0:02:18.792,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Now, our research is suggesting

37
0:02:21.649,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that perfectionism is rising as society is changing.

38
0:02:25.975,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And a changed society reflects a changed sense of personal identity

39
0:02:30.479,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and, with it, differences in the way in which young people interact

40
0:02:34.898,000 --> 0:02:36,000
with each other and the world around them.

41
0:02:36.986,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And there are some unique characteristics about our preeminent, market-based society

42
0:02:42.499,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that include things like unrestricted choice

43
0:02:44.609,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and personal freedom,

44
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and these are characteristics that we feel are contributing

45
0:02:49.855,000 --> 0:02:52,000
to almost epidemic levels of this problem.

46
0:02:53.68,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So let me give you an example.

47
0:02:56.069,000 --> 0:03:,000
Young people today are more preoccupied with the attainment of the perfect life

48
0:03:00.585,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and lifestyle.

49
0:03:01.76,000 --> 0:03:03,000
In terms of their image, status and wealth.

50
0:03:03.93,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Data from Pew show that young people

51
0:03:08.719,000 --> 0:03:12,000
born in the US in the late 1980s

52
0:03:12.942,000 --> 0:03:16,000
are 20 percent more likely to report being materially rich

53
0:03:17.641,000 --> 0:03:18,000
as among their most important life goals,

54
0:03:19.649,000 --> 0:03:22,000
relative to their parents and their grandparents.

55
0:03:22.791,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Young people also borrow more heavily than did older generations,

56
0:03:25.88,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and they spend a much greater proportion of their income on image goods

57
0:03:30.117,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and status possessions.

58
0:03:31.879,000 --> 0:03:35,000
These possessions, their lives and their lifestyles

59
0:03:36.521,000 --> 0:03:4,000
are now displayed in vivid detail on the ubiquitous social media platforms

60
0:03:40.998,000 --> 0:03:43,000
of Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat.

61
0:03:44.982,000 --> 0:03:46,000
In this new visual culture,

62
0:03:47.101,000 --> 0:03:53,000
the appearance of perfection is far more important than the reality.

63
0:03:54.396,000 --> 0:03:57,000
If one side of the modern landscape

64
0:03:57.478,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that we have so lavishly furnished for young people

65
0:04:00.166,000 --> 0:04:02,000
is this idea that there's a perfectible life

66
0:04:02.468,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and that there's a perfectible lifestyle,

67
0:04:04.633,000 --> 0:04:06,000
then the other is surely work.

68
0:04:06.823,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Nothing is out of reach for those who want it badly enough.

69
0:04:10.093,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Or so we're told.

70
0:04:11.585,000 --> 0:04:14,000
This is the idea at the heart of the American dream.

71
0:04:15.649,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Opportunity, meritocracy, the self-made person, hard work.

72
0:04:20.22,000 --> 0:04:22,000
The notion that hard work always pays off.

73
0:04:23.061,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And above all, the idea that we're captains of our own destiny.

74
0:04:27.633,000 --> 0:04:3,000
These ideas, they connect our wealth, our status

75
0:04:30.991,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and our image with our innate, personal value.

76
0:04:35.157,000 --> 0:04:37,000
But it is, of course, complete fiction.

77
0:04:37.228,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Because even if there were equality of opportunity,

78
0:04:40.786,000 --> 0:04:43,000
the idea that we are captains of our own destiny

79
0:04:43.906,000 --> 0:04:45,000
disguises a much darker reality for young people

80
0:04:46.243,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that they are subject to an almost ongoing economic tribunal.

81
0:04:49.778,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Metrics, rankings, lead tables

82
0:04:52.096,000 --> 0:04:55,000
have emerged as the yardsticks for which merit can be quantified

83
0:04:55.841,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and used to sort young people into schools, classes and colleges.

84
0:05:01.309,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Education is the first arena

85
0:05:03.58,000 --> 0:05:05,000
where measurement is so publicly played out

86
0:05:06.354,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and where metrics are being used

87
0:05:08.879,000 --> 0:05:11,000
as a tool to improve standards and performance.

88
0:05:12.22,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And it starts young.

89
0:05:14.18,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Young people in America's big city high schools

90
0:05:17.553,000 --> 0:05:22,000
take some 112 mandatory standardized tests

91
0:05:22.76,000 --> 0:05:24,000
between prekindergarten and the end of 12th grade.

92
0:05:26.117,000 --> 0:05:28,000
No wonder young people report a strong need to strive,

93
0:05:28.847,000 --> 0:05:3,000
perform and achieve at the center of modern life.

94
0:05:31.351,000 --> 0:05:33,000
They've been conditioned to define themselves

95
0:05:34.265,000 --> 0:05:41,000
in the strict and narrow terms of grades, percentiles and lead tables.

96
0:05:42.103,000 --> 0:05:46,000
This is a society that preys on their insecurities.

97
0:05:46.151,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Insecurities about how they are performing

98
0:05:48.3,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and how they are appearing to other people.

99
0:05:50.736,000 --> 0:05:53,000
This is a society that amplifies their imperfections.

100
0:05:54.553,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Every flaw, every unforeseen setback

101
0:05:57.276,000 --> 0:06:02,000
increases a need to perform more perfectly next time, or else,

102
0:06:02.434,000 --> 0:06:04,000
bluntly, you're a failure.

103
0:06:05.188,000 --> 0:06:08,000
That feeling of being flawed and deficient is especially pervasive --

104
0:06:08.886,000 --> 0:06:09,000
just talk to young people.

105
0:06:10.403,000 --> 0:06:12,000
"How should I look, how should I behave?"

106
0:06:12.673,000 --> 0:06:13,000
"I should look like that model,

107
0:06:14.188,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I should have as many followers as that Instagram influencer,

108
0:06:17.141,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I must do better in school."

109
0:06:20.088,000 --> 0:06:24,000
In my role as mentor to many young people,

110
0:06:24.89,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I see these lived effects of perfectionism firsthand.

111
0:06:28.374,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And one student sticks out in my mind very vividly.

112
0:06:32.427,000 --> 0:06:35,000
John, not his real name, was ambitious,

113
0:06:36.331,000 --> 0:06:37,000
hardworking and diligent

114
0:06:37.673,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and on the surface, he was exceptionally high-achieving,

115
0:06:40.32,000 --> 0:06:43,000
often getting first-class grades for his work.

116
0:06:43.847,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Yet, no matter how well John achieved,

117
0:06:47.347,000 --> 0:06:5,000
he always seemed to recast his successes as abject failures,

118
0:06:50.625,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and in meetings with me,

119
0:06:51.823,000 --> 0:06:54,000
he would talk openly about how he'd let himself and others down.

120
0:06:55.149,000 --> 0:06:57,000
John's justification was quite simple:

121
0:06:57.911,000 --> 0:06:59,000
How could he be a success

122
0:07:00.157,000 --> 0:07:02,000
when he was trying so much harder than other people

123
0:07:02.577,000 --> 0:07:04,000
just to attain the same outcomes?

124
0:07:04.72,000 --> 0:07:08,000
See, John's perfectionism, his unrelenting work ethic,

125
0:07:09.359,000 --> 0:07:12,000
was only serving to expose what he saw as his inner weakness

126
0:07:13.014,000 --> 0:07:15,000
to himself and to others.

127
0:07:16.212,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Cases like John's speak to the harmfulness of perfectionism

128
0:07:19.634,000 --> 0:07:21,000
as a way of being in the world.

129
0:07:21.958,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Contrary to popular belief,

130
0:07:23.276,000 --> 0:07:27,000
perfectionism is never about perfecting things or perfecting tasks.

131
0:07:27.53,000 --> 0:07:29,000
It's not about striving for excellence.

132
0:07:30.18,000 --> 0:07:32,000
John's case highlights this vividly.

133
0:07:32.893,000 --> 0:07:35,000
At its root, perfectionism is about perfecting the self.

134
0:07:37.505,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Or, more precisely, perfecting an imperfect self.

135
0:07:41.52,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And you can think about it like a mountain of achievement

136
0:07:45.652,000 --> 0:07:47,000
that perfectionism leads us to imagine ourselves scaling.

137
0:07:48.509,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And we think to ourselves, "Once I've reached that summit,

138
0:07:51.437,000 --> 0:07:54,000
then people will see I'm not flawed, and I'll be worth something."

139
0:07:55.687,000 --> 0:07:56,000
But what perfectionism doesn't tell us

140
0:07:57.56,000 --> 0:07:58,000
is that soon after reaching that summit,

141
0:07:59.513,000 --> 0:08:03,000
we will be called down again to the fresh lowlands of insecurity and shame,

142
0:08:03.735,000 --> 0:08:05,000
just to try and scale that peak again.

143
0:08:06.411,000 --> 0:08:08,000
This is the cycle of self-defeat.

144
0:08:08.879,000 --> 0:08:12,000
In the pursuit of unattainable perfection, a perfectionist just cannot step off.

145
0:08:13.315,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And it's why it's so difficult to treat.

146
0:08:16.014,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Now, we've known for decades and decades

147
0:08:18.356,000 --> 0:08:21,000
that perfectionism contributes to a host of psychological problems,

148
0:08:21.546,000 --> 0:08:23,000
but there was never a good way to measure it.

149
0:08:24.252,000 --> 0:08:25,000
That was until the late 1980s

150
0:08:25.738,000 --> 0:08:28,000
when two Canadians, Paul Hewitt and Gordon Flett,

151
0:08:28.905,000 --> 0:08:31,000
came along and developed a self-report measure of perfectionism.

152
0:08:32.156,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So that's right, folks, you can measure this,

153
0:08:35.03,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and it essentially captures three core elements of perfectionism.

154
0:08:40.307,000 --> 0:08:42,000
The first is self-oriented perfectionism,

155
0:08:42.552,000 --> 0:08:45,000
the irrational desire to be perfect:

156
0:08:45.616,000 --> 0:08:47,000
"I strive to be as perfect as I can be."

157
0:08:48.566,000 --> 0:08:5,000
The second is socially prescribed perfectionism,

158
0:08:51.061,000 --> 0:08:55,000
the sense that the social environment is excessively demanding:

159
0:08:55.149,000 --> 0:08:57,000
"I feel that others are too demanding of me."

160
0:08:57.665,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And the third is other-oriented perfectionism,

161
0:09:00.006,000 --> 0:09:02,000
the imposition of unrealistic standards on other people:

162
0:09:02.879,000 --> 0:09:05,000
"If I ask somebody to do something, I expect it to be done perfectly."

163
0:09:07.076,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Now, research shows that all three elements of perfectionism

164
0:09:09.91,000 --> 0:09:1,000
associate with compromised mental health,

165
0:09:11.888,000 --> 0:09:13,000
including things like heightened depression,

166
0:09:13.99,000 --> 0:09:14,000
heightened anxiety and suicide ideation.

167
0:09:15.99,000 --> 0:09:17,000
But, by far, the most problematic element of perfectionism

168
0:09:18.853,000 --> 0:09:19,000
is socially prescribed perfectionism.

169
0:09:20.686,000 --> 0:09:23,000
That sense that everyone expects me to be perfect.

170
0:09:24.196,000 --> 0:09:25,000
This element of perfectionism

171
0:09:25.657,000 --> 0:09:27,000
has a large correlation with serious mental illness.

172
0:09:28.252,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And with today's emphasis on perfection at the forefront of my mind,

173
0:09:34.371,000 --> 0:09:37,000
I was curious to see whether these elements of perfectionism were changing.

174
0:09:37.958,000 --> 0:09:4,000
To date, research in this area is focused on immediate family relations,

175
0:09:41.453,000 --> 0:09:44,000
but we wanted to look at it at a broader level.

176
0:09:44.777,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So we took all of the data that had ever been collected

177
0:09:47.888,000 --> 0:09:51,000
in the 27 years since Paul and Gordon developed that perfectionism measure,

178
0:09:52.308,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and we isolated the data in college students.

179
0:09:54.911,000 --> 0:09:56,000
This turned out to be more than 40,000 young people

180
0:09:57.577,000 --> 0:09:59,000
from American, Canadian and British colleges,

181
0:09:59.712,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and with so much data available, we looked to see if there was a trend.

182
0:10:04.331,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And in all, it took us more than three years

183
0:10:06.419,000 --> 0:10:08,000
to collate all of this information, crunch the numbers,

184
0:10:09.189,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and write our report.

185
0:10:10.421,000 --> 0:10:13,000
But it was worth it because our analysis uncovered something alarming.

186
0:10:15.438,000 --> 0:10:18,000
All three elements of perfectionism have increased over time.

187
0:10:19.803,000 --> 0:10:23,000
But socially prescribed perfectionism saw the largest increase, and by far.

188
0:10:24.634,000 --> 0:10:25,000
In 1989,

189
0:10:25.943,000 --> 0:10:28,000
just nine percent of young people report clinically relevant levels

190
0:10:29.13,000 --> 0:10:3,000
of socially prescribed perfectionism.

191
0:10:30.925,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Those are levels that we might typically see in clinical populations.

192
0:10:35.069,000 --> 0:10:39,000
By 2017, that figure had doubled to 18 percent.

193
0:10:40.411,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And by 2050, projections based on the models that we tested

194
0:10:44.203,000 --> 0:10:46,000
indicate that almost one in three young people

195
0:10:46.703,000 --> 0:10:5,000
will report clinically relevant levels of socially prescribed perfectionism.

196
0:10:51.282,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Remember, this is the element of perfectionism

197
0:10:53.835,000 --> 0:10:55,000
that has the largest correlation with serious mental illness,

198
0:10:56.744,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and that's for good reason.

199
0:10:58.3,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Socially prescribed perfectionists feel a unrelenting need

200
0:11:01.649,000 --> 0:11:04,000
to meet the expectations of other people.

201
0:11:04.943,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And even if they do meet yesterday's expectation of perfection,

202
0:11:08.609,000 --> 0:11:11,000
they then raise the bar on themselves to an even higher degree

203
0:11:12.058,000 --> 0:11:15,000
because these folks believe that the better they do,

204
0:11:15.805,000 --> 0:11:17,000
the better that they're expected to do.

205
0:11:18.75,000 --> 0:11:23,000
This breeds a profound sense of helplessness and, worse, hopelessness.

206
0:11:24.95,000 --> 0:11:25,000
But is there hope?

207
0:11:26.378,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Of course there's hope.

208
0:11:27.815,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Perfectionists can and should hold on to certain things --

209
0:11:30.99,000 --> 0:11:33,000
they are typically bright, ambitious, conscientious and hardworking.

210
0:11:35.212,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And yes, treatment is complex.

211
0:11:38.228,000 --> 0:11:4,000
But a little bit of self-compassion,

212
0:11:41.093,000 --> 0:11:43,000
going easy on ourselves when things don't go well,

213
0:11:43.96,000 --> 0:11:46,000
can turn those qualities into greater personal peace and success.

214
0:11:47.064,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And then there's what we can do as caregivers.

215
0:11:50.19,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Perfectionism develops in our formative years,

216
0:11:53.379,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and so young people are more vulnerable.

217
0:11:56.292,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Parents can help their children

218
0:11:57.872,000 --> 0:12:,000
by supporting them unconditionally when they've tried but failed.

219
0:12:02.196,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And Mom and Dad can resist their understandable urge

220
0:12:04.681,000 --> 0:12:08,000
in today's highly competitive society to helicopter-parent,

221
0:12:09.323,000 --> 0:12:11,000
as a lot of anxiety is communicated

222
0:12:12.007,000 --> 0:12:15,000
when parents take on their kids' successes and failures as their own.

223
0:12:16.379,000 --> 0:12:19,000
But ultimately, our research raises important questions

224
0:12:19.947,000 --> 0:12:2,000
about how we are structuring society

225
0:12:22.525,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and whether our society's heavy emphasis on competition, evaluation and testing

226
0:12:26.256,000 --> 0:12:27,000
is benefiting young people.

227
0:12:28.184,000 --> 0:12:3,000
It's become commonplace for public figures to say

228
0:12:31.193,000 --> 0:12:34,000
that young people just need a little bit more resilience

229
0:12:34.272,000 --> 0:12:37,000
in the face of these new and unprecedented pressures.

230
0:12:38.534,000 --> 0:12:42,000
But I believe that is us washing our hands of the core issue

231
0:12:43.236,000 --> 0:12:45,000
because we have a shared responsibility

232
0:12:45.625,000 --> 0:12:49,000
to create a society and a culture in which young people need less perfection

233
0:12:51.403,000 --> 0:12:52,000
in the first place.

234
0:12:53.053,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Let's not kid ourselves.

235
0:12:54.427,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Creating that kind of world is an enormous challenge,

236
0:12:56.95,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and for a generation of young people

237
0:12:58.736,000 --> 0:13:,000
that live their lives in the 24/7 spotlight

238
0:13:00.791,000 --> 0:13:02,000
of metrics, lead tables and social media,

239
0:13:03.008,000 --> 0:13:05,000
perfectionism is inevitable,

240
0:13:05.545,000 --> 0:13:06,000
so long as they lack any purpose in life

241
0:13:07.514,000 --> 0:13:08,000
greater than how they are appearing

242
0:13:09.252,000 --> 0:13:11,000
or how they are performing to other people.

243
0:13:11.387,000 --> 0:13:12,000
What can they do about it?

244
0:13:12.95,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Every time they are knocked down from that mountaintop,

245
0:13:15.577,000 --> 0:13:18,000
they see no other option but to try scaling that peak again.

246
0:13:19.085,000 --> 0:13:2,000
The ancient Greeks knew

247
0:13:20.839,000 --> 0:13:23,000
that this endless struggle up and down the same mountain

248
0:13:24.327,000 --> 0:13:25,000
is not the road to happiness.

249
0:13:26.244,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Their image of hell was a man called Sisyphus,

250
0:13:28.792,000 --> 0:13:31,000
doomed for eternity to keep rolling the same boulder up a hill,

251
0:13:32.466,000 --> 0:13:35,000
only to see it roll back down and have to start again.

252
0:13:36.419,000 --> 0:13:37,000
So long as we teach young people

253
0:13:38.316,000 --> 0:13:41,000
that there is nothing more real or meaningful in their lives

254
0:13:41.737,000 --> 0:13:42,000
than this hopeless quest for perfection,

255
0:13:43.696,000 --> 0:13:45,000
then we are going to condemn future generations

256
0:13:45.935,000 --> 0:13:48,000
to that same futility and despair.

257
0:13:49.728,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And so we're left with a question.

258
0:13:52.437,000 --> 0:13:53,000
When are we going to appreciate

259
0:13:53.969,000 --> 0:13:56,000
that there is something fundamentally inhuman

260
0:13:57.58,000 --> 0:13:58,000
about limitless perfection?

261
0:14:00.064,000 --> 0:14:01,000
No one is flawless.

262
0:14:01.879,000 --> 0:14:05,000
If we want to help our young people escape the trap of perfectionism,

263
0:14:06.863,000 --> 0:14:09,000
then we will teach them that in a chaotic world,

264
0:14:10.094,000 --> 0:14:12,000
life will often defeat us, but that's OK.

265
0:14:13.848,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Failure is not weakness.

266
0:14:16.317,000 --> 0:14:19,000
If we want to help our young people outgrow this self-defeating snare

267
0:14:19.65,000 --> 0:14:2,000
of impossible perfection,

268
0:14:21.248,000 --> 0:14:25,000
then we will raise them in a society that has outgrown that very same delusion.

269
0:14:26.717,000 --> 0:14:27,000
But most of all,

270
0:14:28.201,000 --> 0:14:31,000
if we want our young people to enjoy mental, emotional

271
0:14:32.125,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and psychological health,

272
0:14:33.387,000 --> 0:14:37,000
then we will invite them to celebrate the joys

273
0:14:37.633,000 --> 0:14:4,000
and the beauties of imperfection

274
0:14:41.519,000 --> 0:14:47,000
as a normal and natural part of everyday living and loving.

275
0:14:48.408,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Thank you very much.

276
0:14:49.766,000 --> 0:14:52,000
(Applause)

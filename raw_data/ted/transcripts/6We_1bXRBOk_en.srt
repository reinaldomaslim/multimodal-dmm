2
0:00:12.528,000 --> 0:00:15,000
What would be a good end of life?

3
0:00:16.116,000 --> 0:00:17,000
And I'm talking about the very end.

4
0:00:18.106,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I'm talking about dying.

5
0:00:21.839,000 --> 0:00:24,000
We all think a lot about how to live well.

6
0:00:25.596,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I'd like to talk about increasing our chances of dying well.

7
0:00:30.028,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I'm not a geriatrician.

8
0:00:32.148,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I design reading programs for preschoolers.

9
0:00:34.852,000 --> 0:00:35,000
What I know about this topic

10
0:00:36.678,000 --> 0:00:4,000
comes from a qualitative study with a sample size of two.

11
0:00:41.08,000 --> 0:00:43,000
In the last few years, I helped two friends

12
0:00:43.785,000 --> 0:00:45,000
have the end of life they wanted.

13
0:00:46.026,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Jim and Shirley Modini spent their 68 years of marriage

14
0:00:49.354,000 --> 0:00:51,000
living off the grid on their 1,700-acre ranch

15
0:00:52.328,000 --> 0:00:54,000
in the mountains of Sonoma County.

16
0:00:54.419,000 --> 0:00:57,000
They kept just enough livestock to make ends meet

17
0:00:58.343,000 --> 0:01:01,000
so that the majority of their ranch would remain a refuge

18
0:01:01.65,000 --> 0:01:03,000
for the bears and lions and so many other things

19
0:01:03.883,000 --> 0:01:04,000
that lived there.

20
0:01:05.49,000 --> 0:01:07,000
This was their dream.

21
0:01:07.503,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I met Jim and Shirley in their 80s.

22
0:01:10.786,000 --> 0:01:13,000
They were both only children who chose not to have kids.

23
0:01:14.267,000 --> 0:01:16,000
As we became friends, I became their trustee

24
0:01:16.846,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and their medical advocate,

25
0:01:18.675,000 --> 0:01:2,000
but more importantly, I became

26
0:01:20.683,000 --> 0:01:23,000
the person who managed their end-of-life experiences.

27
0:01:24.442,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And we learned a few things about how to have a good end.

28
0:01:28.115,000 --> 0:01:29,000
In their final years, Jim and Shirley

29
0:01:30.086,000 --> 0:01:34,000
faced cancers, fractures, infections, neurological illness.

30
0:01:34.086,000 --> 0:01:35,000
It's true.

31
0:01:35.159,000 --> 0:01:37,000
At the end, our bodily functions

32
0:01:37.396,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and independence are declining to zero.

33
0:01:40.177,000 --> 0:01:43,000
What we found is that, with a plan and the right people,

34
0:01:43.331,000 --> 0:01:46,000
quality of life can remain high.

35
0:01:46.885,000 --> 0:01:47,000
The beginning of the end is triggered

36
0:01:48.324,000 --> 0:01:5,000
by a mortality awareness event, and during this time,

37
0:01:51.215,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Jim and Shirley chose ACR nature preserves

38
0:01:55.453,000 --> 0:01:57,000
to take their ranch over when they were gone.

39
0:01:57.985,000 --> 0:02:,000
This gave them the peace of mind to move forward.

40
0:02:01.565,000 --> 0:02:04,000
It might be a diagnosis. It might be your intuition.

41
0:02:05.041,000 --> 0:02:08,000
But one day, you're going to say, "This thing is going to get me."

42
0:02:08.257,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Jim and Shirley spent this time

43
0:02:09.813,000 --> 0:02:11,000
letting friends know that their end was near

44
0:02:11.816,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and that they were okay with that.

45
0:02:16.872,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Dying from cancer and dying from neurological illness

46
0:02:19.721,000 --> 0:02:2,000
are different.

47
0:02:21.292,000 --> 0:02:25,000
In both cases, last days are about quiet reassurance.

48
0:02:25.594,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Jim died first. He was conscious until the very end,

49
0:02:29.353,000 --> 0:02:31,000
but on his last day he couldn't talk.

50
0:02:31.54,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Through his eyes, we knew when he needed to hear again,

51
0:02:33.653,000 --> 0:02:35,000
"It is all set, Jim. We're going to take care of Shirley

52
0:02:36.489,000 --> 0:02:37,000
right here at the ranch,

53
0:02:37.658,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and ACR's going to take care of your wildlife forever."

54
0:02:41.487,000 --> 0:02:43,000
From this experience I'm going to share five practices.

55
0:02:44.179,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I've put worksheets online,

56
0:02:45.994,000 --> 0:02:47,000
so if you'd like, you can plan your own end.

57
0:02:48.777,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It starts with a plan.

58
0:02:51.244,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Most people say, "I'd like to die at home."

59
0:02:53.761,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Eighty percent of Americans die in a hospital

60
0:02:55.986,000 --> 0:02:56,000
or a nursing home.

61
0:02:57.49,000 --> 0:03:,000
Saying we'd like to die at home is not a plan.

62
0:03:01.145,000 --> 0:03:04,000
A lot of people say, "If I get like that, just shoot me."

63
0:03:04.362,000 --> 0:03:06,000
This is not a plan either; this is illegal.

64
0:03:06.858,000 --> 0:03:1,000
(Laughter)

65
0:03:10.912,000 --> 0:03:12,000
A plan involves answering

66
0:03:13.739,000 --> 0:03:15,000
straightforward questions about the end you want.

67
0:03:16.097,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Where do you want to be when you're no longer independent?

68
0:03:18.794,000 --> 0:03:2,000
What do you want in terms of medical intervention?

69
0:03:21.691,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And who's going to make sure your plan is followed?

70
0:03:24.065,000 --> 0:03:25,000
You will need advocates.

71
0:03:25.542,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Having more than one increases your chance

72
0:03:27.173,000 --> 0:03:28,000
of getting the end you want.

73
0:03:28.933,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Don't assume the natural choice is your spouse or child.

74
0:03:31.513,000 --> 0:03:33,000
You want someone who has the time and proximity

75
0:03:33.838,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to do this job well, and you want someone

76
0:03:36.429,000 --> 0:03:38,000
who can work with people under the pressure

77
0:03:38.668,000 --> 0:03:4,000
of an ever-changing situation.

78
0:03:41.029,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Hospital readiness is critical.

79
0:03:42.723,000 --> 0:03:43,000
You are likely to be headed to the emergency room,

80
0:03:44.627,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and you want to get this right.

81
0:03:46.406,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Prepare a one-page summary of your medical history,

82
0:03:49.269,000 --> 0:03:51,000
medications and physician information.

83
0:03:51.557,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Put this in a really bright envelope

84
0:03:53.831,000 --> 0:03:55,000
with copies of your insurance cards, your power of attorney,

85
0:03:56.667,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and your do-not-resuscitate order.

86
0:03:59.067,000 --> 0:04:,000
Have advocates keep a set in their car.

87
0:04:00.689,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Tape a set to your refrigerator.

88
0:04:02.576,000 --> 0:04:04,000
When you show up in the E.R. with this packet,

89
0:04:04.811,000 --> 0:04:07,000
your admission is streamlined in a material way.

90
0:04:08.534,000 --> 0:04:1,000
You're going to need caregivers.

91
0:04:11.139,000 --> 0:04:14,000
You'll need to assess your personality and financial situation

92
0:04:14.769,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to determine whether an elder care community

93
0:04:17.793,000 --> 0:04:19,000
or staying at home is your best choice.

94
0:04:20.192,000 --> 0:04:22,000
In either case, do not settle.

95
0:04:22.899,000 --> 0:04:25,000
We went through a number of not-quite-right caregivers

96
0:04:26.265,000 --> 0:04:28,000
before we found the perfect team

97
0:04:28.865,000 --> 0:04:3,000
led by Marsha,

98
0:04:31.104,000 --> 0:04:37,000
who won't let you win at bingo just because you're dying

99
0:04:37.826,000 --> 0:04:39,000
but will go out and take videos of your ranch for you

100
0:04:40.402,000 --> 0:04:42,000
when you can't get out there,

101
0:04:42.828,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and Caitlin, who won't let you skip your morning exercises

102
0:04:45.555,000 --> 0:04:46,000
but knows when you need to hear

103
0:04:47.161,000 --> 0:04:5,000
that your wife is in good hands.

104
0:04:50.753,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Finally, last words.

105
0:04:53.38,000 --> 0:04:54,000
What do you want to hear at the very end,

106
0:04:54.731,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and from whom would you like to hear it?

107
0:04:57.339,000 --> 0:04:59,000
In my experience, you'll want to hear

108
0:04:59.666,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that whatever you're worried about is going to be fine.

109
0:05:03.668,000 --> 0:05:06,000
When you believe it's okay to let go, you will.

110
0:05:07.62,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So, this is a topic that normally inspires fear and denial.

111
0:05:13.49,000 --> 0:05:15,000
What I've learned

112
0:05:15.596,000 --> 0:05:17,000
is if we put some time into planning our end of life,

113
0:05:18.531,000 --> 0:05:21,000
we have the best chance of maintaining our quality of life.

114
0:05:21.945,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Here are Jim and Shirley just after deciding

115
0:05:24.525,000 --> 0:05:26,000
who would take care of their ranch.

116
0:05:26.997,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Here's Jim just a few weeks before he died,

117
0:05:30.357,000 --> 0:05:33,000
celebrating a birthday he didn't expect to see.

118
0:05:33.731,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And here's Shirley just a few days before she died

119
0:05:37.749,000 --> 0:05:39,000
being read an article in that day's paper

120
0:05:39.76,000 --> 0:05:41,000
about the significance of the wildlife refuge

121
0:05:42.085,000 --> 0:05:44,000
at the Modini ranch.

122
0:05:44.341,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Jim and Shirley had a good end of life,

123
0:05:47.094,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and by sharing their story with you,

124
0:05:49.527,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I hope to increase our chances of doing the same.

125
0:05:52.382,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Thank you.

126
0:05:53.669,000 --> 0:05:58,000
(Applause)

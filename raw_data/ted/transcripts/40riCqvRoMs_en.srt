1
0:00:14.366,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Let me show you something.

2
0:00:18.104,000 --> 0:00:22,000
(Video) Girl: Okay, that's a cat sitting in a bed.

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
The boy is petting the elephant.

4
0:00:26.3,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Those are people that are going on an airplane.

5
0:00:30.654,000 --> 0:00:32,000
That's a big airplane.

6
0:00:33.464,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Fei-Fei Li: This is a three-year-old child

7
0:00:35.67,000 --> 0:00:38,000
describing what she sees in a series of photos.

8
0:00:39.349,000 --> 0:00:41,000
She might still have a lot to learn about this world,

9
0:00:42.194,000 --> 0:00:46,000
but she's already an expert at one very important task:

10
0:00:46.743,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to make sense of what she sees.

11
0:00:50.229,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Our society is more technologically advanced than ever.

12
0:00:54.455,000 --> 0:00:57,000
We send people to the moon, we make phones that talk to us

13
0:00:58.084,000 --> 0:01:02,000
or customize radio stations that can play only music we like.

14
0:01:03.03,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Yet, our most advanced machines and computers

15
0:01:07.085,000 --> 0:01:09,000
still struggle at this task.

16
0:01:09.988,000 --> 0:01:12,000
So I'm here today to give you a progress report

17
0:01:13.447,000 --> 0:01:17,000
on the latest advances in our research in computer vision,

18
0:01:17.494,000 --> 0:01:21,000
one of the most frontier and potentially revolutionary

19
0:01:21.655,000 --> 0:01:24,000
technologies in computer science.

20
0:01:24.861,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Yes, we have prototyped cars that can drive by themselves,

21
0:01:29.412,000 --> 0:01:32,000
but without smart vision, they cannot really tell the difference

22
0:01:33.265,000 --> 0:01:36,000
between a crumpled paper bag on the road, which can be run over,

23
0:01:37.235,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and a rock that size, which should be avoided.

24
0:01:41.415,000 --> 0:01:44,000
We have made fabulous megapixel cameras,

25
0:01:44.805,000 --> 0:01:47,000
but we have not delivered sight to the blind.

26
0:01:48.42,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Drones can fly over massive land,

27
0:01:51.725,000 --> 0:01:53,000
but don't have enough vision technology

28
0:01:53.859,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to help us to track the changes of the rainforests.

29
0:01:57.32,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Security cameras are everywhere,

30
0:02:00.27,000 --> 0:02:05,000
but they do not alert us when a child is drowning in a swimming pool.

31
0:02:06.167,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Photos and videos are becoming an integral part of global life.

32
0:02:11.762,000 --> 0:02:15,000
They're being generated at a pace that's far beyond what any human,

33
0:02:15.849,000 --> 0:02:17,000
or teams of humans, could hope to view,

34
0:02:18.632,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and you and I are contributing to that at this TED.

35
0:02:22.553,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Yet our most advanced software is still struggling at understanding

36
0:02:27.785,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and managing this enormous content.

37
0:02:31.661,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So in other words, collectively as a society,

38
0:02:36.933,000 --> 0:02:37,000
we're very much blind,

39
0:02:38.679,000 --> 0:02:41,000
because our smartest machines are still blind.

40
0:02:43.526,000 --> 0:02:45,000
"Why is this so hard?" you may ask.

41
0:02:46.452,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Cameras can take pictures like this one

42
0:02:49.145,000 --> 0:02:52,000
by converting lights into a two-dimensional array of numbers

43
0:02:53.139,000 --> 0:02:54,000
known as pixels,

44
0:02:54.789,000 --> 0:02:56,000
but these are just lifeless numbers.

45
0:02:57.04,000 --> 0:03:,000
They do not carry meaning in themselves.

46
0:03:00.151,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Just like to hear is not the same as to listen,

47
0:03:04.494,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to take pictures is not the same as to see,

48
0:03:08.534,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and by seeing, we really mean understanding.

49
0:03:13.293,000 --> 0:03:19,000
In fact, it took Mother Nature 540 million years of hard work

50
0:03:19.47,000 --> 0:03:2,000
to do this task,

51
0:03:21.443,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and much of that effort

52
0:03:23.324,000 --> 0:03:28,000
went into developing the visual processing apparatus of our brains,

53
0:03:28.595,000 --> 0:03:3,000
not the eyes themselves.

54
0:03:31.242,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So vision begins with the eyes,

55
0:03:33.989,000 --> 0:03:36,000
but it truly takes place in the brain.

56
0:03:38.287,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So for 15 years now, starting from my Ph.D. at Caltech

57
0:03:43.347,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and then leading Stanford's Vision Lab,

58
0:03:46.273,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I've been working with my mentors, collaborators and students

59
0:03:50.669,000 --> 0:03:52,000
to teach computers to see.

60
0:03:54.658,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Our research field is called computer vision and machine learning.

61
0:03:57.952,000 --> 0:04:,000
It's part of the general field of artificial intelligence.

62
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So ultimately, we want to teach the machines to see just like we do:

63
0:04:08.493,000 --> 0:04:13,000
naming objects, identifying people, inferring 3D geometry of things,

64
0:04:13.88,000 --> 0:04:18,000
understanding relations, emotions, actions and intentions.

65
0:04:19.568,000 --> 0:04:25,000
You and I weave together entire stories of people, places and things

66
0:04:25.721,000 --> 0:04:27,000
the moment we lay our gaze on them.

67
0:04:28.955,000 --> 0:04:33,000
The first step towards this goal is to teach a computer to see objects,

68
0:04:34.538,000 --> 0:04:37,000
the building block of the visual world.

69
0:04:37.906,000 --> 0:04:41,000
In its simplest terms, imagine this teaching process

70
0:04:42.34,000 --> 0:04:44,000
as showing the computers some training images

71
0:04:45.335,000 --> 0:04:48,000
of a particular object, let's say cats,

72
0:04:48.656,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and designing a model that learns from these training images.

73
0:04:53.393,000 --> 0:04:55,000
How hard can this be?

74
0:04:55.437,000 --> 0:04:59,000
After all, a cat is just a collection of shapes and colors,

75
0:04:59.489,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and this is what we did in the early days of object modeling.

76
0:05:03.575,000 --> 0:05:06,000
We'd tell the computer algorithm in a mathematical language

77
0:05:07.197,000 --> 0:05:1,000
that a cat has a round face, a chubby body,

78
0:05:10.54,000 --> 0:05:12,000
two pointy ears, and a long tail,

79
0:05:12.839,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and that looked all fine.

80
0:05:14.859,000 --> 0:05:16,000
But what about this cat?

81
0:05:16.972,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Laughter)

82
0:05:18.063,000 --> 0:05:19,000
It's all curled up.

83
0:05:19.689,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Now you have to add another shape and viewpoint to the object model.

84
0:05:24.408,000 --> 0:05:25,000
But what if cats are hidden?

85
0:05:27.143,000 --> 0:05:29,000
What about these silly cats?

86
0:05:31.112,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Now you get my point.

87
0:05:33.529,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Even something as simple as a household pet

88
0:05:36.896,000 --> 0:05:4,000
can present an infinite number of variations to the object model,

89
0:05:41.4,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and that's just one object.

90
0:05:44.573,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So about eight years ago,

91
0:05:47.065,000 --> 0:05:52,000
a very simple and profound observation changed my thinking.

92
0:05:53.425,000 --> 0:05:55,000
No one tells a child how to see,

93
0:05:56.11,000 --> 0:05:58,000
especially in the early years.

94
0:05:58.371,000 --> 0:06:03,000
They learn this through real-world experiences and examples.

95
0:06:03.371,000 --> 0:06:05,000
If you consider a child's eyes

96
0:06:06.111,000 --> 0:06:08,000
as a pair of biological cameras,

97
0:06:08.665,000 --> 0:06:12,000
they take one picture about every 200 milliseconds,

98
0:06:12.845,000 --> 0:06:15,000
the average time an eye movement is made.

99
0:06:15.979,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So by age three, a child would have seen hundreds of millions of pictures

100
0:06:21.529,000 --> 0:06:22,000
of the real world.

101
0:06:23.363,000 --> 0:06:25,000
That's a lot of training examples.

102
0:06:26.383,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So instead of focusing solely on better and better algorithms,

103
0:06:32.372,000 --> 0:06:37,000
my insight was to give the algorithms the kind of training data

104
0:06:37.644,000 --> 0:06:4,000
that a child was given through experiences

105
0:06:40.963,000 --> 0:06:43,000
in both quantity and quality.

106
0:06:44.841,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Once we know this,

107
0:06:46.699,000 --> 0:06:48,000
we knew we needed to collect a data set

108
0:06:49.67,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that has far more images than we have ever had before,

109
0:06:54.129,000 --> 0:06:56,000
perhaps thousands of times more,

110
0:06:56.706,000 --> 0:07:,000
and together with Professor Kai Li at Princeton University,

111
0:07:00.817,000 --> 0:07:04,000
we launched the ImageNet project in 2007.

112
0:07:05.569,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Luckily, we didn't have to mount a camera on our head

113
0:07:09.407,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and wait for many years.

114
0:07:11.171,000 --> 0:07:12,000
We went to the Internet,

115
0:07:12.634,000 --> 0:07:16,000
the biggest treasure trove of pictures that humans have ever created.

116
0:07:17.07,000 --> 0:07:2,000
We downloaded nearly a billion images

117
0:07:20.111,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and used crowdsourcing technology like the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform

118
0:07:25.991,000 --> 0:07:27,000
to help us to label these images.

119
0:07:28.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
At its peak, ImageNet was one of the biggest employers

120
0:07:33.23,000 --> 0:07:35,000
of the Amazon Mechanical Turk workers:

121
0:07:36.226,000 --> 0:07:39,000
together, almost 50,000 workers

122
0:07:40.08,000 --> 0:07:44,000
from 167 countries around the world

123
0:07:44.12,000 --> 0:07:47,000
helped us to clean, sort and label

124
0:07:48.067,000 --> 0:07:51,000
nearly a billion candidate images.

125
0:07:52.612,000 --> 0:07:54,000
That was how much effort it took

126
0:07:55.265,000 --> 0:07:58,000
to capture even a fraction of the imagery

127
0:07:59.165,000 --> 0:08:03,000
a child's mind takes in in the early developmental years.

128
0:08:04.148,000 --> 0:08:07,000
In hindsight, this idea of using big data

129
0:08:08.05,000 --> 0:08:12,000
to train computer algorithms may seem obvious now,

130
0:08:12.6,000 --> 0:08:16,000
but back in 2007, it was not so obvious.

131
0:08:16.71,000 --> 0:08:19,000
We were fairly alone on this journey for quite a while.

132
0:08:20.588,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Some very friendly colleagues advised me to do something more useful for my tenure,

133
0:08:25.591,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and we were constantly struggling for research funding.

134
0:08:29.933,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Once, I even joked to my graduate students

135
0:08:32.418,000 --> 0:08:36,000
that I would just reopen my dry cleaner's shop to fund ImageNet.

136
0:08:36.481,000 --> 0:08:4,000
After all, that's how I funded my college years.

137
0:08:41.242,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So we carried on.

138
0:08:43.098,000 --> 0:08:46,000
In 2009, the ImageNet project delivered

139
0:08:46.813,000 --> 0:08:5,000
a database of 15 million images

140
0:08:50.855,000 --> 0:08:54,000
across 22,000 classes of objects and things

141
0:08:55.66,000 --> 0:08:58,000
organized by everyday English words.

142
0:08:58.98,000 --> 0:09:,000
In both quantity and quality,

143
0:09:01.906,000 --> 0:09:03,000
this was an unprecedented scale.

144
0:09:04.878,000 --> 0:09:07,000
As an example, in the case of cats,

145
0:09:08.339,000 --> 0:09:1,000
we have more than 62,000 cats

146
0:09:11.148,000 --> 0:09:15,000
of all kinds of looks and poses

147
0:09:15.258,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and across all species of domestic and wild cats.

148
0:09:20.481,000 --> 0:09:23,000
We were thrilled to have put together ImageNet,

149
0:09:23.825,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and we wanted the whole research world to benefit from it,

150
0:09:27.563,000 --> 0:09:31,000
so in the TED fashion, we opened up the entire data set

151
0:09:31.604,000 --> 0:09:34,000
to the worldwide research community for free.

152
0:09:36.636,000 --> 0:09:4,000
(Applause)

153
0:09:41.416,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Now that we have the data to nourish our computer brain,

154
0:09:45.954,000 --> 0:09:48,000
we're ready to come back to the algorithms themselves.

155
0:09:49.691,000 --> 0:09:54,000
As it turned out, the wealth of information provided by ImageNet

156
0:09:54.869,000 --> 0:09:58,000
was a perfect match to a particular class of machine learning algorithms

157
0:09:59.675,000 --> 0:10:01,000
called convolutional neural network,

158
0:10:02.09,000 --> 0:10:07,000
pioneered by Kunihiko Fukushima, Geoff Hinton, and Yann LeCun

159
0:10:07.338,000 --> 0:10:1,000
back in the 1970s and '80s.

160
0:10:10.983,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Just like the brain consists of billions of highly connected neurons,

161
0:10:16.602,000 --> 0:10:19,000
a basic operating unit in a neural network

162
0:10:20.456,000 --> 0:10:22,000
is a neuron-like node.

163
0:10:22.871,000 --> 0:10:24,000
It takes input from other nodes

164
0:10:25.425,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and sends output to others.

165
0:10:28.143,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Moreover, these hundreds of thousands or even millions of nodes

166
0:10:32.856,000 --> 0:10:35,000
are organized in hierarchical layers,

167
0:10:36.083,000 --> 0:10:38,000
also similar to the brain.

168
0:10:38.637,000 --> 0:10:42,000
In a typical neural network we use to train our object recognition model,

169
0:10:43.42,000 --> 0:10:46,000
it has 24 million nodes,

170
0:10:46.601,000 --> 0:10:49,000
140 million parameters,

171
0:10:49.898,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and 15 billion connections.

172
0:10:52.661,000 --> 0:10:54,000
That's an enormous model.

173
0:10:55.076,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Powered by the massive data from ImageNet

174
0:10:58.977,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and the modern CPUs and GPUs to train such a humongous model,

175
0:11:04.41,000 --> 0:11:06,000
the convolutional neural network

176
0:11:06.779,000 --> 0:11:09,000
blossomed in a way that no one expected.

177
0:11:10.215,000 --> 0:11:12,000
It became the winning architecture

178
0:11:12.723,000 --> 0:11:17,000
to generate exciting new results in object recognition.

179
0:11:18.063,000 --> 0:11:2,000
This is a computer telling us

180
0:11:20.873,000 --> 0:11:22,000
this picture contains a cat

181
0:11:23.173,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and where the cat is.

182
0:11:25.076,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Of course there are more things than cats,

183
0:11:27.188,000 --> 0:11:29,000
so here's a computer algorithm telling us

184
0:11:29.626,000 --> 0:11:32,000
the picture contains a boy and a teddy bear;

185
0:11:32.9,000 --> 0:11:36,000
a dog, a person, and a small kite in the background;

186
0:11:37.266,000 --> 0:11:4,000
or a picture of very busy things

187
0:11:40.401,000 --> 0:11:44,000
like a man, a skateboard, railings, a lampost, and so on.

188
0:11:45.045,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Sometimes, when the computer is not so confident about what it sees,

189
0:11:51.498,000 --> 0:11:53,000
we have taught it to be smart enough

190
0:11:53.774,000 --> 0:11:56,000
to give us a safe answer instead of committing too much,

191
0:11:57.652,000 --> 0:11:59,000
just like we would do,

192
0:12:00.463,000 --> 0:12:04,000
but other times our computer algorithm is remarkable at telling us

193
0:12:05.129,000 --> 0:12:07,000
what exactly the objects are,

194
0:12:07.382,000 --> 0:12:1,000
like the make, model, year of the cars.

195
0:12:10.818,000 --> 0:12:15,000
We applied this algorithm to millions of Google Street View images

196
0:12:16.204,000 --> 0:12:19,000
across hundreds of American cities,

197
0:12:19.339,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and we have learned something really interesting:

198
0:12:22.265,000 --> 0:12:25,000
first, it confirmed our common wisdom

199
0:12:25.585,000 --> 0:12:28,000
that car prices correlate very well

200
0:12:28.875,000 --> 0:12:3,000
with household incomes.

201
0:12:31.22,000 --> 0:12:35,000
But surprisingly, car prices also correlate well

202
0:12:35.747,000 --> 0:12:37,000
with crime rates in cities,

203
0:12:39.007,000 --> 0:12:42,000
or voting patterns by zip codes.

204
0:12:44.06,000 --> 0:12:46,000
So wait a minute. Is that it?

205
0:12:46.266,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Has the computer already matched or even surpassed human capabilities?

206
0:12:51.419,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Not so fast.

207
0:12:53.557,000 --> 0:12:57,000
So far, we have just taught the computer to see objects.

208
0:12:58.48,000 --> 0:13:02,000
This is like a small child learning to utter a few nouns.

209
0:13:03.124,000 --> 0:13:05,000
It's an incredible accomplishment,

210
0:13:05.794,000 --> 0:13:07,000
but it's only the first step.

211
0:13:08.254,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Soon, another developmental milestone will be hit,

212
0:13:12.016,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and children begin to communicate in sentences.

213
0:13:15.477,000 --> 0:13:19,000
So instead of saying this is a cat in the picture,

214
0:13:19.701,000 --> 0:13:24,000
you already heard the little girl telling us this is a cat lying on a bed.

215
0:13:24.903,000 --> 0:13:29,000
So to teach a computer to see a picture and generate sentences,

216
0:13:30.498,000 --> 0:13:33,000
the marriage between big data and machine learning algorithm

217
0:13:34.446,000 --> 0:13:36,000
has to take another step.

218
0:13:36.721,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Now, the computer has to learn from both pictures

219
0:13:40.877,000 --> 0:13:42,000
as well as natural language sentences

220
0:13:43.733,000 --> 0:13:46,000
generated by humans.

221
0:13:47.055,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Just like the brain integrates vision and language,

222
0:13:50.908,000 --> 0:13:55,000
we developed a model that connects parts of visual things

223
0:13:56.109,000 --> 0:13:57,000
like visual snippets

224
0:13:58.013,000 --> 0:14:02,000
with words and phrases in sentences.

225
0:14:02.216,000 --> 0:14:04,000
About four months ago,

226
0:14:04.979,000 --> 0:14:06,000
we finally tied all this together

227
0:14:07.626,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and produced one of the first computer vision models

228
0:14:11.41,000 --> 0:14:14,000
that is capable of generating a human-like sentence

229
0:14:15.404,000 --> 0:14:18,000
when it sees a picture for the first time.

230
0:14:18.91,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Now, I'm ready to show you what the computer says

231
0:14:23.554,000 --> 0:14:24,000
when it sees the picture

232
0:14:25.529,000 --> 0:14:28,000
that the little girl saw at the beginning of this talk.

233
0:14:31.519,000 --> 0:14:34,000
(Video) Computer: A man is standing next to an elephant.

234
0:14:36.393,000 --> 0:14:39,000
A large airplane sitting on top of an airport runway.

235
0:14:41.057,000 --> 0:14:45,000
FFL: Of course, we're still working hard to improve our algorithms,

236
0:14:45.269,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and it still has a lot to learn.

237
0:14:47.865,000 --> 0:14:49,000
(Applause)

238
0:14:51.556,000 --> 0:14:54,000
And the computer still makes mistakes.

239
0:14:54.877,000 --> 0:14:57,000
(Video) Computer: A cat lying on a bed in a blanket.

240
0:14:58.268,000 --> 0:15:,000
FFL: So of course, when it sees too many cats,

241
0:15:00.821,000 --> 0:15:02,000
it thinks everything might look like a cat.

242
0:15:05.317,000 --> 0:15:07,000
(Video) Computer: A young boy is holding a baseball bat.

243
0:15:08.181,000 --> 0:15:09,000
(Laughter)

244
0:15:09.946,000 --> 0:15:13,000
FFL: Or, if it hasn't seen a toothbrush, it confuses it with a baseball bat.

245
0:15:15.309,000 --> 0:15:18,000
(Video) Computer: A man riding a horse down a street next to a building.

246
0:15:18.743,000 --> 0:15:2,000
(Laughter)

247
0:15:20.766,000 --> 0:15:23,000
FFL: We haven't taught Art 101 to the computers.

248
0:15:25.768,000 --> 0:15:27,000
(Video) Computer: A zebra standing in a field of grass.

249
0:15:28.652,000 --> 0:15:31,000
FFL: And it hasn't learned to appreciate the stunning beauty of nature

250
0:15:32.019,000 --> 0:15:34,000
like you and I do.

251
0:15:34.457,000 --> 0:15:36,000
So it has been a long journey.

252
0:15:37.289,000 --> 0:15:41,000
To get from age zero to three was hard.

253
0:15:41.515,000 --> 0:15:46,000
The real challenge is to go from three to 13 and far beyond.

254
0:15:47.111,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Let me remind you with this picture of the boy and the cake again.

255
0:15:51.476,000 --> 0:15:55,000
So far, we have taught the computer to see objects

256
0:15:55.54,000 --> 0:15:59,000
or even tell us a simple story when seeing a picture.

257
0:15:59.998,000 --> 0:16:02,000
(Video) Computer: A person sitting at a table with a cake.

258
0:16:03.574,000 --> 0:16:05,000
FFL: But there's so much more to this picture

259
0:16:06.204,000 --> 0:16:08,000
than just a person and a cake.

260
0:16:08.474,000 --> 0:16:12,000
What the computer doesn't see is that this is a special Italian cake

261
0:16:12.941,000 --> 0:16:15,000
that's only served during Easter time.

262
0:16:16.158,000 --> 0:16:19,000
The boy is wearing his favorite t-shirt

263
0:16:19.363,000 --> 0:16:22,000
given to him as a gift by his father after a trip to Sydney,

264
0:16:23.333,000 --> 0:16:26,000
and you and I can all tell how happy he is

265
0:16:27.141,000 --> 0:16:3,000
and what's exactly on his mind at that moment.

266
0:16:31.214,000 --> 0:16:34,000
This is my son Leo.

267
0:16:34.339,000 --> 0:16:36,000
On my quest for visual intelligence,

268
0:16:36.963,000 --> 0:16:38,000
I think of Leo constantly

269
0:16:39.354,000 --> 0:16:41,000
and the future world he will live in.

270
0:16:42.257,000 --> 0:16:44,000
When machines can see,

271
0:16:44.278,000 --> 0:16:48,000
doctors and nurses will have extra pairs of tireless eyes

272
0:16:48.99,000 --> 0:16:52,000
to help them to diagnose and take care of patients.

273
0:16:53.082,000 --> 0:16:57,000
Cars will run smarter and safer on the road.

274
0:16:57.465,000 --> 0:16:59,000
Robots, not just humans,

275
0:17:00.159,000 --> 0:17:04,000
will help us to brave the disaster zones to save the trapped and wounded.

276
0:17:05.798,000 --> 0:17:08,000
We will discover new species, better materials,

277
0:17:09.594,000 --> 0:17:13,000
and explore unseen frontiers with the help of the machines.

278
0:17:15.113,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Little by little, we're giving sight to the machines.

279
0:17:19.28,000 --> 0:17:21,000
First, we teach them to see.

280
0:17:22.078,000 --> 0:17:24,000
Then, they help us to see better.

281
0:17:24.841,000 --> 0:17:28,000
For the first time, human eyes won't be the only ones

282
0:17:29.006,000 --> 0:17:31,000
pondering and exploring our world.

283
0:17:31.94,000 --> 0:17:34,000
We will not only use the machines for their intelligence,

284
0:17:35.4,000 --> 0:17:41,000
we will also collaborate with them in ways that we cannot even imagine.

285
0:17:41.579,000 --> 0:17:43,000
This is my quest:

286
0:17:43.74,000 --> 0:17:45,000
to give computers visual intelligence

287
0:17:46.452,000 --> 0:17:51,000
and to create a better future for Leo and for the world.

288
0:17:51.583,000 --> 0:17:52,000
Thank you.

289
0:17:53.394,000 --> 0:17:56,000
(Applause)

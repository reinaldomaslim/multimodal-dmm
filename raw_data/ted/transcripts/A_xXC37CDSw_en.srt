1
0:00:12,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I recognized the roles that were placed on me very early.

2
0:00:17.932,000 --> 0:00:2,000
One persistent concept that I observed --

3
0:00:21.006,000 --> 0:00:23,000
existing in our language, in our media --

4
0:00:23.387,000 --> 0:00:27,000
was that women are not only supposed to have children,

5
0:00:29.34,000 --> 0:00:3,000
they are supposed to want to.

6
0:00:32.558,000 --> 0:00:33,000
This existed everywhere.

7
0:00:34.527,000 --> 0:00:38,000
It existed in the ways that adults spoke to me

8
0:00:38.576,000 --> 0:00:41,000
when they posed questions in the context of "when."

9
0:00:43.577,000 --> 0:00:44,000
"When you get married ..."

10
0:00:45.482,000 --> 0:00:46,000
"When you have kids ..."

11
0:00:48.806,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And these future musings were always presented to me

12
0:00:51.83,000 --> 0:00:53,000
like part of this American dream,

13
0:00:54.655,000 --> 0:00:56,000
but it always felt to me like someone else's dream.

14
0:00:57.368,000 --> 0:01:01,000
You see, a value that I have always understood about myself

15
0:01:01.623,000 --> 0:01:03,000
was that I never wanted children.

16
0:01:04.996,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And as a kid, when I would try to explain this,

17
0:01:08.861,000 --> 0:01:11,000
this disconnect between their roles and my values,

18
0:01:12.694,000 --> 0:01:13,000
they often laughed

19
0:01:14.334,000 --> 0:01:17,000
in the way that adults do at the absurdities of children.

20
0:01:18.77,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And they would tell me knowingly,

21
0:01:20.572,000 --> 0:01:21,000
"You'll change your mind."

22
0:01:23.782,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And people have been saying things like that to me my whole life.

23
0:01:27.406,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Otherwise polite conversation can turn intrusive fast.

24
0:01:33.366,000 --> 0:01:34,000
"Does your husband know?"

25
0:01:35.112,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:37.943,000 --> 0:01:38,000
"Do your parents know?"

27
0:01:39.316,000 --> 0:01:4,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:41.132,000 --> 0:01:42,000
"Don't you want a family?"

29
0:01:44.463,000 --> 0:01:46,000
"Don't you want to leave anything behind?"

30
0:01:48.106,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And the primary buzzword when discussing childlessness,

31
0:01:54.001,000 --> 0:01:55,000
"That's selfish."

32
0:01:59.252,000 --> 0:02:02,000
There are countless reasons a woman may have

33
0:02:02.609,000 --> 0:02:05,000
for choosing to abstain from motherhood,

34
0:02:05.729,000 --> 0:02:07,000
the majority of them not self-prioritizing.

35
0:02:10.094,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But it is still socially acceptable to publicly vilify women as such,

36
0:02:14.42,000 --> 0:02:17,000
because none of these reasons have made it into the social narrative.

37
0:02:18.482,000 --> 0:02:23,000
When I was little and learning about the inevitability of maternity,

38
0:02:24.189,000 --> 0:02:25,000
it was never explained to me

39
0:02:25.956,000 --> 0:02:29,000
the commonness of these factors that women consider,

40
0:02:31.718,000 --> 0:02:33,000
like the risk of passing on hereditary illness,

41
0:02:34.155,000 --> 0:02:37,000
the danger of having to stop life-saving medication

42
0:02:37.337,000 --> 0:02:38,000
for the duration of your pregnancy,

43
0:02:39.3,000 --> 0:02:41,000
concern about overpopulation,

44
0:02:41.452,000 --> 0:02:42,000
your access to resources,

45
0:02:44.269,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and the fact that there are 415,000 children

46
0:02:49.942,000 --> 0:02:52,000
in the foster-care system in the United States at any given time.

47
0:02:54.842,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Reasons like these, many more,

48
0:02:58.772,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and the fact that I don't like to leave things of this magnitude to chance,

49
0:03:03.748,000 --> 0:03:05,000
all informed my decision

50
0:03:06.13,000 --> 0:03:07,000
to become surgically sterilized.

51
0:03:09.023,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I began my research eagerly.

52
0:03:12.433,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I wanted to fully understand

53
0:03:14.048,000 --> 0:03:19,000
all that was going to come with undergoing a tubal ligation,

54
0:03:19.477,000 --> 0:03:21,000
which is just another word for getting your tubes tied.

55
0:03:22.809,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I wanted to know approval to aftermath,

56
0:03:26.163,000 --> 0:03:28,000
satisfaction rates, risks, statistics.

57
0:03:30.171,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And at first, I was empowered.

58
0:03:32.529,000 --> 0:03:35,000
You see, the way the narrative has always been taught to me,

59
0:03:36.275,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I would have thought that women who didn't want children were so rare,

60
0:03:40.567,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and then I learned one in five American women

61
0:03:44.37,000 --> 0:03:46,000
won't be having a biological child --

62
0:03:46.711,000 --> 0:03:48,000
some by choice, some by chance.

63
0:03:49.568,000 --> 0:03:5,000
(Applause)

64
0:03:50.781,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But I was not alone.

65
0:03:55.192,000 --> 0:03:57,000
But the more I read, the more disheartened I became.

66
0:03:57.931,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I read women's stories,

67
0:04:00.762,000 --> 0:04:02,000
trying desperately to get this procedure.

68
0:04:04.534,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I learned how common it was for women to exhaust their finances

69
0:04:10.953,000 --> 0:04:15,000
appealing to dozens of ob-gyns over many years,

70
0:04:17.921,000 --> 0:04:18,000
only to be turned down so many times,

71
0:04:19.807,000 --> 0:04:21,000
often with such blatant disrespect that they just gave up.

72
0:04:23.529,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Women reported that medical practitioners were often condescending

73
0:04:30.189,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and dismissive of their motivations,

74
0:04:34.236,000 --> 0:04:35,000
being told things like,

75
0:04:36.213,000 --> 0:04:38,000
"Come back when you're married with a child."

76
0:04:40.865,000 --> 0:04:43,000
But women who did have children, who went to go get this procedure,

77
0:04:44.877,000 --> 0:04:45,000
were told they were too young,

78
0:04:47.707,000 --> 0:04:5,000
or they didn't have enough children,

79
0:04:51.072,000 --> 0:04:52,000
which is very interesting,

80
0:04:53.049,000 --> 0:04:59,000
because the legal requirements in my state for getting this kind of surgery were,

81
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
"Be at least 21 years old,"

82
0:05:03.287,000 --> 0:05:05,000
"appear of sound mind, acting of your own accord,"

83
0:05:06.249,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and "have a 30-day waiting period."

84
0:05:10.345,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And I was perplexed that I could meet all of these legal requirements

85
0:05:16.067,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and still have to face a battle in the exam room

86
0:05:19.202,000 --> 0:05:2,000
for my bodily autonomy.

87
0:05:21.957,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And it was daunting,

88
0:05:24.468,000 --> 0:05:25,000
but I was determined.

89
0:05:26.664,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I remember I dressed so professionally to that first appointment.

90
0:05:31.988,000 --> 0:05:32,000
(Laughter)

91
0:05:33.189,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I sat up straight.

92
0:05:34.88,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I spoke clearly.

93
0:05:37.292,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I wanted to give that doctor every piece of evidence

94
0:05:42.189,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that I was not the date of birth in that file.

95
0:05:46.643,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And I made sure to mention things like,

96
0:05:49.148,000 --> 0:05:5,000
"I just got my bachelor's degree

97
0:05:50.863,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and I'm applying to these doctoral programs,

98
0:05:53.45,000 --> 0:05:54,000
I'm going to study these things."

99
0:05:55.405,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And "my long-term partner has this kind of business,"

100
0:05:59.567,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and "I've done research on this for months.

101
0:06:03.017,000 --> 0:06:05,000
I understand everything about it, all the risks."

102
0:06:06.615,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Because I needed the doctor to know that this was not a whim,

103
0:06:10.347,000 --> 0:06:11,000
not reactionary,

104
0:06:12.332,000 --> 0:06:15,000
not your 20-something looking to go out and party

105
0:06:15.808,000 --> 0:06:17,000
without fear of getting knocked up ...

106
0:06:17.952,000 --> 0:06:18,000
(Laughter)

107
0:06:19.944,000 --> 0:06:21,000
that this supported something integral to who I was.

108
0:06:25.237,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And I understand informed consent,

109
0:06:26.901,000 --> 0:06:32,000
so I fully expected to be reeducated on how it all worked, but ...

110
0:06:34.909,000 --> 0:06:38,000
At one point, the information being given to me started to feel agenda'd,

111
0:06:39.814,000 --> 0:06:44,000
interlaced with bias and inflated statistics.

112
0:06:45.603,000 --> 0:06:47,000
The questions began to feel interrogative.

113
0:06:49.885,000 --> 0:06:51,000
At first they were asking me questions

114
0:06:52.371,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that seemed to understand my situation better,

115
0:06:55.854,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and then it seemed like they were asking questions to try to trip me up.

116
0:06:59.291,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I felt like I was on the witness stand, being cross-examined.

117
0:07:04.651,000 --> 0:07:05,000
The doctor asked me about my partner.

118
0:07:07.029,000 --> 0:07:09,000
"How does he or she feel about all of this?"

119
0:07:10.46,000 --> 0:07:13,000
"Well, I've been with the same man for five years,

120
0:07:13.961,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and he fully supports any decision I make for my body."

121
0:07:17.139,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And he said, "Well, what happens in the future,

122
0:07:19.744,000 --> 0:07:2,000
if you change partners?

123
0:07:20.919,000 --> 0:07:22,000
What happens when that person wants children?"

124
0:07:24.767,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And I didn't quite know how to react to that,

125
0:07:28.943,000 --> 0:07:3,000
because what I was hearing

126
0:07:30.983,000 --> 0:07:36,000
was this doctor tell me that I'm supposed to disregard everything I believe

127
0:07:37.98,000 --> 0:07:39,000
if a partner demands children.

128
0:07:40.804,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So I told him not to worry about that.

129
0:07:43.988,000 --> 0:07:46,000
My stance on childbearing has always been first date conversation.

130
0:07:47.597,000 --> 0:07:53,000
(Laughter)

131
0:07:53.708,000 --> 0:07:54,000
(Cheering)

132
0:07:54.882,000 --> 0:07:57,000
(Laughter)

133
0:07:59.253,000 --> 0:08:01,000
He then asks me to consider

134
0:08:03.531,000 --> 0:08:07,000
how "in 20 years, you could really come to regret this" ...

135
0:08:08.848,000 --> 0:08:09,000
as though I hadn't.

136
0:08:11.654,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I told him,

137
0:08:16.156,000 --> 0:08:19,000
"OK, if I wake up one day

138
0:08:20.555,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and realize, you know,

139
0:08:23.627,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I wish I'd made a different decision back then,

140
0:08:28.856,000 --> 0:08:31,000
the truth is, I'd only removed a single path to parenthood.

141
0:08:32.973,000 --> 0:08:34,000
I never needed biology to form family anyway."

142
0:08:36.356,000 --> 0:08:43,000
(Applause)

143
0:08:44.892,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And I would much rather deal with that any day

144
0:08:48.701,000 --> 0:08:5,000
than deal with one day waking up,

145
0:08:51.694,000 --> 0:08:54,000
realize I'd had a child

146
0:08:55.688,000 --> 0:09:,000
that I didn't really want or was prepared to care for.

147
0:09:01.633,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Because one of these affects only me.

148
0:09:04.873,000 --> 0:09:06,000
The other affects a child,

149
0:09:07.364,000 --> 0:09:09,000
their development, their well-being --

150
0:09:09.674,000 --> 0:09:12,000
(Applause)

151
0:09:13.357,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and human beings are not to be gambled with.

152
0:09:18.058,000 --> 0:09:24,000
He then tells me why no one was going to approve this procedure,

153
0:09:24.109,000 --> 0:09:25,000
certainly not he,

154
0:09:25.648,000 --> 0:09:28,000
because of a concept called medical paternalism,

155
0:09:28.911,000 --> 0:09:33,000
which allows him, as my well-informed provider,

156
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:36,000
to make decisions for me ...

157
0:09:37.481,000 --> 0:09:39,000
based on his perception of my best interest,

158
0:09:40.318,000 --> 0:09:42,000
regardless of what I, as the patient, want or believe.

159
0:09:44.8,000 --> 0:09:46,000
He takes this opportunity to step out

160
0:09:47.809,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and discuss my case with my potential surgeon,

161
0:09:51.729,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and through the door, I hear him describe me as a little girl.

162
0:10:01.137,000 --> 0:10:02,000
I was so offended.

163
0:10:03.434,000 --> 0:10:04,000
I wanted to defend myself.

164
0:10:05.412,000 --> 0:10:09,000
I wanted to explicitly explain to each one of these providers

165
0:10:09.857,000 --> 0:10:1,000
how they were treating me,

166
0:10:11.201,000 --> 0:10:13,000
that it was belittling and sexist,

167
0:10:13.65,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and I didn't have to take it.

168
0:10:19.082,000 --> 0:10:2,000
But I did take it.

169
0:10:22.211,000 --> 0:10:24,000
I swallowed every sharp word in my throat,

170
0:10:26.501,000 --> 0:10:29,000
clenched my jaw, and instead

171
0:10:29.562,000 --> 0:10:34,000
answered each one of their condescending questions and statements.

172
0:10:36.595,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I had come here looking for objectivity and support

173
0:10:40.601,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and instead I felt dismissed and silenced,

174
0:10:44.692,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and I hated myself for it.

175
0:10:46.085,000 --> 0:10:5,000
I hated that I was letting people disrespect me repeatedly.

176
0:10:51.918,000 --> 0:10:52,000
But this was my one shot.

177
0:10:57.424,000 --> 0:11:01,000
That was one of multiple consultations that I had to go to.

178
0:11:02.967,000 --> 0:11:06,000
At one point, I had seen five or six medical professionals in the same hour.

179
0:11:07.891,000 --> 0:11:1,000
The door to the exam room felt more like the door to a clown car.

180
0:11:11.439,000 --> 0:11:12,000
There's my primary,

181
0:11:12.829,000 --> 0:11:13,000
there's his colleague,

182
0:11:14.661,000 --> 0:11:16,000
the director, OK.

183
0:11:17.178,000 --> 0:11:22,000
It felt like I was asking them to infect me with smallpox

184
0:11:22.598,000 --> 0:11:26,000
instead of, I don't know, obtain birth control.

185
0:11:28.787,000 --> 0:11:32,000
But I didn't waver,

186
0:11:33.153,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and I was persistent,

187
0:11:35.424,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and I eventually convinced one of them to allow the procedure.

188
0:11:42.79,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And even as I am in the room, signing the consent forms

189
0:11:48.084,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and getting the hormone shots and tying up loose ends ...

190
0:11:53.556,000 --> 0:11:56,000
my doctor is shaking his head in disapproval.

191
0:11:59.335,000 --> 0:12:,000
"You'll change your mind."

192
0:12:03.542,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I never really understood

193
0:12:06.805,000 --> 0:12:1,000
how strongly this society clings to this role

194
0:12:11.185,000 --> 0:12:12,000
until I went through this.

195
0:12:13.556,000 --> 0:12:19,000
I experienced firsthand, repeatedly,

196
0:12:20.908,000 --> 0:12:23,000
how people, be it medical providers,

197
0:12:26.175,000 --> 0:12:28,000
colleagues, strangers,

198
0:12:30.554,000 --> 0:12:35,000
were literally unable to separate me being a woman

199
0:12:37.261,000 --> 0:12:38,000
from me being a mother.

200
0:12:40.191,000 --> 0:12:44,000
And I've always believed that having children

201
0:12:44.804,000 --> 0:12:46,000
was an extension of womanhood, not the definition.

202
0:12:48.728,000 --> 0:12:5,000
I believe that a woman's value

203
0:12:51.428,000 --> 0:12:55,000
should never be determined by whether or not she has a child,

204
0:12:55.934,000 --> 0:12:59,000
because that strips her of her entire identity

205
0:13:00.102,000 --> 0:13:01,000
as an adult unto herself.

206
0:13:02.492,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Women have this amazing ability to create life,

207
0:13:07.185,000 --> 0:13:09,000
but when we say that that is her purpose,

208
0:13:11.414,000 --> 0:13:15,000
that says that her entire existence is a means to an end.

209
0:13:20.995,000 --> 0:13:24,000
It's so easy to forget the roles that society places on us

210
0:13:25.175,000 --> 0:13:27,000
are so much more than mere titles.

211
0:13:27.432,000 --> 0:13:29,000
What about the weight that comes with them,

212
0:13:30.02,000 --> 0:13:32,000
the pressure to conform to these standards ...

213
0:13:33.169,000 --> 0:13:35,000
the fear associated with questioning them,

214
0:13:36.375,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and the desires that we cast aside to accept them?

215
0:13:40.841,000 --> 0:13:42,000
There are many paths to happiness and fulfillment.

216
0:13:44.222,000 --> 0:13:45,000
They all look very different,

217
0:13:46.217,000 --> 0:13:5,000
but I believe that every one

218
0:13:50.964,000 --> 0:13:52,000
is paved with the right to self-determination.

219
0:13:57.951,000 --> 0:14:03,000
I want women to know that your choice to embrace or forego motherhood

220
0:14:06.546,000 --> 0:14:09,000
is not in any way tied to your worthiness or identity

221
0:14:10.341,000 --> 0:14:14,000
as spouses, as adults, or as women ...

222
0:14:15.82,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and there absolutely is a choice behind maternity,

223
0:14:20.182,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and it is yours

224
0:14:22.008,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and yours alone.

225
0:14:23.645,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Thank you.

226
0:14:24.82,000 --> 0:14:31,000
(Applause)

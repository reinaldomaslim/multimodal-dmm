1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I grew up in Europe, and World War II caught me

2
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
when I was between seven and 10 years old.

3
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And I realized how few of the grown-ups that I knew

4
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
were able to withstand the tragedies that the war visited on them --

5
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
how few of them could even resemble a normal, contented,

6
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
satisfied, happy life once their job, their home, their security

7
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
was destroyed by the war.

8
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
So I became interested in understanding

9
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
what contributed to a life that was worth living.

10
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And I tried, as a child, as a teenager, to read philosophy

11
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and to get involved in art and religion and many other ways

12
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that I could see as a possible answer to that question.

13
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And finally I ended up encountering psychology by chance.

14
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I was at a ski resort in Switzerland without any money

15
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
to actually enjoy myself, because the snow had melted and

16
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I didn't have money to go to a movie. But I found that on the --

17
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I read in the newspapers that there was to be a presentation

18
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
by someone in a place that I'd seen in the center of Zurich,

19
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and it was about flying saucers [that] he was going to talk.

20
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And I thought, well, since I can't go to the movies,

21
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
at least I will go for free to listen to flying saucers.

22
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And the man who talked at that evening lecture was very interesting.

23
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Instead of talking about little green men,

24
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
he talked about how the psyche of the Europeans

25
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
had been traumatized by the war, and now they're projecting

26
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
flying saucers into the sky.

27
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
He talked about how the mandalas of ancient Hindu religion

28
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
were kind of projected into the sky as an attempt to regain

29
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
some sense of order after the chaos of war.

30
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And this seemed very interesting to me.

31
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And I started reading his books after that lecture.

32
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And that was Carl Jung, whose name or work I had no idea about.

33
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Then I came to this country to study psychology

34
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and I started trying to understand the roots of happiness.

35
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
This is a typical result that many people have presented,

36
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and there are many variations on it.

37
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
But this, for instance, shows that about 30 percent of the people

38
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
surveyed in the United States since 1956

39
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
say that their life is very happy.

40
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And that hasn't changed at all.

41
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Whereas the personal income,

42
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
on a scale that has been held constant to accommodate for inflation,

43
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
has more than doubled, almost tripled, in that period.

44
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
But you find essentially the same results,

45
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
namely, that after a certain basic point -- which corresponds more or less

46
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
to just a few 1,000 dollars above the minimum poverty level --

47
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
increases in material well-being don't seem to affect how happy people are.

48
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
In fact, you can find that the lack of basic resources,

49
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
material resources, contributes to unhappiness,

50
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
but the increase in material resources does not increase happiness.

51
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So my research has been focused more on --

52
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
after finding out these things that actually corresponded

53
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
to my own experience, I tried to understand:

54
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
where -- in everyday life, in our normal experience --

55
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
do we feel really happy?

56
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And to start

57
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
those studies about 40 years ago, I began to look at creative people --

58
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
first artists and scientists, and so forth -- trying to understand

59
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
what made them feel that it was worth essentially spending their life

60
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
doing things for which many of them didn't expect either fame or fortune,

61
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
but which made their life meaningful and worth doing.

62
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
This was one of the leading composers of American music back in the '70s.

63
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And the interview was 40 pages long.

64
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
But this little excerpt is a very good summary

65
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
of what he was saying during the interview.

66
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And it describes how he feels when composing is going well.

67
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And he says by describing it as an ecstatic state.

68
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Now, "ecstasy" in Greek meant

69
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
simply to stand to the side of something.

70
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And then it became essentially an analogy for a mental state

71
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
where you feel that you are not doing your ordinary everyday routines.

72
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So ecstasy is essentially a stepping into an alternative reality.

73
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And it's interesting, if you think about it, how, when we think about

74
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement --

75
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
whether it's China, Greece, the Hindu civilization,

76
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
or the Mayas, or Egyptians -- what we know about them

77
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
is really about their ecstasies, not about their everyday life.

78
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
We know the temples they built, where people could come

79
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
to experience a different reality.

80
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
We know about the circuses,

81
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
the arenas, the theaters.

82
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
These are the remains of civilizations and they are the places that people went

83
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
to experience life in a more concentrated, more ordered form.

84
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Now, this man doesn't need to go to a place like this,

85
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
which is also -- this place, this arena, which is built

86
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
like a Greek amphitheatre, is a place for ecstasy also.

87
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
We are participating in a reality that is different

88
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
from that of the everyday life that we're used to.

89
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
But this man doesn't need to go there.

90
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
He needs just a piece of paper where he can put down little marks,

91
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and as he does that, he can imagine sounds

92
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that had not existed before in that particular combination.

93
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So once he gets to that point of beginning to create,

94
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
like Jennifer did in her improvisation,

95
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
a new reality -- that is, a moment of ecstasy --

96
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
he enters that different reality.

97
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Now he says also that this is so intense an experience

98
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that it feels almost as if he didn't exist.

99
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And that sounds like a kind of a romantic exaggeration.

100
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
But actually, our nervous system is incapable of processing

101
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
more than about 110 bits of information per second.

102
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And in order to hear me and understand what I'm saying,

103
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
you need to process about 60 bits per second.

104
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
That's why you can't hear more than two people.

105
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
You can't understand more than two people talking to you.

106
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Well, when you are really involved in this completely engaging process

107
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
of creating something new, as this man is,

108
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
he doesn't have enough attention left over to monitor

109
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
how his body feels, or his problems at home.

110
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
He can't feel even that he's hungry or tired.

111
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
His body disappears,

112
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
his identity disappears from his consciousness,

113
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
because he doesn't have enough attention, like none of us do,

114
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
to really do well something that requires a lot of concentration,

115
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and at the same time to feel that he exists.

116
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
So existence is temporarily suspended.

117
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself.

118
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Now, I could look at my hand for two weeks, and I wouldn't feel

119
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
any awe or wonder, because I can't compose. (Laughter)

120
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So what it's telling you here

121
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
is that obviously this automatic,

122
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
spontaneous process that he's describing can only happen to someone

123
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
who is very well trained and who has developed technique.

124
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity

125
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
that you can't be creating anything with less than 10 years

126
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
of technical-knowledge immersion in a particular field.

127
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Whether it's mathematics or music, it takes that long

128
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
to be able to begin to change something in a way that it's better

129
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
than what was there before.

130
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Now, when that happens,

131
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
he says the music just flows out.

132
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And because all of these people I started interviewing --

133
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
this was an interview which is over 30 years old --

134
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
so many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow

135
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
that I called this type of experience the "flow experience."

136
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And it happens in different realms.

137
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
For instance, a poet describes it in this form.

138
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
This is by a student of mine who interviewed

139
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
some of the leading writers and poets in the United States.

140
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And it describes the same effortless, spontaneous feeling

141
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state.

142
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
This poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky --

143
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
a very similar description to what Albert Einstein gave

144
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
as to how he imagined the forces of relativity,

145
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked.

146
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
But it happens in other activities.

147
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
For instance, this is another student of mine,

148
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Susan Jackson from Australia, who did work

149
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
with some of the leading athletes in the world.

150
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And you see here in this description of an Olympic skater,

151
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
the same essential description of the phenomenology

152
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
of the inner state of the person.

153
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
You don't think; it goes automatically,

154
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
if you merge yourself with the music, and so forth.

155
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
It happens also, actually, in the most recent book I wrote,

156
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
called "Good Business," where I interviewed some of the CEOs

157
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
who had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful

158
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and very ethical, very socially responsible.

159
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
You see that these people define success

160
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
as something that helps others and at the same time

161
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
makes you feel happy as you are working at it.

162
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And like all of these successful and responsible CEOs say,

163
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
you can't have just one of these things be successful

164
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
if you want a meaningful and successful job.

165
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Anita Roddick is another one of these CEOs we interviewed.

166
0:13:10.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
She is the founder of Body Shop,

167
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
the natural cosmetics king.

168
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
It's kind of a passion that comes

169
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
from doing the best and having flow while you're working.

170
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
This is an interesting little quote from Masaru Ibuka,

171
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
who was at that time starting out Sony without any money,

172
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
without a product -- they didn't have a product,

173
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
they didn't have anything, but they had an idea.

174
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And the idea he had was to establish a place of work where engineers

175
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
can feel the joy of technological innovation,

176
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
be aware of their mission to society and work to their heart's content.

177
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
I couldn't improve on this as a good example

178
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
of how flow enters the workplace.

179
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
Now, when we do studies --

180
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
we have, with other colleagues around the world,

181
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
done over 8,000 interviews of people -- from Dominican monks,

182
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
to blind nuns, to Himalayan climbers, to Navajo shepherds --

183
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
who enjoy their work.

184
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And regardless of the culture,

185
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
regardless of education or whatever, there are these seven conditions

186
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
that seem to be there when a person is in flow.

187
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
There's this focus that, once it becomes intense,

188
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
leads to a sense of ecstasy, a sense of clarity:

189
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:42,000
you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other;

190
0:14:42.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
you get immediate feedback.

191
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
You know that what you need to do

192
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
is possible to do, even though difficult,

193
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and sense of time disappears, you forget yourself,

194
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
you feel part of something larger.

195
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
And once the conditions are present,

196
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
what you are doing becomes worth doing for its own sake.

197
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
In our studies, we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme.

198
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
And we can measure this very precisely, actually,

199
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
because we give people electronic pagers that go off 10 times a day,

200
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
and whenever they go off you say what you're doing, how you feel,

201
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
where you are, what you're thinking about.

202
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And two things that we measure is the amount of challenge

203
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
people experience at that moment and the amount of skill

204
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
that they feel they have at that moment.

205
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
So for each person we can establish an average,

206
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:4,000
which is the center of the diagram.

207
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
That would be your mean level of challenge and skill,

208
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
which will be different from that of anybody else.

209
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
But you have a kind of a set point there, which would be in the middle.

210
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:53,000
If we know what that set point is,

211
0:15:53.16,000 --> 0:15:58,000
we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow,

212
0:15:58.16,000 --> 0:16:01,000
and it will be when your challenges are higher than average

213
0:16:01.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and skills are higher than average.

214
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
And you may be doing things very differently from other people,

215
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
but for everyone that flow channel, that area there,

216
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
will be when you are doing what you really like to do --

217
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:21,000
play the piano, be with your best friend, perhaps work,

218
0:16:21.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
if work is what provides flow for you.

219
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
And then the other areas become less and less positive.

220
0:16:29.16,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Arousal is still good because you are over-challenged there.

221
0:16:34.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
Your skills are not quite as high as they should be,

222
0:16:36.16,000 --> 0:16:39,000
but you can move into flow fairly easily

223
0:16:39.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
by just developing a little more skill.

224
0:16:42.16,000 --> 0:16:46,000
So, arousal is the area where most people learn from,

225
0:16:46.16,000 --> 0:16:52,000
because that's where they're pushed beyond their comfort zone

226
0:16:52.16,000 --> 0:16:55,000
and to enter that -- going back to flow --

227
0:16:55.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
then they develop higher skills.

228
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:17:01,000
Control is also a good place to be,

229
0:17:01.16,000 --> 0:17:05,000
because there you feel comfortable, but not very excited.

230
0:17:05.16,000 --> 0:17:08,000
It's not very challenging any more.

231
0:17:08.16,000 --> 0:17:1,000
And if you want to enter flow from control,

232
0:17:10.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
you have to increase the challenges.

233
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
So those two are ideal and complementary areas

234
0:17:17.16,000 --> 0:17:21,000
from which flow is easy to go into.

235
0:17:21.16,000 --> 0:17:24,000
The other combinations of challenge and skill

236
0:17:24.16,000 --> 0:17:27,000
become progressively less optimal.

237
0:17:27.16,000 --> 0:17:29,000
Relaxation is fine -- you still feel OK.

238
0:17:29.16,000 --> 0:17:34,000
Boredom begins to be very aversive

239
0:17:34.16,000 --> 0:17:38,000
and apathy becomes very negative:

240
0:17:38.16,000 --> 0:17:42,000
you don't feel that you're doing anything,

241
0:17:42.16,000 --> 0:17:44,000
you don't use your skills, there's no challenge.

242
0:17:44.16,000 --> 0:17:49,000
Unfortunately, a lot of people's experience is in apathy.

243
0:17:49.16,000 --> 0:17:56,000
The largest single contributor to that experience

244
0:17:56.16,000 --> 0:18:02,000
is watching television; the next one is being in the bathroom, sitting.

245
0:18:02.16,000 --> 0:18:08,000
Even though sometimes watching television

246
0:18:08.16,000 --> 0:18:12,000
about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow,

247
0:18:12.16,000 --> 0:18:15,000
but that's when you choose a program you really want to watch

248
0:18:15.16,000 --> 0:18:18,000
and you get feedback from it.

249
0:18:18.16,000 --> 0:18:24,000
So the question we are trying to address -- and I'm way over time --

250
0:18:24.16,000 --> 0:18:3,000
is how to put more and more of everyday life in that flow channel.

251
0:18:30.16,000 --> 0:18:35,000
And that is the kind of challenge that we're trying to understand.

252
0:18:35.16,000 --> 0:18:38,000
And some of you obviously know how to do that spontaneously

253
0:18:38.16,000 --> 0:18:42,000
without any advice, but unfortunately a lot of people don't.

254
0:18:42.16,000 --> 0:18:48,000
And that's what our mandate is, in a way, to do.

255
0:18:48.16,000 --> 0:18:49,000
Thank you.

256
0:18:49.16,000 --> 0:18:5,000
(Applause)

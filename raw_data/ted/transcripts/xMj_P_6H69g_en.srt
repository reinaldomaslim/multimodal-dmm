(Breathes in)

0:00:27.644,000 --> 0:00:28,000
(Breathes out)

4
0:00:33.274,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So, I didn't always make my living from music.

5
0:00:37.123,000 --> 0:00:39,000
For about the five years after graduating

6
0:00:39.147,000 --> 0:00:42,000
from an upstanding liberal arts university,

7
0:00:42.276,000 --> 0:00:44,000
this was my day job.

8
0:00:45.131,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:46.363,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I was a self-employed living statue called the Eight-Foot Bride,

10
0:00:50.931,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and I love telling people I did this for a job,

11
0:00:54.671,000 --> 0:00:55,000
because everybody always wants to know,

12
0:00:56.656,000 --> 0:00:57,000
who are these freaks in real life.

13
0:00:58.635,000 --> 0:00:59,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:59.66,000 --> 0:01:,000
Hello.

15
0:01:01.152,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I painted myself white one day, stood on a box,

16
0:01:04.331,000 --> 0:01:06,000
put a hat or a can at my feet,

17
0:01:06.739,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and when someone came by and dropped in money,

18
0:01:09.09,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I handed them a flower --

19
0:01:13.171,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and some intense eye contact.

20
0:01:17.247,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And if they didn't take the flower,

21
0:01:18.971,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I threw in a gesture of sadness and longing --

22
0:01:23.017,000 --> 0:01:24,000
as they walked away.

23
0:01:27.201,000 --> 0:01:28,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:30.905,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So I had the most profound encounters with people,

25
0:01:34.895,000 --> 0:01:35,000
especially lonely people

26
0:01:36.23,000 --> 0:01:39,000
who looked like they hadn't talked to anyone in weeks,

27
0:01:39.579,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and we would get this beautiful moment of prolonged eye contact

28
0:01:45.572,000 --> 0:01:47,000
being allowed in a city street,

29
0:01:47.889,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and we would sort of fall in love a little bit.

30
0:01:51.201,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And my eyes would say --

31
0:01:53.693,000 --> 0:01:54,000
"Thank you.

32
0:01:55.288,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I see you."

33
0:01:57.185,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And their eyes would say --

34
0:02:00.589,000 --> 0:02:01,000
"Nobody ever sees me.

35
0:02:03.161,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Thank you."

36
0:02:06.168,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I would get harassed sometimes.

37
0:02:07.677,000 --> 0:02:09,000
People would yell at me from their cars.

38
0:02:09.765,000 --> 0:02:1,000
"Get a job!"

39
0:02:11.407,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Laughing) And I'd be, like,

40
0:02:13.471,000 --> 0:02:14,000
"This is my job."

41
0:02:15.301,000 --> 0:02:18,000
But it hurt, because it made me fear

42
0:02:19.034,000 --> 0:02:23,000
that I was somehow doing something un-joblike

43
0:02:23.292,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and unfair, shameful.

44
0:02:26.406,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I had no idea how perfect a real education I was getting

45
0:02:31.279,000 --> 0:02:33,000
for the music business on this box.

46
0:02:34.015,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And for the economists out there,

47
0:02:35.611,000 --> 0:02:38,000
you may be interested to know I actually made a pretty predictable income,

48
0:02:39.216,000 --> 0:02:43,000
which was shocking to me, given I had no regular customers,

49
0:02:43.431,000 --> 0:02:46,000
but pretty much 60 bucks on a Tuesday, 90 bucks on a Friday.

50
0:02:46.719,000 --> 0:02:47,000
It was consistent.

51
0:02:48.004,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And meanwhile, I was touring locally and playing in nightclubs

52
0:02:51.488,000 --> 0:02:52,000
with my band, the Dresden Dolls.

53
0:02:53.35,000 --> 0:02:55,000
This was me on piano, a genius drummer.

54
0:02:55.448,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I wrote the songs, and eventually

55
0:02:57.361,000 --> 0:03:01,000
we started making enough money that I could quit being a statue,

56
0:03:01.747,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and as we started touring,

57
0:03:04.008,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I really didn't want to lose this sense

58
0:03:06.382,000 --> 0:03:08,000
of direct connection with people, because I loved it.

59
0:03:09.082,000 --> 0:03:12,000
So after all of our shows, we would sign autographs

60
0:03:13.037,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and hug fans and hang out and talk to people,

61
0:03:15.949,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and we made an art out of asking people to help us and join us,

62
0:03:21.641,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and I would track down local musicians and artists

63
0:03:24.787,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and they would set up outside of our shows,

64
0:03:27.979,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and they would pass the hat,

65
0:03:29.467,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and then they would come in and join us onstage,

66
0:03:31.967,000 --> 0:03:34,000
so we had this rotating smorgasbord of weird, random circus guests.

67
0:03:35.975,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And then Twitter came along,

68
0:03:38.48,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and made things even more magic,

69
0:03:40.536,000 --> 0:03:42,000
because I could ask instantly for anything anywhere.

70
0:03:43.295,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So I would need a piano to practice on,

71
0:03:45.36,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and an hour later I would be at a fan's house.

72
0:03:47.653,000 --> 0:03:48,000
This is in London.

73
0:03:49.094,000 --> 0:03:51,000
People would bring home-cooked food to us

74
0:03:51.198,000 --> 0:03:53,000
all over the world backstage and feed us and eat with us.

75
0:03:53.937,000 --> 0:03:54,000
This is in Seattle.

76
0:03:55.343,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Fans who worked in museums and stores

77
0:03:58.97,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and any kind of public space would wave their hands

78
0:04:02.177,000 --> 0:04:05,000
if I would decide to do a last-minute, spontaneous, free gig.

79
0:04:05.441,000 --> 0:04:07,000
This is a library in Auckland.

80
0:04:08.864,000 --> 0:04:12,000
On Saturday I tweeted for this crate and hat,

81
0:04:13.341,000 --> 0:04:15,000
because I did not want to schlep them from the East Coast,

82
0:04:16.124,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and they showed up care of this dude, Chris, from Newport Beach,

83
0:04:19.171,000 --> 0:04:2,000
who says hello.

84
0:04:20.904,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I once tweeted, "Where in Melbourne can I buy a neti pot?"

85
0:04:24.61,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And a nurse from a hospital drove one

86
0:04:27.14,000 --> 0:04:29,000
right at that moment to the cafe I was in,

87
0:04:29.411,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and I bought her a smoothie

88
0:04:30.879,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and we sat there talking about nursing and death.

89
0:04:33.443,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And I love this kind of random closeness,

90
0:04:36.498,000 --> 0:04:39,000
which is lucky, because I do a lot of couchsurfing.

91
0:04:41.188,000 --> 0:04:44,000
In mansions where everyone in my crew gets their own room

92
0:04:44.302,000 --> 0:04:45,000
but there's no wireless,

93
0:04:45.579,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and in punk squats,

94
0:04:47.135,000 --> 0:04:49,000
everyone on the floor in one room with no toilets

95
0:04:50.097,000 --> 0:04:52,000
but with wireless, clearly making it the better option.

96
0:04:53.914,000 --> 0:04:54,000
(Laughter)

97
0:04:56.259,000 --> 0:05:02,000
My crew once pulled our van up to a really poor Miami neighborhood

98
0:05:02.349,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and we found out that our couchsurfing host for the night

99
0:05:05.055,000 --> 0:05:07,000
was an 18-year-old girl, still living at home,

100
0:05:07.642,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and her family were all undocumented immigrants from Honduras.

101
0:05:12.266,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And that night, her whole family

102
0:05:15.666,000 --> 0:05:18,000
took the couches and she slept together with her mom

103
0:05:18.743,000 --> 0:05:19,000
so that we could take their beds.

104
0:05:21.298,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And I lay there thinking,

105
0:05:24.139,000 --> 0:05:25,000
these people have so little.

106
0:05:26.933,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Is this fair?

107
0:05:29.033,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And in the morning,

108
0:05:30.37,000 --> 0:05:32,000
her mom taught us how to try to make tortillas

109
0:05:32.717,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and wanted to give me a Bible,

110
0:05:34.718,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and she took me aside and she said to me in her broken English,

111
0:05:40.311,000 --> 0:05:44,000
"Your music has helped my daughter so much.

112
0:05:45.844,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Thank you for staying here. We're all so grateful."

113
0:05:49.154,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And I thought, this is fair.

114
0:05:53.438,000 --> 0:05:55,000
This is this.

115
0:05:56.565,000 --> 0:05:58,000
A couple of months later, I was in Manhattan,

116
0:05:59.509,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and I tweeted for a crash pad, and at midnight,

117
0:06:01.797,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I'm on the Lower East Side,

118
0:06:03.599,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and it occurs to me I've never actually done this alone.

119
0:06:06.392,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I've always been with my band or my crew.

120
0:06:08.369,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Is this what stupid people do?

121
0:06:10.674,000 --> 0:06:11,000
(Laughter)

122
0:06:12.205,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Is this how stupid people die?

123
0:06:14.604,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And before I can change my mind, the door busts open.

124
0:06:17.153,000 --> 0:06:18,000
She's an artist.

125
0:06:18.208,000 --> 0:06:2,000
He's a financial blogger for Reuters,

126
0:06:20.552,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and they're pouring me a glass of red wine

127
0:06:22.59,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and offering me a bath,

128
0:06:23.761,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and I have had thousands of nights like that and like that.

129
0:06:29.07,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So I couchsurf a lot. I also crowdsurf a lot.

130
0:06:33.108,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing

131
0:06:36.069,000 --> 0:06:37,000
are basically the same thing.

132
0:06:38.317,000 --> 0:06:4,000
You're falling into the audience

133
0:06:40.822,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and you're trusting each other.

134
0:06:42.689,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I once asked an opening band of mine

135
0:06:44.977,000 --> 0:06:46,000
if they wanted to go out into the crowd and pass the hat

136
0:06:47.668,000 --> 0:06:49,000
to get some extra money, something that I did a lot.

137
0:06:50.382,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And as usual, the band was psyched,

138
0:06:52.194,000 --> 0:06:54,000
but there was this one guy in the band

139
0:06:54.392,000 --> 0:06:57,000
who told me he just couldn't bring himself to go out there.

140
0:06:58.274,000 --> 0:07:01,000
It felt too much like begging to stand there with the hat.

141
0:07:02.468,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And I recognized his fear

142
0:07:06.112,000 --> 0:07:08,000
of "Is this fair?"

143
0:07:08.225,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and "Get a job."

144
0:07:11.016,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And meanwhile, my band is becoming bigger and bigger.

145
0:07:14.116,000 --> 0:07:15,000
We sign with a major label.

146
0:07:16.271,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And our music is a cross between punk and cabaret.

147
0:07:19.209,000 --> 0:07:2,000
It's not for everybody.

148
0:07:20.615,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Well, maybe it's for you.

149
0:07:23.066,000 --> 0:07:25,000
(Laughter)

150
0:07:25.174,000 --> 0:07:28,000
We sign, and there's all this hype leading up to our next record.

151
0:07:28.994,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And it comes out and it sells about 25,000 copies

152
0:07:32.687,000 --> 0:07:33,000
in the first few weeks,

153
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and the label considers this a failure.

154
0:07:37.968,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I was like, "25,000, isn't that a lot?"

155
0:07:39.881,000 --> 0:07:4,000
They said, "No, the sales are going down.

156
0:07:41.873,000 --> 0:07:42,000
It's a failure."

157
0:07:42.913,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And they walk off.

158
0:07:44.838,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Right at this same time, I'm signing and hugging after a gig,

159
0:07:48.222,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and a guy comes up to me

160
0:07:50.013,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and hands me a $10 bill,

161
0:07:52.215,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and he says,

162
0:07:53.896,000 --> 0:07:55,000
"I'm sorry, I burned your CD from a friend."

163
0:07:56.738,000 --> 0:07:59,000
(Laughter)

164
0:08:01.579,000 --> 0:08:03,000
"But I read your blog, I know you hate your label.

165
0:08:04.111,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I just want you to have this money."

166
0:08:06.991,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And this starts happening all the time.

167
0:08:10.485,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I become the hat after my own gigs,

168
0:08:13.95,000 --> 0:08:16,000
but I have to physically stand there and take the help from people,

169
0:08:17.236,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and unlike the guy in the opening band,

170
0:08:19.445,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I've actually had a lot of practice standing there.

171
0:08:24.033,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Thank you.

172
0:08:25.591,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And this is the moment I decide

173
0:08:27.742,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I'm just going to give away my music for free

174
0:08:30.634,000 --> 0:08:31,000
online whenever possible,

175
0:08:32.366,000 --> 0:08:35,000
so it's like Metallica over here, Napster, bad;

176
0:08:35.852,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Amanda Palmer over here,

177
0:08:37.542,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and I'm going to encourage torrenting, downloading, sharing,

178
0:08:40.841,000 --> 0:08:42,000
but I'm going to ask for help,

179
0:08:42.963,000 --> 0:08:44,000
because I saw it work on the street.

180
0:08:46.259,000 --> 0:08:48,000
So I fought my way off my label, and for my next project

181
0:08:49.187,000 --> 0:08:51,000
with my new band, the Grand Theft Orchestra,

182
0:08:51.891,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I turned to crowdfunding.

183
0:08:54.619,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And I fell into those thousands of connections that I'd made,

184
0:08:58.787,000 --> 0:09:,000
and I asked my crowd to catch me.

185
0:09:02.052,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And the goal was 100,000 dollars.

186
0:09:04.918,000 --> 0:09:07,000
My fans backed me at nearly 1.2 million,

187
0:09:08.457,000 --> 0:09:1,000
which was the biggest music crowdfunding project to date.

188
0:09:11.363,000 --> 0:09:15,000
(Applause)

189
0:09:15.451,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And you can see how many people it is.

190
0:09:20.118,000 --> 0:09:21,000
It's about 25,000 people.

191
0:09:23.499,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And the media asked,

192
0:09:24.993,000 --> 0:09:27,000
"Amanda, the music business is tanking and you encourage piracy.

193
0:09:28.471,000 --> 0:09:3,000
How did you make all these people pay for music?"

194
0:09:30.829,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And the real answer is, I didn't make them.

195
0:09:33.658,000 --> 0:09:34,000
I asked them.

196
0:09:35.518,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And through the very act of asking people,

197
0:09:39.38,000 --> 0:09:4,000
I'd connected with them,

198
0:09:41.096,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and when you connect with them, people want to help you.

199
0:09:46.255,000 --> 0:09:49,000
It's kind of counterintuitive for a lot of artists.

200
0:09:50.025,000 --> 0:09:51,000
They don't want to ask for things.

201
0:09:51.715,000 --> 0:09:54,000
But it's not easy.

202
0:09:55.392,000 --> 0:09:56,000
It's not easy to ask.

203
0:09:57.376,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And a lot of artists have a problem with this.

204
0:09:59.582,000 --> 0:10:,000
Asking makes you vulnerable.

205
0:10:01.873,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And I got a lot of criticism online,

206
0:10:06.421,000 --> 0:10:07,000
after my Kickstarter went big,

207
0:10:08.042,000 --> 0:10:1,000
for continuing my crazy crowdsourcing practices,

208
0:10:11.001,000 --> 0:10:13,000
specifically for asking musicians

209
0:10:13.882,000 --> 0:10:15,000
who are fans if they wanted to join us on stage

210
0:10:16.255,000 --> 0:10:2,000
for a few songs in exchange for love and tickets and beer,

211
0:10:20.57,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and this was a doctored image that went up of me on a website.

212
0:10:25.602,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And this hurt in a really familiar way.

213
0:10:29.216,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And people saying,

214
0:10:30.942,000 --> 0:10:33,000
"You're not allowed anymore to ask for that kind of help,"

215
0:10:33.995,000 --> 0:10:37,000
really reminded me of the people in their cars yelling, "Get a job."

216
0:10:39.109,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Because they weren't with us on the sidewalk,

217
0:10:43.236,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and they couldn't see the exchange

218
0:10:46.493,000 --> 0:10:48,000
that was happening between me and my crowd,

219
0:10:48.565,000 --> 0:10:52,000
an exchange that was very fair to us but alien to them.

220
0:10:54.208,000 --> 0:10:56,000
So this is slightly not safe for work.

221
0:10:56.255,000 --> 0:10:58,000
This is my Kickstarter backer party in Berlin.

222
0:10:58.842,000 --> 0:11:01,000
At the end of the night, I stripped and let everyone draw on me.

223
0:11:01.899,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Now let me tell you, if you want to experience

224
0:11:04.916,000 --> 0:11:06,000
the visceral feeling of trusting strangers --

225
0:11:07.411,000 --> 0:11:08,000
(Laughter)

226
0:11:08.882,000 --> 0:11:09,000
I recommend this,

227
0:11:10.097,000 --> 0:11:13,000
especially if those strangers are drunk German people.

228
0:11:13.464,000 --> 0:11:14,000
(Laughter)

229
0:11:15.399,000 --> 0:11:18,000
This was a ninja master-level fan connection,

230
0:11:19.243,000 --> 0:11:21,000
because what I was really saying here was,

231
0:11:21.763,000 --> 0:11:22,000
I trust you this much.

232
0:11:24.355,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Should I?

233
0:11:26.244,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Show me.

234
0:11:28.483,000 --> 0:11:3,000
For most of human history,

235
0:11:30.519,000 --> 0:11:34,000
musicians, artists, they've been part of the community.

236
0:11:35.877,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Connectors and openers, not untouchable stars.

237
0:11:40.094,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Celebrity is about a lot of people loving you from a distance,

238
0:11:44.436,000 --> 0:11:45,000
but the Internet

239
0:11:45.605,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and the content that we're freely able to share on it

240
0:11:49.23,000 --> 0:11:51,000
are taking us back.

241
0:11:52.004,000 --> 0:11:55,000
It's about a few people loving you up close

242
0:11:55.712,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and about those people being enough.

243
0:12:00.263,000 --> 0:12:02,000
So a lot of people are confused by the idea

244
0:12:02.414,000 --> 0:12:03,000
of no hard sticker price.

245
0:12:03.729,000 --> 0:12:06,000
They see it as an unpredictable risk, but the things I've done,

246
0:12:06.951,000 --> 0:12:08,000
the Kickstarter, the street, the doorbell,

247
0:12:09.363,000 --> 0:12:1,000
I don't see these things as risk.

248
0:12:11.217,000 --> 0:12:12,000
I see them as trust.

249
0:12:13.335,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Now, the online tools

250
0:12:15.353,000 --> 0:12:19,000
to make the exchange as easy and as instinctive as the street,

251
0:12:20.125,000 --> 0:12:21,000
they're getting there.

252
0:12:21.863,000 --> 0:12:24,000
But the perfect tools aren't going to help us

253
0:12:25.462,000 --> 0:12:27,000
if we can't face each other

254
0:12:27.93,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and give and receive fearlessly,

255
0:12:30.989,000 --> 0:12:31,000
but, more important --

256
0:12:33.891,000 --> 0:12:35,000
to ask without shame.

257
0:12:37.225,000 --> 0:12:39,000
My music career has been spent

258
0:12:39.86,000 --> 0:12:43,000
trying to encounter people on the Internet the way I could on the box.

259
0:12:45.263,000 --> 0:12:48,000
So blogging and tweeting not just about my tour dates

260
0:12:48.775,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and my new video but about our work and our art

261
0:12:52.366,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and our fears and our hangovers,

262
0:12:55.507,000 --> 0:12:56,000
our mistakes,

263
0:12:56.949,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and we see each other.

264
0:12:59.2,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And I think when we really see each other,

265
0:13:02.818,000 --> 0:13:03,000
we want to help each other.

266
0:13:07.023,000 --> 0:13:1,000
I think people have been obsessed with the wrong question,

267
0:13:10.186,000 --> 0:13:12,000
which is, "How do we make people pay for music?"

268
0:13:14.082,000 --> 0:13:16,000
What if we started asking,

269
0:13:16.91,000 --> 0:13:18,000
"How do we let people pay for music?"

270
0:13:21.792,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Thank you.

271
0:13:22.96,000 --> 0:13:27,000
(Applause)

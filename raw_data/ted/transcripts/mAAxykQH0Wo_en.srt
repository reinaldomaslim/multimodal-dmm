1
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Space,

2
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
we all know what it looks like.

3
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
We've been surrounded by images of space

4
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
our whole lives,

5
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
from the speculative images

6
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
of science fiction

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
to the inspirational visions of artists

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
to the increasingly beautiful pictures

9
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
made possible by complex technologies.

10
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
But whilst we have

11
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
an overwhelmingly vivid

12
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
visual understanding of space,

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
we have no sense of what space sounds like.

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And indeed, most people associate space with silence.

15
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
But the story of how

16
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
we came to understand the universe

17
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
is just as much a story of listening

18
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
as it is by looking.

19
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And yet despite this,

20
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
hardly any of us have ever heard space.

21
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
How many of you here

22
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
could describe the sound

23
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
of a single planet or star?

24
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Well in case you've ever wondered,

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
this is what the Sun sounds like.

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
(Static)

27
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Crackling)

28
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
(Static)

29
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
(Crackling)

30
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
This is the planet Jupiter.

31
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
(Soft crackling)

32
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And this is the space probe Cassini

33
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
pirouetting through the ice rings of Saturn.

34
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
(Crackling)

35
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
This is a a highly condensed clump

36
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
of neutral matter,

37
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
spinning in the distant universe.

38
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
(Tapping)

39
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So my artistic practice

40
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
is all about listening

41
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
to the weird and wonderful noises

42
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
emitted by the magnificent celestial objects

43
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that make up our universe.

44
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And you may wonder,

45
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
how do we know what these sounds are?

46
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
How can we tell the difference

47
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
between the sound of the Sun

48
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and the sound of a pulsar?

49
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Well the answer

50
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
is the science of radio astronomy.

51
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Radio astronomers

52
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
study radio waves from space

53
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
using sensitive antennas and receivers,

54
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
which give them precise information

55
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
about what an astronomical object is

56
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and where it is in our night sky.

57
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And just like the signals

58
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
that we send and receive here on Earth,

59
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
we can convert these transmissions into sound

60
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
using simple analog techniques.

61
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And therefore, it's through listening

62
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
that we've come to uncover

63
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
some of the universe's most important secrets --

64
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
its scale, what it's made of

65
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and even how old it is.

66
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So today, I'm going to tell you a short story

67
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
of the history of the universe through listening.

68
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
It's punctuated

69
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
by three quick anecdotes,

70
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
which show how accidental encounters

71
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
with strange noises

72
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
gave us some of the most important information

73
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
we have about space.

74
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Now this story doesn't start

75
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
with vast telescopes

76
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
or futuristic spacecraft,

77
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
but a rather more humble technology --

78
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and in fact, the very medium

79
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
which gave us the telecommunications revolution

80
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that we're all part of today:

81
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
the telephone.

82
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
It's 1876, it's in Boston,

83
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and this is Alexander Graham Bell

84
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
who was working with Thomas Watson

85
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
on the invention of the telephone.

86
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
A key part of their technical set up

87
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
was a half-mile long length of wire,

88
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
which was thrown across the rooftops

89
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
of several houses in Boston.

90
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
The line carried the telephone signals

91
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that would later make Bell a household name.

92
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
But like any long length of charged wire,

93
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
it also inadvertently became

94
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
an antenna.

95
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Thomas Watson

96
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
spent hours listening

97
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
to the strange crackles and hisses

98
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and chirps and whistles

99
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that his accidental antenna detected.

100
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Now you have to remember,

101
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
this is 10 years before

102
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Heinrich Hertz proved the existence of radio waves --

103
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
15 years before Nikola Tesla's four-tuned circuit --

104
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
nearly 20 years before Marconi's first broadcast.

105
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So Thomas Watson wasn't listening to us.

106
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
We didn't have the technology

107
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
to transmit.

108
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So what were these strange noises?

109
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
Watson was in fact listening

110
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
to very low-frequency radio emissions

111
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
caused by nature.

112
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Some of the crackles and pops were lightning,

113
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
but the eerie whistles

114
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and curiously melodious chirps

115
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
had a rather more exotic origin.

116
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Using the very first telephone,

117
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Watson was in fact

118
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
dialed into the heavens.

119
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
As he correctly guessed,

120
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
some of these sounds were caused

121
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
by activity on the surface of the Sun.

122
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
It was a solar wind

123
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
interacting with our ionosphere

124
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
that he was listening to --

125
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
a phenomena which we can see

126
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
at the extreme northern and southern latitudes of our planet

127
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
as the aurora.

128
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So whilst inventing the technology

129
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
that would usher in the telecommunications revolution,

130
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Watson had discovered

131
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that the star at the center of our solar system

132
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
emitted powerful radio waves.

133
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
He had accidentally been the first person

134
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
to tune in to them.

135
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Fast-forward 50 years,

136
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and Bell and Watson's technology

137
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
has completely transformed

138
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
global communications.

139
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
But going from slinging some wire

140
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
across rooftops in Boston

141
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
to laying thousands and thousands of miles of cable

142
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
on the Atlantic Ocean seabed

143
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
is no easy matter.

144
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And so before long,

145
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Bell were looking to new technologies

146
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
to optimize their revolution.

147
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Radio could carry sound without wires.

148
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
But the medium is lossy --

149
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
it's subject to a lot of noise and interference.

150
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So Bell employed an engineer

151
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
to study those noises,

152
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
to try and find out where they came from,

153
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
with a view towards building

154
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
the perfect hardware codec, which would get rid of them

155
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
so they could think about using radio

156
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
for the purposes of telephony.

157
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Most of the noises

158
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
that the engineer, Karl Jansky, investigated

159
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
were fairly prosaic in origin.

160
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
They turned out to be lightning

161
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
or sources of electrical power.

162
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
But there was one persistent noise

163
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
that Jansky couldn't identify,

164
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and it seemed to appear

165
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
in his radio headset

166
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
four minutes earlier each day.

167
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Now any astronomer will tell you,

168
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
this is the telltale sign

169
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
of something that doesn't originate from Earth.

170
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Jansky had made a historic discovery,

171
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
that celestial objects could emit radio waves

172
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
as well as light waves.

173
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Fifty years on

174
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
from Watson's accidental encounter with the Sun,

175
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Jansky's careful listening

176
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
ushered in a new age of space exploration:

177
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
the radio astronomy age.

178
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Over the next few years,

179
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
astronomers connected up their antennas to loudspeakers

180
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and learned about our radio sky,

181
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
about Jupiter and the Sun,

182
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
by listening.

183
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
Let's jump ahead again.

184
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
It's 1964,

185
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and we're back at Bell Labs.

186
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And once again,

187
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
two scientists have got a problem with noise.

188
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson

189
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
were using the horn antenna

190
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
at Bell's Holmdel laboratory

191
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
to study the Milky Way

192
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
with extraordinary precision.

193
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
They were really listening

194
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
to the galaxy in high fidelity.

195
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
There was a glitch in their soundtrack.

196
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
A mysterious persistent noise

197
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
was disrupting their research.

198
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
It was in the microwave range,

199
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and it appeared to be coming

200
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
from all directions simultaneously.

201
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Now this didn't make any sense,

202
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and like any reasonable engineer or scientist,

203
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
they assumed that the problem must be the technology itself,

204
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
it must be the dish.

205
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
There were pigeons roosting in the dish.

206
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And so perhaps once they cleaned up the pigeon droppings,

207
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
get the disk kind of operational again,

208
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
normal operations would resume.

209
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
But the noise didn't disappear.

210
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
The mysterious noise

211
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
that Penzias and Wilson were listening to

212
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
turned out to be the oldest and most significant sound

213
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that anyone had ever heard.

214
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
It was cosmic radiation

215
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
left over from the very birth of the universe.

216
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
This was the first experimental evidence

217
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
that the Big Bang existed

218
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and the universe was born at a precise moment

219
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
some 14.7 billion years ago.

220
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
So our story ends

221
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
at the beginning --

222
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
the beginning of all things, the Big Bang.

223
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
This is the noise that Penzias and Wilson heard --

224
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
the oldest sound that you're ever going to hear,

225
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
the cosmic microwave background radiation

226
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
left over from the Big Bang.

227
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
(Fuzz)

228
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Thanks.

229
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Thank you. It's really an honor and a privilege to be here

2
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:33,000
spending my last day as a teenager.

3
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Today I want to talk to you about the future, but

4
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:4,000
first I'm going to tell you a bit about the past.

5
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:44,000
My story starts way before I was born.

6
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:48,000
My grandmother was on a train to Auschwitz, the death camp.

7
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And she was going along the tracks, and the tracks split.

8
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And somehow -- we don't really know exactly the whole story -- but

9
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:03,000
the train took the wrong track and went to a work camp rather than the death camp.

10
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:08,000
My grandmother survived and married my grandfather.

11
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:11,000
They were living in Hungary, and my mother was born.

12
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And when my mother was two years old,

13
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:18,000
the Hungarian revolution was raging, and they decided to escape Hungary.

14
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:22,000
They got on a boat, and yet another divergence --

15
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:25,000
the boat was either going to Canada or to Australia.

16
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:29,000
They got on and didn't know where they were going, and ended up in Canada.

17
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So, to make a long story short, they came to Canada.

18
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:36,000
My grandmother was a chemist. She worked at the Banting Institute in Toronto,

19
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and at 44 she died of stomach cancer. I never met my grandmother,

20
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:48,000
but I carry on her name -- her exact name, Eva Vertes --

21
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and I like to think I carry on her scientific passion, too.

22
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I found this passion not far from here, actually, when I was nine years old.

23
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:03,000
My family was on a road trip and we were in the Grand Canyon.

24
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And I had never been a reader when I was young --

25
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:09,000
my dad had tried me with the Hardy Boys; I tried Nancy Drew;

26
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I tried all that -- and I just didn't like reading books.

27
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And my mother bought this book when we were at the Grand Canyon

28
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:2,000
called "The Hot Zone." It was all about the outbreak of the Ebola virus.

29
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And something about it just kind of drew me towards it.

30
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:26,000
There was this big sort of bumpy-looking virus on the cover,

31
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and I just wanted to read it. I picked up that book,

32
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and as we drove from the edge of the Grand Canyon

33
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
to Big Sur, and to, actually, here where we are today, in Monterey,

34
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I read that book, and from when I was reading that book,

35
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I knew that I wanted to have a life in medicine.

36
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I wanted to be like the explorers I'd read about in the book,

37
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:49,000
who went into the jungles of Africa,

38
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:51,000
went into the research labs and just tried to figure out

39
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:57,000
what this deadly virus was. So from that moment on, I read every medical book

40
0:02:57,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I could get my hands on, and I just loved it so much.

41
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I was a passive observer of the medical world.

42
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It wasn't until I entered high school that I thought,

43
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:12,000
"Maybe now, you know -- being a big high school kid --

44
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I can maybe become an active part of this big medical world."

45
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I was 14, and I emailed professors at the local university

46
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:27,000
to see if maybe I could go work in their lab. And hardly anyone responded.

47
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:31,000
But I mean, why would they respond to a 14-year-old, anyway?

48
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And I got to go talk to one professor, Dr. Jacobs,

49
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:38,000
who accepted me into the lab.

50
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:41,000
At that time, I was really interested in neuroscience

51
0:03:41,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and wanted to do a research project in neurology --

52
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:49,000
specifically looking at the effects of heavy metals on the developing nervous system.

53
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So I started that, and worked in his lab for a year,

54
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and found the results that I guess you'd expect to find

55
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:03,000
when you feed fruit flies heavy metals -- that it really, really impaired the nervous system.

56
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:07,000
The spinal cord had breaks. The neurons were crossing in every which way.

57
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And from then I wanted to look not at impairment, but at prevention of impairment.

58
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So that's what led me to Alzheimer's. I started reading about Alzheimer's

59
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and tried to familiarize myself with the research,

60
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and at the same time when I was in the --

61
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I was reading in the medical library one day, and I read this article

62
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
about something called "purine derivatives."

63
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And they seemed to have cell growth-promoting properties.

64
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And being naive about the whole field, I kind of thought,

65
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:38,000
"Oh, you have cell death in Alzheimer's

66
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:43,000
which is causing the memory deficit, and then you have this compound --

67
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:45,000
purine derivatives -- that are promoting cell growth."

68
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And so I thought, "Maybe if it can promote cell growth,

69
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:5,000
it can inhibit cell death, too."

70
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And so that's the project that I pursued for that year,

71
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and it's continuing now as well,

72
0:04:56,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and found that a specific purine derivative called "guanidine"

73
0:05:01,000 --> 0:05:04,000
had inhibited the cell growth by approximately 60 percent.

74
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So I presented those results at the International Science Fair,

75
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:12,000
which was just one of the most amazing experiences of my life.

76
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And there I was awarded "Best in the World in Medicine,"

77
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:22,000
which allowed me to get in, or at least get a foot in the door of the big medical world.

78
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And from then on, since I was now in this huge exciting world,

79
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I wanted to explore it all. I wanted it all at once, but knew I couldn't really get that.

80
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And I stumbled across something called "cancer stem cells."

81
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And this is really what I want to talk to you about today -- about cancer.

82
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:43,000
At first when I heard of cancer stem cells,

83
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I didn't really know how to put the two together. I'd heard of stem cells,

84
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and I'd heard of them as the panacea of the future --

85
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:53,000
the therapy of many diseases to come in the future, perhaps.

86
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:57,000
But I'd heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time,

87
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:01,000
so how did the good and bad go together?

88
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Last summer I worked at Stanford University, doing some research on cancer stem cells.

89
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And while I was doing this, I was reading the cancer literature,

90
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:15,000
trying to -- again -- familiarize myself with this new medical field.

91
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And it seemed that tumors actually begin from a stem cell.

92
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:3,000
This fascinated me. The more I read, the more I looked at cancer differently

93
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and almost became less fearful of it.

94
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
It seems that cancer is a direct result to injury.

95
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:43,000
If you smoke, you damage your lung tissue, and then lung cancer arises.

96
0:06:43,000 --> 0:06:48,000
If you drink, you damage your liver, and then liver cancer occurs.

97
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And it was really interesting -- there were articles correlating

98
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:54,000
if you have a bone fracture, and then bone cancer arises.

99
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Because what stem cells are -- they're these

100
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:02,000
phenomenal cells that really have the ability to differentiate

101
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:04,000
into any type of tissue.

102
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So, if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ

103
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and then it's initiating cancer, it's almost as if this is a repair response.

104
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And the cancer, the body is saying the lung tissue is damaged,

105
0:07:19,000 --> 0:07:23,000
we need to repair the lung. And cancer is originating in the lung

106
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:27,000
trying to repair -- because you have this excessive proliferation

107
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:32,000
of these remarkable cells that really have the potential to become lung tissue.

108
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:36,000
But it's almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response,

109
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:38,000
but can't quite control it.

110
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:43,000
It hasn't yet become fine-tuned enough to finish what has been initiated.

111
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So this really, really fascinated me.

112
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And I really think that we can't think about cancer --

113
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:54,000
let alone any disease -- in such black-and-white terms.

114
0:07:54,000 --> 0:08:,000
If we eliminate cancer the way we're trying to do now, with chemotherapy and radiation,

115
0:08:,000 --> 0:08:05,000
we're bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins, or with radiation, trying to kill it.

116
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:08,000
It's almost as if we're getting back to this starting point.

117
0:08:08,000 --> 0:08:13,000
We're removing the cancer cells, but we're revealing the previous damage

118
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:15,000
that the body has tried to fix.

119
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Shouldn't we think about manipulation, rather than elimination?

120
0:08:2,000 --> 0:08:24,000
If somehow we can cause these cells to differentiate --

121
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:27,000
to become bone tissue, lung tissue, liver tissue,

122
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:3,000
whatever that cancer has been put there to do --

123
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:39,000
it would be a repair process. We'd end up better than we were before cancer.

124
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So, this really changed my view of looking at cancer.

125
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And while I was reading all these articles about cancer,

126
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:5,000
it seemed that the articles -- a lot of them -- focused on, you know,

127
0:08:5,000 --> 0:08:52,000
the genetics of breast cancer, and the genesis

128
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and the progression of breast cancer --

129
0:08:54,000 --> 0:09:,000
tracking the cancer through the body, tracing where it is, where it goes.

130
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:05,000
But it struck me that I'd never heard of cancer of the heart,

131
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:08,000
or cancer of any skeletal muscle for that matter.

132
0:09:08,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And skeletal muscle constitutes 50 percent of our body,

133
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:17,000
or over 50 percent of our body. And so at first I kind of thought,

134
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:19,000
"Well, maybe there's some obvious explanation

135
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:23,000
why skeletal muscle doesn't get cancer -- at least not that I know of."

136
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:28,000
So, I looked further into it, found as many articles as I could,

137
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and it was amazing -- because it turned out that it was very rare.

138
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Some articles even went as far as to say that skeletal muscle tissue

139
0:09:36,000 --> 0:09:41,000
is resistant to cancer, and furthermore, not only to cancer,

140
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:45,000
but of metastases going to skeletal muscle.

141
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And what metastases are is when the tumor --

142
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:51,000
when a piece -- breaks off and travels through the blood stream

143
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and goes to a different organ. That's what a metastasis is.

144
0:09:55,000 --> 0:09:58,000
It's the part of cancer that is the most dangerous.

145
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:01,000
If cancer was localized, we could likely remove it,

146
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:05,000
or somehow -- you know, it's contained. It's very contained.

147
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:08,000
But once it starts moving throughout the body, that's when it becomes deadly.

148
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:13,000
So the fact that not only did cancer not seem to originate in skeletal muscles,

149
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:16,000
but cancer didn't seem to go to skeletal muscle --

150
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
there seemed to be something here.

151
0:10:18,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So these articles were saying, you know, "Skeletal --

152
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:23,000
metastasis to skeletal muscle -- is very rare."

153
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:27,000
But it was left at that. No one seemed to be asking why.

154
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:34,000
So I decided to ask why. At first -- the first thing I did

155
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:36,000
was I emailed some professors who

156
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:39,000
specialized in skeletal muscle physiology, and pretty much said,

157
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:45,000
"Hey, it seems like cancer doesn't really go to skeletal muscle.

158
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Is there a reason for this?" And a lot of the replies I got were that

159
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:53,000
muscle is terminally differentiated tissue.

160
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Meaning that you have muscle cells, but they're not dividing,

161
0:10:56,000 --> 0:11:,000
so it doesn't seem like a good target for cancer to hijack.

162
0:11:,000 --> 0:11:03,000
But then again, this fact that the metastases

163
0:11:03,000 --> 0:11:07,000
didn't go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely.

164
0:11:07,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And furthermore, that nervous tissue -- brain -- gets cancer,

165
0:11:12,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and brain cells are also terminally differentiated.

166
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So I decided to ask why. And here's some of, I guess, my hypotheses

167
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:3,000
that I'll be starting to investigate this May at the Sylvester Cancer Institute in Miami.

168
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And I guess I'll keep investigating until I get the answers.

169
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:38,000
But I know that in science, once you get the answers,

170
0:11:38,000 --> 0:11:4,000
inevitably you're going to have more questions.

171
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:45,000
So I guess you could say that I'll probably be doing this for the rest of my life.

172
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Some of my hypotheses are that

173
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:51,000
when you first think about skeletal muscle,

174
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:54,000
there's a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle.

175
0:11:54,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And the first thing that makes me think is that

176
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:01,000
blood vessels are like highways for the tumor cells.

177
0:12:01,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels.

178
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And you think, the more highways there are in a tissue,

179
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:11,000
the more likely it is to get cancer or to get metastases.

180
0:12:11,000 --> 0:12:14,000
So first of all I thought, you know, "Wouldn't it be favorable

181
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:17,000
to cancer getting to skeletal muscle?" And as well,

182
0:12:17,000 --> 0:12:22,000
cancer tumors require a process called angiogenesis,

183
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:26,000
which is really, the tumor recruits the blood vessels to itself

184
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
to supply itself with nutrients so it can grow.

185
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Without angiogenesis, the tumor remains the size of a pinpoint and it's not harmful.

186
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:42,000
So angiogenesis is really a central process to the pathogenesis of cancer.

187
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And one article that really stood out to me

188
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:49,000
when I was just reading about this, trying to figure out why cancer doesn't go to skeletal

189
0:12:49,000 --> 0:12:56,000
muscle, was that it had reported 16 percent of micro-metastases

190
0:12:56,000 --> 0:12:58,000
to skeletal muscle upon autopsy.

191
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:03,000
16 percent! Meaning that there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle,

192
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:08,000
but only .16 percent of actual metastases --

193
0:13:08,000 --> 0:13:14,000
suggesting that maybe skeletal muscle is able to control the angiogenesis,

194
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:19,000
is able to control the tumors recruiting these blood vessels.

195
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:24,000
We use skeletal muscles so much. It's the one portion of our body --

196
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:27,000
our heart's always beating. We're always moving our muscles.

197
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Is it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows

198
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:35,000
that it needs this blood supply? It needs to be constantly contracting,

199
0:13:35,000 --> 0:13:38,000
so therefore it's almost selfish. It's grabbing its blood vessels for itself.

200
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Therefore, when a tumor comes into skeletal muscle tissue,

201
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:45,000
it can't get a blood supply, and can't grow.

202
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:5,000
So this suggests that maybe if there is an anti-angiogenic factor

203
0:13:5,000 --> 0:13:52,000
in skeletal muscle -- or perhaps even more,

204
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:57,000
an angiogenic routing factor, so it can actually direct where the blood vessels grow --

205
0:13:57,000 --> 0:14:01,000
this could be a potential future therapy for cancer.

206
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And another thing that's really interesting is that

207
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:1,000
there's this whole -- the way tumors move throughout the body,

208
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:14,000
it's a very complex system -- and there's something called the chemokine network.

209
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And chemokines are essentially chemical attractants,

210
0:14:18,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and they're the stop and go signals for cancer.

211
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:26,000
So a tumor expresses chemokine receptors,

212
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
and another organ -- a distant organ somewhere in the body --

213
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:31,000
will have the corresponding chemokines,

214
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it.

215
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Is it possible that skeletal muscle doesn't express this type of molecules?

216
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And the other really interesting thing is that

217
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:47,000
when skeletal muscle -- there's been several reports that when skeletal

218
0:14:47,000 --> 0:14:54,000
muscle is injured, that's what correlates with metastases going to skeletal muscle.

219
0:14:54,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And, furthermore, when skeletal muscle is injured,

220
0:14:57,000 --> 0:15:01,000
that's what causes chemokines -- these signals saying,

221
0:15:01,000 --> 0:15:05,000
"Cancer, you can come to me," the "go signs" for the tumors --

222
0:15:05,000 --> 0:15:09,000
it causes them to highly express these chemokines.

223
0:15:09,000 --> 0:15:16,000
So, there's so much interplay here.

224
0:15:16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
I mean, there are so many possibilities

225
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:21,000
for why tumors don't go to skeletal muscle.

226
0:15:21,000 --> 0:15:25,000
But it seems like by investigating, by attacking cancer,

227
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:29,000
by searching where cancer is not, there has got to be something --

228
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:35,000
there's got to be something -- that's making this tissue resistant to tumors.

229
0:15:35,000 --> 0:15:38,000
And can we utilize -- can we take this property,

230
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:42,000
this compound, this receptor, whatever it is that's controlling these

231
0:15:42,000 --> 0:15:49,000
anti-tumor properties and apply it to cancer therapy in general?

232
0:15:49,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Now, one thing that kind of ties the resistance of skeletal muscle to cancer --

233
0:15:57,000 --> 0:16:02,000
to the cancer as a repair response gone out of control in the body --

234
0:16:02,000 --> 0:16:1,000
is that skeletal muscle has a factor in it called "MyoD."

235
0:16:1,000 --> 0:16:15,000
And what MyoD essentially does is, it causes cells to differentiate

236
0:16:15,000 --> 0:16:2,000
into muscle cells. So this compound, MyoD,

237
0:16:2,000 --> 0:16:24,000
has been tested on a lot of different cell types and been shown to

238
0:16:24,000 --> 0:16:28,000
actually convert this variety of cell types into skeletal muscle cells.

239
0:16:28,000 --> 0:16:34,000
So, is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skeletal muscle tissue,

240
0:16:34,000 --> 0:16:38,000
but once in contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue,

241
0:16:38,000 --> 0:16:43,000
MyoD acts upon these tumor cells and causes them

242
0:16:43,000 --> 0:16:46,000
to become skeletal muscle cells?

243
0:16:46,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Maybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells,

244
0:16:49,000 --> 0:16:54,000
and this is why it seems as if it is so rare.

245
0:16:54,000 --> 0:16:57,000
It's not harmful; it has just repaired the muscle.

246
0:16:57,000 --> 0:17:,000
Muscle is constantly being used -- constantly being damaged.

247
0:17:,000 --> 0:17:03,000
If every time we tore a muscle

248
0:17:03,000 --> 0:17:06,000
or every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way,

249
0:17:06,000 --> 0:17:13,000
cancer occurred -- I mean, everybody would have cancer almost.

250
0:17:13,000 --> 0:17:17,000
And I hate to say that. But it seems as though muscle cell,

251
0:17:17,000 --> 0:17:2,000
possibly because of all its use, has adapted

252
0:17:2,000 --> 0:17:23,000
faster than other body tissues to respond to injury,

253
0:17:23,000 --> 0:17:29,000
to fine-tune this repair response and actually be able to finish the process

254
0:17:29,000 --> 0:17:34,000
which the body wants to finish. I really believe that the human body is very,

255
0:17:34,000 --> 0:17:4,000
very smart, and we can't counteract something the body is saying to do.

256
0:17:4,000 --> 0:17:43,000
It's different when a bacteria comes into the body --

257
0:17:43,000 --> 0:17:47,000
that's a foreign object -- we want that out.

258
0:17:47,000 --> 0:17:49,000
But when the body is actually initiating a process

259
0:17:49,000 --> 0:17:53,000
and we're calling it a disease, it doesn't seem as though elimination is

260
0:17:53,000 --> 0:18:01,000
the right solution. So even to go from there, it's possible, although far-fetched,

261
0:18:01,000 --> 0:18:08,000
that in the future we could almost think of cancer being used as a therapy.

262
0:18:08,000 --> 0:18:11,000
If those diseases where tissues are deteriorating --

263
0:18:11,000 --> 0:18:16,000
for example Alzheimer's, where the brain, the brain cells, die

264
0:18:16,000 --> 0:18:2,000
and we need to restore new brain cells, new functional brain cells --

265
0:18:2,000 --> 0:18:24,000
what if we could, in the future, use cancer? A tumor --

266
0:18:24,000 --> 0:18:29,000
put it in the brain and cause it to differentiate into brain cells?

267
0:18:29,000 --> 0:18:35,000
That's a very far-fetched idea, but I really believe that it may be possible.

268
0:18:35,000 --> 0:18:39,000
These cells are so versatile, these cancer cells are so versatile --

269
0:18:39,000 --> 0:18:42,000
we just have to manipulate them in the right way.

270
0:18:42,000 --> 0:18:46,000
And again, some of these may be far-fetched, but

271
0:18:46,000 --> 0:18:51,000
I figured if there's anywhere to present far-fetched ideas, it's here at TED, so

272
0:18:51,000 --> 0:18:53,000
thank you very much.

273
0:18:53,000 --> 0:18:56,000

0:00:15.752,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Life is about opportunities -- creating them and embracing them.

3
0:00:20.982,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And for me, that was the Olympic dream.

4
0:00:24.093,000 --> 0:00:26,000
That's what defined me. That was my bliss.

5
0:00:27.771,000 --> 0:00:3,000
As a cross-country skier and member of the Australian ski team

6
0:00:30.961,000 --> 0:00:32,000
headed towards the Winter Olympics,

7
0:00:33.092,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I was on a training bike ride with my fellow teammates.

8
0:00:37.196,000 --> 0:00:4,000
As we made our way up towards the spectacular Blue Mountains

9
0:00:40.824,000 --> 0:00:41,000
west of Sydney,

10
0:00:41.999,000 --> 0:00:43,000
it was the perfect autumn day:

11
0:00:44.463,000 --> 0:00:48,000
sunshine, the smell of eucalypt and a dream.

12
0:00:48.649,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Life was good.

13
0:00:50.517,000 --> 0:00:52,000
We'd been on our bikes for around five-and-a-half hours

14
0:00:53.145,000 --> 0:00:55,000
when we got to the part of the ride that I loved,

15
0:00:55.595,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and that was the hills, because I loved the hills.

16
0:00:58.34,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I got up off the seat of my bike and I started pumping my legs,

17
0:01:02.265,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and as I sucked in the cold mountain air, I could feel it burning my lungs,

18
0:01:06.107,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and I looked up to see the sun shining in my face.

19
0:01:10.69,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And then everything went black.

20
0:01:13.622,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Where was I? What was happening?

21
0:01:16.411,000 --> 0:01:18,000
My body was consumed by pain.

22
0:01:20.213,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I'd been hit by a speeding utility truck

23
0:01:22.952,000 --> 0:01:24,000
with only 10 minutes to go on the bike ride.

24
0:01:26.155,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I was airlifted from the scene of the accident by a rescue helicopter

25
0:01:29.45,000 --> 0:01:31,000
to a large spinal unit in Sydney.

26
0:01:31.745,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I had extensive and life-threatening injuries.

27
0:01:35.368,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I'd broken my neck and my back in six places.

28
0:01:39.169,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I broke five ribs on my left side.

29
0:01:41.485,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I broke my right arm. I broke my collarbone.

30
0:01:44.293,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I broke some bones in my feet.

31
0:01:46.67,000 --> 0:01:48,000
My whole right side was ripped open, filled with gravel.

32
0:01:49.689,000 --> 0:01:51,000
My head was cut open across the front, lifted back,

33
0:01:52.094,000 --> 0:01:53,000
exposing the skull underneath.

34
0:01:53.791,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I had head injures. I had internal injuries.

35
0:01:55.917,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I had massive blood loss.

36
0:01:57.271,000 --> 0:01:59,000
In fact, I lost about five liters of blood,

37
0:01:59.374,000 --> 0:02:01,000
which is all someone my size would actually hold.

38
0:02:01.953,000 --> 0:02:04,000
By the time the helicopter arrived at Prince Henry Hospital in Sydney,

39
0:02:05.547,000 --> 0:02:07,000
my blood pressure was 40 over nothing.

40
0:02:09.469,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I was having a really bad day.

41
0:02:11.271,000 --> 0:02:17,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:18.519,000 --> 0:02:21,000
For over 10 days, I drifted between two dimensions.

43
0:02:23.17,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I had an awareness of being in my body,

44
0:02:25.683,000 --> 0:02:27,000
but also being out of my body, somewhere else,

45
0:02:27.959,000 --> 0:02:3,000
watching from above, as if it was happening to someone else.

46
0:02:31.006,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Why would I want to go back to a body that was so broken?

47
0:02:34.853,000 --> 0:02:36,000
But this voice kept calling me:

48
0:02:37.648,000 --> 0:02:38,000
"Come on, stay with me."

49
0:02:39.923,000 --> 0:02:41,000
"No, it's too hard."

50
0:02:42.826,000 --> 0:02:44,000
"Come on. This is our opportunity."

51
0:02:45.724,000 --> 0:02:49,000
"No. That body is broken. It can no longer serve me."

52
0:02:49.761,000 --> 0:02:52,000
"Come on. Stay with me. We can do it. We can do it together."

53
0:02:54.971,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I was at a crossroads.

54
0:02:57.137,000 --> 0:03:,000
I knew if I didn't return to my body, I'd have to leave this world forever.

55
0:03:01.955,000 --> 0:03:02,000
It was the fight of my life.

56
0:03:05.163,000 --> 0:03:09,000
After 10 days, I made the decision to return to my body.

57
0:03:10.191,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And the internal bleeding stopped.

58
0:03:14.305,000 --> 0:03:17,000
The next concern was whether I would walk again,

59
0:03:17.421,000 --> 0:03:19,000
because I was paralyzed from the waist down.

60
0:03:20.222,000 --> 0:03:23,000
They said to my parents that the neck break was a stable fracture,

61
0:03:23.438,000 --> 0:03:24,000
but the back was completely crushed:

62
0:03:25.203,000 --> 0:03:28,000
the vertebra at L1 was like you'd dropped a peanut,

63
0:03:28.613,000 --> 0:03:31,000
stepped on it, smashed it into thousands of pieces.

64
0:03:31.728,000 --> 0:03:32,000
They'd have to operate.

65
0:03:34.303,000 --> 0:03:36,000
They went in. They put me on a beanbag.

66
0:03:36.666,000 --> 0:03:38,000
They cut me -- literally cut me in half.

67
0:03:38.774,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I have a scar that wraps around my entire body.

68
0:03:42.226,000 --> 0:03:44,000
They picked as much broken bone as they could

69
0:03:45.001,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that had lodged in my spinal cord.

70
0:03:46.702,000 --> 0:03:49,000
They took out two of my broken ribs and they rebuilt my back --

71
0:03:50.66,000 --> 0:03:52,000
L1, they rebuilt it, they took out another broken rib,

72
0:03:53.327,000 --> 0:03:56,000
they fused T12, L1 and L2 together.

73
0:03:56.74,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Then they stitched me up; they took an entire hour to stitch me up.

74
0:03:59.945,000 --> 0:04:,000
I woke up in intensive care,

75
0:04:01.598,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and the doctors were really excited that the operation had been a success,

76
0:04:05.254,000 --> 0:04:07,000
because at that stage, I had a little bit of movement

77
0:04:07.849,000 --> 0:04:08,000
in one of my big toes,

78
0:04:09.031,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and I thought, "Great, because I'm going to the Olympics!"

79
0:04:12.095,000 --> 0:04:14,000
(Laughter)

80
0:04:14.155,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I had no idea.

81
0:04:15.785,000 --> 0:04:18,000
That's the sort of thing that happens to someone else, not me, surely.

82
0:04:19.341,000 --> 0:04:21,000
But then the doctor came over to me and she said,

83
0:04:21.746,000 --> 0:04:23,000
"Janine, the operation was a success,

84
0:04:24.58,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and we've picked as much bone out of your spinal cord as we could.

85
0:04:28.342,000 --> 0:04:29,000
But the damage is permanent.

86
0:04:29.755,000 --> 0:04:32,000
The central nervous system nerves -- there is no cure.

87
0:04:33.381,000 --> 0:04:35,000
You're what we call a partial paraplegic,

88
0:04:35.7,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and you'll have all of the injuries that go along with that.

89
0:04:38.692,000 --> 0:04:4,000
You'll have no feeling from the waist down,

90
0:04:41.579,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and at most, you might get 10 or 20 percent return.

91
0:04:45.384,000 --> 0:04:47,000
You'll have internal injuries for the rest of your life.

92
0:04:48.042,000 --> 0:04:5,000
You'll have to use a catheter for the rest of your life.

93
0:04:51.611,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And if you walk again, it will be with calipers and a walking frame."

94
0:04:55.962,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And then she said,

95
0:04:57.161,000 --> 0:05:,000
"Janine, you'll have to rethink everything you do in your life,

96
0:05:00.311,000 --> 0:05:03,000
because you're never going to be able to do the things you did before."

97
0:05:04.006,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Gasps)

98
0:05:05.107,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I tried to grasp what she was saying.

99
0:05:07.543,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I was an athlete. That's all I knew. That's all I'd done.

100
0:05:10.284,000 --> 0:05:12,000
If I couldn't do that, then what could I do?

101
0:05:13.112,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And the question I asked myself is:

102
0:05:14.946,000 --> 0:05:15,000
If I couldn't do that,

103
0:05:17.348,000 --> 0:05:18,000
then who was I?

104
0:05:22.915,000 --> 0:05:25,000
They moved me from intensive care to acute spinal.

105
0:05:26.409,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I was lying on a thin, hard spinal bed.

106
0:05:28.663,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I had no movement in my legs.

107
0:05:30.148,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I had tight stockings on to protect from blood clots.

108
0:05:33.52,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I had one arm in plaster, one arm tied down by drips.

109
0:05:36.411,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I had a neck brace and sandbags on either side of my head

110
0:05:39.411,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and I saw my world through a mirror

111
0:05:41.381,000 --> 0:05:43,000
that was suspended above my head.

112
0:05:44.36,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I shared the ward with five other people,

113
0:05:47.837,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and the amazing thing is,

114
0:05:49.163,000 --> 0:05:52,000
because we were all lying paralyzed in a spinal ward,

115
0:05:52.733,000 --> 0:05:54,000
we didn't know what each other looked like.

116
0:05:55.163,000 --> 0:05:56,000
How amazing is that?

117
0:05:56.981,000 --> 0:06:02,000
How often in life do you get to make friendships, judgment-free,

118
0:06:03.139,000 --> 0:06:04,000
purely based on spirit?

119
0:06:06.06,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And there were no superficial conversations

120
0:06:08.717,000 --> 0:06:11,000
as we shared our innermost thoughts, our fears,

121
0:06:11.791,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and our hopes for life after the spinal ward.

122
0:06:16.361,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I remember one night, one of the nurses came in, Jonathan,

123
0:06:20.237,000 --> 0:06:23,000
with a whole lot of plastic straws.

124
0:06:23.311,000 --> 0:06:25,000
He put a pile on top of each of us, and he said,

125
0:06:25.597,000 --> 0:06:27,000
"Start threading them together."

126
0:06:28.445,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Well, there wasn't much else to do in the spinal ward, so we did.

127
0:06:31.747,000 --> 0:06:32,000
(Laughter)

128
0:06:32.796,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And when we'd finished, he went around silently

129
0:06:35.637,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and he joined all of the straws up till it looped around the whole ward.

130
0:06:40.977,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And then he said,

131
0:06:42.168,000 --> 0:06:44,000
"OK everybody, hold on to your straws."

132
0:06:45.505,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And we did. And he said, "Right ...

133
0:06:49.213,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Now we're all connected."

134
0:06:52.729,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And as we held on and we breathed as one,

135
0:06:58.033,000 --> 0:07:,000
we knew we weren't on this journey alone.

136
0:07:02.293,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And even lying paralyzed in the spinal ward ...

137
0:07:07.002,000 --> 0:07:1,000
there were moments of incredible depth and richness,

138
0:07:10.219,000 --> 0:07:12,000
of authenticity and connection

139
0:07:13.503,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that I had never experienced before.

140
0:07:17.709,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And each of us knew that when we left the spinal ward,

141
0:07:22.497,000 --> 0:07:23,000
we would never be the same.

142
0:07:27.546,000 --> 0:07:29,000
After six months, it was time to go home.

143
0:07:31.21,000 --> 0:07:34,000
I remember Dad pushing me outside in my wheelchair,

144
0:07:34.726,000 --> 0:07:36,000
wrapped in a plaster body cast,

145
0:07:37.668,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and feeling the sun on my face for the first time.

146
0:07:40.89,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I soaked it up and I thought,

147
0:07:42.313,000 --> 0:07:45,000
"How could I ever have taken this for granted?"

148
0:07:46.73,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I felt so incredibly grateful for my life.

149
0:07:50.463,000 --> 0:07:51,000
But before I left hospital,

150
0:07:51.867,000 --> 0:07:54,000
the head nurse had said to me, "Janine, I want you to be ready,

151
0:07:54.923,000 --> 0:07:56,000
because when you get home, something's going to happen."

152
0:07:57.632,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And I said, "What?"

153
0:07:58.821,000 --> 0:08:,000
And she said, "You're going to get depressed."

154
0:08:01.558,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And I said, "Not me, not Janine the Machine,"

155
0:08:04.568,000 --> 0:08:05,000
which was my nickname.

156
0:08:06.306,000 --> 0:08:09,000
She said, "You are, because, see, it happens to everyone.

157
0:08:09.413,000 --> 0:08:13,000
In the spinal ward, that's normal. You're in a wheelchair. That's normal.

158
0:08:13.688,000 --> 0:08:16,000
But you're going to get home and realize how different life is."

159
0:08:17.95,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And I got home.

160
0:08:20.312,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And something happened.

161
0:08:23.901,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I realized Sister Sam was right.

162
0:08:27.259,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I did get depressed.

163
0:08:30.203,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I was in my wheelchair.

164
0:08:31.98,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I had no feeling from the waist down,

165
0:08:33.857,000 --> 0:08:34,000
attached to a catheter bottle.

166
0:08:35.334,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I couldn't walk.

167
0:08:37.073,000 --> 0:08:39,000
I'd lost so much weight in hospital,

168
0:08:39.264,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I now weighed about 80 pounds.

169
0:08:43.31,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And I wanted to give up.

170
0:08:45.17,000 --> 0:08:49,000
All I wanted to do was put my running shoes on and run out the door.

171
0:08:49.266,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I wanted my old life back. I wanted my body back.

172
0:08:52.449,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And I can remember Mom sitting on the end of my bed

173
0:08:54.875,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and saying, "I wonder if life will ever be good again."

174
0:08:58.845,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And I thought, "How could it?

175
0:09:01.581,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Because I've lost everything that I valued,

176
0:09:05.11,000 --> 0:09:07,000
everything that I'd worked towards.

177
0:09:07.243,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Gone."

178
0:09:10.253,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And the question I asked was, "Why me? Why me?"

179
0:09:15.171,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And then I remembered

180
0:09:17.991,000 --> 0:09:2,000
my friends that were still in the spinal ward,

181
0:09:21.036,000 --> 0:09:22,000
particularly Maria.

182
0:09:23.147,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Maria was in a car accident,

183
0:09:24.632,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and she woke up on her 16th birthday

184
0:09:26.581,000 --> 0:09:29,000
to the news that she was a complete quadriplegic,

185
0:09:29.7,000 --> 0:09:31,000
had no movement from the neck down,

186
0:09:31.993,000 --> 0:09:33,000
had damage to her vocal chords, and she couldn't talk.

187
0:09:36.007,000 --> 0:09:38,000
They told me, "We're going to move you next to her

188
0:09:38.384,000 --> 0:09:4,000
because we think it will be good for her."

189
0:09:41.453,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I was worried. I didn't know how I'd react to being next to her.

190
0:09:45.963,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I knew it would be challenging, but it was actually a blessing,

191
0:09:49.853,000 --> 0:09:53,000
because Maria always smiled.

192
0:09:54.696,000 --> 0:09:58,000
She was always happy, and even when she began to talk again,

193
0:09:59.456,000 --> 0:10:04,000
albeit difficult to understand, she never complained, not once.

194
0:10:05.458,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And I wondered how had she ever found that level of acceptance.

195
0:10:11.018,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And I realized that this wasn't just my life;

196
0:10:15.831,000 --> 0:10:16,000
it was life itself.

197
0:10:17.669,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I realized that this wasn't just my pain; it was everybody's pain.

198
0:10:22.574,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And then I knew, just like before,

199
0:10:25.444,000 --> 0:10:28,000
that I had a choice: I could keep fighting this,

200
0:10:30.204,000 --> 0:10:34,000
or I could let go and accept not only my body,

201
0:10:34.831,000 --> 0:10:36,000
but the circumstances of my life.

202
0:10:38.315,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And then I stopped asking, "Why me?"

203
0:10:41.736,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And I started to ask, "Why not me?"

204
0:10:45.192,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And then I thought to myself,

205
0:10:47.508,000 --> 0:10:51,000
maybe being at rock bottom is actually the perfect place to start.

206
0:10:56.656,000 --> 0:10:59,000
I had never before thought of myself as a creative person.

207
0:10:59.699,000 --> 0:11:02,000
I was an athlete; my body was a machine.

208
0:11:03.773,000 --> 0:11:07,000
But now I was about to embark on the most creative project

209
0:11:08.219,000 --> 0:11:09,000
that any of us could ever do:

210
0:11:10.227,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that of rebuilding a life.

211
0:11:13.252,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And even though I had absolutely no idea what I was going to do,

212
0:11:16.711,000 --> 0:11:19,000
in that uncertainty came a sense of freedom.

213
0:11:20.879,000 --> 0:11:22,000
I was no longer tied to a set path.

214
0:11:23.865,000 --> 0:11:27,000
I was free to explore life's infinite possibilities.

215
0:11:29.518,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And that realization was about to change my life.

216
0:11:35.855,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Sitting at home in my wheelchair and my plaster body cast,

217
0:11:40.468,000 --> 0:11:42,000
an airplane flew overhead.

218
0:11:43.742,000 --> 0:11:46,000
I looked up, and I thought to myself, "That's it!

219
0:11:48.135,000 --> 0:11:5,000
If I can't walk, then I might as well fly."

220
0:11:50.905,000 --> 0:11:51,000
(Laughter)

221
0:11:51.944,000 --> 0:11:53,000
I said, "Mom, I'm going to learn how to fly."

222
0:11:54.597,000 --> 0:11:55,000
She said, "That's nice, dear."

223
0:11:56.375,000 --> 0:11:58,000
(Laughter)

224
0:11:58.474,000 --> 0:12:,000
I said, "Pass me the yellow pages."

225
0:12:00.869,000 --> 0:12:02,000
She passed me the phone book, I rang up the flying school,

226
0:12:03.626,000 --> 0:12:05,000
I said I'd like to make a booking to come out for a flight.

227
0:12:06.471,000 --> 0:12:08,000
They said, "When do you want to come out?"

228
0:12:08.811,000 --> 0:12:11,000
I said, "Well, I have to get a friend to drive me because I can't drive.

229
0:12:12.405,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Sort of can't walk, either. Is that a problem?"

230
0:12:14.823,000 --> 0:12:15,000
I made a booking, and weeks later,

231
0:12:16.497,000 --> 0:12:18,000
my friend Chris and my mom drove me out to the airport,

232
0:12:19.294,000 --> 0:12:21,000
all 80 pounds of me covered in a plaster body cast

233
0:12:21.716,000 --> 0:12:22,000
in a baggy pair of overalls.

234
0:12:23.174,000 --> 0:12:24,000
(Laughter)

235
0:12:24.296,000 --> 0:12:26,000
I can tell you, I did not look like the ideal candidate

236
0:12:27.076,000 --> 0:12:28,000
to get a pilot's license.

237
0:12:28.466,000 --> 0:12:29,000
(Laughter)

238
0:12:30.084,000 --> 0:12:32,000
I'm holding on to the counter because I can't stand.

239
0:12:32.561,000 --> 0:12:34,000
I said, "Hi, I'm here for a flying lesson."

240
0:12:34.649,000 --> 0:12:37,000
They took one look and ran out the back to draw short straws.

241
0:12:38.307,000 --> 0:12:4,000
"You get her." "No, no, you take her."

242
0:12:41.274,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Finally a guy goes, "Hi, I'm Andrew. I'm going to take you flying."

243
0:12:44.493,000 --> 0:12:45,000
I go, "Great!"

244
0:12:45.691,000 --> 0:12:46,000
They get me out on the tarmac,

245
0:12:47.41,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and there was this red, white and blue airplane -- it was beautiful.

246
0:12:50.902,000 --> 0:12:53,000
They had to slide me up on the wing to put me in the cockpit.

247
0:12:54.712,000 --> 0:12:56,000
They sat me down. There are buttons and dials everywhere.

248
0:12:57.495,000 --> 0:13:,000
I'm going, "Wow, how do you ever know what all these buttons and dials do?"

249
0:13:01.124,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Andrew got in the front, started the plane, and said,

250
0:13:03.799,000 --> 0:13:04,000
"Would you like to have a go at taxiing?"

251
0:13:05.801,000 --> 0:13:07,000
That's when you use your feet to control the rudder pedals

252
0:13:08.571,000 --> 0:13:09,000
to control the airplane on the ground.

253
0:13:10.442,000 --> 0:13:11,000
I said, "No, I can't use my legs."

254
0:13:12.341,000 --> 0:13:13,000
He went, "Oh."

255
0:13:13.548,000 --> 0:13:15,000
I said, "But I can use my hands," and he said, "OK."

256
0:13:16.374,000 --> 0:13:18,000
So he got over to the runway, and he applied the power.

257
0:13:19.331,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And as we took off down the runway,

258
0:13:21.575,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and the wheels lifted up off the tarmac, and we became airborne,

259
0:13:26.322,000 --> 0:13:29,000
I had the most incredible sense of freedom.

260
0:13:30.925,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And Andrew said to me,

261
0:13:33.497,000 --> 0:13:34,000
as we got over the training area,

262
0:13:36.234,000 --> 0:13:37,000
"You see that mountain over there?"

263
0:13:38.51,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And I said, "Yeah."

264
0:13:40.077,000 --> 0:13:44,000
And he said, "Well, you take the controls, and you fly towards that mountain."

265
0:13:44.578,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And as I looked up, I realized

266
0:13:47.061,000 --> 0:13:5,000
that he was pointing towards the Blue Mountains,

267
0:13:50.526,000 --> 0:13:51,000
where the journey had begun.

268
0:13:53.756,000 --> 0:13:54,000
And I took the controls,

269
0:13:56.159,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and I was flying.

270
0:13:58.238,000 --> 0:14:,000
And I was a long, long way from that spinal ward.

271
0:14:01.2,000 --> 0:14:03,000
I knew right then that I was going to be a pilot.

272
0:14:04.973,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Didn't know how on Earth I'd ever pass a medical.

273
0:14:07.629,000 --> 0:14:08,000
(Laughter)

274
0:14:08.763,000 --> 0:14:11,000
But I'd worry about that later, because right now, I had a dream.

275
0:14:12.042,000 --> 0:14:15,000
So I went home, I got a training diary out, and I had a plan.

276
0:14:16.344,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And I practiced my walking as much as I could,

277
0:14:19.087,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and I went from the point of two people holding me up ...

278
0:14:22.833,000 --> 0:14:23,000
to one person holding me up ...

279
0:14:25.23,000 --> 0:14:27,000
to the point where I could walk around the furniture

280
0:14:27.722,000 --> 0:14:28,000
as long as it wasn't too far apart.

281
0:14:29.481,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And then I made great progression,

282
0:14:31.242,000 --> 0:14:33,000
to the point where I could walk around the house,

283
0:14:33.552,000 --> 0:14:34,000
holding onto the walls, like this.

284
0:14:35.685,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And Mom said she was forever following me,

285
0:14:37.94,000 --> 0:14:38,000
wiping off my fingerprints.

286
0:14:39.463,000 --> 0:14:41,000
(Laughter)

287
0:14:41.836,000 --> 0:14:43,000
But at least she always knew where I was.

288
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:46,000
(Laughter)

289
0:14:46.102,000 --> 0:14:48,000
So while the doctors continued to operate

290
0:14:48.599,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and put my body back together again,

291
0:14:50.675,000 --> 0:14:51,000
I went on with my theory study.

292
0:14:53.329,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And then eventually, amazingly, I passed my pilot's medical,

293
0:14:57.679,000 --> 0:14:59,000
and that was my green light to fly.

294
0:14:59.911,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And I spent every moment I could out at that flying school,

295
0:15:02.753,000 --> 0:15:03,000
way out of my comfort zone,

296
0:15:04.331,000 --> 0:15:07,000
all these young guys that wanted to be Qantas pilots, you know,

297
0:15:07.426,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and little old hop-along me in first my plaster cast,

298
0:15:10.379,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and then my steel brace, my baggy overalls,

299
0:15:12.878,000 --> 0:15:15,000
my bag of medication and catheters and my limp.

300
0:15:16.478,000 --> 0:15:17,000
They use to look at me and think,

301
0:15:18.116,000 --> 0:15:21,000
"Oh, who is she kidding? She's never going to be able to do this."

302
0:15:21.418,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And sometimes I thought that, too.

303
0:15:23.226,000 --> 0:15:24,000
But that didn't matter,

304
0:15:24.853,000 --> 0:15:26,000
because now there was something inside that burned

305
0:15:27.659,000 --> 0:15:3,000
that far outweighed my injuries.

306
0:15:31.691,000 --> 0:15:33,000
And little goals kept me going along the way,

307
0:15:34.005,000 --> 0:15:36,000
and eventually I got my private pilot's license.

308
0:15:37.482,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Then I learned to navigate, and I flew my friends around Australia.

309
0:15:42.612,000 --> 0:15:44,000
And then I learned to fly an airplane with two engines

310
0:15:45.587,000 --> 0:15:46,000
and I got my twin-engine rating.

311
0:15:48.006,000 --> 0:15:51,000
And then I learned to fly in bad weather as well as fine weather,

312
0:15:51.34,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and got my instrument rating.

313
0:15:53.829,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And then I got my commercial pilot's license.

314
0:15:56.52,000 --> 0:15:58,000
And then I got my instructor rating.

315
0:15:59.558,000 --> 0:16:01,000
And then I found myself back at that same school

316
0:16:02.442,000 --> 0:16:04,000
where I'd gone for that very first flight,

317
0:16:04.934,000 --> 0:16:05,000
teaching other people how to fly ...

318
0:16:07.938,000 --> 0:16:11,000
just under 18 months after I'd left the spinal ward.

319
0:16:12.076,000 --> 0:16:19,000
(Applause)

320
0:16:21.839,000 --> 0:16:23,000
(Applause ends)

321
0:16:23.918,000 --> 0:16:25,000
And then I thought, "Why stop there?

322
0:16:25.945,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Why not learn to fly upside down?"

323
0:16:27.991,000 --> 0:16:28,000
(Laughter)

324
0:16:29.117,000 --> 0:16:31,000
And I did, and I learned to fly upside down

325
0:16:31.927,000 --> 0:16:33,000
and became an aerobatics flying instructor.

326
0:16:34.276,000 --> 0:16:35,000
(Laughter)

327
0:16:36.148,000 --> 0:16:38,000
And Mom and Dad? Never been up.

328
0:16:39.155,000 --> 0:16:42,000
(Laughter)

329
0:16:42.647,000 --> 0:16:47,000
But then I knew for certain that although my body might be limited,

330
0:16:47.9,000 --> 0:16:49,000
it was my spirit that was unstoppable.

331
0:16:53.68,000 --> 0:16:55,000
The philosopher Lao Tzu once said,

332
0:16:57.003,000 --> 0:16:58,000
"When you let go of what you are,

333
0:16:59.026,000 --> 0:17:01,000
you become what you might be."

334
0:17:02.457,000 --> 0:17:07,000
I now know that it wasn't until I let go of who I thought I was

335
0:17:07.757,000 --> 0:17:1,000
that I was able to create a completely new life.

336
0:17:11.74,000 --> 0:17:15,000
It wasn't until I let go of the life I thought I should have ...

337
0:17:17.121,000 --> 0:17:2,000
that I was able to embrace the life that was waiting for me.

338
0:17:21.532,000 --> 0:17:23,000
I now know that my real strength

339
0:17:24.205,000 --> 0:17:26,000
never came from my body.

340
0:17:27.601,000 --> 0:17:31,000
And although my physical capabilities have changed dramatically,

341
0:17:32.524,000 --> 0:17:35,000
who I am is unchanged.

342
0:17:36.675,000 --> 0:17:39,000
The pilot light inside of me was still alight,

343
0:17:40.551,000 --> 0:17:42,000
just as it is in each and every one of us.

344
0:17:45.522,000 --> 0:17:46,000
I know that I'm not my body.

345
0:17:48.504,000 --> 0:17:5,000
And I also know that you're not yours.

346
0:17:52.072,000 --> 0:17:56,000
And then it no longer matters what you look like,

347
0:17:56.25,000 --> 0:17:59,000
where you come from, or what you do for a living.

348
0:18:00.657,000 --> 0:18:05,000
All that matters is that we continue to fan the flame of humanity

349
0:18:06.365,000 --> 0:18:09,000
by living our lives as the ultimate creative expression

350
0:18:10.319,000 --> 0:18:12,000
of who we really are,

351
0:18:13.867,000 --> 0:18:15,000
because we are all connected

352
0:18:16.584,000 --> 0:18:18,000
by millions and millions of straws.

353
0:18:21.319,000 --> 0:18:23,000
And it's time to join those up

354
0:18:24.116,000 --> 0:18:25,000
and to hang on.

355
0:18:26.161,000 --> 0:18:29,000
And if we are to move towards our collective bliss ...

356
0:18:30.415,000 --> 0:18:32,000
it's time we shed our focus on the physical

357
0:18:32.995,000 --> 0:18:35,000
and instead embrace the virtues of the heart.

358
0:18:36.381,000 --> 0:18:38,000
So raise your straws if you'll join me.

359
0:18:39.964,000 --> 0:18:4,000
(Applause)

360
0:18:41.138,000 --> 0:18:42,000
Thank you.

361
0:18:42.323,000 --> 0:18:47,000
(Applause)

362
0:18:47.394,000 --> 0:18:48,000
Thank you.

363
0:18:48.744,000 --> 0:18:51,000
(Applause)

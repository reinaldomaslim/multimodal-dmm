1
0:00:17.634,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Do I look real to you?

2
0:00:20.133,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Hope so.

3
0:00:21.797,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I have no idea if you're seeing this,

4
0:00:23.624,000 --> 0:00:26,000
but I'm just going to look ahead and trust that you're there.

5
0:00:27.802,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I've drawn a semicircle in the sand in front of me

6
0:00:30.59,000 --> 0:00:33,000
so I don't walk past it and look like I'm floating in midair.

7
0:00:38.433,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Right now I'm standing

8
0:00:41.132,000 --> 0:00:42,000
in the open air,

9
0:00:42.307,000 --> 0:00:43,000
on a beach under a palm tree,

10
0:00:45.949,000 --> 0:00:47,000
in the exact spot where your stage used to be.

11
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I have 12 minutes with you.

12
0:00:52.581,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I set a limit.

13
0:00:54.85,000 --> 0:00:55,000
My wife Navid once said

14
0:00:56.029,000 --> 0:01:,000
that infinite possibility is a creator's worst enemy.

15
0:01:00.633,000 --> 0:01:02,000
For example, this dress: I'd asked her to design something

16
0:01:03.534,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that a priest might have worn in 23rd-century Cairo.

17
0:01:06.911,000 --> 0:01:09,000
But we only had three days to make it,

18
0:01:09.967,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and the only fabric we had

19
0:01:11.695,000 --> 0:01:13,000
was an old duvet cover that another resident left behind.

20
0:01:14.44,000 --> 0:01:17,000
But she did it, and it's perfect.

21
0:01:19.01,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And she looked at it and said,

22
0:01:21.664,000 --> 0:01:23,000
"Proof of concept -- creation needs constraint."

23
0:01:27.727,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So with these 12 minutes,

24
0:01:31.072,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I'm going to tell you about my greatest discovery.

25
0:01:36.812,000 --> 0:01:39,000
For my whole life, my obsession has been eternal life,

26
0:01:41.256,000 --> 0:01:43,000
as I know it is so many of yours.

27
0:01:45.848,000 --> 0:01:47,000
You may be happy to know that your research will pay off.

28
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I am 318 years old.

29
0:01:53.486,000 --> 0:01:56,000
The average human lifespan is now 432 years,

30
0:01:57.281,000 --> 0:02:,000
and my work has been to extend the human lifespan indefinitely.

31
0:02:01.363,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And I've never questioned that someday,

32
0:02:03.874,000 --> 0:02:05,000
we'll reach a point where we'll be content.

33
0:02:08.959,000 --> 0:02:09,000
But the opposite keeps happening:

34
0:02:10.589,000 --> 0:02:12,000
the longer we live, the longer we want to live,

35
0:02:13.087,000 --> 0:02:14,000
the less we want to die.

36
0:02:15.974,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Who can blame us?

37
0:02:18.183,000 --> 0:02:21,000
The universe is so big.

38
0:02:22.548,000 --> 0:02:23,000
There won't ever not be more to see.

39
0:02:24.478,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Just yesterday,

40
0:02:25.653,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I was reading about how you can take out a boat on Europa

41
0:02:28.437,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and sail from island to island all over the planet,

42
0:02:30.875,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and some of the islands have villages that you can stay and visit

43
0:02:34.132,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and sleep under the shadow of Jupiter.

44
0:02:36.945,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And then there's this other island where there's just one songwriter

45
0:02:41.016,000 --> 0:02:43,000
who sits and plays mandolin for the ocean.

46
0:02:43.517,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And then there are others where there's no one

47
0:02:46.456,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and there never has been,

48
0:02:47.886,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and so you go just for the pleasure of touching your foot to sand

49
0:02:51.735,000 --> 0:02:53,000
that no foot has ever touched before.

50
0:02:55.309,000 --> 0:02:57,000
You could spend 400 years doing just that.

51
0:03:03.627,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Right now the Moon is rising in the Northeast.

52
0:03:07.013,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I can see the cities on it with my naked eye.

53
0:03:09.188,000 --> 0:03:11,000
They're connected like nerve clusters:

54
0:03:12.332,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Mariapolis on the South Pole, and Ramachandran on the Equator.

55
0:03:18.956,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And New Tehran in the Sea of Tranquility.

56
0:03:24.334,000 --> 0:03:26,000
That's where Navid and I met.

57
0:03:26.472,000 --> 0:03:27,000
We were both artists downtown.

58
0:03:30.138,000 --> 0:03:32,000
The day we met, we were passing each other in Azadi Square,

59
0:03:33.018,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and we bumped shoulders.

60
0:03:34.504,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And I turned to apologize

61
0:03:36.279,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and she, without saying hello or introducing herself or anything,

62
0:03:40.602,000 --> 0:03:43,000
said, "Well, why do you think we didn't just pass through each other?"

63
0:03:46.101,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And first of all, I thought, "Who the hell are you?"

64
0:03:50.363,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But second, the question annoyed me,

65
0:03:52.409,000 --> 0:03:53,000
because the answer is so simple.

66
0:03:54.898,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I said, "We didn't pass through each other

67
0:03:57.332,000 --> 0:03:59,000
because elementary particles have mass

68
0:03:59.6,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and because the space between elementary particles

69
0:04:01.997,000 --> 0:04:04,000
is filled with the binding energy that also has the properties of mass,

70
0:04:05.393,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and we've known that for 800 years."

71
0:04:09.919,000 --> 0:04:1,000
She must have been in one of those moods

72
0:04:11.899,000 --> 0:04:12,000
where she likes to mess with strangers.

73
0:04:13.811,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Or maybe she was just flirting with me,

74
0:04:15.724,000 --> 0:04:18,000
because she looked at me and said, "I thought you'd say that.

75
0:04:20.636,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Think deeper."

76
0:04:21.811,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And then she took off her belt,

77
0:04:23.358,000 --> 0:04:26,000
this belt that I'm wearing now,

78
0:04:28.408,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and she said,

79
0:04:32.607,000 --> 0:04:35,000
"Our universe is built so that particles have mass.

80
0:04:38.769,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Without that basic constraint,

81
0:04:40.294,000 --> 0:04:43,000
we'd have just passed right through each other at the speed of light

82
0:04:43.801,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and never even known."

83
0:04:48.239,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And that's how our romance began.

84
0:04:58.128,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Navid and I

85
0:05:01.239,000 --> 0:05:03,000
never ran out of things to talk about.

86
0:05:05.31,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Never.

87
0:05:07.1,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It was incredible.

88
0:05:08.276,000 --> 0:05:12,000
It was like we were both heroes climbing up into a mountain range together

89
0:05:12.834,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and we kept arriving at new vistas,

90
0:05:15.313,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and these new, perfect constellations of words

91
0:05:18.333,000 --> 0:05:19,000
would come out of us to describe them.

92
0:05:20.214,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And we'd forget them as soon as we made them,

93
0:05:22.362,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and throw them over our shoulder and go on to the next thing, on and up.

94
0:05:25.807,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Or one time, Navid said that our talk was like we were always making bread,

95
0:05:29.745,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and that we were always adding in a little more flour

96
0:05:33.288,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and a little more water,

97
0:05:34.761,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and folding it in and turning it over

98
0:05:36.738,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and never getting around to baking it.

99
0:05:44.589,000 --> 0:05:47,000
If my obsession was eternal life, Navid's obsession was touch.

100
0:05:50.772,000 --> 0:05:52,000
She had a genius for it.

101
0:05:53.502,000 --> 0:05:54,000
All of her work revolved around it.

102
0:05:57.383,000 --> 0:05:59,000
My body was like a canvas for her,

103
0:05:59.613,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and she would draw her fingertip down over my face so slowly

104
0:06:04.258,000 --> 0:06:05,000
that I couldn't feel it moving.

105
0:06:06.265,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And she was obsessed with the exact moment

106
0:06:08.962,000 --> 0:06:11,000
when I would stop being able to tell the difference between her body and mine.

107
0:06:15.721,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Or she would just lie across me and dig her shoulder into mine

108
0:06:18.74,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and say, "Pilar, why does this feel so good?"

109
0:06:23.009,000 --> 0:06:24,000
I'd say, "I don't know!"

110
0:06:27.64,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And she always had a facetious answer for her facetious question,

111
0:06:33.033,000 --> 0:06:35,000
but the answer I remember today is,

112
0:06:37.399,000 --> 0:06:38,000
"It feels good

113
0:06:38.574,000 --> 0:06:4,000
because the universe chose its constraints,

114
0:06:41.378,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and we are its art."

115
0:06:53.677,000 --> 0:06:56,000
It's always funny what you think the future is going to be like

116
0:06:56.726,000 --> 0:06:57,000
versus what it turns out to be.

117
0:07:00.169,000 --> 0:07:03,000
In your time, scientists thought humans could freeze themselves

118
0:07:03.297,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and wake up in the future.

119
0:07:05.761,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And they did -- but then they died.

120
0:07:11.083,000 --> 0:07:14,000
In your time, scientists thought humans could replace organs

121
0:07:14.867,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and extend life for hundreds of years.

122
0:07:18.311,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And they did,

123
0:07:19.681,000 --> 0:07:21,000
but eventually, they died anyway.

124
0:07:23.381,000 --> 0:07:26,000
In your time, Earth is the only place people live.

125
0:07:29.826,000 --> 0:07:32,000
In my time, Earth is the place people come to die.

126
0:07:37.539,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So when Navid started to show the signs,

127
0:07:41.083,000 --> 0:07:43,000
our friends assumed I would do what everyone does,

128
0:07:43.539,000 --> 0:07:45,000
which is say goodbye and send her to Earth,

129
0:07:46.517,000 --> 0:07:49,000
so that none of us would have to look at her

130
0:07:49.756,000 --> 0:07:52,000
or be around her or think about her and her ...

131
0:07:54.225,000 --> 0:07:55,000
failure to keep living.

132
0:08:00.811,000 --> 0:08:01,000
More than anything,

133
0:08:02.019,000 --> 0:08:04,000
they didn't want to be around her actual physical body.

134
0:08:04.82,000 --> 0:08:07,000
They kept referring to it as "declining,"

135
0:08:08.536,000 --> 0:08:1,000
even though she herself was fascinated by it,

136
0:08:10.825,000 --> 0:08:12,000
the changes it was going through,

137
0:08:12.972,000 --> 0:08:15,000
following the rules of its nature day by day, independent of her will.

138
0:08:20.481,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I did send Navid to Earth.

139
0:08:23.948,000 --> 0:08:24,000
But I came with her.

140
0:08:26.6,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I remember a friend of ours, just before we left, said,

141
0:08:30.192,000 --> 0:08:31,000
"I just think it's arrogant,

142
0:08:33.08,000 --> 0:08:36,000
like the rules don't apply to you, like you think your love is that special."

143
0:08:39.497,000 --> 0:08:4,000
But I did.

144
0:08:44.468,000 --> 0:08:45,000
So, even here on Earth,

145
0:08:45.882,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I kept working on how to extend life.

146
0:08:49.198,000 --> 0:08:5,000
It didn't occur to me

147
0:08:50.373,000 --> 0:08:52,000
that there could be any other response.

148
0:08:52.44,000 --> 0:08:54,000
I kept going back to that thing that Navid said to me

149
0:08:55.003,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that day in Azadi Square,

150
0:08:56.766,000 --> 0:08:57,000
that without that basic constraint --

151
0:08:59.486,000 --> 0:09:01,000
a universe that granted mass to matter --

152
0:09:01.786,000 --> 0:09:02,000
we would not exist.

153
0:09:05.481,000 --> 0:09:06,000
That's one rule.

154
0:09:06.676,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Another rule is that all mass is subject to entropy.

155
0:09:11.929,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And there is no way to be in this universe without mass.

156
0:09:14.724,000 --> 0:09:15,000
I know. I tried everything.

157
0:09:16.43,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I tried creating a photon box where the Higgs field was altered.

158
0:09:21.043,000 --> 0:09:25,000
I tried recording all subatomic movements in my body

159
0:09:25.199,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and replaying them on closed loop.

160
0:09:27.01,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Nothing worked.

161
0:09:33.184,000 --> 0:09:38,000
But my final innovation was to create a coil dimension

162
0:09:38.968,000 --> 0:09:42,000
with the boundaries of a body in which time moved infinitely slower,

163
0:09:44.635,000 --> 0:09:47,000
but whose projection would appear to move in normal time.

164
0:09:49.4,000 --> 0:09:52,000
That body would then appear in our universe as a hologram --

165
0:09:55.215,000 --> 0:09:56,000
here but not here.

166
0:10:01.166,000 --> 0:10:02,000
When I realized I'd done it,

167
0:10:03.987,000 --> 0:10:04,000
I ran to her room,

168
0:10:05.867,000 --> 0:10:07,000
so happy to tell her I'd done it,

169
0:10:08.838,000 --> 0:10:1,000
moving through space almost normally to all eyes,

170
0:10:12.366,000 --> 0:10:13,000
even to my own,

171
0:10:15.95,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and went to lie down next to her,

172
0:10:19.262,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and forgot, and fell right through her.

173
0:10:28.303,000 --> 0:10:3,000
I'd found a way to eternal life,

174
0:10:32.448,000 --> 0:10:34,000
at the expense of the one thing Navid loved most,

175
0:10:34.782,000 --> 0:10:37,000
which was to touch and be touched.

176
0:10:41.939,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And she threw me out.

177
0:10:48.42,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I still got to watch, though.

178
0:10:51.748,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Humans live 400 years now,

179
0:10:53.504,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and we still die.

180
0:10:54.906,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And when death comes,

181
0:10:58.342,000 --> 0:11:01,000
the dying still pick at their bedsheets,

182
0:11:04.319,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and their arms break out in blue and violet blooms on the insides,

183
0:11:08.154,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and their breaths get further and further apart,

184
0:11:11.692,000 --> 0:11:13,000
like they're falling asleep.

185
0:11:21.78,000 --> 0:11:22,000
I've always thought that

186
0:11:23.796,000 --> 0:11:25,000
what gives a life meaning is adventure.

187
0:11:27.476,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And death is just a problem

188
0:11:29.893,000 --> 0:11:31,000
we haven't discovered the solution to yet.

189
0:11:36.594,000 --> 0:11:38,000
But maybe a life has meaning only because it ends.

190
0:11:40.221,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Maybe that's the paradox:

191
0:11:41.568,000 --> 0:11:44,000
constraints don't constrain, they allow perfect freedom.

192
0:11:51.175,000 --> 0:11:52,000
(Sighs)

193
0:11:57.963,000 --> 0:11:59,000
There was a thunderstorm here this morning.

194
0:12:00.011,000 --> 0:12:01,000
There is another forecast for tonight,

195
0:12:01.868,000 --> 0:12:02,000
but for now the sky is clear.

196
0:12:04.937,000 --> 0:12:05,000
I can't feel the wind here,

197
0:12:06.314,000 --> 0:12:09,000
but I just asked one of the caretakers who passed by what it felt like,

198
0:12:09.702,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and she said it felt warm, like melted butter.

199
0:12:15.464,000 --> 0:12:16,000
An answer worthy of my wife.

200
0:12:22.861,000 --> 0:12:24,000
I have to find my way back to the flesh.

201
0:12:28.98,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Until then, I take up no space but the space you give me.

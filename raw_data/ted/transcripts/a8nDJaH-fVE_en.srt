1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I work with a species called "Bonobo."

2
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And I'm happy most of the time,

3
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:33,000
because I think this is the happiest species on the planet.

4
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It's kind of a well-kept secret.

5
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:38,000
This species lives only in the Congo.

6
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And they're not in too many zoos, because of their sexual behavior.

7
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Their sexual behavior is too human-like

8
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:48,000
for most of us to be comfortable with.

9
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:49,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:5,000
But --

11
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:56,000
actually, we have a lot to learn from them, because they're a very

13
0:00:56,000 --> 0:01:,000
egalitarian society and they're a very empathetic society.

14
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life

15
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that they sort of set aside.

16
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:09,000
It permeates their entire life.

17
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And it's used for communication.

18
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And it's used for conflict resolution.

19
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And I think perhaps somewhere in our history we sort of,

20
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:21,000
divided our lives up into lots of parts.

21
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:25,000
We divided our world up with lots of categories.

22
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And so everything sort of has a place that it has to fit.

23
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:32,000
But I don't think that we were that way initially.

24
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:36,000
There are many people who think that the animal world is hard-wired

25
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and that there's something very, very special about man.

26
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Maybe it's his ability to have causal thought.

27
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Maybe it's something special in his brain

28
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that allows him to have language.

29
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Maybe it's something special in his brain

30
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:57,000
that allows him to make tools or to have mathematics.

31
0:01:57,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Well, I don't know. There were Tasmanians who were discovered

32
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:07,000
around the 1600s and they had no fire.

33
0:02:07,000 --> 0:02:1,000
They had no stone tools.

34
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:13,000
To our knowledge they had no music.

35
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So when you compare them to the Bonobo,

36
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:21,000
the Bonobo is a little hairier.

37
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:25,000
He doesn't stand quite as upright.

38
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
But there are a lot of similarities.

39
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And I think that as we look at culture,

40
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
we kind of come to understand

41
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:38,000
how we got to where we are.

42
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And I don't really think it's in our biology;

43
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I think we've attributed it to our biology,

44
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:46,000
but I don't really think it's there.

45
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So what I want to do now is introduce you

46
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:5,000
to a species called the Bonobo.

47
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:54,000
This is Kanzi.

48
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:56,000
He's a Bonobo.

49
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Right now, he's in a forest in Georgia.

50
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:03,000
His mother originally came from a forest in Africa.

51
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And she came to us when she was just at puberty,

52
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:09,000
about six or seven years of age.

53
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Now this shows a Bonobo on your right,

54
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and a chimpanzee on your left.

55
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Clearly, the chimpanzee has a little bit harder time of walking.

56
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:22,000
The Bonobo, although shorter than us and their arms still longer,

57
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:26,000
is more upright, just as we are.

58
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
This shows the Bonobo compared to an australopithecine like Lucy.

59
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:34,000
As you can see, there's not a lot of difference

60
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:36,000
between the way a Bonobo walks

61
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and the way an early australopithecine would have walked.

62
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:42,000
As they turn toward us you'll see

63
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:47,000
that the pelvic area of early australopithecines is a little flatter

64
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and doesn't have to rotate quite so much from side to side.

65
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So the -- the bipedal gait is a little easier.

66
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And now we see all four.

67
0:03:56,000 --> 0:04:,000
Video: Narrator: The wild Bonobo lives in central Africa, in the jungle

68
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:03,000
encircled by the Congo River.

69
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Canopied trees as tall as 40 meters, 130 feet,

70
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:13,000
grow densely in the area.

71
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:16,000
It was a Japanese scientist

72
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
who first undertook serious field studies of the Bonobo,

73
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:23,000
almost three decades ago.

74
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Bonobos are built slightly smaller than the chimpanzee.

75
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Slim-bodied, Bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures.

76
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them.

77
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:49,000
One discovery was that wild Bonobos often walk bidpedally.

78
0:04:55,000 --> 0:05:,000
What's more, they are able to walk upright for long distances.

79
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Susan Savage-Rumbaugh (video): Let's go say hello to Austin first and then go to the A frame.

80
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:13,000
SS: This is Kanzi and I, in the forest.

81
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:17,000
None of the things you will see in this particular video are trained.

82
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:19,000
None of them are tricks.

83
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:22,000
They all happened to be captured on film spontaneously,

84
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:24,000
by NHK of Japan.

85
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:27,000
We have eight Bonobos.

86
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Video: Look at all this stuff that's here for our campfire.

87
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:33,000
SS: An entire family at our research centre.

88
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Video: You going to help get some sticks?

89
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Good.

90
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:49,000
We need more sticks, too.

91
0:05:56,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I have a lighter in my pocket if you need one.

92
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:01,000
That's a wasps' nest.

93
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:03,000
You can get it out.

94
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I hope I have a lighter.

95
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:1,000
You can use the lighter to start the fire.

96
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:14,000
SS: So Kanzi is very interested in fire.

97
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:17,000
He doesn't do it yet without a lighter,

98
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:21,000
but I think if he saw someone do it, he might be able to do --

99
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:23,000
make a fire without a lighter.

100
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:27,000
He's learning about how to keep a fire going.

101
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:3,000
He's learning the uses for a fire,

102
0:06:31,000 --> 0:06:34,000
just by watching what we do with fire.

103
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:36,000
(Laughter)

104
0:06:43,000 --> 0:06:45,000
This is a smile on the face of a Bonobo.

105
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:47,000
These are happy vocalizations.

106
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Video: You're happy.

107
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:51,000
You're very happy about this part.

108
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:55,000
You've got to put some water on the fire. You see the water?

109
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Good job.

110
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:06,000
SS: Forgot to zip up the back half of his backpack.

111
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:09,000
But he likes to carry things from place to place.

112
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Video: Austin, I hear you saying "Austin."

113
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:15,000
SS: He talks to other Bonobos at the lab, long-distance,

114
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:17,000
farther than we can hear.

115
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:2,000
This is his sister.

116
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:23,000
This is her first time to try to drive a golf cart.

117
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Video: Goodbye.

118
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:29,000
(Laughter)

119
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:33,000
SS: She's got the pedals down, but not the wheel.

120
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:4,000
She switches from reverse to forward

121
0:07:4,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and she holds onto the wheel, rather than turns it.

122
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:45,000
(Laughter)

123
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Like us, she knows that that individual in the mirror is her.

124
0:07:5,000 --> 0:07:54,000
(Music)

125
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Video: Narrator: By raising Bonobos in a culture that is both Bonobo and human,

126
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and documenting their development across two decades,

127
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:06,000
scientists are exploring how cultural forces

128
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:07,000
(Laughter)

129
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:1,000
may have operated during human evolution.

130
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:14,000
His name is Nyota.

131
0:08:14,000 --> 0:08:16,000
It means "star" in Swahili.

132
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
(Music)

133
0:08:26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Panbanisha is trying to give Nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors.

134
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:37,000
In the wild, the parent Bonobo is known to groom its offspring.

135
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Here Panbanisha uses scissors, instead of her hands,

136
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:43,000
to groom Nyota.

137
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Very impressive.

138
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Subtle maneuvering of the hands is required

139
0:08:54,000 --> 0:08:57,000
to perform delicate tasks like this.

140
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Nyota tries to imitate Panbanisha by using the scissors himself.

141
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Realizing that Nyota might get hurt,

142
0:09:16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Panbanisha, like any human mother,

143
0:09:18,000 --> 0:09:22,000
carefully tugs to get the scissors back.

144
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:4,000
He can now cut through tough animal hide.

145
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:43,000
SS: Kanzi's learned to make stone tools.

146
0:09:43,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Video: Kanzi now makes his tools,

147
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:46,000
just as our ancestors may have made them,

148
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:48,000
two-and-a-half million years ago --

149
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:53,000
by holding the rocks in both hands, to strike one against the other.

150
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:56,000
He has learned that by using both hands

151
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and aiming his glancing blows,

152
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:02,000
he can make much larger, sharper flakes.

153
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Kanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough.

154
0:10:1,000 --> 0:10:14,000
The tough hide is difficult to cut, even with a knife.

155
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:17,000
The rock that Kanzi is using is extremely hard

156
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and ideal for stone tool making, but difficult to handle,

157
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:23,000
requiring great skill.

158
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Kanzi's rock is from Gona, Ethiopia

159
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and is identical to that used by our African ancestors

160
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:31,000
two-and-a-half million years ago.

161
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:37,000
These are the rocks Kanzi used

162
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and these are the flakes he made.

163
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:43,000
The flat sharp edges are like knife blades.

164
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Compare them to the tools our ancestors used;

165
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:5,000
they bear a striking resemblance to Kanzi's.

166
0:11:,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Panbanisha is longing to go for a walk in the woods.

167
0:11:03,000 --> 0:11:06,000
She keeps staring out the window.

168
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:11,000
SS: This is -- let me show you something we didn't think they would do.

169
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Video: For several days now, Panbanisha has not been outside.

170
0:11:17,000 --> 0:11:19,000
SS: I normally talk about language.

171
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Video: Then Panbanisha does something unexpected.

172
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:25,000
SS: But since I'm advised not to do what I normally do,

173
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:27,000
I haven't told you that these apes have language.

174
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:29,000
It's a geometric language.

175
0:11:29,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Video: She takes a piece of chalk

176
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and begins writing something on the floor.

177
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:34,000
What is she writing?

178
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:44,000
SS: She's also saying the name of that, with her voice.

179
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Video: Now she comes up to Dr. Sue and starts writing again.

180
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:5,000
SS: These are her symbols on her keyboard.

181
0:11:5,000 --> 0:11:51,000
(Music)

182
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:53,000
They speak when she touches them.

183
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Video: Panbanisha is communicating to Dr. Sue where she wants to go.

184
0:11:56,000 --> 0:12:,000
"A frame" represents a hut in the woods.

185
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Compare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard.

186
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor.

187
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:24,000
SS (video): Very nice. Beautiful, Panbanisha.

188
0:12:24,000 --> 0:12:27,000
SS: At first we didn't really realize what she was doing,

189
0:12:27,000 --> 0:12:3,000
until we stood back and looked at it and rotated it.

190
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Video: This lexigram also refers to a place in the woods.

191
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:36,000
The curved line is very similar to the lexigram.

192
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:43,000
The next symbol Panbanisha writes represents "collar."

193
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:47,000
It indicates the collar that Panbanisha must wear when she goes out.

194
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:49,000
SS: That's an institutional requirement.

195
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Video: This symbol is not as clear as the others,

196
0:12:53,000 --> 0:12:58,000
but one can see Panbanisha is trying to produce a curved line

197
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:,000
and several straight lines.

198
0:13:,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Researchers began to record what Panbanisha said,

199
0:13:04,000 --> 0:13:08,000
by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk.

200
0:13:08,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Panbanisha watched.

201
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Soon she began to write as well.

202
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:18,000
The Bonobo's abilities have stunned scientists around the world.

203
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:2,000
How did they develop?

204
0:13:2,000 --> 0:13:22,000
SS (video): We found that the most important thing

205
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:27,000
for permitting Bonobos to acquire language is not to teach them.

206
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:3,000
It's simply to use language around them,

207
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:33,000
because the driving force in language acquisition

208
0:13:33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
is to understand what others, that are important to you, are saying to you.

209
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Once you have that capacity,

210
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:43,000
the ability to produce language

211
0:13:43,000 --> 0:13:47,000
comes rather naturally and rather freely.

212
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:5,000
So we want to create an environment in which Bonobos,

213
0:13:5,000 --> 0:13:54,000
like all of the individuals with whom they are interacting --

214
0:13:54,000 --> 0:13:57,000
we want to create an environment in which they have fun,

215
0:13:57,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and an environment in which the others

216
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:02,000
are meaningful individuals for them.

217
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Narrator: This environment brings out unexpected potential

218
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:1,000
in Kanzi and Panbanisha.

219
0:14:17,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Panbanisha is enjoying playing her harmonica,

220
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:25,000
until Nyota, now one year old, steals it.

221
0:14:25,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Then he peers eagerly into his mother's mouth.

222
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Is he looking for where the sound came from?

223
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Dr. Sue thinks it's important to allow such curiosity to flourish.

224
0:14:47,000 --> 0:14:5,000
This time Panbanisha is playing the electric piano.

225
0:14:5,000 --> 0:14:53,000
She wasn't forced to learn the piano;

226
0:14:53,000 --> 0:14:57,000
she saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest.

227
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Researcher: Go ahead. Go ahead. I'm listening.

228
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Do that real fast part that you did. Yeah, that part.

229
0:15:36,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Narrator: Kanzi plays the xylophone;

230
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:43,000
using both hands he enthusiastically accompanies Dr. Sue's singing.

231
0:15:44,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Kanzi and Panbanisha

232
0:15:45,000 --> 0:15:48,000
are stimulated by this fun-filled environment,

233
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:52,000
which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities.

234
0:15:56,000 --> 0:15:58,000
(Laughter)

235
0:16:06,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Researcher: OK, now get the monsters. Get them.

236
0:16:09,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Take the cherries too.

237
0:16:12,000 --> 0:16:15,000
Now watch out, stay away from them now.

238
0:16:16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
Now you can chase them again. Time to chase them.

239
0:16:23,000 --> 0:16:26,000
Now you have to stay away. Get away.

240
0:16:26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
Run away. Run.

241
0:16:29,000 --> 0:16:33,000
Now we can chase them again. Go get them.

242
0:16:35,000 --> 0:16:36,000
Oh no!

243
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:4,000
Good Kanzi. Very good. Thank you so much.

244
0:16:44,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Narrator: None of us, Bonobo or human, can possibly even imagine?

245
0:16:57,000 --> 0:17:04,000
SS: So we have a bi-species environment, we call it a "panhomoculture."

246
0:17:04,000 --> 0:17:06,000
We're learning how to become like them.

247
0:17:06,000 --> 0:17:08,000
We're learning how to communicate with them,

248
0:17:08,000 --> 0:17:1,000
in really high-pitched tones.

249
0:17:1,000 --> 0:17:14,000
We're learning that they probably have a language in the wild.

250
0:17:14,000 --> 0:17:16,000
And they're learning to become like us.

251
0:17:16,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Because we believe that it's not biology; it's culture.

252
0:17:19,000 --> 0:17:23,000
So we're sharing tools and technology and language

253
0:17:23,000 --> 0:17:25,000
with another species.

254
0:17:25,000 --> 0:17:27,000
Thank you.

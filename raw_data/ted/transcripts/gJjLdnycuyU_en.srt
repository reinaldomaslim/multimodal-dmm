Translator: Ivana Korom Reviewer: Camille Martínez

2
0:00:00.332,000 --> 0:00:01,000
Adam Grant: What's your favorite movie?

3
0:00:02.349,000 --> 0:00:04,000
Kid 1: One of them is "Wreck-It Ralph."

4
0:00:04.889,000 --> 0:00:05,000
AG: And another?

5
0:00:06.15,000 --> 0:00:07,000
Kid 1: "Mr. Peabody and Sherman."

6
0:00:08.087,000 --> 0:00:1,000
AG: My kids have seen a lot of cartoons.

7
0:00:10.315,000 --> 0:00:11,000
Kids: A lot.

8
0:00:11.561,000 --> 0:00:12,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:13.379,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Kid 2: On the TV and in the movie theater.

10
0:00:15.728,000 --> 0:00:17,000
AG: My wife and I love animated films, too.

11
0:00:18.553,000 --> 0:00:19,000
When we were growing up,

12
0:00:19.736,000 --> 0:00:21,000
there was only one name in animated movies --

13
0:00:22.077,000 --> 0:00:23,000
(Music)

14
0:00:23.862,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Disney.

15
0:00:26.18,000 --> 0:00:29,000
For about six decades, they were pretty much the only game in town.

16
0:00:30.228,000 --> 0:00:33,000
By the mid-90s, Disney films had started to follow a formula.

17
0:00:33.903,000 --> 0:00:37,000
They would take an old story, add a few musical numbers and -- voilà! --

18
0:00:38.315,000 --> 0:00:4,000
"Pocahontas," "Hercules," "Mulan."

19
0:00:41.751,000 --> 0:00:44,000
But then, something new happened in animation.

20
0:00:44.893,000 --> 0:00:47,000
(Audio clip, "Toy Story") To infinity and beyond!

21
0:00:50.688,000 --> 0:00:53,000
AG: Pixar reinvented how you make an animated movie.

22
0:00:53.895,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Instead of drawing characters, you code them on a computer,

23
0:00:57.085,000 --> 0:01:01,000
which makes them come alive in 3-D instead of being flat and two-dimensional.

24
0:01:01.59,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I'm sure you remember Pixar's first computer-animated movie,

25
0:01:04.899,000 --> 0:01:05,000
"Toy Story."

26
0:01:06.074,000 --> 0:01:08,000
(Clip, "Toy Story") There's a snake in my boot!

27
0:01:08.314,000 --> 0:01:09,000
AG: It was a smash.

28
0:01:09.49,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Not just because the tech was cool, but also because the story was fresh.

29
0:01:12.993,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Brad Bird: It was just so vivid and funny, and the characters were original.

30
0:01:17.778,000 --> 0:01:18,000
AG: This is Brad Bird.

31
0:01:19.349,000 --> 0:01:21,000
He's a writer, animator and director.

32
0:01:21.465,000 --> 0:01:23,000
BB: They weren't doing the 10 songs

33
0:01:24.212,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and all that stuff that was getting very standard in animation at the time.

34
0:01:28.593,000 --> 0:01:31,000
AG: Pixar's first three films got multiple Oscar nominations.

35
0:01:32.268,000 --> 0:01:34,000
They grossed over a billion dollars.

36
0:01:34.569,000 --> 0:01:37,000
The studio was a perfectly calibrated hit machine.

37
0:01:38.93,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And that's when they made a strange decision:

38
0:01:41.899,000 --> 0:01:42,000
they hired Brad.

39
0:01:43.636,000 --> 0:01:45,000
He was coming off a big project that tanked.

40
0:01:46.073,000 --> 0:01:49,000
BB: "Don't make me go back there, man! Don't make me go back!"

41
0:01:49.318,000 --> 0:01:5,000
AG: And it wasn't his first failure.

42
0:01:51.08,000 --> 0:01:52,000
BB: I got fired from Disney,

43
0:01:52.778,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and I was actually fired from two of the first three jobs I held.

44
0:01:57.612,000 --> 0:01:59,000
AG: But Pixar saw promise in Brad.

45
0:01:59.957,000 --> 0:02:01,000
He came to the studio with a bold vision for a new film.

46
0:02:03.173,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And he didn't recruit the star teams who had created their earlier hits.

47
0:02:06.839,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Instead, he deliberately assembled a band of Pixar's biggest misfits.

48
0:02:11.958,000 --> 0:02:12,000
BB: Black sheep.

49
0:02:13.133,000 --> 0:02:14,000
John Walker: Disgruntled.

50
0:02:14.379,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Nicole Paradis Grindle: I say, "pirate."

51
0:02:16.335,000 --> 0:02:18,000
AG: Doesn't exactly sound like a dream team.

52
0:02:18.432,000 --> 0:02:22,000
But somehow, the movie they made together grossed over 600 million dollars,

53
0:02:22.683,000 --> 0:02:23,000
won two Oscars

54
0:02:24.2,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and was Pixar's biggest hit yet.

55
0:02:26.855,000 --> 0:02:28,000
It was ... incredible.

56
0:02:28.974,000 --> 0:02:3,000
(Multiple voices) Incredible. Incredible. Incredible.

57
0:02:32.228,000 --> 0:02:34,000
AG: The critics loved it almost as much as my kids did.

58
0:02:35.032,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Screaming) Kids: Awesome!

59
0:02:36.982,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Kid 2: I want to see it again!

60
0:02:38.452,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Kid 1: Me, too.

61
0:02:39.627,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Kids: Again! Again! Again!

62
0:02:40.918,000 --> 0:02:43,000
(Theme music)

63
0:02:47.033,000 --> 0:02:5,000
AG: I'm Adam Grant, and this is WorkLife, my podcast with TED.

64
0:02:50.683,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I'm an organizational psychologist.

65
0:02:52.708,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I study how to make work not suck.

66
0:02:56.088,000 --> 0:02:57,000
In this show,

67
0:02:57.263,000 --> 0:03:,000
I'm inviting myself inside the minds of some truly unusual people,

68
0:03:00.668,000 --> 0:03:03,000
because they've mastered something I wish everyone knew about work.

69
0:03:05.12,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Today: shake-ups, and the value of the outsiders inside your workplace.

70
0:03:13.3,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Thanks to Bonobos for sponsoring this episode.

71
0:03:22.53,000 --> 0:03:24,000
What's the best time to shake things up?

72
0:03:25.252,000 --> 0:03:28,000
In most workplaces, it happens when you're struggling.

73
0:03:28.307,000 --> 0:03:3,000
When the chips are down, you're desperate,

74
0:03:30.338,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and you have nothing to lose by taking some risks.

75
0:03:33.684,000 --> 0:03:35,000
But by then, it's often too late.

76
0:03:36.009,000 --> 0:03:38,000
You don't have the resources to run bold experiments.

77
0:03:39.509,000 --> 0:03:41,000
The evidence suggests that the best time to shake things up

78
0:03:42.303,000 --> 0:03:43,000
is actually when you're doing well.

79
0:03:44.613,000 --> 0:03:46,000
That's when you have the time, energy and freedom to innovate.

80
0:03:48.462,000 --> 0:03:51,000
But sadly, research shows that success often makes us complacent.

81
0:03:52.819,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Experts call it the "fat cat syndrome."

82
0:03:56.231,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Think about a time when you've been at the top of your game.

83
0:03:59.414,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Did you really want to embrace something radically different?

84
0:04:02.906,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Of course not.

85
0:04:04.253,000 --> 0:04:07,000
You probably became overconfident in your recipe

86
0:04:07.381,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and resistant to try new things.

87
0:04:09.886,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Take Blockbuster Video.

88
0:04:11.721,000 --> 0:04:15,000
At one point, they were apparently opening a new store every 17 hours.

89
0:04:16.497,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So they didn't see any reason to buy a little mail-order company

90
0:04:19.586,000 --> 0:04:2,000
called "Netflix."

91
0:04:21.187,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Oops!

92
0:04:23.124,000 --> 0:04:26,000
One day, the CEO of a successful company gave me that line I hate:

93
0:04:27.11,000 --> 0:04:29,000
"But that's the way we've always done it."

94
0:04:29.855,000 --> 0:04:3,000
My answer?

95
0:04:31.046,000 --> 0:04:34,000
"Blockbuster. BlackBerry. Polaroid. Toys 'R' Us.

96
0:04:35.047,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Do you want me to keep going?"

97
0:04:37.301,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So how do you shake things up before it's too late?

98
0:04:40.992,000 --> 0:04:43,000
For that, we're going to the movies.

99
0:04:44.419,000 --> 0:04:46,000
(Music)

100
0:04:47.252,000 --> 0:04:5,000
In 1999, Warner Brothers released the first animated movie

101
0:04:50.682,000 --> 0:04:51,000
directed by Brad Bird:

102
0:04:52.545,000 --> 0:04:53,000
"Iron Giant."

103
0:04:53.905,000 --> 0:04:55,000
John Walker: I remember being so excited about it.

104
0:04:56.508,000 --> 0:04:58,000
AG: This is Brad's producer, John Walker.

105
0:04:59.048,000 --> 0:05:01,000
It was the first big project for both Brad and John.

106
0:05:02.349,000 --> 0:05:05,000
On opening day, John went to see it in a big theater in Times Square.

107
0:05:06.012,000 --> 0:05:08,000
JW: And there were three people in there.

108
0:05:08.727,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And I went, "What the heck is going on?"

109
0:05:12.084,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So I spent the rest of the day just hanging around in front of the marquee

110
0:05:16.078,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and whenever anybody would come by and look at the poster,

111
0:05:18.823,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I'd go, "It's a really good movie. I'll buy your tickets."

112
0:05:21.847,000 --> 0:05:22,000
(Laughs)

113
0:05:23.053,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I probably bought, like, 10 people tickets to see it,

114
0:05:26.792,000 --> 0:05:28,000
because there was no one in the theaters, it was empty.

115
0:05:29.768,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Empty.

116
0:05:31.371,000 --> 0:05:32,000
It was just sad.

117
0:05:32.553,000 --> 0:05:33,000
AG: Ouch.

118
0:05:33.75,000 --> 0:05:35,000
JW: So I thought, that's it, that's the end of me,

119
0:05:36.243,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I'll have "The Iron Giant" on my resume and nothing more.

120
0:05:40.038,000 --> 0:05:42,000
AG: The film failed commercially.

121
0:05:42.173,000 --> 0:05:43,000
But it was wildly original.

122
0:05:44.006,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And the leaders at Pixar saw potential there.

123
0:05:46.609,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So Brad Bird and John Walker got the call from two of the studio's cofounders,

124
0:05:51.284,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Ed Catmull and Steve Jobs.

125
0:05:53.633,000 --> 0:05:54,000
JW: They go, you know,

126
0:05:54.847,000 --> 0:05:56,000
"We'll bring this bacteria in from the outside

127
0:05:57.091,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and see if it grows in the petri dish," you know.

128
0:05:59.471,000 --> 0:06:03,000
BB: They were actively choosing a guy to come up

129
0:06:04.058,000 --> 0:06:06,000
who had just made a big flop.

130
0:06:06.268,000 --> 0:06:08,000
AG: Pixar was founded on a disruptive vision.

131
0:06:08.72,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Their leaders fervently believed it was never too early

132
0:06:11.374,000 --> 0:06:13,000
to throw your own recipe out the window.

133
0:06:13.934,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Steve Jobs wanted to keep raising the bar:

134
0:06:16.323,000 --> 0:06:18,000
bigger hits, longer run times.

135
0:06:18.942,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So he picked a couple of outsiders to drive a shake-up.

136
0:06:21.898,000 --> 0:06:27,000
BB: They were feeling like, "We're in danger of falling into certain habits,

137
0:06:27.922,000 --> 0:06:29,000
because we have the same group that are doing things.

138
0:06:30.474,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And we're very proud of this group, and this group is very talented.

139
0:06:34.205,000 --> 0:06:36,000
But we want to shake things up."

140
0:06:37.101,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And they felt like whatever I was going to do,

141
0:06:40.837,000 --> 0:06:41,000
it was going to be different.

142
0:06:42.269,000 --> 0:06:44,000
JW: And so they said, "OK, well, here. Can you guys do it?

143
0:06:45.046,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Can you do it in half the time, half the money?"

144
0:06:47.34,000 --> 0:06:49,000
AG: They gave the answer you'd probably give

145
0:06:49.469,000 --> 0:06:51,000
if Steve Jobs had asked you that question.

146
0:06:51.509,000 --> 0:06:52,000
JW: Well, sure we can!

147
0:06:52.841,000 --> 0:06:53,000
(Laughter)

148
0:06:54.403,000 --> 0:06:56,000
You know? You just say you can, right?

149
0:06:56.435,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And then you try to go figure out how to do it.

150
0:06:58.966,000 --> 0:07:,000
AG: So Pixar hired John Walker and Brad Bird.

151
0:07:02.339,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Brad had been working on a new story for an animated film.

152
0:07:05.53,000 --> 0:07:07,000
It would be called "The Incredibles."

153
0:07:08.6,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And it was different than anything Pixar had ever done.

154
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
BB: Everything that the film was,

155
0:07:12.99,000 --> 0:07:16,000
was all the things that CG animation was then terrible at.

156
0:07:17.014,000 --> 0:07:19,000
It was full of humans, which,

157
0:07:19.091,000 --> 0:07:21,000
they were the weakest thing in CG animation,

158
0:07:21.835,000 --> 0:07:24,000
if you look at humans circa that time.

159
0:07:25.069,000 --> 0:07:27,000
AG: Pixar films had only had humans as minor characters.

160
0:07:28.474,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And they didn't look very convincing.

161
0:07:30.45,000 --> 0:07:32,000
To date, Pixar's movies were mostly filled with toys,

162
0:07:33.261,000 --> 0:07:34,000
monsters and talking bugs.

163
0:07:35.958,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Now, Brad was pitching a movie

164
0:07:37.541,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that would require animating a whole family of not just humans,

165
0:07:41.649,000 --> 0:07:43,000
humans with superpowers.

166
0:07:43.95,000 --> 0:07:47,000
BB: It was full of water and fire and wind

167
0:07:48.064,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and all this stuff that CG animation was no good at doing.

168
0:07:52.329,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Hair.

169
0:07:53.623,000 --> 0:07:55,000
AG: It turns out, hair was a real problem.

170
0:07:55.996,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Prior to "The Incredibles," no one had even bothered to code long hair,

171
0:07:59.523,000 --> 0:08:01,000
because it was just impossible in CG animation.

172
0:08:01.999,000 --> 0:08:05,000
BB: It's almost like everybody used a ton of hair spray before they got filmed,

173
0:08:06.388,000 --> 0:08:08,000
because the hair doesn't move much.

174
0:08:08.68,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And, you know, we were doing a film where it was part of Violet's character.

175
0:08:15.252,000 --> 0:08:17,000
AG: Violet is a member of the Incredibles family --

176
0:08:18.021,000 --> 0:08:19,000
a shy, moody teenager.

177
0:08:19.943,000 --> 0:08:22,000
(Clip, "The Incredibles") Violet: Normal? What do you know about normal?

178
0:08:23.367,000 --> 0:08:25,000
What does anyone in this family know about normal?

179
0:08:25.743,000 --> 0:08:27,000
AG: She was supposed to spend a huge part of the film

180
0:08:28.278,000 --> 0:08:3,000
covering her face with her long, black hair.

181
0:08:30.379,000 --> 0:08:32,000
JW: We'd seen these beautiful tests.

182
0:08:32.626,000 --> 0:08:33,000
AG: Producer John Walker.

183
0:08:33.842,000 --> 0:08:34,000
JW: And it was like,

184
0:08:35.018,000 --> 0:08:38,000
wow, she's shaking her head, and the hair is flowing,

185
0:08:38.547,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and it's gorgeous, and it's going to be beautiful.

186
0:08:42.196,000 --> 0:08:44,000
AG: But the tests were oversimplified.

187
0:08:44.315,000 --> 0:08:47,000
The hair moved right, but kind of looked like strips of rubber.

188
0:08:48.117,000 --> 0:08:5,000
When it was time to do the full computer animation,

189
0:08:50.704,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Violet's hair looked awful.

190
0:08:53.014,000 --> 0:08:55,000
So John asked what it would take to get it right.

191
0:08:55.419,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And he was shocked at the answer.

192
0:08:57.601,000 --> 0:08:59,000
JW: "We can't actually do the movie like that.

193
0:08:59.807,000 --> 0:09:01,000
That would take 10 years and 10 million dollars."

194
0:09:02.347,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I was like, "Then why did you show us that?"

195
0:09:05.353,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I'm trying to get myself ready

196
0:09:06.887,000 --> 0:09:08,000
to go tell Brad that we're going to cut Violet's hair.

197
0:09:09.458,000 --> 0:09:1,000
BB: "You can't do it!

198
0:09:10.8,000 --> 0:09:12,000
That's the character. She's got to have the hair!"

199
0:09:13.815,000 --> 0:09:17,000
As the film goes on, she feels enough growing self-assurance

200
0:09:18.276,000 --> 0:09:2,000
that she pulls the hair out of her face.

201
0:09:21.157,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Her hair had a story arc.

202
0:09:22.915,000 --> 0:09:23,000
(Laughter)

203
0:09:24.212,000 --> 0:09:27,000
AG: To do hair and water and all these other new images correctly,

204
0:09:27.755,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Pixar execs guessed that the film could cost half a billion dollars

205
0:09:31.109,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and take a decade to make.

206
0:09:33.3,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Brad needed some original thinking.

207
0:09:35.45,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So this unconventional director went looking for a team

208
0:09:38.365,000 --> 0:09:4,000
of unconventional recruits --

209
0:09:40.434,000 --> 0:09:42,000
the outsiders among Pixar's insiders.

210
0:09:43.411,000 --> 0:09:44,000
The black sheep.

211
0:09:44.776,000 --> 0:09:46,000
BB: They are not always the, um,

212
0:09:48.085,000 --> 0:09:51,000
smiling-est, easiest people to work with.

213
0:09:52.046,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Sometimes, theyre a little grumpy.

214
0:09:53.982,000 --> 0:09:55,000
AG: Brad, have you ever been a black sheep yourself?

215
0:09:56.982,000 --> 0:09:57,000
BB: Yeah. Yeah.

216
0:09:58.721,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Yes. Yeah.

217
0:10:00.6,000 --> 0:10:03,000
My family was kind of like the family in "The Incredibles."

218
0:10:03.966,000 --> 0:10:05,000
We had these dinners where everybody vented

219
0:10:06.057,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and said what they thought.

220
0:10:08.014,000 --> 0:10:1,000
That's the attitude that I kind of grew up in.

221
0:10:10.744,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And I found very quickly, the world doesn't work that way.

222
0:10:14.617,000 --> 0:10:15,000
AG: Brad searched Pixar's ranks

223
0:10:16.237,000 --> 0:10:18,000
for people who were frustrated with the status quo,

224
0:10:19.204,000 --> 0:10:22,000
people who had risky ideas that had been dismissed or overlooked.

225
0:10:23.736,000 --> 0:10:25,000
You might have one of those people on your team.

226
0:10:26.188,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Or maybe you're the black sheep.

227
0:10:27.879,000 --> 0:10:3,000
BB: There's a big impetus, especially with success,

228
0:10:31.768,000 --> 0:10:33,000
to repeat whatever has worked before.

229
0:10:34.363,000 --> 0:10:36,000
You know? If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

230
0:10:36.966,000 --> 0:10:38,000
But I was looking for a bunch of people

231
0:10:39.904,000 --> 0:10:42,000
that were kind of dissatisfied with the way things were.

232
0:10:44.133,000 --> 0:10:46,000
AG: Turns out, Brad was onto something.

233
0:10:46.605,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Research shows that the kind of frustration he harnessed

234
0:10:49.316,000 --> 0:10:5,000
can fuel creativity.

235
0:10:51.292,000 --> 0:10:53,000
In other words, the curmudgeons on your team

236
0:10:53.501,000 --> 0:10:55,000
could be great untapped resources.

237
0:10:56.284,000 --> 0:10:59,000
I'm sure you've seen companies hire external consultants or executives

238
0:10:59.965,000 --> 0:11:,000
to shake things up.

239
0:11:01.831,000 --> 0:11:04,000
But there's evidence that you don't have to turn to outside hires.

240
0:11:05.182,000 --> 0:11:08,000
You can go to the black sheep already working within the company.

241
0:11:08.459,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Consider one study

242
0:11:09.634,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that was done at a company that makes oil drilling equipment.

243
0:11:12.642,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Supervisors evaluated how often employees brought new and innovative ideas

244
0:11:16.717,000 --> 0:11:17,000
to the table.

245
0:11:18.395,000 --> 0:11:2,000
The employees who were rated the most creative

246
0:11:20.593,000 --> 0:11:23,000
were the ones who felt dissatisfied with their jobs.

247
0:11:24.208,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Their frustration with problems motivated them to develop fresh solutions.

248
0:11:28.763,000 --> 0:11:31,000
But dissatisfaction didn't always lead to creativity.

249
0:11:32.839,000 --> 0:11:34,000
It only helped when people felt committed to the company

250
0:11:35.49,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and had access to the feedback and support they needed.

251
0:11:38.744,000 --> 0:11:41,000
When you ignore them, disgruntled people channel their frustration

252
0:11:41.975,000 --> 0:11:44,000
in unproductive or even counterproductive directions.

253
0:11:45.76,000 --> 0:11:48,000
If you're aware they're out there, though, and you really listen to them,

254
0:11:49.427,000 --> 0:11:5,000
they can become your allies.

255
0:11:52.688,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Lisa Bodell: They always say,

256
0:11:54.126,000 --> 0:11:56,000
"Innovation is the pirate ship that sails into the yacht club."

257
0:11:57.137,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Nobody likes it, but they appreciate it later.

258
0:11:59.312,000 --> 0:12:,000
AG: This is Lisa Bodell.

259
0:12:00.487,000 --> 0:12:02,000
She spent part of her career in advertising and start-ups.

260
0:12:03.453,000 --> 0:12:06,000
LB: I came there to do really great, motivating and inspiring things,

261
0:12:06.749,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and I was spending my day just managing processes and procedures and crap.

262
0:12:10.427,000 --> 0:12:12,000
AG: Lisa got fed up with the dozens of meaningless tasks

263
0:12:13.133,000 --> 0:12:15,000
that define so many work environments.

264
0:12:15.712,000 --> 0:12:17,000
So she started a company called FutureThink

265
0:12:18.3,000 --> 0:12:2,000
to help organizations shake up the status quo.

266
0:12:21.053,000 --> 0:12:23,000
(Clip) LB: ... and ideally, walk away with things

267
0:12:23.403,000 --> 0:12:25,000
that will help you simplify your work and your life

268
0:12:26.174,000 --> 0:12:27,000
to get you moving forward.

269
0:12:27.934,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And what I thought we could do is go through about -- I don't know,

270
0:12:31.272,000 --> 0:12:32,000
500 PowerPoint slides.

271
0:12:33.147,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Does that work for you all? (Laughter)

272
0:12:35.022,000 --> 0:12:36,000
No?

273
0:12:36.225,000 --> 0:12:37,000
AG: Her big breakthrough came

274
0:12:37.66,000 --> 0:12:39,000
when she was giving a talk to a few dozen executives

275
0:12:40.151,000 --> 0:12:41,000
at a manufacturing company.

276
0:12:41.474,000 --> 0:12:43,000
LB: I realized quickly that these people didn't give a crap

277
0:12:44.297,000 --> 0:12:45,000
about what I was talking about.

278
0:12:45.894,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And so I called a break,

279
0:12:47.704,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and I said, "Listen, I'm going to shake things up."

280
0:12:50.125,000 --> 0:12:52,000
AG: She looked at all these bored executives,

281
0:12:52.252,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and told them to kill their own company.

282
0:12:55.258,000 --> 0:12:56,000
LB: I challenged each of those groups

283
0:12:57.061,000 --> 0:12:59,000
to identify who their number one competitor was.

284
0:12:59.823,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And then I said, "Pretend you're that competition.

285
0:13:02.458,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Pretend you have that hat on.

286
0:13:03.927,000 --> 0:13:05,000
I want you to put yourself out of business."

287
0:13:06.831,000 --> 0:13:07,000
I mean -- the room lit on fire.

288
0:13:08.434,000 --> 0:13:1,000
They were so excited, because I gave them permission

289
0:13:10.948,000 --> 0:13:12,000
to talk about the things that were literally verboten.

290
0:13:13.512,000 --> 0:13:16,000
It was a mindset shift as well as a business strategy shift.

291
0:13:17.014,000 --> 0:13:18,000
AG: When I heard about the exercise,

292
0:13:18.799,000 --> 0:13:2,000
I was expecting a roomful of complaints and cynicism.

293
0:13:21.974,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Then I watched it happen.

294
0:13:23.919,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And I have never seen a more energized group of leaders in my life.

295
0:13:27.974,000 --> 0:13:3,000
LB: Really what it does is give people a framework and permission

296
0:13:31.054,000 --> 0:13:33,000
to start attacking things that aren't working.

297
0:13:33.244,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And that's what's energizing to people.

298
0:13:35.412,000 --> 0:13:36,000
They don't know the difference, Adam,

299
0:13:37.261,000 --> 0:13:39,000
between being in a groove and being in a rut.

300
0:13:39.434,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And most people, when you talk about complacency, are in a rut.

301
0:13:42.482,000 --> 0:13:43,000
And until you talk to them about,

302
0:13:44.138,000 --> 0:13:46,000
"What do you wish you could change? Why are you frustrated?"

303
0:13:47.106,000 --> 0:13:48,000
they get pumped up.

304
0:13:48.434,000 --> 0:13:5,000
AG: One thing that's always fascinated me about this exercise

305
0:13:51.348,000 --> 0:13:54,000
is how different it would be if you ran it as "save the company."

306
0:13:55.371,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And I was interested in hearing

307
0:13:57.482,000 --> 0:13:59,000
what led you to the boldness of killing the company

308
0:13:59.973,000 --> 0:14:,000
rather than saving the company.

309
0:14:02.418,000 --> 0:14:04,000
LB: Save means "safe" and "preserve."

310
0:14:05.409,000 --> 0:14:07,000
You know? I think of a life preserver.

311
0:14:07.53,000 --> 0:14:09,000
"How can we keep what we have safe?"

312
0:14:09.752,000 --> 0:14:12,000
versus "How can we get rid of what we have and do things better?"

313
0:14:13.52,000 --> 0:14:16,000
It's permission to admit that things might not be right,

314
0:14:16.956,000 --> 0:14:19,000
so you can look at what's not working and make space for things that are.

315
0:14:20.575,000 --> 0:14:22,000
AG: If you were asked to kill your company,

316
0:14:22.615,000 --> 0:14:23,000
where would you start?

317
0:14:23.855,000 --> 0:14:25,000
You might begin the way Lisa does:

318
0:14:25.934,000 --> 0:14:28,000
gather some people together to give their frustration a voice.

319
0:14:29.339,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Put them on offense, not defense,

320
0:14:31.641,000 --> 0:14:33,000
by asking them to attack the problems they see.

321
0:14:34.553,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And then invite them to run with their best ideas.

322
0:14:37.632,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Lisa's approach has worked in all kinds of environments:

323
0:14:40.743,000 --> 0:14:43,000
banks, tech companies, city governments, schools.

324
0:14:45.204,000 --> 0:14:48,000
And Brad Bird did his own version of it at Pixar.

325
0:14:48.95,000 --> 0:14:52,000
BB: Pixar kind of invented a lot of the stuff

326
0:14:53.089,000 --> 0:14:55,000
that now everyone takes for granted.

327
0:14:55.577,000 --> 0:14:57,000
I mean, they were the best in the world at it.

328
0:14:58.871,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Those methods weren't going to work for our film.

329
0:15:03.177,000 --> 0:15:05,000
AG: Brad challenged the black sheep to try different solutions

330
0:15:06.139,000 --> 0:15:07,000
to their toughest animation problems,

331
0:15:07.959,000 --> 0:15:08,000
like Violet's hair.

332
0:15:09.416,000 --> 0:15:12,000
BB: They don't want to do something the way that it's always been done.

333
0:15:13.229,000 --> 0:15:16,000
For every 20 people that say, "This is how you do it,"

334
0:15:16.292,000 --> 0:15:18,000
there's usually one person going,

335
0:15:18.459,000 --> 0:15:22,000
"Uh, you don't have to do it that way. There's another way that you could do it."

336
0:15:22.617,000 --> 0:15:26,000
AG: But there was one problem that neither Brad nor John Walker had anticipated.

337
0:15:26.648,000 --> 0:15:29,000
JW: They were in different rooms, they were doing different things.

338
0:15:29.879,000 --> 0:15:32,000
AG: The technical people had been unleashed to build all these new tools.

339
0:15:33.776,000 --> 0:15:36,000
But the creative people didn't really understand how to use them.

340
0:15:37.101,000 --> 0:15:38,000
JW: Something would go wrong,

341
0:15:38.942,000 --> 0:15:4,000
an email would come from one side, going,

342
0:15:41.474,000 --> 0:15:43,000
"Hey, your simulator is broken,"

343
0:15:43.617,000 --> 0:15:45,000
over to the people that were building the simulator.

344
0:15:46.086,000 --> 0:15:47,000
And the simulator guys would write back,

345
0:15:48.033,000 --> 0:15:49,000
"No, no, no, no -- it's operator error."

346
0:15:49.982,000 --> 0:15:51,000
And they would go back and forth like that.

347
0:15:52.023,000 --> 0:15:54,000
And we'd go, "Oh, gosh. This is not working."

348
0:15:54.3,000 --> 0:15:57,000
AG: Brad and John started listening to the people on the front lines.

349
0:15:57.704,000 --> 0:15:59,000
And they suddenly realized there was a simple solution

350
0:16:00.291,000 --> 0:16:01,000
to their complex problem:

351
0:16:01.75,000 --> 0:16:04,000
put the technical people together with the animators in the same rooms.

352
0:16:05.76,000 --> 0:16:07,000
JW: As soon as that started to happen, it was like magic,

353
0:16:08.545,000 --> 0:16:1,000
because somebody would show them the problem and say,

354
0:16:11.124,000 --> 0:16:14,000
"Look what happens -- I do this, and the hair flies around the room."

355
0:16:14.419,000 --> 0:16:15,000
And the guy building the simulator goes,

356
0:16:16.396,000 --> 0:16:2,000
"Well, you've got to hit F3-7 and put this little bit of the code in there.

357
0:16:21.052,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Didn't you know that?"

358
0:16:22.242,000 --> 0:16:24,000
And they go, "No, we didn't know that!"

359
0:16:24.282,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Beautiful thing when you go after black sheep, you say,

360
0:16:27.684,000 --> 0:16:29,000
"Hey, I'll give your crazy idea a try."

361
0:16:30.474,000 --> 0:16:31,000
That's kind of where they want to go.

362
0:16:32.284,000 --> 0:16:33,000
AG: So wait, Brad --

363
0:16:33.465,000 --> 0:16:36,000
does that mean you're just trying to surround yourself constantly

364
0:16:36.569,000 --> 0:16:37,000
with angry people?

365
0:16:37.744,000 --> 0:16:39,000
BB: No, I mean, I don't want just disgruntled people.

366
0:16:40.273,000 --> 0:16:41,000
There's plenty of those,

367
0:16:41.448,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and they don't do a damn thing for anybody.

368
0:16:44.125,000 --> 0:16:46,000
I want people who are disgruntled

369
0:16:46.276,000 --> 0:16:48,000
because they have a better way of doing things

370
0:16:48.696,000 --> 0:16:51,000
and they are having trouble finding an avenue --

371
0:16:52.276,000 --> 0:16:56,000
racing cars that are just spinning their wheels in a garage

372
0:16:56.939,000 --> 0:16:57,000
rather than racing.

373
0:16:58.458,000 --> 0:17:01,000
You open that garage, and man, those people will take you somewhere.

374
0:17:02.403,000 --> 0:17:06,000
(Theme music)

375
0:17:09.22,000 --> 0:17:11,000
AG: So you've got your team of dissatisfied people.

376
0:17:11.787,000 --> 0:17:13,000
You're ready for them to shake things up.

377
0:17:13.945,000 --> 0:17:15,000
Now, how do you get them all innovating in the same direction?

378
0:17:17.708,000 --> 0:17:19,000
More on that after the break.

379
0:17:19.79,000 --> 0:17:23,000
(Theme music)

380
0:17:25.839,000 --> 0:17:27,000
OK, this is going to be a different kind of ad.

381
0:17:28.419,000 --> 0:17:31,000
I've played a personal role in selecting the sponsors for this podcast,

382
0:17:32.093,000 --> 0:17:34,000
because they all have interesting cultures of their own.

383
0:17:34.831,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Today, we're going inside the workplace at Bonobos.

384
0:17:44.993,000 --> 0:17:48,000
A few years ago, Sam Gonzalez was on an all-staff call at Bonobos,

385
0:17:49.164,000 --> 0:17:51,000
when the top boss said something that took his breath away.

386
0:17:52.054,000 --> 0:17:53,000
Sam Gonzalez: She had said,

387
0:17:53.371,000 --> 0:17:56,000
one of the things in that conference call was that we were going to embrace,

388
0:17:56.99,000 --> 0:17:59,000
in our marketing campaigns, we were going to start to think about gender identity.

389
0:18:00.895,000 --> 0:18:02,000
AG: For Sam, a guide in one of Bonobos's shops,

390
0:18:03.124,000 --> 0:18:06,000
the idea that a men's clothing brand was going to focus on gender identity

391
0:18:06.632,000 --> 0:18:07,000
wasn't just exciting;

392
0:18:07.823,000 --> 0:18:08,000
it was personal.

393
0:18:09.061,000 --> 0:18:11,000
SG: I'd worked at Bonobos for a little over a year

394
0:18:11.442,000 --> 0:18:13,000
before I figured out that I am trans and I want to transition.

395
0:18:14.403,000 --> 0:18:16,000
And that will include for me

396
0:18:16.621,000 --> 0:18:2,000
letting everyone that I work with know and everyone who comes into my life know

397
0:18:20.779,000 --> 0:18:21,000
that this is a part of who I am.

398
0:18:23.276,000 --> 0:18:24,000
AG: Sam had prepared for the worst.

399
0:18:25.34,000 --> 0:18:27,000
SG: What does it mean to transition at work?

400
0:18:27.871,000 --> 0:18:28,000
Because I had only heard horror stories.

401
0:18:29.887,000 --> 0:18:32,000
But then, once I did, I was proved 100 percent wrong.

402
0:18:33.372,000 --> 0:18:34,000
People were super open,

403
0:18:35.326,000 --> 0:18:38,000
they were incredibly caring and respectful.

404
0:18:38.8,000 --> 0:18:39,000
AG: And then, just a few months later,

405
0:18:40.64,000 --> 0:18:42,000
Sam found himself on this all-hands phone call.

406
0:18:43.543,000 --> 0:18:46,000
Micky Onvural, then the copresident and now Bonobos CEO,

407
0:18:47.417,000 --> 0:18:49,000
said the company was going to start a public conversation

408
0:18:50.14,000 --> 0:18:51,000
about gender identity.

409
0:18:51.655,000 --> 0:18:53,000
As soon as the call finished, Sam sent her an email.

410
0:18:54.489,000 --> 0:18:56,000
SG: I said, "I don't know if you know this, but I am trans,

411
0:18:57.291,000 --> 0:19:,000
and I have transitioned at Bonobos, and I've been here for a while.

412
0:19:00.479,000 --> 0:19:01,000
And you have no idea

413
0:19:01.656,000 --> 0:19:03,000
what this type of representation means to someone like me."

414
0:19:04.489,000 --> 0:19:06,000
Micky Onvural: When I first got Sam's email,

415
0:19:06.571,000 --> 0:19:08,000
I was, to be honest, completely overwhelmed.

416
0:19:08.664,000 --> 0:19:09,000
I think I probably shed a tear or two.

417
0:19:10.538,000 --> 0:19:13,000
I'm Micky Onvural, I am the CEO of Bonobos.

418
0:19:14.22,000 --> 0:19:17,000
For me, it was very touching that someone felt comfortable enough

419
0:19:17.363,000 --> 0:19:19,000
to be able to tell me that personal story.

420
0:19:20.284,000 --> 0:19:21,000
AG: Think about how rare that is,

421
0:19:21.958,000 --> 0:19:25,000
for a junior employee to feel comfortable emailing someone that high up.

422
0:19:26.053,000 --> 0:19:27,000
I almost never see it,

423
0:19:27.506,000 --> 0:19:3,000
even though I spend a lot of time encouraging senior leaders to be open.

424
0:19:31.278,000 --> 0:19:34,000
At Bonobos, Micky wasn't just receptive to new ideas from below,

425
0:19:34.659,000 --> 0:19:35,000
she actively encouraged them.

426
0:19:36.548,000 --> 0:19:38,000
SG: ... and I had talked a little bit about, in my email,

427
0:19:39.262,000 --> 0:19:4,000
that I had met Chris Mosier,

428
0:19:40.728,000 --> 0:19:43,000
and I think that he would be a fantastic person for us to highlight.

429
0:19:44.482,000 --> 0:19:47,000
MO: The first thing I did, I forwarded it on to our production team,

430
0:19:48.23,000 --> 0:19:5,000
and I said, "Sam's just had this amazing idea

431
0:19:50.364,000 --> 0:19:53,000
of us bringing Chris Mosier in and shooting him in our clothes.

432
0:19:54.157,000 --> 0:19:55,000
Let's do it."

433
0:19:55.641,000 --> 0:19:59,000
AG: Chris Mosier was part of the American men's duathlon team in 2016.

434
0:20:00.086,000 --> 0:20:04,000
That made him the first openly transgender athlete to compete for Team USA.

435
0:20:04.118,000 --> 0:20:06,000
SG: Chris was one of the first people that I saw

436
0:20:06.555,000 --> 0:20:09,000
that made me feel like being trans is a thing,

437
0:20:10.275,000 --> 0:20:12,000
and you can do it, and you can transition and you can be happy.

438
0:20:13.269,000 --> 0:20:16,000
AG: So Sam made a pitch for Bonobos to feature Chris in a commercial.

439
0:20:17.339,000 --> 0:20:2,000
Chris Mosier: For a men's clothing company to say,

440
0:20:20.627,000 --> 0:20:23,000
trans men are men and can be a part of our campaign,

441
0:20:24.372,000 --> 0:20:26,000
to me, personally, was a big deal.

442
0:20:26.952,000 --> 0:20:27,000
AG: That's Chris.

443
0:20:28.15,000 --> 0:20:31,000
A few months later, Bonobos launched a commercial that featured him.

444
0:20:31.99,000 --> 0:20:33,000
CM: It was sort of what I was searching for when I was younger.

445
0:20:34.974,000 --> 0:20:38,000
Like, if I would have seen out trans men being a part of men's campaigns,

446
0:20:39.09,000 --> 0:20:43,000
being a part of men's fashion magazines or commercials on TV,

447
0:20:43.547,000 --> 0:20:45,000
that are talking about men and masculinity,

448
0:20:45.872,000 --> 0:20:49,000
I think that my trajectory would have been drastically different as a person.

449
0:20:50.717,000 --> 0:20:52,000
AG: So, Sam, as you reflect on this whole experience

450
0:20:53.262,000 --> 0:20:57,000
of first transitioning at work and then bringing on Chris as a spokesperson,

451
0:20:57.371,000 --> 0:20:58,000
how does that make you feel?

452
0:20:58.776,000 --> 0:21:,000
SG: There's not really a word to describe it.

453
0:21:00.942,000 --> 0:21:02,000
I think "awesome" is too small of a word.

454
0:21:03.458,000 --> 0:21:04,000
AG: Awesome is too small a word.

455
0:21:05.347,000 --> 0:21:06,000
I like that.

456
0:21:06.546,000 --> 0:21:09,000
And I like the idea that big ideas can come from anywhere in a company,

457
0:21:10.079,000 --> 0:21:12,000
as long as there's support at the top.

Bonobos makes great clothes that can fit every guy.

Ordering on their website is easy, they ship fast,

0:21:43.435,000 --> 0:21:45,000
When you're gathering a group of people for a major shake-up,

466
0:21:46.382,000 --> 0:21:47,000
how do you motivate them?

467
0:21:48.069,000 --> 0:21:51,000
Your first instinct is probably to inspire them.

468
0:21:51.474,000 --> 0:21:53,000
(Clip, "Apollo 13") We never lost an American in space,

469
0:21:54.099,000 --> 0:21:56,000
we're sure as hell not gonna lose one on my watch.

470
0:21:56.489,000 --> 0:21:57,000
Failure is not an option!

471
0:21:57.712,000 --> 0:21:59,000
(Clip, "The Golden Age") Let them come with the armies of hell!

472
0:22:00.724,000 --> 0:22:02,000
They will not pass! (Cheers)

473
0:22:03.035,000 --> 0:22:04,000
(Clip, "The Waterboy") You can do it!

474
0:22:05.323,000 --> 0:22:07,000
AG: If you're working with a bunch of disgruntled black sheep,

475
0:22:08.268,000 --> 0:22:1,000
you'll feel especially compelled to convey confidence,

476
0:22:10.871,000 --> 0:22:11,000
show enthusiasm

477
0:22:12.347,000 --> 0:22:15,000
and make sure they don't get discouraged by the sheer difficulty of the task.

478
0:22:16.856,000 --> 0:22:18,000
But if you're Brad Bird and you're making "The Incredibles,"

479
0:22:19.714,000 --> 0:22:2,000
you do the exact opposite.

480
0:22:22.348,000 --> 0:22:25,000
Brad told his team no one thought they could pull it off.

481
0:22:25.912,000 --> 0:22:29,000
Nicole Paradis Grindle: That's the kind of challenge that lights a fuse in Brad.

482
0:22:30.04,000 --> 0:22:32,000
And that's how he leads our teams.

483
0:22:32.853,000 --> 0:22:34,000
AG: This is Nicole Paradis Grindle.

484
0:22:35.53,000 --> 0:22:37,000
She's been a producer at Pixar since the mid-90s.

485
0:22:38.703,000 --> 0:22:4,000
When Nicole joined "The Incredibles" team,

486
0:22:40.807,000 --> 0:22:42,000
they'd been struggling with the animation for about a year.

487
0:22:43.609,000 --> 0:22:45,000
NPG: I was working with the engineers

488
0:22:45.801,000 --> 0:22:48,000
who were trying to figure out how to do the hair and the cloth.

489
0:22:49.014,000 --> 0:22:52,000
And they were saying it was impossible, Brad was asking for too much ...

490
0:22:52.816,000 --> 0:22:54,000
And they just kept saying, "Nope, nope, nope, we can't do it."

491
0:22:55.771,000 --> 0:22:58,000
They were trying, and the stuff they were producing looked terrible.

492
0:22:59.855,000 --> 0:23:01,000
We have these crew meetings once a week,

493
0:23:02.593,000 --> 0:23:06,000
so everyone's wandering in first thing in the morning with their coffee,

494
0:23:06.86,000 --> 0:23:09,000
piling into this big theater that we have.

495
0:23:10.225,000 --> 0:23:13,000
And he gets up in front of this room of people,

496
0:23:13.328,000 --> 0:23:17,000
and he just starts yelling and telling them,

497
0:23:17.906,000 --> 0:23:19,000
"They think we can't do this!

498
0:23:19.958,000 --> 0:23:22,000
They think we're too slow, they think we're not good enough!

499
0:23:23.125,000 --> 0:23:25,000
I'm telling you, we're going to do this!"

500
0:23:25.157,000 --> 0:23:28,000
You know? And people love it -- I mean, it's this pep rally.

501
0:23:29.331,000 --> 0:23:31,000
AG: What Brad did by instinct is actually backed by evidence.

502
0:23:32.601,000 --> 0:23:35,000
If you want to motivate black sheep, give them a battle to fight,

503
0:23:35.953,000 --> 0:23:36,000
a particular kind of battle.

504
0:23:38.255,000 --> 0:23:43,000
BB: One thing that is very effective is to find a common enemy.

505
0:23:43.609,000 --> 0:23:45,000
But the enemy doesn't have to be a person.

506
0:23:46.323,000 --> 0:23:47,000
It can be a mindset.

507
0:23:48.165,000 --> 0:23:5,000
It can be a presumption.

508
0:23:50.696,000 --> 0:23:53,000
It can be a system that doesn't want to change.

509
0:23:54.704,000 --> 0:23:57,000
It can even be something like a trend in movies

510
0:23:57.888,000 --> 0:24:,000
that is just making movies stupider.

511
0:24:00.964,000 --> 0:24:01,000
You can make that the enemy.

512
0:24:02.916,000 --> 0:24:04,000
And you can put it up in front of people and say,

513
0:24:05.876,000 --> 0:24:08,000
"You know what I don't like? I don't like X.

514
0:24:09.289,000 --> 0:24:14,000
And here's how I think we can not do this thing that everyone is doing

515
0:24:15.092,000 --> 0:24:17,000
and really dazzle the audience."

516
0:24:18.402,000 --> 0:24:19,000
And people like that,

517
0:24:19.675,000 --> 0:24:21,000
because you're putting them on the pirate ship.

518
0:24:23.133,000 --> 0:24:26,000
You're not going with the well-funded, safe routes.

519
0:24:26.744,000 --> 0:24:29,000
You're kind of striking your sails in a storm.

520
0:24:30.014,000 --> 0:24:31,000
And you're OK with it.

521
0:24:31.834,000 --> 0:24:33,000
That fires people up, you know?

522
0:24:34.183,000 --> 0:24:35,000
It fires me up.

523
0:24:35.937,000 --> 0:24:37,000
Samir Nurmohamed: It sounds like in that moment,

524
0:24:38.284,000 --> 0:24:41,000
Brad was shaping how his team perceived those outside of their team

525
0:24:41.561,000 --> 0:24:44,000
and basically framed those individuals as critics or naysayers.

526
0:24:44.617,000 --> 0:24:46,000
AG: This is Samir Nurmohamed, my colleague at Wharton.

527
0:24:47.915,000 --> 0:24:5,000
He studies what happens when we're cast in the role of underdog.

528
0:24:51.471,000 --> 0:24:54,000
SN: Stories of underdogs and favorites permeate societies:

529
0:24:54.773,000 --> 0:24:56,000
David versus Goliath, Horatio Alger,

530
0:24:57.482,000 --> 0:24:59,000
Ivan the Fool in Russian literature.

531
0:24:59.966,000 --> 0:25:02,000
You see these examples of underdogs going from rags to riches

532
0:25:03.807,000 --> 0:25:05,000
or performing against others' low expectations,

533
0:25:06.129,000 --> 0:25:07,000
across the world.

534
0:25:07.887,000 --> 0:25:09,000
AG: An underdog isn't a kind of person.

535
0:25:10.522,000 --> 0:25:12,000
It's a mindset that can help you approach problems

536
0:25:12.893,000 --> 0:25:13,000
the way black sheep do.

537
0:25:14.658,000 --> 0:25:15,000
You can position people as underdogs

538
0:25:16.42,000 --> 0:25:18,000
by telling them they're not expected to succeed.

539
0:25:19.046,000 --> 0:25:2,000
And surprisingly,

540
0:25:20.307,000 --> 0:25:23,000
the uphill battle is often the one that people are most excited to fight.

541
0:25:25.006,000 --> 0:25:28,000
In a study with job seekers who had faced discrimination in their careers,

542
0:25:28.625,000 --> 0:25:3,000
Samir randomly assigned some of them to tell a story

543
0:25:31.145,000 --> 0:25:33,000
about how they had been underdogs against the odds.

544
0:25:34.236,000 --> 0:25:37,000
It almost doubled their chances of landing a job in the following month.

545
0:25:38.132,000 --> 0:25:41,000
SN: You actually experience more efficacy and more confidence to do well,

546
0:25:42.125,000 --> 0:25:44,000
and it leads to higher performance.

547
0:25:45.553,000 --> 0:25:46,000
AG: In another study,

548
0:25:46.744,000 --> 0:25:49,000
Samir had people fill out a survey about their negotiating style.

549
0:25:49.95,000 --> 0:25:51,000
Then he told them that, based on their results,

550
0:25:52.218,000 --> 0:25:55,000
he had calculated the probability of their success in a negotiation.

551
0:25:55.712,000 --> 0:25:57,000
He told some participants they were the favorites;

552
0:25:58.391,000 --> 0:25:59,000
some, they were evenly matched;

553
0:26:00.149,000 --> 0:26:02,000
and told others that they were the underdogs.

554
0:26:03.585,000 --> 0:26:06,000
SN: The underdog actually ended up reaching the more creative solution.

555
0:26:07.093,000 --> 0:26:09,000
People who were told that they couldn't succeed

556
0:26:09.934,000 --> 0:26:1,000
actually ended up performing better.

557
0:26:11.934,000 --> 0:26:12,000
And the reason for this

558
0:26:13.181,000 --> 0:26:16,000
is that they essentially wanted to prove the researchers wrong.

559
0:26:16.235,000 --> 0:26:19,000
AG: The favorites had nothing to prove. They got complacent.

560
0:26:19.3,000 --> 0:26:22,000
The underdogs were driven to show they had been misjudged,

561
0:26:22.808,000 --> 0:26:24,000
which happens in all kinds of jobs.

562
0:26:25.244,000 --> 0:26:27,000
Even Michael Jordan motivated himself this way.

563
0:26:28.069,000 --> 0:26:3,000
SN: Even in his Hall of Fame induction speech,

564
0:26:30.506,000 --> 0:26:32,000
when the world came out to celebrate with him,

565
0:26:32.704,000 --> 0:26:35,000
he was calling out his school coach who chose another player over him

566
0:26:36.53,000 --> 0:26:39,000
and how this fueled his motivation to prove them wrong.

567
0:26:39.641,000 --> 0:26:42,000
What's remarkable is that Jordan was talking about being underestimated

568
0:26:43.236,000 --> 0:26:47,000
after being universally recognized as not only the greatest basketball player ever,

569
0:26:47.276,000 --> 0:26:49,000
but as one of the greatest athletes of all time.

570
0:26:50.038,000 --> 0:26:54,000
Jordan was still constructing that perception of being underestimated

571
0:26:54.228,000 --> 0:26:56,000
and using that as motivation to prove others wrong.

572
0:26:57.276,000 --> 0:26:59,000
AG: But before you start cutting down all your colleagues

573
0:26:59.998,000 --> 0:27:,000
in the name of motivation,

574
0:27:01.45,000 --> 0:27:03,000
keep in mind that there's a wrong way to do it.

575
0:27:03.8,000 --> 0:27:05,000
SN: This doesn't mean you go around the workplace

576
0:27:06.181,000 --> 0:27:07,000
telling everyone that they can't succeed.

577
0:27:08.204,000 --> 0:27:1,000
That's not the way to instill this motivation.

578
0:27:10.396,000 --> 0:27:12,000
As a person in this position who's seen as an underdog,

579
0:27:13.022,000 --> 0:27:16,000
you have to feel like you have the capabilities to succeed.

580
0:27:16.294,000 --> 0:27:17,000
AG: For the underdog approach to work,

581
0:27:18.144,000 --> 0:27:2,000
the low expectations need to come from the right messenger,

582
0:27:21.017,000 --> 0:27:22,000
a natural adversary.

583
0:27:22.58,000 --> 0:27:26,000
SN: When a really credible person tells you you can't succeed,

584
0:27:26.752,000 --> 0:27:3,000
in some sense, you basically internalize those expectations, your confidence drops,

585
0:27:31.244,000 --> 0:27:34,000
you actually believe them, and you don't perform as successfully.

586
0:27:34.792,000 --> 0:27:35,000
On the other hand,

587
0:27:36.014,000 --> 0:27:39,000
when you receive low expectations from someone who's not seen as credible,

588
0:27:39.704,000 --> 0:27:42,000
you perceive them as really incompetent or not knowledgeable

589
0:27:43.014,000 --> 0:27:45,000
about either the domain that you're performing in

590
0:27:45.466,000 --> 0:27:47,000
or your own abilities.

591
0:27:47.704,000 --> 0:27:5,000
This is what sparks that desire to prove others wrong.

592
0:27:50.903,000 --> 0:27:52,000
AG: So if you're rallying salespeople,

593
0:27:53.085,000 --> 0:27:57,000
you can emphasize that R&D doesn't think they can hit their targets.

594
0:27:57.529,000 --> 0:27:59,000
And if you're trying to motivate technical or creative people,

595
0:28:00.482,000 --> 0:28:03,000
you can tell them they're being doubted by a bunch of suits.

596
0:28:03.656,000 --> 0:28:05,000
NPG: That's what those black sheep probably are looking for,

597
0:28:06.578,000 --> 0:28:08,000
is an opportunity to show what they can do.

598
0:28:08.784,000 --> 0:28:12,000
AG: Pixar producer Nicole Grindle saw Brad's underdog gambit pay off.

599
0:28:13.131,000 --> 0:28:16,000
The black sheep at the studio felt the naysayers had no business

600
0:28:16.306,000 --> 0:28:17,000
judging their abilities --

601
0:28:18.004,000 --> 0:28:2,000
or the new animation techniques they were about to invent.

602
0:28:20.837,000 --> 0:28:22,000
NPG: The idea that we're proving folks wrong,

603
0:28:23.338,000 --> 0:28:25,000
I think, is the prime motivator.

604
0:28:26.117,000 --> 0:28:29,000
I mean, of course, we want to make a great film and a great story,

605
0:28:29.252,000 --> 0:28:3,000
and that's a given.

606
0:28:30.432,000 --> 0:28:33,000
But proving that, you know,

607
0:28:33.561,000 --> 0:28:38,000
proving to the man that we're better than they think we are --

608
0:28:38.807,000 --> 0:28:39,000
that's exciting.

609
0:28:40.506,000 --> 0:28:42,000
And that's what folks in this industry live to do,

610
0:28:43.388,000 --> 0:28:45,000
is, you know, act in that kind of a story.

611
0:28:46.014,000 --> 0:28:47,000
(Laughs)

612
0:28:47.673,000 --> 0:28:49,000
AG: The last step for energizing your shake-up team

613
0:28:50.181,000 --> 0:28:52,000
is to calibrate the degree of difficulty.

614
0:28:53.085,000 --> 0:28:55,000
How challenging should the goal be?

615
0:28:55.942,000 --> 0:28:57,000
BB: I think you always have the impossible task,

616
0:28:58.347,000 --> 0:29:03,000
because basically, to do really good work is hard.

617
0:29:03.482,000 --> 0:29:07,000
And if you're doing it right, you are kind of an underdog.

618
0:29:07.919,000 --> 0:29:1,000
You should be shooting for something that's out of reach.

619
0:29:11.292,000 --> 0:29:14,000
And maybe you don't hit it,

620
0:29:15.085,000 --> 0:29:16,000
but at the end of it,

621
0:29:16.704,000 --> 0:29:19,000
if you are reaching for something that's beyond your reach,

622
0:29:20.006,000 --> 0:29:24,000
you're probably going to extend your reach from your previous work.

623
0:29:24.458,000 --> 0:29:26,000
AG: In psychology, we call that kind of reach

624
0:29:26.585,000 --> 0:29:27,000
a "just-manageable difficulty."

625
0:29:28.593,000 --> 0:29:3,000
It's a challenge that tests and stretches your skills

626
0:29:31.099,000 --> 0:29:33,000
to the very edge of what you think is possible.

627
0:29:34.284,000 --> 0:29:35,000
It has to be tough,

628
0:29:35.744,000 --> 0:29:37,000
but it can't set you up for certain failure, either.

629
0:29:38.934,000 --> 0:29:4,000
As Pixar producer John Walker puts it:

630
0:29:41.379,000 --> 0:29:42,000
JW: Sometimes you have to swim upstream.

631
0:29:43.378,000 --> 0:29:45,000
Sometimes, you have to swim upstream.

632
0:29:45.458,000 --> 0:29:49,000
But if you swim upstream too long,

633
0:29:49.919,000 --> 0:29:51,000
something is probably wrong.

634
0:29:52.792,000 --> 0:29:56,000
(Music)

635
0:29:57.518,000 --> 0:30:,000
AG: OK, I came away from Pixar convinced that to shake things up,

636
0:30:01.24,000 --> 0:30:05,000
it can help to recruit the people you'd least expect -- frustrated people --

637
0:30:05.482,000 --> 0:30:06,000
and listen to them.

638
0:30:07.165,000 --> 0:30:09,000
Then motivate them by making them into underdogs,

639
0:30:09.546,000 --> 0:30:11,000
against the odds or a difficult enemy.

640
0:30:12.77,000 --> 0:30:14,000
But I was curious about whether this could all work

641
0:30:15.214,000 --> 0:30:17,000
in a place that's the total opposite of Pixar:

642
0:30:18.325,000 --> 0:30:19,000
the ultimate bureaucracy,

643
0:30:20.532,000 --> 0:30:22,000
an environment where strict orders are followed,

644
0:30:22.99,000 --> 0:30:24,000
old traditions crush new technologies,

645
0:30:25.569,000 --> 0:30:27,000
and creativity isn't just not rewarded,

646
0:30:28.02,000 --> 0:30:3,000
it's sometimes actively punished.

647
0:30:30.117,000 --> 0:30:31,000
(Clip) Recruit training,

648
0:30:31.712,000 --> 0:30:33,000
where a man is taught the basic skills for the sea.

649
0:30:34.712,000 --> 0:30:35,000
AG: The US Navy.

650
0:30:36.46,000 --> 0:30:38,000
(Clip, old recruitment ad) He learns to be part of the team.

651
0:30:39.334,000 --> 0:30:4,000
He learns where he might fit in.

652
0:30:41.276,000 --> 0:30:43,000
AG: A few years ago, a military general told me

653
0:30:43.609,000 --> 0:30:46,000
that if I wanted to understand innovation in the armed forces,

654
0:30:47.078,000 --> 0:30:5,000
I had to talk to a junior naval officer named Ben Kohlmann.

655
0:30:50.626,000 --> 0:30:52,000
Ben Kohlmann: My grandfather was a World War II aviator,

656
0:30:53.276,000 --> 0:30:58,000
and my great uncle was an Air Force pilot who was shot down over Vietnam

657
0:30:58.927,000 --> 0:31:03,000
and spent five years in the Hanoi Hilton with John McCain and Jim Stockdale.

658
0:31:04.018,000 --> 0:31:06,000
And those stories infused my upbringing.

659
0:31:06.911,000 --> 0:31:08,000
And I wanted to be leading carrier battle fleets

660
0:31:09.3,000 --> 0:31:12,000
against whoever was attacking the United States.

661
0:31:12.347,000 --> 0:31:15,000
AG: So I was surprised to hear Ben's colleagues call him a black sheep,

662
0:31:16.131,000 --> 0:31:17,000
a rabble-rouser,

663
0:31:17.687,000 --> 0:31:18,000
a troublemaker.

664
0:31:18.933,000 --> 0:31:2,000
BK: "Troublemaker" is an amusing term for me,

665
0:31:21.084,000 --> 0:31:23,000
and I think my parents would get a kick out of that.

666
0:31:23.565,000 --> 0:31:26,000
AG: Do you think you are one, though? Or you became one in the Navy?

667
0:31:26.804,000 --> 0:31:27,000
BK: I think I became a troublemaker

668
0:31:28.526,000 --> 0:31:31,000
in the sense of challenging established wisdom.

669
0:31:32.235,000 --> 0:31:35,000
AG: Ben may have been a sailor, but he didn't start out as a pirate.

670
0:31:35.911,000 --> 0:31:37,000
BK: I was in a fraternity that was known for its parties

671
0:31:38.633,000 --> 0:31:4,000
but was the guy doing risk management on the outside,

672
0:31:41.149,000 --> 0:31:42,000
making sure nothing too crazy went down.

673
0:31:43.125,000 --> 0:31:46,000
AG: Ben became a naval aviator, just like the pilots in "Top Gun."

674
0:31:46.794,000 --> 0:31:48,000
(Music from "Top Gun")

675
0:31:49.22,000 --> 0:31:52,000
Their call signs were "Maverick" and "Iceman."

676
0:31:54.021,000 --> 0:31:55,000
BK: My call sign was "Professor,"

677
0:31:56.005,000 --> 0:31:58,000
because I had this habit of reading long books

678
0:31:58.442,000 --> 0:31:59,000
like "The American History of Law"

679
0:32:00.314,000 --> 0:32:01,000
and listening to classical music.

680
0:32:02.149,000 --> 0:32:04,000
AG: When Ben flew missions as a naval pilot,

681
0:32:04.252,000 --> 0:32:06,000
he had a huge amount of autonomy.

682
0:32:06.379,000 --> 0:32:1,000
BK: Being a 27-year-old who's leading two $65 million jets

683
0:32:11.099,000 --> 0:32:13,000
with, you know, 400- or 500-pound bombs,

684
0:32:13.361,000 --> 0:32:17,000
this is an incredible amount of responsibility on a daily basis.

685
0:32:18.198,000 --> 0:32:19,000
You were the on-scene commander.

686
0:32:20.212,000 --> 0:32:22,000
AG: But when Ben came back from overseas deployment,

687
0:32:22.696,000 --> 0:32:23,000
he started getting frustrated --

688
0:32:24.601,000 --> 0:32:26,000
frustrated that people were getting rewarded

689
0:32:26.728,000 --> 0:32:28,000
based on seniority instead of performance,

690
0:32:29.616,000 --> 0:32:32,000
frustrated that people were getting promoted for conformity

691
0:32:32.743,000 --> 0:32:33,000
instead of original thinking,

692
0:32:34.719,000 --> 0:32:36,000
frustrated that a field-tested combat pilot

693
0:32:37.386,000 --> 0:32:39,000
couldn't even have a beer on a Friday night

694
0:32:39.434,000 --> 0:32:41,000
without seeking approval from a senior commander.

695
0:32:42.149,000 --> 0:32:44,000
BK: You know, there's five or six levels of approval.

696
0:32:44.696,000 --> 0:32:46,000
Even if the first four people say yes,

697
0:32:47.509,000 --> 0:32:49,000
it only takes one veto to kill an idea.

698
0:32:49.673,000 --> 0:32:51,000
And so that becomes very discouraging,

699
0:32:52.244,000 --> 0:32:54,000
and you stop caring to some extent.

700
0:32:54.902,000 --> 0:32:56,000
AG: So Ben wrote an essay for a military news site.

701
0:32:57.617,000 --> 0:32:58,000
He explained his frustration

702
0:32:59.098,000 --> 0:33:02,000
and challenged the Navy to start supporting and promoting junior people

703
0:33:02.483,000 --> 0:33:03,000
with disruptive ideas.

704
0:33:04.212,000 --> 0:33:07,000
Piping up like that is sort of not done in the military.

705
0:33:08.441,000 --> 0:33:1,000
BK: And I said some pretty intemperate things,

706
0:33:10.618,000 --> 0:33:11,000
if I'm reflecting on it.

707
0:33:11.839,000 --> 0:33:13,000
But it got the attention of a lot of senior officials

708
0:33:14.395,000 --> 0:33:16,000
who were aghast that I would write something like this.

709
0:33:17.006,000 --> 0:33:19,000
AG: But some leaders were open to Ben's perspective.

710
0:33:19.99,000 --> 0:33:22,000
A Navy admiral was setting up something called a "rapid innovation cell."

711
0:33:23.958,000 --> 0:33:24,000
And he asked Ben to direct it.

712
0:33:27.64,000 --> 0:33:3,000
Now, to give you a sense for how slowly the Navy adopts new technologies,

713
0:33:31.641,000 --> 0:33:34,000
some of their computers are still running Windows 95.

714
0:33:35.018,000 --> 0:33:36,000
(Windows 95 "Ta-da!" sound)

715
0:33:36.427,000 --> 0:33:37,000
Yet, over the next year,

716
0:33:38.128,000 --> 0:33:41,000
Ben's rapid innovation cell succeeded in getting 3-D printers

717
0:33:41.668,000 --> 0:33:42,000
installed on ships.

718
0:33:43.45,000 --> 0:33:45,000
They also tested a robot fish,

719
0:33:45.538,000 --> 0:33:49,000
affectionately named "Silent Nemo," for stealth underwater missions.

720
0:33:50.294,000 --> 0:33:52,000
It looks like a tuna, in case you were wondering.

721
0:33:54.244,000 --> 0:33:57,000
Ben fueled these advances with the same strategies we saw at Pixar.

722
0:33:58.554,000 --> 0:34:,000
His first step was to recruit black sheep.

723
0:34:01.577,000 --> 0:34:04,000
Many of them had been disciplined for insubordination,

724
0:34:04.704,000 --> 0:34:06,000
like one guy who was fired from a nuclear submarine

725
0:34:07.451,000 --> 0:34:08,000
for disobeying an order.

726
0:34:08.92,000 --> 0:34:11,000
BK: It ended up being one of the key innovation catalysts.

727
0:34:12.664,000 --> 0:34:13,000
AG: How did you find them?

728
0:34:14.217,000 --> 0:34:16,000
Was that a signal that you were deliberately looking for?

729
0:34:16.974,000 --> 0:34:18,000
"Let me just find a bunch of people who are pissed off."

730
0:34:19.649,000 --> 0:34:2,000
BK: Yeah. (Laughs)

731
0:34:20.831,000 --> 0:34:25,000
If you had the guts and the willingness to put your name onto an idea

732
0:34:26.735,000 --> 0:34:27,000
and publish it,

733
0:34:27.912,000 --> 0:34:29,000
that already set you apart from the crowd.

734
0:34:30.157,000 --> 0:34:34,000
And disruptors, while they're lone wolves to some extent,

735
0:34:34.728,000 --> 0:34:35,000
they also find each other,

736
0:34:36.485,000 --> 0:34:39,000
whether it's in the cubicle next door or the building across the way

737
0:34:40.311,000 --> 0:34:41,000
or even across the country.

738
0:34:41.632,000 --> 0:34:44,000
AG: Second, Ben gathered them together to really listen to their frustrations,

739
0:34:45.355,000 --> 0:34:46,000
rather than squash them.

740
0:34:47.616,000 --> 0:34:49,000
BK: One of the phrases that really makes me angry

741
0:34:50.112,000 --> 0:34:51,000
is when senior leaders say,

742
0:34:52.034,000 --> 0:34:53,000
"If you have a problem,

743
0:34:53.411,000 --> 0:34:55,000
don't tell it to me unless you have a solution."

744
0:34:55.812,000 --> 0:34:57,000
Oftentimes, junior people have lots of problems

745
0:34:58.481,000 --> 0:34:59,000
they don't know the solutions to,

746
0:35:00.096,000 --> 0:35:01,000
and they need guidance.

747
0:35:01.278,000 --> 0:35:04,000
This is untapped energy that's just waiting to be unleashed.

748
0:35:05.108,000 --> 0:35:08,000
AG: Third, Ben rallied them around a common enemy,

749
0:35:08.204,000 --> 0:35:09,000
in this case, middle managers.

750
0:35:10.593,000 --> 0:35:12,000
BK: We had this mismatch between senior officers,

751
0:35:12.919,000 --> 0:35:15,000
who really and truly wanted the crazy ideas,

752
0:35:16.3,000 --> 0:35:2,000
with those below them who had a mandate to slow those things down.

753
0:35:21.266,000 --> 0:35:23,000
And if we didn't get their approval,

754
0:35:23.426,000 --> 0:35:26,000
then we just jumped ahead of them to their senior,

755
0:35:26.638,000 --> 0:35:27,000
who usually was in our favor.

756
0:35:28.465,000 --> 0:35:31,000
And you can use the bureaucracy against itself in this sense,

757
0:35:31.839,000 --> 0:35:33,000
because people will always fall in line.

758
0:35:36.204,000 --> 0:35:39,000
AG: In Ben's view, the lasting impact of his work was in demonstrating

759
0:35:39.77,000 --> 0:35:42,000
that this kind of innovation could be fueled from the bottom up,

760
0:35:43.315,000 --> 0:35:45,000
by black sheep inside the Navy.

761
0:35:46.172,000 --> 0:35:49,000
They planted seeds for dozens of other rapid innovation cells

762
0:35:49.25,000 --> 0:35:5,000
across the military.

763
0:35:50.704,000 --> 0:35:54,000
BK: And so for me, the greatest success is the mindset that it created

764
0:35:55.19,000 --> 0:35:57,000
within a very bureaucratic organization:

765
0:35:57.728,000 --> 0:36:01,000
to take charge, to empower people to run with an idea

766
0:36:02.594,000 --> 0:36:04,000
and build a community of support around that

767
0:36:05.585,000 --> 0:36:09,000
and do it regardless of whether or not you had official support.

768
0:36:14.132,000 --> 0:36:16,000
AG: Alright, as much as I love this whole recipe,

769
0:36:16.915,000 --> 0:36:18,000
I have one little problem with it.

770
0:36:18.95,000 --> 0:36:19,000
You can only use it once.

771
0:36:21.274,000 --> 0:36:23,000
If you succeed, people aren't underdogs anymore.

772
0:36:24.898,000 --> 0:36:25,000
That was Brad Bird's big challenge

773
0:36:26.582,000 --> 0:36:29,000
when it came time to make a sequel to "The Incredibles."

774
0:36:29.795,000 --> 0:36:31,000
This time, the team was stacked with hit makers.

775
0:36:32.533,000 --> 0:36:33,000
There was no common enemy.

776
0:36:34.287,000 --> 0:36:37,000
And they had three and a half years to make the film.

777
0:36:37.461,000 --> 0:36:4,000
It seems like it would have been harder to frame the crew as underdogs,

778
0:36:40.834,000 --> 0:36:42,000
given how remarkably successful the original movie was.

779
0:36:43.509,000 --> 0:36:45,000
BB: Except that they took a year off of our schedule.

780
0:36:46.486,000 --> 0:36:48,000
And suddenly, we're the underdogs again.

781
0:36:48.542,000 --> 0:36:5,000
We had a hell of a mountain to climb

782
0:36:51.151,000 --> 0:36:54,000
that in many ways was taller than our first one.

783
0:36:54.355,000 --> 0:36:57,000
NPG: The studio asked us to release the film a year earlier

784
0:36:58.079,000 --> 0:37:,000
than what we had originally planned.

785
0:37:00.284,000 --> 0:37:01,000
A year is a lot.

786
0:37:01.744,000 --> 0:37:04,000
We tried to reestablish that underdog theme.

787
0:37:05.25,000 --> 0:37:08,000
And taking a year off the schedule sure helped.

788
0:37:08.979,000 --> 0:37:11,000
AG: That's one way to turn superstars into underdogs again.

789
0:37:12.646,000 --> 0:37:16,000
But to make it work, the new challenge has to be meaningful or exciting,

790
0:37:16.702,000 --> 0:37:18,000
not just an arbitrary burden.

791
0:37:19.448,000 --> 0:37:21,000
BB: You know, there's an attitude out there,

792
0:37:21.551,000 --> 0:37:23,000
a bunch of people with their arms folded, like,

793
0:37:24.075,000 --> 0:37:25,000
"This better be good."

794
0:37:25.958,000 --> 0:37:26,000
You know?

795
0:37:27.133,000 --> 0:37:3,000
Which doesn't help inspire you to do anything good.

796
0:37:30.995,000 --> 0:37:31,000
You know?

797
0:37:32.182,000 --> 0:37:36,000
But what is challenging is, can you take a year off the schedule

798
0:37:36.55,000 --> 0:37:39,000
and still come out with a great movie

799
0:37:39.685,000 --> 0:37:45,000
and come in on or under budget and, you know, drop the mic?

800
0:37:46.26,000 --> 0:37:47,000
AG: The team had the fuel they needed.

801
0:37:48.236,000 --> 0:37:5,000
It became a just-manageable difficulty.

802
0:37:51.228,000 --> 0:37:53,000
"Incredibles 2" grossed over a billion dollars

803
0:37:53.601,000 --> 0:37:54,000
in its first two months alone,

804
0:37:55.379,000 --> 0:37:58,000
eclipsing the original film's total theatrical revenues.

805
0:37:59.276,000 --> 0:38:,000
It was nominated for an Oscar

806
0:38:01.035,000 --> 0:38:04,000
and won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Family Movie.

807
0:38:04.149,000 --> 0:38:07,000
BB: Yes, it's cool for adults and kids.

808
0:38:07.744,000 --> 0:38:09,000
AG: That's what a bunch of black sheep can do.

809
0:38:10.038,000 --> 0:38:12,000
(Theme music)

810
0:38:17.044,000 --> 0:38:18,000
And, oh yeah --

811
0:38:18.511,000 --> 0:38:21,000
it's now the highest grossing animated film in American history.

812
0:38:22.631,000 --> 0:38:25,000
Most importantly, it got six thumbs up from my favorite experts.

813
0:38:26.606,000 --> 0:38:28,000
(Clip with kids) What was the first thing you said

814
0:38:28.98,000 --> 0:38:29,000
when we came out of the theater?

815
0:38:30.531,000 --> 0:38:31,000
Kid 2: I want to see it again and again.

816
0:38:32.489,000 --> 0:38:33,000
AG: How many times have you seen it?

817
0:38:34.26,000 --> 0:38:35,000
Kid 1: Uh ... four?

818
0:38:35.436,000 --> 0:38:37,000
AG: You've seen it four times? Why?

819
0:38:38.45,000 --> 0:38:39,000
Kid 1: Because I like it.

820
0:38:39.728,000 --> 0:38:41,000
Kid 2: I think it was twice in the same week.

821
0:38:43.53,000 --> 0:38:45,000
AG: WorkLife is hosted by me, Adam Grant.

841
0:39:45.565,000 --> 0:39:48,000
(Clip) Amy Cragg: We finished, and I hear Shalane go,

842
0:39:48.653,000 --> 0:39:5,000
"That was hard. I taste blood."

843
0:39:50.8,000 --> 0:39:52,000
And then she goes, "That's so awesome."

844
0:39:53.204,000 --> 0:39:54,000
I was like, "You know what?

845
0:39:54.53,000 --> 0:39:56,000
I'm going to find out exactly what I'm made of here."

846
0:39:57.059,000 --> 0:39:59,000
AG: Olympic rivals and pretty good friends, too.

847
0:40:00.014,000 --> 0:40:02,000
We'll explore how to get the best of both worlds.

848
0:40:05.998,000 --> 0:40:08,000
Kid 1: Beep, boop, beep! Daddy, I'm in your studio!

849
0:40:09.078,000 --> 0:40:1,000
Kid 3: Let's push buttons!

850
0:40:10.657,000 --> 0:40:12,000
Kid 1: Is that a microphone?

851
0:40:12.786,000 --> 0:40:16,000
Kid 3: I'm Adam Grant and I have no hair and my podcast is great!

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So, I am indeed going to talk about

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
the spaces men create for themselves,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
but first I want to tell you why I'm here.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I'm here for two reasons. These two guys

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
are my two sons Ford and Wren.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
When Ford was about three years old,

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
we shared a very small room together,

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
in a very small space.

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
My office was on one half of the bedroom,

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and his bedroom was on the other half.

11
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And you can imagine, if you're a writer,

12
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that things would get really crowded around deadlines.

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So when Wren was on the way,

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I realized I needed to find a space of my own.

15
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
There was no more space in the house. So I went out to the backyard,

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and without any previous building experience,

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and about 3,000 dollars and some

18
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
recycled materials, I built this space.

19
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It had everything I needed. It was quiet.

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
There was enough space. And I had control, which was very important.

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
As I was building this space, I thought

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
to myself, "Surely I'm not the only guy

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
to have to have carved out a space for his own."

24
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So I did some research.

25
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And I found that there was an historic precedence.

26
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Hemingway had his writing space.

27
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Elvis had two or three manspaces,

28
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
which is pretty unique because he lived with both his wife and his mother in Graceland.

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
In the popular culture, Superman had the Fortress of Solitude,

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and there was, of course, the Batcave.

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So I realized then that I wanted to go out on a journey

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and see what guys were creating for themselves now.

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Here is one of the first spaces I found. It is in Austin, Texas,

34
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
which is where I'm from.

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
On the outside it looks like a very typical garage, a nice garage.

36
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
But on the inside, it's anything but.

37
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And this, to me, is a pretty classic manspace.

38
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
It has neon concert posters, a bar

39
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and, of course, the leg lamp,

40
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
which is very important.

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I soon realized that manspaces didn't have to be only inside.

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
This guy built a bowling alley in his backyard,

43
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
out of landscaping timbers, astroturf.

44
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And he found the scoreboard in the trash.

45
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Here's another outdoor space, a little bit more sophisticated.

46
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
This a 1923 wooden tugboat,

47
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
made completely out of Douglas fir.

48
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
The guy did it all himself.

49
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And there is about 1,000 square feet of hanging-out space inside.

50
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So, pretty early on in my investigations

51
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I realized what I was finding was not what I expected to find,

52
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
which was, quite frankly, a lot of beer can pyramids

53
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and overstuffed couches and flat-screen TVs.

54
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
There were definitely hang-out spots.

55
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
But some were for working, some were for playing,

56
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
some were for guys to collect their things.

57
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Most of all, I was just surprised with what I was finding.

58
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Take this place for example.

59
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
On the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage.

60
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
This is in Long Island, New York.

61
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
The only thing that might tip you off is the round window.

62
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
On the inside it's a recreation of a

63
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
16th century Japanese tea house.

64
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
The man imported all the materials from Japan,

65
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and he hired a Japanese carpenter

66
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
to build it in the traditional style.

67
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
It has no nails or screws.

68
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
All the joints are hand-carved and hand-scribed.

69
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Here is another pretty typical scene. This is a suburban Las Vegas neighborhood.

70
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
But you open one of the garage doors

71
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and there is a professional-size boxing ring inside.

72
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
(Laughter)

73
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And so there is a good reason for this.

74
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
It was built by this man who is Wayne McCullough.

75
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
He won the silver medal for Ireland

76
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
in the 1992 Olympics,

77
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and he trains in this space. He trains other people.

78
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And right off the garage he has his own trophy room

79
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
where he can sort of bask in his accomplishments,

80
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
which is another sort of important part about a manspace.

81
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So, while this space represents someone's profession,

82
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
this one certainly represents a passion.

83
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
It's made to look like the inside of an English sailing ship.

84
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
It's a collection of nautical antiques from the 1700s and 1800s.

85
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Museum quality.

86
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So, as I came to the end of my journey,

87
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I found over 50 spaces.

88
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And they were unexpected and they were surprising.

89
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
But they were also --

90
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I was really impressed by how personalized they were,

91
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and how much work went into them.

92
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And I realized that's because the guys that I met

93
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
were all very passionate about what they did.

94
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And they really loved their professions.

95
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And they were very passionate about their collections and their hobbies.

96
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And so they created these spaces

97
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
to reflect what they love to do,

98
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and who they were.

99
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So if you don't have a space of your own,

100
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I highly recommend finding one, and getting into it.

101
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Thank you very much.

102
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
(Applause)

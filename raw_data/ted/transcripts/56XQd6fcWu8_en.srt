1
0:00:15.65,000 --> 0:00:16,000
(Music)

2
0:00:35.298,000 --> 0:00:39,000
(Singing) Ooh ooh

3
0:00:44.091,000 --> 0:00:45,000
She wants to be rich

4
0:00:46.552,000 --> 0:00:48,000
She wants to be famous

5
0:00:49.147,000 --> 0:00:51,000
She wants to have lots and lots of money

6
0:00:52.496,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Soar above the clouds

7
0:00:54.292,000 --> 0:00:55,000
She wanna be free

8
0:00:56.688,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Like Nelson Mandela

9
0:00:59.942,000 --> 0:01:,000
Stand tall like a pyramid

10
0:01:01.871,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So, so courageous

11
0:01:04.911,000 --> 0:01:06,000
No place she'd rather be

12
0:01:07.49,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Oh na na na, oh na na na

13
0:01:09.728,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And there's no place she'd rather be

14
0:01:12.465,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Oh na na na, oh na na na

15
0:01:13.759,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Live and die in Afrika

16
0:01:17.997,000 --> 0:01:2,000
She wanna live and die in Afrika

17
0:01:21.878,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Oh lo lo lo lo

18
0:01:23.436,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Live and die in Afrika

19
0:01:28.546,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Live and die in Afrika

20
0:01:34.621,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I wanna feel love

21
0:01:37.129,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I wanna be remembered

22
0:01:39.701,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I wanna go down in history

23
0:01:42.985,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And make my mama proud

24
0:01:44.736,000 --> 0:01:45,000
The darker the berry

25
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
The sweeter the juice

26
0:01:50.432,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Na sitoki nyumbani wacha mila ni mtumwa

27
0:01:55.458,000 --> 0:01:57,000
No place I'd rather go

28
0:01:58.155,000 --> 0:02:,000
Oh na na na, oh na na na

29
0:02:00.538,000 --> 0:02:03,000
No place I'd rather go yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

30
0:02:03.934,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Live and die in Afrika

31
0:02:07.339,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Oh lo lo lo lo lo lo

32
0:02:09.027,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Live and die in Afrika

33
0:02:12.9,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Oh yeah yeah

34
0:02:14.075,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Live and die in Afrika

35
0:02:18.976,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Live and die in Afrika

36
0:02:24.215,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Live and die in Afrika

37
0:02:28.725,000 --> 0:02:31,000
(Applause)

38
0:02:32.657,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Bien-Aimé Baraza: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

39
0:02:35.3,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It's a pleasure and honor to be here today.

40
0:02:37.339,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Onstage is the group called Sauti Sol.

41
0:02:39.3,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Cheering)

42
0:02:41.117,000 --> 0:02:44,000
We have a couple of people paid in the audience to make some noise for us.

43
0:02:44.625,000 --> 0:02:45,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:45.807,000 --> 0:02:48,000
The four of us met in high school, 15 years ago,

45
0:02:49.593,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and at the time, we were famous for singing Boyz II Men covers,

46
0:02:52.57,000 --> 0:02:54,000
because they were our biggest inspiration.

47
0:02:55.339,000 --> 0:02:55,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:56.362,000 --> 0:03:,000
And I remember, in a very pervy way, in my room, I had a Mariah Carey poster

49
0:03:00.403,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and a Britney Spears poster, too.

50
0:03:02.628,000 --> 0:03:03,000
(Laughter)

51
0:03:03.724,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And I can't help but feel that times have changed.

52
0:03:07.696,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Because what used to be Mariah Carey in my room now,

53
0:03:11.307,000 --> 0:03:14,000
in a 15-year-old boy's room, is Tiwa Savage.

54
0:03:15.005,000 --> 0:03:2,000
What used to be 50 Cent in my room then,

55
0:03:20.101,000 --> 0:03:22,000
to a 15-year-old boy's room now

56
0:03:22.665,000 --> 0:03:23,000
is Sauti Sol.

57
0:03:23.839,000 --> 0:03:25,000
(Cheering) (Applause)

58
0:03:26.847,000 --> 0:03:3,000
The role of Afrobeats in emancipating

59
0:03:30.919,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and getting over the colonial mindset of the youth

60
0:03:37.022,000 --> 0:03:38,000
cannot be ignored.

61
0:03:38.633,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Afrobeats has played the strongest role so far, if you ask me,

62
0:03:43.165,000 --> 0:03:46,000
as far as emancipating the youth is concerned.

63
0:03:47.046,000 --> 0:03:52,000
We are now the superstars of our generation, for our people.

64
0:03:52.87,000 --> 0:03:54,000
We are the solution to their musical problems.

65
0:03:55.846,000 --> 0:03:56,000
(Applause)

66
0:03:57.029,000 --> 0:04:,000
And people our age are no longer looking for entertainment

67
0:04:00.95,000 --> 0:04:02,000
from America, from the West.

68
0:04:03.895,000 --> 0:04:04,000
We are the entertainment,

69
0:04:05.204,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and they're priming us above any other form of art.

70
0:04:10.609,000 --> 0:04:13,000
In 2015, President Obama came to Kenya,

71
0:04:14.125,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and we had the pleasure of being the entertainment

72
0:04:17.113,000 --> 0:04:19,000
for the state dinner that happened at state house, Nairobi.

73
0:04:20.244,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And as we were performing,

74
0:04:22.236,000 --> 0:04:26,000
he jumped onstage with us, and together, we did a cultural dance

75
0:04:27.061,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to a song that I want to share with you guys right now.

76
0:04:31.427,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And wherever you are, if you feel the music, dance.

77
0:04:35.117,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Ladies and gentleman, "Sura Yako."

78
0:04:37.284,000 --> 0:04:38,000
(Cheering)

79
0:04:38.466,000 --> 0:04:39,000
(Music)

80
0:04:40.442,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Nimekuchagua wewe, nikupende

81
0:04:45.408,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Mama, sitaki mwingine

82
0:04:48.349,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Aushi usiniache, usinitende

83
0:04:53.423,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Mama, usipende mwingine

84
0:04:57.812,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Moyo wangu ni mwepesi

85
0:04:59.693,000 --> 0:05:,000
Umenikalia chapati

86
0:05:01.608,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Nafanya vituko kama chizi

87
0:05:03.677,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Kukupenda sitasizi

88
0:05:05.585,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Moyo wangu ni mwepesi

89
0:05:07.696,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Umenikalia chapati

90
0:05:09.427,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Nafanya vituko kama chizi

91
0:05:11.809,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Kukupenda sitasizi

92
0:05:13.522,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Sura yako mzuri mama

0:06:58.18,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Mzuri mama

138
0:07:00.196,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Mzuri mama

139
0:07:05.627,000 --> 0:07:07,000
(Applause)

140
0:07:08.14,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Savara Mudigi: Wow.

141
0:07:09.624,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Thank you, thank you so much.

142
0:07:11.582,000 --> 0:07:12,000
(Applause)

143
0:07:13.084,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So, afrobeats, afrobeats.

144
0:07:16.933,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Afrobeat is a force, it's a force in the world right now.

145
0:07:21.013,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Just last year, in the last year alone,

146
0:07:23.601,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Africa had songs in the Billboard charts.

147
0:07:27.038,000 --> 0:07:31,000
"One Dance," written by Wizkid, performed by Wizkid and Drake.

148
0:07:32.093,000 --> 0:07:34,000
"Unforgettable" by French Montana.

149
0:07:34.577,000 --> 0:07:37,000
For those who know or don't know, French Montana is Moroccan.

150
0:07:38.561,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Artists who the world has normally considered as mainstream

151
0:07:42.799,000 --> 0:07:44,000
are now realizing they're late to the party.

152
0:07:45.474,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And they are knocking on the door,

153
0:07:47.427,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and because we are good people, we are going to let them in.

154
0:07:50.3,000 --> 0:07:51,000
(Laughter)

155
0:07:51.783,000 --> 0:07:53,000
(Applause)

156
0:07:53.903,000 --> 0:07:56,000
When we look at an artist, Queen B herself -- in brackets, Beyoncé --

157
0:07:57.585,000 --> 0:07:58,000
(Laughter)

158
0:07:58.768,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Beyoncé has African influence in her music.

159
0:08:02.688,000 --> 0:08:04,000
A couple of years ago, in 2011,

160
0:08:04.879,000 --> 0:08:07,000
through YouTube, she saw these dancers called Tofo Tofo dancers,

161
0:08:08.49,000 --> 0:08:09,000
from Mozambique,

162
0:08:09.776,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and she flew them all the way from Mozambique to Los Angeles

163
0:08:14.49,000 --> 0:08:16,000
to teach her and her dancers

164
0:08:16.68,000 --> 0:08:18,000
the now signature dance moves that you see in her song,

165
0:08:19.304,000 --> 0:08:2,000
"Run the World (Girls)."

166
0:08:21.069,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Yeah. (Laughs)

167
0:08:23.846,000 --> 0:08:28,000
So, with social media and a vibrant, vibrant African diaspora,

168
0:08:28.926,000 --> 0:08:32,000
more and more the world is dancing to our rhythm

169
0:08:33.029,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and talking our pidgin.

170
0:08:35.22,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Yeah? (Laughs)

171
0:08:36.664,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Thanks, Nigeria, we'll use that for across the board.

172
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
(Laughter)

173
0:08:41.204,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Our next song, "Kuliko Jana," had a viral video

174
0:08:43.783,000 --> 0:08:48,000
that was posted by Snoop Dogg, Ne-Yo, Talib Kweli.

175
0:08:49.568,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And the general feedback of this song,

176
0:08:52.14,000 --> 0:08:55,000
especially in the black community in the United States,

177
0:08:55.855,000 --> 0:08:58,000
was that this song gave them a feeling or a sense

178
0:08:59.633,000 --> 0:09:,000
of spiritual repatriation.

179
0:09:01.696,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So, ladies and gentlemen, "Kuliko Jana."

180
0:09:04.006,000 --> 0:09:05,000
(Cheering)

181
0:09:05.679,000 --> 0:09:06,000
(Vocalizing)

182
0:09:26.172,000 --> 0:09:27,000
(Vocalizing ends)

183
0:09:27.347,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Bwana ni mwokozi wangu

184

Tena ni kiongozi wangu

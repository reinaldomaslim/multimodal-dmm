1
0:00:12.97,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So, I love making tools and sharing them with people.

2
0:00:16.938,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I remember as a child,

3
0:00:18.352,000 --> 0:00:21,000
my first tool I built was actually a microscope

4
0:00:21.669,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that I built by stealing lenses from my brother's eyeglasses.

5
0:00:26.109,000 --> 0:00:27,000
He wasn't that thrilled.

6
0:00:27.92,000 --> 0:00:29,000
But, you know, maybe because of that moment,

7
0:00:30.114,000 --> 0:00:31,000
30 years later,

8
0:00:31.291,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I'm still making microscopes.

9
0:00:34.179,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And the reason I built these tools is for moments like this.

10
0:00:39.379,000 --> 0:00:41,000
(Video) Girl: I have black things in my hair --

11
0:00:41.823,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Manu Prakash: This is a school in the Bay Area.

12
0:00:44.66,000 --> 0:00:48,000
(Video) MP: The living world far supersedes our imagination

13
0:00:49.148,000 --> 0:00:5,000
of how things actually work.

14
0:00:51.139,000 --> 0:00:53,000
(Video) Boy: Oh my God!

15
0:00:55.593,000 --> 0:00:57,000
MP: Right -- oh my God!

16
0:00:58.441,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I hadn't realized this would be such a universal phrase.

17
0:01:02.943,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Over the last two years,

18
0:01:04.767,000 --> 0:01:05,000
in my lab,

19
0:01:05.958,000 --> 0:01:07,000
we built 50,000 Foldscopes

20
0:01:08.057,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and shipped them to 130 countries in the world,

21
0:01:10.991,000 --> 0:01:12,000
at no cost to the kids we sent them to.

22
0:01:14.058,000 --> 0:01:15,000
This year alone,

23
0:01:15.325,000 --> 0:01:17,000
with the support of our community,

24
0:01:17.481,000 --> 0:01:19,000
we are planning to ship a million microscopes

25
0:01:19.985,000 --> 0:01:2,000
to kids around the world.

26
0:01:21.854,000 --> 0:01:22,000
What does that do?

27
0:01:23.448,000 --> 0:01:26,000
It creates an inspiring community of people around the world,

28
0:01:27.228,000 --> 0:01:28,000
learning and teaching each other,

29
0:01:28.924,000 --> 0:01:32,000
from Kenya to Kampala to Kathmandu to Kansas.

30
0:01:33.038,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And one of the phenomenal things that I love about this

31
0:01:35.707,000 --> 0:01:36,000
is the sense of community.

32
0:01:37.691,000 --> 0:01:38,000
There's a kid in Nicaragua

33
0:01:39.107,000 --> 0:01:43,000
teaching others how to identify mosquito species that carry dengue

34
0:01:43.325,000 --> 0:01:45,000
by looking at the larva under a microscope.

35
0:01:45.767,000 --> 0:01:47,000
There's a pharmacologist who came up with a new way

36
0:01:48.339,000 --> 0:01:5,000
to detect fake drugs anywhere.

37
0:01:51.222,000 --> 0:01:53,000
There is a girl who wondered:

38
0:01:53.305,000 --> 0:01:54,000
"How does glitter actually work?"

39
0:01:55.027,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and discovered the physics of crystalline formation in glitter.

40
0:01:59.533,000 --> 0:02:,000
There is an Argentinian doctor

41
0:02:01.162,000 --> 0:02:05,000
who's trying to do field cervical cancer screening with this tool.

42
0:02:05.448,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And yours very truly found a species of flea

43
0:02:09.21,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that was dug inside my heel in my foot one centimeter deep.

44
0:02:15.141,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Now, you might think of these as anomalies.

45
0:02:19.795,000 --> 0:02:21,000
But there is a method to this madness.

46
0:02:22.437,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I call this "frugal science" --

47
0:02:24.691,000 --> 0:02:27,000
the idea of sharing the experience of science,

48
0:02:28.567,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and not just the information.

49
0:02:30.831,000 --> 0:02:31,000
To remind you:

50
0:02:32.07,000 --> 0:02:34,000
there are a billion people on this planet

51
0:02:34.178,000 --> 0:02:36,000
who live with absolutely no infrastructure:

52
0:02:36.717,000 --> 0:02:37,000
no roads,

53
0:02:38.355,000 --> 0:02:39,000
no electricity

54
0:02:39.761,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and thus, no health care.

55
0:02:42.787,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Also, there a billion kids on this planet that live in poverty.

56
0:02:47.52,000 --> 0:02:48,000
How are we supposed to inspire them

57
0:02:49.212,000 --> 0:02:51,000
for the next generation of solution makers?

58
0:02:52.084,000 --> 0:02:54,000
There are health care workers that we put on the line

59
0:02:54.856,000 --> 0:02:55,000
to fight infectious diseases,

60
0:02:56.798,000 --> 0:03:,000
to protect us with absolutely bare-minimum tools and resources.

61
0:03:02.404,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So as a lab at Stanford,

62
0:03:04.022,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I think of this from a context of frugal science

63
0:03:07.983,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and building solutions for these communities.

64
0:03:10.592,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Often we think about being able to do diagnosis under a tree, off-grid.

65
0:03:15.636,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I'll tell you two examples today of new tools.

66
0:03:18.389,000 --> 0:03:19,000
One of them starts in Uganda.

67
0:03:20.571,000 --> 0:03:21,000
In 2013,

68
0:03:22.124,000 --> 0:03:26,000
on a field trip to detect schistosomiasis with Foldscopes,

69
0:03:26.194,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I made a minor observation.

70
0:03:28.776,000 --> 0:03:29,000
In a clinic,

71
0:03:30.377,000 --> 0:03:31,000
in a far, remote area,

72
0:03:31.74,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I saw a centrifuge being used as a doorstop.

73
0:03:36.012,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I mean -- quite literally, the doorstop.

74
0:03:38.427,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And I asked them and they said,

75
0:03:40.177,000 --> 0:03:42,000
"Oh, we don't actually have electricity,

76
0:03:42.228,000 --> 0:03:45,000
so this piece of junk is good as a doorstop."

77
0:03:46.444,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Centrifuges, for some of you who don't know,

78
0:03:49.17,000 --> 0:03:52,000
are the pinnacle tool to be able to do sample processing.

79
0:03:52.418,000 --> 0:03:54,000
You separate components of blood or body fluids

80
0:03:55.184,000 --> 0:03:57,000
to be able to detect and identify pathogens.

81
0:03:58.239,000 --> 0:04:,000
But centrifuges are bulky, expensive --

82
0:04:01.097,000 --> 0:04:03,000
cost around 1,000 dollars --

83
0:04:03.315,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and really hard to carry out in the field.

84
0:04:05.345,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And of course,

85
0:04:06.526,000 --> 0:04:07,000
they don't work without power.

86
0:04:07.984,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Sound familiar?

87
0:04:09.4,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So we started thinking about solving this problem,

88
0:04:11.972,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and I came back --

89
0:04:13.546,000 --> 0:04:14,000
kept thinking about toys.

90
0:04:15.638,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Now ...

91
0:04:17.85,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I have a few with me here.

92
0:04:19.632,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I first started with yo-yos ...

93
0:04:21.763,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and I'm a terrible yo-yo thrower.

94
0:04:24.743,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Because these objects spin,

95
0:04:26.448,000 --> 0:04:27,000
we wondered,

96
0:04:27.634,000 --> 0:04:29,000
could we actually use the physics of these objects

97
0:04:30.015,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to be able to build centrifuges?

98
0:04:33.077,000 --> 0:04:35,000
This was possibly the worst throw I could make.

99
0:04:36.256,000 --> 0:04:37,000
But you might start realizing,

100
0:04:37.773,000 --> 0:04:39,000
if you start exploring the space of toys --

101
0:04:40.636,000 --> 0:04:42,000
we tried these spinning tops,

102
0:04:43.265,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and then in the lab,

103
0:04:45.171,000 --> 0:04:47,000
we stumbled upon this wonder.

104
0:04:47.59,000 --> 0:04:5,000
It's the whirligig, or a buzzer, or a rundle.

105
0:04:51.1,000 --> 0:04:53,000
A couple of strings and a little disk,

106
0:04:53.541,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and if I push, it spins.

107
0:04:56.17,000 --> 0:04:58,000
How many of you have played with this as a kid?

108
0:04:58.538,000 --> 0:04:59,000
This is called a button-on-a-string.

109
0:05:00.41,000 --> 0:05:01,000
OK, maybe 50 percent of you.

110
0:05:02.07,000 --> 0:05:03,000
What you didn't realize --

111
0:05:03.652,000 --> 0:05:05,000
that this little object

112
0:05:05.989,000 --> 0:05:09,000
is the oldest toy in the history of mankind ...

113
0:05:10.827,000 --> 0:05:11,000
5,000 years ago.

114
0:05:12.496,000 --> 0:05:15,000
We have found relics of this object hidden around on our planet.

115
0:05:16.924,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Now the irony is,

116
0:05:18.889,000 --> 0:05:21,000
we actually don't understand how this little thing works.

117
0:05:22.648,000 --> 0:05:23,000
That's when I get excited.

118
0:05:24.617,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So we got back to work,

119
0:05:26.722,000 --> 0:05:27,000
wrote down a couple of equations.

120
0:05:28.876,000 --> 0:05:31,000
If you take the input torque that you put in,

121
0:05:32.213,000 --> 0:05:34,000
you take the drag on this disc,

122
0:05:34.341,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and the twist drag on these strings,

123
0:05:36.27,000 --> 0:05:38,000
you should be able to mathematically solve this.

124
0:05:38.783,000 --> 0:05:4,000
This is not the only equation in my talk.

125
0:05:41.615,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Ten pages of math later,

126
0:05:43.471,000 --> 0:05:45,000
we could actually write down the complete analytical solution

127
0:05:46.354,000 --> 0:05:47,000
for this dynamic system.

128
0:05:48.208,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And out comes what we call "Paperfuge."

129
0:05:51.843,000 --> 0:05:53,000
That's my postdoc Saad Bhamla,

130
0:05:54.411,000 --> 0:05:55,000
who's the co-inventor of Paperfuge.

131
0:05:56.102,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And to the left, you see all the centrifuges

132
0:05:58.371,000 --> 0:05:59,000
that we're trying to replace.

133
0:05:59.822,000 --> 0:06:02,000
This little object that you see right here

134
0:06:04.759,000 --> 0:06:07,000
is a disc, a couple of strings and a handle.

135
0:06:08.028,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And when I spin

136
0:06:09.76,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and I push,

137
0:06:10.937,000 --> 0:06:11,000
it starts to spin.

138
0:06:12.113,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Now, when you realize,

139
0:06:14.77,000 --> 0:06:15,000
when you do the math,

140
0:06:17.399,000 --> 0:06:19,000
when we calculate the rpm for this object,

141
0:06:19.913,000 --> 0:06:23,000
mathematically, we should be able to go all the way to a million rpm.

142
0:06:24.669,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Now, there is a little twist in human anatomy,

143
0:06:26.886,000 --> 0:06:29,000
because the resonant frequency of this object is about 10 hertz,

144
0:06:29.985,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and if you've ever played the piano,

145
0:06:31.813,000 --> 0:06:33,000
you can't go higher than two or three hertz.

146
0:06:33.931,000 --> 0:06:36,000
The maximum speed we've been able to achieve with this object

147
0:06:37.219,000 --> 0:06:38,000
is not 10,000 rpm,

148
0:06:39.172,000 --> 0:06:4,000
not 50,000 rpm --

149
0:06:40.8,000 --> 0:06:41,000
120,000 rpm.

150
0:06:42.749,000 --> 0:06:44,000
That's equal to 30,000 g-forces.

151
0:06:45.577,000 --> 0:06:48,000
If I was to stick you right here and have it spin,

152
0:06:48.808,000 --> 0:06:51,000
you would think about the types of forces you would experience.

153
0:06:52.261,000 --> 0:06:54,000
One of the factors of a tool like this

154
0:06:54.523,000 --> 0:06:56,000
is to be able to do diagnosis with this.

155
0:06:57.541,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So, I'm going to do a quick demo here, where --

156
0:07:02.262,000 --> 0:07:05,000
this is a moment where I'm going to make a little finger prick,

157
0:07:05.881,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and a tiny drop of blood is going to come out.

158
0:07:08.18,000 --> 0:07:1,000
If you don't like blood, you don't have to look at it.

159
0:07:10.825,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Here is a little lancet.

160
0:07:12.188,000 --> 0:07:13,000
These lancets are available everywhere,

161
0:07:14.082,000 --> 0:07:15,000
completely passive.

162
0:07:15.629,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And if I've had breakfast today ...

163
0:07:21.867,000 --> 0:07:22,000
That didn't hurt at all.

164
0:07:23.378,000 --> 0:07:26,000
OK, I take a little capillary with a drop of blood --

165
0:07:27.386,000 --> 0:07:29,000
now this drop of blood has answers,

166
0:07:29.669,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that's why I'm interested in it.

167
0:07:31.73,000 --> 0:07:34,000
It might actually tell me whether I have malaria right now or not.

168
0:07:35.221,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I take a little capillary,

169
0:07:37.077,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and you see it starts wicking in.

170
0:07:39.708,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I'm going to draw a little more blood.

171
0:07:44.602,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And that's good enough for right now.

172
0:07:47.339,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Now, I just seal this capillary by putting it in clay.

173
0:07:55.312,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And now that's sealed the sample.

174
0:07:57.616,000 --> 0:07:59,000
We're going to take the sample,

175
0:07:59.769,000 --> 0:08:,000
mount it on Paperfuge.

176
0:08:08.912,000 --> 0:08:11,000
A little piece of tape to make a sealed cavity.

177
0:08:12.795,000 --> 0:08:14,000
So now the sample is completely enclosed.

178
0:08:18.927,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And we are ready for a spin.

179
0:08:22.839,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I'm pushing and pulling with this object.

180
0:08:24.904,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I'm going to load this up ...

181
0:08:28.097,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And you see the object starts spinning.

182
0:08:30.404,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Unlike a regular centrifuge,

183
0:08:32.442,000 --> 0:08:35,000
this is a counter-rotating centrifuge.

184
0:08:36.245,000 --> 0:08:38,000
It goes back and forth, back and forth ...

185
0:08:39.041,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And now I'm charging it up,

186
0:08:41.193,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and you see it builds momentum.

187
0:08:44.005,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And now -- I don't know if you can hear this --

188
0:08:46.641,000 --> 0:08:47,000
30 seconds of this,

189
0:08:48.809,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and I should be able to separate all the blood cells with the plasma.

190
0:08:53.758,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And the ratio of those blood cells to plasma --

191
0:08:56.595,000 --> 0:08:58,000
(Applause)

192
0:09:00.259,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Already, if you see right here,

193
0:09:04.026,000 --> 0:09:05,000
if you focus on this,

194
0:09:05.674,000 --> 0:09:07,000
you should be able to see a separated volume

195
0:09:09.092,000 --> 0:09:1,000
of blood and plasma.

196
0:09:10.974,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And the ratio of that actually tells me whether I might be anemic.

197
0:09:14.921,000 --> 0:09:18,000
One of the aspects of this is, we build many types of Paperfuges.

198
0:09:18.982,000 --> 0:09:22,000
This one allows us to identify malaria parasites

199
0:09:23.472,000 --> 0:09:24,000
by running them for a little longer,

200
0:09:25.313,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and we can identify malaria parasites that are in the blood

201
0:09:28.903,000 --> 0:09:31,000
that we can separate out and detect with something like a centrifuge.

202
0:09:32.501,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Another version of this allows me to separate nucleic acids

203
0:09:37.005,000 --> 0:09:4,000
to be able to do nucleic acid tests out in the field itself.

204
0:09:41.393,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Here is another version that allows me to separate bulk samples,

205
0:09:45.761,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and then, finally,

206
0:09:47.355,000 --> 0:09:49,000
something new that we've been working on

207
0:09:49.379,000 --> 0:09:53,000
to be able to implement the entire multiplex test on an object like this.

208
0:09:54.198,000 --> 0:09:58,000
So where you do the sample preparation and the chemistry in the same object.

209
0:09:59.36,000 --> 0:10:,000
Now ...

210
0:10:00.67,000 --> 0:10:01,000
this is all good,

211
0:10:01.964,000 --> 0:10:02,000
but when you start thinking about this,

212
0:10:03.895,000 --> 0:10:05,000
you have to share these tools with people.

213
0:10:06.008,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And one of the things we did is -- we just got back from Madagascar;

214
0:10:09.414,000 --> 0:10:11,000
this is what clinical trials for malaria look like --

215
0:10:12.016,000 --> 0:10:13,000
(Laughter)

216
0:10:13.043,000 --> 0:10:15,000
You can do this while having coffee.

217
0:10:15.424,000 --> 0:10:16,000
But most importantly,

218
0:10:17.321,000 --> 0:10:21,000
this is a village six hours from any road.

219
0:10:21.856,000 --> 0:10:25,000
We are in a room with one of the senior members of the community

220
0:10:26.443,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and a health care worker.

221
0:10:27.98,000 --> 0:10:3,000
It really is this portion of the work that excites me the most --

222
0:10:31.501,000 --> 0:10:32,000
that smile,

223
0:10:32.683,000 --> 0:10:35,000
to be able to share simple but powerful tools with people around the world.

224
0:10:37.299,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Now, I forgot to tell you this,

225
0:10:39.625,000 --> 0:10:41,000
that all of that cost me 20 cents to make.

226
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
OK, in the negative time I have left,

227
0:10:46.236,000 --> 0:10:48,000
I'll tell you about the most recent --

228
0:10:48.326,000 --> 0:10:49,000
(Laughter)

229
0:10:49.47,000 --> 0:10:5,000
invention from our lab.

230
0:10:51.364,000 --> 0:10:52,000
It's called Abuzz --

231
0:10:53.438,000 --> 0:10:57,000
the idea that all of you could help us fight mosquitoes;

232
0:10:57.596,000 --> 0:10:59,000
you could all help us track our enemies.

233
0:10:59.887,000 --> 0:11:02,000
These are enemies because they cause malaria, Zika, chikungunya, dengue.

234
0:11:03.899,000 --> 0:11:07,000
But the challenge is that we actually don't know where our enemies are.

235
0:11:08.707,000 --> 0:11:1,000
The world map for where mosquitoes are is missing.

236
0:11:12.123,000 --> 0:11:13,000
So we started thinking about this.

237
0:11:13.89,000 --> 0:11:15,000
There are 3,500 species of mosquitoes,

238
0:11:15.949,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and they're all very similar.

239
0:11:17.376,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Some of them are so identical

240
0:11:18.839,000 --> 0:11:21,000
that even an entomologist cannot identify them under a microscope.

241
0:11:22.916,000 --> 0:11:23,000
But they have an Achilles' heel.

242
0:11:24.725,000 --> 0:11:27,000
This is what mosquitoes flirting with each other looks like.

243
0:11:27.949,000 --> 0:11:29,000
That's a male chasing a female.

244
0:11:30.202,000 --> 0:11:33,000
They're actually talking to each other with their wingbeat frequencies.

245
0:11:34.047,000 --> 0:11:35,000
(Buzzing sound)

246
0:11:35.111,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And thus, they have a signature.

247
0:11:38.472,000 --> 0:11:41,000
We realized that using a regular phone,

248
0:11:41.86,000 --> 0:11:43,000
a $5-10 flip phone --

249
0:11:44.425,000 --> 0:11:46,000
how many remember what this object is?

250
0:11:46.551,000 --> 0:11:47,000
(Laughter)

251
0:11:47.635,000 --> 0:11:51,000
We can record these acoustic signatures from mosquitoes.

252
0:11:51.82,000 --> 0:11:52,000
I'll tell you exactly how to do this.

253
0:11:53.78,000 --> 0:11:54,000
I caught some mosquitoes outside.

254
0:11:55.495,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Unlike Bill [Gates], I'm not going to release them.

255
0:11:57.907,000 --> 0:11:58,000
(Laughter)

256
0:11:58.971,000 --> 0:12:,000
But I will tell you how to record from this.

257
0:12:01.57,000 --> 0:12:03,000
All you do is tap them and they fly.

258
0:12:04.036,000 --> 0:12:05,000
You can first test --

259
0:12:05.401,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I can actually hear that.

260
0:12:07.177,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And you bring your phone, which has microphones --

261
0:12:09.655,000 --> 0:12:11,000
it turns out the mics are so damn good already,

262
0:12:12.045,000 --> 0:12:13,000
even on regular phones,

263
0:12:13.309,000 --> 0:12:15,000
that you can pick up this near-field signature.

264
0:12:15.766,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And since I'm out of time,

265
0:12:17.928,000 --> 0:12:2,000
let me just play the recording that I made a day ago.

266
0:12:21.644,000 --> 0:12:23,000
(Mosquitoes buzz)

267
0:12:24.208,000 --> 0:12:26,000
This is all the charming sound that you heard before

268
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
that you all love.

269
0:12:30.606,000 --> 0:12:31,000
One of the contexts of this

270
0:12:32.051,000 --> 0:12:35,000
is that being able to do this with a regular cell phone

271
0:12:35.289,000 --> 0:12:38,000
allows us to map mosquito species.

272
0:12:39.477,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Using a flip phone,

273
0:12:41.193,000 --> 0:12:43,000
we mapped one of the largest acoustic databases

274
0:12:44.195,000 --> 0:12:49,000
with 25 to 20 species of mosquitoes that carry human pathogens.

275
0:12:49.447,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And from this and machine learning,

276
0:12:51.15,000 --> 0:12:52,000
anybody who uploads this data,

277
0:12:52.958,000 --> 0:12:53,000
we can identify and tell the probability

278
0:12:54.97,000 --> 0:12:56,000
of what species of mosquitoes you're actually working with.

279
0:12:57.828,000 --> 0:12:59,000
We call this Abuzz, and if any of you want to sign up,

280
0:13:00.667,000 --> 0:13:01,000
just go to the website.

281
0:13:02.343,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Let me close with something

282
0:13:04.009,000 --> 0:13:06,000
that's very important and dear to my heart.

283
0:13:07.324,000 --> 0:13:1,000
One of the challenges of today is we have terrible problems.

284
0:13:11.295,000 --> 0:13:13,000
We have a billion people with absolutely no health care,

285
0:13:14.217,000 --> 0:13:16,000
climate change, biodiversity loss,

286
0:13:16.366,000 --> 0:13:17,000
on and on and on.

287
0:13:18.046,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And we hope that science is going to provide the answer.

288
0:13:21.41,000 --> 0:13:23,000
But before you leave this theatre today,

289
0:13:23.582,000 --> 0:13:24,000
I want you to promise one thing.

290
0:13:25.745,000 --> 0:13:27,000
We're going to make science accessible --

291
0:13:28.886,000 --> 0:13:3,000
not just to the people who can afford it,

292
0:13:31.049,000 --> 0:13:32,000
but a billion others who can't.

293
0:13:33.581,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Let's make science and scientific literacy a human right.

294
0:13:39.384,000 --> 0:13:43,000
The moment that you pass the tingling feeling of making a discovery

295
0:13:44.083,000 --> 0:13:45,000
to another child,

296
0:13:46.263,000 --> 0:13:49,000
you're enabling them to be the next group of people

297
0:13:50.079,000 --> 0:13:52,000
who will actually solve these problems.

298
0:13:52.211,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Thank you.

299
0:13:53.41,000 --> 0:13:56,000
(Applause)

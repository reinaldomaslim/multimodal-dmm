1
0:00:12.937,000 --> 0:00:16,000
How many people here would like to live to be at least 80 years old?

2
0:00:17.892,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Yeah.

3
0:00:19.391,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I think we all have this hopeful expectation

4
0:00:22.21,000 --> 0:00:23,000
of living into old age.

5
0:00:24.648,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Let's project out into the future,

6
0:00:26.758,000 --> 0:00:27,000
to your future "you's,"

7
0:00:28.342,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and let's imagine that we're all 85.

8
0:00:31.714,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Now, everyone look at two people.

9
0:00:34.971,000 --> 0:00:37,000
One of you probably has Alzheimer's disease.

10
0:00:39.185,000 --> 0:00:42,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:42.633,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Alright, alright.

12
0:00:44.774,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And maybe you're thinking, "Well, it won't be me."

13
0:00:49.17,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Then, OK. You are a caregiver.

14
0:00:53.208,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So --

15
0:00:54.396,000 --> 0:00:56,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:57.292,000 --> 0:00:58,000
so in some way,

17
0:00:58.673,000 --> 0:01:01,000
this terrifying disease is likely to affect us all.

18
0:01:02.753,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Part of the fear around Alzheimer's stems from the sense

19
0:01:05.791,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that there's nothing we can do about it.

20
0:01:08.229,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Despite decades of research, we still have no disease-modifying treatment

21
0:01:13.378,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and no cure.

22
0:01:15.141,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So if we're lucky enough to live long enough,

23
0:01:17.634,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Alzheimer's appears to be our brain's destiny.

24
0:01:21.189,000 --> 0:01:22,000
But maybe it doesn't have to be.

25
0:01:23.405,000 --> 0:01:26,000
What if I told you we could change these statistics,

26
0:01:26.794,000 --> 0:01:28,000
literally change our brain's destiny,

27
0:01:29.508,000 --> 0:01:32,000
without relying on a cure or advancements in medicine?

28
0:01:33.803,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Let's begin by looking at what we currently understand

29
0:01:36.352,000 --> 0:01:38,000
about the neuroscience of Alzheimer's.

30
0:01:39.55,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Here's a picture of two neurons connecting.

31
0:01:42.583,000 --> 0:01:45,000
The point of connection, this space circled in red,

32
0:01:45.964,000 --> 0:01:46,000
is called the synapse.

33
0:01:47.627,000 --> 0:01:5,000
The synapse is where neurotransmitters are released.

34
0:01:50.843,000 --> 0:01:54,000
This is where signals are transmitted, where communication happens.

35
0:01:55.135,000 --> 0:02:,000
This is where we think, feel, see, hear, desire ...

36
0:02:00.265,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and remember.

37
0:02:01.938,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And the synapse is where Alzheimer's happens.

38
0:02:04.86,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Let's zoom in on the synapse

39
0:02:06.846,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and look at a cartoon representation of what's going on.

40
0:02:10.619,000 --> 0:02:12,000
During the business of communicating information,

41
0:02:12.93,000 --> 0:02:15,000
in addition to releasing neurotransmitters like glutamate into the synapse,

42
0:02:16.952,000 --> 0:02:2,000
neurons also release a small peptide called amyloid beta.

43
0:02:22.437,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Normally, amyloid beta is cleared away metabolized by microglia,

44
0:02:27.445,000 --> 0:02:29,000
the janitor cells of our brains.

45
0:02:30.225,000 --> 0:02:33,000
While the molecular causes of Alzheimer's are still debated,

46
0:02:34.108,000 --> 0:02:37,000
most neuroscientists believe that the disease begins

47
0:02:37.386,000 --> 0:02:39,000
when amyloid beta begins to accumulate.

48
0:02:40.787,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Too much is released, or not enough is cleared away,

49
0:02:43.56,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and the synapse begins to pile up with amyloid beta.

50
0:02:46.918,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And when this happens, it binds to itself,

51
0:02:49.161,000 --> 0:02:52,000
forming sticky aggregates called amyloid plaques.

52
0:02:53.402,000 --> 0:02:55,000
How many people here are 40 years old or older?

53
0:02:57.004,000 --> 0:02:59,000
You're afraid to admit it now.

54
0:02:59.548,000 --> 0:03:01,000
This initial step into the disease,

55
0:03:01.798,000 --> 0:03:04,000
this presence of amyloid plaques accumulating,

56
0:03:04.906,000 --> 0:03:06,000
can already be found in your brains.

57
0:03:08.091,000 --> 0:03:11,000
The only way we could be sure of this would be through a PET scan,

58
0:03:11.585,000 --> 0:03:14,000
because at this point, you are blissfully unaware.

59
0:03:15.425,000 --> 0:03:19,000
You're not showing any impairments in memory, language, or cognition ...

60
0:03:19.738,000 --> 0:03:2,000
yet.

61
0:03:21.291,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We think it takes at least 15 to 20 years of amyloid plaque accumulation

62
0:03:25.852,000 --> 0:03:27,000
before it reaches a tipping point,

63
0:03:28.257,000 --> 0:03:3,000
then triggering a molecular cascade

64
0:03:30.516,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that causes the clinical symptoms of the disease.

65
0:03:33.63,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Prior to the tipping point,

66
0:03:35.615,000 --> 0:03:38,000
your lapses in memory might include things like,

67
0:03:39.223,000 --> 0:03:41,000
"Why did I come in this room?"

68
0:03:41.572,000 --> 0:03:43,000
or "Oh ... what's his name?"

69
0:03:44.299,000 --> 0:03:46,000
or "Where did I put my keys?"

70
0:03:47.373,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Now, before you all start freaking out again,

71
0:03:49.953,000 --> 0:03:54,000
because I know half of you did at least one of those in the last 24 hours --

72
0:03:55.375,000 --> 0:03:58,000
these are all normal kinds of forgetting.

73
0:03:58.636,000 --> 0:04:,000
In fact, I would argue that these examples

74
0:04:00.973,000 --> 0:04:01,000
might not even involve your memory,

75
0:04:02.974,000 --> 0:04:04,000
because you didn't pay attention to where you put your keys

76
0:04:05.89,000 --> 0:04:06,000
in the first place.

77
0:04:07.259,000 --> 0:04:08,000
After the tipping point,

78
0:04:08.961,000 --> 0:04:11,000
the glitches in memory, language and cognition are different.

79
0:04:12.508,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Instead of eventually finding your keys in your coat pocket

80
0:04:15.432,000 --> 0:04:17,000
or on the table by the door,

81
0:04:17.458,000 --> 0:04:19,000
you find them in the refrigerator,

82
0:04:20.196,000 --> 0:04:21,000
or you find them and you think,

83
0:04:22.186,000 --> 0:04:23,000
"What are these for?"

84
0:04:24.663,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So what happens when amyloid plaques accumulate to this tipping point?

85
0:04:29.895,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Our microglia janitor cells become hyper-activated,

86
0:04:33.238,000 --> 0:04:37,000
releasing chemicals that cause inflammation and cellular damage.

87
0:04:37.396,000 --> 0:04:39,000
We think they might actually start clearing away

88
0:04:40.015,000 --> 0:04:41,000
the synapses themselves.

89
0:04:42.218,000 --> 0:04:46,000
A crucial neural transport protein called "tau" becomes hyperphosphorylated

90
0:04:46.69,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and twists itself into something called "tangles,"

91
0:04:49.298,000 --> 0:04:52,000
which choke off the neurons from the inside.

92
0:04:52.357,000 --> 0:04:55,000
By mid-stage Alzheimer's, we have massive inflammation and tangles

93
0:04:56.215,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and all-out war at the synapse

94
0:04:58.186,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and cell death.

95
0:05:00.058,000 --> 0:05:03,000
So if you were a scientist trying to cure this disease,

96
0:05:03.17,000 --> 0:05:05,000
at what point would you ideally want to intervene?

97
0:05:06.954,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Many scientists are betting big on the simplest solution:

98
0:05:10.882,000 --> 0:05:13,000
keep amyloid plaques from reaching that tipping point,

99
0:05:14.74,000 --> 0:05:18,000
which means that drug discovery is largely focused on developing a compound

100
0:05:18.792,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that will prevent, eliminate, or reduce amyloid plaque accumulation.

101
0:05:24.679,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So the cure for Alzheimer's will likely be a preventative medicine.

102
0:05:29.892,000 --> 0:05:32,000
We're going to have to take this pill before we reach that tipping point,

103
0:05:33.345,000 --> 0:05:35,000
before the cascade is triggered,

104
0:05:35.621,000 --> 0:05:38,000
before we start leaving our keys in the refrigerator.

105
0:05:39.201,000 --> 0:05:42,000
We think this is why, to date, these kinds of drugs have failed

106
0:05:42.898,000 --> 0:05:43,000
in clinical trials --

107
0:05:44.159,000 --> 0:05:46,000
not because the science wasn't sound,

108
0:05:46.628,000 --> 0:05:5,000
but because the people in these trials were already symptomatic.

109
0:05:50.786,000 --> 0:05:51,000
It was too late.

110
0:05:52.542,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Think of amyloid plaques as a lit match.

111
0:05:55.818,000 --> 0:05:58,000
At the tipping point, the match sets fire to the forest.

112
0:05:59.704,000 --> 0:06:,000
Once the forest is ablaze,

113
0:06:01.678,000 --> 0:06:03,000
it doesn't do any good to blow out the match.

114
0:06:04.184,000 --> 0:06:07,000
You have to blow out the match before the forest catches fire.

115
0:06:08.151,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Even before scientists sort this out,

116
0:06:10.038,000 --> 0:06:12,000
this information is actually really good news for us,

117
0:06:12.93,000 --> 0:06:16,000
because it turns out that the way we live can influence the accumulation

118
0:06:16.998,000 --> 0:06:17,000
of amyloid plaques.

119
0:06:18.251,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And so there are things we can do

120
0:06:19.851,000 --> 0:06:21,000
to keep us from reaching that tipping point.

121
0:06:22.937,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Let's picture your risk of Alzheimer's as a see-saw scale.

122
0:06:26.849,000 --> 0:06:28,000
We're going to pile risk factors on one arm,

123
0:06:28.922,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and when that arm hits the floor, you are symptomatic

124
0:06:31.424,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

125
0:06:33.878,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Let's imagine you're 50 years old.

126
0:06:36.621,000 --> 0:06:37,000
You're not a spring chicken anymore,

127
0:06:38.38,000 --> 0:06:41,000
so you've accumulated some amyloid plaques with age.

128
0:06:41.476,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Your scale is tipped a little bit.

129
0:06:44.143,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Now let's look at your DNA.

130
0:06:46.356,000 --> 0:06:49,000
We've all inherited our genes from our moms and our dads.

131
0:06:49.932,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Some of these genes will increase our risk and some will decrease it.

132
0:06:54.034,000 --> 0:06:56,000
If you're like Alice in "Still Alice,"

133
0:06:56.247,000 --> 0:07:,000
you've inherited a rare genetic mutation that cranks out amyloid beta,

134
0:07:00.822,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and this alone will tip your scale arm to the ground.

135
0:07:04.399,000 --> 0:07:08,000
But for most of us, the genes we inherit will only tip the arm a bit.

136
0:07:08.589,000 --> 0:07:12,000
For example, APOE4 is a gene variant that increases amyloid,

137
0:07:13.428,000 --> 0:07:16,000
but you can inherit a copy of APOE4 from mom and dad

138
0:07:16.72,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and still never get Alzheimer's,

139
0:07:19.135,000 --> 0:07:21,000
which means that for most of us,

140
0:07:21.272,000 --> 0:07:24,000
our DNA alone does not determine whether we get Alzheimer's.

141
0:07:25.804,000 --> 0:07:26,000
So what does?

142
0:07:27.302,000 --> 0:07:3,000
We can't do anything about getting older or the genes we've inherited.

143
0:07:31.118,000 --> 0:07:33,000
So far, we haven't changed our brain's destiny.

144
0:07:34.964,000 --> 0:07:35,000
What about sleep?

145
0:07:37.098,000 --> 0:07:41,000
In slow-wave deep sleep, our glial cells rinse cerebral spinal fluid

146
0:07:41.204,000 --> 0:07:42,000
throughout our brains,

147
0:07:42.444,000 --> 0:07:45,000
clearing away metabolic waste that accumulated in our synapses

148
0:07:46.04,000 --> 0:07:47,000
while we were awake.

149
0:07:47.965,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Deep sleep is like a power cleanse for the brain.

150
0:07:51.466,000 --> 0:07:54,000
But what happens if you shortchange yourself on sleep?

151
0:07:55.241,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Many scientists believe

152
0:07:56.797,000 --> 0:08:,000
that poor sleep hygiene might actually be a predictor of Alzheimer's.

153
0:08:01.433,000 --> 0:08:05,000
A single night of sleep deprivation leads to an increase in amyloid beta.

154
0:08:07.23,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And amyloid accumulation has been shown to disrupt sleep,

155
0:08:10.68,000 --> 0:08:12,000
which in turn causes more amyloid to accumulate.

156
0:08:13.191,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And so now we have this positive feedback loop

157
0:08:15.691,000 --> 0:08:17,000
that's going to accelerate the tipping of that scale.

158
0:08:19.126,000 --> 0:08:2,000
What else?

159
0:08:20.573,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Cardiovascular health.

160
0:08:22.863,000 --> 0:08:25,000
High blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, smoking, high cholesterol,

161
0:08:26.632,000 --> 0:08:3,000
have all been shown to increase our risk of developing Alzheimer's.

162
0:08:30.792,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Some autopsy studies have shown

163
0:08:32.707,000 --> 0:08:34,000
that as many as 80 percent of people with Alzheimer's

164
0:08:35.403,000 --> 0:08:37,000
also had cardiovascular disease.

165
0:08:38.189,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Aerobic exercise has been shown in many studies to decrease amyloid beta

166
0:08:43.218,000 --> 0:08:44,000
in animal models of the disease.

167
0:08:45.439,000 --> 0:08:48,000
So a heart-healthy Mediterranean lifestyle and diet

168
0:08:49.043,000 --> 0:08:51,000
can help to counter the tipping of this scale.

169
0:08:52.517,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So there are many things we can do

170
0:08:54.89,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's.

171
0:08:57.286,000 --> 0:08:59,000
But let's say you haven't done any of them.

172
0:09:00.031,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Let's say you're 65;

173
0:09:02.509,000 --> 0:09:05,000
there's Alzheimer's in your family, so you've likely inherited a gene or two

174
0:09:06.199,000 --> 0:09:08,000
that tips your scale arm a bit;

175
0:09:08.247,000 --> 0:09:1,000
you've been burning the candle at both ends for years;

176
0:09:11.003,000 --> 0:09:12,000
you love bacon;

177
0:09:12.53,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and you don't run unless someone's chasing you.

178
0:09:14.777,000 --> 0:09:15,000
(Laughter)

179
0:09:16.102,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Let's imagine that your amyloid plaques have reached that tipping point.

180
0:09:19.738,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Your scale arm has crashed to the floor.

181
0:09:21.81,000 --> 0:09:22,000
You've tripped the cascade,

182
0:09:23.515,000 --> 0:09:24,000
setting fire to the forest,

183
0:09:25.105,000 --> 0:09:28,000
causing inflammation, tangles, and cell death.

184
0:09:28.957,000 --> 0:09:3,000
You should be symptomatic for Alzheimer's.

185
0:09:31.64,000 --> 0:09:34,000
You should be having trouble finding words and keys

186
0:09:34.98,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and remembering what I said at the beginning of this talk.

187
0:09:38.737,000 --> 0:09:39,000
But you might not be.

188
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:43,000
There's one more thing you can do to protect yourself

189
0:09:43.502,000 --> 0:09:45,000
from experiencing the symptoms of Alzheimer's,

190
0:09:46.112,000 --> 0:09:5,000
even if you have the full-blown disease pathology ablaze in your brain.

191
0:09:50.627,000 --> 0:09:53,000
It has to do with neural plasticity and cognitive reserve.

192
0:09:55.081,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Remember, the experience of having Alzheimer's

193
0:09:57.482,000 --> 0:10:,000
is ultimately a result of losing synapses.

194
0:10:01.159,000 --> 0:10:04,000
The average brain has over a hundred trillion synapses,

195
0:10:04.56,000 --> 0:10:06,000
which is fantastic; we've got a lot to work with.

196
0:10:07.297,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And this isn't a static number.

197
0:10:08.99,000 --> 0:10:1,000
We gain and lose synapses all the time,

198
0:10:11.412,000 --> 0:10:13,000
through a process called neural plasticity.

199
0:10:14.239,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Every time we learn something new,

200
0:10:16.335,000 --> 0:10:2,000
we are creating and strengthening new neural connections,

201
0:10:20.486,000 --> 0:10:21,000
new synapses.

202
0:10:22.808,000 --> 0:10:23,000
In the Nun Study,

203
0:10:24.407,000 --> 0:10:28,000
678 nuns, all over the age of 75 when the study began,

204
0:10:29.324,000 --> 0:10:31,000
were followed for more than two decades.

205
0:10:31.657,000 --> 0:10:34,000
They were regularly given physical checkups and cognitive tests,

206
0:10:35.141,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and when they died, their brains were all donated for autopsy.

207
0:10:39.213,000 --> 0:10:43,000
In some of these brains, scientists discovered something surprising.

208
0:10:43.612,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Despite the presence of plaques and tangles and brain shrinkage --

209
0:10:48.212,000 --> 0:10:5,000
what appeared to be unquestionable Alzheimer's --

210
0:10:51.105,000 --> 0:10:54,000
the nuns who had belonged to these brains showed no signs

211
0:10:54.808,000 --> 0:10:56,000
of having the disease while they were alive.

212
0:10:58.001,000 --> 0:10:59,000
How can this be?

213
0:10:59.829,000 --> 0:11:03,000
We think it's because these nuns had a high level of cognitive reserve,

214
0:11:03.98,000 --> 0:11:06,000
which is a way of saying that they had more functional synapses.

215
0:11:07.927,000 --> 0:11:09,000
People who have more years of formal education,

216
0:11:10.525,000 --> 0:11:12,000
who have a high degree of literacy,

217
0:11:12.784,000 --> 0:11:15,000
who engage regularly in mentally stimulating activities,

218
0:11:16.387,000 --> 0:11:18,000
all have more cognitive reserve.

219
0:11:18.892,000 --> 0:11:22,000
They have an abundance and a redundancy in neural connections.

220
0:11:23.043,000 --> 0:11:25,000
So even if they have a disease like Alzheimer's

221
0:11:25.747,000 --> 0:11:27,000
compromising some of their synapses,

222
0:11:27.825,000 --> 0:11:29,000
they've got many extra backup connections,

223
0:11:30.834,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and this buffers them from noticing that anything is amiss.

224
0:11:34.797,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Let's imagine a simplified example.

225
0:11:37.083,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Let's say you only know one thing about a subject.

226
0:11:39.833,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Let's say it's about me.

227
0:11:41.386,000 --> 0:11:43,000
You know that Lisa Genova wrote "Still Alice,"

228
0:11:43.716,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and that's the only thing you know about me.

229
0:11:46.176,000 --> 0:11:48,000
You have that single neural connection,

230
0:11:48.59,000 --> 0:11:49,000
that one synapse.

231
0:11:50.56,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Now imagine you have Alzheimer's.

232
0:11:52.745,000 --> 0:11:54,000
You have plaques and tangles and inflammation

233
0:11:55.102,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and microglia devouring that synapse.

234
0:11:58.423,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Now when someone asks you, "Hey, who wrote 'Still Alice?'"

235
0:12:02.677,000 --> 0:12:03,000
you can't remember,

236
0:12:03.946,000 --> 0:12:06,000
because that synapse is either failing or gone.

237
0:12:07.153,000 --> 0:12:08,000
You've forgotten me forever.

238
0:12:09.58,000 --> 0:12:11,000
But what if you had learned more about me?

239
0:12:12.23,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Let's say you learned four things about me.

240
0:12:14.343,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Now imagine you have Alzheimer's,

241
0:12:16.212,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and three of those synapses are damaged or destroyed.

242
0:12:19.897,000 --> 0:12:21,000
You still have a way to detour the wreckage.

243
0:12:22.382,000 --> 0:12:24,000
You can still remember my name.

244
0:12:25.103,000 --> 0:12:28,000
So we can be resilient to the presence of Alzheimer's pathology

245
0:12:29.053,000 --> 0:12:32,000
through the recruitment of yet-undamaged pathways.

246
0:12:32.18,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And we create these pathways, this cognitive reserve,

247
0:12:35.983,000 --> 0:12:36,000
by learning new things.

248
0:12:38.275,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Ideally, we want these new things to be as rich in meaning as possible,

249
0:12:42.82,000 --> 0:12:46,000
recruiting sight and sound and associations and emotion.

250
0:12:48.218,000 --> 0:12:51,000
So this really doesn't mean doing crossword puzzles.

251
0:12:51.377,000 --> 0:12:55,000
You don't want to simply retrieve information you've already learned,

252
0:12:55.498,000 --> 0:12:58,000
because this is like traveling down old, familiar streets,

253
0:12:58.865,000 --> 0:13:,000
cruising neighborhoods you already know.

254
0:13:01.933,000 --> 0:13:03,000
You want to pave new neural roads.

255
0:13:04.791,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Building an Alzheimer's-resistant brain

256
0:13:07.327,000 --> 0:13:09,000
means learning to speak Italian,

257
0:13:09.531,000 --> 0:13:1,000
meeting new friends,

258
0:13:11.065,000 --> 0:13:12,000
reading a book,

259
0:13:12.256,000 --> 0:13:14,000
or listening to a great TED Talk.

260
0:13:15.103,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And if, despite all of this, you are someday diagnosed with Alzheimer's,

261
0:13:20.44,000 --> 0:13:23,000
there are three lessons I've learned from my grandmother

262
0:13:23.617,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and the dozens of people I've come to know living with this disease.

263
0:13:27.935,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Diagnosis doesn't mean you're dying tomorrow.

264
0:13:31.143,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Keep living.

265
0:13:32.889,000 --> 0:13:34,000
You won't lose your emotional memory.

266
0:13:35.279,000 --> 0:13:38,000
You'll still be able to understand love and joy.

267
0:13:38.809,000 --> 0:13:41,000
You might not remember what I said five minutes ago,

268
0:13:41.836,000 --> 0:13:43,000
but you'll remember how I made you feel.

269
0:13:44.764,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And you are more than what you can remember.

270
0:13:48.064,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Thank you.

271
0:13:49.377,000 --> 0:13:54,000
(Applause)

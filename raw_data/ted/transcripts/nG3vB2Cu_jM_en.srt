1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Power.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
That is the word that comes to mind.

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
We're the new technologists.

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
We have a lot of data, so we have a lot of power.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
How much power do we have?

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Scene from a movie: "Apocalypse Now" -- great movie.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
We've got to get our hero, Captain Willard, to the mouth of the Nung River

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
so he can go pursue Colonel Kurtz.

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
The way we're going to do this is fly him in and drop him off.

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
So the scene:

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
the sky is filled with this fleet of helicopters carrying him in.

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And there's this loud, thrilling music in the background,

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
this wild music.

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000

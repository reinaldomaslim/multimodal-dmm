1
0:00:15.33,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I've spent the last decade

2
0:00:17.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
subjecting myself to pain and humiliation,

3
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
hopefully for a good cause,

4
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
which is self-improvement.

5
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And I've done this in three parts.

6
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
So first I started with the mind.

7
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And I decided to try to get smarter

8
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
by reading the entire Encyclopedia Britannica

9
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
from A to Z --

10
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
or, more precisely, from "a-ak" to "Zywiec."

11
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And here's a little image of that.

12
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And this was an amazing year.

13
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
It was really a fascinating journey.

14
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
It was painful at times,

15
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
especially for those around me.

16
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
My wife started to fine me one dollar

17
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
for every irrelevant fact I inserted into conversation.

18
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
So it had its downsides.

19
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
But after that,

20
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I decided to work on the spirit.

21
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
As I mentioned last year,

22
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I grew up with no religion at all.

23
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I'm Jewish,

24
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
but I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian.

25
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Not really.

27
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
But I decided to learn about the Bible and my heritage

28
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
by actually diving in

29
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and trying to live it and immerse myself in it.

30
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So I decided to follow all the rules of the Bible.

31
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And from the Ten Commandments

32
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
to growing my beard --

33
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
because Leviticus says you cannot shave.

34
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So this is what I looked like by the end.

35
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Thank you for that reaction.

36
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
(Laughter)

37
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I look a little like Moses, or Ted Kaczynski.

38
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I got both of them.

39
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So there was the topiary there.

40
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And there's the sheep.

41
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Now the final part of the trilogy

42
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
was I wanted to focus on the body

43
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and try to be the healthiest person I could be,

44
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
the healthiest person alive.

45
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So that's what I've been doing the last couple of years.

46
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And I just finished a couple of months ago.

47
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And I have to say, thank God.

48
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Because living so healthily was killing me.

49
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
It was so overwhelming,

51
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
because the amount of things you have to do,

52
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
it's just mind-boggling.

53
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I was listening to all the experts

54
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers.

55
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And they were telling me

56
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
all the things I had to do.

57
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I had to eat right,

58
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
exercise, meditate, pet dogs,

59
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
because that lowers the blood pressure.

60
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I wrote the book on a treadmill,

61
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and it took me about a thousand miles

62
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
to write the book.

63
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I had to put on sunscreen.

64
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
This was no small feat,

65
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
because if you listen to dermatologists,

66
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen.

67
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And you have to reapply it every two to four hours.

68
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So I think half of my book advance

69
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
went into sunscreen.

70
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
I was like a glazed doughnut

71
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
for most of the year.

72
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
There was the washing of hands.

73
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I had to do that properly.

74
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And my immunologist told me

75
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that I should also wipe down

76
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
all of the remote controls and iPhones in my house,

77
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
because those are just orgies of germs.

78
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So that took a lot of time.

79
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I also tried to be the safest person I could be,

80
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
because that's a part of health.

81
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I was inspired

82
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
by the Danish Safety Council.

83
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
They started a public campaign

84
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that says, "A walking helmet is a good helmet."

85
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So they believe you should not just wear helmets for biking,

86
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
but also for walking around.

87
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And you can see there

88
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
they're shopping with their helmets.

89
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
(Laughter)

90
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Well yeah, I tried that.

91
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Now it's a little extreme, I admit.

92
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
But if you think about this,

93
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
this is actually -- the "Freakonomics" authors wrote about this --

94
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
that more people die on a per mile basis

95
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
from drunk walking

96
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
than from drunk driving.

97
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So something to think about tonight

98
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
if you've had a couple.

99
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So I finished,

100
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and it was a success in a sense.

101
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
All of the markers went in the right direction.

102
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
My cholesterol went down, I lost weight,

103
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
my wife stopped telling me that I looked pregnant.

104
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So that was nice.

105
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And it was successful overall.

106
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
But I also learned that I was too healthy,

107
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and that was unhealthy.

108
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I was so focused on doing all these things

109
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that I was neglecting my friends and family.

110
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And as Dan Buettner can tell you,

111
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
having a strong social network

112
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
is so crucial to our health.

113
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So I finished.

114
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And I kind of went overboard

115
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
on the week after the project was over.

116
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I went to the dark side,

117
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and I just indulged myself.

118
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
It was like something out of Caligula.

119
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Laughter)

120
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Without the sex part.

121
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Because I have three young kids,

122
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
so that wasn't happening.

123
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
But the over-eating and over-drinking, definitely.

124
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And I finally have stabilized.

125
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So now I'm back

126
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
to adopting many -- not all; I don't wear a helmet anymore --

127
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
but dozens of healthy behaviors

128
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
that I adopted during my year.

129
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
It was really a life-changing project.

130
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And I, of course, don't have time to go into all of them.

131
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Let me just tell you two really quickly.

132
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
The first is -- and this was surprising to me;

133
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I didn't expect this to come out --

134
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
but I live a much quieter life now.

135
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Because we live in such a noisy world.

136
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
There's trains and planes and cars

137
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and Bill O'Reilly, he's very noisy.

138
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
(Laughter)

139
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And this is a real underestimated, under-appreciated health hazard --

140
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
not just because it harms our hearing, which it obviously does,

141
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
but it actually initiates

142
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
the fight-or-flight response.

143
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
A loud noise will get your fight-or-flight response going.

144
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And this, over the years,

145
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
can cause real damage, cardiovascular damage.

146
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
The World Health Organization just did a big study

147
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
that they published this year.

148
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And it was done in Europe.

149
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And they estimated

150
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that 1.6 million years of healthy living

151
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
are lost every year in Europe

152
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
because of noise pollution.

153
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So they think it's actually very deadly.

154
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And by the way,

155
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:46,000
it's also terrible for your brain.

156
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
It really impairs cognition.

157
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And our Founding Fathers knew about this.

158
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
When they wrote the Constitution,

159
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
they put dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall

160
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
so that they could concentrate.

161
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So without noise reduction technology,

162
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
our country would not exist.

163
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So as a patriot,

164
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I felt it was important to --

165
0:07:10.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I wear all the earplugs and the earphones,

166
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and it's really improved my life

167
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
in a surprising and unexpected way.

168
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And the second point I want to make, the final point,

169
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
is that -- and it's actually been a theme of TEDMED --

170
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that joy is so important to your health,

171
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
that very few of these behaviors

172
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
will stick with me

173
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
unless there's some sense of pleasure and joy in them.

174
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And just to give you one instance of this:

175
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
food.

176
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
The junk food industry

177
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
is really great

178
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
at pressing our pleasure buttons

179
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and figuring out what's the most pleasurable.

180
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
But I think we can use their techniques

181
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
and apply them to healthy food.

182
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
To give just one example,

183
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
we love crunchiness, mouthfeel.

184
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
So I basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness

185
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
into a lot of my recipes --

186
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
throw in some sunflower seeds.

187
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And you can almost trick yourself

188
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
into thinking you're eating Doritos.

189
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
(Laughter)

190
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And it has made me a healthier person.

191
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So that is it.

192
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
The book about it comes out in April.

193
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
It's called "Drop Dead Healthy."

194
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And I hope that I don't get sick during the book tour.

195
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
That's my greatest hope.

196
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
So thank you very much.

197
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
(Applause)

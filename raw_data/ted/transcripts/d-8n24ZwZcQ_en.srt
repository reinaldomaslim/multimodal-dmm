1
0:00:12.98,000 --> 0:00:14,000
It's easy to forget that last night,

2
0:00:16.203,000 --> 0:00:19,000
one billion people went to sleep without access to electricity.

3
0:00:20.094,000 --> 0:00:21,000
One billion people.

4
0:00:22.298,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Two and a half billion people did not have access to clean cooking fuels

5
0:00:27.553,000 --> 0:00:28,000
or clean heating fuels.

6
0:00:30.234,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Those are the problems in the developing world.

7
0:00:32.982,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And it's easy for us not to be empathetic

8
0:00:35.642,000 --> 0:00:37,000
with those people who seem so distanced from us.

9
0:00:38.331,000 --> 0:00:4,000
But even in our own world, the developed world,

10
0:00:41.725,000 --> 0:00:43,000
we see the tension of stagnant economies

11
0:00:45.234,000 --> 0:00:47,000
impacting the lives of people around us.

12
0:00:48.241,000 --> 0:00:51,000
We see it in whole pieces of the economy,

13
0:00:51.813,000 --> 0:00:54,000
where the people involved have lost hope about the future

14
0:00:55.22,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and despair about the present.

15
0:00:57.457,000 --> 0:00:58,000
We see that in the Brexit vote.

16
0:00:59.546,000 --> 0:01:02,000
We see that in the Sanders/Trump campaigns in my own country.

17
0:01:03.667,000 --> 0:01:07,000
But even in countries as recently turning the corner

18
0:01:08.619,000 --> 0:01:09,000
towards being in the developed world,

19
0:01:10.463,000 --> 0:01:11,000
in China,

20
0:01:11.727,000 --> 0:01:13,000
we see the difficulty that President Xi has

21
0:01:14.7,000 --> 0:01:18,000
as he begins to un-employ so many people in his coal and mining industries

22
0:01:20.214,000 --> 0:01:21,000
who see no future for themselves.

23
0:01:23.183,000 --> 0:01:26,000
As we as a society figure out how to manage

24
0:01:26.21,000 --> 0:01:27,000
the problems of the developed world

25
0:01:28.187,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and the problems of the developing world,

26
0:01:30.259,000 --> 0:01:32,000
we have to look at how we move forward

27
0:01:33.131,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and manage the environmental impact of those decisions.

28
0:01:37.868,000 --> 0:01:4,000
We've been working on this problem for 25 years, since Rio,

29
0:01:40.991,000 --> 0:01:41,000
the Kyoto Protocols.

30
0:01:43.223,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Our most recent move is the Paris treaty,

31
0:01:46.514,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and the resulting climate agreements

32
0:01:49.112,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that are being ratified by nations around the world.

33
0:01:52.045,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I think we can be very hopeful

34
0:01:54.256,000 --> 0:01:57,000
that those agreements, which are bottom-up agreements,

35
0:01:57.418,000 --> 0:01:59,000
where nations have said what they think they can do,

36
0:02:00.303,000 --> 0:02:04,000
are genuine and forthcoming for the vast majority of the parties.

37
0:02:04.977,000 --> 0:02:05,000
The unfortunate thing

38
0:02:07.205,000 --> 0:02:1,000
is that now, as we look at the independent analyses

39
0:02:10.756,000 --> 0:02:13,000
of what those climate treaties are liable to yield,

40
0:02:15.083,000 --> 0:02:17,000
the magnitude of the problem before us becomes clear.

41
0:02:18.965,000 --> 0:02:22,000
This is the United States Energy Information Agency's assessment

42
0:02:23.625,000 --> 0:02:27,000
of what will happen if the countries implement the climate commitments

43
0:02:28.337,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that they've made in Paris

44
0:02:30.397,000 --> 0:02:31,000
between now and 2040.

45
0:02:33.221,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It shows basically CO2 emissions around the world

46
0:02:37.465,000 --> 0:02:38,000
over the next 30 years.

47
0:02:40.236,000 --> 0:02:43,000
There are three things that you need to look at and appreciate.

48
0:02:44.177,000 --> 0:02:48,000
One, CO2 emissions are expected to continue to grow

49
0:02:48.372,000 --> 0:02:49,000
for the next 30 years.

50
0:02:51.265,000 --> 0:02:53,000
In order to control climate,

51
0:02:54.054,000 --> 0:02:56,000
CO2 emissions have to literally go to zero

52
0:02:57.564,000 --> 0:03:01,000
because it's the cumulative emissions that drive heating on the planet.

53
0:03:02.445,000 --> 0:03:06,000
This should tell you that we are losing the race to fossil fuels.

54
0:03:07.567,000 --> 0:03:08,000
The second thing you should notice

55
0:03:09.454,000 --> 0:03:13,000
is that the bulk of the growth comes from the developing countries,

56
0:03:13.771,000 --> 0:03:16,000
from China, from India, from the rest of the world,

57
0:03:16.86,000 --> 0:03:19,000
which includes South Africa and Indonesia and Brazil,

58
0:03:21.024,000 --> 0:03:23,000
as most of these countries move their people

59
0:03:24.353,000 --> 0:03:26,000
into the lower range of lifestyles

60
0:03:27.288,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that we literally take for granted in the developed world.

61
0:03:32.495,000 --> 0:03:34,000
The final thing that you should notice

62
0:03:34.902,000 --> 0:03:35,000
is that each year,

63
0:03:37.394,000 --> 0:03:43,000
about 10 gigatons of carbon are getting added to the planet's atmosphere,

64
0:03:44.994,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and then diffusing into the ocean and into the land.

65
0:03:48.011,000 --> 0:03:53,000
That's on top of the 550 gigatons that are in place today.

66
0:03:54.062,000 --> 0:03:55,000
At the end of 30 years,

67
0:03:55.92,000 --> 0:03:59,000
we will have put 850 gigatons of carbon into the air,

68
0:04:01.171,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and that probably goes a long way

69
0:04:03.446,000 --> 0:04:09,000
towards locking in a 2-4 degree C increase in global mean surface temperatures,

70
0:04:10.14,000 --> 0:04:12,000
locking in ocean acidification

71
0:04:13.227,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and locking in sea level rise.

72
0:04:16.379,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Now, this is a projection made by men

73
0:04:20.197,000 --> 0:04:21,000
by the actions of society,

74
0:04:22.863,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and it's ours to change, not to accept.

75
0:04:25.912,000 --> 0:04:28,000
But the magnitude of the problem is something we need to appreciate.

76
0:04:30.648,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Different nations make different energy choices.

77
0:04:33.115,000 --> 0:04:35,000
It's a function of their natural resources.

78
0:04:35.466,000 --> 0:04:37,000
It's a function of their climate.

79
0:04:37.499,000 --> 0:04:41,000
It's a function of the development path that they've followed as a society.

80
0:04:42.664,000 --> 0:04:45,000
It's a function of where on the surface of the planet they are.

81
0:04:46.191,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Are they where it's dark a lot of the time,

82
0:04:48.715,000 --> 0:04:49,000
or are they at the mid-latitudes?

83
0:04:50.989,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Many, many, many things go into the choices of countries,

84
0:04:55.185,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and they each make a different choice.

85
0:04:58.878,000 --> 0:05:01,000
The overwhelming thing that we need to appreciate

86
0:05:02.064,000 --> 0:05:03,000
is the choice that China has made.

87
0:05:04.695,000 --> 0:05:06,000
China has made the choice,

88
0:05:07.313,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and will make the choice, to run on coal.

89
0:05:10.358,000 --> 0:05:12,000
The United States has an alternative.

90
0:05:12.401,000 --> 0:05:13,000
It can run on natural gas

91
0:05:14.182,000 --> 0:05:17,000
as a result of the inventions of fracking and shale gas,

92
0:05:18.031,000 --> 0:05:19,000
which we have here.

93
0:05:19.526,000 --> 0:05:2,000
They provide an alternative.

94
0:05:22.662,000 --> 0:05:24,000
The OECD Europe has a choice.

95
0:05:25.881,000 --> 0:05:28,000
It has renewables that it can afford to deploy in Germany

96
0:05:28.974,000 --> 0:05:3,000
because it's rich enough to afford to do it.

97
0:05:31.615,000 --> 0:05:36,000
The French and the British show interest in nuclear power.

98
0:05:37.702,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Eastern Europe, still very heavily committed to natural gas and to coal,

99
0:05:42.331,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and with natural gas that comes from Russia,

100
0:05:45.083,000 --> 0:05:46,000
with all of its entanglements.

101
0:05:47.558,000 --> 0:05:49,000
China has many fewer choices

102
0:05:50.039,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and a much harder row to hoe.

103
0:05:53.557,000 --> 0:05:56,000
If you look at China, and you ask yourself

104
0:05:56.613,000 --> 0:05:58,000
why has coal been important to it,

105
0:05:58.841,000 --> 0:06:,000
you have to remember what China's done.

106
0:06:01.534,000 --> 0:06:04,000
China brought people to power, not power to people.

107
0:06:05.38,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It didn't do rural electrification.

108
0:06:08.427,000 --> 0:06:09,000
It urbanized.

109
0:06:09.954,000 --> 0:06:13,000
It urbanized by taking low-cost labor and low-cost energy,

110
0:06:14.182,000 --> 0:06:15,000
creating export industries

111
0:06:16.123,000 --> 0:06:18,000
that could fund a tremendous amount of growth.

112
0:06:19.535,000 --> 0:06:21,000
If we look at China's path,

113
0:06:21.763,000 --> 0:06:25,000
all of us know that prosperity in China has dramatically increased.

114
0:06:26.713,000 --> 0:06:3,000
In 1980, 80 percent of China's population

115
0:06:31.283,000 --> 0:06:33,000
lived below the extreme poverty level,

116
0:06:34.493,000 --> 0:06:37,000
below the level of having $1.90 per person per day.

117
0:06:38.658,000 --> 0:06:43,000
By the year 2000, only 20 percent of China's population

118
0:06:44.154,000 --> 0:06:46,000
lived below the extreme poverty level --

119
0:06:47.498,000 --> 0:06:48,000
a remarkable feat,

120
0:06:49.977,000 --> 0:06:51,000
admittedly, with some costs in civil liberties

121
0:06:52.368,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that would be tough to accept in the Western world.

122
0:06:56.548,000 --> 0:06:58,000
But the impact of all that wealth

123
0:06:59.479,000 --> 0:07:02,000
allowed people to get massively better nutrition.

124
0:07:03.484,000 --> 0:07:05,000
It allowed water pipes to be placed.

125
0:07:06.223,000 --> 0:07:08,000
It allowed sewage pipes to be placed,

126
0:07:08.706,000 --> 0:07:1,000
dramatic decrease in diarrheal diseases,

127
0:07:12.59,000 --> 0:07:14,000
at the cost of some outdoor air pollution.

128
0:07:16.07,000 --> 0:07:18,000
But in 1980, and even today,

129
0:07:18.374,000 --> 0:07:22,000
the number one killer in China is indoor air pollution,

130
0:07:22.833,000 --> 0:07:26,000
because people do not have access to clean cooking and heating fuels.

131
0:07:28.066,000 --> 0:07:3,000
In fact, in 2040,

132
0:07:31.794,000 --> 0:07:35,000
it's still estimated that 200 million people in China

133
0:07:36.593,000 --> 0:07:39,000
will not have access to clean cooking fuels.

134
0:07:41.133,000 --> 0:07:43,000
They have a remarkable path to follow.

135
0:07:44.854,000 --> 0:07:48,000
India also needs to meet the needs of its own people,

136
0:07:49.626,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and it's going to do that by burning coal.

137
0:07:52.475,000 --> 0:07:57,000
When we look at the EIA's projections of coal burning in India,

138
0:07:58.591,000 --> 0:08:02,000
India will supply nearly four times as much of its energy from coal

139
0:08:03.518,000 --> 0:08:05,000
as it will from renewables.

140
0:08:06.962,000 --> 0:08:08,000
It's not because they don't know the alternatives;

141
0:08:09.839,000 --> 0:08:12,000
it's because rich countries can do what they choose,

142
0:08:14.162,000 --> 0:08:16,000
poor countries do what they must.

143
0:08:18.198,000 --> 0:08:21,000
So what can we do to stop coal's emissions in time?

144
0:08:22.899,000 --> 0:08:26,000
What can we do that changes this forecast that's in front of us?

145
0:08:27.535,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Because it's a forecast that we can change if we have the will to do it.

146
0:08:33.094,000 --> 0:08:36,000
First of all, we have to think about the magnitude of the problem.

147
0:08:36.537,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Between now and 2040,

148
0:08:39.104,000 --> 0:08:44,000
800 to 1,600 new coal plants are going to be built around the world.

149
0:08:46.085,000 --> 0:08:5,000
This week, between one and three one-gigawatt coal plants

150
0:08:50.718,000 --> 0:08:52,000
are being turned on around the world.

151
0:08:53.817,000 --> 0:08:57,000
That's happening regardless of what we want,

152
0:08:57.891,000 --> 0:08:59,000
because the people that rule their countries,

153
0:09:00.423,000 --> 0:09:02,000
assessing the interests of their citizens,

154
0:09:02.817,000 --> 0:09:05,000
have decided it's in the interest of their citizens to do that.

155
0:09:07.335,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And that's going to happen unless they have a better alternative.

156
0:09:11.726,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And every 100 of those plants will use up

157
0:09:15.507,000 --> 0:09:18,000
between one percent and three percent

158
0:09:18.662,000 --> 0:09:19,000
of the Earth's climate budget.

159
0:09:21.264,000 --> 0:09:24,000
So every day that you go home thinking that you should do something

160
0:09:24.779,000 --> 0:09:25,000
about global warming,

161
0:09:26.594,000 --> 0:09:27,000
at the end of that week, remember:

162
0:09:28.55,000 --> 0:09:32,000
somebody fired up a coal plant that's going to run for 50 years

163
0:09:32.967,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and take away your ability to change it.

164
0:09:37.972,000 --> 0:09:4,000
What we've forgotten is something that Vinod Khosla used to talk about,

165
0:09:41.59,000 --> 0:09:44,000
a man of Indian ethnicity but an American venture capitalist.

166
0:09:45.339,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And he said, back in the early 2000s,

167
0:09:48.188,000 --> 0:09:52,000
that if you needed to get China and India off of fossil fuels,

168
0:09:52.219,000 --> 0:09:55,000
you had to create a technology that passed the "Chindia test,"

169
0:09:56.64,000 --> 0:09:58,000
"Chindia" being the appending of the two words.

170
0:09:59.9,000 --> 0:10:01,000
It had to be first of all viable,

171
0:10:02.283,000 --> 0:10:05,000
meaning that technically, they could implement it in their country,

172
0:10:05.901,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and that it would be accepted by the people in the country.

173
0:10:10.191,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Two, it had to be a technology that was scalable,

174
0:10:16.788,000 --> 0:10:19,000
that it could deliver the same benefits

175
0:10:19.83,000 --> 0:10:22,000
on the same timetable as fossil fuels,

176
0:10:23.387,000 --> 0:10:26,000
so that they can enjoy the kind of life, again, that we take for granted.

177
0:10:27.766,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And third, it had to be cost-effective

178
0:10:30.299,000 --> 0:10:32,000
without subsidy or without mandate.

179
0:10:33.432,000 --> 0:10:35,000
It had to stand on its own two feet;

180
0:10:36.17,000 --> 0:10:39,000
it could not be maintained for that many people

181
0:10:40.073,000 --> 0:10:42,000
if in fact, those countries had to go begging

182
0:10:43.009,000 --> 0:10:46,000
or had some foreign country say, "I won't trade with you,"

183
0:10:47.328,000 --> 0:10:5,000
in order to get the technology shift to occur.

184
0:10:52.168,000 --> 0:10:53,000
If you look at the Chindia test,

185
0:10:53.878,000 --> 0:10:57,000
we simply have not come up with alternatives that meet that test.

186
0:10:58.984,000 --> 0:11:,000
That's what the EIA forecast tells us.

187
0:11:02.765,000 --> 0:11:05,000
China's building 800 gigawatts of coal,

188
0:11:06.866,000 --> 0:11:08,000
400 gigawatts of hydro,

189
0:11:09.772,000 --> 0:11:11,000
about 200 gigawatts of nuclear,

190
0:11:12.501,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and on an energy-equivalent basis, adjusting for intermittency,

191
0:11:16.586,000 --> 0:11:18,000
about 100 gigawatts of renewables.

192
0:11:19.554,000 --> 0:11:2,000
800 gigawatts of coal.

193
0:11:21.805,000 --> 0:11:24,000
They're doing that, knowing the costs better than any other country,

194
0:11:25.381,000 --> 0:11:27,000
knowing the need better than any other country.

195
0:11:28.454,000 --> 0:11:3,000
But that's what they're aiming for in 2040

196
0:11:31.105,000 --> 0:11:33,000
unless we give them a better choice.

197
0:11:34.199,000 --> 0:11:35,000
To give them a better choice,

198
0:11:35.663,000 --> 0:11:37,000
it's going to have to meet the Chindia test.

199
0:11:38.248,000 --> 0:11:4,000
If you look at all the alternatives that are out there,

200
0:11:40.93,000 --> 0:11:42,000
there are really two that come near to meeting it.

201
0:11:43.865,000 --> 0:11:46,000
First is this area of new nuclear that I'll talk about in just a second.

202
0:11:48.107,000 --> 0:11:51,000
It's a new generation of nuclear plants that are on the drawing boards

203
0:11:51.431,000 --> 0:11:52,000
around the world,

204
0:11:52.731,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and the people who are developing these say

205
0:11:55.093,000 --> 0:11:58,000
we can get them in position to demo by 2025

206
0:11:59.252,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and to scale by 2030, if you will just let us.

207
0:12:03.246,000 --> 0:12:05,000
The second alternative that could be there in time

208
0:12:06.771,000 --> 0:12:09,000
is utility-scale solar backed up with natural gas,

209
0:12:10.5,000 --> 0:12:11,000
which we can use today,

210
0:12:12.248,000 --> 0:12:14,000
versus the batteries which are still under development.

211
0:12:16.589,000 --> 0:12:18,000
So what's holding new nuclear back?

212
0:12:19.686,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Outdated regulations and yesterday's mindsets.

213
0:12:23.972,000 --> 0:12:27,000
We have not used our latest scientific thinking on radiological health

214
0:12:28.191,000 --> 0:12:3,000
to think how we communicate with the public

215
0:12:30.903,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and govern the testing of new nuclear reactors.

216
0:12:33.729,000 --> 0:12:37,000
We have new scientific knowledge that we need to use

217
0:12:37.95,000 --> 0:12:41,000
in order to improve the way we regulate nuclear industry.

218
0:12:42.872,000 --> 0:12:44,000
The second thing is we've got a mindset

219
0:12:45.345,000 --> 0:12:47,000
that it takes 25 years and 2 to 5 billion dollars

220
0:12:48.178,000 --> 0:12:49,000
to develop a nuclear power plant.

221
0:12:49.937,000 --> 0:12:52,000
That comes from the historical, military mindset

222
0:12:54.443,000 --> 0:12:56,000
of the places nuclear power came from.

223
0:12:57.356,000 --> 0:12:59,000
These new nuclear ventures are saying

224
0:12:59.591,000 --> 0:13:01,000
that they can deliver power for 5 cents a kilowatt hour;

225
0:13:03.212,000 --> 0:13:05,000
they can deliver it for 100 gigawatts a year;

226
0:13:06.543,000 --> 0:13:08,000
they can demo it by 2025;

227
0:13:09.168,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and they can deliver it in scale by 2030,

228
0:13:12.634,000 --> 0:13:14,000
if only we give them a chance.

229
0:13:16.064,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Right now, we're basically waiting for a miracle.

230
0:13:19.888,000 --> 0:13:2,000
What we need is a choice.

231
0:13:21.952,000 --> 0:13:23,000
If they can't make it safe, if they can't make it cheap,

232
0:13:24.78,000 --> 0:13:25,000
it should not be deployed.

233
0:13:26.621,000 --> 0:13:3,000
But what I want you to do is not carry an idea forward,

234
0:13:30.699,000 --> 0:13:31,000
but write your leaders,

235
0:13:32.374,000 --> 0:13:34,000
write the head of the NGOs you support,

236
0:13:34.776,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and tell them to give you the choice,

237
0:13:38.29,000 --> 0:13:39,000
not the past.

238
0:13:39.465,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Thank you very much.

239
0:13:40.673,000 --> 0:13:44,000
(Applause)

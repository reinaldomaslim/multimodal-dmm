Translator: Camille Martínez

2
0:00:12.82,000 --> 0:00:14,000
This is my favorite place on earth,

3
0:00:15.518,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia.

4
0:00:19.612,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And when it's covered in a thin layer of water,

5
0:00:22.252,000 --> 0:00:23,000
it reflects the clouds.

6
0:00:23.443,000 --> 0:00:27,000
There are days when you feel as if you're floating among the clouds.

7
0:00:28.372,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But there are days when the horizon disappears;

8
0:00:31.293,000 --> 0:00:33,000
there's no longer a top or a bottom.

9
0:00:33.737,000 --> 0:00:36,000
You feel immersed in something bigger.

10
0:00:38.297,000 --> 0:00:41,000
It was there that one night I woke up from a dream,

11
0:00:42.265,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and I saw that the stars were also reflected on the water.

12
0:00:45.863,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And that wasn't a dream.

13
0:00:47.281,000 --> 0:00:49,000
It was as if you could walk among the stars.

14
0:00:50.118,000 --> 0:00:53,000
With every step I took, the stars reverberated under my feet.

15
0:00:53.489,000 --> 0:00:57,000
It was like I was floating in the universe among clouds of galaxies.

16
0:00:59.599,000 --> 0:01:02,000
But what's floating there today are not just clouds of galaxies

17
0:01:02.827,000 --> 0:01:04,000
but also clouds of plastic.

18
0:01:05.033,000 --> 0:01:07,000
These are the footprints we're leaving on the planet.

19
0:01:08.65,000 --> 0:01:1,000
They're signs of an era

20
0:01:10.85,000 --> 0:01:13,000
in which the behavior of some humans is making a global impact

21
0:01:14.828,000 --> 0:01:16,000
on our ecosystems.

22
0:01:18.077,000 --> 0:01:2,000
This era is called the Anthropocene.

23
0:01:21.142,000 --> 0:01:24,000
There's also another type of toxic clouds that float in the air,

24
0:01:24.848,000 --> 0:01:26,000
like the ones that form from carbon dioxide emissions

25
0:01:27.808,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and from the burning of fossil fuels -- oil, carbon, gas --

26
0:01:31.271,000 --> 0:01:33,000
clouds that, when we see them,

27
0:01:33.485,000 --> 0:01:34,000
pollute our dreams.

28
0:01:35.875,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I don't know about all of you,

29
0:01:37.718,000 --> 0:01:39,000
but I've always dreamed of floating among the clouds.

30
0:01:40.354,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Maybe today we can imagine together other types of clouds,

31
0:01:43.951,000 --> 0:01:44,000
clouds we can live with.

32
0:01:46.37,000 --> 0:01:48,000
If you're wondering about that photo, I'll explain:

33
0:01:49.015,000 --> 0:01:51,000
it looks like a collage or photomontage -- something weird.

34
0:01:51.982,000 --> 0:01:52,000
No; it's reality.

35
0:01:53.362,000 --> 0:01:55,000
But sometimes I ask myself: What is reality?

36
0:01:55.912,000 --> 0:01:56,000
According to Alexander Kluge:

37
0:01:57.605,000 --> 0:01:59,000
"Human beings are not interested in reality.

38
0:02:00.193,000 --> 0:02:03,000
They can’t be; it’s part of the human essence.

39
0:02:03.475,000 --> 0:02:04,000
They have desires.

40
0:02:05.797,000 --> 0:02:08,000
These desires are totally opposed to any form of reality.

41
0:02:09.225,000 --> 0:02:1,000
They prefer to lie

42
0:02:10.941,000 --> 0:02:12,000
than to become divorced from their desires."

43
0:02:14.339,000 --> 0:02:16,000
But how can we learn to float among the clouds?

44
0:02:18.817,000 --> 0:02:22,000
As an artist, I thought we could start building a flying museum.

45
0:02:24.278,000 --> 0:02:26,000
You're probably wondering: With plastic bags?

46
0:02:26.446,000 --> 0:02:28,000
In 2007, with a community of people all over the world,

47
0:02:29.41,000 --> 0:02:31,000
we began to collect used plastic bags --

48
0:02:32.312,000 --> 0:02:33,000
not new ones.

49
0:02:33.9,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And we washed them,

50
0:02:36.685,000 --> 0:02:37,000
we cut them up,

51
0:02:38.142,000 --> 0:02:39,000
we glued them together,

52
0:02:39.593,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and we began to draw on them,

53
0:02:41.561,000 --> 0:02:42,000
creating a huge canvas.

54
0:02:43.408,000 --> 0:02:45,000
We made a collection of drawings,

55
0:02:45.432,000 --> 0:02:46,000
of personal stories

56
0:02:46.734,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and of friendships.

57
0:02:48.362,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And when you join them,

58
0:02:50.198,000 --> 0:02:52,000
bend them and fold them,

59
0:02:52.222,000 --> 0:02:54,000
it creates a space full of air.

60
0:02:54.617,000 --> 0:02:56,000
When the sun comes up from the horizon,

61
0:02:58.139,000 --> 0:02:59,000
the museum rises up to the sky.

62
0:03:00.017,000 --> 0:03:02,000
That's why we call it, "The Aero-Solar Museum."

63
0:03:02.352,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And from this simple idea,

64
0:03:03.693,000 --> 0:03:05,000
we learned how to float in the air in a radically new way,

65
0:03:06.604,000 --> 0:03:08,000
without using any type of fuel.

66
0:03:08.848,000 --> 0:03:11,000
The difference in temperature between the interior and the exterior

67
0:03:12.563,000 --> 0:03:14,000
is what makes us rise up.

68
0:03:14.587,000 --> 0:03:15,000
That way,

69
0:03:17.136,000 --> 0:03:21,000
we don't use fossil fuels or helium or hydrogen;

70
0:03:21.323,000 --> 0:03:23,000
we don't use solar panels

71
0:03:23.513,000 --> 0:03:25,000
or batteries or motors.

72
0:03:26.068,000 --> 0:03:31,000
We discovered a way that's simple, clean and accessible to the whole world

73
0:03:31.382,000 --> 0:03:32,000
to lift ourselves up.

74
0:03:32.796,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I remember when I was at NASA in 2009 with 120 engineers.

75
0:03:38.203,000 --> 0:03:4,000
You guys know, too, when you go up in a plane,

76
0:03:40.839,000 --> 0:03:42,000
the control panels are gigantic.

77
0:03:42.926,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And what we're doing is really complex,

78
0:03:46.566,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and when I started coming in with the plastic bags, saying,

79
0:03:49.562,000 --> 0:03:5,000
"But we have a different way ..."

80
0:03:51.245,000 --> 0:03:53,000
people had a hard time understanding the concept.

81
0:03:53.609,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Seeing the power of this idea,

82
0:03:55.177,000 --> 0:03:56,000
we started to initiate a new era;

83
0:03:56.84,000 --> 0:03:58,000
one that would leave behind the violence of the Anthropocene

84
0:03:59.838,000 --> 0:04:,000
and give way to a new era,

85
0:04:01.349,000 --> 0:04:03,000
which we call the "Aerocene" --

86
0:04:03.443,000 --> 0:04:05,000
an era of ecological awareness,

87
0:04:06.283,000 --> 0:04:09,000
in which we learn to float together, live together in the air,

88
0:04:09.484,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and come to an ethical commitment

89
0:04:11.173,000 --> 0:04:13,000
with the atmosphere and with planet earth.

90
0:04:14.297,000 --> 0:04:16,000
That's why I've brought this backpack today.

91
0:04:16.442,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Let's see ...

92
0:04:26.816,000 --> 0:04:29,000
OK. This is a balloon that we also refer to as a sculpture.

93
0:04:30.228,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And if it's sunny out tomorrow, we can go out and fly --

94
0:04:33.142,000 --> 0:04:35,000
though, no, the weather in Vancouver isn't --

95
0:04:35.478,000 --> 0:04:36,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:36.958,000 --> 0:04:38,000
it's not very ...

97
0:04:39.05,000 --> 0:04:4,000
very favorable.

98
0:04:41.346,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So, what other features does it have?

99
0:04:43.443,000 --> 0:04:45,000
It has sensors that, when it moves,

100
0:04:45.83,000 --> 0:04:47,000
make sort of drawings in the air.

101
0:04:48.941,000 --> 0:04:49,000
It also has other sensors.

102
0:04:50.537,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I always think that first you have to feel it,

103
0:04:52.761,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and then you can measure it;

104
0:04:54.875,000 --> 0:04:56,000
you need to hear the sounds of the atmosphere,

105
0:04:57.169,000 --> 0:04:58,000
of the climate, of the hot air,

106
0:04:58.727,000 --> 0:05:,000
in order to then measure the ozone,

107
0:05:00.822,000 --> 0:05:01,000
the carbon dioxide.

108
0:05:02.639,000 --> 0:05:03,000
We're developing these sensors

109
0:05:04.204,000 --> 0:05:06,000
together with different communities all over the world

110
0:05:06.905,000 --> 0:05:09,000
in order to reconnect with the climate, the temperature and the environment,

111
0:05:10.734,000 --> 0:05:12,000
because there are other species in the air;

112
0:05:12.972,000 --> 0:05:14,000
in these excursions towards the atmosphere,

113
0:05:15.044,000 --> 0:05:16,000
we're not alone.

114
0:05:16.231,000 --> 0:05:17,000
The air is full of clouds of life.

115
0:05:18.015,000 --> 0:05:2,000
We live at the bottom of an ocean of air.

116
0:05:20.875,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And this same sculpture,

117
0:05:24.522,000 --> 0:05:25,000
this exact one in my hands,

118
0:05:25.904,000 --> 0:05:27,000
flew 375 miles -- 12 hours -- from Germany to Poland,

119
0:05:28.705,000 --> 0:05:29,000
on a fuel-free trip.

120
0:05:29.907,000 --> 0:05:31,000
But it wasn't free from crossing borders.

121
0:05:32.084,000 --> 0:05:34,000
The trip was much more complicated than what we imagined;

122
0:05:34.974,000 --> 0:05:36,000
air space is as regulated and militarized

123
0:05:37.458,000 --> 0:05:38,000
as land space.

124
0:05:39.243,000 --> 0:05:41,000
To fly using the winds, the heat of the sun

125
0:05:41.716,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and the radiant energy of the earth

126
0:05:43.478,000 --> 0:05:44,000
is complex and beautiful.

127
0:05:45.763,000 --> 0:05:47,000
But even more complex will be getting the permits

128
0:05:48.161,000 --> 0:05:51,000
to cross the air space of each of the different countries

129
0:05:51.225,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that we fly over using wind.

130
0:05:53.614,000 --> 0:05:56,000
At COP21, the Paris Climate Conference,

131
0:05:57.441,000 --> 0:05:59,000
we presented these spherical sculptures

132
0:05:59.587,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that could transport us all over the world.

133
0:06:02.137,000 --> 0:06:05,000
But how can we fly using the wind to arrive at our destination?

134
0:06:06.043,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Together with MIT, we developed a program

135
0:06:08.516,000 --> 0:06:11,000
that predicts how we can navigate the wind highways.

136
0:06:11.62,000 --> 0:06:15,000
For example, if I had to return to Berlin from Vancouver,

137
0:06:15.665,000 --> 0:06:17,000
the first thing I would need to do is choose an altitude.

138
0:06:18.38,000 --> 0:06:2,000
At different altitudes, there are different directions

139
0:06:21.712,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and different speeds.

140
0:06:23.855,000 --> 0:06:26,000
The red line is tomorrow and the orange, the day after tomorrow.

141
0:06:27.002,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And there it goes.

142
0:06:28.194,000 --> 0:06:31,000
You can see, the best day to fly back to Berlin --

143
0:06:32.414,000 --> 0:06:34,000
so now, traveling using only wind --

144
0:06:35.934,000 --> 0:06:36,000
is in six days.

145
0:06:37.399,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And we can get to 105 miles from the center of Berlin

146
0:06:40.481,000 --> 0:06:41,000
without burning a single drop of fuel,

147
0:06:42.414,000 --> 0:06:44,000
being transported only by wind currents.

148
0:06:45.325,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So we thought that these trajectories that we drew with the wind

149
0:06:49.227,000 --> 0:06:53,000
could become signatures, declaring "Independence from Fossil Fuels Day."

150
0:06:54.508,000 --> 0:06:56,000
More and more of us are experiencing the air

151
0:06:57.222,000 --> 0:06:58,000
in a different way.

152
0:06:58.959,000 --> 0:07:,000
You're all familiar with Earth Day.

153
0:07:01.104,000 --> 0:07:03,000
We think we should also celebrate Air Day:

154
0:07:03.868,000 --> 0:07:04,000
it's a pact that we make with the earth,

155
0:07:05.878,000 --> 0:07:07,000
an ethical commitment to the atmosphere.

156
0:07:09.673,000 --> 0:07:11,000
But let's keep thinking and dreaming.

157
0:07:11.749,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We've learned that the bigger the sculptures are,

158
0:07:16.019,000 --> 0:07:18,000
the more weight they can lift.

159
0:07:18.701,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Remember,

160
0:07:20.467,000 --> 0:07:24,000
they rise up only with hot air that's been heated by the sun.

161
0:07:25.968,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Using this approach, we can learn to build gardens in the air.

162
0:07:29.579,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Could we one day live in a garden the size of the earth?

163
0:07:33.268,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Could we live in an ecosystem floating among the clouds?

164
0:07:37.264,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Answering these questions isn't just a technological challenge;

165
0:07:40.915,000 --> 0:07:44,000
it's a way to reexamine the freedom of movement between countries,

166
0:07:46.122,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and of overcoming the political, social, cultural and military restrictions

167
0:07:49.933,000 --> 0:07:5,000
of contemporary societies.

168
0:07:51.645,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Because in the end,

169
0:07:53.342,000 --> 0:07:54,000
the air belongs to everybody

170
0:07:55.063,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and doesn't answer to any government.

171
0:07:58.364,000 --> 0:08:04,000
(Applause)

172
0:08:05.208,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And like we said earlier,

173
0:08:06.553,000 --> 0:08:1,000
our imagination is the force that allows us to create these places.

174
0:08:10.708,000 --> 0:08:11,000
This is an installation I did

175
0:08:12.423,000 --> 0:08:14,000
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

176
0:08:14.854,000 --> 0:08:15,000
It asks the question:

177
0:08:16.155,000 --> 0:08:18,000
What might these transnational spaces be like?

178
0:08:18.923,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And once we inhabit those spaces, we need to learn how to move within them,

179
0:08:23.859,000 --> 0:08:25,000
to walk among the clouds,

180
0:08:26.391,000 --> 0:08:29,000
where every movement affects everyone else's movements;

181
0:08:29.788,000 --> 0:08:32,000
the body weight and proximity between people

182
0:08:32.989,000 --> 0:08:34,000
will cause the space to expand ...

183
0:08:35.037,000 --> 0:08:36,000
or contract.

184
0:08:38.25,000 --> 0:08:41,000
There we are, suspended 72 feet in the air.

185
0:08:41.369,000 --> 0:08:44,000
When two or more people get too close together,

186
0:08:44.607,000 --> 0:08:47,000
even those farthest away are affected --

187
0:08:48.036,000 --> 0:08:5,000
everyone falls to the same spot.

188
0:08:50.361,000 --> 0:08:52,000
These are fragile ecosystems.

189
0:08:53.763,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And it's between these spheres that we build nets that connect us.

190
0:08:58.133,000 --> 0:09:01,000
There are moments when we have to face the void,

191
0:09:01.575,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and fear can paralyze us.

192
0:09:04.279,000 --> 0:09:06,000
One of the most beautiful things about this exhibit

193
0:09:06.756,000 --> 0:09:07,000
is the sense of solidarity generated

194
0:09:08.557,000 --> 0:09:1,000
when we face these new "aero-graphs."

195
0:09:11.713,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Finally,

196
0:09:13.293,000 --> 0:09:15,000
let me tell you one last story.

197
0:09:15.317,000 --> 0:09:17,000
On July 16, 1945,

198
0:09:17.515,000 --> 0:09:19,000
on the White Sands of New Mexico,

199
0:09:19.539,000 --> 0:09:22,000
an atomic bomb was detonated for the first time.

200
0:09:23.523,000 --> 0:09:24,000
As a result of this explosion,

201
0:09:25.155,000 --> 0:09:29,000
a cloud of radioactive particles disseminated all over the earth,

202
0:09:29.753,000 --> 0:09:31,000
marking the beginning of the Anthropocene era.

203
0:09:33.36,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Seventy years later, on November 8, 2015,

204
0:09:36.581,000 --> 0:09:37,000
in the same place,

205
0:09:38.159,000 --> 0:09:39,000
another event occurred.

206
0:09:40.381,000 --> 0:09:41,000
For the first time in history,

207
0:09:42.159,000 --> 0:09:45,000
we lifted a person into the air using only the sun,

208
0:09:45.341,000 --> 0:09:47,000
without burning any fossil fuels.

209
0:09:48.138,000 --> 0:09:5,000
As the sun rose up above the horizon,

210
0:09:50.664,000 --> 0:09:51,000
we rose up, too,

211
0:09:52.325,000 --> 0:09:53,000
silently,

212
0:09:54.013,000 --> 0:09:55,000
slowly,

213
0:09:55.204,000 --> 0:09:56,000
with no explosions.

214
0:09:56.734,000 --> 0:09:58,000
We felt as if gravity had been inverted;

215
0:09:59.945,000 --> 0:10:01,000
it wasn't pulling us toward the center of the earth,

216
0:10:02.795,000 --> 0:10:03,000
but toward the universe.

217
0:10:05.201,000 --> 0:10:07,000
If Neil Armstrong said, when he walked on the moon,

218
0:10:07.86,000 --> 0:10:08,000
"That's one small step for man,

219
0:10:09.65,000 --> 0:10:11,000
one giant leap for mankind,"

220
0:10:12.451,000 --> 0:10:14,000
perhaps what we ought to ask ourselves is:

221
0:10:14.475,000 --> 0:10:16,000
What steps do we need to take today?

222
0:10:17.199,000 --> 0:10:19,000
In the Aerocene era,

223
0:10:19.655,000 --> 0:10:22,000
our steps are much smaller, but radically different;

224
0:10:23.88,000 --> 0:10:27,000
they're steps that began with a bag full of air and wishes,

225
0:10:29.1,000 --> 0:10:32,000
but that can carry us to independence from fossil fuels

226
0:10:33.054,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and the opportunity to celebrate Air Day;

227
0:10:35.087,000 --> 0:10:38,000
steps that won't leave footprints on other planets

228
0:10:38.428,000 --> 0:10:42,000
until we've learned to walk in the atmosphere of this one.

229
0:10:42.703,000 --> 0:10:44,000
The landscapes are tiny

230
0:10:44.782,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and the steps are tiny,

231
0:10:46.376,000 --> 0:10:48,000
but I hope we can take them together.

232
0:10:48.798,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And I'm sure that these steps will lead us much further than the moon,

233
0:10:52.646,000 --> 0:10:55,000
so we can learn to float with our feet on the ground.

234
0:10:56.57,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Thank you.

235
0:10:57.756,000 --> 0:11:,000
(Applause)

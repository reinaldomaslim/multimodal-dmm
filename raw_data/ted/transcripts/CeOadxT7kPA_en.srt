1
0:00:17.553,000 --> 0:00:2,000
These are sequences from a play called "The Lehman Trilogy,"

2
0:00:21.342,000 --> 0:00:26,000
which traces the origins of Western capitalism

3
0:00:26.408,000 --> 0:00:27,000
in three hours,

4
0:00:27.851,000 --> 0:00:29,000
with three actors and a piano.

5
0:00:31.356,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And my role was to create a stage design

6
0:00:35.209,000 --> 0:00:38,000
to write a visual language for this work.

7
0:00:39.699,000 --> 0:00:42,000
The play describes Atlantic crossings,

8
0:00:43.007,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Alabama cotton fields,

9
0:00:44.884,000 --> 0:00:46,000
New York skylines,

10
0:00:47.058,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and we framed the whole thing within this single revolving cube,

11
0:00:53.339,000 --> 0:00:56,000
a kind of kinetic cinema through the centuries.

12
0:00:57.715,000 --> 0:00:59,000
It's like a musical instrument

13
0:01:00.342,000 --> 0:01:01,000
played by three performers.

14
0:01:03.159,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And as they step their way around and through

15
0:01:06.392,000 --> 0:01:08,000
the lives of the Lehman brothers,

16
0:01:08.98,000 --> 0:01:1,000
we, the audience,

17
0:01:11.489,000 --> 0:01:14,000
begin to connect with the simple, human origins

18
0:01:15.456,000 --> 0:01:19,000
at the root of the complex global financial systems

19
0:01:19.69,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that we're all still in thrall to today.

20
0:01:23.462,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I used to play musical instruments myself when I was younger.

21
0:01:27.65,000 --> 0:01:28,000
My favorite was the violin.

22
0:01:31.227,000 --> 0:01:33,000
It was this intimate transfer of energy.

23
0:01:34.044,000 --> 0:01:37,000
You held this organic sculpture up to your heart,

24
0:01:37.906,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and you poured the energy of your whole body

25
0:01:40.624,000 --> 0:01:44,000
into this little piece of wood, and heard it translated into music.

26
0:01:46.088,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And I was never particularly good at the violin,

27
0:01:49.094,000 --> 0:01:54,000
but I used to sit at the back of the second violin section

28
0:01:54.302,000 --> 0:01:56,000
in the Hastings Youth Orchestra,

29
0:01:57.038,000 --> 0:01:58,000
scratching away.

30
0:01:59.163,000 --> 0:02:01,000
We were all scratching

31
0:02:01.896,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and marveling at this symphonic sound that we were making

32
0:02:06.186,000 --> 0:02:08,000
that was so much more beautiful and powerful

33
0:02:08.307,000 --> 0:02:1,000
than anything we would ever have managed on our own.

34
0:02:11.836,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And now, as I create large-scale performances,

35
0:02:16.355,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I am always working with teams

36
0:02:17.943,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that are at least the size of a symphony orchestra.

37
0:02:21.763,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And whether we are creating

38
0:02:24.268,000 --> 0:02:27,000
these revolving giant chess piece time tunnels

39
0:02:28.276,000 --> 0:02:3,000
for an opera by Richard Wagner

40
0:02:30.883,000 --> 0:02:33,000
or shark tanks and mountains for Kanye West,

41
0:02:34.753,000 --> 0:02:39,000
we're always seeking to create the most articulate sculpture,

42
0:02:40.532,000 --> 0:02:43,000
the most poetic instrument of communication to an audience.

43
0:02:44.871,000 --> 0:02:45,000
When I say poetic,

44
0:02:47.426,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I just mean language at its most condensed,

45
0:02:50.799,000 --> 0:02:51,000
like a song lyric,

46
0:02:53.204,000 --> 0:02:56,000
a poetic puzzle to be unlocked and unpacked.

47
0:02:57.015,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And when we were preparing to design Beyoncé's "Formation" tour,

48
0:03:01.696,000 --> 0:03:03,000
we looked at all the lyrics,

49
0:03:04.093,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and we came across this poem that Beyoncé wrote.

50
0:03:09.191,000 --> 0:03:13,000
"I saw a TV preacher when I was scared, at four or five about bad dreams

51
0:03:13.987,000 --> 0:03:17,000
who promised he'd say a prayer if I put my hand to the TV.

52
0:03:18.48,000 --> 0:03:23,000
That's the first time I remember prayer, an electric current running through me."

53
0:03:23.678,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And this TV that transmitted prayer to Beyoncé as a child

54
0:03:28.147,000 --> 0:03:31,000
became this monolithic revolving sculpture

55
0:03:31.367,000 --> 0:03:34,000
that broadcast Beyoncé to the back of the stadium.

56
0:03:36.003,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And the stadium is a mass congregation.

57
0:03:40.795,000 --> 0:03:43,000
It's a temporary population of a hundred thousand people

58
0:03:43.845,000 --> 0:03:46,000
who have all come there to sing along with every word together,

59
0:03:47.222,000 --> 0:03:52,000
but they've also come there each seeking one-to-one intimacy

60
0:03:52.869,000 --> 0:03:53,000
with the performer.

61
0:03:54.863,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And we, as we conceive the show, we have to provide intimacy

62
0:03:58,000 --> 0:03:59,000
on a grand scale.

63
0:04:00.705,000 --> 0:04:01,000
It usually starts with sketches.

64
0:04:02.631,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I was drawing this 60-foot-high, revolving,

65
0:04:07.441,000 --> 0:04:09,000
broadcast-quality portrait of the artist,

66
0:04:11.055,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and then I tore the piece of paper in half.

67
0:04:13.459,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I split the mask

68
0:04:15.302,000 --> 0:04:18,000
to try to access the human underneath it all.

69
0:04:19.741,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And it's one thing to do sketches, but of course translating from a sketch

70
0:04:23.479,000 --> 0:04:26,000
into a tourable revolving six-story building

71
0:04:27.356,000 --> 0:04:3,000
took some exceptional engineers working around the clock for three months,

72
0:04:31.278,000 --> 0:04:34,000
until finally we arrived in Miami

73
0:04:34.914,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and opened the show in April 2016.

74
0:04:37.541,000 --> 0:04:42,000
(Video: Cheers)

75
0:04:43.379,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Music: "Formation," Beyoncé)

76
0:04:45.998,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Beyoncé: Y'all haters corny with that Illuminati mess

77
0:04:50.387,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Paparazzi, catch my fly, and my cocky fresh

78
0:04:54.244,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I'm so reckless when I rock my Givenchy dress

79
0:04:58.072,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I'm so possessive so I rock his Roc necklaces

80
0:05:01.93,000 --> 0:05:02,000
My daddy Alabama

81
0:05:03.842,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Momma Louisiana

82
0:05:05.811,000 --> 0:05:07,000
You mix that negro with that Creole

83
0:05:07.986,000 --> 0:05:08,000
make a Texas bama

84
0:05:10.533,000 --> 0:05:11,000
(Music ends)

85
0:05:12.422,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I call my work --

86
0:05:13.97,000 --> 0:05:14,000
(Cheers, applause)

87
0:05:14.995,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Thank you.

88
0:05:16.169,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Cheers, applause)

89
0:05:17.861,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I call my work stage sculpture,

90
0:05:21.836,000 --> 0:05:25,000
but of course what's really being sculpted is the experience of the audience,

91
0:05:26.052,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and as directors and designers,

92
0:05:28.353,000 --> 0:05:29,000
we have to take responsibility

93
0:05:29.829,000 --> 0:05:31,000
for every minute that the audience spend with us.

94
0:05:33.045,000 --> 0:05:35,000
We're a bit like pilots

95
0:05:35.287,000 --> 0:05:39,000
navigating a flight path for a hundred thousand passengers.

96
0:05:40.413,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And in the case of the Canadian artist The Weeknd,

97
0:05:44.034,000 --> 0:05:46,000
we translated this flight path literally

98
0:05:46.716,000 --> 0:05:5,000
into an origami paper folding airplane

99
0:05:51.11,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that took off over the heads of the audience,

100
0:05:53.686,000 --> 0:05:55,000
broke apart in mid-flight, complications,

101
0:05:56.091,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and then rose out of the ashes restored

102
0:05:59.693,000 --> 0:06:,000
at the end of the show.

103
0:06:01.504,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And like any flight,

104
0:06:04.256,000 --> 0:06:07,000
the most delicate part is the liftoff, the beginning,

105
0:06:07.496,000 --> 0:06:08,000
because when you design a pop concert,

106
0:06:09.387,000 --> 0:06:11,000
the prime material that you're working with

107
0:06:12.399,000 --> 0:06:16,000
is something that doesn't take trucks or crew to transport it.

108
0:06:16.971,000 --> 0:06:17,000
It doesn't cost anything,

109
0:06:18.485,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and yet it fills every atom of air in the arena, before the show starts.

110
0:06:23.938,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It's the audience's anticipation.

111
0:06:27.786,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Everyone brings with them the story of how they came to get there,

112
0:06:30.918,000 --> 0:06:31,000
the distances they traveled,

113
0:06:32.34,000 --> 0:06:34,000
the months they had to work to pay for the tickets.

114
0:06:34.767,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Sometimes they sleep overnight outside the arena,

115
0:06:38.272,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and our first task is to deliver for an audience on their anticipation,

116
0:06:42.998,000 --> 0:06:45,000
to deliver their first sight of the performer.

117
0:06:48.404,000 --> 0:06:49,000
When I work with men,

118
0:06:51.032,000 --> 0:06:55,000
they're quite happy to have their music transformed into metaphor --

119
0:06:55.564,000 --> 0:06:56,000
spaceflights, mountains.

120
0:06:58.917,000 --> 0:07:02,000
But with women, we work a lot with masks and with three-dimensional portraiture,

121
0:07:03.83,000 --> 0:07:05,000
because the fans of the female artist

122
0:07:06.354,000 --> 0:07:07,000
crave her face.

123
0:07:09.746,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And when the audience arrived to see Adele's first live concert in five years,

124
0:07:14.772,000 --> 0:07:16,000
they were met with this image of her eyes asleep.

125
0:07:18.964,000 --> 0:07:19,000
If they listened carefully,

126
0:07:20.788,000 --> 0:07:24,000
they would hear her sleeping breath echoing around the arena,

127
0:07:24.843,000 --> 0:07:26,000
waiting to wake up.

128
0:07:26.912,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Here's how the show began.

129
0:07:28.775,000 --> 0:07:33,000
(Video: Cheers, applause)

130
0:07:34.315,000 --> 0:07:35,000
(Music)

131
0:07:35.34,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Adele: Hello.

132
0:07:36.641,000 --> 0:07:42,000
(Cheers, applause)

133
0:07:48.062,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Es Devlin: With U2, we're navigating the audience

134
0:07:50.79,000 --> 0:07:55,000
over a terrain that spans three decades of politics, poetry and music.

135
0:07:56.949,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And over many months, meeting with the band and their creative teams,

136
0:08:00.557,000 --> 0:08:01,000
this is the sketch that kept recurring,

137
0:08:02.438,000 --> 0:08:04,000
this line, this street,

138
0:08:06.483,000 --> 0:08:08,000
the street that connects the band's past with their present,

139
0:08:09.318,000 --> 0:08:12,000
the tightrope that they walk as activists and artists,

140
0:08:13.3,000 --> 0:08:14,000
a walk through cinema

141
0:08:14.99,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that allows the band to become protagonists

142
0:08:17.899,000 --> 0:08:18,000
in their own poetry.

143
0:08:19.105,000 --> 0:08:22,000
(Music: U2's "Where the Streets Have No Name")

144
0:08:22.479,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Bono: I wanna run

145
0:08:26.041,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I want to hide

146
0:08:29.82,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I wanna tear down the walls

147
0:08:33.701,000 --> 0:08:36,000
That hold me inside

148
0:08:38.593,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Es Devlin: The end of the show is like the end of a flight.

149
0:08:41.476,000 --> 0:08:42,000
It's an arrival.

150
0:08:42.958,000 --> 0:08:46,000
It's a transfer from the stage out to the audience.

151
0:08:47.978,000 --> 0:08:49,000
For the British band Take That,

152
0:08:50.345,000 --> 0:08:54,000
we ended the show by sending an 80-foot high mechanical human figure

153
0:08:54.861,000 --> 0:08:56,000
out to the center of the crowd.

154
0:08:57.087,000 --> 0:09:04,000
(Music)

155
0:09:05.546,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Like many translations from music to mechanics,

156
0:09:08.853,000 --> 0:09:11,000
this one was initially deemed entirely technically impossible.

157
0:09:13.039,000 --> 0:09:16,000
The first three engineers we took it to said no,

158
0:09:16.452,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and eventually, the way that it was achieved

159
0:09:18.865,000 --> 0:09:21,000
was by keeping the entire control system together

160
0:09:22.554,000 --> 0:09:23,000
while it toured around the country,

161
0:09:24.245,000 --> 0:09:26,000
so we had to fold it up onto a flatbed truck

162
0:09:27.147,000 --> 0:09:29,000
so it could tour around without coming apart.

163
0:09:29.322,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And of course, what this meant was that the dimension of its head

164
0:09:32.918,000 --> 0:09:33,000
was entirely determined

165
0:09:34.918,000 --> 0:09:38,000
by the lowest motorway bridge that it had to travel under on its tour.

166
0:09:39.735,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And I have to tell you that it turns out

167
0:09:42.205,000 --> 0:09:45,000
there is an unavoidable and annoyingly low bridge

168
0:09:45.918,000 --> 0:09:46,000
low bridge just outside Hamburg.

169
0:09:47.479,000 --> 0:09:5,000
(Laughter)

170
0:09:50.832,000 --> 0:09:55,000
(Music)

171
0:09:56.823,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Another of the most technically complex pieces that we've worked on

172
0:10:01.855,000 --> 0:10:02,000
is the opera "Carmen"

173
0:10:03.556,000 --> 0:10:05,000
at Bregenz Festival in Austria.

174
0:10:07.258,000 --> 0:10:11,000
We envisaged Carmen's hands rising out of Lake Constance,

175
0:10:11.752,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and throwing this deck of cards in the air

176
0:10:13.869,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and leaving them suspended between sky and sea.

177
0:10:16.64,000 --> 0:10:2,000
But this transient gesture, this flick of the wrists

178
0:10:20.814,000 --> 0:10:22,000
had to become a structure that would be strong enough

179
0:10:23.6,000 --> 0:10:25,000
to withstand two Austrian winters.

180
0:10:27.123,000 --> 0:10:29,000
So there's an awful lot that you don't see in this photograph

181
0:10:30.098,000 --> 0:10:31,000
that's working really hard.

182
0:10:32.099,000 --> 0:10:35,000
It's a lot of ballast and structure and support around the back,

183
0:10:36.091,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and I'm going to show you the photos that aren't on my website.

184
0:10:40.075,000 --> 0:10:42,000
They're photos of the back of a set,

185
0:10:42.205,000 --> 0:10:45,000
the part that's not designed for the audience to see,

186
0:10:46.27,000 --> 0:10:47,000
however much work it's doing.

187
0:10:52.185,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And you know, this is actually the dilemma

188
0:10:55.962,000 --> 0:10:57,000
for an artist who is working as a stage designer,

189
0:10:58.356,000 --> 0:11:02,000
because so much of what I make is fake,

190
0:11:03.256,000 --> 0:11:04,000
it's an illusion.

191
0:11:06.073,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And yet every artist works in pursuit of communicating something that's true.

192
0:11:12.033,000 --> 0:11:15,000
But we are always asking ourselves:

193
0:11:15.112,000 --> 0:11:17,000
"Can we communicate truth using things that are false?"

194
0:11:20.264,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And now when I attend the shows that I've worked on,

195
0:11:23.716,000 --> 0:11:26,000
I often find I'm the only one who is not looking at the stage.

196
0:11:28.404,000 --> 0:11:33,000
I'm looking at something that I find equally fascinating,

197
0:11:33.703,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and it's the audience.

198
0:11:34.888,000 --> 0:11:35,000
(Cheers)

199
0:11:36.887,000 --> 0:11:37,000
I mean, where else do you witness this:

200
0:11:38.808,000 --> 0:11:39,000
(Cheers)

201
0:11:39.833,000 --> 0:11:42,000
this many humans, connected, focused,

202
0:11:43.483,000 --> 0:11:46,000
undistracted and unfragmented?

203
0:11:48.573,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And lately, I've begun to make work that originates here,

204
0:11:52.478,000 --> 0:11:54,000
in the collective voice of the audience.

205
0:11:56.535,000 --> 0:11:59,000
"Poem Portraits" is a collective poem.

206
0:12:00.669,000 --> 0:12:02,000
It began at the Serpentine Gallery in London,

207
0:12:03.051,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and everybody is invited to donate one word to a collective poem.

208
0:12:08.98,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And instead of that large single LED portrait

209
0:12:12.346,000 --> 0:12:14,000
that was broadcasting to the back of the stadium,

210
0:12:14.742,000 --> 0:12:16,000
in this case, every member of the audience

211
0:12:17.06,000 --> 0:12:19,000
gets to take their own portrait home with them,

212
0:12:19.329,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and it's woven in with the words

213
0:12:21.815,000 --> 0:12:23,000
that they've contributed to the collective poem.

214
0:12:24.632,000 --> 0:12:27,000
So they keep a fragment of an ever-evolving collective work.

215
0:12:29.833,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And next year, the collective poem will take architectural form.

216
0:12:35.64,000 --> 0:12:4,000
This is the design for the UK Pavilion at the World Expo 2020.

217
0:12:42.569,000 --> 0:12:43,000
The UK ...

218
0:12:45.089,000 --> 0:12:47,000
In my lifetime, it's never felt this divided.

219
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
It's never felt this noisy with divergent voices.

220
0:12:53.233,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And it's never felt this much in need of places

221
0:12:56.32,000 --> 0:12:58,000
where voices might connect and converge.

222
0:12:58.38,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And it's my hope that this wooden sculpture,

223
0:13:02.263,000 --> 0:13:04,000
this wooden instrument, a bit like that violin I used to play,

224
0:13:05.193,000 --> 0:13:1,000
might be a place where people can play and enter their word

225
0:13:10.846,000 --> 0:13:11,000
at one end of the cone,

226
0:13:12.447,000 --> 0:13:14,000
emerge at the other end of the building,

227
0:13:14.767,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and find that their word has joined a collective poem, a collective voice.

228
0:13:20.796,000 --> 0:13:27,000
(Music)

229
0:13:34.149,000 --> 0:13:37,000
These are simple experiments in machine learning.

230
0:13:38.769,000 --> 0:13:43,000
The algorithm that generates the collective poem is pretty simple.

231
0:13:44.131,000 --> 0:13:45,000
It's like predictive text,

232
0:13:45.862,000 --> 0:13:5,000
only it's trained on millions of words written by poets in the 19th century.

233
0:13:51.716,000 --> 0:13:55,000
So it's a sort of convergence of intelligence, past and present,

234
0:13:56.72,000 --> 0:13:57,000
organic and inorganic.

235
0:13:59.547,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And we were inspired by the words of Stephen Hawking.

236
0:14:02.785,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Towards the end of his life, he asked quite a simple question:

237
0:14:06.42,000 --> 0:14:12,000
If we as a species were ever to come across another advanced life-form,

238
0:14:12.743,000 --> 0:14:14,000
an advanced civilization,

239
0:14:15.215,000 --> 0:14:16,000
how would we speak to them?

240
0:14:17.808,000 --> 0:14:2,000
What collective language would we speak as a planet?

241
0:14:23.941,000 --> 0:14:26,000
The language of light reaches every audience.

242
0:14:28.474,000 --> 0:14:3,000
All of us are touched by it. None of us can hold it.

243
0:14:32.514,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And in the theater, we begin each work in a dark place, devoid of light.

244
0:14:38.101,000 --> 0:14:41,000
We stay up all night focusing the lights, programming the lights,

245
0:14:42.812,000 --> 0:14:44,000
trying to find new ways to sculpt and carve light.

246
0:14:47.074,000 --> 0:14:51,000
(Music)

247
0:14:51.469,000 --> 0:14:55,000
This is a portrait of our practice,

248
0:14:57.494,000 --> 0:15:01,000
always seeking new ways to shape and reshape light,

249
0:15:01.599,000 --> 0:15:05,000
always finding words for things that we no longer need to say.

250
0:15:08.637,000 --> 0:15:11,000
And I want to say that this,

251
0:15:13.218,000 --> 0:15:15,000
and everything that I've just shown you,

252
0:15:15.771,000 --> 0:15:17,000
no longer exists in physical form.

253
0:15:18.099,000 --> 0:15:2,000
(Music)

254
0:15:20.955,000 --> 0:15:22,000
In fact, most of what I've made over the last 25 years

255
0:15:23.545,000 --> 0:15:24,000
doesn't exist anymore.

256
0:15:25.286,000 --> 0:15:29,000
But our work endures in memories, in synaptic sculptures,

257
0:15:29.862,000 --> 0:15:32,000
in the minds of those who were once present

258
0:15:33.085,000 --> 0:15:34,000
in the audience.

259
0:15:34.529,000 --> 0:15:36,000
(Music)

260
0:15:37.462,000 --> 0:15:41,000
I once read that a poem learnt by heart

261
0:15:43.231,000 --> 0:15:45,000
is what you have left,

262
0:15:45.422,000 --> 0:15:47,000
what can't be lost,

263
0:15:47.554,000 --> 0:15:51,000
even if your house burns down and you've lost all your possessions.

264
0:15:51.71,000 --> 0:15:55,000
I want to end with some lines that I learnt by heart a long time ago.

265
0:15:56.578,000 --> 0:15:58,000
(Music)

266
0:15:59.123,000 --> 0:16:01,000
They're written by the English novelist E.M. Forster,

267
0:16:02.028,000 --> 0:16:06,000
in 1910, just a few years before Europe, my continent,

268
0:16:06.694,000 --> 0:16:07,000
(Music)

269
0:16:08.349,000 --> 0:16:09,000
began tearing itself apart.

270
0:16:10.119,000 --> 0:16:11,000
(Music)

271
0:16:12.041,000 --> 0:16:14,000
And his call to convergence still resonates

272
0:16:14.906,000 --> 0:16:16,000
through most of what we're trying to make now.

273
0:16:17.302,000 --> 0:16:18,000
(Music)

274
0:16:18.794,000 --> 0:16:22,000
"Only connect! That was the whole of her sermon.

275
0:16:23.776,000 --> 0:16:26,000
Only connect the prose and the passion,

276
0:16:26.889,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and both will be exalted,

277
0:16:29.914,000 --> 0:16:33,000
And human love will be seen at its height.

278
0:16:34.248,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Only connect! And live in fragments no longer."

279
0:16:41.09,000 --> 0:16:42,000
Thank you.

280
0:16:42.265,000 --> 0:16:49,000
(Applause)

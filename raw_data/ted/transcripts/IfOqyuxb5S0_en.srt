A few years ago,

3
0:00:13.875,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I had a corporate feminist dream job.

4
0:00:17.583,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Launching a company's national initiative

5
0:00:20.083,000 --> 0:00:22,000
to recruit more female employees.

6
0:00:22.542,000 --> 0:00:23,000
In the finance sector.

7
0:00:24.875,000 --> 0:00:26,000
But first, I had to get the signed-off support

8
0:00:27.875,000 --> 0:00:28,000
of all department heads.

9
0:00:29.625,000 --> 0:00:31,000
So I spent months perfecting the proposal,

10
0:00:32.458,000 --> 0:00:33,000
presented it

11
0:00:33.792,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and won the support of almost everyone.

12
0:00:38.542,000 --> 0:00:42,000
But in this team, there were two men we'll call Howard and Tom.

13
0:00:43.958,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Howard just would not get back to me.

14
0:00:46.917,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I emailed him about the proposal,

15
0:00:48.792,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I left him voice mails,

16
0:00:50.667,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I'd roll my chair back and forth during meetings,

17
0:00:53.208,000 --> 0:00:54,000
trying to make eye contact with Howard.

18
0:00:55.09,000 --> 0:00:56,000
(Laughter)

19
0:00:56.125,000 --> 0:00:59,000
He'd just take out his phone and start scrolling.

20
0:01:00.5,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And then I started to question myself.

21
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Had I been diplomatic enough in that email?

22
0:01:07.625,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Too demanding in that voice mail?

23
0:01:09.708,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Does Howard hate this proposal

24
0:01:12.375,000 --> 0:01:14,000
or am I just overreacting?

25
0:01:14.958,000 --> 0:01:17,000
It's probably just me, I thought.

26
0:01:18.167,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And then one day,

27
0:01:19.583,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I'm walking down the hall and here comes Howard.

28
0:01:23.542,000 --> 0:01:24,000
He's holding a packet of papers,

29
0:01:25.375,000 --> 0:01:27,000
sees me and lights up.

30
0:01:27.708,000 --> 0:01:28,000
He says,

31
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:32,000
"Sara, Tom just emailed this to me, you should take a look.

32
0:01:32.042,000 --> 0:01:35,000
It's a proposal for us to recruit more women."

33
0:01:35.167,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:36.458,000 --> 0:01:38,000
"I think Tom has a really great idea here,

35
0:01:38.625,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and we should all get behind it."

36
0:01:42.042,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Howard proceeds to hand my own proposal back to me.

37
0:01:46.208,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And explains to me the many merits of what I wrote.

38
0:01:49.375,000 --> 0:01:51,000
(Laughter)

39
0:01:53.375,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Howard was never against recruiting more women.

40
0:01:57,000 --> 0:01:59,000
But he needed to hear from a man

41
0:01:59.667,000 --> 0:02:02,000
why it was important to hire more women.

42
0:02:03.708,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And as this scene played out,

43
0:02:06.292,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I said nothing.

44
0:02:09.625,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Because I knew somehow that I was a guest

45
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:17,000
in a place that wasn't meant for me.

46
0:02:18.292,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And so instead of questioning my environment,

47
0:02:21.25,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I questioned myself.

48
0:02:24.625,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I wanted to know

49
0:02:26.125,000 --> 0:02:29,000
how so many talented women who worked long hours

50
0:02:29.5,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and started their careers with confidence

51
0:02:31.917,000 --> 0:02:35,000
all became trained in this kind of self-doubt that makes them say,

52
0:02:36.292,000 --> 0:02:37,000
"It's probably just me."

53
0:02:39.083,000 --> 0:02:4,000
How was that still possible?

54
0:02:41.042,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Aren't things getting better?

55
0:02:43.5,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Opportunities for women have increased over the last 50 years.

56
0:02:48.25,000 --> 0:02:51,000
But over the last decade, progress has stalled.

57
0:02:51.333,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Experts have previously identified 2059

58
0:02:56.042,000 --> 0:02:58,000
as the year the wage gap would close.

59
0:02:58.792,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But in September of this year,

60
0:03:00.667,000 --> 0:03:03,000
these same experts announced that according to the most current data,

61
0:03:04.292,000 --> 0:03:07,000
we'll have to adjust our expectations

62
0:03:07.708,000 --> 0:03:09,000
to the year 2119.

63
0:03:10.333,000 --> 0:03:11,000
(Audience murmurs)

64
0:03:11.625,000 --> 0:03:14,000
One hundred one years from now.

65
0:03:15.125,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Looking beyond the wage gap,

66
0:03:17.292,000 --> 0:03:2,000
women are still underrepresented in leadership,

67
0:03:20.333,000 --> 0:03:22,000
receive less access to senior leaders

68
0:03:23.208,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and are leaving the fastest-growing sectors,

69
0:03:25.542,000 --> 0:03:26,000
such as tech,

70
0:03:26.875,000 --> 0:03:3,000
at 45 percent higher rates than men,

71
0:03:30.958,000 --> 0:03:34,000
citing culture as the primary reason.

72
0:03:35.875,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So what have we been doing to address gender inequality?

73
0:03:39.042,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Why isn't it working?

74
0:03:41.167,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Many businesses think they're addressing the problem,

75
0:03:43.833,000 --> 0:03:45,000
because they provide training.

76
0:03:46.167,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Eight billion dollars worth of training a year,

77
0:03:50.875,000 --> 0:03:53,000
according to studies from the "Harvard Business Review."

78
0:03:54.167,000 --> 0:03:58,000
These same studies also conclude that these trainings don't work

79
0:03:58.333,000 --> 0:04:,000
and often backfire.

80
0:04:01.292,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Research tracking the hiring and promotion practices of 830 companies

81
0:04:06.083,000 --> 0:04:07,000
over the course of 30 years

82
0:04:08.083,000 --> 0:04:12,000
found that white men who are asked to go to diversity trainings

83
0:04:12.708,000 --> 0:04:13,000
tend to rebel

84
0:04:14.542,000 --> 0:04:17,000
by hiring and promoting fewer women

85
0:04:17.833,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and fewer minorities.

86
0:04:20.458,000 --> 0:04:25,000
The other solution has been to ask women to change their own behavior.

87
0:04:25.917,000 --> 0:04:26,000
To lean in.

88
0:04:27.833,000 --> 0:04:28,000
To sit at the table.

89
0:04:29.792,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Negotiate as often as men.

90
0:04:31.542,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Oh, and get more training.

91
0:04:34.708,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Women currently earn the majority of college degrees,

92
0:04:38.75,000 --> 0:04:41,000
outperform their peers in key leadership skills

93
0:04:41.792,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and are running businesses that outperform the competition.

94
0:04:45.167,000 --> 0:04:46,000
It doesn't look like education

95
0:04:46.958,000 --> 0:04:49,000
or skills or business acumen are the problem.

96
0:04:50.542,000 --> 0:04:52,000
We're already empowered.

97
0:04:52.583,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Enough to make an impact on the businesses that are ready.

98
0:04:56.333,000 --> 0:04:59,000
These approaches fail to address the key systemic problem:

99
0:05:00.333,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Unconscious bias.

100
0:05:03.583,000 --> 0:05:09,000
(Applause)

101
0:05:11.792,000 --> 0:05:14,000
We all have bias, it's OK.

102
0:05:15.042,000 --> 0:05:17,000
It's lodged in our amygdala,

103
0:05:17.083,000 --> 0:05:19,000
it keeps ticking away when we go to work.

104
0:05:19.875,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Bias affects how much I like you,

105
0:05:23.083,000 --> 0:05:25,000
what I believe you're capable of

106
0:05:25.708,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and even how much space I think you take up.

107
0:05:28.75,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Thanks in part to the Me Too movement,

108
0:05:31.417,000 --> 0:05:33,000
awareness of gender bias has spread.

109
0:05:34.75,000 --> 0:05:37,000
But the harassment stories that made headlines

110
0:05:37.875,000 --> 0:05:39,000
are just one piece.

111
0:05:40.333,000 --> 0:05:43,000
You don't have to harass a woman to limit her career.

112
0:05:43.958,000 --> 0:05:46,000
The messages women send me aren't about being harassed.

113
0:05:47.875,000 --> 0:05:51,000
They're being tolerated in the workplace.

114
0:05:52.417,000 --> 0:05:54,000
But they're not being valued.

115
0:05:56.417,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I don't know anyone who has ever said,

116
0:05:59.417,000 --> 0:06:01,000
"You know what I love about my employer?

117
0:06:02.208,000 --> 0:06:04,000
They just tolerate me so well,

118
0:06:04.25,000 --> 0:06:05,000
I feel so tolerated."

119
0:06:05.958,000 --> 0:06:08,000
(Laughter)

120
0:06:09.833,000 --> 0:06:1,000
To break the inertia,

121
0:06:11.625,000 --> 0:06:14,000
we need to take a step beyond Me Too.

122
0:06:14.75,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Beyond just being tolerated as women.

123
0:06:18.125,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Our organization decided to tackle the problem in two ways.

124
0:06:22.333,000 --> 0:06:24,000
First, if we're all biased,

125
0:06:24.458,000 --> 0:06:28,000
our workplaces need to be actively antibiased by design,

126
0:06:29.333,000 --> 0:06:32,000
not by trying to change mindsets one training at a time.

127
0:06:33.25,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So our team began by identifying over 100 cultural levers

128
0:06:37.958,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that can be adjusted to counter the impact of bias.

129
0:06:42.125,000 --> 0:06:45,000
We found that small tweaks can lead to big changes.

130
0:06:45.958,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And they cost a lot less than eight billion dollars.

131
0:06:49.25,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So what do these small tweaks look like?

132
0:06:52,000 --> 0:06:54,000
If a woman is asked to state her gender

133
0:06:54.167,000 --> 0:06:56,000
before filling out a job application,

134
0:06:56.833,000 --> 0:06:58,000
or performing a skills-related test,

135
0:06:59.25,000 --> 0:07:03,000
she performs worse than if she were not asked first.

136
0:07:03.917,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So how can businesses avoid activating this self-stereotyping bias?

137
0:07:09.083,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Move the gender check box to the end of the application.

138
0:07:13.375,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Example two.

139
0:07:15.75,000 --> 0:07:17,000
In a national survey that we conducted,

140
0:07:18.667,000 --> 0:07:21,000
men were 50 percent more likely to state

141
0:07:22.625,000 --> 0:07:26,000
they had received multiple, frequent evaluations

142
0:07:26.75,000 --> 0:07:28,000
over the course of the last year.

143
0:07:28.958,000 --> 0:07:31,000
As opposed to one single yearly review.

144
0:07:32.417,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Here's why this matters.

145
0:07:34.583,000 --> 0:07:38,000
"Fortune" magazine reviewed performance evals across industries.

146
0:07:38.875,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And found that criticism like this related to personality,

147
0:07:43.208,000 --> 0:07:44,000
["Watch your tone!"]

148
0:07:44.5,000 --> 0:07:45,000
but not job-related skills,

149
0:07:46.125,000 --> 0:07:51,000
appeared in 71 of the 94 yearly reviews received by women.

150
0:07:52.417,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Of the 83 reviews received by men,

151
0:07:55.25,000 --> 0:07:58,000
personality criticism showed up twice.

152
0:07:59.708,000 --> 0:08:04,000
But in businesses that conduct much shorter, highly frequent reviews,

153
0:08:05.208,000 --> 0:08:07,000
say, five-minute weekly evaluations

154
0:08:07.667,000 --> 0:08:09,000
focused on specific projects,

155
0:08:09.917,000 --> 0:08:12,000
the personality criticism vanishes.

156
0:08:13.625,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And the perceived performance gap between men and women

157
0:08:16.292,000 --> 0:08:18,000
is nearly nonexistent.

158
0:08:18.667,000 --> 0:08:2,000
While yearly reviews rely on overall impressions,

159
0:08:21.667,000 --> 0:08:24,000
which are like petri dishes for bias,

160
0:08:25.583,000 --> 0:08:27,000
short, objectively focused evaluations

161
0:08:28.5,000 --> 0:08:31,000
eliminate this feelings-based gray area.

162
0:08:32.5,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Now, some businesses are consciously taking these steps

163
0:08:35.958,000 --> 0:08:37,000
to counter the impact of bias,

164
0:08:38.542,000 --> 0:08:42,000
while others just do a good job of advertising.

165
0:08:42.875,000 --> 0:08:46,000
We wanted to find out who is actually getting it right.

166
0:08:46.917,000 --> 0:08:48,000
So we put a poll on Facebook,

167
0:08:49.75,000 --> 0:08:51,000
we asked women in workshops

168
0:08:51.792,000 --> 0:08:55,000
how they were choosing employers where they would be valued.

169
0:08:55.917,000 --> 0:08:57,000
The most common response that we heard?

170
0:08:58.5,000 --> 0:08:59,000
"I Google it."

171
0:09:00.25,000 --> 0:09:02,000
So we googled it.

172
0:09:02.292,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Laughter)

173
0:09:03.667,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Specifically, we googled "best employers for women in tech."

174
0:09:08.292,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Our results showed three completely different lists.

175
0:09:13.042,000 --> 0:09:15,000
One business shows up as the top employer on one list,

176
0:09:15.917,000 --> 0:09:17,000
doesn't show up at all on another,

177
0:09:18.083,000 --> 0:09:2,000
some lists offer no criteria

178
0:09:20.542,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and some are purchased ads.

179
0:09:22.792,000 --> 0:09:23,000
They're paid for.

180
0:09:25.667,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Employees and employers both want clear benchmarks

181
0:09:29.583,000 --> 0:09:31,000
that go beyond good intentions.

182
0:09:33.542,000 --> 0:09:36,000
The LEED certification gave businesses this clarity

183
0:09:37.042,000 --> 0:09:38,000
around environmental stewardship

184
0:09:38.875,000 --> 0:09:42,000
by outlining the exact steps they need to take for certification.

185
0:09:43.667,000 --> 0:09:47,000
We wanted businesses to have this kind of playbook for gender equity.

186
0:09:48.167,000 --> 0:09:5,000
So for our second act,

187
0:09:50.375,000 --> 0:09:53,000
we took what we had learned from testing these cultural levers,

188
0:09:54.083,000 --> 0:09:56,000
we partnered with the University of Washington

189
0:09:56.875,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and created the first standardized certification

190
0:10:00.333,000 --> 0:10:03,000
for gender equity in US businesses.

191
0:10:03.833,000 --> 0:10:08,000
(Applause)

192
0:10:09.375,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Thank you.

193
0:10:10.667,000 --> 0:10:12,000
(Applause)

194
0:10:13.5,000 --> 0:10:14,000
To create this standard,

195
0:10:15.375,000 --> 0:10:18,000
we had to learn what matters and what doesn't.

196
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:2,000
We found out that what matters

197
0:10:20.5,000 --> 0:10:23,000
is not the total percentage of female employees.

198
0:10:24.333,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Or the number of board members that are female.

199
0:10:26.625,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Those are what we call vanity metrics.

200
0:10:29.333,000 --> 0:10:3,000
They can be bought,

201
0:10:31,000 --> 0:10:35,000
while the culture inside can still be out of balance.

202
0:10:35.625,000 --> 0:10:38,000
The factors that matter and that should be measured

203
0:10:38.75,000 --> 0:10:4,000
are under the surface.

204
0:10:41.083,000 --> 0:10:42,000
For example,

205
0:10:42.5,000 --> 0:10:45,000
even in organizations where equal percentages of women and men

206
0:10:45.917,000 --> 0:10:47,000
state that they have had access to a mentor,

207
0:10:48.833,000 --> 0:10:52,000
men's mentors are more likely to be in senior positions.

208
0:10:53.417,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Reviewing our survey results,

209
0:10:55.625,000 --> 0:10:57,000
men were twice as likely to state

210
0:10:58.417,000 --> 0:11:01,000
they had been offered an opportunity to shadow someone in a senior role.

211
0:11:03.708,000 --> 0:11:05,000
We're all used to hearing about the wage gap.

212
0:11:06.667,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Hidden opportunity gaps like these are just as influential.

213
0:11:11.875,000 --> 0:11:13,000
So when assessing a company's culture,

214
0:11:14.25,000 --> 0:11:18,000
we measure these gaps between men's and women's experiences.

215
0:11:18.375,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And the smaller the gap,

216
0:11:20.042,000 --> 0:11:22,000
the more equity is center of the culture.

217
0:11:22.917,000 --> 0:11:24,000
We also searched our findings

218
0:11:24.958,000 --> 0:11:25,000
for the tenets of workplace culture

219
0:11:26.75,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that are most important to men and most important to women.

220
0:11:30.708,000 --> 0:11:33,000
We learned that only three factors consistently matter to men,

221
0:11:34.583,000 --> 0:11:36,000
while a dozen matter to women.

222
0:11:37.125,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And they only share one in common.

223
0:11:39.917,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Topping the list for women:

224
0:11:42.167,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Paid family leave,

225
0:11:44.042,000 --> 0:11:46,000
health care for dependents

226
0:11:46.167,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and feeling that their ideas are heard

227
0:11:48.583,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and they're properly credited for them.

228
0:11:51.792,000 --> 0:11:55,000
These are a few of the 188 indicators

229
0:11:55.833,000 --> 0:11:57,000
that determine whether or not an organization

230
0:11:58.583,000 --> 0:12:02,000
meets our quantitative standard for workplace equality.

231
0:12:02.833,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Based on the data that matter.

232
0:12:05.75,000 --> 0:12:06,000
These are the factors

233
0:12:07.417,000 --> 0:12:1,000
to create a culture of equity that lasts.

234
0:12:11.167,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Not just for a month or for a quarter

235
0:12:13.917,000 --> 0:12:14,000
but for years.

236
0:12:17.208,000 --> 0:12:19,000
So where does this leave us?

237
0:12:21.583,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Women in the workforce today are constantly told,

238
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
"You can be anything you want now.

239
0:12:28.667,000 --> 0:12:29,000
It's up to you."

240
0:12:31.708,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Women of color,

241
0:12:33.417,000 --> 0:12:35,000
for whom the wage gap is even larger,

242
0:12:36.167,000 --> 0:12:37,000
have heard it.

243
0:12:38.417,000 --> 0:12:43,000
The two-thirds of minimum-wage workers who are women have heard it.

244
0:12:44.583,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Workers who don't identify as male or female

245
0:12:47.667,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and hide their identity at work

246
0:12:49.333,000 --> 0:12:5,000
have heard it.

247
0:12:50.625,000 --> 0:12:52,000
If they can hear, "You can be anything you want now,

248
0:12:53.542,000 --> 0:12:54,000
it's up to you,"

249
0:12:55.083,000 --> 0:12:58,000
I believe it's time for our businesses to hear it, too.

250
0:12:59.417,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Eliminating workplace bias is a tall order.

251
0:13:03.792,000 --> 0:13:06,000
But we can't afford to let half our people go on

252
0:13:07.708,000 --> 0:13:08,000
being ignored.

253
0:13:10.333,000 --> 0:13:13,000
We've given businesses a framework for real change.

254
0:13:13.917,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Businesses can be anything they want now.

255
0:13:17.333,000 --> 0:13:19,000
It is up to them.

256
0:13:19.375,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Thank you.

257
0:13:20.667,000 --> 0:13:24,000
(Applause)

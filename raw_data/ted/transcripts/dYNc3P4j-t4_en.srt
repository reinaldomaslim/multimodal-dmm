Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Camille Martínez

2
0:00:12.714,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Let me ask you all a question.

3
0:00:16.282,000 --> 0:00:19,000
How much weapons-grade nuclear material do you think it would take

4
0:00:20.17,000 --> 0:00:22,000
to level a city the size of San Francisco?

5
0:00:23.554,000 --> 0:00:25,000
How many of you think it would be an amount

6
0:00:25.61,000 --> 0:00:27,000
about the size of this suitcase?

7
0:00:29.685,000 --> 0:00:32,000
OK. And how about this minibus?

8
0:00:34.327,000 --> 0:00:35,000
All right.

9
0:00:35.504,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Well actually, under the right circumstances,

10
0:00:38.222,000 --> 0:00:43,000
an amount of highly enriched uranium about the size of your morning latte

11
0:00:43.697,000 --> 0:00:45,000
would be enough to kill 100,000 people

12
0:00:46.639,000 --> 0:00:47,000
instantly.

13
0:00:48.522,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Hundreds of thousands of others would become horribly ill,

14
0:00:52.616,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and parts of the city would be uninhabitable for years,

15
0:00:55.665,000 --> 0:00:56,000
if not for decades.

16
0:00:57.993,000 --> 0:00:59,000
But you can forget that nuclear latte,

17
0:01:00.58,000 --> 0:01:05,000
because today's nuclear weapons are hundreds of times more powerful

18
0:01:06.574,000 --> 0:01:09,000
even than those we dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

19
0:01:10.891,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And even a limited nuclear war involving, say, tens of nuclear weapons,

20
0:01:16.234,000 --> 0:01:2,000
could lead to the end of all life on the planet.

21
0:01:21.609,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So it's really important that you know

22
0:01:24.907,000 --> 0:01:29,000
that right now we have over 15,000 nuclear weapons

23
0:01:30.012,000 --> 0:01:32,000
in the hands of nine nations.

24
0:01:32.251,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And if you live in a city or near a military facility,

25
0:01:36.904,000 --> 0:01:38,000
one is likely pointed right at you.

26
0:01:40.523,000 --> 0:01:42,000
In fact, if you live in any of the rural areas

27
0:01:43.438,000 --> 0:01:45,000
where nuclear weapons are stored globally,

28
0:01:45.944,000 --> 0:01:46,000
one is likely pointed at you.

29
0:01:48.188,000 --> 0:01:52,000
About 1,800 of these weapons are on high alert,

30
0:01:52.694,000 --> 0:01:55,000
which means they can be launched within 15 minutes

31
0:01:56.408,000 --> 0:01:58,000
of a presidential command.

32
0:02:00.228,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So I know this is a bummer of an issue,

33
0:02:03.819,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and maybe you have that -- what was it? -- psychic fatigue

34
0:02:06.656,000 --> 0:02:08,000
that we heard about a little bit earlier.

35
0:02:08.745,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So I'm going to switch gears for just a second,

36
0:02:11.072,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and I'm going to talk about my imaginary friend,

37
0:02:13.482,000 --> 0:02:15,000
who I like to think of as Jasmine,

38
0:02:16.292,000 --> 0:02:17,000
just for a moment.

39
0:02:17.662,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Jasmine, at the age of 25,

40
0:02:20.203,000 --> 0:02:24,000
is part of a generation that is more politically and socially engaged

41
0:02:24.582,000 --> 0:02:26,000
than anything we've seen in 50 years.

42
0:02:27.011,000 --> 0:02:28,000
She and her friends think of themselves

43
0:02:28.974,000 --> 0:02:31,000
as change agents and leaders and activists.

44
0:02:32.247,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I think of them as Generation Possible.

45
0:02:36.317,000 --> 0:02:39,000
They regularly protest about the issues they care about,

46
0:02:39.422,000 --> 0:02:42,000
but nuclear weapons are not one of them, which makes sense,

47
0:02:42.854,000 --> 0:02:46,000
because Jasmine was born in 1991, at the end of the Cold War.

48
0:02:47.076,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So she didn't grow up hearing a lot about nuclear weapons.

49
0:02:50.206,000 --> 0:02:53,000
She never had to duck and cover under her desk at school.

50
0:02:53.813,000 --> 0:02:57,000
For Jasmine, a fallout shelter is an app in the Android store.

51
0:02:58.128,000 --> 0:03:,000
Nuclear weapons help win games.

52
0:03:00.847,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And that is really a shame,

53
0:03:03.305,000 --> 0:03:06,000
because right now, we need Generation Possible

54
0:03:06.603,000 --> 0:03:1,000
to help us make some really important decisions about nuclear weapons.

55
0:03:11.545,000 --> 0:03:17,000
For instance, will we further reduce our nuclear arsenals globally,

56
0:03:18.005,000 --> 0:03:2,000
or will we spend billions,

57
0:03:20.945,000 --> 0:03:22,000
maybe a trillion dollars,

58
0:03:23.192,000 --> 0:03:26,000
to modernize them so they last throughout the 21st century,

59
0:03:26.538,000 --> 0:03:29,000
so that by the time Jasmine is my age, she's talking to her children

60
0:03:29.861,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and maybe even her grandchildren

61
0:03:31.816,000 --> 0:03:33,000
about the threat of nuclear holocaust?

62
0:03:35.098,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And if you're paying any attention at all to cyberthreats,

63
0:03:38.028,000 --> 0:03:41,000
or, for instance, if you've read about the Stuxnet virus

64
0:03:42.019,000 --> 0:03:45,000
or, for God's sake, if you've ever had an email account or a Yahoo account

65
0:03:45.908,000 --> 0:03:47,000
or a phone hacked,

66
0:03:47.98,000 --> 0:03:51,000
you can imagine the whole new world of hurt that could be triggered

67
0:03:52.156,000 --> 0:03:55,000
by modernization in a period of cyberwarfare.

68
0:03:55.944,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Now, if you're paying attention to the money,

69
0:03:58.185,000 --> 0:04:01,000
a trillion dollars could go a long way

70
0:04:01.27,000 --> 0:04:03,000
to feeding and educating and employing people,

71
0:04:04.137,000 --> 0:04:07,000
all of which could reduce the threat of nuclear war to begin with.

72
0:04:08.691,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So --

73
0:04:09.869,000 --> 0:04:12,000
(Applause)

74
0:04:12.915,000 --> 0:04:14,000
This is really crucial right now,

75
0:04:15.392,000 --> 0:04:17,000
because nuclear weapons -- they're vulnerable.

76
0:04:19.274,000 --> 0:04:2,000
We have solid evidence

77
0:04:20.885,000 --> 0:04:22,000
that terrorists are trying to get ahold of them.

78
0:04:24.551,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Just this last spring,

79
0:04:25.896,000 --> 0:04:29,000
when four retirees and two taxi drivers were arrested

80
0:04:30.626,000 --> 0:04:31,000
in the Republic of Georgia

81
0:04:32.249,000 --> 0:04:35,000
for trying to sell nuclear materials for 200 million dollars,

82
0:04:35.998,000 --> 0:04:38,000
they demonstrated that the black market for this stuff is alive and well.

83
0:04:40.111,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And it's really important,

84
0:04:41.396,000 --> 0:04:44,000
because there have been dozens of accidents

85
0:04:45.217,000 --> 0:04:46,000
involving nuclear weapons,

86
0:04:46.522,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and I bet most of us have never heard anything about them.

87
0:04:49.587,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Just here in the United States,

88
0:04:51.153,000 --> 0:04:54,000
we've dropped nuclear weapons on the Carolinas twice.

89
0:04:55.203,000 --> 0:04:57,000
In one case, one of the bombs,

90
0:04:57.553,000 --> 0:04:59,000
which fell out of an Air Force plane,

91
0:04:59.749,000 --> 0:05:,000
didn't detonate

92
0:05:00.972,000 --> 0:05:03,000
because the nuclear core was stored somewhere else on the plane.

93
0:05:04.109,000 --> 0:05:08,000
In another case, the weapon did arm when it hit the ground,

94
0:05:08.169,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and five of the switches designed to keep it from detonating failed.

95
0:05:12.935,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Luckily, the sixth one didn't.

96
0:05:15.521,000 --> 0:05:17,000
But if that's not enough to get your attention,

97
0:05:18.973,000 --> 0:05:21,000
there was the 1995 Black Brant incident.

98
0:05:22.655,000 --> 0:05:24,000
That's when Russian radar technicians saw

99
0:05:24.958,000 --> 0:05:26,000
what they thought was a US nuclear missile

100
0:05:27.501,000 --> 0:05:29,000
streaking towards Russian airspace.

101
0:05:30.172,000 --> 0:05:32,000
It later turned out to be a Norwegian rocket

102
0:05:32.916,000 --> 0:05:34,000
collecting data about the northern lights.

103
0:05:35.522,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But at that time,

104
0:05:36.7,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Russian President Boris Yeltsin came within five minutes

105
0:05:40.495,000 --> 0:05:44,000
of launching a full-scale retaliatory nuclear attack

106
0:05:44.671,000 --> 0:05:45,000
against the United States.

107
0:05:48.924,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So, most of the world's nuclear nations

108
0:05:52.99,000 --> 0:05:55,000
have committed to getting rid of these weapons of mass destruction.

109
0:05:57.352,000 --> 0:05:58,000
But consider this:

110
0:05:59.835,000 --> 0:06:02,000
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,

111
0:06:03.183,000 --> 0:06:06,000
which is the most widely adopted arms control treaty in history

112
0:06:06.644,000 --> 0:06:08,000
with 190 signatories,

113
0:06:09.398,000 --> 0:06:14,000
sets no specific date by which the world's nuclear-armed nations

114
0:06:14.716,000 --> 0:06:16,000
will get rid of their nuclear weapons.

115
0:06:17.692,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Now, when John F. Kennedy sent a man to the moon

116
0:06:20.486,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and decided to bring him back, or decided to do both those things,

117
0:06:23.681,000 --> 0:06:25,000
he didn't say, "Hey, whenever you guys get to it."

118
0:06:26.625,000 --> 0:06:28,000
He gave us a deadline.

119
0:06:28.656,000 --> 0:06:29,000
He gave us a challenge

120
0:06:30.502,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that would have been incredible just a few years earlier.

121
0:06:34.033,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And with that challenge,

122
0:06:35.559,000 --> 0:06:37,000
he inspired scientists and marketers,

123
0:06:38.458,000 --> 0:06:4,000
astronauts and schoolteachers.

124
0:06:41.152,000 --> 0:06:43,000
He gave us a vision.

125
0:06:43.928,000 --> 0:06:44,000
But along with that vision,

126
0:06:45.927,000 --> 0:06:48,000
he also tried to give us -- and most people don't know this, either --

127
0:06:49.495,000 --> 0:06:5,000
he tried to give us a partner

128
0:06:51.503,000 --> 0:06:56,000
in the form of our fiercest Cold War rival, the Soviet Union.

129
0:06:56.948,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Because part of Kennedy's vision for the Apollo program

130
0:07:00.006,000 --> 0:07:03,000
was that it be a cooperation, not a competition, with the Soviets.

131
0:07:03.817,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And apparently, Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet Premier, agreed.

132
0:07:08.007,000 --> 0:07:11,000
But before that cooperation could be realized,

133
0:07:11.347,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Kennedy was assassinated,

134
0:07:13.042,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and that part of the vision was deferred.

135
0:07:16.581,000 --> 0:07:21,000
But the promise of joint innovation between these two nuclear superpowers

136
0:07:21.784,000 --> 0:07:22,000
wasn't totally extinguished.

137
0:07:24.305,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Because in 1991, which is the year that Jasmine was born

138
0:07:28.222,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and the Soviet Union fell,

139
0:07:30.732,000 --> 0:07:32,000
these two nations engaged in a project

140
0:07:33.529,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that genuinely does seem incredible today

141
0:07:36.11,000 --> 0:07:38,000
in the truest sense of that word,

142
0:07:38.812,000 --> 0:07:42,000
which is that the US sent cash to the Russians when they needed it most,

143
0:07:43.432,000 --> 0:07:45,000
to secure loose nuclear materials

144
0:07:46.211,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and to employ out-of-work nuclear scientists.

145
0:07:49.44,000 --> 0:07:55,000
They worked alongside American scientists to convert weapons-grade uranium

146
0:07:56.167,000 --> 0:07:59,000
into the type of fuel that can be used for nuclear power instead.

147
0:08:00.464,000 --> 0:08:03,000
They called it, "Megatons to Megawatts."

148
0:08:04.202,000 --> 0:08:07,000
So the result is that for over 20 years,

149
0:08:07.362,000 --> 0:08:09,000
our two nations had a program

150
0:08:10.193,000 --> 0:08:13,000
that meant that one in 10 lightbulbs in the United States

151
0:08:14.03,000 --> 0:08:18,000
was essentially fueled by former Russian warheads.

152
0:08:19.53,000 --> 0:08:22,000
So, together these two nations did something truly audacious.

153
0:08:23.905,000 --> 0:08:27,000
But the good news is, the global community has the chance

154
0:08:27.998,000 --> 0:08:3,000
to do something just as audacious today.

155
0:08:32.897,000 --> 0:08:34,000
To get rid of nuclear weapons

156
0:08:35.448,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and to end the supply of the materials required to produce them,

157
0:08:40.01,000 --> 0:08:42,000
some experts tell me would take 30 years.

158
0:08:43.219,000 --> 0:08:45,000
It would take a renaissance of sorts,

159
0:08:45.71,000 --> 0:08:47,000
the kinds of innovation that, for better or worse,

160
0:08:48.149,000 --> 0:08:51,000
underpinned both the Manhattan Project, which gave rise to nuclear weapons,

161
0:08:52.147,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and the Megatons to Megawatts program.

162
0:08:55.019,000 --> 0:08:57,000
It would take design constraints.

163
0:08:57.665,000 --> 0:08:59,000
These are fundamental to creativity,

164
0:09:00.407,000 --> 0:09:04,000
things like a platform for international collaboration;

165
0:09:04.447,000 --> 0:09:07,000
a date certain, which is a forcing mechanism;

166
0:09:08.925,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and a positive vision that inspires action.

167
0:09:12.735,000 --> 0:09:14,000
It would take us to 2045.

168
0:09:16.468,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Now, 2045 happens to be the 100th anniversary

169
0:09:20.973,000 --> 0:09:23,000
of the birth of nuclear weapons in the New Mexico desert.

170
0:09:25.247,000 --> 0:09:27,000
But it's also an important date for another reason.

171
0:09:28.458,000 --> 0:09:31,000
It's predicted to be the advent of the singularity,

172
0:09:33.011,000 --> 0:09:35,000
a new moment in human development,

173
0:09:35.431,000 --> 0:09:4,000
where the lines between artificial intelligence and human intelligence blur,

174
0:09:41.106,000 --> 0:09:45,000
where computing and consciousness become almost indistinguishable

175
0:09:45.559,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and advanced technologies help us solve the 21st century's greatest problems:

176
0:09:51.215,000 --> 0:09:53,000
hunger, energy, poverty,

177
0:09:54.133,000 --> 0:09:57,000
ushering in an era of abundance.

178
0:09:58.318,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And we all get to go to space

179
0:09:59.924,000 --> 0:10:01,000
on our way to becoming a multi-planetary species.

180
0:10:04.039,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Now, the people who really believe this vision are the first to say

181
0:10:07.915,000 --> 0:10:1,000
they don't yet know precisely how we're going to get there.

182
0:10:11.618,000 --> 0:10:13,000
But the values behind their vision

183
0:10:14.434,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and the willingness to ask "How might we?"

184
0:10:17.789,000 --> 0:10:19,000
have inspired a generation of innovators.

185
0:10:20.884,000 --> 0:10:23,000
They're working backward from the outcomes they want,

186
0:10:24.38,000 --> 0:10:28,000
using the creative problem-solving methods of collaborative design.

187
0:10:28.608,000 --> 0:10:3,000
They're busting through obstacles.

188
0:10:30.872,000 --> 0:10:33,000
They're redefining what we all consider possible.

189
0:10:35.513,000 --> 0:10:36,000
But here's the thing:

190
0:10:37.706,000 --> 0:10:41,000
that vision of abundance isn't compatible

191
0:10:41.94,000 --> 0:10:47,000
with a world that still relies on a 20th-century nuclear doctrine

192
0:10:48.169,000 --> 0:10:51,000
called "mutually assured destruction."

193
0:10:52.945,000 --> 0:10:57,000
It has to be about building the foundations for the 22nd century.

194
0:10:58.446,000 --> 0:11:03,000
It has to be about strategies for mutually assured prosperity

195
0:11:04.276,000 --> 0:11:07,000
or, at the very least, mutually assured survival.

196
0:11:09.175,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Now, every day, I get to meet people who are real pioneers

197
0:11:14.422,000 --> 0:11:15,000
in the field of nuclear threats.

198
0:11:16.363,000 --> 0:11:19,000
As you can see, many of them are young women,

199
0:11:19.888,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and they're doing fiercely interesting stuff,

200
0:11:22.488,000 --> 0:11:26,000
like Mareena Robinson Snowden here, who is developing new ways,

201
0:11:27.015,000 --> 0:11:29,000
better ways, to detect nuclear warheads,

202
0:11:29.701,000 --> 0:11:31,000
which will help us overcome a critical hurdle

203
0:11:31.948,000 --> 0:11:32,000
to international disarmament.

204
0:11:33.906,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Or Melissa Hanham, who is using satellite imaging

205
0:11:36.799,000 --> 0:11:4,000
to make sense of what's going on around far-flung nuclear sites.

206
0:11:41.358,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Or we have Beatrice Fihn in Europe,

207
0:11:44.079,000 --> 0:11:48,000
who has been campaigning to make nuclear weapons illegal

208
0:11:48.376,000 --> 0:11:49,000
in international courts of law,

209
0:11:50.084,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and just won a big victory at the UN last week.

210
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:56,000
(Applause)

211
0:11:56.202,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And yet,

212
0:11:57.942,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and yet,

213
0:11:59.797,000 --> 0:12:02,000
with all of our talk in this culture about moon shots,

214
0:12:03.239,000 --> 0:12:07,000
too few members of Generation Possible and those of us who mentor them

215
0:12:07.991,000 --> 0:12:08,000
are taking on nuclear weapons.

216
0:12:10.524,000 --> 0:12:11,000
It's as if there's a taboo.

217
0:12:13.898,000 --> 0:12:17,000
But I remember something Kennedy said that has really stuck with me,

218
0:12:18.597,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and that is something to the effect

219
0:12:20.379,000 --> 0:12:22,000
that humans can be as big as the solutions

220
0:12:22.545,000 --> 0:12:23,000
to all the problems we've created.

221
0:12:24.427,000 --> 0:12:27,000
No problem of human destiny, he said,

222
0:12:27.685,000 --> 0:12:29,000
is beyond human beings.

223
0:12:31.296,000 --> 0:12:32,000
I believe that.

224
0:12:33.376,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And I bet a lot of you here believe that, too.

225
0:12:36.535,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And I know Generation Possible believes it.

226
0:12:40.646,000 --> 0:12:43,000
So it's time to commit to a date.

227
0:12:45.183,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Let's end the nuclear weapons chapter

228
0:12:48.735,000 --> 0:12:51,000
on the 100th anniversary of its inception.

229
0:12:53.119,000 --> 0:12:57,000
After all, by 2045, we will have held billions of people hostage

230
0:12:57.869,000 --> 0:12:59,000
to the threat of nuclear annihilation.

231
0:13:00.167,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Surely, 100 years will have been enough.

232
0:13:03.512,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Surely, a century of economic development

233
0:13:07.215,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and the development of military strategy

234
0:13:10.634,000 --> 0:13:13,000
will have given us better ways to manage global conflict.

235
0:13:14.802,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Surely, if ever there was a global moon shot worth supporting,

236
0:13:19.759,000 --> 0:13:2,000
this is it.

237
0:13:21.846,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Now, in the face of real threats --

238
0:13:24.484,000 --> 0:13:26,000
for instance, North Korea's recent nuclear weapons tests,

239
0:13:27.504,000 --> 0:13:29,000
which fly in the face of sanctions --

240
0:13:29.808,000 --> 0:13:31,000
reasonable people disagree

241
0:13:32.132,000 --> 0:13:35,000
about whether we should maintain some number of nuclear weapons

242
0:13:36.055,000 --> 0:13:37,000
to deter aggression.

243
0:13:38.55,000 --> 0:13:4,000
But the question is: What's the magic number?

244
0:13:42.205,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Is it a thousand?

245
0:13:44.14,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Is it a hundred? Ten?

246
0:13:47.246,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And then we have to ask:

247
0:13:49.395,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Who should be responsible for them?

248
0:13:52.038,000 --> 0:13:53,000
I think we can agree, however,

249
0:13:53.92,000 --> 0:13:57,000
that having 15,000 of them represents a greater global threat

250
0:13:57.993,000 --> 0:13:59,000
to Jasmine's generation than a promise.

251
0:14:01.184,000 --> 0:14:04,000
So it's time we make a promise

252
0:14:04.366,000 --> 0:14:06,000
of a world in which we've broken the stranglehold

253
0:14:07.103,000 --> 0:14:1,000
that nuclear weapons have on our imaginations;

254
0:14:10.625,000 --> 0:14:12,000
in which we invest in the creative solutions

255
0:14:13.261,000 --> 0:14:16,000
that come from working backward from the future we desperately want,

256
0:14:17.015,000 --> 0:14:19,000
rather than plodding forward from a present

257
0:14:19.573,000 --> 0:14:23,000
that brings all of the mental models and biases of the past with it.

258
0:14:24.392,000 --> 0:14:29,000
It's time we pledge our resources as leaders across the spectrum

259
0:14:29.718,000 --> 0:14:31,000
to work on this old problem in new ways,

260
0:14:33.146,000 --> 0:14:35,000
to ask, "How might we?"

261
0:14:36.001,000 --> 0:14:38,000
How might we make good on a promise

262
0:14:38.328,000 --> 0:14:41,000
of greater security for Jasmine's generation

263
0:14:41.929,000 --> 0:14:43,000
in a world beyond nuclear weapons?

264
0:14:46.116,000 --> 0:14:48,000
I truly hope you will join us.

265
0:14:49.782,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Thank you.

266
0:14:50.969,000 --> 0:14:53,000
(Applause)

267
0:14:54.295,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Thank you.

268
0:14:55.992,000 --> 0:14:57,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
You know, one of the things that I'd like to say upfront is that

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I'm really here by accident.

3
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And what I mean -- not at TED -- that I'm --

4
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
at this point in my life, truly my set of circumstances

5
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I would truly consider an accident.

6
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
But what I'd like to talk to you about today

7
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
is perhaps a way in which we could use technology

8
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
to make those accidents happen often.

9
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Because I really think, when I look back at how I actually ended up

10
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
in this accident, technology played a big role in that.

11
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So, what I'd like to do today is tell you a little bit about myself,

12
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
because I'd like to put in context what I'm going to tell you.

13
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And I think you will see why the two greatest passions in my life today

14
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
are children and education.

15
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And once I put that in context,

16
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I'd like to tell you a little bit about technology:

17
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
why I believe technology is a tremendous enabler;

18
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
a very powerful tool to help address some of these challenges.

19
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Then, about the initiative that Chris mentioned,

20
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
that we decided to launch at AMD that we call 50x15.

21
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And then I'll come back to the beginning,

22
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and tell you a little bit more -- hopefully convince you --

23
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that I believe that in today's world,

24
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
it is really important for business leaders

25
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
not only to have an idea of what their business is all about,

26
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
but to have a passion for something that is meaningful.

27
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So, with that in mind, first of all let me tell you,

28
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I'm one of five children. I'm the oldest, the other four are women.

29
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So I grew up in a family of women.

30
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I learned a lot about how to deal with that part of the world.

31
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
(Laughter)

32
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And, as you can imagine, if you can picture this:

33
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I was born in a very small village in Mexico,

34
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
in, unfortunately, very poor surroundings,

35
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and my parents did not have a college education.

36
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
But I was fortunate to be able to have one, and so were my four sisters.

37
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
That kind of tells you a little bit of an idea of the emphasis

38
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that my parents placed on education.

39
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
My parents were fanatics about learning,

40
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and I'll come back to that a little bit later.

41
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
But one of the things that exposed me early to learning,

42
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and a tremendous curiosity that was instilled in me as a child,

43
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
was through a technology which is on the screen -- is a Victrola.

44
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
My father found that in a junkyard,

45
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and was able to repair it and make it work. And somehow --

46
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
to this day, I frankly don't know how he was so aware

47
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
of what was going on in the world -- but,

48
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
by inviting me to sit down with him when I was only a few years old,

49
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and playing records in this Victrola by Mozart, and he would tell me

50
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
how Mozart was the most romantic of all the classic composers ever,

51
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and how Claire de Lune, which was one of his favorites,

52
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
was a real exposure to me to classical music.

53
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
He explained to me about Johann Strauss, and how he created the waltzes

54
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that became so famous in the world.

55
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And would tell me a little bit about history too,

56
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
when he'd play the 1812 Overture by Tchaikovsky

57
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
on this little Victrola, and he would tell me about Russia

58
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and all the things that were happening in Russia at those times

59
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and why this music,

60
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
in some way, represented a little bit of that history.

61
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And even as a child, he was able to instill in me a lot of curiosity.

62
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And perhaps to you this product may not look like high tech,

63
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
but if you can imagine the time when this occurred --

64
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
it was in the mid '40s -- this was really, in his view, a pretty piece of high tech.

65
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Well, one of the things that is really critical to try to

66
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
distill from that experience is that in addition to that,

67
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
people ask me and say, "Well,

68
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
how did your parents treat you when you were a child?"

69
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And I always said that they were really tough on me.

70
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And not tough in the sense that most people think of,

71
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
where your parents yell at you or hit you or whatever.

72
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
They were tough in the sense that, as I grew up,

73
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
both my mother and father would always say to me,

74
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
it's really important that you always remember two things.

75
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
First of all, when you go to bed at night,

76
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
you've got to look back on the day and make sure that you felt

77
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
the day was a day which you contributed something, and

78
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that you did everything you could to do it the best way you could.

79
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And the second thing they said: and we trust you,

80
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that no matter where you are or where you go,

81
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
you will always do the right thing.

82
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Now, I don't know how many of you have ever done that with your kids,

83
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
but if you do, please trust me,

84
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
it's the most pressure you can put on a child, to say --

85
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
(Laughter)

86
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
-- we trust you that you will always do the right thing.

87
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
When I was out with my friends drinking beer,

88
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
I always was very aware of those words --

89
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
(Laughter)

90
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
-- and very careful. One of the things that has happened with technology

91
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
is that it can only be helpful if it is useful, of course,

92
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
but it can only be helpful too if it's accessible,

93
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and it can only be helpful if it's affordable.

94
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And in today's world, being useful, affordable and accessible

95
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
is not necessarily what happens

96
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
in a lot of the technology that is done today.

97
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So, one of our passions in our company,

98
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and now one of my personal passions, is to be able to really work hard

99
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
at making the technology useful, accessible and affordable.

100
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And to me, that is very, very critical.

101
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Now, technology has changed a lot since the Victrola days.

102
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
You know, we now have, of course, incredibly powerful computers.

103
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
A tremendous thing that people refer to as a killer app is called the Internet.

104
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Although frankly speaking, we don't believe the Internet is the killer app.

105
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
What we believe is that the Internet, frankly,

106
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
is a connection of people and ideas.

107
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
The Internet happens to be just the medium

108
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
in which those people and ideas get connected.

109
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And the power of connecting people and ideas can be pretty awesome.

110
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And so, we believe that through all the changes that have occurred,

111
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
that we're faced today with a tremendous opportunity.

112
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
If we can connect people and ideas more intensely -- and although

113
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
you've seen a plethora and a myriad of products

114
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that have come to the market today, the key to me is

115
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
how many of these products are able to provide people connectivity, in a useful way,

116
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
accessibility, in an easy manner,

117
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and also affordability, that

118
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
regardless of the economic status that a person could have,

119
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
that they could have the opportunity to afford this technology.

120
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:05,000
So, when you look at that, we said, well, we would like to, then,

121
0:07:05.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
enable that a little bit. We would like to create an initiative.

122
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And a couple of years ago at AMD,

123
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
we came up with this idea of saying,

124
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
what if we create this initiative we call 50x15,

125
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
where we are going to aim, that by the year 2015,

126
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
half of the world will be connected to the Internet

127
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
so that people and ideas can get connected.

128
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
We knew we couldn't do it by ourselves, and by no means

129
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
did we ever intend to imply that we at AMD could do it alone.

130
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
We always felt that this was something that could be done

131
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
through partnerships with governments, industry,

132
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
educational institutions, a myriad of other companies and, frankly, even competitors.

133
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
So, it is really a rather lofty initiative,

134
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
if you want to think that way,

135
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
but we felt that we had to put a real stake up in the years ahead,

136
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
that was bold enough and courageous enough

137
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
that it would force us all to think of ways to do things differently.

138
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
And I'll come back to that in a minute, because I think

139
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
the results so far have been remarkable,

140
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and I can only anticipate and get real excited about

141
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
what I think is going to happen in the next eight years,

142
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
while we get to the 2015 initiative.

143
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Where are we today?

144
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
That's year by year. This comes from our friends at Gapminder.com.

145
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Those of you who've never looked at their website,

146
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
you should look at it. It's really impressive. And you can see

147
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
how the Internet penetration has changed over the years.

148
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And so when we gave ourselves this scorecard to say

149
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
well, where are we related to our goal towards 2015,

150
0:08:36.33,000 --> 0:08:39,000
the thing that becomes apparent is three pieces.

151
0:08:39.33,000 --> 0:08:41,000
One is the Western world,

152
0:08:41.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
defined mostly by Western Europe and the United States,

153
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
has made an awful lot of progress.

154
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
The connectivity in these parts of the world

155
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
are really truly phenomenal and continue to increase.

156
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
As a matter of fact, we think reaching 100 percent is very doable,

157
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
even before the 2015 timeframe. In other parts of emerging countries,

158
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
such as India and China, the progress has been good --

159
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
has been solid, has been good. But in places that are not as developed,

160
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
places like Africa, Latin America and other places in the world,

161
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
the progress has been rather slow. As a matter of fact,

162
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I was just recently visiting South Africa.

163
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I had the opportunity to have a discussion with President Mbeki,

164
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and one of the things that we talked about is, what is it

165
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
that's keeping this connectivity goal from moving ahead faster?

166
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And one of the reasons is, in South Africa,

167
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
it costs 100 dollars a month to have a broadband connectivity.

168
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
It is impossible, even in the United States, for that cost,

169
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
to be able to enable the connectivity that we're all trying to reach.

170
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So, we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner

171
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
to be able to bring the cost of this technology down.

172
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So, when you look at this chart,

173
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
you look at the very last -- it's a logarithmic chart on a horizontal scale --

174
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
you look at the very end:

175
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
we've got quite a long way to go to get to the 2015 goal of 50 percent.

176
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
But we're excited in our company; we're motivated.

177
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
We really think it's a phenomenal driver of things,

178
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
to force us to do things differently, and we look forward to being able to actually,

179
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
working with so many partners around the world,

180
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
to be able to reach that goal.

181
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Now, one of the things I'd like to explain [about] 50x15,

182
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
which I think is really critical, is that it is not a charity.

183
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
It is actually a business venture.

184
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Let's take a small segment of this, of this unconnected world,

185
0:10:35.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and call it the education market.

186
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
When you look at elementary-school children,

187
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
we have hundreds and hundreds of millions of children around the world

188
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:44,000
that could benefit tremendously

189
0:10:44.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
from being able to be connected to the Internet.

190
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Therefore, when we see that, we see an opportunity

191
0:10:50.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
to have a business that addresses the need of that segment.

192
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And when we embarked in this initiative, from the very beginning

193
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
we said it very clearly: this is not a charity.

194
0:11:01.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
This is really a business venture,

195
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
one that addresses a very challenging segment of the market.

196
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Because what we have learned in the last three years

197
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
is that this segment of the market, whether it's education

198
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
or under-developed nations, either way, it's a segment that demands

199
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
incredibly high quality, incredibly high reliability,

200
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
tremendous low cost and access, and a lot of challenges

201
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
that frankly, without actually doing it,

202
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
it would be very difficult to understand, and

203
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:32,000
I'll explain that in just a minute.

204
0:11:32.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
It is an initiative that is focused on simple, accessible and human-centric solutions.

205
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
What we mean by that is,

206
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:42,000
you know, frankly, the PC was invented in 1980, roughly speaking

207
0:11:42.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
more or less, and for 20-odd years, it hasn't changed.

208
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
It is still, in most places, a gray or black box, and it looks the same.

209
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And frankly -- and I know that sometimes I offend some of my customers

210
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
when I say this, but I truly mean it --

211
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
if you could take the name of the computer off the top of it,

212
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
it would be very difficult to judge who made it,

213
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
because they're all highly commoditized but they're all different.

214
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
So, there has not been a human-centric approach

215
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
to addressing this segment of the market,

216
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
so we really believe it is critical to think of it.

217
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
It reminded me a lot of the talk we heard this morning, about this

218
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
operating room machinery that was designed specifically for Africa.

219
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
We're talking about something very similar here.

220
0:12:27.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And it has to be based on a geo-sensitive approach.

221
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:32,000
What I mean by that is that in some parts of the world,

222
0:12:32.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
the government plays a key role in the development of technology.

223
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
In other parts, it doesn't.

224
0:12:36.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
In other parts of the world, you have an infrastructure

225
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:42,000
that allows for manufacturing to take place.

226
0:12:42.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
In other parts, it doesn't. And then we have to be sensitive

227
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
about how this technology can be developed

228
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and put into action in those regions.

229
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And the last piece, which is really important --

230
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and this is an opinion that we have, not shared by many,

231
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:13:,000
this is one where we seem to stand alone, on this one --

232
0:13:00.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
is that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative

233
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:08,000
can come by fostering local, integrated, end-to-end ecosystems.

234
0:13:08.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
What I mean by that, and let me use this example,

235
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
the country of South Africa, because I was just there,

236
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
therefore I'm a little bit familiar with some of the challenges they have.

237
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
It's a country of 45 million people. It's an economy that's emerging.

238
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
It's beginning to grow tremendously.

239
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
They have an objective to lowering the cost of connectivity.

240
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
They have a computer company that makes computers in South Africa.

241
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
They're developing a software-training environment in their universities.

242
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
What a place, what an ideal place

243
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
to create an ecosystem that could build the hardware and the software

244
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:42,000
needed for their schools. And to my surprise, I learned in South Africa

245
0:13:42.33,000 --> 0:13:45,000
they have 18 dialects, I always thought they only had two --

246
0:13:45.33,000 --> 0:13:49,000
English and Afrikaans -- but it turns out they have 18 dialects.

247
0:13:49.33,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And to be able to meet the needs of this rather complex educational system,

248
0:13:55.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
it could only be done from inside.

249
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
I don't think this segment of the market can be addressed

250
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
by companies parachuting from another place of the world,

251
0:14:06.33,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and just dumping product and selling into the markets.

252
0:14:08.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
So, we believe that in those regions of the world

253
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
where the population is large,

254
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and there's an infrastructure that can provide it,

255
0:14:15.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
that a local, integrated, end-to-end system

256
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:2,000
is really critical for its success.

257
0:14:20.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
This is a picture of a classroom that we outfitted with computers

258
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
in Mexico, in my home country.

259
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
This particular classroom happens to be in the state of Michoacan.

260
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Those of you that might be familiar with Mexico --

261
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Michoacan is a very colorful state.

262
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Children dress with very colorful, colorful clothes,

263
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and it is incredible to see the power that this has in the hands of kids,

264
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:49,000
in a computer. And I have to tell you that it's

265
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:52,000
so easy to appreciate the impact that access to technology

266
0:14:52.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and connectivity can have in the lives and education of these kids.

267
0:14:58.33,000 --> 0:15:01,000
We just recently opened a learning laboratory in a school

268
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:05,000
in the West Cape in South Africa,

269
0:15:05.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
in a school that's called Nelson Mandela School,

270
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
and when you see the faces and activities of these children

271
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:16,000
being able to access computers, it's just phenomenal.

272
0:15:16.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And recently, they've written us letters,

273
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
telling us how excited they are about the impact

274
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:26,000
that this has had on their lives, on their educational dreams,

275
0:15:26.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
on their capabilities, and it's just phenomenal.

276
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:32,000
We have now deployed 30 different technologists

277
0:15:32.33,000 --> 0:15:33,000
in 18 different countries, and we have been able

278
0:15:33.33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
to connect millions of people in an effort to continue to learn

279
0:15:37.33,000 --> 0:15:4,000
what this particular segment of the market needs and demands.

280
0:15:40.33,000 --> 0:15:42,000
And I have to tell you that although

281
0:15:42.33,000 --> 0:15:43,000
millions doesn't sound like a lot

282
0:15:43.33,000 --> 0:15:46,000
in terms of the billions that need to be connected,

283
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:49,000
it's a start. And we are learning a lot.

284
0:15:49.33,000 --> 0:15:51,000
And we're learning a tremendous amount about

285
0:15:51.33,000 --> 0:15:54,000
what we believe this segment needs to be able to be effective.

286
0:15:54.33,000 --> 0:15:57,000
One example of this has been the One Laptop per Child.

287
0:15:57.33,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Some of you are familiar with this.

288
0:15:58.33,000 --> 0:16:02,000
This is a partnership between MIT and a group of companies --

289
0:16:02.33,000 --> 0:16:05,000
Google is involved, Red Hat -- and AMD is a key player.

290
0:16:05.33,000 --> 0:16:08,000
The electronics behind the One Laptop per Child

291
0:16:08.33,000 --> 0:16:11,000
are based on AMD technology; it's a microprocessor.

292
0:16:11.33,000 --> 0:16:15,000
But to give you an idea how creative this group of people can be,

293
0:16:15.33,000 --> 0:16:17,000
one of the objectives of the One Laptop per Child

294
0:16:17.33,000 --> 0:16:19,000
is to be able to achieve a 10-hour battery life.

295
0:16:19.33,000 --> 0:16:21,000
Because it was felt that a school day

296
0:16:21.33,000 --> 0:16:24,000
would last at least eight hours, and

297
0:16:24.33,000 --> 0:16:27,000
you wanted the child to have the ability to use the laptop

298
0:16:27.33,000 --> 0:16:31,000
for at least one full day without having to recharge it.

299
0:16:31.33,000 --> 0:16:33,000
The engineers have done a phenomenal amount of innovation on this part,

300
0:16:33.33,000 --> 0:16:37,000
and battery life on this product is now 15 hours --

301
0:16:37.33,000 --> 0:16:39,000
just through a lot of innovative work people have done

302
0:16:39.33,000 --> 0:16:43,000
because they're passionate and motivated to be able to do this.

303
0:16:43.33,000 --> 0:16:45,000
We expect this to be deployed towards the end of this year,

304
0:16:45.33,000 --> 0:16:48,000
and we're very excited at the opportunities that this is going to offer

305
0:16:48.33,000 --> 0:16:5,000
in the field of education.

306
0:16:50.33,000 --> 0:16:56,000
It's a highly focused product aimed at strictly the education market,

307
0:16:56.33,000 --> 0:16:59,000
not only in the developing countries, but actually

308
0:16:59.33,000 --> 0:17:02,000
in the developed regions as well, because

309
0:17:02.33,000 --> 0:17:04,000
there are parts of the United States where this can have

310
0:17:04.33,000 --> 0:17:09,000
also a huge impact on the ability to make education more fun and more efficient.

311
0:17:09.33,000 --> 0:17:11,000
We also have partnered with TED

312
0:17:11.33,000 --> 0:17:13,000
in this project, with Architecture for Humanity,

313
0:17:13.33,000 --> 0:17:16,000
and along with the TED Prize winner Cameron Sinclair,

314
0:17:16.33,000 --> 0:17:2,000
we're having a contest that we have issued to the architectural community

315
0:17:20.33,000 --> 0:17:25,000
to come up with the best design for a computer lab for an emerging region.

316
0:17:25.33,000 --> 0:17:29,000
And we're really thrilled about the opportunity to be part of this,

317
0:17:29.33,000 --> 0:17:34,000
and can't wait to see what comes out of this exciting, exciting activity.

318
0:17:34.33,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Let me come back to the beginning,

319
0:17:36.33,000 --> 0:17:39,000
to end this presentation.

320
0:17:39.33,000 --> 0:17:41,000
I'll tell you that one of the things

321
0:17:41.33,000 --> 0:17:44,000
that I feel is really critical for us in industry, in business,

322
0:17:44.33,000 --> 0:17:48,000
is to be able to be passionate about solving these problems.

323
0:17:48.33,000 --> 0:17:51,000
I don't think it's enough to be able to put them on a spreadsheet,

324
0:17:51.33,000 --> 0:17:54,000
and look at numbers and say, yes, that's a good business.

325
0:17:54.33,000 --> 0:17:57,000
I really believe that you have to have a passion for it.

326
0:17:57.33,000 --> 0:17:59,000
And one of the things that I learned, too, from my parents --

327
0:17:59.33,000 --> 0:18:03,000
and I'll give you a little anecdote -- especially from my father.

328
0:18:03.33,000 --> 0:18:05,000
And it took me a while to understand it,

329
0:18:05.33,000 --> 0:18:07,000
but he said to me, when I went to college, he said,

330
0:18:07.33,000 --> 0:18:09,000
"You're the first person in the family to go to college.

331
0:18:09.33,000 --> 0:18:12,000
And it's really important you understand

332
0:18:12.33,000 --> 0:18:14,000
that for civilization to make progress,

333
0:18:14.33,000 --> 0:18:18,000
each generation has to do better than the last one.

334
0:18:18.33,000 --> 0:18:22,000
And therefore, this is your opportunity to do better than my generation."

335
0:18:22.33,000 --> 0:18:26,000
Frankly, I don't know that I really understood what he told me at the time.

336
0:18:26.33,000 --> 0:18:3,000
I was eager to go off to college, and go find girls, and study,

337
0:18:30.33,000 --> 0:18:37,000
and girls, and study, but then I finished college and I fell in love.

338
0:18:37.33,000 --> 0:18:4,000
I graduated. I decided to get married.

339
0:18:40.33,000 --> 0:18:43,000
And on my wedding day, my father came to me again and said, "You know,

340
0:18:43.33,000 --> 0:18:46,000
I'm going to remind you again, that each generation

341
0:18:46.33,000 --> 0:18:48,000
has to do better than the last one.

342
0:18:48.33,000 --> 0:18:5,000
You have to be a better husband than I was,

343
0:18:50.33,000 --> 0:18:54,000
because that's how you make progress." And now he began to make sense.

344
0:18:54.33,000 --> 0:18:56,000
Because I knew what a great husband he was,

345
0:18:56.33,000 --> 0:19:,000
and now he was once again beginning to put pressure on me,

346
0:19:00.33,000 --> 0:19:04,000
like he did when I was a little kid. And then a few years later, I had a child,

347
0:19:04.33,000 --> 0:19:08,000
my first child, and again, my father comes

348
0:19:08.33,000 --> 0:19:11,000
to the hospital, and we're looking at the glass,

349
0:19:11.33,000 --> 0:19:14,000
and see all the children on the other side, and he said,

350
0:19:14.33,000 --> 0:19:18,000
"I've got to remind you again, that for each generation to do better,

351
0:19:18.33,000 --> 0:19:21,000
you're going to have to be a better father than I was."

352
0:19:21.33,000 --> 0:19:24,000
That's when it dawned on me the tremendous challenge

353
0:19:24.33,000 --> 0:19:27,000
that he was placing on me, because he was a great father.

354
0:19:30.33,000 --> 0:19:35,000
to really get up every day in the morning and want to do better,

355
0:19:35.33,000 --> 0:19:38,000
to really get up and think that my role in life

356
0:19:38.33,000 --> 0:19:41,000
is not just to be the CEO of a Fortune 500 company.

357
0:19:41.33,000 --> 0:19:43,000
It's got to be that someday I can look back,

358
0:19:43.33,000 --> 0:19:47,000
and this place is truly better through some small contribution

359
0:19:47.33,000 --> 0:19:49,000
that perhaps each of us could make.

360
0:19:49.33,000 --> 0:19:51,000
Thank you very much.

361
0:19:51.33,000 --> 0:19:52,000
(Applause)

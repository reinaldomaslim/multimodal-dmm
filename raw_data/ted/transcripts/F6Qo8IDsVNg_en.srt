1
0:00:13.272,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Picture this:

2
0:00:14.649,000 --> 0:00:15,000
It's Monday morning,

3
0:00:15.742,000 --> 0:00:16,000
you're at the office,

4
0:00:16.861,000 --> 0:00:17,000
you're settling in for the day at work,

5
0:00:18.615,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and this guy that you sort of recognize from down the hall,

6
0:00:21.437,000 --> 0:00:22,000
walks right into your cubicle

7
0:00:23.273,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and he steals your chair.

8
0:00:24.675,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Doesn't say a word —

9
0:00:25.917,000 --> 0:00:26,000
just rolls away with it.

10
0:00:27.305,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Doesn't give you any information about why he took your chair

11
0:00:29.788,000 --> 0:00:31,000
out of all the other chairs that are out there.

12
0:00:31.899,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Doesn't acknowledge the fact that you might need your chair

13
0:00:34.041,000 --> 0:00:35,000
to get some work done today.

14
0:00:35.582,000 --> 0:00:37,000
You wouldn't stand for it. You'd make a stink.

15
0:00:37.839,000 --> 0:00:39,000
You'd follow that guy back to his cubicle

16
0:00:39.866,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and you'd say, "Why my chair?"

17
0:00:43.178,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Okay, so now it's Tuesday morning and you're at the office,

18
0:00:47.299,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and a meeting invitation pops up in your calendar.

19
0:00:50.028,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Laughter)

20
0:00:51.633,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And it's from this woman who you kind of know from down the hall,

21
0:00:54.709,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and the subject line references some project that you heard a little bit about.

22
0:00:58.514,000 --> 0:00:59,000
But there's no agenda.

23
0:01:00.197,000 --> 0:01:03,000
There's no information about why you were invited to the meeting.

24
0:01:03.273,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And yet you accept the meeting invitation, and you go.

25
0:01:07.889,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And when this highly unproductive session is over,

26
0:01:10.816,000 --> 0:01:11,000
you go back to your desk,

27
0:01:12.499,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and you stand at your desk and you say,

28
0:01:14.008,000 --> 0:01:16,000
"Boy, I wish I had those two hours back,

29
0:01:16.671,000 --> 0:01:18,000
like I wish I had my chair back."

30
0:01:18.674,000 --> 0:01:19,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:20.18,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Every day, we allow our coworkers,

32
0:01:22.751,000 --> 0:01:24,000
who are otherwise very, very nice people,

33
0:01:24.965,000 --> 0:01:25,000
to steal from us.

34
0:01:26.632,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And I'm talking about something far more valuable than office furniture.

35
0:01:30.71,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I'm talking about time. Your time.

36
0:01:33.739,000 --> 0:01:35,000
In fact, I believe that

37
0:01:36.392,000 --> 0:01:38,000
we are in the middle of a global epidemic

38
0:01:38.877,000 --> 0:01:43,000
of a terrible new illness known as MAS:

39
0:01:43.917,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Mindless Accept Syndrome.

40
0:01:46.19,000 --> 0:01:47,000
(Laughter)

41
0:01:48.084,000 --> 0:01:5,000
The primary symptom of Mindless Accept Syndrome

42
0:01:50.785,000 --> 0:01:53,000
is just accepting a meeting invitation the minute it pops up in your calendar.

43
0:01:54.705,000 --> 0:01:55,000
(Laughter)

44
0:01:55.975,000 --> 0:01:58,000
It's an involuntary reflex — ding, click, bing — it's in your calendar,

45
0:01:59.643,000 --> 0:02:02,000
"Gotta go, I'm already late for a meeting." (Laughter)

46
0:02:02.936,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Meetings are important, right?

47
0:02:05.323,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And collaboration is key to the success of any enterprise.

48
0:02:08.269,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And a well-run meeting can yield really positive, actionable results.

49
0:02:11.662,000 --> 0:02:12,000
But between globalization

50
0:02:13.42,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and pervasive information technology,

51
0:02:15.735,000 --> 0:02:16,000
the way that we work

52
0:02:17.406,000 --> 0:02:2,000
has really changed dramatically over the last few years.

53
0:02:20.635,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And we're miserable. (Laughter)

54
0:02:23.842,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And we're miserable not because the other guy can't run a good meeting,

55
0:02:27.382,000 --> 0:02:29,000
it's because of MAS, our Mindless Accept Syndrome,

56
0:02:30.194,000 --> 0:02:33,000
which is a self-inflicted wound.

57
0:02:33.97,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Actually, I have evidence to prove that MAS is a global epidemic.

58
0:02:39.117,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Let me tell you why.

59
0:02:40.764,000 --> 0:02:44,000
A couple of years ago, I put a video on Youtube, and in the video,

60
0:02:45.036,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I acted out every terrible conference call you've ever been on.

61
0:02:48.234,000 --> 0:02:49,000
It goes on for about five minutes,

62
0:02:49.893,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and it has all the things that we hate about really bad meetings.

63
0:02:53.084,000 --> 0:02:56,000
There's the moderator who has no idea how to run the meeting.

64
0:02:56.427,000 --> 0:02:58,000
There are the participants who have no idea why they're there.

65
0:02:58.985,000 --> 0:03:01,000
The whole thing kind of collapses into this collaborative train wreck.

66
0:03:02.688,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And everybody leaves very angry.

67
0:03:05.114,000 --> 0:03:06,000
It's kind of funny.

68
0:03:06.903,000 --> 0:03:07,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:08.486,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Let's take a quick look.

70
0:03:10.638,000 --> 0:03:13,000
(Video) Our goal today is to come to an agreement on a very important proposal.

71
0:03:14.465,000 --> 0:03:16,000
As a group, we need to decide if —

72
0:03:16.552,000 --> 0:03:18,000
bloop bloop —

73
0:03:19.331,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Hi, who just joined?

74
0:03:22.898,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Hi, it's Joe. I'm working from home today.

75
0:03:25.91,000 --> 0:03:26,000
(Laughter)

76
0:03:27.8,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Hi, Joe. Thanks for joining us today, great.

77
0:03:30.868,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I was just saying, we have a lot of people on the call we'd like to get through,

78
0:03:33.658,000 --> 0:03:34,000
so let's skip the roll call

79
0:03:35.292,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and I'm gonna dive right in.

80
0:03:37.965,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Our goal today is to come to an agreement on a very important proposal.

81
0:03:41.84,000 --> 0:03:43,000
As a group, we need to decide if —

82
0:03:44.405,000 --> 0:03:45,000
bloop bloop —

83
0:03:45.698,000 --> 0:03:46,000
(Laughter)

84
0:03:47.161,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Hi, who just joined?

85
0:03:49.184,000 --> 0:03:53,000
No? I thought I heard a beep. (Laughter)

86
0:03:53.993,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Sound familiar?

87
0:03:55.629,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Yeah, it sounds familiar to me, too.

88
0:03:57.606,000 --> 0:03:59,000
A couple of weeks after I put that online,

89
0:03:59.662,000 --> 0:04:01,000
500,000 people in dozens of countries,

90
0:04:02.463,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I mean dozens of countries,

91
0:04:04.103,000 --> 0:04:05,000
watched this video.

92
0:04:05.287,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And three years later, it's still getting thousands of views every month.

93
0:04:08.641,000 --> 0:04:09,000
It's close to about a million right now.

94
0:04:10.608,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And in fact, some of the biggest companies in the world,

95
0:04:12.616,000 --> 0:04:13,000
companies that you've heard of but I won't name,

96
0:04:14.526,000 --> 0:04:17,000
have asked for my permission to use this video in their new-hire training

97
0:04:18.421,000 --> 0:04:22,000
to teach their new employees how not to run a meeting at their company.

98
0:04:22.67,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And if the numbers —

99
0:04:24.155,000 --> 0:04:26,000
there are a million views and it's being used by all these companies —

100
0:04:26.536,000 --> 0:04:29,000
aren't enough proof that we have a global problem with meetings,

101
0:04:30.062,000 --> 0:04:31,000
there are the many, many thousands

102
0:04:31.839,000 --> 0:04:32,000
of comments posted online

103
0:04:33.459,000 --> 0:04:35,000
after the video went up.

104
0:04:35.647,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Thousands of people wrote things like,

105
0:04:37.621,000 --> 0:04:38,000
"OMG, that was my day today!"

106
0:04:39.475,000 --> 0:04:4,000
"That was my day every day!"

107
0:04:41.438,000 --> 0:04:42,000
"This is my life."

108
0:04:42.597,000 --> 0:04:42,000
One guy wrote,

109
0:04:43.527,000 --> 0:04:44,000
"It's funny because it's true.

110
0:04:45.066,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Eerily, sadly, depressingly true.

111
0:04:46.973,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It made me laugh until I cried.

112
0:04:48.691,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And cried. And I cried some more."

113
0:04:51.441,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Laughter)

114
0:04:53.073,000 --> 0:04:54,000
This poor guy said,

115
0:04:54.534,000 --> 0:04:59,000
"My daily life until retirement or death, sigh."

116
0:04:59.611,000 --> 0:05:,000
These are real quotes

117
0:05:01.011,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and it's real sad.

118
0:05:02.81,000 --> 0:05:04,000
A common theme running through all of these comments online

119
0:05:05.633,000 --> 0:05:07,000
is this fundamental belief that we are powerless

120
0:05:08.174,000 --> 0:05:09,000
to do anything other than go to meetings

121
0:05:10.075,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and suffer through these poorly run meetings

122
0:05:12.453,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and live to meet another day.

123
0:05:14.542,000 --> 0:05:17,000
But the truth is, we're not powerless at all.

124
0:05:17.683,000 --> 0:05:2,000
In fact, the cure for MAS is right here in our hands.

125
0:05:20.792,000 --> 0:05:22,000
It's right at our fingertips, literally.

126
0:05:22.977,000 --> 0:05:25,000
It's something that I call ¡No MAS!

127
0:05:26.238,000 --> 0:05:28,000
(Laughter)

128
0:05:28.468,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Which, if I remember my high school Spanish,

129
0:05:30.866,000 --> 0:05:32,000
means something like, "Enough already, make it stop!"

130
0:05:33.657,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Here's how No MAS works. It's very simple.

131
0:05:36.409,000 --> 0:05:39,000
First of all, the next time you get a meeting invitation

132
0:05:39.606,000 --> 0:05:41,000
that doesn't have a lot of information in it at all,

133
0:05:42.453,000 --> 0:05:43,000
click the tentative button!

134
0:05:44.293,000 --> 0:05:46,000
It's okay, you're allowed, that's why it's there.

135
0:05:46.743,000 --> 0:05:47,000
It's right next to the accept button.

136
0:05:48.252,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Or the maybe button, or whatever button is there for you not to accept immediately.

137
0:05:51.846,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Then, get in touch with the person who asked you to the meeting.

138
0:05:55.629,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Tell them you're very excited to support their work,

139
0:05:58.215,000 --> 0:06:,000
ask them what the goal of the meeting is,

140
0:06:00.23,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and tell them you're interested in learning how you can help them achieve their goal.

141
0:06:03.917,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And if we do this often enough,

142
0:06:05.845,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and we do it respectfully,

143
0:06:07.183,000 --> 0:06:09,000
people might start to be a little bit more thoughtful

144
0:06:09.22,000 --> 0:06:11,000
about the way they put together meeting invitations.

145
0:06:11.682,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And you can make more thoughtful decisions about accepting it.

146
0:06:14.534,000 --> 0:06:17,000
People might actually start sending out agendas. Imagine!

147
0:06:17.794,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Or they might not have a conference call with 12 people to talk about a status

148
0:06:21.542,000 --> 0:06:24,000
when they could just do a quick email and get it done with.

149
0:06:24.825,000 --> 0:06:28,000
People just might start to change their behavior because you changed yours.

150
0:06:29.659,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And they just might bring your chair back, too. (Laughter)

151
0:06:33.144,000 --> 0:06:34,000
No MAS!

152
0:06:34.519,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Thank you.

153
0:06:35.959,000 --> 0:06:37,000
(Applause).

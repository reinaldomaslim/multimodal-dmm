1
0:00:12.793,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm a writer-director who tells social-change stories,

2
0:00:16.737,000 --> 0:00:19,000
because I believe stories touch and move us.

3
0:00:20.007,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Stories humanize and teach us to empathize.

4
0:00:23.612,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Stories change us.

5
0:00:26.144,000 --> 0:00:28,000
When I write and direct plays,

6
0:00:28.19,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I'm amplifying voices of disadvantaged groups,

7
0:00:31.763,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I'm fighting the self-censorship

8
0:00:33.648,000 --> 0:00:37,000
that has kept many Ugandan artists away from social, political theater

9
0:00:38.585,000 --> 0:00:43,000
since the persecution of artists by former Ugandan president, Idi Amin.

10
0:00:44.43,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And most importantly, I am breaking the silence

11
0:00:48.51,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and provoking meaningful conversations on taboo issues,

12
0:00:52.228,000 --> 0:00:56,000
where often "Silence is golden" is the rule of thumb.

13
0:00:57.275,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Conversations are important

14
0:00:59.703,000 --> 0:01:02,000
because they inform and challenge our minds to think,

15
0:01:03.601,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and change starts with thinking.

16
0:01:06.974,000 --> 0:01:1,000
One of my struggles with activism is its often one-sided nature

17
0:01:11.674,000 --> 0:01:13,000
that blinds us to alternative view,

18
0:01:14.061,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that numbs our empathy,

19
0:01:16.227,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that makes us view those who see issues differently

20
0:01:19.72,000 --> 0:01:25,000
as ignorant, self-hating, brainwashed, sellout or plain stupid.

21
0:01:26.994,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I believe no one is ignorant.

22
0:01:29.883,000 --> 0:01:32,000
We are all experts, only in different fields.

23
0:01:34.117,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And this is why, for me, the saying "stay in your truth" is misleading.

24
0:01:40.204,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Because if you're staying in your truth,

25
0:01:42.561,000 --> 0:01:44,000
isn't it logical that the person you believe is wrong

26
0:01:45.553,000 --> 0:01:46,000
is also staying in their truth?

27
0:01:48.117,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So, what you have is two extremes

28
0:01:51.125,000 --> 0:01:55,000
that shut out all possible avenues of conversations.

29
0:01:56.061,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I create provocative theater and film to touch, humanize

30
0:02:01.712,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and move disagreeing parties to the conversation table

31
0:02:06.022,000 --> 0:02:08,000
to bridge misunderstandings.

32
0:02:09.826,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I know that listening to one another will not magically solve all problems.

33
0:02:15.198,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But it will give a chance to create avenues

34
0:02:17.573,000 --> 0:02:21,000
to start to work together to solve many of humanity's problems.

35
0:02:22.661,000 --> 0:02:24,000
With my first play, "Silent Voices,"

36
0:02:25.269,000 --> 0:02:28,000
based on interviews with victims of the Northern Uganda war

37
0:02:28.903,000 --> 0:02:31,000
between the government and Joseph Kony's LRA rebel group,

38
0:02:32.878,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I brought together victims, political leaders, religious leaders,

39
0:02:37.664,000 --> 0:02:41,000
cultural leaders, the Amnesty Commission and transitional justice leadership

40
0:02:42.53,000 --> 0:02:47,000
for critical conversations on issues of justice for war crime victims --

41
0:02:48.327,000 --> 0:02:51,000
the first of its kind in the history of Uganda.

42
0:02:51.804,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And so many powerful things happened,

43
0:02:54.892,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that I can't even cover them all right now.

44
0:02:57.872,000 --> 0:03:,000
Victims were given the opportunity to sit at the table

45
0:03:01.602,000 --> 0:03:03,000
with Amnesty Commission leadership,

46
0:03:03.893,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and they expressed the big injustice they suffered

47
0:03:07.514,000 --> 0:03:08,000
when the Commission ignored them

48
0:03:09.516,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and instead facilitated the resettlement of the war perpetrators.

49
0:03:15.822,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And the Amnesty Commission acknowledged the victims' pain

50
0:03:19.522,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and explained the thinking behind their flawed approaches.

51
0:03:24.252,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But one of the things that has stayed with me

52
0:03:26.792,000 --> 0:03:29,000
is when, during my Northern Uganda tour of the play,

53
0:03:30.188,000 --> 0:03:32,000
a man approached me and introduced himself

54
0:03:33.03,000 --> 0:03:36,000
as a former rebel soldier of Joseph Kony.

55
0:03:37.006,000 --> 0:03:41,000
He told me that he didn't want me to leave feeling disappointed,

56
0:03:41.181,000 --> 0:03:44,000
due to some of what I considered inappropriate laughter.

57
0:03:45.133,000 --> 0:03:49,000
He explained that his was a laughter of embarrassment

58
0:03:50.149,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and a recognition of his own embarrassment.

59
0:03:53.593,000 --> 0:03:56,000
He saw himself in the actors onstage

60
0:03:57.379,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and saw the meaninglessness of his past actions.

61
0:04:02.307,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So I say: share your truths.

62
0:04:05.601,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Listen to one another's truths.

63
0:04:08.221,000 --> 0:04:11,000
You will discover a more powerfully uniting truth

64
0:04:11.898,000 --> 0:04:12,000
in the middle ground.

65
0:04:14.212,000 --> 0:04:15,000
When I lived in the USA,

66
0:04:16.069,000 --> 0:04:19,000
many of my American friends would be shocked at my ignorance

67
0:04:19.887,000 --> 0:04:22,000
at fancy Western dishes like lasagna, for instance.

68
0:04:23.744,000 --> 0:04:24,000
(Laughter)

69
0:04:24.966,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And my question to them would be,

70
0:04:27.046,000 --> 0:04:29,000
"Well, do you know malakwang?"

71
0:04:29.673,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And then I would tell them about malakwang,

72
0:04:32.728,000 --> 0:04:35,000
a fancy vegetable dish from my culture.

73
0:04:36.403,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And they would tell me about lasagna.

74
0:04:38.776,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And we would leave richer and fuller individuals.

75
0:04:43.109,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Therefore, share your recipe truth.

76
0:04:47.188,000 --> 0:04:48,000
It makes for a better meal.

77
0:04:49.157,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Thank you.

78
0:04:50.331,000 --> 0:04:56,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.755,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So many of us who care about sustainable development

2
0:00:16.71,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and the livelihood of local people

3
0:00:18.781,000 --> 0:00:19,000
do so for deeply personal reasons.

4
0:00:22.507,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I grew up in Cameroon,

5
0:00:23.921,000 --> 0:00:26,000
a country of enchanting beauty and rich biodiversity,

6
0:00:27.534,000 --> 0:00:3,000
but plagued by poor governance, environmental destruction, and poverty.

7
0:00:32.444,000 --> 0:00:37,000
As a child, like we see with most children in sub-Saharan Africa today,

8
0:00:37.528,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I regularly suffered from malaria.

9
0:00:39.462,000 --> 0:00:43,000
To this day, more than one million people die from malaria every year,

10
0:00:44.214,000 --> 0:00:46,000
mostly children under the age of five,

11
0:00:46.606,000 --> 0:00:48,000
with 90 percent occurring in sub-Saharan Africa.

12
0:00:51.029,000 --> 0:00:54,000
When I was 18, I left Cameroon

13
0:00:54.283,000 --> 0:00:56,000
in search of better educational opportunities.

14
0:00:57.433,000 --> 0:00:59,000
At the time, there was just one university in Cameroon,

15
0:01:00.362,000 --> 0:01:02,000
but Nigeria next door offered some opportunities

16
0:01:02.91,000 --> 0:01:05,000
for Cameroonians of English extraction to be trained in various fields.

17
0:01:07.082,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So I moved there,

18
0:01:08.962,000 --> 0:01:09,000
but practicing my trade,

19
0:01:10.853,000 --> 0:01:12,000
upon graduation as an ecologist in Nigeria,

20
0:01:13.059,000 --> 0:01:14,000
was an even bigger challenge.

21
0:01:14.856,000 --> 0:01:15,000
So I left the continent

22
0:01:16.44,000 --> 0:01:19,000
when I was offered a scholarship to Boston University for my PhD.

23
0:01:23.014,000 --> 0:01:24,000
It is disheartening to see that,

24
0:01:24.952,000 --> 0:01:25,000
with all our challenges,

25
0:01:26.643,000 --> 0:01:27,000
with all the talents,

26
0:01:28.048,000 --> 0:01:3,000
with all the skills we have in Africa as a continent,

27
0:01:30.992,000 --> 0:01:32,000
we tend to solve our problems

28
0:01:33.23,000 --> 0:01:36,000
by parachuting in experts from the West for short stays,

29
0:01:36.969,000 --> 0:01:39,000
exporting the best and brightest out of Africa,

30
0:01:40.397,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and treating Africa as a continent in perpetual need of handouts.

31
0:01:45.368,000 --> 0:01:47,000
After my training at Boston University,

32
0:01:47.734,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I joined a research team

33
0:01:48.948,000 --> 0:01:49,000
at the University of California's

34
0:01:50.59,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Institute of the Environment and Sustainability

35
0:01:52.812,000 --> 0:01:54,000
because of its reputation for groundbreaking research

36
0:01:55.519,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and the development of policies and programs

37
0:01:57.662,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that save the lives of millions of people the world over,

38
0:02:00.663,000 --> 0:02:01,000
including in the developing world.

39
0:02:02.858,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And it has been shown

40
0:02:04.04,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that for every skilled African that returns home,

41
0:02:06.425,000 --> 0:02:09,000
nine new jobs are created in the formal and informal sectors.

42
0:02:10.776,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So as part of our program, therefore, to build a sustainable Africa together,

43
0:02:14.712,000 --> 0:02:18,000
we are leading a multi-initiative to develop the Congo Basin Institute,

44
0:02:18.95,000 --> 0:02:19,000
a permanent base

45
0:02:20.632,000 --> 0:02:24,000
where Africans can work in partnership with international researchers,

46
0:02:24.924,000 --> 0:02:26,000
but working out their own solutions to their own problems.

47
0:02:29.042,000 --> 0:02:33,000
We are using our interdisciplinary approach to show how universities,

48
0:02:33.86,000 --> 0:02:35,000
NGOs and private business

49
0:02:36.495,000 --> 0:02:38,000
can partner in international development.

50
0:02:39.781,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So instead of parachuting in experts from the West for short stays,

51
0:02:43.893,000 --> 0:02:45,000
we are building a permanent presence in Africa,

52
0:02:46.378,000 --> 0:02:49,000
a one-stop shop for logistics, housing

53
0:02:50.012,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and development of collaborative projects

54
0:02:52.05,000 --> 0:02:54,000
between Africans and international researchers.

55
0:02:54.825,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So this has allowed students like Michel

56
0:02:57.839,000 --> 0:02:59,000
to receive high-quality training in Africa.

57
0:03:00.588,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Michel is currently working in our labs

58
0:03:03.109,000 --> 0:03:06,000
to investigate the effects of climate change on insects, for his PhD,

59
0:03:06.372,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and has already secured his post-doctorate fellowship

60
0:03:09.308,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that will enable him to stay on the continent.

61
0:03:12.605,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Also through our local help program,

62
0:03:15.922,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Dr. Gbenga Abiodun, a young Nigerian scientist,

63
0:03:19.081,000 --> 0:03:21,000
can work as a post-doctoral fellow

64
0:03:21.494,000 --> 0:03:23,000
with the Foundation for Professional Development

65
0:03:23.892,000 --> 0:03:25,000
in the University of Western Cape in South Africa

66
0:03:26.534,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and the University of California at the same time,

67
0:03:28.893,000 --> 0:03:31,000
investigating the effects of climate variability and change

68
0:03:32.389,000 --> 0:03:34,000
on malaria transmission in Africa.

69
0:03:34.449,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Indeed, Gbenga is currently developing models

70
0:03:36.854,000 --> 0:03:39,000
that will be used as an early warning system

71
0:03:40.14,000 --> 0:03:42,000
to predict malaria transmission in Africa.

72
0:03:43.603,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So rather than exporting our best and brightest out of Africa,

73
0:03:47.421,000 --> 0:03:5,000
we are nurturing and supporting local talent in Africa.

74
0:03:50.527,000 --> 0:03:51,000
For example, like me,

75
0:03:52.499,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Dr. Eric Fokam was trained in the US.

76
0:03:56.472,000 --> 0:03:59,000
He returned home to Cameroon, but couldn't secure the necessary grants,

77
0:03:59.83,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and he found it incredibly challenging

78
0:04:02.395,000 --> 0:04:05,000
to practice and learn the science he knew he could.

79
0:04:06.66,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So when I met Eric,

80
0:04:08.472,000 --> 0:04:1,000
he was on the verge of returning to the US.

81
0:04:10.592,000 --> 0:04:12,000
But we convinced him to start collaborating

82
0:04:13.076,000 --> 0:04:14,000
with the Congo Basin Institute.

83
0:04:14.952,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Today, his lab in Buea has over half a dozen collaborative grants

84
0:04:19.593,000 --> 0:04:21,000
with researchers from the US and Europe

85
0:04:22.191,000 --> 0:04:25,000
supporting 14 graduate students, nine of them women,

86
0:04:25.776,000 --> 0:04:27,000
all carrying out groundbreaking research

87
0:04:27.816,000 --> 0:04:29,000
understanding biodiversity under climate change,

88
0:04:30.245,000 --> 0:04:31,000
human health and nutrition.

89
0:04:32.367,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Applause)

90
0:04:38.222,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So rather than buy into the ideas of Africa taking handouts,

91
0:04:42.564,000 --> 0:04:44,000
we are using our interdisciplinary approach

92
0:04:45.46,000 --> 0:04:47,000
to empower Africans to find their own solutions.

93
0:04:48.779,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Right now, we are working with local communities and students,

94
0:04:52.843,000 --> 0:04:53,000
a US entrepreneur,

95
0:04:54.662,000 --> 0:04:56,000
scientists from the US and Africa

96
0:04:57.328,000 --> 0:05:01,000
to find a way to sustainably grow ebony, the iconic African hardwood.

97
0:05:03.419,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Ebonies, like most African hardwood, are exploited for timber,

98
0:05:07.13,000 --> 0:05:09,000
but we know very little about their ecology,

99
0:05:09.891,000 --> 0:05:1,000
what disperses them,

100
0:05:11.483,000 --> 0:05:14,000
how they survive in our forest 80 to 200 years.

101
0:05:16.044,000 --> 0:05:17,000
This is Arvin,

102
0:05:17.938,000 --> 0:05:2,000
a young PhD student working in our labs,

103
0:05:21.001,000 --> 0:05:24,000
conducting what is turning out to be some cutting-edge tissue culture work.

104
0:05:25.549,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Arvin is holding in her hands

105
0:05:27.534,000 --> 0:05:3,000
the first ebony tree that was produced entirely from tissues.

106
0:05:31.961,000 --> 0:05:32,000
This is unique in Africa.

107
0:05:33.486,000 --> 0:05:35,000
We can now show that you can produce African timber

108
0:05:36.295,000 --> 0:05:37,000
from different plant tissues --

109
0:05:37.811,000 --> 0:05:39,000
leaves, stems, roots --

110
0:05:40.018,000 --> 0:05:42,000
in addition from generating them from seeds,

111
0:05:42.757,000 --> 0:05:43,000
which is a very difficult task.

112
0:05:45.608,000 --> 0:05:48,000
(Applause)

113
0:05:49.213,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So other students will take the varieties of ebony

114
0:05:51.616,000 --> 0:05:53,000
which Arvin identifies in our lab,

115
0:05:54.229,000 --> 0:05:56,000
graft them to produce saplings,

116
0:05:56.325,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and work with local communities to co-produce ebony

117
0:05:59.285,000 --> 0:06:01,000
with local fruit tree species in their various farms

118
0:06:02.246,000 --> 0:06:04,000
using our own tree farm approach,

119
0:06:04.405,000 --> 0:06:06,000
whereby we invite all the farmers

120
0:06:06.579,000 --> 0:06:08,000
to choose their own tree species they want in their farms.

121
0:06:10.243,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So in addition to the ebony,

122
0:06:12.183,000 --> 0:06:14,000
the species which the farmers choose themselves

123
0:06:14.532,000 --> 0:06:16,000
will be produced using our modern techniques

124
0:06:16.911,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and incorporated into their land-use systems,

125
0:06:19.031,000 --> 0:06:21,000
so that they start benefiting from these products

126
0:06:21.38,000 --> 0:06:23,000
while waiting for the ebony to mature.

127
0:06:24.736,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Today we are planting 15,000 ebony trees in Cameroon,

128
0:06:27.999,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and for the first time,

129
0:06:29.538,000 --> 0:06:32,000
ebony won't be harvested from the middle of a pristine forest.

130
0:06:32.93,000 --> 0:06:34,000
This is the model for our African hardwoods,

131
0:06:35.211,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and we are extending this to include sapele and bubinga,

132
0:06:38.169,000 --> 0:06:39,000
other highly prized hardwoods.

133
0:06:40.94,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So if these examples existed when I was 18,

134
0:06:45.297,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I would never have left,

135
0:06:47.61,000 --> 0:06:49,000
but because of initiatives by the Congo Basin Institute,

136
0:06:50.545,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I am coming back,

137
0:06:52.483,000 --> 0:06:53,000
but I'm not coming back alone.

138
0:06:54.335,000 --> 0:06:56,000
I'm bringing with me Western scientists,

139
0:06:56.833,000 --> 0:06:57,000
entrepreneurs and students,

140
0:06:58.552,000 --> 0:07:01,000
the best science from the best universities in the world,

141
0:07:01.718,000 --> 0:07:02,000
to work and to live in Africa.

142
0:07:04.908,000 --> 0:07:08,000
But we all need to scale up this local, powerful and empowering approach.

143
0:07:10.169,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So far we have half a dozen universities and NGOs as partners.

144
0:07:15.366,000 --> 0:07:16,000
We are planning to build

145
0:07:17.089,000 --> 0:07:2,000
a green facility that will expand on our existing laboratory space

146
0:07:20.209,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and add more housing and conference facilities

147
0:07:22.47,000 --> 0:07:24,000
to promote a long-term disciplinary approach.

148
0:07:25.366,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I want it to offer more opportunities to young African scholars,

149
0:07:28.653,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and would scale it up by leveraging

150
0:07:31.272,000 --> 0:07:34,000
the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture's existing network

151
0:07:34.663,000 --> 0:07:36,000
of 17 research stations across sub-Saharan Africa.

152
0:07:38.676,000 --> 0:07:39,000
The tables are starting to turn ...

153
0:07:41.494,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and I hope they keep turning,

154
0:07:43.794,000 --> 0:07:44,000
to reach several African nations

155
0:07:45.796,000 --> 0:07:48,000
like Côte d'Ivoire, Tanzania and Senegal,

156
0:07:49.701,000 --> 0:07:51,000
among the top fastest growing economies

157
0:07:52.208,000 --> 0:07:56,000
that can attract several opportunities for private-sector investment.

158
0:07:59.153,000 --> 0:08:02,000
We want to give more opportunities to African scholars,

159
0:08:02.234,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and I long to see a day

160
0:08:04.035,000 --> 0:08:07,000
when the most intelligent Africans will stay on this continent

161
0:08:07.423,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and receive high-quality education

162
0:08:09.893,000 --> 0:08:11,000
through initiatives like the Congo Basin Institute,

163
0:08:12.369,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and when that happens,

164
0:08:13.743,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Africa will be on the way to solving Africa's problems.

165
0:08:17.1,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And in 50 years, I hope someone will be giving a TED Talk

166
0:08:20.881,000 --> 0:08:23,000
on how to stop the brain drain of Westerners leaving your homes

167
0:08:24.779,000 --> 0:08:25,000
to work and live in Africa.

168
0:08:26.366,000 --> 0:08:27,000
(Applause)

169
0:08:27.391,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Thank you.

170
0:08:28.573,000 --> 0:08:33,000

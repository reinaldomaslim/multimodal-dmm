1
0:00:25.82,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I'm going to present three projects in

2
0:00:28.289,000 --> 0:00:31,000
rapid-fire I don't have much time to do

3
0:00:29.91,000 --> 0:00:33,000
it and I want to reinforce three ideas

4
0:00:32.25,000 --> 0:00:35,000
with that rapid-fire presentation the

5
0:00:34.14,000 --> 0:00:37,000
first is what I like to call a hyper

6
0:00:35.519,000 --> 0:00:39,000
rational process it's a process that

7
0:00:37.44,000 --> 0:00:42,000
takes rationality and almost to an

8
0:00:39.93,000 --> 0:00:43,000
absurd level it transcends all the

9
0:00:42.57,000 --> 0:00:45,000
baggage that normally comes with what

10
0:00:44.729,000 --> 0:00:47,000
people would call sort of a rational

11
0:00:46.47,000 --> 0:00:49,000
conclusion to something it concludes in

12
0:00:48.72,000 --> 0:00:52,000
something you see here you actually

13
0:00:50.37,000 --> 0:00:58,000
wouldn't expect as being the result of

14
0:00:52.86,000 --> 0:01:,000
rationality the second the second is

15
0:00:59.07,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that this process does not have a

16
0:01:01.619,000 --> 0:01:04,000
signature there is no authorship

17
0:01:03.78,000 --> 0:01:06,000
architects are obsessed with authorship

18
0:01:05.61,000 --> 0:01:08,000
this is something that has editing and

19
0:01:07.53,000 --> 0:01:1,000
it has teams that in fact may no longer

20
0:01:09.18,000 --> 0:01:13,000
see within this process the traditional

21
0:01:11.34,000 --> 0:01:16,000
master architect creating a sketch that

22
0:01:13.74,000 --> 0:01:18,000
his minions carry out and the third is

23
0:01:17.13,000 --> 0:01:2,000
that it challenges and this is in this

24
0:01:18.96,000 --> 0:01:22,000
the length of this very hard to to

25
0:01:21.03,000 --> 0:01:25,000
support why connect all these things but

26
0:01:23.549,000 --> 0:01:26,000
it challenges the high modernist notion

27
0:01:25.17,000 --> 0:01:29,000
of flexibility high modernist said we

28
0:01:27.36,000 --> 0:01:3,000
will create sort of singular spaces that

29
0:01:29.34,000 --> 0:01:32,000
are generic almost anything can happen

30
0:01:30.72,000 --> 0:01:34,000
within them I call it sort of shotgun

31
0:01:32.46,000 --> 0:01:36,000
flexibility turn turn your head this way

32
0:01:35.04,000 --> 0:01:38,000
shoot and you're bound to kill something

33
0:01:36.62,000 --> 0:01:4,000
so this is the promise of high modernism

34
0:01:38.94,000 --> 0:01:42,000
within a single space actually any kind

35
0:01:41.159,000 --> 0:01:46,000
of activity can happen but as we're

36
0:01:42.96,000 --> 0:01:47,000
seeing operational costs are starting to

37
0:01:46.17,000 --> 0:01:5,000
dwarf capital costs in terms of design

38
0:01:48.63,000 --> 0:01:52,000
parameters so with this sort of idea

39
0:01:50.94,000 --> 0:01:54,000
what happens is whatever actually is in

40
0:01:53.549,000 --> 0:01:55,000
the building an opening day or whatever

41
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
seems to be the most immediate need

42
0:01:56.49,000 --> 0:02:,000
starts to divorce the possibility and

43
0:01:59.01,000 --> 0:02:03,000
sort of subsume it of anything else

44
0:02:01.08,000 --> 0:02:04,000
could ever happen and so we're proposing

45
0:02:03.18,000 --> 0:02:07,000
a different kind of flexibility

46
0:02:04.65,000 --> 0:02:09,000
something we call compartmentalized

47
0:02:07.879,000 --> 0:02:11,000
flexibility and the idea is that you

48
0:02:10.08,000 --> 0:02:14,000
within that continuum identify a series

49
0:02:12.39,000 --> 0:02:15,000
of points you design specifically to

50
0:02:14.4,000 --> 0:02:17,000
them they can be pushed off center a

51
0:02:15.81,000 --> 0:02:18,000
little bit but in the end you actually

52
0:02:17.489,000 --> 0:02:21,000
still get as much of that original

53
0:02:19.049,000 --> 0:02:23,000
spectrum as you originally had hoped

54
0:02:21.569,000 --> 0:02:25,000
with high modernist flexibility that

55
0:02:23.34,000 --> 0:02:27,000
doesn't really work so I'm going to talk

56
0:02:25.83,000 --> 0:02:28,000
about I'm going to sort of build up the

57
0:02:27.42,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Seattle Central Library in this way

58
0:02:28.83,000 --> 0:02:31,000
before your eyes and about five or six

59
0:02:30.719,000 --> 0:02:34,000
diagrams and I truly mean this is the

60
0:02:32.489,000 --> 0:02:35,000
design process that you'll see with the

61
0:02:34.919,000 --> 0:02:37,000
library staff and the

62
0:02:36.17,000 --> 0:02:4,000
bored we settled on two core positions

63
0:02:38.66,000 --> 0:02:41,000
this is the first one and this is

64
0:02:40.459,000 --> 0:02:42,000
showing over the last nine hundred years

65
0:02:41.87,000 --> 0:02:46,000
the evolution of the book and other

66
0:02:43.31,000 --> 0:02:48,000
technologies this diagram was our sort

67
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
of position piece about the book in our

68
0:02:49.01,000 --> 0:02:53,000
position was books are technology that

69
0:02:51.47,000 --> 0:02:54,000
something people forget but it's a form

70
0:02:53.84,000 --> 0:02:56,000
of technology that will have to share

71
0:02:55.19,000 --> 0:02:59,000
its dominance with any other form of

72
0:02:56.93,000 --> 0:03:,000
truly potent technology or media the

73
0:03:00.02,000 --> 0:03:02,000
second premise and this was something

74
0:03:01.58,000 --> 0:03:04,000
was very difficult for us to convince

75
0:03:02.93,000 --> 0:03:05,000
the librarians of it first is that

76
0:03:04.67,000 --> 0:03:07,000
libraries since the inception of

77
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Carnegie Library tradition in America

78
0:03:08.14,000 --> 0:03:11,000
had a second responsibility and that was

79
0:03:10.85,000 --> 0:03:12,000
for social roles

80
0:03:11.93,000 --> 0:03:14,000
okay now this I'll come back to later

81
0:03:13.519,000 --> 0:03:16,000
was something actually the librarians at

82
0:03:15.53,000 --> 0:03:19,000
first said no this isn't our mandate our

83
0:03:17.36,000 --> 0:03:22,000
mandate is media and particularly the

84
0:03:20.209,000 --> 0:03:24,000
book so what you're seeing now is

85
0:03:22.94,000 --> 0:03:26,000
actually the design of the building the

86
0:03:24.41,000 --> 0:03:29,000
upper diagram is what we had seen a

87
0:03:27.59,000 --> 0:03:31,000
whole host of contemporary libraries

88
0:03:29.989,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that used high modernist flexibility

89
0:03:32.06,000 --> 0:03:36,000
sort of any activity could happen

90
0:03:34.13,000 --> 0:03:37,000
anywhere we don't know the future of the

91
0:03:36.44,000 --> 0:03:39,000
library you don't know the future of the

92
0:03:37.61,000 --> 0:03:4,000
book and so we'll use this approach and

93
0:03:39.769,000 --> 0:03:42,000
what we saw were buildings that were

94
0:03:41,000 --> 0:03:44,000
very generic and worse not only do we

95
0:03:43.19,000 --> 0:03:45,000
see buildings that were very generic so

96
0:03:44.69,000 --> 0:03:47,000
not only was the reading room looked

97
0:03:46.13,000 --> 0:03:5,000
like the copy room looked like the

98
0:03:48.2,000 --> 0:03:52,000
magazine area but it meant that whatever

99
0:03:50.87,000 --> 0:03:54,000
issue was troubling the library at that

100
0:03:53.12,000 --> 0:03:56,000
moment was starting to engulf every

101
0:03:55.519,000 --> 0:03:57,000
other activity that was happening in it

102
0:03:56.9,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and in this case what was getting

103
0:03:58.37,000 --> 0:04:,000
engulfed for these social

104
0:03:59.42,000 --> 0:04:02,000
responsibilities by the expansion of the

105
0:04:01.25,000 --> 0:04:06,000
book and so we proposed what's at the

106
0:04:03.2,000 --> 0:04:08,000
lower diagram very dumb approach simply

107
0:04:06.829,000 --> 0:04:09,000
compartmentalized put those things whose

108
0:04:08.75,000 --> 0:04:11,000
evolution we could predict and I don't

109
0:04:10.28,000 --> 0:04:12,000
mean that we could say what it'll

110
0:04:11.87,000 --> 0:04:14,000
actually happen in the future but we

111
0:04:13.07,000 --> 0:04:16,000
have some certainty of the spectrum of

112
0:04:15.17,000 --> 0:04:18,000
what it would happen in the future put

113
0:04:16.7,000 --> 0:04:19,000
those in boxes designed specifically for

114
0:04:18.59,000 --> 0:04:21,000
it and put the things that we can't

115
0:04:20.03,000 --> 0:04:24,000
predict on their rooftops so that was

116
0:04:22.01,000 --> 0:04:27,000
the core idea now we had to convince the

117
0:04:24.8,000 --> 0:04:29,000
library that social roles was equally

118
0:04:27.59,000 --> 0:04:31,000
important to media in order to get them

119
0:04:30.289,000 --> 0:04:33,000
to accept this what you're seeing here

120
0:04:31.729,000 --> 0:04:35,000
is actually their program on the Left

121
0:04:33.979,000 --> 0:04:37,000
that's as it was given to us in all of

122
0:04:35.9,000 --> 0:04:4,000
its clarity and glory our first

123
0:04:38.87,000 --> 0:04:42,000
operation was to read I jest it or back

124
0:04:41.24,000 --> 0:04:44,000
to them show it to them and say you know

125
0:04:43.01,000 --> 0:04:46,000
what we haven't touched it but only

126
0:04:44.87,000 --> 0:04:47,000
one-third of your own program is

127
0:04:46.61,000 --> 0:04:48,000
dedicated to median books two thirds of

128
0:04:48.8,000 --> 0:04:5,000
it is all

129
0:04:49.4,000 --> 0:04:52,000
dedicated that's the white band below

130
0:04:51.08,000 --> 0:04:55,000
the thing you say isn't important is

131
0:04:52.729,000 --> 0:04:56,000
already dedicated to social functions so

132
0:04:55.52,000 --> 0:04:58,000
once we had presented that back to them

133
0:04:57.139,000 --> 0:05:,000
they agreed that this sort of core

134
0:04:58.91,000 --> 0:05:01,000
concept could work we got the right to

135
0:05:00.77,000 --> 0:05:03,000
go back to first principles that's the

136
0:05:02.24,000 --> 0:05:05,000
third diagram we recombined everything

137
0:05:03.979,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and then we started making new decisions

138
0:05:05.93,000 --> 0:05:08,000
which is seeing on the right is the

139
0:05:07.85,000 --> 0:05:11,000
design of the library specifically in

140
0:05:09.83,000 --> 0:05:14,000
terms of square footage on the left of

141
0:05:11.96,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that diagram here you'll see a series of

142
0:05:15.139,000 --> 0:05:19,000
five platforms sort of combs collective

143
0:05:17.93,000 --> 0:05:2,000
programs and on the right of the more

144
0:05:19.52,000 --> 0:05:22,000
indeterminate spaces things like Reading

145
0:05:21.259,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Room's whose evolution in 20 30 or 40

146
0:05:23.389,000 --> 0:05:27,000
years we can't predict so that literally

147
0:05:25.76,000 --> 0:05:29,000
was the design of the building they

148
0:05:27.53,000 --> 0:05:3,000
signed it in to the chagrin we came back

149
0:05:30.11,000 --> 0:05:33,000
a week later and we friends because I

150
0:05:31.46,000 --> 0:05:34,000
did them this okay and as you can see it

151
0:05:33.65,000 --> 0:05:35,000
is literally the diagram on the right

152
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:38,000
okay we just sized

153
0:05:36.5,000 --> 0:05:4,000
really I mean that literally the things

154
0:05:38.99,000 --> 0:05:42,000
in there on the left-hand side of the

155
0:05:40.97,000 --> 0:05:44,000
diagram was those are the boxes we sized

156
0:05:43.19,000 --> 0:05:46,000
them into five compartments are super

157
0:05:45.169,000 --> 0:05:48,000
efficient we had a very low budget to

158
0:05:46.699,000 --> 0:05:49,000
work with we pushed them around on the

159
0:05:48.41,000 --> 0:05:51,000
site to make very literal contextual

160
0:05:50.21,000 --> 0:05:54,000
relationships the reading room should be

161
0:05:51.77,000 --> 0:05:55,000
able to see the water the main entrance

162
0:05:54.32,000 --> 0:05:57,000
should have a public plaza in front of

163
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
it to abide by the zoning code and so

164
0:05:57.919,000 --> 0:06:01,000
forth so you see the five platforms

165
0:06:00.41,000 --> 0:06:03,000
those are the boxes within each one a

166
0:06:02.15,000 --> 0:06:05,000
very discrete thing is happening the

167
0:06:03.949,000 --> 0:06:06,000
area in between is sort of an urban

168
0:06:05.479,000 --> 0:06:08,000
continuum these things that we can't

169
0:06:07.4,000 --> 0:06:1,000
predict the revolution to the same

170
0:06:08.75,000 --> 0:06:12,000
degree to give you some sense of the

171
0:06:11.21,000 --> 0:06:15,000
power of this idea the biggest bought

172
0:06:13.37,000 --> 0:06:17,000
block is what we call the book spiral is

173
0:06:15.62,000 --> 0:06:2,000
literally built in a very inexpensive

174
0:06:17.96,000 --> 0:06:21,000
way it is a parking garage for books it

175
0:06:21.02,000 --> 0:06:23,000
just so happens to be on the sixth

176
0:06:22.4,000 --> 0:06:25,000
through tenth floor of the building but

177
0:06:23.69,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that is not necessarily an expensive

178
0:06:25.81,000 --> 0:06:29,000
approach and it allows us to organize

179
0:06:28.46,000 --> 0:06:32,000
the entire Dewey Decimal System on one

180
0:06:30.5,000 --> 0:06:34,000
continuous run no matter how it grows or

181
0:06:32.96,000 --> 0:06:36,000
contracts within the building it will

182
0:06:34.61,000 --> 0:06:38,000
always have its clarity to end the sort

183
0:06:37.729,000 --> 0:06:41,000
of Trail of Tears that we've all

184
0:06:39.02,000 --> 0:06:42,000
experienced in public letters

185
0:06:42.66,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and so this is the final operation which

186
0:06:44.37,000 --> 0:06:48,000
is to take these blocks as that were all

187
0:06:45.84,000 --> 0:06:5,000
pushed off kilter and to hold onto them

188
0:06:48.78,000 --> 0:06:52,000
with a skin that skin serves double duty

189
0:06:51.51,000 --> 0:06:54,000
again for economics one it is the

190
0:06:53.73,000 --> 0:06:55,000
lateral stability for the entire

191
0:06:55.139,000 --> 0:06:58,000
building it's a structural element and

192
0:06:56.61,000 --> 0:06:59,000
but it's dimensions are designed not

193
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
only for structure but also for holding

194
0:07:00.06,000 --> 0:07:04,000
on every piece of glass the glass was

195
0:07:03.21,000 --> 0:07:07,000
then I'll see use the word impregnate if

196
0:07:04.83,000 --> 0:07:08,000
it had a layer of metal that was called

197
0:07:07.44,000 --> 0:07:1,000
stretched metal that metal acts as a

198
0:07:09.03,000 --> 0:07:12,000
micro louver so from the exterior the

199
0:07:11.07,000 --> 0:07:14,000
building the Sun sees it is totally

200
0:07:12.51,000 --> 0:07:16,000
opaque but from the interior it's

201
0:07:14.1,000 --> 0:07:19,000
entirely transparent so now I'm going to

202
0:07:16.65,000 --> 0:07:2,000
take you on a tour of the building let's

203
0:07:19.74,000 --> 0:07:21,000
see if I can find it

204
0:07:20.76,000 --> 0:07:24,000
for anyone who is uh gets motion

205
0:07:22.68,000 --> 0:07:29,000
sickness I apologize so this is the

206
0:07:25.5,000 --> 0:07:31,000
building and I think what's important is

207
0:07:29.73,000 --> 0:07:34,000
when we first unveiled the building the

208
0:07:31.77,000 --> 0:07:36,000
public thought saw it as being totally

209
0:07:34.74,000 --> 0:07:38,000
about our whim and ego and it was

210
0:07:37.29,000 --> 0:07:39,000
defended believe it or not by the

211
0:07:38.79,000 --> 0:07:4,000
librarians they said look we don't know

212
0:07:40.139,000 --> 0:07:43,000
what it is but we know it's everything

213
0:07:41.76,000 --> 0:07:44,000
that we need it to be based on the

214
0:07:43.919,000 --> 0:07:5,000
observations that we've done about the

215
0:07:45.36,000 --> 0:07:52,000
program this is going into one of the

216
0:07:51.419,000 --> 0:07:58,000
entries so it's an unusual building for

217
0:07:53.01,000 --> 0:08:,000
a public library obviously so now we're

218
0:07:59.1,000 --> 0:08:02,000
going into what we call the reading room

219
0:08:00.78,000 --> 0:08:03,000
as our living room this is actually a

220
0:08:02.82,000 --> 0:08:05,000
program that we invented with the

221
0:08:04.5,000 --> 0:08:08,000
library it was recognizing that public

222
0:08:06.12,000 --> 0:08:1,000
libraries are the last vestige of public

223
0:08:08.729,000 --> 0:08:11,000
free space there are plenty of shopping

224
0:08:10.86,000 --> 0:08:14,000
malls that allow you to get out of the

225
0:08:12.12,000 --> 0:08:17,000
rain and in downtown Seattle but there

226
0:08:15.03,000 --> 0:08:18,000
are not so many free places that allows

227
0:08:17.97,000 --> 0:08:21,000
you to get out of the rain

228
0:08:18.96,000 --> 0:08:23,000
so this was an unprivileged anything

229
0:08:22.05,000 --> 0:08:27,000
including etl play chess and so forth

230
0:08:24.15,000 --> 0:08:29,000
now we're moving up into what we call

231
0:08:27.2,000 --> 0:08:31,000
the mixing chamber that was the main

232
0:08:29.88,000 --> 0:08:32,000
sort of technology area in the building

233
0:08:31.68,000 --> 0:08:35,000
if it tell me if I'm going too fast for

234
0:08:33.719,000 --> 0:08:35,000
you

235
0:08:38.07,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and now up

236
0:08:44.92,000 --> 0:08:47,000
this is actually the place that we put

237
0:08:47.23,000 --> 0:08:55,000
into the building so I could propose to

238
0:08:48.49,000 --> 0:08:54,000
my wife right there she said yes

239
0:08:57.61,000 --> 0:09:,000
I'm running out of time so I'm actually

240
0:08:59.41,000 --> 0:09:03,000
going to stop I can show this to you

241
0:09:00.97,000 --> 0:09:04,000
later but this if I can very quickly get

242
0:09:03.76,000 --> 0:09:06,000
into the book spiral because I think

243
0:09:05.199,000 --> 0:09:09,000
it's as I said the most this is the main

244
0:09:07.149,000 --> 0:09:14,000
reading room the most unique part of the

245
0:09:09.399,000 --> 0:09:16,000
building you dizzy yeah okay so here

246
0:09:14.32,000 --> 0:09:16,000
this is the book spiral

247
0:09:20.76,000 --> 0:09:24,000
so it's variant a certain indiscernible

248
0:09:23.04,000 --> 0:09:28,000
but it's actually a continuous stair

249
0:09:25.35,000 --> 0:09:29,000
stepping it allows you to on one city

250
0:09:28.17,000 --> 0:09:36,000
block go up one full floor so that it's

251
0:09:29.94,000 --> 0:09:37,000
on a continuum okay now I'm going to go

252
0:09:36.959,000 --> 0:09:4,000
back and certainly hit a second project

253
0:09:38.839,000 --> 0:09:42,000
if you go very very quickly through this

254
0:09:41.25,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and this is this Dallas theater it was

255
0:09:43.769,000 --> 0:09:47,000
an unusual client for us because they

256
0:09:45.54,000 --> 0:09:48,000
came to us and they said we need you to

257
0:09:47.91,000 --> 0:09:51,000
do a new building we've been working in

258
0:09:49.529,000 --> 0:09:53,000
a temporary space for thirty years but

259
0:09:52.41,000 --> 0:09:55,000
because of that temporary space we'd

260
0:09:54.18,000 --> 0:09:58,000
become an infamous theater company

261
0:09:56.399,000 --> 0:09:59,000
theater is really focused in New York

262
0:09:58.44,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Chicago and Seattle with the exception

263
0:10:00.389,000 --> 0:10:04,000
of the Dallas Theater Company and the

264
0:10:03.54,000 --> 0:10:05,000
very fact that they worked in a

265
0:10:04.5,000 --> 0:10:07,000
provisional space meant that for Beckett

266
0:10:06.3,000 --> 0:10:08,000
they could blow out a wall they could do

267
0:10:07.889,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Cherry Orchard and blow a hole through

268
0:10:09.18,000 --> 0:10:12,000
the floor and so forth so it was a very

269
0:10:11.07,000 --> 0:10:16,000
daunting task for us to do a brand new

270
0:10:13.079,000 --> 0:10:17,000
building that could keep the the sort of

271
0:10:16.17,000 --> 0:10:19,000
pristine building but keep this kind of

272
0:10:17.459,000 --> 0:10:22,000
experimental nature the second is they

273
0:10:19.709,000 --> 0:10:24,000
were what we call a multi form theater

274
0:10:22.529,000 --> 0:10:26,000
they do different kinds of performances

275
0:10:25.199,000 --> 0:10:28,000
in repertory so they in the morning will

276
0:10:27.269,000 --> 0:10:3,000
do something in arena then they'll do

277
0:10:28.98,000 --> 0:10:31,000
something and proscenium and so forth

278
0:10:30.779,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and so they needed to be able to quickly

279
0:10:32.22,000 --> 0:10:36,000
transform between different theater

280
0:10:34.319,000 --> 0:10:38,000
organizations and for operational budget

281
0:10:36.54,000 --> 0:10:4,000
reasons this actually no longer happens

282
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and pretty much any multi form theater

283
0:10:40.8,000 --> 0:10:43,000
in the United States so we needed to

284
0:10:42.06,000 --> 0:10:46,000
figure out a way to overcome that so our

285
0:10:44.55,000 --> 0:10:47,000
thought was to literally put the theater

286
0:10:46.17,000 --> 0:10:48,000
on its head to take those things that

287
0:10:47.55,000 --> 0:10:5,000
are previously defined as front of house

288
0:10:48.959,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and back of house and stack them above

289
0:10:50.97,000 --> 0:10:53,000
house and below house and to create so

290
0:10:53.25,000 --> 0:10:56,000
what we started to call a theater

291
0:10:54.54,000 --> 0:10:57,000
machine we invest the money in the

292
0:10:56.339,000 --> 0:10:58,000
operation of the building it's almost as

293
0:10:58.139,000 --> 0:11:,000
though the building could be placed

294
0:10:59.069,000 --> 0:11:02,000
anywhere wherever you place it the area

295
0:11:00.69,000 --> 0:11:03,000
underneath it is charged for theatrical

296
0:11:02.399,000 --> 0:11:05,000
performances and it allowed us to go

297
0:11:04.68,000 --> 0:11:07,000
back to first principles and redefine

298
0:11:06.24,000 --> 0:11:1,000
flight our acoustic enclosure light

299
0:11:08.49,000 --> 0:11:12,000
enclosure and so forth and out of the

300
0:11:11.01,000 --> 0:11:14,000
push of a button that allows the

301
0:11:12.63,000 --> 0:11:16,000
artistic director to move between

302
0:11:14.01,000 --> 0:11:2,000
proscenium thrust and in fact arena and

303
0:11:17.519,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Traverse and flat floor in a very quick

304
0:11:20.13,000 --> 0:11:24,000
defense for the Transfiguration so in

305
0:11:22.41,000 --> 0:11:26,000
fact we can go using operational budget

306
0:11:24.899,000 --> 0:11:27,000
we can sari capital costs we can

307
0:11:26.639,000 --> 0:11:3,000
actually achieve what was not no longer

308
0:11:28.38,000 --> 0:11:32,000
achievable and operational cost and that

309
0:11:30.899,000 --> 0:11:33,000
means that the artistic director now has

310
0:11:32.519,000 --> 0:11:36,000
a pallet that he or she can

311
0:11:34.499,000 --> 0:11:38,000
choose from between a series of forms in

312
0:11:37.109,000 --> 0:11:4,000
a series of processions because that

313
0:11:38.939,000 --> 0:11:41,000
enclosure around the theater that is

314
0:11:40.649,000 --> 0:11:43,000
normally trapped with front of house and

315
0:11:42.269,000 --> 0:11:46,000
back of house spaces has been liberated

316
0:11:43.819,000 --> 0:11:47,000
so an artistic director has the ability

317
0:11:46.349,000 --> 0:11:5,000
to show have a performance that enters

318
0:11:48.509,000 --> 0:11:52,000
into vogner aryan procession shows the

319
0:11:50.789,000 --> 0:11:55,000
first act and thrusts the intermission

320
0:11:53.069,000 --> 0:11:58,000
in a Greek procession second act in

321
0:11:56.339,000 --> 0:11:59,000
arena and so forth so I'm going to show

322
0:11:58.559,000 --> 0:12:02,000
you what what this actually means this

323
0:12:00.299,000 --> 0:12:04,000
is the theater up close any portion

324
0:12:02.819,000 --> 0:12:08,000
around the theater actually can be open

325
0:12:04.349,000 --> 0:12:1,000
discreetly the light enclosure can be

326
0:12:08.909,000 --> 0:12:11,000
lifted separate so you can cuckoo stick

327
0:12:10.619,000 --> 0:12:14,000
enclosure so you can do Beckett with

328
0:12:12.119,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Dallas as the backdrop fortunes can be

329
0:12:15.509,000 --> 0:12:18,000
open so you can now actually have

330
0:12:16.859,000 --> 0:12:19,000
motorcycles drive directly into the

331
0:12:19.409,000 --> 0:12:21,000
performance or you can even just have an

332
0:12:20.819,000 --> 0:12:24,000
open air performance or for

333
0:12:22.109,000 --> 0:12:26,000
intermissions the balcony is all moved

334
0:12:24.929,000 --> 0:12:28,000
goes between those configurations but

335
0:12:26.369,000 --> 0:12:31,000
they also disappear the proscenium line

336
0:12:28.979,000 --> 0:12:32,000
can also disappear you can bring

337
0:12:31.379,000 --> 0:12:34,000
enormous objects in so in fact there the

338
0:12:33.629,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Dallas Theater Company the first show

339
0:12:34.859,000 --> 0:12:38,000
will be played by Charles Lindbergh and

340
0:12:37.409,000 --> 0:12:4,000
they'll want to bring in real aircraft

341
0:12:39.059,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and then it also provides them in the

342
0:12:41.189,000 --> 0:12:46,000
offseason the ability to actually rent

343
0:12:45.629,000 --> 0:12:49,000
out this space for entirely different

344
0:12:46.739,000 --> 0:12:54,000
things this is it at night oh sorry

345
0:12:50.159,000 --> 0:12:56,000
from a distance open up entire portions

346
0:12:54.839,000 --> 0:12:59,000
for different kinds of events and at

347
0:12:56.909,000 --> 0:13:01,000
night again

348
0:13:00.419,000 --> 0:13:04,000
remove the light enclosure keep the

349
0:13:02.819,000 --> 0:13:06,000
acoustic enclosure this is a monster

350
0:13:05.22,000 --> 0:13:09,000
truck show I'm going to show now the

351
0:13:07.079,000 --> 0:13:11,000
last project this also is an unusual

352
0:13:09.299,000 --> 0:13:12,000
client they inverted the whole idea of

353
0:13:11.309,000 --> 0:13:14,000
development they came to us and they

354
0:13:12.989,000 --> 0:13:16,000
said unlike normal developers and they

355
0:13:15.059,000 --> 0:13:19,000
said we want to start out by providing a

356
0:13:17.129,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Contemporary Art Museum in Louisville

357
0:13:19.349,000 --> 0:13:22,000
that's our main goal and so instead of

358
0:13:21.149,000 --> 0:13:24,000
being a developer that sees an

359
0:13:22.739,000 --> 0:13:25,000
opportunity to make money they saw a

360
0:13:24.509,000 --> 0:13:28,000
ability to be a catalyst in their

361
0:13:26.249,000 --> 0:13:3,000
downtown and the fact that they wanted

362
0:13:29.189,000 --> 0:13:32,000
to support the Contemporary Art Museum

363
0:13:30.479,000 --> 0:13:35,000
actually built the pro forma so they

364
0:13:32.249,000 --> 0:13:37,000
worked in Reverse and that Performa led

365
0:13:35.489,000 --> 0:13:39,000
us to a mixed-use building that was very

366
0:13:38.129,000 --> 0:13:41,000
large in order to support their

367
0:13:39.749,000 --> 0:13:42,000
aspirations of the art but it also

368
0:13:41.219,000 --> 0:13:44,000
opened up opportunities for the art

369
0:13:42.749,000 --> 0:13:45,000
itself to collaborate interact with

370
0:13:44.549,000 --> 0:13:46,000
commercial spaces that actually artists

371
0:13:46.439,000 --> 0:13:5,000
more and more

372
0:13:47.19,000 --> 0:13:51,000
to work within and it also charged us

373
0:13:50.49,000 --> 0:13:52,000
with thinking about how to have

374
0:13:51.72,000 --> 0:13:55,000
something that was both a single

375
0:13:53.28,000 --> 0:13:57,000
building and a credible sort of sub

376
0:13:55.77,000 --> 0:13:58,000
buildings so I'm gonna this is

377
0:13:57.39,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Louisville's skyline and I'm going to

378
0:13:59.13,000 --> 0:14:02,000
take you through the various constraints

379
0:14:01.59,000 --> 0:14:04,000
that led to the project first the

380
0:14:03,000 --> 0:14:07,000
physical constraints we actually had to

381
0:14:04.89,000 --> 0:14:08,000
operate on three discrete sites all of

382
0:14:07.59,000 --> 0:14:1,000
them well well smaller than the size of

383
0:14:09.24,000 --> 0:14:12,000
the building we had operate next to the

384
0:14:10.92,000 --> 0:14:14,000
new Muhammad Ali's Center and respected

385
0:14:13.11,000 --> 0:14:16,000
we had to operate within the hundred

386
0:14:15.12,000 --> 0:14:18,000
year flood plain now this area floods

387
0:14:16.95,000 --> 0:14:19,000
three to four times a year and there's a

388
0:14:18.87,000 --> 0:14:22,000
levee behind our site similar to the

389
0:14:20.61,000 --> 0:14:25,000
ones that broke in New Orleans have to

390
0:14:23.7,000 --> 0:14:28,000
operate in the high into the i-64

391
0:14:25.71,000 --> 0:14:29,000
corridor a street that cuts through the

392
0:14:28.86,000 --> 0:14:31,000
middle of these separate sites so these

393
0:14:30.66,000 --> 0:14:33,000
were starting to build a sort of

394
0:14:32.06,000 --> 0:14:37,000
nightmare of constraints in a bathtub

395
0:14:34.64,000 --> 0:14:39,000
underneath the bathtub are the city's

396
0:14:37.23,000 --> 0:14:41,000
main power lines and there was a

397
0:14:39.87,000 --> 0:14:42,000
pedestrian corridor that they wanted to

398
0:14:41.94,000 --> 0:14:45,000
add that would link a series of cultural

399
0:14:43.71,000 --> 0:14:46,000
buildings and a view corridor because

400
0:14:46.41,000 --> 0:14:48,000
this is the historic district that they

401
0:14:47.67,000 --> 0:14:52,000
didn't want to obstruct with the new

402
0:14:48.87,000 --> 0:14:54,000
building and now we're going to add 1.1

403
0:14:52.89,000 --> 0:14:56,000
million square feet and if we did the

404
0:14:55.5,000 --> 0:14:58,000
traditional thing that 1.1 million

405
0:14:56.94,000 --> 0:14:59,000
square feet these are the different

406
0:14:58.62,000 --> 0:15:02,000
programs traditional thing would be to

407
0:15:00.39,000 --> 0:15:03,000
identify the public elements place them

408
0:15:02.76,000 --> 0:15:05,000
on sites and now we'd have a really

409
0:15:04.23,000 --> 0:15:09,000
terrible situation a public thing in the

410
0:15:06.27,000 --> 0:15:12,000
middle of a bathtub that floods and then

411
0:15:09.93,000 --> 0:15:13,000
we would size all the other elements the

412
0:15:12.6,000 --> 0:15:15,000
different commercial elements Hotel

413
0:15:14.28,000 --> 0:15:17,000
luxury housing office and so forth and

414
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
dump it on top and we would create

415
0:15:17.97,000 --> 0:15:26,000
something that was unveiled the Time

416
0:15:22.11,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Warner building so our strategy was very

417
0:15:27.45,000 --> 0:15:32,000
simple just lift the entire block flip

418
0:15:31.08,000 --> 0:15:35,000
some the elements over reposition them

419
0:15:33.33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
so they have appropriate views and

420
0:15:35.43,000 --> 0:15:39,000
relationships to downtown and make

421
0:15:37.38,000 --> 0:15:41,000
circulation connections and reroute the

422
0:15:39.72,000 --> 0:15:45,000
road so that's the basic concept now I'm

423
0:15:42.36,000 --> 0:15:47,000
going to show you what it leads to okay

424
0:15:45.81,000 --> 0:15:49,000
seems very formal willful gesture that

425
0:15:48.089,000 --> 0:15:51,000
something derive entirely out of the

426
0:15:49.83,000 --> 0:15:52,000
constraints and again when we unveiled

427
0:15:51.54,000 --> 0:15:53,000
it there was sort of nervousness that

428
0:15:52.95,000 --> 0:15:55,000
this was about an architect making a

429
0:15:54.45,000 --> 0:15:58,000
statement not an architect was

430
0:15:56.339,000 --> 0:16:02,000
attempting to solve a series of problems

431
0:15:59.06,000 --> 0:16:03,000
now within that Center zone as I said we

432
0:16:02.339,000 --> 0:16:05,000
have the ability to mix a series of

433
0:16:03.93,000 --> 0:16:06,000
things so here you can see that these

434
0:16:05.61,000 --> 0:16:08,000
are the this sort of an x-ray that the

435
0:16:07.62,000 --> 0:16:1,000
towers a totally developer driven they

436
0:16:09.18,000 --> 0:16:12,000
told us that dimensions the sizes and so

437
0:16:10.889,000 --> 0:16:13,000
forth and we focused on taking all the

438
0:16:12.6,000 --> 0:16:16,000
public components the lobbies the bars

439
0:16:14.72,000 --> 0:16:17,000
everything that the different component

440
0:16:16.98,000 --> 0:16:18,000
of different commercial elements would

441
0:16:18.18,000 --> 0:16:22,000
have and combined it in the center in

442
0:16:19.649,000 --> 0:16:22,000
this sort of subway map in the transfer

443
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
zone that it would also include the

444
0:16:23.519,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Contemporary Art Museum that creates a

445
0:16:26.04,000 --> 0:16:31,000
situation like this we have artists who

446
0:16:27.959,000 --> 0:16:31,000
can operate within an art space that

447
0:16:31.23,000 --> 0:16:34,000
also has an amazing view on the 22nd

448
0:16:32.94,000 --> 0:16:36,000
floor but it also has proximity that the

449
0:16:34.98,000 --> 0:16:38,000
curator can either open or close it

450
0:16:37.079,000 --> 0:16:41,000
allows people on exercise bicycles to be

451
0:16:39.66,000 --> 0:16:43,000
seen or to see the art and so forth it

452
0:16:42,000 --> 0:16:45,000
also means if an artist wants to invade

453
0:16:43.68,000 --> 0:16:45,000
something like a swimming pool they can

454
0:16:45.12,000 --> 0:16:46,000
begin to do the exhibition in the

455
0:16:46.29,000 --> 0:16:48,000
swimming pool

456
0:16:46.829,000 --> 0:16:5,000
so not forced to always work within the

457
0:16:48.6,000 --> 0:16:53,000
confines of a contemporary gallery space

458
0:16:51.56,000 --> 0:16:57,000
so how to build this it's very simple

459
0:16:54.54,000 --> 0:16:59,000
it's a chair so we begin by building the

460
0:16:58.139,000 --> 0:17:01,000
cores as we're building the cores we

461
0:17:00.24,000 --> 0:17:03,000
build the Contemporary Art Museum at

462
0:17:01.56,000 --> 0:17:04,000
grade that allows us to have incredible

463
0:17:03.69,000 --> 0:17:07,000
efficiency and cost efficiency this is

464
0:17:05.37,000 --> 0:17:09,000
not a high budget building at the moment

465
0:17:07.799,000 --> 0:17:1,000
the course gets a mid-level we finished

466
0:17:09.48,000 --> 0:17:11,000
the art museum we put all the mechanical

467
0:17:10.919,000 --> 0:17:12,000
equipment in it and then we jack it up

468
0:17:12.179,000 --> 0:17:15,000
into the air this is how they build

469
0:17:13.62,000 --> 0:17:16,000
really large aircraft hangars for

470
0:17:15.27,000 --> 0:17:2,000
instance the ones that they did for the

471
0:17:16.919,000 --> 0:17:21,000
a380 finish the course finish the meat

472
0:17:20.37,000 --> 0:17:24,000
you get something that looks like this I

473
0:17:22.62,000 --> 0:17:26,000
only have about 30 seconds so I want to

474
0:17:24.569,000 --> 0:17:29,000
start an animation and we'll conclude

475
0:17:27.36,000 --> 0:17:29,000
with that

476
0:17:32.9,000 --> 0:17:37,000
first asked me to add the theater is

477
0:17:36.33,000 --> 0:17:39,000
under construction and this project will

478
0:17:38.4,000 --> 0:17:42,000
start construction in about a year and

479
0:17:40.11,000 --> 0:17:43,000
finish in 2010

480
0:20:10.63,000 --> 0:20:14,000
what if great ideas weren't cherished

481
0:20:15.79,000 --> 0:20:29,000
what if they carried no importance or

482
0:20:21.89,000 --> 0:20:31,000
held no value there is a place where

483
0:20:30.11,000 --> 0:20:34,000
artistic vision is protected where

484
0:20:32.18,000 --> 0:20:38,000
inspired design ideas live on to become

485
0:20:34.99,000 --> 0:20:37,000
ultimate driving machines

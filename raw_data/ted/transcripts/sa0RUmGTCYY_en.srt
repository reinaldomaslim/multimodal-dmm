2
0:00:17.029,000 --> 0:00:2,000
So, why does good sex so often fade,

3
0:00:20.132,000 --> 0:00:23,000
even for couples who continue to love each other as much as ever?

4
0:00:24.986,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And why does good intimacy not guarantee good sex,

5
0:00:27.79,000 --> 0:00:28,000
contrary to popular belief?

6
0:00:30.963,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Or, the next question would be,

7
0:00:32.615,000 --> 0:00:34,000
can we want what we already have?

8
0:00:35.188,000 --> 0:00:37,000
That's the million-dollar question, right?

9
0:00:37.901,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And why is the forbidden so erotic?

10
0:00:39.614,000 --> 0:00:42,000
What is it about transgression that makes desire so potent?

11
0:00:43.913,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And why does sex make babies,

12
0:00:45.362,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and babies spell erotic disaster in couples?

13
0:00:47.996,000 --> 0:00:48,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:49.627,000 --> 0:00:51,000
It's kind of the fatal erotic blow, isn't it?

15
0:00:52.274,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And when you love, how does it feel?

16
0:00:54.611,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And when you desire, how is it different?

17
0:00:57.885,000 --> 0:00:58,000
These are some of the questions

18
0:00:59.432,000 --> 0:01:04,000
that are at the center of my exploration on the nature of erotic desire

19
0:01:04.922,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and its concomitant dilemmas in modern love.

20
0:01:08.77,000 --> 0:01:09,000
So I travel the globe,

21
0:01:10.344,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and what I'm noticing is that everywhere where romanticism has entered,

22
0:01:15.727,000 --> 0:01:17,000
there seems to be a crisis of desire.

23
0:01:18.9,000 --> 0:01:22,000
A crisis of desire, as in owning the wanting --

24
0:01:23.42,000 --> 0:01:25,000
desire as an expression of our individuality,

25
0:01:26.43,000 --> 0:01:29,000
of our free choice, of our preferences, of our identity --

26
0:01:30.419,000 --> 0:01:33,000
desire that has become a central concept

27
0:01:33.745,000 --> 0:01:36,000
as part of modern love and individualistic societies.

28
0:01:36.969,000 --> 0:01:39,000
You know, this is the first time in the history of humankind

29
0:01:40.21,000 --> 0:01:46,000
where we are trying to experience sexuality in the long term

30
0:01:46.64,000 --> 0:01:49,000
not because we want 14 children,

31
0:01:50.026,000 --> 0:01:54,000
for which we need to have even more because many of them won't make it,

32
0:01:54.222,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and not because it is exclusively a woman's marital duty.

33
0:01:58.391,000 --> 0:02:02,000
This is the first time that we want sex over time

34
0:02:03.19,000 --> 0:02:06,000
about pleasure and connection that is rooted in desire.

35
0:02:07.69,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So what sustains desire, and why is it so difficult?

36
0:02:11.515,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And at the heart of sustaining desire in a committed relationship,

37
0:02:16.347,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I think, is the reconciliation of two fundamental human needs.

38
0:02:21.954,000 --> 0:02:26,000
On the one hand, our need for security, for predictability,

39
0:02:27.116,000 --> 0:02:3,000
for safety, for dependability,

40
0:02:31.035,000 --> 0:02:34,000
for reliability, for permanence.

41
0:02:34.508,000 --> 0:02:37,000
All these anchoring, grounding experiences of our lives

42
0:02:37.626,000 --> 0:02:38,000
that we call home.

43
0:02:39.596,000 --> 0:02:43,000
But we also have an equally strong need -- men and women --

44
0:02:43.728,000 --> 0:02:45,000
for adventure, for novelty,

45
0:02:46.177,000 --> 0:02:49,000
for mystery, for risk, for danger,

46
0:02:49.312,000 --> 0:02:52,000
for the unknown, for the unexpected, surprise --

47
0:02:52.602,000 --> 0:02:53,000
you get the gist.

48
0:02:54.533,000 --> 0:02:55,000
For journey, for travel.

49
0:02:56.508,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So reconciling our need for security and our need for adventure

50
0:03:00.057,000 --> 0:03:01,000
into one relationship,

51
0:03:01.631,000 --> 0:03:03,000
or what we today like to call a passionate marriage,

52
0:03:04.514,000 --> 0:03:06,000
used to be a contradiction in terms.

53
0:03:07.208,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Marriage was an economic institution

54
0:03:10.51,000 --> 0:03:13,000
in which you were given a partnership for life

55
0:03:13.572,000 --> 0:03:15,000
in terms of children and social status

56
0:03:16.316,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and succession and companionship.

57
0:03:19.123,000 --> 0:03:23,000
But now we want our partner to still give us all these things,

58
0:03:23.152,000 --> 0:03:25,000
but in addition I want you to be my best friend

59
0:03:25.604,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and my trusted confidant and my passionate lover to boot,

60
0:03:28.838,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and we live twice as long.

61
0:03:30.242,000 --> 0:03:32,000
(Laughter)

62
0:03:33.162,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So we come to one person, and we basically are asking them

63
0:03:37.166,000 --> 0:03:39,000
to give us what once an entire village used to provide.

64
0:03:40.789,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Give me belonging, give me identity,

65
0:03:43.394,000 --> 0:03:44,000
give me continuity,

66
0:03:44.733,000 --> 0:03:47,000
but give me transcendence and mystery and awe all in one.

67
0:03:48.79,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Give me comfort, give me edge.

68
0:03:50.423,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Give me novelty, give me familiarity.

69
0:03:52.345,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Give me predictability, give me surprise.

70
0:03:54.635,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And we think it's a given,

71
0:03:56.008,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and toys and lingerie are going to save us with that.

72
0:03:58.633,000 --> 0:03:59,000
(Laughter)

73
0:04:00.558,000 --> 0:04:03,000
(Applause)

74
0:04:04.527,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So now we get to the existential reality of the story, right?

75
0:04:08.71,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Because I think, in some way --

76
0:04:12.442,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and I'll come back to that --

77
0:04:14.123,000 --> 0:04:17,000
but the crisis of desire is often a crisis of the imagination.

78
0:04:17.574,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So why does good sex so often fade?

79
0:04:21.197,000 --> 0:04:23,000
What is the relationship between love and desire?

80
0:04:23.745,000 --> 0:04:25,000
How do they relate, and how do they conflict?

81
0:04:27.026,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Because therein lies the mystery of eroticism.

82
0:04:30.082,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So if there is a verb, for me, that comes with love, it's "to have."

83
0:04:34.353,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And if there is a verb that comes with desire, it is "to want."

84
0:04:38.726,000 --> 0:04:41,000
In love, we want to have, we want to know the beloved.

85
0:04:42.527,000 --> 0:04:44,000
We want to minimize the distance.

86
0:04:44.833,000 --> 0:04:45,000
We want to contract that gap.

87
0:04:46.813,000 --> 0:04:48,000
We want to neutralize the tensions.

88
0:04:49.109,000 --> 0:04:5,000
We want closeness.

89
0:04:51.031,000 --> 0:04:52,000
But in desire,

90
0:04:52.451,000 --> 0:04:55,000
we tend to not really want to go back to the places we've already gone.

91
0:04:56.266,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Forgone conclusion does not keep our interest.

92
0:04:59.92,000 --> 0:05:01,000
In desire, we want an Other,

93
0:05:02.149,000 --> 0:05:05,000
somebody on the other side that we can go visit,

94
0:05:05.198,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that we can go spend some time with,

95
0:05:07.38,000 --> 0:05:1,000
that we can go see what goes on in their red-light district.

96
0:05:11.135,000 --> 0:05:12,000
You know?

97
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
In desire, we want a bridge to cross.

98
0:05:14.553,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Or in other words, I sometimes say, fire needs air.

99
0:05:17.928,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Desire needs space.

100
0:05:20.249,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And when it's said like that, it's often quite abstract.

101
0:05:23.727,000 --> 0:05:24,000
But then I took a question with me.

102
0:05:25.418,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And I've gone to more than 20 countries in the last few years

103
0:05:28.347,000 --> 0:05:3,000
with "Mating in Captivity," and I asked people,

104
0:05:30.735,000 --> 0:05:33,000
when do you find yourself most drawn to your partner?

105
0:05:33.891,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Not attracted sexually, per Se, but most drawn.

106
0:05:37.353,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And across culture, across religion, and across gender -- except for one --

107
0:05:41.788,000 --> 0:05:44,000
there are a few answers that just keep coming back.

108
0:05:46.103,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So the first group is:

109
0:05:47.96,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I am most drawn to my partner when she is away,

110
0:05:53.175,000 --> 0:05:56,000
when we are apart, when we reunite.

111
0:05:57.317,000 --> 0:06:,000
Basically, when I get back in touch

112
0:06:00.777,000 --> 0:06:03,000
with my ability to imagine myself with my partner,

113
0:06:04.488,000 --> 0:06:07,000
when my imagination comes back in the picture,

114
0:06:07.57,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and when I can root it in absence and in longing,

115
0:06:12.234,000 --> 0:06:14,000
which is a major component of desire.

116
0:06:14.995,000 --> 0:06:17,000
But then the second group is even more interesting.

117
0:06:18.182,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I am most drawn to my partner

118
0:06:19.867,000 --> 0:06:21,000
when I see him in the studio,

119
0:06:22.413,000 --> 0:06:23,000
when she is onstage,

120
0:06:23.984,000 --> 0:06:24,000
when he is in his element,

121
0:06:25.684,000 --> 0:06:27,000
when she's doing something she's passionate about,

122
0:06:28.222,000 --> 0:06:31,000
when I see him at a party and other people are really drawn to him,

123
0:06:31.627,000 --> 0:06:32,000
when I see her hold court.

124
0:06:33.881,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Basically, when I look at my partner radiant and confident.

125
0:06:38.279,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Probably the biggest turn-on across the board.

126
0:06:41.552,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Radiant, as in self-sustaining.

127
0:06:44.213,000 --> 0:06:46,000
I look at this person -- by the way, in desire

128
0:06:47.23,000 --> 0:06:49,000
people rarely talk about it, when we are blended into one,

129
0:06:50.007,000 --> 0:06:51,000
five centimeters from each other.

130
0:06:51.651,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I don't know in inches how much that is.

131
0:06:53.586,000 --> 0:06:55,000
But it's also not when the other person is that far apart

132
0:06:56.501,000 --> 0:06:57,000
that you no longer see them.

133
0:06:58.261,000 --> 0:07:02,000
It's when I'm looking at my partner from a comfortable distance,

134
0:07:02.285,000 --> 0:07:06,000
where this person that is already so familiar, so known,

135
0:07:06.634,000 --> 0:07:1,000
is momentarily once again somewhat mysterious, somewhat elusive.

136
0:07:11.582,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And in this space between me and the other lies the erotic élan,

137
0:07:16.328,000 --> 0:07:18,000
lies that movement toward the other.

138
0:07:18.921,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Because sometimes, as Proust says,

139
0:07:21.084,000 --> 0:07:23,000
mystery is not about traveling to new places,

140
0:07:23.759,000 --> 0:07:25,000
but it's about looking with new eyes.

141
0:07:25.938,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And so, when I see my partner on his own or her own,

142
0:07:29.791,000 --> 0:07:31,000
doing something in which they are enveloped,

143
0:07:32.624,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I look at this person and I momentarily get a shift in perception,

144
0:07:37.039,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and I stay open to the mysteries that are living right next to me.

145
0:07:42.311,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And then, more importantly, in this description about the other

146
0:07:47.055,000 --> 0:07:48,000
or myself -- it's the same --

147
0:07:48.905,000 --> 0:07:52,000
what is most interesting is that there is no neediness in desire.

148
0:07:52.986,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Nobody needs anybody.

149
0:07:55.314,000 --> 0:07:57,000
There is no caretaking in desire.

150
0:07:57.796,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Caretaking is mightily loving.

151
0:07:59.964,000 --> 0:08:,000
It's a powerful anti-aphrodisiac.

152
0:08:01.692,000 --> 0:08:02,000
(Laughter)

153
0:08:02.717,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I have yet to see somebody who is so turned on

154
0:08:05.07,000 --> 0:08:06,000
by somebody who needs them.

155
0:08:06.772,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Wanting them is one thing.

156
0:08:08.512,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Needing them is a shot down

157
0:08:10.265,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and women have known that forever,

158
0:08:12.166,000 --> 0:08:14,000
because anything that will bring up parenthood

159
0:08:14.773,000 --> 0:08:16,000
will usually decrease the erotic charge.

160
0:08:17.136,000 --> 0:08:18,000
(Laughter)

161
0:08:18.373,000 --> 0:08:19,000
For good reasons, right?

162
0:08:20.113,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And then the third group of answers usually would be:

163
0:08:23.366,000 --> 0:08:27,000
when I'm surprised, when we laugh together,

164
0:08:27.786,000 --> 0:08:29,000
as somebody said to me in the office today,

165
0:08:30.071,000 --> 0:08:32,000
when he's in his tux, so I said, you know,

166
0:08:32.095,000 --> 0:08:35,000
it's either the tux or the cowboy boots.

167
0:08:35.227,000 --> 0:08:38,000
But basically it's when there is novelty.

168
0:08:38.633,000 --> 0:08:4,000
But novelty isn't about new positions.

169
0:08:41.469,000 --> 0:08:42,000
It isn't a repertoire of techniques.

170
0:08:43.424,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Novelty is, what parts of you do you bring out?

171
0:08:46.669,000 --> 0:08:48,000
What parts of you are just being seen?

172
0:08:49.475,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Because in some way one could say sex isn't something you do, eh?

173
0:08:53.417,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Sex is a place you go.

174
0:08:55.142,000 --> 0:08:56,000
It's a space you enter

175
0:08:56.651,000 --> 0:08:59,000
inside yourself and with another, or others.

176
0:09:00.197,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So where do you go in sex?

177
0:09:02.395,000 --> 0:09:04,000
What parts of you do you connect to?

178
0:09:04.871,000 --> 0:09:06,000
What do you seek to express there?

179
0:09:07.07,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Is it a place for transcendence and spiritual union?

180
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Is it a place for naughtiness and is it a place to be safely aggressive?

181
0:09:14.587,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Is it a place where you can finally surrender

182
0:09:16.931,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and not have to take responsibility for everything?

183
0:09:20.099,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Is it a place where you can express your infantile wishes?

184
0:09:23.075,000 --> 0:09:25,000
What comes out there? It's a language.

185
0:09:25.355,000 --> 0:09:27,000
It isn't just a behavior.

186
0:09:27.781,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And it's the poetic of that language that I'm interested in,

187
0:09:30.667,000 --> 0:09:33,000
which is why I began to explore this concept of erotic intelligence.

188
0:09:34.786,000 --> 0:09:35,000
You know, animals have sex.

189
0:09:36.826,000 --> 0:09:39,000
It's the pivot, it's biology, it's the natural instinct.

190
0:09:40.36,000 --> 0:09:43,000
We are the only ones who have an erotic life,

191
0:09:43.614,000 --> 0:09:48,000
which means that it's sexuality transformed by the human imagination.

192
0:09:49.716,000 --> 0:09:52,000
We are the only ones who can make love for hours,

193
0:09:53.026,000 --> 0:09:55,000
have a blissful time, multiple orgasms,

194
0:09:55.898,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and touch nobody, just because we can imagine it.

195
0:09:59.833,000 --> 0:10:01,000
We can hint at it. We don't even have to do it.

196
0:10:02.651,000 --> 0:10:05,000
We can experience that powerful thing called anticipation,

197
0:10:06.145,000 --> 0:10:08,000
which is a mortar to desire.

198
0:10:08.593,000 --> 0:10:11,000
The ability to imagine it, as if it's happening,

199
0:10:12.236,000 --> 0:10:14,000
to experience it as if it's happening,

200
0:10:14.634,000 --> 0:10:15,000
while nothing is happening

201
0:10:16.144,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and everything is happening, at the same time.

202
0:10:18.829,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So when I began to think about eroticism,

203
0:10:21.359,000 --> 0:10:23,000
I began to think about the poetics of sex.

204
0:10:24.708,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And if I look at it as an intelligence,

205
0:10:27.04,000 --> 0:10:29,000
then it's something that you cultivate.

206
0:10:29.237,000 --> 0:10:3,000
What are the ingredients?

207
0:10:30.809,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Imagination, playfulness,

208
0:10:33.48,000 --> 0:10:36,000
novelty, curiosity, mystery.

209
0:10:37.044,000 --> 0:10:41,000
But the central agent is really that piece called the imagination.

210
0:10:41.827,000 --> 0:10:44,000
But more importantly, for me to begin to understand

211
0:10:44.986,000 --> 0:10:46,000
who are the couples who have an erotic spark,

212
0:10:47.582,000 --> 0:10:48,000
what sustains desire,

213
0:10:49.408,000 --> 0:10:52,000
I had to go back to the original definition of eroticism,

214
0:10:52.822,000 --> 0:10:53,000
the mystical definition,

215
0:10:54.679,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and I went through it through a bifurcation

216
0:10:56.79,000 --> 0:10:58,000
by looking, actually, at trauma,

217
0:10:58.912,000 --> 0:10:59,000
which is the other side.

218
0:11:00.703,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And I looked at it,

219
0:11:01.928,000 --> 0:11:03,000
looking at the community that I had grown up in,

220
0:11:04.282,000 --> 0:11:07,000
which was a community in Belgium, all Holocaust survivors,

221
0:11:08.12,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and in my community, there were two groups:

222
0:11:10.75,000 --> 0:11:13,000
those who didn't die, and those who came back to life.

223
0:11:14.676,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And those who didn't die lived often very tethered to the ground,

224
0:11:17.961,000 --> 0:11:2,000
could not experience pleasure, could not trust,

225
0:11:21.476,000 --> 0:11:25,000
because when you're vigilant, worried, anxious, and insecure,

226
0:11:25.501,000 --> 0:11:28,000
you can't lift your head to go and take off in space

227
0:11:29.064,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and be playful and safe and imaginative.

228
0:11:32.498,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Those who came back to life

229
0:11:34.315,000 --> 0:11:37,000
were those who understood the erotic as an antidote to death.

230
0:11:37.625,000 --> 0:11:39,000
They knew how to keep themselves alive.

231
0:11:41.201,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And when I began to listen

232
0:11:42.775,000 --> 0:11:44,000
to the sexlessness of the couples that I work with,

233
0:11:45.305,000 --> 0:11:47,000
I sometimes would hear people say, "I want more sex,"

234
0:11:48.273,000 --> 0:11:5,000
but generally, people want better sex,

235
0:11:50.826,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and better is to reconnect with that quality of aliveness,

236
0:11:54.08,000 --> 0:11:56,000
of vibrancy, of renewal, of vitality,

237
0:11:56.883,000 --> 0:11:57,000
of Eros, of energy

238
0:11:58.508,000 --> 0:11:59,000
that sex used to afford them,

239
0:12:00.203,000 --> 0:12:02,000
or that they've hoped it would afford them.

240
0:12:02.901,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And so I began to ask a different question.

241
0:12:06.171,000 --> 0:12:1,000
"I shut myself off when ..." began to be the question.

242
0:12:10.551,000 --> 0:12:11,000
"I turn off my desires when ..."

243
0:12:12.565,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Which is not the same question as,

244
0:12:14.258,000 --> 0:12:17,000
"What turns me off is ..." and "You turn me off when ..."

245
0:12:18.111,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And people began to say, "I turn myself off when

246
0:12:21.292,000 --> 0:12:23,000
I feel dead inside, when I don't like my body,

247
0:12:24.197,000 --> 0:12:25,000
when I feel old,

248
0:12:25.466,000 --> 0:12:26,000
when I haven't had time for myself,

249
0:12:27.213,000 --> 0:12:29,000
when I haven't had a chance to even check in with you,

250
0:12:29.837,000 --> 0:12:3,000
when I don't perform well at work,

251
0:12:31.581,000 --> 0:12:32,000
when I feel low self esteem,

252
0:12:33.03,000 --> 0:12:34,000
when I don't have a sense of self-worth,

253
0:12:35.021,000 --> 0:12:37,000
when I don't feel like I have a right to want, to take,

254
0:12:37.9,000 --> 0:12:38,000
to receive pleasure."

255
0:12:40.424,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And then I began to ask the reverse question.

256
0:12:42.59,000 --> 0:12:43,000
"I turn myself on when ..."

257
0:12:44.424,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Because most of the time, people like to ask the question,

258
0:12:47.249,000 --> 0:12:49,000
"You turn me on, what turns me on,"

259
0:12:49.459,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and I'm out of the question, you know?

260
0:12:51.732,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Now, if you are dead inside,

261
0:12:53.363,000 --> 0:12:55,000
the other person can do a lot of things for Valentine's.

262
0:12:56.108,000 --> 0:12:58,000
It won't make a dent. There is nobody at the reception desk.

263
0:12:59.037,000 --> 0:13:,000
(Laughter)

264
0:13:00.335,000 --> 0:13:02,000
So I turn myself on when,

265
0:13:02.737,000 --> 0:13:05,000
I turn on my desires, I wake up when ...

266
0:13:06.748,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Now, in this paradox between love and desire,

267
0:13:11.366,000 --> 0:13:13,000
what seems to be so puzzling

268
0:13:13.492,000 --> 0:13:16,000
is that the very ingredients that nurture love --

269
0:13:17.385,000 --> 0:13:19,000
mutuality, reciprocity,

270
0:13:19.834,000 --> 0:13:22,000
protection, worry, responsibility for the other --

271
0:13:23.595,000 --> 0:13:26,000
are sometimes the very ingredients that stifle desire.

272
0:13:27.69,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Because desire comes with a host of feelings

273
0:13:31.782,000 --> 0:13:34,000
that are not always such favorites of love:

274
0:13:35.66,000 --> 0:13:36,000
jealousy, possessiveness,

275
0:13:37.453,000 --> 0:13:39,000
aggression, power, dominance,

276
0:13:40.025,000 --> 0:13:41,000
naughtiness, mischief.

277
0:13:41.803,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Basically most of us will get turned on at night by the very same things

278
0:13:46.115,000 --> 0:13:48,000
that we will demonstrate against during the day.

279
0:13:48.865,000 --> 0:13:51,000
You know, the erotic mind is not very politically correct.

280
0:13:52.164,000 --> 0:13:54,000
If everybody was fantasizing on a bed of roses,

281
0:13:54.82,000 --> 0:13:56,000
we wouldn't be having such interesting talks about this.

282
0:13:57.468,000 --> 0:13:58,000
(Laughter)

283
0:13:58.493,000 --> 0:14:03,000
But no, in our mind up there are a host of things going on

284
0:14:03.85,000 --> 0:14:06,000
that we don't always know how to bring to the person that we love,

285
0:14:07.017,000 --> 0:14:09,000
because we think love comes with selflessness

286
0:14:09.972,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and in fact desire comes with a certain amount of selfishness

287
0:14:13.542,000 --> 0:14:14,000
in the best sense of the word:

288
0:14:15.519,000 --> 0:14:19,000
the ability to stay connected to one's self in the presence of another.

289
0:14:20.335,000 --> 0:14:22,000
So I want to draw that little image for you,

290
0:14:22.897,000 --> 0:14:25,000
because this need to reconcile these two sets of needs,

291
0:14:26.606,000 --> 0:14:27,000
we are born with that.

292
0:14:28.15,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Our need for connection, our need for separateness,

293
0:14:31.046,000 --> 0:14:33,000
or our need for security and adventure,

294
0:14:33.255,000 --> 0:14:35,000
or our need for togetherness and for autonomy,

295
0:14:36.109,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and if you think about the little kid who sits on your lap

296
0:14:39.284,000 --> 0:14:42,000
and who is cozily nested here and very secure and comfortable,

297
0:14:43.187,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and at some point all of us need to go out into the world

298
0:14:47.453,000 --> 0:14:49,000
to discover and to explore.

299
0:14:49.596,000 --> 0:14:5,000
That's the beginning of desire,

300
0:14:51.454,000 --> 0:14:54,000
that exploratory need, curiosity, discovery.

301
0:14:56.454,000 --> 0:14:59,000
And then at some point they turn around and they look at you.

302
0:15:00.2,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And if you tell them,

303
0:15:01.973,000 --> 0:15:02,000
"Hey kiddo, the world's a great place.

304
0:15:03.994,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Go for it. There's so much fun out there,"

305
0:15:06.143,000 --> 0:15:08,000
then they can turn away and they can experience

306
0:15:08.693,000 --> 0:15:1,000
connection and separateness at the same time.

307
0:15:10.898,000 --> 0:15:13,000
They can go off in their imagination, off in their body,

308
0:15:14.712,000 --> 0:15:15,000
off in their playfulness,

309
0:15:16.364,000 --> 0:15:19,000
all the while knowing that there's somebody when they come back.

310
0:15:19.879,000 --> 0:15:21,000
But if on this side there is somebody who says,

311
0:15:22.316,000 --> 0:15:25,000
"I'm worried. I'm anxious. I'm depressed.

312
0:15:25.896,000 --> 0:15:27,000
My partner hasn't taken care of me in so long.

313
0:15:28.175,000 --> 0:15:29,000
What's so good out there?

314
0:15:29.547,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Don't we have everything you need together, you and I?"

315
0:15:32.693,000 --> 0:15:34,000
then there are a few little reactions

316
0:15:34.806,000 --> 0:15:37,000
that all of us can pretty much recognize.

317
0:15:38.219,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Some of us will come back,

318
0:15:41.149,000 --> 0:15:42,000
came back a long time ago,

319
0:15:42.926,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and that little child who comes back

320
0:15:45.335,000 --> 0:15:47,000
is the child who will forgo a part of himself

321
0:15:48.288,000 --> 0:15:49,000
in order not to lose the other.

322
0:15:50.431,000 --> 0:15:53,000
I will lose my freedom in order not to lose connection.

323
0:15:54.445,000 --> 0:15:56,000
And I will learn to love in a certain way

324
0:15:57.35,000 --> 0:16:,000
that will become burdened with extra worry

325
0:16:01.19,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and extra responsibility and extra protection,

326
0:16:04.734,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and I won't know how to leave you

327
0:16:07.198,000 --> 0:16:1,000
in order to go play, in order to go experience pleasure,

328
0:16:10.742,000 --> 0:16:13,000
in order to discover, to enter inside myself.

329
0:16:13.982,000 --> 0:16:15,000
Translate this into adult language.

330
0:16:16.866,000 --> 0:16:17,000
It starts very young.

331
0:16:18.379,000 --> 0:16:21,000
It continues into our sex lives up to the end.

332
0:16:22.127,000 --> 0:16:24,000
Child number two comes back

333
0:16:24.521,000 --> 0:16:27,000
but looks like that over their shoulder all the time.

334
0:16:27.587,000 --> 0:16:28,000
"Are you going to be there?

335
0:16:29.366,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Are you going to curse me, scold me?

336
0:16:31.462,000 --> 0:16:32,000
Are you going to be angry with me?"

337
0:16:33.243,000 --> 0:16:36,000
And they may be gone, but they're never really away.

338
0:16:36.862,000 --> 0:16:38,000
And those are often the people that will tell you,

339
0:16:39.267,000 --> 0:16:41,000
"In the beginning, it was super hot."

340
0:16:41.393,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Because in the beginning,

341
0:16:43.57,000 --> 0:16:46,000
the growing intimacy wasn't yet so strong

342
0:16:46.922,000 --> 0:16:48,000
that it actually led to the decrease of desire.

343
0:16:49.815,000 --> 0:16:53,000
The more connected I became, the more responsible I felt,

344
0:16:53.843,000 --> 0:16:56,000
the less I was able to let go in your presence.

345
0:16:56.966,000 --> 0:16:58,000
The third child doesn't really come back.

346
0:16:59.606,000 --> 0:17:02,000
So what happens, if you want to sustain desire,

347
0:17:03.038,000 --> 0:17:05,000
it's that real dialectic piece.

348
0:17:05.278,000 --> 0:17:08,000
On the one hand you want the security in order to be able to go.

349
0:17:08.959,000 --> 0:17:11,000
On the other hand if you can't go, you can't have pleasure,

350
0:17:12.711,000 --> 0:17:15,000
you can't culminate, you don't have an orgasm,

351
0:17:15.755,000 --> 0:17:17,000
you don't get excited because you spend your time

352
0:17:18.174,000 --> 0:17:2,000
in the body and the head of the other and not in your own.

353
0:17:21.612,000 --> 0:17:27,000
So in this dilemma about reconciling these two sets of fundamental needs,

354
0:17:27.676,000 --> 0:17:31,000
there are a few things that I've come to understand erotic couples do.

355
0:17:31.849,000 --> 0:17:33,000
One, they have a lot of sexual privacy.

356
0:17:34.826,000 --> 0:17:36,000
They understand that there is an erotic space

357
0:17:37.332,000 --> 0:17:38,000
that belongs to each of them.

358
0:17:39.383,000 --> 0:17:42,000
They also understand that foreplay is not something you do

359
0:17:42.542,000 --> 0:17:43,000
five minutes before the real thing.

360
0:17:44.75,000 --> 0:17:47,000
Foreplay pretty much starts at the end of the previous orgasm.

361
0:17:48.293,000 --> 0:17:51,000
They also understand that an erotic space isn't about,

362
0:17:51.849,000 --> 0:17:52,000
you begin to stroke the other.

363
0:17:53.404,000 --> 0:17:56,000
It's about you create a space where you leave Management Inc.,

364
0:17:56.81,000 --> 0:17:58,000
maybe where you leave the Agile program --

365
0:17:59.469,000 --> 0:18:01,000
(Laughter)

366
0:18:02.177,000 --> 0:18:06,000
And you actually just enter that place where you stop being the good citizen

367
0:18:06.453,000 --> 0:18:08,000
who is taking care of things and being responsible.

368
0:18:09.117,000 --> 0:18:12,000
Responsibility and desire just butt heads.

369
0:18:12.661,000 --> 0:18:14,000
They don't really do well together.

370
0:18:15.49,000 --> 0:18:18,000
Erotic couples also understand that passion waxes and wanes.

371
0:18:19.492,000 --> 0:18:2,000
It's pretty much like the moon.

372
0:18:21.316,000 --> 0:18:22,000
It has intermittent eclipses.

373
0:18:23.061,000 --> 0:18:25,000
But what they know is they know how to resurrect it.

374
0:18:25.684,000 --> 0:18:26,000
They know how to bring it back.

375
0:18:27.376,000 --> 0:18:28,000
And they know how to bring it back

376
0:18:29.02,000 --> 0:18:31,000
because they have demystified one big myth,

377
0:18:31.406,000 --> 0:18:33,000
which is the myth of spontaneity,

378
0:18:33.779,000 --> 0:18:35,000
which is that it's just going to fall from heaven

379
0:18:36.21,000 --> 0:18:38,000
while you're folding the laundry like a deus ex machina,

380
0:18:39.192,000 --> 0:18:4,000
and in fact they understood

381
0:18:41.161,000 --> 0:18:46,000
that whatever is going to just happen in a long-term relationship, already has.

382
0:18:46.327,000 --> 0:18:48,000
Committed sex is premeditated sex.

383
0:18:49.113,000 --> 0:18:51,000
It's willful. It's intentional.

384
0:18:52.43,000 --> 0:18:54,000
It's focus and presence.

385
0:18:55.374,000 --> 0:18:56,000
Merry Valentine's.

386
0:18:56.518,000 --> 0:18:59,000
(Applause)

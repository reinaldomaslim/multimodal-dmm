2
0:00:12.952,000 --> 0:00:13,000
As fashion designers,

3
0:00:14.794,000 --> 0:00:17,000
our decisions have the power to change our culture.

4
0:00:18.937,000 --> 0:00:22,000
We choose who is cast in our runway shows and campaigns,

5
0:00:22.99,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and ultimately, who is celebrated and considered beautiful,

6
0:00:27.053,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and who is not.

7
0:00:29.569,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Having this platform is a responsibility.

8
0:00:32.228,000 --> 0:00:34,000
One that can be utilized to exclude people

9
0:00:34.998,000 --> 0:00:35,000
or to empower others.

10
0:00:38.707,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Growing up, I was obsessed with fashion.

11
0:00:42.009,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I pored over all different types of fashion magazines

12
0:00:45.421,000 --> 0:00:46,000
at my local Barnes and Noble.

13
0:00:48.561,000 --> 0:00:52,000
To be fashionable was to be tall, skinny, with long, shiny hair.

14
0:00:53.585,000 --> 0:00:54,000
That's what I saw as the ideal,

15
0:00:55.3,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and it was reinforced everywhere I looked.

16
0:00:57.688,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And to be honest, it still is.

17
0:01:01.657,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I wanted to be like the models, so I stopped eating.

18
0:01:06.165,000 --> 0:01:07,000
It was a dark time in my life;

19
0:01:07.95,000 --> 0:01:08,000
my eating disorder consumed me.

20
0:01:09.784,000 --> 0:01:12,000
All I could think about was counting every single calorie,

21
0:01:12.895,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and waking up early before school every day

22
0:01:15.079,000 --> 0:01:16,000
so I could run a few miles.

23
0:01:16.87,000 --> 0:01:18,000
It took me years to finally release the grip

24
0:01:19.188,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that the eating disorder had over my life.

25
0:01:21.927,000 --> 0:01:22,000
But when it did,

26
0:01:23.109,000 --> 0:01:24,000
it freed up so much brain space

27
0:01:24.712,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to think about what I was truly passionate about.

28
0:01:27.363,000 --> 0:01:28,000
For so long,

29
0:01:28.553,000 --> 0:01:3,000
the fashion industry has worked hard to set an ideal of beauty

30
0:01:31.522,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that celebrates thin, young, white, cisgender,

31
0:01:34.911,000 --> 0:01:37,000
able-bodied models as the ideal.

32
0:01:38.617,000 --> 0:01:4,000
It's impossible not to be bombarded

33
0:01:40.673,000 --> 0:01:42,000
with images of models that have been photoshopped

34
0:01:43.007,000 --> 0:01:44,000
to where there's not a single pore,

35
0:01:44.705,000 --> 0:01:45,000
fat roll or stretch mark in sight.

36
0:01:46.681,000 --> 0:01:49,000
You don't need to look hard to find examples.

37
0:01:50.485,000 --> 0:01:54,000
This definition of beauty is damaging, dangerous and destructive,

38
0:01:54.978,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and we need to explode it immediately.

39
0:01:58.017,000 --> 0:02:02,000
(Applause)

40
0:02:02.616,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I'm glad you agree.

41
0:02:03.981,000 --> 0:02:04,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:05.751,000 --> 0:02:07,000
One of the worst things I've realized over the years

43
0:02:08.259,000 --> 0:02:1,000
is that my experience with disordered eating

44
0:02:10.354,000 --> 0:02:11,000
is not an anomaly.

45
0:02:11.632,000 --> 0:02:13,000
In fact, it's par for the course.

46
0:02:13.934,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I think there's a study that says 91 percent of women,

47
0:02:16.506,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and likely those of all gender identities,

48
0:02:18.982,000 --> 0:02:2,000
are unhappy with the way they look.

49
0:02:22.466,000 --> 0:02:23,000
It's unforgivable

50
0:02:23.998,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that we live in a society where it's normal or expected

51
0:02:26.919,000 --> 0:02:28,000
for teenagers to grow up hating themselves.

52
0:02:31.022,000 --> 0:02:35,000
We've been fighting for fat acceptance and women's body autonomy since the '60s.

53
0:02:35.57,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And there has been headway.

54
0:02:37.427,000 --> 0:02:39,000
We have plus-size models like Ashley Graham

55
0:02:39.832,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and musicians with body-positive messages,

56
0:02:41.871,000 --> 0:02:43,000
like Lizzo, breaking into the mainstream.

57
0:02:44.506,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Thank God.

58
0:02:45.728,000 --> 0:02:46,000
(Laughter)

59
0:02:47.974,000 --> 0:02:48,000
There's brands like Area

60
0:02:49.188,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that have released campaigns without any Photoshop retouching.

61
0:02:52.51,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But we're still inundated with unrealistic expectations.

62
0:02:56.454,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I love this quote by Lizzo, who said,

63
0:02:58.756,000 --> 0:03:02,000
"Body positivity only exists because body negativity is the norm."

64
0:03:05.668,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So how do we change the stigma around looking different

65
0:03:08.506,000 --> 0:03:11,000
or not fitting into this narrow definition of beauty?

66
0:03:12.462,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I believe it's by celebrating beauty in all different forms,

67
0:03:15.552,000 --> 0:03:17,000
bold and unapologetically.

68
0:03:18.481,000 --> 0:03:2,000
But many fashion designers continue to reinforce

69
0:03:20.758,000 --> 0:03:22,000
this narrow definition of beauty.

70
0:03:22.932,000 --> 0:03:23,000
From the way they are taught in school

71
0:03:24.831,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and into the real world,

72
0:03:26.149,000 --> 0:03:28,000
they drape on mannequins that are only size four,

73
0:03:28.815,000 --> 0:03:3,000
or sketch on bodies that are super stretched out

74
0:03:31.675,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and not anatomically proportioned.

75
0:03:33.524,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Different-size bodies aren't taken into account

76
0:03:35.838,000 --> 0:03:36,000
during the design process.

77
0:03:37.132,000 --> 0:03:38,000
They're not thought of.

78
0:03:38.778,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So who are these designers designing for?

79
0:03:42.968,000 --> 0:03:45,000
But the conversation around exclusivity in fashion

80
0:03:46.198,000 --> 0:03:48,000
doesn't begin and end with size.

81
0:03:48.404,000 --> 0:03:5,000
It's about seeing people of all different gender expressions,

82
0:03:51.412,000 --> 0:03:53,000
different ability levels, different ages,

83
0:03:54.086,000 --> 0:03:55,000
different races and ethnicities,

84
0:03:55.657,000 --> 0:03:57,000
celebrated for their own unique beauty.

85
0:03:57.776,000 --> 0:03:58,000
In my own work as a fashion designer,

86
0:03:59.577,000 --> 0:04:,000
I started a brand called Chromat,

87
0:04:01.292,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and we're committed to empowering women, femmes and nonbinary #ChromatBABES,

88
0:04:05.641,000 --> 0:04:07,000
of all shapes and sizes,

89
0:04:07.665,000 --> 0:04:09,000
through perfectly fit garments for every body.

90
0:04:10.571,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Swimwear has become a huge focus for me,

91
0:04:13.388,000 --> 0:04:15,000
because of the power that this single garment can have

92
0:04:15.944,000 --> 0:04:17,000
over the way people feel about themselves.

93
0:04:18.476,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We wanted to take our focus on celebrating all body types

94
0:04:21.915,000 --> 0:04:23,000
to a garment that's fraught with insecurity.

95
0:04:24.78,000 --> 0:04:28,000
On our runways, you see curves, cellulite and scars worn proudly.

96
0:04:29.644,000 --> 0:04:3,000
We're a runway show, yes,

97
0:04:31.538,000 --> 0:04:32,000
but we're also a celebration.

98
0:04:33.87,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I didn't start designing 10 years ago

99
0:04:36.165,000 --> 0:04:38,000
with the mission to change the entire industry.

100
0:04:38.665,000 --> 0:04:39,000
But the models we cast at the time,

101
0:04:40.442,000 --> 0:04:43,000
who just happened to be my friends who had begged to be in my shows,

102
0:04:43.855,000 --> 0:04:45,000
were so radical to some people,

103
0:04:45.911,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and, unfortunately, still are different or strange to some,

104
0:04:48.871,000 --> 0:04:5,000
that it became a huge part of what we're known for.

105
0:04:52.22,000 --> 0:04:56,000
However, inclusivity means nothing if it's only surface level.

106
0:04:58.473,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Behind the scenes,

107
0:04:59.663,000 --> 0:05:01,000
from the photographer, to the casting director,

108
0:05:01.925,000 --> 0:05:02,000
to the interns,

109
0:05:03.106,000 --> 0:05:05,000
who is making the decisions behind the scenes

110
0:05:06.005,000 --> 0:05:07,000
is just as important.

111
0:05:08.601,000 --> 0:05:11,000
It's imperative to include diverse decision-makers in the process,

112
0:05:12.368,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and it's always better to collaborate with different communities,

113
0:05:15.979,000 --> 0:05:17,000
rather than trying to speak for them.

114
0:05:19.868,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And this is an important piece of the puzzle

115
0:05:21.966,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that many young designers may not think about

116
0:05:24.101,000 --> 0:05:26,000
when they're first starting their careers,

117
0:05:26.156,000 --> 0:05:28,000
but hiring a plus-size or a transgender photographer,

118
0:05:28.664,000 --> 0:05:3,000
or a woman of color as your casting director,

119
0:05:30.807,000 --> 0:05:33,000
or a black makeup artist -- hey, Fatima Thomas --

120
0:05:33.892,000 --> 0:05:36,000
who intimately understands how important it is

121
0:05:37.22,000 --> 0:05:39,000
to be able to work with all skin tones:

122
0:05:39.434,000 --> 0:05:43,000
it's essential to creating a holistically inclusive output,

123
0:05:43.514,000 --> 0:05:44,000
like this one.

124
0:05:44.695,000 --> 0:05:46,000
As a fashion designers that do a lot of swim,

125
0:05:47.474,000 --> 0:05:5,000
we wanted to rewrite the rules around having a bikini body.

126
0:05:51.132,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So we cast a team of babe guards

127
0:05:53.331,000 --> 0:05:57,000
to enforce guidelines around inclusion and acceptance at the pool.

128
0:05:58.947,000 --> 0:06:,000
Instead of "no diving" and "no running,"

129
0:06:01.32,000 --> 0:06:03,000
how about "celebrate cellulite,"

130
0:06:03.812,000 --> 0:06:04,000
"body policing prohibited,"

131
0:06:05.395,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and "intolerance not tolerated."

132
0:06:07.474,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And this was enforced by babe guards Mama Cax, Denise Bidot,

133
0:06:11.633,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Geena Rocero, Ericka Hart and Emme,

134
0:06:15.058,000 --> 0:06:17,000
all activists in their own right.

135
0:06:17.471,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I've always felt it was important to show a range of different bodies

136
0:06:20.748,000 --> 0:06:21,000
in our runway shows and campaigns.

137
0:06:22.471,000 --> 0:06:23,000
But it actually wasn't until recently

138
0:06:24.427,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that we were able to expand our size range in a major way.

139
0:06:27.49,000 --> 0:06:28,000
We first launched our curve collection

140
0:06:29.379,000 --> 0:06:3,000
five years ago;

141
0:06:30.561,000 --> 0:06:31,000
we were so excited.

142
0:06:31.998,000 --> 0:06:33,000
But when it launched, it fell flat.

143
0:06:34.458,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Nobody was interested.

144
0:06:36.117,000 --> 0:06:39,000
None of our department stores stocked above a size large,

145
0:06:39.347,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and if they did, it was somewhere else in the building entirely.

146
0:06:42.869,000 --> 0:06:43,000
In fact, one time our sales team said,

147
0:06:44.754,000 --> 0:06:46,000
"You know, it's so cool you have trans models

148
0:06:46.901,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and curve models on the runway --

149
0:06:48.564,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I love what you're doing.

150
0:06:49.834,000 --> 0:06:51,000
But when the buyers come in to see the collection for market,

151
0:06:52.812,000 --> 0:06:53,000
they want to be sold a dream,

152
0:06:54.225,000 --> 0:06:56,000
they want to see something that they aspire to be."

153
0:06:56.911,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Implying that our models weren't that.

154
0:07:01.058,000 --> 0:07:03,000
But I've realized it's so much more important

155
0:07:03.288,000 --> 0:07:05,000
to open up this dream to more people.

156
0:07:06.527,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I want the consumer to know

157
0:07:07.852,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that it's not your body that needs to change --

158
0:07:10.466,000 --> 0:07:11,000
it's the clothes.

159
0:07:12.413,000 --> 0:07:17,000

160
0:07:18.109,000 --> 0:07:22,000
There needs to be more fashion options at all sizes and in all retailers.

161
0:07:24.546,000 --> 0:07:25,000
So finally, in 2018,

162
0:07:26.321,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Nordstrom actually placed an order up to 3X.

163
0:07:29.561,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And this was a huge game changer for us

164
0:07:31.529,000 --> 0:07:34,000
to have a major retailer invest in adding these units,

165
0:07:35.118,000 --> 0:07:37,000
so we could go to the factory --

166
0:07:37.299,000 --> 0:07:41,000
now we go up to 4X, which is about a size 32.

167
0:07:41.4,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Having that investment

168
0:07:42.733,000 --> 0:07:45,000
helped us to change and realign our entire design process.

169
0:07:46.288,000 --> 0:07:49,000
We now have different-sized bodies to sketch and drape on in the studio.

170
0:07:50.244,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And if more fashion schools taught these skills,

171
0:07:52.896,000 --> 0:07:55,000
more designers would have the ability to design for all bodies.

172
0:07:56.672,000 --> 0:08:,000
(Applause)

173
0:08:02.048,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So as fashion designers, it's our job to utilize our platform

174
0:08:07.009,000 --> 0:08:1,000
to explode this narrow and restrictive definition of beauty.

175
0:08:10.942,000 --> 0:08:11,000
My goal is that one day,

176
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
teenagers growing up don't feel the same pressure that I did to conform.

177
0:08:17.174,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And I hope that our work contributes to the fashion industry's opening up

178
0:08:20.659,000 --> 0:08:22,000
to celebrate many different identities.

179
0:08:23.358,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Thank you.

180
0:08:24.532,000 --> 0:08:28,000
(Applause and cheers)

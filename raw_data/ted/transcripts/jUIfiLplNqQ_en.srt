1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I'm here today representing a team of artists and technologists and filmmakers

2
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
that worked together on a remarkable film project for the last four years.

3
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization.

4
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
So I want to show you a clip of the film now.

5
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Hopefully it won't stutter.

6
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And if we did our jobs well, you won't know that we were even involved.

7
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Voice (Video): I don't know how it's possible ...

8
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
but you seem to have more hair.

9
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Brad Pitt: What if I told you that I wasn't getting older ...

10
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
but I was getting younger than everybody else?

11
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I was born with some form of disease.

12
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Voice: What kind of disease?

13
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
BP: I was born old.

14
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Man: I'm sorry.

15
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
BP: No need to be. There's nothing wrong with old age.

16
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Girl: Are you sick?

17
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
BP: I heard momma and Tizzy whisper,

18
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and they said I was gonna die soon.

19
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
But ... maybe not.

20
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Girl: You're different than anybody I've ever met.

21
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
BB: There were many changes ...

22
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
some you could see, some you couldn't.

23
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Hair started growing in all sorts of places,

24
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
along with other things.

25
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I felt pretty good, considering.

26
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Ed Ulbrich: That was a clip from "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."

27
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Many of you, maybe you've seen it or you've heard of the story,

28
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
but what you might not know

29
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
is that for nearly the first hour of the film,

30
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
the main character, Benjamin Button, who's played by Brad Pitt,

31
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
is completely computer-generated from the neck up.

32
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Now, there's no use of prosthetic makeup

33
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
or photography of Brad superimposed over another actor's body.

34
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
We've created a completely digital human head.

35
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So I'd like to start with a little bit of history on the project.

36
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
This is based on an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story.

37
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
It's about a man who's born old and lives his life in reverse.

38
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Now, this movie has floated around Hollywood

39
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
for well over half a century,

40
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and we first got involved with the project in the early '90s,

41
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
with Ron Howard as the director.

42
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
We took a lot of meetings and we seriously considered it.

43
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
But at the time we had to throw in the towel.

44
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
It was deemed impossible.

45
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
It was beyond the technology of the day to depict a man aging backwards.

46
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
The human form, in particular the human head,

47
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
has been considered the Holy Grail of our industry.

48
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
The project came back to us about a decade later,

49
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and this time with a director named David Fincher.

50
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Now, Fincher is an interesting guy.

51
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
David is fearless of technology,

52
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and he is absolutely tenacious.

53
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And David won't take "no."

54
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And David believed, like we do in the visual effects industry,

55
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
that anything is possible

56
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
as long as you have enough time, resources and, of course, money.

57
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And so David had an interesting take on the film,

58
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and he threw a challenge at us.

59
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
He wanted the main character of the film to be played

60
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
from the cradle to the grave by one actor.

61
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
It happened to be this guy.

62
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
We went through a process of elimination and a process of discovery

63
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
with David, and we ruled out, of course, swapping actors.

64
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
That was one idea: that we would have different actors,

65
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and we would hand off from actor to actor.

66
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
We even ruled out the idea of using makeup.

67
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
We realized that prosthetic makeup just wouldn't hold up,

68
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
particularly in close-up.

69
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And makeup is an additive process. You have to build the face up.

70
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And David wanted to carve deeply into Brad's face

71
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
to bring the aging to this character.

72
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
He needed to be a very sympathetic character.

73
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
So we decided to cast a series of little people

74
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
that would play the different bodies of Benjamin

75
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
at the different increments of his life

76
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and that we would in fact create a computer-generated version of Brad's head,

77
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
aged to appear as Benjamin,

78
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and attach that to the body of the real actor.

79
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Sounded great.

80
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Of course, this was the Holy Grail of our industry,

81
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and the fact that this guy is a global icon didn't help either,

82
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
because I'm sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store,

83
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
you know -- we see his face constantly.

84
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
So there really was no tolerable margin of error.

85
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
There were two studios involved: Warner Brothers and Paramount.

86
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And they both believed this would make an amazing film, of course,

87
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
but it was a very high-risk proposition.

88
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
There was lots of money and reputations at stake.

89
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
But we believed that we had a very solid methodology

90
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that might work ...

91
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
But despite our verbal assurances,

92
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
they wanted some proof.

93
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And so, in 2004, they commissioned us to do a screen test of Benjamin.

94
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And we did it in about five weeks.

95
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
But we used lots of cheats and shortcuts.

96
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
We basically put something together to get through the meeting.

97
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I'll roll that for you now. This was the first test for Benjamin Button.

98
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And in here, you can see, that's a computer-generated head --

99
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
pretty good -- attached to the body of an actor.

100
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And it worked. And it gave the studio great relief.

101
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
After many years of starts and stops on this project,

102
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and making that tough decision,

103
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
they finally decided to greenlight the movie.

104
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And I can remember, actually, when I got the phone call to congratulate us,

105
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
to say the movie was a go,

106
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I actually threw up.

107
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
(Laughter)

108
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
You know, this is some tough stuff.

109
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So we started to have early team meetings,

110
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and we got everybody together,

111
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and it was really more like therapy in the beginning,

112
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
convincing each other and reassuring each other that we could actually undertake this.

113
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
We had to hold up an hour of a movie with a character.

114
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And it's not a special effects film; it has to be a man.

115
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
We really felt like we were in a -- kind of a 12-step program.

116
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And of course, the first step is: admit you've got a problem. (Laughter)

117
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So we had a big problem:

118
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
we didn't know how we were going to do this.

119
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
But we did know one thing.

120
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Being from the visual effects industry,

121
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
we, with David, believed that we now had enough time,

122
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
enough resources, and, God, we hoped we had enough money.

123
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And we had enough passion to will the processes and technology into existence.

124
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So, when you're faced with something like that,

125
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
of course you've got to break it down.

126
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
You take the big problem and you break it down into smaller pieces

127
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and you start to attack that.

128
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So we had three main areas that we had to focus on.

129
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
We needed to make Brad look a lot older --

130
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
needed to age him 45 years or so.

131
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And we also needed to make sure that we could take Brad's idiosyncrasies,

132
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
his little tics, the little subtleties that make him who he is

133
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and have that translate through our process

134
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
so that it appears in Benjamin on the screen.

135
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And we also needed to create a character

136
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
that could hold up under, really, all conditions.

137
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
He needed to be able to walk in broad daylight,

138
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
at nighttime, under candlelight,

139
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
he had to hold an extreme close-up,

140
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
he had to deliver dialogue,

141
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
he had to be able to run, he had to be able to sweat,

142
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
he had to be able to take a bath, to cry,

143
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
he even had to throw up.

144
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Not all at the same time --

145
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
but he had to, you know, do all of those things.

146
0:06:56.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And the work had to hold up for almost the first hour of the movie.

147
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
We did about 325 shots.

148
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So we needed a system that would allow Benjamin

149
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:07,000
to do everything a human being can do.

150
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And we realized that there was a giant chasm

151
0:07:10.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
between the state of the art of technology in 2004

152
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and where we needed it to be.

153
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So we focused on motion capture.

154
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I'm sure many of you have seen motion capture.

155
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
The state of the art at the time

156
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
was something called marker-based motion capture.

157
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I'll give you an example here.

158
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
It's basically the idea of, you wear a leotard,

159
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and they put some reflective markers on your body,

160
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and instead of using cameras,

161
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
there're infrared sensors around a volume,

162
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and those infrared sensors track the three-dimensional position

163
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
of those markers in real time.

164
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And then animators can take the data of the motion of those markers

165
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and apply them to a computer-generated character.

166
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:45,000
You can see the computer characters on the right

167
0:07:45.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
are having the same complex motion as the dancers.

168
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
But we also looked at numbers of other films at the time

169
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that were using facial marker tracking,

170
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and that's the idea of putting markers on the human face

171
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and doing the same process.

172
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And as you can see, it gives you a pretty crappy performance.

173
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
That's not terribly compelling.

174
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And what we realized

175
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
was that what we needed

176
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
was the information that was going on between the markers.

177
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
We needed the subtleties of the skin.

178
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
We needed to see skin moving over muscle moving over bone.

179
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
We needed creases and dimples and wrinkles and all of those things.

180
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Our first revelation was to completely abort and walk away from

181
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
the technology of the day, the status quo, the state of the art.

182
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
So we aborted using motion capture.

183
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And we were now well out of our comfort zone,

184
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and in uncharted territory.

185
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So we were left with this idea

186
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
that we ended up calling "technology stew."

187
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
We started to look out in other fields.

188
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
The idea was that we were going to find

189
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
nuggets or gems of technology

190
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that come from other industries like medical imaging,

191
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
the video game space,

192
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and re-appropriate them.

193
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And we had to create kind of a sauce.

194
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And the sauce was code in software

195
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that we'd written to allow these disparate pieces of technology

196
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
to come together and work as one.

197
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
Initially, we came across some remarkable research

198
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
done by a gentleman named Dr. Paul Ekman in the early '70s.

199
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
He believed that he could, in fact,

200
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
catalog the human face.

201
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And he came up with this idea of Facial Action Coding System, or FACS.

202
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
He believed that there were 70 basic poses

203
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
or shapes of the human face,

204
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and that those basic poses or shapes of the face

205
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
can be combined to create infinite possibilities

206
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
of everything the human face is capable of doing.

207
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And of course, these transcend age, race, culture, gender.

208
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
So this became the foundation of our research as we went forward.

209
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And then we came across some remarkable technology

210
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
called Contour.

211
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And here you can see a subject having phosphorus makeup

212
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
stippled on her face.

213
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And now what we're looking at is really creating a surface capture

214
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
as opposed to a marker capture.

215
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
The subject stands in front of a computer array of cameras,

216
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and those cameras can, frame-by-frame,

217
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
reconstruct the geometry of exactly what the subject's doing at the moment.

218
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
So, effectively, you get 3D data in real time of the subject.

219
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And if you look in a comparison,

220
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
on the left, we see what volumetric data gives us

221
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and on the right you see what markers give us.

222
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So, clearly, we were in a substantially better place for this.

223
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
But these were the early days of this technology,

224
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and it wasn't really proven yet.

225
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
We measure complexity and fidelity of data

226
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:17,000
in terms of polygonal count.

227
0:10:17.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And so, on the left, we were seeing 100,000 polygons.

228
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
We could go up into the millions of polygons.

229
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
It seemed to be infinite.

230
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
This was when we had our "Aha!"

231
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
This was the breakthrough.

232
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
This is when we're like, "OK, we're going to be OK,

233
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
This is actually going to work."

234
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And the "Aha!" was, what if we could take Brad Pitt,

235
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and we could put Brad in this device,

236
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and use this Contour process,

237
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and we could stipple on this phosphorescent makeup

238
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and put him under the black lights,

239
0:10:42.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and we could, in fact, scan him in real time

240
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
performing Ekman's FACS poses.

241
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Right? So, effectively,

242
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
we ended up with a 3D database

243
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
of everything Brad Pitt's face is capable of doing.

244
0:10:54.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
(Laughter)

245
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
From there, we actually carved up those faces

246
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
into smaller pieces and components of his face.

247
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
So we ended up with literally thousands and thousands and thousands of shapes,

248
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
a complete database of all possibilities

249
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that his face is capable of doing.

250
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Now, that's great, except we had him at age 44.

251
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
We need to put another 40 years on him at this point.

252
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
We brought in Rick Baker,

253
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and Rick is one of the great makeup and special effects gurus

254
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
of our industry.

255
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And we also brought in a gentleman named Kazu Tsuji,

256
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and Kazu Tsuji is one of the great photorealist sculptors of our time.

257
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And we commissioned them to make a maquette,

258
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
or a bust, of Benjamin.

259
0:11:33.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
So, in the spirit of "The Great Unveiling" -- I had to do this --

260
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
I had to unveil something.

261
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
So this is Ben 80.

262
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:42,000
We created three of these:

263
0:11:42.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
there's Ben 80, there's Ben 70, there's Ben 60.

264
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And this really became the template for moving forward.

265
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Now, this was made from a life cast of Brad.

266
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So, in fact, anatomically, it is correct.

267
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
The eyes, the jaw, the teeth:

268
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
everything is in perfect alignment with what the real guy has.

269
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
We have these maquettes scanned into the computer

270
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
at very high resolution --

271
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
enormous polygonal count.

272
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And so now we had three age increments of Benjamin

273
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
in the computer.

274
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
But we needed to get a database of him doing more than that.

275
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
We went through this process, then, called retargeting.

276
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:18,000
This is Brad doing one of the Ekman FACS poses.

277
0:12:18.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And here's the resulting data that comes from that,

278
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:23,000
the model that comes from that.

279
0:12:23.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Retargeting is the process of transposing that data

280
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
onto another model.

281
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And because the life cast, or the bust -- the maquette -- of Benjamin

282
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
was made from Brad,

283
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
we could transpose the data of Brad at 44

284
0:12:36.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
onto Brad at 87.

285
0:12:38.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
So now, we had a 3D database of everything Brad Pitt's face can do

286
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
at age 87, in his 70s and in his 60s.

287
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Next we had to go into the shooting process.

288
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:49,000
So while all that's going on,

289
0:12:49.33,000 --> 0:12:51,000
we're down in New Orleans and locations around the world.

290
0:12:51.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And we shot our body actors,

291
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and we shot them wearing blue hoods.

292
0:12:55.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
So these are the gentleman who played Benjamin.

293
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And the blue hoods helped us with two things:

294
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:01,000
one, we could easily erase their heads;

295
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and we also put tracking markers on their heads

296
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
so we could recreate the camera motion

297
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and the lens optics from the set.

298
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
But now we needed to get Brad's performance to drive our virtual Benjamin.

299
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And so we edited the footage that was shot on location

300
0:13:12.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
with the rest of the cast and the body actors

301
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and about six months later

302
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
we brought Brad onto a sound stage in Los Angeles

303
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and he watched on the screen.

304
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
His job, then, was to become Benjamin.

305
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And so we looped the scenes.

306
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:27,000
He watched again and again.

307
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
We encouraged him to improvise.

308
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And he took Benjamin into interesting and unusual places

309
0:13:32.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
that we didn't think he was going to go.

310
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
We shot him with four HD cameras

311
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
so we'd get multiple views of him

312
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and then David would choose the take of Brad being Benjamin

313
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
that he thought best matched the footage

314
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:44,000
with the rest of the cast.

315
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
From there we went into a process called image analysis.

316
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And so here, you can see again, the chosen take.

317
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And you are seeing, now, that data being transposed on to Ben 87.

318
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And so, what's interesting about this is

319
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:13:58,000
we used something called image analysis,

320
0:13:58.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
which is taking timings from different components of Benjamin's face.

321
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And so we could choose, say, his left eyebrow.

322
0:14:04.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And the software would tell us that, well,

323
0:14:06.33,000 --> 0:14:08,000
in frame 14 the left eyebrow begins to move from here to here,

324
0:14:08.33,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and it concludes moving in frame 32.

325
0:14:10.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And so we could choose numbers of positions on the face

326
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
to pull that data from.

327
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
And then, the sauce I talked about with our technology stew --

328
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
that secret sauce was, effectively, software that allowed us to

329
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:22,000
match the performance footage of Brad

330
0:14:22.33,000 --> 0:14:26,000
in live action with our database of aged Benjamin,

331
0:14:26.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
the FACS shapes that we had.

332
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
On a frame-by-frame basis,

333
0:14:31.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
we could actually reconstruct a 3D head

334
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
that exactly matched the performance of Brad.

335
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
So this was how the finished shot appeared in the film.

336
0:14:40.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And here you can see the body actor.

337
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
And then this is what we called the "dead head," no reference to Jerry Garcia.

338
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
And then here's the reconstructed performance

339
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:51,000
now with the timings of the performance.

340
0:14:51.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And then, again, the final shot.

341
0:14:54.33,000 --> 0:14:56,000
It was a long process.

342
0:14:56.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
(Applause)

343
0:15:07.33,000 --> 0:15:09,000
The next section here, I'm going to just blast through this,

344
0:15:09.33,000 --> 0:15:13,000
because we could do a whole TEDTalk on the next several slides.

345
0:15:13.33,000 --> 0:15:16,000
We had to create a lighting system.

346
0:15:16.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
So really, a big part of our processes was creating a lighting environment

347
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
for every single location that Benjamin had to appear

348
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:24,000
so that we could put Ben's head into any scene

349
0:15:24.33,000 --> 0:15:27,000
and it would exactly match the lighting that's on the other actors

350
0:15:27.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
in the real world.

351
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:31,000
We also had to create an eye system.

352
0:15:31.33,000 --> 0:15:33,000
We found the old adage, you know,

353
0:15:33.33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
"The eyes are the window to the soul,"

354
0:15:35.33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
absolutely true.

355
0:15:36.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
So the key here was to keep everybody looking in Ben's eyes.

356
0:15:38.33,000 --> 0:15:4,000
And if you could feel the warmth, and feel the humanity,

357
0:15:40.33,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and feel his intent coming through the eyes,

358
0:15:43.33,000 --> 0:15:44,000
then we would succeed.

359
0:15:44.33,000 --> 0:15:47,000
So we had one person focused on the eye system

360
0:15:47.33,000 --> 0:15:49,000
for almost two full years.

361
0:15:49.33,000 --> 0:15:51,000
We also had to create a mouth system.

362
0:15:51.33,000 --> 0:15:53,000
We worked from dental molds of Brad.

363
0:15:53.33,000 --> 0:15:55,000
We had to age the teeth over time.

364
0:15:55.33,000 --> 0:15:58,000
We also had to create an articulating tongue that allowed him to enunciate his words.

365
0:15:58.33,000 --> 0:16:,000
There was a whole system written in software to articulate the tongue.

366
0:16:00.33,000 --> 0:16:02,000
We had one person devoted to the tongue for about nine months.

367
0:16:02.33,000 --> 0:16:04,000
He was very popular.

368
0:16:04.33,000 --> 0:16:07,000
Skin displacement: another big deal.

369
0:16:07.33,000 --> 0:16:09,000
The skin had to be absolutely accurate.

370
0:16:09.33,000 --> 0:16:12,000
He's also in an old age home, he's in a nursing home

371
0:16:12.33,000 --> 0:16:14,000
around other old people,

372
0:16:14.33,000 --> 0:16:16,000
so he had to look exactly the same as the others.

373
0:16:16.33,000 --> 0:16:17,000
So, lots of work on skin deformation,

374
0:16:17.33,000 --> 0:16:18,000
you can see in some of these cases it works,

375
0:16:18.33,000 --> 0:16:19,000
in some cases it looks bad.

376
0:16:19.33,000 --> 0:16:21,000
This is a very, very, very early test in our process.

377
0:16:21.33,000 --> 0:16:24,000
So, effectively we created a digital puppet

378
0:16:24.33,000 --> 0:16:27,000
that Brad Pitt could operate with his own face.

379
0:16:27.33,000 --> 0:16:31,000
There were no animators necessary to come in and interpret behavior

380
0:16:31.33,000 --> 0:16:33,000
or enhance his performance.

381
0:16:33.33,000 --> 0:16:36,000
There was something that we encountered, though,

382
0:16:36.33,000 --> 0:16:39,000
that we ended up calling "the digital Botox effect."

383
0:16:39.33,000 --> 0:16:42,000
So, as things went through this process,

384
0:16:42.33,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Fincher would always say, "It sandblasts the edges off of the performance."

385
0:16:45.33,000 --> 0:16:48,000
And thing our process and the technology couldn't do,

386
0:16:48.33,000 --> 0:16:51,000
is they couldn't understand intent,

387
0:16:51.33,000 --> 0:16:53,000
the intent of the actor.

388
0:16:53.33,000 --> 0:16:55,000
So it sees a smile as a smile.

389
0:16:55.33,000 --> 0:16:58,000
It doesn't recognize an ironic smile, or a happy smile,

390
0:16:58.33,000 --> 0:16:59,000
or a frustrated smile.

391
0:16:59.33,000 --> 0:17:02,000
So it did take humans to kind of push it one way or another.

392
0:17:02.33,000 --> 0:17:05,000
But we ended up calling the entire process

393
0:17:05.33,000 --> 0:17:07,000
and all the technology "emotion capture,"

394
0:17:07.33,000 --> 0:17:08,000
as opposed to just motion capture.

395
0:17:08.33,000 --> 0:17:1,000
Take another look.

396
0:17:11.33,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Brad Pitt: Well, I heard momma and Tizzy whisper,

397
0:17:13.33,000 --> 0:17:15,000
and they said I was gonna die soon,

398
0:17:15.33,000 --> 0:17:17,000
but ... maybe not.

399
0:17:37.33,000 --> 0:17:4,000
EU: That's how to create a digital human in 18 minutes.

400
0:17:40.33,000 --> 0:17:43,000
(Applause)

401
0:17:48.33,000 --> 0:17:5,000
A couple of quick factoids;

402
0:17:50.33,000 --> 0:17:54,000
it really took 155 people over two years,

403
0:17:54.33,000 --> 0:17:58,000
and we didn't even talk about 60 hairstyles and an all-digital haircut.

404
0:17:58.33,000 --> 0:18:01,000
But, that is Benjamin. Thank you.

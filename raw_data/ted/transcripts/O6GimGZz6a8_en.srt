1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Okay, I'm going to show you

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
again something about our diets.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And I would like to know what the audience is,

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and so who of you ever ate insects?

5
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
That's quite a lot.

6
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
But still, you're not representing

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
the overall population of the Earth.

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Because there's 80 percent out there that really eats insects.

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
But this is quite good.

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Why not eat insects? Well first, what are insects?

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Insects are animals that walk around on six legs.

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And here you see just a selection.

15
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
There's six million species of insects on this planet,

16
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
six million species.

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
There's a few hundreds of mammals --

18
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
six million species of insects.

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
In fact, if we count all the individual organisms,

20
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
we would come at much larger numbers.

21
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
In fact, of all animals on Earth,

22
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
of all animal species,

23
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
80 percent walks on six legs.

24
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
But if we would count all the individuals,

25
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and we take an average weight of them,

26
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
it would amount to something like 200 to 2,000 kilograms

27
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
for each of you and me on Earth.

28
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
That means that in terms of biomass,

29
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
insects are more abundant than we are,

30
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and we're not on a planet of men,

31
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
but we're on a planet of insects.

32
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Insects are not only there in nature,

33
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
but they also are involved in our economy,

34
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
usually without us knowing.

35
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
There was an estimation,

36
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
a conservative estimation, a couple of years ago

37
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that the U.S. economy

38
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
benefited by 57 billion

39
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
dollars per year.

40
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
It's a number -- very large --

41
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
a contribution to the economy of the United States for free.

42
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And so I looked up what the economy was paying

43
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
for the war in Iraq

44
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
in the same year.

45
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
It was 80 billion U.S. dollars.

46
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Well we know that that

47
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
was not a cheap war.

48
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So insects, just for free,

49
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
contribute to the economy of the United States

50
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
with about the same order of magnitude,

51
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
just for free, without everyone knowing.

52
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And not only in the States,

53
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
but in any country, in any economy.

54
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
What do they do?

55
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
They remove dung, they pollinate our crops.

56
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
A third of all the fruits that we eat

57
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
are all a result

58
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
of insects taking care of the reproduction of plants.

59
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
They control pests,

60
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and they're food for animals.

61
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
They're at the start of food chains.

62
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Small animals eat insects.

63
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Even larger animals eat insects.

64
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
But the small animals that eat insects

65
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
are being eaten by larger animals,

66
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
still larger animals.

67
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And at the end of the food chain, we are eating them as well.

68
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
There's quite a lot of people that are eating insects.

69
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And here you see me

70
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
in a small, provincial town in China, Lijiang --

71
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
about two million inhabitants.

72
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
If you go out for dinner, like in a fish restaurant,

73
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
where you can select which fish you want to eat,

74
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
you can select which insects you would like to eat.

75
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And they prepare it in a wonderful way.

76
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And here you see me enjoying a meal

77
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
with caterpillars, locusts,

78
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
bee pupae -- delicacies.

79
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And you can eat something new everyday.

80
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
There's more than 1,000 species of insects

81
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that are being eaten all around the globe.

82
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
That's quite a bit more

83
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
than just a few mammals that we're eating,

84
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
like a cow or a pig

85
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
or a sheep.

86
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
More than 1,000 species --

87
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
an enormous variety.

88
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And now you may think, okay,

89
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
in this provincial town in China they're doing that, but not us.

90
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Well we've seen already that quite some of you

91
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
already ate insects maybe occasionally,

92
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
but I can tell you that every one of you

93
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
is eating insects, without any exception.

94
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
You're eating at least

95
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
500 grams per year.

96
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
What are you eating?

97
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Tomato soup, peanut butter,

98
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
chocolate, noodles --

99
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
any processed food that you're eating

100
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
contains insects,

101
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
because insects are here all around us,

102
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and when they're out there in nature

103
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
they're also in our crops.

104
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Some fruits get some insect damage.

105
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Those are the fruits, if they're tomato,

106
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that go to the tomato soup.

107
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
If they don't have any damage, they go to the grocery.

108
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And that's your view of a tomato.

109
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
But there's tomatoes that end up in a soup,

110
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and as long as they meet

111
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
the requirements of the food agency,

112
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
there can be all kinds of things in there,

113
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
no problem.

114
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
In fact, why would we put these balls in the soup,

115
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
there's meat in there anyway?

116
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
(Laughter)

117
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
In fact, all our processed foods

118
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
contain more proteins

119
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
than we would be aware of.

120
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So anything is a good protein source already.

121
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Now you may say,

122
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
"Okay, so we're eating 500 grams just by accident."

123
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
We're even doing this on purpose.

124
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
In a lot of food items that we have --

125
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I have only two items

126
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
here on the slide --

127
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
pink cookies or surimi sticks

128
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
or, if you like, Campari --

129
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
a lot of our food products that are of a red color

130
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
are dyed with a natural dye.

131
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
The surimi sticks

132
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
[of] crabmeat, or is being sold as crab meat,

133
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
is white fish

134
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
that's being dyed with cochineal.

135
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Cochineal is a product

136
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
of an insect that lives off these cacti.

137
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
It's being produced in large amounts,

138
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
150 to 180 metric tons per year

139
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
in the Canary Islands in Peru,

140
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and it's big business.

141
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
One gram of cochineal

142
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
costs about 30 euros.

143
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
One gram of gold

144
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
is 30 euros.

145
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So it's a very precious thing

146
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
that we're using to dye our foods.

147
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Now the situation in the world is going to change

148
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
for you and me, for everyone on this Earth.

149
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
The human population is growing very rapidly

150
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and is growing exponentially.

151
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Where, at the moment, we have

152
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
something between six and seven billion people,

153
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
it will grow to about nine billion

154
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
in 2050.

155
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
That means that we have a lot more mouths to feed,

156
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and this is something that worries more and more people.

157
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
There was an FAO conference last October

158
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
that was completely devoted to this.

159
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
How are we going to feed this world?

160
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And if you look at the figures up there,

161
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
it says that we have a third more mouths to feed,

162
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
but we need an agricultural production increase

163
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
of 70 percent.

164
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And that's especially because this world population

165
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
is increasing,

166
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and it's increasing, not only in numbers,

167
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
but we're also getting wealthier,

168
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more

169
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and also starts to eat more meat.

170
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And meat, in fact, is something

171
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
that costs a lot

172
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
of our agricultural production.

173
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Our diet consists, [in] some part, of animal proteins,

174
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and at the moment, most of us here

175
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
get it from livestock,

176
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
from fish, from game.

177
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And we eat quite a lot of it.

178
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
In the developed world it's on average

179
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
80 kilograms per person per year,

180
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
which goes up to 120

181
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
in the United States

182
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and a bit lower in some other countries,

183
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
but on average 80 kilograms

184
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
per person per year.

185
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
In the developing world it's much lower.

186
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
It's 25 kilograms per person per year.

187
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
But it's increasing enormously.

188
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
In China in the last 20 years,

189
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
it increased from 20 to 50,

190
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and it's still increasing.

191
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
So if a third of the world population

192
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
is going to increase its meat consumption

193
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
from 25 to 80 on average,

194
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and a third of the world population

195
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
is living in China and in India,

196
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
we're having an enormous demand on meat.

197
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And of course, we are not there to say

198
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that's only for us, it's not for them.

199
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
They have the same share that we have.

200
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Now to start with, I should say

201
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that we are eating way too much meat

202
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
in the Western world.

203
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
We could do with much, much less --

204
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and I know, I've been a vegetarian for a long time,

205
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and you can easily do without anything.

206
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
You'll get proteins in any kind of food anyway.

207
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
But then there's a lot of problems

208
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
that come with meat production,

209
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and we're being faced with that more and more often.

210
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
The first problem that we're facing is human health.

211
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Pigs are quite like us.

212
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
They're even models in medicine,

213
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human.

214
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
That means that pigs also share diseases with us.

215
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And a pig disease,

216
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
a pig virus, and a human virus

217
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
can both proliferate,

218
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and because of their kind of reproduction,

219
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
they can combine and produce a new virus.

220
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
This has happened in the Netherlands in the 1990s

221
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
during the classical swine fever outbreak.

222
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
You get a new disease that can be deadly.

223
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
We eat insects -- they're so distantly related from us

224
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
that this doesn't happen.

225
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So that's one point for insects.

226
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
(Laughter)

227
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And there's the conversion factor.

228
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
You take 10 kilograms of feed,

229
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
you can get one kilogram of beef,

230
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
but you can get nine kilograms of locust meat.

231
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So if you would be an entrepreneur,

232
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
what would you do?

233
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
With 10 kilograms of input,

234
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
you can get either one or nine kg. of output.

235
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So far we're taking

236
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
the one, or up to five kilograms of output.

237
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
We're not taking the bonus yet.

238
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
We're not taking the nine kilograms of output yet.

239
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
So that's two points for insects.

240
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
(Laughter)

241
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
And there's the environment.

242
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
If we take 10 kilograms of food --

243
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
(Laughter)

244
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and it results in one kilogram of beef,

245
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
the other nine kilograms are waste,

246
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and a lot of that is manure.

247
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
If you produce insects, you have less manure

248
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
per kilogram of meat that you produce.

249
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
So less waste.

250
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Furthermore, per kilogram of manure,

251
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
you have much, much less ammonia

252
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and fewer greenhouse gases

253
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
when you have insect manure

254
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
than when you have cow manure.

255
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
So you have less waste,

256
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign

257
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
as it is with cow dung.

258
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So that's three points for insects.

259
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
(Laughter)

260
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Now there's a big "if," of course,

261
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and it is if insects produce meat

262
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
that is of good quality.

263
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Well there have been all kinds of analyses

264
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and in terms of protein, or fat, or vitamins,

265
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
it's very good.

266
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
In fact, it's comparable

267
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
to anything we eat as meat at the moment.

268
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And even in terms of calories, it is very good.

269
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
One kilogram of grasshoppers

270
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
has the same amount of calories

271
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
as 10 hot dogs, or six Big Macs.

272
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
So that's four points for insects.

273
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
(Laughter)

274
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
I can go on,

275
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and I could make many more points for insects,

276
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
but time doesn't allow this.

277
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
So the question is, why not eat insects?

278
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
I gave you at least four arguments in favor.

279
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
We'll have to.

280
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Even if you don't like it,

281
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
you'll have to get used to this

282
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
because at the moment,

283
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
70 percent of all our agricultural land

284
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
is being used to produce livestock.

285
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
That's not only the land

286
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
where the livestock is walking and feeding,

287
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
but it's also other areas

288
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
where the feed is being produced and being transported.

289
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
We can increase it a bit

290
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
at the expense of rainforests,

291
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
but there's a limitation very soon.

292
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And if you remember that we need to increase

293
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
agricultural production by 70 percent,

294
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
we're not going to make it that way.

295
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
We could much better change

296
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
from meat, from beef,

297
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
to insects.

298
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And then 80 percent of the world

299
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
already eats insects,

300
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
so we are just a minority --

301
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
in a country like the U.K., the USA,

302
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
the Netherlands, anywhere.

303
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
On the left-hand side, you see a market in Laos

304
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
where they have abundantly present

305
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night.

306
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
On the right-hand side you see a grasshopper.

307
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
So people there are eating them,

308
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
not because they're hungry,

309
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
but because they think it's a delicacy.

310
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
It's just very good food.

311
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
You can vary enormously.

312
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
It has many benefits.

313
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
In fact, we have delicacy

314
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
that's very much like this grasshopper:

315
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
shrimps, a delicacy

316
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
being sold at a high price.

317
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Who wouldn't like to eat a shrimp?

318
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
There are a few people who don't like shrimp,

319
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
but shrimp, or crabs,

320
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
or crayfish,

321
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
are very closely related.

322
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
They are delicacies.

323
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
In fact, a locust is a "shrimp" of the land,

324
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and it would make very good into our diet.

325
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
So why are we not eating insects yet?

326
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Well that's just a matter of mindset.

327
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
We're not used to it,

328
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us.

329
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
That's why we're changing the perception of insects.

330
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And I'm working very hard with my colleague, Arnold van Huis,

331
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
in telling people what insects are,

332
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
what magnificent things they are,

333
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
what magnificent jobs they do in nature.

334
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And in fact, without insects,

335
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
we would not be here in this room,

336
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
because if the insects die out,

337
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
we will soon die out as well.

338
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
If we die out, the insects will continue very happily.

339
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
(Laughter)

340
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
So we have to get used to the idea of eating insects.

341
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And some might think, well they're not yet available.

342
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Well they are.

343
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
There are entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that produce them,

344
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and one of them is here in the audience,

345
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Marian Peeters, who's in the picture.

346
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
I predict that later this year, you'll get them in the supermarkets --

347
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
not visible, but as animal protein

348
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
in the food.

349
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And maybe by 2020,

350
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
you'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you're going to eat.

351
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
And they're being made in the most wonderful ways.

352
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
A Dutch chocolate maker.

353
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
(Music)

354
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
(Applause)

355
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
So there's even a lot of design to it.

356
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
(Laughter)

357
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Well in the Netherlands, we have an innovative Minister of Agriculture,

358
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and she puts the insects on the menu

359
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
in her restaurant in her ministry.

360
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
And when she got all the Ministers of Agriculture of the E.U.

361
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
over to the Hague recently,

362
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
she went to a high-class restaurant,

363
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and they ate insects all together.

364
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
It's not something that is a hobby of mine.

365
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
It's really taken off the ground.

366
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
So why not eat insects?

367
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
You should try it yourself.

368
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
A couple of years ago, we had 1,750 people all together

369
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
in a square in Wageningen town,

370
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and they ate insects at the same moment,

371
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
and this was still big, big news.

372
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
I think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects,

373
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
because it's just a normal way of doing.

374
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
So you can try it yourself today,

375
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and I would say, enjoy.

376
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And I'm going to show to Bruno some first tries,

377
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
and he can have the first bite.

378
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
(Applause)

379
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Bruno Giussani: Look at them first. Look at them first.

380
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
Marcel Dicke: It's all protein.

381
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
BG: That's exactly the same [one] you saw in the video actually.

382
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
And it looks delicious.

383
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
They just make it [with] nuts or something.

384
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
MD: Thank you.

385
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.641,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So, there's about seven and a half billion of us.

2
0:00:16.635,000 --> 0:00:19,000
The World Health Organization tells us that 300 million of us are depressed,

3
0:00:21.214,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and about 800,000 people take their lives every year.

4
0:00:24.803,000 --> 0:00:28,000
A tiny subset of them choose a profoundly nihilistic route,

5
0:00:28.901,000 --> 0:00:32,000
which is they die in the act of killing as many people as possible.

6
0:00:33.14,000 --> 0:00:35,000
These are some famous recent examples.

7
0:00:36.019,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And here's a less famous one. It happened about nine weeks ago.

8
0:00:39.076,000 --> 0:00:4,000
If you don't remember it,

9
0:00:40.292,000 --> 0:00:42,000
it's because there's a lot of this going on.

10
0:00:42.398,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Wikipedia just last year counted 323 mass shootings

11
0:00:47.103,000 --> 0:00:49,000
in my home country, the United States.

12
0:00:50.108,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Not all of those shooters were suicidal,

13
0:00:52.346,000 --> 0:00:54,000
not all of them were maximizing their death tolls,

14
0:00:55.166,000 --> 0:00:56,000
but many, many were.

15
0:00:56.97,000 --> 0:00:59,000
An important question becomes: What limits do these people have?

16
0:01:00.568,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Take the Vegas shooter.

17
0:01:02.098,000 --> 0:01:04,000
He slaughtered 58 people.

18
0:01:05.342,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Did he stop there because he'd had enough?

19
0:01:07.801,000 --> 0:01:12,000
No, and we know this because he shot and injured another 422 people

20
0:01:13.469,000 --> 0:01:15,000
who he surely would have preferred to kill.

21
0:01:16.283,000 --> 0:01:18,000
We have no reason to think he would have stopped at 4,200.

22
0:01:19.047,000 --> 0:01:22,000
In fact, with somebody this nihilistic, he may well have gladly killed us all.

23
0:01:23.029,000 --> 0:01:24,000
We don't know.

24
0:01:24.953,000 --> 0:01:26,000
What we do know is this:

25
0:01:27.024,000 --> 0:01:3,000
when suicidal murderers really go all in,

26
0:01:30.467,000 --> 0:01:32,000
technology is the force multiplier.

27
0:01:33.843,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Here's an example.

28
0:01:35.277,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Several years back, there was a rash of 10 mass school attacks in China

29
0:01:40.3,000 --> 0:01:43,000
carried out with things like knives and hammers and cleavers,

30
0:01:44.026,000 --> 0:01:46,000
because guns are really hard to get there.

31
0:01:46.097,000 --> 0:01:49,000
By macabre coincidence, this last attack occurred

32
0:01:50.108,000 --> 0:01:53,000
just hours before the massacre in Newtown, Connecticut.

33
0:01:54.025,000 --> 0:01:58,000
But that one American attack killed roughly the same number of victims

34
0:01:58.431,000 --> 0:02:,000
as the 10 Chinese attacks combined.

35
0:02:01.376,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So we can fairly say, knife: terrible; gun: way worse.

36
0:02:07.273,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And airplane: massively worse,

37
0:02:10.01,000 --> 0:02:14,000
as pilot Andreas Lubitz showed when he forced 149 people

38
0:02:14.241,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to join him in his suicide,

39
0:02:16.281,000 --> 0:02:18,000
smashing a plane into the French Alps.

40
0:02:19.046,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And there are other examples of this.

41
0:02:21.856,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And I'm afraid there are far more deadly weapons in our near future than airplanes,

42
0:02:26.928,000 --> 0:02:27,000
ones not made of metal.

43
0:02:29.125,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So let's consider the apocalyptic dynamics that will ensue

44
0:02:34.271,000 --> 0:02:38,000
if suicidal mass murder hitches a ride on a rapidly advancing field

45
0:02:39.169,000 --> 0:02:42,000
that for the most part holds boundless promise for society.

46
0:02:43.606,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Somewhere out there in the world, there's a tiny group of people

47
0:02:46.69,000 --> 0:02:48,000
who would attempt, however ineptly,

48
0:02:49.315,000 --> 0:02:51,000
to kill us all if they could just figure out how.

49
0:02:52.736,000 --> 0:02:54,000
The Vegas shooter may or may not have been one of them,

50
0:02:55.459,000 --> 0:02:56,000
but with seven and a half billion of us,

51
0:02:57.44,000 --> 0:02:59,000
this is a nonzero population.

52
0:02:59.898,000 --> 0:03:01,000
There's plenty of suicidal nihilists out there.

53
0:03:02.166,000 --> 0:03:03,000
We've already seen that.

54
0:03:03.385,000 --> 0:03:06,000
There's people with severe mood disorders that they can't even control.

55
0:03:07.113,000 --> 0:03:12,000
There are people who have just suffered deranging traumas, etc. etc.

56
0:03:12.993,000 --> 0:03:13,000
As for the corollary group,

57
0:03:14.673,000 --> 0:03:18,000
its size was simply zero forever until the Cold War,

58
0:03:19.399,000 --> 0:03:21,000
when suddenly, the leaders of two global alliances

59
0:03:22.251,000 --> 0:03:24,000
attained the ability to blow up the world.

60
0:03:26.043,000 --> 0:03:29,000
The number of people with actual doomsday buttons

61
0:03:29.58,000 --> 0:03:31,000
has stayed fairly stable since then.

62
0:03:32.248,000 --> 0:03:34,000
But I'm afraid it's about to grow,

63
0:03:34.457,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and not just to three.

64
0:03:36.079,000 --> 0:03:37,000
This is going off the charts.

65
0:03:37.521,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I mean, it's going to look like a tech business plan.

66
0:03:40.146,000 --> 0:03:42,000
(Laughter)

67
0:03:44.264,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And the reason is,

68
0:03:45.952,000 --> 0:03:47,000
we're in the era of exponential technologies,

69
0:03:48.316,000 --> 0:03:52,000
which routinely take eternal impossibilities

70
0:03:53.127,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and make them the actual superpowers of one or two living geniuses

71
0:03:58.96,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and -- this is the big part --

72
0:04:00.767,000 --> 0:04:02,000
then diffuse those powers to more or less everybody.

73
0:04:03.853,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Now, here's a benign example.

74
0:04:05.545,000 --> 0:04:09,000
If you wanted to play checkers with a computer in 1952,

75
0:04:10.215,000 --> 0:04:13,000
you literally had to be that guy,

76
0:04:13.722,000 --> 0:04:17,000
then commandeer one of the world's 19 copies of that computer,

77
0:04:18.731,000 --> 0:04:21,000
then used your Nobel-adjacent brain to teach it checkers.

78
0:04:22.381,000 --> 0:04:23,000
That was the bar.

79
0:04:24.869,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Today, you just need to know someone who knows someone who owns a telephone,

80
0:04:29.585,000 --> 0:04:32,000
because computing is an exponential technology.

81
0:04:33.243,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So is synthetic biology,

82
0:04:35.281,000 --> 0:04:37,000
which I'll now refer to as "synbio."

83
0:04:38.006,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And in 2011, a couple of researchers did something every bit as ingenious

84
0:04:43.72,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and unprecedented as the checkers trick

85
0:04:46.85,000 --> 0:04:47,000
with H5N1 flu.

86
0:04:49.435,000 --> 0:04:53,000
This is a strain that kills up to 60 percent of the people it infects,

87
0:04:54.115,000 --> 0:04:55,000
more than Ebola.

88
0:04:55.834,000 --> 0:04:57,000
But it is so uncontagious

89
0:04:58.528,000 --> 0:05:02,000
that it's killed fewer than 50 people since 2015.

90
0:05:02.572,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So these researchers edited H5N1's genome

91
0:05:06.659,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and made it every bit as deadly, but also wildly contagious.

92
0:05:11.275,000 --> 0:05:14,000
The news arm of one of the world's top two scientific journals

93
0:05:14.648,000 --> 0:05:17,000
said if this thing got out, it would likely cause a pandemic

94
0:05:18.489,000 --> 0:05:2,000
with perhaps millions of deaths.

95
0:05:20.777,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And Dr. Paul Keim said

96
0:05:22.67,000 --> 0:05:25,000
he could not think of an organism as scary as this,

97
0:05:26.643,000 --> 0:05:29,000
which is the last thing I personally want to hear

98
0:05:29.766,000 --> 0:05:33,000
from the Chairman of the National Science Advisory Board on Biosecurity.

99
0:05:34.689,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And by the way, Dr. Keim also said this --

100
0:05:37.607,000 --> 0:05:39,000
["I don't think anthrax is scary at all compared to this."]

101
0:05:40.433,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And he's also one of these.

102
0:05:41.762,000 --> 0:05:42,000
[Anthrax expert] (Laughter)

103
0:05:43.116,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Now, the good news about the 2011 biohack

104
0:05:46.741,000 --> 0:05:49,000
is that the people who did it didn't mean us any harm.

105
0:05:49.828,000 --> 0:05:5,000
They're virologists.

106
0:05:51.044,000 --> 0:05:53,000
They believed they were advancing science.

107
0:05:53.235,000 --> 0:05:56,000
The bad news is that technology does not freeze in place,

108
0:05:57.002,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and over the next few decades,

109
0:05:59.054,000 --> 0:06:02,000
their feat will become trivially easy.

110
0:06:02.559,000 --> 0:06:05,000
In fact, it's already way easier, because as we learned yesterday morning,

111
0:06:06.423,000 --> 0:06:07,000
just two years after they did their work,

112
0:06:08.401,000 --> 0:06:11,000
the CRISPR system was harnessed for genome editing.

113
0:06:11.929,000 --> 0:06:12,000
This was a radical breakthrough

114
0:06:13.857,000 --> 0:06:16,000
that makes gene editing massively easier --

115
0:06:17.159,000 --> 0:06:2,000
so easy that CRISPR is now taught in high schools.

116
0:06:20.825,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And this stuff is moving quicker than computing.

117
0:06:24.149,000 --> 0:06:27,000
That slow, stodgy white line up there?

118
0:06:27.284,000 --> 0:06:29,000
That's Moore's law.

119
0:06:29.566,000 --> 0:06:32,000
That shows us how quickly computing is getting cheaper.

120
0:06:33.37,000 --> 0:06:36,000
That steep, crazy-fun green line,

121
0:06:36.427,000 --> 0:06:4,000
that shows us how quickly genetic sequencing is getting cheaper.

122
0:06:40.515,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Now, gene editing and synthesis and sequencing,

123
0:06:44.137,000 --> 0:06:46,000
they're different disciplines, but they're tightly related.

124
0:06:46.964,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And they're all moving in these headlong rates.

125
0:06:49.237,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And the keys to the kingdom are these tiny, tiny data files.

126
0:06:52.988,000 --> 0:06:55,000
That is an excerpt of H5N1's genome.

127
0:06:56.92,000 --> 0:06:58,000
The whole thing can fit on just a few pages.

128
0:06:59.847,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And yeah, don't worry, you can Google this as soon as you get home.

129
0:07:03.08,000 --> 0:07:04,000
It's all over the internet, right?

130
0:07:04.838,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And the part that made it contagious

131
0:07:06.796,000 --> 0:07:08,000
could well fit on a single Post-it note.

132
0:07:09.154,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And once a genius makes a data file,

133
0:07:13.175,000 --> 0:07:15,000
any idiot can copy it,

134
0:07:15.526,000 --> 0:07:17,000
distribute it worldwide

135
0:07:17.571,000 --> 0:07:18,000
or print it.

136
0:07:19.231,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And I don't just mean print it on this,

137
0:07:21.947,000 --> 0:07:23,000
but soon enough, on this.

138
0:07:24.993,000 --> 0:07:25,000
So let's imagine a scenario.

139
0:07:27.287,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Let's say it's 2026, to pick an arbitrary year,

140
0:07:30.647,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and a brilliant virologist, hoping to advance science

141
0:07:33.647,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and better understand pandemics,

142
0:07:35.977,000 --> 0:07:36,000
designs a new bug.

143
0:07:37.957,000 --> 0:07:39,000
It's as contagious as chicken pox,

144
0:07:40.135,000 --> 0:07:41,000
it's as deadly as Ebola,

145
0:07:42.079,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and it incubates for months and months before causing an outbreak,

146
0:07:46.111,000 --> 0:07:5,000
so the whole world can be infected before the first sign of trouble.

147
0:07:50.707,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Then, her university gets hacked.

148
0:07:53.242,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And of course, this is not science fiction.

149
0:07:55.688,000 --> 0:07:57,000
In fact, just one recent US indictment

150
0:07:57.898,000 --> 0:08:,000
documents the hacking of over 300 universities.

151
0:08:01.996,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So that file with the bug's genome on it spreads to the internet's dark corners.

152
0:08:07.541,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And once a file is out there, it never comes back --

153
0:08:11.218,000 --> 0:08:15,000
just ask anybody who runs a movie studio or a music label.

154
0:08:16.001,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So now maybe in 2026,

155
0:08:18.997,000 --> 0:08:2,000
it would take a true genius like our virologist

156
0:08:21.226,000 --> 0:08:23,000
to make the actual living critter,

157
0:08:23.871,000 --> 0:08:24,000
but 15 years later,

158
0:08:25.821,000 --> 0:08:28,000
it may just take a DNA printer you can find at any high school.

159
0:08:29.883,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And if not?

160
0:08:31.514,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Give it a couple of decades.

161
0:08:34.248,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So, a quick aside:

162
0:08:36.682,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Remember this slide here?

163
0:08:37.948,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Turn your attention to these two words.

164
0:08:40.84,000 --> 0:08:46,000
If somebody tries this and is only 0.1 percent effective,

165
0:08:47.144,000 --> 0:08:48,000
eight million people die.

166
0:08:48.971,000 --> 0:08:51,000
That's 2,500 9/11s.

167
0:08:52.634,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Civilization would survive,

168
0:08:55.064,000 --> 0:08:57,000
but it would be permanently disfigured.

169
0:08:58.586,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So this means we need to be concerned about anybody

170
0:09:01.76,000 --> 0:09:03,000
who has the faintest shot on goal,

171
0:09:03.908,000 --> 0:09:04,000
not just geniuses.

172
0:09:06.688,000 --> 0:09:11,000
So today, there's a tiny handful of geniuses

173
0:09:11.759,000 --> 0:09:13,000
who probably could make a doomsday bug

174
0:09:13.925,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that's .1-percent effective and maybe even a little bit more.

175
0:09:17.068,000 --> 0:09:22,000
They tend to be stable and successful and so not part of this group.

176
0:09:22.097,000 --> 0:09:25,000
So I guess I'm sorta kinda barely OK-ish with that.

177
0:09:26.307,000 --> 0:09:28,000
But what about after technology improves

178
0:09:29.203,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and diffuses

179
0:09:30.807,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and thousands of life science grad students are enabled?

180
0:09:34.158,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Are every single one of them going to be perfectly stable?

181
0:09:37.73,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Or how about a few years after that,

182
0:09:39.578,000 --> 0:09:42,000
where every stress-ridden premed is fully enabled?

183
0:09:43.311,000 --> 0:09:44,000
At some point in that time frame,

184
0:09:45.227,000 --> 0:09:47,000
these circles are going to intersect,

185
0:09:47.572,000 --> 0:09:5,000
because we're now starting to talk about hundreds of thousands of people

186
0:09:51.076,000 --> 0:09:52,000
throughout the world.

187
0:09:52.259,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And they recently included that guy who dressed up like the Joker

188
0:09:56.341,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and shot 12 people to death at a Batman premiere.

189
0:09:59.617,000 --> 0:10:01,000
That was a neuroscience PhD student

190
0:10:01.788,000 --> 0:10:02,000
with an NIH grant.

191
0:10:05.478,000 --> 0:10:06,000
OK, plot twist:

192
0:10:07.028,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I think we can actually survive this one if we start focusing on it now.

193
0:10:11.947,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And I say this, having spent countless hours

194
0:10:14.941,000 --> 0:10:16,000
interviewing global leaders in synbio

195
0:10:17.937,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and also researching their work for science podcasts I create.

196
0:10:21.995,000 --> 0:10:26,000
I have come to fear their work, in case I haven't gotten that out there yet --

197
0:10:27.157,000 --> 0:10:28,000
(Laughter)

198
0:10:28.729,000 --> 0:10:31,000
but more than that, to revere its potential.

199
0:10:32.101,000 --> 0:10:35,000
This stuff will cure cancer, heal our environment

200
0:10:35.979,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and stop our cruel treatment of other creatures.

201
0:10:39.942,000 --> 0:10:42,000
So how do we get all this without, you know, annihilating ourselves?

202
0:10:44.091,000 --> 0:10:47,000
First thing: like it or not, synbio is here,

203
0:10:47.946,000 --> 0:10:48,000
so let's embrace the technology.

204
0:10:49.864,000 --> 0:10:5,000
If we do a tech ban,

205
0:10:51.745,000 --> 0:10:54,000
that would only hand the wheel to bad actors.

206
0:10:54.926,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Unlike nuclear programs,

207
0:10:57.306,000 --> 0:10:59,000
biology can be practiced invisibly.

208
0:10:59.786,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Massive Soviet cheating on bioweapons treaties

209
0:11:03.167,000 --> 0:11:07,000
made that very clear, as does every illegal drug lab in the world.

210
0:11:07.825,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Secondly, enlist the experts.

211
0:11:10.073,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Let's sign them up and make more of them.

212
0:11:12.105,000 --> 0:11:14,000
For every million and one bioengineers we have,

213
0:11:14.747,000 --> 0:11:17,000
at least a million of them are going to be on our side.

214
0:11:18.858,000 --> 0:11:2,000
I mean, Al Capone would be on our side in this one.

215
0:11:21.703,000 --> 0:11:23,000
The bar to being a good guy is just so low.

216
0:11:25.386,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And massive numerical advantages do matter,

217
0:11:28.691,000 --> 0:11:3,000
even when a single bad guy can inflict grievous harm,

218
0:11:31.604,000 --> 0:11:32,000
because among many other things,

219
0:11:33.203,000 --> 0:11:35,000
they allow us to exploit the hell out of this:

220
0:11:35.743,000 --> 0:11:4,000
we have years and hopefully decades to prepare and prevent.

221
0:11:41.689,000 --> 0:11:44,000
The first person to try something awful -- and there will be somebody --

222
0:11:45.201,000 --> 0:11:46,000
may not even be born yet.

223
0:11:47.068,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Next, this needs to be an effort that spans society,

224
0:11:50.617,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and all of you need to be a part of it,

225
0:11:53.415,000 --> 0:11:57,000
because we cannot ask a tiny group of experts

226
0:11:57.609,000 --> 0:12:02,000
to be responsible for both containing and exploiting synthetic biology,

227
0:12:02.771,000 --> 0:12:05,000
because we already tried that with the financial system,

228
0:12:05.917,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and our stewards became massively corrupted

229
0:12:09.455,000 --> 0:12:11,000
as they figured out how they could cut corners,

230
0:12:11.725,000 --> 0:12:14,000
inflict massive, massive risks on the rest of us

231
0:12:14.76,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and privatize the gains,

232
0:12:16.701,000 --> 0:12:18,000
becoming repulsively wealthy

233
0:12:18.792,000 --> 0:12:2,000
while they stuck us with the $22 trillion bill.

234
0:12:22.723,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And more recently --

235
0:12:24.214,000 --> 0:12:26,000
(Applause)

236
0:12:26.468,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Are you the ones who have gotten the thank-you letters?

237
0:12:29.205,000 --> 0:12:3,000
I'm still waiting for mine.

238
0:12:30.527,000 --> 0:12:32,000
I just figured they were too busy to be grateful.

239
0:12:33.307,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And much more recently,

240
0:12:36.291,000 --> 0:12:39,000
online privacy started looming as a huge issue,

241
0:12:39.627,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and we basically outsourced it.

242
0:12:41.597,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And once again:

243
0:12:42.968,000 --> 0:12:44,000
privatized gains, socialized losses.

244
0:12:45.55,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Is anybody else sick of this pattern?

245
0:12:47.639,000 --> 0:12:51,000
(Applause)

246
0:12:52.286,000 --> 0:12:57,000
So we need a more inclusive way to safeguard our prosperity,

247
0:12:58.269,000 --> 0:12:59,000
our privacy

248
0:12:59.45,000 --> 0:13:,000
and soon, our lives.

249
0:13:01.24,000 --> 0:13:03,000
So how do we do all of this?

250
0:13:04.002,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Well, when bodies fight pathogens,

251
0:13:06.694,000 --> 0:13:08,000
they use ingenious immune systems,

252
0:13:09.116,000 --> 0:13:11,000
which are very complex and multilayered.

253
0:13:11.185,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Why don't we build one of these for the whole damn ecosystem?

254
0:13:14.147,000 --> 0:13:17,000
There's a year of TED Talks that could be given on this first critical layer.

255
0:13:17.839,000 --> 0:13:2,000
So these are just a couple of many great ideas that are out there.

256
0:13:21.343,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Some R and D muscle

257
0:13:23.353,000 --> 0:13:27,000
could take the very primitive pathogen sensors that we currently have

258
0:13:28.312,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and put them on a very steep price performance curve

259
0:13:31.159,000 --> 0:13:33,000
that would quickly become ingenious

260
0:13:33.313,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and networked

261
0:13:34.491,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and gradually as widespread as smoke detectors and even smartphones.

262
0:13:38.843,000 --> 0:13:39,000
On a very related note:

263
0:13:40.834,000 --> 0:13:42,000
vaccines have all kinds of problems

264
0:13:43.485,000 --> 0:13:46,000
when it comes to manufacturing and distribution,

265
0:13:46.53,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and once they're made, they can't adapt to new threats or mutations.

266
0:13:51.109,000 --> 0:13:53,000
We need an agile biomanufacturing base

267
0:13:53.952,000 --> 0:13:57,000
extending into every single pharmacy and maybe even our homes.

268
0:13:58.066,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Printer technology for vaccines and medicines is within reach

269
0:14:01.749,000 --> 0:14:02,000
if we prioritize it.

270
0:14:03.756,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Next, mental health.

271
0:14:05.85,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Many people who commit suicidal mass murder

272
0:14:08.729,000 --> 0:14:12,000
suffer from crippling, treatment-resistant depression or PTSD.

273
0:14:13.237,000 --> 0:14:17,000
We need noble researchers like Rick Doblin working on this,

274
0:14:17.332,000 --> 0:14:2,000
but we also need the selfish jerks who are way more numerous

275
0:14:21.294,000 --> 0:14:27,000
to appreciate the fact that acute suffering will soon endanger all of us,

276
0:14:27.338,000 --> 0:14:28,000
not just those afflicted.

277
0:14:29.092,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Those jerks will then join us and Al Capone

278
0:14:32.566,000 --> 0:14:34,000
in fighting this condition.

279
0:14:35.409,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Third, each and every one of us can be and should be a white blood cell

280
0:14:41.051,000 --> 0:14:42,000
in this immune system.

281
0:14:43.28,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Suicidal mass murderers can be despicable, yes,

282
0:14:46.779,000 --> 0:14:5,000
but they're also terribly broken and sad people,

283
0:14:50.912,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and those of us who aren't need to do what we can

284
0:14:53.356,000 --> 0:14:55,000
to make sure nobody goes unloved.

285
0:14:56.573,000 --> 0:15:,000
(Applause)

286
0:15:01.711,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Next, we need to make fighting these dangers

287
0:15:04.304,000 --> 0:15:06,000
core to the discipline of synthetic biology.

288
0:15:07.088,000 --> 0:15:09,000
There are companies out there that at least claim

289
0:15:09.479,000 --> 0:15:11,000
they let their engineers spend 20 percent of their time

290
0:15:12.405,000 --> 0:15:13,000
doing whatever they want.

291
0:15:13.823,000 --> 0:15:15,000
What if those who hire bioengineers

292
0:15:16.499,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and become them

293
0:15:17.691,000 --> 0:15:2,000
give 20 percent of their time to building defenses for the common good?

294
0:15:23.397,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Not a bad idea, right?

295
0:15:24.792,000 --> 0:15:25,000
(Applause)

296
0:15:26.034,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Then, finally: this won't be any fun.

297
0:15:28.698,000 --> 0:15:31,000
But we need to let our minds go to some very, very dark places,

298
0:15:32.669,000 --> 0:15:35,000
and thank you for letting me take you there this evening.

299
0:15:36.105,000 --> 0:15:38,000
We survived the Cold War

300
0:15:38.496,000 --> 0:15:42,000
because every one of us understood and respected the danger,

301
0:15:42.873,000 --> 0:15:44,000
in part, because we had spent decades

302
0:15:45.284,000 --> 0:15:47,000
telling ourselves terrifying ghost stories

303
0:15:47.785,000 --> 0:15:48,000
with names like "Dr. Strangelove"

304
0:15:49.769,000 --> 0:15:5,000
and "War Games."

305
0:15:51.408,000 --> 0:15:53,000
This is no time to remain calm.

306
0:15:53.728,000 --> 0:15:56,000
This is one of those rare times when it's incredibly productive

307
0:15:56.82,000 --> 0:15:58,000
to freak the hell out --

308
0:15:59.502,000 --> 0:16:01,000
(Laughter)

309
0:16:02.295,000 --> 0:16:04,000
to come up with some ghost stories

310
0:16:04.416,000 --> 0:16:08,000
and use our fear as fuel to fight this danger.

311
0:16:09.771,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Because, all these terrible scenarios I've painted --

312
0:16:13.849,000 --> 0:16:14,000
they are not destiny.

313
0:16:16.171,000 --> 0:16:17,000
They're optional.

314
0:16:18.012,000 --> 0:16:21,000
The danger is still kind of distant.

315
0:16:22.247,000 --> 0:16:24,000
And that means it will only befall us

316
0:16:25.034,000 --> 0:16:27,000
if we allow it to.

317
0:16:27.95,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Let's not.

318
0:16:29.168,000 --> 0:16:3,000
Thank you very much for listening.

319
0:16:30.908,000 --> 0:16:34,000
(Applause)

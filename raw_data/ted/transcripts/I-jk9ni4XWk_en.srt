1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Something called the Danish Twin Study

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
established that only about 10 percent

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
of how long the average person lives,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
within certain biological limits, is dictated by our genes.

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
The other 90 percent is dictated by our lifestyle.

6
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
So the premise of Blue Zones: if we can find the

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
optimal lifestyle of longevity

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
we can come up with a de facto formula

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
for longevity.

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
But if you ask the average American what the optimal formula

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
of longevity is, they probably couldn't tell you.

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
They've probably heard of the South Beach Diet, or the Atkins Diet.

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
You have the USDA food pyramid.

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
There is what Oprah tells us.

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
There is what Doctor Oz tells us.

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
The fact of the matter is there is a lot of confusion

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
around what really helps us live longer better.

18
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Should you be running marathons or doing yoga?

19
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Should you eat organic meats

20
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
or should you be eating tofu?

21
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
When it comes to supplements, should you be taking them?

22
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
How about these hormones or resveratrol?

23
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And does purpose play into it?

24
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Spirituality? And how about how we socialize?

25
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Well, our approach to finding longevity

26
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
was to team up with National Geographic,

27
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and the National Institute on Aging,

28
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
to find the four demographically confirmed areas

29
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that are geographically defined.

30
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And then bring a team of experts in there

31
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
to methodically go through exactly what these people do,

32
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
to distill down the cross-cultural distillation.

33
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And at the end of this I'm going to tell you what that distillation is.

34
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But first I'd like to debunk some common myths

35
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
when it comes to longevity.

36
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And the first myth is if you try really hard

37
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
you can live to be 100.

38
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
False.

39
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
The problem is, only about one out of 5,000 people

40
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
in America live to be 100.

41
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Your chances are very low.

42
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Even though it's the fastest growing demographic in America,

43
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
it's hard to reach 100.

44
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
The problem is

45
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that we're not programmed for longevity.

46
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
We are programmed for something called

47
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
procreative success.

48
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I love that word.

49
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
It reminds me of my college days.

50
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Biologists term procreative success to mean

51
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
the age where you have children

52
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and then another generation, the age when your children have children.

53
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
After that the effect of evolution

54
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
completely dissipates.

55
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
If you're a mammal, if you're a rat

56
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
or an elephant, or a human, in between, it's the same story.

57
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So to make it to age 100, you not only have to have

58
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
had a very good lifestyle, you also have to have won

59
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
the genetic lottery.

60
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
The second myth is,

61
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
there are treatments that can help slow,

62
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
reverse, or even stop aging.

63
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
False.

64
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
When you think of it, there is 99 things that can age us.

65
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes,

66
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
those brain cells die, they never come back.

67
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Play tennis too hard, on your knees, ruin your cartilage,

68
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
the cartilage never comes back.

69
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Our arteries can clog. Our brains can gunk up with plaque,

70
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and we can get Alzheimer's.

71
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
There is just too many things to go wrong.

72
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Our bodies have 35 trillion cells,

73
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
trillion with a "T." We're talking national debt numbers here.

74
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Laughter)

75
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Those cells turn themselves over once every eight years.

76
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And every time they turn themselves over

77
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
there is some damage. And that damage builds up.

78
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And it builds up exponentially.

79
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
It's a little bit like the days when we all had

80
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Beatles albums or Eagles albums

81
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and we'd make a copy of that on a cassette tape,

82
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and let our friends copy that cassette tape,

83
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and pretty soon, with successive generations

84
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that tape sounds like garbage.

85
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Well, the same things happen to our cells.

86
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
That's why a 65-year-old person

87
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
is aging at a rate of about

88
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
125 times faster

89
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
than a 12-year-old person.

90
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So, if there is nothing you can do

91
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
to slow your aging or stop your aging,

92
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
what am I doing here?

93
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Well, the fact of the matter is

94
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
the best science tells us that the capacity of the human body,

95
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
my body, your body,

96
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
is about 90 years,

97
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
a little bit more for women.

98
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
But life expectancy in this country

99
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
is only 78.

100
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So somewhere along the line,

101
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
we're leaving about 12 good years on the table.

102
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
These are years that we could get.

103
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease,

104
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
heart disease, cancer and diabetes.

105
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
We think the best way to get these missing years

106
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
is to look at the cultures around the world

107
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that are actually experiencing them,

108
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
areas where people are living to age 100

109
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
at rates up to 10 times greater than we are,

110
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
areas where the life expectancy

111
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
is an extra dozen years,

112
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
the rate of middle age mortality is a fraction

113
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
of what it is in this country.

114
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
We found our first Blue Zone about 125 miles

115
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
off the coast of Italy, on the island of Sardinia.

116
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And not the entire island, the island is about 1.4 million people,

117
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
but only up in the highlands, an area called the Nuoro province.

118
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And here we have this area where men live the longest,

119
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
about 10 times more centenarians than we have here in America.

120
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And this is a place where people not only reach age 100,

121
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
they do so with extraordinary vigor.

122
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Places where 102 year olds still ride their bike to work,

123
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
chop wood, and can beat a guy 60 years younger than them.

124
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
(Laughter)

125
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Their history actually goes back to about the time of Christ.

126
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It's actually a Bronze Age culture that's been isolated.

127
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Because the land is so infertile,

128
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
they largely are shepherds,

129
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
which occasions regular, low-intensity physical activity.

130
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Their diet is mostly plant-based,

131
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
accentuated with foods that they can carry into the fields.

132
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
They came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread

133
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
called carta musica made out of durum wheat,

134
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
a type of cheese made from grass-fed animals

135
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
so the cheese is high in Omega-3 fatty acids

136
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
instead of Omega-6 fatty acids from corn-fed animals,

137
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and a type of wine that has three times the level

138
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
of polyphenols than any known wine in the world.

139
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
It's called Cannonau.

140
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
But the real secret I think lies more

141
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
in the way that they organize their society.

142
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And one of the most salient elements of the Sardinian society

143
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
is how they treat older people.

144
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
You ever notice here in America, social equity

145
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
seems to peak at about age 24?

146
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Just look at the advertisements.

147
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Here in Sardinia, the older you get

148
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
the more equity you have,

149
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
the more wisdom you're celebrated for.

150
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
You go into the bars in Sardinia,

151
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
instead of seeing the Sports Illustrated swimsuit calendar,

152
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
you see the centenarian of the month calendar.

153
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
This, as it turns out, is not only good for your aging parents

154
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
to keep them close to the family --

155
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
it imparts about four to six years of extra life expectancy --

156
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
research shows it's also good for the children of those families,

157
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
who have lower rates of mortality and lower rates of disease.

158
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
That's called the grandmother effect.

159
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
We found our second Blue Zone

160
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
on the other side of the planet,

161
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
about 800 miles south of Tokyo,

162
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
on the archipelago of Okinawa.

163
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Okinawa is actually 161 small islands.

164
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And in the northern part of the main island,

165
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
this is ground zero for world longevity.

166
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
This is a place where the oldest living female population is found.

167
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
It's a place where people have the longest disability-free

168
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
life expectancy in the world.

169
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
They have what we want.

170
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
They live a long time, and tend to die in their sleep,

171
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
very quickly,

172
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and often, I can tell you, after sex.

173
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
They live about seven good years longer than the average American.

174
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
Five times as many centenarians as we have in America.

175
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
One fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer,

176
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
big killers here in America.

177
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And one sixth the rate of cardiovascular disease.

178
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And the fact that this culture has yielded these numbers

179
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
suggests strongly they have something to teach us.

180
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
What do they do?

181
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Once again, a plant-based diet,

182
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
full of vegetables with lots of color in them.

183
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And they eat about eight times as much tofu

184
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
as Americans do.

185
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
More significant than what they eat is how they eat it.

186
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
They have all kinds of little strategies

187
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
to keep from overeating,

188
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
which, as you know, is a big problem here in America.

189
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
A few of the strategies we observed:

190
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
they eat off of smaller plates, so they tend to eat fewer calories at every sitting.

191
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Instead of serving family style,

192
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
where you can sort of mindlessly eat as you're talking,

193
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
they serve at the counter, put the food away,

194
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and then bring it to the table.

195
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
They also have a 3,000-year-old adage,

196
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
which I think is the greatest sort of diet suggestion ever invented.

197
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
It was invented by Confucius.

198
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And that diet is known as the Hara, Hatchi, Bu diet.

199
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
It's simply a little saying these people say before their meal

200
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is [80] percent full.

201
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
It takes about a half hour for that full feeling

202
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
to travel from your belly to your brain.

203
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And by remembering to stop at 80 percent

204
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
it helps keep you from doing that very thing.

205
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
But, like Sardinia, Okinawa has a few social constructs

206
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
that we can associate with longevity.

207
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
We know that isolation kills.

208
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Fifteen years ago, the average American had three good friends.

209
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
We're down to one and half right now.

210
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
If you were lucky enough to be born in Okinawa,

211
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
you were born into a system where you

212
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
automatically have a half a dozen friends

213
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
with whom you travel through life.

214
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
They call it a Moai. And if you're in a Moai

215
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
you're expected to share the bounty if you encounter luck,

216
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and if things go bad,

217
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
child gets sick, parent dies,

218
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
you always have somebody who has your back.

219
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
This particular Moai, these five ladies

220
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
have been together for 97 years.

221
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Their average age is 102.

222
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Typically in America

223
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
we've divided our adult life up into two sections.

224
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
There is our work life,

225
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
where we're productive.

226
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And then one day, boom, we retire.

227
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And typically that has meant

228
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
retiring to the easy chair,

229
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
or going down to Arizona to play golf.

230
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
In the Okinawan language there is not even

231
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
a word for retirement.

232
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Instead there is one word

233
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
that imbues your entire life,

234
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and that word is "ikigai."

235
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And, roughly translated, it means

236
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
"the reason for which you wake up in the morning."

237
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
For this 102-year-old karate master,

238
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
his ikigai was carrying forth this martial art.

239
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
For this hundred-year-old fisherman

240
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
it was continuing to catch fish for his family three times a week.

241
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And this is a question. The National Institute on Aging

242
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
actually gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians.

243
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And one of the questions, they were very culturally astute,

244
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
the people who put the questionnaire.

245
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
One of the questions was, "What is your ikigai?"

246
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
They instantly knew why they woke up in the morning.

247
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
For this 102 year old woman, her ikigai

248
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
was simply her great-great-great-granddaughter.

249
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Two girls separated in age by 101 and a half years.

250
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And I asked her what it felt like

251
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
to hold a great-great-great-granddaughter.

252
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And she put her head back and she said,

253
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
"It feels like leaping into heaven."

254
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
I thought that was a wonderful thought.

255
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
My editor at Geographic

256
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
wanted me to find America's Blue Zone.

257
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And for a while we looked on the prairies of Minnesota,

258
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
where actually there is a very high proportion of centenarians.

259
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
But that's because all the young people left.

260
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
(Laughter)

261
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
So, we turned to the data again.

262
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And we found America's longest-lived population

263
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
among the Seventh-Day Adventists

264
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
concentrated in and around Loma Linda, California.

265
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Adventists are conservative Methodists.

266
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
They celebrate their Sabbath

267
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
from sunset on Friday till sunset on Saturday.

268
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
A "24-hour sanctuary in time," they call it.

269
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And they follow five little habits

270
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
that conveys to them extraordinary longevity,

271
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
comparatively speaking.

272
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
In America here, life expectancy

273
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
for the average woman is 80.

274
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
But for an Adventist woman,

275
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
their life expectancy is 89.

276
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And the difference is even more pronounced among men,

277
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
who are expected to live about 11 years

278
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
longer than their American counterparts.

279
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Now, this is a study that followed

280
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
about 70,000 people for 30 years.

281
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Sterling study. And I think it supremely illustrates

282
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
the premise of this Blue Zone project.

283
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
This is a heterogeneous community.

284
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
It's white, black, Hispanic, Asian.

285
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
The only thing that they have in common are a set of

286
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
very small lifestyle habits

287
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
that they follow ritualistically

288
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
for most of their lives.

289
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
They take their diet directly from the Bible.

290
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Genesis: Chapter one, Verse [29],

291
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
where God talks about legumes and seeds,

292
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and on one more stanza about green plants,

293
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
ostensibly missing is meat.

294
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
They take this sanctuary in time very serious.

295
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
For 24 hours every week,

296
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
no matter how busy they are, how stressed out they are at work,

297
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
where the kids need to be driven,

298
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
they stop everything and they focus on their God,

299
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
their social network, and then, hardwired right in the religion,

300
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
are nature walks.

301
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And the power of this is not that it's done occasionally,

302
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
the power is it's done every week for a lifetime.

303
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
None of it's hard. None of it costs money.

304
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Adventists also tend to hang out with other Adventists.

305
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
So, if you go to an Adventist's party

306
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
you don't see people swilling Jim Beam or rolling a joint.

307
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Instead they're talking about their next nature walk,

308
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
exchanging recipes, and yes, they pray.

309
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
But they influence each other in profound and measurable ways.

310
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
This is a culture that has yielded Ellsworth Whareham.

311
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Ellsworth Whareham is 97 years old.

312
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
He's a multimillionaire,

313
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
yet when a contractor wanted 6,000 dollars

314
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
to build a privacy fence,

315
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
he said, "For that kind of money I'll do it myself."

316
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
So for the next three days he was out shoveling cement,

317
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and hauling poles around.

318
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And predictably, perhaps, on the fourth day

319
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
he ended up in the operating room.

320
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
But not as the guy on the table;

321
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
the guy doing open-heart surgery.

322
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
At 97 he still does 20 open-heart surgeries every month.

323
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Ed Rawlings, 103 years old now,

324
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
an active cowboy, starts his morning with a swim.

325
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And on weekends he likes to put on the boards,

326
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
throw up rooster tails.

327
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
And then Marge Deton.

328
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
Marge is 104.

329
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Her grandson actually lives in the Twin Cities here.

330
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
She starts her day with lifting weights.

331
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
She rides her bicycle.

332
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
And then she gets in her root-beer colored

333
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
1994 Cadillac Seville,

334
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and tears down the San Bernardino freeway,

335
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
where she still volunteers for seven different organizations.

336
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
I've been on 19 hardcore expeditions.

337
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
I'm probably the only person you'll ever meet

338
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
who rode his bicycle across

339
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
the Sahara desert without sunscreen.

340
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
But I'll tell you, there is no adventure more harrowing

341
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
than riding shotgun with Marge Deton.

342
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
"A stranger is a friend I haven't met yet!" she'd say to me.

343
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
So, what are the common denominators

344
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
in these three cultures?

345
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
What are the things that they all do?

346
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
And we managed to boil it down to nine.

347
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
In fact we've done two more Blue Zone expeditions since this

348
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and these common denominators hold true.

349
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
And the first one,

350
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and I'm about to utter a heresy here,

351
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
none of them exercise,

352
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
at least the way we think of exercise.

353
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Instead, they set up their lives

354
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
so that they are constantly nudged into physical activity.

355
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
These 100-year-old Okinawan women

356
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
are getting up and down off the ground, they sit on the floor,

357
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
30 or 40 times a day.

358
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Sardinians live in vertical houses, up and down the stairs.

359
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Every trip to the store, or to church

360
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
or to a friend's house occasions a walk.

361
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
They don't have any conveniences.

362
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
There is not a button to push to do yard work or house work.

363
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
If they want to mix up a cake, they're doing it by hand.

364
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
That's physical activity.

365
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
That burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does.

366
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
When they do do intentional physical activity,

367
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
it's the things they enjoy. They tend to walk,

368
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
the only proven way to stave off cognitive decline,

369
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
and they all tend to have a garden.

370
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
They know how to set up their life in the right way

371
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
so they have the right outlook.

372
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
Each of these cultures take time to downshift.

373
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
The Sardinians pray. The Seventh-Day Adventists pray.

374
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
The Okinawans have this ancestor veneration.

375
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
But when you're in a hurry or stressed out,

376
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
that triggers something called the inflammatory response,

377
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
which is associated with everything from Alzheimer's

378
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
disease to cardiovascular disease.

379
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
When you slow down for 15 minutes a day

380
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
you turn that inflammatory state

381
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
into a more anti-inflammatory state.

382
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
They have vocabulary for sense of purpose,

383
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
ikigai, like the Okinawans.

384
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
You know the two most dangerous years in your life

385
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
are the year you're born, because of infant mortality,

386
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
and the year you retire.

387
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
These people know their sense of purpose,

388
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
and they activate in their life, that's worth about seven years

389
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
of extra life expectancy.

390
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
There's no longevity diet.

391
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
Instead, these people drink a little bit every day,

392
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
not a hard sell to the American population.

393
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
(Laughter)

394
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
They tend to eat a plant-based diet.

395
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
Doesn't mean they don't eat meat, but lots of beans and nuts.

396
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
And they have strategies to keep from overeating,

397
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
little things that nudge them away from the table at the right time.

398
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
And then the foundation of all this is how they connect.

399
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
They put their families first,

400
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
take care of their children and their aging parents.

401
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
They all tend to belong to a faith-based community,

402
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
which is worth between four and 14

403
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:13,000
extra years of life expectancy

404
0:18:13.26,000 --> 0:18:15,000
if you do it four times a month.

405
0:18:15.26,000 --> 0:18:17,000
And the biggest thing here

406
0:18:17.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
is they also belong to the right tribe.

407
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
They were either born into

408
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:27,000
or they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people.

409
0:18:27.26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
We know from the Framingham studies,

410
0:18:29.26,000 --> 0:18:32,000
that if your three best friends are obese

411
0:18:32.26,000 --> 0:18:35,000
there is a 50 percent better chance that you'll be overweight.

412
0:18:35.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
So, if you hang out with unhealthy people,

413
0:18:38.26,000 --> 0:18:4,000
that's going to have a measurable impact over time.

414
0:18:40.26,000 --> 0:18:45,000
Instead, if your friend's idea of recreation

415
0:18:45.26,000 --> 0:18:47,000
is physical activity, bowling, or playing hockey,

416
0:18:47.26,000 --> 0:18:49,000
biking or gardening,

417
0:18:49.26,000 --> 0:18:52,000
if your friends drink a little, but not too much,

418
0:18:52.26,000 --> 0:18:55,000
and they eat right, and they're engaged, and they're trusting and trustworthy,

419
0:18:55.26,000 --> 0:18:58,000
that is going to have the biggest impact over time.

420
0:18:58.26,000 --> 0:19:01,000
Diets don't work. No diet in the history of the world

421
0:19:01.26,000 --> 0:19:04,000
has ever worked for more than two percent of the population.

422
0:19:04.26,000 --> 0:19:07,000
Exercise programs usually start in January;

423
0:19:07.26,000 --> 0:19:09,000
they're usually done by October.

424
0:19:09.26,000 --> 0:19:11,000
When it comes to longevity

425
0:19:11.26,000 --> 0:19:13,000
there is no short term fix

426
0:19:13.26,000 --> 0:19:16,000
in a pill or anything else.

427
0:19:16.26,000 --> 0:19:18,000
But when you think about it,

428
0:19:18.26,000 --> 0:19:21,000
your friends are long-term adventures,

429
0:19:21.26,000 --> 0:19:24,000
and therefore, perhaps the most significant thing you can do

430
0:19:24.26,000 --> 0:19:27,000
to add more years to your life,

431
0:19:27.26,000 --> 0:19:29,000
and life to your years. Thank you very much.

432
0:19:29.26,000 --> 0:19:34,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.397,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm here today to talk about social change,

2
0:00:15.957,000 --> 0:00:18,000
not a new therapy or a new intervention

3
0:00:19.24,000 --> 0:00:21,000
or a new way of working with kids or something like that,

4
0:00:21.957,000 --> 0:00:23,000
but a new business model for social change,

5
0:00:24.902,000 --> 0:00:26,000
a new way of tackling the problem.

6
0:00:27.809,000 --> 0:00:31,000
In Britain, 63 percent of all men

7
0:00:31.983,000 --> 0:00:34,000
who come out of short sentences from prison

8
0:00:35.046,000 --> 0:00:37,000
re-offend again within a year.

9
0:00:37.567,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Now how many previous offenses

10
0:00:40.185,000 --> 0:00:42,000
do you think they have on average

11
0:00:42.568,000 --> 0:00:44,000
managed to commit?

12
0:00:45.153,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Forty-three.

13
0:00:47.301,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And how many previous times do you think they've been in prison?

14
0:00:50.964,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Seven.

15
0:00:52.151,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So we went to talk to the Ministry of Justice,

16
0:00:54.965,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and we said to the Ministry of Justice,

17
0:00:56.853,000 --> 0:00:58,000
what's it worth to you

18
0:00:59.205,000 --> 0:01:01,000
if fewer of these guys re-offend?

19
0:01:01.382,000 --> 0:01:03,000
It's got to be worth something, right?

20
0:01:03.551,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I mean, there's prison costs,

21
0:01:05.378,000 --> 0:01:08,000
there's police costs, there's court costs,

22
0:01:08.906,000 --> 0:01:1,000
all these things that you're spending money on

23
0:01:11.638,000 --> 0:01:13,000
to deal with these guys. What's it worth?

24
0:01:14.151,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Now, of course, we care about the social value.

25
0:01:17.146,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Social Finance, the organization I helped set up,

26
0:01:20.432,000 --> 0:01:22,000
cares about social stuff.

27
0:01:22.675,000 --> 0:01:25,000
But we wanted to make the economic case,

28
0:01:25.717,000 --> 0:01:26,000
because if we could make the economic case,

29
0:01:27.495,000 --> 0:01:3,000
then the value of doing this would be completely compelling.

30
0:01:30.516,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And if we can agree on both a value

31
0:01:33.351,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and a way of measuring whether we've been

32
0:01:35.688,000 --> 0:01:37,000
successful at reducing that re-offending,

33
0:01:38.086,000 --> 0:01:39,000
then we can do something

34
0:01:40.057,000 --> 0:01:42,000
we think rather interesting.

35
0:01:42.62,000 --> 0:01:45,000
The idea is called the social impact bond.

36
0:01:46.544,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Now, the social impact bond is simply saying,

37
0:01:48.921,000 --> 0:01:49,000
if we can get the government to agree,

38
0:01:50.56,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that we can create a contract where

39
0:01:53.311,000 --> 0:01:56,000
they only pay if it worked.

40
0:01:56.77,000 --> 0:01:59,000
So that means that they can try out new stuff

41
0:01:59.939,000 --> 0:02:,000
without the embarrassment

42
0:02:01.402,000 --> 0:02:03,000
of having to pay if it didn't work,

43
0:02:03.41,000 --> 0:02:04,000
which for still quite a lot of bits of government,

44
0:02:05.082,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that's a serious issue.

45
0:02:06.429,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Now, many of you may have noticed

46
0:02:08.024,000 --> 0:02:09,000
there's a problem at this point,

47
0:02:09.51,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and that is that it takes a long time to measure

48
0:02:11.724,000 --> 0:02:13,000
whether those outcomes have happened.

49
0:02:14.49,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So we have to raise some money.

50
0:02:17.706,000 --> 0:02:19,000
We use the contract to raise money

51
0:02:20.153,000 --> 0:02:22,000
from socially motivated investors.

52
0:02:22.377,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Socially motivated investors:

53
0:02:24.731,000 --> 0:02:26,000
there's an interesting idea, right?

54
0:02:27.029,000 --> 0:02:29,000
But actually, there's a lot of people who,

55
0:02:29.42,000 --> 0:02:3,000
if they're given the chance,

56
0:02:30.653,000 --> 0:02:31,000
would love to invest in something

57
0:02:32.535,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that does social good.

58
0:02:35.298,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And here's the opportunity.

59
0:02:37.271,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Do you want to also help government find

60
0:02:39.528,000 --> 0:02:41,000
whether there's a better economic model,

61
0:02:41.964,000 --> 0:02:43,000
not just leaving these guys to come out of prison

62
0:02:44.34,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and waiting till they re-offend and putting them back in again,

63
0:02:47.211,000 --> 0:02:48,000
but actually working with them

64
0:02:48.768,000 --> 0:02:49,000
to move to a different path

65
0:02:50.327,000 --> 0:02:52,000
to end up with fewer crimes

66
0:02:52.926,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and fewer victims?

67
0:02:54.941,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So we find some investors,

68
0:02:57.452,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and they pay for a set of services,

69
0:02:59.822,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and if those services are successful,

70
0:03:02.087,000 --> 0:03:04,000
then they improve outcomes,

71
0:03:04.58,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and with those measured reductions in re-offending,

72
0:03:07.221,000 --> 0:03:08,000
government saves money,

73
0:03:08.296,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and with those savings,

74
0:03:09.833,000 --> 0:03:11,000
they can pay outcomes.

75
0:03:12.287,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And the investors do not just get their money back,

76
0:03:14.463,000 --> 0:03:16,000
but they make a return.

77
0:03:16.471,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So in March 2010, we signed

78
0:03:18.912,000 --> 0:03:2,000
the first social impact bond

79
0:03:20.932,000 --> 0:03:21,000
with the Ministry of Justice

80
0:03:22.759,000 --> 0:03:24,000
around Peterborough Prison.

81
0:03:24.796,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It was to work with 3,000 offenders

82
0:03:27.82,000 --> 0:03:29,000
split into three cohorts of 1,000 each.

83
0:03:30.748,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Now, each of those cohorts

84
0:03:32.737,000 --> 0:03:33,000
would get measured over the two years

85
0:03:34.568,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that they were coming out of prison.

86
0:03:35.77,000 --> 0:03:37,000
They've got to have a year to commit their crimes,

87
0:03:37.825,000 --> 0:03:39,000
six months to get through the court system,

88
0:03:40.37,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and then they would be compared to a group

89
0:03:42.765,000 --> 0:03:44,000
taken from the police national computer,

90
0:03:44.833,000 --> 0:03:45,000
as similar as possible,

91
0:03:46.66,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and we would get paid

92
0:03:48.194,000 --> 0:03:5,000
providing we achieved a hurdle rate of 10-percent reduction,

93
0:03:50.983,000 --> 0:03:53,000
for every conviction event that didn't happen.

94
0:03:54.541,000 --> 0:03:57,000
So we get paid for crimes saved.

95
0:03:58.018,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Now if we achieved that 10-percent reduction

96
0:04:02.122,000 --> 0:04:03,000
across all three cohorts,

97
0:04:03.807,000 --> 0:04:06,000
then the investors get a seven and a half percent

98
0:04:06.947,000 --> 0:04:08,000
annualized return on their investment,

99
0:04:09.09,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and if we do better than that,

100
0:04:10.63,000 --> 0:04:11,000
they can get up to 13 percent

101
0:04:12.226,000 --> 0:04:14,000
annualized return on their investment,

102
0:04:14.759,000 --> 0:04:16,000
which is okay.

103
0:04:16.877,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So everyone wins here, right?

104
0:04:20.085,000 --> 0:04:22,000
The Ministry of Justice can try out a new program

105
0:04:22.8,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and they only pay if it works.

106
0:04:25.243,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Investors get two opportunities:

107
0:04:27.655,000 --> 0:04:3,000
for the first time, they can invest in social change.

108
0:04:30.711,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Also, they make a reasonable return,

109
0:04:32.742,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and they also know that

110
0:04:34.915,000 --> 0:04:36,000
first investors in these kinds of things,

111
0:04:37.187,000 --> 0:04:38,000
they're going to have to believers.

112
0:04:38.844,000 --> 0:04:4,000
They're going to have to care in the social program,

113
0:04:40.947,000 --> 0:04:41,000
but if this builds a track record

114
0:04:42.939,000 --> 0:04:43,000
over five or 10 years,

115
0:04:44.387,000 --> 0:04:46,000
then you can widen that investor community

116
0:04:46.451,000 --> 0:04:48,000
as more people have confidence in the product.

117
0:04:48.907,000 --> 0:04:5,000
The service providers, well, for the first time,

118
0:04:51.095,000 --> 0:04:53,000
they've got an opportunity to provide services

119
0:04:53.954,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and grow the evidence for what they're doing

120
0:04:56.181,000 --> 0:04:58,000
in a really constructive way and learn

121
0:04:58.741,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and demonstrate the value of what they're doing

122
0:05:00.563,000 --> 0:05:02,000
over five or six years, not just one or two

123
0:05:02.582,000 --> 0:05:03,000
as often happens at the moment.

124
0:05:04.423,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Society wins: fewer crimes, fewer victims.

125
0:05:07.901,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Now, the offenders, they also benefit.

126
0:05:10.727,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Instead of just coming out of the prison

127
0:05:12.157,000 --> 0:05:13,000
with 46 pounds in their pocket,

128
0:05:14.081,000 --> 0:05:15,000
half of them not knowing where they're spending

129
0:05:15.58,000 --> 0:05:17,000
their first night out of jail,

130
0:05:17.718,000 --> 0:05:19,000
actually, someone meets them in prison,

131
0:05:20.637,000 --> 0:05:21,000
learns about their issues,

132
0:05:22.501,000 --> 0:05:23,000
meets them at the gate,

133
0:05:24.42,000 --> 0:05:26,000
takes them through to somewhere to stay,

134
0:05:27.173,000 --> 0:05:29,000
connects them to benefits, connects them to employment,

135
0:05:29.591,000 --> 0:05:31,000
drug rehabilitation, mental health,

136
0:05:31.659,000 --> 0:05:32,000
whatever's needed.

137
0:05:33.389,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So let's think of another example:

138
0:05:36.068,000 --> 0:05:37,000
working with children in care.

139
0:05:37.958,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Social impact bonds work great

140
0:05:39.582,000 --> 0:05:41,000
for any area where there is at the moment

141
0:05:42.243,000 --> 0:05:44,000
very expensive provision that produces

142
0:05:44.642,000 --> 0:05:45,000
poor outcomes for people.

143
0:05:46.216,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So children in the state care

144
0:05:48.13,000 --> 0:05:5,000
tend to do very badly.

145
0:05:50.565,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Only 13 percent achieve a reasonable level

146
0:05:54.49,000 --> 0:05:56,000
of five GCSEs at 16,

147
0:05:57.389,000 --> 0:05:59,000
against 58 percent of the wider population.

148
0:05:59.859,000 --> 0:06:02,000
More troublingly, 27 percent of offenders in prison

149
0:06:03.518,000 --> 0:06:05,000
have spent some time in care.

150
0:06:05.559,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And even more worryingly,

151
0:06:06.851,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and this is a Home Office statistic,

152
0:06:08.823,000 --> 0:06:09,000
70 percent of prostitutes

153
0:06:10.723,000 --> 0:06:12,000
have spent some time in care.

154
0:06:12.907,000 --> 0:06:15,000
The state is not a great parent.

155
0:06:15.907,000 --> 0:06:17,000
But there are great programs

156
0:06:18.732,000 --> 0:06:21,000
for adolescents who are on the edge of care,

157
0:06:21.744,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and 30 percent of kids going into care

158
0:06:23.62,000 --> 0:06:24,000
are adolescents.

159
0:06:25.279,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So we set up a program with Essex County Council

160
0:06:28.119,000 --> 0:06:31,000
to test out intensive family therapeutic support

161
0:06:31.765,000 --> 0:06:34,000
for those families with adolescents

162
0:06:34.805,000 --> 0:06:35,000
on the edge of the care system.

163
0:06:36.376,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Essex only pays in the event

164
0:06:39.162,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that it's saving them care costs.

165
0:06:41.944,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Investors have put in 3.1 million pounds.

166
0:06:44.708,000 --> 0:06:46,000
That program started last month.

167
0:06:46.966,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Others, around homelessness in London,

168
0:06:49.29,000 --> 0:06:52,000
around youth and employment and education

169
0:06:53.17,000 --> 0:06:54,000
elsewhere in the country.

170
0:06:54.537,000 --> 0:06:57,000
There are now 13 social impact bonds in Britain,

171
0:06:57.892,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and amazing levels of interest in this idea

172
0:07:00.367,000 --> 0:07:01,000
all over the world.

173
0:07:01.89,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So David Cameron's put 20 million pounds

174
0:07:04.605,000 --> 0:07:07,000
into a social outcomes fund to support this idea.

175
0:07:07.855,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Obama has suggested 300 million dollars

176
0:07:11.035,000 --> 0:07:14,000
in the U.S. budget for these kinds of ideas

177
0:07:14.568,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and structures to move it forward,

178
0:07:16.254,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and a lot of other countries

179
0:07:17.745,000 --> 0:07:19,000
are demonstrating considerable interest.

180
0:07:19.962,000 --> 0:07:21,000
So what's caused this excitement?

181
0:07:22.018,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Why is this so different for people?

182
0:07:24.537,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Well, the first piece, which we've talked about,

183
0:07:27.029,000 --> 0:07:28,000
is innovation.

184
0:07:28.247,000 --> 0:07:31,000
It enables testing of new ideas

185
0:07:31.445,000 --> 0:07:34,000
in a way that's less difficult for everybody.

186
0:07:35.038,000 --> 0:07:37,000
The second piece it brings is rigor.

187
0:07:37.674,000 --> 0:07:4,000
By working to outcomes, people really have to test

188
0:07:40.967,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and bring data into the situation that one's dealing with.

189
0:07:44.845,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So taking Peterborough as an example,

190
0:07:47.338,000 --> 0:07:49,000
we add case management

191
0:07:49.561,000 --> 0:07:51,000
across all of the different organizations that we're working with

192
0:07:52.217,000 --> 0:07:53,000
so they know

193
0:07:53.502,000 --> 0:07:55,000
what actually has been done with different prisoners,

194
0:07:55.651,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and at the same time they learn

195
0:07:57.72,000 --> 0:07:59,000
from the Ministry of Justice, and we learn,

196
0:08:00.146,000 --> 0:08:01,000
because we pushed for the data,

197
0:08:01.881,000 --> 0:08:03,000
what actually happens, whether they get re-arrested or not.

198
0:08:04.088,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And we learn and adapt the program accordingly.

199
0:08:07.376,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And this leads to the third element, which is new,

200
0:08:10.313,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and that's flexibility.

201
0:08:12.415,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Because normal contracting for things,

202
0:08:15.528,000 --> 0:08:17,000
when you're spending government money,

203
0:08:17.589,000 --> 0:08:19,000
you're spending our money, tax money,

204
0:08:20.1,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and the people who are in charge of that are very aware of it

205
0:08:22.797,000 --> 0:08:25,000
so the temptation is to control exactly how you spend it.

206
0:08:26.647,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Now any entrepreneur in the room knows

207
0:08:29.7,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that version 1.0, the business plan,

208
0:08:31.797,000 --> 0:08:33,000
is not the one that generally works.

209
0:08:34.644,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So when you're trying to do something like this,

210
0:08:36.947,000 --> 0:08:38,000
you need the flexibility to adapt the program.

211
0:08:39.64,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And again, in Peterborough, we started off

212
0:08:42.352,000 --> 0:08:46,000
with a program, but we also collected data,

213
0:08:46.509,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and over the period of time,

214
0:08:48.386,000 --> 0:08:5,000
we nuanced and changed that program

215
0:08:50.584,000 --> 0:08:52,000
to add a range of other elements,

216
0:08:53.204,000 --> 0:08:54,000
so that the service adapts

217
0:08:54.969,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and we meet the needs of the long term

218
0:08:57.47,000 --> 0:08:59,000
as well as the short term:

219
0:08:59.534,000 --> 0:09:02,000
greater engagement from the prisoners,

220
0:09:02.643,000 --> 0:09:04,000
longer-term engagement as well.

221
0:09:05.422,000 --> 0:09:07,000
The last element is partnership.

222
0:09:07.958,000 --> 0:09:1,000
There is, at the moment, a stale debate going on very often:

223
0:09:11.135,000 --> 0:09:13,000
state's better, public sector's better,

224
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
private sector's better, social sector's better,

225
0:09:16.771,000 --> 0:09:17,000
for a lot of these programs.

226
0:09:18.439,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Actually, for creating social change,

227
0:09:20.421,000 --> 0:09:21,000
we need to bring in the expertise

228
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
from all of those parties

229
0:09:23.856,000 --> 0:09:24,000
in order to make this work.

230
0:09:25.444,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And this creates a structure

231
0:09:27.487,000 --> 0:09:28,000
through which they can combine.

232
0:09:29.462,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So where does this leave us?

233
0:09:31.394,000 --> 0:09:32,000
This leaves us with a way

234
0:09:33.228,000 --> 0:09:35,000
that people can invest in social change.

235
0:09:36.215,000 --> 0:09:38,000
We've met thousands, possibly millions of people,

236
0:09:39.202,000 --> 0:09:41,000
who want the opportunity to invest in social change.

237
0:09:41.635,000 --> 0:09:44,000
We've met champions all over the public sector

238
0:09:44.724,000 --> 0:09:46,000
keen to make these kinds of differences.

239
0:09:47.139,000 --> 0:09:48,000
With this kind of model,

240
0:09:48.924,000 --> 0:09:49,000
we can help bring them together.

241
0:09:50.86,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Thank you.

242
0:09:52.822,000 --> 0:09:56,000
(Applause)

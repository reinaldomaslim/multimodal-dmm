0:00:13.185,000 --> 0:00:13,000
[Ojibwe: Hello.

2
0:00:14.043,000 --> 0:00:17,000
My English name is Tara; my Native name is Zhaabowekwe.

3
0:00:17.916,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I am of Couchiching First Nation; my clan is bear.

4
0:00:20.453,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I was born under the Maple Sapping Moon.]

5
0:00:23.211,000 --> 0:00:24,000
My name is Tara Houska,

6
0:00:24.68,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I'm bear clan from Couchiching First Nation,

7
0:00:27.109,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I was born under the Maple Sapping Moon in International Falls, Minnesota,

8
0:00:31.18,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and I'm happy to be here with all of you.

9
0:00:33.189,000 --> 0:00:37,000
(Applause)

10
0:00:39.155,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Trauma of indigenous peoples has trickled through the generations.

11
0:00:43.403,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Centuries of oppression, of isolation, of invisibility,

12
0:00:48.128,000 --> 0:00:5,000
have led to a muddled understanding of who we are today.

13
0:00:51.089,000 --> 0:00:55,000
In 2017, we face this mixture of Indians in headdresses

14
0:00:55.709,000 --> 0:00:56,000
going across the plains

15
0:00:57.558,000 --> 0:01:,000
but also the drunk sitting on a porch somewhere you never heard of,

16
0:01:00.765,000 --> 0:01:03,000
living off government handouts and casino money.

17
0:01:06.587,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Sighs)

18
0:01:07.626,000 --> 0:01:08,000
It's really, really hard.

19
0:01:09.358,000 --> 0:01:11,000
It's very, very difficult to be in these shoes,

20
0:01:12.018,000 --> 0:01:17,000
to stand here as a product of genocide survival, of genocide.

21
0:01:19.239,000 --> 0:01:23,000
We face this constant barrage of unteaching the accepted narrative.

22
0:01:23.634,000 --> 0:01:27,000
87 percent of references in textbooks, children's textbooks, to Native Americans

23
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
are pre-1900s.

24
0:01:30.007,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Only half of the US states mention more than a single tribe,

25
0:01:34.238,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and just four states mention the boarding-school era,

26
0:01:37.211,000 --> 0:01:41,000
the era that was responsible for my grandmother

27
0:01:41.291,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and her brothers and sisters

28
0:01:42.655,000 --> 0:01:44,000
having their language and culture beaten out of them.

29
0:01:45.826,000 --> 0:01:47,000
When you aren't viewed as real people,

30
0:01:48.391,000 --> 0:01:51,000
it's a lot easier to run over your rights.

31
0:01:52.587,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Four years ago, I moved to Washington, DC.

32
0:01:55.05,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I had finished school and I was there to be a tribal attorney

33
0:01:57.933,000 --> 0:02:,000
and represent tribes across the nation, representing on the Hill,

34
0:02:01.749,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and I saw immediately why racist imagery matters.

35
0:02:04.606,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I moved there during football season, of all times.

36
0:02:08.162,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And so it was the daily slew of Indian heads

37
0:02:11.394,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and this "redskin" slur everywhere,

38
0:02:14.56,000 --> 0:02:16,000
while my job was going up on the Hill

39
0:02:17.437,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and trying to lobby for hospitals, for funding for schools,

40
0:02:21.239,000 --> 0:02:22,000
for basic government services,

41
0:02:23.073,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and being told again and again

42
0:02:25.166,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that Indian people were incapable of managing our own affairs.

43
0:02:29.068,000 --> 0:02:31,000
When you aren't viewed as real people,

44
0:02:31.492,000 --> 0:02:33,000
it's a lot easier to run over your rights.

45
0:02:36.645,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And last August, I went out to Standing Rock Sioux Reservation.

46
0:02:40.995,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I saw resistance happening.

47
0:02:42.867,000 --> 0:02:43,000
We were standing up.

48
0:02:44.811,000 --> 0:02:48,000
There were youth that had run 2,000 miles from Cannonball, North Dakota

49
0:02:49.215,000 --> 0:02:53,000
all the way out to Washington, DC, with a message for President Obama:

50
0:02:53.428,000 --> 0:02:54,000
"Please intervene.

51
0:02:54.992,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Please do something.

52
0:02:56.473,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Help us."

53
0:02:59.174,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And I went out, and I heard the call,

54
0:03:01.667,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and so did thousands of people around the world.

55
0:03:04.683,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Why did this resonate with so many people?

56
0:03:07.304,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Indigenous peoples are impacted first and worst by climate change.

57
0:03:12.135,000 --> 0:03:16,000
We are impacted first and worst by the fossil-fuel industry.

58
0:03:16.691,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Here in Louisiana, the first US climate change refugees exist.

59
0:03:20.434,000 --> 0:03:21,000
They are Native people

60
0:03:21.818,000 --> 0:03:23,000
being pushed off their homelands from rising sea levels.

61
0:03:25.194,000 --> 0:03:26,000
That's our reality, that's what we live.

62
0:03:27.125,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And with these projects comes a slew of human costs

63
0:03:30.847,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that people don't think about:

64
0:03:32.718,000 --> 0:03:36,000
thousands of workers influxing to build these pipelines,

65
0:03:36.797,000 --> 0:03:39,000
to build and extract from the earth,

66
0:03:40.508,000 --> 0:03:43,000
bringing crime and sex trafficking and violence with them.

67
0:03:44.973,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Missing and murdered indigenous women in Canada

68
0:03:47.228,000 --> 0:03:49,000
has become so significant it's spawned a movement

69
0:03:50.228,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and a national inquiry.

70
0:03:52.147,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Thousands of Native women who have disappeared,

71
0:03:55.03,000 --> 0:03:56,000
who have been murdered.

72
0:03:56.878,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And here in the US, we don't even track that.

73
0:04:00.729,000 --> 0:04:02,000
We are instead left with an understanding

74
0:04:03.131,000 --> 0:04:05,000
that our Supreme Court, the United States Supreme Court,

75
0:04:06.042,000 --> 0:04:1,000
stripped us, in 1978, of the right to prosecute at the same rate

76
0:04:10.624,000 --> 0:04:12,000
as anywhere else in the United States.

77
0:04:13.236,000 --> 0:04:17,000
So as a non-Native person you can walk onto a reservation and rape someone

78
0:04:17.383,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and that tribe is without the same level

79
0:04:19.43,000 --> 0:04:22,000
of prosecutorial ability as everywhere else,

80
0:04:22.508,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and the Federal Government declines these cases 40 percent of the time.

81
0:04:26.247,000 --> 0:04:29,000
It used to be 76 percent of the time.

82
0:04:30.045,000 --> 0:04:32,000
One in three Native women are raped in her lifetime.

83
0:04:33.311,000 --> 0:04:34,000
One in three.

84
0:04:35.711,000 --> 0:04:4,000
But in Standing Rock, you could feel the energy in the air.

85
0:04:41.968,000 --> 0:04:43,000
You could feel the resistance happening.

86
0:04:44.56,000 --> 0:04:47,000
People were standing and saying, "No more.

87
0:04:48.15,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Enough is enough.

88
0:04:49.854,000 --> 0:04:51,000
We will put our bodies in front of the machines

89
0:04:52.069,000 --> 0:04:53,000
to stop this project from happening.

90
0:04:53.889,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Our lives matter.

91
0:04:55.528,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Our children's lives matter."

92
0:04:58.483,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And thousands of allies came to stand with us from around the world.

93
0:05:02.126,000 --> 0:05:07,000
It was incredible, it was incredible to stand together, united as one.

94
0:05:08.464,000 --> 0:05:14,000
(Applause)

95
0:05:16.805,000 --> 0:05:18,000
In my time there,

96
0:05:19.122,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I saw Natives being chased on horseback by police officers shooting at them,

97
0:05:24.044,000 --> 0:05:26,000
history playing out in front of my eyes.

98
0:05:27.813,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I myself was put into a dog kennel when I was arrested.

99
0:05:30.569,000 --> 0:05:33,000
But funny story, actually, of being put into a dog kennel.

100
0:05:34.307,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So we're in this big wire kennel with all these people,

101
0:05:37.594,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and the police officers are there and we're there,

102
0:05:41.238,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and we start howling like dogs.

103
0:05:43.063,000 --> 0:05:46,000
You're going to treat us like dogs? We're going to act like dogs.

104
0:05:46.805,000 --> 0:05:47,000
But that's the resilience we have.

105
0:05:49.334,000 --> 0:05:51,000
All these horrific images playing out in front of us,

106
0:05:52.303,000 --> 0:05:56,000
being an indigenous person pushed off of Native lands again in 2017.

107
0:05:57.2,000 --> 0:05:59,000
But there was such beauty.

108
0:05:59.368,000 --> 0:06:02,000
On one of the days that we faced a line of hundreds of police officers

109
0:06:02.718,000 --> 0:06:05,000
pushing us back, pushing us off indigenous lands,

110
0:06:06.439,000 --> 0:06:09,000
there were those teenagers out on horseback across the plains.

111
0:06:10.744,000 --> 0:06:13,000
They were herding hundreds of buffalo towards us,

112
0:06:14.062,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and we were crying out, calling, "Please turn, please turn."

113
0:06:18.262,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And we watched the buffalo come towards us,

114
0:06:20.287,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and for a moment, everything stopped.

115
0:06:22.178,000 --> 0:06:24,000
The police stopped, we stopped,

116
0:06:24.736,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and we just saw this beautiful, amazing moment of remembrance.

117
0:06:31.711,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And we were empowered. We were so empowered.

118
0:06:34.115,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I interviewed a woman who had, on one day --

119
0:06:37.65,000 --> 0:06:38,000
September 2nd,

120
0:06:39.176,000 --> 0:06:41,000
the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation had told the courts --

121
0:06:41.916,000 --> 0:06:42,000
there's an ongoing lawsuit right now --

122
0:06:43.812,000 --> 0:06:44,000
they told the courts,

123
0:06:46.247,000 --> 0:06:49,000
"Here is a sacred site that's in the direct path of the pipeline."

124
0:06:50.826,000 --> 0:06:51,000
On September 3rd, the following day,

125
0:06:52.78,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Dakota Access, LLC skipped 25 miles ahead in its construction,

126
0:06:56.106,000 --> 0:06:57,000
to destroy that site.

127
0:06:58.363,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And when that happened, the people in camp rushed up to stop this,

128
0:07:02.664,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and they were met with attack dogs,

129
0:07:05.475,000 --> 0:07:09,000
people, private security officers, wielding attack dogs in [2016].

130
0:07:11.034,000 --> 0:07:12,000
But I interviewed one of the women,

131
0:07:12.941,000 --> 0:07:14,000
who had been bitten on the breast by one of these dogs,

132
0:07:15.917,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and the ferocity and strength of her

133
0:07:19.156,000 --> 0:07:2,000
was incredible,

134
0:07:20.331,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and she's out right now in another resistance camp,

135
0:07:22.737,000 --> 0:07:23,000
the same resistance camp I'm part of,

136
0:07:24.602,000 --> 0:07:27,000
fighting Line 3, another pipeline project in my people's homelands,

137
0:07:28.568,000 --> 0:07:32,000
wanting 900,000 barrels of tar sands per day

138
0:07:32.998,000 --> 0:07:35,000
through the headwaters of the Mississippi to the shore of Lake Superior

139
0:07:36.402,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and through all the Treaty territories along the way.

140
0:07:38.975,000 --> 0:07:41,000
But this woman's out there and we're all out there standing together,

141
0:07:42.316,000 --> 0:07:44,000
because we are resilient, we are fierce,

142
0:07:44.46,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and we are teaching people how to reconnect to the earth,

143
0:07:48.35,000 --> 0:07:5,000
remembering where we come from.

144
0:07:50.698,000 --> 0:07:52,000
So much of society has forgotten this.

145
0:07:52.889,000 --> 0:07:56,000
(Applause)

146
0:07:57.04,000 --> 0:07:59,000
That food you eat comes from somewhere.

147
0:07:59.763,000 --> 0:08:02,000
The tap water you drink comes from somewhere.

148
0:08:03.255,000 --> 0:08:05,000
We're trying to remember, teach,

149
0:08:05.381,000 --> 0:08:07,000
because we know, we still remember.

150
0:08:07.445,000 --> 0:08:1,000
It's in our plants, in our medicines, in our lives,

151
0:08:10.566,000 --> 0:08:11,000
every single day.

152
0:08:12.447,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I brought this out to show.

153
0:08:14.296,000 --> 0:08:15,000
(Rattling)

154
0:08:15.321,000 --> 0:08:17,000
This is cultural survival.

155
0:08:17.86,000 --> 0:08:19,000
This is from a time that it was illegal

156
0:08:20.199,000 --> 0:08:23,000
to practice indigenous cultures in the United States.

157
0:08:23.289,000 --> 0:08:25,000
This was cultural survival hidden in plain sight.

158
0:08:27.003,000 --> 0:08:28,000
This was a baby's rattle.

159
0:08:28.663,000 --> 0:08:3,000
That's what they told the Indian agents when they came in.

160
0:08:31.481,000 --> 0:08:32,000
It was a baby's rattle.

161
0:08:36.516,000 --> 0:08:38,000
But it's incredible what you can do when you stand together.

162
0:08:39.453,000 --> 0:08:42,000
It's incredible, the power that we have when we stand together,

163
0:08:42.492,000 --> 0:08:45,000
human resistance, people having this power,

164
0:08:45.607,000 --> 0:08:47,000
some of the most oppressed people you can possibly imagine

165
0:08:48.347,000 --> 0:08:51,000
costing this company hundreds of millions of dollars,

166
0:08:51.769,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and now our divestment efforts, focusing on the banks behind these projects,

167
0:08:55.775,000 --> 0:08:57,000
costing them billions of dollars.

168
0:08:58.657,000 --> 0:09:,000
Five billion dollars we've cost them so far,

169
0:09:01.136,000 --> 0:09:02,000
hanging out with banks.

170
0:09:02.311,000 --> 0:09:06,000
(Applause)

171
0:09:07.235,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So what can you do?

172
0:09:08.784,000 --> 0:09:09,000
How can you help?

173
0:09:10.186,000 --> 0:09:11,000
How can you change the conversation

174
0:09:11.878,000 --> 0:09:13,000
for extremely oppressed and forgotten people?

175
0:09:15.358,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Education is foundational.

176
0:09:18.642,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Education shapes our children. It shapes the way we teach.

177
0:09:21.429,000 --> 0:09:22,000
It shapes the way we learn.

178
0:09:23.423,000 --> 0:09:24,000
In Washington State,

179
0:09:25.23,000 --> 0:09:29,000
they've made the teaching of treaties and modern Native people

180
0:09:29.842,000 --> 0:09:31,000
mandatory in school curriculum.

181
0:09:31.96,000 --> 0:09:32,000
That is systems change.

182
0:09:33.611,000 --> 0:09:35,000
(Applause)

183
0:09:36.064,000 --> 0:09:38,000
When your elected officials are appropriating their budgets,

184
0:09:39.017,000 --> 0:09:42,000
ask them: Are you fulfilling treaty obligations?

185
0:09:43.031,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Treaties have been broken since the day they were signed.

186
0:09:45.999,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Are you meeting those requirements?

187
0:09:47.76,000 --> 0:09:5,000
That would change our lives, if treaties were actually upheld.

188
0:09:51.531,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Those documents were signed.

189
0:09:53.032,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Somehow, we live in this world where, in 2017,

190
0:09:56.12,000 --> 0:09:59,000
the US Constitution is held up as the supreme law of the land, right?

191
0:09:59.384,000 --> 0:10:01,000
But when I talk about treaty rights, I'm crazy.

192
0:10:01.6,000 --> 0:10:02,000
That's crazy.

193
0:10:02.775,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Treaties are the supreme law of the land,

194
0:10:04.768,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and that would change so much,

195
0:10:08.498,000 --> 0:10:11,000
if you actually asked your representative officials

196
0:10:12.013,000 --> 0:10:13,000
to appropriate those budgets.

197
0:10:15.091,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And take your money out of the banks.

198
0:10:16.957,000 --> 0:10:17,000
That's huge. It makes a huge difference.

199
0:10:19.688,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Stand with us, empathize,

200
0:10:22.012,000 --> 0:10:25,000
learn, grow, change the conversation.

201
0:10:26.942,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Forty percent of Native people are under the age of 24.

202
0:10:32.438,000 --> 0:10:35,000
We are the fastest-growing demographic in the United States.

203
0:10:37.35,000 --> 0:10:39,000
We are doctors, we are lawyers,

204
0:10:39.906,000 --> 0:10:41,000
we are teachers, we are scientists,

205
0:10:42.55,000 --> 0:10:44,000
we are engineers.

206
0:10:44.879,000 --> 0:10:47,000
We are medicine men, we are medicine women,

207
0:10:48.537,000 --> 0:10:5,000
we are sun dancers, we are pipe carriers,

208
0:10:52.268,000 --> 0:10:54,000
we are traditional language speakers.

209
0:10:54.896,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And we are still here.

210
0:10:56.749,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Miigwech.

211
0:10:57.924,000 --> 0:11:01,000
(Applause)

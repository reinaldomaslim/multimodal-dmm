1
0:00:15.33,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I admit that I'm a little bit nervous here

2
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
because I'm going to say some radical things,

3
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
about how we should think about cancer differently,

4
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
to an audience that contains a lot of people

5
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
who know a lot more about cancer than I do.

6
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
But I will also contest that I'm not as nervous as I should be

7
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
because I'm pretty sure I'm right about this.

8
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And that this, in fact, will be

10
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
the way that we treat cancer in the future.

11
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
In order to talk about cancer,

12
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I'm going to actually have to --

13
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
let me get the big slide here.

14
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
First, I'm going to try to give you a different perspective of genomics.

15
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I want to put it in perspective of the bigger picture

16
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
of all the other things that are going on --

17
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and then talk about something you haven't heard so much about, which is proteomics.

18
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Having explained those,

19
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that will set up for what I think will be a different idea

20
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
about how to go about treating cancer.

21
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
So let me start with genomics.

22
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
It is the hot topic.

23
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
It is the place where we're learning the most.

24
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
This is the great frontier.

25
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
But it has its limitations.

26
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And in particular, you've probably all heard the analogy

27
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that the genome is like the blueprint of your body,

28
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and if that were only true, it would be great,

29
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
but it's not.

30
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
It's like the parts list of your body.

31
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
It doesn't say how things are connected,

32
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
what causes what and so on.

33
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
So if I can make an analogy,

34
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
let's say that you were trying to tell the difference

35
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
between a good restaurant, a healthy restaurant

36
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and a sick restaurant,

37
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and all you had was the list of ingredients

38
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that they had in their larder.

39
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So it might be that, if you went to a French restaurant

40
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and you looked through it and you found

41
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
they only had margarine and they didn't have butter,

42
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
you could say, "Ah, I see what's wrong with them.

43
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I can make them healthy."

44
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And there probably are special cases of that.

45
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
You could certainly tell the difference

46
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
between a Chinese restaurant and a French restaurant

47
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
by what they had in a larder.

48
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So the list of ingredients does tell you something,

49
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and sometimes it tells you something that's wrong.

50
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
If they have tons of salt,

51
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
you might guess they're using too much salt, or something like that.

52
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
But it's limited,

53
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
because really to know if it's a healthy restaurant,

54
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
you need to taste the food, you need to know what goes on in the kitchen,

55
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
you need the product of all of those ingredients.

56
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So if I look at a person

57
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and I look at a person's genome, it's the same thing.

58
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
The part of the genome that we can read

59
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
is the list of ingredients.

60
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And so indeed,

61
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
there are times when we can find ingredients

62
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
that [are] bad.

63
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Cystic fibrosis is an example of a disease

64
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
where you just have a bad ingredient and you have a disease,

65
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and we can actually make a direct correspondence

66
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
between the ingredient and the disease.

67
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
But most things, you really have to know what's going on in the kitchen,

68
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
because, mostly, sick people used to be healthy people --

69
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
they have the same genome.

70
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So the genome really tells you much more

71
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
about predisposition.

72
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So what you can tell

73
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
is you can tell the difference between an Asian person and a European person

74
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
by looking at their ingredients list.

75
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
But you really for the most part can't tell the difference

76
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
between a healthy person and a sick person --

77
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
except in some of these special cases.

78
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So why all the big deal

79
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
about genetics?

80
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Well first of all,

81
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
it's because we can read it, which is fantastic.

82
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
It is very useful in certain circumstances.

83
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
It's also the great theoretical triumph

84
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
of biology.

85
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
It's the one theory

86
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that the biologists ever really got right.

87
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
It's fundamental to Darwin

88
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and Mendel and so on.

89
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And so it's the one thing where they predicted a theoretical construct.

90
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So Mendel had this idea of a gene

91
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
as an abstract thing,

92
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and Darwin built a whole theory

93
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that depended on them existing,

94
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and then Watson and Crick

95
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
actually looked and found one.

96
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So this happens in physics all the time.

97
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
You predict a black hole,

98
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and you look out the telescope and there it is, just like you said.

99
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
But it rarely happens in biology.

100
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So this great triumph -- it's so good,

101
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
there's almost a religious experience

102
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
in biology.

103
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And Darwinian evolution

104
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
is really the core theory.

105
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So the other reason it's been very popular

106
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
is because we can measure it, it's digital.

107
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And in fact,

108
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
thanks to Kary Mullis,

109
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
you can basically measure your genome in your kitchen

110
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
with a few extra ingredients.

111
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So for instance, by measuring the genome,

112
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
we've learned a lot about how we're related to other kinds of animals

113
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
by the closeness of our genome,

114
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
or how we're related to each other -- the family tree,

115
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
or the tree of life.

116
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
There's a huge amount of information about the genetics

117
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
just by comparing the genetic similarity.

118
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Now of course, in medical application,

119
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that is very useful

120
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
because it's the same kind of information

121
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that the doctor gets from your family medical history --

122
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
except probably,

123
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
your genome knows much more about your medical history than you do.

124
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And so by reading the genome,

125
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
we can find out much more about your family than you probably know.

126
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And so we can discover things

127
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that probably you could have found

128
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
by looking at enough of your relatives,

129
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
but they may be surprising.

130
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I did the 23andMe thing

131
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and was very surprised to discover that I am fat and bald.

132
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
(Laughter)

133
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
But sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that.

134
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
But mostly

135
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
what you need to know, to find out if you're sick,

136
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
is not your predispositions,

137
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
but it's actually what's going on in your body right now.

138
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So to do that, what you really need to do,

139
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
you need to look at the things

140
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that the genes are producing

141
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and what's happening after the genetics,

142
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and that's what proteomics is about.

143
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Just like genome mixes the study of all the genes,

144
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
proteomics is the study of all the proteins.

145
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And the proteins are all of the little things in your body

146
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that are signaling between the cells --

147
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
actually, the machines that are operating --

148
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
that's where the action is.

149
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Basically, a human body

150
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
is a conversation going on,

151
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
both within the cells and between the cells,

152
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and they're telling each other to grow and to die,

153
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and when you're sick,

154
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
something's gone wrong with that conversation.

155
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And so the trick is --

156
0:06:44.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
unfortunately, we don't have an easy way to measure these

157
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
like we can measure the genome.

158
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So the problem is that measuring --

159
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
if you try to measure all the proteins, it's a very elaborate process.

160
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
It requires hundreds of steps,

161
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and it takes a long, long time.

162
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And it matters how much of the protein it is.

163
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
It could be very significant that a protein changed by 10 percent,

164
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:07,000
so it's not a nice digital thing like DNA.

165
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And basically our problem is somebody's in the middle

166
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
of this very long stage,

167
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
they pause for just a moment,

168
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and they leave something in an enzyme for a second,

169
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and all of a sudden all the measurements from then on

170
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
don't work.

171
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And so then people get very inconsistent results

172
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
when they do it this way.

173
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
People have tried very hard to do this.

174
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I tried this a couple of times

175
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and looked at this problem and gave up on it.

176
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
I kept getting this call from this oncologist

177
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
named David Agus.

178
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And Applied Minds gets a lot of calls

179
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
from people who want help with their problems,

180
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and I didn't think this was a very likely one to call back,

181
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
so I kept on giving him to the delay list.

182
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And then one day,

183
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I get a call from John Doerr, Bill Berkman

184
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and Al Gore on the same day

185
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
saying return David Agus's phone call.

186
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
(Laughter)

187
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
So I was like, "Okay. This guy's at least resourceful."

188
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
(Laughter)

189
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So we started talking,

190
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and he said, "I really need a better way to measure proteins."

191
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
I'm like, "Looked at that. Been there.

192
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Not going to be easy."

193
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
He's like, "No, no. I really need it.

194
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I mean, I see patients dying every day

195
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
because we don't know what's going on inside of them.

196
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
We have to have a window into this."

197
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And he took me through

198
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
specific examples of when he really needed it.

199
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And I realized, wow, this would really make a big difference,

200
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
if we could do it,

201
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and so I said, "Well, let's look at it."

202
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Applied Minds has enough play money

203
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
that we can go and just work on something

204
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
without getting anybody's funding or permission or anything.

205
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
So we started playing around with this.

206
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And as we did it, we realized this was the basic problem --

207
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that taking the sip of coffee --

208
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
that there were humans doing this complicated process

209
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and that what really needed to be done

210
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
was to automate this process like an assembly line

211
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and build robots

212
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that would measure proteomics.

213
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And so we did that,

214
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
and working with David,

215
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
we made a little company called Applied Proteomics eventually,

216
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
which makes this robotic assembly line,

217
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
which, in a very consistent way, measures the protein.

218
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And I'll show you what that protein measurement looks like.

219
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Basically, what we do

220
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
is we take a drop of blood

221
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
out of a patient,

222
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and we sort out the proteins

223
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
in the drop of blood

224
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
according to how much they weigh,

225
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
how slippery they are,

226
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and we arrange them in an image.

227
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And so we can look at literally

228
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
hundreds of thousands of features at once

229
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
out of that drop of blood.

230
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And we can take a different one tomorrow,

231
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and you will see your proteins tomorrow will be different --

232
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:43,000
they'll be different after you eat or after you sleep.

233
0:09:43.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
They really tell us what's going on there.

234
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And so this picture,

235
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
which looks like a big smudge to you,

236
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
is actually the thing that got me really thrilled about this

237
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and made me feel like we were on the right track.

238
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
So if I zoom into that picture,

239
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
I can just show you what it means.

240
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
We sort out the proteins -- from left to right

241
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
is the weight of the fragments that we're getting,

242
0:10:06.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and from top to bottom is how slippery they are.

243
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
So we're zooming in here just to show you a little bit of it.

244
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And so each of these lines

245
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:17,000
represents some signal that we're getting out of a piece of a protein.

246
0:10:17.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And you can see how the lines occur

247
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
in these little groups of bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.

248
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And that's because we're measuring the weight so precisely that --

249
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
carbon comes in different isotopes,

250
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
so if it has an extra neutron on it,

251
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
we actually measure it as a different chemical.

252
0:10:35.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
So we're actually measuring each isotope as a different one.

253
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And so that gives you an idea

254
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
of how exquisitely sensitive this is.

255
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
So seeing this picture

256
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
is sort of like getting to be Galileo

257
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and looking at the stars

258
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and looking through the telescope for the first time,

259
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and suddenly you say, "Wow, it's way more complicated than we thought it was."

260
0:10:54.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
But we can see that stuff out there

261
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and actually see features of it.

262
0:10:58.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
So this is the signature out of which we're trying to get patterns.

263
0:11:01.33,000 --> 0:11:03,000
So what we do with this

264
0:11:03.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
is, for example, we can look at two patients,

265
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
one that responded to a drug and one that didn't respond to a drug,

266
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and ask, "What's going on differently

267
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
inside of them?"

268
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And so we can make these measurements precisely enough

269
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
that we can overlay two patients and look at the differences.

270
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
So here we have Alice in green

271
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and Bob in red.

272
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
We overlay them. This is actual data.

273
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And you can see, mostly it overlaps and it's yellow,

274
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:3,000
but there's some things that just Alice has

275
0:11:30.33,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and some things that just Bob has.

276
0:11:32.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And if we find a pattern of things

277
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
of the responders to the drug,

278
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
we see that in the blood,

279
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:42,000
they have the condition

280
0:11:42.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
that allows them to respond to this drug.

281
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
We might not even know what this protein is,

282
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
but we can see it's a marker

283
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:5,000
for the response to the disease.

284
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
So this already, I think,

285
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
is tremendously useful in all kinds of medicine.

286
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
But I think this is actually

287
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
just the beginning

288
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
of how we're going to treat cancer.

289
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
So let me move to cancer.

290
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
The thing about cancer --

291
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
when I got into this,

292
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
I really knew nothing about it,

293
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
but working with David Agus,

294
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:17,000
I started watching how cancer was actually being treated

295
0:12:17.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and went to operations where it was being cut out.

296
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And as I looked at it,

297
0:12:22.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
to me it didn't make sense

298
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
how we were approaching cancer,

299
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and in order to make sense of it,

300
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:32,000
I had to learn where did this come from.

301
0:12:32.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
We're treating cancer almost like it's an infectious disease.

302
0:12:36.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
We're treating it as something that got inside of you

303
0:12:38.33,000 --> 0:12:4,000
that we have to kill.

304
0:12:40.33,000 --> 0:12:42,000
So this is the great paradigm.

305
0:12:42.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
This is another case

306
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
where a theoretical paradigm in biology really worked --

307
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:49,000
was the germ theory of disease.

308
0:12:49.33,000 --> 0:12:51,000
So what doctors are mostly trained to do

309
0:12:51.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
is diagnose --

310
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:55,000
that is, put you into a category

311
0:12:55.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and apply a scientifically proven treatment

312
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
for that diagnosis --

313
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and that works great for infectious diseases.

314
0:13:02.33,000 --> 0:13:04,000
So if we put you in the category

315
0:13:04.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
of you've got syphilis, we can give you penicillin.

316
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
We know that that works.

317
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
If you've got malaria, we give you quinine

318
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
or some derivative of it.

319
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And so that's the basic thing doctors are trained to do,

320
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and it's miraculous

321
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
in the case of infectious disease --

322
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
how well it works.

323
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And many people in this audience probably wouldn't be alive

324
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
if doctors didn't do this.

325
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:3,000
But now let's apply that

326
0:13:30.33,000 --> 0:13:32,000
to systems diseases like cancer.

327
0:13:32.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
The problem is that, in cancer,

328
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
there isn't something else

329
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
that's inside of you.

330
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
It's you; you're broken.

331
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:44,000
That conversation inside of you

332
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
got mixed up in some way.

333
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:48,000
So how do we diagnose that conversation?

334
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Well, right now what we do is we divide it by part of the body --

335
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:54,000
you know, where did it appear? --

336
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and we put you in different categories

337
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:13:58,000
according to the part of the body.

338
0:13:58.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
And then we do a clinical trial

339
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
for a drug for lung cancer

340
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and one for prostate cancer and one for breast cancer,

341
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and we treat these as if they're separate diseases

342
0:14:08.33,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and that this way of dividing them

343
0:14:10.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
had something to do with what actually went wrong.

344
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And of course, it really doesn't have that much to do

345
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
with what went wrong

346
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
because cancer is a failure of the system.

347
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And in fact, I think we're even wrong

348
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
when we talk about cancer as a thing.

349
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:26,000
I think this is the big mistake.

350
0:14:26.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
I think cancer should not be a noun.

351
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
We should talk about cancering

352
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
as something we do, not something we have.

353
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And so those tumors,

354
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:39,000
those are symptoms of cancer.

355
0:14:39.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And so your body is probably cancering all the time,

356
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
but there are lots of systems in your body

357
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:47,000
that keep it under control.

358
0:14:47.33,000 --> 0:14:49,000
And so to give you an idea

359
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:51,000
of an analogy of what I mean

360
0:14:51.33,000 --> 0:14:54,000
by thinking of cancering as a verb,

361
0:14:54.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
imagine we didn't know anything about plumbing,

362
0:14:57.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
and the way that we talked about it,

363
0:14:59.33,000 --> 0:15:02,000
we'd come home and we'd find a leak in our kitchen

364
0:15:02.33,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and we'd say, "Oh, my house has water."

365
0:15:06.33,000 --> 0:15:09,000
We might divide it -- the plumber would say, "Well, where's the water?"

366
0:15:09.33,000 --> 0:15:12,000
"Well, it's in the kitchen." "Oh, you must have kitchen water."

367
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:15,000
That's kind of the level at which it is.

368
0:15:15.33,000 --> 0:15:17,000
"Kitchen water,

369
0:15:17.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
well, first of all, we'll go in there and we'll mop out a lot of it.

370
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And then we know that if we sprinkle Drano around the kitchen,

371
0:15:22.33,000 --> 0:15:25,000
that helps.

372
0:15:25.33,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Whereas living room water,

373
0:15:27.33,000 --> 0:15:29,000
it's better to do tar on the roof."

374
0:15:29.33,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And it sounds silly,

375
0:15:31.33,000 --> 0:15:33,000
but that's basically what we do.

376
0:15:33.33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And I'm not saying you shouldn't mop up your water if you have cancer,

377
0:15:36.33,000 --> 0:15:39,000
but I'm saying that's not really the problem;

378
0:15:39.33,000 --> 0:15:41,000
that's the symptom of the problem.

379
0:15:41.33,000 --> 0:15:43,000
What we really need to get at

380
0:15:43.33,000 --> 0:15:45,000
is the process that's going on,

381
0:15:45.33,000 --> 0:15:47,000
and that's happening at the level

382
0:15:47.33,000 --> 0:15:49,000
of the proteonomic actions,

383
0:15:49.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
happening at the level of why is your body not healing itself

384
0:15:52.33,000 --> 0:15:54,000
in the way that it normally does?

385
0:15:54.33,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Because normally, your body is dealing with this problem all the time.

386
0:15:57.33,000 --> 0:16:,000
So your house is dealing with leaks all the time,

387
0:16:00.33,000 --> 0:16:04,000
but it's fixing them. It's draining them out and so on.

388
0:16:04.33,000 --> 0:16:07,000
So what we need

389
0:16:07.33,000 --> 0:16:11,000
is to have a causative model

390
0:16:11.33,000 --> 0:16:13,000
of what's actually going on,

391
0:16:13.33,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and proteomics actually gives us

392
0:16:16.33,000 --> 0:16:19,000
the ability to build a model like that.

393
0:16:19.33,000 --> 0:16:21,000
David got me invited

394
0:16:21.33,000 --> 0:16:23,000
to give a talk at National Cancer Institute

395
0:16:23.33,000 --> 0:16:26,000
and Anna Barker was there.

396
0:16:27.33,000 --> 0:16:29,000
And so I gave this talk

397
0:16:29.33,000 --> 0:16:32,000
and said, "Why don't you guys do this?"

398
0:16:32.33,000 --> 0:16:34,000
And Anna said,

399
0:16:34.33,000 --> 0:16:37,000
"Because nobody within cancer

400
0:16:37.33,000 --> 0:16:39,000
would look at it this way.

401
0:16:39.33,000 --> 0:16:42,000
But what we're going to do, is we're going to create a program

402
0:16:42.33,000 --> 0:16:44,000
for people outside the field of cancer

403
0:16:44.33,000 --> 0:16:46,000
to get together with doctors

404
0:16:46.33,000 --> 0:16:49,000
who really know about cancer

405
0:16:49.33,000 --> 0:16:53,000
and work out different programs of research."

406
0:16:53.33,000 --> 0:16:55,000
So David and I applied to this program

407
0:16:55.33,000 --> 0:16:57,000
and created a consortium

408
0:16:57.33,000 --> 0:16:59,000
at USC

409
0:16:59.33,000 --> 0:17:02,000
where we've got some of the best oncologists in the world

410
0:17:02.33,000 --> 0:17:05,000
and some of the best biologists in the world,

411
0:17:05.33,000 --> 0:17:07,000
from Cold Spring Harbor,

412
0:17:07.33,000 --> 0:17:09,000
Stanford, Austin --

413
0:17:09.33,000 --> 0:17:12,000
I won't even go through and name all the places --

414
0:17:12.33,000 --> 0:17:15,000
to have a research project

415
0:17:15.33,000 --> 0:17:17,000
that will last for five years

416
0:17:17.33,000 --> 0:17:2,000
where we're really going to try to build a model of cancer like this.

417
0:17:20.33,000 --> 0:17:22,000
We're doing it in mice first,

418
0:17:22.33,000 --> 0:17:24,000
and we will kill a lot of mice

419
0:17:24.33,000 --> 0:17:26,000
in the process of doing this,

420
0:17:26.33,000 --> 0:17:28,000
but they will die for a good cause.

421
0:17:28.33,000 --> 0:17:31,000
And we will actually try to get to the point

422
0:17:31.33,000 --> 0:17:33,000
where we have a predictive model

423
0:17:33.33,000 --> 0:17:35,000
where we can understand,

424
0:17:35.33,000 --> 0:17:37,000
when cancer happens,

425
0:17:37.33,000 --> 0:17:39,000
what's actually happening in there

426
0:17:39.33,000 --> 0:17:42,000
and which treatment will treat that cancer.

427
0:17:42.33,000 --> 0:17:45,000
So let me just end with giving you a little picture

428
0:17:45.33,000 --> 0:17:48,000
of what I think cancer treatment will be like in the future.

429
0:17:48.33,000 --> 0:17:5,000
So I think eventually,

430
0:17:50.33,000 --> 0:17:52,000
once we have one of these models for people,

431
0:17:52.33,000 --> 0:17:54,000
which we'll get eventually --

432
0:17:54.33,000 --> 0:17:56,000
I mean, our group won't get all the way there --

433
0:17:56.33,000 --> 0:17:59,000
but eventually we'll have a very good computer model --

434
0:17:59.33,000 --> 0:18:02,000
sort of like a global climate model for weather.

435
0:18:02.33,000 --> 0:18:05,000
It has lots of different information

436
0:18:05.33,000 --> 0:18:08,000
about what's the process going on in this proteomic conversation

437
0:18:08.33,000 --> 0:18:1,000
on many different scales.

438
0:18:10.33,000 --> 0:18:12,000
And so we will simulate

439
0:18:12.33,000 --> 0:18:14,000
in that model

440
0:18:14.33,000 --> 0:18:17,000
for your particular cancer --

441
0:18:17.33,000 --> 0:18:19,000
and this also will be for ALS,

442
0:18:19.33,000 --> 0:18:22,000
or any kind of system neurodegenerative diseases,

443
0:18:22.33,000 --> 0:18:24,000
things like that --

444
0:18:24.33,000 --> 0:18:26,000
we will simulate

445
0:18:26.33,000 --> 0:18:28,000
specifically you,

446
0:18:28.33,000 --> 0:18:3,000
not just a generic person,

447
0:18:30.33,000 --> 0:18:32,000
but what's actually going on inside you.

448
0:18:32.33,000 --> 0:18:34,000
And in that simulation, what we could do

449
0:18:34.33,000 --> 0:18:36,000
is design for you specifically

450
0:18:36.33,000 --> 0:18:38,000
a sequence of treatments,

451
0:18:38.33,000 --> 0:18:41,000
and it might be very gentle treatments, very small amounts of drugs.

452
0:18:41.33,000 --> 0:18:44,000
It might be things like, don't eat that day,

453
0:18:44.33,000 --> 0:18:46,000
or give them a little chemotherapy,

454
0:18:46.33,000 --> 0:18:48,000
maybe a little radiation.

455
0:18:48.33,000 --> 0:18:51,000
Of course, we'll do surgery sometimes and so on.

456
0:18:51.33,000 --> 0:18:54,000
But design a program of treatments specifically for you

457
0:18:54.33,000 --> 0:18:57,000
and help your body

458
0:18:57.33,000 --> 0:19:,000
guide back to health --

459
0:19:00.33,000 --> 0:19:02,000
guide your body back to health.

460
0:19:02.33,000 --> 0:19:06,000
Because your body will do most of the work of fixing it

461
0:19:06.33,000 --> 0:19:09,000
if we just sort of prop it up in the ways that are wrong.

462
0:19:09.33,000 --> 0:19:11,000
We put it in the equivalent of splints.

463
0:19:11.33,000 --> 0:19:13,000
And so your body basically has lots and lots of mechanisms

464
0:19:13.33,000 --> 0:19:15,000
for fixing cancer,

465
0:19:15.33,000 --> 0:19:18,000
and we just have to prop those up in the right way

466
0:19:18.33,000 --> 0:19:2,000
and get them to do the job.

467
0:19:20.33,000 --> 0:19:22,000
And so I believe that this will be the way

468
0:19:22.33,000 --> 0:19:24,000
that cancer will be treated in the future.

469
0:19:24.33,000 --> 0:19:26,000
It's going to require a lot of work,

470
0:19:26.33,000 --> 0:19:28,000
a lot of research.

471
0:19:28.33,000 --> 0:19:31,000
There will be many teams like our team

472
0:19:31.33,000 --> 0:19:33,000
that work on this.

473
0:19:33.33,000 --> 0:19:35,000
But I think eventually,

474
0:19:35.33,000 --> 0:19:37,000
we will design for everybody

475
0:19:37.33,000 --> 0:19:41,000
a custom treatment for cancer.

476
0:19:41.33,000 --> 0:19:43,000
So thank you very much.

477
0:19:43.33,000 --> 0:19:49,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I was basically concerned about what was going on in the world.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I couldn't understand

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
the starvation, the destruction,

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
the killing of innocent people.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Making sense of those things

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
is a very difficult thing to do.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And when I was 12, I became an actor.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I was bottom of the class. I haven't got any qualifications.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I was told I was dyslexic.

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
In fact, I have got qualifications.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I got a D in pottery, which was the one thing that I did get --

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
which was useful, obviously.

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And so concern

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
is where all of this comes from.

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And then, being an actor, I was doing these different kinds of things,

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and I felt the content of the work that I was involved in

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
really wasn't cutting it, that there surely had to be more.

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And at that point, I read a book by Frank Barnaby,

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
this wonderful nuclear physicist,

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and he said that media had a responsibility,

21
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that all sectors of society had a responsibility

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
to try and progress things and move things forward.

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And that fascinated me,

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
because I'd been messing around with a camera most of my life.

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And then I thought, well maybe I could do something.

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Maybe I could become a filmmaker.

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Maybe I can use the form of film constructively

28
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
to in some way make a difference.

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Maybe there's a little change I can get involved in.

30
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So I started thinking about peace,

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and I was obviously, as I said to you,

32
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
very much moved by these images,

33
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
trying to make sense of that.

34
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Could I go and speak to older and wiser people

35
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
who would tell me how they made sense

36
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
of the things that are going on?

37
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Because it's obviously incredibly frightening.

38
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But I realized that,

39
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
having been messing around with structure as an actor,

40
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that a series of sound bites in itself wasn't enough,

41
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
that there needed to be a mountain to climb,

42
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
there needed to be a journey that I had to take.

43
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And if I took that journey,

44
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
no matter whether it failed or succeeded, it would be completely irrelevant.

45
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
The point was that I would have something

46
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
to hook the questions of -- is humankind fundamentally evil?

47
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Is the destruction of the world inevitable? Should I have children?

48
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Is that a responsible thing to do? Etc., etc.

49
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So I was thinking about peace,

50
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and then I was thinking, well where's the starting point for peace?

51
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And that was when I had the idea.

52
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
There was no starting point for peace.

53
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
There was no day of global unity.

54
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
There was no day of intercultural cooperation.

55
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
There was no day when humanity came together,

56
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
separate in all of those things

57
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and just shared it together --

58
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that we're in this together,

59
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and that if we united and we interculturally cooperated,

60
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
then that might be the key to humanity's survival.

61
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
That might shift the level of consciousness

62
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
around the fundamental issues that humanity faces --

63
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
if we did it just for a day.

64
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So obviously we didn't have any money.

65
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I was living at my mom's place.

66
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And we started writing letters to everybody.

67
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
You very quickly work out what is it that you've got to do

68
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
to fathom that out.

69
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
How do you create a day voted by every single head of state in the world

70
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
to create the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day,

71
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
the 21st of September?

72
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And I wanted it to be the 21st of September

73
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
because it was my granddad's favorite number.

74
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
He was a prisoner of war.

75
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
He saw the bomb go off at Nagasaki.

76
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
It poisoned his blood. He died when I was 11.

77
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So he was like my hero.

78
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And the reason why 21 was the number is

79
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
700 men left, 23 came back,

80
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
two died on the boat and 21 hit the ground.

81
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And that's why we wanted it to be the 21st of September as the date of peace.

82
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So we began this journey,

83
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and we launched it in 1999.

84
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And we wrote to heads of state, their ambassadors,

85
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Nobel Peace laureates, NGOs, faiths,

86
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
various organizations -- literally wrote to everybody.

87
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And very quickly, some letters started coming back.

88
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And we started to build this case.

89
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And I remember the first letter.

90
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
One of the first letters was from the Dalai Lama.

91
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And of course we didn't have the money; we were playing guitars

92
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and getting the money for the stamps that we were sending out all of [this mail].

93
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
A letter came through from the Dalai Lama saying,

94
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
"This is an amazing thing. Come and see me.

95
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I'd love to talk to you about the first ever day of peace."

96
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And we didn't have money for the flight.

97
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And I rang Sir Bob Ayling, who was CEO of BA at the time,

98
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and said, "Mate, we've got this invitation.

99
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Could you give me a flight? Because we're going to go see him."

100
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And of course, we went and saw him and it was amazing.

101
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And then Dr. Oscar Arias came forward.

102
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And actually, let me go back to that slide,

103
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
because when we launched it in 1999 --

104
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
this idea to create the first ever day of ceasefire and non-violence --

105
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
we invited thousands of people.

106
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Well not thousands -- hundreds of people, lots of people --

107
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
all the press, because we were going to try and create

108
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
the first ever World Peace Day, a peace day.

109
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And we invited everybody,

110
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and no press showed up.

111
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
There were 114 people there -- they were mostly my friends and family.

112
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And that was kind of like the launch of this thing.

113
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
But it didn't matter because we were documenting, and that was the thing.

114
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
For me, it was really about the process.

115
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
It wasn't about the end result.

116
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And that's the beautiful thing about the camera.

117
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
They used to say the pen is mightier than the sword. I think the camera is.

118
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing

119
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and really empowering actually.

120
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So anyway, we began the journey.

121
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And here you see people like Mary Robinson, I went to see in Geneva.

122
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I'm cutting my hair, it's getting short and long,

123
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
because every time I saw Kofi Annan,

124
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I was so worried that he thought I was a hippie that I cut it,

125
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
and that was kind of what was going on.

126
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
(Laughter)

127
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Yeah, I'm not worried about it now.

128
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So Mary Robinson,

129
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
she said to me, "Listen, this is an idea whose time has come. This must be created."

130
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Kofi Annan said, "This will be beneficial to my troops on the ground."

131
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
The OAU at the time, led by Salim Ahmed Salim,

132
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
said, "I must get the African countries involved."

133
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Dr. Oscar Arias, Nobel Peace laureate,

134
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
president now of Costa Rica,

135
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
said, "I'll do everything that I can."

136
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So I went and saw Amr Moussa at the League of Arab States.

137
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I met Mandela at the Arusha peace talks,

138
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and so on and so on and so on --

139
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
while I was building the case

140
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
to prove whether this idea

141
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
would make sense.

142
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And then we were listening to the people. We were documenting everywhere.

143
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
76 countries in the last 12 years, I've visited.

144
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And I've always spoken to women and children wherever I've gone.

145
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I've recorded 44,000 young people.

146
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I've recorded about 900 hours of their thoughts.

147
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I'm really clear about how young people feel

148
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
when you talk to them about this idea

149
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
of having a starting point for their actions for a more peaceful world

150
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
through their poetry, their art, their literature,

151
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
their music, their sport, whatever it might be.

152
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And we were listening to everybody.

153
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And it was an incredibly thing, working with the U.N.

154
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and working with NGOs and building this case.

155
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I felt that I was presenting a case

156
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
on behalf of the global community

157
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
to try and create this day.

158
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And the stronger the case and the more detailed it was,

159
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
the better chance we had of creating this day.

160
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And it was this stuff, this,

161
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
where I actually was in the beginning

162
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
kind of thinking no matter what happened, it didn't actually matter.

163
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
It didn't matter if it didn't create a day of peace.

164
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
The fact is that, if I tried and it didn't work,

165
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
then I could make a statement

166
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
about how unwilling the global community is to unite --

167
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
until, it was in Somalia, picking up that young girl.

168
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And this young child

169
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
who'd taken about an inch and a half out of her leg with no antiseptic,

170
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and that young boy who was a child soldier,

171
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
who told me he'd killed people -- he was about 12 --

172
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
these things made me realize

173
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that this was not a film that I could just stop.

174
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And that actually, at that moment something happened to me,

175
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
which obviously made me go, "I'm going to document.

176
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
If this is the only film that I ever make,

177
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I'm going to document until this becomes a reality."

178
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Because we've got to stop, we've got to do something

179
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
where we unite --

180
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
separate from all the politics and religion

181
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
that, as a young person, is confusing me.

182
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I don't know how to get involved in that process.

183
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And then on the seventh of September, I was invited to New York.

184
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
The Costa Rican government and the British government

185
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
had put forward to the United Nations General Assembly,

186
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
with 54 co-sponsors,

187
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
the idea of the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day,

188
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
the 21st of September, as a fixed calendar date,

189
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and it was unanimously adopted by every head of state in the world.

190
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
(Applause)

191
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Yeah, but there were hundreds of individuals, obviously, who made that a reality.

192
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And thank you to all of them.

193
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
That was an incredible moment.

194
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I was at the top of the General Assembly just looking down into it and seeing it happen.

195
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And as I mentioned, when it started,

196
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
we were at the Globe, and there was no press.

197
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And now I was thinking, "Well, the press it really going to hear this story."

198
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And suddenly, we started to institutionalize this day.

199
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
Kofi Annan invited me on the morning of September the 11th

200
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
to do a press conference.

201
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And it was 8:00 AM when I stood there.

202
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And I was waiting for him to come down, and I knew that he was on his way.

203
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And obviously he never came down. The statement was never made.

204
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
The world was never told there was a day of global ceasefire and nonviolence.

205
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And it was obviously a tragic moment

206
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
for the thousands of people who lost their lives,

207
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
there and then subsequently all over the world.

208
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
It never happened.

209
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And I remember thinking,

210
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
"This is exactly why, actually,

211
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
we have to work even harder.

212
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And we have to make this day work.

213
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
It's been created; nobody knows.

214
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
But we have to continue this journey,

215
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and we have to tell people,

216
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and we have to prove it can work."

217
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And I left New York freaked,

218
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
but actually empowered.

219
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And I felt inspired

220
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
by the possibilities

221
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
that if it did, then maybe we wouldn't see things like that.

222
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
I remember putting that film out and going to cynics.

223
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I was showing the film,

224
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and I remember being in Israel and getting it absolutely slaughtered

225
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
by some guys having watched the film --

226
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that it's just a day of peace, it doesn't mean anything.

227
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
It's not going to work; you're not going to stop the fighting in Afghanistan;

228
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
the Taliban won't listen, etc., etc.

229
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
It's just symbolism.

230
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And that was even worse

231
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
than actually what had just happened in many ways,

232
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
because it couldn't not work.

233
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I'd spoken in Somalia, Burundi, Gaza, the West Bank,

234
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
India, Sri Lanka, Congo, wherever it was,

235
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and they'd all tell me, "If you can create a window of opportunity,

236
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
we can move aid, we can vaccinate children.

237
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Children can lead their projects.

238
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
They can unite. They can come together. If people would stop, lives will be saved."

239
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
That's what I'd heard.

240
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And I'd heard that from the people who really understood what conflict was about.

241
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And so I went back to the United Nations.

242
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
I decided that I'd continue filming and make another movie.

243
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And I went back to the U.N. for another couple of years.

244
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
We started moving around the corridors of the U.N. system,

245
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
governments and NGOs,

246
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
trying desperately to find somebody

247
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
to come forward and have a go at it,

248
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
see if we could make it possible.

249
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And after lots and lots of meetings obviously,

250
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
I'm delighted that this man, Ahmad Fawzi,

251
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
one of my heroes and mentors really,

252
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
he managed to get UNICEF involved.

253
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And UNICEF, God bless them, they said, "Okay, we'll have a go."

254
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And then UNAMA became involved in Afghanistan.

255
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
It was historical. Could it work in Afghanistan

256
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
with UNAMA and WHO

257
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and civil society, etc., etc., etc.?

258
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And I was getting it all on film and I was recording it,

259
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and I was thinking, "This is it. This is the possibility of it maybe working.

260
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
But even if it doesn't, at least the door is open

261
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and there's a chance."

262
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And so I went back to London,

263
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and I went and saw this chap, Jude Law.

264
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And I saw him because he was an actor, I was an actor,

265
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
I had a connection to him,

266
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
because we needed to get to the press, we needed this attraction,

267
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
we needed the media to be involved.

268
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Because if we start pumping it up a bit maybe more people would listen

269
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and there'd be more --

270
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
when we got into certain areas,

271
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
maybe there would be more people interested.

272
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And maybe we'd be helped financially a little bit more,

273
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
which had been desperately difficult.

274
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I won't go into that.

275
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
So Jude said, "Okay, I'll do some statements for you."

276
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
While I was filming these statements, he said to me, "Where are you going next?"

277
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
I said, "I'm going to go to Afghanistan." He said, "Really?"

278
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And I could sort of see a little look in his eye of interest.

279
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
So I said to him, "Do you want to come with me?

280
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
It'd be really interesting if you came.

281
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
It would help and bring attention.

282
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And that attention

283
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
would help leverage the situation,

284
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
as well as all of the other sides of it."

285
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
I think there's a number of pillars to success.

286
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
One is you've got to have a great idea.

287
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
The other is you've got to have a constituency, you've got to have finance,

288
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and you've got to be able to raise awareness.

289
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And actually I could never raise awareness by myself, no matter what I'd achieved.

290
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
So these guys were absolutely crucial.

291
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
So he said yes,

292
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and we found ourselves in Afghanistan.

293
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
It was a really incredible thing that when we landed there,

294
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
I was talking to various people, and they were saying to me,

295
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
"You've got to get everybody involved here.

296
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
You can't just expect it to work. You have to get out and work."

297
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And we did, and we traveled around,

298
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and we spoke to elders, we spoke to doctors, we spoke to nurses,

299
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
we held press conferences, we went out with soldiers,

300
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
we sat down with ISAF, we sat down with NATO,

301
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
we sat down with the U.K. government.

302
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
I mean, we basically sat down with everybody --

303
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
in and out of schools with ministers of education,

304
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
holding these press conferences,

305
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
which of course, now were loaded with press, everybody was there.

306
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
There was an interest in what was going on.

307
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
This amazing woman, Fatima Gailani, was absolutely instrumental in what went on

308
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
as she was the spokesperson for the resistance against the Russians.

309
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And her Afghan network

310
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
was just absolutely everywhere.

311
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And she was really crucial in getting the message in.

312
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And then we went home. We'd sort of done it.

313
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
We had to wait now and see what happened.

314
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And I got home,

315
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and I remember one of the team bringing in a letter to me

316
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
from the Taliban.

317
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And that letter basically said, "We'll observe this day.

318
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
We will observe this day.

319
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
We see it as a window of opportunity.

320
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And we will not engage. We're not going to engage."

321
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And that meant that humanitarian workers

322
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
wouldn't be kidnapped or killed.

323
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And then suddenly, I obviously knew at this point, there was a chance.

324
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And days later,

325
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
1.6 million children were vaccinated against polio

326
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
as a consequence of everybody stopping.

327
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
(Applause)

328
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And like the General Assembly,

329
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
obviously the most wonderful, wonderful moment.

330
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And so then we wrapped the film up and we put it together

331
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
because we had to go back.

332
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
We put it into Dari and Pashto. We put it in the local dialects.

333
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
We went back to Afghanistan,

334
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
because the next year was coming, and we wanted to support.

335
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
But more importantly, we wanted to go back,

336
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
because these people in Afghanistan were the heroes.

337
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
They were the people who believed in peace

338
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and the possibilities of it, etc., etc. -- and they made it real.

339
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And we wanted to go back and show them the film

340
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and say, "Look, you guys made this possible. And thank you very much."

341
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And we gave the film over.

342
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Obviously it was shown, and it was amazing.

343
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
And then that year, that year, 2008,

344
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
this ISAF statement from Kabul, Afghanistan, September 17th:

345
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
"General Stanley McChrystal,

346
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
commander of international security assistance forces in Afghanistan,

347
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
announced today ISAF will not conduct offensive military operations

348
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
on the 21st of September."

349
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
They were saying they would stop.

350
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And then there was this other statement

351
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
that came out from the U.N. Department of Security and Safety

352
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
saying that, in Afghanistan,

353
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
because of this work,

354
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
the violence was down by 70 percent.

355
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
70 percent reduction in violence on this day at least.

356
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
And that completely blew my mind

357
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
almost more than anything.

358
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And I remember being stuck in New York, this time because of the volcano,

359
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
which was obviously much less harmful.

360
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
And I was there thinking about what was going on.

361
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And I kept thinking about this 70 percent.

362
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
70 percent reduction in violence --

363
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
in what everyone said was completely impossible

364
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and you couldn't do.

365
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
And that made me think that, if we can get 70 percent in Afghanistan,

366
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
then surely we can get 70 percent reduction everywhere.

367
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
We have to go for a global truce.

368
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
We have to utilize this day of ceasefire and nonviolence

369
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and go for a global truce,

370
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
go for the largest recorded cessation of hostilities,

371
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
both domestically and internationally, ever recorded.

372
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
That's exactly what we must do.

373
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
And on the 21st of September this year,

374
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
we're going to launch that campaign at the O2 Arena

375
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
to go for that process,

376
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
to try and create the largest recorded cessation of hostilities.

377
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
And we will utilize all kinds of things --

378
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
have a dance and social media

379
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and visiting on Facebook and visit the website, sign the petition.

380
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
And it's in the six official languages of the United Nations.

381
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
And we'll globally link with government, inter-government,

382
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
non-government, education, unions, sports.

383
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
And you can see the education box there.

384
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
We've got resources at the moment in 174 countries

385
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
trying to get young people to be the driving force

386
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
behind the vision of that global truce.

387
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
And obviously the life-saving is increased, the concepts help.

388
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Linking up with the Olympics --

389
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
I went and saw Seb Coe. I said, "London 2012 is about truce.

390
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Ultimately, that's what it's about."

391
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Why don't we all team up? Why don't we bring truce to life?

392
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Why don't you support the process of the largest ever global truce?

393
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
We'll make a new film about this process.

394
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
We'll utilize sport and football.

395
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
On the Day of Peace, there's thousands of football matches all played,

396
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
from the favelas of Brazil to wherever it might be.

397
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
So, utilizing all of these ways

398
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
to inspire individual action.

399
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And ultimately, we have to try that.

400
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
We have to work together.

401
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
And when I stand here in front of all of you,

402
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
and the people who will watch these things,

403
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
I'm excited, on behalf of everybody I've met,

404
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
that there is a possibility that our world could unite,

405
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
that we could come together as one,

406
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
that we could lift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues,

407
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
brought about by individuals.

408
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
I was with Brahimi, Ambassador Brahimi.

409
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
I think he's one of the most incredible men

410
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
in relation to international politics -- in Afghanistan, in Iraq.

411
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
He's an amazing man.

412
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
And I sat with him a few weeks ago.

413
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
And I said to him, "Mr. Brahimi, is this nuts, going for a global truce?

414
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
Is this possible? Is it really possible that we could do this?"

415
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
He said, "It's absolutely possible."

416
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
I said, "What would you do?

417
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
Would you go to governments and lobby and use the system?"

418
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
He said, "No, I'd talk to the individuals."

419
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
It's all about the individuals.

420
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
It's all about you and me.

421
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
It's all about partnerships.

422
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
It's about your constituencies; it's about your businesses.

423
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Because together, by working together,

424
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
I seriously think we can start to change things.

425
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
And there's a wonderful man sitting in this audience, and I don't know where he is,

426
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
who said to me a few days ago -- because I did a little rehearsal --

427
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
and he said, "I've been thinking about this day

428
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
and imagining it as a square

429
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
with 365 squares,

430
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
and one of them is white."

431
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
And it then made me think about a glass of water, which is clear.

432
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
If you put one drop,

433
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
one drop of something, in that water,

434
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
it'll change it forever.

435
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
By working together, we can create peace one day.

436
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Thank you TED. Thank you.

437
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
(Applause)

438
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
Thank you.

439
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
(Applause)

440
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
Thanks a lot.

441
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
(Applause)

442
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
Thank you very much. Thank you.

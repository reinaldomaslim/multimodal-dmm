2
0:00:18.799,000 --> 0:00:21,000
You know, we wake up in the morning,

3
0:00:21.875,000 --> 0:00:23,000
you get dressed, put on your shoes,

4
0:00:24.395,000 --> 0:00:26,000
you head out into the world.

5
0:00:26.907,000 --> 0:00:3,000
You plan on coming back, getting undressed,

6
0:00:31.158,000 --> 0:00:33,000
going to bed,

7
0:00:33.383,000 --> 0:00:34,000
waking up, doing it again,

8
0:00:35.137,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and that anticipation, that rhythm,

9
0:00:38.285,000 --> 0:00:4,000
helps give us a structure

10
0:00:40.555,000 --> 0:00:43,000
to how we organize ourselves and our lives,

11
0:00:44.143,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and gives it a measure of predictability.

12
0:00:47.623,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Living in New York City, as I do,

13
0:00:50.011,000 --> 0:00:57,000
it's almost as if, with so many people doing so many things

14
0:00:57.25,000 --> 0:01:,000
at the same time in such close quarters,

15
0:01:00.6,000 --> 0:01:03,000
it's almost like life is dealing you extra hands

16
0:01:03.839,000 --> 0:01:04,000
out of that deck.

17
0:01:05.365,000 --> 0:01:09,000
You're never, there's just, juxtapositions are possible

18
0:01:10.033,000 --> 0:01:15,000
that just aren't, you don't think they're going to happen.

19
0:01:15.036,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And you never think you're going to be the guy

20
0:01:17.379,000 --> 0:01:18,000
who's walking down the street

21
0:01:19.009,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and, because you choose to go down one side or the other,

22
0:01:22.431,000 --> 0:01:25,000
the rest of your life is changed forever.

23
0:01:25.591,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And one night, I'm riding the uptown local train.

24
0:01:31.319,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I get on. I tend to be a little bit vigilant

25
0:01:34.815,000 --> 0:01:36,000
when I get on the subway.

26
0:01:36.932,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I'm not one of the people zoning out with headphones

27
0:01:39.978,000 --> 0:01:4,000
or a book.

28
0:01:41.361,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And I get on the car, and I look, and I

29
0:01:44.167,000 --> 0:01:46,000
notice this couple,

30
0:01:46.751,000 --> 0:01:49,000
college-aged, student-looking kids,

31
0:01:50.239,000 --> 0:01:51,000
a guy and a girl, and they're sitting next to each other,

32
0:01:52.036,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and she's got her leg draped over his knee,

33
0:01:54.685,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and they're doing -- they have this little contraption,

34
0:01:58.845,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and they're tying these knots,

35
0:02:00.603,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and they're doing it with one hand,

36
0:02:02.44,000 --> 0:02:05,000
they're doing it left-handed and right-handed very quickly,

37
0:02:06.404,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and then she'll hand the thing to him and he'll do it.

38
0:02:08.652,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I've never seen anything like this.

39
0:02:09.853,000 --> 0:02:12,000
It's almost like they're practicing magic tricks.

40
0:02:13.237,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And at the next stop, a guy gets on the car,

41
0:02:17.556,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and he has this sort of visiting professor look to him.

42
0:02:21.534,000 --> 0:02:23,000
He's got the overstuffed leather satchel

43
0:02:23.654,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and the rectangular file case and a laptop bag

44
0:02:26.964,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and the tweed jacket with the leather patches,

45
0:02:29.476,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and — (Laughter) —

46
0:02:31.453,000 --> 0:02:33,000
he looks at them, and then

47
0:02:34.276,000 --> 0:02:37,000
in a blink of an eye, he kneels down in front of them,

48
0:02:37.292,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and he starts to say,

49
0:02:38.957,000 --> 0:02:4,000
"You know, listen, here's how you can do it. Look,

50
0:02:41.026,000 --> 0:02:43,000
if you do this -- " and he takes the laces out of their hand,

51
0:02:43.645,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and instantly, he starts tying these knots,

52
0:02:46.956,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and even better than they were doing it, remarkably.

53
0:02:51.617,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And it turns out they are medical students

54
0:02:54.697,000 --> 0:02:56,000
on their way to a lecture about the latest

55
0:02:56.809,000 --> 0:02:59,000
suturing techniques, and he's the guy giving the lecture.

56
0:03:00.035,000 --> 0:03:01,000
(Laughter)

57
0:03:01.643,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So he starts to tell them, and he's like,

58
0:03:04.057,000 --> 0:03:06,000
"No, this is very important here. You know,

59
0:03:06.565,000 --> 0:03:08,000
when you're needing these knots,

60
0:03:08.845,000 --> 0:03:09,000
it's going to be, you know, everything's

61
0:03:10.437,000 --> 0:03:13,000
going to be happening at the same time, it's going to be --

62
0:03:14.19,000 --> 0:03:17,000
you're going to have all this information coming at you,

63
0:03:17.827,000 --> 0:03:18,000
there's going to be organs getting in the way,

64
0:03:19.323,000 --> 0:03:21,000
it's going to be slippery,

65
0:03:21.358,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and

66
0:03:22.668,000 --> 0:03:24,000
it's just very important that you be able to do these

67
0:03:25.426,000 --> 0:03:28,000
beyond second nature, each hand, left hand, right hand,

68
0:03:28.796,000 --> 0:03:3,000
you have to be able to do them without seeing your fingers."

69
0:03:31.624,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And at that moment, when I heard that,

70
0:03:33.994,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I just got catapulted out of the subway car into a night

71
0:03:41.066,000 --> 0:03:44,000
when I had been getting a ride in an ambulance

72
0:03:44.2,000 --> 0:03:48,000
from the sidewalk where I had been stabbed

73
0:03:48.691,000 --> 0:03:52,000
to the trauma room of St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan,

74
0:03:53.01,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and what had happened was

75
0:03:54.999,000 --> 0:03:57,000
a gang had come in from Brooklyn.

76
0:03:58.208,000 --> 0:04:,000
As part of an initiation for three of their members,

77
0:04:00.831,000 --> 0:04:01,000
they had to kill somebody,

78
0:04:02.535,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and I happened to be the guy walking down Bleecker Street

79
0:04:05.922,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that night,

80
0:04:07.219,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and they jumped on me without a word.

81
0:04:11.656,000 --> 0:04:13,000
One of the very lucky things,

82
0:04:13.981,000 --> 0:04:16,000
when I was at Notre Dame, I was on the boxing team,

83
0:04:16.989,000 --> 0:04:2,000
so I put my hands up right away, instinctively.

84
0:04:21.637,000 --> 0:04:24,000
The guy on the right had a knife with a 10-inch blade,

85
0:04:25.189,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and he went in under my elbow,

86
0:04:28.482,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and it went up and cut my inferior vena cava.

87
0:04:32.949,000 --> 0:04:33,000
If you know anything about anatomy,

88
0:04:34.669,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that's not a good thing to get cut,

89
0:04:36.377,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and everything, of course, on the way up,

90
0:04:39.535,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and then — I still had my hands up —

91
0:04:41.425,000 --> 0:04:43,000
he pulled it out and went for my neck,

92
0:04:43.914,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and sunk it in up to the hilt in my neck,

93
0:04:48.119,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and I got one straight right punch

94
0:04:50.843,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and knocked the middle guy out.

95
0:04:52.614,000 --> 0:04:54,000
The other guy was still working on me,

96
0:04:54.827,000 --> 0:04:55,000
collapsing my other lung,

97
0:04:56.692,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and I managed to, by hitting that guy, to get a minute.

98
0:05:02.672,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I ran down the street and collapsed,

99
0:05:04.765,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and the ambulance guys intubated me on the sidewalk

100
0:05:07.812,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and let the trauma room know

101
0:05:10.285,000 --> 0:05:11,000
they had an incoming.

102
0:05:11.903,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And one of the

103
0:05:14.902,000 --> 0:05:17,000
side effects of having major massive blood loss

104
0:05:18.843,000 --> 0:05:19,000
is you get tunnel vision,

105
0:05:20.69,000 --> 0:05:21,000
so I remember being on the stretcher

106
0:05:22.503,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and having a little nickel-sized cone of vision,

107
0:05:26.508,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and I was moving my head around

108
0:05:28.057,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and we got to St. Vincent's,

109
0:05:29.413,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and we're racing down this hallway,

110
0:05:31.056,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and I see the lights going,

111
0:05:33.324,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and it's a peculiar effect of memories like that.

112
0:05:40.052,000 --> 0:05:44,000
They don't really go to the usual place that memories go.

113
0:05:44.231,000 --> 0:05:49,000
They kind of have this vault where they're stored in high-def,

114
0:05:49.435,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and George Lucas did all the sound effects. (Laughter)

115
0:05:53.92,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So sometimes, remembering them, it's like,

116
0:05:58.416,000 --> 0:06:01,000
it's not like any other kind of memories.

117
0:06:02.14,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And I get into the trauma room,

118
0:06:04.812,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and they're waiting for me, and the lights are there,

119
0:06:07.834,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and I'd been able to breathe a little more now,

120
0:06:13.129,000 --> 0:06:16,000
because the blood has left, had been filling up my lungs

121
0:06:16.608,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and I was having a very hard time breathing,

122
0:06:18.574,000 --> 0:06:21,000
but now it's kind of gone into the stretcher.

123
0:06:21.616,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And I said, "Is there anything I can do to help?"

124
0:06:24.92,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and — (Laughter) —

125
0:06:26.692,000 --> 0:06:29,000
the nurse kind of had a hysterical laugh, and

126
0:06:30.006,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I'm turning my head trying to see everybody,

127
0:06:32.254,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and I had this weird memory of being in college

128
0:06:36.07,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and raising,

129
0:06:38.982,000 --> 0:06:42,000
raising money for the flood victims of Bangladesh,

130
0:06:43.039,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and then I look over and my anesthesiologist

131
0:06:45.496,000 --> 0:06:46,000
is clamping the mask on me, and I think,

132
0:06:47.029,000 --> 0:06:49,000
"He looks Bangladeshi," — (Laughter) —

133
0:06:49.09,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and I just have those two facts, and I just think,

134
0:06:52.575,000 --> 0:06:55,000
"This could work somehow." (Laughter)

135
0:06:56.289,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And then I go out, and

136
0:06:58.567,000 --> 0:06:59,000
they work on me for the rest of the night,

137
0:07:00.343,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and I needed about 40 units of blood to keep me there

138
0:07:05.356,000 --> 0:07:08,000
while they did their work,

139
0:07:08.401,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and the surgeon took out about a third of my intestines,

140
0:07:12.625,000 --> 0:07:15,000
my cecum, organs I didn't know that I had,

141
0:07:16.044,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and he later told me one of the last things he did

142
0:07:18.415,000 --> 0:07:21,000
while he was in there was to remove my appendix for me,

143
0:07:21.76,000 --> 0:07:23,000
which I thought was great, you know,

144
0:07:23.983,000 --> 0:07:26,000
just a little tidy thing there at the end. (Laughter)

145
0:07:27.146,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And I came to in the morning.

146
0:07:31.464,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Out of anesthetic, he had let them know

147
0:07:33.28,000 --> 0:07:36,000
that he wanted to be there, and he had given me

148
0:07:36.768,000 --> 0:07:39,000
about a two percent chance of living.

149
0:07:39.963,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So he was there when I woke up,

150
0:07:41.875,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and it was, waking up was like

151
0:07:44.036,000 --> 0:07:5,000
breaking through the ice into a frozen lake of pain.

152
0:07:50.253,000 --> 0:07:52,000
It was that enveloping,

153
0:07:52.356,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and there was only one spot that didn't hurt

154
0:07:56.528,000 --> 0:07:57,000
worse than anything I'd ever felt,

155
0:07:58.001,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and it was my instep,

156
0:07:59.407,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and he was holding the arch of my foot

157
0:08:03.153,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and rubbing the instep with his thumb.

158
0:08:07.021,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And I looked up, and he's like,

159
0:08:09.957,000 --> 0:08:1,000
"Good to see you,"

160
0:08:11.078,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and I was trying to remember what had happened

161
0:08:15.014,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and trying to get my head around everything,

162
0:08:16.732,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and the pain was just overwhelming, and he said,

163
0:08:20.789,000 --> 0:08:23,000
"You know, we didn't cut your hair. I thought

164
0:08:24.165,000 --> 0:08:28,000
you might have gotten strength from your hair like Samson,

165
0:08:28.537,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and you're going to need all the strength you can get."

166
0:08:31.32,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And in those days, my hair was down to my waist,

167
0:08:35.029,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I drove a motorcycle, I was unmarried,

168
0:08:37.901,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I owned a bar, so those were different times. (Laughter)

169
0:08:43.21,000 --> 0:08:45,000
But

170
0:08:45.47,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I had three days of life support,

171
0:08:48.442,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and everybody was expecting,

172
0:08:52.223,000 --> 0:08:56,000
due to just the massive amount of what they had had to do

173
0:08:56.716,000 --> 0:08:57,000
that I wasn't going to make it,

174
0:08:58.544,000 --> 0:09:,000
so it was three days of

175
0:09:00.589,000 --> 0:09:02,000
everybody was either waiting for me to die or poop,

176
0:09:03.416,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and — (Laughter) —

177
0:09:05.012,000 --> 0:09:07,000
when I finally pooped, then that somehow,

178
0:09:07.971,000 --> 0:09:1,000
surgically speaking, that's like you crossed some good line,

179
0:09:11.378,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and, um — (Laughter) —

180
0:09:12.418,000 --> 0:09:15,000
on that day, the surgeon came in

181
0:09:15.683,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and whipped the sheet off of me.

182
0:09:18.875,000 --> 0:09:19,000
He had three or four friends with him,

183
0:09:20.536,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and he does that, and they all look,

184
0:09:22.938,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and there was no infection,

185
0:09:24.819,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and they bend over me and they're poking and prodding,

186
0:09:27.689,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and they're like, "There's no hematomas, blah blah,

187
0:09:29.786,000 --> 0:09:31,000
look at the color," and they're talking amongst themselves

188
0:09:32.656,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and I'm, like, this restored automobile

189
0:09:35.579,000 --> 0:09:38,000
that he's just going, "Yeah, I did that." (Laughter)

190
0:09:38.77,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And it was just,

191
0:09:41.794,000 --> 0:09:44,000
it was amazing, because these guys are high-fiving him

192
0:09:44.93,000 --> 0:09:46,000
over how good I turned out, you know? (Laughter)

193
0:09:46.99,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And it's my zipper, and I've still got the staples in

194
0:09:50.511,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and everything.

195
0:09:51.747,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And

196
0:09:53.962,000 --> 0:09:55,000
later on, when I got out

197
0:09:56.573,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and the flashbacks and the

198
0:10:02.185,000 --> 0:10:06,000
nightmares were giving me a hard time,

199
0:10:06.69,000 --> 0:10:07,000
I went back to him

200
0:10:08.372,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and I was sort of asking him,

201
0:10:12.265,000 --> 0:10:14,000
you know, what am I gonna do?

202
0:10:14.446,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And I think, kind of, as a surgeon, he basically said,

203
0:10:19.054,000 --> 0:10:2,000
"Kid, I saved your life.

204
0:10:20.78,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Like, now you can do whatever you want, like,

205
0:10:23.43,000 --> 0:10:24,000
you gotta get on with that.

206
0:10:25.096,000 --> 0:10:26,000
It's like I gave you a new car

207
0:10:26.928,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and you're complaining about not finding parking.

208
0:10:29.22,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Like, just, go out, and, you know, do your best.

209
0:10:32.821,000 --> 0:10:36,000
But you're alive. That's what it's about."

210
0:10:37.627,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And then I hear, "Bing-bong," and the subway doors

211
0:10:43.408,000 --> 0:10:49,000
are closing, and my stop is next, and I look at these kids,

212
0:10:49.647,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and I go, I think to myself,

213
0:10:51.516,000 --> 0:10:52,000
"I'm going to lift my shirt up

214
0:10:53.078,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and show them," — (Laughter) —

215
0:10:54.695,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and then I think, "No, this is the New York City subway,

216
0:10:56.924,000 --> 0:10:59,000
that's going to lead to other things." (Laughter)

217
0:11:00.555,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And so I just think, they got their lecture to go to.

218
0:11:04.597,000 --> 0:11:07,000
I step off, I'm standing on the platform,

219
0:11:08.558,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and I feel my index finger

220
0:11:11.422,000 --> 0:11:13,000
in

221
0:11:13.601,000 --> 0:11:16,000
the first scar that I ever got,

222
0:11:17.304,000 --> 0:11:2,000
from my umbilical cord,

223
0:11:20.418,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and then around that, is traced

224
0:11:23.656,000 --> 0:11:25,000
the last scar that I got

225
0:11:26.152,000 --> 0:11:28,000
from my surgeon,

226
0:11:28.529,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and I think that, that chance encounter

227
0:11:33.843,000 --> 0:11:36,000
with those kids on the street with their knives

228
0:11:37.732,000 --> 0:11:39,000
led me

229
0:11:40.165,000 --> 0:11:43,000
to my surgical team,

230
0:11:43.29,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and their training

231
0:11:47.365,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and their skill

232
0:11:49.481,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and, always, a little bit of luck

233
0:11:52.901,000 --> 0:11:54,000
pushed back against chaos.

234
0:11:55.872,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Thank you. (Applause)

235
0:11:59.926,000 --> 0:12:07,000
(Applause)

236
0:12:08.87,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Thank you. Very lucky to be here. Thank you. (Applause)

1
0:00:12.51,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So, imagine that you take a 19-hour, very long drive

2
0:00:19.842,000 --> 0:00:2,000
to Disney World,

3
0:00:21.186,000 --> 0:00:22,000
with two kids in the back seat.

4
0:00:24.076,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And 15 minutes into this 19-hour trip,

5
0:00:30.351,000 --> 0:00:32,000
the immutable laws of nature dictate

6
0:00:33.089,000 --> 0:00:35,000
that you get the question:

7
0:00:35.169,000 --> 0:00:36,000
"Are we there yet?"

8
0:00:36.557,000 --> 0:00:37,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:38.369,000 --> 0:00:41,000
So you answer this question a hundred more times, easily,

10
0:00:41.85,000 --> 0:00:42,000
in the negative,

11
0:00:43.033,000 --> 0:00:44,000
but you finally arrive.

12
0:00:44.457,000 --> 0:00:46,000
You have a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful trip.

13
0:00:47.254,000 --> 0:00:51,000
You drive 19 long hours back home.

14
0:00:53.358,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And when you get there,

15
0:00:54.919,000 --> 0:00:55,000
the police are waiting on you.

16
0:00:57.041,000 --> 0:00:59,000
They accuse you of committing a crime

17
0:00:59.453,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that occurred while you were away in Florida.

18
0:01:03.684,000 --> 0:01:05,000
You tell anybody and everybody who will listen,

19
0:01:06.59,000 --> 0:01:07,000
"I didn't do it!

20
0:01:08.077,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I couldn't have done it!

21
0:01:10.502,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I was hanging out with Mickey and Minnie and my kids!"

22
0:01:14.504,000 --> 0:01:15,000
But no one believes you.

23
0:01:17.104,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Ultimately, you're arrested,

24
0:01:19.624,000 --> 0:01:2,000
you're tried,

25
0:01:20.891,000 --> 0:01:21,000
you're convicted

26
0:01:22.215,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and you are sentenced.

27
0:01:24.098,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And you spend 25 years in jail,

28
0:01:28.054,000 --> 0:01:31,000
until someone comes along and proves --

29
0:01:33.384,000 --> 0:01:34,000
has the evidence to prove --

30
0:01:34.832,000 --> 0:01:37,000
that you actually were in Florida

31
0:01:38.5,000 --> 0:01:39,000
when this crime was committed.

32
0:01:41.626,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So.

33
0:01:43.651,000 --> 0:01:44,000
So, I'm a Harvard Law professor,

34
0:01:45.329,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and the last several years, I have worked on

35
0:01:50.105,000 --> 0:01:52,000
winning the release of innocent people

36
0:01:53.193,000 --> 0:01:55,000
who've been wrongfully convicted --

37
0:01:56.041,000 --> 0:01:57,000
people like Jonathan Fleming,

38
0:01:58.582,000 --> 0:02:01,000
who spent 24 years, eight months in jail

39
0:02:01.895,000 --> 0:02:04,000
for a murder that was committed in Brooklyn, New York,

40
0:02:05.517,000 --> 0:02:08,000
while he was in Disney World

41
0:02:09.024,000 --> 0:02:1,000
with his kids.

42
0:02:10.966,000 --> 0:02:11,000
How do we know this?

43
0:02:12.702,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Because when he was arrested,

44
0:02:15.108,000 --> 0:02:17,000
among his property in his back pocket

45
0:02:18.686,000 --> 0:02:19,000
was a receipt --

46
0:02:20.865,000 --> 0:02:21,000
time-stamped receipt

47
0:02:22.706,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that showed that he was in Disney World.

48
0:02:26.142,000 --> 0:02:29,000
That receipt was put in the police file,

49
0:02:29.291,000 --> 0:02:31,000
a copy of it was put in the prosecutor's file,

50
0:02:31.941,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and they never gave it to his public defender.

51
0:02:35.197,000 --> 0:02:36,000
In fact, nobody even knew it was there.

52
0:02:37.163,000 --> 0:02:39,000
It just sat there for 20-some-odd years.

53
0:02:40.746,000 --> 0:02:43,000
My team looked through the file, and we found it,

54
0:02:45.227,000 --> 0:02:46,000
did the rest of the investigation,

55
0:02:46.973,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and figured out someone else committed the crime.

56
0:02:49.284,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Mr. Fleming was in Disney World,

57
0:02:52.448,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and he is now released.

58
0:02:54.971,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Let me give you a little bit of context.

59
0:02:57.622,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So about three years ago, I got a call from the Brooklyn District Attorney.

60
0:03:01.784,000 --> 0:03:05,000
He asked whether I'd be interested in designing a program

61
0:03:05.891,000 --> 0:03:06,000
called a "conviction review unit."

62
0:03:07.893,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So I said yes.

63
0:03:09.198,000 --> 0:03:13,000
A conviction review unit is essentially a unit in a prosecutor's office

64
0:03:13.889,000 --> 0:03:16,000
where prosecutors look at their past cases

65
0:03:17.03,000 --> 0:03:19,000
to determine whether or not they made mistakes.

66
0:03:20.285,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Over the course of the first year,

67
0:03:22.341,000 --> 0:03:25,000
we found about 13 wrongful convictions,

68
0:03:25.459,000 --> 0:03:27,000
people having been in jail for decades,

69
0:03:28.018,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and we released all of them.

70
0:03:29.677,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It was the most in New York history.

71
0:03:32.379,000 --> 0:03:33,000
The program is still going on,

72
0:03:33.895,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and they're up to 21 releases now --

73
0:03:37.186,000 --> 0:03:41,000
21 people who spent significant time behind bars.

74
0:03:42.077,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So let me tell you about a couple other of the men and women

75
0:03:47.555,000 --> 0:03:5,000
that I interacted with in the course of this program.

76
0:03:50.863,000 --> 0:03:52,000
One name is Roger Logan.

77
0:03:54.019,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Mr. Logan had been in jail 17 years

78
0:03:57.146,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and wrote me a letter.

79
0:03:58.65,000 --> 0:04:,000
It was a simple letter; it basically said,

80
0:04:00.817,000 --> 0:04:03,000
"Professor Sullivan, I'm innocent. I've been framed.

81
0:04:03.895,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Can you look at my case?"

82
0:04:06.099,000 --> 0:04:09,000
At first blush, the case seemed like it was open and shut,

83
0:04:09.267,000 --> 0:04:11,000
but my research had shown

84
0:04:12.312,000 --> 0:04:14,000
that single-witness identification cases

85
0:04:14.959,000 --> 0:04:15,000
are prone to error.

86
0:04:17.197,000 --> 0:04:18,000
It doesn't mean he was innocent,

87
0:04:19.02,000 --> 0:04:22,000
it just means we ought to look a little bit closer at those cases.

88
0:04:22.361,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So we did.

89
0:04:23.695,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And the facts were relatively simple.

90
0:04:25.72,000 --> 0:04:28,000
The eyewitness said she heard a shot,

91
0:04:28.826,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and she ran to the next building and turned around and looked,

92
0:04:31.901,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and there was Mr. Logan.

93
0:04:34.252,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And he was tried and convicted and in jail for 17-some-odd years.

94
0:04:38.56,000 --> 0:04:4,000
But it was a single-witness case, so we took a look at it.

95
0:04:41.398,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I sent some people to the scene, and there was an inconsistency.

96
0:04:44.542,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And to put it politely:

97
0:04:49.703,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Usain Bolt couldn't have run from where she said she was

98
0:04:53.386,000 --> 0:04:54,000
to the other spot.

99
0:04:54.598,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Right?

100
0:04:55.774,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So we knew that wasn't true.

101
0:04:58.745,000 --> 0:05:,000
So it still didn't mean that he didn't do it,

102
0:05:00.866,000 --> 0:05:03,000
but we knew something was maybe fishy about this witness.

103
0:05:05.454,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So we looked through the file,

104
0:05:07.512,000 --> 0:05:09,000
a piece of paper in the file had a number on it.

105
0:05:09.875,000 --> 0:05:11,000
The number indicated that this witness had a record.

106
0:05:12.865,000 --> 0:05:15,000
We went back through 20 years of non-digitized papers

107
0:05:16.697,000 --> 0:05:18,000
to figure out what this record was about,

108
0:05:19.297,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and it turned out -- it turned out --

109
0:05:21.808,000 --> 0:05:24,000
the eyewitness was in jail

110
0:05:25.34,000 --> 0:05:26,000
when she said she saw what she saw.

111
0:05:29.538,000 --> 0:05:31,000
The man spent 17 years behind bars.

112
0:05:33.296,000 --> 0:05:37,000
The last one is a case about two boys,

113
0:05:38.087,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Willie Stuckey, David McCallum.

114
0:05:40.822,000 --> 0:05:41,000
They were arrested at 15,

115
0:05:43.14,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and their conviction was vacated 29 years later.

116
0:05:48.685,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Now this was a case,

117
0:05:50.503,000 --> 0:05:52,000
once again -- first blush, it looked open and shut.

118
0:05:53.331,000 --> 0:05:54,000
They had confessed.

119
0:05:55.57,000 --> 0:05:57,000
But my research showed that juvenile confessions

120
0:05:58.345,000 --> 0:05:59,000
without a parent present

121
0:05:59.858,000 --> 0:06:,000
are prone to error.

122
0:06:01.317,000 --> 0:06:03,000
The DNA cases proved this several times.

123
0:06:03.607,000 --> 0:06:04,000
So we took a close look.

124
0:06:05.528,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We looked at the confession,

125
0:06:07.401,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and it turned out,

126
0:06:08.589,000 --> 0:06:09,000
there was something in the confession

127
0:06:10.475,000 --> 0:06:11,000
that those boys could not have known.

128
0:06:12.467,000 --> 0:06:14,000
The only people who knew it were police and prosecutors.

129
0:06:15.222,000 --> 0:06:17,000
We knew what really happened;

130
0:06:17.517,000 --> 0:06:18,000
someone told them to say this.

131
0:06:19.1,000 --> 0:06:2,000
We don't exactly know who,

132
0:06:20.993,000 --> 0:06:21,000
which person did,

133
0:06:22.484,000 --> 0:06:24,000
but any rate, the confession was coerced,

134
0:06:25.403,000 --> 0:06:26,000
we determined.

135
0:06:27.242,000 --> 0:06:28,000
We then went back and did forensics

136
0:06:29.098,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and did a fulsome investigation

137
0:06:30.808,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and found that two other,

138
0:06:32.228,000 --> 0:06:34,000
much older, different heights, different hairstyle,

139
0:06:35.111,000 --> 0:06:37,000
two other people committed the crime,

140
0:06:37.469,000 --> 0:06:38,000
not these two boys.

141
0:06:39.161,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I actually went to court that day,

142
0:06:41.23,000 --> 0:06:44,000
for what's called a "vacatur hearing,"

143
0:06:44.796,000 --> 0:06:46,000
where the conviction is thrown out.

144
0:06:46.931,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I went to court; I wanted to see

145
0:06:49.281,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Mr. McCallum walk out of there.

146
0:06:51.812,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So I went to court,

147
0:06:52.99,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and the judge said something that judges say all the time,

148
0:06:55.783,000 --> 0:06:57,000
but this took on a really special meaning.

149
0:06:58.513,000 --> 0:07:,000
He looked up after the arguments and said,

150
0:07:01.157,000 --> 0:07:02,000
"Mr. McCallum,"

151
0:07:02.928,000 --> 0:07:03,000
he said five beautiful words:

152
0:07:05.414,000 --> 0:07:08,000
"You are free to go."

153
0:07:10.359,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Can you imagine?

154
0:07:11.997,000 --> 0:07:13,000
After just about 30 years:

155
0:07:15.135,000 --> 0:07:16,000
"You are free to go."

156
0:07:18.545,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And he walked out of that courtroom.

157
0:07:21.415,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Unfortunately, his codefendant, Mr. Stuckey,

158
0:07:24.619,000 --> 0:07:26,000
didn't get the benefit of that.

159
0:07:27.297,000 --> 0:07:28,000
You see, Mr. Stuckey died in prison

160
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:32,000
at 34 years old,

161
0:07:32.112,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and his mother sat at counsel table in his place.

162
0:07:36.718,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I'll never forget this the rest of my life.

163
0:07:39.3,000 --> 0:07:41,000
She just rocked at the table, saying,

164
0:07:42.301,000 --> 0:07:43,000
"I knew my baby didn't do this.

165
0:07:44.285,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I knew my baby didn't do this."

166
0:07:46.528,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And her baby didn't do this.

167
0:07:48.633,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Two other guys did it.

168
0:07:50.937,000 --> 0:07:53,000
If there's anything that we've learned, anything that I've learned,

169
0:07:54.247,000 --> 0:07:57,000
with this conviction integrity work,

170
0:07:57.459,000 --> 0:07:59,000
it's that justice doesn't happen.

171
0:08:01.599,000 --> 0:08:04,000
People make justice happen.

172
0:08:08.261,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Justice is not a thing that just descends from above

173
0:08:12.18,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and makes everything right.

174
0:08:14.422,000 --> 0:08:17,000
If it did, Mr. Stuckey wouldn't have died in prison.

175
0:08:19.576,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Justice is something

176
0:08:21.323,000 --> 0:08:24,000
that people of goodwill make happen.

177
0:08:25.705,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Justice is a decision.

178
0:08:32.212,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Justice is a decision.

179
0:08:35.281,000 --> 0:08:37,000
We make justice happen.

180
0:08:38.126,000 --> 0:08:39,000
You know, the scary thing is,

181
0:08:40.069,000 --> 0:08:42,000
in each of these three cases I described,

182
0:08:42.71,000 --> 0:08:44,000
it would have only taken just an extra minute --

183
0:08:45.336,000 --> 0:08:46,000
an extra minute --

184
0:08:46.975,000 --> 0:08:48,000
for someone to look through the file

185
0:08:49.142,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and find this receipt.

186
0:08:51.624,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Just one -- to look through the file, find the receipt,

187
0:08:55.504,000 --> 0:08:56,000
give it to the public defender.

188
0:08:58.702,000 --> 0:09:,000
It would have taken someone just a minute

189
0:09:01.268,000 --> 0:09:05,000
to look at the video confession and say, "That cannot be."

190
0:09:06.999,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Just a minute.

191
0:09:09.524,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And perhaps Mr. Stuckey would be alive today.

192
0:09:13.271,000 --> 0:09:16,000
It reminds me of one of my favorite poems.

193
0:09:16.676,000 --> 0:09:2,000
It's a poem that Benjamin Elijah Mays would always recite,

194
0:09:20.983,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and he called it "God's Minute."

195
0:09:22.72,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And it goes something like this:

196
0:09:24.317,000 --> 0:09:26,000
"I have only just a minute,

197
0:09:26.458,000 --> 0:09:28,000
only 60 seconds in it,

198
0:09:28.509,000 --> 0:09:3,000
forced upon me, can't refuse it,

199
0:09:30.808,000 --> 0:09:32,000
didn't seek it, didn't choose it.

200
0:09:33.098,000 --> 0:09:34,000
But it's up to me to use it.

201
0:09:34.676,000 --> 0:09:37,000
I must suffer if I lose it, give account if I abuse it.

202
0:09:38.995,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Just a tiny little minute,

203
0:09:41.925,000 --> 0:09:43,000
but eternity is in it."

204
0:09:45.723,000 --> 0:09:46,000
If I were to charge

205
0:09:47.297,000 --> 0:09:48,000
each and every one of us,

206
0:09:49.754,000 --> 0:09:51,000
I would want to say something like,

207
0:09:53.782,000 --> 0:09:54,000
"Every day,

208
0:09:55.688,000 --> 0:09:56,000
every day,

209
0:09:57.755,000 --> 0:09:59,000
take just one extra minute

210
0:10:01.62,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and do some justice.

211
0:10:04.752,000 --> 0:10:05,000
You don't have to --

212
0:10:06.178,000 --> 0:10:1,000
I mean, some people spend their careers and their lives,

213
0:10:10.215,000 --> 0:10:11,000
like public defenders,

214
0:10:11.477,000 --> 0:10:12,000
doing justice every day.

215
0:10:14.026,000 --> 0:10:16,000
But in your professional lives, whatever you do,

216
0:10:16.37,000 --> 0:10:17,000
take time out

217
0:10:18.084,000 --> 0:10:19,000
to just

218
0:10:20.396,000 --> 0:10:21,000
do some justice.

219
0:10:21.707,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Make a colleague feel better.

220
0:10:23.903,000 --> 0:10:25,000
If you hear something that's sexist,

221
0:10:27.208,000 --> 0:10:29,000
don't laugh, speak up.

222
0:10:30.217,000 --> 0:10:32,000
If someone is down, lift them up,

223
0:10:32.561,000 --> 0:10:34,000
one extra minute each day,

224
0:10:36.073,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and it'll be a great, great place.

225
0:10:38.419,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I want to show you something.

226
0:10:41.777,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Now, above me is a picture

227
0:10:44.776,000 --> 0:10:45,000
of David McCallum.

228
0:10:47.173,000 --> 0:10:49,000
This is the day he was released from prison.

229
0:10:50.077,000 --> 0:10:53,000
After 30 years, he got to hug a niece

230
0:10:53.158,000 --> 0:10:55,000
he had never been able to touch before.

231
0:10:57.198,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And I asked him then,

232
0:10:59.383,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I said, "What's the first thing you want to do?"

233
0:11:02.106,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And he said, "I just want to walk on the sidewalk

234
0:11:04.509,000 --> 0:11:06,000
without anybody telling me where to go."

235
0:11:07.29,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Wasn't bitter,

236
0:11:09.019,000 --> 0:11:1,000
just wanted to walk on the sidewalk.

237
0:11:11.655,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I spoke to Mr. McCallum about two weeks ago.

238
0:11:15.189,000 --> 0:11:16,000
I went to New York.

239
0:11:16.387,000 --> 0:11:18,000
It was on the two-year anniversary

240
0:11:19.174,000 --> 0:11:2,000
of his release.

241
0:11:21.1,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And we talked,

242
0:11:22.764,000 --> 0:11:24,000
we laughed, we hugged, we cried.

243
0:11:25.855,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And he's doing quite well.

244
0:11:28.084,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And one of the things he said when we met with him

245
0:11:31.994,000 --> 0:11:34,000
is that he now has dedicated his life

246
0:11:35.148,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and his career

247
0:11:36.541,000 --> 0:11:4,000
to ensuring that nobody else is locked up unjustly.

248
0:11:41.771,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Justice, my friends,

249
0:11:45.416,000 --> 0:11:46,000
is a decision.

250
0:11:47.346,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Thank you very much.

251
0:11:48.577,000 --> 0:11:52,000
(Applause)

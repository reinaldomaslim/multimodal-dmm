1
0:00:12.804,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So, my mother's a pediatrician,

2
0:00:15.792,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and when I was young, she'd tell the craziest stories

3
0:00:19.63,000 --> 0:00:22,000
that combined science with her overactive imagination.

4
0:00:23.444,000 --> 0:00:27,000
One of the stories she told was that if you eat a lot of salt,

5
0:00:27.619,000 --> 0:00:3,000
all of the blood rushes up your legs,

6
0:00:31.312,000 --> 0:00:32,000
through your body,

7
0:00:32.588,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and shoots out the top of your head,

8
0:00:34.691,000 --> 0:00:35,000
killing you instantly.

9
0:00:36.417,000 --> 0:00:37,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:37.501,000 --> 0:00:38,000
She called it "high blood pressure."

11
0:00:39.337,000 --> 0:00:4,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:41.005,000 --> 0:00:43,000
This was my first experience with science fiction,

13
0:00:43.939,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and I loved it.

14
0:00:45.771,000 --> 0:00:48,000
So when I started to write my own science fiction and fantasy,

15
0:00:48.922,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I was surprised that it was considered un-African.

16
0:00:52.114,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So naturally, I asked, what is African?

17
0:00:54.753,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And this is what I know so far:

18
0:00:57.555,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Africa is important.

19
0:00:59.843,000 --> 0:01:,000
Africa is the future.

20
0:01:01.298,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It is, though.

21
0:01:03.074,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And Africa is a serious place where only serious things happen.

22
0:01:07.421,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So when I present my work somewhere, someone will always ask,

23
0:01:11.92,000 --> 0:01:13,000
"What's so important about it?

24
0:01:14.515,000 --> 0:01:16,000
How does it deal with real African issues

25
0:01:17.058,000 --> 0:01:22,000
like war, poverty, devastation or AIDS?"

26
0:01:22.45,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And it doesn't.

27
0:01:24.107,000 --> 0:01:29,000
My work is about Nairobi pop bands that want to go to space

28
0:01:29.468,000 --> 0:01:32,000
or about seven-foot-tall robots

29
0:01:32.62,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that fall in love.

30
0:01:34.493,000 --> 0:01:37,000
It's nothing incredibly important.

31
0:01:37.73,000 --> 0:01:4,000
It's just fun, fierce and frivolous,

32
0:01:41.137,000 --> 0:01:43,000
as frivolous as bubble gum --

33
0:01:43.772,000 --> 0:01:44,000
"AfroBubbleGum."

34
0:01:46.241,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So I'm not saying that agenda art isn't important;

35
0:01:49.53,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I'm the chairperson of a charity

36
0:01:51.829,000 --> 0:01:57,000
that deals with films and theaters that write about HIV and radicalization

37
0:01:58.81,000 --> 0:02:,000
and female genital mutilation.

38
0:02:01.097,000 --> 0:02:03,000
It's vital and important art,

39
0:02:03.402,000 --> 0:02:06,000
but it cannot be the only art that comes out of the continent.

40
0:02:08.192,000 --> 0:02:1,000
We have to tell more stories

41
0:02:10.552,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that are vibrant.

42
0:02:13.097,000 --> 0:02:16,000
The danger of the single story is still being realized.

43
0:02:17.879,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And maybe it's because of the funding.

44
0:02:19.722,000 --> 0:02:22,000
A lot of art is still dependent on developmental aid.

45
0:02:23.649,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So art becomes a tool for agenda.

46
0:02:27.73,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Or maybe it's because we've only seen one image of ourselves for so long

47
0:02:32.172,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that that's all we know how to create.

48
0:02:34.643,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Whatever the reason, we need a new way,

49
0:02:37.84,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and AfroBubbleGum is one approach.

50
0:02:40.391,000 --> 0:02:43,000
It's the advocacy of art for art's sake.

51
0:02:44.489,000 --> 0:02:46,000
It's the advocacy of art that is not policy-driven

52
0:02:47.509,000 --> 0:02:48,000
or agenda-driven

53
0:02:49.065,000 --> 0:02:5,000
or based on education,

54
0:02:51.028,000 --> 0:02:54,000
just for the sake of imagination:

55
0:02:54.418,000 --> 0:02:55,000
AfroBubbleGum art.

56
0:02:56.649,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And we can't all be AfroBubbleGumists.

57
0:02:59.059,000 --> 0:03:03,000
We have to judge our work for its potential poverty porn pitfalls.

58
0:03:03.129,000 --> 0:03:06,000
We have to have tests that are similar to the Bechdel test,

59
0:03:09.184,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and ask questions like:

60
0:03:11.475,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Are two or more Africans in this piece of fiction healthy?

61
0:03:16.916,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Are those same Africans financially stable and not in need of saving?

62
0:03:23.193,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Are they having fun and enjoying life?

63
0:03:26.105,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And if we can answer yes to two or more of these questions,

64
0:03:29.227,000 --> 0:03:3,000
then surely we're AfroBubbleGumists.

65
0:03:31.855,000 --> 0:03:32,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:33.428,000 --> 0:03:37,000
(Applause)

67
0:03:38.229,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And fun is political,

68
0:03:40.267,000 --> 0:03:44,000
because imagine if we have images of Africans who were vibrant

69
0:03:44.543,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and loving and thriving

70
0:03:46.61,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and living a beautiful, vibrant life.

71
0:03:48.922,000 --> 0:03:5,000
What would we think of ourselves then?

72
0:03:51.327,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Would we think that maybe we're worthy of more happiness?

73
0:03:54.799,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Would we think of our shared humanity through our shared joy?

74
0:03:59.387,000 --> 0:04:,000
I think of these things when I create.

75
0:04:01.767,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I think of the people and the places that give me immeasurable joy,

76
0:04:04.992,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and I work to represent them.

77
0:04:06.999,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And that's why I write stories

78
0:04:08.66,000 --> 0:04:12,000
about futuristic girls that risk everything to save plants

79
0:04:13.154,000 --> 0:04:15,000
or to race camels

80
0:04:15.407,000 --> 0:04:17,000
or even just to dance,

81
0:04:17.871,000 --> 0:04:18,000
to honor fun,

82
0:04:19.616,000 --> 0:04:21,000
because my world is mostly happy.

83
0:04:21.763,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And I know happiness is a privilege in this current splintered world

84
0:04:25.557,000 --> 0:04:28,000
where remaining hopeful requires diligence.

85
0:04:31.105,000 --> 0:04:36,000
But maybe, if you join me in creating, curating and commissioning

86
0:04:36.472,000 --> 0:04:38,000
more AfroBubbleGum art,

87
0:04:38.525,000 --> 0:04:4,000
there might be hope for a different view of the world,

88
0:04:41.327,000 --> 0:04:43,000
a happy Africa view

89
0:04:43.507,000 --> 0:04:45,000
where children are strangely traumatized

90
0:04:45.559,000 --> 0:04:46,000
by their mother's dark sense of humor,

91
0:04:47.526,000 --> 0:04:48,000
(Laughter)

92
0:04:48.587,000 --> 0:04:52,000
but also they're claiming fun, fierce and frivolous art

93
0:04:53.173,000 --> 0:04:57,000
in the name of all things unseriously African.

94
0:04:57.91,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Because we're AfroBubbleGumists

95
0:05:00.556,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and there's so many more of us than you can imagine.

96
0:05:03.91,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Thank you so much.

97
0:05:05.138,000 --> 0:05:08,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.673,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Vision is the most important

2
0:00:15.055,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and prioritized sense that we have.

3
0:00:17.643,000 --> 0:00:18,000
We are constantly looking

4
0:00:19.327,000 --> 0:00:2,000
at the world around us,

5
0:00:21.101,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and quickly we identify and make sense

6
0:00:23.298,000 --> 0:00:25,000
of what it is that we see.

7
0:00:25.633,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Let's just start with an example

8
0:00:27.552,000 --> 0:00:28,000
of that very fact.

9
0:00:28.825,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I'm going to show you a photograph of a person,

10
0:00:30.835,000 --> 0:00:31,000
just for a second or two,

11
0:00:32.638,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and I'd like for you to identify

12
0:00:34.533,000 --> 0:00:36,000
what emotion is on his face.

13
0:00:36.672,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Ready?

14
0:00:37.9,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Here you go. Go with your gut reaction.

15
0:00:40.612,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Okay. What did you see?

16
0:00:42.943,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Well, we actually surveyed

17
0:00:45.207,000 --> 0:00:47,000
over 120 individuals,

18
0:00:47.514,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and the results were mixed.

19
0:00:49.464,000 --> 0:00:51,000
People did not agree

20
0:00:51.731,000 --> 0:00:53,000
on what emotion they saw on his face.

21
0:00:54.621,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Maybe you saw discomfort.

22
0:00:56.426,000 --> 0:00:57,000
That was the most frequent response

23
0:00:58.415,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that we received.

24
0:00:59.67,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But if you asked the person on your left,

25
0:01:01.759,000 --> 0:01:03,000
they might have said regret or skepticism,

26
0:01:04.5,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and if you asked somebody on your right,

27
0:01:06.429,000 --> 0:01:08,000
they might have said something entirely different,

28
0:01:09.323,000 --> 0:01:11,000
like hope or empathy.

29
0:01:12.143,000 --> 0:01:13,000
So we are all looking

30
0:01:13.702,000 --> 0:01:16,000
at the very same face again.

31
0:01:16.804,000 --> 0:01:17,000
We might see something

32
0:01:18.232,000 --> 0:01:2,000
entirely different,

33
0:01:20.615,000 --> 0:01:23,000
because perception is subjective.

34
0:01:23.679,000 --> 0:01:25,000
What we think we see

35
0:01:25.847,000 --> 0:01:26,000
is actually filtered

36
0:01:27.289,000 --> 0:01:29,000
through our own mind's eye.

37
0:01:29.693,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Of course, there are many other examples

38
0:01:31.946,000 --> 0:01:33,000
of how we see the world through own mind's eye.

39
0:01:34.361,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I'm going to give you just a few.

40
0:01:36.143,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So dieters, for instance,

41
0:01:38.803,000 --> 0:01:4,000
see apples as larger

42
0:01:40.821,000 --> 0:01:43,000
than people who are not counting calories.

43
0:01:43.841,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Softball players see the ball as smaller

44
0:01:47.474,000 --> 0:01:49,000
if they've just come out of a slump,

45
0:01:49.629,000 --> 0:01:52,000
compared to people who had a hot night at the plate.

46
0:01:53.173,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And actually, our political beliefs also

47
0:01:56.123,000 --> 0:01:58,000
can affect the way we see other people,

48
0:01:58.365,000 --> 0:02:,000
including politicians.

49
0:02:00.538,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So my research team and I decided to test this question.

50
0:02:04.231,000 --> 0:02:07,000
In 2008, Barack Obama was running for president

51
0:02:07.862,000 --> 0:02:08,000
for the very first time,

52
0:02:09.261,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and we surveyed hundreds of Americans

53
0:02:12.243,000 --> 0:02:14,000
one month before the election.

54
0:02:14.466,000 --> 0:02:15,000
What we found in this survey

55
0:02:16.165,000 --> 0:02:18,000
was that some people, some Americans,

56
0:02:18.451,000 --> 0:02:19,000
think photographs like these

57
0:02:20.147,000 --> 0:02:22,000
best reflect how Obama really looks.

58
0:02:23.139,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Of these people, 75 percent

59
0:02:25.761,000 --> 0:02:27,000
voted for Obama in the actual election.

60
0:02:28.628,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Other people, though, thought photographs like these

61
0:02:31.796,000 --> 0:02:33,000
best reflect how Obama really looks.

62
0:02:34.085,000 --> 0:02:35,000
89 percent of these people

63
0:02:36.061,000 --> 0:02:37,000
voted for McCain.

64
0:02:37.882,000 --> 0:02:4,000
We presented many photographs of Obama

65
0:02:41.388,000 --> 0:02:42,000
one at a time,

66
0:02:42.985,000 --> 0:02:44,000
so people did not realize that what we were changing

67
0:02:45.884,000 --> 0:02:46,000
from one photograph to the next

68
0:02:47.737,000 --> 0:02:49,000
was whether we had artificially lightened

69
0:02:49.793,000 --> 0:02:51,000
or darkened his skin tone.

70
0:02:52.341,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So how is that possible?

71
0:02:53.901,000 --> 0:02:55,000
How could it be that when I look at a person,

72
0:02:56.736,000 --> 0:02:57,000
an object, or an event,

73
0:02:58.457,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I see something very different

74
0:03:00.432,000 --> 0:03:01,000
than somebody else does?

75
0:03:02.261,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Well, the reasons are many,

76
0:03:04.551,000 --> 0:03:06,000
but one reason requires that we understand

77
0:03:06.802,000 --> 0:03:08,000
a little bit more about how our eyes work.

78
0:03:09.355,000 --> 0:03:11,000
So vision scientists know

79
0:03:11.364,000 --> 0:03:12,000
that the amount of information

80
0:03:12.847,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that we can see

81
0:03:14.718,000 --> 0:03:15,000
at any given point in time,

82
0:03:16.557,000 --> 0:03:18,000
what we can focus on, is actually relatively small.

83
0:03:19.254,000 --> 0:03:21,000
What we can see with great sharpness

84
0:03:21.983,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and clarity and accuracy

85
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
is the equivalent

86
0:03:26.147,000 --> 0:03:28,000
of the surface area of our thumb

87
0:03:28.323,000 --> 0:03:3,000
on our outstretched arm.

88
0:03:30.618,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Everything else around that is blurry,

89
0:03:32.757,000 --> 0:03:34,000
rendering much of what is presented

90
0:03:35.198,000 --> 0:03:37,000
to our eyes as ambiguous.

91
0:03:37.842,000 --> 0:03:39,000
But we have to clarify

92
0:03:40.116,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and make sense of what it is that we see,

93
0:03:42.364,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and it's our mind that helps us fill in that gap.

94
0:03:45.749,000 --> 0:03:48,000
As a result, perception is a subjective experience,

95
0:03:49.318,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and that's how we end up seeing

96
0:03:50.777,000 --> 0:03:52,000
through our own mind's eye.

97
0:03:53.005,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So, I'm a social psychologist,

98
0:03:54.818,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and it's questions like these

99
0:03:56.335,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that really intrigue me.

100
0:03:58.048,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I am fascinated by those times

101
0:03:59.699,000 --> 0:04:01,000
when people do not see eye to eye.

102
0:04:02.196,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Why is it that somebody might

103
0:04:03.893,000 --> 0:04:05,000
literally see the glass as half full,

104
0:04:06.505,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and somebody literally sees it

105
0:04:07.985,000 --> 0:04:08,000
as half empty?

106
0:04:09.456,000 --> 0:04:12,000
What is it about what one person is thinking and feeling

107
0:04:12.577,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that leads them to see the world

108
0:04:14.124,000 --> 0:04:16,000
in an entirely different way?

109
0:04:16.484,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And does that even matter?

110
0:04:18.947,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So to begin to tackle these questions,

111
0:04:21.998,000 --> 0:04:23,000
my research team and I decided to delve deeply

112
0:04:24.637,000 --> 0:04:25,000
into an issue that has received

113
0:04:26.487,000 --> 0:04:27,000
international attention:

114
0:04:28.405,000 --> 0:04:29,000
our health and fitness.

115
0:04:30.128,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Across the world,

116
0:04:31.486,000 --> 0:04:33,000
people are struggling to manage their weight,

117
0:04:33.888,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and there is a variety of strategies

118
0:04:36.102,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that we have to help us keep the pounds off.

119
0:04:39.459,000 --> 0:04:42,000
For instance, we set the best of intentions

120
0:04:42.565,000 --> 0:04:44,000
to exercise after the holidays,

121
0:04:45.262,000 --> 0:04:47,000
but actually, the majority of Americans

122
0:04:47.86,000 --> 0:04:49,000
find that their New Year's resolutions

123
0:04:49.902,000 --> 0:04:52,000
are broken by Valentine's Day.

124
0:04:52.958,000 --> 0:04:53,000
We talk to ourselves

125
0:04:54.46,000 --> 0:04:55,000
in very encouraging ways,

126
0:04:56.154,000 --> 0:04:57,000
telling ourselves this is our year

127
0:04:57.987,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to get back into shape,

128
0:04:59.688,000 --> 0:05:,000
but that is not enough to bring us back

129
0:05:01.53,000 --> 0:05:02,000
to our ideal weight.

130
0:05:03.265,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So why?

131
0:05:05.101,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Of course, there is no simple answer,

132
0:05:07.184,000 --> 0:05:09,000
but one reason, I argue,

133
0:05:09.947,000 --> 0:05:1,000
is that our mind's eye

134
0:05:11.873,000 --> 0:05:12,000
might work against us.

135
0:05:13.474,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Some people may literally see exercise

136
0:05:16.493,000 --> 0:05:17,000
as more difficult,

137
0:05:18.159,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and some people might literally

138
0:05:19.973,000 --> 0:05:21,000
see exercise as easier.

139
0:05:22.28,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So, as a first step to testing these questions,

140
0:05:26.028,000 --> 0:05:28,000
we gathered objective measurements

141
0:05:28.291,000 --> 0:05:3,000
of individuals' physical fitness.

142
0:05:31.137,000 --> 0:05:33,000
We measured the circumference of their waist,

143
0:05:33.479,000 --> 0:05:36,000
compared to the circumference of their hips.

144
0:05:36.735,000 --> 0:05:37,000
A higher waist-to-hip ratio

145
0:05:38.204,000 --> 0:05:4,000
is an indicator of being less physically fit

146
0:05:40.387,000 --> 0:05:42,000
than a lower waist-to-hip ratio.

147
0:05:42.459,000 --> 0:05:44,000
After gathering these measurements,

148
0:05:44.686,000 --> 0:05:45,000
we told our participants that

149
0:05:46.499,000 --> 0:05:47,000
they would walk to a finish line

150
0:05:48.083,000 --> 0:05:49,000
while carrying extra weight

151
0:05:49.966,000 --> 0:05:5,000
in a sort of race.

152
0:05:51.123,000 --> 0:05:52,000
But before they did that,

153
0:05:52.91,000 --> 0:05:54,000
we asked them to estimate the distance

154
0:05:55.35,000 --> 0:05:56,000
to the finish line.

155
0:05:57.037,000 --> 0:05:59,000
We thought that the physical states of their body

156
0:05:59.333,000 --> 0:06:02,000
might change how they perceived the distance.

157
0:06:02.818,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So what did we find?

158
0:06:04.578,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Well, waist-to-hip ratio

159
0:06:07.286,000 --> 0:06:1,000
predicted perceptions of distance.

160
0:06:10.302,000 --> 0:06:12,000
People who were out of shape and unfit

161
0:06:12.932,000 --> 0:06:14,000
actually saw the distance to the finish line

162
0:06:15.03,000 --> 0:06:16,000
as significantly greater

163
0:06:16.193,000 --> 0:06:17,000
than people who were in better shape.

164
0:06:18.084,000 --> 0:06:2,000
People's states of their own body

165
0:06:20.125,000 --> 0:06:23,000
changed how they perceived the environment.

166
0:06:23.361,000 --> 0:06:25,000
But so too can our mind.

167
0:06:25.477,000 --> 0:06:26,000
In fact, our bodies and our minds

168
0:06:27.386,000 --> 0:06:28,000
work in tandem

169
0:06:29.363,000 --> 0:06:31,000
to change how we see the world around us.

170
0:06:31.971,000 --> 0:06:33,000
That led us to think that maybe people

171
0:06:34.066,000 --> 0:06:35,000
with strong motivations

172
0:06:35.344,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and strong goals to exercise

173
0:06:37.164,000 --> 0:06:4,000
might actually see the finish line as closer

174
0:06:40.336,000 --> 0:06:43,000
than people who have weaker motivations.

175
0:06:44.036,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So to test whether motivations

176
0:06:46.378,000 --> 0:06:49,000
affect our perceptual experiences in this way,

177
0:06:49.73,000 --> 0:06:5,000
we conducted a second study.

178
0:06:51.653,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Again, we gathered objective measurements

179
0:06:54.334,000 --> 0:06:56,000
of people's physical fitness,

180
0:06:56.338,000 --> 0:06:58,000
measuring the circumference of their waist

181
0:06:58.396,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and the circumference of their hips,

182
0:07:00.164,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and we had them do a few other tests of fitness.

183
0:07:03.529,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Based on feedback that we gave them,

184
0:07:06.072,000 --> 0:07:07,000
some of our participants told us

185
0:07:07.637,000 --> 0:07:09,000
they're not motivated to exercise any more.

186
0:07:09.945,000 --> 0:07:11,000
They felt like they already met their fitness goals

187
0:07:12.339,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and they weren't going to do anything else.

188
0:07:14.472,000 --> 0:07:15,000
These people were not motivated.

189
0:07:16.091,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Other people, though, based on our feedback,

190
0:07:18.233,000 --> 0:07:2,000
told us they were highly motivated to exercise.

191
0:07:20.518,000 --> 0:07:22,000
They had a strong goal to make it to the finish line.

192
0:07:23.23,000 --> 0:07:25,000
But again, before we had them walk to the finish line,

193
0:07:26.227,000 --> 0:07:27,000
we had them estimate the distance.

194
0:07:28.197,000 --> 0:07:29,000
How far away was the finish line?

195
0:07:29.945,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And again, like the previous study,

196
0:07:32.307,000 --> 0:07:33,000
we found that waist-to-hip ratio

197
0:07:34.141,000 --> 0:07:35,000
predicted perceptions of distance.

198
0:07:36.101,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Unfit individuals saw the distance as farther,

199
0:07:40.733,000 --> 0:07:41,000
saw the finish line as farther away,

200
0:07:42.703,000 --> 0:07:43,000
than people who were in better shape.

201
0:07:44.65,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Importantly, though, this only happened

202
0:07:46.659,000 --> 0:07:47,000
for people who were not motivated

203
0:07:48.593,000 --> 0:07:49,000
to exercise.

204
0:07:50.212,000 --> 0:07:51,000
On the other hand,

205
0:07:51.802,000 --> 0:07:54,000
people who were highly motivated to exercise

206
0:07:54.846,000 --> 0:07:56,000
saw the distance as short.

207
0:07:57.043,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Even the most out of shape individuals

208
0:07:59.37,000 --> 0:08:,000
saw the finish line

209
0:08:00.928,000 --> 0:08:01,000
as just as close,

210
0:08:02.432,000 --> 0:08:03,000
if not slightly closer,

211
0:08:04.267,000 --> 0:08:06,000
than people who were in better shape.

212
0:08:06.923,000 --> 0:08:07,000
So our bodies can change

213
0:08:08.882,000 --> 0:08:1,000
how far away that finish line looks,

214
0:08:11.12,000 --> 0:08:14,000
but people who had committed to a manageable goal

215
0:08:15.039,000 --> 0:08:17,000
that they could accomplish in the near future

216
0:08:17.148,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and who believed that they were capable

217
0:08:19.342,000 --> 0:08:2,000
of meeting that goal

218
0:08:20.938,000 --> 0:08:23,000
actually saw the exercise as easier.

219
0:08:24.354,000 --> 0:08:25,000
That led us to wonder,

220
0:08:26.264,000 --> 0:08:28,000
is there a strategy that we could use

221
0:08:28.681,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and teach people that would help

222
0:08:31.071,000 --> 0:08:33,000
change their perceptions of the distance,

223
0:08:33.34,000 --> 0:08:35,000
help them make exercise look easier?

224
0:08:35.821,000 --> 0:08:37,000
So we turned to the vision science literature

225
0:08:38.455,000 --> 0:08:39,000
to figure out what should we do,

226
0:08:40.201,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and based on what we read, we came up with a strategy

227
0:08:42.683,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that we called, "Keep your eyes on the prize."

228
0:08:46.061,000 --> 0:08:47,000
So this is not the slogan

229
0:08:47.872,000 --> 0:08:48,000
from an inspirational poster.

230
0:08:49.757,000 --> 0:08:51,000
It's an actual directive

231
0:08:52.005,000 --> 0:08:54,000
for how to look around your environment.

232
0:08:54.927,000 --> 0:08:56,000
People that we trained in this strategy,

233
0:08:57.219,000 --> 0:09:,000
we told them to focus their attention on the finish line,

234
0:09:01.093,000 --> 0:09:02,000
to avoid looking around,

235
0:09:02.929,000 --> 0:09:03,000
to imagine a spotlight

236
0:09:04.27,000 --> 0:09:05,000
was shining on that goal,

237
0:09:05.893,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and that everything around it was blurry

238
0:09:08.372,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and perhaps difficult to see.

239
0:09:10.178,000 --> 0:09:12,000
We thought that this strategy

240
0:09:12.349,000 --> 0:09:14,000
would help make the exercise look easier.

241
0:09:14.842,000 --> 0:09:15,000
We compared this group

242
0:09:16.461,000 --> 0:09:17,000
to a baseline group.

243
0:09:18.119,000 --> 0:09:19,000
To this group we said,

244
0:09:19.324,000 --> 0:09:2,000
just look around the environment

245
0:09:20.911,000 --> 0:09:21,000
as you naturally would.

246
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
You will notice the finish line,

247
0:09:23.72,000 --> 0:09:24,000
but you might also notice

248
0:09:25.423,000 --> 0:09:26,000
the garbage can off to the right,

249
0:09:27.292,000 --> 0:09:29,000
or the people and the lamp post off to the left.

250
0:09:29.578,000 --> 0:09:31,000
We thought that people who used this strategy

251
0:09:32.263,000 --> 0:09:34,000
would see the distance as farther.

252
0:09:34.365,000 --> 0:09:36,000
So what did we find?

253
0:09:36.812,000 --> 0:09:37,000
When we had them estimate the distance,

254
0:09:38.785,000 --> 0:09:39,000
was this strategy successful

255
0:09:40.533,000 --> 0:09:42,000
for changing their perceptual experience?

256
0:09:43.033,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Yes.

257
0:09:44.231,000 --> 0:09:46,000
People who kept their eyes on the prize

258
0:09:46.436,000 --> 0:09:49,000
saw the finish line as 30 percent closer

259
0:09:49.485,000 --> 0:09:5,000
than people who looked around

260
0:09:51.096,000 --> 0:09:52,000
as they naturally would.

261
0:09:52.376,000 --> 0:09:53,000
We thought this was great.

262
0:09:53.684,000 --> 0:09:54,000
We were really excited because it meant

263
0:09:55.566,000 --> 0:09:56,000
that this strategy helped make

264
0:09:57.046,000 --> 0:09:58,000
the exercise look easier,

265
0:09:58.938,000 --> 0:09:59,000
but the big question was,

266
0:10:00.872,000 --> 0:10:01,000
could this help make exercise

267
0:10:02.709,000 --> 0:10:03,000
actually better?

268
0:10:04.1,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Could it improve the quality

269
0:10:05.765,000 --> 0:10:06,000
of exercise as well?

270
0:10:07.646,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So next, we told our participants,

271
0:10:09.909,000 --> 0:10:1,000
you are going to walk to the finish line

272
0:10:11.804,000 --> 0:10:13,000
while wearing extra weight.

273
0:10:14.031,000 --> 0:10:16,000
We added weights to their ankles

274
0:10:16.051,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that amounted to 15 percent of their body weight.

275
0:10:18.748,000 --> 0:10:19,000
We told them to lift their knees up high

276
0:10:20.696,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and walk to the finish line quickly.

277
0:10:22.915,000 --> 0:10:24,000
We designed this exercise in particular

278
0:10:25.075,000 --> 0:10:26,000
to be moderately challenging

279
0:10:26.797,000 --> 0:10:27,000
but not impossible,

280
0:10:28.574,000 --> 0:10:29,000
like most exercises

281
0:10:29.834,000 --> 0:10:31,000
that actually improve our fitness.

282
0:10:32.676,000 --> 0:10:34,000
So the big question, then:

283
0:10:35.336,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Did keeping your eyes on the prize

284
0:10:37.448,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and narrowly focusing on the finish line

285
0:10:39.78,000 --> 0:10:41,000
change their experience of the exercise?

286
0:10:42.545,000 --> 0:10:43,000
It did.

287
0:10:44.14,000 --> 0:10:46,000
People who kept their eyes on the prize

288
0:10:46.375,000 --> 0:10:47,000
told us afterward that it required

289
0:10:48.189,000 --> 0:10:5,000
17 percent less exertion

290
0:10:50.284,000 --> 0:10:51,000
for them to do this exercise

291
0:10:51.954,000 --> 0:10:54,000
than people who looked around naturally.

292
0:10:55.393,000 --> 0:10:57,000
It changed their subjective experience

293
0:10:57.457,000 --> 0:10:58,000
of the exercise.

294
0:10:59.08,000 --> 0:11:02,000
It also changed the objective nature

295
0:11:02.092,000 --> 0:11:03,000
of their exercise.

296
0:11:03.391,000 --> 0:11:05,000
People who kept their eyes on the prize

297
0:11:05.639,000 --> 0:11:07,000
actually moved 23 percent faster

298
0:11:08.287,000 --> 0:11:11,000
than people who looked around naturally.

299
0:11:11.735,000 --> 0:11:12,000
To put that in perspective,

300
0:11:13.417,000 --> 0:11:14,000
a 23 percent increase

301
0:11:15.09,000 --> 0:11:18,000
is like trading in your 1980 Chevy Citation

302
0:11:18.975,000 --> 0:11:22,000
for a 1980 Chevrolet Corvette.

303
0:11:23.619,000 --> 0:11:25,000
We were so excited by this,

304
0:11:26.131,000 --> 0:11:28,000
because this meant that a strategy

305
0:11:28.298,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that costs nothing,

306
0:11:29.98,000 --> 0:11:3,000
that is easy for people to use,

307
0:11:31.747,000 --> 0:11:32,000
regardless of whether they're in shape

308
0:11:33.718,000 --> 0:11:34,000
or struggling to get there,

309
0:11:35.576,000 --> 0:11:36,000
had a big effect.

310
0:11:37.016,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Keeping your eyes on the prize

311
0:11:38.573,000 --> 0:11:4,000
made the exercise look and feel easier

312
0:11:41.517,000 --> 0:11:43,000
even when people were working harder

313
0:11:44.075,000 --> 0:11:46,000
because they were moving faster.

314
0:11:46.294,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Now, I know there's more to good health

315
0:11:49.264,000 --> 0:11:51,000
than walking a little bit faster,

316
0:11:51.286,000 --> 0:11:53,000
but keeping your eyes on the prize

317
0:11:53.471,000 --> 0:11:54,000
might be one additional strategy

318
0:11:55.101,000 --> 0:11:56,000
that you can use to help promote

319
0:11:56.71,000 --> 0:11:58,000
a healthy lifestyle.

320
0:11:59.025,000 --> 0:12:01,000
If you're not convinced yet

321
0:12:01.106,000 --> 0:12:03,000
that we all see the world through our own mind's eye,

322
0:12:03.626,000 --> 0:12:05,000
let me leave you with one final example.

323
0:12:05.653,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Here's a photograph of a beautiful street in Stockholm, with two cars.

324
0:12:09.076,000 --> 0:12:11,000
The car in the back looks much larger

325
0:12:11.267,000 --> 0:12:12,000
than the car in the front.

326
0:12:12.693,000 --> 0:12:13,000
However, in reality,

327
0:12:14.299,000 --> 0:12:16,000
these cars are the same size,

328
0:12:16.678,000 --> 0:12:18,000
but that's not how we see it.

329
0:12:19.573,000 --> 0:12:21,000
So does this mean that

330
0:12:21.697,000 --> 0:12:22,000
our eyes have gone haywire

331
0:12:23.411,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and that our brains are a mess?

332
0:12:25.981,000 --> 0:12:27,000
No, it doesn't mean that at all.

333
0:12:28.553,000 --> 0:12:3,000
It's just how our eyes work.

334
0:12:30.574,000 --> 0:12:32,000
We might see the world in a different way,

335
0:12:33.263,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and sometimes that might not

336
0:12:35.035,000 --> 0:12:37,000
line up with reality,

337
0:12:37.101,000 --> 0:12:39,000
but it doesn't mean that one of us is right

338
0:12:39.226,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and one of us is wrong.

339
0:12:41.321,000 --> 0:12:43,000
We all see the world through our mind's eye,

340
0:12:43.457,000 --> 0:12:45,000
but we can teach ourselves to see it differently.

341
0:12:46.308,000 --> 0:12:47,000
So I can think of days

342
0:12:48.132,000 --> 0:12:5,000
that have gone horribly wrong for me.

343
0:12:50.166,000 --> 0:12:52,000
I'm fed up, I'm grumpy, I'm tired,

344
0:12:52.562,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and I'm so behind,

345
0:12:54.102,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and there's a big black cloud

346
0:12:56.508,000 --> 0:12:57,000
hanging over my head,

347
0:12:57.991,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and on days like these,

348
0:12:59.425,000 --> 0:13:,000
it looks like everyone around me

349
0:13:01.3,000 --> 0:13:03,000
is down in the dumps too.

350
0:13:03.434,000 --> 0:13:04,000
My colleague at work looks annoyed

351
0:13:05.167,000 --> 0:13:07,000
when I ask for an extension on a deadline,

352
0:13:07.877,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and my friend looks frustrated

353
0:13:09.855,000 --> 0:13:11,000
when I show up late for lunch because a meeting ran long,

354
0:13:12.554,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and at the end of the day,

355
0:13:14.147,000 --> 0:13:16,000
my husband looks disappointed

356
0:13:16.173,000 --> 0:13:18,000
because I'd rather go to bed than go to the movies.

357
0:13:18.706,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And on days like these, when everybody looks

358
0:13:21.723,000 --> 0:13:23,000
upset and angry to me,

359
0:13:23.731,000 --> 0:13:26,000
I try to remind myself that there are other ways of seeing them.

360
0:13:26.949,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Perhaps my colleague was confused,

361
0:13:30.259,000 --> 0:13:32,000
perhaps my friend was concerned,

362
0:13:32.695,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and perhaps my husband was feeling empathy instead.

363
0:13:35.962,000 --> 0:13:36,000
So we all see the world

364
0:13:37.856,000 --> 0:13:38,000
through our own mind's eye,

365
0:13:39.682,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and on some days, it might look

366
0:13:41.685,000 --> 0:13:42,000
like the world is a dangerous

367
0:13:43.093,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and challenging and insurmountable place,

368
0:13:45.63,000 --> 0:13:47,000
but it doesn't have to look that way all the time.

369
0:13:48.6,000 --> 0:13:5,000
We can teach ourselves to see it differently,

370
0:13:50.796,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and when we find a way to make the world

371
0:13:53.462,000 --> 0:13:54,000
look nicer and easier,

372
0:13:55.399,000 --> 0:13:57,000
it might actually become so.

373
0:13:57.739,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Thank you.

374
0:13:59.294,000 --> 0:14:02,000
(Applause)

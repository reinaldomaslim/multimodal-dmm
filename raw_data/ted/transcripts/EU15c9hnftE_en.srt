1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
So I was privileged to train in transplantation

2
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
under two great surgical pioneers:

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Thomas Starzl,

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
who performed the world's first successful liver transplant

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
in 1967,

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and Sir Roy Calne,

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
who performed the first liver transplant in the U.K.

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
in the following year.

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I returned to Singapore

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and, in 1990,

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
performed Asia's first successful

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
cadaveric liver transplant procedure,

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
but against all odds.

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Now when I look back,

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
the transplant was actually the easiest part.

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Next, raising the money to fund the procedure.

17
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
But perhaps the most challenging part

18
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
was to convince the regulators --

19
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
a matter which was debated in the parliament --

20
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that a young female surgeon

21
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
be allowed the opportunity

22
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
to pioneer for her country.

23
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
But 20 years on,

24
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
my patient, Surinder,

25
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
is Asia's longest surviving

26
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
cadaveric liver transplant to date.

27
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
(Applause)

28
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And perhaps more important,

29
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I am the proud godmother

30
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
to her 14 year-old son.

31
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
(Applause)

32
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
But not all patients on the transplant wait list

33
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
are so fortunate.

34
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
The truth is,

35
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
there are just simply not enough donor organs

36
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
to go around.

37
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
As the demand for donor organs

38
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
continues to rise,

39
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
in large part due to the aging population,

40
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
the supply has remained relatively constant.

41
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
In the United States alone,

42
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
100,000 men, women and children

43
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
are on the waiting list for donor organs,

44
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and more than a dozen die each day

45
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
because of a lack of donor organs.

46
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
The transplant community

47
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
has actively campaigned in organ donation.

48
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And the gift of life

49
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
has been extended

50
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
from brain-dead donors

51
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to living, related donors --

52
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
relatives who might donate an organ

53
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
or a part of an organ,

54
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
like a split liver graft,

55
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
to a relative or loved one.

56
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
But as there was still a dire shortage of donor organs,

57
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
the gift of life was then extended

58
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
from living, related donors

59
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
to now living, unrelated donors.

60
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And this then has given rise

61
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
to unprecedented and unexpected

62
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
moral controversy.

63
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
How can one distinguish

64
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
a donation that is voluntary and altruistic

65
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
from one that is forced or coerced

66
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
from, for example,

67
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
a submissive spouse, an in-law,

68
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
a servant, a slave,

69
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
an employee?

70
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Where and how can we draw the line?

71
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
In my part of the world,

72
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
too many people live below the poverty line.

73
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And in some areas,

74
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
the commercial gifting of an organ

75
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
in exchange for monetary reward

76
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
has led to a flourishing trade

77
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
in living, unrelated donors.

78
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Shortly after I performed the first liver transplant,

79
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I received my next assignment,

80
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and that was to go to the prisons

81
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
to harvest organs

82
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
from executed prisoners.

83
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I was also pregnant at the time.

84
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Pregnancies are meant

85
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
to be happy and fulfilling moments

86
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
in any woman's life.

87
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But my joyful period

88
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
was marred by solemn and morbid thoughts --

89
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
thoughts of walking through

90
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
the prison's high-security death row,

91
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
as this was the only route

92
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
to take me to the makeshift operating room.

93
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And at each time,

94
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I would feel the chilling stares

95
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
of condemned prisoners' eyes follow me.

96
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And for two years,

97
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I struggled with the dilemma

98
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
of waking up at 4:30 am

99
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
on a Friday morning,

100
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
driving to the prison,

101
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
getting down, gloved and scrubbed,

102
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
ready to receive the body

103
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
of an executed prisoner,

104
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
remove the organs

105
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and then transport these organs

106
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
to the recipient hospital

107
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and then graft the gift of life

108
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to a recipient the same afternoon.

109
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
No doubt, I was informed,

110
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
the consent had been obtained.

111
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
But, in my life,

112
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
the one fulfilling skill that I had

113
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
was now invoking feelings of conflict --

114
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
conflict ranging

115
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
from extreme sorrow and doubt at dawn

116
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
to celebratory joy

117
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
at engrafting the gift of life at dusk.

118
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
In my team,

119
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
the lives of one or two of my colleagues

120
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
were tainted by this experience.

121
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Some of us may have been sublimated,

122
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
but really none of us remained the same.

123
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I was troubled

124
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
that the retrieval of organs from executed prisoners

125
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
was at least as morally controversial

126
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
as the harvesting of stem cells

127
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
from human embryos.

128
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And in my mind,

129
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I realized as a surgical pioneer

130
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that the purpose of my position of influence

131
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
was surely to speak up

132
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
for those who have no influence.

133
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
It made me wonder

134
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
if there could be a better way --

135
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
a way to circumvent death

136
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and yet deliver the gift of life

137
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
that might exponentially impact

138
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
millions of patients worldwide.

139
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Now just about that time,

140
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
the practice of surgery evolved

141
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
from big to small,

142
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
from wide open incisions

143
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
to keyhole procedures,

144
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
tiny incisions.

145
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And in transplantation, concepts shifted

146
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
from whole organs to cells.

147
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
In 1988, at the University of Minnesota,

148
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
I participated in a small series

149
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
of whole organ pancreas transplants.

150
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I witnessed the technical difficulty.

151
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And this inspired in my mind

152
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
a shift from transplanting whole organs

153
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
to perhaps transplanting cells.

154
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I thought to myself,

155
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
why not take the individual cells

156
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
out of the pancreas --

157
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
the cells that secrete insulin to cure diabetes --

158
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and transplant these cells? --

159
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
technically a much simpler procedure

160
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
than having to grapple with the complexities

161
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
of transplanting a whole organ.

162
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And at that time,

163
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
stem cell research

164
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
had gained momentum,

165
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
following the isolation of the world's first

166
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
human embryonic stem cells

167
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
in the 1990s.

168
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
The observation that stem cells, as master cells,

169
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
could give rise

170
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
to a whole variety of different cell types --

171
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
heart cells, liver cells,

172
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
pancreatic islet cells --

173
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
captured the attention of the media

174
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and the imagination of the public.

175
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I too was fascinated

176
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
by this new and disruptive cell technology,

177
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and this inspired a shift in my mindset,

178
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
from transplanting whole organs

179
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
to transplanting cells.

180
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And I focused my research on stem cells

181
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
as a possible source

182
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
for cell transplants.

183
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Today we realize

184
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
that there are many different types of stem cells.

185
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Embryonic stem cells

186
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
have occupied center stage,

187
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
chiefly because of their pluripotency --

188
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
that is their ease in differentiating

189
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
into a variety of different cell types.

190
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
But the moral controversy

191
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
surrounding embryonic stem cells --

192
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
the fact that these cells are derived

193
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
from five-day old human embryos --

194
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
has encouraged research

195
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
into other types of stem cells.

196
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
Now to the ridicule of my colleagues,

197
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
I inspired my lab

198
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
to focus on what I thought

199
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
was the most non-controversial source of stem cells,

200
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
adipose tissue, or fat, yes fat --

201
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
nowadays available in abundant supply --

202
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
you and I, I think, would be very happy to get rid of anyway.

203
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Fat-derived stem cells

204
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
are adult stem cells.

205
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And adult stem cells

206
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
are found in you and me --

207
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
in our blood, in our bone marrow,

208
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
in our fat, our skin and other organs.

209
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And as it turns out,

210
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
fat is one of the best sources

211
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
of adult stem cells.

212
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
But adult stem cells

213
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
are not embryonic stem cells.

214
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And here is the limitation:

215
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
adult stem cells are mature cells,

216
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and, like mature human beings,

217
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
these cells are more restricted in their thought

218
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and more restricted in their behavior

219
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and are unable to give rise

220
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
to the wide variety of specialized cell types,

221
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
as embryonic stem cells [can].

222
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
But in 2007,

223
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
two remarkable individuals,

224
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Shinya Yamanaka of Japan

225
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and Jamie Thomson of the United States,

226
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
made an astounding discovery.

227
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
They discovered

228
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
that adult cells, taken from you and me,

229
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
could be reprogrammed

230
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
back into embryonic-like cells,

231
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
which they termed IPS cells,

232
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
or induced pluripotent stem cells.

233
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And so guess what,

234
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
scientists around the world and in the labs

235
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
are racing

236
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
to convert aging adult cells --

237
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
aging adult cells from you and me --

238
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
they are racing to reprogram these cells

239
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
back into more useful IPS cells.

240
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
And in our lab,

241
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
we are focused on taking fat

242
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and reprogramming

243
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
mounds of fat

244
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
into fountains of youthful cells --

245
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
cells that we may use

246
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
to then form other,

247
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
more specialized, cells,

248
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
which one day may be used as cell transplants.

249
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
If this research is successful,

250
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
it may then reduce the need

251
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
to research and sacrifice

252
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
human embryos.

253
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Indeed, there is a lot of hype, but also hope

254
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
that the promise of stem cells

255
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
will one day provide cures

256
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
for a whole range of conditions.

257
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Heart disease, stroke, diabetes,

258
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
spinal cord injury, muscular dystrophy,

259
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
retinal eye diseases --

260
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
are any of these conditions

261
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
relevant, personally, to you?

262
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
In May 2006,

263
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
something horrible happened to me.

264
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
I was about to start a robotic operation,

265
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
but stepping out of the elevator

266
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
into the bright and glaring lights of the operating room,

267
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
I realized

268
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
that my left visual field

269
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
was fast collapsing into darkness.

270
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Earlier that week,

271
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
I had taken a rather hard knock

272
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
during late spring skiing -- yes, I fell.

273
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And I started to see floaters and stars,

274
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
which I casually dismissed

275
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
as too much high-altitude sun exposure.

276
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
What happened to me

277
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
might have been catastrophic,

278
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
if not for the fact

279
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
that I was in reach of good surgical access.

280
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And I had my vision restored,

281
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
but not before a prolonged period of convalescence --

282
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
three months --

283
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
in a head down position.

284
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
This experience

285
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
taught me to empathize more with my patients,

286
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and especially those with retinal diseases.

287
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
37 million people worldwide

288
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
are blind,

289
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and 127 million more

290
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
suffer from impaired vision.

291
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Stem cell-derived retinal transplants,

292
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
now in a research phase,

293
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
may one day restore vision,

294
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
or part vision,

295
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
to millions of patients with retinal diseases worldwide.

296
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Indeed, we live

297
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
in both challenging

298
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
as well as exciting times.

299
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
As the world population ages,

300
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
scientists are racing

301
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
to discover new ways

302
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
to enhance the power of the body

303
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
to heal itself through stem cells.

304
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
It is a fact

305
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
that when our organs or tissues are injured,

306
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
our bone marrow

307
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
releases stem cells

308
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
into our circulation.

309
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And these stem cells

310
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
then float in the bloodstream

311
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and hone in to damaged organs

312
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
to release growth factors

313
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
to repair the damaged tissue.

314
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Stem cells may be used as building blocks

315
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
to repair damaged scaffolds within our body,

316
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
or to provide new liver cells

317
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
to repair damaged liver.

318
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
As we speak, there are 117 or so clinical trials

319
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
researching the use of stem cells

320
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
for liver diseases.

321
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
What lies ahead?

322
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Heart disease

323
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
is the leading cause of death worldwide.

324
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
1.1 million Americans

325
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
suffer heart attacks yearly.

326
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
4.8 million

327
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
suffer cardiac failure.

328
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Stem cells may be used

329
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
to deliver growth factors

330
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
to repair damaged heart muscle

331
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
or be differentiated

332
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
into heart muscle cells

333
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
to restore heart function.

334
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
There are 170 clinical trials

335
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
investigating the role of stem cells in heart disease.

336
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
While still in a research phase,

337
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
stem cells may one day herald

338
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
a quantum leap in the field of cardiology.

339
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Stem cells provide hope for new beginnings --

340
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
small, incremental steps,

341
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
cells rather than organs,

342
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
repair rather than replacement.

343
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Stem cell therapies

344
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
may one day reduce the need for donor organs.

345
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Powerful new technologies

346
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
always present enigmas.

347
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
As we speak,

348
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
the world's first human embryonic stem cell trial for spinal cord injury

349
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
is currently underway

350
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
following the USFDA approval.

351
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
And in the U.K.,

352
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
neural stem cells to treat stroke

353
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
are being investigated in a phase one trial.

354
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
The research success that we celebrate today

355
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
has been made possible

356
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
by the curiosity and contribution and commitment

357
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
of individual scientists

358
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and medical pioneers.

359
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
Each one has his story.

360
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
My story has been about my journey

361
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
from organs to cells --

362
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
a journey through controversy,

363
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
inspired by hope --

364
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
hope that, as we age,

365
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
you and I may one day celebrate longevity

366
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
with an improved quality of life.

367
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
Thank you.

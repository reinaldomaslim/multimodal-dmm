1
0:00:12.862,000 --> 0:00:15,000
My seven-year-old grandson sleeps just down the hall from me,

2
0:00:16.364,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and he wakes up a lot of mornings

3
0:00:18.054,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and he says,

4
0:00:19.616,000 --> 0:00:21,000
"You know, this could be the best day ever."

5
0:00:22.385,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And other times, in the middle of the night,

6
0:00:24.586,000 --> 0:00:26,000
he calls out in a tremulous voice,

7
0:00:27.536,000 --> 0:00:29,000
"Nana, will you ever get sick and die?"

8
0:00:31.018,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I think this pretty much says it for me and most of the people I know,

9
0:00:35.484,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that we're a mixed grill of happy anticipation

10
0:00:38.788,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and dread.

11
0:00:40.4,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So I sat down a few days before my 61st birthday,

12
0:00:44.646,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and I decided to compile a list of everything I know for sure.

13
0:00:49.837,000 --> 0:00:52,000
There's so little truth in the popular culture,

14
0:00:52.984,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and it's good to be sure of a few things.

15
0:00:57.037,000 --> 0:00:59,000
For instance, I am no longer 47,

16
0:01:00.665,000 --> 0:01:02,000
although this is the age I feel,

17
0:01:03.469,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and the age I like to think of myself as being.

18
0:01:06.674,000 --> 0:01:08,000
My friend Paul used to say in his late 70s

19
0:01:09.371,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that he felt like a young man with something really wrong with him.

20
0:01:12.978,000 --> 0:01:15,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:16.852,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Our true person is outside of time and space,

22
0:01:19.716,000 --> 0:01:2,000
but looking at the paperwork,

23
0:01:21.25,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I can, in fact, see that I was born in 1954.

24
0:01:25.173,000 --> 0:01:27,000
My inside self is outside of time and space.

25
0:01:28.149,000 --> 0:01:3,000
It doesn't have an age.

26
0:01:30.218,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I'm every age I've ever been, and so are you,

27
0:01:33.591,000 --> 0:01:35,000
although I can't help mentioning as an aside

28
0:01:36.299,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that it might have been helpful if I hadn't followed

29
0:01:38.954,000 --> 0:01:4,000
the skin care rules of the '60s,

30
0:01:41.499,000 --> 0:01:44,000
which involved getting as much sun as possible

31
0:01:44.917,000 --> 0:01:46,000
while slathered in baby oil

32
0:01:47.487,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and basking in the glow of a tinfoil reflector shield.

33
0:01:51.758,000 --> 0:01:52,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:53.496,000 --> 0:01:55,000
It was so liberating, though, to face the truth

35
0:01:56.118,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that I was no longer in the last throes of middle age,

36
0:01:59.49,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that I decided to write down every single true thing I know.

37
0:02:03.866,000 --> 0:02:06,000
People feel really doomed and overwhelmed these days,

38
0:02:07.288,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and they keep asking me what's true.

39
0:02:10.034,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So I hope that my list of things I'm almost positive about

40
0:02:16.407,000 --> 0:02:19,000
might offer some basic operating instructions

41
0:02:19.496,000 --> 0:02:22,000
to anyone who is feeling really overwhelmed or beleaguered.

42
0:02:23.96,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Number one:

43
0:02:25.866,000 --> 0:02:28,000
the first and truest thing is that all truth is a paradox.

44
0:02:29.551,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Life is both a precious, unfathomably beautiful gift,

45
0:02:33.89,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and it's impossible here, on the incarnational side of things.

46
0:02:38.596,000 --> 0:02:39,000
It's been a very bad match

47
0:02:40.24,000 --> 0:02:43,000
for those of us who were born extremely sensitive.

48
0:02:43.53,000 --> 0:02:45,000
It's so hard and weird that we sometimes wonder

49
0:02:46.418,000 --> 0:02:47,000
if we're being punked.

50
0:02:48.822,000 --> 0:02:52,000
It's filled simultaneously with heartbreaking sweetness and beauty,

51
0:02:53.8,000 --> 0:02:54,000
desperate poverty,

52
0:02:55.599,000 --> 0:02:58,000
floods and babies and acne and Mozart,

53
0:02:59.167,000 --> 0:03:01,000
all swirled together.

54
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I don't think it's an ideal system.

55
0:03:03.924,000 --> 0:03:06,000
(Laughter)

56
0:03:07.264,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Number two: almost everything will work again

57
0:03:10.683,000 --> 0:03:12,000
if you unplug it for a few minutes --

58
0:03:13.048,000 --> 0:03:15,000
(Laughter)

59
0:03:15.767,000 --> 0:03:18,000
(Applause)

60
0:03:19.073,000 --> 0:03:2,000
including you.

61
0:03:22.795,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Three: there is almost nothing outside of you

62
0:03:26.057,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that will help in any kind of lasting way,

63
0:03:28.993,000 --> 0:03:29,000
unless you're waiting for an organ.

64
0:03:31.778,000 --> 0:03:35,000
You can't buy, achieve or date serenity and peace of mind.

65
0:03:36.74,000 --> 0:03:39,000
This is the most horrible truth, and I so resent it.

66
0:03:41.369,000 --> 0:03:43,000
But it's an inside job,

67
0:03:43.617,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and we can't arrange peace or lasting improvement

68
0:03:46.459,000 --> 0:03:48,000
for the people we love most in the world.

69
0:03:48.871,000 --> 0:03:5,000
They have to find their own ways,

70
0:03:50.975,000 --> 0:03:51,000
their own answers.

71
0:03:52.621,000 --> 0:03:55,000
You can't run alongside your grown children

72
0:03:56.272,000 --> 0:04:,000
with sunscreen and ChapStick on their hero's journey.

73
0:04:00.882,000 --> 0:04:02,000
You have to release them.

74
0:04:03.023,000 --> 0:04:05,000
It's disrespectful not to.

75
0:04:06.908,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And if it's someone else's problem,

76
0:04:08.791,000 --> 0:04:1,000
you probably don't have the answer, anyway.

77
0:04:11.115,000 --> 0:04:12,000
(Laughter)

78
0:04:12.331,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Our help is usually not very helpful.

79
0:04:15.568,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Our help is often toxic.

80
0:04:18.644,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And help is the sunny side of control.

81
0:04:22.656,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Stop helping so much.

82
0:04:25.154,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Don't get your help and goodness all over everybody.

83
0:04:28.635,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Laughter)

84
0:04:31.171,000 --> 0:04:32,000
(Applause)

85
0:04:32.856,000 --> 0:04:33,000
This brings us to number four:

86
0:04:34.853,000 --> 0:04:37,000
everyone is screwed up, broken, clingy and scared,

87
0:04:38.761,000 --> 0:04:4,000
even the people who seem to have it most together.

88
0:04:41.76,000 --> 0:04:43,000
They are much more like you than you would believe,

89
0:04:44.223,000 --> 0:04:48,000
so try not to compare your insides to other people's outsides.

90
0:04:48.895,000 --> 0:04:5,000
It will only make you worse than you already are.

91
0:04:51.785,000 --> 0:04:53,000
(Laughter)

92
0:04:56.092,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Also, you can't save, fix or rescue any of them

93
0:04:59.587,000 --> 0:05:01,000
or get anyone sober.

94
0:05:01.646,000 --> 0:05:03,000
What helped me get clean and sober 30 years ago

95
0:05:04.424,000 --> 0:05:07,000
was the catastrophe of my behavior and thinking.

96
0:05:08.059,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So I asked some sober friends for help,

97
0:05:10.089,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and I turned to a higher power.

98
0:05:12.047,000 --> 0:05:16,000
One acronym for God is the "gift of desperation,"

99
0:05:16.13,000 --> 0:05:17,000
G-O-D,

100
0:05:17.583,000 --> 0:05:19,000
or as a sober friend put it,

101
0:05:19.639,000 --> 0:05:23,000
by the end I was deteriorating faster than I could lower my standards.

102
0:05:24.63,000 --> 0:05:3,000
(Laughter)

103
0:05:30.965,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So God might mean, in this case,

104
0:05:33.299,000 --> 0:05:36,000
"me running out of any more good ideas."

105
0:05:37.352,000 --> 0:05:41,000
While fixing and saving and trying to rescue is futile,

106
0:05:41.542,000 --> 0:05:44,000
radical self-care is quantum,

107
0:05:44.977,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and it radiates out from you into the atmosphere

108
0:05:48.617,000 --> 0:05:49,000
like a little fresh air.

109
0:05:50.286,000 --> 0:05:52,000
It's a huge gift to the world.

110
0:05:52.891,000 --> 0:05:56,000
When people respond by saying, "Well, isn't she full of herself,"

111
0:05:57.425,000 --> 0:05:59,000
just smile obliquely like Mona Lisa

112
0:06:00.415,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and make both of you a nice cup of tea.

113
0:06:04.425,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Being full of affection for one's goofy, self-centered,

114
0:06:09.132,000 --> 0:06:11,000
cranky, annoying self

115
0:06:11.649,000 --> 0:06:12,000
is home.

116
0:06:13.202,000 --> 0:06:15,000
It's where world peace begins.

117
0:06:16.858,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Number five:

118
0:06:18.599,000 --> 0:06:23,000
chocolate with 75 percent cacao is not actually a food.

119
0:06:23.687,000 --> 0:06:27,000
(Laughter)

120
0:06:27.723,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Its best use is as a bait in snake traps

121
0:06:31.827,000 --> 0:06:35,000
or to balance the legs of wobbly chairs.

122
0:06:36.411,000 --> 0:06:39,000
It was never meant to be considered an edible.

123
0:06:41.685,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Number six --

124
0:06:43.074,000 --> 0:06:46,000
(Laughter)

125
0:06:46.602,000 --> 0:06:47,000
writing.

126
0:06:48.694,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Every writer you know writes really terrible first drafts,

127
0:06:53.106,000 --> 0:06:55,000
but they keep their butt in the chair.

128
0:06:55.283,000 --> 0:06:56,000
That's the secret of life.

129
0:06:57.027,000 --> 0:07:,000
That's probably the main difference between you and them.

130
0:07:00.251,000 --> 0:07:01,000
They just do it.

131
0:07:01.737,000 --> 0:07:03,000
They do it by prearrangement with themselves.

132
0:07:04.327,000 --> 0:07:06,000
They do it as a debt of honor.

133
0:07:07.156,000 --> 0:07:09,000
They tell stories that come through them

134
0:07:09.474,000 --> 0:07:11,000
one day at a time, little by little.

135
0:07:12.008,000 --> 0:07:14,000
When my older brother was in fourth grade,

136
0:07:14.258,000 --> 0:07:17,000
he had a term paper on birds due the next day,

137
0:07:18.256,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and he hadn't started.

138
0:07:20.56,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So my dad sat down with him with an Audubon book,

139
0:07:24.666,000 --> 0:07:26,000
paper, pencils and brads --

140
0:07:27.034,000 --> 0:07:32,000
for those of you who have gotten a little less young and remember brads --

141
0:07:32.658,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and he said to my brother,

142
0:07:35.512,000 --> 0:07:37,000
"Just take it bird by bird, buddy.

143
0:07:38.146,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Just read about pelicans

144
0:07:40.485,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and then write about pelicans in your own voice.

145
0:07:44.365,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And then find out about chickadees,

146
0:07:47.544,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and tell us about them in your own voice.

147
0:07:50.339,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And then geese."

148
0:07:52.109,000 --> 0:07:55,000
So the two most important things about writing are: bird by bird

149
0:07:55.881,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and really god-awful first drafts.

150
0:07:59.779,000 --> 0:08:,000
If you don't know where to start,

151
0:08:01.478,000 --> 0:08:04,000
remember that every single thing that happened to you is yours,

152
0:08:04.731,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and you get to tell it.

153
0:08:06.672,000 --> 0:08:09,000
If people wanted you to write more warmly about them,

154
0:08:09.858,000 --> 0:08:1,000
they should've behaved better.

155
0:08:11.602,000 --> 0:08:14,000
(Laughter)

156
0:08:14.656,000 --> 0:08:16,000
(Applause)

157
0:08:18.965,000 --> 0:08:2,000
You're going to feel like hell if you wake up someday

158
0:08:21.862,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and you never wrote the stuff

159
0:08:23.647,000 --> 0:08:26,000
that is tugging on the sleeves of your heart:

160
0:08:27.132,000 --> 0:08:3,000
your stories, memories, visions and songs --

161
0:08:30.552,000 --> 0:08:31,000
your truth,

162
0:08:32.229,000 --> 0:08:33,000
your version of things --

163
0:08:34.078,000 --> 0:08:35,000
in your own voice.

164
0:08:35.587,000 --> 0:08:37,000
That's really all you have to offer us,

165
0:08:38.086,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and that's also why you were born.

166
0:08:42.308,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Seven: publication and temporary creative successes

167
0:08:46.517,000 --> 0:08:48,000
are something you have to recover from.

168
0:08:49.564,000 --> 0:08:51,000
They kill as many people as not.

169
0:08:52.43,000 --> 0:08:54,000
They will hurt, damage and change you

170
0:08:54.984,000 --> 0:08:56,000
in ways you cannot imagine.

171
0:08:57.527,000 --> 0:09:,000
The most degraded and evil people I've ever known

172
0:09:01.067,000 --> 0:09:04,000
are male writers who've had huge best sellers.

173
0:09:04.913,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And yet, returning to number one, that all truth is paradox,

174
0:09:09.094,000 --> 0:09:11,000
it's also a miracle to get your work published,

175
0:09:11.543,000 --> 0:09:13,000
to get your stories read and heard.

176
0:09:14.403,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Just try to bust yourself gently of the fantasy

177
0:09:17.182,000 --> 0:09:19,000
that publication will heal you,

178
0:09:19.66,000 --> 0:09:23,000
that it will fill the Swiss-cheesy holes inside of you.

179
0:09:23.768,000 --> 0:09:24,000
It can't.

180
0:09:25.386,000 --> 0:09:26,000
It won't.

181
0:09:26.77,000 --> 0:09:27,000
But writing can.

182
0:09:28.499,000 --> 0:09:31,000
So can singing in a choir or a bluegrass band.

183
0:09:32.121,000 --> 0:09:35,000
So can painting community murals or birding

184
0:09:35.452,000 --> 0:09:38,000
or fostering old dogs that no one else will.

185
0:09:40.39,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Number eight: families.

186
0:09:44.703,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Families are hard, hard, hard,

187
0:09:47.823,000 --> 0:09:5,000
no matter how cherished and astonishing they may also be.

188
0:09:51.273,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Again, see number one.

189
0:09:53.423,000 --> 0:09:54,000
(Laughter)

190
0:09:54.494,000 --> 0:09:58,000
At family gatherings where you suddenly feel homicidal or suicidal --

191
0:09:58.806,000 --> 0:09:59,000
(Laughter)

192
0:09:59.846,000 --> 0:10:01,000
remember that in all cases,

193
0:10:02.201,000 --> 0:10:07,000
it's a miracle that any of us, specifically, were conceived and born.

194
0:10:08.34,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Earth is forgiveness school.

195
0:10:10.291,000 --> 0:10:12,000
It begins with forgiving yourself,

196
0:10:12.425,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and then you might as well start at the dinner table.

197
0:10:16.46,000 --> 0:10:19,000
That way, you can do this work in comfortable pants.

198
0:10:20.129,000 --> 0:10:22,000
(Laughter)

199
0:10:23.099,000 --> 0:10:24,000
When William Blake said that we are here

200
0:10:25.07,000 --> 0:10:27,000
to learn to endure the beams of love,

201
0:10:28.082,000 --> 0:10:31,000
he knew that your family would be an intimate part of this,

202
0:10:31.439,000 --> 0:10:34,000
even as you want to run screaming for your cute little life.

203
0:10:35.631,000 --> 0:10:37,000
But I promise you are up to it.

204
0:10:38.214,000 --> 0:10:41,000
You can do it, Cinderella, you can do it,

205
0:10:41.618,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and you will be amazed.

206
0:10:44.984,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Nine: food.

207
0:10:48.007,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Try to do a little better.

208
0:10:51.317,000 --> 0:10:52,000
I think you know what I mean.

209
0:10:53.231,000 --> 0:10:56,000
(Laughter)

210
0:11:02.979,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Number 10 --

211
0:11:04.154,000 --> 0:11:06,000
(Laughter)

212
0:11:06.402,000 --> 0:11:07,000
grace.

213
0:11:08.248,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Grace is spiritual WD-40,

214
0:11:11.379,000 --> 0:11:12,000
or water wings.

215
0:11:12.883,000 --> 0:11:17,000
The mystery of grace is that God loves Henry Kissinger and Vladimir Putin

216
0:11:18.874,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and me

217
0:11:20.057,000 --> 0:11:24,000
exactly as much as He or She loves your new grandchild.

218
0:11:24.808,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Go figure.

219
0:11:26.049,000 --> 0:11:27,000
(Laughter)

220
0:11:27.85,000 --> 0:11:3,000
The movement of grace is what changes us, heals us

221
0:11:31.211,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and heals our world.

222
0:11:33.233,000 --> 0:11:36,000
To summon grace, say, "Help," and then buckle up.

223
0:11:37.028,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Grace finds you exactly where you are,

224
0:11:39.742,000 --> 0:11:41,000
but it doesn't leave you where it found you.

225
0:11:42.291,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And grace won't look like Casper the Friendly Ghost,

226
0:11:45.411,000 --> 0:11:46,000
regrettably.

227
0:11:47.04,000 --> 0:11:49,000
But the phone will ring or the mail will come

228
0:11:49.447,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and then against all odds,

229
0:11:50.951,000 --> 0:11:52,000
you'll get your sense of humor about yourself back.

230
0:11:54.391,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Laughter really is carbonated holiness.

231
0:11:58.694,000 --> 0:12:,000
It helps us breathe again and again

232
0:12:01.41,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and gives us back to ourselves,

233
0:12:03.567,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and this gives us faith in life and each other.

234
0:12:08.315,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And remember -- grace always bats last.

235
0:12:13.472,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Eleven: God just means goodness.

236
0:12:16.605,000 --> 0:12:18,000
It's really not all that scary.

237
0:12:19.07,000 --> 0:12:23,000
It means the divine or a loving, animating intelligence,

238
0:12:23.544,000 --> 0:12:26,000
or, as we learned from the great "Deteriorata,"

239
0:12:27.293,000 --> 0:12:28,000
"the cosmic muffin."

240
0:12:29.62,000 --> 0:12:31,000
A good name for God is: "Not me."

241
0:12:33.647,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Emerson said that the happiest person on Earth

242
0:12:36.417,000 --> 0:12:4,000
is the one who learns from nature the lessons of worship.

243
0:12:40.619,000 --> 0:12:43,000
So go outside a lot and look up.

244
0:12:43.769,000 --> 0:12:47,000
My pastor said you can trap bees on the bottom of mason jars without lids

245
0:12:48.296,000 --> 0:12:49,000
because they don't look up,

246
0:12:50.033,000 --> 0:12:54,000
so they just walk around bitterly bumping into the glass walls.

247
0:12:54.457,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Go outside. Look up.

248
0:12:56.849,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Secret of life.

249
0:12:59.297,000 --> 0:13:,000
And finally: death.

250
0:13:02.193,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Number 12.

251
0:13:04.466,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Wow and yikes.

252
0:13:07.195,000 --> 0:13:11,000
It's so hard to bear when the few people you cannot live without die.

253
0:13:11.444,000 --> 0:13:14,000
You'll never get over these losses, and no matter what the culture says,

254
0:13:15.105,000 --> 0:13:16,000
you're not supposed to.

255
0:13:16.996,000 --> 0:13:21,000
We Christians like to think of death as a major change of address,

256
0:13:22.163,000 --> 0:13:26,000
but in any case, the person will live again fully in your heart

257
0:13:26.773,000 --> 0:13:27,000
if you don't seal it off.

258
0:13:28.789,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Like Leonard Cohen said, "There are cracks in everything,

259
0:13:31.581,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and that's how the light gets in."

260
0:13:33.458,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And that's how we feel our people again fully alive.

261
0:13:39.06,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Also, the people will make you laugh out loud

262
0:13:43.095,000 --> 0:13:46,000
at the most inconvenient times,

263
0:13:46.185,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and that's the great good news.

264
0:13:48.283,000 --> 0:13:52,000
But their absence will also be a lifelong nightmare of homesickness for you.

265
0:13:52.762,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Grief and friends, time and tears will heal you to some extent.

266
0:13:57.467,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Tears will bathe and baptize and hydrate and moisturize you

267
0:14:01.742,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and the ground on which you walk.

268
0:14:04.095,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Do you know the first thing that God says to Moses?

269
0:14:07.848,000 --> 0:14:09,000
He says, "Take off your shoes."

270
0:14:10.899,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Because this is holy ground, all evidence to the contrary.

271
0:14:14.963,000 --> 0:14:17,000
It's hard to believe, but it's the truest thing I know.

272
0:14:18.052,000 --> 0:14:22,000
When you're a little bit older, like my tiny personal self,

273
0:14:22.218,000 --> 0:14:25,000
you realize that death is as sacred as birth.

274
0:14:26.605,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And don't worry -- get on with your life.

275
0:14:30.225,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Almost every single death is easy and gentle

276
0:14:34.744,000 --> 0:14:37,000
with the very best people surrounding you

277
0:14:37.784,000 --> 0:14:38,000
for as long as you need.

278
0:14:39.651,000 --> 0:14:4,000
You won't be alone.

279
0:14:42.506,000 --> 0:14:45,000
They'll help you cross over to whatever awaits us.

280
0:14:46.691,000 --> 0:14:47,000
As Ram Dass said,

281
0:14:48.452,000 --> 0:14:49,000
"When all is said and done,

282
0:14:50.336,000 --> 0:14:53,000
we're really just all walking each other home."

283
0:14:54.844,000 --> 0:14:55,000
I think that's it,

284
0:14:56.456,000 --> 0:14:58,000
but if I think of anything else,

285
0:14:58.582,000 --> 0:14:59,000
I'll let you know.

286
0:15:00.068,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Thank you.

287
0:15:01.295,000 --> 0:15:02,000
(Applause)

288
0:15:02.898,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Thank you.

289
0:15:04.198,000 --> 0:15:05,000
(Applause)

290
0:15:06.03,000 --> 0:15:08,000
I was very surprised to be asked to come,

291
0:15:08.208,000 --> 0:15:1,000
because it is not my realm,

292
0:15:10.915,000 --> 0:15:12,000
technology or design or entertainment.

293
0:15:13.266,000 --> 0:15:16,000
I mean, my realm is sort of faith and writing

294
0:15:16.471,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and kind of lurching along together.

295
0:15:19.445,000 --> 0:15:2,000
And I was surprised,

296
0:15:21.232,000 --> 0:15:25,000
but they said I could give a talk, and I said I'd love to.

297
0:15:25.529,000 --> 0:15:27,000
(Video) If you don't know where to start,

298
0:15:27.605,000 --> 0:15:3,000
remember that every single thing that happened to you is yours

299
0:15:30.754,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and you get to tell it.

300
0:15:32.156,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Anne Lamott: People are very frightened and feel really doomed

301
0:15:35.285,000 --> 0:15:36,000
in America these days,

302
0:15:36.497,000 --> 0:15:39,000
and I just wanted to help people get their sense of humor about it

303
0:15:39.662,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and to realize how much isn't a problem.

304
0:15:43.284,000 --> 0:15:46,000
If you take an action,

305
0:15:47.359,000 --> 0:15:5,000
take a really healthy or loving or friendly action,

306
0:15:50.946,000 --> 0:15:52,000
you'll have loving and friendly feelings.

1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Right now is the most exciting time

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to see new Indian art.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Contemporary artists in India are having a conversation with the world

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
like never before.

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I thought it might be interesting, even for the many long-time

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
collectors here with us at TED, local collectors,

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
to have an outside view of 10 young Indian artists

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I wish everyone at TED to know.

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
The first is Bharti Kher.

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
The central motif of Bharti's practice

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
is the ready-made store-bought bindi

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that untold millions of Indian women apply to their foreheads,

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
every day, in an act closely associated with

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
the institution of marriage.

15
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
But originally the significance of the bindi

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
is to symbolize the third eye

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
between the spiritual world and the religious world.

18
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Bharti seeks to liberate this everyday cliche, as she calls it,

19
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
by exploding it into something spectacular.

20
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
She also creates life-size fiberglass sculptures, often of animals,

21
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
which she then completely covers in bindis,

22
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
often with potent symbolism.

23
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
She says she first got started with

24
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
10 packets of bindis,

25
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and then wondered what she could do with 10 thousand.

26
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Our next artist, Balasubramaniam,

27
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
really stands at the crossroads of sculpture, painting and installation,

28
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
working wonders with fiberglass.

29
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Since Bala himself will be speaking at TED

30
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I won't spend too much time on him here today,

31
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
except to say that he really succeeds

32
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
at making the invisible visible.

33
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Brooklyn-based Chitra Ganesh

34
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
is known for her digital collages,

35
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
using Indian comic books called amar chitra kathas

36
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
as her primary source material.

37
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
These comics are a fundamental way

38
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that children, especially in the diaspora,

39
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
learn their religious and mythological folk tales.

40
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I, for one, was steeped in these.

41
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Chitra basically remixes and re-titles

42
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
these iconic images

43
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to tease out some of the sexual and gender politics

44
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
embedded in these deeply influential comics.

45
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And she uses this vocabulary in her installation work as well.

46
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Jitish Kallat successfully practices across photography,

47
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
sculpture, painting and installation.

48
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
As you can see, he's heavily influenced

49
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
by graffiti and street art,

50
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and his home city of Mumbai is an ever-present element in his work.

51
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
He really captures that sense of density

52
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and energy which really characterizes modern urban Bombay.

53
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
He also creates phantasmagoric sculptures

54
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
made of bones from cast resin.

55
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Here he envisions the carcass

56
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
of an autorickshaw he once witnessed burning in a riot.

57
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
This next artist, N.S. Harsha,

58
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
actually has a studio right here in Mysore.

59
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
He's putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition.

60
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
He creates these fine, delicate images

61
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
which he then repeats on a massive scale.

62
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
He uses scale to more and more spectacular effect,

63
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
whether on the roof of a temple in Singapore,

64
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
or in his increasingly ambitious installation work,

65
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
here with 192 functioning sewing machines,

66
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
fabricating the flags of every member of the United Nations.

67
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Mumbai-based Dhruvi Acharya

68
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
builds on her love of comic books and street art

69
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
to comment on the roles and expectations

70
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
of modern Indian women.

71
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
She too mines the rich source material of amar chitra kathas,

72
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
but in a very different way than Chitra Ganesh.

73
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
In this particular work, she actually strips out the images

74
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and leaves the actual text

75
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
to reveal something previously unseen, and provocative.

76
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Raqib Shaw is Kolkata-born,

77
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
Kashmir-raised,

78
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and London-trained.

79
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
He too is reinventing the miniature tradition.

80
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
He creates these opulent tableaus inspired by Hieronymus Bosch,

81
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
but also by the Kashmiri textiles of his youth.

82
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
He actually applies metallic industrial paints to his work

83
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
using porcupine quills to get this rich detailed effect.

84
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I'm kind of cheating with this next artist

85
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
since Raqs Media Collective are really

86
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
three artists working together.

87
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Raqs are probably the foremost practitioners

88
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
of multimedia art in India today,

89
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
working across photography, video and installation.

90
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
They frequently explore themes of globalization and urbanization,

91
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and their home of Delhi is a frequent element in their work.

92
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Here, they invite the viewer to analyze a crime

93
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
looking at evidence and clues embedded

94
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
in five narratives on these five different screens,

95
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
in which the city itself may have been the culprit.

96
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
This next artist is probably the alpha male

97
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
of contemporary Indian art, Subodh Gupta.

98
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
He was first known for creating giant photo-realistic canvases,

99
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
paintings of everyday objects,

100
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
the stainless steel kitchen vessels and tiffin containers

101
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
known to every Indian.

102
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
He celebrates these local and mundane objects globally,

103
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and on a grander and grander scale,

104
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
by incorporating them into ever more colossal

105
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
sculptures and installations.

106
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And finally number 10, last and certainly not least,

107
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Ranjani Shettar,

108
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
who lives and works here in the state of Karnataka,

109
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
creates ethereal sculptures and installations

110
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
that really marry the organic to the industrial,

111
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and brings, like Subodh, the local global.

112
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
These are actually wires wrapped in muslin

113
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and steeped in vegetable dye.

114
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And she arranges them so that the viewer

115
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
actually has to navigate through the space,

116
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and interact with the objects.

117
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And light and shadow are a very important part of her work.

118
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
She also explores themes of consumerism,

119
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
and the environment, such as in this work,

120
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
where these basket-like objects look organic and woven,

121
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and are woven,

122
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
but with the strips of steel, salvaged from cars

123
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
that she found in a Bangalore junkyard.

124
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
10 artists, six minutes, I know that was a lot to take in.

125
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
But I can only hope I've whet your appetite

126
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
to go out and see and learn more

127
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
about the amazing things that are happening in art in India today.

128
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Thank you very much for looking and listening.

129
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So let me just start with my story.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
So I tore my knee joint meniscus cartilage

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
playing soccer in college.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Then I went on to tear my ACL, the ligament in my knee,

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and then developed an arthritic knee.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And I'm sure that many of you in this audience have that same story,

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and, by the way, I married a woman

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
who has exactly the same story.

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So this motivated me to become an orthopedic surgeon

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and to see if I couldn't focus on solutions for those problems

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that would keep me playing sports and not limit me.

12
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
So with that, let me just show you a quick video

13
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
to get you in the mood of what we're trying to explain.

14
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Narrator: We are all aware of the risk of cancer,

15
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
but there's another disease

16
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that's destined to affect even more of us: arthritis.

17
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Cancer may kill you, but when you look at the numbers,

18
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
arthritis ruins more lives.

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Assuming you live a long life, there's a 50 percent chance

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
you'll develop arthritis.

21
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And it's not just aging that causes arthritis.

22
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Common injuries can lead to decades of pain,

23
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
until our joints quite literally grind to a halt.

24
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Desperate for a solution, we've turned to engineering

25
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
to design artificial components

26
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
to replace our worn-out body parts,

27
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
but in the midst of the modern buzz

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
around the promises of a bionic body,

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
shouldn't we stop and ask if there's a better, more natural way?

30
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Let's consider an alternative path.

31
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
What if all the replacements our bodies need

32
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
already exist in nature,

33
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
or within our own stem cells?

34
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
This is the field of biologic replacements,

35
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
where we replace worn-out parts with new, natural ones.

36
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Kevin Stone: And so, the mission is:

37
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
how do I treat these things biologically?

38
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And let's talk about both what I did for my wife,

39
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and what I've done for hundreds of other patients.

40
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
First thing for my wife,

41
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and the most common thing I hear from my patients,

42
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
particularly in the 40- to 80-year-old age group, 70-year-old age group,

43
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
is they come in and say,

44
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
"Hey, Doc, isn't there just a shock absorber you can put in my knee?

45
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I'm not ready for joint replacement."

46
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And so for her, I put in a human meniscus allograft donor

47
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
right into that [knee] joint space.

48
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And [the allograft] replaces [the missing meniscus].

49
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And then for that unstable ligament,

50
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
we put in a human donor ligament

51
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
to stabilize the knee.

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And then for the damaged arthritis on the surface,

53
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
we did a stem cell paste graft,

54
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
which we designed in 1991,

55
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to regrow that articular cartilage surface

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and give it back a smooth surface there.

57
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So here's my wife's bad knee on the left,

58
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and her just hiking now

59
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
four months later in Aspen, and doing well.

60
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And it works, not just for my wife, but certainly for other patients.

61
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
The girl on the video, Jen Hudak,

62
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
just won the Superpipe in Aspen

63
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
just nine months after having destroyed her knee,

64
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
as you see in the other image --

65
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and having a paste graft to that knee.

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And so we can regrow these surfaces biologically.

67
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So with all this success,

68
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
why isn't that good enough, you might ask.

69
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Well the reason is because there's not enough donor cycles.

70
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
There's not enough young, healthy people

71
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
falling off their motorcycle

72
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and donating that tissue to us.

73
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And the tissue's very expensive.

74
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And so that's not going to be a solution

75
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that's going to get us global with biologic tissue.

76
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But the solution is animal tissue

77
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
because it's plentiful, it's cheap,

78
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
you can get it from young, healthy tissues,

79
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
but the barrier is immunology.

80
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And the specific barrier

81
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
is a specific epitope

82
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
called the galactosyl, or gal epitope.

83
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So if we're going to transplant animal tissues to people,

84
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
we have to figure out a way to get rid of that epitope.

85
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So my story in working with animal tissues

86
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
starts in 1984.

87
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And I started first

88
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
with cow Achilles tendon,

89
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
where we would take the cow Achilles tendon,

90
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
which is type-I collagen,

91
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
strip it of its antigens

92
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
by degrading it with an acid and detergent wash

93
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
and forming it into a regeneration template.

94
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
We would then take that regeneration template

95
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and insert it into the missing meniscus cartilage

96
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
to regrow that in a patient's knee.

97
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
We've now done that procedure,

98
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and it's been done worldwide in over 4,000 cases,

99
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
so it's an FDA-approved and worldwide-accepted way

100
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to regrow the meniscus.

101
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And that's great when I can degrade the tissue.

102
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
But what happens for your ligament when I need an intact ligament?

103
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I can't grind it up in a blender.

104
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So in that case,

105
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I have to design -- and we designed with Uri Galili and Tom Turek --

106
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
an enzyme wash

107
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
to wash away, or strip,

108
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
those galactosyl epitopes

109
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
with a specific enzyme.

110
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And we call that a "gal stripping" technique.

111
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
What we do is humanize the tissue.

112
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
It's by gal stripping that tissue

113
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
we humanize it (Laughter),

114
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and then we can put it back

115
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
into a patient's knee.

116
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And we've done that. Now we've taken pig ligament --

117
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
young, healthy, big tissue,

118
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
put it into 10 patients in an FDA-approved trial --

119
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and then one of our patients went on to have

120
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
three Canadian Masters Downhill championships --

121
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
on his "pig-lig," as he calls it. So we know it can work.

122
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And there's a wide clinical trial of this tissue now pending.

123
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So what about the next step?

124
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
What about getting to a total biologic knee replacement,

125
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
not just the parts?

126
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
How are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement?

127
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Well here's how we're going to do it.

128
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So what we're going to do is take

129
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
an articular cartilage

130
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
from a young, healthy pig,

131
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
strip it of its antigens,

132
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
load it with your stem cells,

133
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
then put it back on to that

134
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
arthritic surface in your knee,

135
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
tack it on there, have you heal that surface

136
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and then create a new biologic surface for your knee.

137
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So that's our biologic approach right now.

138
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
We're going to rebuild your knee with the parts.

139
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
We're going to resurface it with a completely new surface.

140
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
But we have other advantages from the animal kingdom.

141
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
There's a benefit of 400 million years

142
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
of ambulation.

143
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We can harness those benefits.

144
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
We can use thicker, younger, better tissues

145
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
than you might have injured in your knee,

146
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
or that you might have when you're 40, 50 or 60.

147
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
We can do it as an outpatient procedure.

148
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
We can strip that tissue very economically,

149
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and so this is how we can get biologic knee replacement

150
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
to go global.

151
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And so welcome to super biologics.

152
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
It's not hardware.

153
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
It's not software.

154
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
It's bioware.

155
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
It's version 2.0 of you.

156
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And so with that, coming to a --

157
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
(Laughter)

158
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
coming to an operating theater near you soon, I believe.

159
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Thank you very much.

160
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:19.208,000 --> 0:00:2,000
A question I'm often asked is,

2
0:00:21.168,000 --> 0:00:25,000
where did I get my passion for human rights and justice?

3
0:00:26.658,000 --> 0:00:27,000
It started early.

4
0:00:28.515,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I grew up in the west of Ireland,

5
0:00:30.816,000 --> 0:00:32,000
wedged between four brothers,

6
0:00:32.901,000 --> 0:00:34,000
two older than me and two younger than me.

7
0:00:35.695,000 --> 0:00:38,000
So of course I had to be interested in human rights,

8
0:00:38.93,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and equality and justice,

9
0:00:41.459,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and using my elbows!

10
0:00:43.204,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:45.041,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And those issues stayed with me and guided me,

12
0:00:48.054,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and in particular,

13
0:00:49.704,000 --> 0:00:53,000
when I was elected the first woman President of Ireland,

14
0:00:54.278,000 --> 0:00:56,000
from 1990 to 1997.

15
0:00:57.539,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I dedicated my presidency

16
0:01:00.08,000 --> 0:01:05,000
to having a space for those who felt marginalized on the island of Ireland,

17
0:01:05.561,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and bringing together communities from Northern Ireland

18
0:01:08.314,000 --> 0:01:09,000
with those from the Republic,

19
0:01:10.078,000 --> 0:01:11,000
trying to build peace.

20
0:01:12.465,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And I went as the first Irish president to the United Kingdom

21
0:01:17.739,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and met with Queen Elizabeth II,

22
0:01:20.749,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and also welcomed to my official residence --

23
0:01:24.581,000 --> 0:01:27,000
which we call "Áras an Uachtaráin," the house of the president --

24
0:01:28.384,000 --> 0:01:3,000
members of the royal family,

25
0:01:30.654,000 --> 0:01:32,000
including, notably, the Prince of Wales.

26
0:01:33.946,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And I was aware that at the time of my presidency,

27
0:01:40.332,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Ireland was a country beginning a rapid economic progress.

28
0:01:45.772,000 --> 0:01:51,000
We were a country that was benefiting from the solidarity of the European Union.

29
0:01:53.607,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Indeed, when Ireland first joined the European Union in 1973,

30
0:01:58.635,000 --> 0:02:01,000
there were parts of the country that were considered developing,

31
0:02:02.015,000 --> 0:02:05,000
including my own beloved native county, County Mayo.

32
0:02:06.563,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I led trade delegations here to the United States,

33
0:02:10.898,000 --> 0:02:12,000
to Japan, to India,

34
0:02:13.808,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to encourage investment, to help to create jobs,

35
0:02:17.098,000 --> 0:02:18,000
to build up our economy,

36
0:02:18.448,000 --> 0:02:2,000
to build up our health system, our education --

37
0:02:20.766,000 --> 0:02:21,000
our development.

38
0:02:22.956,000 --> 0:02:25,000
What I didn't have to do as president

39
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
was buy land on mainland Europe,

40
0:02:30.665,000 --> 0:02:36,000
so that Irish citizens could go there because our island was going underwater.

41
0:02:37.711,000 --> 0:02:38,000
What I didn't have to think about,

42
0:02:39.365,000 --> 0:02:41,000
either as president or as a constitutional lawyer,

43
0:02:42.064,000 --> 0:02:45,000
was the implications for the sovereignty of the territory

44
0:02:45.74,000 --> 0:02:47,000
because of the impact of climate change.

45
0:02:49.309,000 --> 0:02:53,000
But that is what President Tong, of the Republic of Kiribati,

46
0:02:54.104,000 --> 0:02:56,000
has to wake up every morning thinking about.

47
0:02:57.47,000 --> 0:03:02,000
He has bought land in Fiji as an insurance policy,

48
0:03:02.752,000 --> 0:03:04,000
what he calls, "migration with dignity,"

49
0:03:06.537,000 --> 0:03:1,000
because he knows that his people may have to leave their islands.

50
0:03:12.295,000 --> 0:03:17,000
As I listened to President Tong describing the situation,

51
0:03:17.407,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I really felt that this was a problem that no leader should have to face.

52
0:03:24.194,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And as I heard him speak about the pain of his problems,

53
0:03:29.984,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I thought about Eleanor Roosevelt.

54
0:03:33.703,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I thought about her and those who worked with her

55
0:03:38.103,000 --> 0:03:43,000
on the Commission on Human Rights, which she chaired in 1948,

56
0:03:43.205,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and drew up the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

57
0:03:48.036,000 --> 0:03:51,000
For them, it would have been unimaginable

58
0:03:51.638,000 --> 0:03:55,000
that a whole country could go out of existence

59
0:03:56.296,000 --> 0:03:59,000
because of human-induced climate change.

60
0:03:59.741,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I came to climate change not as a scientist or an environmental lawyer,

61
0:04:04.514,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and I wasn't really impressed by the images of polar bears

62
0:04:08.497,000 --> 0:04:09,000
or melting glaciers.

63
0:04:10.131,000 --> 0:04:13,000
It was because of the impact on people,

64
0:04:14.004,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and the impact on their rights --

65
0:04:17.101,000 --> 0:04:22,000
their rights to food and safe water, health, education and shelter.

66
0:04:22.256,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And I say this with humility,

67
0:04:26.657,000 --> 0:04:29,000
because I came late to the issue of climate change.

68
0:04:30.894,000 --> 0:04:31,000
When I served

69
0:04:32.069,000 --> 0:04:34,000
as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights

70
0:04:34.093,000 --> 0:04:37,000
from 1997 to 2002,

71
0:04:37.347,000 --> 0:04:39,000
climate change wasn't at the front of my mind.

72
0:04:39.577,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I don't remember making a single speech on climate change.

73
0:04:43.498,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I knew that there was another part of the United Nations --

74
0:04:46.825,000 --> 0:04:48,000
the UN Convention on Climate Change --

75
0:04:49.007,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that was dealing with the issue of climate change.

76
0:04:52.752,000 --> 0:04:56,000
It was later when I started to work in African countries

77
0:04:57.136,000 --> 0:05:,000
on issues of development and human rights.

78
0:05:00.428,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And I kept hearing this pervasive sentence:

79
0:05:03.714,000 --> 0:05:07,000
"Oh, but things are so much worse now, things are so much worse."

80
0:05:08.502,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And then I explored what was behind that;

81
0:05:11.892,000 --> 0:05:14,000
it was about changes in the climate --

82
0:05:15.225,000 --> 0:05:17,000
climate shocks, changes in the weather.

83
0:05:18.859,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I met Constance Okollet,

84
0:05:20.911,000 --> 0:05:23,000
who had formed a women's group in Eastern Uganda,

85
0:05:24.093,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and she told me that when she was growing up,

86
0:05:26.744,000 --> 0:05:3,000
she had a very normal life in her village and they didn't go hungry,

87
0:05:31.101,000 --> 0:05:36,000
they knew that the seasons would come as they were predicted to come,

88
0:05:36.454,000 --> 0:05:38,000
they knew when to sow and they knew when to harvest,

89
0:05:39.255,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and so they had enough food.

90
0:05:42.008,000 --> 0:05:44,000
But, in recent years,

91
0:05:44.357,000 --> 0:05:45,000
at the time of this conversation,

92
0:05:46.305,000 --> 0:05:49,000
they had nothing but long periods of drought,

93
0:05:49.559,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and then flash flooding,

94
0:05:51.234,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and then more drought.

95
0:05:53.28,000 --> 0:05:54,000
The school had been destroyed,

96
0:05:54.845,000 --> 0:05:55,000
livelihoods had been destroyed,

97
0:05:56.408,000 --> 0:05:57,000
their harvest had been destroyed.

98
0:05:58.206,000 --> 0:06:02,000
She forms this women's group to try to keep her community together.

99
0:06:03.169,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And this was a reality that really struck me,

100
0:06:08.353,000 --> 0:06:12,000
because of course, Constance Okollet wasn't responsible

101
0:06:12.762,000 --> 0:06:15,000
for the greenhouse gas emissions that were causing this problem.

102
0:06:16.809,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Indeed, I was very struck about the situation in Malawi

103
0:06:20.975,000 --> 0:06:21,000
in January of this year.

104
0:06:22.881,000 --> 0:06:25,000
There was an unprecedented flooding in the country,

105
0:06:26.032,000 --> 0:06:28,000
it covered about a third of the country,

106
0:06:28.438,000 --> 0:06:3,000
over 300 people were killed,

107
0:06:30.628,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and hundreds of thousands lost their livelihoods.

108
0:06:34.388,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And the average person in Malawi

109
0:06:37.508,000 --> 0:06:41,000
emits about 80 kg of CO2 a year.

110
0:06:43.166,000 --> 0:06:48,000
The average US citizen emits about 17.5 metric tons.

111
0:06:49.126,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So those who are suffering disproportionately

112
0:06:52.841,000 --> 0:06:58,000
don't drive cars, don't have electricity, don't consume very significantly,

113
0:06:59.706,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and yet they are feeling more and more

114
0:07:02.888,000 --> 0:07:06,000
the impacts of the changes in the climate,

115
0:07:07.301,000 --> 0:07:11,000
the changes that are preventing them from knowing how to grow food properly,

116
0:07:11.594,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and knowing how to look after their future.

117
0:07:15.514,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I think it was really the importance of the injustice

118
0:07:23.031,000 --> 0:07:26,000
that really struck me very forcibly.

119
0:07:26.061,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And I know that we're not able to address some of that injustice

120
0:07:33.136,000 --> 0:07:36,000
because we're not on course for a safe world.

121
0:07:36.627,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Governments around the world agreed at the conference in Copenhagen,

122
0:07:43.04,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and have repeated it at every conference on climate,

123
0:07:46.778,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that we have to stay below two degrees Celsius

124
0:07:50.262,000 --> 0:07:53,000
of warming above pre-Industrial standards.

125
0:07:53.673,000 --> 0:07:55,000
But we're on course for about four degrees.

126
0:07:56.609,000 --> 0:08:,000
So we face an existential threat to the future of our planet.

127
0:08:01.506,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And that made me realize

128
0:08:03.15,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that climate change is the greatest threat to human rights in the 21st century.

129
0:08:09.566,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And that brought me then to climate justice.

130
0:08:13.225,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Climate justice responds to the moral argument --

131
0:08:17.408,000 --> 0:08:19,000
both sides of the moral argument --

132
0:08:19.464,000 --> 0:08:21,000
to address climate change.

133
0:08:21.906,000 --> 0:08:22,000
First of all,

134
0:08:23.081,000 --> 0:08:26,000
to be on the side of those who are suffering most and are most effected.

135
0:08:27.294,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And secondly,

136
0:08:28.675,000 --> 0:08:33,000
to make sure that they're not left behind again, when we start to move

137
0:08:33.7,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and start to address climate change with climate action,

138
0:08:36.533,000 --> 0:08:37,000
as we are doing.

139
0:08:39.834,000 --> 0:08:41,000
In our very unequal world today,

140
0:08:42.652,000 --> 0:08:45,000
it's very striking how many people are left behind.

141
0:08:46.929,000 --> 0:08:52,000
In our world of 7.2 billion people, about 3 billion are left behind.

142
0:08:53.262,000 --> 0:08:57,000
1.3 billion don't have access to electricity,

143
0:08:57.699,000 --> 0:09:,000
and they light their homes with kerosene and candles,

144
0:09:01.227,000 --> 0:09:02,000
both of which are dangerous.

145
0:09:02.926,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And in fact they spend a lot of their tiny income on that form of lighting.

146
0:09:09.441,000 --> 0:09:12,000
2.6 billion people cook on open fires --

147
0:09:13.794,000 --> 0:09:16,000
on coal, wood and animal dung.

148
0:09:17.327,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And this causes about 4 million deaths a year

149
0:09:22.025,000 --> 0:09:24,000
from indoor smoke inhalation,

150
0:09:24.271,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and of course, most of those who die are women.

151
0:09:28.792,000 --> 0:09:31,000
So we have a very unequal world,

152
0:09:33.046,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and we need to change from "business as usual."

153
0:09:39.125,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And we shouldn't underestimate the scale and the transformative nature

154
0:09:45.213,000 --> 0:09:47,000
of the change which will be needed,

155
0:09:47.974,000 --> 0:09:53,000
because we have to go to zero carbon emissions by about 2050,

156
0:09:54.587,000 --> 0:09:58,000
if we're going to stay below two degrees Celsius of warming.

157
0:09:58.976,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And that means we have to leave about two-thirds of the known resources

158
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:06,000
of fossil fuels in the ground.

159
0:10:06.564,000 --> 0:10:07,000
It's a very big change,

160
0:10:08.311,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and it means that obviously,

161
0:10:10.867,000 --> 0:10:12,000
industrialized countries must cut their emissions,

162
0:10:13.533,000 --> 0:10:15,000
must become much more energy-efficient,

163
0:10:15.628,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and must move as quickly as possible to renewable energy.

164
0:10:20.199,000 --> 0:10:24,000
For developing countries and emerging economies,

165
0:10:24.603,000 --> 0:10:28,000
the problem and the challenge is to grow without emissions,

166
0:10:29.184,000 --> 0:10:32,000
because they must develop; they have very poor populations.

167
0:10:32.522,000 --> 0:10:37,000
So they must develop without emissions, and that is a different kind of problem.

168
0:10:38.59,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Indeed, no country in the world has actually grown without emissions.

169
0:10:44.132,000 --> 0:10:46,000
All the countries have developed with fossil fuels,

170
0:10:46.56,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and then may be moving to renewable energy.

171
0:10:48.882,000 --> 0:10:5,000
So it is a very big challenge,

172
0:10:51.245,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and it requires the total support of the international community,

173
0:10:55.979,000 --> 0:10:59,000
with the necessary finance and technology, and systems and support,

174
0:11:00.939,000 --> 0:11:06,000
because no country can make itself safe from the dangers of climate change.

175
0:11:08.007,000 --> 0:11:12,000
This is an issue that requires complete human solidarity.

176
0:11:13.306,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Human solidarity, if you like, based on self-interest --

177
0:11:16.667,000 --> 0:11:18,000
because we are all in this together,

178
0:11:18.971,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and we have to work together

179
0:11:20.39,000 --> 0:11:25,000
to ensure that we reach zero carbon by 2050.

180
0:11:26.675,000 --> 0:11:28,000
The good news is that change is happening,

181
0:11:29.462,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and it's happening very fast.

182
0:11:32.131,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Here in California,

183
0:11:33.429,000 --> 0:11:37,000
there's a very ambitious emissions target to cut emissions.

184
0:11:37.966,000 --> 0:11:39,000
In Hawaii, they're passing legislation

185
0:11:40.795,000 --> 0:11:44,000
to have 100 percent renewable energy by 2045.

186
0:11:45.731,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And governments are very ambitious around the world.

187
0:11:49.731,000 --> 0:11:53,000
In Costa Rica, they have committed to being carbon-neutral by 2021.

188
0:11:55.11,000 --> 0:12:01,000
In Ethiopia, the commitment is to be carbon-neutral by 2027.

189
0:12:01.921,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Apple have pledged that their factories in China will use renewable energy.

190
0:12:08.44,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And there is a race on at the moment

191
0:12:11.317,000 --> 0:12:14,000
to convert electricity from tidal and wave power,

192
0:12:15.278,000 --> 0:12:19,000
in order that we can leave the coal in the ground.

193
0:12:19.521,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And that change is both welcome and is happening very rapidly.

194
0:12:24.368,000 --> 0:12:25,000
But it's still not enough,

195
0:12:25.777,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and the political will is still not enough.

196
0:12:28.475,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Let me come back to President Tong and his people in Kiribati.

197
0:12:34.077,000 --> 0:12:4,000
They actually could be able to live on their island and have a solution,

198
0:12:40.892,000 --> 0:12:42,000
but it would take a lot of political will.

199
0:12:43.6,000 --> 0:12:47,000
President Tong told me about his ambitious idea

200
0:12:47.772,000 --> 0:12:53,000
to either build up or even float the little islands where his people live.

201
0:12:55.018,000 --> 0:12:59,000
This, of course, is beyond the resources of Kiribati itself.

202
0:12:59.425,000 --> 0:13:02,000
It would require great solidarity and support from other countries,

203
0:13:03.18,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and it would require the kind of imaginative idea

204
0:13:07.426,000 --> 0:13:11,000
that we bring together when we want to have a space station in the air.

205
0:13:12.436,000 --> 0:13:16,000
But wouldn't it be wonderful to have this engineering wonder

206
0:13:17.315,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and to allow a people to remain in their sovereign territory,

207
0:13:20.872,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and be part of the community of nations?

208
0:13:24.015,000 --> 0:13:28,000
That is the kind of idea that we should be thinking about.

209
0:13:29.681,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Yes, the challenges of the transformation we need are big,

210
0:13:34.479,000 --> 0:13:36,000
but they can be solved.

211
0:13:37.051,000 --> 0:13:39,000
We are actually, as a people,

212
0:13:39.106,000 --> 0:13:42,000
very capable of coming together to solve problems.

213
0:13:42.806,000 --> 0:13:45,000
I was very conscious of this as I took part this year

214
0:13:46.464,000 --> 0:13:49,000
in commemoration of the 70th anniversary

215
0:13:50.245,000 --> 0:13:54,000
of the end of the Second World War in 1945.

216
0:13:55.744,000 --> 0:13:57,000
1945 was an extraordinary year.

217
0:13:59.367,000 --> 0:14:01,000
It was a year when the world faced

218
0:14:01.997,000 --> 0:14:04,000
what must have seemed almost insoluble problems --

219
0:14:05.548,000 --> 0:14:09,000
the devastation of the world wars, particularly the Second World War;

220
0:14:10.121,000 --> 0:14:13,000
the fragile peace that had been brought about;

221
0:14:13.352,000 --> 0:14:15,000
the need for a whole economic regeneration.

222
0:14:16.643,000 --> 0:14:2,000
But the leaders of that time didn't flinch from this.

223
0:14:20.892,000 --> 0:14:24,000
They had the capacity, they had a sense of being driven by

224
0:14:25.246,000 --> 0:14:29,000
never again must the world have this kind of problem.

225
0:14:29.321,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And they had to build structures for peace and security.

226
0:14:33.061,000 --> 0:14:36,000
And what did we get? What did they achieve?

227
0:14:36.546,000 --> 0:14:38,000
The Charter of the United Nations,

228
0:14:39.189,000 --> 0:14:42,000
the Bretton Woods institutions, as they're called, The World Bank,

229
0:14:42.764,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and the International Monetary Fund.

230
0:14:45.225,000 --> 0:14:48,000
A Marshall Plan for Europe, a devastated Europe,

231
0:14:48.623,000 --> 0:14:49,000
to reconstruct it.

232
0:14:50.569,000 --> 0:14:52,000
And indeed a few years later,

233
0:14:52.654,000 --> 0:14:55,000
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

234
0:14:56.364,000 --> 0:15:01,000
2015 is a year that is similar in its importance

235
0:15:02.002,000 --> 0:15:06,000
to 1945, with similar challenges and similar potential.

236
0:15:07.377,000 --> 0:15:1,000
There will be two big summits this year:

237
0:15:10.424,000 --> 0:15:12,000
the first one, in September in New York,

238
0:15:13.227,000 --> 0:15:16,000
is the summit for the sustainable development goals.

239
0:15:17.071,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And then the summit in Paris in December, to give us a climate agreement.

240
0:15:23.365,000 --> 0:15:29,000
The sustainable development goals are intended to help countries

241
0:15:29.716,000 --> 0:15:33,000
to live sustainably, in tune with Mother Earth,

242
0:15:33.85,000 --> 0:15:38,000
not to take out of Mother Earth and destroy ecosystems,

243
0:15:39.2,000 --> 0:15:42,000
but rather, to live in harmony with Mother Earth,

244
0:15:42.838,000 --> 0:15:45,000
by living under sustainable development.

245
0:15:46.691,000 --> 0:15:48,000
And the sustainable development goals

246
0:15:49.088,000 --> 0:15:51,000
will come into operation for all countries

247
0:15:51.497,000 --> 0:15:53,000
on January 1, 2016.

248
0:15:54.814,000 --> 0:15:55,000
The climate agreement --

249
0:15:56.015,000 --> 0:15:57,000
a binding climate agreement --

250
0:15:57.555,000 --> 0:16:,000
is needed because of the scientific evidence

251
0:16:01.243,000 --> 0:16:03,000
that we're on a trajectory for about a four-degree world

252
0:16:04.184,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and we have to change course to stay below two degrees.

253
0:16:08.033,000 --> 0:16:13,000
So we need to take steps that will be monitored and reviewed,

254
0:16:13.581,000 --> 0:16:17,000
so that we can keep increasing the ambition of how we cut emissions,

255
0:16:18.003,000 --> 0:16:21,000
and how we move more rapidly to renewable energy,

256
0:16:21.143,000 --> 0:16:24,000
so that we have a safe world.

257
0:16:27.665,000 --> 0:16:33,000
The reality is that this issue is much too important

258
0:16:33.872,000 --> 0:16:36,000
to be left to politicians and to the United Nations.

259
0:16:37.459,000 --> 0:16:38,000
(Laughter)

260
0:16:38.484,000 --> 0:16:39,000
It's an issue for all of us,

261
0:16:40.086,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and it's an issue where we need more and more momentum.

262
0:16:44.911,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Indeed, the face of the environmentalist has changed,

263
0:16:48.42,000 --> 0:16:5,000
because of the justice dimension.

264
0:16:50.753,000 --> 0:16:53,000
It's now an issue for faith-based organizations,

265
0:16:53.997,000 --> 0:16:56,000
under very good leadership from Pope Francis,

266
0:16:57.193,000 --> 0:16:58,000
and indeed, the Church of England,

267
0:16:58.989,000 --> 0:17:,000
which is divesting from fossil fuels.

268
0:17:01.456,000 --> 0:17:04,000
It's an issue for the business community,

269
0:17:05.238,000 --> 0:17:06,000
and the good news is

270
0:17:06.666,000 --> 0:17:08,000
that the business community is changing very rapidly --

271
0:17:09.6,000 --> 0:17:11,000
except for the fossil fuel industries --

272
0:17:11.809,000 --> 0:17:12,000
(Laughter)

273
0:17:13.428,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Even they are beginning to slightly change their language --

274
0:17:16.748,000 --> 0:17:16,000
but only slightly.

275
0:17:17.753,000 --> 0:17:21,000
But business is not only moving rapidly to the benefits of renewable energy,

276
0:17:22.468,000 --> 0:17:24,000
but is urging politicians to give them more signals,

277
0:17:25.215,000 --> 0:17:26,000
so that they can move even more rapidly.

278
0:17:27.214,000 --> 0:17:29,000
It's an issue for the trade union movement.

279
0:17:29.239,000 --> 0:17:31,000
It's an issue for the women's movement.

280
0:17:31.286,000 --> 0:17:33,000
It's an issue for young people.

281
0:17:33.388,000 --> 0:17:38,000
I was very struck when I learned that Jibreel Khazan,

282
0:17:39.214,000 --> 0:17:44,000
one of the Greensboro Four who had taken part in the Woolworth sit-ins,

283
0:17:44.882,000 --> 0:17:45,000
said quite recently that

284
0:17:46.42,000 --> 0:17:52,000
climate change is the lunch counter moment for young people.

285
0:17:52.446,000 --> 0:17:56,000
So, lunch counter moment for young people of the 21st century --

286
0:17:56.758,000 --> 0:18:,000
the sort of real human rights issue of the 21st century,

287
0:18:01.123,000 --> 0:18:03,000
because he said it is the greatest challenge

288
0:18:03.917,000 --> 0:18:06,000
to humanity and justice in our world.

289
0:18:08.391,000 --> 0:18:12,000
I recall very much the Climate March last September,

290
0:18:12.521,000 --> 0:18:13,000
and that was a huge momentum,

291
0:18:14.346,000 --> 0:18:16,000
not just in New York, but all around the world.

292
0:18:17.332,000 --> 0:18:19,000
and we have to build on that.

293
0:18:19.626,000 --> 0:18:22,000
I was marching with some of The Elders family,

294
0:18:22.761,000 --> 0:18:27,000
and I saw a placard a little bit away from me,

295
0:18:27.812,000 --> 0:18:28,000
but we were wedged so closely together --

296
0:18:29.79,000 --> 0:18:32,000
because after all, there were 400,000 people out in the streets of New York --

297
0:18:33.489,000 --> 0:18:34,000
so I couldn't quite get to that placard,

298
0:18:35.426,000 --> 0:18:38,000
I would have just liked to have been able to step behind it,

299
0:18:38.531,000 --> 0:18:4,000
because it said, "Angry Grannies!"

300
0:18:41.001,000 --> 0:18:42,000
(Laughter)

301
0:18:42.348,000 --> 0:18:43,000
That's what I felt.

302
0:18:43.826,000 --> 0:18:46,000
And I have five grandchildren now,

303
0:18:47.823,000 --> 0:18:51,000
I feel very happy as an Irish grandmother to have five grandchildren,

304
0:18:52.135,000 --> 0:18:55,000
and I think about their world,

305
0:18:55.202,000 --> 0:18:58,000
and what it will be like when they will share that world

306
0:18:58.387,000 --> 0:19:02,000
with about 9 billion other people in 2050.

307
0:19:03.574,000 --> 0:19:07,000
We know that inevitably it will be a climate-constrained world,

308
0:19:08.253,000 --> 0:19:1,000
because of the emissions we've already put up there,

309
0:19:11.126,000 --> 0:19:16,000
but it could be a world that is much more equal and much fairer,

310
0:19:16.547,000 --> 0:19:18,000
and much better for health, and better for jobs

311
0:19:19.153,000 --> 0:19:2,000
and better for energy security,

312
0:19:21.149,000 --> 0:19:22,000
than the world we have now,

313
0:19:23,000 --> 0:19:3,000
if we have switched sufficiently and early enough to renewable energy,

314
0:19:30.222,000 --> 0:19:32,000
and no one is left behind.

315
0:19:32.678,000 --> 0:19:34,000
No one is left behind.

316
0:19:35.736,000 --> 0:19:38,000
And just as we've been looking back this year --

317
0:19:39.34,000 --> 0:19:44,000
in 2015 to 1945, looking back 70 years --

318
0:19:44.871,000 --> 0:19:46,000
I would like to think that they will look back,

319
0:19:47.459,000 --> 0:19:51,000
that world will look back 35 years from 2050,

320
0:19:52.332,000 --> 0:19:54,000
35 years to 2015,

321
0:19:55.23,000 --> 0:19:57,000
and that they will say,

322
0:19:58.072,000 --> 0:20:02,000
"Weren't they good to do what they did in 2015?

323
0:20:02.203,000 --> 0:20:07,000
We really appreciate that they took the decisions that made a difference,

324
0:20:07.702,000 --> 0:20:09,000
and that put the world on the right pathway,

325
0:20:10.664,000 --> 0:20:12,000
and we benefit now from that pathway,"

326
0:20:13.394,000 --> 0:20:16,000
that they will feel that somehow we took our responsibilities,

327
0:20:17.299,000 --> 0:20:21,000
we did what was done in 1945 in similar terms,

328
0:20:21.482,000 --> 0:20:23,000
we didn't miss the opportunity,

329
0:20:23.927,000 --> 0:20:25,000
we lived up to our responsibilities.

330
0:20:26.133,000 --> 0:20:29,000
That's what this year is about.

331
0:20:29.688,000 --> 0:20:3,000
And somehow for me,

332
0:20:31.062,000 --> 0:20:35,000
it's captured in words of somebody that I admired very much.

333
0:20:35.38,000 --> 0:20:37,000
She was a mentor of mine, she was a friend,

334
0:20:37.737,000 --> 0:20:38,000
she died much too young,

335
0:20:39.709,000 --> 0:20:41,000
she was an extraordinary personality,

336
0:20:41.738,000 --> 0:20:43,000
a great champion of the environment:

337
0:20:44.246,000 --> 0:20:45,000
Wangari Maathai.

338
0:20:46.627,000 --> 0:20:48,000
Wangari said once,

339
0:20:49.277,000 --> 0:20:5,000
"In the course of history,

340
0:20:51.255,000 --> 0:20:55,000
there comes a time when humanity is called upon

341
0:20:55.29,000 --> 0:20:59,000
to shift to a new level of consciousness,

342
0:21:00.065,000 --> 0:21:03,000
to reach a higher moral ground."

343
0:21:04.135,000 --> 0:21:05,000
And that's what we have to do.

344
0:21:06.078,000 --> 0:21:09,000
We have to reach a new level of consciousness,

345
0:21:09.39,000 --> 0:21:1,000
a higher moral ground.

346
0:21:11.791,000 --> 0:21:14,000
And we have to do it this year in those two big summits.

347
0:21:16.108,000 --> 0:21:19,000
And that won't happen unless we have the momentum

348
0:21:19.73,000 --> 0:21:22,000
from people around the world who say:

349
0:21:22.901,000 --> 0:21:23,000
"We want action now,

350
0:21:24.445,000 --> 0:21:25,000
we want to change course,

351
0:21:26.04,000 --> 0:21:27,000
we want a safe world,

352
0:21:27.437,000 --> 0:21:29,000
a safe world for future generations,

353
0:21:29.636,000 --> 0:21:31,000
a safe world for our children and our grandchildren,

354
0:21:32.268,000 --> 0:21:34,000
and we're all in this together."

355
0:21:34.563,000 --> 0:21:35,000
Thank you.

356
0:21:35.747,000 --> 0:21:4,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.115,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So a chip, a poet and a boy.

2
0:00:18.52,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It's just about 20 years ago,

3
0:00:20.485,000 --> 0:00:23,000
June 1994, when Intel announced

4
0:00:23.989,000 --> 0:00:25,000
that there was a flaw

5
0:00:26.002,000 --> 0:00:28,000
at the core of their Pentium chip.

6
0:00:28.819,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Deep in the code of the SRT algorithm

7
0:00:31.2,000 --> 0:00:33,000
to calculate intermediate quotients necessary

8
0:00:33.451,000 --> 0:00:34,000
for iterative floating points of divisions --

9
0:00:35.285,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I don't know what that means, but it's what it says on Wikipedia —

10
0:00:38.384,000 --> 0:00:4,000
there was a flaw and an error

11
0:00:41.263,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that meant that there was a certain probability

12
0:00:43.479,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that the result of the calculation would be an error,

13
0:00:46.487,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and the probability was one out of every

14
0:00:49.08,000 --> 0:00:52,000
360 billion calculations.

15
0:00:52.617,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So Intel said your average spreadsheet

16
0:00:54.611,000 --> 0:00:58,000
would be flawed once every 27,000 years.

17
0:00:59.117,000 --> 0:01:,000
They didn't think it was significant,

18
0:01:00.411,000 --> 0:01:03,000
but there was an outrage in the community.

19
0:01:03.637,000 --> 0:01:05,000
The community, the techies, said, this flaw

20
0:01:05.987,000 --> 0:01:06,000
has to be addressed.

21
0:01:07.068,000 --> 0:01:09,000
They were not going to stand by quietly

22
0:01:09.069,000 --> 0:01:1,000
as Intel gave them these chips.

23
0:01:11.017,000 --> 0:01:13,000
So there was a revolution across the world.

24
0:01:13.063,000 --> 0:01:16,000
People marched to demand --

25
0:01:16.093,000 --> 0:01:18,000
okay, not really exactly like that —

26
0:01:18.202,000 --> 0:01:2,000
but they rose up and they demanded

27
0:01:20.943,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that Intel fix the flaw.

28
0:01:23.935,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And Intel set aside 475 million dollars

29
0:01:29.787,000 --> 0:01:31,000
to fund the replacement of millions of chips

30
0:01:32.029,000 --> 0:01:33,000
to fix the flaw.

31
0:01:33.12,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So billions of dollars in our society

32
0:01:35.332,000 --> 0:01:37,000
was spent to address a problem

33
0:01:37.516,000 --> 0:01:41,000
which would come once out of every 360 billion

34
0:01:41.607,000 --> 0:01:43,000
calculations.

35
0:01:43.694,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Number two, a poet.

36
0:01:46.297,000 --> 0:01:48,000
This is Martin Niemöller.

37
0:01:48.577,000 --> 0:01:49,000
You're familiar with his poetry.

38
0:01:50.11,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Around the height of the Nazi period,

39
0:01:51.886,000 --> 0:01:53,000
he started repeating the verse,

40
0:01:54.158,000 --> 0:01:55,000
"First they came for the communists,

41
0:01:55.893,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and I did nothing,

42
0:01:57.424,000 --> 0:01:59,000
did not speak out because I was not a communist.

43
0:01:59.674,000 --> 0:02:,000
Then they came for the socialists.

44
0:02:00.728,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Then they came for the trade unions.

45
0:02:02.69,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Then they came for the Jews.

46
0:02:03.936,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And then they came for me.

47
0:02:06.838,000 --> 0:02:1,000
But there was no one left to speak for me."

48
0:02:11.509,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Now, Niemöller is offering a certain kind of insight.

49
0:02:14.638,000 --> 0:02:17,000
This is an insight at the core of intelligence.

50
0:02:17.97,000 --> 0:02:19,000
We could call it cluefulness.

51
0:02:20.684,000 --> 0:02:22,000
It's a certain kind of test:

52
0:02:23.245,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Can you recognize

53
0:02:25.037,000 --> 0:02:27,000
an underlying threat and respond?

54
0:02:27.541,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Can you save yourself or save your kind?

55
0:02:31.031,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Turns out ants are pretty good at this.

56
0:02:32.77,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Cows, not so much.

57
0:02:34.853,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So can you see the pattern?

58
0:02:37.283,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Can you see a pattern and then recognize

59
0:02:39.63,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and do something about it? Number two.

60
0:02:43.682,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Number three, a boy.

61
0:02:45.609,000 --> 0:02:47,000
This is my friend Aaron Swartz.

62
0:02:47.91,000 --> 0:02:48,000
He's Tim's friend.

63
0:02:49.341,000 --> 0:02:51,000
He's friends of many of you in this audience,

64
0:02:51.373,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and seven years ago,

65
0:02:52.798,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Aaron came to me with a question.

66
0:02:55.784,000 --> 0:02:57,000
It was just before I was going to give my first TED Talk.

67
0:02:58.367,000 --> 0:03:,000
I was so proud. I was telling him about my talk,

68
0:03:00.79,000 --> 0:03:02,000
"Laws that choke creativity."

69
0:03:03.297,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And Aaron looked at me

70
0:03:04.906,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and was a little impatient, and he said,

71
0:03:06.857,000 --> 0:03:1,000
"So how are you ever

72
0:03:10.95,000 --> 0:03:12,000
going to solve the problems you're talking about?

73
0:03:12.99,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Copyright policy, Internet policy,

74
0:03:14.792,000 --> 0:03:17,000
how are you ever going to address those problems

75
0:03:17.982,000 --> 0:03:2,000
so long as there's this fundamental corruption

76
0:03:21.215,000 --> 0:03:23,000
in the way our government works?"

77
0:03:24.06,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So I was a little put off by this.

78
0:03:26.665,000 --> 0:03:27,000
He wasn't sharing in my celebration.

79
0:03:28.65,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And I said to him, "You know, Aaron,

80
0:03:29.817,000 --> 0:03:32,000
it's not my field, not my field."

81
0:03:32.911,000 --> 0:03:34,000
He said, "You mean as an academic, it's not your field?"

82
0:03:35.467,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I said, "Yeah, as an academic, it's not my field."

83
0:03:38.061,000 --> 0:03:41,000
He said, "What about as a citizen?

84
0:03:41.392,000 --> 0:03:44,000
As a citizen."

85
0:03:44.819,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Now, this is the way Aaron was.

86
0:03:46.415,000 --> 0:03:51,000
He didn't tell. He asked questions.

87
0:03:51.476,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But his questions spoke as clearly

88
0:03:53.226,000 --> 0:03:55,000
as my four-year-old's hug.

89
0:03:55.914,000 --> 0:03:56,000
He was saying to me,

90
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
"You've got to get a clue.

91
0:03:59.262,000 --> 0:04:,000
You have got to get a clue, because there is

92
0:04:00.938,000 --> 0:04:03,000
a flaw at the core of the operating system

93
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:05,000
of this democracy,

94
0:04:05.507,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and it's not a flaw every one out of 360 billion times

95
0:04:09.805,000 --> 0:04:1,000
our democracy tries to make a decision.

96
0:04:11.597,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It is every time,

97
0:04:13.418,000 --> 0:04:15,000
every single important issue.

98
0:04:15.814,000 --> 0:04:19,000
We've got to end the bovinity of this political society.

99
0:04:20.347,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We've got to adopt, it turns out,

100
0:04:21.99,000 --> 0:04:23,000
the word is fourmi-formatic attitude --

101
0:04:24.762,000 --> 0:04:25,000
that's what the Internet tells me the word is --

102
0:04:26.532,000 --> 0:04:28,000
the ant's appreciative attitude

103
0:04:28.604,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that gets us to recognize this flaw,

104
0:04:31.242,000 --> 0:04:36,000
save our kind and save our demos.

105
0:04:37.055,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Now if you know Aaron Swartz,

106
0:04:38.533,000 --> 0:04:41,000
you know that we lost him

107
0:04:42.171,000 --> 0:04:44,000
just over a year ago.

108
0:04:44.503,000 --> 0:04:45,000
It was about six weeks

109
0:04:46.039,000 --> 0:04:47,000
before I gave my TED Talk,

110
0:04:47.919,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and I was so grateful to Chris

111
0:04:49.814,000 --> 0:04:5,000
that he asked me to give this TED Talk,

112
0:04:51.245,000 --> 0:04:53,000
not because I had the chance to talk to you,

113
0:04:53.445,000 --> 0:04:55,000
although that was great,

114
0:04:55.729,000 --> 0:04:58,000
but because it pulled me out of an extraordinary depression.

115
0:04:59.162,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I couldn't begin to describe the sadness.

116
0:05:03.671,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Because I had to focus.

117
0:05:04.951,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I had to focus on, what was I going to say to you?

118
0:05:09.266,000 --> 0:05:11,000
It saved me.

119
0:05:11.468,000 --> 0:05:12,000
But after the buzz, the excitement,

120
0:05:13.417,000 --> 0:05:17,000
the power that comes from this community,

121
0:05:17.892,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I began to yearn for a less sterile,

122
0:05:20.443,000 --> 0:05:22,000
less academic way to address these issues,

123
0:05:22.96,000 --> 0:05:25,000
the issues that I was talking about.

124
0:05:26.749,000 --> 0:05:27,000
We'd begun to focus on New Hampshire

125
0:05:28.605,000 --> 0:05:3,000
as a target for this political movement,

126
0:05:31.273,000 --> 0:05:33,000
because the primary in New Hampshire

127
0:05:33.81,000 --> 0:05:34,000
is so incredibly important.

128
0:05:35.6,000 --> 0:05:37,000
It was a group called the New Hampshire Rebellion

129
0:05:38.201,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that was beginning to talk about, how would we make

130
0:05:40.519,000 --> 0:05:43,000
this issue of this corruption central in 2016?

131
0:05:43.769,000 --> 0:05:46,000
But it was another soul that caught my imagination,

132
0:05:47.21,000 --> 0:05:52,000
a woman named Doris Haddock, aka Granny D.

133
0:05:52.547,000 --> 0:05:55,000
On January 1, 1999, 15 years ago,

134
0:05:55.909,000 --> 0:05:59,000
at the age of 88, Granny D started a walk.

135
0:06:00.738,000 --> 0:06:03,000
She started in Los Angeles

136
0:06:04.008,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and began to walk to Washington, D.C.

137
0:06:06.97,000 --> 0:06:08,000
with a single sign on her chest that said,

138
0:06:09.698,000 --> 0:06:11,000
"campaign finance reform."

139
0:06:12.282,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Eighteen months later,

140
0:06:15.01,000 --> 0:06:16,000
at the age of 90,

141
0:06:16.82,000 --> 0:06:18,000
she arrived in Washington with hundreds following her,

142
0:06:19.346,000 --> 0:06:21,000
including many congressmen who had gotten in a car

143
0:06:21.664,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and driven out about a mile outside of the city

144
0:06:24.572,000 --> 0:06:25,000
to walk in with her.

145
0:06:26.46,000 --> 0:06:28,000
(Laughter)

146
0:06:28.602,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Now, I don't have 13 months

147
0:06:31.892,000 --> 0:06:32,000
to walk across the country.

148
0:06:33.534,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I've got three kids who hate to walk,

149
0:06:36.176,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and a wife who, it turns out,

150
0:06:37.578,000 --> 0:06:38,000
still hates when I'm not there

151
0:06:39.476,000 --> 0:06:4,000
for mysterious reasons,

152
0:06:40.645,000 --> 0:06:41,000
so this was not an option,

153
0:06:41.95,000 --> 0:06:42,000
but the question I asked,

154
0:06:43.11,000 --> 0:06:45,000
could we remix Granny D a bit?

155
0:06:45.658,000 --> 0:06:47,000
What about a walk not of 3,200 miles

156
0:06:47.79,000 --> 0:06:5,000
but of 185 miles across New Hampshire

157
0:06:51.71,000 --> 0:06:54,000
in January?

158
0:06:55.314,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So on January 11,

159
0:06:57.54,000 --> 0:06:59,000
the anniversary of Aaron's death,

160
0:07:00.426,000 --> 0:07:03,000
we began a walk that ended on January 24th,

161
0:07:04.169,000 --> 0:07:08,000
the day that Granny D was born.

162
0:07:08.515,000 --> 0:07:12,000
A total of 200 people joined us across this walk,

163
0:07:13.095,000 --> 0:07:16,000
as we went from the very top to the very bottom of New Hampshire

164
0:07:16.869,000 --> 0:07:18,000
talking about this issue.

165
0:07:19.265,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And what was astonishing to me,

166
0:07:20.865,000 --> 0:07:22,000
something I completely did not expect to find,

167
0:07:23.426,000 --> 0:07:25,000
was the passion and anger

168
0:07:26.021,000 --> 0:07:31,000
that there was among everyone that we talked to about this issue.

169
0:07:31.496,000 --> 0:07:36,000
We had found in a poll that 96 percent of Americans

170
0:07:36.602,000 --> 0:07:37,000
believe it important to reduce the influence

171
0:07:38.441,000 --> 0:07:4,000
of money in politics.

172
0:07:40.687,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Now politicians and pundits tell you,

173
0:07:42.703,000 --> 0:07:43,000
there's nothing we can do about this issue,

174
0:07:44.523,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Americans don't care about it,

175
0:07:45.859,000 --> 0:07:47,000
but the reason for that is

176
0:07:48.155,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that 91 percent of Americans

177
0:07:50.009,000 --> 0:07:54,000
think there's nothing that can be done about this issue.

178
0:07:54.531,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And it's this gap between 96 and 91

179
0:07:57.353,000 --> 0:07:59,000
that explains our politics of resignation.

180
0:07:59.83,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I mean, after all, at least 96 percent of us

181
0:08:01.913,000 --> 0:08:02,000
wish we could fly like Superman,

182
0:08:03.775,000 --> 0:08:06,000
but because at least 91 percent of us believe we can't,

183
0:08:06.939,000 --> 0:08:08,000
we don't leap off of tall buildings every time

184
0:08:09.605,000 --> 0:08:1,000
we have that urge.

185
0:08:10.915,000 --> 0:08:12,000
That's because we accept our limits,

186
0:08:12.921,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and so too with this reform.

187
0:08:15.68,000 --> 0:08:19,000
But when you give people the sense of hope,

188
0:08:19.973,000 --> 0:08:25,000
you begin to thaw that absolute sense of impossibility.

189
0:08:26.69,000 --> 0:08:29,000
As Harvey Milk said, if you give 'em hope,

190
0:08:30.305,000 --> 0:08:32,000
you give 'em a chance, a way to think

191
0:08:33.02,000 --> 0:08:35,000
about how this change is possible.

192
0:08:35.109,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Hope.

193
0:08:37.96,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And hope is the one thing that we, Aaron's friends,

194
0:08:41.53,000 --> 0:08:43,000
failed him with, because we let him

195
0:08:44.527,000 --> 0:08:49,000
lose that sense of hope.

196
0:08:50.127,000 --> 0:08:53,000
I loved that boy like I love my son.

197
0:08:58.233,000 --> 0:09:01,000
But we failed him.

198
0:09:02.202,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And I love my country,

199
0:09:05.79,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and I'm not going to fail that.

200
0:09:08.144,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I'm not going to fail that.

201
0:09:09.316,000 --> 0:09:12,000
That sense of hope, we're going to hold,

202
0:09:13.009,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and we're going to fight for,

203
0:09:14.475,000 --> 0:09:18,000
however impossible this battle looks.

204
0:09:19.175,000 --> 0:09:2,000
What's next?

205
0:09:20.469,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Well, we started with this march with 200 people,

206
0:09:23.63,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and next year, there will be 1,000

207
0:09:27.032,000 --> 0:09:28,000
on different routes

208
0:09:28.671,000 --> 0:09:3,000
that march in the month of January

209
0:09:31.181,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and meet in Concord to celebrate this cause,

210
0:09:35.009,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and then in 2016, before the primary,

211
0:09:37.569,000 --> 0:09:39,000
there will be 10,000 who march across that state,

212
0:09:40.53,000 --> 0:09:43,000
meeting in Concord to celebrate this cause.

213
0:09:43.594,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And as we have marched, people around the country

214
0:09:46.365,000 --> 0:09:47,000
have begun to say, "Can we do the same thing

215
0:09:48.223,000 --> 0:09:49,000
in our state?"

216
0:09:49.34,000 --> 0:09:51,000
So we've started a platform called G.D. Walkers,

217
0:09:51.719,000 --> 0:09:52,000
that is, Granny D walkers,

218
0:09:53.71,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and Granny D walkers across the country

219
0:09:55.837,000 --> 0:09:58,000
will be marching for this reform. Number one.

220
0:09:58.939,000 --> 0:10:,000
Number two, on this march,

221
0:10:01.219,000 --> 0:10:03,000
one of the founders of Thunderclap, David Cascino,

222
0:10:04.011,000 --> 0:10:05,000
was with us,

223
0:10:05.63,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and he said, "Well what can we do?"

224
0:10:07.488,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And so they developed a platform,

225
0:10:09.817,000 --> 0:10:1,000
which we are announcing today,

226
0:10:11.739,000 --> 0:10:13,000
that allows us to pull together voters

227
0:10:14.205,000 --> 0:10:16,000
who are committed to this idea of reform.

228
0:10:16.883,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Regardless of where you are,

229
0:10:18.029,000 --> 0:10:2,000
in New Hampshire or outside of New Hampshire,

230
0:10:20.681,000 --> 0:10:21,000
you can sign up and directly be informed

231
0:10:22.591,000 --> 0:10:24,000
where the candidates are on this issue

232
0:10:25.579,000 --> 0:10:26,000
so you can decide who to vote for

233
0:10:27.219,000 --> 0:10:29,000
as a function of which is going

234
0:10:30.137,000 --> 0:10:34,000
to make this possibility real.

235
0:10:34.605,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And then finally number three, the hardest.

236
0:10:38.677,000 --> 0:10:39,000
We're in the age of the Super PAC.

237
0:10:40.5,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Indeed yesterday, Merriam announced

238
0:10:42.609,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that Merriam-Webster will have Super PAC as a word.

239
0:10:46.859,000 --> 0:10:49,000
It is now an official word in the dictionary.

240
0:10:50.499,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So on May 1, aka May Day,

241
0:10:55.894,000 --> 0:10:57,000
we're going to try an experiment.

242
0:10:58.681,000 --> 0:10:59,000
We're going to try a launching

243
0:11:00.498,000 --> 0:11:02,000
of what we can think of as a Super PAC

244
0:11:02.796,000 --> 0:11:05,000
to end all Super PACs.

245
0:11:06.06,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And the basic way this works is this.

246
0:11:07.86,000 --> 0:11:08,000
For the last year, we have been working

247
0:11:09.632,000 --> 0:11:12,000
with analysts and political experts

248
0:11:13.352,000 --> 0:11:16,000
to calculate, how much would it cost

249
0:11:16.684,000 --> 0:11:18,000
to win enough votes in the United States Congress

250
0:11:19.106,000 --> 0:11:2,000
to make fundamental reform possible?

251
0:11:20.926,000 --> 0:11:22,000
What is that number? Half a billion? A billion?

252
0:11:23.728,000 --> 0:11:24,000
What is that number?

253
0:11:25.568,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And then whatever that number is,

254
0:11:28.333,000 --> 0:11:3,000
we are going to kickstart, sort of,

255
0:11:30.438,000 --> 0:11:31,000
because you can't use KickStarter for political work,

256
0:11:32.369,000 --> 0:11:34,000
but anyway, kickstart, sort of,

257
0:11:35.14,000 --> 0:11:37,000
first a bottom-up campaign

258
0:11:37.496,000 --> 0:11:39,000
where people will make small dollar commitments

259
0:11:40.476,000 --> 0:11:42,000
contingent on reaching very ambitious goals,

260
0:11:43.438,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and when those goals have been reached,

261
0:11:45.438,000 --> 0:11:49,000
we will turn to the large dollar contributors,

262
0:11:49.577,000 --> 0:11:52,000
to get them to contribute to make it possible

263
0:11:52.959,000 --> 0:11:55,000
for us to run the kind of Super PAC necessary

264
0:11:56.482,000 --> 0:11:57,000
to win this issue,

265
0:11:57.824,000 --> 0:11:59,000
to change the way money influences politics,

266
0:12:00.718,000 --> 0:12:03,000
so that on November 8,

267
0:12:04.489,000 --> 0:12:06,000
which I discovered yesterday is the day

268
0:12:06.817,000 --> 0:12:09,000
that Aaron would have been 30 years old,

269
0:12:10.508,000 --> 0:12:12,000
on November 8,

270
0:12:13.2,000 --> 0:12:16,000
we will celebrate 218 representatives

271
0:12:16.739,000 --> 0:12:18,000
in the House and 60 Senators

272
0:12:18.826,000 --> 0:12:2,000
in the United States Senate

273
0:12:20.847,000 --> 0:12:22,000
who have committed to this idea

274
0:12:23.14,000 --> 0:12:24,000
of fundamental reform.

275
0:12:25.006,000 --> 0:12:28,000
So last night, we heard about wishes.

276
0:12:28.768,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Here's my wish.

277
0:12:30.856,000 --> 0:12:33,000
May one.

278
0:12:34.1,000 --> 0:12:37,000
May the ideals of one boy

279
0:12:37.483,000 --> 0:12:41,000
unite one nation behind one critical idea

280
0:12:41.964,000 --> 0:12:43,000
that we are one people,

281
0:12:44.425,000 --> 0:12:47,000
we are the people who were promised a government,

282
0:12:47.902,000 --> 0:12:49,000
a government that was promised to be

283
0:12:50.031,000 --> 0:12:54,000
dependent upon the people alone, the people,

284
0:12:54.752,000 --> 0:12:56,000
who, as Madison told us,

285
0:12:57.601,000 --> 0:13:,000
meant not the rich more than the poor.

286
0:13:01.178,000 --> 0:13:03,000
May one.

287
0:13:03.324,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And then may you, may you join this movement,

288
0:13:07.503,000 --> 0:13:09,000
not because you're a politician,

289
0:13:09.511,000 --> 0:13:1,000
not because you're an expert,

290
0:13:11.127,000 --> 0:13:14,000
not because this is your field,

291
0:13:14.419,000 --> 0:13:15,000
but because if you are,

292
0:13:16.099,000 --> 0:13:19,000
you are a citizen.

293
0:13:19.77,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Aaron asked me that.

294
0:13:22.807,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Now I've asked you.

295
0:13:25.662,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Thank you very much.

296
0:13:27.34,000 --> 0:13:35,000
(Applause)

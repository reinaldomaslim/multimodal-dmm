0:00:13.058,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Today I'm going to show you an electric vehicle

3
0:00:16.636,000 --> 0:00:19,000
that weighs less than a bicycle,

4
0:00:20.542,000 --> 0:00:23,000
that you can carry with you anywhere,

5
0:00:23.888,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that you can charge off a normal wall outlet in 15 minutes,

6
0:00:28.38,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and you can run it for 1,000 kilometers

7
0:00:30.628,000 --> 0:00:32,000
on about a dollar of electricity.

8
0:00:32.98,000 --> 0:00:34,000
But when I say the word electric vehicle,

9
0:00:35.268,000 --> 0:00:37,000
people think about vehicles. They think about cars

10
0:00:38.156,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and motorcycles and bicycles, and the vehicles that you use every day.

11
0:00:41.874,000 --> 0:00:43,000
But if you come about it from a different perspective,

12
0:00:44.17,000 --> 0:00:46,000
you can create some more interesting,

13
0:00:46.472,000 --> 0:00:48,000
more novel concepts.

14
0:00:49.152,000 --> 0:00:51,000
So we built something.

15
0:00:51.408,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I've got some of the pieces in my pocket here.

16
0:00:54.102,000 --> 0:00:56,000
So this is the motor.

17
0:00:56.192,000 --> 0:00:57,000
This motor has enough power to take you

18
0:00:57.801,000 --> 0:01:,000
up the hills of San Francisco at about 20 miles per hour,

19
0:01:01.608,000 --> 0:01:02,000
about 30 kilometers an hour,

20
0:01:03.434,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and this battery, this battery right here

21
0:01:07.524,000 --> 0:01:1,000
has about six miles of range, or 10 kilometers,

22
0:01:11.472,000 --> 0:01:13,000
which is enough to cover about half of the car trips

23
0:01:14.275,000 --> 0:01:16,000
in the U.S. alone.

24
0:01:16.672,000 --> 0:01:17,000
But the best part about these components

25
0:01:18.451,000 --> 0:01:2,000
is that we bought them at a toy store.

26
0:01:20.648,000 --> 0:01:22,000
These are from remote control airplanes.

27
0:01:23.072,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And the performance of these things has gotten so good

28
0:01:25.216,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that if you think about vehicles a little bit differently,

29
0:01:27.512,000 --> 0:01:28,000
you can really change things.

30
0:01:29.015,000 --> 0:01:3,000
So today we're going to show you one example

31
0:01:31.012,000 --> 0:01:33,000
of how you can use this.

32
0:01:33.089,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Pay attention to not only how fun this thing is,

33
0:01:35.888,000 --> 0:01:38,000
but also how the portability that comes with this

34
0:01:38.966,000 --> 0:01:42,000
can totally change the way you interact with a city like San Francisco.

35

(Cheers)

41
0:03:00.829,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So we're going to show you what this thing can do.

42
0:03:04.122,000 --> 0:03:06,000
It's really maneuverable. You have a hand-held remote,

43
0:03:06.815,000 --> 0:03:09,000
so you can pretty easily control acceleration, braking,

44
0:03:10.394,000 --> 0:03:14,000
go in reverse if you like, also have braking.

45
0:03:21.431,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It's incredible just how light this thing is.

46
0:03:23.488,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I mean, this is something you can pick up and carry with you

47
0:03:25.617,000 --> 0:03:27,000
anywhere you go.

48
0:03:28.553,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So I'll leave you with one of the most compelling facts

49
0:03:31.729,000 --> 0:03:33,000
about this technology and these kinds of vehicles.

50
0:03:34.585,000 --> 0:03:37,000
This uses 20 times less energy

51
0:03:37.977,000 --> 0:03:4,000
for every mile or kilometer that you travel than a car,

52
0:03:41.344,000 --> 0:03:44,000
which means not only is this thing fast to charge

53
0:03:44.977,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and really cheap to build,

54
0:03:46.666,000 --> 0:03:49,000
but it also reduces the footprint of your energy use

55
0:03:50.017,000 --> 0:03:51,000
in terms of your transportation.

56
0:03:51.652,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So instead of looking at large amounts of energy needed

57
0:03:54.411,000 --> 0:03:56,000
for each person in this room to get around in a city,

58
0:03:57.345,000 --> 0:03:59,000
now you can look at much smaller amounts

59
0:03:59.465,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and more sustainable transportation.

60
0:04:01.905,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So next time you think about a vehicle,

61
0:04:03.267,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I hope, like us, you're thinking about something new.

62
0:04:06.573,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Thank you.

63
0:04:07.711,000 --> 0:04:12,000

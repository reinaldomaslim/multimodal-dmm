1
0:00:12.58,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I was born and raised in Dakar, Senegal,

2
0:00:15.74,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and through a combination of accidents and cosmic justice,

3
0:00:20.78,000 --> 0:00:21,000
became a chef in the US.

4
0:00:22.7,000 --> 0:00:23,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:24.5,000 --> 0:00:25,000
When I first arrived in New York,

6
0:00:26.94,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I began working in these restaurants -- different types of restaurants --

7
0:00:30.42,000 --> 0:00:32,000
from French bistro to Italian,

8
0:00:33.14,000 --> 0:00:34,000
global ethnic to modern American.

9
0:00:36.1,000 --> 0:00:37,000
At the time,

10
0:00:37.38,000 --> 0:00:4,000
New York was already well-established as a food capital of the world.

11
0:00:41.9,000 --> 0:00:42,000
However ...

12
0:00:44.62,000 --> 0:00:49,000
with the exception of a few West African and Ethiopian mom-and-pop eateries,

13
0:00:50.38,000 --> 0:00:53,000
there was no such thing as African cuisine in the entire city.

14
0:00:55.58,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Early in my life,

15
0:00:57.1,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I was influenced by Senegal's first president,

16
0:01:00.1,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Léopold Sédar Senghor,

17
0:01:02.82,000 --> 0:01:04,000
nicknamed, "the poet president,"

18
0:01:05.06,000 --> 0:01:07,000
who talked about a new humanism,

19
0:01:07.42,000 --> 0:01:08,000
a universal civilization,

20
0:01:08.82,000 --> 0:01:14,000
in which all cultures would come together around a communal table as equals,

21
0:01:14.86,000 --> 0:01:17,000
each bringing its own beautiful contribution to share.

22
0:01:19.5,000 --> 0:01:22,000
He called it "the rendezvous of giving and receiving."

23
0:01:24.02,000 --> 0:01:26,000
That concept resonated with me,

24
0:01:26.34,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and it has guided my career path.

25
0:01:29.3,000 --> 0:01:32,000
After years of working in restaurants,

26
0:01:32.42,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I yearned for my work to have a deeper impact

27
0:01:35.58,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that would go beyond the last meal I had served.

28
0:01:40.42,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I wanted to give back, both to New York --

29
0:01:43.38,000 --> 0:01:47,000
the city that allowed me the opportunity to follow my calling --

30
0:01:47.46,000 --> 0:01:5,000
but also to my origins and ancestors in Senegal.

31
0:01:52.46,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I wanted to contribute to that universal civilization

32
0:01:55.42,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Senghor had described.

33
0:01:57.7,000 --> 0:01:59,000
But I didn't know how to make a measurable impact

34
0:02:00.3,000 --> 0:02:01,000
as a cook and writer.

35
0:02:03.5,000 --> 0:02:06,000
While I was writing my first cookbook,

36
0:02:06.82,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I often traveled to different regions of Senegal for research.

37
0:02:12.38,000 --> 0:02:14,000
During one of those trips,

38
0:02:14.54,000 --> 0:02:16,000
in the remote, southeast region of Kédougou

39
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I rediscovered an ancient grain called fonio

40
0:02:22.5,000 --> 0:02:26,000
that had all but disappeared from the urban Senegalese diet.

41
0:02:28.5,000 --> 0:02:3,000
It turns out that fonio had been cultivated

42
0:02:31.38,000 --> 0:02:33,000
for more than five thousand years

43
0:02:33.98,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and is probably the oldest cultivated cereal in Africa.

44
0:02:38.58,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Once a popular grain on much of the continent,

45
0:02:42.82,000 --> 0:02:44,000
fonio was grown all the way to ancient Egypt,

46
0:02:46.5,000 --> 0:02:51,000
where archaeologists found grains inside pyramids' burial grounds.

47
0:02:52.7,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Today it is mostly cultivated in the western part of the Sahel region,

48
0:02:58.46,000 --> 0:03:,000
from Senegal to Mali,

49
0:03:00.78,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Burkina Faso,

50
0:03:02.1,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Togo, Nigeria.

51
0:03:04.9,000 --> 0:03:09,000
The Sahel region is that semiarid area south of the Sahara desert

52
0:03:10.78,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that extends from the Atlantic in the west to the Red Sea in the east.

53
0:03:17.38,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I became more interested in this grain

54
0:03:21.1,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that was deemed worth taking to the afterlife by early Egyptians.

55
0:03:26.94,000 --> 0:03:28,000
As I continued my research,

56
0:03:29.1,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I found out that fonio was actually --

57
0:03:33.98,000 --> 0:03:34,000
wherever it was cultivated --

58
0:03:35.98,000 --> 0:03:38,000
there was always some myth, or some superstition connected to it.

59
0:03:40.58,000 --> 0:03:41,000
The Dogon,

60
0:03:42.06,000 --> 0:03:43,000
another great culture in Mali,

61
0:03:43.94,000 --> 0:03:44,000
called it "po,"

62
0:03:45.62,000 --> 0:03:46,000
or, "the seed of the universe."

63
0:03:48.3,000 --> 0:03:5,000
In that ancient culture's mythology,

64
0:03:50.66,000 --> 0:03:53,000
the entire universe sprouted from a seed of fonio.

65
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Aside from its purported mystical properties,

66
0:03:59.3,000 --> 0:04:01,000
fonio is a miracle grain in many aspects.

67
0:04:03.34,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It is nutritious,

68
0:04:04.9,000 --> 0:04:07,000
particularly rich in methionine and cysteine,

69
0:04:08.7,000 --> 0:04:12,000
two amino acids that are deficient in most other major grains:

70
0:04:13.1,000 --> 0:04:16,000
barley, rice or wheat to name a few.

71
0:04:17.34,000 --> 0:04:18,000
In addition,

72
0:04:18.66,000 --> 0:04:21,000
fonio cultivation is great for the environment.

73
0:04:22.58,000 --> 0:04:24,000
It tolerates poor soil

74
0:04:24.62,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and needs very little water,

75
0:04:26.38,000 --> 0:04:28,000
surviving where nothing else will grow.

76
0:04:31.5,000 --> 0:04:32,000
As a chef,

77
0:04:32.98,000 --> 0:04:36,000
what first struck me was its delicate taste and its versatility.

78
0:04:39.78,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Similar to couscous,

79
0:04:42.82,000 --> 0:04:45,000
fonio has a delicious, nutty and earthy flavor.

80
0:04:47.9,000 --> 0:04:49,000
It can be turned into salad,

81
0:04:50.22,000 --> 0:04:52,000
served as noodles,

82
0:04:52.34,000 --> 0:04:53,000
used in baking

83
0:04:53.98,000 --> 0:04:58,000
or simply as a substitute for any other grains in your favorite recipes.

84
0:04:59.7,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I am happy to share some of my fonio sushi and sweet potato sushi

85
0:05:06.1,000 --> 0:05:07,000
with some of you right now.

86
0:05:08.22,000 --> 0:05:09,000
(Audience) Oh!

87
0:05:10.14,000 --> 0:05:12,000
(Applause)

88
0:05:12.66,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And okra.

89
0:05:19.3,000 --> 0:05:21,000
(Audience murmurs)

90
0:05:23.42,000 --> 0:05:24,000
In Kédougou

91
0:05:25.14,000 --> 0:05:27,000
it is also nicknamed "ñamu buur,"

92
0:05:28.46,000 --> 0:05:3,000
which means "food for royalty,"

93
0:05:30.98,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and it's served for guests of honor.

94
0:05:33.98,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Located at the border with Guinea and Mali,

95
0:05:38.46,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Kédougou first strikes visitors with its stunning vistas

96
0:05:41.9,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and views of the Fouta Djallon Mountains.

97
0:05:45.02,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Sadly, it is also one of the poorest regions of Senegal.

98
0:05:52.14,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Because of desertification and lack of job prospects,

99
0:05:55.98,000 --> 0:05:58,000
much of Kédougou's young population has left.

100
0:06:00.06,000 --> 0:06:02,000
They chose the deadly path of migration

101
0:06:03.02,000 --> 0:06:05,000
in search of "better" opportunities.

102
0:06:06.74,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Often,

103
0:06:08.86,000 --> 0:06:1,000
they risk their lives trying to reach Europe.

104
0:06:12.9,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Some leave by crossing the Sahara desert.

105
0:06:16.38,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Others end up on inadequate wooden canoes

106
0:06:19.78,000 --> 0:06:21,000
in desperate attempts to reach Spain.

107
0:06:24.1,000 --> 0:06:26,000
According to a recent "Guardian" article,

108
0:06:26.74,000 --> 0:06:31,000
by 2020 more that 60 million people from sub-Saharan Africa

109
0:06:32.58,000 --> 0:06:34,000
are expected to migrate

110
0:06:34.94,000 --> 0:06:35,000
due to desertification.

111
0:06:36.9,000 --> 0:06:41,000
This is the biggest global wave of migration since the Second World War,

112
0:06:42.78,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and it's only set to grow.

113
0:06:45.9,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So far this year,

114
0:06:47.98,000 --> 0:06:51,000
more that 2,100 migrants have lost their lives

115
0:06:52.1,000 --> 0:06:53,000
on their way to Europe.

116
0:06:54.9,000 --> 0:06:56,000
This is the reality of Kédougou

117
0:06:57.9,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and of much of the Sahel today.

118
0:07:01.34,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Scary future,

119
0:07:03.22,000 --> 0:07:04,000
scarce food

120
0:07:05.02,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and no opportunities to change their situation.

121
0:07:09.86,000 --> 0:07:12,000
If life in your village weren't so precarious,

122
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
if there was a way to having enough food to get by,

123
0:07:17.66,000 --> 0:07:18,000
or having a paying job --

124
0:07:20.62,000 --> 0:07:21,000
if you and your sisters

125
0:07:21.98,000 --> 0:07:26,000
didn't have to spend 30 percent of their waking hours

126
0:07:27.34,000 --> 0:07:28,000
fetching water,

127
0:07:30.06,000 --> 0:07:32,000
if conditions were just a little more hospitable ...

128
0:07:35.62,000 --> 0:07:38,000
could the solution be right here in our soil?

129
0:07:40.1,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Could bringing fonio to the rest of the world

130
0:07:43.02,000 --> 0:07:44,000
be the answer?

131
0:07:46.34,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Ancient grains are getting more popular,

132
0:07:48.5,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and sales of gluten-free items are growing in the US --

133
0:07:53.3,000 --> 0:07:56,000
16.4 percent since 2013,

134
0:07:56.54,000 --> 0:08:,000
making it a 23.3-billion-dollar industry.

135
0:08:02.78,000 --> 0:08:04,000
How could fonio partake in this market share?

136
0:08:07.78,000 --> 0:08:09,000
There are many challenges in turning fonio into food.

137
0:08:11.18,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Traditional processing is laborious and time-consuming,

138
0:08:14.66,000 --> 0:08:16,000
especially when compared to other grains.

139
0:08:20.54,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Well, thankfully, technology has evolved.

140
0:08:25.34,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And there are now machines

141
0:08:27.98,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that can process fonio in a more efficient way.

142
0:08:31.62,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And as a matter of fact,

143
0:08:34.02,000 --> 0:08:35,000
a few years ago,

144
0:08:35.66,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Sanoussi Diakité,

145
0:08:37.14,000 --> 0:08:38,000
a Senegalese engineer,

146
0:08:38.42,000 --> 0:08:4,000
won a Rolex prize

147
0:08:40.66,000 --> 0:08:43,000
for his invention of the first mechanized fonio processor.

148
0:08:45.58,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Today, such machines are making life much easier for producers

149
0:08:50.499,000 --> 0:08:51,000
around the whole Sahel region.

150
0:08:54.66,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Another challenge is the colonial mentality

151
0:08:58.94,000 --> 0:09:,000
that what comes from the west is best.

152
0:09:03.18,000 --> 0:09:06,000
This tendency to look down on our own products

153
0:09:06.22,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and to see crops like fonio as simply "country peoples' food,"

154
0:09:10.58,000 --> 0:09:11,000
therefore substandard,

155
0:09:12.46,000 --> 0:09:17,000
explains why even though we don't produce wheat in Senegal traditionally,

156
0:09:17.62,000 --> 0:09:21,000
it is far easier to find baguettes or croissants in the streets of Dakar

157
0:09:22.1,000 --> 0:09:24,000
than it is to find any fonio products.

158
0:09:26.82,000 --> 0:09:32,000
This same mindset popularized the overprocessed, leftover rice debris

159
0:09:33.22,000 --> 0:09:34,000
known as "broken rice,"

160
0:09:36.94,000 --> 0:09:39,000
which was imported to Senegal from Indochina

161
0:09:40.5,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and introduced by the colonial French.

162
0:09:45.42,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Soon, broken rice became a key ingredient in our national dish,

163
0:09:50.18,000 --> 0:09:51,000
thiéboudienne,

164
0:09:51.46,000 --> 0:09:56,000
replacing our own traditional, more nutritious African rice,

165
0:09:56.94,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Oryza glaberrima.

166
0:09:59.9,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Ironically, the same African rice despised at home

167
0:10:03.82,000 --> 0:10:04,000
was hailed abroad.

168
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Indeed, during the Atlantic slave trade,

169
0:10:09.3,000 --> 0:10:12,000
this rice became a major crop in the Americas ...

170
0:10:14.38,000 --> 0:10:15,000
particularly in the Carolinas

171
0:10:15.94,000 --> 0:10:17,000
where it was nicknamed, "Carolina gold."

172
0:10:20.46,000 --> 0:10:21,000
But let's return to fonio.

173
0:10:23.66,000 --> 0:10:27,000
How can we turn its current status of "country-people food"

174
0:10:28.18,000 --> 0:10:3,000
into a world-class crop?

175
0:10:32.38,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Last year,

176
0:10:33.98,000 --> 0:10:37,000
a business partner and I secured a commitment from Whole Foods Market,

177
0:10:38.42,000 --> 0:10:41,000
the US's largest natural food store chain,

178
0:10:41.82,000 --> 0:10:42,000
to carry fonio.

179
0:10:43.82,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And we got a large American ingredient importer

180
0:10:48.74,000 --> 0:10:51,000
interested enough to send a team of executives

181
0:10:51.78,000 --> 0:10:52,000
to West Africa with us

182
0:10:53.62,000 --> 0:10:55,000
to explore the supply chain's viability.

183
0:10:58.02,000 --> 0:11:03,000
We found ourselves observing manual operations

184
0:11:03.18,000 --> 0:11:05,000
in remote locations

185
0:11:05.54,000 --> 0:11:06,000
with few controls over quality.

186
0:11:08.62,000 --> 0:11:1,000
So we started focusing on processing issues.

187
0:11:12.78,000 --> 0:11:13,000
We drew up a vision

188
0:11:14.5,000 --> 0:11:18,000
with a beneficial and commercially sustainable supply chain for fonio,

189
0:11:19.3,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and we connected ourselves with organizations

190
0:11:22.18,000 --> 0:11:23,000
that can help us achieve it.

191
0:11:25.18,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Walking backwards from the market, here is what it looks like.

192
0:11:29.46,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Imagine that fonio is consumed all across the globe

193
0:11:35.74,000 --> 0:11:38,000
as other popular ancient grains.

194
0:11:41.14,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Fonio touted on the levels of cereals,

195
0:11:44.22,000 --> 0:11:45,000
breads,

196
0:11:45.86,000 --> 0:11:46,000
nutrition bars,

197
0:11:48.22,000 --> 0:11:49,000
cookies, pastas,

198
0:11:49.94,000 --> 0:11:5,000
snacks -- why not?

199
0:11:52.38,000 --> 0:11:54,000
It's easier to say than quinoa.

200
0:11:54.42,000 --> 0:11:56,000
(Laughter)

201
0:11:57.66,000 --> 0:12:02,000
(Applause)

202
0:12:03.9,000 --> 0:12:04,000
To get there,

203
0:12:05.42,000 --> 0:12:07,000
fonio needs to be readily available

204
0:12:07.86,000 --> 0:12:09,000
at a consistent quality for commercial users,

205
0:12:10.62,000 --> 0:12:13,000
such as food manufacturers and restaurant chains.

206
0:12:14.46,000 --> 0:12:15,000
That's the part we're missing.

207
0:12:16.86,000 --> 0:12:19,000
To make fonio available at a consistent quality

208
0:12:19.94,000 --> 0:12:2,000
for commercial use,

209
0:12:21.7,000 --> 0:12:24,000
you need a commercial-scale fonio mill

210
0:12:25.14,000 --> 0:12:28,000
that adheres to international quality standards.

211
0:12:29.18,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Currently, there is no such mill in the whole world,

212
0:12:33.06,000 --> 0:12:34,000
so in our vision,

213
0:12:34.74,000 --> 0:12:38,000
there is an African-owned and operated fonio mill

214
0:12:39.3,000 --> 0:12:41,000
that processes efficiently

215
0:12:41.82,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and in compliance with the requirements of multinational food companies.

216
0:12:48.18,000 --> 0:12:53,000
It is very difficult for the fonio producers today

217
0:12:53.5,000 --> 0:12:55,000
to sell and use fonio

218
0:12:56.06,000 --> 0:12:59,000
unless they devote a huge amount of time and energy

219
0:12:59.94,000 --> 0:13:02,000
in threshing, winnowing and husking it.

220
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
In our vision,

221
0:13:04.58,000 --> 0:13:06,000
the mill will take on those tasks,

222
0:13:07.3,000 --> 0:13:12,000
allowing the producers to focus on farming rather than processing.

223
0:13:14.22,000 --> 0:13:18,000
There is untapped agricultural capacity in the Sahel,

224
0:13:19.82,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and all it takes is changing market conditions

225
0:13:23.9,000 --> 0:13:24,000
to activate that capacity.

226
0:13:26.86,000 --> 0:13:3,000
By relieving fonio producers of manual operations,

227
0:13:31.7,000 --> 0:13:33,000
the mill will free up their time

228
0:13:34.02,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and remove the production bottleneck that limits their output.

229
0:13:39.1,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And there are other benefits as well

230
0:13:41.34,000 --> 0:13:45,000
in using Sahel land for agriculture.

231
0:13:47.66,000 --> 0:13:48,000
More benefits,

232
0:13:49.7,000 --> 0:13:5,000
higher employment,

233
0:13:52.1,000 --> 0:13:55,000
climate change mitigation by reversing desertification

234
0:13:57.18,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and greater food security.

235
0:13:59.5,000 --> 0:14:,000
Nice vision, right?

236
0:14:01.94,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Well, we are working towards getting it done.

237
0:14:05.06,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Last month we introduced fonio to shoppers in New York City

238
0:14:09.34,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and online,

239
0:14:10.58,000 --> 0:14:15,000
in a package that makes it attractive and desirable and accessible.

240
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
(Applause)

241
0:14:23.82,000 --> 0:14:27,000
We are talking with operators and investors in West Africa

242
0:14:28.54,000 --> 0:14:29,000
about building a fonio mill.

243
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And most importantly,

244
0:14:32.9,000 --> 0:14:35,000
we have teamed with an NGO called SOS SAHEL

245
0:14:36.1,000 --> 0:14:4,000
to recruit, train and equip smallholders in the Sahel

246
0:14:41.02,000 --> 0:14:42,000
to increase their fonio production.

247
0:14:44.42,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Hunger levels are higher in sub-Saharan Africa

248
0:14:47.58,000 --> 0:14:49,000
than any other place in the world.

249
0:14:51.34,000 --> 0:14:54,000
The Sahel population is set to grow

250
0:14:54.78,000 --> 0:14:58,000
from 135 million to 340 million people.

251
0:15:00.14,000 --> 0:15:04,000
However, in that drought- and famine-prone region,

252
0:15:04.78,000 --> 0:15:05,000
fonio grows freely.

253
0:15:08.18,000 --> 0:15:1,000
This tiny grain may provide big answers,

254
0:15:11.78,000 --> 0:15:13,000
reasserting its Dogon name,

255
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
"po," the seed of the universe,

256
0:15:17.06,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and taking us one step closer

257
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
to the universal civilization.

258
0:15:22.34,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Thank you.

259
0:15:23.94,000 --> 0:15:26,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Everybody talks about happiness these days.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I had somebody count the number of books

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
with "happiness" in the title published in the last five years

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and they gave up after about 40, and there were many more.

5
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
There is a huge wave of interest in happiness,

6
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
among researchers.

7
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
There is a lot of happiness coaching.

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Everybody would like to make people happier.

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
But in spite of all this flood of work,

10
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
there are several cognitive traps

11
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight

12
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
about happiness.

13
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps.

14
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness,

15
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness,

16
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else is.

17
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
The first of these traps

18
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
is a reluctance to admit complexity.

19
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
It turns out that the word "happiness"

20
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
is just not a useful word anymore,

21
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
because we apply it to too many different things.

22
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it,

23
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
but by and large,

24
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
this is something that we'll have to give up

25
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and we'll have to adopt the more complicated view

26
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
of what well-being is.

27
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory;

28
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
basically, it's between being happy in your life,

29
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and being happy about your life

30
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
or happy with your life.

31
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And those are two very different concepts,

32
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness.

33
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And the third is the focusing illusion,

34
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance

35
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that affects well-being

36
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
without distorting its importance.

37
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I mean, this is a real cognitive trap.

38
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
There's just no way of getting it right.

39
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Now, I'd like to start with an example

40
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
of somebody who had a question-and-answer session

41
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
after one of my lectures reported a story,

42
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and that was a story --

43
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
He said he'd been listening to a symphony,

44
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and it was absolutely glorious music

45
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and at the very end of the recording,

46
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
there was a dreadful screeching sound.

47
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And then he added, really quite emotionally,

48
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
it ruined the whole experience.

49
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
But it hadn't.

50
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
What it had ruined were the memories of the experience.

51
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
He had had the experience.

52
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
He had had 20 minutes of glorious music.

53
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
They counted for nothing

54
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
because he was left with a memory;

55
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
the memory was ruined,

56
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep.

57
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
What this is telling us, really,

58
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people

59
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
in terms of two selves.

60
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
There is an experiencing self,

61
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
who lives in the present

62
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and knows the present,

63
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
is capable of re-living the past,

64
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
but basically it has only the present.

65
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
It's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches --

66
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
you know, when the doctor asks,

67
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
"Does it hurt now when I touch you here?"

68
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And then there is a remembering self,

69
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and the remembering self is the one that keeps score,

70
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and maintains the story of our life,

71
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and it's the one that the doctor approaches

72
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
in asking the question,

73
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
"How have you been feeling lately?"

74
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
or "How was your trip to Albania?" or something like that.

75
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Those are two very different entities,

76
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
the experiencing self and the remembering self,

77
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and getting confused between them is part of the mess

78
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
about the notion of happiness.

79
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Now, the remembering self

80
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
is a storyteller.

81
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And that really starts with a basic response of our memories --

82
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
it starts immediately.

83
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
We don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories.

84
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Our memory tells us stories,

85
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that is, what we get to keep from our experiences

86
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
is a story.

87
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And let me begin with one example.

88
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
This is an old study.

89
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure.

90
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I won't go into detail. It's no longer painful these days,

91
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s.

92
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds.

93
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Here are two patients,

94
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
those are their recordings.

95
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And you are asked, "Who of them suffered more?"

96
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And it's a very easy question.

97
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Clearly, Patient B suffered more --

98
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
his colonoscopy was longer,

99
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and every minute of pain that Patient A had,

100
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Patient B had, and more.

101
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
But now there is another question:

102
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
"How much did these patients think they suffered?"

103
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And here is a surprise.

104
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
The surprise is that Patient A

105
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy

106
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
than Patient B.

107
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
The stories of the colonoscopies were different,

108
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends.

109
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great --

110
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
but one of them is this distinct ... (Laughter)

111
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
but one of them is distinctly worse than the other.

112
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And the one that is worse

113
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end;

114
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
it's a bad story.

115
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
How do we know that?

116
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy,

117
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and much later, too,

118
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
"How bad was the whole thing, in total?"

119
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And it was much worse for A than for B, in memory.

120
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Now this is a direct conflict

121
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
between the experiencing self and the remembering self.

122
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
From the point of view of the experiencing self,

123
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
clearly, B had a worse time.

124
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Now, what you could do with Patient A,

125
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
and we actually ran clinical experiments,

126
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and it has been done, and it does work --

127
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A

128
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much.

129
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
That will cause the patient

130
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
to suffer, but just a little

131
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and much less than before.

132
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And if you do that for a couple of minutes,

133
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
you have made the experiencing self

134
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
of Patient A worse off,

135
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and you have the remembering self of Patient A

136
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
a lot better off,

137
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
because now you have endowed Patient A

138
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
with a better story

139
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
about his experience.

140
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
What defines a story?

141
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And that is true of the stories

142
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that memory delivers for us,

143
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and it's also true of the stories that we make up.

144
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
What defines a story are changes,

145
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
significant moments and endings.

146
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Endings are very, very important

147
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and, in this case, the ending dominated.

148
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Now, the experiencing self

149
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
lives its life continuously.

150
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
It has moments of experience, one after the other.

151
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And you can ask: What happens to these moments?

152
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And the answer is really straightforward:

153
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
They are lost forever.

154
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I mean, most of the moments of our life --

155
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and I calculated, you know, the psychological present

156
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
is said to be about three seconds long;

157
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that means that, you know,

158
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
in a life there are about 600 million of them;

159
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
in a month, there are about 600,000 --

160
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
most of them don't leave a trace.

161
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Most of them are completely ignored

162
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
by the remembering self.

163
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And yet, somehow you get the sense

164
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that they should count,

165
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
that what happens during these moments of experience

166
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
is our life.

167
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
It's the finite resource that we're spending

168
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
while we're on this earth.

169
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And how to spend it

170
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
would seem to be relevant,

171
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
but that is not the story

172
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
that the remembering self keeps for us.

173
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So we have the remembering self

174
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and the experiencing self,

175
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and they're really quite distinct.

176
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
The biggest difference between them

177
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
is in the handling of time.

178
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
From the point of view of the experiencing self,

179
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
if you have a vacation,

180
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and the second week is just as good as the first,

181
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
then the two-week vacation

182
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
is twice as good as the one-week vacation.

183
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
That's not the way it works at all for the remembering self.

184
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
For the remembering self, a two-week vacation

185
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
is barely better than the one-week vacation

186
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
because there are no new memories added.

187
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
You have not changed the story.

188
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And in this way,

189
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
time is actually the critical variable

190
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that distinguishes a remembering self

191
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
from an experiencing self;

192
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
time has very little impact on the story.

193
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Now, the remembering self does more

194
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
than remember and tell stories.

195
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
It is actually the one that makes decisions

196
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
because, if you have a patient who has had, say,

197
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
two colonoscopies with two different surgeons

198
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and is deciding which of them to choose,

199
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
then the one that chooses

200
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
is the one that has the memory that is less bad,

201
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and that's the surgeon that will be chosen.

202
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
The experiencing self

203
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
has no voice in this choice.

204
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
We actually don't choose between experiences,

205
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
we choose between memories of experiences.

206
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And even when we think about the future,

207
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
we don't think of our future normally as experiences.

208
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
We think of our future

209
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
as anticipated memories.

210
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And basically you can look at this,

211
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
you know, as a tyranny of the remembering self,

212
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and you can think of the remembering self

213
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
sort of dragging the experiencing self

214
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
through experiences that

215
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
the experiencing self doesn't need.

216
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
I have that sense that

217
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
when we go on vacations

218
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
this is very frequently the case;

219
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
that is, we go on vacations,

220
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
to a very large extent,

221
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
in the service of our remembering self.

222
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And this is a bit hard to justify I think.

223
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
I mean, how much do we consume our memories?

224
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
That is one of the explanations

225
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
that is given for the dominance

226
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
of the remembering self.

227
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And when I think about that, I think about a vacation

228
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
we had in Antarctica a few years ago,

229
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
which was clearly the best vacation I've ever had,

230
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and I think of it relatively often,

231
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
relative to how much I think of other vacations.

232
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And I probably have consumed

233
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
my memories of that three-week trip, I would say,

234
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
for about 25 minutes in the last four years.

235
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Now, if I had ever opened the folder

236
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
with the 600 pictures in it,

237
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I would have spent another hour.

238
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Now, that is three weeks,

239
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and that is at most an hour and a half.

240
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
There seems to be a discrepancy.

241
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Now, I may be a bit extreme, you know,

242
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
in how little appetite I have for consuming memories,

243
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
but even if you do more of this,

244
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
there is a genuine question:

245
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Why do we put so much weight on memory

246
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
relative to the weight that we put on experiences?

247
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
So I want you to think

248
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
about a thought experiment.

249
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Imagine that for your next vacation,

250
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
you know that at the end of the vacation

251
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
all your pictures will be destroyed,

252
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and you'll get an amnesic drug

253
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
so that you won't remember anything.

254
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Now, would you choose the same vacation? (Laughter)

255
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And if you would choose a different vacation,

256
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
there is a conflict between your two selves,

257
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict,

258
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and it's actually not at all obvious, because

259
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
if you think in terms of time,

260
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
then you get one answer,

261
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and if you think in terms of memories,

262
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
you might get another answer.

263
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Why do we pick the vacations we do

264
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
is a problem that confronts us

265
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
with a choice between the two selves.

266
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Now, the two selves

267
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
bring up two notions of happiness.

268
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
There are really two concepts of happiness

269
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
that we can apply, one per self.

270
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
So you can ask: How happy is the experiencing self?

271
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And then you would ask: How happy are the moments

272
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
in the experiencing self's life?

273
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And they're all -- happiness for moments

274
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
is a fairly complicated process.

275
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
What are the emotions that can be measured?

276
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And, by the way, now we are capable

277
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
of getting a pretty good idea

278
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
of the happiness of the experiencing self over time.

279
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self,

280
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
it's a completely different thing.

281
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
This is not about how happily a person lives.

282
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is

283
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
when that person thinks about her life.

284
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Very different notion.

285
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions

286
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
is going to mess up the study of happiness,

287
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and I belong to a crowd of students of well-being,

288
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
who've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time

289
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
in precisely this way.

290
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
The distinction between the

291
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
happiness of the experiencing self

292
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and the satisfaction of the remembering self

293
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
has been recognized in recent years,

294
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and there are now efforts to measure the two separately.

295
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
The Gallup Organization has a world poll

296
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
where more than half a million people

297
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
have been asked questions

298
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
about what they think of their life

299
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and about their experiences,

300
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and there have been other efforts along those lines.

301
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
So in recent years, we have begun to learn

302
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
about the happiness of the two selves.

303
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
And the main lesson I think that we have learned

304
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
is they are really different.

305
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life,

306
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and that really doesn't teach you much

307
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
about how happily they're living their life,

308
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and vice versa.

309
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
Just to give you a sense of the correlation,

310
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
the correlation is about .5.

311
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
What that means is if you met somebody,

312
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and you were told, "Oh his father is six feet tall,"

313
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
how much would you know about his height?

314
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Well, you would know something about his height,

315
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
but there's a lot of uncertainty.

316
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
You have that much uncertainty.

317
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
If I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten,

318
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
you have a lot of uncertainty

319
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
about how happy they are

320
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
with their experiencing self.

321
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
So the correlation is low.

322
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
We know something about what controls

323
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
satisfaction of the happiness self.

324
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
We know that money is very important,

325
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
goals are very important.

326
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
We know that happiness is mainly

327
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
being satisfied with people that we like,

328
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
spending time with people that we like.

329
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
There are other pleasures, but this is dominant.

330
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves,

331
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
you are going to end up

332
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
doing very different things.

333
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
The bottom line of what I've said here

334
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
is that we really should not think of happiness

335
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
as a substitute for well-being.

336
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
It is a completely different notion.

337
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Now, very quickly,

338
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
another reason we cannot think straight about happiness

339
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
is that we do not attend to the same things

340
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
when we think about life, and we actually live.

341
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
So, if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California,

342
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
you are not going to get to the correct answer.

343
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
When you ask that question,

344
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
you think people must be happier in California

345
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
if, say, you live in Ohio.

346
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
(Laughter)

347
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
And what happens is

348
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
when you think about living in California,

349
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
you are thinking of the contrast

350
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
between California and other places,

351
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
and that contrast, say, is in climate.

352
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Well, it turns out that climate

353
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
is not very important to the experiencing self

354
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and it's not even very important to the reflective self

355
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
that decides how happy people are.

356
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
But now, because the reflective self is in charge,

357
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
you may end up -- some people may end up

358
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
moving to California.

359
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
And it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen

360
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier.

361
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Well, their experiencing self

362
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
is not going to get happier.

363
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
We know that.

364
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
But one thing will happen: They will think they are happier,

365
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
because, when they think about it,

366
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio,

367
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
and they will feel they made the right decision.

368
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
It is very difficult

369
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
to think straight about well-being,

370
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
and I hope I have given you a sense

371
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
of how difficult it is.

372
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
Thank you.

373
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
(Applause)

374
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I've got a question for you.

375
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
Thank you so much.

376
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
Now, when we were on the phone a few weeks ago,

377
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result

378
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
came out of that Gallup survey.

379
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
Is that something you can share

380
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
since you do have a few moments left now?

381
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Daniel Kahneman: Sure.

382
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey

383
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
is a number, which we absolutely did not expect to find.

384
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
We found that with respect to the happiness

385
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
of the experiencing self.

386
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
When we looked at how feelings,

387
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
vary with income.

388
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
And it turns out that, below an income

389
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
of 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans --

390
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
and that's a very large sample of Americans, like 600,000,

391
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
so it's a large representative sample --

392
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
below an income of 600,000 dollars a year...

393
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
CA: 60,000.

394
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
DK: 60,000.

395
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
(Laughter)

396
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
60,000 dollars a year, people are unhappy,

397
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get.

398
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
Above that, we get an absolutely flat line.

399
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:06,000
I mean I've rarely seen lines so flat.

400
0:18:06.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
Clearly, what is happening is

401
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
money does not buy you experiential happiness,

402
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
but lack of money certainly buys you misery,

403
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
and we can measure that misery

404
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
very, very clearly.

405
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:21,000
In terms of the other self, the remembering self,

406
0:18:21.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
you get a different story.

407
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:26,000
The more money you earn, the more satisfied you are.

408
0:18:26.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
That does not hold for emotions.

409
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
CA: But Danny, the whole American endeavor is about

410
0:18:31.26,000 --> 0:18:34,000
life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.

411
0:18:34.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
If people took seriously that finding,

412
0:18:38.26,000 --> 0:18:41,000
I mean, it seems to turn upside down

413
0:18:41.26,000 --> 0:18:43,000
everything we believe about, like for example,

414
0:18:43.26,000 --> 0:18:45,000
taxation policy and so forth.

415
0:18:45.26,000 --> 0:18:48,000
Is there any chance that politicians, that the country generally,

416
0:18:48.26,000 --> 0:18:51,000
would take a finding like that seriously

417
0:18:51.26,000 --> 0:18:53,000
and run public policy based on it?

418
0:18:53.26,000 --> 0:18:55,000
DK: You know I think that there is recognition

419
0:18:55.26,000 --> 0:18:58,000
of the role of happiness research in public policy.

420
0:18:58.26,000 --> 0:19:,000
The recognition is going to be slow in the United States,

421
0:19:00.26,000 --> 0:19:02,000
no question about that,

422
0:19:02.26,000 --> 0:19:04,000
but in the U.K., it is happening,

423
0:19:04.26,000 --> 0:19:06,000
and in other countries it is happening.

424
0:19:06.26,000 --> 0:19:09,000
People are recognizing that they ought

425
0:19:09.26,000 --> 0:19:11,000
to be thinking of happiness

426
0:19:11.26,000 --> 0:19:13,000
when they think of public policy.

427
0:19:13.26,000 --> 0:19:15,000
It's going to take a while,

428
0:19:15.26,000 --> 0:19:18,000
and people are going to debate

429
0:19:18.26,000 --> 0:19:2,000
whether they want to study experience happiness,

430
0:19:20.26,000 --> 0:19:22,000
or whether they want to study life evaluation,

431
0:19:22.26,000 --> 0:19:25,000
so we need to have that debate fairly soon.

432
0:19:25.26,000 --> 0:19:27,000
How to enhance happiness

433
0:19:27.26,000 --> 0:19:3,000
goes very different ways depending on how you think,

434
0:19:30.26,000 --> 0:19:32,000
and whether you think of the remembering self

435
0:19:32.26,000 --> 0:19:34,000
or you think of the experiencing self.

436
0:19:34.26,000 --> 0:19:37,000
This is going to influence policy, I think, in years to come.

437
0:19:37.26,000 --> 0:19:4,000
In the United States, efforts are being made

438
0:19:40.26,000 --> 0:19:43,000
to measure the experience happiness of the population.

439
0:19:43.26,000 --> 0:19:46,000
This is going to be, I think, within the next decade or two,

440
0:19:46.26,000 --> 0:19:48,000
part of national statistics.

441
0:19:48.26,000 --> 0:19:52,000
CA: Well, it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be --

442
0:19:52.26,000 --> 0:19:54,000
the most interesting policy discussion to track

443
0:19:54.26,000 --> 0:19:56,000
over the next few years.

444
0:19:56.26,000 --> 0:19:58,000
Thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics.

445
0:19:58.26,000 --> 0:20:,000
Thank you, Danny Kahneman.

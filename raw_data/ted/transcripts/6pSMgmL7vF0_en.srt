1
0:00:13.375,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm a protein designer.

2
0:00:16.917,000 --> 0:00:18,000
And I'd like to discuss a new type of medicine.

3
0:00:19.875,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It's made from a molecule called a constrained peptide.

4
0:00:24,000 --> 0:00:26,000
There are only a few constrained peptide drugs available today,

5
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:3,000
but there are a lot that will hit the market in the coming decade.

6
0:00:30.167,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Let's explore what these new medicines are made of,

7
0:00:32.625,000 --> 0:00:35,000
how they're different and what's causing this incoming tidal wave

8
0:00:35.792,000 --> 0:00:36,000
of new and exciting medicines.

9
0:00:38.167,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Constrained peptides are very small proteins.

10
0:00:42.208,000 --> 0:00:45,000
They've got extra chemical bonds that constrain the shape of the molecule,

11
0:00:45.709,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and this makes them incredibly stable

12
0:00:47.708,000 --> 0:00:48,000
as well as highly potent.

13
0:00:50.125,000 --> 0:00:53,000
They're naturally occurring, our bodies actually produce a few of these

14
0:00:53.542,000 --> 0:00:55,000
that help us to combat bacterial, fungal and viral infections.

15
0:00:56.471,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And animals like snakes and scorpions

16
0:00:58.375,000 --> 0:01:,000
use constrained peptides in their venom.

17
0:01:00.625,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Drugs that are made of protein are called biologic drugs.

18
0:01:03.833,000 --> 0:01:04,000
So this includes constrained peptides,

19
0:01:05.75,000 --> 0:01:07,000
as well as medicines like insulin

20
0:01:08.208,000 --> 0:01:11,000
or antibody drugs like Humira or Enbrel.

21
0:01:11.833,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And in general, biologics are great,

22
0:01:14.958,000 --> 0:01:18,000
because they avoid several ways that drugs can cause side effects.

23
0:01:19.167,000 --> 0:01:2,000
First, protein.

24
0:01:20.625,000 --> 0:01:23,000
It's a totally natural, nontoxic material in our bodies.

25
0:01:23.75,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Our cells produce tens of thousands of different proteins,

26
0:01:26.542,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and basically, all of our food has protein in it.

27
0:01:29.25,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And second, sometimes drugs interact with molecules in your body

28
0:01:33.167,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that you don't want them to.

29
0:01:34.625,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Compared to small molecule drugs,

30
0:01:36.542,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and by this I mean regular drugs, like aspirin,

31
0:01:39.333,000 --> 0:01:4,000
biologics are quite large.

32
0:01:41.292,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Molecules interact when they adopt shapes that fit together perfectly.

33
0:01:45.208,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Much like a lock and key.

34
0:01:46.75,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Well, a larger key has more grooves,

35
0:01:48.792,000 --> 0:01:51,000
so it's more likely to fit into a single lock.

36
0:01:52.167,000 --> 0:01:54,000
But most biologics also have a flaw.

37
0:01:54.917,000 --> 0:01:55,000
They're fragile.

38
0:01:56.208,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So they're usually administered by injection,

39
0:01:58.375,000 --> 0:02:,000
because our stomach acid would destroy the medicine

40
0:02:00.833,000 --> 0:02:01,000
if we tried to swallow it.

41
0:02:02.125,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Constrained peptides are the opposite.

42
0:02:04.042,000 --> 0:02:06,000
They're really durable, like regular drugs.

43
0:02:06.208,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So it's possible to administer them using pills, inhalers, ointments.

44
0:02:11.792,000 --> 0:02:15,000
This is what makes constrained peptides so desirable for drug development.

45
0:02:16.083,000 --> 0:02:17,000
They combine some of the best features

46
0:02:17.917,000 --> 0:02:2,000
of small-molecule and biologic drugs into one.

47
0:02:21.708,000 --> 0:02:23,000
But unfortunately, it's incredibly difficult

48
0:02:24.292,000 --> 0:02:26,000
to reengineer the constrained peptides that we find in nature

49
0:02:27.208,000 --> 0:02:28,000
to become new drugs.

50
0:02:28.917,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So this is where I come in.

51
0:02:30.25,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Creating a new drug is a lot like crafting a key

52
0:02:33.625,000 --> 0:02:35,000
to fit a particular lock.

53
0:02:36.125,000 --> 0:02:37,000
We need to get the shape just right.

54
0:02:37.875,000 --> 0:02:4,000
But if we change the shape of a constrained peptide by too much,

55
0:02:40.917,000 --> 0:02:42,000
those extra chemical bonds are unable to form

56
0:02:43.083,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and the whole molecule falls apart.

57
0:02:45.083,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So we needed to figure out how to gain control over their shape.

58
0:02:48.542,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I was part of a collaborative scientific effort

59
0:02:50.792,000 --> 0:02:53,000
that spanned a dozen institutions across three continents

60
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:57,000
that came together and solved this problem.

61
0:02:57.417,000 --> 0:03:,000
We took a radically different approach from previous efforts.

62
0:03:00.542,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Instead of making changes to the constrained peptides

63
0:03:03.083,000 --> 0:03:04,000
that we find in nature,

64
0:03:04.375,000 --> 0:03:07,000
we figured out how to build new ones totally from scratch.

65
0:03:07.667,000 --> 0:03:08,000
To help us do this,

66
0:03:08.958,000 --> 0:03:11,000
we developed freely available open-source peptide-design software

67
0:03:12.03,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that anyone can use to do this, too.

68
0:03:13.833,000 --> 0:03:14,000
To test our method out,

69
0:03:15.292,000 --> 0:03:17,000
we generated a series of constrained peptides

70
0:03:18.25,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that have a wide variety of different shapes.

71
0:03:20.5,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Many of these had never been seen in nature before.

72
0:03:22.958,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Then we went into the laboratory and produced these peptides.

73
0:03:25.875,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Next, we determined their molecular structures,

74
0:03:28.417,000 --> 0:03:29,000
using experiments.

75
0:03:29.833,000 --> 0:03:3,000
When we compared our designed models

76
0:03:31.75,000 --> 0:03:32,000
with the real molecular structures,

77
0:03:33.5,000 --> 0:03:36,000
we found that our software can position individual atoms

78
0:03:36.625,000 --> 0:03:39,000
with an accuracy that's at the limit of what's possible to measure.

79
0:03:39.875,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Three years ago, this couldn't be done.

80
0:03:42.083,000 --> 0:03:45,000
But today, we have the ability to create designer peptides

81
0:03:45.125,000 --> 0:03:48,000
with shapes that are custom-tailored for drug development.

82
0:03:48.542,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So where is this technology taking us?

83
0:03:51.292,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Well, recently,

84
0:03:52.583,000 --> 0:03:54,000
my colleagues and I designed constrained peptides

85
0:03:54.893,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that neutralize influenza virus,

86
0:03:58.333,000 --> 0:04:,000
protect against botulism poisoning

87
0:04:01.292,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and block cancer cells from growing.

88
0:04:03.417,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Some of these new drugs

89
0:04:04.75,000 --> 0:04:06,000
have been tested in preclinical trials with laboratory animals.

90
0:04:07.75,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And so far, they're all safe and highly effective.

91
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Constrained peptide design is a cutting-edge technology,

92
0:04:15.167,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and the drug development pipeline is slow and cautious.

93
0:04:17.792,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So we're still three to five years out from human trials.

94
0:04:20.5,000 --> 0:04:21,000
But during that time,

95
0:04:21.792,000 --> 0:04:22,000
more constrained peptide drugs

96
0:04:23.25,000 --> 0:04:25,000
are going to be entering the drug development pipeline.

97
0:04:25.875,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And ultimately, I believe that designed peptide drugs

98
0:04:30.042,000 --> 0:04:32,000
are going to enable us all to break free

99
0:04:32.083,000 --> 0:04:34,000
from the constraints of our diseases.

100
0:04:34.625,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Thank you.

101
0:04:35.917,000 --> 0:04:39,000

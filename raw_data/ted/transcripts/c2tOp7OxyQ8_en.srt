1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Well this is a really extraordinary honor for me.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I spend most of my time

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
in jails, in prisons, on death row.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I spend most of my time in very low-income communities

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
in the projects and places where there's a great deal of hopelessness.

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And being here at TED

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and seeing the stimulation, hearing it,

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
has been very, very energizing to me.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And one of the things that's emerged in my short time here

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
is that TED has an identity.

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And you can actually say things here

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that have impacts around the world.

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And sometimes when it comes through TED,

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
it has meaning and power

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
that it doesn't have when it doesn't.

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And I mention that because I think identity is really important.

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And we've had some fantastic presentations.

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
And I think what we've learned

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
is that, if you're a teacher your words can be meaningful,

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
but if you're a compassionate teacher,

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
they can be especially meaningful.

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
If you're a doctor you can do some good things,

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
but if you're a caring doctor you can do some other things.

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And so I want to talk about the power of identity.

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And I didn't learn about this actually

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
practicing law and doing the work that I do.

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I actually learned about this from my grandmother.

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I grew up in a house

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that was the traditional African-American home

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that was dominated by a matriarch,

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and that matriarch was my grandmother.

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
She was tough, she was strong,

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
she was powerful.

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
She was the end of every argument in our family.

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
She was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family.

36
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
She was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved.

37
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Her parents were born in slavery in Virginia in the 1840's.

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
She was born in the 1880's

39
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and the experience of slavery

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
very much shaped the way she saw the world.

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And my grandmother was tough, but she was also loving.

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
When I would see her as a little boy,

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
she'd come up to me and she'd give me these hugs.

44
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And she'd squeeze me so tight I could barely breathe

45
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and then she'd let me go.

46
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And an hour or two later, if I saw her,

47
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
she'd come over to me and she'd say, "Bryan, do you still feel me hugging you?"

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And if I said, "No," she'd assault me again,

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and if I said, "Yes," she'd leave me alone.

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And she just had this quality

51
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that you always wanted to be near her.

52
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And the only challenge was that she had 10 children.

53
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
My mom was the youngest of her 10 kids.

54
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And sometimes when I would go and spend time with her,

55
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
it would be difficult to get her time and attention.

56
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
My cousins would be running around everywhere.

57
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And I remember, when I was about eight or nine years old,

58
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
waking up one morning, going into the living room,

59
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and all of my cousins were running around.

60
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And my grandmother was sitting across the room

61
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
staring at me.

62
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And at first I thought we were playing a game.

63
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And I would look at her and I'd smile,

64
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
but she was very serious.

65
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And after about 15 or 20 minutes of this,

66
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
she got up and she came across the room

67
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and she took me by the hand

68
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and she said, "Come on, Bryan. You and I are going to have a talk."

69
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And I remember this just like it happened yesterday.

70
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I never will forget it.

71
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
She took me out back and she said, "Bryan, I'm going to tell you something,

72
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
but you don't tell anybody what I tell you."

73
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I said, "Okay, Mama."

74
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
She said, "Now you make sure you don't do that." I said, "Sure."

75
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Then she sat me down and she looked at me

76
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and she said, "I want you to know

77
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I've been watching you."

78
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And she said, "I think you're special."

79
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
She said, "I think you can do anything you want to do."

80
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I will never forget it.

81
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And then she said, "I just need you to promise me three things, Bryan."

82
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I said, "Okay, Mama."

83
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
She said, "The first thing I want you to promise me

84
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
is that you'll always love your mom."

85
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
She said, "That's my baby girl,

86
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and you have to promise me now you'll always take care of her."

87
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Well I adored my mom, so I said, "Yes, Mama. I'll do that."

88
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Then she said, "The second thing I want you to promise me

89
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
is that you'll always do the right thing

90
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
even when the right thing is the hard thing."

91
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And I thought about it and I said, "Yes, Mama. I'll do that."

92
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Then finally she said, "The third thing I want you to promise me

93
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
is that you'll never drink alcohol."

94
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
(Laughter)

95
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Well I was nine years old, so I said, "Yes, Mama. I'll do that."

96
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I grew up in the country in the rural South,

97
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger.

98
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
When I was about 14 or 15,

99
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
one day my brother came home and he had this six-pack of beer --

100
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I don't know where he got it --

101
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods.

102
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did.

103
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some,

104
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and they offered it to me.

105
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I said, "No, no, no. That's okay. You all go ahead. I'm not going to have any beer."

106
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
My brother said, "Come on. We're doing this today; you always do what we do.

107
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I had some, your sister had some. Have some beer."

108
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I said, "No, I don't feel right about that. Y'all go ahead. Y'all go ahead."

109
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And then my brother started staring at me.

110
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
He said, "What's wrong with you? Have some beer."

111
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Then he looked at me real hard and he said,

112
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
"Oh, I hope you're not still hung up

113
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
on that conversation Mama had with you."

114
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
(Laughter)

115
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I said, "Well, what are you talking about?"

116
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
He said, "Oh, Mama tells all the grandkids that they're special."

117
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
(Laughter)

118
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I was devastated.

119
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Laughter)

120
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And I'm going to admit something to you.

121
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I'm going to tell you something I probably shouldn't.

122
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I know this might be broadcast broadly.

123
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
But I'm 52 years old,

124
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and I'm going to admit to you

125
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
that I've never had a drop of alcohol.

126
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
(Applause)

127
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I don't say that because I think that's virtuous;

128
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I say that because there is power in identity.

129
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
When we create the right kind of identity,

130
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
we can say things to the world around us

131
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
that they don't actually believe makes sense.

132
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
We can get them to do things

133
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that they don't think they can do.

134
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
When I thought about my grandmother,

135
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
of course she would think all her grandkids were special.

136
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
My grandfather was in prison during prohibition.

137
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
My male uncles died of alcohol-related diseases.

138
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And these were the things she thought we needed to commit to.

139
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Well I've been trying to say something

140
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
about our criminal justice system.

141
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
This country is very different today

142
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
than it was 40 years ago.

143
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
In 1972, there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons.

144
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Today, there are 2.3 million.

145
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
The United States now has the highest rate of incarceration

146
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
in the world.

147
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We have seven million people on probation and parole.

148
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And mass incarceration, in my judgment,

149
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
has fundamentally changed our world.

150
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
In poor communities, in communities of color

151
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
there is this despair,

152
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
there is this hopelessness,

153
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that is being shaped by these outcomes.

154
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
One out of three black men

155
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
between the ages of 18 and 30

156
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
is in jail, in prison, on probation or parole.

157
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
In urban communities across this country --

158
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington --

159
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are

160
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
in jail or prison or on probation or parole.

161
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Our system isn't just being shaped

162
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
in these ways that seem to be distorting around race,

163
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
they're also distorted by poverty.

164
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
We have a system of justice in this country

165
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
that treats you much better

166
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.

167
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Wealth, not culpability,

168
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
shapes outcomes.

169
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
And yet, we seem to be very comfortable.

170
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
The politics of fear and anger

171
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
have made us believe

172
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that these are problems that are not our problems.

173
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
We've been disconnected.

174
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
It's interesting to me.

175
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
We're looking at some very interesting developments in our work.

176
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
My state of Alabama, like a number of states,

177
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
actually permanently disenfranchises you

178
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
if you have a criminal conviction.

179
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Right now in Alabama

180
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
34 percent of the black male population

181
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
has permanently lost the right to vote.

182
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
We're actually projecting in another 10 years

183
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
the level of disenfranchisement

184
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
will be as high as it's been

185
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
since prior to the passage of the Voting Rights Act.

186
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And there is this stunning silence.

187
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I represent children.

188
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
A lot of my clients are very young.

189
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
The United States is the only country in the world

190
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
where we sentence 13-year-old children

191
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
to die in prison.

192
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
We have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country.

193
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And we're actually doing some litigation.

194
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
The only country in the world.

195
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I represent people on death row.

196
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
It's interesting, this question of the death penalty.

197
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
In many ways, we've been taught to think

198
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that the real question is,

199
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
do people deserve to die for the crimes they've committed?

200
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And that's a very sensible question.

201
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
But there's another way of thinking

202
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
about where we are in our identity.

203
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
The other way of thinking about it

204
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
is not, do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit,

205
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
but do we deserve to kill?

206
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I mean, it's fascinating.

207
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Death penalty in America is defined by error.

208
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
For every nine people who have been executed,

209
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
we've actually identified one innocent person

210
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
who's been exonerated and released from death row.

211
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
A kind of astonishing error rate --

212
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
one out of nine people innocent.

213
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I mean, it's fascinating.

214
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
In aviation, we would never let people fly on airplanes

215
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
if for every nine planes that took off

216
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
one would crash.

217
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
But somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem.

218
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
It's not our problem.

219
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
It's not our burden.

220
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
It's not our struggle.

221
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I talk a lot about these issues.

222
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I talk about race and this question

223
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
of whether we deserve to kill.

224
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And it's interesting, when I teach my students about African-American history,

225
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I tell them about slavery.

226
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I tell them about terrorism,

227
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
the era that began at the end of reconstruction

228
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
that went on to World War II.

229
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
We don't really know very much about it.

230
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
But for African-Americans in this country,

231
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that was an era defined by terror.

232
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
In many communities, people had to worry about being lynched.

233
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
They had to worry about being bombed.

234
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
It was the threat of terror that shaped their lives.

235
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And these older people come up to me now

236
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and they say, "Mr. Stevenson, you give talks, you make speeches,

237
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
you tell people to stop saying

238
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
we're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation's history

239
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
after 9/11."

240
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
They tell me to say, "No, tell them that we grew up with that."

241
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And that era of terrorism, of course,

242
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
was followed by segregation

243
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and decades of racial subordination

244
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and apartheid.

245
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And yet, we have in this country this dynamic

246
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
where we really don't like to talk about our problems.

247
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
We don't like to talk about our history.

248
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And because of that, we really haven't understood

249
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
what it's meant to do the things we've done historically.

250
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
We're constantly running into each other.

251
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
We're constantly creating tensions and conflicts.

252
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
We have a hard time talking about race,

253
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and I believe it's because we are unwilling to commit ourselves

254
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
to a process of truth and reconciliation.

255
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
In South Africa, people understood

256
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
that we couldn't overcome apartheid

257
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.

258
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
In Rwanda, even after the genocide, there was this commitment,

259
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
but in this country we haven't done that.

260
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
I was giving some lectures in Germany about the death penalty.

261
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
It was fascinating

262
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
because one of the scholars stood up after the presentation

263
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and said, "Well you know it's deeply troubling

264
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
to hear what you're talking about."

265
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
He said, "We don't have the death penalty in Germany.

266
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And of course, we can never have the death penalty in Germany."

267
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And the room got very quiet,

268
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and this woman said,

269
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
"There's no way, with our history,

270
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
we could ever engage

271
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
in the systematic killing of human beings.

272
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
It would be unconscionable for us

273
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
to, in an intentional and deliberate way,

274
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
set about executing people."

275
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And I thought about that.

276
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
What would it feel like

277
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
to be living in a world

278
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
where the nation state of Germany was executing people,

279
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
especially if they were disproportionately Jewish?

280
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I couldn't bear it.

281
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
It would be unconscionable.

282
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And yet, in this country,

283
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
in the states of the Old South,

284
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
we execute people --

285
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
where you're 11 times more likely to get the death penalty

286
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
if the victim is white than if the victim is black,

287
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
22 times more likely to get it

288
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
if the defendant is black and the victim is white --

289
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
in the very states where there are buried in the ground

290
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
the bodies of people who were lynched.

291
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And yet, there is this disconnect.

292
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Well I believe that our identity is at risk.

293
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
That when we actually don't care

294
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
about these difficult things,

295
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
the positive and wonderful things

296
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
are nonetheless implicated.

297
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
We love innovation.

298
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
We love technology. We love creativity.

299
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
We love entertainment.

300
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
But ultimately,

301
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
those realities

302
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
are shadowed by suffering,

303
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
abuse, degradation,

304
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
marginalization.

305
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And for me, it becomes necessary

306
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
to integrate the two.

307
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Because ultimately we are talking

308
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
about a need to be more hopeful,

309
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
more committed, more dedicated

310
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
to the basic challenges of living in a complex world.

311
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And for me that means

312
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
spending time thinking and talking

313
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
about the poor, the disadvantaged,

314
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
those who will never get to TED.

315
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
But thinking about them in a way

316
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
that is integrated in our own lives.

317
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
You know ultimately, we all have to believe things we haven't seen.

318
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
We do. As rational as we are, as committed to intellect as we are.

319
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Innovation, creativity,

320
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
development comes

321
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
not from the ideas in our mind alone.

322
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
They come from the ideas in our mind

323
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
that are also fueled

324
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
by some conviction in our heart.

325
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And it's that mind-heart connection

326
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
that I believe compels us

327
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
to not just be attentive

328
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
to all the bright and dazzly things,

329
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
but also the dark and difficult things.

330
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Vaclav Havel, the great Czech leader, talked about this.

331
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with oppression,

332
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
we wanted all kinds of things,

333
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
but mostly what we needed was hope,

334
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
an orientation of the spirit,

335
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
a willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places

336
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and be a witness."

337
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Well that orientation of the spirit

338
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
is very much at the core of what I believe

339
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
even TED communities

340
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
have to be engaged in.

341
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
There is no disconnect

342
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
around technology and design

343
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
that will allow us to be fully human

344
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
until we pay attention to suffering,

345
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
to poverty, to exclusion, to unfairness, to injustice.

346
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Now I will warn you

347
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
that this kind of identity

348
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
is a much more challenging identity

349
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
than ones that don't pay attention to this.

350
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
It will get to you.

351
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
I had the great privilege, when I was a young lawyer, of meeting Rosa Parks.

352
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And Ms. Parks used to come back to Montgomery every now and then,

353
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and she would get together with two of her dearest friends,

354
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
these older women,

355
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Johnnie Carr who was the organizer

356
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
of the Montgomery bus boycott --

357
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
amazing African-American woman --

358
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and Virginia Durr, a white woman,

359
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
whose husband, Clifford Durr, represented Dr. King.

360
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And these women would get together and just talk.

361
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
And every now and then Ms. Carr would call me,

362
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
and she'd say, "Bryan, Ms. Parks is coming to town. We're going to get together and talk.

363
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Do you want to come over and listen?"

364
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
And I'd say, "Yes, Ma'am, I do."

365
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And she'd say, "Well what are you going to do when you get here?"

366
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
I said, "I'm going to listen."

367
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
And I'd go over there and I would, I would just listen.

368
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
It would be so energizing and so empowering.

369
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And one time I was over there listening to these women talk,

370
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and after a couple of hours Ms. Parks turned to me

371
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and she said, "Now Bryan, tell me what the Equal Justice Initiative is.

372
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Tell me what you're trying to do."

373
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And I began giving her my rap.

374
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
I said, "Well we're trying to challenge injustice.

375
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
We're trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted.

376
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
We're trying to confront bias and discrimination

377
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
in the administration of criminal justice.

378
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
We're trying to end life without parole sentences for children.

379
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
We're trying to do something about the death penalty.

380
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
We're trying to reduce the prison population.

381
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
We're trying to end mass incarceration."

382
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
I gave her my whole rap, and when I finished she looked at me

383
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
and she said, "Mmm mmm mmm."

384
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
She said, "That's going to make you tired, tired, tired."

385
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
(Laughter)

386
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And that's when Ms. Carr leaned forward, she put her finger in my face,

387
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
she said, "That's why you've got to be brave, brave, brave."

388
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And I actually believe that the TED community

389
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
needs to be more courageous.

390
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
We need to find ways

391
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
to embrace these challenges,

392
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
these problems, the suffering.

393
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
Because ultimately, our humanity depends

394
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
on everyone's humanity.

395
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
I've learned very simple things doing the work that I do.

396
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
It's just taught me very simple things.

397
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
I've come to understand and to believe

398
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
that each of us

399
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
is more than the worst thing we've ever done.

400
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
I believe that for every person on the planet.

401
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
I think if somebody tells a lie, they're not just a liar.

402
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
I think if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to them,

403
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
they're not just a thief.

404
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
I think even if you kill someone, you're not just a killer.

405
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
And because of that there's this basic human dignity

406
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
that must be respected by law.

407
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
I also believe

408
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
that in many parts of this country,

409
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
and certainly in many parts of this globe,

410
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
that the opposite of poverty is not wealth.

411
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
I don't believe that.

412
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
I actually think, in too many places,

413
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
the opposite of poverty is justice.

414
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
And finally, I believe

415
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
that, despite the fact that it is so dramatic

416
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
and so beautiful and so inspiring

417
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
and so stimulating,

418
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
we will ultimately not be judged by our technology,

419
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
we won't be judged by our design,

420
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
we won't be judged by our intellect and reason.

421
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
Ultimately, you judge the character of a society,

422
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged,

423
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
but by how they treat the poor,

424
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
the condemned, the incarcerated.

425
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
Because it's in that nexus

426
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
that we actually begin to understand truly profound things

427
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
about who we are.

428
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
I sometimes get out of balance. I'll end with this story.

429
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
I sometimes push too hard.

430
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
I do get tired, as we all do.

431
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
Sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking

432
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
in ways that are important.

433
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
And I've been representing these kids

434
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
who have been sentenced to do these very harsh sentences.

435
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
And I go to the jail and I see my client who's 13 and 14,

436
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
and he's been certified to stand trial as an adult.

437
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
I start thinking, well, how did that happen?

438
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
How can a judge turn you into something

439
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
that you're not?

440
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
And the judge has certified him as an adult, but I see this kid.

441
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
And I was up too late one night and I starting thinking,

442
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
well gosh, if the judge can turn you into something that you're not,

443
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
the judge must have magic power.

444
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
Yeah, Bryan, the judge has some magic power.

445
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
You should ask for some of that.

446
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
And because I was up too late, wasn't thinking real straight,

447
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
I started working on a motion.

448
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
And I had a client who was 14 years old, a young, poor black kid.

449
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
And I started working on this motion,

450
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
and the head of the motion was: "Motion to try my poor,

451
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
14-year-old black male client

452
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
like a privileged, white 75-year-old

453
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
corporate executive."

454
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
(Applause)

455
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
And I put in my motion

456
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:17,000
that there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct.

457
0:18:17.26,000 --> 0:18:19,000
There was a crazy line in there about how there's no conduct in this county,

458
0:18:19.26,000 --> 0:18:21,000
it's all misconduct.

459
0:18:21.26,000 --> 0:18:24,000
And the next morning, I woke up and I thought, now did I dream that crazy motion,

460
0:18:24.26,000 --> 0:18:26,000
or did I actually write it?

461
0:18:26.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
And to my horror, not only had I written it,

462
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
but I had sent it to court.

463
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:18:33,000
(Applause)

464
0:18:33.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
A couple months went by,

465
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
and I had just forgotten all about it.

466
0:18:38.26,000 --> 0:18:4,000
And I finally decided,

467
0:18:40.26,000 --> 0:18:42,000
oh gosh, I've got to go to the court and do this crazy case.

468
0:18:42.26,000 --> 0:18:44,000
And I got into my car

469
0:18:44.26,000 --> 0:18:46,000
and I was feeling really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed.

470
0:18:46.26,000 --> 0:18:48,000
And I got in my car and I went to this courthouse.

471
0:18:48.26,000 --> 0:18:51,000
And I was thinking, this is going to be so difficult, so painful.

472
0:18:51.26,000 --> 0:18:54,000
And I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the courthouse.

473
0:18:54.26,000 --> 0:18:56,000
And as I was walking up the steps of this courthouse,

474
0:18:56.26,000 --> 0:18:59,000
there was an older black man who was the janitor in this courthouse.

475
0:18:59.26,000 --> 0:19:01,000
When this man saw me, he came over to me

476
0:19:01.26,000 --> 0:19:03,000
and he said, "Who are you?"

477
0:19:03.26,000 --> 0:19:06,000
I said, "I'm a lawyer." He said, "You're a lawyer?" I said, "Yes, sir."

478
0:19:06.26,000 --> 0:19:08,000
And this man came over to me

479
0:19:08.26,000 --> 0:19:1,000
and he hugged me.

480
0:19:10.26,000 --> 0:19:12,000
And he whispered in my ear.

481
0:19:12.26,000 --> 0:19:14,000
He said, "I'm so proud of you."

482
0:19:14.26,000 --> 0:19:16,000
And I have to tell you,

483
0:19:16.26,000 --> 0:19:18,000
it was energizing.

484
0:19:18.26,000 --> 0:19:2,000
It connected deeply with something in me

485
0:19:20.26,000 --> 0:19:22,000
about identity,

486
0:19:22.26,000 --> 0:19:25,000
about the capacity of every person to contribute

487
0:19:25.26,000 --> 0:19:27,000
to a community, to a perspective that is hopeful.

488
0:19:27.26,000 --> 0:19:29,000
Well I went into the courtroom.

489
0:19:29.26,000 --> 0:19:31,000
And as soon as I walked inside, the judge saw me coming in.

490
0:19:31.26,000 --> 0:19:34,000
He said, "Mr. Stevenson, did you write this crazy motion?"

491
0:19:34.26,000 --> 0:19:36,000
I said, "Yes, sir. I did." And we started arguing.

492
0:19:36.26,000 --> 0:19:38,000
And people started coming in because they were just outraged.

493
0:19:38.26,000 --> 0:19:4,000
I had written these crazy things.

494
0:19:40.26,000 --> 0:19:42,000
And police officers were coming in

495
0:19:42.26,000 --> 0:19:44,000
and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers.

496
0:19:44.26,000 --> 0:19:46,000
And before I knew it, the courtroom was filled with people

497
0:19:46.26,000 --> 0:19:48,000
angry that we were talking about race,

498
0:19:48.26,000 --> 0:19:5,000
that we were talking about poverty,

499
0:19:50.26,000 --> 0:19:52,000
that we were talking about inequality.

500
0:19:52.26,000 --> 0:19:55,000
And out of the corner of my eye, I could see this janitor pacing back and forth.

501
0:19:55.26,000 --> 0:19:57,000
And he kept looking through the window, and he could hear all of this holler.

502
0:19:57.26,000 --> 0:19:59,000
He kept pacing back and forth.

503
0:19:59.26,000 --> 0:20:02,000
And finally, this older black man with this very worried look on his face

504
0:20:02.26,000 --> 0:20:05,000
came into the courtroom and sat down behind me,

505
0:20:05.26,000 --> 0:20:07,000
almost at counsel table.

506
0:20:07.26,000 --> 0:20:09,000
About 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break.

507
0:20:09.26,000 --> 0:20:12,000
And during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended

508
0:20:12.26,000 --> 0:20:14,000
that the janitor had come into court.

509
0:20:14.26,000 --> 0:20:16,000
And this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man.

510
0:20:16.26,000 --> 0:20:19,000
He said, "Jimmy, what are you doing in this courtroom?"

511
0:20:19.26,000 --> 0:20:21,000
And this older black man stood up

512
0:20:21.26,000 --> 0:20:23,000
and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me

513
0:20:23.26,000 --> 0:20:26,000
and he said, "I came into this courtroom

514
0:20:26.26,000 --> 0:20:28,000
to tell this young man,

515
0:20:28.26,000 --> 0:20:31,000
keep your eyes on the prize, hold on."

516
0:20:31.26,000 --> 0:20:33,000
I've come to TED

517
0:20:33.26,000 --> 0:20:35,000
because I believe that many of you understand

518
0:20:35.26,000 --> 0:20:37,000
that the moral arc of the universe is long,

519
0:20:37.26,000 --> 0:20:39,000
but it bends toward justice.

520
0:20:39.26,000 --> 0:20:42,000
That we cannot be full evolved human beings

521
0:20:42.26,000 --> 0:20:45,000
until we care about human rights and basic dignity.

522
0:20:45.26,000 --> 0:20:47,000
That all of our survival

523
0:20:47.26,000 --> 0:20:49,000
is tied to the survival of everyone.

524
0:20:49.26,000 --> 0:20:51,000
That our visions of technology and design

525
0:20:51.26,000 --> 0:20:53,000
and entertainment and creativity

526
0:20:53.26,000 --> 0:20:55,000
have to be married with visions

527
0:20:55.26,000 --> 0:20:58,000
of humanity, compassion and justice.

528
0:20:58.26,000 --> 0:21:,000
And more than anything,

529
0:21:00.26,000 --> 0:21:02,000
for those of you who share that,

530
0:21:02.26,000 --> 0:21:04,000
I've simply come to tell you

531
0:21:04.26,000 --> 0:21:06,000
to keep your eyes on the prize, hold on.

532
0:21:06.26,000 --> 0:21:08,000
Thank you very much.

533
0:21:08.26,000 --> 0:21:29,000
(Applause)

534
0:21:29.26,000 --> 0:21:31,000
Chris Anderson: So you heard and saw

535
0:21:31.26,000 --> 0:21:34,000
an obvious desire by this audience, this community,

536
0:21:34.26,000 --> 0:21:37,000
to help you on your way and to do something on this issue.

537
0:21:37.26,000 --> 0:21:39,000
Other than writing a check,

538
0:21:39.26,000 --> 0:21:42,000
what could we do?

539
0:21:42.26,000 --> 0:21:44,000
BS: Well there are opportunities all around us.

540
0:21:44.26,000 --> 0:21:46,000
If you live in the state of California, for example,

541
0:21:46.26,000 --> 0:21:48,000
there's a referendum coming up this spring

542
0:21:48.26,000 --> 0:21:5,000
where actually there's going to be an effort

543
0:21:50.26,000 --> 0:21:53,000
to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment.

544
0:21:53.26,000 --> 0:21:55,000
For example, here in California

545
0:21:55.26,000 --> 0:21:57,000
we're going to spend one billion dollars

546
0:21:57.26,000 --> 0:21:59,000
on the death penalty in the next five years --

547
0:21:59.26,000 --> 0:22:02,000
one billion dollars.

548
0:22:02.26,000 --> 0:22:04,000
And yet, 46 percent of all homicide cases

549
0:22:04.26,000 --> 0:22:06,000
don't result in arrest.

550
0:22:06.26,000 --> 0:22:08,000
56 percent of all rape cases don't result.

551
0:22:08.26,000 --> 0:22:1,000
So there's an opportunity to change that.

552
0:22:10.26,000 --> 0:22:12,000
And this referendum would propose having those dollars

553
0:22:12.26,000 --> 0:22:15,000
go to law enforcement and safety.

554
0:22:15.26,000 --> 0:22:17,000
And I think that opportunity exists all around us.

555
0:22:17.26,000 --> 0:22:19,000
CA: There's been this huge decline

556
0:22:19.26,000 --> 0:22:22,000
in crime in America over the last three decades.

557
0:22:22.26,000 --> 0:22:25,000
And part of the narrative of that

558
0:22:25.26,000 --> 0:22:28,000
is sometimes that it's about increased incarceration rates.

559
0:22:28.26,000 --> 0:22:3,000
What would you say to someone who believed that?

560
0:22:30.26,000 --> 0:22:32,000
BS: Well actually the violent crime rate

561
0:22:32.26,000 --> 0:22:34,000
has remained relatively stable.

562
0:22:34.26,000 --> 0:22:36,000
The great increase in mass incarceration in this country

563
0:22:36.26,000 --> 0:22:39,000
wasn't really in violent crime categories.

564
0:22:39.26,000 --> 0:22:41,000
It was this misguided war on drugs.

565
0:22:41.26,000 --> 0:22:43,000
That's where the dramatic increases have come

566
0:22:43.26,000 --> 0:22:46,000
in our prison population.

567
0:22:46.26,000 --> 0:22:49,000
And we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment.

568
0:22:49.26,000 --> 0:22:51,000
And so we have three strikes laws

569
0:22:51.26,000 --> 0:22:53,000
that put people in prison forever

570
0:22:53.26,000 --> 0:22:56,000
for stealing a bicycle, for low-level property crimes,

571
0:22:56.26,000 --> 0:22:58,000
rather than making them give those resources back

572
0:22:58.26,000 --> 0:23:,000
to the people who they victimized.

573
0:23:00.26,000 --> 0:23:02,000
I believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime,

574
0:23:02.26,000 --> 0:23:04,000
not do less.

575
0:23:04.26,000 --> 0:23:06,000
And I think our current punishment philosophy

576
0:23:06.26,000 --> 0:23:08,000
does nothing for no one.

577
0:23:08.26,000 --> 0:23:1,000
And I think that's the orientation that we have to change.

578
0:23:10.26,000 --> 0:23:12,000
(Applause)

579
0:23:12.26,000 --> 0:23:15,000
CA: Bryan, you've struck a massive chord here.

580
0:23:15.26,000 --> 0:23:17,000
You're an inspiring person.

581
0:23:17.26,000 --> 0:23:19,000
Thank you so much for coming to TED. Thank you.

582
0:23:19.26,000 --> 0:23:34,000
(Applause)

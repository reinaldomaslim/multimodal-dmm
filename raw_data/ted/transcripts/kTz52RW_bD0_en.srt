1
0:00:12.843,000 --> 0:00:16,000
What if I told you that time has a race,

2
0:00:17.622,000 --> 0:00:19,000
a race in the contemporary way that we understand race

3
0:00:20.406,000 --> 0:00:21,000
in the United States?

4
0:00:21.98,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Typically, we talk about race in terms of black and white issues.

5
0:00:27.366,000 --> 0:00:29,000
In the African-American communities from which I come,

6
0:00:30.246,000 --> 0:00:32,000
we have a long-standing multi-generational joke

7
0:00:33.062,000 --> 0:00:35,000
about what we call "CP time,"

8
0:00:35.623,000 --> 0:00:36,000
or "colored people's time."

9
0:00:38.079,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Now, we no longer refer to African-Americans as "colored,"

10
0:00:41.384,000 --> 0:00:42,000
but this long-standing joke

11
0:00:43.17,000 --> 0:00:45,000
about our perpetual lateness to church,

12
0:00:45.567,000 --> 0:00:46,000
to cookouts, to family events

13
0:00:47.273,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and even to our own funerals, remains.

14
0:00:50.936,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I personally am a stickler for time.

15
0:00:53.774,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It's almost as if my mother, when I was growing up, said,

16
0:00:56.486,000 --> 0:00:57,000
"We will not be those black people."

17
0:00:58.436,000 --> 0:01:,000
So we typically arrive to events 30 minutes early.

18
0:01:02.018,000 --> 0:01:06,000
But today, I want to talk to you more about the political nature of time,

19
0:01:06.919,000 --> 0:01:07,000
for if time had a race,

20
0:01:08.862,000 --> 0:01:09,000
it would be white.

21
0:01:10.883,000 --> 0:01:12,000
White people own time.

22
0:01:14.141,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I know, I know.

23
0:01:15.883,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Making such "incendiary statements" makes us uncomfortable:

24
0:01:20.434,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Haven't we moved past the point where race really matters?

25
0:01:24.575,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Isn't race a heavy-handed concept?

26
0:01:27.79,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Shouldn't we go ahead with our enlightened, progressive selves

27
0:01:30.861,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and relegate useless concepts like race to the dustbins of history?

28
0:01:34.95,000 --> 0:01:38,000
How will we ever get over racism if we keep on talking about race?

29
0:01:41.599,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Perhaps we should lock up our concepts of race in a time capsule,

30
0:01:45.207,000 --> 0:01:47,000
bury them and dig them up in a thousand years,

31
0:01:48.152,000 --> 0:01:5,000
peer at them with the clearly more enlightened,

32
0:01:50.544,000 --> 0:01:52,000
raceless versions of ourselves that belong to the future.

33
0:01:54.317,000 --> 0:01:55,000
But you see there,

34
0:01:55.635,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that desire to mitigate the impact of race and racism shows up

35
0:02:00.25,000 --> 0:02:02,000
in how we attempt to manage time,

36
0:02:02.588,000 --> 0:02:04,000
in the ways we narrate history,

37
0:02:04.672,000 --> 0:02:07,000
in the ways we attempt to shove the negative truths of the present

38
0:02:07.842,000 --> 0:02:08,000
into the past,

39
0:02:09.024,000 --> 0:02:12,000
in the ways we attempt to argue that the future that we hope for

40
0:02:12.104,000 --> 0:02:14,000
is the present in which we're currently living.

41
0:02:15.209,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Now, when Barack Obama became President of the US in 2008,

42
0:02:18.375,000 --> 0:02:2,000
many Americans declared that we were post-racial.

43
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I'm from the academy

44
0:02:23.473,000 --> 0:02:25,000
where we're enamored with being post-everything.

45
0:02:26.304,000 --> 0:02:3,000
We're postmodern, we're post-structural, we're post-feminist.

46
0:02:31.193,000 --> 0:02:33,000
"Post" has become a simple academic appendage

47
0:02:33.649,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that we apply to a range of terms

48
0:02:35.613,000 --> 0:02:36,000
to mark the way we were.

49
0:02:38.155,000 --> 0:02:42,000
But prefixes alone don't have the power to make race and racism

50
0:02:42.331,000 --> 0:02:43,000
a thing of the past.

51
0:02:44.115,000 --> 0:02:45,000
The US was never "pre-race."

52
0:02:46.759,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So to claim that we're post-race when we have yet to grapple with the impact

53
0:02:50.674,000 --> 0:02:52,000
of race on black people, Latinos or the indigenous

54
0:02:53.596,000 --> 0:02:54,000
is disingenuous.

55
0:02:55.902,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Just about the moment we were preparing to celebrate

56
0:02:58.795,000 --> 0:02:59,000
our post-racial future,

57
0:03:00.19,000 --> 0:03:02,000
our political conditions became the most racial they've been

58
0:03:03.169,000 --> 0:03:04,000
in the last 50 years.

59
0:03:05.249,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So today, I want to offer to you three observations,

60
0:03:08.806,000 --> 0:03:11,000
about the past, the present and the future of time,

61
0:03:12.216,000 --> 0:03:16,000
as it relates to the combating of racism and white dominance.

62
0:03:16.817,000 --> 0:03:17,000
First: the past.

63
0:03:19.622,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Time has a history,

64
0:03:21.533,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and so do black people.

65
0:03:23.524,000 --> 0:03:25,000
But we treat time as though it is timeless,

66
0:03:26.214,000 --> 0:03:28,000
as though it has always been this way,

67
0:03:28.642,000 --> 0:03:3,000
as though it doesn't have a political history

68
0:03:30.955,000 --> 0:03:32,000
bound up with the plunder of indigenous lands,

69
0:03:33.189,000 --> 0:03:34,000
the genocide of indigenous people

70
0:03:35.162,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and the stealing of Africans from their homeland.

71
0:03:38.802,000 --> 0:03:39,000
When white male European philosophers

72
0:03:40.702,000 --> 0:03:45,000
first thought to conceptualize time and history, one famously declared,

73
0:03:45.726,000 --> 0:03:48,000
"[Africa] is no historical part of the World."

74
0:03:50.29,000 --> 0:03:51,000
He was essentially saying

75
0:03:51.888,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that Africans were people outside of history

76
0:03:54.279,000 --> 0:03:56,000
who had had no impact on time

77
0:03:56.789,000 --> 0:03:57,000
or the march of progress.

78
0:03:58.923,000 --> 0:04:02,000
This idea, that black people have had no impact on history,

79
0:04:03.392,000 --> 0:04:06,000
is one of the foundational ideas of white supremacy.

80
0:04:06.888,000 --> 0:04:1,000
It's the reason that Carter G. Woodson created "Negro History Week" in 1926.

81
0:04:11.746,000 --> 0:04:14,000
It's the reason that we continue to celebrate Black History Month

82
0:04:14.885,000 --> 0:04:16,000
in the US every February.

83
0:04:18.6,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Now, we also see this idea

84
0:04:20.974,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that black people are people either alternately outside of the bounds of time

85
0:04:25.521,000 --> 0:04:26,000
or stuck in the past,

86
0:04:27.053,000 --> 0:04:29,000
in a scenario where, much as I'm doing right now,

87
0:04:29.952,000 --> 0:04:33,000
a black person stands up and insists that racism still matters,

88
0:04:34.102,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and a person, usually white,

89
0:04:36.452,000 --> 0:04:37,000
says to them,

90
0:04:37.642,000 --> 0:04:38,000
"Why are you stuck in the past?

91
0:04:39.602,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Why can't you move on?

92
0:04:41.907,000 --> 0:04:42,000
We have a black president.

93
0:04:43.835,000 --> 0:04:44,000
We're past all that."

94
0:04:46.571,000 --> 0:04:48,000
William Faulkner famously said,

95
0:04:48.804,000 --> 0:04:5,000
"The past is never dead.

96
0:04:50.923,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It's not even past."

97
0:04:53.816,000 --> 0:04:56,000
But my good friend Professor Kristie Dotson says,

98
0:04:56.929,000 --> 0:04:59,000
"Our memory is longer than our lifespan."

99
0:05:01.024,000 --> 0:05:03,000
We carry, all of us,

100
0:05:03.35,000 --> 0:05:06,000
family and communal hopes and dreams with us.

101
0:05:08.9,000 --> 0:05:12,000
We don't have the luxury of letting go of the past.

102
0:05:13.806,000 --> 0:05:14,000
But sometimes,

103
0:05:15.749,000 --> 0:05:16,000
our political conditions are so troubling

104
0:05:17.758,000 --> 0:05:19,000
that we don't know if we're living in the past

105
0:05:19.971,000 --> 0:05:21,000
or we're living in the present.

106
0:05:22.088,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Take, for instance, when Black Lives Matter protesters

107
0:05:24.787,000 --> 0:05:28,000
go out to protest unjust killings of black citizens by police,

108
0:05:28.832,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and the pictures that emerge from the protest

109
0:05:31.957,000 --> 0:05:33,000
look like they could have been taken 50 years ago.

110
0:05:35.615,000 --> 0:05:37,000
The past won't let us go.

111
0:05:38.516,000 --> 0:05:41,000
But still, let us press our way into the present.

112
0:05:43.357,000 --> 0:05:45,000
At present, I would argue

113
0:05:45.813,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that the racial struggles we are experiencing

114
0:05:48.174,000 --> 0:05:51,000
are clashes over time and space.

115
0:05:52.005,000 --> 0:05:53,000
What do I mean?

116
0:05:54.12,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Well, I've already told you that white people own time.

117
0:05:57.662,000 --> 0:06:,000
Those in power dictate the pace of the workday.

118
0:06:01.413,000 --> 0:06:04,000
They dictate how much money our time is actually worth.

119
0:06:05.793,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And Professor George Lipsitz argues

120
0:06:07.959,000 --> 0:06:1,000
that white people even dictate the pace of social inclusion.

121
0:06:11.894,000 --> 0:06:13,000
They dictate how long it will actually take

122
0:06:14.674,000 --> 0:06:17,000
for minority groups to receive the rights that they have been fighting for.

123
0:06:19.135,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Let me loop back to the past quickly to give you an example.

124
0:06:22.921,000 --> 0:06:24,000
If you think about the Civil Rights Movement

125
0:06:25.088,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and the cries of its leaders for "Freedom Now,"

126
0:06:28.045,000 --> 0:06:31,000
they were challenging the slow pace of white social inclusion.

127
0:06:32.137,000 --> 0:06:36,000
By 1965, the year the Voting Rights Act was passed,

128
0:06:36.189,000 --> 0:06:37,000
there had been a full 100 years

129
0:06:37.843,000 --> 0:06:38,000
between the end of the Civil War

130
0:06:39.71,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and the conferral of voting rights on African-American communities.

131
0:06:42.88,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Despite the urgency of a war,

132
0:06:45.119,000 --> 0:06:49,000
it still took a full 100 years for actual social inclusion to occur.

133
0:06:50.318,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Since 2012,

134
0:06:52.277,000 --> 0:06:55,000
conservative state legislatures across the US have ramped up attempts

135
0:06:55.978,000 --> 0:06:57,000
to roll back African-American voting rights

136
0:06:58.191,000 --> 0:07:,000
by passing restrictive voter ID laws

137
0:07:00.69,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and curtailing early voting opportunities.

138
0:07:03.672,000 --> 0:07:06,000
This past July, a federal court struck down North Carolina's voter ID law

139
0:07:07.646,000 --> 0:07:12,000
saying it "... targeted African-Americans with surgical precision."

140
0:07:14.425,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Restricting African-American inclusion in the body politic

141
0:07:17.861,000 --> 0:07:21,000
is a primary way that we attempt to manage and control people

142
0:07:22.877,000 --> 0:07:24,000
by managing and controlling time.

143
0:07:26.008,000 --> 0:07:29,000
But another place that we see these time-space clashes

144
0:07:29.6,000 --> 0:07:32,000
is in gentrifying cities like Atlanta, Brooklyn,

145
0:07:33.092,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Philadelphia, New Orleans and Washington, DC --

146
0:07:36.583,000 --> 0:07:39,000
places that have had black populations for generations.

147
0:07:40.231,000 --> 0:07:43,000
But now, in the name of urban renewal and progress,

148
0:07:43.547,000 --> 0:07:44,000
these communities are pushed out,

149
0:07:45.558,000 --> 0:07:47,000
in service of bringing them into the 21st century.

150
0:07:48.724,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Professor Sharon Holland asked:

151
0:07:51.996,000 --> 0:07:54,000
What happens when a person who exists in time

152
0:07:55.687,000 --> 0:07:58,000
meets someone who only occupies space?

153
0:08:00.717,000 --> 0:08:01,000
These racial struggles

154
0:08:02.336,000 --> 0:08:05,000
are battles over those who are perceived to be space-takers

155
0:08:05.94,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and those who are perceived to be world-makers.

156
0:08:09.861,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Those who control the flow and thrust of history

157
0:08:12.874,000 --> 0:08:15,000
are considered world-makers who own and master time.

158
0:08:17.015,000 --> 0:08:19,000
In other words: white people.

159
0:08:20.09,000 --> 0:08:24,000
But when Hegel famously said that Africa was no historical part of the world,

160
0:08:24.219,000 --> 0:08:26,000
he implied that it was merely a voluminous land mass

161
0:08:26.748,000 --> 0:08:28,000
taking up space at the bottom of the globe.

162
0:08:29.34,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Africans were space-takers.

163
0:08:32.348,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So today, white people continue to control the flow and thrust of history,

164
0:08:36.655,000 --> 0:08:4,000
while too often treating black people as though we are merely taking up space

165
0:08:41.222,000 --> 0:08:42,000
to which we are not entitled.

166
0:08:43.53,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Time and the march of progress is used to justify

167
0:08:47.501,000 --> 0:08:51,000
a stunning degree of violence towards our most vulnerable populations,

168
0:08:51.94,000 --> 0:08:56,000
who, being perceived as space-takers rather than world-makers,

169
0:08:57.039,000 --> 0:08:59,000
are moved out of the places where they live,

170
0:08:59.38,000 --> 0:09:02,000
in service of bringing them into the 21st century.

171
0:09:03.688,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Shortened life span according to zip code is just one example of the ways

172
0:09:07.842,000 --> 0:09:09,000
that time and space cohere in an unjust manner

173
0:09:10.593,000 --> 0:09:11,000
in the lives of black people.

174
0:09:12.793,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Children who are born in New Orleans zip code 70124,

175
0:09:17.338,000 --> 0:09:18,000
which is 93 percent white,

176
0:09:19.29,000 --> 0:09:22,000
can expect to live a full 25 years longer

177
0:09:22.543,000 --> 0:09:26,000
than children born in New Orleans zip code 70112,

178
0:09:26.822,000 --> 0:09:27,000
which is 60 percent black.

179
0:09:29.856,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Children born in Washington, DC's wealthy Maryland suburbs

180
0:09:34.004,000 --> 0:09:37,000
can expect to live a full 20 years longer

181
0:09:37.134,000 --> 0:09:4,000
than children born in its downtown neighborhoods.

182
0:09:41.492,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Ta-Nehisi Coates argues

183
0:09:44.2,000 --> 0:09:49,000
that, "The defining feature of being drafted into the Black race

184
0:09:49.864,000 --> 0:09:51,000
is the inescapable robbery of time."

185
0:09:53.518,000 --> 0:09:54,000
We experience time discrimination,

186
0:09:55.334,000 --> 0:09:56,000
he tells us,

187
0:09:56.585,000 --> 0:09:57,000
not just as structural,

188
0:09:58.089,000 --> 0:09:59,000
but as personal:

189
0:09:59.564,000 --> 0:10:,000
in lost moments of joy,

190
0:10:01.412,000 --> 0:10:03,000
lost moments of connection,

191
0:10:03.652,000 --> 0:10:05,000
lost quality of time with loved ones

192
0:10:06.173,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and lost years of healthy quality of life.

193
0:10:11.829,000 --> 0:10:14,000
In the future, do you see black people?

194
0:10:16.344,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Do black people have a future?

195
0:10:20.209,000 --> 0:10:22,000
What if you belong to the very race of people

196
0:10:22.463,000 --> 0:10:24,000
who have always been pitted against time?

197
0:10:26.145,000 --> 0:10:3,000
What if your group is the group for whom a future was never imagined?

198
0:10:31.911,000 --> 0:10:32,000
These time-space clashes --

199
0:10:33.631,000 --> 0:10:35,000
between protesters and police,

200
0:10:36.196,000 --> 0:10:38,000
between gentrifiers and residents --

201
0:10:38.59,000 --> 0:10:39,000
don't paint a very pretty picture

202
0:10:40.611,000 --> 0:10:43,000
of what America hopes for black people's future.

203
0:10:44.21,000 --> 0:10:45,000
If the present is any indicator,

204
0:10:45.948,000 --> 0:10:47,000
our children will be under-educated,

205
0:10:48.023,000 --> 0:10:5,000
health maladies will take their toll

206
0:10:50.405,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and housing will continue to be unaffordable.

207
0:10:53.912,000 --> 0:10:56,000
So if we're really ready to talk about the future,

208
0:10:56.958,000 --> 0:10:59,000
perhaps we should begin by admitting that we're out of time.

209
0:11:01.814,000 --> 0:11:03,000
We black people have always been out of time.

210
0:11:05.085,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Time does not belong to us.

211
0:11:07.233,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Our lives are lives of perpetual urgency.

212
0:11:10.453,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Time is used to displace us,

213
0:11:13.009,000 --> 0:11:16,000
or conversely, we are urged into complacency

214
0:11:16.043,000 --> 0:11:19,000
through endless calls to just be patient.

215
0:11:19.805,000 --> 0:11:21,000
But if past is prologue,

216
0:11:22.281,000 --> 0:11:25,000
let us seize upon the ways in which we're always out of time anyway

217
0:11:25.558,000 --> 0:11:26,000
to demand with urgency

218
0:11:27.23,000 --> 0:11:28,000
freedom now.

219
0:11:29.587,000 --> 0:11:31,000
I believe the future is what we make it.

220
0:11:32.466,000 --> 0:11:36,000
But first, we have to decide that time belongs to all of us.

221
0:11:37.637,000 --> 0:11:39,000
No, we don't all get equal time,

222
0:11:40.364,000 --> 0:11:44,000
but we can decide that the time we do get is just and free.

223
0:11:44.406,000 --> 0:11:46,000
We can stop making your zip code the primary determinant

224
0:11:47.075,000 --> 0:11:48,000
of your lifespan.

225
0:11:48.844,000 --> 0:11:5,000
We can stop stealing learning time from black children

226
0:11:51.588,000 --> 0:11:54,000
through excessive use of suspensions and expulsions.

227
0:11:54.668,000 --> 0:11:56,000
We can stop stealing time from black people

228
0:11:56.761,000 --> 0:11:59,000
through long periods of incarceration for nonviolent crimes.

229
0:12:00.767,000 --> 0:12:02,000
The police can stop stealing time and black lives

230
0:12:03.787,000 --> 0:12:05,000
through use of excessive force.

231
0:12:06.997,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I believe the future is what we make it.

232
0:12:10.244,000 --> 0:12:14,000
But we can't get there on colored people's time

233
0:12:14.283,000 --> 0:12:15,000
or white time

234
0:12:16.235,000 --> 0:12:17,000
or your time

235
0:12:18.071,000 --> 0:12:19,000
or even my time.

236
0:12:20.801,000 --> 0:12:21,000
It's our time.

237
0:12:22.883,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Ours.

238
0:12:24.179,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Thank you.

239
0:12:25.36,000 --> 0:12:28,000
(Applause)

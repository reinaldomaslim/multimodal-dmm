1
0:00:13,000 --> 0:00:19,000
In 2009, in August, my office weathered two major scandals.

2
0:00:19.8,000 --> 0:00:24,000
The first was the arrest, trying and conviction

3
0:00:24.88,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and subsequent incarceration of Detroit's very popular mayor.

4
0:00:29.88,000 --> 0:00:35,000
The second caused the Detroit police department crime lab to be closed.

5
0:00:36.8,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I thought nothing else could go wrong.

6
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And then the phone rang.

7
0:00:42.28,000 --> 0:00:43,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:43.68,000 --> 0:00:46,000
It was the deputy chief of my special victim's unit,

9
0:00:47.4,000 --> 0:00:5,000
who was breathless on the other end of the line.

10
0:00:50.44,000 --> 0:00:55,000
He said, "Boss, you are never going to believe what I just saw."

11
0:00:57,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I had a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach,

12
0:00:59.76,000 --> 0:01:01,000
because I knew instinctively

13
0:01:02.56,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that Detroit was getting ready to suffer its third major scandal,

14
0:01:07.4,000 --> 0:01:09,000
in just over one year.

15
0:01:11.28,000 --> 0:01:16,000
He told me that he had just visited what he thought was an abandoned warehouse

16
0:01:16.319,000 --> 0:01:18,000
where the Detroit police department was storing evidence.

17
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Inside were 11,341 abandoned,

18
0:01:26.84,000 --> 0:01:28,000
untested rape kits.

19
0:01:29.44,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Some of them went back to the 1980s.

20
0:01:33.28,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And some of them now are over 40 years old.

21
0:01:37.96,000 --> 0:01:41,000
These kits were spilling out of large, black garbage bags

22
0:01:42.48,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and empty oil drums.

23
0:01:45.44,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Each kit represented a victim,

24
0:01:48.2,000 --> 0:01:49,000
mostly a female,

25
0:01:49.68,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that had suffered a violent sexual assault.

26
0:01:53.88,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Each of them voluntarily endured an hours-long rape kit process,

27
0:02:00.44,000 --> 0:02:04,000
with the hopes that as a result of that they would find their perpetrator.

28
0:02:05.96,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And unbeknownst to all of them, all 11,341,

29
0:02:11.68,000 --> 0:02:12,000
those kits were never tested.

30
0:02:15.48,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I cannot even begin to describe -- oh!

31
0:02:18.24,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And by the way, before I move on,

32
0:02:20.12,000 --> 0:02:22,000
in the interim of those 40 years,

33
0:02:22.44,000 --> 0:02:26,000
those perpetrators were allowed to continue to offend with impunity.

34
0:02:28.64,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I cannot tell you or describe to you how outraged, mad and angry I was.

35
0:02:36.52,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I myself was a victim of sexual assault,

36
0:02:39.32,000 --> 0:02:41,000
back many decades ago, when I was in law school.

37
0:02:42.72,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I also am the mother of three girls, a 21-year-old and nine-year-old twins.

38
0:02:49.4,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I was even more horrified to learn -- if I could be more horrified --

39
0:02:54.2,000 --> 0:02:55,000
that the oldest of those kits --

40
0:02:57.24,000 --> 0:03:,000
one of the oldest of those kits -- belonged to an eight-year-old girl.

41
0:03:01.4,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I'm going to tell you her story, but I'm going to call her Natasha.

42
0:03:05.84,000 --> 0:03:11,000
On January 2, 1990, Natasha was at home and a man knocked on her door.

43
0:03:12.2,000 --> 0:03:14,000
This man was familiar with her neighborhood

44
0:03:14.44,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and was familiar with the comings and goings of her family,

45
0:03:17.52,000 --> 0:03:18,000
but Natasha did not know him.

46
0:03:20.72,000 --> 0:03:24,000
He told her that her grandmother, the only mother that she had ever known,

47
0:03:25.64,000 --> 0:03:26,000
had been in a terrible accident

48
0:03:27.56,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and was laying on a couch in his house, calling for her.

49
0:03:31.72,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Terrified that Natasha was going to lose her grandmother, she went with him.

50
0:03:36.72,000 --> 0:03:39,000
But of course, we all know her grandmother was not there.

51
0:03:39.8,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Once he had isolated Natasha, who was eight years old,

52
0:03:43.76,000 --> 0:03:45,000
he began to rape her violently.

53
0:03:46.32,000 --> 0:03:5,000
He raped her with his mouth, his fingers and his penis.

54
0:03:50.72,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And he even forced his penis into her mouth.

55
0:03:54.88,000 --> 0:03:57,000
When he was done, he ordered Natasha to get dressed,

56
0:03:58.04,000 --> 0:03:59,000
he got dressed himself,

57
0:03:59.72,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and he put a blindfold across her head.

58
0:04:02.4,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And walked her to a factory area on the edge of the neighborhood.

59
0:04:07.12,000 --> 0:04:09,000
He asked her if she knew -- he removed the blindfold,

60
0:04:09.68,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and asked her if she knew how to get home from there.

61
0:04:12.2,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And when she indicated that she did, he let her go and he walked off.

62
0:04:16.92,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Natasha's rape was reported immediately,

63
0:04:20.4,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and a rape kit was done.

64
0:04:22.96,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Now, the rape kit process terrifies and traumatizes adult women.

65
0:04:29.72,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Can you imagine what it was like for a little second-grader,

66
0:04:33.24,000 --> 0:04:36,000
who still wore pigtails and still believed in Santa Claus,

67
0:04:36.84,000 --> 0:04:37,000
going through this exam?

68
0:04:40.2,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Natasha's kit sat on the shelf in that abandoned warehouse

69
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
for 26 years.

70
0:04:49.52,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Pamela, 19 years old --

71
0:04:51.88,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I'll call her Pamela, that's not her real name --

72
0:04:54.24,000 --> 0:04:56,000
nineteen years old, was walking down the street

73
0:04:57,000 --> 0:04:59,000
after she had come from visiting her boyfriend.

74
0:04:59.76,000 --> 0:05:01,000
She was grabbed from behind,

75
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and she felt what she thought was a gun, in her side.

76
0:05:06.32,000 --> 0:05:08,000
She was taken to an abandoned house,

77
0:05:08.76,000 --> 0:05:11,000
to a bedroom in that house, that was filled with trash.

78
0:05:13.96,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Every time she tried to resist,

79
0:05:16.96,000 --> 0:05:19,000
he would hit her about the face and the head.

80
0:05:21.12,000 --> 0:05:24,000
He violently raped her on the floor of that bedroom

81
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that was filled with garbage.

82
0:05:29.64,000 --> 0:05:3,000
When he was done,

83
0:05:31.44,000 --> 0:05:32,000
he put on his clothes,

84
0:05:33.32,000 --> 0:05:36,000
he stole her money, and he just walked away.

85
0:05:39.6,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Pamela also reported her rape right away.

86
0:05:44.28,000 --> 0:05:45,000
She also had a rape kit done.

87
0:05:46.2,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And like Natasha's, her kit sat on the shelf for 15 years.

88
0:05:52.52,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Now, criminals, like people who raped Natasha and Pamela,

89
0:05:57.88,000 --> 0:05:59,000
often leave their DNA at a crime scene.

90
0:06:00.88,000 --> 0:06:04,000
But for a rape victim, their body is the crime scene.

91
0:06:06.76,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So many elect to go through this hours-long rape kit process

92
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:16,000
that requires every inch and orifice of a victim's body

93
0:06:16.88,000 --> 0:06:2,000
to be combed, swabbed and photographed.

94
0:06:22.36,000 --> 0:06:25,000
All right after a violent sexual assault.

95
0:06:26.8,000 --> 0:06:29,000
The reason that most people do this, who have a rape kit,

96
0:06:29.88,000 --> 0:06:32,000
is because they want the forensic scientists to study that rape kit.

97
0:06:33.52,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And hopefully come up with a genetic profile

98
0:06:36.36,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that will help identify their perpetrator.

99
0:06:39.68,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Once forensic scientists come up with this genetic profile,

100
0:06:42.8,000 --> 0:06:45,000
they enter it into CODIS, hopefully have a match.

101
0:06:46.6,000 --> 0:06:51,000
CODIS is filled with DNA profiles of people who are arrested

102
0:06:51.92,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and/or convicted of certain prescribed offenses.

103
0:06:56.84,000 --> 0:06:59,000
If in fact a profile is made and entered into CODIS,

104
0:06:59.88,000 --> 0:07:02,000
it can help identify a perpetrator in the matter of minutes.

105
0:07:03.76,000 --> 0:07:08,000
CODIS stands for Combined DNA Index System.

106
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Now, how did we get here?

107
0:07:14.56,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Detroit had no money.

108
0:07:18.24,000 --> 0:07:2,000
It cost, at that time that these kits were found,

109
0:07:20.6,000 --> 0:07:24,000
up to 1,500 dollars per kit to have it tested.

110
0:07:25.6,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So, you do the math about how much that was going to cost.

111
0:07:28.36,000 --> 0:07:3,000
In addition to that,

112
0:07:30.64,000 --> 0:07:33,000
within four years of these kits being found in 2009,

113
0:07:34.44,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Detroit would be the largest municipality in the history of the United States

114
0:07:39.08,000 --> 0:07:4,000
to declare bankruptcy.

115
0:07:41.8,000 --> 0:07:43,000
We didn't know what we were going to do.

116
0:07:43.96,000 --> 0:07:44,000
But not only that.

117
0:07:45.2,000 --> 0:07:49,000
As we began to study and investigate how this possibly could have happened,

118
0:07:49.76,000 --> 0:07:52,000
we discovered there were other issues besides just financial ones.

119
0:07:54.88,000 --> 0:07:59,000
During the course of these decades where these kits sat in that warehouse,

120
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
we discovered there had been multiple changes of police leadership,

121
0:08:04.52,000 --> 0:08:07,000
with different priorities and different agendas.

122
0:08:07.8,000 --> 0:08:11,000
There was woefully inadequate training for sex crimes officers

123
0:08:12.04,000 --> 0:08:13,000
in the police department in general.

124
0:08:14.64,000 --> 0:08:17,000
They were chronically understaffed,

125
0:08:17.92,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and they had other resource issues.

126
0:08:20.12,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And there was perpetual victim blaming

127
0:08:25.4,000 --> 0:08:28,000
when these victims came to report their crimes.

128
0:08:28.96,000 --> 0:08:29,000
That's the rape culture.

129
0:08:31.36,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And because of this victim blaming

130
0:08:33.84,000 --> 0:08:35,000
of someone that had been violently assaulted,

131
0:08:36.32,000 --> 0:08:38,000
some of these victim were even ridiculed

132
0:08:38.68,000 --> 0:08:41,000
into not continuing to proceed with their case.

133
0:08:42.6,000 --> 0:08:47,000
The bottom line is, that 11,341 rape kits sat on that shelf.

134
0:08:50.44,000 --> 0:08:51,000
I wanted transparency.

135
0:08:52.32,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I asked myself: How in the world can we stop this from spreading?

136
0:08:57.6,000 --> 0:09:,000
I don't want to go through all this work and five, 10 years down the line,

137
0:09:01.2,000 --> 0:09:02,000
figure we have the same issue.

138
0:09:03.44,000 --> 0:09:06,000
At that time, police officers had the sole discretion

139
0:09:07.12,000 --> 0:09:09,000
about whether and when and if

140
0:09:09.76,000 --> 0:09:11,000
they were going to submit the rape kits for testing --

141
0:09:12.36,000 --> 0:09:14,000
any rape kit in their jurisdiction -- for testing.

142
0:09:14.76,000 --> 0:09:15,000
That had to change.

143
0:09:16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
We had to take that discretion away from police officers,

144
0:09:18.72,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and pass state laws

145
0:09:20.36,000 --> 0:09:24,000
to ensure that every rape kit released by the victim to law enforcement

146
0:09:25.08,000 --> 0:09:27,000
is tested immediately.

147
0:09:28.72,000 --> 0:09:3,000
I also knew that there had to be some kind of system

148
0:09:31.2,000 --> 0:09:35,000
to keep everybody honest and to keep everybody accountable, put in place,

149
0:09:35.24,000 --> 0:09:38,000
where we knew where these rape kits were, at any given time.

150
0:09:40.28,000 --> 0:09:41,000
The answer was simple.

151
0:09:42.44,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Think about all of the hundreds of thousands

152
0:09:46.24,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and perhaps millions of packages,

153
0:09:48.6,000 --> 0:09:5,000
that are moved by a logistics company every day.

154
0:09:53.32,000 --> 0:09:55,000
They are scanned and tracked,

155
0:09:55.68,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and they know where they are, at every bend and turn,

156
0:09:58.2,000 --> 0:10:,000
from the time that they're stored in the warehouse,

157
0:10:00.64,000 --> 0:10:04,000
until the time that that package arrives on the purchaser's front steps.

158
0:10:06.84,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Why couldn't we do that for rape kits?

159
0:10:09.6,000 --> 0:10:12,000
I had no desire to reinvent the wheel.

160
0:10:13.04,000 --> 0:10:14,000
So I contacted UPS.

161
0:10:16.4,000 --> 0:10:2,000
UPS, within two weeks -- two weeks --

162
0:10:21.04,000 --> 0:10:23,000
of our first meeting with UPS,

163
0:10:23.44,000 --> 0:10:26,000
they had come up with a major plan

164
0:10:26.56,000 --> 0:10:28,000
where they involved all the stakeholders --

165
0:10:28.64,000 --> 0:10:3,000
the police officers, the prosecutors, the medical facilities,

166
0:10:31.56,000 --> 0:10:33,000
the forensic nurses, the hospitals,

167
0:10:33.88,000 --> 0:10:35,000
the lab personnel and the victim advocates,

168
0:10:36.6,000 --> 0:10:39,000
could know where the rape kits were at any given time.

169
0:10:40.6,000 --> 0:10:42,000
They sent a team of experts out

170
0:10:43.04,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and fanned the Detroit area, talked to all the stakeholders

171
0:10:46.08,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and developed a plan,

172
0:10:47.72,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and studied the life of a rape kit,

173
0:10:49.44,000 --> 0:10:51,000
from the time the rape kit was collected,

174
0:10:51.96,000 --> 0:10:53,000
through to the time that it was tested in the lab

175
0:10:54.32,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and returned to the police personnel.

176
0:10:56.6,000 --> 0:10:59,000
They also developed a web-based portal

177
0:10:59.8,000 --> 0:11:02,000
that all the stakeholders could look into and see where any given rape kit was

178
0:11:03.52,000 --> 0:11:04,000
at any given time.

179
0:11:05.32,000 --> 0:11:06,000
UPS had the technology,

180
0:11:07.28,000 --> 0:11:1,000
UPS knew how to use that technology to solve our problem,

181
0:11:10.36,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and we didn't.

182
0:11:13.04,000 --> 0:11:15,000
We launched -- we, we --

183
0:11:15.52,000 --> 0:11:17,000
UPS and the prosecutor's office --

184
0:11:17.56,000 --> 0:11:18,000
(Laughter)

185
0:11:18.8,000 --> 0:11:21,000
launched this pilot program in Detroit.

186
0:11:22.8,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And we started this process on January 28, 2015,

187
0:11:28.6,000 --> 0:11:32,000
through to May 25 of 2016.

188
0:11:33.08,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And during that period of time --

189
0:11:34.72,000 --> 0:11:36,000
remember, we're not dealing with the ones we found,

190
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
because they'd already been stored --

191
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:42,000
we're dealing with any new kit that came in as of January 28, 2015.

192
0:11:42.72,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And we knew where that rape kit was.

193
0:11:45.64,000 --> 0:11:5,000
For the 16 months of this project, we didn't lose a single rape kit.

194
0:11:51.36,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Not a single one.

195
0:11:52.6,000 --> 0:11:53,000
We knew where they all were.

196
0:11:54.08,000 --> 0:12:,000
(Applause)

197
0:12:00.52,000 --> 0:12:02,000
This project went on until the state of Michigan,

198
0:12:03.44,000 --> 0:12:05,000
the elected officials in state government,

199
0:12:05.92,000 --> 0:12:08,000
took notice of everything that UPS was doing.

200
0:12:09.04,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And everything that my office was doing.

201
0:12:11,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And they decided that they were going to use state funds

202
0:12:14.96,000 --> 0:12:16,000
to develop a state-wide tracking system.

203
0:12:17.6,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Not in just Detroit, but state-wide tracking system.

204
0:12:21.52,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Hopefully, that system will be up and running soon.

205
0:12:24.08,000 --> 0:12:26,000
But I loved working with UPS.

206
0:12:26.12,000 --> 0:12:29,000
I loved their innovation, I loved how fast they worked,

207
0:12:29.48,000 --> 0:12:33,000
I loved their unorthodox approach to ideas to solve an everyday, common problem,

208
0:12:34.04,000 --> 0:12:36,000
whose solution should be simple.

209
0:12:38.76,000 --> 0:12:4,000
So, after working with them

210
0:12:41.68,000 --> 0:12:43,000
I knew that even with one company,

211
0:12:44.2,000 --> 0:12:45,000
working on one issue,

212
0:12:46.08,000 --> 0:12:47,000
the progress that could be made.

213
0:12:49.48,000 --> 0:12:53,000
We've been at this now for nine years.

214
0:12:55.36,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And it was nine years ago

215
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
that we rescued those rape kits from the warehouse.

216
0:13:02.88,000 --> 0:13:04,000
That warehouse has since been torn down.

217
0:13:06.32,000 --> 0:13:09,000
But all of the kits have either been tested,

218
0:13:09.56,000 --> 0:13:11,000
or are in the final stages of being tested.

219
0:13:12.68,000 --> 0:13:13,000
We still have a lot of work to do

220
0:13:14.4,000 --> 0:13:18,000
in terms of investigation and prosecution of those cases,

221
0:13:18.64,000 --> 0:13:22,000
but our rape kit issue, in terms of testing, is done.

222
0:13:22.68,000 --> 0:13:25,000
As of June 28, 2018,

223
0:13:26.88,000 --> 0:13:31,000
our CODIS hits have showed us and identified 2,600 suspects.

224
0:13:33.36,000 --> 0:13:39,000
We have identified 861 serial rapists.

225
0:13:40.8,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Just within this project.

226
0:13:42.08,000 --> 0:13:46,000
That means 861 potential defendants

227
0:13:46.56,000 --> 0:13:48,000
that have raped within the project two or more times.

228
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And 50 to 75 of them have raped 10 to 15 times a piece.

229
0:13:56.84,000 --> 0:13:58,000
In one city, in one state.

230
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Also, the CODIS results that we have

231
0:14:04.4,000 --> 0:14:05,000
have tentacles to crime scenes,

232
0:14:06.28,000 --> 0:14:1,000
have linkages in 40 states in the United States.

233
0:14:10.72,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Forty of the 50 states have tentacles to our crime testing of these rape kits.

234
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
From Alaska to Florida

235
0:14:18.6,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and from Maine to the most southern parts of California.

236
0:14:22.36,000 --> 0:14:25,000
A sea to shining sea, string of CODIS hits.

237
0:14:28.84,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Natasha is now 36 years old.

238
0:14:32.72,000 --> 0:14:36,000
When she heard about the work that we were doing with the rape kits,

239
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:4,000
she contacted my office, the Wayne County prosecutor's office.

240
0:14:40.88,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Her kit was eventually tested.

241
0:14:43.08,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And it had identified Paul Warwick.

242
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:5,000
In the interim, Paul Warwick had raped two more women.

243
0:14:50.44,000 --> 0:14:52,000
One in the state of Colorado.

244
0:14:53.92,000 --> 0:14:57,000
Paul Warwick is now serving a sentence in the Michigan Department of Corrections,

245
0:14:58.92,000 --> 0:15:,000
in prison, of 15 to 40 years.

246
0:15:01.6,000 --> 0:15:07,000
(Applause)

247
0:15:08.48,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Pamela's kit was also tested.

248
0:15:11.28,000 --> 0:15:14,000
And her kit led to the identification -- her CODIS hit on her kit --

249
0:15:14.72,000 --> 0:15:16,000
led to the identification of Bernard Peterson.

250
0:15:18.4,000 --> 0:15:24,000
In the interim, Bernard Peterson raped 10 more women.

251
0:15:25.92,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Each of those women had a rape kit done.

252
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:33,000
And each of those women's rape kits sat on that shelf next to Pamela's.

253
0:15:34.6,000 --> 0:15:35,000
For a varying number of years.

254
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Bernard Peterson is now serving a sentence

255
0:15:40.6,000 --> 0:15:42,000
in the Michigan Department of Corrections,

256
0:15:42.68,000 --> 0:15:44,000
concurrently -- that means at the same time --

257
0:15:44.88,000 --> 0:15:48,000
of 60 to 90 years, and 90 years to 125 years,

258
0:15:49.04,000 --> 0:15:5,000
for the rapes that he committed.

259
0:15:50.64,000 --> 0:15:56,000
(Applause)

260
0:15:56.88,000 --> 0:15:59,000
We still have a lot of work to be done.

261
0:16:00.08,000 --> 0:16:03,000
And we desperately need the help of the private sector.

262
0:16:03.48,000 --> 0:16:05,000
We need the help of the tech industry.

263
0:16:05.88,000 --> 0:16:08,000
To help us develop -- not help us, we want them to develop --

264
0:16:09.24,000 --> 0:16:11,000
information management systems,

265
0:16:11.52,000 --> 0:16:13,000
so we can all talk to each other

266
0:16:13.8,000 --> 0:16:14,000
and stop these perpetrators

267
0:16:15.72,000 --> 0:16:17,000
from raping and maiming and killing with impunity.

268
0:16:19.6,000 --> 0:16:2,000
We also need help from those of you

269
0:16:21.56,000 --> 0:16:24,000
with marketing and advertisement backgrounds.

270
0:16:25.32,000 --> 0:16:27,000
We need you, desperately we need you,

271
0:16:27.8,000 --> 0:16:32,000
to develop campaigns for our children and other people to listen to,

272
0:16:33.08,000 --> 0:16:37,000
so we can stop the culture, change the culture of rape victims

273
0:16:37.4,000 --> 0:16:41,000
being too afraid to come forward because of what may happen to them.

274
0:16:44.36,000 --> 0:16:47,000
UPS was one company, as I said.

275
0:16:47.64,000 --> 0:16:49,000
They helped us with their innovation,

276
0:16:49.84,000 --> 0:16:53,000
and they revolutionized the way that we can track rape kits.

277
0:16:54.12,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Every single aspect of our lives is tracked.

278
0:16:58.32,000 --> 0:17:,000
Every like, every mood,

279
0:17:01.24,000 --> 0:17:04,000
shopping history, browsing history, reading history,

280
0:17:05,000 --> 0:17:09,000
our entire web history is tracked these days.

281
0:17:10.24,000 --> 0:17:15,000
What if we could track the activities and the comings and goings

282
0:17:15.52,000 --> 0:17:16,000
of criminals who commit crimes?

283
0:17:17.359,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Just like people track every aspect of our lives.

284
0:17:21.04,000 --> 0:17:25,000
In 2015, the Obama White House

285
0:17:25.48,000 --> 0:17:27,000
and the US Department of Justice

286
0:17:28.119,000 --> 0:17:33,000
put the number of untested, abandoned rape kits at 400,000,

287
0:17:33.16,000 --> 0:17:34,000
across this country.

288
0:17:34.64,000 --> 0:17:35,000
Four hundred thousand.

289
0:17:36.319,000 --> 0:17:38,000
That's a national pandemic.

290
0:17:39.28,000 --> 0:17:41,000
We know where a lot of those kits are.

291
0:17:41.52,000 --> 0:17:42,000
Our testing showed

292
0:17:43.24,000 --> 0:17:48,000
that women were raped waiting in their cars, waiting for friends,

293
0:17:48.6,000 --> 0:17:51,000
on their way to work, on their way from work,

294
0:17:52.16,000 --> 0:17:54,000
at gas stations, at shopping malls.

295
0:17:55.68,000 --> 0:17:57,000
And even one of the first cases that we did

296
0:17:57.92,000 --> 0:17:59,000
when these rape kits were starting to be tested,

297
0:18:00.4,000 --> 0:18:02,000
was a man who came into the window

298
0:18:02.64,000 --> 0:18:06,000
and got into the bed and raped a woman who was in bed with her two children.

299
0:18:07.68,000 --> 0:18:09,000
He raped her while he was in bed with her two children.

300
0:18:11.28,000 --> 0:18:14,000
Every time I look at a rape victim that comes into my office,

301
0:18:15.16,000 --> 0:18:16,000
because their case is being called

302
0:18:16.84,000 --> 0:18:18,000
or they're being interviewed by the prosecutor,

303
0:18:19.055,000 --> 0:18:2,000
they are being prepped for case,

304
0:18:20.64,000 --> 0:18:22,000
I look into their eyes and I think to myself,

305
0:18:23.76,000 --> 0:18:25,000
they didn't have to be one of the ones that was raped.

306
0:18:26.36,000 --> 0:18:28,000
They didn't have to be one of those victims.

307
0:18:28.48,000 --> 0:18:32,000
And maybe they would not have been, if these rape kits had been tested timely.

308
0:18:35.12,000 --> 0:18:38,000
How many more Pamelas are in this world?

309
0:18:39.36,000 --> 0:18:42,000
How many more Natashas are in this world?

310
0:18:42.68,000 --> 0:18:43,000
We may never know.

311
0:18:44.16,000 --> 0:18:47,000
But what I do know is that you have the technology,

312
0:18:47.44,000 --> 0:18:48,000
you know how to use it

313
0:18:48.68,000 --> 0:18:52,000
and you can help us solve the problem of rape kits being stockpiled.

314
0:18:53.56,000 --> 0:18:54,000
Thank you.

315
0:18:54.88,000 --> 0:19:,000
(Applause)

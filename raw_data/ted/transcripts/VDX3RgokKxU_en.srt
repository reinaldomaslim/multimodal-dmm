1
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I just want to say, over the last few years I've been --

2
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:38,000
had the opportunity to do this closing conference.

3
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And I've had some incredible warm-up acts.

4
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:45,000
About eight years ago,

5
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Billy Graham opened for me.

6
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And I thought that there was --

7
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:5,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I thought that there was absolutely no way

9
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:55,000
in hell to top that.

10
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But I just wanted to say --

11
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:,000
and I mean this without irony --

12
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I think I can speak for everybody in the audience

13
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:08,000
when I say that I wish to God that you were the President of the United States.

14
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:14,000
(Applause)

15
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:17,000
OK, this is the title of my talk today.

16
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:2,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I just want to give you a quick overview.

18
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:27,000
First of all, please remember I'm completely politically correct,

19
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and I mean everything with great affection.

20
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:32,000
If any of you have sensitive stomachs or are feeling queasy,

21
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:34,000
now is the time to check your Blackberry.

22
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Just to review, this is my TEDTalk.

24
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:42,000
We're going to do some jokes,

25
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:44,000
some gags,

26
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:48,000
some little skits --

27
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and then we're going to talk about the L1 point.

28
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:53,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So, one of the questions I ask myself

30
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:58,000
is, was this the most distressing TED ever?

31
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Let's try and sum things up, shall we?

32
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Images of limb regeneration

33
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and faces filled with smallpox:

34
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:07,000
21 percent of the conference.

35
0:02:07,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Laughter)

36
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Mentions of polar bears drowning: four percent.

37
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Images of the earth being wiped out by flood or bird flu: 64 percent.

38
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:18,000
(Laughter)

39
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And David Pogue singing show tunes.

40
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:23,000
(Applause)

41
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Because this is the most distressing TED ever,

42
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I've been working with Neil Gershenfeld on next year's TED Bag.

43
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And if the -- if the conference is anywhere near this distressing,

44
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:33,000
then we're going to have a scream bag next year.

45
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
(Laughter)

46
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:39,000
It's going to be a cradle-to-cradle scream bag, of course.

47
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So you're going to be able to go like this.

49
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Bring it over here

51
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and open it up. Aaaah!

52
0:02:55,000 --> 0:03:03,000
(Laughter)

53
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Meanwhile, back at TED University,

54
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:09,000
this wonderful woman is teaching you how to chop Sun Chips.

55
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:13,000
(Laughter)

56
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So Robert Wright -- I don't know,

57
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I felt like if there was anyone that Helen needed to give antidepressants to,

58
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:25,000
it might have been him.

59
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I want to deliberately interfere with his dopamine levels.

60
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:29,000
(Laughter)

61
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:31,000
He was talking about morality.

62
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Economy class morality is,

63
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:36,000
we want to bomb you back to the Stone Age.

64
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Business class morality is,

65
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:4,000
don't bomb Japan -- they built my car.

66
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And first-class morality is, don't bomb Mexico -- they clean my house.

67
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:46,000
(Laughter)

68
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Yes, it is politically incorrect.

69
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:52,000
All right,

70
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:54,000
now I want to do a little bit of a thing for you ...

71
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Laughter)

72
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:02,000
All right, now these are the wha --

73
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I'd say, [mumble, mumble --

74
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:08,000
mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble,

75
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:11,000
mumble] -- ahh!

76
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:14,000
(Laughter)

77
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:17,000
So I wanted to show you guys --

78
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I wanted to talk about a revolutionary new computer interface

79
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:25,000
that lets you work with images just as easily

80
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:27,000
as you -- as a completely natural user interface.

81
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:31,000
(Laughter)

82
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And you can --

83
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
you can use really natural hand gestures

84
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:37,000
to like, go like this.

85
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:43,000
(Applause)

86
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Now we had a Harvard professor here --

87
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:47,000
she was from Harvard, I just wanted to mention and --

88
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and she was actually a professor from Harvard.

89
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And she was talking about seven-dimensional, inverted universes.

90
0:04:55,000 --> 0:04:57,000
With, you know, of course, there's the gravity brain.

91
0:04:57,000 --> 0:05:,000
There's the weak brain. And then there's my weak brain,

92
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:02,000
which is too -- too -- absolutely too weak to understand

93
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:04,000
what the fuck she was talking about.

94
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:06,000
(Laughter)

95
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Now --

96
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:13,000
(Laughter)

97
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:15,000
one of the things that is very important to me

98
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:18,000
is to try and figure out what on Earth am I here for.

99
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And that's why I went out

100
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and I picked up a best-selling business book.

101
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:26,000
You know, it basically uses as its central premise Greek mythology.

102
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And it's by a guy named Pastor Rick Warren,

103
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and it's called

104
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:33,000
"The Porpoise Driven Life."

105
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
(Laughter)

106
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And Rick is as

107
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:41,000
a pagan god,

108
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:43,000
which I thought was kind of appropriate,

109
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:45,000
in a certain way.

110
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And now we're going to have kind of

111
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:5,000
a little more visualization about Rick Warren.

112
0:05:56,000 --> 0:05:58,000
OK.

113
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:05,000
(Laughter)

114
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:08,000
All right.

115
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Now, red is Rick Warren,

116
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and green is Daniel Dennett, OK?

117
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Laughter)

118
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:21,000
The scales here are religiosity from zero percent,

119
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:23,000
or atheist, to 100 percent, Bible literally true.

120
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And then this is books sold -- the logarithmic scale.

121
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:31,000
(Laughter)

122
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:35,000
30,000, 300,000, three million, 30 million, 300 million.

123
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:37,000
OK, now they're duking it out. Now they're duking it out.

124
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:38,000
(Laughter)

125
0:06:39,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And Rick Warren's kind of pulling ahead, kind of pulling ahead.

126
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Yup, and his installed base is getting a little bigger.

127
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:5,000
(Laughter)

128
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:54,000
But Darwin's dangerous idea is coming back. It's coming back.

129
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Let me turn the trails on, so you can see that a little bit better.

130
0:06:56,000 --> 0:07:03,000
(Laughter)

131
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:08,000
(Applause)

132
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Now, one of the things that's very important is,

133
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Nicholas Negroponte talked to us about one lap dance per --

134
0:07:13,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I'm sorry --

135
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:17,000
(Laughter)

136
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:25,000
about One Laptop Per Child.

137
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Now let's talk about some of the characteristics

138
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that are important for this revolutionary device.

139
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:31,000
I'll tell you a little bit about the design parameters,

140
0:07:31,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and then I'll show it to you in person.

141
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
First of all, it needs to be small.

142
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:37,000
It needs to be flat, so it's transportable.

143
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Lightweight. Portable.

144
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Uses very, very little power.

145
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Very, very high resolution.

146
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Has to be visible in bright daylight. Will work anywhere.

147
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And broadly applicable across many platforms.

148
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Now, we've actually done some research --

149
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Neil Gershenfeld and the Fab Labs went out into the market.

150
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:58,000
They did some research; we came back; and we think we have the perfect prototype

151
0:07:58,000 --> 0:08:02,000
of what the students in the field are actually asking for.

152
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And here it is,

153
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:06,000
the $100 computer.

154
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:12,000
(Laughter)

155
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:16,000
OK, OK, OK, OK -- excellent, excellent.

156
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Now, I bought this device from Clifford Stoll for about 900 bucks.

157
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And he and his team of junior-high school students

158
0:08:26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
were doing real science.

159
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:3,000
So we're trying to check and trying to douse here,

160
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and see who uses marijuana.

161
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:33,000
(Laughter)

162
0:08:33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
See who uses marijuana.

163
0:08:35,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Are we going to be able to find any marijuana, Jim Young?

164
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Only if we open enough locker doors.

165
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:44,000
(Laughter)

166
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:48,000
OK, now smallpox is an extremely distressing illness.

167
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:52,000
We had Dr. Larry Brilliant talking about how we eradicated smallpox.

168
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I wanted to show you the stages of smallpox.

169
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:57,000
We start. This is day one.

170
0:08:57,000 --> 0:08:59,000
(Laughter)

171
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Day two.

172
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Day three, she gets a massively big pox on her shoulder.

173
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Day three.

174
0:09:08,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Day four.

175
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:11,000
(Laughter)

176
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Day five

177
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and day six.

178
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:16,000
(Laughter)

179
0:09:16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Now the good news is, because I'm a trained medical professional,

180
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I know that even though she'll be scarred for life,

181
0:09:21,000 --> 0:09:23,000
she's going to make a full recovery.

182
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:28,000
(Laughter)

183
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Now the good news about Architects for Humanity

184
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
is they're really kind of the most amazing group.

185
0:09:36,000 --> 0:09:38,000
They've been sponsoring a design competition

186
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:4,000
to come up with innovative medical housing solutions,

187
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:42,000
clinic solutions, in Africa,

188
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and they've had a design competition.

189
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Now the wonderful thing is, Larry Brilliant was just appointed

190
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:5,000
the head of the Google Foundation,

191
0:09:5,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and so he decided that he would support --

192
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:55,000
he would support Cameron's work.

193
0:09:55,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And the way he decided to support that work

194
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:,000
was by shipping over 50,000 shipping containers

195
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:02,000
of Google snacks.

196
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:03,000
(Laughter)

197
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:06,000
So I want to show you some prototypes.

198
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:14,000
The U.N. -- you know, they took 20 years just to add a flap to a tent,

199
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:16,000
but I think we have some more exciting things.

200
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:19,000
This is a home made entirely out of Fruit Roll-Ups.

201
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:22,000
(Laughter)

202
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:27,000
(Applause)

203
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And those roll-up cookies coated with white chocolate.

204
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And the really wonderful thing about this is,

205
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:36,000
when you're done, well --

206
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:38,000
you can eat it.

207
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:42,000
But the thing that I'm really, really excited about

208
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:44,000
is this incredible granola house.

209
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:45,000
(Laughter)

210
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And the granola house has a special Sun Chip roof

211
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:5,000
to collect water and recycle it.

212
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And it's -- well, on this side it has regular Sour Patch Kids

213
0:10:54,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and Gummy Bears to let in the light.

214
0:10:56,000 --> 0:10:57,000
(Laughter)

215
0:10:57,000 --> 0:10:59,000
But on this side, it has sugary Gummy Bears,

216
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:01,000
to diffuse the light more slightly.

217
0:11:02,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And we -- we wanted just to show you what this might look like in situ.

218
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:09,000
(Laughter)

219
0:11:1,000 --> 0:11:16,000
(Applause)

220
0:11:17,000 --> 0:11:19,000
So, Einstein --

221
0:11:2,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Einstein, tell me --

222
0:11:23,000 --> 0:11:25,000
what's your favorite song?

223
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
No, I said what's your favorite song?

224
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:34,000
No, I said what's your favorite song?

225
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:36,000
"Free Bird."

226
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:38,000
(Laughter)

227
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:43,000
(Applause)

228
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:47,000
OK, so, Einstein,

229
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:5,000
what's your favorite singing group?

230
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Could you say that again? What's your favorite singing group?

231
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:01,000
OK, one more time -- I'm just going to give you a little help.

232
0:12:01,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Your favorite singing group -- it's Diana Ross and the --

233
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Audience: Supremes!

234
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Tom Reilly: Exactly.

235
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:15,000
(Applause)

236
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Could we have the sound up on the laptop, please?

237
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:19,000
(Laughter)

238
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:21,000
"Free Bird" kind of reminds me that if you --

239
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:23,000
if you listen to "Free Bird" backwards,

240
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:25,000
this is what you might hear.

241
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Computer: Satan. Satan. Satan. Satan.

242
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Satan. Satan. Satan.

243
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:37,000
TR: Now it's a little hard to hear the whole message, so I wanted to --

244
0:12:37,000 --> 0:12:39,000
(Laughter)

245
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:41,000
so I wanted to help you a little bit.

246
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Computer: My sweet Satan. Dan Dennett worships Satan.

247
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Buy "The Purpose-Driven Life," or Satan will take your soul.

248
0:12:55,000 --> 0:13:04,000
(Laughter)

249
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:08,000
TR: So,

250
0:13:08,000 --> 0:13:1,000
we've talked a lot about global warming,

251
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:13,000
but, you know, as Jill said, it sounds kind of nice --

252
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:15,000
good weather in the wintertime, and New York City.

253
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
And as Jay Walker pointed out, that is just not scary enough.

254
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:23,000
So Al, I actually think I'm rather good at branding.

255
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:27,000
So I've tried to figure out a good design process

256
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:29,000
to come up with a new term to replace "global warming."

257
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:33,000
So we started with Babel Fish. We put in global warming.

258
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And then we decided that we'd change it from English to Dutch --

259
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:38,000
into "Het globale Verwarmen."

260
0:13:39,000 --> 0:13:42,000
From Dutch to [Korean], into "Hordahordaneecheewa."

261
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:43,000
(Laughter)

262
0:13:43,000 --> 0:13:46,000
[Korean] to Portuguese: Aquecer-se Global.

263
0:13:46,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Then Portuguese to Pig Latin.

264
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:57,000
(Laughter)

265
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:,000
Aquecer-se ucked-fay.

266
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And then finally back into the English,

267
0:14:03,000 --> 0:14:05,000
which is, we're totally fucked.

268
0:14:05,000 --> 0:14:06,000
(Laughter)

269
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:13,000
(Applause)

270
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Now I don't know about you,

271
0:14:15,000 --> 0:14:18,000
but Michael Shermer talked about the willingness for human beings --

272
0:14:18,000 --> 0:14:21,000
evolutionarily, they're designed to see patterns in things.

273
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:23,000
For example, in cheese sandwiches.

274
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Now can you look at that carefully and see if you see the Virgin Mary?

275
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:3,000
I tried to make it a little bit clearer.

276
0:14:3,000 --> 0:14:34,000
(Laughter)

277
0:14:34,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Is it the Virgin Mary?

278
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Or is it Mena Trott?

279
0:14:41,000 --> 0:14:43,000
So, I talked to Josh Prince-Ramus about the convention center

280
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and the conferences. It's getting awfully big.

281
0:14:45,000 --> 0:14:48,000
It's getting just a little bit too big. It's bursting at the seams here a little bit.

282
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:5,000
So we tried to come up with a program --

283
0:14:5,000 --> 0:14:53,000
how we could remake this structure to better accommodate TED.

284
0:14:53,000 --> 0:14:55,000
So first of all we decided --

285
0:14:55,000 --> 0:14:56,000
(Laughter)

286
0:14:56,000 --> 0:14:58,000
that we needed about one-third bookstore,

287
0:14:58,000 --> 0:15:,000
one-third Google cafe,

288
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:03,000
about 20 percent registration, 80 percent luxury hotel,

289
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:05,000
about five percent for restrooms.

290
0:15:05,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And then of course, we wanted to have the simulcast lounge,

291
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:08,000
the lobby and the Steinbeck forum.

292
0:15:08,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Now let me show you how that

293
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:11,000
literally translated into the design program.

294
0:15:13,000 --> 0:15:15,000
So first,

295
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:17,000
one of the problems with Monterey is that if there is global warming

296
0:15:17,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and Greenland melts as you say, the ocean level

297
0:15:19,000 --> 0:15:23,000
is going to rise 20 feet and flood the hell out of the convention center.

298
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:25,000
So we're going to build this new building on stilts.

299
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:27,000
So we build this building on stilts,

300
0:15:27,000 --> 0:15:29,000
then up here --

301
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:3,000
(Laughter)

302
0:15:3,000 --> 0:15:32,000
is where we're going to put the new Steinbeck auditorium.

303
0:15:32,000 --> 0:15:33,000
(Laughter)

304
0:15:33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And the wonderful thing about the new bookstore is,

305
0:15:36,000 --> 0:15:39,000
it's going to be shaped in a spiral that's organized by the Dewey Decimal System.

306
0:15:4,000 --> 0:15:41,000
(Laughter)

307
0:15:42,000 --> 0:15:44,000
Then we're going to make an escalator that helps you get up there.

308
0:15:45,000 --> 0:15:48,000
And finally, we're going to put the Marriott Hotel

309
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:5,000
and the Portola Plaza on the top.

310
0:15:5,000 --> 0:15:54,000
(Applause)

311
0:15:54,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Now I don't know about you, but sometimes I have these images in my head

312
0:15:57,000 --> 0:15:59,000
of separated at birth.

313
0:15:59,000 --> 0:16:02,000
I don't know about you, but when I see Aubrey de Grey,

314
0:16:02,000 --> 0:16:05,000
I immediately go to Gandalf the Grey.

315
0:16:05,000 --> 0:16:09,000
(Laughter)

316
0:16:09,000 --> 0:16:11,000
OK. Now, we've heard, of course,

317
0:16:11,000 --> 0:16:13,000
that we're all soldiers here.

318
0:16:14,000 --> 0:16:16,000
So what I'd really, really like you to do now is,

319
0:16:16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
pick up your white piece of paper. Does everybody have their white piece of paper?

320
0:16:2,000 --> 0:16:22,000
And I want you to get out a pen,

321
0:16:23,000 --> 0:16:25,000
and I want you to write a terrorist note.

322
0:16:25,000 --> 0:16:28,000
(Laughter)

323
0:16:28,000 --> 0:16:3,000
If we put up the ELMO for a moment --

324
0:16:31,000 --> 0:16:33,000
if we put up the ELMO, then we'll get, you know,

325
0:16:33,000 --> 0:16:36,000
I'll give you a model that you can work from, OK?

326
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:39,000
(Laughter)

327
0:16:39,000 --> 0:16:43,000
And then I want you to fold that note into a paper airplane.

328
0:16:44,000 --> 0:16:46,000
And once you've folded it into a paper airplane,

329
0:16:46,000 --> 0:16:48,000
I want you to take some anthrax --

330
0:16:48,000 --> 0:16:5,000
(Laughter)

331
0:16:5,000 --> 0:16:52,000
and I want you to put that in the paper airplane.

332
0:16:53,000 --> 0:16:55,000
And then I want you to throw it on Jim Young.

333
0:16:55,000 --> 0:16:57,000
(Laughter)

334
0:16:58,000 --> 0:17:,000
Luckily, I was the recipient of the TED Prize this year.

335
0:17:02,000 --> 0:17:04,000
And I wanted to see --

336
0:17:04,000 --> 0:17:07,000
I want to dedicate this film to my father, Homer.

337
0:17:07,000 --> 0:17:09,000
OK.

338
0:17:15,000 --> 0:17:17,000
Now this film isn't really hard enough,

339
0:17:17,000 --> 0:17:19,000
so I wanted to make it a little bit harder.

340
0:17:19,000 --> 0:17:21,000
So I'm going to try and do this while reciting pi.

341
0:17:21,000 --> 0:17:22,000
(Laughter)

342
0:17:22,000 --> 0:17:24,000
3.1415,

343
0:17:25,000 --> 0:17:27,000
2657,

344
0:17:27,000 --> 0:17:29,000
753,

345
0:17:29,000 --> 0:17:31,000
8567,

346
0:17:33,000 --> 0:17:35,000
24972 --

347
0:17:35,000 --> 0:17:39,000
-- 85871, 25871,

348
0:17:4,000 --> 0:17:44,000
3928, 5657,

349
0:17:46,000 --> 0:17:49,000
2592, 5624.

350
0:17:49,000 --> 0:17:56,000
(Applause)

351
0:17:56,000 --> 0:17:58,000
Can we cue the music please?

352
0:18:14,000 --> 0:18:24,000
(Applause)

353
0:18:25,000 --> 0:18:28,000
Now I wanted to use this talk to talk about global warming a little bit.

354
0:18:3,000 --> 0:18:32,000
Back in 1968,

355
0:18:32,000 --> 0:18:35,000
you can see that the mountain range of Brokeback Mountain

356
0:18:35,000 --> 0:18:38,000
was covered in 151 inches of snow pack.

357
0:18:4,000 --> 0:18:42,000
Parenthetically, over there on the slopes,

358
0:18:42,000 --> 0:18:46,000
I did want to show you that black men ski.

359
0:18:46,000 --> 0:18:51,000
(Laughter)

360
0:18:52,000 --> 0:18:55,000
But over the years,

361
0:18:55,000 --> 0:18:57,000
10 years later, the snow packs eroded,

362
0:18:57,000 --> 0:18:59,000
and, if you notice, the trees have started turning yellow.

363
0:18:59,000 --> 0:19:02,000
The water level of the lake has started drying up.

364
0:19:04,000 --> 0:19:06,000
A few years later, there's no snow left at all.

365
0:19:07,000 --> 0:19:09,000
And all the trees have turned brown.

366
0:19:11,000 --> 0:19:13,000
This year, unfortunately the lakebed's

367
0:19:13,000 --> 0:19:15,000
turned into an absolute cracked dry bed.

368
0:19:16,000 --> 0:19:19,000
And I fear, if we do nothing for our planet,

369
0:19:19,000 --> 0:19:22,000
in 20 years, it's going to look like this.

370
0:19:24,000 --> 0:19:36,000
(Laughter)

371
0:19:37,000 --> 0:19:41,000
Mr. Vice President, I wish I knew how to quit you.

372
0:19:42,000 --> 0:19:43,000
(Laughter)

373
0:19:43,000 --> 0:19:46,000
(Applause)

374
0:19:47,000 --> 0:19:48,000
Thank you very much.

375
0:19:48,000 --> 0:20:02,000
(Applause)

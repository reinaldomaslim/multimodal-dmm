2
0:00:12.579,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So, for the first time in America's modern history,

3
0:00:14.984,000 --> 0:00:16,000
we have five generations interacting at work.

4
0:00:17.579,000 --> 0:00:2,000
The veterans, born between 1922 and 1943,

5
0:00:21.19,000 --> 0:00:24,000
are known as the Greatest Generation, the matures, the silents.

6
0:00:25.149,000 --> 0:00:27,000
They're known for their self-sacrifice,

7
0:00:27.45,000 --> 0:00:3,000
respect for authority and work as its own reward.

8
0:00:31.141,000 --> 0:00:36,000
The boomers came shortly after, born between 1944 and 1960.

9
0:00:37.002,000 --> 0:00:39,000
This is a generation characterized by hard work.

10
0:00:39.662,000 --> 0:00:42,000
In fact, we can thank this generation for the term "workaholic."

11
0:00:43.795,000 --> 0:00:46,000
They appreciate competition, they love effective communication.

12
0:00:47.72,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And they're thinking towards retirement, if they haven't retired already.

13
0:00:52.402,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Generation X is known as the lost generation

14
0:00:55.496,000 --> 0:00:59,000
the latchkey generation, born between 1961 and 1980.

15
0:00:59.768,000 --> 0:01:,000
This is the smallest generation,

16
0:01:01.666,000 --> 0:01:04,000
sandwiched between boomers and the big millennials.

17
0:01:04.95,000 --> 0:01:06,000
More parents were divorced in this generation

18
0:01:07.077,000 --> 0:01:08,000
than any generation prior.

19
0:01:09.045,000 --> 0:01:12,000
They also were the first generation to tell us about work-life balance,

20
0:01:12.958,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and the first to really ask for that in the workplace.

21
0:01:16.647,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And then millennials -- you know, the everybody-gets-a-ribbon generation --

22
0:01:20.275,000 --> 0:01:22,000
born between 1981 and 2000.

23
0:01:22.974,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Never knew a time where technology wasn't present in the home.

24
0:01:26.831,000 --> 0:01:29,000
They're incredibly pragmatic, they're hopeful and they're determined.

25
0:01:30.118,000 --> 0:01:32,000
They think they're going to change the world,

26
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
in fact, I believe they're going to do it.

27
0:01:34.299,000 --> 0:01:36,000
They might be a little bit idealistic sometimes,

28
0:01:36.72,000 --> 0:01:38,000
but in just the last several years,

29
0:01:38.772,000 --> 0:01:4,000
we've seen millennials overtake Generation X

30
0:01:41.625,000 --> 0:01:43,000
to be the most represented generation in the workforce.

31
0:01:44.506,000 --> 0:01:48,000
In fact, more than one in three people in the United States labor force

32
0:01:48.622,000 --> 0:01:49,000
is a millennial.

33
0:01:50.145,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And soon to join us there, Generation Z, born since 2000,

34
0:01:53.915,000 --> 0:01:56,000
our high school interns or soon to be high school graduates.

35
0:01:57.688,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Now, if you open any internet browser,

36
0:01:59.927,000 --> 0:02:,000
look at Amazon,

37
0:02:01.149,000 --> 0:02:03,000
search any of your favorite search engines,

38
0:02:03.49,000 --> 0:02:06,000
you might assume there's a literal war in the workplace, right?

39
0:02:07.188,000 --> 0:02:08,000
We see blog topics like

40
0:02:08.877,000 --> 0:02:11,000
"Seventeen reasons why millennials are the worst generation."

41
0:02:12.228,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And "Why baby boomers have ruined it for everybody."

42
0:02:14.815,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Or "Bridging the great generational divide."

43
0:02:17.125,000 --> 0:02:19,000
It's like turning into this "West Side Story,"

44
0:02:19.307,000 --> 0:02:2,000
like, boomers come in one door,

45
0:02:20.824,000 --> 0:02:22,000
millennials come in another door, the lobby,

46
0:02:22.935,000 --> 0:02:25,000
they just fight with each other all day, complain, go home, do the same,

47
0:02:26.372,000 --> 0:02:27,000
come back to work, right?

48
0:02:28.157,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Well, so what if I told you these generations may not exist?

49
0:02:34.406,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I've been spending some time thinking about this and researching this,

50
0:02:37.74,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and fellow researchers and I aren't exactly sure

51
0:02:40.057,000 --> 0:02:42,000
that these generations are real.

52
0:02:42.702,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And in fact, if we can agree that these groups even exist,

53
0:02:46.088,000 --> 0:02:48,000
we certainly don't agree who belongs in them.

54
0:02:49.468,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And they span something like 20 years.

55
0:02:52.199,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So at whatever point in history,

56
0:02:53.911,000 --> 0:02:57,000
a one-year-old and a 20-year-old are said to share the same value system,

57
0:02:58.117,000 --> 0:03:,000
to want the same things at work,

58
0:03:00.3,000 --> 0:03:03,000
to have the same stereotypes working for and against them.

59
0:03:04.157,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And in fact, different areas of the world define these generations differently.

60
0:03:07.911,000 --> 0:03:11,000
So we can't even compare generations across various areas of the world.

61
0:03:12.077,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And these stereotypes about each generation

62
0:03:14.118,000 --> 0:03:17,000
have, in a lot of ways, created this self-fulfilling prophecy,

63
0:03:17.45,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that people begin to act as if they're part of that generation

64
0:03:20.72,000 --> 0:03:22,000
because we've said out loud that generation is real.

65
0:03:23.736,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I'm not so sure that it is.

66
0:03:25.307,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And in fact, this idea of generations

67
0:03:27.66,000 --> 0:03:3,000
has become deeply embedded in United States culture.

68
0:03:30.808,000 --> 0:03:31,000
When we talk generations,

69
0:03:32.261,000 --> 0:03:34,000
people know exactly what we're talking about.

70
0:03:35.014,000 --> 0:03:37,000
In fact, people have a lot of thoughts and feelings

71
0:03:37.556,000 --> 0:03:38,000
about each of these generations.

72
0:03:39.119,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And I'll tell you how I know this.

73
0:03:40.792,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I did the thing

74
0:03:41.975,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that every red-blooded American and pre-tenure academic does

75
0:03:44.934,000 --> 0:03:45,000
when they have a question.

76
0:03:46.204,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I Googled some stuff.

77
0:03:47.434,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And this is what I learned.

78
0:03:49.776,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Google is based on algorithms,

79
0:03:51.499,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and they provide you with commonly searched terms,

80
0:03:53.942,000 --> 0:03:55,000
or suggested hits, based on what other people are searching

81
0:03:56.823,000 --> 0:03:57,000
surrounding the same topic.

82
0:03:58.165,000 --> 0:04:,000
And it gave me a really good sense of what people think

83
0:04:00.768,000 --> 0:04:01,000
about each of these generations.

84
0:04:02.323,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Take a look.

85
0:04:03.577,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I learned that baby boomers are conservative,

86
0:04:06.948,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that Americans think they're stupid.

87
0:04:08.821,000 --> 0:04:09,000
The worst generation, they're angry,

88
0:04:10.664,000 --> 0:04:13,000
apparently they're racist and they're so important.

89
0:04:14.512,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Looking at Generation X,

90
0:04:16.403,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I learned Generation X is a cynical group,

91
0:04:18.895,000 --> 0:04:19,000
they're angry,

92
0:04:20.427,000 --> 0:04:22,000
they're known as the lost generation -- we know this;

93
0:04:22.939,000 --> 0:04:23,000
they're the smallest generation.

94
0:04:24.833,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Apparently, they're stupid too.

95
0:04:26.449,000 --> 0:04:27,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:27.474,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And mostly, they're frustrated with baby boomers.

97
0:04:30.664,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Alright, millennials, this is what I learned about us.

98
0:04:33.22,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So, we're obsessed with food.

99
0:04:34.688,000 --> 0:04:35,000
(Laughter)

100
0:04:37.339,000 --> 0:04:39,000
We're also stupid, ah!

101
0:04:40.117,000 --> 0:04:42,000
We're lazy, we're sensitive, we're fired,

102
0:04:42.569,000 --> 0:04:44,000
we're also hated, and we think we're important.

103
0:04:44.794,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And perhaps the most terrifying search result on the internet --

104
0:04:48.006,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Generation Z is screwed.

105
0:04:50.276,000 --> 0:04:53,000
(Laughter)

106
0:04:53.45,000 --> 0:04:57,000
OK, so, for five years, I've been talking to leaders and followers

107
0:04:58.145,000 --> 0:05:,000
across a wide variety of organizations.

108
0:05:00.664,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And this is what I've come to realize.

109
0:05:02.982,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Generations haven't become part of the conversation --

110
0:05:05.601,000 --> 0:05:08,000
generations have become the conversation at work.

111
0:05:09.377,000 --> 0:05:1,000
What I've learned

112
0:05:10.551,000 --> 0:05:14,000
is that we're working under the assumption that those Google results are true.

113
0:05:15.735,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And so, what I think is that organizations are now desperate

114
0:05:20.799,000 --> 0:05:23,000
to figure out how to "manage" the multigenerational workplace.

115
0:05:24.617,000 --> 0:05:25,000
"Manage" it.

116
0:05:25.99,000 --> 0:05:26,000
We manage all sorts of things.

117
0:05:27.807,000 --> 0:05:3,000
We're preparing for this wave of millennials to come to work.

118
0:05:31.236,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So we prepare for hurricanes, right?

119
0:05:33.442,000 --> 0:05:36,000
We prepare to take the MCAT, we prepare for natural disasters.

120
0:05:36.744,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Why are we preparing for 23-year-olds to come to work?

121
0:05:39.498,000 --> 0:05:4,000
(Laughter)

122
0:05:40.617,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I've talked to these organizations,

123
0:05:42.344,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and I've heard amazing things that they're doing

124
0:05:44.975,000 --> 0:05:46,000
to create a workspace for everybody to get along

125
0:05:47.731,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and to have autonomy and to feel like they're thriving.

126
0:05:51.069,000 --> 0:05:53,000
But I've also heard some really incredibly harebrained ideas

127
0:05:53.967,000 --> 0:05:55,000
about how to navigate the multigenerational workplace.

128
0:05:56.53,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Are you ready?

129
0:05:57.705,000 --> 0:05:58,000
This is what I saw.

130
0:05:58.894,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I visited an organization,

131
0:06:00.181,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and they adopted this idea that if you can see it, you can be it.

132
0:06:04.268,000 --> 0:06:05,000
A really important concept.

133
0:06:06.165,000 --> 0:06:07,000
But I think they blew it.

134
0:06:07.53,000 --> 0:06:1,000
The put pictures on the walls of the ideal multigenerational workplace,

135
0:06:11.427,000 --> 0:06:13,000
because if you can see it, you can be it.

136
0:06:14.767,000 --> 0:06:16,000
(Laughter)

137
0:06:17.641,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Or like this one.

138
0:06:18.823,000 --> 0:06:2,000
(Laughter)

139
0:06:21.528,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Like, I don't even want to work here.

140
0:06:23.473,000 --> 0:06:24,000
(Laughter)

141
0:06:24.522,000 --> 0:06:27,000
You don't get to wear color here, apparently,

142
0:06:27.72,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and HR seriously has problems with people jumping in heels,

143
0:06:30.546,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I promise you that, OK?

144
0:06:32.553,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I talked to an organization who recently decided

145
0:06:35.514,000 --> 0:06:37,000
against putting a ball pit in the break room

146
0:06:38.229,000 --> 0:06:4,000
because that's how you retain millennials.

147
0:06:41.307,000 --> 0:06:43,000
We're 30, not three.

148
0:06:43.403,000 --> 0:06:44,000
(Laughter)

149
0:06:44.792,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And in fact, I know a young, at the time, millennial,

150
0:06:49.482,000 --> 0:06:53,000
who was told that if she wanted people to take her seriously,

151
0:06:53.577,000 --> 0:06:56,000
just because she was a millennial, she would have to do this --

152
0:06:57.093,000 --> 0:06:58,000
wear shoulder pads.

153
0:06:59.244,000 --> 0:07:,000
Yes.

154
0:07:00.419,000 --> 0:07:03,000
People younger than her and older than her wouldn't take her seriously

155
0:07:03.871,000 --> 0:07:05,000
unless she wore shoulder pads.

156
0:07:06.173,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Straight-out-of-the-80s,

157
0:07:07.347,000 --> 0:07:09,000
can't-even-buy-them-anywhere shoulder pads.

158
0:07:09.95,000 --> 0:07:11,000
This young woman had two graduate degrees.

159
0:07:13.117,000 --> 0:07:14,000
This young woman was me.

160
0:07:16.268,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And this is the best we came up with?

161
0:07:18.554,000 --> 0:07:22,000
How to navigate the multigenerational workplace ... is shoulder pads?

162
0:07:22.736,000 --> 0:07:23,000
(Laughter)

163
0:07:24.585,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So, this is also what I've learned talking to organizations

164
0:07:27.689,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that employ a wide range of people of various ages.

165
0:07:31.498,000 --> 0:07:33,000
We are so much more similar than we are different.

166
0:07:34.191,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And we're hearing this consistently.

167
0:07:36.635,000 --> 0:07:38,000
People want work that matters, they want flexibility,

168
0:07:39.397,000 --> 0:07:41,000
they want support, they want appreciation,

169
0:07:41.429,000 --> 0:07:42,000
they want better coffee.

170
0:07:42.619,000 --> 0:07:45,000
But none of these things are tied to a generation.

171
0:07:46.053,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Now, sure, we see small differences in what people want.

172
0:07:49.093,000 --> 0:07:52,000
We know 20-year-olds and 60-year-olds go home and do different things.

173
0:07:52.719,000 --> 0:07:53,000
They have different values.

174
0:07:54.259,000 --> 0:07:57,000
At least when it comes to things happening outside of work.

175
0:07:57.854,000 --> 0:07:58,000
But I think what's happened

176
0:07:59.414,000 --> 0:08:01,000
is that this focus on generational cohorts,

177
0:08:02.077,000 --> 0:08:03,000
these groups of people,

178
0:08:03.45,000 --> 0:08:07,000
has created a space where we just forgot that people are people.

179
0:08:09.061,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And to know who they really are, who we really work with,

180
0:08:12.294,000 --> 0:08:14,000
we have to figure out how to better navigate

181
0:08:14.382,000 --> 0:08:15,000
this multigenerational workplace

182
0:08:16.009,000 --> 0:08:17,000
than ball pits.

183
0:08:18.437,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Call me one of those idealist millennials, but I think we can get there.

184
0:08:21.855,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And I don't think the idea is too terribly difficult.

185
0:08:25.879,000 --> 0:08:29,000
What if we radically, simply, not easily,

186
0:08:29.998,000 --> 0:08:3,000
meet people where they are?

187
0:08:32.482,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Individualize our approach.

188
0:08:34.006,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I've never met a generation.

189
0:08:35.561,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I've had a lot of conversations

190
0:08:37.109,000 --> 0:08:4,000
with people who happened to identify with a specific generational cohort.

191
0:08:41.538,000 --> 0:08:43,000
I know that 80-year-olds text message

192
0:08:44.331,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and 23-year-olds crochet blankets.

193
0:08:46.466,000 --> 0:08:49,000
None of these things are stereotypical of that generation, right?

194
0:08:49.957,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Nilofer Merchant -- she's a thought leader in innovation --

195
0:08:52.792,000 --> 0:08:55,000
she tells us we have to meet people in their onlyness,

196
0:08:55.933,000 --> 0:08:57,000
that is, that spot in the world where only we stand,

197
0:08:58.696,000 --> 0:09:02,000
as a function of our unique history, our experiences and our hopes.

198
0:09:03.887,000 --> 0:09:05,000
But this requires flexibility and curiosity.

199
0:09:06.54,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And what happens when we meet people in their onlyness,

200
0:09:10.104,000 --> 0:09:12,000
only the spot in the world that they stand,

201
0:09:12.286,000 --> 0:09:16,000
we learn that that boomer who is just acting "angry" at work all the time

202
0:09:17.236,000 --> 0:09:18,000
is scared.

203
0:09:18.871,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Because he's worked every day since he was 16 years old,

204
0:09:22.974,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and on a Monday, sooner than he can imagine,

205
0:09:25.792,000 --> 0:09:26,000
he'll never go to work again.

206
0:09:27.895,000 --> 0:09:28,000
He's got plans.

207
0:09:29.085,000 --> 0:09:3,000
It's going to take like a week and a half

208
0:09:31.085,000 --> 0:09:33,000
to do all the things on that retirement list.

209
0:09:33.736,000 --> 0:09:34,000
But then what?

210
0:09:35.109,000 --> 0:09:36,000
What if we give a little bit of grace

211
0:09:36.942,000 --> 0:09:38,000
to the person that might be a little scared?

212
0:09:40.175,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Or that Generation X-er

213
0:09:42.469,000 --> 0:09:45,000
who has four drop-offs, three kids, two hands,

214
0:09:46.183,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and is just trying to keep the wheels on the bus.

215
0:09:48.498,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Sure, maybe she's a little aloof at work.

216
0:09:50.553,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Maybe she's a little independent, maybe she's exhausted.

217
0:09:53.577,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Or that millennial

218
0:09:54.879,000 --> 0:09:57,000
who asks for a raise after two months because they're "entitled?"

219
0:09:58.395,000 --> 0:10:,000
Well, maybe it's because that generation has more debt

220
0:10:00.983,000 --> 0:10:02,000
than any generation before them, coming out of college,

221
0:10:03.887,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and they just need the money

222
0:10:06.284,000 --> 0:10:07,000
to keep going, to pay rent.

223
0:10:08.847,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And suddenly, when you meet people in their onlyness,

224
0:10:11.713,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that spot in the world only they stand,

225
0:10:13.61,000 --> 0:10:15,000
we're not talking about a generation anymore.

226
0:10:15.736,000 --> 0:10:18,000
We're talking about Jim or Jen or Candice.

227
0:10:19.76,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And so here's my challenge to us.

228
0:10:21.855,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Pick a person, just one, and explore their onlyness.

229
0:10:25.744,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And then learn.

230
0:10:26.919,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And then in the moments where it's appropriate, teach.

231
0:10:29.474,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And figure out what they bring to work that no one else can bring to work,

232
0:10:33.013,000 --> 0:10:34,000
because that's what makes work richer.

233
0:10:34.895,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And then do it again.

234
0:10:36.32,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And do it again.

235
0:10:37.52,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And then some day, we're not working with generations anymore.

236
0:10:40.465,000 --> 0:10:41,000
We're working with people.

237
0:10:42.172,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And so to really understand the beauty of the multigenerational workplace,

238
0:10:45.688,000 --> 0:10:47,000
I think we just have to meet people where they are.

239
0:10:48.403,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And that doesn't require that we unpack and live there with them.

240
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
But we might find, at least on occasion, it's a beautiful place to visit.

241
0:10:56.331,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And so I think there's just no need

242
0:10:58.61,000 --> 0:11:,000
to argue about which generation is the most angry

243
0:11:01.41,000 --> 0:11:03,000
or the most entitled or the most so obsessed with food.

244
0:11:04.966,000 --> 0:11:06,000
We all come to the classroom, to work, back to our homes,

245
0:11:07.934,000 --> 0:11:09,000
a little bit tired and a little bit tattered sometimes.

246
0:11:11.093,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Maybe let's just do our best to humbly meet people where they are,

247
0:11:14.226,000 --> 0:11:15,000
how they show up that day,

248
0:11:15.887,000 --> 0:11:16,000
generation and all.

249
0:11:17.665,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And in those moments

250
0:11:18.839,000 --> 0:11:21,000
where it can feel a little bit like intergenerational warfare,

251
0:11:22.609,000 --> 0:11:24,000
I think we can at least all agree

252
0:11:25.294,000 --> 0:11:27,000
that shoulder pads aren't the solution.

253
0:11:27.556,000 --> 0:11:28,000
(Laughter)

254
0:11:29.119,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Thank you.

255
0:11:30.302,000 --> 0:11:33,000
(Applause)

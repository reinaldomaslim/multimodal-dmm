1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Thank you for putting up these pictures of my colleagues over here.

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
(Laughter) We'll be talking about them.

3
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Now, I'm going try an experiment. I don't do experiments, normally. I'm a theorist.

4
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But I'm going see what happens if I press this button.

5
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Sure enough. OK. I used to work in this field of elementary particles.

6
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
What happens to matter if you chop it up very fine?

7
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
What is it made of?

8
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And the laws of these particles are valid throughout the universe,

9
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and they're very much connected with the history of the universe.

10
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
We know a lot about four forces. There must be a lot more,

11
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
but those are at very, very small distances,

12
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and we haven't really interacted with them very much yet.

13
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
The main thing I want to talk about is this:

14
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that we have this remarkable experience in this field of fundamental physics

15
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that beauty is a very successful criterion for choosing the right theory.

16
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And why on earth could that be so?

17
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Well, here's an example from my own experience.

18
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
It's fairly dramatic, actually, to have this happen.

19
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Three or four of us, in 1957,

20
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
put forward a partially complete theory of one of these forces, this weak force.

21
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And it was in disagreement with seven -- seven, count them, seven experiments.

22
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Experiments were all wrong.

23
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And we published before knowing that,

24
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
because we figured it was so beautiful, it's gotta be right!

25
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
The experiments had to be wrong, and they were.

26
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Now our friend over there, Albert Einstein,

27
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
used to pay very little attention when people said,

28
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
"You know, there's a man with an experiment that seems to disagree with special relativity.

29
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
DC Miller. What about that?" And he would say, "Aw, that'll go away." (Laughter)

30
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Now, why does stuff like that work? That's the question.

31
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Now, yeah, what do we mean by beautiful? That's one thing.

32
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I'll try to make that clear -- partially clear.

33
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Why should it work, and is this something to do with human beings?

34
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I'll let you in on the answer to the last one that I offer,

35
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and that is, it has nothing to do with human beings.

36
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Somewhere in some other planet, orbiting some very distant star,

37
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
maybe in a another galaxy,

38
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
there could well be entities that are at least as intelligent as we are,

39
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and are interested in science. It's not impossible; I think there probably are lots.

40
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Very likely, none is close enough to interact with us.

41
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
But they could be out there, very easily.

42
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And suppose they have, you know, very different sensory apparatus, and so on.

43
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
They have seven tentacles, and they have 14 little funny-looking compound eyes,

44
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and a brain shaped like a pretzel.

45
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Would they really have different laws?

46
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
There are lots of people who believe that, and I think it is utter baloney.

47
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I think there are laws out there,

48
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and we of course don't understand them at any given time very well

49
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
-- but we try. And we try to get closer and closer.

50
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And someday, we may actually figure out the fundamental unified theory

51
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
of the particles and forces, what I call the "fundamental law."

52
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
We may not even be terribly far from it.

53
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
But even if we don't run across it in our lifetimes,

54
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
we can still think there is one out there,

55
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and we're just trying to get closer and closer to it.

56
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I think that's the main point to be made.

57
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
We express these things mathematically.

58
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And when the mathematics is very simple --

59
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
when in terms of some mathematical notation,

60
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
you can write the theory in a very brief space, without a lot of complication --

61
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that's essentially what we mean by beauty or elegance.

62
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Here's what I was saying about the laws. They're really there.

63
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Newton certainly believed that.

64
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And he said, here, "It is the business of natural philosophy to find out those laws."

65
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
The basic law, let's say -- here's an assumption.

66
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
The assumption is that the basic law really takes the form

67
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
of a unified theory of all the particles.

68
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Now, some people call that a theory of everything.

69
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
That's wrong because the theory is quantum mechanical.

70
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And I won't go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and what it's like, and so on.

71
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
You've heard a lot of wrong things about it anyway. (Laughter)

72
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
There are even movies about it with a lot of wrong stuff.

73
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
But the main thing here is that it predicts probabilities.

74
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Now, sometimes those probabilities are near certainties.

75
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And in a lot of familiar cases, they of course are.

76
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
But other times they're not, and you have only probabilities for different outcomes.

77
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So what that means is that the history of the universe is not determined just by the fundamental law.

78
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
It's the fundamental law and this incredibly long series of accidents,

79
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
or chance outcomes, that are there in addition.

80
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And the fundamental theory doesn't include those chance outcomes; they are in addition.

81
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So it's not a theory of everything. And in fact, a huge amount of the information

82
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
in the universe around us comes from those accidents,

83
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and not just from the fundamental laws.

84
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Now, it's often said that getting closer and closer

85
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
to the fundamental laws by examining phenomena at low energies, and then higher energies,

86
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and then higher energies, or short distances, and then shorter distances,

87
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and then still shorter distances, and so on, is like peeling the skin of an onion.

88
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And we keep doing that,

89
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and build more powerful machines, accelerators for particles.

90
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
We look deeper and deeper into the structure of particles,

91
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and in that way we get probably closer and closer to this fundamental law.

92
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Now, what happens is that as we do that, as we peel these skins of the onion,

93
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and we get closer and closer to the underlying law,

94
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
we see that each skin has something in common with the previous one,

95
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and with the next one. We write them out mathematically,

96
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and we see they use very similar mathematics.

97
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
They require very similar mathematics.

98
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
That is absolutely remarkable, and that is a central feature

99
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
of what I'm trying to say today.

100
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Newton called it -- that's Newton, by the way -- that one.

101
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
This one is Albert Einstein. Hi, Al! And anyway,

102
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
he said, "nature conformable to herself" -- personifying nature as a female.

103
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And so what happens is that the new phenomena,

104
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
the new skins, the inner skins of the slightly smaller skins of the onion

105
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that we get to, resemble the slightly larger ones.

106
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And the kind of mathematics that we had for the previous skin

107
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
is almost the same as what we need for the next skin.

108
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And that's why the equations look so simple.

109
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Because they use mathematics we already have.

110
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
A trivial example is this: Newton found the law of gravity,

111
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
which goes like one over the square of the distance between the things gravitated.

112
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Coulomb, in France, found the same law for electric charges.

113
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Here's an example of this similarity.

114
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
You look at gravity, you see a certain law.

115
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Then you look at electricity. Sure enough. The same rule.

116
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
It's a very simple example.

117
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
There are lots of more sophisticated examples.

118
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Symmetry is very important in this discussion.

119
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
You know what it means. A circle, for example,

120
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
is symmetric under rotations about the center of the circle.

121
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
You rotate around the center of the circle, the circle remains unchanged.

122
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
You take a sphere, in three dimensions, you rotate around the center of the sphere,

123
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and all those rotations leave the sphere alone.

124
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
They are symmetries of the sphere.

125
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So we say, in general, that there's a symmetry

126
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
under certain operations if those operations leave the phenomenon,

127
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
or its description, unchanged.

128
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Maxwell's equations are of course symmetrical

129
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
under rotations of all of space.

130
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Doesn't matter if we turn the whole of space around by some angle,

131
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
it doesn't leave the -- doesn't change the phenomenon of electricity or magnetism.

132
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
There's a new notation in the 19th century that expressed this,

133
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and if you use that notation, the equations get a lot simpler.

134
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Then Einstein, with his special theory of relativity,

135
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
looked at a whole set of symmetries of Maxwell's equations,

136
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
which are called special relativity.

137
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And those symmetries, then, make the equations even shorter, and even prettier, therefore.

138
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Let's look. You don't have to know what these things mean, doesn't make any difference.

139
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
But you can just look at the form. (Laughter) You can look at the form.

140
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
You see above, at the top, a long list

141
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
of equations with three components for the three directions of space: x, y and z.

142
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Then, using vector analysis, you use rotational symmetry, and you get this next set.

143
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Then you use the symmetry of special relativity and you get an even simpler set

144
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
down here, showing that symmetry exhibits better and better.

145
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
The more and more symmetry you have, the better you exhibit the simplicity and elegance of the theory.

146
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
The last two, the first equation says that electric charges and currents

147
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
give rise to all the electric and magnetic fields.

148
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
The next -- second -- equation says that there is no magnetism other than that.

149
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
The only magnetism comes from electric charges and currents.

150
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Someday we may find some slight hole in that argument.

151
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
But for the moment, that's the case.

152
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Now, here is a very exciting development that many people have not heard of.

153
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
They should have heard of it, but it's a little tricky to explain in technical detail,

154
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
so I won't do it. I'll just mention it. (Laughter)

155
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
But Chen Ning Yang, called by us "Frank" Yang -- (Laughter)

156
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
-- and Bob Mills put forward, 50 years ago,

157
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
this generalization of Maxwell's equations, with a new symmetry.

158
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
A whole new symmetry.

159
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Mathematics very similar, but there was a whole new symmetry.

160
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
They hoped that this would contribute somehow to particle physics

161
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
-- didn't. It didn't, by itself, contribute to particle physics.

162
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
But then some of us generalized it further. And then it did!

163
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And it gave a very beautiful description of the strong force and of the weak force.

164
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So here we say, again, what we said before:

165
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
that each skin of the onion shows a similarity to the adjoining skins.

166
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
So the mathematics for the adjoining skins is very similar to what we need for the new one.

167
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And therefore it looks beautiful

168
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
because we already know how to write it in a lovely, concise way.

169
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
So here are the themes. We believe there is a unified theory underlying all the regularities.

170
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Steps toward unification exhibit the simplicity.

171
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Symmetry exhibits the simplicity.

172
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And then there is self-similarity across the scales -- in other words,

173
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
from one skin of the onion to another one.

174
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Proximate self-similarity. And that accounts for this phenomenon.

175
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
That will account for why beauty is a successful criterion for selecting the right theory.

176
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Here's what Newton himself said:

177
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
"Nature is very consonant and conformable to her self."

178
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
One thing he was thinking of is something that most of us take for granted today,

179
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
but in his day it wasn't taken for granted.

180
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
There's the story, which is not absolutely certain to be right, but a lot of people told it.

181
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Four sources told it. That when they had the plague in Cambridge,

182
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and he went down to his mother's farm -- because the university was closed --

183
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
he saw an apple fall from a tree, or on his head or something.

184
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And he realized suddenly that the force that drew the apple down to the earth

185
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
could be the same as the force regulating the motions of the planets and the moon.

186
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
That was a big unification for those days, although today we take it for granted.

187
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
It's the same theory of gravity.

188
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
So he said that this principle of nature, consonance:

189
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
"This principle of nature being very remote from the conceptions of philosophers,

190
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
I forbore to describe it in that book,

191
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
lest I should be accounted an extravagant freak ... "

192
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
That's what we all have to watch out for, (Laughter) especially at this meeting.

193
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
" ... and so prejudice my readers against all those things which were the main design of the book."

194
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Now, who today would claim that as a mere conceit of the human mind?

195
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
That the force that causes the apple to fall to the ground

196
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
is the same force that causes the planets and the moon to move around,

197
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and so on? Everybody knows that. It's a property of gravitation.

198
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
It's not something in the human mind. The human mind can, of course, appreciate it

199
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and enjoy it, use it, but it's not -- it doesn't stem from the human mind.

200
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
It stems from the character of gravity.

201
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
And that's true of all the things we're talking about.

202
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
They are properties of the fundamental law.

203
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
The fundamental law is such that the different skins of the onion resemble one another,

204
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and therefore the math for one skin allows you to express beautifully and simply

205
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
the phenomenon of the next skin.

206
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
I say here that Newton did a lot of things that year:

207
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
gravity, the laws of motion, the calculus, white light composed of all the colors of the rainbow.

208
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And he could have written quite an essay on "What I Did Over My Summer Vacation."

209
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
(Laughter)

210
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
So we don't have to assume these principles as separate metaphysical postulates.

211
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
They follow from the fundamental theory.

212
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
They are what we call emergent properties.

213
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
You don't need -- you don't need something more to get something more.

214
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
That's what emergence means.

215
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Life can emerge from physics and chemistry, plus a lot of accidents.

216
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
The human mind can arise from neurobiology and a lot of accidents,

217
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
the way the chemical bond arises from physics and certain accidents.

218
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
It doesn't diminish the importance of these subjects

219
0:15:20.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
to know that they follow from more fundamental things, plus accidents.

220
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
That's a general rule, and it's critically important to realize that.

221
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:35,000
You don't need something more in order to get something more.

222
0:15:35.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
People keep asking that when they read my book, "The Quark and the Jaguar,"

223
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and they say, "Isn't there something more beyond what you have there?"

224
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Presumably, they mean something supernatural.

225
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Anyway, there isn't. (Laughter)

226
0:15:49.16,000 --> 0:15:54,000
You don't need something more to explain something more.

227
0:15:54.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Thank you very much. (Applause)

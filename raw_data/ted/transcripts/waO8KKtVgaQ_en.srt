1
0:00:13.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
We are going to talk today about the sequel of "Inconvenient Truth."

2
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
It's time again to talk about "Inconvenient Truth,"

3
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
a truth that everyone is concerned about,

4
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
but nobody is willing to talk about.

5
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Somebody has to take the lead, and I decided to do it.

6
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
If you are scared by global warming,

7
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
wait until we learn about local warming.

8
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
We will talk today about local warming.

9
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Important health message: blogging may be hazardous to your health,

10
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
especially if you are a male.

11
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
This message is given as a public service.

12
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Blogging affects your posture. We start with the posture.

13
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
This is the posture of ladies who are not blogging;

14
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
this is the posture of ladies who are blogging.

15
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
(Laughter)

16
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
This is the natural posture of a man sitting,

17
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
squatting for ventilation purposes.

18
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And this is the natural posture of a standing man,

20
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and I think this picture inspired Chris to insert me

21
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
into the lateral thinking session.

22
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
This is male blogging posture sitting, and the result is,

23
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
"For greater comfort,

24
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
men naturally sit with their legs farther apart than women,

25
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
when working on laptop.

26
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
However, they will adopt a less natural posture

27
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
in order to balance it on their laps,

28
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
which resulted in a significant rise of body heat

29
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
between their thighs." This is the issue of local warming.

30
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
This is a very serious newspaper; it's Times of England --

32
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
very serious. This is a very --

33
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
-- gentlemen and ladies, be serious.

35
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
This is a very serious research, that you should read the underline.

36
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And be careful, your genes are in danger.

37
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Will geeks become endangered species?

38
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
The fact: population growth in countries with high laptop --

39
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I need Hans Rosling to give me a graph.

41
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
(Applause)

42
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Global warming fun.

43
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
But let's keep things in proportion.

45
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
How to take care in five easy steps:

46
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
first of all, you can use natural ventilation. You can use body breath.

47
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
You should stay cool with the appropriate clothing.

48
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
You should care about your posture -- this is not right.

49
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Can you extract from Chris another minute and a half for me,

50
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
because I have a video I have to show you.

51
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
(Applause)

52
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
You are great. This is the correct posture.

53
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Another benefit of Wi-Fi, we learned yesterday about the benefits of Wi-Fi.

54
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Wi-Fi enables you to avoid the processor. And there are some enhanced

55
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
protection measures, which I would like to share with you,

56
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and I would like, in a minute, to thank Philips for helping.

57
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
This is a research which was done in '86, but it's still valid.

58
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Scrotal temperature reflects intratesticular temperature

59
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and is lowered by shaving.

60
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
By the way, I must admit, my English is not so good,

61
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I didn't know what is scrotal; I understand it's a scrotum.

62
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I guess in plural it's scrotal, like medium and media.

63
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Digital scrotum, digital media.

64
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And only last year I recognized that I'm a proud scrotum owner.

65
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And this research is being precipitated by the U.S. government,

67
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
so you can see that your tax man is working for good causes.

68
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Video: Man: The Philips Bodygroom has a sleek,

69
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
ergonomic design for a safe and easy way to trim

70
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
those scruffy underarm hairs, the untidy curls on and around your

71
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
[bleep], as well as the hard to reach locks on the underside of your

72
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
[bleep] and [bleep]. Once you use the Bodygroom, the world looks different.

73
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And so does your [bleep]. These days, with a hair-free back,

74
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
well-groomed shoulders and an extra optical inch on my [bleep],

75
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
well, let's just say life has gotten pretty darn cozy.

76
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Yossi Vardi: This is one of the most popular viral advertisement of last year,

77
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
known as the optical inch by Philips. Let's applaud Philips --

78
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
(Applause)

79
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
-- for this gesture for humanity.

80
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And this is how they are promoting the product. This is --

81
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I didn't touch it, this is original.

82
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Laptop use to solve overpopulation. And if everything failed,

83
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
there are some secondary uses.

84
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And then our next talk, our next TED if you invite me

85
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
will be why you should not carry a cell phone in your pocket.

86
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And this is what the young generation says.

87
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
(Applause)

88
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And I just want to show you that I'm not just preaching,

89
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
but I also practice.

90
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
(Laughter)

91
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
4 am in the morning.

92
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
(Laughter)

93
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
You cannot use this picture.

94
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Applause)

95
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Now, I have some mini TED Prizes, this is the Philips Bodygroom,

96
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
one for our leader.

97
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
(Applause)

98
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Anybody feels threatened, anybody really need it?

99
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
(Laughter)

100
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Any lady, any lady? Thank you very much.

101
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
(Applause)

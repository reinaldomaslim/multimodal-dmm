Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast

2
0:00:12.643,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Once upon a time,

3
0:00:15.535,000 --> 0:00:18,000
there was a place called Lesterland.

4
0:00:18.975,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Now Lesterland looks a lot like the United States.

5
0:00:21.93,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Like the United States, it has about 311 million people,

6
0:00:26.667,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and of that 311 million people,

7
0:00:29.005,000 --> 0:00:33,000
it turns out 144,000 are called Lester.

8
0:00:33.888,000 --> 0:00:34,000
If Matt's in the audience,

9
0:00:35.016,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I just borrowed that, I'll return it in a second,

10
0:00:37.706,000 --> 0:00:39,000
this character from your series.

11
0:00:40.371,000 --> 0:00:42,000
So 144,000 are called Lester,

12
0:00:42.794,000 --> 0:00:46,000
which means about .05 percent is named Lester.

13
0:00:47.074,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Now, Lesters in Lesterland have this extraordinary power.

14
0:00:50.802,000 --> 0:00:53,000
There are two elections every election cycle in Lesterland.

15
0:00:53.965,000 --> 0:00:55,000
One is called the general election.

16
0:00:56.178,000 --> 0:00:59,000
The other is called the Lester election.

17
0:00:59.519,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And in the general election, it's the citizens who get to vote,

18
0:01:02.504,000 --> 0:01:05,000
but in the Lester election, it's the Lesters who get to vote.

19
0:01:05.776,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And here's the trick.

20
0:01:06.91,000 --> 0:01:09,000
In order to run in the general election,

21
0:01:10.561,000 --> 0:01:12,000
you must do extremely well

22
0:01:13.107,000 --> 0:01:14,000
in the Lester election.

23
0:01:14.48,000 --> 0:01:17,000
You don't necessarily have to win, but you must do extremely well.

24
0:01:17.581,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Now, what can we say about democracy in Lesterland?

25
0:01:21.531,000 --> 0:01:22,000
What we can say, number one,

26
0:01:22.924,000 --> 0:01:24,000
as the Supreme Court said in Citizens United,

27
0:01:25.56,000 --> 0:01:29,000
that people have the ultimate influence over elected officials,

28
0:01:29.838,000 --> 0:01:31,000
because, after all, there is a general election,

29
0:01:32.486,000 --> 0:01:34,000
but only after the Lesters have had their way

30
0:01:35.438,000 --> 0:01:38,000
with the candidates who wish to run in the general election.

31
0:01:38.94,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And number two, obviously, this dependence upon the Lesters

32
0:01:42.543,000 --> 0:01:44,000
is going to produce a subtle, understated,

33
0:01:45.305,000 --> 0:01:47,000
we could say camouflaged, bending

34
0:01:47.734,000 --> 0:01:5,000
to keep the Lesters happy.

35
0:01:50.925,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Okay, so we have a democracy, no doubt,

36
0:01:54.194,000 --> 0:01:55,000
but it's dependent upon the Lesters

37
0:01:55.87,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and dependent upon the people.

38
0:01:57.88,000 --> 0:01:59,000
It has competing dependencies,

39
0:02:00.522,000 --> 0:02:02,000
we could say conflicting dependencies,

40
0:02:02.932,000 --> 0:02:06,000
depending upon who the Lesters are.

41
0:02:07.202,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Okay. That's Lesterland.

42
0:02:09.546,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Now there are three things I want you to see now that I've described Lesterland.

43
0:02:12.305,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Number one, the United States is Lesterland.

44
0:02:15.546,000 --> 0:02:16,000
The United States is Lesterland.

45
0:02:17.422,000 --> 0:02:19,000
The United States also looks like this, also has two elections,

46
0:02:19.803,000 --> 0:02:22,000
one we called the general election,

47
0:02:22.942,000 --> 0:02:25,000
the second we should call the money election.

48
0:02:26.186,000 --> 0:02:28,000
In the general election, it's the citizens who get to vote,

49
0:02:28.352,000 --> 0:02:3,000
if you're over 18, in some states if you have an ID.

50
0:02:30.946,000 --> 0:02:33,000
In the money election, it's the funders who get to vote,

51
0:02:34.162,000 --> 0:02:36,000
the funders who get to vote, and just like in Lesterland,

52
0:02:36.922,000 --> 0:02:38,000
the trick is, to run in the general election,

53
0:02:39.081,000 --> 0:02:41,000
you must do extremely well in the money election.

54
0:02:41.901,000 --> 0:02:43,000
You don't necessarily have to win. There is Jerry Brown.

55
0:02:44.522,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But you must do extremely well.

56
0:02:47.074,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And here's the key: There are just as few relevant funders

57
0:02:51.602,000 --> 0:02:56,000
in USA-land as there are Lesters in Lesterland.

58
0:02:57.091,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Now you say, really?

59
0:02:58.995,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Really .05 percent?

60
0:03:02.138,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Well, here are the numbers from 2010:

61
0:03:04.354,000 --> 0:03:06,000
.26 percent of America

62
0:03:06.65,000 --> 0:03:08,000
gave 200 dollars or more to any federal candidate,

63
0:03:09.386,000 --> 0:03:13,000
.05 percent gave the maximum amount to any federal candidate,

64
0:03:13.85,000 --> 0:03:16,000
.01 percent -- the one percent of the one percent --

65
0:03:17.282,000 --> 0:03:2,000
gave 10,000 dollars or more to federal candidates,

66
0:03:20.49,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and in this election cycle, my favorite statistic

67
0:03:23.566,000 --> 0:03:26,000
is .000042 percent

68
0:03:27.421,000 --> 0:03:31,000
— for those of you doing the numbers, you know that's 132 Americans —

69
0:03:31.458,000 --> 0:03:34,000
gave 60 percent of the Super PAC money spent

70
0:03:35.418,000 --> 0:03:37,000
in the cycle we have just seen ending.

71
0:03:38.168,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So I'm just a lawyer, I look at this range of numbers,

72
0:03:40.898,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and I say it's fair for me to say

73
0:03:42.607,000 --> 0:03:46,000
it's .05 percent who are our relevant funders in America.

74
0:03:46.858,000 --> 0:03:49,000
In this sense, the funders are our Lesters.

75
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Now, what can we say about this democracy in USA-land?

76
0:03:53.66,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Well, as the Supreme Court said in Citizens United,

77
0:03:56.002,000 --> 0:03:58,000
we could say, of course the people have the ultimate influence

78
0:03:58.839,000 --> 0:04:02,000
over the elected officials. We have a general election,

79
0:04:02.868,000 --> 0:04:05,000
but only after the funders have had their way

80
0:04:06.077,000 --> 0:04:1,000
with the candidates who wish to run in that general election.

81
0:04:10.24,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And number two, obviously,

82
0:04:12.763,000 --> 0:04:14,000
this dependence upon the funders

83
0:04:15.035,000 --> 0:04:18,000
produces a subtle, understated, camouflaged bending

84
0:04:18.967,000 --> 0:04:2,000
to keep the funders happy.

85
0:04:21.604,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Candidates for Congress and members of Congress

86
0:04:24.648,000 --> 0:04:28,000
spend between 30 and 70 percent of their time

87
0:04:28.931,000 --> 0:04:3,000
raising money to get back to Congress

88
0:04:31.107,000 --> 0:04:32,000
or to get their party back into power,

89
0:04:32.882,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and the question we need to ask is, what does it do to them,

90
0:04:36.307,000 --> 0:04:38,000
these humans, as they spend their time

91
0:04:38.424,000 --> 0:04:41,000
behind the telephone, calling people they've never met,

92
0:04:41.843,000 --> 0:04:44,000
but calling the tiniest slice of the one percent?

93
0:04:45.311,000 --> 0:04:47,000
As anyone would, as they do this,

94
0:04:47.679,000 --> 0:04:5,000
they develop a sixth sense, a constant awareness

95
0:04:51.527,000 --> 0:04:54,000
about how what they do might affect their ability to raise money.

96
0:04:54.867,000 --> 0:04:55,000
They become, in the words of "The X-Files,"

97
0:04:56.283,000 --> 0:04:59,000
shape-shifters, as they constantly adjust their views

98
0:04:59.727,000 --> 0:05:01,000
in light of what they know will help them to raise money,

99
0:05:02.589,000 --> 0:05:03,000
not on issues one to 10,

100
0:05:04.158,000 --> 0:05:07,000
but on issues 11 to 1,000.

101
0:05:07.253,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Leslie Byrne, a Democrat from Virginia,

102
0:05:08.967,000 --> 0:05:09,000
describes that when she went to Congress,

103
0:05:10.577,000 --> 0:05:13,000
she was told by a colleague, "Always lean to the green."

104
0:05:14.502,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Then to clarify, she went on,

105
0:05:16.138,000 --> 0:05:2,000
"He was not an environmentalist." (Laughter)

106
0:05:20.832,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So here too we have a democracy,

107
0:05:22.912,000 --> 0:05:24,000
a democracy dependent upon the funders

108
0:05:24.927,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and dependent upon the people,

109
0:05:26.714,000 --> 0:05:28,000
competing dependencies,

110
0:05:28.851,000 --> 0:05:3,000
possibly conflicting dependencies

111
0:05:30.87,000 --> 0:05:33,000
depending upon who the funders are.

112
0:05:34.481,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Okay, the United States is Lesterland, point number one.

113
0:05:37.242,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Here's point number two.

114
0:05:39.253,000 --> 0:05:41,000
The United States is worse than Lesterland,

115
0:05:42.035,000 --> 0:05:44,000
worse than Lesterland because you can imagine in Lesterland

116
0:05:44.916,000 --> 0:05:46,000
if we Lesters got a letter from the government that said,

117
0:05:47.268,000 --> 0:05:5,000
"Hey, you get to pick who gets to run in the general election,"

118
0:05:50.532,000 --> 0:05:54,000
we would think maybe of a kind of aristocracy of Lesters.

119
0:05:54.683,000 --> 0:05:56,000
You know, there are Lesters from every part of social society.

120
0:05:56.972,000 --> 0:05:58,000
There are rich Lesters, poor Lesters, black Lesters, white Lesters,

121
0:05:59.62,000 --> 0:06:01,000
not many women Lesters, but put that to the side for one second.

122
0:06:02.348,000 --> 0:06:04,000
We have Lesters from everywhere. We could think,

123
0:06:04.476,000 --> 0:06:07,000
"What could we do to make Lesterland better?"

124
0:06:07.484,000 --> 0:06:11,000
It's at least possible the Lesters would act for the good of Lesterland.

125
0:06:12.259,000 --> 0:06:15,000
But in our land, in this land, in USA-land,

126
0:06:15.502,000 --> 0:06:17,000
there are certainly some sweet Lesters out there,

127
0:06:18.125,000 --> 0:06:19,000
many of them in this room here today,

128
0:06:20.097,000 --> 0:06:24,000
but the vast majority of Lesters act for the Lesters,

129
0:06:24.581,000 --> 0:06:28,000
because the shifting coalitions that are comprising the .05 percent

130
0:06:28.969,000 --> 0:06:3,000
are not comprising it for the public interest.

131
0:06:31.094,000 --> 0:06:35,000
It's for their private interest. In this sense, the USA is worse than Lesterland.

132
0:06:35.486,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And finally, point number three:

133
0:06:37.907,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Whatever one wants to say about Lesterland,

134
0:06:40.854,000 --> 0:06:42,000
against the background of its history, its traditions,

135
0:06:43.158,000 --> 0:06:47,000
in our land, in USA-land, Lesterland is a corruption,

136
0:06:48.101,000 --> 0:06:49,000
a corruption.

137
0:06:49.574,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Now, by corruption I don't mean brown paper bag cash

138
0:06:53.597,000 --> 0:06:54,000
secreted among members of Congress.

139
0:06:55.465,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I don't mean Rod Blagojevich sense of corruption.

140
0:06:58.525,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I don't mean any criminal act.

141
0:07:00.43,000 --> 0:07:03,000
The corruption I'm talking about is perfectly legal.

142
0:07:03.821,000 --> 0:07:08,000
It's a corruption relative to the framers' baseline for this republic.

143
0:07:08.874,000 --> 0:07:11,000
The framers gave us what they called a republic,

144
0:07:12.369,000 --> 0:07:16,000
but by a republic they meant a representative democracy,

145
0:07:16.551,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and by a representative democracy, they meant a government,

146
0:07:19.738,000 --> 0:07:21,000
as Madison put it in Federalist 52, that would have a branch

147
0:07:22.717,000 --> 0:07:26,000
that would be dependent upon the people alone.

148
0:07:27.662,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So here's the model of government.

149
0:07:28.677,000 --> 0:07:3,000
They have the people and the government

150
0:07:31.282,000 --> 0:07:33,000
with this exclusive dependency,

151
0:07:33.715,000 --> 0:07:37,000
but the problem here is that Congress has evolved a different dependence,

152
0:07:37.818,000 --> 0:07:39,000
no longer a dependence upon the people alone,

153
0:07:40.491,000 --> 0:07:42,000
increasingly a dependence upon the funders.

154
0:07:42.92,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Now this is a dependence too,

155
0:07:46.058,000 --> 0:07:49,000
but it's different and conflicting from a dependence upon the people alone

156
0:07:49.922,000 --> 0:07:53,000
so long as the funders are not the people.

157
0:07:54.228,000 --> 0:07:56,000
This is a corruption.

158
0:07:56.491,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Now, there's good news and bad news about this corruption.

159
0:07:58.991,000 --> 0:08:,000
One bit of good news is that it's bipartisan,

160
0:08:01.355,000 --> 0:08:03,000
equal-opportunity corruption.

161
0:08:03.525,000 --> 0:08:07,000
It blocks the left on a whole range of issues that we on the left really care about.

162
0:08:08.178,000 --> 0:08:1,000
It blocks the right too, as it makes

163
0:08:10.65,000 --> 0:08:13,000
principled arguments of the right increasingly impossible.

164
0:08:14.57,000 --> 0:08:16,000
So the right wants smaller government.

165
0:08:16.762,000 --> 0:08:18,000
When Al Gore was Vice President, his team had an idea

166
0:08:19.458,000 --> 0:08:22,000
for deregulating a significant portion of the telecommunications industry.

167
0:08:23.37,000 --> 0:08:25,000
The chief policy man took this idea to Capitol Hill,

168
0:08:26.05,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and as he reported back to me,

169
0:08:28.083,000 --> 0:08:3,000
the response was, "Hell no!

170
0:08:30.282,000 --> 0:08:31,000
If we deregulate these guys,

171
0:08:32.058,000 --> 0:08:35,000
how are we going to raise money from them?"

172
0:08:35.816,000 --> 0:08:38,000
This is a system that's designed to save the status quo,

173
0:08:39.623,000 --> 0:08:42,000
including the status quo of big and invasive government.

174
0:08:43.256,000 --> 0:08:45,000
It works against the left and the right,

175
0:08:45.706,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and that, you might say, is good news.

176
0:08:47.252,000 --> 0:08:48,000
But here's the bad news.

177
0:08:49.041,000 --> 0:08:52,000
It's a pathological, democracy-destroying corruption,

178
0:08:52.944,000 --> 0:08:54,000
because in any system

179
0:08:55.2,000 --> 0:08:56,000
where the members are dependent upon

180
0:08:57.1,000 --> 0:09:,000
the tiniest fraction of us for their election,

181
0:09:00.272,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that means the tiniest number of us,

182
0:09:03.064,000 --> 0:09:05,000
the tiniest, tiniest number of us,

183
0:09:05.344,000 --> 0:09:06,000
can block reform.

184
0:09:07.055,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I know that should have been, like, a rock or something.

185
0:09:09.953,000 --> 0:09:11,000
I can only find cheese. I'm sorry. So there it is.

186
0:09:11.99,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Block reform.

187
0:09:14.384,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Because there is an economy here, an economy of influence,

188
0:09:18.36,000 --> 0:09:2,000
an economy with lobbyists at the center

189
0:09:20.914,000 --> 0:09:22,000
which feeds on polarization.

190
0:09:23.568,000 --> 0:09:24,000
It feeds on dysfunction.

191
0:09:25.417,000 --> 0:09:27,000
The worse that it is for us,

192
0:09:28.056,000 --> 0:09:31,000
the better that it is for this fundraising.

193
0:09:31.992,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Henry David Thoreau: "There are a thousand hacking

194
0:09:35.104,000 --> 0:09:39,000
at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root."

195
0:09:39.976,000 --> 0:09:42,000
This is the root.

196
0:09:43.369,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Okay, now, every single one of you knows this.

197
0:09:47.512,000 --> 0:09:5,000
You couldn't be here if you didn't know this, yet you ignore it.

198
0:09:51.141,000 --> 0:09:54,000
You ignore it. This is an impossible problem.

199
0:09:54.725,000 --> 0:09:56,000
You focus on the possible problems,

200
0:09:57.273,000 --> 0:10:,000
like eradicating polio from the world,

201
0:10:00.536,000 --> 0:10:03,000
or taking an image of every single street across the globe,

202
0:10:03.67,000 --> 0:10:06,000
or building the first real universal translator,

203
0:10:06.976,000 --> 0:10:09,000
or building a fusion factory in your garage.

204
0:10:10.578,000 --> 0:10:12,000
These are the manageable problems, so you ignore —

205
0:10:13.496,000 --> 0:10:18,000
(Laughter) (Applause) —

206
0:10:19.128,000 --> 0:10:21,000
so you ignore this corruption.

207
0:10:21.577,000 --> 0:10:26,000
But we cannot ignore this corruption anymore.

208
0:10:27.047,000 --> 0:10:3,000
(Applause)

209
0:10:30.152,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We need a government that works.

210
0:10:33.735,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And not works for the left or the right,

211
0:10:36.6,000 --> 0:10:38,000
but works for the left and the right,

212
0:10:39.064,000 --> 0:10:41,000
the citizens of the left and right,

213
0:10:41.096,000 --> 0:10:44,000
because there is no sensible reform possible

214
0:10:44.688,000 --> 0:10:46,000
until we end this corruption.

215
0:10:47.217,000 --> 0:10:51,000
So I want you to take hold, to grab the issue you care the most about.

216
0:10:51.402,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Climate change is mine, but it might be financial reform

217
0:10:53.962,000 --> 0:10:55,000
or a simpler tax system or inequality.

218
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Grab that issue, sit it down in front of you,

219
0:10:58.518,000 --> 0:11:01,000
look straight in its eyes, and tell it there is no Christmas this year.

220
0:11:02.359,000 --> 0:11:03,000
There will never be a Christmas.

221
0:11:04.185,000 --> 0:11:06,000
We will never get your issue solved

222
0:11:06.897,000 --> 0:11:08,000
until we fix this issue first.

223
0:11:09.863,000 --> 0:11:12,000
So it's not that mine is the most important issue. It's not.

224
0:11:13.193,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Yours is the most important issue, but mine is the first issue,

225
0:11:17.369,000 --> 0:11:19,000
the issue we have to solve before we get to fix

226
0:11:20.09,000 --> 0:11:21,000
the issues you care about.

227
0:11:22.063,000 --> 0:11:25,000
No sensible reform, and we cannot afford

228
0:11:25.361,000 --> 0:11:28,000
a world, a future, with no sensible reform.

229
0:11:29.282,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Okay. So how do we do it?

230
0:11:32.153,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Turns out, the analytics here are easy, simple.

231
0:11:35.641,000 --> 0:11:37,000
If the problem is members spending an extraordinary

232
0:11:38.491,000 --> 0:11:41,000
amount of time fundraising from the tiniest slice of America,

233
0:11:41.651,000 --> 0:11:45,000
the solution is to have them spend less time fundraising

234
0:11:45.911,000 --> 0:11:47,000
but fundraise from a wider slice of Americans,

235
0:11:48.579,000 --> 0:11:49,000
to spread it out,

236
0:11:49.752,000 --> 0:11:52,000
to spread the funder influence so that we restore the idea

237
0:11:53.033,000 --> 0:11:56,000
of dependence upon the people alone.

238
0:11:56.225,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And to do this does not require a constitutional amendment,

239
0:11:59.655,000 --> 0:12:,000
changing the First Amendment.

240
0:12:00.914,000 --> 0:12:03,000
To do this would require a single statute,

241
0:12:04.273,000 --> 0:12:06,000
a statute establishing what we think of

242
0:12:06.465,000 --> 0:12:08,000
as small dollar funded elections,

243
0:12:09.161,000 --> 0:12:11,000
a statute of citizen-funded campaigns,

244
0:12:11.369,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and there's any number of these proposals out there:

245
0:12:13.465,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Fair Elections Now Act,

246
0:12:14.911,000 --> 0:12:16,000
the American Anti-Corruption Act,

247
0:12:17.337,000 --> 0:12:2,000
an idea in my book that I call the Grant and Franklin Project

248
0:12:20.427,000 --> 0:12:22,000
to give vouchers to people to fund elections,

249
0:12:22.761,000 --> 0:12:25,000
an idea of John Sarbanes called the Grassroots Democracy Act.

250
0:12:25.956,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Each of these would fix this corruption

251
0:12:30.06,000 --> 0:12:34,000
by spreading out the influence of funders to all of us.

252
0:12:34.409,000 --> 0:12:36,000
The analytics are easy here.

253
0:12:37.067,000 --> 0:12:42,000
It's the politics that's hard, indeed impossibly hard,

254
0:12:42.58,000 --> 0:12:48,000
because this reform would shrink K Street,

255
0:12:48.939,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and Capitol Hill, as Congressman Jim Cooper,

256
0:12:53.799,000 --> 0:12:55,000
a Democrat from Tennessee, put it,

257
0:12:56.779,000 --> 0:13:,000
has become a farm league for K Street, a farm league for K Street.

258
0:13:01.599,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Members and staffers and bureaucrats have

259
0:13:03.564,000 --> 0:13:05,000
an increasingly common business model in their head,

260
0:13:05.775,000 --> 0:13:08,000
a business model focused on their life after government,

261
0:13:08.843,000 --> 0:13:1,000
their life as lobbyists.

262
0:13:11.164,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Fifty percent of the Senate between 1998 and 2004

263
0:13:14.71,000 --> 0:13:16,000
left to become lobbyists, 42 percent of the House.

264
0:13:17.368,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Those numbers have only gone up,

265
0:13:18.844,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and as United Republic calculated last April,

266
0:13:21.19,000 --> 0:13:24,000
the average increase in salary for those who they tracked

267
0:13:24.403,000 --> 0:13:29,000
was 1,452 percent.

268
0:13:29.765,000 --> 0:13:35,000
So it's fair to ask, how is it possible for them to change this?

269
0:13:36.131,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Now I get this skepticism.

270
0:13:40.195,000 --> 0:13:44,000
I get this cynicism. I get this sense of impossibility.

271
0:13:45.131,000 --> 0:13:47,000
But I don't buy it.

272
0:13:47.459,000 --> 0:13:5,000
This is a solvable issue.

273
0:13:51.307,000 --> 0:13:54,000
If you think about the issues our parents tried to solve

274
0:13:54.467,000 --> 0:13:55,000
in the 20th century,

275
0:13:56.306,000 --> 0:13:59,000
issues like racism, or sexism,

276
0:13:59.587,000 --> 0:14:02,000
or the issue that we've been fighting in this century, homophobia,

277
0:14:02.7,000 --> 0:14:04,000
those are hard issues.

278
0:14:05.187,000 --> 0:14:07,000
You don't wake up one day no longer a racist.

279
0:14:08.107,000 --> 0:14:12,000
It takes generations to tear that intuition, that DNA,

280
0:14:12.418,000 --> 0:14:14,000
out of the soul of a people.

281
0:14:14.863,000 --> 0:14:17,000
But this is a problem of just incentives, just incentives.

282
0:14:18.108,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Change the incentives, and the behavior changes,

283
0:14:20.651,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and the states that have adopted small dollar funded systems

284
0:14:23.338,000 --> 0:14:26,000
have seen overnight a change in the practice.

285
0:14:26.468,000 --> 0:14:27,000
When Connecticut adopted this system,

286
0:14:28.449,000 --> 0:14:32,000
in the very first year, 78 percent of elected representatives

287
0:14:32.639,000 --> 0:14:36,000
gave up large contributions and took small contributions only.

288
0:14:36.886,000 --> 0:14:37,000
It's solvable,

289
0:14:38.865,000 --> 0:14:4,000
not by being a Democrat,

290
0:14:41.675,000 --> 0:14:42,000
not by being a Republican.

291
0:14:43.47,000 --> 0:14:46,000
It's solvable by being citizens, by being citizens,

292
0:14:47.122,000 --> 0:14:49,000
by being TEDizens.

293
0:14:50.105,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Because if you want to kickstart reform,

294
0:14:54.442,000 --> 0:14:57,000
look, I could kickstart reform

295
0:14:57.893,000 --> 0:15:,000
at half the price of fixing energy policy,

296
0:15:01.481,000 --> 0:15:03,000
I could give you back a republic.

297
0:15:04.263,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Okay. But even if you're not yet with me,

298
0:15:07.907,000 --> 0:15:1,000
even if you believe this is impossible,

299
0:15:11.492,000 --> 0:15:14,000
what the five years since I spoke at TED has taught me

300
0:15:14.929,000 --> 0:15:16,000
as I've spoken about this issue again and again is,

301
0:15:17.527,000 --> 0:15:2,000
even if you think it's impossible, that is irrelevant.

302
0:15:21.353,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Irrelevant.

303
0:15:23.341,000 --> 0:15:26,000
I spoke at Dartmouth once, and a woman stood up after I spoke,

304
0:15:26.909,000 --> 0:15:27,000
I write in my book, and she said to me,

305
0:15:28.752,000 --> 0:15:33,000
"Professor, you've convinced me this is hopeless. Hopeless.

306
0:15:34.445,000 --> 0:15:36,000
There's nothing we can do."

307
0:15:37.295,000 --> 0:15:38,000
When she said that, I scrambled.

308
0:15:39.22,000 --> 0:15:41,000
I tried to think, "How do I respond to that hopelessness?

309
0:15:41.362,000 --> 0:15:42,000
What is that sense of hopelessness?"

310
0:15:43.025,000 --> 0:15:47,000
And what hit me was an image of my six-year-old son.

311
0:15:47.887,000 --> 0:15:5,000
And I imagined a doctor coming to me and saying,

312
0:15:51.072,000 --> 0:15:58,000
"Your son has terminal brain cancer, and there's nothing you can do.

313
0:15:58.381,000 --> 0:16:,000
Nothing you can do."

314
0:16:00.635,000 --> 0:16:03,000
So would I do nothing?

315
0:16:03.73,000 --> 0:16:05,000
Would I just sit there? Accept it? Okay, nothing I can do?

316
0:16:06.102,000 --> 0:16:09,000
I'm going off to build Google Glass.

317
0:16:09.925,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Of course not. I would do everything I could,

318
0:16:13.571,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and I would do everything I could because this is what love means,

319
0:16:17.151,000 --> 0:16:19,000
that the odds are irrelevant and that you do

320
0:16:19.467,000 --> 0:16:22,000
whatever the hell you can, the odds be damned.

321
0:16:23.046,000 --> 0:16:26,000
And then I saw the obvious link, because even we liberals

322
0:16:26.887,000 --> 0:16:28,000
love this country.

323
0:16:29.146,000 --> 0:16:31,000
(Laughter)

324
0:16:32.119,000 --> 0:16:34,000
And so when the pundits and the politicians

325
0:16:34.379,000 --> 0:16:36,000
say that change is impossible,

326
0:16:36.689,000 --> 0:16:39,000
what this love of country says back is,

327
0:16:39.751,000 --> 0:16:41,000
"That's just irrelevant."

328
0:16:42.487,000 --> 0:16:44,000
We lose something dear,

329
0:16:44.527,000 --> 0:16:47,000
something everyone in this room loves and cherishes,

330
0:16:47.734,000 --> 0:16:5,000
if we lose this republic, and so we act

331
0:16:51.682,000 --> 0:16:56,000
with everything we can to prove these pundits wrong.

332
0:16:56.976,000 --> 0:16:58,000
So here's my question:

333
0:16:59.412,000 --> 0:17:03,000
Do you have that love?

334
0:17:04.023,000 --> 0:17:06,000
Do you have that love?

335
0:17:06.848,000 --> 0:17:07,000
Because if you do,

336
0:17:08.531,000 --> 0:17:13,000
then what the hell are you, what are the hell are we doing?

337
0:17:13.92,000 --> 0:17:17,000
When Ben Franklin was carried from the constitutional convention

338
0:17:18.46,000 --> 0:17:22,000
in September of 1787, he was stopped in the street by a woman who said,

339
0:17:22.466,000 --> 0:17:25,000
"Mr. Franklin, what have you wrought?"

340
0:17:25.924,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Franklin said, "A republic, madam, if you can keep it."

341
0:17:33.685,000 --> 0:17:37,000
A republic. A representative democracy.

342
0:17:38.584,000 --> 0:17:45,000
A government dependent upon the people alone.

343
0:17:45.793,000 --> 0:17:49,000
We have lost that republic.

344
0:17:50.378,000 --> 0:17:54,000
All of us have to act to get it back.

345
0:17:54.726,000 --> 0:17:55,000
Thank you very much.

346
0:17:56.37,000 --> 0:18:02,000
(Applause)

347
0:18:02.423,000 --> 0:18:12,000
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Embracing otherness.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
When I first heard this theme,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I thought, well, embracing otherness

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
is embracing myself.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And the journey to that place

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
of understanding and acceptance

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
has been an interesting one for me,

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and it's given me an insight

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
into the whole notion of self,

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
which I think is worth sharing with you today.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
We each have a self,

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
but I don't think that we're born with one.

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
You know how newborn babies

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
believe they're part of everything;

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
they're not separate?

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Well that fundamental sense of oneness

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
is lost on us very quickly.

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It's like that initial stage is over --

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
oneness: infancy,

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
unformed, primitive.

21
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
It's no longer valid or real.

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
What is real is separateness,

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and at some point in early babyhood,

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
the idea of self

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
starts to form.

26
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Our little portion of oneness is given a name,

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
is told all kinds of things about itself,

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and these details,

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
opinions and ideas

30
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
become facts,

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
which go towards building ourselves,

32
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
our identity.

33
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And that self becomes the vehicle

34
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
for navigating our social world.

35
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
But the self is a projection

36
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
based on other people's projections.

37
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Is it who we really are?

38
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Or who we really want to be, or should be?

39
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So this whole interaction

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
with self and identity

41
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
was a very difficult one for me growing up.

42
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
The self that I attempted to take out into the world

43
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
was rejected over and over again.

44
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
And my panic

45
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
at not having a self that fit,

46
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and the confusion that came

47
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
from my self being rejected,

48
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
created anxiety, shame

49
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and hopelessness,

50
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
which kind of defined me for a long time.

51
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
But in retrospect,

52
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
the destruction of my self was so repetitive

53
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that I started to see a pattern.

54
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
The self changed,

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
got affected, broken, destroyed,

56
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
but another one would evolve --

57
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
sometimes stronger,

58
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
sometimes hateful,

59
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
sometimes not wanting to be there at all.

60
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
The self was not constant.

61
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And how many times

62
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
would my self have to die

63
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
before I realized

64
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
that it was never alive in the first place?

65
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I grew up on the coast of England

66
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
in the '70s.

67
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
My dad is white from Cornwall,

68
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
and my mom is black from Zimbabwe.

69
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Even the idea of us as a family

70
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
was challenging to most people.

71
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
But nature had its wicked way,

72
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and brown babies were born.

73
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
But from about the age of five,

74
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I was aware that I didn't fit.

75
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I was the black atheist kid

76
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
in the all-white Catholic school run by nuns.

77
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I was an anomaly,

78
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and my self was rooting around for definition

79
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and trying to plug in.

80
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Because the self likes to fit,

81
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
to see itself replicated,

82
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to belong.

83
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
That confirms its existence

84
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and its importance.

85
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And it is important.

86
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
It has an extremely important function.

87
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Without it, we literally can't interface with others.

88
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
We can't hatch plans

89
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and climb that stairway of popularity,

90
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
of success.

91
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
But my skin color wasn't right.

92
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
My hair wasn't right.

93
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
My history wasn't right.

94
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
My self became defined

95
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
by otherness,

96
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
which meant that, in that social world,

97
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I didn't really exist.

98
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And I was "other" before being anything else --

99
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
even before being a girl.

100
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I was a noticeable nobody.

101
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Another world was opening up

102
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
around this time:

103
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
performance and dancing.

104
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
That nagging dread of self-hood

105
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
didn't exist when I was dancing.

106
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I'd literally lose myself.

107
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And I was a really good dancer.

108
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I would put

109
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
all my emotional expression

110
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
into my dancing.

111
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I could be in the movement

112
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
in a way that I wasn't able to be

113
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
in my real life, in myself.

114
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And at 16,

115
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I stumbled across another opportunity,

116
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and I earned my first acting role in a film.

117
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I can hardly find the words

118
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
to describe the peace I felt

119
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
when I was acting.

120
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
My dysfunctional self

121
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
could actually plug in

122
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
to another self, not my own,

123
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and it felt so good.

124
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
It was the first time that I existed

125
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
inside a fully-functioning self --

126
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
one that I controlled,

127
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
that I steered,

128
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
that I gave life to.

129
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
But the shooting day would end,

130
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and I'd return

131
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
to my gnarly, awkward self.

132
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
By 19,

133
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I was a fully-fledged movie actor,

134
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
but still searching for definition.

135
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I applied to read anthropology

136
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
at university.

137
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Dr. Phyllis Lee gave me my interview,

138
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and she asked me, "How would you define race?"

139
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Well, I thought I had the answer to that one,

140
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and I said, "Skin color."

141
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
"So biology, genetics?" she said.

142
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
"Because, Thandie, that's not accurate.

143
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Because there's actually more genetic difference

144
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
between a black Kenyan

145
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and a black Ugandan

146
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
than there is between a black Kenyan

147
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and, say, a white Norwegian.

148
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Because we all stem from Africa.

149
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So in Africa,

150
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
there's been more time

151
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
to create genetic diversity."

152
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
In other words,

153
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
race has no basis

154
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
in biological or scientific fact.

155
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
On the one hand, result.

156
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Right?

157
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
On the other hand, my definition of self

158
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
just lost a huge chunk of its credibility.

159
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
But what was credible,

160
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
what is biological and scientific fact,

161
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
is that we all stem from Africa --

162
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
in fact, from a woman called Mitochondrial Eve

163
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
who lived 160,000 years ago.

164
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And race is an illegitimate concept

165
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
which our selves have created

166
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
based on fear and ignorance.

167
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Strangely, these revelations

168
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
didn't cure my low self-esteem,

169
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that feeling of otherness.

170
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
My desire to disappear

171
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
was still very powerful.

172
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I had a degree from Cambridge;

173
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I had a thriving career,

174
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
but my self was a car crash,

175
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and I wound up with bulimia

176
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and on a therapist's couch.

177
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And of course I did.

178
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
I still believed

179
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
my self was all I was.

180
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I still valued self-worth

181
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
above all other worth,

182
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and what was there to suggest otherwise?

183
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
We've created entire value systems

184
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and a physical reality

185
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
to support the worth of self.

186
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Look at the industry for self-image

187
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and the jobs it creates,

188
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
the revenue it turns over.

189
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
We'd be right in assuming

190
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
that the self is an actual living thing.

191
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
But it's not. It's a projection

192
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
which our clever brains create

193
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
in order to cheat ourselves

194
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
from the reality of death.

195
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
But there is something

196
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that can give the self

197
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
ultimate and infinite connection --

198
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and that thing is oneness,

199
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
our essence.

200
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
The self's struggle

201
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
for authenticity and definition

202
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
will never end

203
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
unless it's connected to its creator --

204
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
to you and to me.

205
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And that can happen with awareness --

206
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
awareness of the reality of oneness

207
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and the projection of self-hood.

208
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
For a start, we can think about

209
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
all the times when we do lose ourselves.

210
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
It happens when I dance,

211
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
when I'm acting.

212
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
I'm earthed in my essence,

213
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and my self is suspended.

214
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
In those moments,

215
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I'm connected to everything --

216
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
the ground, the air,

217
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
the sounds, the energy from the audience.

218
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
All my senses are alert and alive

219
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
in much the same way as an infant might feel --

220
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that feeling of oneness.

221
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And when I'm acting a role,

222
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I inhabit another self,

223
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and I give it life for awhile,

224
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
because when the self is suspended

225
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
so is divisiveness

226
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and judgment.

227
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And I've played everything

228
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
from a vengeful ghost in the time of slavery

229
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
to Secretary of State in 2004.

230
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And no matter how other

231
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
these selves might be,

232
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
they're all related in me.

233
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And I honestly believe

234
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
the key to my success as an actor

235
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and my progress as a person

236
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
has been the very lack of self

237
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
that used to make me feel

238
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
so anxious and insecure.

239
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
I always wondered

240
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
why I could feel others' pain so deeply,

241
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
why I could recognize

242
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
the somebody in the nobody.

243
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
It's because I didn't have a self to get in the way.

244
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I thought I lacked substance,

245
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and the fact that I could feel others'

246
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
meant that I had nothing of myself to feel.

247
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
The thing that was a source of shame

248
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
was actually a source of enlightenment.

249
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And when I realized

250
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and really understood

251
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
that my self is a projection and that it has a function,

252
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
a funny thing happened.

253
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I stopped giving it so much authority.

254
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
I give it its due.

255
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
I take it to therapy.

256
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
I've become very familiar

257
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
with its dysfunctional behavior.

258
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
But I'm not ashamed of my self.

259
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
In fact, I respect my self

260
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and its function.

261
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And over time and with practice,

262
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
I've tried to live

263
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
more and more from my essence.

264
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And if you can do that,

265
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
incredible things happen.

266
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
I was in Congo in February,

267
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
dancing and celebrating

268
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
with women who've survived

269
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
the destruction of their selves

270
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
in literally unthinkable ways --

271
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
destroyed because other brutalized, psychopathic selves

272
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
all over that beautiful land

273
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
are fueling our selves' addiction

274
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
to iPods, Pads, and bling,

275
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
which further disconnect ourselves

276
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
from ever feeling their pain,

277
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
their suffering,

278
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
their death.

279
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Because, hey,

280
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
if we're all living in ourselves

281
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and mistaking it for life,

282
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
then we're devaluing

283
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and desensitizing life.

284
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And in that disconnected state,

285
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
yeah, we can build factory farms with no windows,

286
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
destroy marine life

287
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and use rape as a weapon of war.

288
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
So here's a note to self:

289
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
The cracks have started to show

290
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
in our constructed world,

291
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and oceans will continue

292
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
to surge through the cracks,

293
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and oil and blood,

294
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
rivers of it.

295
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Crucially, we haven't been figuring out

296
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
how to live in oneness

297
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
with the Earth and every other living thing.

298
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
We've just been insanely trying to figure out

299
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
how to live with each other -- billions of each other.

300
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Only we're not living with each other;

301
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
our crazy selves are living with each other

302
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and perpetuating an epidemic

303
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
of disconnection.

304
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Let's live with each other

305
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and take it a breath at a time.

306
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
If we can get under that heavy self,

307
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
light a torch of awareness,

308
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and find our essence,

309
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
our connection to the infinite

310
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
and every other living thing.

311
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
We knew it from the day we were born.

312
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Let's not be freaked out

313
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
by our bountiful nothingness.

314
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
It's more a reality

315
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
than the ones our selves have created.

316
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Imagine what kind of existence we can have

317
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
if we honor inevitable death of self,

318
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
appreciate the privilege of life

319
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and marvel at what comes next.

320
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Simple awareness is where it begins.

321
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Thank you for listening.

322
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
(Applause)

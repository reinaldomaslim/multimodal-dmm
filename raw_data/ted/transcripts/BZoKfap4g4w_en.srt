1
0:00:15.56,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I was only four years old

2
0:00:17.625,000 --> 0:00:19,000
when I saw my mother load a washing machine

3
0:00:20.56,000 --> 0:00:22,000
for the very first time in her life.

4
0:00:23.203,000 --> 0:00:24,000
That was a great day for my mother.

5
0:00:25.691,000 --> 0:00:27,000
My mother and father had been saving money for years

6
0:00:28.56,000 --> 0:00:3,000
to be able to buy that machine,

7
0:00:30.624,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and the first day it was going to be used,

8
0:00:32.694,000 --> 0:00:35,000
even Grandma was invited to see the machine.

9
0:00:35.857,000 --> 0:00:36,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:37.017,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And Grandma was even more excited.

11
0:00:39.56,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Throughout her life, she had been heating water with firewood,

12
0:00:43.884,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and she had hand-washed laundry for seven children.

13
0:00:47.918,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And now, she was going to watch electricity do that work.

14
0:00:53.56,000 --> 0:00:57,000
My mother carefully opened the door,

15
0:00:57.835,000 --> 0:01:,000
and she loaded the laundry into the machine,

16
0:01:02.295,000 --> 0:01:03,000
like this.

17
0:01:03.511,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And then, when she closed the door,

18
0:01:05.736,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Grandma said, "No, no, no, no!

19
0:01:07.56,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Let me! Let me push the button!"

20
0:01:10.584,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:11.62,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And Grandma pushed the button,

22
0:01:14.266,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and she said, "Oh, fantastic!

23
0:01:16.845,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I want to see this! Give me a chair! Give me a chair! I want to see it,"

24
0:01:20.631,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and she sat down in front of the machine,

25
0:01:23.386,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and she watched the entire washing program.

26
0:01:27.001,000 --> 0:01:28,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:28.027,000 --> 0:01:29,000
She was mesmerized.

28
0:01:29.878,000 --> 0:01:33,000
To my grandmother, the washing machine was a miracle.

29
0:01:35.226,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Today, in Sweden and other rich countries,

30
0:01:38.682,000 --> 0:01:41,000
people are using so many different machines.

31
0:01:42.442,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Look -- the homes are full of machines.

32
0:01:44.451,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I can't even name them all.

33
0:01:46.56,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And they also, when they want to travel,

34
0:01:50.067,000 --> 0:01:52,000
they use flying machines

35
0:01:52.255,000 --> 0:01:54,000
that can take them to remote destinations.

36
0:01:54.947,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And yet, in the world,

37
0:01:56.196,000 --> 0:01:59,000
there are so many people who still heat the water on fire,

38
0:02:00.004,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and they cook their food on fire.

39
0:02:02.519,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Sometimes they don't even have enough food.

40
0:02:05.231,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And they live below the poverty line.

41
0:02:07.56,000 --> 0:02:09,000
There are two billion fellow human beings

42
0:02:10.445,000 --> 0:02:12,000
who live on less than two dollars a day.

43
0:02:13.176,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And the richest people over there -- there's one billion people,

44
0:02:16.335,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and they live above what I call the "air line" --

45
0:02:19.697,000 --> 0:02:2,000
(Laughter)

46
0:02:20.738,000 --> 0:02:23,000
because they spend more than 80 dollars a day

47
0:02:24.207,000 --> 0:02:25,000
on their consumption.

48
0:02:26.124,000 --> 0:02:28,000
But this is just one, two, three billion people,

49
0:02:28.797,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and obviously, there are seven billion people in the world,

50
0:02:31.612,000 --> 0:02:34,000
so there must be one, two, three, four billion people more

51
0:02:35.109,000 --> 0:02:38,000
who live in between the poverty and the air line.

52
0:02:38.311,000 --> 0:02:39,000
They have electricity,

53
0:02:40.08,000 --> 0:02:42,000
but the question is: How many have washing machines?

54
0:02:43.87,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I've done the scrutiny of market data, and I've found that, indeed,

55
0:02:48.405,000 --> 0:02:51,000
the washing machine has penetrated below the air line,

56
0:02:52.001,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and today, there's an additional one billion people out there

57
0:02:55.278,000 --> 0:02:57,000
who live above the "wash line."

58
0:02:57.56,000 --> 0:02:58,000
(Laughter)

59
0:02:59.969,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And they consume for more than 40 dollars per day.

60
0:03:03.629,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So two billion have access to washing machines.

61
0:03:06.391,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And the remaining five billion --

62
0:03:09.342,000 --> 0:03:1,000
how do they wash?

63
0:03:10.632,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Or, to be more precise,

64
0:03:12.262,000 --> 0:03:15,000
how do most of the women in the world wash?

65
0:03:15.633,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Because it remains the hard work for women to wash.

66
0:03:19.589,000 --> 0:03:21,000
They wash like this: by hand.

67
0:03:22.698,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It's hard, time-consuming labor,

68
0:03:27.019,000 --> 0:03:3,000
which they have to do for hours every week.

69
0:03:30.22,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And sometimes they also have to bring water from far away

70
0:03:33.393,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to do the laundry at home,

71
0:03:34.846,000 --> 0:03:37,000
or they have to bring the laundry away to a stream far off.

72
0:03:38.432,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And they want the washing machine.

73
0:03:41.187,000 --> 0:03:44,000
They don't want to spend such a large part of their life

74
0:03:44.864,000 --> 0:03:45,000
doing this hard work

75
0:03:46.251,000 --> 0:03:48,000
with so relatively low productivity.

76
0:03:49.352,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And there's nothing different in their wish

77
0:03:51.588,000 --> 0:03:52,000
than it was for my grandma.

78
0:03:53.303,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Look here, two generations ago in Sweden --

79
0:03:55.672,000 --> 0:03:56,000
picking water from the stream,

80
0:03:57.56,000 --> 0:03:59,000
heating with firewood and washing like that.

81
0:04:00.429,000 --> 0:04:02,000
They want the washing machine in exactly the same way.

82
0:04:03.435,000 --> 0:04:06,000
But when I lecture to environmentally concerned students,

83
0:04:06.779,000 --> 0:04:1,000
they tell me, "No, everybody in the world cannot have cars and washing machines."

84
0:04:11.83,000 --> 0:04:12,000
How can we tell this woman

85
0:04:13.183,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that she isn't going to have a washing machine?

86
0:04:15.773,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And then I ask my students -- over the last two years, I've asked --

87
0:04:19.209,000 --> 0:04:21,000
"How many of you don't use a car?"

88
0:04:21.257,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And some of them proudly raise their hand and say, "I don't use a car."

89
0:04:25.56,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And then I put the really tough question:

90
0:04:27.915,000 --> 0:04:3,000
"How many of you hand-wash your jeans and your bedsheets?"

91
0:04:31.852,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And no one raised their hand.

92
0:04:35.198,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Even the hardcore in the green movement use washing machines.

93
0:04:39.56,000 --> 0:04:41,000
(Laughter)

94
0:04:43.25,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So how come [this is] something that everyone uses

95
0:04:45.731,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and they think others will not stop it?

96
0:04:47.642,000 --> 0:04:48,000
What is special with this?

97
0:04:48.915,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I had to do an analysis about the energy use in the world.

98
0:04:51.803,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Here we are.

99
0:04:52.993,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Look here. You see the seven billion people up there?

100
0:04:55.533,000 --> 0:04:57,000
The air people, the wash people,

101
0:04:57.56,000 --> 0:04:59,000
the bulb people and the fire people.

102
0:05:00.372,000 --> 0:05:02,000
One unit like this

103
0:05:02.413,000 --> 0:05:07,000
is an energy unit of fossil fuel -- oil, coal or gas.

104
0:05:07.56,000 --> 0:05:1,000
That's what most of the electricity and the energy in the world is.

105
0:05:11.171,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And it's 12 units used in the entire world,

106
0:05:14.314,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and the richest one billion, they use six of them.

107
0:05:17.56,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Half of the energy is used by one seventh of the world population.

108
0:05:20.937,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And these ones, who have washing machines

109
0:05:23.1,000 --> 0:05:24,000
but not a house full of other machines,

110
0:05:25.091,000 --> 0:05:26,000
they use two.

111
0:05:26.907,000 --> 0:05:28,000
This group uses three, one each.

112
0:05:29.789,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And they also have electricity.

113
0:05:31.385,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And over there, they don't even use one each.

114
0:05:33.56,000 --> 0:05:34,000
That makes 12 of them.

115
0:05:35.329,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But the main concern

116
0:05:37.024,000 --> 0:05:4,000
for the environmentally interested students -- and they are right --

117
0:05:40.719,000 --> 0:05:41,000
is about the future.

118
0:05:43.154,000 --> 0:05:44,000
What are the trends?

119
0:05:44.344,000 --> 0:05:47,000
If we just prolong the trends, without any real advanced analysis,

120
0:05:48.027,000 --> 0:05:49,000
to 2050,

121
0:05:49.218,000 --> 0:05:52,000
there are two things that can increase the energy use:

122
0:05:52.37,000 --> 0:05:54,000
first, population growth; second, economic growth.

123
0:05:55.957,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Population growth will mainly occur among the poorest people here,

124
0:05:59.447,000 --> 0:06:,000
because they have high child mortality

125
0:06:01.309,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and they have many children per woman.

126
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And that will get you two extra,

127
0:06:05.067,000 --> 0:06:07,000
but that won't change the energy use very much.

128
0:06:07.323,000 --> 0:06:09,000
What will happen is economic growth.

129
0:06:09.347,000 --> 0:06:11,000
The best of here in the emerging economies --

130
0:06:12.127,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I call them "the New East" --

131
0:06:13.85,000 --> 0:06:14,000
they will jump the air line.

132
0:06:15.56,000 --> 0:06:16,000
"Wopp!" they will say.

133
0:06:17.223,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And they will start to use as much as the Old West are doing already.

134
0:06:20.682,000 --> 0:06:21,000
(Laughter)

135
0:06:21.782,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And these people, they want the washing machine.

136
0:06:24.087,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I told you. They'll go there.

137
0:06:25.56,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And they will double their energy use.

138
0:06:27.414,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And we hope that the poor people will get into the electric light.

139
0:06:30.562,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And they'll get a two-child family without a stop in population growth.

140
0:06:33.998,000 --> 0:06:36,000
But the total energy consumption will increase to 22 units.

141
0:06:37.241,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And these 22 units --

142
0:06:40.067,000 --> 0:06:42,000
still, the richest people use most of them.

143
0:06:44.122,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So what needs to be done?

144
0:06:45.521,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Because the risk,

145
0:06:47.522,000 --> 0:06:49,000
the high probability of climate change is real.

146
0:06:50.677,000 --> 0:06:51,000
It's real.

147
0:06:52.105,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Of course, they must be more energy efficient.

148
0:06:55.776,000 --> 0:06:57,000
They must change their behavior in some way.

149
0:06:57.914,000 --> 0:06:59,000
They must also start to produce green energy,

150
0:07:00.374,000 --> 0:07:01,000
much more green energy.

151
0:07:01.623,000 --> 0:07:04,000
But until they have the same energy consumption per person,

152
0:07:05.019,000 --> 0:07:06,000
they shouldn't give advice to others --

153
0:07:06.954,000 --> 0:07:07,000
what to do and what not to do.

154
0:07:08.474,000 --> 0:07:09,000
(Laughter)

155
0:07:09.622,000 --> 0:07:1,000
(Applause)

156
0:07:10.824,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Here, we can get more green energy all over.

157
0:07:15.593,000 --> 0:07:16,000
This is what we hope might happen.

158
0:07:17.265,000 --> 0:07:18,000
It's a real challenge in the future.

159
0:07:19.639,000 --> 0:07:22,000
But I can assure you that this woman in the favela in Rio,

160
0:07:23.319,000 --> 0:07:24,000
she wants a washing machine.

161
0:07:25.112,000 --> 0:07:27,000
She's very happy about her minister of energy

162
0:07:27.498,000 --> 0:07:28,000
that provided electricity to everyone --

163
0:07:29.498,000 --> 0:07:32,000
so happy that she even voted for her.

164
0:07:33.099,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And she became Dilma Rousseff,

165
0:07:34.869,000 --> 0:07:38,000
the president-elect of one of the biggest democracies in the world,

166
0:07:39.073,000 --> 0:07:42,000
moving from minister of energy to president.

167
0:07:42.305,000 --> 0:07:45,000
If you have democracy, people will vote for washing machines.

168
0:07:46.21,000 --> 0:07:47,000
They love them!

169
0:07:47.719,000 --> 0:07:48,000
(Laughter)

170
0:07:49.496,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And what's the magic with them?

171
0:07:51.304,000 --> 0:07:54,000
My mother explained the magic with this machine

172
0:07:54.56,000 --> 0:07:56,000
the very, very first day.

173
0:07:57.061,000 --> 0:07:58,000
She said, "Now, Hans.

174
0:07:59.535,000 --> 0:08:,000
We have loaded the laundry.

175
0:08:01.044,000 --> 0:08:02,000
The machine will make the work.

176
0:08:02.785,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And now we can go to the library."

177
0:08:05.419,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Because this is the magic: you load the laundry,

178
0:08:08.384,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and what do you get out of the machine?

179
0:08:10.69,000 --> 0:08:13,000
You get books out of the machines,

180
0:08:14.015,000 --> 0:08:15,000
children's books.

181
0:08:15.191,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And mother got time to read for me.

182
0:08:17.56,000 --> 0:08:18,000
She loved this.

183
0:08:18.749,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I got the "ABC's" -- this is why I started my career as a professor,

184
0:08:22.56,000 --> 0:08:24,000
when my mother had time to read for me.

185
0:08:24.724,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And she also got books for herself.

186
0:08:26.56,000 --> 0:08:29,000
She managed to study English and learn that as a foreign language.

187
0:08:30.339,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And she read so many novels,

188
0:08:32.67,000 --> 0:08:34,000
so many different novels here.

189
0:08:35.134,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And we really, we really loved this machine.

190
0:08:38.824,000 --> 0:08:39,000
(Laughter)

191
0:08:39.986,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And what we said, my mother and me,

192
0:08:42.56,000 --> 0:08:44,000
"Thank you, industrialization.

193
0:08:45.56,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Thank you, steel mill.

194
0:08:47.518,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Thank you, power station.

195
0:08:49.336,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And thank you, chemical processing industry

196
0:08:52.384,000 --> 0:08:54,000
that gave us time to read books."

197
0:08:54.416,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Thank you very much.

198
0:08:55.657,000 --> 0:08:56,000
(Laughter)

199
0:08:56.763,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Applause)

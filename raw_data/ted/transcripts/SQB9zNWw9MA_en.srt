0:00:12.817,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Recently, we've seen the effects of cyber attacks on the business world.

2
0:00:17.245,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Data breaches at companies like JP Morgan, Yahoo, Home Depot and Target

3
0:00:22.68,000 --> 0:00:24,000
have caused losses of hundreds of millions

4
0:00:25.395,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and in some cases, billions of dollars.

5
0:00:28.792,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It wouldn't take many large attacks to ravage the world economy.

6
0:00:33.229,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And the public sector has not been immune, either.

7
0:00:36.706,000 --> 0:00:39,000
In 2012 to 2014,

8
0:00:40.498,000 --> 0:00:44,000
there was a significant data breach at the US Office of Personnel Management.

9
0:00:45.157,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Security clearance and fingerprint data was compromised,

10
0:00:48.611,000 --> 0:00:52,000
affecting 22 million employees.

11
0:00:53.561,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And you may have heard of the attempt by state-sponsored hackers

12
0:00:57.688,000 --> 0:01:02,000
to use stolen data to influence election outcomes in a number of countries.

13
0:01:03.624,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Two recent examples are the compromise of a large amount of data

14
0:01:07.267,000 --> 0:01:1,000
from the Bundestag, the national Parliament of Germany,

15
0:01:10.601,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and the theft of emails from the US Democratic National Committee.

16
0:01:16.807,000 --> 0:01:2,000
The cyber threat is now affecting our democratic processes.

17
0:01:21.712,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And it's likely to get worse.

18
0:01:24.141,000 --> 0:01:27,000
As computer technology is becoming more powerful,

19
0:01:27.903,000 --> 0:01:31,000
the systems we use to protect our data are becoming more vulnerable.

20
0:01:33.093,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Adding to the concern is a new type of computing technology,

21
0:01:36.665,000 --> 0:01:37,000
called quantum computing,

22
0:01:38.68,000 --> 0:01:4,000
which leverages microscopic properties of nature

23
0:01:41.657,000 --> 0:01:44,000
to deliver unimaginable increases in computational power.

24
0:01:46.069,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It's so powerful that it will crack many of the encryption systems

25
0:01:50.506,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that we use today.

26
0:01:52.625,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So is the situation hopeless?

27
0:01:55.228,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Should we start packing our digital survival gear

28
0:01:58.109,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and prepare for an upcoming data apocalypse?

29
0:02:02.283,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I would say, not yet.

30
0:02:04.489,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Quantum computing is still in the labs,

31
0:02:06.435,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and it will take a few years until it's put to practical applications.

32
0:02:10.347,000 --> 0:02:11,000
More important,

33
0:02:11.577,000 --> 0:02:14,000
there have been major breakthroughs in the field of encryption.

34
0:02:15.497,000 --> 0:02:18,000
For me, this is a particularly exciting time

35
0:02:18.522,000 --> 0:02:2,000
in the history of secure communications.

36
0:02:21.759,000 --> 0:02:22,000
About 15 years ago,

37
0:02:23.212,000 --> 0:02:25,000
when I learned of our new-found ability

38
0:02:25.562,000 --> 0:02:28,000
to create quantum effects that don't exist in nature,

39
0:02:29.371,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I was excited.

40
0:02:30.814,000 --> 0:02:33,000
The idea of applying the fundamental laws of physics

41
0:02:34.125,000 --> 0:02:35,000
to make encryption stronger

42
0:02:35.88,000 --> 0:02:36,000
really intrigued me.

43
0:02:38.069,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Today, a select groups of companies and labs around the world, including mine,

44
0:02:44.284,000 --> 0:02:47,000
are maturing this technology for practical applications.

45
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
That's right.

46
0:02:49.435,000 --> 0:02:52,000
We are now preparing to fight quantum with quantum.

47
0:02:53.719,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So how does this all work?

48
0:02:55.624,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Well, first, let's take a quick tour of the world of encryption.

49
0:02:59.259,000 --> 0:03:01,000
For that, you'll need a briefcase,

50
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
some important documents that you want to send your friend, James Bond,

51
0:03:05.345,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and a lock to keep it all safe.

52
0:03:08.122,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Because the documents are top secret, we're going to use an advanced briefcase.

53
0:03:13.321,000 --> 0:03:15,000
It has a special combination lock

54
0:03:15.409,000 --> 0:03:16,000
which, when closed,

55
0:03:16.998,000 --> 0:03:19,000
converts all the text in the documents to random numbers.

56
0:03:20.434,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So you put your documents inside, close the lock --

57
0:03:24.174,000 --> 0:03:27,000
at which point in time the documents get converted to random numbers --

58
0:03:27.68,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and you send the briefcase to James.

59
0:03:30.736,000 --> 0:03:33,000
While it's on its way, you call him to give him the code.

60
0:03:34.387,000 --> 0:03:36,000
When he gets the briefcase, he enters the code,

61
0:03:37.347,000 --> 0:03:39,000
the documents get unscrambled, and voilà,

62
0:03:40.355,000 --> 0:03:43,000
you've just sent an encoded message to James Bond.

63
0:03:44.228,000 --> 0:03:45,000
(Laughter)

64
0:03:45.966,000 --> 0:03:49,000
A fun example, but it does illustrate three things important for encryption.

65
0:03:50.776,000 --> 0:03:52,000
The code -- we call this an encryption key.

66
0:03:53.641,000 --> 0:03:55,000
You can think of it as a password.

67
0:03:56.093,000 --> 0:04:,000
The call to James to give him the code for the combination lock.

68
0:04:00.966,000 --> 0:04:02,000
We call this key exchange.

69
0:04:03.442,000 --> 0:04:04,000
This is how you ensure

70
0:04:04.959,000 --> 0:04:07,000
you get the encryption key securely to the right place.

71
0:04:09.164,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And the lock, which encodes and decodes the document.

72
0:04:12.887,000 --> 0:04:14,000
We call this an encryption algorithm.

73
0:04:15.53,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Using the key, it encodes the text in the documents

74
0:04:20.522,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to random numbers.

75
0:04:21.942,000 --> 0:04:23,000
A good algorithm will encode in such a way

76
0:04:24.728,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that without the key it's very difficult to unscramble.

77
0:04:29.529,000 --> 0:04:3,000
What makes encryption so important

78
0:04:31.546,000 --> 0:04:34,000
is that if someone were to capture the briefcase and cut it open

79
0:04:35.306,000 --> 0:04:38,000
without the encryption key and the encryption algorithm,

80
0:04:38.592,000 --> 0:04:4,000
they wouldn't be able to read the documents.

81
0:04:41.132,000 --> 0:04:45,000
They would look like nothing more than a bunch of random numbers.

82
0:04:46.575,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Most security systems rely on a secure method for key exchange

83
0:04:51.448,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to communicate the encryption key to the right place.

84
0:04:56.862,000 --> 0:04:58,000
However, rapid increases in computational power

85
0:04:59.862,000 --> 0:05:03,000
are putting at risk a number of the key exchange methods we have today.

86
0:05:04.776,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Consider one of the very widely used systems today -- RSA.

87
0:05:09.855,000 --> 0:05:12,000
When it was invented, in 1977,

88
0:05:13.18,000 --> 0:05:17,000
it was estimated that it would take 40 quadrillion years

89
0:05:17.704,000 --> 0:05:2,000
to break a 426-bit RSA key.

90
0:05:22.006,000 --> 0:05:26,000
In 1994, just 17 years later,

91
0:05:26.363,000 --> 0:05:27,000
the code was broken.

92
0:05:29.355,000 --> 0:05:31,000
As computers have become more and more powerful,

93
0:05:31.95,000 --> 0:05:33,000
we've had to use larger and larger codes.

94
0:05:35.117,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Today we routinely use 2048 or 4096 bits.

95
0:05:41.831,000 --> 0:05:46,000
As you can see, code makers and breakers are engaged in an ongoing battle

96
0:05:46.886,000 --> 0:05:47,000
to outwit each other.

97
0:05:50.553,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And when quantum computers arrive in the next 10 to 15 years,

98
0:05:54.673,000 --> 0:05:58,000
they will even more rapidly crack the complex mathematics

99
0:05:58.883,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that underlies many of our encryption systems today.

100
0:06:03.034,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Indeed, the quantum computer is likely to turn our present security castle

101
0:06:08.466,000 --> 0:06:1,000
into a mere house of cards.

102
0:06:12.815,000 --> 0:06:15,000
We have to find a way to defend our castle.

103
0:06:17.474,000 --> 0:06:19,000
There's been a growing body of research in recent years

104
0:06:20.101,000 --> 0:06:23,000
looking at using quantum effects to make encryption stronger.

105
0:06:23.76,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And there have been some exciting breakthroughs.

106
0:06:27.474,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Remember those three things important for encryption --

107
0:06:30.427,000 --> 0:06:34,000
high-quality keys, secure key exchange and a strong algorithm?

108
0:06:35.831,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Well, advances in science and engineering

109
0:06:38.522,000 --> 0:06:41,000
are putting two of those three elements at risk.

110
0:06:42.45,000 --> 0:06:43,000
First of all, those keys.

111
0:06:45.006,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Random numbers are the foundational building blocks of encryption keys.

112
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
But today, they're not truly random.

113
0:06:52.641,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Currently, we construct encryption keys

114
0:06:55.403,000 --> 0:06:58,000
from sequences of random numbers generated from software,

115
0:06:59.236,000 --> 0:07:01,000
so-called pseudo-random numbers.

116
0:07:02.712,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Numbers generated by a program or a mathematical recipe

117
0:07:06.053,000 --> 0:07:09,000
will have some, perhaps subtle, pattern to them.

118
0:07:10.784,000 --> 0:07:11,000
The less random the numbers are,

119
0:07:12.36,000 --> 0:07:15,000
or in scientific terms, the less entropy they contain,

120
0:07:15.728,000 --> 0:07:17,000
the easier they are to predict.

121
0:07:18.917,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Recently, several casinos have been victims of a creative attack.

122
0:07:22.863,000 --> 0:07:26,000
The output of slot machines was recorded over a period of time

123
0:07:27.236,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and then analyzed.

124
0:07:28.982,000 --> 0:07:29,000
This allowed the cyber criminals

125
0:07:30.974,000 --> 0:07:33,000
to reverse engineer the pseudo-random number generator

126
0:07:34.665,000 --> 0:07:35,000
behind the spinning wheels.

127
0:07:36.688,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And allowed them, with high accuracy, to predict the spins of the wheels,

128
0:07:42.019,000 --> 0:07:45,000
enabling them to make big financial gains.

129
0:07:47.122,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Similar risks apply to encryption keys.

130
0:07:50.815,000 --> 0:07:55,000
So having a true random number generator is essential for secure encryption.

131
0:07:57.815,000 --> 0:08:02,000
For years, researchers have been looking at building true random number generators.

132
0:08:03.093,000 --> 0:08:06,000
But most designs to date are either not random enough,

133
0:08:06.49,000 --> 0:08:08,000
fast enough or aren't easily repeatable.

134
0:08:10.053,000 --> 0:08:13,000
But the quantum world is truly random.

135
0:08:13.546,000 --> 0:08:17,000
So it makes sense to take advantage of this intrinsic randomness.

136
0:08:20.165,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Devices that can measure quantum effects

137
0:08:22.101,000 --> 0:08:25,000
can produce an endless stream of random numbers at high speed.

138
0:08:26.421,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Foiling all those would-be casino criminals.

139
0:08:30.485,000 --> 0:08:33,000
A select group of universities and companies around the world

140
0:08:34.086,000 --> 0:08:37,000
are focused on building true random number generators.

141
0:08:37.895,000 --> 0:08:4,000
At my company, our quantum random number generator

142
0:08:41.577,000 --> 0:08:44,000
started life on a two meter by one meter optic table.

143
0:08:46.085,000 --> 0:08:49,000
We were then able to reduce it to a server-size box.

144
0:08:50.736,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Today, it's miniaturized into a PCI card that plugs into a standard computer.

145
0:08:59.482,000 --> 0:09:03,000
This is the world's fastest true random number generator.

146
0:09:04.053,000 --> 0:09:09,000
It measures quantum effects to produce a billion random numbers per second.

147
0:09:09.877,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And it's in use today to improve security

148
0:09:13.25,000 --> 0:09:16,000
at cloud providers, banks and government agencies

149
0:09:16.948,000 --> 0:09:17,000
around the world.

150
0:09:18.788,000 --> 0:09:24,000
(Applause)

151
0:09:27.319,000 --> 0:09:29,000
But even with a true random number generator,

152
0:09:29.911,000 --> 0:09:31,000
we've still got the second big cyber threat:

153
0:09:32.831,000 --> 0:09:34,000
the problem of secure key exchange.

154
0:09:36.315,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Current key exchange techniques will not stand up to a quantum computer.

155
0:09:41.865,000 --> 0:09:42,000
The quantum solution to this problem

156
0:09:43.818,000 --> 0:09:46,000
is called quantum key distribution or QKD,

157
0:09:47.893,000 --> 0:09:51,000
which leverages a fundamental, counterintuitive characteristic

158
0:09:52.252,000 --> 0:09:53,000
of quantum mechanics.

159
0:09:54.077,000 --> 0:09:58,000
The very act of looking at a quantum particle changes it.

160
0:10:00.173,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Let me give you an example of how this works.

161
0:10:02.927,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Consider again exchanging the code for the lock with James Bond.

162
0:10:07.974,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Except this time, instead of a call to give James the code,

163
0:10:12.156,000 --> 0:10:16,000
we're going to use quantum effects on a laser to carry the code

164
0:10:16.228,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and send it over standard optic fiber to James.

165
0:10:20.774,000 --> 0:10:24,000
We assume that Dr. No is trying to hack the exchange.

166
0:10:26.53,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Luckily, Dr. No's attempt to intercept the quantum keys while in transit

167
0:10:31.797,000 --> 0:10:34,000
will leave fingerprints that James and you can detect.

168
0:10:36.043,000 --> 0:10:39,000
This allows those intercepted keys to be discarded.

169
0:10:40.026,000 --> 0:10:41,000
The keys which are then retained

170
0:10:41.807,000 --> 0:10:44,000
can be used to provide very strong data protection.

171
0:10:45.815,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And because the security is based on the fundamental laws of physics,

172
0:10:50.125,000 --> 0:10:54,000
a quantum computer, or indeed any future supercomputer

173
0:10:54.212,000 --> 0:10:55,000
will not be able to break it.

174
0:10:56.768,000 --> 0:10:58,000
My team and I are collaborating with leading universities

175
0:10:59.728,000 --> 0:11:,000
and the defense sector

176
0:11:01.046,000 --> 0:11:03,000
to mature this exciting technology

177
0:11:03.506,000 --> 0:11:06,000
into the next generation of security products.

178
0:11:07.895,000 --> 0:11:12,000
The internet of things is heralding a hyperconnected era

179
0:11:13.657,000 --> 0:11:19,000
with 25 to 30 billion connected devices forecast by 2020.

180
0:11:20.569,000 --> 0:11:25,000
For the correct functioning of our society in an IoT world,

181
0:11:25.704,000 --> 0:11:29,000
trust in the systems that support these connected devices is vital.

182
0:11:31.704,000 --> 0:11:35,000
We're betting that quantum technologies will be essential in providing this trust,

183
0:11:36.887,000 --> 0:11:4,000
enabling us to fully benefit from the amazing innovations

184
0:11:41.47,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that are going to so enrich our lives.

185
0:11:46.046,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Thank you.

186
0:11:47.22,000 --> 0:11:51,000

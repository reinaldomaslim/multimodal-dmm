1
0:00:16.045,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So I am a surgeon who studies creativity,

2
0:00:18.542,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and I have never had a patient tell me,

3
0:00:21.394,000 --> 0:00:23,000
"I really want you to be creative during surgery,"

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and so I guess there's a little bit of irony to it.

5
0:00:27.403,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I will say though that, after having done surgery a lot,

6
0:00:30.727,000 --> 0:00:32,000
it's similar to playing a musical instrument.

7
0:00:32.961,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And for me, this deep and enduring fascination with sound

8
0:00:35.815,000 --> 0:00:36,000
is what led me to both be a surgeon

9
0:00:37.581,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and to study the science of sound, particularly music.

10
0:00:40.139,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I'm going to talk over the next few minutes

11
0:00:42.212,000 --> 0:00:43,000
about my career

12
0:00:43.527,000 --> 0:00:45,000
in terms of how I'm able to study music

13
0:00:45.835,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and try to grapple with all these questions

14
0:00:47.893,000 --> 0:00:49,000
of how the brain is able to be creative.

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I've done most of this work at Johns Hopkins University,

16
0:00:52.914,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and at the National Institute of Health where I was previously.

17
0:00:55.923,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I'll go over some science experiments and cover three musical experiments.

18
0:00:59.454,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I will start off by playing a video for you.

19
0:01:01.534,000 --> 0:01:04,000
This video is of Keith Jarrett, who's a well-known jazz improviser

20
0:01:04.661,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and probably the most well-known, iconic example

21
0:01:07.129,000 --> 0:01:09,000
of someone who takes improvisation to a higher level.

22
0:01:09.646,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And he'll improvise entire concerts off the top of his head,

23
0:01:12.809,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and he'll never play it exactly the same way again,

24
0:01:15.238,000 --> 0:01:16,000
so as a form of intense creativity,

25
0:01:17.247,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I think this is a great example.

26
0:01:18.889,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And so why don't we go and click the video.

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Music)

28
0:02:17.055,000 --> 0:02:19,000
(Music ends)

29
0:02:19.08,000 --> 0:02:21,000
It's really a remarkable thing that happens there.

30
0:02:21.443,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I've always as a listener, as a fan,

31
0:02:23.195,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I listen to that, and I'm astounded.

32
0:02:24.936,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I think -- how can this possibly be?

33
0:02:26.696,000 --> 0:02:28,000
How can the brain generate that much information,

34
0:02:29.011,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that much music, spontaneously?

35
0:02:30.62,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And so I set out with this concept, scientifically,

36
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that artistic creativity, it's magical, but it's not magic,

37
0:02:37.635,000 --> 0:02:39,000
meaning that it's a product of the brain.

38
0:02:39.666,000 --> 0:02:41,000
There's not too many brain-dead people creating art.

39
0:02:42.124,000 --> 0:02:45,000
With this notion that artistic creativity is in fact a neurologic product,

40
0:02:45.779,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I took this thesis that we could study it

41
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
just like we study any other complex neurologic process,

42
0:02:51.398,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and there are subquestions that I put there.

43
0:02:53.477,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Is it possible to study creativity scientifically?

44
0:02:55.887,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And I think that's a good question.

45
0:02:57.948,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And I'll tell you that most scientific studies of music,

46
0:03:00.658,000 --> 0:03:01,000
they're very dense,

47
0:03:02.2,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and when you go through them,

48
0:03:03.619,000 --> 0:03:05,000
it's very hard to recognize the music in it.

49
0:03:05.713,000 --> 0:03:07,000
In fact, they seem to be unmusical entirely

50
0:03:07.956,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and to miss the point of the music.

51
0:03:09.774,000 --> 0:03:1,000
This brings the second question:

52
0:03:11.354,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Why should scientists study creativity?

53
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Maybe we're not the right people to do it.

54
0:03:15.363,000 --> 0:03:15,000
(Laughter)

55
0:03:16.386,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Well it may be, but I will say that, from a scientific perspective,

56
0:03:19.862,000 --> 0:03:21,000
we talked a lot about innovation today,

57
0:03:21.904,000 --> 0:03:22,000
the science of innovation,

58
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
how much we understand about how the brain is able to innovate

59
0:03:26.237,000 --> 0:03:27,000
is in its infancy,

60
0:03:27.505,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and truly, we know very little about how we are able to be creative.

61
0:03:30.996,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I think that we're going to see,

62
0:03:32.544,000 --> 0:03:33,000
over the next 10, 20, 30 years,

63
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
a real science of creativity that's burgeoning

64
0:03:36.455,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and is going to flourish,

65
0:03:37.68,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Because we now have new methods that can enable us

66
0:03:40.136,000 --> 0:03:42,000
to take this process like complex jazz improvisation,

67
0:03:42.684,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and study it rigorously.

68
0:03:44.082,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So it gets down to the brain.

69
0:03:46.253,000 --> 0:03:47,000
All of us have this remarkable brain,

70
0:03:48.071,000 --> 0:03:5,000
which is poorly understood, to say the least.

71
0:03:50.55,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I think that neuroscientists have more questions than answers,

72
0:03:54.772,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and I'm not going to give you answers today,

73
0:03:56.998,000 --> 0:03:57,000
just ask a lot of questions.

74
0:03:58.383,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And that's what I do in my lab.

75
0:03:59.914,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I ask questions about what is the brain doing to enable us to do this.

76
0:04:03.252,000 --> 0:04:05,000
This is the main method that I use. This is functional MRI.

77
0:04:06.053,000 --> 0:04:08,000
If you've been in an MRI scanner, it's very much the same,

78
0:04:08.8,000 --> 0:04:11,000
but this one is outfitted in a special way to not just take pictures of your brain,

79
0:04:12.739,000 --> 0:04:14,000
but to also take pictures of active areas of the brain.

80
0:04:15.69,000 --> 0:04:16,000
The way that's done is by the following:

81
0:04:17.619,000 --> 0:04:18,000
There's something called BOLD imaging,

82
0:04:19.453,000 --> 0:04:21,000
which is Blood Oxygen Level Dependent imaging.

83
0:04:22.541,000 --> 0:04:24,000
When you're in an fMRI scanner, you're in a big magnet

84
0:04:25.15,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that's aligning your molecules in certain areas.

85
0:04:27.547,000 --> 0:04:3,000
When an area of the brain is active, meaning a neural area is active,

86
0:04:31.29,000 --> 0:04:33,000
it gets blood flow shunted to that area.

87
0:04:33.552,000 --> 0:04:37,000
That blood flow causes an increase in local blood to that area

88
0:04:37.926,000 --> 0:04:39,000
with a deoxyhemoglobin change in concentration.

89
0:04:40.933,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Deoxyhemoglobin can be detected by MRI,

90
0:04:43.112,000 --> 0:04:44,000
whereas oxyhemoglobin can't.

91
0:04:44.986,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So through this method of inference --

92
0:04:46.964,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and we're measuring blood flow, not neural activity --

93
0:04:49.53,000 --> 0:04:51,000
we say that an area of the brain that's getting more blood

94
0:04:52.29,000 --> 0:04:55,000
was active during a particular task, and that's the crux of how fMRI works.

95
0:04:55.856,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And it's been used since the '90s to study really complex processes.

96
0:04:59.785,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I'm going to review a study that I did, which was jazz in an fMRI scanner.

97
0:05:03.309,000 --> 0:05:05,000
It was done with a colleague, Alan Braun, at the NIH.

98
0:05:05.836,000 --> 0:05:07,000
This is a short video of how we did this project.

99
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
(Video) Charles Limb: This is a plastic MIDI piano keyboard

100
0:05:11.065,000 --> 0:05:12,000
that we use for the jazz experiments.

101
0:05:12.87,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And it's a 35-key keyboard

102
0:05:14.947,000 --> 0:05:16,000
designed to fit both inside the scanner,

103
0:05:17.431,000 --> 0:05:18,000
be magnetically safe,

104
0:05:18.791,000 --> 0:05:21,000
have minimal interference that would contribute to any artifact,

105
0:05:22.657,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and have this cushion so that it can rest on the players' legs

106
0:05:25.601,000 --> 0:05:27,000
while they're lying down in the scanner, playing on their back.

107
0:05:28.58,000 --> 0:05:31,000
It works like this -- this doesn't actually produce any sound.

108
0:05:31.633,000 --> 0:05:33,000
It sends out what's called a MIDI signal --

109
0:05:34.1,000 --> 0:05:36,000
or a Musical Instrument Digital Interface --

110
0:05:36.173,000 --> 0:05:38,000
through these wires into the box and then the computer,

111
0:05:38.858,000 --> 0:05:4,000
which then trigger high-quality piano samples like this.

112
0:05:41.817,000 --> 0:05:44,000
(Music)

113
0:05:48.309,000 --> 0:05:51,000
(Music)

114
0:06:07.593,000 --> 0:06:08,000
(Music ends)

115
0:06:09.592,000 --> 0:06:1,000
OK, so it works.

116
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And so through this piano keyboard,

117
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
we have the means to take a musical process and study it.

118
0:06:16.027,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So what do you do now that you have this cool piano keyboard?

119
0:06:18.978,000 --> 0:06:2,000
You can't just say, "It's great we have a keyboard."

120
0:06:21.447,000 --> 0:06:23,000
We have to come up with a scientific experiment.

121
0:06:23.795,000 --> 0:06:25,000
The experiment really rests on the following:

122
0:06:26.189,000 --> 0:06:29,000
What happens in the brain during something that's memorized and over-learned,

123
0:06:29.857,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and what happens in the brain during something

124
0:06:32.036,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that is spontaneously generated, or improvised,

125
0:06:34.334,000 --> 0:06:35,000
in a way that's matched motorically

126
0:06:36.172,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and in terms of lower-level sensory motor features?

127
0:06:39.041,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I have here what we call the paradigms.

128
0:06:41.66,000 --> 0:06:44,000
There's a scale paradigm, which is playing a scale up and down, memorized,

129
0:06:45.18,000 --> 0:06:46,000
then there's improvising on a scale,

130
0:06:46.938,000 --> 0:06:48,000
quarter notes, metronome, right hand --

131
0:06:48.999,000 --> 0:06:49,000
scientifically very safe,

132
0:06:50.594,000 --> 0:06:51,000
but musically really boring.

133
0:06:52.491,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Then there's the bottom one, which is called the jazz paradigm.

134
0:06:55.486,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So we brought professional jazz players to the NIH,

135
0:06:57.914,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and we had them memorize this piece of music on the lower-left,

136
0:07:00.891,000 --> 0:07:01,000
which is what you heard me playing --

137
0:07:02.733,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and we had them improvise to the same chord changes.

138
0:07:05.25,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And if you can hit that lower-right sound icon,

139
0:07:07.482,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that's an example of what was recorded in the scanner.

140
0:07:10.334,000 --> 0:07:13,000
(Music)

141
0:07:35.064,000 --> 0:07:37,000
(Music ends)

142
0:07:37.089,000 --> 0:07:39,000
In the end, it's not the most natural environment,

143
0:07:39.529,000 --> 0:07:4,000
but they're able to play real music.

144
0:07:41.459,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And I've listened to that solo 200 times,

145
0:07:43.454,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and I still like it.

146
0:07:44.655,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And the musicians were comfortable in the end.

147
0:07:47.066,000 --> 0:07:48,000
We first measured the number of notes.

148
0:07:48.914,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Were they playing more notes when they were improvising?

149
0:07:51.595,000 --> 0:07:52,000
That was not what was going on.

150
0:07:53.209,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And then we looked at the brain activity.

151
0:07:55.218,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I will try to condense this for you.

152
0:07:57.05,000 --> 0:08:,000
These are contrast maps that are showing subtractions between what changes

153
0:08:00.554,000 --> 0:08:03,000
when you're improvising vs. when you're doing something memorized.

154
0:08:03.674,000 --> 0:08:05,000
In red is an area that's active in the prefrontal cortex,

155
0:08:06.483,000 --> 0:08:07,000
the frontal lobe of the brain,

156
0:08:07.966,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and in blue is this area that was deactivated.

157
0:08:10.169,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So we had this focal area called the medial prefrontal cortex

158
0:08:13.069,000 --> 0:08:14,000
that went way up in activity.

159
0:08:14.48,000 --> 0:08:17,000
We had this broad patch of area called the lateral prefrontal cortex

160
0:08:17.734,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that went way down in activity,

161
0:08:19.283,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I'll summarize that for you.

162
0:08:20.795,000 --> 0:08:22,000
These are multifunctional areas of the brain,

163
0:08:22.927,000 --> 0:08:24,000
these are not the jazz areas of the brain.

164
0:08:25.106,000 --> 0:08:26,000
They do a whole host of things

165
0:08:27.058,000 --> 0:08:28,000
that have to do with self-reflection,

166
0:08:28.941,000 --> 0:08:3,000
introspection, working memory etc.

167
0:08:31.325,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Really, consciousness is seated in the frontal lobe.

168
0:08:33.836,000 --> 0:08:35,000
But we have this combination

169
0:08:35.894,000 --> 0:08:38,000
of an area that's thought to be involved in self-monitoring, turning off,

170
0:08:39.367,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and this area that's thought to be autobiographical,

171
0:08:41.854,000 --> 0:08:42,000
or self-expressive, turning on.

172
0:08:43.413,000 --> 0:08:45,000
We think, at least in this preliminary --

173
0:08:45.508,000 --> 0:08:47,000
it's one study; it's probably wrong, but it's one study --

174
0:08:48.285,000 --> 0:08:49,000
(Laughter)

175
0:08:49.348,000 --> 0:08:51,000
we think that at least a reasonable hypothesis

176
0:08:52.103,000 --> 0:08:53,000
is that, to be creative,

177
0:08:53.288,000 --> 0:08:55,000
you should have this weird dissociation in your frontal lobe.

178
0:08:56.188,000 --> 0:08:58,000
One area turns on, and a big area shuts off,

179
0:08:58.736,000 --> 0:09:,000
so that you're not inhibited, you're willing to make mistakes,

180
0:09:01.698,000 --> 0:09:03,000
so that you're not constantly shutting down

181
0:09:03.89,000 --> 0:09:04,000
all of these new generative impulses.

182
0:09:05.839,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Now a lot of people know that music is not always a solo activity --

183
0:09:09.308,000 --> 0:09:1,000
sometimes it's done communicatively.

184
0:09:11.052,000 --> 0:09:12,000
The next question was:

185
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
What happens when musicians are trading back and forth,

186
0:09:14.856,000 --> 0:09:15,000
something called "trading fours,"

187
0:09:16.493,000 --> 0:09:18,000
which is something they do normally in a jazz experiment.

188
0:09:19.34,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So this is a 12-bar blues,

189
0:09:20.777,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and I've broken it down into four-bar groups,

190
0:09:22.91,000 --> 0:09:23,000
so you would know how you would trade.

191
0:09:24.746,000 --> 0:09:26,000
We brought a musician into the scanner, same way,

192
0:09:27.056,000 --> 0:09:28,000
had them memorize this melody

193
0:09:28.492,000 --> 0:09:3,000
then had another musician out in the control room

194
0:09:31.082,000 --> 0:09:32,000
trading back and forth interactively.

195
0:09:33.075,000 --> 0:09:35,000
So this is a musician, Mike Pope,

196
0:09:35.723,000 --> 0:09:38,000
one of the world's best bassists and a fantastic piano player.

197
0:09:38.833,000 --> 0:09:44,000
(Music)

198
0:09:45.116,000 --> 0:09:47,000
He's now playing the piece that we just saw

199
0:09:47.506,000 --> 0:09:48,000
a little better than I wrote it.

200
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
(Video) CL: Mike, come on in.

201
0:09:51.05,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Mike Pope: May the force be with you.

202
0:09:52.844,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Nurse: Nothing in your pockets, Mike?

203
0:09:54.634,000 --> 0:09:55,000
MP: No. Nothing's in my pockets.

204
0:10:05.837,000 --> 0:10:07,000
CL: You have to have the right attitude to agree to do it.

205
0:10:08.639,000 --> 0:10:09,000
(Laughter)

206
0:10:09.919,000 --> 0:10:1,000
It's kind of fun, actually.

207
0:10:11.758,000 --> 0:10:12,000
(Music)

208
0:10:13.381,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Now we're playing back and forth.

209
0:10:15.104,000 --> 0:10:17,000
He's in there. You can see his legs up there.

210
0:10:17.34,000 --> 0:10:18,000
(Music)

211
0:10:18.706,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And then I'm in the control room here, playing back and forth.

212
0:10:21.92,000 --> 0:10:28,000
(Music)

213
0:10:31.39,000 --> 0:10:32,000
(Music ends)

214
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
(Video) Mike Pope: This is a pretty good representation

215
0:10:36.628,000 --> 0:10:37,000
of what it's like.

216
0:10:38.436,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And it's good that it's not too quick.

217
0:10:40.46,000 --> 0:10:42,000
The fact that we do it over and over again

218
0:10:43.063,000 --> 0:10:46,000
lets you acclimate to your surroundings.

219
0:10:47.293,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So the hardest thing for me was the kinesthetic thing,

220
0:10:49.975,000 --> 0:10:52,000
looking at my hands through two mirrors,

221
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
laying on my back,

222
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and not able to move at all except for my hand.

223
0:10:57.962,000 --> 0:10:58,000
That was challenging.

224
0:10:59.858,000 --> 0:11:,000
But again --

225
0:11:02.212,000 --> 0:11:04,000
there were moments, for sure --

226
0:11:05.022,000 --> 0:11:06,000
(Laughter)

227
0:11:06.047,000 --> 0:11:1,000
there were moments of real, honest-to-God musical interplay, for sure.

228
0:11:11.046,000 --> 0:11:13,000
CL: At this point, I'll take a few moments.

229
0:11:13.072,000 --> 0:11:14,000
So what you're seeing here --

230
0:11:14.977,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and I'm doing a cardinal sin in science,

231
0:11:17.078,000 --> 0:11:18,000
which is to show you preliminary data.

232
0:11:18.912,000 --> 0:11:19,000
This is one subject's data.

233
0:11:20.689,000 --> 0:11:21,000
This is, in fact, Mike Pope's data.

234
0:11:22.46,000 --> 0:11:23,000
So what am I showing you here?

235
0:11:23.96,000 --> 0:11:27,000
When he was trading fours with me, improvising vs. memorized,

236
0:11:28.095,000 --> 0:11:3,000
his language areas lit up, his Broca's area,

237
0:11:30.868,000 --> 0:11:32,000
in the inferior frontal gyrus on the left.

238
0:11:32.954,000 --> 0:11:33,000
He had it also homologous on the right.

239
0:11:34.887,000 --> 0:11:37,000
This is an area thought to be involved in expressive communication.

240
0:11:38.07,000 --> 0:11:4,000
This whole notion that music is a language --

241
0:11:40.222,000 --> 0:11:42,000
maybe there's a neurologic basis to it after all,

242
0:11:42.545,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and we can see it when two musicians are having a musical conversation.

243
0:11:45.923,000 --> 0:11:46,000
So we've done this on eight subjects now,

244
0:11:47.92,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and we're getting all the data together,

245
0:11:49.873,000 --> 0:11:51,000
hopefully we'll have something to say about it meaningfully.

246
0:11:52.722,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Now when I think about improvisation and the language, what's next?

247
0:11:55.989,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Rap, of course, rap -- freestyle.

248
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
I've always been fascinated by freestyle.

249
0:12:01.031,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And let's play this video.

250
0:12:02.568,000 --> 0:12:04,000
(Video) Mos Def: Brown skin I be, standing five-ten I be

251
0:12:05.43,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Rockin' it when I be, in your vicinity

252
0:12:07.476,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Whole-style synergy, recognize symmetry

253
0:12:10.52,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Go and try to injure me, broke 'em down chemically

254
0:12:12.878,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Ain't the number 10 MC, talk about how been I be

255
0:12:15.331,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Styled it like Kennedy, late like a 10 to three

256
0:12:17.753,000 --> 0:12:19,000
When I say when I be, girls say bend that key cut

257
0:12:20.595,000 --> 0:12:21,000
CL: So there's a lot of analogy

258
0:12:22.437,000 --> 0:12:24,000
between what takes place in freestyle rap and jazz.

259
0:12:24.917,000 --> 0:12:26,000
There are a lot of correlates between the two forms of music,

260
0:12:27.858,000 --> 0:12:29,000
I think, in different time periods, in lot of ways,

261
0:12:30.329,000 --> 0:12:32,000
rap serves the same social function that jazz used to serve.

262
0:12:33.184,000 --> 0:12:34,000
So how do you study rap scientifically?

263
0:12:35.101,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And my colleagues think I'm crazy, but I think it's very viable.

264
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
This is what you do:

265
0:12:39.511,000 --> 0:12:41,000
You have a freestyle artist come and memorize a rap

266
0:12:42.282,000 --> 0:12:43,000
that you write for them,

267
0:12:43.527,000 --> 0:12:46,000
that they've never heard before, and then you have them freestyle.

268
0:12:46.983,000 --> 0:12:48,000
So I told my lab members that I would rap for TED,

269
0:12:49.425,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and they said, "No, you won't."

270
0:12:51.091,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And then I thought --

271
0:12:52.318,000 --> 0:12:53,000
(Laughter)

272
0:12:53.658,000 --> 0:12:58,000
(Applause)

273
0:12:59.408,000 --> 0:13:,000
But here's the thing.

274
0:13:00.712,000 --> 0:13:02,000
With this big screen, you can all rap with me. OK?

275
0:13:03.637,000 --> 0:13:04,000
So what we had them do

276
0:13:05.505,000 --> 0:13:07,000
was memorize this lower-left sound icon, please.

277
0:13:08.125,000 --> 0:13:1,000
This is the control condition. This is what they memorized.

278
0:13:11.042,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Computer: Memory, thump.

279
0:13:13.099,000 --> 0:13:15,000
CL: Thump of the beat in a known repeat

280
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Rhythm and rhyme, they make me complete

281
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
The climb is sublime when I'm on the mic

282
0:13:20.38,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Spittin' rhymes that hit you like a lightning strike

283
0:13:22.96,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Computer: Search.

284
0:13:24.148,000 --> 0:13:26,000
CL: I search for the truth in this eternal quest

285
0:13:26.516,000 --> 0:13:28,000
My passion's not fashion, you can see how I'm dressed

286
0:13:29.27,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Psychopathic words in my head appear

287
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Whisper these lyrics only I can hear

288
0:13:33.522,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Computer: Art.

289
0:13:34.718,000 --> 0:13:36,000
CL: The art of discovering and that which is hovering

290
0:13:37.372,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Inside the mind of those unconfined

291
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
All of these words keep pouring out like rain

292
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
I need a mad scientist to check my brain

293
0:13:45.019,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Computer: Stop.

294
0:13:46.35,000 --> 0:13:53,000
(Applause)

295
0:13:55.53,000 --> 0:13:57,000
I guarantee you that will never happen again.

296
0:13:57.728,000 --> 0:13:58,000
(Laughter)

297
0:13:59.693,000 --> 0:14:01,000
So now, what's great about these free-stylers,

298
0:14:01.905,000 --> 0:14:02,000
they will get cued different words.

299
0:14:03.791,000 --> 0:14:04,000
They don't know what's coming,

300
0:14:05.259,000 --> 0:14:06,000
but they'll hear something off the cuff.

301
0:14:07.199,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Go hit that right sound icon,

302
0:14:08.632,000 --> 0:14:1,000
there will be cued three square words: like, not and head.

303
0:14:11.376,000 --> 0:14:13,000
He doesn't know what's coming. Computer: Like.

304
0:14:13.554,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Freestyler: I'm like some kind of

305
0:14:15.348,000 --> 0:14:17,000
extraterrestrial, celestial scene

306
0:14:17.601,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Back in the days, I used to sit in pyramids and meditate

307
0:14:20.462,000 --> 0:14:22,000
With two microphones -- Computer: Head

308
0:14:22.659,000 --> 0:14:23,000
hovering over my head

309
0:14:24.017,000 --> 0:14:25,000
See if I could still listen,

310
0:14:25.404,000 --> 0:14:26,000
spittin' off the sound

311
0:14:26.715,000 --> 0:14:27,000
See what you grinning

About the message of apocalyptical

314
0:14:32.794,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Computer: Not.

315
0:14:33.978,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Not really though, 'cause I've got to keep it simple

Computer: Stop.

320
0:14:45.881,000 --> 0:14:47,000
CL: It's an incredible thing that's taking place.

321
0:14:48.216,000 --> 0:14:5,000
It's doing something neurologically remarkable.

322
0:14:50.466,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Whether or not you like the music is irrelevant.

323
0:14:52.806,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Creatively speaking, it's just a phenomenal thing.

324
0:14:55.231,000 --> 0:14:57,000
This is a short video of how we do this in a scanner.

[fMRI of Hip-Hop Rap]

(Laughter)

327

(Video) CL: We're here with Emmanuel.

328
0:15:02.268,000 --> 0:15:04,000
CL: That was recorded in the scanner, by the way.

329
0:15:04.598,000 --> 0:15:06,000
(Video) CL: That's Emmanuel in the scanner.

330
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
He's just memorized a rhyme for us.

[Control Condition Memorized Verses]

332
0:15:13.009,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Emmanuel: Top of the beat with no repeat

333
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
Rhythm and rhyme make me complete

334

Climb is sublime when I'm on the mic

335

Spittin' rhymes that'll hit you like a lightning strike

Computer: Search.

337
0:15:25.24,000 --> 0:15:27,000
I search for the truth in this eternal quest

338
0:15:27.524,000 --> 0:15:29,000
I'm passing on fashion; you can see how I'm dressed

339
0:15:30.124,000 --> 0:15:33,000
CL: I'm going to stop that there; so what do we see in his brain?

340
0:15:33.211,000 --> 0:15:34,000
This is four rappers' brains.

341
0:15:34.893,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And we do see language areas lighting up,

342
0:15:36.953,000 --> 0:15:37,000
but then, eyes closed --

343
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
when you are freestyling vs. memorizing,

344
0:15:41.597,000 --> 0:15:43,000
you've got major visual areas lighting up.

345
0:15:43.775,000 --> 0:15:46,000
You've got major cerebellar activity, which is involved in motor coordination.

346
0:15:47.488,000 --> 0:15:5,000
You have heightened brain activity when you're doing a comparable task,

347
0:15:50.868,000 --> 0:15:52,000
when that one task is creative and the other task is memorized.

348
0:15:53.85,000 --> 0:15:55,000
It's very preliminary, but I think it's kind of cool.

349
0:15:56.658,000 --> 0:15:58,000
To conclude, we've got a lot of questions to ask,

350
0:15:58.99,000 --> 0:16:,000
and like I said, we'll ask questions here, not answer them.

351
0:16:01.919,000 --> 0:16:04,000
But we want to get at the root of what is creative genius neurologically,

352
0:16:05.394,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and I think, with these methods, we're getting close.

353
0:16:07.975,000 --> 0:16:09,000
And I think, hopefully in the next 10, 20 years,

354
0:16:10.302,000 --> 0:16:11,000
you'll see real, meaningful studies

355
0:16:12.223,000 --> 0:16:15,000
that say science has to catch up to art,

356
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
and maybe we're starting now to get there.

357
0:16:17.672,000 --> 0:16:18,000
Thank you for your time, I appreciate it.

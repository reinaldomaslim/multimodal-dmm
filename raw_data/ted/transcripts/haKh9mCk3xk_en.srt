1
0:00:19.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I hope you'll understand my English.

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
In the mornings it is terrible, and the afternoon is worst.

3
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
During many years, I made some speeches starting with this

5
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
saying: "City is not a problem, it's a solution."

6
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And more and more, I'm convinced that

7
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
it's not only a solution for a country,

8
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
but it's a solution for the problem of climate change.

9
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
But we have a very pessimistic approach about the cities.

10
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I'm working in cities for almost 40 years,

11
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and where every mayor is trying to tell me his city is so big,

12
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
or the other mayors say, "We don't have financial resources,"

13
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I would like to say

14
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
from the experience I had: every city in the world

15
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
can be improved in less than three years.

16
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
There's no matter of scale. It's not a question of scale,

17
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
it's not a question of financial resources.

18
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Every problem in a city has to have its own equation of co-responsibility

19
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and also a design.

20
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So to start, I want to introduce some characters

21
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
from a book I made for teenagers.

22
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
The best example of quality of life is the turtle

23
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
because the turtle is an example of living and working together.

24
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And when you realize that the casque of the turtle

25
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
looks like an urban tessitura,

26
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and can we imagine, if we cut the casque of the turtle, how sad she's going to be?

27
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And that's what we're doing in our cities:

28
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
living here, working here, having leisure here.

29
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And most of the people are leaving the city

30
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and living outside of the city.

31
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So, the other character is Otto, the automobile.

32
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
He is invited for a party -- he never wants to leave.

33
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
The chairs are on the tables and still drinking,

34
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and he drinks a lot. (Laughter)

35
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And he coughs a lot. Very egotistical:

36
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
he carries only one or two people

37
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and he asks always for more infrastructure.

38
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Freeways.

39
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
He's a very demanding person.

40
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And on the other hand, Accordion, the friendly bus,

41
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
he carries 300 people --

42
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
275 in Sweden; 300 Brazilians. (Laughter)

43
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Speaking about the design: every city has its own design.

44
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Curitiba, my city: three million in the metropolitan area,

45
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
1,800,000 people in the city itself.

46
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Curitiba, Rio: it's like two birds kissing themselves.

47
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Oaxaca, San Francisco -- it's very easy:

48
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Market Street, Van Ness and the waterfront.

49
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And every city has its own design.

50
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
But to make it happen, sometimes you have to propose a scenario

51
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and to propose a design --

52
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
an idea that everyone, or the large majority,

53
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
will help you to make it happen.

54
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And that's the structure of the city of Curitiba.

55
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And it's an example of living and working together.

56
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And this is where we have more density;

57
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
it's where we have more public transport.

58
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So, this system started in '74. We started with 25,000 passengers a day,

59
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
now it's 2,200,000 passengers a day.

60
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And it took 25 years until another city ...

61
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
which is Bogota, and they did a very good job.

62
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And now there's 83 cities all over the world that they

63
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
are doing what they call the BRT of Curitiba.

64
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And one thing: it's important not for only your own city;

65
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
every city, besides its normal problems,

66
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
they have a very important role

67
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
in being with the whole humanity.

68
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
That means mostly two main issues --

69
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
mobility and sustainability -- are becoming very important for the cities.

70
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And this is an articulated bus, double-articulated.

71
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And we are very close to my house.

72
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
You can come when you are in Curitiba and have a coffee there.

73
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And that's the evolution of the system.

74
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
What in the design that made the difference

75
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
is the boarding tubes:

76
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
the boarding tube gives to the bus the same performance as a subway.

77
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
That's why, I'm trying to say,

78
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
it's like metro-nizing the bus.

79
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
This is the design of the bus,

80
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and you can pay before entering the bus you're boarding.

81
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And for handicapped, they can use this as a normal system.

82
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
What I'm trying to say is

83
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
the major contribution on carbon emissions are from the cars --

84
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
more than 50 percent -- so when we depend only on cars, it's ...

85
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
-- that's why when we're talking about sustainability,

86
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
it's not enough, green buildings.

87
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
It's not enough, a new materials.

88
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
It's not enough, new sources of energy.

89
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It's the concept of the city, the design of the city,

90
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that's also important, too. And also, how to teach the children.

91
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I'll speak on this later on.

92
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Our idea of mobility is trying

93
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
to make the connections between all the systems.

94
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
We started in '83, proposing for the city of Rio

95
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
how to connect the subway with the bus.

96
0:07:28.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
The subway was against, of course.

97
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And 23 years after, they called us to develop -- we're developing this idea.

98
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And you can understand how different it's going to be,

99
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
the image of Rio with the system --

100
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
one-minute frequency.

101
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And it's not Shanghai,

102
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
it's not being colored during the day, only at night

103
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:57,000
it will look this way.

104
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And before you say it's a Norman Foster design,

105
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
we designed this in '83.

106
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And this is the model,

107
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
how it's going to work. So, it's the same system;

108
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
the vehicle is different. And that's the model.

109
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
What I'm trying to say is, I'm not trying

110
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
to prove which system of transport is better.

111
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I'm trying to say we have to combine

112
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
all the systems, and with one condition:

113
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
never -- if you have a subway, if you have surface systems,

114
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
if you have any kind of system --

115
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
never compete in the same space.

116
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And coming back to the car, I always used to say

117
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
that the car is like your mother-in-law:

118
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
you have to have good relationship with her,

119
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
but she cannot command your life.

120
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
So, when the only woman in your life is your mother-in-law,

121
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
you have a problem. (Laughter)

122
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
So, all the ideas about how to transform through design --

123
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
old quarries and open universities and botanic garden --

124
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
all of it's related to how we teach the children.

125
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And the children, we teach during six months how to separate their garbage.

126
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And after, the children teach their parents.

127
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And now we have 70 percent --

128
0:09:59.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
since 20 years, it's the highest rate of separation of garbage in the world.

129
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Seven zero.

130
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
(Applause)

131
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
So teach the children.

132
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I would like to say, if we want to have a sustainable world

133
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
we have to work with everything what's said,

134
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
but don't forget the cities and the children.

135
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
I'm working in a museum and also a multi-use city,

136
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
because you cannot have empty places during 18 hours a day.

137
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:42,000
You should have always

138
0:10:42.33,000 --> 0:10:46,000
a structure of living and working together.

139
0:10:46.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Try to understand the sectors in the city

140
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
that could play different roles during the 24 hours.

141
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Another issue is, a city's like our family portrait.

142
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
We don't rip our family portrait,

143
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
even if we don't like the nose of our uncle,

144
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
because this portrait is you.

145
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And these are the references that we have in any city.

146
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
This is the main pedestrian mall;

147
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
we did it in 72 hours. Yes, you have to be fast.

148
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And these are the references from our ethnic contribution.

149
0:11:30.33,000 --> 0:11:32,000
This is the Italian portal,

150
0:11:32.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
the Ukrainian park, the Polish park, the Japanese square, the German park.

151
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
All of a sudden, the Soviet Union, they split.

152
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And since we have people from

153
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, [unclear],

154
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
we have to stop the program.

155
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
(Laughter)

156
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Don't forget: creativity starts when you cut a zero from your budget.

157
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
If you cut two zeros, it's much better.

158
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And this is the Wire Opera theater. We did it in two months.

159
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Parks -- old quarries that they were transformed into parks.

160
0:12:18.33,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Quarries once made the nature, and

161
0:12:23.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
sometimes we took this and we transformed.

162
0:12:27.33,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And every part can be transformed;

163
0:12:32.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
every frog can be transformed in a prince.

164
0:12:38.33,000 --> 0:12:42,000
So, in a city, you have to work fast.

165
0:12:42.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Planning takes time. And I'm proposing urban acupuncture.

166
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
That means me, with some focal ideas to help the normal process of planning.

167
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And this is an acupuncture note --

168
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
or I.M. Pei's. Some small ones

169
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
can make the city better.

170
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
The smallest park in New York, the most beautiful:

171
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:16,000
32 meters.

172
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
So, I want just to end saying

173
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:27,000
that you can always propose new materials -- new sustainable materials --

174
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
but keep in mind that we have to work fast

175
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:41,000
to the end, because we don't have the whole time to plan.

176
0:13:41.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And I think creativity, innovation is starting.

177
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And we cannot have all the answers.

178
0:13:52.33,000 --> 0:13:55,000
So when you start --

179
0:13:55.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
and we cannot be so prepotent on having all the answers --

180
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:05,000
it's important starting and having the contribution from people,

181
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and they could teach you

182
0:14:08.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
if you're not in the right track.

183
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
At the end, I would like if you can help me to sing the sustainable song.

184
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:22,000
OK?

185
0:14:22.33,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Please, allow me just two minutes.

186
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
You're going to make the music and the rhythm.

187
0:14:31.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000

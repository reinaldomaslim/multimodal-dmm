1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Ninety-nine percent of us have the dream of listeners.

2
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Not being the musicians -- the listeners, right?

3
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And we crave one thing,

4
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
even though we kind of don't know it all the time.

5
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
We crave to be in the room with the musician

6
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
the day it was recorded, the day it was played.

7
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And we go to live concerts, and we get that as much as we can.

8
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But then we listen to the other 99 percent of our stuff recorded.

9
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And it turns out the further back you go in history,

10
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
the little rougher it sounds.

11
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And so we said, there's a solution to this.

12
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Let's separate the performance, as a thing,

13
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
out from the recording, which was how it was made.

14
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
You know, the thing with microphones in the room and all that day.

15
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But the performance itself was how the musicians worked their fingers,

16
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and what instruments they were using.

17
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And it's the data hidden inside the recording.

18
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
In order to do this, it's a lot of hardware and software

19
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
that runs in a very high resolution.

20
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And Yamaha makes an incredible thing called the Disklavier Pro

21
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that looks like a nice grand piano there.

22
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And you probably didn't realize it's going to do all these things --

23
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
but full of solenoids, and fiber optics, and computers

24
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and all this kind of stuff. The highest resolution out of Japan.

25
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And this just didn't work until we could cross this line that says high-definition.

26
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And we were able to cross this line, called the uncanny valley,

27
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
in terms of -- artificial intelligence terms.

28
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
We have a process where we, you know,

29
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
kind of put it into the computer and digitize it, and then a whole lot of analysis.

30
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And we look at every single note,

31
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and all the attributes of those notes:

32
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
how hard they were struck, and how they were held down,

33
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and how you move the fingers.

34
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So we had to develop a whole new science of how you move your fingers.

35
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And, you know, it's a thing your piano teacher teaches you,

36
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
but we never had a science behind these kinds of things.

37
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I'm going to start with Glenn Gould.

38
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
He died 25 years ago this year, and was born 75 years ago this year.

39
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Was a beloved pianist, maybe the great cult pianist of the twentieth century.

40
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
He just got tired of being in front of an audience,

41
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and felt like -- a performing monkey was, in fact, his term.

42
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So he stepped back, and did nothing but the crafting of his work.

43
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And Gould's specialty was playing Bach.

44
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
His maybe most famous recording

45
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
was something called "The Goldberg Variations."

46
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Bach only wrote themes and variations one time.

47
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
He wrote some early pieces,

48
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
but late in his life, in his mature period,

49
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
he said, "Here's a theme -- 30 variations."

50
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
In fact, the theme isn't even the melody, it's the bass line.

51
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And Gould recorded it in two major recordings that you may know about,

52
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
one in mono, and one in stereo.

53
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And the one in mono, by the way, he used the pedal,

54
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and as he got older, he said, "No, no, wait a minute.

55
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I'm going to get very scientific about this, and not use the pedal."

56
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
What I'd like you to hear live is the 1955 version,

57
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and we'll play the first couple pieces of it.

58
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Glenn Gould, 1955.

59
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
(Music)

60
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
How about that?

61
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
(Applause)

62
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
So let me tell you a little bit how this was done.

63
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
First of all, let me get you to the end step.

64
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
This is -- we have a fairly complex process

65
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
that, you know, software and musicians and so on,

66
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
but when we're all done, we know that the ear is the final arbiter.

67
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
We can play the original in one ear, and a new recording in the other.

68
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So I'm going to do this for you right now, what you just heard.

69
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And in the right speaker is going to be the original recording,

70
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and the left speaker is going to be the new recording,

71
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
actually of an instrument just like that one,

72
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and I'm going to play them together at the same time.

73
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(Music)

74
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
That's the original. [Unclear] That's the two together.

75
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
(Music)

76
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Before "Jurassic Park,"

77
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
there was no science for how skin hung off of muscle, right?

78
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So, in the video world,

79
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
we've been able to invent, in our lifetimes, natural behavior.

80
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And this is kind of another example

81
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
of putting a science behind natural behavior.

82
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And then you heard the original.

83
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Ultimately, I started with the experience.

84
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And the experience is: I want to be in the room and hear the musicians.

85
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Lots of you can afford to buy one of these.

86
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
But, if not, there is now high-definition surround sound.

87
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And I got to tell you, if you haven't heard high-definition surround,

88
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
go down to your audio dealer, your audiophile dealer.

89
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
It's so involving compared to regular stereo.

90
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
But if you don't have that, maybe you can listen on your headphones.

91
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And so on the same disk we have five recordings --

92
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Sony has five recordings.

93
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And you could listen in headphones

94
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
with this thing called binaural recording.

95
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And it's a dummy head that sits in front of the instrument,

96
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and it's got microphones where the ears are.

97
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And when you put on headphones, and you listen to this,

98
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
you're inside of Glenn Gould's body.

99
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And it is a chuckle until, you know, the musicians,

100
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
who are musicians who play the piano, listen to this, say,

101
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
"I can't believe it! It's just what it's like to play the piano."

102
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Except now you're inside Glenn Gould's body playing the piano,

103
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and it feels like your fingers are making the decisions

104
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and moving through the whole process.

105
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
It's a game changer.

106
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Here's now something we know in spectacular quality.

107
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
The whole process is very sensitive to temperature and humidity.

108
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
What you heard today was not perfect.

109
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
It's an amalgam of wood, and cast iron, and felt,

110
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and steel strings, and all these,

111
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and they're all amazingly sensitive to temperature and humidity.

112
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So when you go into the recording session,

113
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
you get to stop after every piece and rebuild the piano if you need to.

114
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
There's the whole action there, sitting, kind of, on the side,

115
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and the dummy head and our recording engineers

116
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
standing around while we rebuild the piano.

117
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Without putting dates next to these things,

118
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
step-by-step music will be turned into data,

119
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
like every field that's occurred in the past 35 or 40 years.

120
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Audio has come very late to this game --

121
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
I'm not talking about digitizing, and bits, and re-mastering.

122
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I'm talking about turn it into the data that it was made from,

123
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
which is how it was performed.

124
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And audio came very late because our ears are so hard to fool --

125
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
they're high-resolution, and they're wired straight to our emotions,

126
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and you can't trick them very easily.

127
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement, you know.

128
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
All right, there's this episode of "Star Trek."

129
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
(Laughter)

130
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I get it -- it was all just laid in for me yesterday there.

131
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
The episode of "Star Trek" for me was James Daly played Methuselah --

132
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
remember this one?

133
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And at some point he's dancing with his --

134
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and I won't ruin the episode for you, from 1967.

135
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Right, do you know where I'm going?

136
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And Nimoy, I'm sorry, Spock sits down at the piano,

137
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and he starts playing this Brahms waltz, and they all dance to it.

138
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And then Spock turns round, he goes,

139
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
"James, I know all of the Brahms waltzes,

140
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and I don't believe this is one of them in the category."

141
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
That's where I'm at.

142
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
I want to hear the waltzes Brahms didn't write.

143
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
I want to hear the pieces that Horowitz didn't play.

144
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
But I believe we're on a path now, when we get to data,

145
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
that we can distill styles, and templates, and formulas, and all these kinds of things,

146
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
again, that you've seen happen in the computer graphics world.

147
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
It's now coming in this world.

148
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
The transition will be this one.

149
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
It says right now, we think music is notes and how they're played.

150
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And I believe this is coming.

151
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Because what you've just heard was a computer playing data --

152
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
no Glenn Gould in the room.

153
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
But yet, it was human.

154
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And I believe you'll get to the next step, the real dream of listeners.

155
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Every time you listen to a recording today,

156
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
every time you take out your iPod and whatever,

157
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
every time you listen to it, it's the same thing -- it's frozen.

158
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Wouldn't it be cool if every time you listened, it could be different?

159
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
This morning, you're sadder, you want to hear your song,

160
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
the same song, played sadder than you did yesterday.

161
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
You want to hear it played by different musicians.

162
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
You want to hear it in different rooms and whatever.

163
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
We've seen all these "Star Treks," and they're all holodeck episodes as well.

164
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Every time I listen to that, I get goose bumps.

165
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
It's so amazing, it's so exciting.

166
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Every time I listen to that recording it's like, "Oh my God,

167
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
I can't believe I'm in the same room. I can't believe this is happening."

168
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
It's a way better experience

169
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
than whatever you're used to listening to, in whatever form.

170
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And lastly, I will wrap up with one minute of Art Tatum.

171
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
So I've really overshot my budget here.

172
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
We made a new recording of him

173
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
playing in the Shrine Auditorium in September.

174
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
It was a concert he recorded in the Shrine Auditorium in 1949.

175
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And I've got to tell you, we have this lab

176
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
where we build and measure everything, back in Raleigh, North Carolina,

177
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and we flew out to Los Angeles.

178
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And as the president of the company,

179
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
I didn't feel real comfortable about where we were.

180
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
That's a real uncomfortable feeling,

181
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
when all the equipment's come out and a whole Sony team,

182
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and people are going to be sitting there in the audience.

183
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And we put the piano on the sweet spot of the stage in the Shrine,

184
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
which has not changed since 1949, still seats 6,000 people.

185
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And on the sweet spot on the stage, Tatum starts playing ...

186
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and every note, every beat, every slur, every accent, every pedal

187
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
was perfect, because he played it for that room on that day.

188
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And we captured all that data all over again.

189
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And I want you to hear that right now.

190
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And fortunately, it's right in here.

191
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
This is an encore he used to do.

192
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
It's one minute long.

193
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
It's an Irish jig, and I want you to hear his humor.

194
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:13:23,000
(Music)

195
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
(Applause)

196
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And that's just what the live audience did.

197
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
(Applause)

198
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
So thank you very much, Michael, thank you for the opportunity.

1
0:00:13.372,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Every day, I listen to harrowing stories of people fleeing for their lives,

2
0:00:19.545,000 --> 0:00:22,000
across dangerous borders and unfriendly seas.

3
0:00:24.109,000 --> 0:00:28,000
But there's one story that keeps me awake at night,

4
0:00:28.628,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and it's about Doaa.

5
0:00:30.208,000 --> 0:00:32,000
A Syrian refugee, 19 years old,

6
0:00:33.055,000 --> 0:00:38,000
she was living a grinding existence in Egypt working day wages.

7
0:00:38.915,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Her dad was constantly thinking of his thriving business back in Syria

8
0:00:44.326,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that had been blown to pieces by a bomb.

9
0:00:48.238,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And the war that drove them there was still raging in its fourth year.

10
0:00:54.999,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And the community that once welcomed them there

11
0:00:58.232,000 --> 0:01:,000
had become weary of them.

12
0:01:01.248,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And one day, men on motorcycles tried to kidnap her.

13
0:01:05.084,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Once an aspiring student thinking only of her future,

14
0:01:09.857,000 --> 0:01:12,000
now she was scared all the time.

15
0:01:14.269,000 --> 0:01:16,000
But she was also full of hope,

16
0:01:16.302,000 --> 0:01:21,000
because she was in love with a fellow Syrian refugee named Bassem.

17
0:01:21.349,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Bassem was also struggling in Egypt, and he said to Doaa,

18
0:01:26.383,000 --> 0:01:29,000
"Let's go to Europe; seek asylum, safety.

19
0:01:29.773,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I will work, you can study -- the promise of a new life."

20
0:01:34.829,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And he asked her father for her hand in marriage.

21
0:01:38.724,000 --> 0:01:43,000
But they knew to get to Europe they had to risk their lives,

22
0:01:44.264,000 --> 0:01:46,000
traveling across the Mediterranean Sea,

23
0:01:46.788,000 --> 0:01:51,000
putting their hands in smugglers', notorious for their cruelty.

24
0:01:53.173,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And Doaa was terrified of the water.

25
0:01:57.292,000 --> 0:02:,000
She always had been. She never learned to swim.

26
0:02:02.222,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It was August that year, and already 2,000 people had died

27
0:02:06.999,000 --> 0:02:07,000
trying to cross the Mediterranean,

28
0:02:08.977,000 --> 0:02:11,000
but Doaa knew of a friend who had made it all the way to Northern Europe,

29
0:02:12.971,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and she thought, "Maybe we can, too."

30
0:02:15.999,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So she asked her parents if they could go,

31
0:02:19.025,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and after a painful discussion, they consented,

32
0:02:22.391,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and Bassem paid his entire life savings -- 2,500 dollars each --

33
0:02:28.545,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to the smugglers.

34
0:02:30.821,000 --> 0:02:33,000
It was a Saturday morning when the call came,

35
0:02:34.06,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and they were taken by bus to a beach, hundreds of people on the beach.

36
0:02:38.873,000 --> 0:02:42,000
They were taken then by small boats onto an old fishing boat,

37
0:02:42.945,000 --> 0:02:44,000
500 of them crammed onto that boat,

38
0:02:45.527,000 --> 0:02:47,000
300 below, [200] above.

39
0:02:49.466,000 --> 0:02:53,000
There were Syrians, Palestinians, Africans, Muslims and Christians,

40
0:02:54.028,000 --> 0:02:59,000
100 children, including Sandra -- little Sandra, six years old --

41
0:02:59.38,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and Masa, 18 months.

42
0:03:03.498,000 --> 0:03:06,000
There were families on that boat, crammed together shoulder to shoulder,

43
0:03:07.42,000 --> 0:03:08,000
feet to feet.

44
0:03:08.976,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Doaa was sitting with her legs crammed up to her chest,

45
0:03:12.808,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Bassem holding her hand.

46
0:03:16.386,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Day two on the water, they were sick with worry

47
0:03:19.117,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and sick to their stomachs from the rough sea.

48
0:03:23.109,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Day three, Doaa had a premonition.

49
0:03:27.068,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And she said to Bassem, "I fear we're not going to make it.

50
0:03:31.645,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I fear the boat is going to sink."

51
0:03:34.517,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And Bassem said to her, "Please be patient.

52
0:03:37.69,000 --> 0:03:4,000
We will make it to Sweden, we will get married

53
0:03:40.896,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and we will have a future."

54
0:03:43.751,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Day four, the passengers were getting agitated.

55
0:03:47.628,000 --> 0:03:5,000
They asked the captain, "When will we get there?"

56
0:03:50.788,000 --> 0:03:53,000
He told them to shut up, and he insulted them.

57
0:03:54.74,000 --> 0:03:57,000
He said, "In 16 hours we will reach the shores of Italy."

58
0:03:58.506,000 --> 0:04:01,000
They were weak and weary.

59
0:04:01.704,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Soon they saw a boat approach -- a smaller boat, 10 men on board,

60
0:04:05.999,000 --> 0:04:08,000
who started shouting at them, hurling insults,

61
0:04:09.438,000 --> 0:04:13,000
throwing sticks, asking them to all disembark

62
0:04:13.812,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and get on this smaller, more unseaworthy boat.

63
0:04:17.551,000 --> 0:04:2,000
The parents were terrified for their children,

64
0:04:21.093,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and they collectively refused to disembark.

65
0:04:26.157,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So the boat sped away in anger,

66
0:04:29.297,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and a half an hour later, came back

67
0:04:33.551,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and started deliberately ramming a hole in the side of Doaa's boat,

68
0:04:39.627,000 --> 0:04:41,000
just below where she and Bassem were sitting.

69
0:04:43.764,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And she heard how they yelled,

70
0:04:47.127,000 --> 0:04:5,000
"Let the fish eat your flesh!"

71
0:04:51.599,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And they started laughing as the boat capsized and sank.

72
0:04:57.999,000 --> 0:05:,000
The 300 people below deck were doomed.

73
0:05:01.757,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Doaa was holding on to the side of the boat as it sank,

74
0:05:06.37,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and watched in horror as a small child was cut to pieces by the propeller.

75
0:05:14.355,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Bassem said to her, "Please let go,

76
0:05:16.578,000 --> 0:05:19,000
or you'll be swept in and the propeller will kill you, too."

77
0:05:20.267,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And remember -- she can't swim.

78
0:05:22.999,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But she let go and she started moving her arms and her legs,

79
0:05:27.211,000 --> 0:05:28,000
thinking, "This is swimming."

80
0:05:28.671,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And miraculously, Bassem found a life ring.

81
0:05:33.806,000 --> 0:05:35,000
It was one of those child's rings

82
0:05:35.878,000 --> 0:05:39,000
that they use to play in swimming pools and on calm seas.

83
0:05:39.999,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And Doaa climbed onto the ring,

84
0:05:42.068,000 --> 0:05:45,000
her arms and her legs dangling by the side.

85
0:05:46.835,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Bassem was a good swimmer,

86
0:05:48.8,000 --> 0:05:51,000
so he held her hand and tread water.

87
0:05:54.064,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Around them there were corpses.

88
0:05:56.026,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Around 100 people survived initially,

89
0:05:58.518,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and they started coming together in groups, praying for rescue.

90
0:06:03.083,000 --> 0:06:07,000
But when a day went by and no one came,

91
0:06:07.424,000 --> 0:06:08,000
some people gave up hope,

92
0:06:09.273,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and Doaa and Bassem watched

93
0:06:11.471,000 --> 0:06:17,000
as men in the distance took their life vests off and sank into the water.

94
0:06:19.052,000 --> 0:06:24,000
One man approached them with a small baby perched on his shoulder,

95
0:06:24.999,000 --> 0:06:25,000
nine months old -- Malek.

96
0:06:26.673,000 --> 0:06:31,000
He was holding onto a gas canister to stay afloat, and he said to them,

97
0:06:31.776,000 --> 0:06:32,000
"I fear I am not going to survive.

98
0:06:33.75,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I'm too weak. I don't have the courage anymore."

99
0:06:36.829,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And he handed little Malek over to Bassem and to Doaa,

100
0:06:41.999,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and they perched her onto the life ring.

101
0:06:45.774,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So now they were three, Doaa, Bassem and little Malek.

102
0:06:51.212,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And let me take a pause in this story right here

103
0:06:54.365,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and ask the question:

104
0:06:56.687,000 --> 0:07:,000
why do refugees like Doaa take these kinds of risks?

105
0:07:03.061,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Millions of refugees are living in exile, in limbo.

106
0:07:09.232,000 --> 0:07:13,000
They're living in countries [fleeing] from a war that has been raging

107
0:07:13.556,000 --> 0:07:15,000
for four years.

108
0:07:17.634,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Even if they wanted to return, they can't.

109
0:07:20.819,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Their homes, their businesses,

110
0:07:23.605,000 --> 0:07:26,000
their towns and their cities have been completely destroyed.

111
0:07:27.151,000 --> 0:07:29,000
This is a UNESCO World Heritage City,

112
0:07:29.999,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Homs, in Syria.

113
0:07:33.097,000 --> 0:07:37,000
So people continue to flee into neighboring countries,

114
0:07:37.686,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and we build refugee camps for them in the desert.

115
0:07:41.309,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Hundreds of thousands of people live in camps like these,

116
0:07:45.343,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and thousands and thousands more, millions, live in towns and cities.

117
0:07:50.34,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And the communities,

118
0:07:51.582,000 --> 0:07:53,000
the neighboring countries that once welcomed them

119
0:07:54.462,000 --> 0:07:55,000
with open arms and hearts

120
0:07:56.248,000 --> 0:07:57,000
are overwhelmed.

121
0:07:58.731,000 --> 0:08:02,000
There are simply not enough schools, water systems, sanitation.

122
0:08:03.747,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Even rich European countries could never handle such an influx

123
0:08:08.394,000 --> 0:08:11,000
without massive investment.

124
0:08:13.407,000 --> 0:08:18,000
The Syria war has driven almost four million people over the borders,

125
0:08:18.457,000 --> 0:08:22,000
but over seven million people are on the run inside the country.

126
0:08:23.418,000 --> 0:08:26,000
That means that over half the Syrian population

127
0:08:27.133,000 --> 0:08:29,000
has been forced to flee.

128
0:08:29.766,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Back to those neighboring countries hosting so many.

129
0:08:35.114,000 --> 0:08:4,000
They feel that the richer world has done too little to support them.

130
0:08:41.401,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And days have turned into months, months into years.

131
0:08:46.483,000 --> 0:08:49,000
A refugee's stay is supposed to be temporary.

132
0:08:50.079,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Back to Doaa and Bassem in the water.

133
0:08:53.424,000 --> 0:08:57,000
It was their second day, and Bassem was getting very weak.

134
0:08:58.764,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And now it was Doaa's turn to say to Bassem,

135
0:09:02.789,000 --> 0:09:07,000
"My love, please hold on to hope, to our future. We will make it."

136
0:09:09.376,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And he said to her,

137
0:09:12.081,000 --> 0:09:16,000
"I'm sorry, my love, that I put you in this situation.

138
0:09:16.542,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I have never loved anyone as much as I love you."

139
0:09:22.871,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And he released himself into the water,

140
0:09:26.293,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and Doaa watched as the love of her life drowned before her eyes.

141
0:09:35.888,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Later that day,

142
0:09:38.328,000 --> 0:09:43,000
a mother came up to Doaa with her small 18-month-old daughter, Masa.

143
0:09:44.741,000 --> 0:09:46,000
This was the little girl I showed you in the picture earlier,

144
0:09:47.69,000 --> 0:09:48,000
with the life vests.

145
0:09:49.562,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Her older sister Sandra had just drowned,

146
0:09:51.779,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and her mother knew she had to do everything in her power

147
0:09:55.922,000 --> 0:09:56,000
to save her daughter.

148
0:09:57.993,000 --> 0:10:,000
And she said to Doaa, "Please take this child.

149
0:10:01.874,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Let her be part of you. I will not survive."

150
0:10:07.125,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And then she went away and drowned.

151
0:10:11.825,000 --> 0:10:15,000
So Doaa, the 19-year-old refugee who was terrified of the water,

152
0:10:16.083,000 --> 0:10:17,000
who couldn't swim,

153
0:10:17.999,000 --> 0:10:22,000
found herself in charge of two little baby kids.

154
0:10:23.615,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And they were thirsty and they were hungry and they were agitated,

155
0:10:27.32,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and she tried her best to amuse them,

156
0:10:30.042,000 --> 0:10:34,000
to sing to them, to say words to them from the Quran.

157
0:10:35.234,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Around them, the bodies were bloating and turning black.

158
0:10:39.692,000 --> 0:10:4,000
The sun was blazing during the day.

159
0:10:41.462,000 --> 0:10:43,000
At night, there was a cold moon and fog.

160
0:10:44.206,000 --> 0:10:45,000
It was very frightening.

161
0:10:46.976,000 --> 0:10:5,000
On the fourth day in the water, this is how Doaa probably looked

162
0:10:51.739,000 --> 0:10:53,000
on the ring with her two children.

163
0:10:53.884,000 --> 0:10:56,000
A woman came on the fourth day and approached her

164
0:10:57.455,000 --> 0:11:,000
and asked her to take another child --

165
0:11:00.59,000 --> 0:11:03,000
a little boy, just four years old.

166
0:11:04.999,000 --> 0:11:08,000
When Doaa took the little boy and the mother drowned,

167
0:11:09.04,000 --> 0:11:1,000
she said to the sobbing child,

168
0:11:11.024,000 --> 0:11:14,000
"She just went away to find you water and food."

169
0:11:16.388,000 --> 0:11:17,000
But his heart soon stopped,

170
0:11:18.405,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and Doaa had to release the little boy into the water.

171
0:11:23.023,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Later that day,

172
0:11:25.072,000 --> 0:11:28,000
she looked up into the sky with hope,

173
0:11:28.375,000 --> 0:11:32,000
because she saw two planes crossing in the sky.

174
0:11:32.414,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And she waved her arms, hoping they would see her,

175
0:11:36.937,000 --> 0:11:37,000
but the planes were soon gone.

176
0:11:39.317,000 --> 0:11:41,000
But that afternoon, as the sun was going down,

177
0:11:42.244,000 --> 0:11:44,000
she saw a boat, a merchant vessel.

178
0:11:46.109,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And she said, "Please, God, let them rescue me."

179
0:11:50.15,000 --> 0:11:53,000
She waved her arms and she felt like she shouted for about two hours.

180
0:11:54.134,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And it had become dark, but finally the searchlights found her

181
0:11:58.768,000 --> 0:12:,000
and they extended a rope,

182
0:12:00.999,000 --> 0:12:04,000
astonished to see a woman clutching onto two babies.

183
0:12:06.77,000 --> 0:12:09,000
They pulled them onto the boat, they got oxygen and blankets,

184
0:12:10.282,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and a Greek helicopter came to pick them up

185
0:12:13.313,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and take them to the island of Crete.

186
0:12:16.353,000 --> 0:12:19,000
But Doaa looked down and asked, "What of Malek?"

187
0:12:20.4,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And they told her the little baby did not survive --

188
0:12:23.999,000 --> 0:12:26,000
she drew her last breath in the boat's clinic.

189
0:12:28.203,000 --> 0:12:33,000
But Doaa was sure that as they had been pulled up onto the rescue boat,

190
0:12:33.999,000 --> 0:12:36,000
that little baby girl had been smiling.

191
0:12:39.278,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Only 11 people survived that wreck, of the 500.

192
0:12:46.304,000 --> 0:12:5,000
There was never an international investigation into what happened.

193
0:12:50.999,000 --> 0:12:54,000
There were some media reports about mass murder at sea,

194
0:12:55.118,000 --> 0:12:56,000
a terrible tragedy,

195
0:12:56.467,000 --> 0:12:58,000
but that was only for one day.

196
0:12:59.49,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And then the news cycle moved on.

197
0:13:04.536,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Meanwhile, in a pediatric hospital on Crete,

198
0:13:09.102,000 --> 0:13:12,000
little Masa was on the edge of death.

199
0:13:13.681,000 --> 0:13:16,000
She was really dehydrated. Her kidneys were failing.

200
0:13:17.415,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Her glucose levels were dangerously low.

201
0:13:19.463,000 --> 0:13:22,000
The doctors did everything in their medical power to save them,

202
0:13:23.053,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and the Greek nurses never left her side,

203
0:13:26.737,000 --> 0:13:28,000
holding her, hugging her, singing her words.

204
0:13:28.888,000 --> 0:13:33,000
My colleagues also visited and said pretty words to her in Arabic.

205
0:13:34.481,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Amazingly, little Masa survived.

206
0:13:40.192,000 --> 0:13:45,000
And soon the Greek press started reporting about the miracle baby,

207
0:13:46.152,000 --> 0:13:51,000
who had survived four days in the water without food or anything to drink,

208
0:13:51.843,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and offers to adopt her came from all over the country.

209
0:13:57.466,000 --> 0:14:,000
And meanwhile, Doaa was in another hospital on Crete,

210
0:14:00.88,000 --> 0:14:01,000
thin, dehydrated.

211
0:14:03.571,000 --> 0:14:08,000
An Egyptian family took her into their home as soon as she was released.

212
0:14:10.248,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And soon word went around about Doaa's survival,

213
0:14:15.019,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and a phone number was published on Facebook.

214
0:14:19.3,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Messages started coming in.

215
0:14:22.999,000 --> 0:14:26,000
"Doaa, do you know what happened to my brother?

216
0:14:27.811,000 --> 0:14:33,000
My sister? My parents? My friends? Do you know if they survived?"

217
0:14:35.201,000 --> 0:14:38,000
One of those messages said,

218
0:14:38.999,000 --> 0:14:42,000
"I believe you saved my little niece, Masa."

219
0:14:44.249,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And it had this photo.

220
0:14:47.741,000 --> 0:14:49,000
This was from Masa's uncle,

221
0:14:50.027,000 --> 0:14:54,000
a Syrian refugee who had made it to Sweden with his family

222
0:14:54.773,000 --> 0:14:56,000
and also Masa's older sister.

223
0:14:57.647,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Soon, we hope, Masa will be reunited with him in Sweden,

224
0:15:03.355,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and until then, she's being cared for in a beautiful orphanage in Athens.

225
0:15:10.221,000 --> 0:15:15,000
And Doaa? Well, word went around about her survival, too.

226
0:15:16.999,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And the media wrote about this slight woman,

227
0:15:20.736,000 --> 0:15:23,000
and couldn't imagine how she could survive all this time

228
0:15:24.672,000 --> 0:15:26,000
under such conditions in that sea,

229
0:15:27.69,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and still save another life.

230
0:15:32.459,000 --> 0:15:37,000
The Academy of Athens, one of Greece's most prestigious institutions,

231
0:15:37.87,000 --> 0:15:4,000
gave her an award of bravery,

232
0:15:41.25,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and she deserves all that praise,

233
0:15:44.265,000 --> 0:15:46,000
and she deserves a second chance.

234
0:15:47.999,000 --> 0:15:5,000
But she wants to still go to Sweden.

235
0:15:51.463,000 --> 0:15:53,000
She wants to reunite with her family there.

236
0:15:53.717,000 --> 0:15:57,000
She wants to bring her mother and her father and her younger siblings

237
0:15:57.852,000 --> 0:15:59,000
away from Egypt there as well,

238
0:16:00.194,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and I believe she will succeed.

239
0:16:03.399,000 --> 0:16:05,000
She wants to become a lawyer or a politician

240
0:16:06.145,000 --> 0:16:1,000
or something that can help fight injustice.

241
0:16:11.063,000 --> 0:16:14,000
She is an extraordinary survivor.

242
0:16:15.215,000 --> 0:16:17,000
But I have to ask:

243
0:16:17.803,000 --> 0:16:19,000
what if she didn't have to take that risk?

244
0:16:20.099,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Why did she have to go through all that?

245
0:16:23.226,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Why wasn't there a legal way for her to study in Europe?

246
0:16:28.314,000 --> 0:16:32,000
Why couldn't Masa have taken an airplane to Sweden?

247
0:16:32.634,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Why couldn't Bassem have found work?

248
0:16:36.125,000 --> 0:16:41,000
Why is there no massive resettlement program for Syrian refugees,

249
0:16:41.571,000 --> 0:16:44,000
the victims of the worst war of our times?

250
0:16:45.778,000 --> 0:16:5,000
The world did this for the Vietnamese in the 1970s. Why not now?

251
0:16:52.624,000 --> 0:16:56,000
Why is there so little investment in the neighboring countries

252
0:16:57.265,000 --> 0:16:59,000
hosting so many refugees?

253
0:17:01.113,000 --> 0:17:03,000
And why, the root question,

254
0:17:03.999,000 --> 0:17:09,000
is so little being done to stop the wars, the persecution

255
0:17:10.419,000 --> 0:17:14,000
and the poverty that is driving so many people

256
0:17:14.999,000 --> 0:17:15,000
to the shores of Europe?

257
0:17:17.999,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Until these issues are resolved,

258
0:17:20.632,000 --> 0:17:23,000
people will continue to take to the seas

259
0:17:23.991,000 --> 0:17:26,000
and to seek safety and asylum.

260
0:17:28.103,000 --> 0:17:29,000
And what happens next?

261
0:17:30.253,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Well, that is largely Europe's choice.

262
0:17:33.108,000 --> 0:17:36,000
And I understand the public fears.

263
0:17:37.005,000 --> 0:17:42,000
People are worried about their security, their economies, the changes of culture.

264
0:17:43.893,000 --> 0:17:47,000
But is that more important than saving human lives?

265
0:17:48.859,000 --> 0:17:5,000
Because there is something fundamental here

266
0:17:51.662,000 --> 0:17:53,000
that I think overrides the rest,

267
0:17:54.49,000 --> 0:17:57,000
and it is about our common humanity.

268
0:17:58.719,000 --> 0:18:02,000
No person fleeing war or persecution

269
0:18:03.212,000 --> 0:18:08,000
should have to die crossing a sea to reach safety.

270
0:18:08.397,000 --> 0:18:14,000
(Applause)

271
0:18:14.753,000 --> 0:18:15,000
One thing is for sure,

272
0:18:15.944,000 --> 0:18:18,000
that no refugee would be on those dangerous boats

273
0:18:19.151,000 --> 0:18:21,000
if they could thrive where they are.

274
0:18:21.523,000 --> 0:18:24,000
And no migrant would take that dangerous journey

275
0:18:24.825,000 --> 0:18:27,000
if they had enough food for themselves and their children.

276
0:18:28.735,000 --> 0:18:3,000
And no one would put their life savings

277
0:18:31.378,000 --> 0:18:33,000
in the hands of those notorious smugglers

278
0:18:34.195,000 --> 0:18:36,000
if there was a legal way to migrate.

279
0:18:37.471,000 --> 0:18:4,000
So on behalf of little Masa

280
0:18:41.09,000 --> 0:18:43,000
and on behalf of Doaa

281
0:18:43.383,000 --> 0:18:44,000
and of Bassem

282
0:18:45.131,000 --> 0:18:5,000
and of those 500 people who drowned with them,

283
0:18:50.292,000 --> 0:18:53,000
can we make sure that they did not die in vain?

284
0:18:54.308,000 --> 0:18:57,000
Could we be inspired by what happened,

285
0:18:57.999,000 --> 0:19:02,000
and take a stand for a world in which every life matters?

286
0:19:04.999,000 --> 0:19:05,000
Thank you.

287
0:19:06.334,000 --> 0:19:12,000
(Applause)

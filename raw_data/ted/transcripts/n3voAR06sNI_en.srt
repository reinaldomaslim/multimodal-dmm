1
0:00:03.319,000 --> 0:00:09,000
it has become a common see in Hong Kong

2
0:00:06.6,000 --> 0:00:11,000
to find people on the streets suddenly

3
0:00:09.87,000 --> 0:00:16,000
stopping in the tracks coming together

4
0:00:12.03,000 --> 0:00:2,000
to proudly sing a song this song glory

5
0:00:17.01,000 --> 0:00:23,000
to Hong Kong it's also deemed as the

6
0:00:20.789,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Hong Kong anthem has made its appearance

7
0:00:23.519,000 --> 0:00:3,000
in the most unconventional waits it is

8
0:00:27.24,000 --> 0:00:34,000
sung in protest in graduation ceremonies

9
0:00:30.63,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and even in shopping malls together by

10
0:00:34.739,000 --> 0:00:42,000
thousands of Hong Kong is written and

11
0:00:38.54,000 --> 0:00:46,000
released anonymously this very song

12
0:00:42.87,000 --> 0:00:5,000
embeds the spirit of our 2019 Hong Kong

13
0:00:47.01,000 --> 0:00:54,000
movement spontaneous creative

14
0:00:51.11,000 --> 0:00:57,000
translating passion into quick action

15
0:00:54.149,000 --> 0:01:,000
and in this largely anonymous and

16
0:00:58.109,000 --> 0:01:04,000
leaderless movement it is exactly this

17
0:01:00.75,000 --> 0:01:05,000
creativity that has sustained us even

18
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
differentiates us from other protests

19
0:01:06.42,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and as someone working in the creative

20
0:01:10.08,000 --> 0:01:19,000
fields I have been amazed by the way

21
0:01:15.9,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that we have renewed this embrace of the

22
0:01:19.38,000 --> 0:01:24,000
music and the arts whereas five years

23
0:01:22.38,000 --> 0:01:27,000
ago during the pro-democracy umbrella

24
0:01:24.479,000 --> 0:01:3,000
movement art was labelled as useless

25
0:01:27.53,000 --> 0:01:34,000
this time round we have seemingly found

26
0:01:31.2,000 --> 0:01:39,000
a new understanding of the role of the

27
0:01:34.549,000 --> 0:01:42,000
imagination through our own mistakes we

28
0:01:39.39,000 --> 0:01:46,000
have come to this realization the soft

29
0:01:42.84,000 --> 0:01:47,000
power of creativity is essential in this

30
0:01:46.53,000 --> 0:01:5,000
very difficult fight against

31
0:01:48.56,000 --> 0:01:52,000
authoritarian regimes as a

32
0:01:51.36,000 --> 0:01:57,000
singer-songwriter from Hong Kong I have

33
0:01:53.31,000 --> 0:01:59,000
since 2014 chosen to stand with my

34
0:01:57.42,000 --> 0:02:01,000
fellow Hong Kong s in our fight for

35
0:01:59.579,000 --> 0:02:01,000
democracy

36
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
it was the moment when I saw the first

37
0:02:08.54,000 --> 0:02:14,000
tear gas fired into the peaceful crowds

38
0:02:11.99,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that I decided regardless of all those

39
0:02:15.47,000 --> 0:02:21,000
so-called consequences that I had to

40
0:02:18.86,000 --> 0:02:24,000
speak my mind I stayed on the streets

41
0:02:22.34,000 --> 0:02:28,000
with the people for the 79 days of

42
0:02:25.28,000 --> 0:02:34,000
occupation and I was arrested in the end

43
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:38,000
in this era of self-censorship people in

44
0:02:35.06,000 --> 0:02:41,000
my industry thought I was insane

45
0:02:38.23,000 --> 0:02:45,000
they would ban you they were censor you

46
0:02:41.36,000 --> 0:02:5,000
this is career suicide well they were

47
0:02:46.01,000 --> 0:02:53,000
right fell only partially I was of

48
0:02:50.48,000 --> 0:02:56,000
course immediately banned in China my

49
0:02:53.9,000 --> 0:03:,000
name was censored all my songs were

50
0:02:56.48,000 --> 0:03:03,000
taken off shelves the authorities made

51
0:03:01.07,000 --> 0:03:07,000
sure that no brands whether in China or

52
0:03:04.37,000 --> 0:03:1,000
in Hong Kong would dare to work with me

53
0:03:07.209,000 --> 0:03:13,000
other celebrities stayed away even

54
0:03:10.97,000 --> 0:03:16,000
refused to take photos with me and fear

55
0:03:14.12,000 --> 0:03:21,000
of being associated with me and in

56
0:03:17.51,000 --> 0:03:21,000
recent days at a rally in Taiwan I was

57
0:03:21.17,000 --> 0:03:25,000
attacked

58
0:03:21.86,000 --> 0:03:3,000
splashed by red paint by a pro-beijing

59
0:03:25.25,000 --> 0:03:36,000
group but in my career end absolutely

60
0:03:31.61,000 --> 0:03:38,000
not in 2016 when brands avoided me and

61
0:03:36.59,000 --> 0:03:41,000
would not sponsor me for my concert I

62
0:03:39.44,000 --> 0:03:45,000
instead created a crowd sponsorship

63
0:03:42.35,000 --> 0:03:48,000
campaign I chopped up the sponsorship

64
0:03:46.13,000 --> 0:03:51,000
into smaller sums so it made it

65
0:03:48.61,000 --> 0:03:54,000
affordable for local companies in the

66
0:03:52.07,000 --> 0:03:57,000
end we gathered support from 300 local

67
0:03:55.31,000 --> 0:03:59,000
businesses amounting to more than 3

68
0:03:57.709,000 --> 0:04:01,000
million Hong Kong dollars which was

69
0:03:59.93,000 --> 0:04:05,000
actually way over what I would have

70
0:04:02.51,000 --> 0:04:11,000
expected with a corporate sponsorship I

71
0:04:06.22,000 --> 0:04:14,000
built my own record label and my own

72
0:04:12.23,000 --> 0:04:17,000
system with tools on the Internet

73
0:04:14.959,000 --> 0:04:19,000
with my very small team we improvise

74
0:04:17.69,000 --> 0:04:22,000
local tours in districts of Hong Kong

75
0:04:20.509,000 --> 0:04:25,000
since I could no longer tour in China we

76
0:04:23.12,000 --> 0:04:3,000
sang on trams in local shops on

77
0:04:26.199,000 --> 0:04:33,000
sidewalks even on mountains and we even

78
0:04:30.289,000 --> 0:04:37,000
self funded and organised a six-day

79
0:04:33.62,000 --> 0:04:39,000
music festival all this would not have

80
0:04:37.31,000 --> 0:04:44,000
been possible had I submitted to the

81
0:04:40.19,000 --> 0:04:48,000
notion of fear of this notion that there

82
0:04:44.72,000 --> 0:04:5,000
is only one way to do things all this

83
0:04:48.229,000 --> 0:04:53,000
would not have been possible had I not

84
0:04:50.81,000 --> 0:04:57,000
believed in the power of creativity as

85
0:04:54.22,000 --> 0:05:,000
of our present movement in Hong Kong it

86
0:04:58.07,000 --> 0:05:04,000
is also the level of innovation and

87
0:05:01.03,000 --> 0:05:07,000
flexibility that has wowed and surprised

88
0:05:04.13,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and inspired the world what started out

89
0:05:07.639,000 --> 0:05:12,000
as a million people protests morphed

90
0:05:11.12,000 --> 0:05:15,000
into something that no one not even

91
0:05:13.31,000 --> 0:05:18,000
ourselves thought was possible

92
0:05:15.58,000 --> 0:05:19,000
by rethinking the tools that they

93
0:05:18.47,000 --> 0:05:23,000
already had on hand

94
0:05:19.699,000 --> 0:05:26,000
the youngsters fully utilized phone apps

95
0:05:24.139,000 --> 0:05:3,000
online forums and even airdrop to

96
0:05:27.289,000 --> 0:05:34,000
consolidate and gather people they

97
0:05:30.979,000 --> 0:05:35,000
improvised new ways to counter the

98
0:05:34.55,000 --> 0:05:4,000
excessive amount of tear-gassing

99
0:05:36.8,000 --> 0:05:43,000
by using traffic cones steamed fish

100
0:05:41.419,000 --> 0:05:48,000
dishes thermos

101
0:05:44.11,000 --> 0:05:53,000
leaf blowers and even tennis rackets

102
0:05:49.13,000 --> 0:05:57,000
they built the most impressive and

103
0:05:53.74,000 --> 0:06:,000
artistic of road blocks and organized

104
0:05:57.949,000 --> 0:06:04,000
lunch protests in the financial district

105
0:06:01.58,000 --> 0:06:08,000
of central the lemon walks which went

106
0:06:05.36,000 --> 0:06:12,000
from posted memos into two-story high

107
0:06:09.02,000 --> 0:06:16,000
murrow's and the human chain with people

108
0:06:13.31,000 --> 0:06:2,000
holding hands covering all corners of

109
0:06:16.729,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Hong Kong even the iconic lion rock

110
0:06:20.449,000 --> 0:06:27,000
mountain and let's not forget all these

111
0:06:24.139,000 --> 0:06:29,000
beautiful illustrations and designs made

112
0:06:28.01,000 --> 0:06:33,000
anon

113
0:06:29.3,000 --> 0:06:36,000
which helped people express their

114
0:06:33.53,000 --> 0:06:38,000
thoughts in very critical moments all

115
0:06:36.439,000 --> 0:06:42,000
these innovative ways of turning

116
0:06:39.229,000 --> 0:06:46,000
emotions into art into humor into

117
0:06:43.009,000 --> 0:06:51,000
protest made detestable moments bearable

118
0:06:46.999,000 --> 0:06:53,000
for the people so by reconnecting with

119
0:06:51.289,000 --> 0:06:57,000
our flexibility we created a movement

120
0:06:54.919,000 --> 0:06:59,000
that brought out the best in Hong Kong's

121
0:06:57.46,000 --> 0:07:03,000
the bravery and the selflessness of

122
0:07:00.759,000 --> 0:07:07,000
those in face of police brutality

123
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
brought people together in new levels of

124
0:07:07.969,000 --> 0:07:15,000
solidarity and with that we overcame six

125
0:07:13.4,000 --> 0:07:21,000
months of challenges we overturned a

126
0:07:16.939,000 --> 0:07:23,000
district election with more than 85% of

127
0:07:21.589,000 --> 0:07:27,000
the seats the Hong Kong human rights and

128
0:07:24.8,000 --> 0:07:34,000
democracy Act was passed in US Congress

129
0:07:28.159,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and recently signed into law and our

130
0:07:35.599,000 --> 0:07:45,000
fight is so going strong creativity is

131
0:07:42.86,000 --> 0:07:48,000
what the tyrants cannot control nor

132
0:07:45.83,000 --> 0:07:52,000
repress with their very powerful but

133
0:07:49.789,000 --> 0:07:55,000
slow machine it takes time for them to

134
0:07:53.27,000 --> 0:07:58,000
react to new ideas whether it is the

135
0:07:56.779,000 --> 0:08:01,000
protests on the streets that is taking a

136
0:07:58.819,000 --> 0:08:04,000
new fluidity or the way that people

137
0:08:02.02,000 --> 0:08:09,000
reinvent themselves the system needs

138
0:08:05.449,000 --> 0:08:12,000
time to counter it and to find solutions

139
0:08:09.02,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and well when they do we would have

140
0:08:12.589,000 --> 0:08:19,000
already moved on to the next idea and

141
0:08:15.849,000 --> 0:08:23,000
let's face it being in a fight against

142
0:08:19.969,000 --> 0:08:25,000
tyrants can be extremely draining so by

143
0:08:23.87,000 --> 0:08:29,000
having diversity in our modes of protest

144
0:08:26.899,000 --> 0:08:33,000
by injecting creativity we reveal

145
0:08:30.62,000 --> 0:08:36,000
ourselves we become flexible and with

146
0:08:34.099,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that we are not only creating

147
0:08:36.919,000 --> 0:08:4,000
possibilities for ourselves but also

148
0:08:39.339,000 --> 0:08:43,000
opening up a new world

149
0:08:41.86,000 --> 0:08:48,000
those who thought it impossible

150
0:08:43.89,000 --> 0:08:49,000
therefore keeping the fight alive thank

151
0:08:49.63,000 --> 0:08:59,000
you

152
0:08:50.25,000 --> 0:09:09,000
[Applause]

153
0:08:59.74,000 --> 0:09:13,000
so thank you I would like to invite my

154
0:09:09.94,000 --> 0:09:29,000
very good brother Harris because we want

155
0:09:14.44,000 --> 0:09:34,000
to sing you a song in Cantonese so do we

156
0:09:30.04,000 --> 0:09:4,000
know any songs in Cantonese here this is

157
0:09:35.2,000 --> 0:09:47,000
a song that I wrote two years ago it was

158
0:09:40.8,000 --> 0:09:49,000
something of a imaginary future it is

159
0:09:47.56,000 --> 0:09:53,000
about people going onto a mountain

160
0:09:50.41,000 --> 0:09:56,000
trying to find that very first glimpse

161
0:09:53.95,000 --> 0:10:02,000
of light in the very dark polar nights

162
0:09:56.92,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and surprisingly it has become a reality

163
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and so this is for the freedom fighters

164
0:10:08.05,000 --> 0:10:17,000
in Hong Kong and all around the world

165
0:10:11.32,000 --> 0:10:38,000
[Applause]

166
0:10:17.74,000 --> 0:10:43,000

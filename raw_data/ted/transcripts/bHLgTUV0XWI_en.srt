1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
For a long time,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
there was me, and my body.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Me was composed of stories,

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
of cravings, of strivings,

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
of desires of the future.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Me was trying

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
not to be an outcome of my violent past,

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
but the separation that had already occurred

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
between me and my body

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
was a pretty significant outcome.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Me was always trying to become something, somebody.

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Me only existed in the trying.

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
My body was often in the way.

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Me was a floating head.

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
For years, I actually only wore hats.

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It was a way of keeping my head attached.

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
It was a way of locating myself.

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I worried that [if] I took my hat off

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I wouldn't be here anymore.

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I actually had a therapist who once said to me,

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
"Eve, you've been coming here for two years,

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and, to be honest, it never occurred to me that you had a body."

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
All this time I lived in the city

24
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
because, to be honest,

25
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I was afraid of trees.

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I never had babies

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
because heads cannot give birth.

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Babies actually don't come out of your mouth.

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
As I had no reference point for my body,

30
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I began to ask other women about their bodies --

31
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
in particular, their vaginas,

32
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
because I thought vaginas were kind of important.

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
This led to me writing "The Vagina Monologues,"

34
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
which led to me obsessively and incessantly

35
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
talking about vaginas everywhere I could.

36
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I did this in front of many strangers.

37
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
One night on stage,

38
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I actually entered my vagina.

39
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
It was an ecstatic experience.

40
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
It scared me, it energized me,

41
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and then I became a driven person,

42
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
a driven vagina.

43
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I began to see my body like a thing,

44
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
a thing that could move fast,

45
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
like a thing that could accomplish other things,

46
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
many things, all at once.

47
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I began to see my body like an iPad or a car.

48
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I would drive it and demand things from it.

49
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
It had no limits. It was invincible.

50
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
It was to be conquered and mastered like the Earth herself.

51
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I didn't heed it;

52
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
no, I organized it and I directed it.

53
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I didn't have patience for my body;

54
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I snapped it into shape.

55
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I was greedy.

56
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I took more than my body had to offer.

57
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
If I was tired, I drank more espressos.

58
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
If I was afraid, I went to more dangerous places.

59
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Oh sure, sure, I had moments of appreciation of my body,

60
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
the way an abusive parent

61
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
can sometimes have a moment of kindness.

62
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
My father was really kind to me

63
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
on my 16th birthday, for example.

64
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I heard people murmur from time to time

65
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
that I should love my body,

66
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
so I learned how to do this.

67
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
I was a vegetarian, I was sober, I didn't smoke.

68
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
But all that was just a more sophisticated way

69
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
to manipulate my body --

70
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
a further disassociation,

71
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
like planting a vegetable field on a freeway.

72
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
As a result of me talking so much about my vagina,

73
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
many women started to tell me about theirs --

74
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
their stories about their bodies.

75
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Actually, these stories compelled me around the world,

76
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and I've been to over 60 countries.

77
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I heard thousands of stories,

78
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and I have to tell you, there was always this moment

79
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
where the women shared with me

80
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
that particular moment when she separated from her body --

81
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
when she left home.

82
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I heard about women being molested in their beds,

83
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
flogged in their burqas,

84
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
left for dead in parking lots,

85
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
acid burned in their kitchens.

86
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Some women became quiet and disappeared.

87
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Other women became mad, driven machines like me.

88
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
In the middle of my traveling,

89
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I turned 40 and I began to hate my body,

90
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
which was actually progress,

91
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
because at least my body existed enough to hate it.

92
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Well my stomach -- it was my stomach I hated.

93
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
It was proof that I had not measured up,

94
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that I was old and not fabulous and not perfect

95
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
or able to fit into the predetermined corporate image in shape.

96
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
My stomach was proof that I had failed,

97
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that it had failed me, that it was broken.

98
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
My life became about getting rid of it and obsessing about getting rid of it.

99
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
In fact, it became so extreme

100
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I wrote a play about it.

101
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
But the more I talked about it,

102
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
the more objectified and fragmented my body became.

103
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
It became entertainment; it became a new kind of commodity,

104
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
something I was selling.

105
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Then I went somewhere else.

106
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I went outside

107
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
what I thought I knew.

108
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I went to the Democratic Republic of Congo.

109
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And I heard stories

110
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that shattered all the other stories.

111
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I heard stories

112
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that got inside my body.

113
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I heard about a little girl

114
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
who couldn't stop peeing on herself

115
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
because so many grown soldiers

116
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
had shoved themselves inside her.

117
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I heard an 80-year-old woman

118
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
whose legs were broken and pulled out of her sockets

119
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and twisted up on her head

120
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
as the soldiers raped her like that.

121
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
There are thousands of these stories,

122
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and many of the women had holes in their bodies --

123
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
holes, fistula --

124
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
that were the violation of war --

125
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
holes in the fabric of their souls.

126
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
These stories saturated my cells and nerves,

127
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and to be honest,

128
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I stopped sleeping for three years.

129
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
All the stories began to bleed together.

130
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
The raping of the Earth,

131
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
the pillaging of minerals,

132
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
the destruction of vaginas --

133
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
none of these were separate anymore

134
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
from each other or me.

135
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Militias were raping six-month-old babies

136
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
so that countries far away

137
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
could get access to gold and coltan

138
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
for their iPhones and computers.

139
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
My body had not only become a driven machine,

140
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
but it was responsible now

141
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
for destroying other women's bodies

142
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
in its mad quest to make more machines

143
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
to support the speed and efficiency of my machine.

144
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Then I got cancer --

145
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
or I found out I had cancer.

146
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
It arrived like a speeding bird

147
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
smashing into a windowpane.

148
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Suddenly, I had a body,

149
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
a body that was pricked

150
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and poked and punctured,

151
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
a body that was cut wide open,

152
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
a body that had organs removed

153
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and transported and rearranged and reconstructed,

154
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
a body that was scanned

155
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and had tubes shoved down it,

156
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
a body that was burning from chemicals.

157
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Cancer exploded

158
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
the wall of my disconnection.

159
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I suddenly understood that the crisis in my body

160
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
was the crisis in the world,

161
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and it wasn't happening later,

162
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
it was happening now.

163
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Suddenly, my cancer was a cancer that was everywhere,

164
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
the cancer of cruelty, the cancer of greed,

165
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
the cancer that gets inside people

166
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
who live down the streets from chemical plants -- and they're usually poor --

167
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
the cancer inside the coal miner's lungs,

168
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
the cancer of stress for not achieving enough,

169
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
the cancer of buried trauma,

170
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
the cancer in caged chickens and polluted fish,

171
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
the cancer in women's uteruses from being raped,

172
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
the cancer that is everywhere from our carelessness.

173
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
In his new and visionary book,

174
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
"New Self, New World,"

175
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
the writer Philip Shepherd says,

176
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
"If you are divided from your body,

177
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
you are also divided from the body of the world,

178
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
which then appears to be other than you

179
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
or separate from you,

180
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
rather than the living continuum

181
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
to which you belong."

182
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Before cancer,

183
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
the world was something other.

184
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
It was as if I was living in a stagnant pool

185
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and cancer dynamited the boulder

186
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
that was separating me from the larger sea.

187
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
Now I am swimming in it.

188
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Now I lay down in the grass

189
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and I rub my body in it,

190
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and I love the mud on my legs and feet.

191
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Now I make a daily pilgrimage

192
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
to visit a particular weeping willow by the Seine,

193
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and I hunger for the green fields

194
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
in the bush outside Bukavu.

195
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And when it rains hard rain,

196
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I scream and I run in circles.

197
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
I know that everything is connected,

198
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and the scar that runs the length of my torso

199
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
is the markings of the earthquake.

200
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And I am there with the three million in the streets of Port-au-Prince.

201
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And the fire that burned in me

202
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
on day three through six of chemo

203
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
is the fire that is burning

204
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
in the forests of the world.

205
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I know that the abscess

206
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
that grew around my wound after the operation,

207
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
the 16 ounces of puss,

208
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
is the contaminated Gulf of Mexico,

209
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and there were oil-drenched pelicans inside me

210
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and dead floating fish.

211
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And the catheters they shoved into me without proper medication

212
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
made me scream out

213
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
the way the Earth cries out from the drilling.

214
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
In my second chemo,

215
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
my mother got very sick

216
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and I went to see her.

217
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And in the name of connectedness,

218
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
the only thing she wanted before she died

219
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
was to be brought home

220
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
by her beloved Gulf of Mexico.

221
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
So we brought her home,

222
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and I prayed that the oil wouldn't wash up on her beach

223
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
before she died.

224
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And gratefully, it didn't.

225
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And she died quietly in her favorite place.

226
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And a few weeks later, I was in New Orleans,

227
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and this beautiful, spiritual friend

228
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
told me she wanted to do a healing for me.

229
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And I was honored.

230
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And I went to her house, and it was morning,

231
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and the morning New Orleans sun was filtering through the curtains.

232
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And my friend was preparing this big bowl,

233
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and I said, "What is it?"

234
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And she said, "It's for you.

235
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
The flowers make it beautiful,

236
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and the honey makes it sweet."

237
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And I said, "But what's the water part?"

238
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And in the name of connectedness,

239
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
she said, "Oh, it's the Gulf of Mexico."

240
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And I said, "Of course it is."

241
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And the other women arrived and they sat in a circle,

242
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and Michaela bathed my head with the sacred water.

243
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And she sang -- I mean her whole body sang.

244
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And the other women sang

245
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and they prayed for me and my mother.

246
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And as the warm Gulf washed over my naked head,

247
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
I realized that it held

248
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
the best and the worst of us.

249
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
It was the greed and recklessness

250
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
that led to the drilling explosion.

251
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
It was all the lies that got told

252
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
before and after.

253
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
It was the honey in the water that made it sweet,

254
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
it was the oil that made it sick.

255
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
It was my head that was bald --

256
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and comfortable now without a hat.

257
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
It was my whole self

258
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
melting into Michaela's lap.

259
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
It was the tears that were indistinguishable from the Gulf

260
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
that were falling down my cheek.

261
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
It was finally being in my body.

262
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
It was the sorrow

263
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
that's taken so long.

264
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
It was finding my place

265
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and the huge responsibility

266
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
that comes with connection.

267
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
It was the continuing devastating war in the Congo

268
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and the indifference of the world.

269
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
It was the Congolese women

270
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
who are now rising up.

271
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
It was my mother leaving,

272
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
just at the moment

273
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
that I was being born.

274
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
It was the realization

275
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that I had come very close to dying --

276
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
in the same way that the Earth, our mother,

277
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
is barely holding on,

278
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
in the same way that 75 percent of the planet

279
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
are hardly scraping by,

280
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
in the same way

281
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
that there is a recipe for survival.

282
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
What I learned

283
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
is it has to do with attention and resources

284
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
that everybody deserves.

285
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
It was advocating friends

286
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and a doting sister.

287
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
It was wise doctors and advanced medicine

288
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and surgeons who knew what to do with their hands.

289
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
It was underpaid and really loving nurses.

290
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
It was magic healers and aromatic oils.

291
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
It was people who came with spells and rituals.

292
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
It was having a vision of the future

293
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and something to fight for,

294
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
because I know this struggle isn't my own.

295
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
It was a million prayers.

296
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
It was a thousand hallelujahs

297
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and a million oms.

298
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
It was a lot of anger,

299
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
insane humor,

300
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
a lot of attention, outrage.

301
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
It was energy, love and joy.

302
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
It was all these things.

303
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
It was all these things.

304
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
It was all these things

305
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
in the water, in the world, in my body.

306
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
(Applause)

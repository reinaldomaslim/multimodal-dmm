2
0:00:12.562,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm going to talk about the strategizing brain.

3
0:00:14.815,000 --> 0:00:16,000
We're going to use an unusual combination of tools

4
0:00:17.053,000 --> 0:00:19,000
from game theory and neuroscience

5
0:00:19.066,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to understand how people interact socially when value is on the line.

6
0:00:22.033,000 --> 0:00:25,000
So game theory is a branch of, originally, applied mathematics,

7
0:00:26.004,000 --> 0:00:28,000
used mostly in economics and political science, a little bit in biology,

8
0:00:28.99,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that gives us a mathematical taxonomy of social life

9
0:00:32.279,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and it predicts what people are likely to do

10
0:00:34.41,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and believe others will do

11
0:00:35.604,000 --> 0:00:38,000
in cases where everyone's actions affect everyone else.

12
0:00:38.994,000 --> 0:00:41,000
That's a lot of things: competition, cooperation, bargaining,

13
0:00:42.472,000 --> 0:00:45,000
games like hide-and-seek, and poker.

14
0:00:45.763,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Here's a simple game to get us started.

15
0:00:48.002,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Everyone chooses a number from zero to 100,

16
0:00:50.164,000 --> 0:00:52,000
we're going to compute the average of those numbers,

17
0:00:52.61,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and whoever's closest to two-thirds of the average wins a fixed prize.

18
0:00:56.804,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So you want to be a little bit below the average number,

19
0:00:59.073,000 --> 0:01:01,000
but not too far below, and everyone else wants to be

20
0:01:01.309,000 --> 0:01:02,000
a little bit below the average number as well.

21
0:01:03.254,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Think about what you might pick.

22
0:01:05.833,000 --> 0:01:08,000
As you're thinking, this is a toy model of something like

23
0:01:09.104,000 --> 0:01:11,000
selling in the stock market during a rising market. Right?

24
0:01:11.916,000 --> 0:01:13,000
You don't want to sell too early, because you miss out on profits,

25
0:01:14.141,000 --> 0:01:16,000
but you don't want to wait too late

26
0:01:16.321,000 --> 0:01:18,000
to when everyone else sells, triggering a crash.

27
0:01:18.722,000 --> 0:01:2,000
You want to be a little bit ahead of the competition, but not too far ahead.

28
0:01:21.601,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Okay, here's two theories about how people might think about this,

29
0:01:25.214,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and then we'll see some data.

30
0:01:26.61,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Some of these will sound familiar because you probably are

31
0:01:28.801,000 --> 0:01:31,000
thinking that way. I'm using my brain theory to see.

32
0:01:32.6,000 --> 0:01:35,000
A lot of people say, "I really don't know what people are going to pick,

33
0:01:35.71,000 --> 0:01:36,000
so I think the average will be 50."

34
0:01:37.383,000 --> 0:01:38,000
They're not being really strategic at all.

35
0:01:39.294,000 --> 0:01:42,000
"And I'll pick two-thirds of 50. That's 33." That's a start.

36
0:01:42.646,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Other people who are a little more sophisticated,

37
0:01:44.538,000 --> 0:01:45,000
using more working memory,

38
0:01:46.014,000 --> 0:01:49,000
say, "I think people will pick 33 because they're going to pick a response to 50,

39
0:01:49.918,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and so I'll pick 22, which is two-thirds of 33."

40
0:01:52.886,000 --> 0:01:54,000
They're doing one extra step of thinking, two steps.

41
0:01:55.365,000 --> 0:01:57,000
That's better. And of course, in principle,

42
0:01:57.982,000 --> 0:01:58,000
you could do three, four or more,

43
0:01:59.809,000 --> 0:02:,000
but it starts to get very difficult.

44
0:02:01.678,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Just like in language and other domains, we know that it's hard for people to parse

45
0:02:04.27,000 --> 0:02:07,000
very complex sentences with a kind of recursive structure.

46
0:02:07.904,000 --> 0:02:08,000
This is called a cognitive hierarchy theory, by the way.

47
0:02:09.638,000 --> 0:02:11,000
It's something that I've worked on and a few other people,

48
0:02:12.194,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and it indicates a kind of hierarchy along with

49
0:02:14.414,000 --> 0:02:16,000
some assumptions about how many people stop at different steps

50
0:02:16.668,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and how the steps of thinking are affected

51
0:02:18.552,000 --> 0:02:21,000
by lots of interesting variables and variant people, as we'll see in a minute.

52
0:02:22.248,000 --> 0:02:25,000
A very different theory, a much more popular one, and an older one,

53
0:02:25.634,000 --> 0:02:28,000
due largely to John Nash of "A Beautiful Mind" fame,

54
0:02:29.174,000 --> 0:02:31,000
is what's called equilibrium analysis.

55
0:02:31.414,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So if you've ever taken a game theory course at any level,

56
0:02:33.868,000 --> 0:02:34,000
you will have learned a little bit about this.

57
0:02:35.581,000 --> 0:02:37,000
An equilibrium is a mathematical state in which everybody

58
0:02:38.436,000 --> 0:02:4,000
has figured out exactly what everyone else will do.

59
0:02:40.885,000 --> 0:02:42,000
It is a very useful concept, but behaviorally,

60
0:02:42.892,000 --> 0:02:44,000
it may not exactly explain what people do

61
0:02:44.895,000 --> 0:02:46,000
the first time they play these types of economic games

62
0:02:47.63,000 --> 0:02:49,000
or in situations in the outside world.

63
0:02:49.963,000 --> 0:02:51,000
In this case, the equilibrium makes a very bold prediction,

64
0:02:52.301,000 --> 0:02:54,000
which is everyone wants to be below everyone else,

65
0:02:55.161,000 --> 0:02:57,000
therefore they'll play zero.

66
0:02:57.452,000 --> 0:03:,000
Let's see what happens. This experiment's been done many, many times.

67
0:03:00.461,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Some of the earliest ones were done in the '90s

68
0:03:02.344,000 --> 0:03:04,000
by me and Rosemarie Nagel and others.

69
0:03:04.989,000 --> 0:03:06,000
This is a beautiful data set of 9,000 people who wrote in

70
0:03:07.974,000 --> 0:03:09,000
to three newspapers and magazines that had a contest.

71
0:03:10.854,000 --> 0:03:11,000
The contest said, send in your numbers

72
0:03:12.668,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and whoever is close to two-thirds of the average will win a big prize.

73
0:03:15.823,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And as you can see, there's so much data here, you can see the spikes very visibly.

74
0:03:18.911,000 --> 0:03:21,000
There's a spike at 33. Those are people doing one step.

75
0:03:22.292,000 --> 0:03:24,000
There is another spike visible at 22.

76
0:03:24.789,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And notice, by the way, that most people pick numbers right around there.

77
0:03:27.081,000 --> 0:03:29,000
They don't necessarily pick exactly 33 and 22.

78
0:03:29.591,000 --> 0:03:31,000
There's something a little bit noisy around it.

79
0:03:31.647,000 --> 0:03:32,000
But you can see those spikes, and they're there.

80
0:03:33.125,000 --> 0:03:34,000
There's another group of people who seem to have

81
0:03:34.835,000 --> 0:03:36,000
a firm grip on equilibrium analysis,

82
0:03:36.91,000 --> 0:03:38,000
because they're picking zero or one.

83
0:03:39.305,000 --> 0:03:41,000
But they lose, right?

84
0:03:41.394,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Because picking a number that low is actually a bad choice

85
0:03:44.586,000 --> 0:03:46,000
if other people aren't doing equilibrium analysis as well.

86
0:03:47.406,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So they're smart, but poor.

87
0:03:49.518,000 --> 0:03:51,000
(Laughter)

88
0:03:51.606,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Where are these things happening in the brain?

89
0:03:53.575,000 --> 0:03:56,000
One study by Coricelli and Nagel gives a really sharp, interesting answer.

90
0:03:57.45,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So they had people play this game

91
0:03:58.958,000 --> 0:04:,000
while they were being scanned in an fMRI,

92
0:04:01.175,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and two conditions: in some trials,

93
0:04:03.446,000 --> 0:04:04,000
they're told you're playing another person

94
0:04:04.961,000 --> 0:04:05,000
who's playing right now and we're going to match up

95
0:04:06.549,000 --> 0:04:08,000
your behavior at the end and pay you if you win.

96
0:04:08.753,000 --> 0:04:09,000
In the other trials, they're told, you're playing a computer.

97
0:04:10.731,000 --> 0:04:11,000
They're just choosing randomly.

98
0:04:12.365,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So what you see here is a subtraction

99
0:04:14.442,000 --> 0:04:16,000
of areas in which there's more brain activity

100
0:04:17.192,000 --> 0:04:19,000
when you're playing people compared to playing the computer.

101
0:04:20.168,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And you see activity in some regions we've seen today,

102
0:04:22.159,000 --> 0:04:25,000
medial prefrontal cortex, dorsomedial, however, up here,

103
0:04:25.396,000 --> 0:04:26,000
ventromedial prefrontal cortex,

104
0:04:27.247,000 --> 0:04:28,000
anterior cingulate, an area that's involved

105
0:04:28.601,000 --> 0:04:31,000
in lots of types of conflict resolution, like if you're playing "Simon Says,"

106
0:04:32.238,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and also the right and left temporoparietal junction.

107
0:04:36.052,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And these are all areas which are fairly reliably known

108
0:04:38.518,000 --> 0:04:4,000
to be part of what's called a "theory of mind" circuit,

109
0:04:40.839,000 --> 0:04:41,000
or "mentalizing circuit."

110
0:04:42.74,000 --> 0:04:45,000
That is, it's a circuit that's used to imagine what other people might do.

111
0:04:46.118,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So these were some of the first studies to see this

112
0:04:48.358,000 --> 0:04:5,000
tied in to game theory.

113
0:04:50.391,000 --> 0:04:52,000
What happens with these one- and two-step types?

114
0:04:52.631,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So we classify people by what they picked,

115
0:04:54.702,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and then we look at the difference between

116
0:04:56.369,000 --> 0:04:57,000
playing humans versus playing computers,

117
0:04:58.344,000 --> 0:04:59,000
which brain areas are differentially active.

118
0:05:00.235,000 --> 0:05:01,000
On the top you see the one-step players.

119
0:05:01.987,000 --> 0:05:02,000
There's almost no difference.

120
0:05:03.507,000 --> 0:05:05,000
The reason is, they're treating other people like a computer, and the brain is too.

121
0:05:06.447,000 --> 0:05:1,000
The bottom players, you see all the activity in dorsomedial PFC.

122
0:05:10.588,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So we know that those two-step players are doing something differently.

123
0:05:12.639,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Now if you were to step back and say, "What can we do with this information?"

124
0:05:15.735,000 --> 0:05:16,000
you might be able to look at brain activity and say,

125
0:05:17.556,000 --> 0:05:18,000
"This person's going to be a good poker player,"

126
0:05:19.055,000 --> 0:05:2,000
or, "This person's socially naive,"

127
0:05:20.984,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and we might also be able to study things

128
0:05:22.262,000 --> 0:05:23,000
like development of adolescent brains

129
0:05:23.86,000 --> 0:05:26,000
once we have an idea of where this circuitry exists.

130
0:05:27.214,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Okay. Get ready.

131
0:05:29.826,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I'm saving you some brain activity,

132
0:05:31.949,000 --> 0:05:33,000
because you don't need to use your hair detector cells.

133
0:05:34.759,000 --> 0:05:36,000
You should use those cells to think carefully about this game.

134
0:05:37.647,000 --> 0:05:38,000
This is a bargaining game.

135
0:05:39.582,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Two players who are being scanned using EEG electrodes

136
0:05:42.138,000 --> 0:05:44,000
are going to bargain over one to six dollars.

137
0:05:45.015,000 --> 0:05:47,000
If they can do it in 10 seconds, they're going to actually earn that money.

138
0:05:47.679,000 --> 0:05:5,000
If 10 seconds goes by and they haven't made a deal, they get nothing.

139
0:05:50.719,000 --> 0:05:51,000
That's kind of a mistake together.

140
0:05:52.402,000 --> 0:05:54,000
The twist is that one player, on the left,

141
0:05:55.219,000 --> 0:05:57,000
is informed about how much on each trial there is.

142
0:05:57.907,000 --> 0:05:59,000
They play lots of trials with different amounts each time.

143
0:06:00.139,000 --> 0:06:02,000
In this case, they know there's four dollars.

144
0:06:02.38,000 --> 0:06:03,000
The uninformed player doesn't know,

145
0:06:04.257,000 --> 0:06:06,000
but they know that the informed player knows.

146
0:06:06.311,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So the uninformed player's challenge is to say,

147
0:06:08.37,000 --> 0:06:09,000
"Is this guy really being fair

148
0:06:09.84,000 --> 0:06:1,000
or are they giving me a very low offer

149
0:06:11.694,000 --> 0:06:14,000
in order to get me to think that there's only one or two dollars available to split?"

150
0:06:14.772,000 --> 0:06:17,000
in which case they might reject it and not come to a deal.

151
0:06:17.926,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So there's some tension here between trying to get the most money

152
0:06:20.876,000 --> 0:06:22,000
but trying to goad the other player into giving you more.

153
0:06:23.449,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And the way they bargain is to point on a number line

154
0:06:25.779,000 --> 0:06:26,000
that goes from zero to six dollars,

155
0:06:27.585,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and they're bargaining over how much the uninformed player gets,

156
0:06:30.563,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and the informed player's going to get the rest.

157
0:06:32.148,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So this is like a management-labor negotiation

158
0:06:34.723,000 --> 0:06:36,000
in which the workers don't know how much profits

159
0:06:37.456,000 --> 0:06:39,000
the privately held company has, right,

160
0:06:40.123,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and they want to maybe hold out for more money,

161
0:06:42.491,000 --> 0:06:43,000
but the company might want to create the impression

162
0:06:44.327,000 --> 0:06:46,000
that there's very little to split: "I'm giving you the most that I can."

163
0:06:47.259,000 --> 0:06:51,000
First some behavior. So a bunch of the subject pairs, they play face to face.

164
0:06:51.49,000 --> 0:06:52,000
We have some other data where they play across computers.

165
0:06:53.326,000 --> 0:06:54,000
That's an interesting difference, as you might imagine.

166
0:06:55.064,000 --> 0:06:57,000
But a bunch of the face-to-face pairs

167
0:06:57.266,000 --> 0:07:,000
agree to divide the money evenly every single time.

168
0:07:00.959,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Boring. It's just not interesting neurally.

169
0:07:03.865,000 --> 0:07:05,000
It's good for them. They make a lot of money.

170
0:07:06.379,000 --> 0:07:08,000
But we're interested in, can we say something about

171
0:07:09.051,000 --> 0:07:11,000
when disagreements occur versus don't occur?

172
0:07:11.587,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So this is the other group of subjects who often disagree.

173
0:07:13.944,000 --> 0:07:15,000
So they have a chance of -- they bicker and disagree

174
0:07:16.712,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and end up with less money.

175
0:07:18.019,000 --> 0:07:21,000
They might be eligible to be on "Real Housewives," the TV show.

176
0:07:21.936,000 --> 0:07:22,000
You see on the left,

177
0:07:23.872,000 --> 0:07:25,000
when the amount to divide is one, two or three dollars,

178
0:07:26.536,000 --> 0:07:27,000
they disagree about half the time,

179
0:07:28.184,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and when the amount is four, five, six, they agree quite often.

180
0:07:30.376,000 --> 0:07:31,000
This turns out to be something that's predicted

181
0:07:32.25,000 --> 0:07:34,000
by a very complicated type of game theory

182
0:07:34.454,000 --> 0:07:36,000
you should come to graduate school at CalTech and learn about.

183
0:07:37.263,000 --> 0:07:39,000
It's a little too complicated to explain right now,

184
0:07:39.435,000 --> 0:07:42,000
but the theory tells you that this shape kind of should occur.

185
0:07:42.851,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Your intuition might tell you that too.

186
0:07:45.067,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Now I'm going to show you the results from the EEG recording.

187
0:07:47.307,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Very complicated. The right brain schematic

188
0:07:49.66,000 --> 0:07:51,000
is the uninformed person, and the left is the informed.

189
0:07:52.523,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Remember that we scanned both brains at the same time,

190
0:07:55.323,000 --> 0:07:57,000
so we can ask about time-synced activity

191
0:07:57.715,000 --> 0:08:,000
in similar or different areas simultaneously,

192
0:08:00.939,000 --> 0:08:02,000
just like if you wanted to study a conversation

193
0:08:03.203,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and you were scanning two people talking to each other

194
0:08:05.139,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and you'd expect common activity in language regions

195
0:08:07.499,000 --> 0:08:09,000
when they're actually kind of listening and communicating.

196
0:08:09.884,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So the arrows connect regions that are active at the same time,

197
0:08:13.811,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and the direction of the arrows flows

198
0:08:15.851,000 --> 0:08:17,000
from the region that's active first in time,

199
0:08:18.331,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and the arrowhead goes to the region that's active later.

200
0:08:21.899,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So in this case, if you look carefully,

201
0:08:24.115,000 --> 0:08:25,000
most of the arrows flow from right to left.

202
0:08:25.972,000 --> 0:08:28,000
That is, it looks as if the uninformed brain activity

203
0:08:29.252,000 --> 0:08:3,000
is happening first,

204
0:08:31.211,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and then it's followed by activity in the informed brain.

205
0:08:34.726,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And by the way, these were trials where their deals were made.

206
0:08:38.418,000 --> 0:08:39,000
This is from the first two seconds.

207
0:08:40.198,000 --> 0:08:41,000
We haven't finished analyzing this data,

208
0:08:42.178,000 --> 0:08:43,000
so we're still peeking in, but the hope is

209
0:08:44.078,000 --> 0:08:46,000
that we can say something in the first couple of seconds

210
0:08:46.642,000 --> 0:08:47,000
about whether they'll make a deal or not,

211
0:08:48.365,000 --> 0:08:5,000
which could be very useful in thinking about avoiding litigation

212
0:08:50.408,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and ugly divorces and things like that.

213
0:08:52.336,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Those are all cases in which a lot of value is lost

214
0:08:55.219,000 --> 0:08:57,000
by delay and strikes.

215
0:08:58.195,000 --> 0:09:,000
Here's the case where the disagreements occur.

216
0:09:00.225,000 --> 0:09:02,000
You can see it looks different than the one before.

217
0:09:02.398,000 --> 0:09:04,000
There's a lot more arrows.

218
0:09:04.647,000 --> 0:09:05,000
That means that the brains are synced up

219
0:09:06.158,000 --> 0:09:08,000
more closely in terms of simultaneous activity,

220
0:09:08.71,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and the arrows flow clearly from left to right.

221
0:09:10.72,000 --> 0:09:12,000
That is, the informed brain seems to be deciding,

222
0:09:12.962,000 --> 0:09:14,000
"We're probably not going to make a deal here."

223
0:09:15.25,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And then later there's activity in the uninformed brain.

224
0:09:18.475,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Next I'm going to introduce you to some relatives.

225
0:09:20.978,000 --> 0:09:22,000
They're hairy, smelly, fast and strong.

226
0:09:23.239,000 --> 0:09:26,000
You might be thinking back to your last Thanksgiving.

227
0:09:26.429,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Maybe if you had a chimpanzee with you.

228
0:09:29.122,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Charles Darwin and I and you broke off from the family tree

229
0:09:32.583,000 --> 0:09:34,000
from chimpanzees about five million years ago.

230
0:09:34.842,000 --> 0:09:35,000
They're still our closest genetic kin.

231
0:09:36.81,000 --> 0:09:37,000
We share 98.8 percent of the genes.

232
0:09:38.547,000 --> 0:09:4,000
We share more genes with them than zebras do with horses.

233
0:09:41.347,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And we're also their closest cousin.

234
0:09:43.064,000 --> 0:09:46,000
They have more genetic relation to us than to gorillas.

235
0:09:46.066,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So how humans and chimpanzees behave differently

236
0:09:48.594,000 --> 0:09:5,000
might tell us a lot about brain evolution.

237
0:09:51.049,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So this is an amazing memory test

238
0:09:53.65,000 --> 0:09:55,000
from Nagoya, Japan, Primate Research Institute,

239
0:09:56.466,000 --> 0:09:57,000
where they've done a lot of this research.

240
0:09:58.244,000 --> 0:10:,000
This goes back quite a ways. They're interested in working memory.

241
0:10:00.584,000 --> 0:10:01,000
The chimp is going to see, watch carefully,

242
0:10:02.356,000 --> 0:10:04,000
they're going to see 200 milliseconds' exposure

243
0:10:04.558,000 --> 0:10:05,000
— that's fast, that's eight movie frames —

244
0:10:06.552,000 --> 0:10:07,000
of numbers one, two, three, four, five.

245
0:10:08.503,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Then they disappear and they're replaced by squares,

246
0:10:10.501,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and they have to press the squares

247
0:10:12.256,000 --> 0:10:14,000
that correspond to the numbers from low to high

248
0:10:14.577,000 --> 0:10:15,000
to get an apple reward.

249
0:10:15.916,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Let's see how they can do it.

250
0:10:28.391,000 --> 0:10:29,000
This is a young chimp. The young ones

251
0:10:29.884,000 --> 0:10:31,000
are better than the old ones, just like humans.

252
0:10:32.667,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And they're highly experienced, so they've done this

253
0:10:34.259,000 --> 0:10:35,000
thousands and thousands of time.

254
0:10:35.691,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Obviously there's a big training effect, as you can imagine.

255
0:10:39.928,000 --> 0:10:4,000
(Laughter)

256
0:10:41.272,000 --> 0:10:42,000
You can see they're very blasé and kind of effortless.

257
0:10:43.207,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Not only can they do it very well, they do it in a sort of lazy way.

258
0:10:47.135,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Right? Who thinks you could beat the chimps?

259
0:10:50.57,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Wrong. (Laughter)

260
0:10:52.166,000 --> 0:10:54,000
We can try. We'll try. Maybe we'll try.

261
0:10:54.604,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Okay, so the next part of this study

262
0:10:57.194,000 --> 0:10:58,000
I'm going to go quickly through

263
0:10:58.79,000 --> 0:11:,000
is based on an idea of Tetsuro Matsuzawa.

264
0:11:01.482,000 --> 0:11:04,000
He had a bold idea that -- what he called the cognitive trade-off hypothesis.

265
0:11:04.511,000 --> 0:11:05,000
We know chimps are faster and stronger.

266
0:11:05.803,000 --> 0:11:06,000
They're also very obsessed with status.

267
0:11:07.483,000 --> 0:11:09,000
His thought was, maybe they've preserved brain activities

268
0:11:10.439,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and they practice them in development

269
0:11:12.607,000 --> 0:11:13,000
that are really, really important to them

270
0:11:14.458,000 --> 0:11:16,000
to negotiate status and to win,

271
0:11:16.668,000 --> 0:11:18,000
which is something like strategic thinking during competition.

272
0:11:19.666,000 --> 0:11:2,000
So we're going to check that out

273
0:11:21.246,000 --> 0:11:23,000
by having the chimps actually play a game

274
0:11:23.676,000 --> 0:11:25,000
by touching two touch screens.

275
0:11:26.314,000 --> 0:11:28,000
The chimps are actually interacting with each other through the computers.

276
0:11:28.754,000 --> 0:11:29,000
They're going to press left or right.

277
0:11:30.362,000 --> 0:11:32,000
One chimp is called a matcher.

278
0:11:32.475,000 --> 0:11:33,000
They win if they press left, left,

279
0:11:34.458,000 --> 0:11:37,000
like a seeker finding someone in hide-and-seek, or right, right.

280
0:11:37.627,000 --> 0:11:38,000
The mismatcher wants to mismatch.

281
0:11:38.855,000 --> 0:11:41,000
They want to press the opposite screen of the chimp.

282
0:11:41.931,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And the rewards are apple cube rewards.

283
0:11:44.475,000 --> 0:11:46,000
So here's how game theorists look at these data.

284
0:11:47.003,000 --> 0:11:48,000
This is a graph of the percentage of times

285
0:11:48.617,000 --> 0:11:5,000
the matcher picked right on the x-axis,

286
0:11:51.235,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and the percentage of times they predicted right

287
0:11:52.751,000 --> 0:11:54,000
by the mismatcher on the y-axis.

288
0:11:55.619,000 --> 0:11:58,000
So a point here is the behavior by a pair of players,

289
0:11:58.819,000 --> 0:12:,000
one trying to match, one trying to mismatch.

290
0:12:01.035,000 --> 0:12:04,000
The NE square in the middle -- actually NE, CH and QRE --

291
0:12:04.315,000 --> 0:12:06,000
those are three different theories of Nash equilibrium, and others,

292
0:12:06.771,000 --> 0:12:08,000
tells you what the theory predicts,

293
0:12:09.195,000 --> 0:12:11,000
which is that they should match 50-50,

294
0:12:11.467,000 --> 0:12:13,000
because if you play left too much, for example,

295
0:12:13.635,000 --> 0:12:15,000
I can exploit that if I'm the mismatcher by then playing right.

296
0:12:16.351,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And as you can see, the chimps, each chimp is one triangle,

297
0:12:19.115,000 --> 0:12:22,000
are circled around, hovering around that prediction.

298
0:12:22.962,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Now we move the payoffs.

299
0:12:24.736,000 --> 0:12:27,000
We're actually going to make the left, left payoff for the matcher a little bit higher.

300
0:12:28.179,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Now they get three apple cubes.

301
0:12:29.699,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Game theoretically, that should actually make the mismatcher's behavior shift,

302
0:12:32.499,000 --> 0:12:33,000
because what happens is, the mismatcher will think,

303
0:12:34.089,000 --> 0:12:35,000
oh, this guy's going to go for the big reward,

304
0:12:35.899,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and so I'm going to go to the right, make sure he doesn't get it.

305
0:12:38.964,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And as you can see, their behavior moves up

306
0:12:40.629,000 --> 0:12:43,000
in the direction of this change in the Nash equilibrium.

307
0:12:44.077,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Finally, we changed the payoffs one more time.

308
0:12:46.391,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Now it's four apple cubes,

309
0:12:47.583,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and their behavior again moves towards the Nash equilibrium.

310
0:12:49.755,000 --> 0:12:51,000
It's sprinkled around, but if you average the chimps out,

311
0:12:51.79,000 --> 0:12:53,000
they're really, really close, within .01.

312
0:12:53.98,000 --> 0:12:56,000
They're actually closer than any species we've observed.

313
0:12:57.179,000 --> 0:13:,000
What about humans? You think you're smarter than a chimpanzee?

314
0:13:00.372,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Here's two human groups in green and blue.

315
0:13:03.939,000 --> 0:13:06,000
They're closer to 50-50. They're not responding to payoffs as closely,

316
0:13:07.683,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and also if you study their learning in the game,

317
0:13:09.133,000 --> 0:13:1,000
they aren't as sensitive to previous rewards.

318
0:13:11.118,000 --> 0:13:12,000
The chimps are playing better than the humans,

319
0:13:12.482,000 --> 0:13:14,000
better in the sense of adhering to game theory.

320
0:13:14.905,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And these are two different groups of humans

321
0:13:16.324,000 --> 0:13:19,000
from Japan and Africa. They replicate quite nicely.

322
0:13:19.52,000 --> 0:13:22,000
None of them are close to where the chimps are.

323
0:13:22.755,000 --> 0:13:23,000
So here are some things we learned today.

324
0:13:24.51,000 --> 0:13:25,000
People seem to do a limited amount of strategic thinking

325
0:13:26.448,000 --> 0:13:27,000
using theory of mind.

326
0:13:28.259,000 --> 0:13:29,000
We have some preliminary evidence from bargaining

327
0:13:30.176,000 --> 0:13:32,000
that early warning signs in the brain might be used to predict

328
0:13:32.668,000 --> 0:13:34,000
whether there will be a bad disagreement that costs money,

329
0:13:34.894,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and chimps are better competitors than humans,

330
0:13:36.734,000 --> 0:13:38,000
as judged by game theory.

331
0:13:39.198,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Thank you.

332
0:13:41.055,000 --> 0:13:44,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.015,000 --> 0:00:15,000
You may never have heard of Kenema, Sierra Leone

2
0:00:15.801,000 --> 0:00:16,000
or Arua, Nigeria.

3
0:00:17.357,000 --> 0:00:2,000
But I know them as two of the most extraordinary places on earth.

4
0:00:21.956,000 --> 0:00:26,000
In hospitals there, there's a community of nurses, physicians and scientists

5
0:00:27.033,000 --> 0:00:28,000
that have been quietly battling

6
0:00:28.614,000 --> 0:00:3,000
one of the deadliest threats to humanity for years:

7
0:00:31.338,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Lassa virus.

8
0:00:33.118,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Lassa virus is a lot like Ebola.

9
0:00:35.28,000 --> 0:00:38,000
It can cause a severe fever and can often be fatal.

10
0:00:39.053,000 --> 0:00:42,000
But these individuals, they risk their lives every day

11
0:00:43.016,000 --> 0:00:45,000
to protect the individuals in their communities,

12
0:00:45.957,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and by doing so, protect us all.

13
0:00:49.093,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But one of the most extraordinary things I learned about them

14
0:00:52.025,000 --> 0:00:54,000
on one of my first visits out there many years ago

15
0:00:54.616,000 --> 0:00:55,000
was that they start each morning --

16
0:00:56.349,000 --> 0:01:,000
these challenging, extraordinary days on the front lines -- by singing.

17
0:01:01.731,000 --> 0:01:04,000
They gather together, and they show their joy.

18
0:01:05.094,000 --> 0:01:06,000
They show their spirit.

19
0:01:06.64,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And over the years,

20
0:01:07.823,000 --> 0:01:1,000
from year after year as I've visited them and they've visited me,

21
0:01:10.96,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I get to gather with them and I sing

22
0:01:12.977,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and we write and we love it,

23
0:01:15.175,000 --> 0:01:18,000
because it reminds us that we're not just there to pursue science together;

24
0:01:18.742,000 --> 0:01:2,000
we're bonded through a shared humanity.

25
0:01:21.586,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And that of course, as you can imagine, becomes extremely important,

26
0:01:25.933,000 --> 0:01:27,000
even essential, as things begin to change.

27
0:01:28.73,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And that changed a great deal in March of 2014,

28
0:01:33.543,000 --> 0:01:35,000
when the Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea.

29
0:01:36.426,000 --> 0:01:38,000
This is the first outbreak in West Africa,

30
0:01:38.582,000 --> 0:01:4,000
near the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia.

31
0:01:42.074,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And it was frightening, frightening for us all.

32
0:01:44.62,000 --> 0:01:45,000
We had actually suspected for some time

33
0:01:46.556,000 --> 0:01:48,000
that Lassa and Ebola were more widespread than thought,

34
0:01:49.222,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and we thought it could one day come to Kenema.

35
0:01:51.896,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And so members of my team immediately went out

36
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and joined Dr. Humarr Khan and his team there,

37
0:01:56.751,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and we set up diagnostics to be able to have sensitive molecular tests

38
0:02:00.452,000 --> 0:02:02,000
to pick up Ebola if it came across the border

39
0:02:02.629,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and into Sierra Leone.

40
0:02:03.916,000 --> 0:02:05,000
We'd already set up this kind of capacity for Lassa virus,

41
0:02:06.936,000 --> 0:02:07,000
we knew how to do it,

42
0:02:08.117,000 --> 0:02:09,000
the team is outstanding.

43
0:02:09.571,000 --> 0:02:12,000
We just had to give them the tools and place to survey for Ebola.

44
0:02:13.34,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And unfortunately, that day came.

45
0:02:14.992,000 --> 0:02:18,000
On May 23, 2014, a woman checked into the maternity ward at the hospital,

46
0:02:19.997,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and the team ran those important molecular tests

47
0:02:23.747,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and they identified the first confirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.

48
0:02:28.107,000 --> 0:02:3,000
This was an exceptional work that was done.

49
0:02:30.18,000 --> 0:02:32,000
They were able to diagnose the case immediately,

50
0:02:32.464,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to safely treat the patient

51
0:02:34.801,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and to begin to do contact tracing to follow what was going on.

52
0:02:37.843,000 --> 0:02:38,000
It could've stopped something.

53
0:02:39.839,000 --> 0:02:41,000
But by the time that day came,

54
0:02:42.71,000 --> 0:02:44,000
the outbreak had already been breeding for months.

55
0:02:45.092,000 --> 0:02:48,000
With hundreds of cases, it had already eclipsed all previous outbreaks.

56
0:02:48.756,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And it came into Sierra Leone not as that singular case,

57
0:02:52.424,000 --> 0:02:53,000
but as a tidal wave.

58
0:02:54.12,000 --> 0:02:56,000
We had to work with the international community,

59
0:02:56.419,000 --> 0:02:59,000
with the Ministry of Health, with Kenema, to begin to deal with the cases,

60
0:03:00.149,000 --> 0:03:02,000
as the next week brought 31,

61
0:03:02.244,000 --> 0:03:05,000
then 92, then 147 cases -- all coming to Kenema,

62
0:03:05.942,000 --> 0:03:08,000
one of the only places in Sierra Leone that could deal with this.

63
0:03:09.61,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And we worked around the clock trying to do everything we could,

64
0:03:13.033,000 --> 0:03:15,000
trying to help the individuals, trying to get attention,

65
0:03:16.018,000 --> 0:03:17,000
but we also did one other simple thing.

66
0:03:18.544,000 --> 0:03:21,000
From that specimen that we take from a patient's blood to detect Ebola,

67
0:03:22.357,000 --> 0:03:24,000
we can discard it, obviously.

68
0:03:24.436,000 --> 0:03:27,000
The other thing we can do is, actually, put in a chemical and deactivate it,

69
0:03:28.076,000 --> 0:03:3,000
so just place it into a box and ship it across the ocean,

70
0:03:30.83,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and that's what we did.

71
0:03:32.005,000 --> 0:03:34,000
We sent it to Boston, where my team works.

72
0:03:34.724,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And we also worked around the clock doing shift work, day after day,

73
0:03:38.585,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and we quickly generated 99 genomes of the Ebola virus.

74
0:03:42.478,000 --> 0:03:45,000
This is the blueprint -- the genome of a virus is the blueprint.

75
0:03:45.559,000 --> 0:03:46,000
We all have one.

76
0:03:46.742,000 --> 0:03:47,000
It says everything that makes up us,

77
0:03:48.711,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and it tells us so much information.

78
0:03:50.644,000 --> 0:03:53,000
The results of this kind of work are simple and they're powerful.

79
0:03:54.396,000 --> 0:03:56,000
We could actually take these 99 different viruses,

80
0:03:56.89,000 --> 0:03:57,000
look at them and compare them,

81
0:03:58.361,000 --> 0:04:,000
and we could see, actually, compared to three genomes

82
0:04:01.231,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that had been previously published from Guinea,

83
0:04:04.091,000 --> 0:04:07,000
we could show that the outbreak emerged in Guinea months before,

84
0:04:07.826,000 --> 0:04:08,000
once into the human population,

85
0:04:09.692,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and from there had been transmitting from human to human.

86
0:04:12.388,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Now, that's incredibly important

87
0:04:13.956,000 --> 0:04:15,000
when you're trying to figure out how to intervene,

88
0:04:16.348,000 --> 0:04:18,000
but the important thing is contact tracing.

89
0:04:18.438,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We also could see that as the virus was moving between humans,

90
0:04:21.864,000 --> 0:04:22,000
it was mutating.

91
0:04:23.145,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And each of those mutations are so important,

92
0:04:25.32,000 --> 0:04:27,000
because the diagnostics, the vaccines,

93
0:04:27.664,000 --> 0:04:28,000
the therapies that we're using,

94
0:04:29.173,000 --> 0:04:32,000
are all based on that genome sequence, fundamentally --

95
0:04:32.555,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that's what drives it.

96
0:04:33.8,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And so global health experts would need to respond,

97
0:04:36.706,000 --> 0:04:37,000
would have to develop,

98
0:04:37.927,000 --> 0:04:39,000
to recalibrate everything that they were doing.

99
0:04:41.079,000 --> 0:04:44,000
But the way that science works, the position I was in at that point

100
0:04:44.284,000 --> 0:04:45,000
is, I had the data,

101
0:04:45.459,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and I could have worked in a silo for many, many months,

102
0:04:48.119,000 --> 0:04:5,000
analyzed the data carefully, slowly,

103
0:04:50.342,000 --> 0:04:53,000
submitted the paper for publication, gone through a few back-and-forths,

104
0:04:53.826,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and then finally when the paper came out, might release that data.

105
0:04:56.979,000 --> 0:04:58,000
That's the way the status quo works.

106
0:04:59.207,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Well, that was not going to work at this point, right?

107
0:05:01.802,000 --> 0:05:02,000
We had friends on the front lines

108
0:05:03.434,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and to us it was just obvious that what we needed is help,

109
0:05:06.712,000 --> 0:05:07,000
lots of help.

110
0:05:07.892,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So the first thing we did is,

111
0:05:09.313,000 --> 0:05:11,000
as soon as the sequences came off the machines,

112
0:05:12.022,000 --> 0:05:13,000
we published it to the web.

113
0:05:13.475,000 --> 0:05:15,000
We just released it to the whole world and said, "Help us."

114
0:05:16.335,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And help came.

115
0:05:17.694,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Before we knew it,

116
0:05:18.88,000 --> 0:05:2,000
we were being contacted from people all over,

117
0:05:21.24,000 --> 0:05:23,000
surprised to see the data out there and released.

118
0:05:23.708,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Some of the greatest viral trackers in the world

119
0:05:25.984,000 --> 0:05:27,000
were suddenly part of our community.

120
0:05:28.087,000 --> 0:05:3,000
We were working together in this virtual way,

121
0:05:30.441,000 --> 0:05:32,000
sharing, regular calls, communications,

122
0:05:33.446,000 --> 0:05:35,000
trying to follow the virus minute by minute,

123
0:05:36.221,000 --> 0:05:38,000
to see ways that we could stop it.

124
0:05:39.027,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And there are so many ways that we can form communities like that.

125
0:05:43.182,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Everybody, particularly when the outbreak started to expand globally,

126
0:05:47.531,000 --> 0:05:5,000
was reaching out to learn, to participate, to engage.

127
0:05:51.788,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Everybody wants to play a part.

128
0:05:53.406,000 --> 0:05:55,000
The amount of human capacity out there is just amazing,

129
0:05:56.21,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and the Internet connects us all.

130
0:05:57.957,000 --> 0:06:,000
And could you imagine that instead of being frightened of each other,

131
0:06:01.232,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that we all just said, "Let's do this.

132
0:06:03.113,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Let's work together, and let's make this happen."

133
0:06:05.66,000 --> 0:06:07,000
But the problem is that the data that all of us are using,

134
0:06:08.426,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Googling on the web, is just too limited to do what we need to do.

135
0:06:12.487,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And so many opportunities get missed when that happens.

136
0:06:15.162,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So in the early part of the epidemic from Kenema,

137
0:06:17.667,000 --> 0:06:19,000
we'd had 106 clinical records from patients,

138
0:06:20.433,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and we once again made that publicly available to the world.

139
0:06:23.291,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And in our own lab, we could show that you could take those 106 records,

140
0:06:26.985,000 --> 0:06:29,000
we could train computers to predict the prognosis for Ebola patients

141
0:06:30.627,000 --> 0:06:31,000
to near 100 percent accuracy.

142
0:06:32.428,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And we made an app that could release that,

143
0:06:34.549,000 --> 0:06:36,000
to make that available to health-care workers in the field.

144
0:06:37.343,000 --> 0:06:4,000
But 106 is just not enough to make it powerful,

145
0:06:40.626,000 --> 0:06:41,000
to validate it.

146
0:06:41.801,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So we were waiting for more data to release that.

147
0:06:44.479,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and the data has still not come.

148
0:06:46.547,000 --> 0:06:48,000
We are still waiting, tweaking away,

149
0:06:49.103,000 --> 0:06:51,000
in silos rather than working together.

150
0:06:51.965,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And this just -- we can't accept that.

151
0:06:54.221,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Right? You, all of you, cannot accept that.

152
0:06:58.049,000 --> 0:06:59,000
It's our lives on the line.

153
0:06:59.755,000 --> 0:07:,000
And in fact, actually,

154
0:07:01.49,000 --> 0:07:03,000
many lives were lost, many health-care workers,

155
0:07:04.057,000 --> 0:07:05,000
including beloved colleagues of mine,

156
0:07:05.975,000 --> 0:07:08,000
five colleagues: Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi,

157
0:07:09.746,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Dr. Humarr Khan, Alice Kovoma and Mohamed Fullah.

158
0:07:13.781,000 --> 0:07:15,000
These are just five of many health-care workers

159
0:07:16.331,000 --> 0:07:17,000
at Kenema and beyond

160
0:07:18.119,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that died while the world waited and while we all worked,

161
0:07:21.179,000 --> 0:07:22,000
quietly and separately.

162
0:07:23.063,000 --> 0:07:25,000
See, Ebola, like all threats to humanity,

163
0:07:25.12,000 --> 0:07:28,000
it's fueled by mistrust and distraction and division.

164
0:07:29.028,000 --> 0:07:32,000
When we build barriers amongst ourselves and we fight amongst ourselves,

165
0:07:32.825,000 --> 0:07:33,000
the virus thrives.

166
0:07:34.669,000 --> 0:07:35,000
But unlike all threats to humanity,

167
0:07:36.485,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Ebola is one where we're actually all the same.

168
0:07:39.155,000 --> 0:07:4,000
We're all in this fight together.

169
0:07:41.059,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Ebola on one person's doorstep could soon be on ours.

170
0:07:44.177,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And so in this place with the same vulnerabilities,

171
0:07:47.003,000 --> 0:07:49,000
the same strengths, the same fears, the same hopes,

172
0:07:49.44,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I hope that we work together with joy.

173
0:07:54.427,000 --> 0:07:57,000
A graduate student of mine was reading a book about Sierra Leone,

174
0:07:57.521,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and she discovered that the word "Kenema,"

175
0:07:59.879,000 --> 0:08:02,000
the hospital that we work at and the city where we work in Sierra Leone,

176
0:08:03.346,000 --> 0:08:07,000
is named after the Mende word for "clear like a river, translucent

177
0:08:07.551,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and open to the public gaze."

178
0:08:09.439,000 --> 0:08:1,000
That was really profound for us,

179
0:08:11.008,000 --> 0:08:13,000
because without knowing it, we'd always felt

180
0:08:13.126,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that in order to honor the individuals in Kenema where we worked,

181
0:08:16.334,000 --> 0:08:2,000
we had to work openly, we had to share and we had to work together.

182
0:08:21.074,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And we have to do that.

183
0:08:22.275,000 --> 0:08:25,000
We all have to demand that of ourselves and others --

184
0:08:26.06,000 --> 0:08:28,000
to be open to each other when an outbreak happens,

185
0:08:28.958,000 --> 0:08:29,000
to fight in this fight together.

186
0:08:30.632,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Because this is not the first outbreak of Ebola,

187
0:08:33.565,000 --> 0:08:34,000
it will not be the last,

188
0:08:35.037,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and there are many other microbes out there that are lying in wait,

189
0:08:38.216,000 --> 0:08:39,000
like Lassa virus and others.

190
0:08:39.665,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And the next time this happens,

191
0:08:41.198,000 --> 0:08:44,000
it could happen in a city of millions, it could start there.

192
0:08:44.418,000 --> 0:08:46,000
It could be something that's transmitted through the air.

193
0:08:47.141,000 --> 0:08:49,000
It could even be disseminated intentionally.

194
0:08:49.312,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And I know that that is frightening, I understand that,

195
0:08:52.317,000 --> 0:08:54,000
but I know also, and this experience shows us,

196
0:08:54.995,000 --> 0:08:57,000
that we have the technology and we have the capacity

197
0:08:58.339,000 --> 0:08:59,000
to win this thing,

198
0:08:59.958,000 --> 0:09:01,000
to win this and have the upper hand over viruses.

199
0:09:02.828,000 --> 0:09:04,000
But we can only do it if we do it together

200
0:09:05.124,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and we do it with joy.

201
0:09:06.871,000 --> 0:09:07,000
So for Dr. Khan

202
0:09:08.416,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and for all of those who sacrificed their lives on the front lines

203
0:09:12.606,000 --> 0:09:14,000
in this fight with us always,

204
0:09:15.03,000 --> 0:09:17,000
let us be in this fight with them always.

205
0:09:17.861,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And let us not let the world be defined

206
0:09:19.76,000 --> 0:09:21,000
by the destruction wrought by one virus,

207
0:09:21.903,000 --> 0:09:23,000
but illuminated by billions of hearts and minds

208
0:09:24.708,000 --> 0:09:25,000
working in unity.

209
0:09:25.94,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Thank you.

210
0:09:27.138,000 --> 0:09:33,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.835,000 --> 0:00:14,000
This story starts with these two --

2
0:00:15.852,000 --> 0:00:16,000
my kids.

3
0:00:17.134,000 --> 0:00:18,000
We were hiking in the Oakland woods

4
0:00:18.84,000 --> 0:00:22,000
when my daughter noticed a plastic tub of cat litter in a creek.

5
0:00:23.467,000 --> 0:00:24,000
She looked at me and said,

6
0:00:25.153,000 --> 0:00:27,000
"Daddy?

7
0:00:27.684,000 --> 0:00:28,000
That doesn't go there."

8
0:00:29.358,000 --> 0:00:31,000
When she said that, it reminded me of summer camp.

9
0:00:31.804,000 --> 0:00:32,000
On the morning of visiting day,

10
0:00:33.326,000 --> 0:00:36,000
right before they'd let our anxious parents come barreling through the gates,

11
0:00:37.013,000 --> 0:00:38,000
our camp director would say,

12
0:00:38.406,000 --> 0:00:4,000
"Quick! Everyone pick up five pieces of litter."

13
0:00:40.739,000 --> 0:00:43,000
You get a couple hundred kids each picking up five pieces,

14
0:00:43.803,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and pretty soon, you've got a much cleaner camp.

15
0:00:46.4,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So I thought,

16
0:00:47.583,000 --> 0:00:51,000
why not apply that crowdsourced cleanup model to the entire planet?

17
0:00:52.144,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And that was the inspiration for Litterati.

18
0:00:55.119,000 --> 0:00:58,000
The vision is to create a litter-free world.

19
0:00:58.492,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Let me show you how it started.

20
0:01:00.024,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I took a picture of a cigarette using Instagram.

21
0:01:04.042,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Then I took another photo ...

22
0:01:05.933,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and another photo ...

23
0:01:07.514,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and another photo.

24
0:01:08.705,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And I noticed two things:

25
0:01:10.015,000 --> 0:01:13,000
one, litter became artistic and approachable;

26
0:01:14.064,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and two,

27
0:01:15.239,000 --> 0:01:17,000
at the end of a few days, I had 50 photos on my phone

28
0:01:17.778,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and I had picked up each piece,

29
0:01:19.389,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and I realized that I was keeping a record

30
0:01:21.798,000 --> 0:01:24,000
of the positive impact I was having on the planet.

31
0:01:24.973,000 --> 0:01:26,000
That's 50 less things that you might see,

32
0:01:27.185,000 --> 0:01:28,000
or you might step on,

33
0:01:28.452,000 --> 0:01:29,000
or some bird might eat.

34
0:01:30.589,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So I started telling people what I was doing,

35
0:01:33.265,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and they started participating.

36
0:01:36.651,000 --> 0:01:37,000
One day,

37
0:01:38.368,000 --> 0:01:4,000
this photo showed up from China.

38
0:01:41.859,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And that's when I realized

39
0:01:43.154,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that Litterati was more than just pretty pictures;

40
0:01:46.444,000 --> 0:01:49,000
we were becoming a community that was collecting data.

41
0:01:50.689,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Each photo tells a story.

42
0:01:53.099,000 --> 0:01:55,000
It tells us who picked up what,

43
0:01:55.316,000 --> 0:01:57,000
a geotag tells us where

44
0:01:57.351,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and a time stamp tells us when.

45
0:01:59.826,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So I built a Google map,

46
0:02:02.279,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and started plotting the points where pieces were being picked up.

47
0:02:06.356,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And through that process, the community grew

48
0:02:10.298,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and the data grew.

49
0:02:12.626,000 --> 0:02:15,000
My two kids go to school right in that bullseye.

50
0:02:16.945,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Litter:

51
0:02:18.18,000 --> 0:02:2,000
it's blending into the background of our lives.

52
0:02:20.908,000 --> 0:02:22,000
But what if we brought it to the forefront?

53
0:02:23.031,000 --> 0:02:25,000
What if we understood exactly what was on our streets,

54
0:02:25.967,000 --> 0:02:26,000
our sidewalks

55
0:02:27.38,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and our school yards?

56
0:02:28.942,000 --> 0:02:31,000
How might we use that data to make a difference?

57
0:02:33.009,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Well, let me show you.

58
0:02:34.231,000 --> 0:02:35,000
The first is with cities.

59
0:02:36.238,000 --> 0:02:4,000
San Francisco wanted to understand what percentage of litter was cigarettes.

60
0:02:40.901,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Why?

61
0:02:42.087,000 --> 0:02:43,000
To create a tax.

62
0:02:43.893,000 --> 0:02:45,000
So they put a couple of people in the streets

63
0:02:46.052,000 --> 0:02:47,000
with pencils and clipboards,

64
0:02:47.437,000 --> 0:02:49,000
who walked around collecting information

65
0:02:49.524,000 --> 0:02:52,000
which led to a 20-cent tax on all cigarette sales.

66
0:02:53.607,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And then they got sued

67
0:02:55.784,000 --> 0:02:56,000
by big tobacco,

68
0:02:56.984,000 --> 0:02:59,000
who claimed that collecting information with pencils and clipboards

69
0:03:00.224,000 --> 0:03:02,000
is neither precise nor provable.

70
0:03:03.274,000 --> 0:03:06,000
The city called me and asked if our technology could help.

71
0:03:06.978,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I'm not sure they realized

72
0:03:08.251,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that our technology was my Instagram account --

73
0:03:10.523,000 --> 0:03:11,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:11.586,000 --> 0:03:12,000
But I said, "Yes, we can."

75
0:03:12.876,000 --> 0:03:13,000
(Laughter)

76
0:03:13.916,000 --> 0:03:16,000
"And we can tell you if that's a Parliament or a Pall Mall.

77
0:03:17.848,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Plus, every photograph is geotagged and time-stamped,

78
0:03:21.297,000 --> 0:03:22,000
providing you with proof."

79
0:03:23.659,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Four days and 5,000 pieces later,

80
0:03:26.903,000 --> 0:03:3,000
our data was used in court to not only defend but double the tax,

81
0:03:31.865,000 --> 0:03:35,000
generating an annual recurring revenue of four million dollars

82
0:03:36.212,000 --> 0:03:38,000
for San Francisco to clean itself up.

83
0:03:39.821,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Now, during that process I learned two things:

84
0:03:42.08,000 --> 0:03:44,000
one, Instagram is not the right tool --

85
0:03:44.658,000 --> 0:03:45,000
(Laughter)

86
0:03:45.713,000 --> 0:03:46,000
so we built an app.

87
0:03:47.24,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And two, if you think about it,

88
0:03:48.897,000 --> 0:03:51,000
every city in the world has a unique litter fingerprint,

89
0:03:52.538,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and that fingerprint provides both the source of the problem

90
0:03:56.398,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and the path to the solution.

91
0:03:59.466,000 --> 0:04:01,000
If you could generate a revenue stream

92
0:04:01.868,000 --> 0:04:03,000
just by understanding the percentage of cigarettes,

93
0:04:04.355,000 --> 0:04:06,000
well, what about coffee cups

94
0:04:06.475,000 --> 0:04:07,000
or soda cans

95
0:04:08.205,000 --> 0:04:09,000
or plastic bottles?

96
0:04:10.321,000 --> 0:04:13,000
If you could fingerprint San Francisco, well, how about Oakland

97
0:04:13.546,000 --> 0:04:14,000
or Amsterdam

98
0:04:15.266,000 --> 0:04:17,000
or somewhere much closer to home?

99
0:04:19.228,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And what about brands?

100
0:04:20.486,000 --> 0:04:21,000
How might they use this data

101
0:04:22.411,000 --> 0:04:26,000
to align their environmental and economic interests?

102
0:04:27.466,000 --> 0:04:3,000
There's a block in downtown Oakland that's covered in blight.

103
0:04:31.145,000 --> 0:04:35,000
The Litterati community got together and picked up 1,500 pieces.

104
0:04:35.632,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And here's what we learned:

105
0:04:36.996,000 --> 0:04:39,000
most of that litter came from a very well-known taco brand.

106
0:04:41.558,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Most of that brand's litter were their own hot sauce packets,

107
0:04:46.258,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and most of those hot sauce packets hadn't even been opened.

108
0:04:51.785,000 --> 0:04:53,000
The problem and the path to the solution --

109
0:04:54.524,000 --> 0:04:57,000
well, maybe that brand only gives out hot sauce upon request

110
0:04:58.509,000 --> 0:05:,000
or installs bulk dispensers

111
0:05:00.542,000 --> 0:05:02,000
or comes up with more sustainable packaging.

112
0:05:03.118,000 --> 0:05:05,000
How does a brand take an environmental hazard,

113
0:05:06.111,000 --> 0:05:08,000
turn it into an economic engine

114
0:05:08.141,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and become an industry hero?

115
0:05:11.112,000 --> 0:05:13,000
If you really want to create change,

116
0:05:13.338,000 --> 0:05:15,000
there's no better place to start than with our kids.

117
0:05:16.236,000 --> 0:05:19,000
A group of fifth graders picked up 1,247 pieces of litter

118
0:05:19.663,000 --> 0:05:2,000
just on their school yard.

119
0:05:21.535,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And they learned that the most common type of litter

120
0:05:24.091,000 --> 0:05:27,000
were the plastic straw wrappers from their own cafeteria.

121
0:05:27.767,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So these kids went to their principal and asked,

122
0:05:30.32,000 --> 0:05:31,000
"Why are we still buying straws?"

123
0:05:32.986,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And they stopped.

124
0:05:34.765,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And they learned that individually they could each make a difference,

125
0:05:38.443,000 --> 0:05:4,000
but together they created an impact.

126
0:05:41.323,000 --> 0:05:45,000
It doesn't matter if you're a student or a scientist,

127
0:05:45.359,000 --> 0:05:48,000
whether you live in Honolulu or Hanoi,

128
0:05:48.518,000 --> 0:05:5,000
this is a community for everyone.

129
0:05:51.794,000 --> 0:05:55,000
It started because of two little kids in the Northern California woods,

130
0:05:56.497,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and today it's spread across the world.

131
0:05:59.758,000 --> 0:06:,000
And you know how we're getting there?

132
0:06:01.887,000 --> 0:06:02,000
One piece at a time.

133
0:06:04.328,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Thank you.

134
0:06:05.567,000 --> 0:06:08,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.728,000 --> 0:00:19,000
As a magician, I try to create images that make people stop and think.

2
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I also try to challenge myself

3
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
to do things that doctors say are not possible.

4
0:00:27.862,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I was buried alive in New York City in a coffin,

5
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
buried alive in a coffin in April, 1999, for a week.

6
0:00:37.883,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I lived there with nothing but water.

7
0:00:41.422,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And it ended up being so much fun

8
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that I decided I could pursue doing more of these things.

9
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
The next one is I froze myself in a block of ice

10
0:00:51.716,000 --> 0:00:53,000
for three days and three nights in New York City.

11
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
That one was way more difficult than I had expected.

12
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
The one after that, I stood on top of a hundred-foot pillar

13
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
for 36 hours.

14
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I began to hallucinate so hard

15
0:01:06.783,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that the buildings that were behind me started to look like big animal heads.

16
0:01:11.462,000 --> 0:01:12,000
So, next I went to London.

17
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
In London I lived in a glass box for 44 days

18
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
with nothing but water.

19
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
It was, for me, one of the most difficult things I'd ever done,

20
0:01:22.284,000 --> 0:01:25,000
but it was also the most beautiful.

21
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
There was so many skeptics, especially the press in London,

22
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that they started flying cheeseburgers on helicopters around my box to tempt me.

23
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:36.315,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So, I felt very validated

25
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
when the New England Journal of Medicine actually used the research for science.

26
0:01:45.68,000 --> 0:01:48,000
My next pursuit was I wanted to see how long I could go without breathing,

27
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
like how long I could survive with nothing, not even air.

28
0:01:53.65,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I didn't realize that it would become the most amazing journey of my life.

29
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
As a young magician,

30
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I was obsessed with Houdini and his underwater challenges.

31
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So, I began, early on, competing against the other kids,

32
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
seeing how long I could stay underwater while they went up and down to breathe,

33
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
you know, five times, while I stayed under on one breath.

34
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
By the time I was a teenager,

35
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I was able to hold my breath for three minutes and 30 seconds.

36
0:02:21.968,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I would later find out that was Houdini's personal record.

37
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
In 1987 I heard of a story

38
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
about a boy that fell through ice and was trapped under a river.

39
0:02:36.09,000 --> 0:02:41,000
He was underneath, not breathing for 45 minutes.

40
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
When the rescue workers came,

41
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
they resuscitated him and there was no brain damage.

42
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
His core temperature had dropped to 77 degrees.

43
0:02:51.486,000 --> 0:02:53,000
As a magician, I think everything is possible.

44
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And I think if something is done by one person,

45
0:02:56.475,000 --> 0:02:58,000
it can be done by others.

46
0:02:58.988,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I started to think,

47
0:03:00.394,000 --> 0:03:03,000
if the boy could survive without breathing for that long,

48
0:03:04.126,000 --> 0:03:05,000
there must be a way that I could do it.

49
0:03:06.85,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So, I met with a top neurosurgeon.

50
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And I asked him, how long is it possible to go without breathing,

51
0:03:12.498,000 --> 0:03:14,000
like how long could I go without air?

52
0:03:14.902,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And he said to me that anything over six minutes

53
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
you have a serious risk of hypoxic brain damage.

54
0:03:23.319,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So, I took that as a challenge, basically.

55
0:03:26.134,000 --> 0:03:27,000
(Laughter)

56
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
My first try, I figured that I could do something similar,

57
0:03:33.855,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and I created a water tank,

58
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and I filled it with ice and freezing cold water.

59
0:03:39.828,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And I stayed inside of that water tank

60
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
hoping my core temperature would start to drop.

61
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And I was shivering.

62
0:03:46.687,000 --> 0:03:49,000
In my first attempt to hold my breath, I couldn't even last a minute.

63
0:03:50.204,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So, I realized that was completely not going to work.

64
0:03:53.983,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I went to talk to a doctor friend --

65
0:03:58.919,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and I asked him, "How could I do that?"

66
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
"I want to hold my breath for a really long time. How could it be done?"

67
0:04:06.713,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And he said, "David, you're a magician,

68
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
create the illusion of not breathing, it will be much easier."

69
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
(Laughter)

70
0:04:16.073,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So, he came up with this idea of creating a rebreather,

71
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
with a CO2 scrubber,

72
0:04:22.905,000 --> 0:04:26,000
which was basically a tube from Home Depot,

73
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
with a balloon duct-taped to it,

74
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that he thought we could put inside of me,

75
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and somehow be able to circulate the air and rebreathe

76
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
with this thing in me.

77
0:04:39.778,000 --> 0:04:42,000
This is a little hard to watch.

78
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
But this is that attempt.

79
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So, that clearly wasn't going to work.

80
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
(Laughter)

81
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Then I actually started thinking about liquid breathing.

82
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
There is a chemical that's called perflubron.

83
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And it's so high in oxygen levels that in theory you could breathe it.

84
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So, I got my hands on that chemical,

85
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
filled the sink up with it, and stuck my face in the sink

86
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and tried to breathe that in, which was really impossible.

87
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
It's basically like trying to breathe, as a doctor said,

88
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
while having an elephant standing on your chest.

89
0:05:24.57,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So, that idea disappeared.

90
0:05:26.727,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Then I started thinking,

91
0:05:28.997,000 --> 0:05:32,000
would it be possible to hook up a heart/lung bypass machine

92
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and have a surgery where it was a tube going into my artery,

93
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and then appear to not breathe while they were oxygenating my blood?

94
0:05:40.582,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Which was another insane idea, obviously.

95
0:05:44.89,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Then I thought about the craziest idea of all the ideas:

96
0:05:49.787,000 --> 0:05:5,000
to actually do it.

97
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
(Laughter)

98
0:05:52.331,000 --> 0:05:55,000
To actually try to hold my breath past the point

99
0:05:55.767,000 --> 0:05:57,000
that doctors would consider you brain dead.

100
0:06:01.028,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So, I started researching into pearl divers.

101
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
You know, because they go down for four minutes on one breath.

102
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And when I was researching pearl divers, I found the world of free-diving.

103
0:06:12.788,000 --> 0:06:15,000
It was the most amazing thing that I ever discovered, pretty much.

104
0:06:17.856,000 --> 0:06:19,000
There is many different aspects to free-diving.

105
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
There is depth records, where people go as deep as they can.

106
0:06:23.808,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And then there is static apnea.

107
0:06:25.732,000 --> 0:06:27,000
That's holding your breath as long as you can

108
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
in one place without moving.

109
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
That was the one that I studied.

110
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
The first thing that I learned is when you're holding your breath,

111
0:06:35.38,000 --> 0:06:37,000
you should never move at all; that wastes energy.

112
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And that depletes oxygen,

113
0:06:40.923,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and it builds up CO2 in your blood.

114
0:06:42.786,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So, I learned never to move.

115
0:06:44.678,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And I learned how to slow my heart rate down.

116
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I had to remain perfectly still and just relax

117
0:06:49.475,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and think that I wasn't in my body, and just control that.

118
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And then I learned how to purge.

119
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Purging is basically hyperventilating.

120
0:06:57.737,000 --> 0:06:58,000
You blow in and out --

121
0:06:58.953,000 --> 0:07:02,000
(Breathing loudly)

122
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
You do that, you get lightheaded, you get tingling.

123
0:07:06.261,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And you're really ridding your body of CO2.

124
0:07:08.59,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So, when you hold your breath, it's infinitely easier.

125
0:07:12.676,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Then I learned that you have to take a huge breath,

126
0:07:16.412,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and just hold and relax and never let any air out,

127
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and just hold and relax through all the pain.

128
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Every morning, this is for months,

129
0:07:25.849,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I would wake up and the first thing that I would do

130
0:07:28.713,000 --> 0:07:3,000
is I would hold my breath

131
0:07:31.086,000 --> 0:07:36,000
for, out of 52 minutes, I would hold my breath for 44 minutes.

132
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
So, basically what that means is I would purge,

133
0:07:38.475,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I'd breathe really hard for a minute.

134
0:07:40.36,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And I would hold, immediately after, for five and a half minutes.

135
0:07:43.653,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Then I would breathe again for a minute, purging as hard as I can,

136
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
then immediately after that I would hold again for five and a half minutes.

137
0:07:50.861,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I would repeat this process eight times in a row.

138
0:07:53.796,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Out of 52 minutes, you're only breathing for eight minutes.

139
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
At the end of that you're completely fried, your brain.

140
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
You feel like you're walking around in a daze.

141
0:08:02.475,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And you have these awful headaches.

142
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Basically, I'm not the best person to talk to when I'm doing that stuff.

143
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I started learning about the world-record holder.

144
0:08:10.618,000 --> 0:08:11,000
His name is Tom Sietas.

145
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And this guy is perfectly built for holding his breath.

146
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
He's six foot four. He's 160 pounds.

147
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And his total lung capacity is twice the size of an average person.

148
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I'm six foot one, and fat.

149
0:08:28.837,000 --> 0:08:29,000
We'll say big-boned.

150
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
(Laughter)

151
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I had to drop 50 pounds in three months.

152
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
So, everything that I put into my body, I considered as medicine.

153
0:08:40.794,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Every bit of food was exactly what it was for its nutritional value.

154
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I ate really small controlled portions throughout the day.

155
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And I started to really adapt my body.

156
0:08:53.481,000 --> 0:08:55,000
[Individual results may vary]

157
0:08:55.647,000 --> 0:08:57,000
(Laughter)

158
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
The thinner I was, the longer I was able to hold my breath.

159
0:09:01.909,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And by eating so well and training so hard,

160
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
my resting heart-rate dropped to 38 beats per minute.

161
0:09:08.784,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Which is lower than most Olympic athletes.

162
0:09:12.301,000 --> 0:09:13,000
In four months of training,

163
0:09:13.875,000 --> 0:09:15,000
I was able to hold my breath for over seven minutes.

164
0:09:17.58,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I wanted to try holding my breath everywhere.

165
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I wanted to try it in the most extreme situations

166
0:09:22.618,000 --> 0:09:26,000
to see if I could slow my heart rate down under duress.

167
0:09:26.937,000 --> 0:09:28,000
(Laughter)

168
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
I decided that I was going to break the world record

169
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
live on prime-time television.

170
0:09:35.861,000 --> 0:09:38,000
The world record was eight minutes and 58 seconds,

171
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
held by Tom Sietas, that guy with the whale lungs I told you about.

172
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
I assumed that I could put a water tank at Lincoln Center

173
0:09:47.697,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and if I stayed there a week not eating,

174
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
I would get comfortable in that situation and I would slow my metabolism,

175
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
which I was sure would help me hold my breath

176
0:09:57.427,000 --> 0:09:58,000
longer than I had been able to do it.

177
0:10:00.022,000 --> 0:10:01,000
I was completely wrong.

178
0:10:02.696,000 --> 0:10:05,000
I entered the sphere a week before the scheduled air date.

179
0:10:06.667,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And I thought everything seemed to be on track.

180
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Two days before my big breath-hold attempt, for the record,

181
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
the producers of my television special

182
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
thought that just watching somebody holding their breath, and almost drowning,

183
0:10:22.15,000 --> 0:10:24,000
is too boring for television.

184
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
(Laughter)

185
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
So, I had to add handcuffs, while holding my breath, to escape from.

186
0:10:31.668,000 --> 0:10:32,000
This was a critical mistake.

187
0:10:34.668,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Because of the movement, I was wasting oxygen.

188
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And by seven minutes I had gone into these awful convulsions.

189
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
By 7:08, I started to black out.

190
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And by seven minutes and 30 seconds,

191
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
they had to pull my body out and bring me back.

192
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I had failed on every level.

193
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
(Laughter)

194
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
So, naturally, the only way out of the slump that I could think of was,

195
0:11:10.219,000 --> 0:11:12,000
I decided to call Oprah.

196
0:11:12.706,000 --> 0:11:15,000
(Laughter)

197
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
I told her that I wanted to up the ante

198
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and hold my breath longer than any human being ever had.

199
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
This was a different record.

200
0:11:24.042,000 --> 0:11:26,000
This was a pure O2 static apnea record

201
0:11:26.576,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that Guinness had set the world record at 13 minutes.

202
0:11:31.528,000 --> 0:11:36,000
So, basically you breathe pure O2 first, oxygenating your body, flushing out CO2,

203
0:11:37.095,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and you are able to hold much longer.

204
0:11:40.818,000 --> 0:11:44,000
I realized that my real competition was the beaver.

205
0:11:45.268,000 --> 0:11:47,000
(Laughter)

206
0:11:51.235,000 --> 0:11:52,000
(Laughter ends)

207
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
In January of '08,

208
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Oprah gave me four months to prepare and train.

209
0:11:57.925,000 --> 0:11:59,000
So, I would sleep in a hypoxic tent every night.

210
0:12:00.917,000 --> 0:12:04,000
A hypoxic tent is a tent that simulates altitude at 15,000 feet.

211
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So, it's like base camp, Everest.

212
0:12:07.957,000 --> 0:12:12,000
What that does is, you start building up the red bloodcell count in your body,

213
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
which helps you carry oxygen better.

214
0:12:16.521,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Every morning, again, after getting out of that tent,

215
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
your brain is completely wiped out.

216
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
My first attempt on pure O2, I was able to go up to 15 minutes.

217
0:12:27.899,000 --> 0:12:29,000
So, it was a pretty big success.

218
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
The neurosurgeon pulled me out of the water

219
0:12:32.332,000 --> 0:12:36,000
because in his mind, at 15 minutes your brain is done, you're brain dead.

220
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
So, he pulled me up, and I was fine.

221
0:12:40.863,000 --> 0:12:43,000
There was one person there that was definitely not impressed.

222
0:12:45.022,000 --> 0:12:46,000
It was my ex-girlfriend.

223
0:12:46.67,000 --> 0:12:49,000
While I was breaking the record underwater for the first time,

224
0:12:50.154,000 --> 0:12:53,000
she was sifting through my Blackberry, checking all my messages.

225
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
(Laughter)

226
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
My brother had a picture of it. It is really --

227
0:12:58.803,000 --> 0:12:59,000
(Laughter)

228
0:13:02.707,000 --> 0:13:03,000
(Laughter ends)

229
0:13:03.732,000 --> 0:13:07,000
I then announced that I was going to go for Sietas' record, publicly.

230
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And what he did in response, is he went on Regis and Kelly,

231
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and broke his old record.

232
0:13:15.261,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Then his main competitor went out and broke his record.

233
0:13:19.561,000 --> 0:13:23,000
So, he suddenly pushed the record up to 16 minutes and 32 seconds.

234
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Which was three minutes longer than I had prepared.

235
0:13:27.137,000 --> 0:13:28,000
It was longer than the record.

236
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
I wanted to get the Science Times to document this.

237
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
I wanted to get them to do a piece on it.

238
0:13:36.838,000 --> 0:13:39,000
So, I did what any person

239
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
seriously pursuing scientific advancement would do.

240
0:13:43.973,000 --> 0:13:47,000
I walked into the New York Times offices and did card tricks to everybody.

241
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
(Laughter)

242
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
So, I don't know if it was the magic or the lure of the Cayman Islands,

243
0:13:55.665,000 --> 0:13:56,000
but John Tierney flew down

244
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and did a piece on the seriousness of breath-holding.

245
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
While he was there, I tried to impress him, of course.

246
0:14:02.808,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And I did a dive down to 160 feet,

247
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
which is basically the height of a 16 story building,

248
0:14:09.77,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and as I was coming up, I blacked out underwater,

249
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
which is really dangerous; that's how you drown.

250
0:14:14.57,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Luckily, Kirk had seen me and he swam over and pulled me up.

251
0:14:18.948,000 --> 0:14:2,000
So, I started full focus.

252
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
I completely trained to get my breath-hold time up

253
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
for what I needed to do.

254
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
But there was no way to prepare for the live television aspect of it,

255
0:14:29.57,000 --> 0:14:3,000
being on Oprah.

256
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
But in practice, I would do it face down, floating on the pool.

257
0:14:35.933,000 --> 0:14:4,000
But for TV they wanted me to be upright so they could see my face, basically.

258
0:14:42.386,000 --> 0:14:45,000
The other problem was the suit was so buoyant

259
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
that they had to strap my feet in to keep me from floating up.

260
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
So, I had to use my legs to hold my feet into the straps that were loose,

261
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
which was a real problem for me.

262
0:14:56.331,000 --> 0:14:59,000
That made me extremely nervous, raising the heart rate.

263
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Then, what they also did was,

264
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
which we never did before, is there was a heart-rate monitor.

265
0:15:05.703,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And it was right next to the sphere.

266
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
So, every time my heart would beat, I'd hear the beep-beep-beep-beep,

267
0:15:11.523,000 --> 0:15:13,000
you know, the ticking, really loud.

268
0:15:13.569,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Which was making me more nervous.

269
0:15:15.737,000 --> 0:15:17,000
And there was no way to slow my heart rate down.

270
0:15:20.464,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Normally, I would start at 38 beats per minute,

271
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
and while holding my breath, it would drop to 12 beats per minute,

272
0:15:27.38,000 --> 0:15:28,000
which is pretty unusual.

273
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
(Laughter)

274
0:15:35.626,000 --> 0:15:39,000
This time it started at 120 beats, and it never went down.

275
0:15:41.618,000 --> 0:15:43,000
I spent the first five minutes underwater

276
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
desperately trying to slow my heart rate down.

277
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
I was just sitting there thinking,

278
0:15:48.936,000 --> 0:15:5,000
"I've got to slow this down. I'm going to fail."

279
0:15:51.648,000 --> 0:15:52,000
And I was getting more nervous.

280
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And the heart rate just kept going up and up,

281
0:15:55.427,000 --> 0:15:56,000
all the way up to 150 beats.

282
0:16:00.247,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Basically it's the same thing that created my downfall at Lincoln Center.

283
0:16:03.937,000 --> 0:16:04,000
It was a waste of O2.

284
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
When I made it to the halfway mark, at eight minutes,

285
0:16:08.808,000 --> 0:16:1,000
I was 100 percent certain

286
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
that I was not going to be able to make this.

287
0:16:13.427,000 --> 0:16:15,000
There was no way for me to do it.

288
0:16:16.429,000 --> 0:16:18,000
I figured, Oprah had dedicated an hour

289
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
to doing this breath-hold thing, if I had cracked early,

290
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
it would be a whole show about how depressed I am.

291
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
(Laughter)

292
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
So, I figured I'm better off just fighting and staying there until I black out,

293
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
at least then they can pull me out and take care of me and all that.

294
0:16:34.523,000 --> 0:16:37,000
(Laughter)

295
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
I kept pushing to 10 minutes.

296
0:16:40.332,000 --> 0:16:43,000
At 10 minutes you start getting all these really strong tingling sensations

297
0:16:44.068,000 --> 0:16:45,000
in your fingers and toes.

298
0:16:45.672,000 --> 0:16:46,000
And I knew that that was blood shunting,

299
0:16:47.632,000 --> 0:16:49,000
when the blood rushes away from your extremities

300
0:16:50.15,000 --> 0:16:52,000
to provide oxygen to your vital organs.

301
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
At 11 minutes I started feeling throbbing sensations in my legs,

302
0:16:59.895,000 --> 0:17:02,000
and my lips started to feel really strange.

303
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
At minute 12 I started to have ringing in my ears,

304
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
and I started to feel my arm going numb.

305
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
And I'm a hypochondriac, and I remember arm numb means heart attack.

306
0:17:13.523,000 --> 0:17:15,000
So, I started to really get really paranoid.

307
0:17:17.291,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Then at 13 minutes, maybe because of the hypochondria,

308
0:17:20.226,000 --> 0:17:24,000
I started feeling pains all over my chest.

309
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
It was awful.

310
0:17:25.337,000 --> 0:17:26,000
(Laughter)

311
0:17:26.362,000 --> 0:17:29,000
At 14 minutes, I had these awful contractions,

312
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
like this urge to breathe.

313
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
(Laughter)

314
0:17:38.131,000 --> 0:17:39,000
(Laughter ends)

315
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
At 15 minutes I was suffering major O2 deprivation to the heart.

316
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
And I started having ischemia to the heart.

317
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
My heartbeat would go from 120 to 50,

318
0:17:51.109,000 --> 0:17:56,000
to 150, to 40, to 20, to 150 again.

319
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
It would skip a beat.

320
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
It would start. It would stop. And I felt all this.

321
0:18:00.684,000 --> 0:18:02,000
And I was sure that I was going to have a heart attack.

322
0:18:03.375,000 --> 0:18:05,000
So, at 16 minutes what I did is I slid my feet out

323
0:18:06.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
because I knew that if I did go out, if I did have a heart attack,

324
0:18:10.848,000 --> 0:18:12,000
they'd have to jump into the binding and take my feet out

325
0:18:13.679,000 --> 0:18:14,000
before pulling me up.

326
0:18:14.846,000 --> 0:18:15,000
I was really nervous.

327
0:18:16.254,000 --> 0:18:18,000
I let my feet out, and I started floating to the top.

328
0:18:18.932,000 --> 0:18:19,000
And I didn't take my head out.

329
0:18:20.463,000 --> 0:18:22,000
But I was just floating there waiting for my heart to stop,

330
0:18:23.423,000 --> 0:18:24,000
just waiting.

331
0:18:24.447,000 --> 0:18:27,000
They had doctors with the "Pst," you know, sitting there waiting.

332
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
And then suddenly I hear screaming.

333
0:18:30.827,000 --> 0:18:32,000
And I think that there is some weird thing --

334
0:18:32.961,000 --> 0:18:34,000
that I had died or something had happened.

335
0:18:35.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
And then I realized that I had made it to 16:32.

336
0:18:39.26,000 --> 0:18:41,000
So, with the energy of everybody that was there,

337
0:18:42.26,000 --> 0:18:43,000
I decided to keep pushing.

338
0:18:44.26,000 --> 0:18:46,000
And I went to 17 minutes and four seconds.

339
0:18:46.73,000 --> 0:18:49,000
(Applause)

340
0:18:54.504,000 --> 0:18:55,000
(Applause ends)

341
0:18:56.26,000 --> 0:18:58,000
As though that wasn't enough, what I did immediately after

342
0:18:59.046,000 --> 0:19:,000
is I went to Quest Labs

343
0:19:00.46,000 --> 0:19:02,000
and had them take every blood sample that they could

344
0:19:02.988,000 --> 0:19:04,000
to test for everything and to see where my levels were,

345
0:19:05.639,000 --> 0:19:06,000
so the doctors could use it, once again.

346
0:19:07.653,000 --> 0:19:09,000
I also didn't want anybody to question it.

347
0:19:09.693,000 --> 0:19:12,000
I had the world record and I wanted to make sure it was legitimate.

348
0:19:13.26,000 --> 0:19:15,000
So, I get to New York City the next day,

349
0:19:16.26,000 --> 0:19:19,000
I'm walking out of the Apple store,

350
0:19:19.523,000 --> 0:19:21,000
and this kid walks up to me he's like, "Yo, D!"

351
0:19:21.795,000 --> 0:19:22,000
I'm like "Yeah?"

352
0:19:23.26,000 --> 0:19:25,000
He said, "If you really held your breath that long,

353
0:19:26.26,000 --> 0:19:27,000
why'd you come out of the water dry?"

354
0:19:28.26,000 --> 0:19:29,000
I was like "What?"

355
0:19:30.26,000 --> 0:19:31,000
(Laughter)

356
0:19:32.26,000 --> 0:19:33,000
And that's my life. So --

357
0:19:34.26,000 --> 0:19:38,000
(Laughter)

358
0:19:39.26,000 --> 0:19:41,000
As a magician, I try to show things to people

359
0:19:41.38,000 --> 0:19:42,000
that seem impossible.

360
0:19:43.26,000 --> 0:19:44,000
And I think magic,

361
0:19:44.765,000 --> 0:19:47,000
whether I'm holding my breath or shuffling a deck of cards,

362
0:19:48.26,000 --> 0:19:49,000
is pretty simple.

363
0:19:50.26,000 --> 0:19:53,000
It's practice, it's training, and it's -- (Sobs)

364
0:19:54.73,000 --> 0:19:56,000
It's practice, it's training and experimenting,

365
0:19:57.546,000 --> 0:19:58,000
(Sobs)

366
0:19:58.841,000 --> 0:20:01,000
while pushing through the pain to be the best that I can be.

367
0:20:01.994,000 --> 0:20:04,000
And that's what magic is to me, so, thank you.

368
0:20:05.427,000 --> 0:20:08,000
(Applause)

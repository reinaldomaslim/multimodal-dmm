1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm here to tell you not just my story

2
0:00:16.44,000 --> 0:00:21,000
but stories of exceptional women from India whom I've met.

3
0:00:21.48,000 --> 0:00:23,000
They continue to inspire me,

4
0:00:23.64,000 --> 0:00:27,000
teach me, guide me in my journey of my life.

5
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:3,000
These are incredible women.

6
0:00:30.08,000 --> 0:00:33,000
They never had an opportunity to go to school,

7
0:00:33.2,000 --> 0:00:34,000
they had no degrees,

8
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:37,000
no travel, no exposure.

9
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Ordinary women who did extraordinary things

10
0:00:41.72,000 --> 0:00:43,000
with the greatest of their courage,

11
0:00:43.88,000 --> 0:00:45,000
wisdom and humility.

12
0:00:46.68,000 --> 0:00:47,000
These are my teachers.

13
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
For the last three decades,

14
0:00:50.92,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I've been working, staying and living in India

15
0:00:54.36,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and working with women in rural India.

16
0:00:58.04,000 --> 0:01:,000
I was born and brought up in Mumbai.

17
0:01:01.08,000 --> 0:01:02,000
When I was in college,

18
0:01:02.72,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I met Jayaprakash Narayan,

19
0:01:05.96,000 --> 0:01:07,000
famous Gandhian leader

20
0:01:08.28,000 --> 0:01:11,000
who inspired youth to work in rural India.

21
0:01:12.44,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I went into the villages to work in rural India.

22
0:01:15.64,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I was part of land rights movement,

23
0:01:18.44,000 --> 0:01:19,000
farmers' movement

24
0:01:19.96,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and women's movement.

25
0:01:22.4,000 --> 0:01:23,000
On the same line,

26
0:01:23.72,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I ended up in a very small village,

27
0:01:26.72,000 --> 0:01:32,000
fell in love with a young, handsome, dynamic young farmer-leader

28
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
who was not very educated,

29
0:01:35.52,000 --> 0:01:37,000
but he could pull the crowd.

30
0:01:37.88,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And so in the passion of youth,

31
0:01:40.48,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I married him

32
0:01:42.36,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and left Mumbai,

33
0:01:43.84,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and went to a small village which did not have running water

34
0:01:48.04,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and no toilet.

35
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Honestly, my family and friends were horrified.

36
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
(Laughter)

37
0:01:56.32,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I was staying with my family,

38
0:01:58.76,000 --> 0:02:,000
with my three children in the village,

39
0:02:01.4,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and one day,

40
0:02:03.2,000 --> 0:02:05,000
a few years later one day,

41
0:02:05.48,000 --> 0:02:07,000
a woman called Kantabai came to me.

42
0:02:09.48,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Kantabai said, "I want to open a saving account.

43
0:02:14.32,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I want to save."

44
0:02:16.6,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I asked Kantabai:

45
0:02:18.12,000 --> 0:02:21,000
"You are doing business of blacksmith.

46
0:02:21.6,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Do you have enough money to save?

47
0:02:23.6,000 --> 0:02:25,000
You are staying on the street.

48
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Can you save?"

49
0:02:27.28,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Kantabai was insistent.

50
0:02:29.24,000 --> 0:02:34,000
She said, "I want to save because I want to buy a plastic sheet

51
0:02:34.48,000 --> 0:02:35,000
before the monsoons arrive.

52
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I want to save my family from rain."

53
0:02:39.84,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I went with Kantabai to the bank.

54
0:02:42.44,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Kantabai wanted to save 10 rupees a day --

55
0:02:45.48,000 --> 0:02:47,000
less than 15 cents.

56
0:02:48.4,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Bank manager refused to open the account of Kantabai.

57
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:56,000
He said Kantabai's amount is too small

58
0:02:56.96,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and it's not worth his time.

59
0:03:00.12,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Kantabai was not asking any loan from the bank.

60
0:03:03.68,000 --> 0:03:07,000
She was not asking any subsidy or grant from the government.

61
0:03:08.04,000 --> 0:03:11,000
What she was asking was to have a safe place

62
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:14,000
to save her hard-earned money.

63
0:03:14.12,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And that was her right.

64
0:03:16.48,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And I went --

65
0:03:17.72,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I said if banks are not opening the account of Kantabai,

66
0:03:21.2,000 --> 0:03:23,000
why not start the bank

67
0:03:23.36,000 --> 0:03:27,000
which will give an opportunity for women like Kantabai to save?

68
0:03:28.12,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And I applied for the banking license to Reserve Bank of India.

69
0:03:32.84,000 --> 0:03:36,000
(Applause)

70
0:03:38.28,000 --> 0:03:41,000
No, it was not an easy task.

71
0:03:41.56,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Our license was rejected --

72
0:03:43.6,000 --> 0:03:44,000
(Laughter)

73
0:03:45,000 --> 0:03:46,000
on the grounds --

74
0:03:46.24,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Reserve Bank said that we cannot issue a license

75
0:03:49.2,000 --> 0:03:52,000
to the bank whose promoting members who are nonliterate.

76
0:03:53.64,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I was terrified.

77
0:03:54.92,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I was crying.

78
0:03:56.36,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And by coming back home,

79
0:03:58.28,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I was continuously crying.

80
0:04:00.24,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I told Kantabai and other women

81
0:04:02.64,000 --> 0:04:05,000
that we couldn't get the license because our women are nonliterate.

82
0:04:07.2,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Our women said, "Stop crying.

83
0:04:10.44,000 --> 0:04:12,000
We will learn to read and write

84
0:04:12.56,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and apply again, so what?"

85
0:04:14.6,000 --> 0:04:19,000
(Applause)

86
0:04:21.6,000 --> 0:04:23,000
We started our literacy classes.

87
0:04:24.08,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Every day our women would come.

88
0:04:26.64,000 --> 0:04:29,000
They were so determined that after working the whole day,

89
0:04:30.399,000 --> 0:04:33,000
they would come to the class and learn to read and write.

90
0:04:33.88,000 --> 0:04:34,000
After five months,

91
0:04:35.28,000 --> 0:04:36,000
we applied again,

92
0:04:36.84,000 --> 0:04:39,000
but this time I didn't go alone.

93
0:04:39.88,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Fifteen women accompanied me to Reserve Bank of India.

94
0:04:44.44,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Our women told the officer of Reserve Bank,

95
0:04:47.48,000 --> 0:04:51,000
"You rejected the license because we cannot read and write.

96
0:04:51.88,000 --> 0:04:54,000
You rejected the license because we are nonliterate."

97
0:04:55,000 --> 0:04:57,000
But they said, "There were no schools when we were growing,

98
0:04:57.84,000 --> 0:05:,000
so we are not responsible for our noneducation."

99
0:05:01.64,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And they said, "We cannot read and write,

100
0:05:04.48,000 --> 0:05:05,000
but we can count."

101
0:05:05.88,000 --> 0:05:07,000
(Laughter)

102
0:05:07.92,000 --> 0:05:08,000
(Applause)

103
0:05:09.8,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And they challenged the officer.

104
0:05:12.52,000 --> 0:05:16,000
"Then tell us to calculate the interest of any principal amount."

105
0:05:16.72,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Laughter)

106
0:05:17.76,000 --> 0:05:18,000
"If we are unable to do it,

107
0:05:19.56,000 --> 0:05:2,000
don't give us license.

108
0:05:21.44,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Tell your officers to do it without a calculator

109
0:05:25.04,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and see who can calculate faster."

110
0:05:27.64,000 --> 0:05:3,000
(Applause)

111
0:05:33.12,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Needless to say,

112
0:05:35.04,000 --> 0:05:36,000
we got the banking license.

113
0:05:36.92,000 --> 0:05:37,000
(Laughter)

114
0:05:38.64,000 --> 0:05:4,000
(Applause)

115
0:05:42.6,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Today, more than 100,000 women are banking with us

116
0:05:46.6,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and we have more than 20 million dollars of capital.

117
0:05:50.48,000 --> 0:05:52,000
This is all women's savings,

118
0:05:52.92,000 --> 0:05:53,000
women capital,

119
0:05:54.36,000 --> 0:05:56,000
no outside investors asking for a business plan.

120
0:05:57.28,000 --> 0:05:58,000
No.

121
0:05:58.52,000 --> 0:05:59,000
It's our own rural women's savings.

122
0:06:00.44,000 --> 0:06:04,000
(Applause)

123
0:06:08.24,000 --> 0:06:1,000
I also want to say that yes,

124
0:06:10.36,000 --> 0:06:12,000
after we got the license,

125
0:06:12.48,000 --> 0:06:14,000
today Kantabai has her own house

126
0:06:15.4,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and is staying with her family

127
0:06:17.04,000 --> 0:06:2,000
in her own house for herself and her family.

128
0:06:20.92,000 --> 0:06:25,000
(Applause)

129
0:06:26.08,000 --> 0:06:28,000
When we started our banking operations,

130
0:06:28.4,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I could see that our women were not able to come to the bank

131
0:06:31.84,000 --> 0:06:33,000
because they used to lose the working day.

132
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I thought if women are not coming to the bank,

133
0:06:36.8,000 --> 0:06:37,000
bank will go to them,

134
0:06:38.24,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and we started doorstep banking.

135
0:06:41.04,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Recently, we starting digital banking.

136
0:06:44.36,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Digital banking required to remember a PIN number.

137
0:06:47.96,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Our women said, "We don't want a PIN number.

138
0:06:51.6,000 --> 0:06:52,000
That's not a good idea."

139
0:06:53.28,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And we tried to explain to them

140
0:06:54.84,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that maybe you should remember the PIN number;

141
0:06:57.36,000 --> 0:06:59,000
we will help you to remember the PIN number.

142
0:06:59.72,000 --> 0:07:,000
They were firm.

143
0:07:00.96,000 --> 0:07:01,000
They said, "suggest something else,"

144
0:07:02.8,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and they --

145
0:07:04.04,000 --> 0:07:06,000
(Laughter)

146
0:07:06.92,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and they said, "What about thumb?"

147
0:07:10.2,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I thought that's a great idea.

148
0:07:12.68,000 --> 0:07:15,000
We'll link that digital banking with biometric,

149
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and now women use the digital financial transaction

150
0:07:19.76,000 --> 0:07:2,000
by using the thumb.

151
0:07:21.32,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And you know what they said?

152
0:07:24.08,000 --> 0:07:26,000
They said, "Anybody can steal my PIN number

153
0:07:26.28,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and take away my hard-earned money,

154
0:07:28.44,000 --> 0:07:29,000
but nobody can steal my thumb."

155
0:07:30.44,000 --> 0:07:34,000
(Applause)

156
0:07:34.84,000 --> 0:07:38,000
That reinforced the teaching which I have always learned from women:

157
0:07:39.84,000 --> 0:07:42,000
never provide poor solutions to poor people.

158
0:07:43.8,000 --> 0:07:44,000
They are smart.

159
0:07:45.04,000 --> 0:07:5,000
(Applause)

160
0:07:53.32,000 --> 0:07:54,000
A few months later,

161
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:57,000
another woman came to the bank --

162
0:07:57.04,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Kerabai.

163
0:07:58.6,000 --> 0:08:01,000
She mortgaged her gold and took the loan.

164
0:08:02.04,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I asked Kerabai, "Why are you mortgaging your precious jewelry

165
0:08:06.76,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and taking a loan?"

166
0:08:08.48,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Kerabai said, "Don't you realize that it's a terrible drought?

167
0:08:12.48,000 --> 0:08:15,000
There's no food or fodder for the animals.

168
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
No water.

169
0:08:17.4,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I'm mortgaging gold to buy food and fodder for my animals."

170
0:08:21.92,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And then she asks me, "Can I mortgage gold and get water?"

171
0:08:26.72,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I had no answer.

172
0:08:28.84,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Kerabai challenged me: "You're working in the village

173
0:08:32.04,000 --> 0:08:33,000
with women and finance,

174
0:08:33.96,000 --> 0:08:36,000
but what if one day there's no water?

175
0:08:37.44,000 --> 0:08:38,000
If you leave this village,

176
0:08:38.8,000 --> 0:08:39,000
with whom are you going to do banking?"

177
0:08:41.52,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Kerabai had a valid question,

178
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:45,000
so in this drought,

179
0:08:45.48,000 --> 0:08:48,000
we decided to start the cattle camp in the area.

180
0:08:49.4,000 --> 0:08:53,000
It's where farmers can bring their animals to one place

181
0:08:53.76,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and get fodder and water.

182
0:08:57.6,000 --> 0:08:58,000
It didn't rain.

183
0:08:58.88,000 --> 0:09:,000
Cattle camp was extended for 18 months.

184
0:09:01.76,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Kerabai used to move around in the cattle camp

185
0:09:05.08,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and sing the songs of encouragement.

186
0:09:08.24,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Kerabai became very popular.

187
0:09:10.64,000 --> 0:09:13,000
It rained and cattle camp was ended,

188
0:09:14.64,000 --> 0:09:15,000
but after cattle camp ended,

189
0:09:16.56,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Kerabai came to our radio --

190
0:09:18.76,000 --> 0:09:19,000
we have community radio

191
0:09:20.72,000 --> 0:09:23,000
which has more than 100,000 listeners.

192
0:09:23.8,000 --> 0:09:26,000
She said, "I want to have a regular show on the radio."

193
0:09:28.28,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Our radio manager said, "Kerabai, you cannot read and write.

194
0:09:32.68,000 --> 0:09:34,000
How will you write the script?"

195
0:09:34.76,000 --> 0:09:35,000
You know what she replied?

196
0:09:36.4,000 --> 0:09:37,000
"I cannot read and write,

197
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:39,000
but I can sing.

198
0:09:39.44,000 --> 0:09:4,000
What's the big deal?"

199
0:09:40.72,000 --> 0:09:41,000
(Laughter)

200
0:09:42.48,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And today,

201
0:09:43.76,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Kerabai is doing a regular radio program,

202
0:09:47.04,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and not only that,

203
0:09:48.44,000 --> 0:09:51,000
she's become a famous radio jockey

204
0:09:51.48,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and she has been invited by all of the radios,

205
0:09:54.2,000 --> 0:09:55,000
even from Mumbai.

206
0:09:55.8,000 --> 0:09:57,000
She gets the invitation and she does the show.

207
0:09:58.76,000 --> 0:10:03,000
(Applause)

208
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Kerabai has become a local celebrity.

209
0:10:06.8,000 --> 0:10:07,000
One day I asked Kerabai,

210
0:10:08.52,000 --> 0:10:09,000
"How did you end up singing?"

211
0:10:11.8,000 --> 0:10:13,000
She said, "Shall I tell you the real fact?

212
0:10:14.64,000 --> 0:10:16,000
When I was pregnant with my first child,

213
0:10:17.48,000 --> 0:10:18,000
I was always hungry.

214
0:10:19.24,000 --> 0:10:2,000
I did not have enough food to eat.

215
0:10:21.2,000 --> 0:10:23,000
I did not have enough money to buy food,

216
0:10:24.08,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and so to forget my hunger, I started singing."

217
0:10:28.64,000 --> 0:10:3,000
So strong and wise, no?

218
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
I always think that our women overcome so many obstacles --

219
0:10:36.6,000 --> 0:10:39,000
cultural, social, financial --

220
0:10:39.76,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and they find out their ways.

221
0:10:43.76,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I would like to share another story:

222
0:10:45.76,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Sunita Kamble.

223
0:10:47.64,000 --> 0:10:51,000
She has taken a course in a business school,

224
0:10:51.72,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and she has become a veterinary doctor.

225
0:10:54.52,000 --> 0:10:55,000
She's Dalit;

226
0:10:55.76,000 --> 0:10:57,000
she comes from an untouchable caste,

227
0:10:57.88,000 --> 0:11:,000
but she does artificial insemination in goats.

228
0:11:01.68,000 --> 0:11:03,000
It is a very male-dominated profession

229
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and it is all the more difficult for Sunita

230
0:11:06.84,000 --> 0:11:08,000
because Sunita comes from an untouchable caste.

231
0:11:09.36,000 --> 0:11:1,000
But she worked very hard.

232
0:11:11.04,000 --> 0:11:15,000
She did successful goat deliveries in the region

233
0:11:15.52,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and she became a famous goat doctor.

234
0:11:18.76,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Recently, she got a national award.

235
0:11:22.04,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I went to Sunita's house to celebrate --

236
0:11:25.32,000 --> 0:11:26,000
to congratulate her.

237
0:11:26.96,000 --> 0:11:27,000
When I entered the village,

238
0:11:28.36,000 --> 0:11:3,000
I saw a big cutout of Sunita.

239
0:11:31.04,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Sunita was smiling on that picture.

240
0:11:33.36,000 --> 0:11:36,000
I was really surprised to see an untouchable,

241
0:11:36.88,000 --> 0:11:37,000
coming from the village,

242
0:11:38.4,000 --> 0:11:4,000
having a big cutout at the entrance of the village.

243
0:11:41.8,000 --> 0:11:42,000
When I went to her house,

244
0:11:43.4,000 --> 0:11:45,000
I was even more amazed

245
0:11:45.56,000 --> 0:11:47,000
because upper caste leaders --

246
0:11:47.88,000 --> 0:11:49,000
men -- were sitting in the house, in her house,

247
0:11:50.64,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and having chai and water,

248
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:55,000
which is very rare in India.

249
0:11:55.04,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Upper caste leaders do not go to an untouchable's house

250
0:11:57.88,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and have chai or water.

251
0:11:59.72,000 --> 0:12:,000
And they were requesting her

252
0:12:01.64,000 --> 0:12:03,000
to come and address the gathering of the village.

253
0:12:05.28,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Sunita broke centuries-old caste conditioning in India.

254
0:12:11.52,000 --> 0:12:17,000
(Applause)

255
0:12:17.72,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Let me come to what the younger generations do.

256
0:12:21.04,000 --> 0:12:22,000
As I'm standing here --

257
0:12:22.8,000 --> 0:12:24,000
I'm so proud as I stand here,

258
0:12:25.32,000 --> 0:12:27,000
from Mhaswad to Vancouver.

259
0:12:28.12,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Back home, Sarita Bhise --

260
0:12:31.24,000 --> 0:12:33,000
she's not even 16 years old.

261
0:12:34.08,000 --> 0:12:36,000
She's preparing herself --

262
0:12:36.36,000 --> 0:12:38,000
she's a part of our sports program,

263
0:12:38.48,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Champions' program.

264
0:12:40.8,000 --> 0:12:44,000
She's preparing herself to represent India in field hockey.

265
0:12:44.84,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And you know where she's going?

266
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
She's going to represent in 2020 Olympics, Tokyo.

267
0:12:52.72,000 --> 0:12:57,000
(Applause)

268
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Sarita comes from a very poor shepherd community.

269
0:13:01.88,000 --> 0:13:04,000
I am just -- I couldn't be more proud of her.

270
0:13:06.48,000 --> 0:13:11,000
There are millions of women like Sarita, Kerabai, Sunita,

271
0:13:11.6,000 --> 0:13:13,000
who can be around you also.

272
0:13:13.64,000 --> 0:13:15,000
They can be all over the world,

273
0:13:15.76,000 --> 0:13:19,000
but at first glance you may think that they do not have anything to say,

274
0:13:20.44,000 --> 0:13:22,000
they do not have anything to share.

275
0:13:22.6,000 --> 0:13:24,000
You would be so wrong.

276
0:13:24.68,000 --> 0:13:27,000
I am so lucky that I'm working with these women.

277
0:13:28.48,000 --> 0:13:3,000
They are sharing their stories with me,

278
0:13:31.04,000 --> 0:13:33,000
they are sharing their wisdom with me,

279
0:13:33.72,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and I'm just lucky to be with them.

280
0:13:38.12,000 --> 0:13:39,000
20 years before --

281
0:13:40.52,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and I'm so proud --

282
0:13:42.04,000 --> 0:13:44,000
we went to Reserve Bank of India

283
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and we set up the first rural women's bank.

284
0:13:47.72,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Today they are pushing me to go to National Stock Exchange

285
0:13:51.84,000 --> 0:13:56,000
to set up the first fund dedicated to micro rural women entrepreneurs.

286
0:13:57.64,000 --> 0:13:59,000
They are pushing me to set up

287
0:14:00.2,000 --> 0:14:03,000
the first small finance women's bank in the world.

288
0:14:04.4,000 --> 0:14:05,000
And as one of them said,

289
0:14:06.2,000 --> 0:14:08,000
"My courage is my capital."

290
0:14:08.56,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And I say here,

291
0:14:10.32,000 --> 0:14:12,000
their courage is my capital.

292
0:14:13.84,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And if you want,

293
0:14:15.24,000 --> 0:14:16,000
it can be yours also.

294
0:14:17.52,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Thank you.

295
0:14:18.76,000 --> 0:14:22,000
(Applause)

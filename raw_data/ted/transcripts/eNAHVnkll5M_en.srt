1
0:00:12.315,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I was about 10 years old

2
0:00:14.572,000 --> 0:00:15,000
on a camping trip with my dad

3
0:00:16.271,000 --> 0:00:18,000
in the Adirondack Mountains, a wilderness area

4
0:00:19.031,000 --> 0:00:21,000
in the northern part of New York State.

5
0:00:22.026,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It was a beautiful day.

6
0:00:23.467,000 --> 0:00:25,000
The forest was sparkling.

7
0:00:25.469,000 --> 0:00:28,000
The sun made the leaves glow like stained glass,

8
0:00:28.993,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and if it weren't for the path we were following,

9
0:00:32.198,000 --> 0:00:33,000
we could almost pretend we were

10
0:00:33.602,000 --> 0:00:36,000
the first human beings to ever walk that land.

11
0:00:37.164,000 --> 0:00:38,000
We got to our campsite.

12
0:00:38.815,000 --> 0:00:39,000
It was a lean-to on a bluff

13
0:00:40.782,000 --> 0:00:42,000
looking over a crystal, beautiful lake,

14
0:00:43.478,000 --> 0:00:45,000
when I discovered a horror.

15
0:00:46.174,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Behind the lean-to was a dump,

16
0:00:49.272,000 --> 0:00:5,000
maybe 40 feet square

17
0:00:50.73,000 --> 0:00:52,000
with rotting apple cores

18
0:00:53.043,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and balled-up aluminum foil,

19
0:00:54.79,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and a dead sneaker.

20
0:00:56.539,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And I was astonished,

21
0:00:59.11,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I was very angry, and I was deeply confused.

22
0:01:02.542,000 --> 0:01:03,000
The campers who were too lazy

23
0:01:04.124,000 --> 0:01:05,000
to take out what they had brought in,

24
0:01:06.082,000 --> 0:01:09,000
who did they think would clean up after them?

25
0:01:09.927,000 --> 0:01:1,000
That question stayed with me,

26
0:01:11.836,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and it simplified a little.

27
0:01:13.803,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Who cleans up after us?

28
0:01:16.179,000 --> 0:01:17,000
However you configure

29
0:01:17.601,000 --> 0:01:18,000
or wherever you place the us,

30
0:01:19.308,000 --> 0:01:21,000
who cleans up after us in Istanbul?

31
0:01:21.898,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Who cleans up after us in Rio

32
0:01:24.154,000 --> 0:01:26,000
or in Paris or in London?

33
0:01:26.683,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Here in New York,

34
0:01:28.255,000 --> 0:01:3,000
the Department of Sanitation cleans up after us,

35
0:01:30.847,000 --> 0:01:32,000
to the tune of 11,000 tons of garbage

36
0:01:33.517,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and 2,000 tons of recyclables every day.

37
0:01:37.879,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I wanted to get to know them as individuals.

38
0:01:40.512,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I wanted to understand who takes the job.

39
0:01:43.358,000 --> 0:01:45,000
What's it like to wear the uniform

40
0:01:45.877,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and bear that burden?

41
0:01:47.531,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So I started a research project with them.

42
0:01:50.184,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I rode in the trucks and walked the routes

43
0:01:52.723,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and interviewed people in offices and facilities

44
0:01:55.132,000 --> 0:01:56,000
all over the city,

45
0:01:56.639,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and I learned a lot,

46
0:01:58.378,000 --> 0:02:,000
but I was still an outsider.

47
0:02:00.727,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I needed to go deeper.

48
0:02:02.605,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So I took the job as a sanitation worker.

49
0:02:05.721,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I didn't just ride in the trucks now. I drove the trucks.

50
0:02:08.368,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And I operated the mechanical brooms and I plowed the snow.

51
0:02:11.513,000 --> 0:02:12,000
It was a remarkable privilege

52
0:02:13.412,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and an amazing education.

53
0:02:16.019,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Everyone asks about the smell.

54
0:02:18.171,000 --> 0:02:21,000
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you think,

55
0:02:21.231,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and on days when it is really bad,

56
0:02:22.745,000 --> 0:02:24,000
you get used to it rather quickly.

57
0:02:25.421,000 --> 0:02:28,000
The weight takes a long time to get used to.

58
0:02:28.618,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I knew people who were several years on the job

59
0:02:30.905,000 --> 0:02:32,000
whose bodies were still adjusting to the burden

60
0:02:33.49,000 --> 0:02:35,000
of bearing on your body

61
0:02:35.571,000 --> 0:02:37,000
tons of trash every week.

62
0:02:38.55,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Then there's the danger.

63
0:02:40.734,000 --> 0:02:42,000
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,

64
0:02:43.206,000 --> 0:02:45,000
sanitation work is one of the 10 most dangerous

65
0:02:45.408,000 --> 0:02:46,000
occupations in the country,

66
0:02:47.3,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and I learned why.

67
0:02:49.051,000 --> 0:02:5,000
You're in and out of traffic all day,

68
0:02:50.472,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and it's zooming around you.

69
0:02:51.433,000 --> 0:02:52,000
It just wants to get past you, so it's often

70
0:02:53.317,000 --> 0:02:55,000
the motorist is not paying attention.

71
0:02:55.367,000 --> 0:02:56,000
That's really bad for the worker.

72
0:02:57.193,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And then the garbage itself is full of hazards

73
0:02:59.353,000 --> 0:03:01,000
that often fly back out of the truck

74
0:03:01.372,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and do terrible harm.

75
0:03:03.453,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I also learned about the relentlessness of trash.

76
0:03:06.268,000 --> 0:03:07,000
When you step off the curb

77
0:03:07.579,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and you see a city from behind a truck,

78
0:03:10.428,000 --> 0:03:11,000
you come to understand that trash

79
0:03:12.214,000 --> 0:03:14,000
is like a force of nature unto itself.

80
0:03:14.831,000 --> 0:03:16,000
It never stops coming.

81
0:03:17.287,000 --> 0:03:2,000
It's also like a form of respiration or circulation.

82
0:03:20.766,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It must always be in motion.

83
0:03:23.811,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And then there's the stigma.

84
0:03:25.859,000 --> 0:03:27,000
You put on the uniform, and you become invisible

85
0:03:28.775,000 --> 0:03:3,000
until someone is upset with you for whatever reason

86
0:03:31.079,000 --> 0:03:33,000
like you've blocked traffic with your truck,

87
0:03:33.394,000 --> 0:03:35,000
or you're taking a break too close to their home,

88
0:03:36.045,000 --> 0:03:39,000
or you're drinking coffee in their diner,

89
0:03:39.159,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and they will come and scorn you,

90
0:03:41.569,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and tell you that they don't want you anywhere near them.

91
0:03:44.831,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I find the stigma especially ironic,

92
0:03:47.263,000 --> 0:03:5,000
because I strongly believe that sanitation workers

93
0:03:50.574,000 --> 0:03:51,000
are the most important labor force

94
0:03:52.254,000 --> 0:03:55,000
on the streets of the city, for three reasons.

95
0:03:55.278,000 --> 0:03:57,000
They are the first guardians of public health.

96
0:03:58.06,000 --> 0:04:,000
If they're not taking away trash

97
0:04:00.466,000 --> 0:04:02,000
efficiently and effectively every day,

98
0:04:02.74,000 --> 0:04:04,000
it starts to spill out of its containments,

99
0:04:05.451,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and the dangers inherent to it threaten us

100
0:04:09.177,000 --> 0:04:1,000
in very real ways.

101
0:04:10.351,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Diseases we've had in check for decades and centuries

102
0:04:13.322,000 --> 0:04:15,000
burst forth again and start to harm us.

103
0:04:16.228,000 --> 0:04:17,000
The economy needs them.

104
0:04:17.9,000 --> 0:04:19,000
If we can't throw out the old stuff,

105
0:04:20.826,000 --> 0:04:21,000
we have no room for the new stuff,

106
0:04:22.716,000 --> 0:04:24,000
so then the engines of the economy

107
0:04:24.785,000 --> 0:04:26,000
start to sputter when consumption is compromised.

108
0:04:27.714,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I'm not advocating capitalism, I'm just pointing out their relationship.

109
0:04:31.778,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And then there's what I call

110
0:04:33.766,000 --> 0:04:37,000
our average, necessary quotidian velocity.

111
0:04:37.978,000 --> 0:04:38,000
By that I simply mean

112
0:04:39.027,000 --> 0:04:41,000
how fast we're used to moving

113
0:04:41.279,000 --> 0:04:43,000
in the contemporary day and age.

114
0:04:43.411,000 --> 0:04:48,000
We usually don't care for, repair, clean, carry around

115
0:04:48.755,000 --> 0:04:5,000
our coffee cup, our shopping bag,

116
0:04:51.392,000 --> 0:04:52,000
our bottle of water.

117
0:04:52.877,000 --> 0:04:54,000
We use them, we throw them out, we forget about them,

118
0:04:55.556,000 --> 0:04:56,000
because we know there's a workforce

119
0:04:57.336,000 --> 0:05:,000
on the other side that's going to take it all away.

120
0:05:00.356,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So I want to suggest today a couple of ways

121
0:05:02.803,000 --> 0:05:06,000
to think about sanitation that will perhaps help

122
0:05:07.317,000 --> 0:05:09,000
ameliorate the stigma

123
0:05:09.791,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and bring them into this conversation

124
0:05:12.022,000 --> 0:05:17,000
of how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane.

125
0:05:17.612,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Their work, I think, is kind of liturgical.

126
0:05:21.773,000 --> 0:05:23,000
They're on the streets every day, rhythmically.

127
0:05:24.234,000 --> 0:05:26,000
They wear a uniform in many cities.

128
0:05:26.295,000 --> 0:05:27,000
You know when to expect them.

129
0:05:28.164,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And their work lets us do our work.

130
0:05:32.087,000 --> 0:05:34,000
They are almost a form of reassurance.

131
0:05:34.878,000 --> 0:05:35,000
The flow that they maintain

132
0:05:36.615,000 --> 0:05:37,000
keeps us safe from ourselves,

133
0:05:38.605,000 --> 0:05:4,000
from our own dross, our cast-offs,

134
0:05:41.242,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and that flow must be maintained always

135
0:05:44.5,000 --> 0:05:45,000
no matter what.

136
0:05:46.133,000 --> 0:05:49,000
On the day after September 11 in 2001,

137
0:05:49.857,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I heard the growl of a sanitation truck on the street,

138
0:05:53.144,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and I grabbed my infant son and I ran downstairs

139
0:05:55.456,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and there was a man doing his paper recycling route

140
0:05:58.298,000 --> 0:06:,000
like he did every Wednesday.

141
0:06:00.48,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And I tried to thank him for doing his work

142
0:06:02.9,000 --> 0:06:04,000
on that day of all days,

143
0:06:05.025,000 --> 0:06:07,000
but I started to cry.

144
0:06:07.626,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And he looked at me,

145
0:06:09.31,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and he just nodded, and he said,

146
0:06:12.734,000 --> 0:06:14,000
"We're going to be okay.

147
0:06:15.612,000 --> 0:06:17,000
We're going to be okay."

148
0:06:18.253,000 --> 0:06:19,000
It was a little while later that I started

149
0:06:19.606,000 --> 0:06:2,000
my research with sanitation,

150
0:06:20.986,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and I met that man again.

151
0:06:22.4,000 --> 0:06:24,000
His name is Paulie, and we worked together many times,

152
0:06:25.317,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and we became good friends.

153
0:06:27.14,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I want to believe that Paulie was right.

154
0:06:29.967,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We are going to be okay.

155
0:06:32.169,000 --> 0:06:33,000
But in our effort to reconfigure

156
0:06:34.146,000 --> 0:06:37,000
how we as a species exist on this planet,

157
0:06:37.187,000 --> 0:06:4,000
we must include and take account of

158
0:06:40.482,000 --> 0:06:43,000
all the costs, including the very real human cost

159
0:06:44.275,000 --> 0:06:45,000
of the labor.

160
0:06:45.779,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And we also would be well informed

161
0:06:48.58,000 --> 0:06:5,000
to reach out to the people who do that work

162
0:06:50.798,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and get their expertise

163
0:06:52.643,000 --> 0:06:53,000
on how do we think about,

164
0:06:54.396,000 --> 0:06:57,000
how do we create systems around sustainability

165
0:06:57.646,000 --> 0:07:,000
that perhaps take us from curbside recycling,

166
0:07:01.125,000 --> 0:07:03,000
which is a remarkable success across 40 years,

167
0:07:03.71,000 --> 0:07:06,000
across the United States and countries around the world,

168
0:07:06.948,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and lift us up to a broader horizon

169
0:07:09.75,000 --> 0:07:11,000
where we're looking at other forms of waste

170
0:07:12.636,000 --> 0:07:13,000
that could be lessened

171
0:07:14.121,000 --> 0:07:16,000
from manufacturing and industrial sources.

172
0:07:16.854,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Municipal waste, what we think of when we talk about garbage,

173
0:07:20.859,000 --> 0:07:23,000
accounts for three percent of the nation's waste stream.

174
0:07:24.857,000 --> 0:07:26,000
It's a remarkable statistic.

175
0:07:27.244,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So in the flow of your days,

176
0:07:29.722,000 --> 0:07:3,000
in the flow of your lives,

177
0:07:31.248,000 --> 0:07:34,000
next time you see someone whose job is

178
0:07:34.276,000 --> 0:07:37,000
to clean up after you,

179
0:07:37.419,000 --> 0:07:39,000
take a moment to acknowledge them.

180
0:07:39.908,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Take a moment to say thank you.

181
0:07:44.5,000 --> 0:07:47,000
(Applause)

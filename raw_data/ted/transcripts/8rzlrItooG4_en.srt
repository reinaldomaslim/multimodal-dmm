1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
The maxim, "Know thyself" has been around since the ancient Greeks.

2
0:00:20.263,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Some attribute this golden world knowledge to Plato, others to Pythagoras.

3
0:00:24.488,000 --> 0:00:27,000
But the truth is it doesn't really matter which sage said it first,

4
0:00:27.688,000 --> 0:00:29,000
because it's still sage advice, even today.

5
0:00:32.031,000 --> 0:00:33,000
"Know thyself."

6
0:00:33.515,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It's pithy almost to the point of being meaningless,

7
0:00:37.469,000 --> 0:00:39,000
but it rings familiar and true, doesn't it?

8
0:00:41.155,000 --> 0:00:42,000
"Know thyself."

9
0:00:44.094,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I understand this timeless dictum as a statement about the problems,

10
0:00:47.433,000 --> 0:00:49,000
or more exactly, the confusions, of consciousness.

11
0:00:50.71,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I've always been fascinated with knowing the self.

12
0:00:53.096,000 --> 0:00:55,000
This fascination led me to submerge myself in art,

13
0:00:55.627,000 --> 0:00:58,000
study neuroscience, and later, to become a psychotherapist.

14
0:00:59.108,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Today I combine all my passions as the CEO of InteraXon,

15
0:01:02.808,000 --> 0:01:04,000
a thought-controlled computing company.

16
0:01:05.224,000 --> 0:01:1,000
My goal, quite simply, is to help people become more in tune with themselves.

17
0:01:10.566,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I take it from this little dictum, "Know thyself."

18
0:01:14.384,000 --> 0:01:15,000
If you think about it,

19
0:01:15.891,000 --> 0:01:19,000
this imperative is kind of the defining characteristic of our species, isn't it?

20
0:01:21.118,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I mean, it's self-awareness

21
0:01:22.784,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that separates Homo sapiens from earlier instances of our mankind.

22
0:01:27.926,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Today we're often too busy

23
0:01:30.012,000 --> 0:01:34,000
tending to our iPhones and iPods to really stop and get to know ourselves.

24
0:01:35.197,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Under the deluge of minute-to-minute text conversations,

25
0:01:37.848,000 --> 0:01:4,000
e-mails, relentless exchange of media channels

26
0:01:40.932,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and passwords and apps and reminders and Tweets and tags,

27
0:01:43.757,000 --> 0:01:46,000
we lose sight of what all this fuss is supposed to be about in the first place:

28
0:01:47.507,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Ourselves.

29
0:01:49.146,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Much of the time we're transfixed

30
0:01:51.222,000 --> 0:01:54,000
by all of the ways we can reflect ourselves out into the world.

31
0:01:54.538,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And we can barely find the time to reflect deeply back in on our own selves.

32
0:02:00.816,000 --> 0:02:02,000
We've cluttered ourselves up with all this.

33
0:02:03.399,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And we feel like we have to get far, far away to a secluded retreat,

34
0:02:06.854,000 --> 0:02:07,000
leaving it all behind.

35
0:02:08.328,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So we go far away to the top of a mountain,

36
0:02:11.46,000 --> 0:02:13,000
assuming that perching ourselves on a piece

37
0:02:13.514,000 --> 0:02:17,000
is bound to give us the respite we need to sort the clutter, the chaotic everyday,

38
0:02:18.027,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and find ourselves again.

39
0:02:20.406,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But on that mountain where we gain that beautiful peace of mind,

40
0:02:25.399,000 --> 0:02:26,000
what are we really achieving?

41
0:02:27.544,000 --> 0:02:3,000
It's really only a successful escape.

42
0:02:31.728,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Think of the term we use, "Retreat."

43
0:02:33.572,000 --> 0:02:35,000
This is the term that armies use when they've lost a battle.

44
0:02:36.417,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It means we've got to get out of here.

45
0:02:38.27,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Is this how we feel about the pressures of our world,

46
0:02:40.789,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that in order to get inside ourselves,

47
0:02:42.807,000 --> 0:02:43,000
you have to run for the hills?

48
0:02:44.875,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And the problem with escaping your day-to-day life

49
0:02:48.115,000 --> 0:02:5,000
is that you have to come home, eventually.

50
0:02:51.751,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So when you think about it,

51
0:02:53.188,000 --> 0:02:57,000
we're almost like a tourist visiting ourselves over there.

52
0:02:57.666,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And eventually, that vacation's got to come to an end.

53
0:03:00.835,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So my question to you is,

54
0:03:03.608,000 --> 0:03:07,000
can we find ways to know ourselves without the escape?

55
0:03:08.441,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Can we redefine our relationship with the technologized world

56
0:03:12.026,000 --> 0:03:15,000
in order to have the heightened sense of self-awareness that we seek?

57
0:03:15.698,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Can we live here and now in our wired web

58
0:03:19.198,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and still follow those ancient instructions, "Know thyself?"

59
0:03:25.32,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I say the answer is yes.

60
0:03:26.95,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And I'm here today to share a new way

61
0:03:29.02,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that we're working with technology to this end,

62
0:03:31.454,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to get familiar with our inner self like never before --

63
0:03:34.933,000 --> 0:03:38,000
humanizing technology and furthering that age-old quest of ours

64
0:03:39.45,000 --> 0:03:4,000
to more fully know the self.

65
0:03:41.943,000 --> 0:03:44,000
It's called thought-controlled computing.

66
0:03:48.101,000 --> 0:03:49,000
You may or may not have noticed

67
0:03:49.632,000 --> 0:03:51,000
that I'm wearing a tiny electrode on my forehead.

68
0:03:51.965,000 --> 0:03:52,000
This is actually a brainwave sensor

69
0:03:53.66,000 --> 0:03:55,000
that's reading the electrical activity of my brain

70
0:03:56.04,000 --> 0:03:57,000
as I give this talk.

71
0:03:57.731,000 --> 0:04:,000
These brainwaves are being analyzed and we can see them as a graph.

72
0:04:01.265,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Let me show you what it looks like.

73
0:04:04.127,000 --> 0:04:06,000
That blue line there is my brainwave.

74
0:04:06.762,000 --> 0:04:1,000
It's the direct signal being recorded from my head, rendered in real time.

75
0:04:10.921,000 --> 0:04:13,000
The green and red bars show that same signal displayed by frequency,

76
0:04:14.356,000 --> 0:04:15,000
with lower frequencies here

77
0:04:16.094,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and higher frequencies up here.

78
0:04:18.25,000 --> 0:04:21,000
You're actually looking inside my head as I speak.

79
0:04:22.965,000 --> 0:04:25,000
These graphs are compelling, they're undulating,

80
0:04:25.989,000 --> 0:04:28,000
but from a human's perspective, they're actually not very useful.

81
0:04:30.069,000 --> 0:04:31,000
That's why we've spent a lot of time

82
0:04:32.07,000 --> 0:04:35,000
thinking about how to make this data meaningful to the people who use it.

83
0:04:35.871,000 --> 0:04:36,000
For instance,

84
0:04:37.409,000 --> 0:04:4,000
what if I could use this data to find out how relaxed I am at any moment?

85
0:04:41.388,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Or what if I can take that information

86
0:04:43.233,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and put it into an organic shape up on the screen?

87
0:04:46.921,000 --> 0:04:47,000
The shape on the right over here

88
0:04:48.797,000 --> 0:04:5,000
has become an indicator of what's going on in my head.

89
0:04:51.498,000 --> 0:04:52,000
The more relaxed I am,

90
0:04:53.016,000 --> 0:04:55,000
the more the energy's going to fall through it.

91
0:04:55.502,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I may also be interested in knowing how focused I am,

92
0:04:58.38,000 --> 0:05:01,000
so I can put my level of attention into the circuit board on the other side.

93
0:05:02.162,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And the more focused my brain is,

94
0:05:03.801,000 --> 0:05:05,000
the more the circuit board is going to surge with energy.

95
0:05:06.706,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Ordinarily, I would have no way of knowing how focused or relaxed I was

96
0:05:10.154,000 --> 0:05:11,000
in any tangible way.

97
0:05:12.856,000 --> 0:05:14,000
As we know, our feelings about how we're feeling

98
0:05:15.139,000 --> 0:05:16,000
are notoriously unreliable.

99
0:05:16.992,000 --> 0:05:18,000
We've all had stress creep up on us without even noticing it

100
0:05:19.849,000 --> 0:05:21,000
until we lost it on someone who didn't deserve it,

101
0:05:22.289,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and then we realize that we probably should have checked in with ourselves

102
0:05:25.887,000 --> 0:05:26,000
a little earlier.

103
0:05:27.064,000 --> 0:05:3,000
This new awareness opens up vast possibilities

104
0:05:30.206,000 --> 0:05:33,000
for applications that help improve our lives and ourselves.

105
0:05:34.459,000 --> 0:05:36,000
We're trying to create technology that uses the insights

106
0:05:37.168,000 --> 0:05:39,000
to make our work more efficient, our breaks more relaxing

107
0:05:39.875,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and our connections deeper and more fulfilling than ever.

108
0:05:43.851,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I'm going to share some of these visions with you in a bit,

109
0:05:46.648,000 --> 0:05:48,000
but first I want to take a look at how we got here.

110
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
By the way, feel free to check in on my head at any time.

111
0:05:52.728,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Laughter)

112
0:05:54.729,000 --> 0:05:55,000
My team at InteraXon and I

113
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
have been developing thought-controlled application for almost a decade now.

114
0:06:00.073,000 --> 0:06:01,000
In the first phase of development,

115
0:06:01.717,000 --> 0:06:04,000
we were really enthused by all the things we could control with our mind.

116
0:06:05.177,000 --> 0:06:09,000
We were making things activate, light up and work just by thinking.

117
0:06:09.999,000 --> 0:06:12,000
We were transcending the space between the mind and the device.

118
0:06:14.258,000 --> 0:06:16,000
We brought to life a vast array of prototypes and products

119
0:06:17.033,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that you could control with your mind,

120
0:06:19.078,000 --> 0:06:2,000
like thought-controlled home appliances

121
0:06:21.018,000 --> 0:06:24,000
or slot-car games or video games or a levitating chair.

122
0:06:25.504,000 --> 0:06:28,000
We created technology and applications that engaged people's imaginations,

123
0:06:29.157,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and it was really exciting.

124
0:06:30.642,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And then we were asked to do something really big for the Olympics.

125
0:06:35.099,000 --> 0:06:37,000
We were invited to create a massive installation

126
0:06:37.386,000 --> 0:06:38,000
at the Vancouver 2010 winter Olympics,

127
0:06:39.248,000 --> 0:06:4,000
were used in Vancouver,

128
0:06:40.803,000 --> 0:06:42,000
got to control the lighting on the CN Tower,

129
0:06:43.544,000 --> 0:06:45,000
the Canadian Parliament buildings and Niagara Falls

130
0:06:46.483,000 --> 0:06:49,000
from all the way across the country using their minds.

131
0:06:50.564,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Over 17 days at the Olympics, 7,000 visitors from all over the world

132
0:06:53.807,000 --> 0:06:55,000
actually got to individually control the light

133
0:06:55.996,000 --> 0:06:57,000
from the CN Tower, parliament and Niagara in real time

134
0:06:58.651,000 --> 0:07:01,000
with their minds from across the country, 3,000 km away.

135
0:07:01.696,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So controlling stuff with your mind is pretty cool.

136
0:07:06.07,000 --> 0:07:09,000
But we're always interested in multitiered levels of human interaction.

137
0:07:09.556,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And so we began looking into inventing thought-controlled applications

138
0:07:12.981,000 --> 0:07:14,000
in a more complex frame than just control.

139
0:07:15.742,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And that was responsiveness.

140
0:07:19.001,000 --> 0:07:2,000
We realized that we had a system

141
0:07:20.596,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that allowed technology to know something about you.

142
0:07:23.226,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And it could join into the relationship with you.

143
0:07:26.585,000 --> 0:07:28,000
We created the responsive room

144
0:07:28.733,000 --> 0:07:3,000
where the lights, music and blinds adjusted to your state.

145
0:07:32.1,000 --> 0:07:35,000
They followed these little shifts in your mental activity.

146
0:07:35.127,000 --> 0:07:37,000
So as you settled into relaxation at the end of a hard day,

147
0:07:37.945,000 --> 0:07:38,000
on the couch in our office,

148
0:07:39.3,000 --> 0:07:41,000
the music would mellow with you.

149
0:07:41.48,000 --> 0:07:43,000
When you read, the desk lamp would get brighter.

150
0:07:44.11,000 --> 0:07:48,000
If you nod off, the system would know, dimming to darkness as you do.

151
0:07:49.885,000 --> 0:07:52,000
We then realized that if technology could know something about you

152
0:07:53.584,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and use it to help you,

153
0:07:54.814,000 --> 0:07:56,000
there's an even more valuable application than that.

154
0:07:57.658,000 --> 0:08:,000
That you could know something about yourself.

155
0:08:01.484,000 --> 0:08:04,000
We could know sides of ourselves that were all but invisible

156
0:08:04.686,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and come to see things that were previously hidden.

157
0:08:08.093,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Let me show you an example of what I'm talking about here.

158
0:08:10.863,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Here's an application that I created for the iPad.

159
0:08:13.43,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So the goal of the original game Zen Bound is to wrap a rope around a wooden form.

160
0:08:18.693,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So you use it with your headset.

161
0:08:20.261,000 --> 0:08:22,000
The headset connects wirelessly to an iPad or a smartphone.

162
0:08:23.458,000 --> 0:08:27,000
In that headset, you have fabric sensors on your forehead and above the ear.

163
0:08:27.812,000 --> 0:08:28,000
In the original Zen Bound game,

164
0:08:29.358,000 --> 0:08:31,000
you play it by scrolling your fingers over the pad.

165
0:08:32.744,000 --> 0:08:33,000
In the game that we created, of course,

166
0:08:34.71,000 --> 0:08:38,000
you control the wooden form that's on the screen there with your mind.

167
0:08:39.266,000 --> 0:08:41,000
As you focus on the wooden form,

168
0:08:41.509,000 --> 0:08:42,000
it rotates.

169
0:08:42.728,000 --> 0:08:45,000
The more you focus, the faster the rotation.

170
0:08:46.118,000 --> 0:08:47,000
This is for real.

171
0:08:47.792,000 --> 0:08:48,000
This is not a fake.

172
0:08:49.858,000 --> 0:08:5,000
What's really interesting to me though

173
0:08:51.722,000 --> 0:08:54,000
is at the end of the game, you get stats and feedback about how you did.

174
0:08:55.616,000 --> 0:08:59,000
You have graphs and charts that tell you how your brain was doing --

175
0:08:59.729,000 --> 0:09:02,000
not just how much rope you used or what your high score is,

176
0:09:02.805,000 --> 0:09:05,000
but what was going on inside of your mind.

177
0:09:07.058,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And this is valuable feedback

178
0:09:08.951,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that we can use to understand what's going on inside of ourselves.

179
0:09:15.294,000 --> 0:09:18,000
I like to call this "intra-active."

180
0:09:19.35,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Normally, we think about technology as interactive.

181
0:09:23.051,000 --> 0:09:25,000
This technology is intra-active.

182
0:09:26.822,000 --> 0:09:29,000
It understands what's inside of you

183
0:09:30.435,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and builds a sort of responsive relationship

184
0:09:32.824,000 --> 0:09:33,000
between you and your technology

185
0:09:34.845,000 --> 0:09:37,000
so that you can use this information to move you forward.

186
0:09:39.232,000 --> 0:09:43,000
So you can use this information to understand you in a responsive loop.

187
0:09:44.154,000 --> 0:09:45,000
At InteraXon --

188
0:09:47.672,000 --> 0:09:52,000
intra-active technology is one of our really defining mandates.

189
0:09:53.928,000 --> 0:09:57,000
It's how we understand the world inside and reflect it outside

190
0:09:58.852,000 --> 0:10:,000
into this tight loop.

191
0:10:01.925,000 --> 0:10:04,000
For example, thought-controlled computing

192
0:10:05.078,000 --> 0:10:08,000
can teach children with ADD how to improve their focus.

193
0:10:08.686,000 --> 0:10:12,000
With ADD, children have a low proportion of beta waves for focus states

194
0:10:13.025,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and a high proportion of theta states.

195
0:10:15.082,000 --> 0:10:18,000
So you can create applications that reward focused brain states.

196
0:10:18.292,000 --> 0:10:21,000
So you can imagine kids playing video games with their brain waves

197
0:10:21.521,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and improving their ADD symptoms as they do it.

198
0:10:24.014,000 --> 0:10:25,000
This can be as effective as Ritalin.

199
0:10:26.845,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Perhaps even more importantly,

200
0:10:28.71,000 --> 0:10:3,000
thought-controlled computing can give children with ADD

201
0:10:31.311,000 --> 0:10:33,000
insights into their own fluctuating mental states,

202
0:10:34.238,000 --> 0:10:37,000
so they can better understand themselves and their learning needs.

203
0:10:37.894,000 --> 0:10:4,000
The way these children will be able to use their new awareness to improve themselves

204
0:10:41.894,000 --> 0:10:43,000
will upend many of the damaging and widespread social stigmas

205
0:10:44.842,000 --> 0:10:47,000
that people who are diagnosed as different are challenged with.

206
0:10:49.174,000 --> 0:10:5,000
We can peer inside our heads

207
0:10:50.554,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and interact with what was once locked away from us,

208
0:10:53.361,000 --> 0:10:55,000
what once mystified and separated us.

209
0:10:57.602,000 --> 0:11:,000
Brainwave technology can understand us, anticipate our emotions

210
0:11:00.916,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and find the best solutions for our needs.

211
0:11:02.953,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Imagine this collected awareness of the individual

212
0:11:05.723,000 --> 0:11:07,000
computed and reflected across an entire lifespan.

213
0:11:08.718,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Imagine the insights that you can gain from this kind of second sight.

214
0:11:12.741,000 --> 0:11:14,000
It would be like plugging into your own personal Google.

215
0:11:16.056,000 --> 0:11:17,000
On the subject of Google,

216
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
today you can search and tag images

217
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
based on the thoughts and feelings you had while you watched them.

218
0:11:22.656,000 --> 0:11:24,000
You can tag pictures of baby animals as happy,

219
0:11:25.424,000 --> 0:11:27,000
or whatever baby animals are to you,

220
0:11:27.918,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and then you can search that database, navigating with your feelings,

221
0:11:31.762,000 --> 0:11:33,000
rather than the keywords that just hint at them.

222
0:11:34.829,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Or you could tag Facebook photos

223
0:11:37.112,000 --> 0:11:41,000
with the emotions that you had associated with those memories

224
0:11:41.728,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and then instantly prioritize the streams that catch your attention,

225
0:11:46.154,000 --> 0:11:47,000
just like this.

226
0:11:48.707,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Humanizing technology is about taking what's already natural

227
0:11:51.817,000 --> 0:11:52,000
about the human-tech experience

228
0:11:53.441,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and building technology seamlessly in tandem with it.

229
0:11:56.851,000 --> 0:11:58,000
As it aligns with our human behaviors,

230
0:11:59.184,000 --> 0:12:02,000
it can allow us to make better sense of what we do

231
0:12:02.384,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and, more importantly, why.

232
0:12:05.126,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Creating a big picture out of all the important little details

233
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
that make up who we are.

234
0:12:11.174,000 --> 0:12:14,000
With humanized technology we can monitor the quality of your sleep cycles.

235
0:12:15.263,000 --> 0:12:19,000
When our productivity starts to slacken, we can go back to that data

236
0:12:19.539,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and see how we can make more effective balance between work and play.

237
0:12:24.192,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Do you know what causes fatigue in you or what brings out your energetic self,

238
0:12:28.149,000 --> 0:12:29,000
what triggers cause you to be depressed

239
0:12:30.091,000 --> 0:12:33,000
or what fun things are going to bring you out of that funk?

240
0:12:35.017,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Imagine if you had access to data

241
0:12:36.687,000 --> 0:12:39,000
that allowed you to rank on a scale of overall happiness

242
0:12:39.908,000 --> 0:12:41,000
which people in your life made you the happiest,

243
0:12:43.487,000 --> 0:12:45,000
or what activities brought you joy.

244
0:12:45.907,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Would you make more time for those people? Would you prioritize?

245
0:12:48.986,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Would you get a divorce?

246
0:12:50.285,000 --> 0:12:51,000
(Laughter)

247
0:12:51.694,000 --> 0:12:53,000
What thought-controlled computing can allow you to do

248
0:12:54.207,000 --> 0:12:56,000
is build colorful layered pictures of our lives.

249
0:12:57.023,000 --> 0:13:,000
And with this, we can get the skinny on our psychological happenings

250
0:13:00.533,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and build a story of our behaviors over time.

251
0:13:03.379,000 --> 0:13:06,000
We can begin to see the underlying narratives that propel us forward

252
0:13:06.622,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and tell us about what's going on.

253
0:13:10.033,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And from this, we can learn how to change the plot, the outcome

254
0:13:14.585,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and the character of our personal stories.

255
0:13:18.826,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Two millennia ago, those Greeks had some powerful insights.

256
0:13:23.682,000 --> 0:13:25,000
They knew that a fundamental piece falls into place

257
0:13:26.126,000 --> 0:13:28,000
when you start to live out their little phrase,

258
0:13:28.889,000 --> 0:13:3,000
when you come into contact with yourself.

259
0:13:31.681,000 --> 0:13:34,000
They understood the power of human narrative

260
0:13:35.056,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and the value that we place on humans as changing, evolving and growing.

261
0:13:39.608,000 --> 0:13:41,000
But they understood something more fundamental --

262
0:13:43.085,000 --> 0:13:45,000
the sheer joy in discovery,

263
0:13:46.366,000 --> 0:13:48,000
the delight and fascination that we get from the world

264
0:13:48.919,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and being ourselves in it;

265
0:13:51.118,000 --> 0:13:55,000
the richness that we get from seeing, feeling and knowing the lives that we are.

266
0:13:56.787,000 --> 0:13:57,000
My mom's an artist,

267
0:13:57.978,000 --> 0:14:,000
and as a child, I'd often see her bring things to life with the stroke of a brush.

268
0:14:01.86,000 --> 0:14:03,000
One moment, it was all white space, pure possibility.

269
0:14:04.492,000 --> 0:14:07,000
The next, it was alive with her colorful ideas and expressions.

270
0:14:08.717,000 --> 0:14:12,000
As I sat easel-side, watching her transform canvas after canvas,

271
0:14:14.413,000 --> 0:14:16,000
I learned that you could create your own world.

272
0:14:18.093,000 --> 0:14:2,000
I learned that our own inner worlds --

273
0:14:20.321,000 --> 0:14:23,000
our ideas, emotions and imaginations --

274
0:14:23.485,000 --> 0:14:25,000
were, in fact, not bound by our brains and bodies.

275
0:14:26.768,000 --> 0:14:29,000
If you could think it, if you could discover it,

276
0:14:30.135,000 --> 0:14:31,000
you could bring it to life.

277
0:14:33.097,000 --> 0:14:35,000
To me, thought-controlled computing

278
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
is as simple and powerful as a paintbrush --

279
0:14:37.687,000 --> 0:14:4,000
one more tool to unlock and enliven the hidden worlds within us.

280
0:14:42.223,000 --> 0:14:46,000
I look forward to the day that I can sit beside you, easel-side,

281
0:14:47.05,000 --> 0:14:51,000
watching the world that we can create with our new toolboxes

282
0:14:51.189,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and the discoveries that we can make about ourselves.

283
0:14:55.752,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Thank you.

284
0:14:56.983,000 --> 0:14:57,000
(Applause)

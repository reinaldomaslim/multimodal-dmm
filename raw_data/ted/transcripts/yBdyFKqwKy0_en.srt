1
0:00:12.856,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I am in search of another planet in the universe where life exists.

2
0:00:18.426,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I can't see this planet with my naked eyes

3
0:00:21.412,000 --> 0:00:23,000
or even with the most powerful telescopes

4
0:00:23.722,000 --> 0:00:24,000
we currently possess.

5
0:00:25.787,000 --> 0:00:27,000
But I know that it's there.

6
0:00:27.875,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And understanding contradictions that occur in nature

7
0:00:31.042,000 --> 0:00:32,000
will help us find it.

8
0:00:33.379,000 --> 0:00:34,000
On our planet,

9
0:00:34.554,000 --> 0:00:35,000
where there's water, there's life.

10
0:00:36.892,000 --> 0:00:38,000
So we look for planets that orbit at just the right distance

11
0:00:39.85,000 --> 0:00:4,000
from their stars.

12
0:00:42.418,000 --> 0:00:43,000
At this distance,

13
0:00:43.593,000 --> 0:00:46,000
shown in blue on this diagram for stars of different temperatures,

14
0:00:47.097,000 --> 0:00:5,000
planets could be warm enough for water to flow on their surfaces

15
0:00:50.975,000 --> 0:00:51,000
as lakes and oceans

16
0:00:52.397,000 --> 0:00:53,000
where life might reside.

17
0:00:54.787,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Some astronomers focus their time and energy on finding planets

18
0:00:58.525,000 --> 0:01:,000
at these distances from their stars.

19
0:01:00.99,000 --> 0:01:02,000
What I do picks up where their job ends.

20
0:01:03.869,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I model the possible climates of exoplanets.

21
0:01:07.353,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And here's why that's important:

22
0:01:09.203,000 --> 0:01:12,000
there are many factors besides distance from its star

23
0:01:12.717,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that control whether a planet can support life.

24
0:01:16.297,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Take the planet Venus.

25
0:01:18.646,000 --> 0:01:21,000
It's named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty,

26
0:01:22.361,000 --> 0:01:25,000
because of its benign, ethereal appearance in the sky.

27
0:01:26.487,000 --> 0:01:29,000
But spacecraft measurements revealed a different story.

28
0:01:30.08,000 --> 0:01:33,000
The surface temperature is close to 900 degrees Fahrenheit,

29
0:01:34.073,000 --> 0:01:35,000
500 Celsius.

30
0:01:36.151,000 --> 0:01:38,000
That's hot enough to melt lead.

31
0:01:39.115,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Its thick atmosphere, not its distance from the sun, is the reason.

32
0:01:42.977,000 --> 0:01:45,000
It causes a greenhouse effect on steroids,

33
0:01:46.104,000 --> 0:01:49,000
trapping heat from the sun and scorching the planet's surface.

34
0:01:50.181,000 --> 0:01:54,000
The reality totally contradicted initial perceptions of this planet.

35
0:01:55.728,000 --> 0:01:57,000
From these lessons from our own solar system,

36
0:01:58.373,000 --> 0:02:,000
we've learned that a planet's atmosphere

37
0:02:00.413,000 --> 0:02:03,000
is crucial to its climate and potential to host life.

38
0:02:04.967,000 --> 0:02:06,000
We don't know what the atmospheres of these planets are like

39
0:02:07.906,000 --> 0:02:11,000
because the planets are so small and dim compared to their stars

40
0:02:12.298,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and so far away from us.

41
0:02:14.5,000 --> 0:02:18,000
For example, one of the closest planets that could support surface water --

42
0:02:18.815,000 --> 0:02:21,000
it's called Gliese 667 Cc --

43
0:02:22.196,000 --> 0:02:25,000
such a glamorous name, right, nice phone number for a name --

44
0:02:26.156,000 --> 0:02:28,000
it's 23 light years away.

45
0:02:29.091,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So that's more than 100 trillion miles.

46
0:02:32.686,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Trying to measure the atmospheric composition

47
0:02:35.023,000 --> 0:02:39,000
of an exoplanet passing in front of its host star is hard.

48
0:02:39.444,000 --> 0:02:4,000
It's like trying to see a fruit fly

49
0:02:41.348,000 --> 0:02:43,000
passing in front of a car's headlight.

50
0:02:44.126,000 --> 0:02:47,000
OK, now imagine that car is 100 trillion miles away,

51
0:02:47.849,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and you want to know the precise color of that fly.

52
0:02:52.618,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So I use computer models

53
0:02:54.399,000 --> 0:02:57,000
to calculate the kind of atmosphere a planet would need

54
0:02:57.526,000 --> 0:02:59,000
to have a suitable climate for water and life.

55
0:03:01.439,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Here's an artist's concept of the planet Kepler-62f,

56
0:03:05.575,000 --> 0:03:06,000
with the Earth for reference.

57
0:03:07.507,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It's 1,200 light years away,

58
0:03:09.571,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and just 40 percent larger than Earth.

59
0:03:12.313,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Our NSF-funded work found that it could be warm enough for open water

60
0:03:16.385,000 --> 0:03:2,000
from many types of atmospheres and orientations of its orbit.

61
0:03:20.518,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So I'd like future telescopes to follow up on this planet

62
0:03:23.675,000 --> 0:03:24,000
to look for signs of life.

63
0:03:26.476,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Ice on a planet's surface is also important for climate.

64
0:03:29.889,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Ice absorbs longer, redder wavelengths of light,

65
0:03:33.108,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and reflects shorter, bluer light.

66
0:03:35.87,000 --> 0:03:37,000
That's why the iceberg in this photo looks so blue.

67
0:03:39.092,000 --> 0:03:42,000
The redder light from the sun is absorbed on its way through the ice.

68
0:03:42.613,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Only the blue light makes it all the way to the bottom.

69
0:03:45.947,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Then it gets reflected back to up to our eyes

70
0:03:48.363,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and we see blue ice.

71
0:03:50.59,000 --> 0:03:52,000
My models show that planets orbiting cooler stars

72
0:03:53.588,000 --> 0:03:56,000
could actually be warmer than planets orbiting hotter stars.

73
0:03:56.78,000 --> 0:03:57,000
There's another contradiction --

74
0:03:58.343,000 --> 0:04:01,000
that ice absorbs the longer wavelength light from cooler stars,

75
0:04:02.141,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and that light, that energy, heats the ice.

76
0:04:06.622,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Using climate models to explore

77
0:04:09.006,000 --> 0:04:12,000
how these contradictions can affect planetary climate

78
0:04:12.135,000 --> 0:04:15,000
is vital to the search for life elsewhere.

79
0:04:16.128,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And it's no surprise that this is my specialty.

80
0:04:19.715,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I'm an African-American female astronomer

81
0:04:22.524,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and a classically trained actor

82
0:04:24.66,000 --> 0:04:27,000
who loves to wear makeup and read fashion magazines,

83
0:04:28.519,000 --> 0:04:32,000
so I am uniquely positioned to appreciate contradictions in nature --

84
0:04:33.376,000 --> 0:04:34,000
(Laughter)

85
0:04:34.512,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Applause)

86
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:42,000
... and how they can inform our search for the next planet where life exists.

87
0:04:42.645,000 --> 0:04:44,000
My organization, Rising Stargirls,

88
0:04:45.177,000 --> 0:04:48,000
teaches astronomy to middle-school girls of color,

89
0:04:48.629,000 --> 0:04:51,000
using theater, writing and visual art.

90
0:04:52.697,000 --> 0:04:55,000
That's another contradiction -- science and art don't often go together,

91
0:04:56.698,000 --> 0:04:59,000
but interweaving them can help these girls bring their whole selves

92
0:05:00.524,000 --> 0:05:01,000
to what they learn,

93
0:05:01.747,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and maybe one day join the ranks of astronomers

94
0:05:05.211,000 --> 0:05:06,000
who are full of contradictions,

95
0:05:06.989,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and use their backgrounds to discover, once and for all,

96
0:05:10.163,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that we are truly not alone in the universe.

97
0:05:14.433,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Thank you.

98
0:05:15.608,000 --> 0:05:23,000
(Applause)

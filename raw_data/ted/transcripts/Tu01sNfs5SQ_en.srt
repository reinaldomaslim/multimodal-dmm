1
0:00:12.549,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I am a translator.

2
0:00:14.514,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I translate from biology into mathematics

3
0:00:17.729,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and vice versa.

4
0:00:19.588,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I write mathematical models

5
0:00:21.402,000 --> 0:00:23,000
which, in my case, are systems of differential equations,

6
0:00:24.273,000 --> 0:00:25,000
to describe biological mechanisms,

7
0:00:26.244,000 --> 0:00:27,000
such as cell growth.

8
0:00:28.122,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Essentially, it works like this.

9
0:00:30.573,000 --> 0:00:32,000
First, I identify the key elements

10
0:00:33.066,000 --> 0:00:35,000
that I believe may be driving behavior over time

11
0:00:35.867,000 --> 0:00:36,000
of a particular mechanism.

12
0:00:38.23,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Then, I formulate assumptions

13
0:00:40.145,000 --> 0:00:42,000
about how these elements interact with each other

14
0:00:43.055,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and with their environment.

15
0:00:44.916,000 --> 0:00:45,000
It may look something like this.

16
0:00:46.712,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Then, I translate these assumptions into equations,

17
0:00:50.61,000 --> 0:00:51,000
which may look something like this.

18
0:00:53.434,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Finally, I analyze my equations

19
0:00:55.348,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and translate the results back into the language of biology.

20
0:01:00.156,000 --> 0:01:02,000
A key aspect of mathematical modeling

21
0:01:02.6,000 --> 0:01:05,000
is that we, as modelers, do not think about what things are;

22
0:01:06.532,000 --> 0:01:07,000
we think about what they do.

23
0:01:08.411,000 --> 0:01:1,000
We think about relationships between individuals,

24
0:01:10.924,000 --> 0:01:12,000
whether they be cells, animals or people,

25
0:01:13.834,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and how they interact with each other and with their environment.

26
0:01:17.639,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Let me give you an example.

27
0:01:19.719,000 --> 0:01:22,000
What do foxes and immune cells have in common?

28
0:01:24.793,000 --> 0:01:25,000
They're both predators,

29
0:01:26.744,000 --> 0:01:28,000
except foxes feed on rabbits,

30
0:01:29.491,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and immune cells feed on invaders, such as cancer cells.

31
0:01:33.273,000 --> 0:01:35,000
But from a mathematical point of view,

32
0:01:35.642,000 --> 0:01:39,000
a qualitatively same system of predator-prey type equations

33
0:01:39.822,000 --> 0:01:42,000
will describe interactions between foxes and rabbits

34
0:01:43.091,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and cancer and immune cells.

35
0:01:45.609,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Predator-prey type systems have been studied extensively

36
0:01:48.341,000 --> 0:01:49,000
in scientific literature,

37
0:01:49.634,000 --> 0:01:51,000
describing interactions of two populations,

38
0:01:52.036,000 --> 0:01:54,000
where survival of one depends on consuming the other.

39
0:01:55.485,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And these same equations provide a framework

40
0:01:58.129,000 --> 0:02:,000
for understanding cancer-immune interactions,

41
0:02:00.464,000 --> 0:02:01,000
where cancer is the prey,

42
0:02:02.329,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and the immune system is the predator.

43
0:02:04.725,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And the prey employs all sorts of tricks to prevent the predator from killing it,

44
0:02:08.781,000 --> 0:02:09,000
ranging from camouflaging itself

45
0:02:10.625,000 --> 0:02:11,000
to stealing the predator's food.

46
0:02:13.352,000 --> 0:02:15,000
This can have some very interesting implications.

47
0:02:15.938,000 --> 0:02:19,000
For example, despite enormous successes in the field of immunotherapy,

48
0:02:20.784,000 --> 0:02:22,000
there still remains somewhat limited efficacy

49
0:02:23.269,000 --> 0:02:24,000
when it comes solid tumors.

50
0:02:25.423,000 --> 0:02:27,000
But if you think about it ecologically,

51
0:02:28.006,000 --> 0:02:3,000
both cancer and immune cells --

52
0:02:30.12,000 --> 0:02:31,000
the prey and the predator --

53
0:02:31.744,000 --> 0:02:34,000
require nutrients such as glucose to survive.

54
0:02:35.358,000 --> 0:02:39,000
If cancer cells outcompete the immune cells for shared nutrients

55
0:02:40.171,000 --> 0:02:41,000
in the tumor microenvironment,

56
0:02:41.988,000 --> 0:02:44,000
then the immune cells will physically not be able to do their job.

57
0:02:46.291,000 --> 0:02:48,000
This predator-prey-shared resource type model

58
0:02:49.183,000 --> 0:02:51,000
is something I've worked on in my own research.

59
0:02:51.504,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And it was recently shown experimentally

60
0:02:54.252,000 --> 0:02:58,000
that restoring the metabolic balance in the tumor microenvironment --

61
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
that is, making sure immune cells get their food --

62
0:03:01.885,000 --> 0:03:06,000
can give them, the predators, back their edge in fighting cancer, the prey.

63
0:03:08.44,000 --> 0:03:1,000
This means that if you abstract a bit,

64
0:03:10.803,000 --> 0:03:12,000
you can think about cancer itself as an ecosystem,

65
0:03:13.782,000 --> 0:03:17,000
where heterogeneous populations of cells compete and cooperate

66
0:03:18.093,000 --> 0:03:2,000
for space and nutrients,

67
0:03:20.134,000 --> 0:03:22,000
interact with predators -- the immune system --

68
0:03:22.83,000 --> 0:03:24,000
migrate -- metastases --

69
0:03:25.095,000 --> 0:03:27,000
all within the ecosystem of the human body.

70
0:03:28.221,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And what do we know about most ecosystems from conservation biology?

71
0:03:32.643,000 --> 0:03:34,000
That one of the best ways to extinguish species

72
0:03:35.519,000 --> 0:03:36,000
is not to target them directly

73
0:03:37.495,000 --> 0:03:39,000
but to target their environment.

74
0:03:40.88,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And so, once we have identified the key components

75
0:03:43.974,000 --> 0:03:44,000
of the tumor environment,

76
0:03:45.642,000 --> 0:03:46,000
we can propose hypotheses

77
0:03:47.614,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and simulate scenarios and therapeutic interventions

78
0:03:50.932,000 --> 0:03:53,000
all in a completely safe and affordable way

79
0:03:54.381,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and target different components of the microenvironment

80
0:03:57.774,000 --> 0:04:,000
in such a way as to kill the cancer without harming the host,

81
0:04:01.794,000 --> 0:04:02,000
such as me or you.

82
0:04:05.029,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And so while the immediate goal of my research

83
0:04:08.055,000 --> 0:04:1,000
is to advance research and innovation

84
0:04:10.345,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and to reduce its cost,

85
0:04:12.265,000 --> 0:04:14,000
the real intent, of course, is to save lives.

86
0:04:15.278,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And that's what I try to do

87
0:04:17.073,000 --> 0:04:19,000
through mathematical modeling applied to biology,

88
0:04:19.844,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and in particular, to the development of drugs.

89
0:04:22.895,000 --> 0:04:26,000
It's a field that until relatively recently has remained somewhat marginal,

90
0:04:26.975,000 --> 0:04:27,000
but it has matured.

91
0:04:28.451,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And there are now very well-developed mathematical methods,

92
0:04:31.624,000 --> 0:04:32,000
a lot of preprogrammed tools,

93
0:04:33.547,000 --> 0:04:34,000
including free ones,

94
0:04:35.067,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and an ever-increasing amount of computational power available to us.

95
0:04:40.718,000 --> 0:04:43,000
The power and beauty of mathematical modeling

96
0:04:44.141,000 --> 0:04:46,000
lies in the fact that it makes you formalize,

97
0:04:46.806,000 --> 0:04:48,000
in a very rigorous way,

98
0:04:48.917,000 --> 0:04:49,000
what we think we know.

99
0:04:50.904,000 --> 0:04:51,000
We make assumptions,

100
0:04:52.372,000 --> 0:04:53,000
translate them into equations,

101
0:04:53.964,000 --> 0:04:54,000
run simulations,

102
0:04:55.299,000 --> 0:04:56,000
all to answer the question:

103
0:04:57.096,000 --> 0:04:59,000
In a world where my assumptions are true,

104
0:04:59.366,000 --> 0:05:,000
what do I expect to see?

105
0:05:01.89,000 --> 0:05:03,000
It's a pretty simple conceptual framework.

106
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:06,000
It's all about asking the right questions.

107
0:05:06.603,000 --> 0:05:1,000
But it can unleash numerous opportunities for testing biological hypotheses.

108
0:05:11.696,000 --> 0:05:13,000
If our predictions match our observations,

109
0:05:14.32,000 --> 0:05:17,000
great! -- we got it right, so we can make further predictions

110
0:05:17.371,000 --> 0:05:19,000
by changing this or that aspect of the model.

111
0:05:20.733,000 --> 0:05:23,000
If, however, our predictions do not match our observations,

112
0:05:24.457,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that means that some of our assumptions are wrong,

113
0:05:27.066,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and so our understanding of the key mechanisms

114
0:05:29.523,000 --> 0:05:3,000
of underlying biology

115
0:05:30.986,000 --> 0:05:31,000
is still incomplete.

116
0:05:32.829,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Luckily, since this is a model,

117
0:05:35.215,000 --> 0:05:36,000
we control all the assumptions.

118
0:05:37.128,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So we can go through them, one by one,

119
0:05:39.292,000 --> 0:05:42,000
identifying which one or ones are causing the discrepancy.

120
0:05:43.637,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And then we can fill this newly identified gap in knowledge

121
0:05:47.017,000 --> 0:05:49,000
using both experimental and theoretical approaches.

122
0:05:50.699,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Of course, any ecosystem is extremely complex,

123
0:05:53.544,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and trying to describe all the moving parts is not only very difficult,

124
0:05:57.411,000 --> 0:05:58,000
but also not very informative.

125
0:05:59.518,000 --> 0:06:01,000
There's also the issue of timescales,

126
0:06:01.608,000 --> 0:06:04,000
because some processes take place on a scale of seconds, some minutes,

127
0:06:05.3,000 --> 0:06:06,000
some days, months and years.

128
0:06:07.272,000 --> 0:06:1,000
It may not always be possible to separate those out experimentally.

129
0:06:11.143,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And some things happen so quickly or so slowly

130
0:06:14.551,000 --> 0:06:16,000
that you may physically never be able to measure them.

131
0:06:17.295,000 --> 0:06:19,000
But as mathematicians,

132
0:06:19.607,000 --> 0:06:24,000
we have the power to zoom in on any subsystem in any timescale

133
0:06:25.276,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and simulate effects of interventions

134
0:06:27.424,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that take place in any timescale.

135
0:06:31.942,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Of course, this isn't the work of a modeler alone.

136
0:06:34.9,000 --> 0:06:37,000
It has to happen in close collaboration with biologists.

137
0:06:38.213,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And it does demand some capacity of translation

138
0:06:41.241,000 --> 0:06:42,000
on both sides.

139
0:06:43.55,000 --> 0:06:46,000
But starting with a theoretical formulation of a problem

140
0:06:47.362,000 --> 0:06:5,000
can unleash numerous opportunities for testing hypotheses

141
0:06:50.883,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and simulating scenarios and therapeutic interventions,

142
0:06:54.146,000 --> 0:06:56,000
all in a completely safe way.

143
0:06:56.977,000 --> 0:07:01,000
It can identify gaps in knowledge and logical inconsistencies

144
0:07:02.176,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and can help guide us as to where we should keep looking

145
0:07:05.039,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and where there may be a dead end.

146
0:07:07.632,000 --> 0:07:08,000
In other words:

147
0:07:08.903,000 --> 0:07:11,000
mathematical modeling can help us answer questions

148
0:07:12.421,000 --> 0:07:14,000
that directly affect people's health --

149
0:07:15.942,000 --> 0:07:17,000
that affect each person's health, actually --

150
0:07:18.67,000 --> 0:07:2,000
because mathematical modeling will be key

151
0:07:21.37,000 --> 0:07:22,000
to propelling personalized medicine.

152
0:07:24.112,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And it all comes down to asking the right question

153
0:07:27.711,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and translating it to the right equation ...

154
0:07:30.67,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and back.

155
0:07:32.533,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Thank you.

156
0:07:33.708,000 --> 0:07:36,000
(Applause)

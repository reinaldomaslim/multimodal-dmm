1
0:00:12.759,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So we all have our own biases.

2
0:00:15.133,000 --> 0:00:17,000
For example, some of us tend to think

3
0:00:17.808,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that it's very difficult to transform failing government systems.

4
0:00:21.871,000 --> 0:00:22,000
When we think of government systems,

5
0:00:23.642,000 --> 0:00:26,000
we tend to think that they're archaic, set in their ways,

6
0:00:27.257,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and perhaps, the leadership is just too bureaucratic

7
0:00:29.977,000 --> 0:00:3,000
to be able to change things.

8
0:00:32.097,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Well, today, I want to challenge that theory.

9
0:00:35.886,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I want to tell you a story of a very large government system

10
0:00:39.979,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that has not only put itself on the path of reform

11
0:00:43.447,000 --> 0:00:46,000
but has also shown fairly spectacular results

12
0:00:46.66,000 --> 0:00:47,000
in less than three years.

13
0:00:48.746,000 --> 0:00:52,000
This is what a classroom in a public school in India looks like.

14
0:00:53.05,000 --> 0:00:55,000
There are 1 million such schools in India.

15
0:00:55.878,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And even for me, who's lived in India all her life,

16
0:00:59.034,000 --> 0:01:02,000
walking into one of these schools is fairly heartbreaking.

17
0:01:03.106,000 --> 0:01:05,000
By the time kids are 11,

18
0:01:05.199,000 --> 0:01:09,000
50 percent of them have fallen so far behind in their education

19
0:01:09.255,000 --> 0:01:1,000
that they have no hope to recover.

20
0:01:11.606,000 --> 0:01:13,000
11-year-olds cannot do simple addition,

21
0:01:14.428,000 --> 0:01:16,000
they cannot construct a grammatically correct sentence.

22
0:01:17.779,000 --> 0:01:2,000
These are things that you and I would expect an 8-year-old

23
0:01:21.066,000 --> 0:01:22,000
to be able to do.

24
0:01:22.672,000 --> 0:01:24,000
By the time kids are 13 or 14,

25
0:01:25.493,000 --> 0:01:26,000
they tend to drop out of schools.

26
0:01:28.313,000 --> 0:01:31,000
In India, public schools not only offer free education --

27
0:01:31.611,000 --> 0:01:34,000
they offer free textbooks, free workbooks, free meals,

28
0:01:35.048,000 --> 0:01:37,000
sometimes even cash scholarships.

29
0:01:37.691,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And yet, 40 percent of the parents today

30
0:01:40.7,000 --> 0:01:43,000
are choosing to pull their children out of public schools

31
0:01:43.904,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and pay out of their pockets to put them in private schools.

32
0:01:47.445,000 --> 0:01:5,000
As a comparison, in a far richer country, the US,

33
0:01:51.134,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that number is only 10 percent.

34
0:01:53.377,000 --> 0:01:57,000
That's a huge statement on how broken the Indian public education system is.

35
0:01:59.431,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So it was with that background that I got a call in the summer of 2013

36
0:02:03.931,000 --> 0:02:06,000
from an absolutely brilliant lady called Surina Rajan.

37
0:02:07.778,000 --> 0:02:11,000
She was, at that time, the head of the Department of School Education

38
0:02:11.919,000 --> 0:02:13,000
in a state called Haryana in India.

39
0:02:14.209,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So she said to us, "Look, I've been heading this department

40
0:02:17.304,000 --> 0:02:18,000
for the last two years.

41
0:02:18.554,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I've tried a number of things, and nothing seems to work.

42
0:02:22.008,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Can you possibly help?"

43
0:02:24.852,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Let me describe Haryana a little bit to you.

44
0:02:27.69,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Haryana is a state which has 30 million people.

45
0:02:31.721,000 --> 0:02:34,000
It has 15,000 public schools

46
0:02:34.916,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and 2 million plus children in those public schools.

47
0:02:38.119,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So basically, with that phone call,

48
0:02:40.587,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I promised to help a state and system

49
0:02:43.033,000 --> 0:02:47,000
which was as large as that of Peru or Canada transform itself.

50
0:02:48.591,000 --> 0:02:51,000
As I started this project, I was very painfully aware of two things.

51
0:02:52.192,000 --> 0:02:55,000
One, that I had never done anything like this before.

52
0:02:55.427,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And two, many others had, perhaps without too much success.

53
0:03:00.247,000 --> 0:03:02,000
As my colleagues and I looked across the country

54
0:03:03.033,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and across the world,

55
0:03:04.365,000 --> 0:03:05,000
we couldn't find another example

56
0:03:06.257,000 --> 0:03:08,000
that we could just pick up and replicate in Haryana.

57
0:03:09.107,000 --> 0:03:11,000
We knew that we had to craft our own journey.

58
0:03:12.692,000 --> 0:03:15,000
But anyway, we jumped right in and as we jumped in,

59
0:03:15.77,000 --> 0:03:17,000
all sorts of ideas started flying at us.

60
0:03:18.533,000 --> 0:03:21,000
People said, "Let's change the way we recruit teachers,

61
0:03:21.595,000 --> 0:03:23,000
let's hire new principals and train them

62
0:03:24.363,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and send them on international learning tours,

63
0:03:26.605,000 --> 0:03:28,000
let's put technology inside classrooms."

64
0:03:29.128,000 --> 0:03:31,000
By the end of week one, we had 50 ideas on the table,

65
0:03:31.758,000 --> 0:03:33,000
all amazing, all sounded right.

66
0:03:34.01,000 --> 0:03:38,000
There was no way we were going to be able to implement 50 things.

67
0:03:39.103,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So I said, "Hang on, stop.

68
0:03:41.175,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Let's first at least decide what is it we're trying to achieve."

69
0:03:44.448,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So with a lot of push and pull and debate,

70
0:03:47.246,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Haryana set itself a goal which said: by 2020,

71
0:03:51.157,000 --> 0:03:54,000
we want 80 percent of our children to be at grade-level knowledge.

72
0:03:55.59,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Now the specifics of the goal don't matter here,

73
0:03:58.497,000 --> 0:04:,000
but what matters is how specific the goal is.

74
0:04:01.786,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Because it really allowed us to take all those ideas

75
0:04:04.782,000 --> 0:04:05,000
which were being thrown at us

76
0:04:06.231,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and say which ones we were going to implement.

77
0:04:08.629,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Does this idea support this goal? If yes, let's keep it.

78
0:04:12.972,000 --> 0:04:15,000
But if it doesn't or we're not sure, then let's put it aside.

79
0:04:16.276,000 --> 0:04:2,000
As simple as it sounds, having a very specific goal right up front

80
0:04:20.924,000 --> 0:04:23,000
has really allowed us to be very sharp and focused

81
0:04:24.164,000 --> 0:04:25,000
in our transformation journey.

82
0:04:25.816,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And looking back over the last two and a half years,

83
0:04:28.458,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that has been a huge positive for us.

84
0:04:31.488,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So we had the goal,

85
0:04:32.676,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and now we needed to figure out what are the issues, what is broken.

86
0:04:37.001,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Before we went into schools, a lot of people told us

87
0:04:39.752,000 --> 0:04:41,000
that education quality is poor

88
0:04:41.842,000 --> 0:04:44,000
because either the teachers are lazy, they don't come into schools,

89
0:04:45.74,000 --> 0:04:48,000
or they're incapable, they actually don't know how to teach.

90
0:04:49.427,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Well, when we went inside schools, we found something completely different.

91
0:04:53.734,000 --> 0:04:56,000
On most days, most teachers were actually inside schools.

92
0:04:57.771,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And when you spoke with them,

93
0:04:59.374,000 --> 0:05:02,000
you realized they were perfectly capable of teaching elementary classes.

94
0:05:03.952,000 --> 0:05:04,000
But they were not teaching.

95
0:05:06.702,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I went to a school

96
0:05:08.125,000 --> 0:05:11,000
where the teachers were getting the construction of a classroom

97
0:05:11.233,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and a toilet supervised.

98
0:05:13.645,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I went to another school

99
0:05:15.311,000 --> 0:05:17,000
where two of the teachers had gone to a nearby bank branch

100
0:05:18.226,000 --> 0:05:2,000
to deposit scholarship money into kids' accounts.

101
0:05:21.452,000 --> 0:05:25,000
At lunchtime, most teachers were spending all of their time

102
0:05:25.767,000 --> 0:05:29,000
getting the midday meal cooking, supervised and served to the students.

103
0:05:30.907,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So we asked the teachers,

104
0:05:32.135,000 --> 0:05:34,000
"What's going on, why are you not teaching?"

105
0:05:35.196,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And they said, "This is what's expected of us.

106
0:05:38.5,000 --> 0:05:4,000
When a supervisor comes to visit us,

107
0:05:40.835,000 --> 0:05:42,000
these are exactly the things that he checks.

108
0:05:43.248,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Has the toilet been made, has the meal been served.

109
0:05:45.952,000 --> 0:05:48,000
When my principal goes to a meeting at headquarters,

110
0:05:49.086,000 --> 0:05:51,000
these are exactly the things which are discussed."

111
0:05:52.481,000 --> 0:05:56,000
You see, what had happened was, over the last two decades,

112
0:05:56.529,000 --> 0:05:59,000
India had been fighting the challenge of access, having enough schools,

113
0:06:00.383,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and enrollment, bringing children into the schools.

114
0:06:03.178,000 --> 0:06:06,000
So the government launched a whole host of programs

115
0:06:06.632,000 --> 0:06:07,000
to address these challenges,

116
0:06:08.515,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and the teachers became the implicit executors of these programs.

117
0:06:13.296,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Not explicitly, but implicitly.

118
0:06:16.652,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And now, what was actually needed was not to actually train teachers further

119
0:06:21.692,000 --> 0:06:22,000
or to monitor their attendance

120
0:06:23.615,000 --> 0:06:26,000
but to tell them that what is most important

121
0:06:27.51,000 --> 0:06:29,000
is for them to go back inside classrooms and teach.

122
0:06:30.134,000 --> 0:06:33,000
They needed to be monitored and measured and awarded

123
0:06:34.012,000 --> 0:06:35,000
on the quality of teaching

124
0:06:35.384,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and not on all sorts of other things.

125
0:06:38.018,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So as we went through the education system,

126
0:06:40.502,000 --> 0:06:45,000
as we delved into it deeper, we found a few such core root causes

127
0:06:45.786,000 --> 0:06:49,000
which were determining, which were shaping how people behaved in the system.

128
0:06:49.942,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And we realized that unless we change those specific things,

129
0:06:53.649,000 --> 0:06:54,000
we could do a number of other things.

130
0:06:55.626,000 --> 0:06:57,000
We could train, we could put technology into schools,

131
0:06:58.493,000 --> 0:06:59,000
but the system wouldn't change.

132
0:07:00.497,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And addressing these non-obvious core issues

133
0:07:03.578,000 --> 0:07:04,000
became a key part of the program.

134
0:07:06.678,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So, we had the goal and we had the issues,

135
0:07:09.654,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and now we needed to figure out what the solutions were.

136
0:07:12.888,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We obviously did not want to recreate the wheel,

137
0:07:15.35,000 --> 0:07:17,000
so we said, "Let's look around and see what we can find."

138
0:07:18.49,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And we found these beautiful, small pilot experiments

139
0:07:23.411,000 --> 0:07:25,000
all over the country and all over the world.

140
0:07:26.146,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Small things being done by NGOs, being done by foundations.

141
0:07:30.138,000 --> 0:07:33,000
But what was also interesting was that none of them actually scaled.

142
0:07:34.119,000 --> 0:07:37,000
All of them were limited to 50, 100 or 500 schools.

143
0:07:37.681,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And here, we were looking for a solution for 15,000 schools.

144
0:07:41.18,000 --> 0:07:42,000
So we looked into why,

145
0:07:42.908,000 --> 0:07:45,000
if these things actually work, why don't they actually scale?

146
0:07:46.572,000 --> 0:07:49,000
What happens is that when a typical NGO comes in,

147
0:07:49.831,000 --> 0:07:51,000
they not only bring in their expertise

148
0:07:52.268,000 --> 0:07:54,000
but they also bring in additional resources.

149
0:07:54.807,000 --> 0:07:55,000
So they might bring in money,

150
0:07:56.588,000 --> 0:07:57,000
they might bring in people,

151
0:07:57.933,000 --> 0:07:58,000
they might bring in technology.

152
0:07:59.651,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And in the 50 or 100 schools that they actually operate in,

153
0:08:04.064,000 --> 0:08:06,000
those additional resources actually create a difference.

154
0:08:07.476,000 --> 0:08:09,000
But now imagine that the head of this NGO

155
0:08:10.032,000 --> 0:08:12,000
goes to the head of the School Education Department

156
0:08:12.811,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and says, "Hey, now let's do this for 15,000 schools."

157
0:08:16.1,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Where is that guy or girl going to find the money

158
0:08:19.577,000 --> 0:08:21,000
to actually scale this up to 15,000 schools?

159
0:08:22.305,000 --> 0:08:23,000
He doesn't have the additional money,

160
0:08:24.091,000 --> 0:08:25,000
he doesn't have the resources.

161
0:08:25.712,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And hence, innovations don't scale.

162
0:08:28.938,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So right at the beginning of the project, what we said was,

163
0:08:32.365,000 --> 0:08:34,000
"Whatever we have to do has to be scalable,

164
0:08:35.035,000 --> 0:08:38,000
it has to work in all 15,000 schools."

165
0:08:38.346,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And hence, it has to work within the existing budgets

166
0:08:42.162,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and resources that the state actually has.

167
0:08:45.552,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Much easier said than done.

168
0:08:47.451,000 --> 0:08:48,000
(Laughter)

169
0:08:48.864,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I think this was definitely the point in time

170
0:08:51.044,000 --> 0:08:52,000
when my team hated me.

171
0:08:52.912,000 --> 0:08:57,000
We spent a lot of long hours in office, in cafés,

172
0:08:58.114,000 --> 0:08:59,000
sometimes even in bars,

173
0:08:59.433,000 --> 0:09:,000
scratching out heads and saying,

174
0:09:01.12,000 --> 0:09:04,000
"Where are the solutions, how are we going to solve this problem?"

175
0:09:04.41,000 --> 0:09:07,000
In the end, I think we did find solutions to many of the issues.

176
0:09:08.214,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I'll give you an example.

177
0:09:10.111,000 --> 0:09:11,000
In the context of effective learning,

178
0:09:12.077,000 --> 0:09:15,000
one of the things people talk about is hands-on learning.

179
0:09:15.386,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Children shouldn't memorize things from books,

180
0:09:17.678,000 --> 0:09:18,000
they should do activities,

181
0:09:19.291,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and that's a more effective way to learn.

182
0:09:21.314,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Which basically means giving students things

183
0:09:23.636,000 --> 0:09:26,000
like beads, learning rods, abacuses.

184
0:09:27.082,000 --> 0:09:29,000
But we did not have the budgets to give that

185
0:09:29.56,000 --> 0:09:31,000
to 15,000 schools, 2 million children.

186
0:09:32.199,000 --> 0:09:33,000
We needed another solution.

187
0:09:34.446,000 --> 0:09:35,000
We couldn't think of anything.

188
0:09:36.368,000 --> 0:09:38,000
One day, one of our team members went to a school

189
0:09:39.221,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and saw a teacher pick up sticks and stones from the garden outside

190
0:09:43.611,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and take them into the classroom

191
0:09:45.456,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and give them to the students.

192
0:09:47.726,000 --> 0:09:49,000
That was a huge eureka moment for us.

193
0:09:51.617,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So what happens now in the textbooks in Haryana

194
0:09:54.524,000 --> 0:09:56,000
is that after every concept, we have a little box

195
0:09:57.29,000 --> 0:09:59,000
which are instructions for the teachers which say,

196
0:09:59.702,000 --> 0:10:03,000
"To teach this concept, here's an activity that you can do.

197
0:10:03.882,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And by the way, in order to actually do this activity,

198
0:10:06.993,000 --> 0:10:09,000
here are things that you can use from your immediate environment,

199
0:10:10.196,000 --> 0:10:13,000
whether it be the garden outside or the classroom inside,

200
0:10:13.241,000 --> 0:10:15,000
which can be used as learning aids for kids."

201
0:10:16.194,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And we see teachers all over Haryana

202
0:10:18.664,000 --> 0:10:21,000
using lots of innovative things to be able to teach students.

203
0:10:22.617,000 --> 0:10:25,000
So in this way, whatever we designed,

204
0:10:26.226,000 --> 0:10:28,000
we were actually able to implement it

205
0:10:28.328,000 --> 0:10:3,000
across all 15,000 schools from day one.

206
0:10:32.304,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Now, this brings me to my last point.

207
0:10:34.514,000 --> 0:10:37,000
How do you implement something across 15,000 schools

208
0:10:37.811,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and 100,000 teachers?

209
0:10:40.357,000 --> 0:10:42,000
The department used to have a process

210
0:10:42.403,000 --> 0:10:43,000
which is very interesting.

211
0:10:43.701,000 --> 0:10:45,000
I like to call it "The Chain of Hope."

212
0:10:48.24,000 --> 0:10:5,000
They would write a letter from the headquarters

213
0:10:50.624,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and send it to the next level,

214
0:10:52.273,000 --> 0:10:53,000
which was the district offices.

215
0:10:54.186,000 --> 0:10:56,000
They would hope that in each of these district offices,

216
0:10:56.867,000 --> 0:10:59,000
an officer would get the letter, would open it, read it

217
0:11:00.866,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and then forward it to the next level,

218
0:11:02.984,000 --> 0:11:04,000
which was the block offices.

219
0:11:05.015,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And then you would hope that at the block office,

220
0:11:08.804,000 --> 0:11:09,000
somebody else got the letter,

221
0:11:10.311,000 --> 0:11:14,000
opened it, read it and forwarded it eventually to the 15,000 principals.

222
0:11:14.354,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And then one would hope that the principals

223
0:11:17.037,000 --> 0:11:19,000
got the letter, received it, understood it

224
0:11:19.708,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and started implementing it.

225
0:11:21.662,000 --> 0:11:22,000
It was a little bit ridiculous.

226
0:11:24.684,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Now, we knew technology was the answer,

227
0:11:27.169,000 --> 0:11:29,000
but we also knew that most of these schools

228
0:11:29.334,000 --> 0:11:31,000
don't have a computer or email.

229
0:11:32.497,000 --> 0:11:35,000
However, what the teachers do have are smartphones.

230
0:11:35.604,000 --> 0:11:39,000
They're constantly on SMS, on Facebook and on WhatsApp.

231
0:11:40.65,000 --> 0:11:42,000
So what now happens in Haryana is,

232
0:11:42.919,000 --> 0:11:46,000
all principals and teachers are divided into hundreds of WhatsApp groups

233
0:11:47.563,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and anytime something needs to be communicated,

234
0:11:50.409,000 --> 0:11:52,000
it's just posted across all WhatsApp groups.

235
0:11:53.486,000 --> 0:11:55,000
It spreads like wildfire.

236
0:11:55.711,000 --> 0:11:57,000
You can immediately check who has received it,

237
0:11:58.728,000 --> 0:11:59,000
who has read it.

238
0:12:00.042,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Teachers can ask clarification questions instantaneously.

239
0:12:03.926,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And what's interesting is,

240
0:12:05.191,000 --> 0:12:08,000
it's not just the headquarters who are answering these questions.

241
0:12:08.573,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Another teacher from a completely different part of the state

242
0:12:11.486,000 --> 0:12:13,000
will stand up and answer the question.

243
0:12:13.903,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Everybody's acting as everybody's peer group,

244
0:12:16.607,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and things are getting implemented.

245
0:12:19.784,000 --> 0:12:21,000
So today, when you go to a school in Haryana,

246
0:12:22.091,000 --> 0:12:23,000
things look different.

247
0:12:23.702,000 --> 0:12:25,000
The teachers are back inside classrooms,

248
0:12:26.156,000 --> 0:12:27,000
they're teaching.

249
0:12:27.484,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Often with innovative techniques.

250
0:12:29.74,000 --> 0:12:32,000
When a supervisor comes to visit the classroom,

251
0:12:32.866,000 --> 0:12:35,000
he or she not only checks the construction of the toilet

252
0:12:36.757,000 --> 0:12:38,000
but also what is the quality of teaching.

253
0:12:40.092,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Once a quarter, all students across the state

254
0:12:43.232,000 --> 0:12:45,000
are assessed on their learning outcomes

255
0:12:45.421,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and schools which are doing well are rewarded.

256
0:12:48.303,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And schools which are not doing so well

257
0:12:50.796,000 --> 0:12:52,000
find themselves having difficult conversations.

258
0:12:53.568,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Of course, they also get additional support

259
0:12:55.671,000 --> 0:12:56,000
to be able to do better in the future.

260
0:12:59.232,000 --> 0:13:,000
In the context of education,

261
0:13:00.88,000 --> 0:13:02,000
it's very difficult to see results quickly.

262
0:13:03.63,000 --> 0:13:05,000
When people talk about systemic, large-scale change,

263
0:13:06.629,000 --> 0:13:09,000
they talk about periods of 7 years and 10 years.

264
0:13:10.232,000 --> 0:13:11,000
But not in Haryana.

265
0:13:12.153,000 --> 0:13:15,000
In the last one year, there have been three independent studies,

266
0:13:16.129,000 --> 0:13:18,000
all measuring student learning outcomes,

267
0:13:18.732,000 --> 0:13:2,000
which indicate that something fundamental,

268
0:13:21.063,000 --> 0:13:23,000
something unique is happening in Haryana.

269
0:13:23.622,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Learning levels of children have stopped declining,

270
0:13:26.654,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and they have started going up.

271
0:13:28.481,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Haryana is one of the few states in the country

272
0:13:31.715,000 --> 0:13:32,000
which is showing an improvement,

273
0:13:33.318,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and certainly the one that is showing the fastest rate of improvement.

274
0:13:38.005,000 --> 0:13:39,000
These are still early signs,

275
0:13:39.397,000 --> 0:13:4,000
there's a long way to go,

276
0:13:40.615,000 --> 0:13:42,000
but this gives us a lot of hope for the future.

277
0:13:44.859,000 --> 0:13:45,000
I recently went to a school,

278
0:13:46.446,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and as I was leaving,

279
0:13:48.413,000 --> 0:13:49,000
I ran into a lady,

280
0:13:49.588,000 --> 0:13:5,000
her name was Parvati,

281
0:13:50.763,000 --> 0:13:51,000
she was the mother of a child,

282
0:13:52.225,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and she was smiling.

283
0:13:53.828,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And I said, "Why are you smiling, what's going on?"

284
0:13:56.761,000 --> 0:13:58,000
And she said, "I don't know what's going on,

285
0:13:59.531,000 --> 0:14:02,000
but what I do know is that my children are learning,

286
0:14:02.642,000 --> 0:14:03,000
they're having fun,

287
0:14:04.117,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and for the time being, I'll stop my search for a private school

288
0:14:07.336,000 --> 0:14:08,000
to send them to."

289
0:14:09.523,000 --> 0:14:11,000
So I go back to where I started:

290
0:14:11.547,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Can government systems transform?

291
0:14:14.163,000 --> 0:14:15,000
I certainly believe so.

292
0:14:15.687,000 --> 0:14:17,000
I think if you give them the right levers,

293
0:14:17.805,000 --> 0:14:18,000
they can move mountains.

294
0:14:19.735,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Thank you.

295
0:14:20.91,000 --> 0:14:26,000
(Applause)

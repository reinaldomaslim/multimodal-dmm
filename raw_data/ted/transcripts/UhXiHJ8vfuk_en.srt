1
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
What I'd like to start off with is an observation,

2
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:3,000
which is that if I've learned anything over the last year,

3
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:32,000
it's that the supreme irony

4
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:34,000
of publishing a book about slowness

5
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:36,000
is that you have to go around promoting it really fast.

6
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I seem to spend most of my time these days

7
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:42,000
zipping from city to city, studio to studio,

8
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:44,000
interview to interview,

9
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:46,000
serving up the book in really tiny bite-size chunks.

10
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Because everyone these days

11
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:5,000
wants to know how to slow down,

12
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:53,000
but they want to know how to slow down really quickly. So ...

13
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:55,000
so I did a spot on CNN the other day

14
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:58,000
where I actually spent more time in makeup than I did talking on air.

15
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And I think that -- that's not really surprising though, is it?

16
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Because that's kind of the world that we live in now,

17
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:06,000
a world stuck in fast-forward.

18
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:08,000
A world obsessed with speed,

19
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:11,000
with doing everything faster, with cramming more and more

20
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:13,000
into less and less time.

21
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Every moment of the day feels like

22
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:17,000
a race against the clock.

23
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:19,000
To borrow a phrase from Carrie Fisher, which is

24
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:21,000
in my bio there; I'll just toss it out again --

25
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:24,000
"These days even instant gratification takes too long." (Laughter)

26
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And

27
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
if you think about how we to try to make things better, what do we do?

28
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:31,000
No, we speed them up, don't we? So we used to dial; now we speed dial.

29
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:34,000
We used to read; now we speed read. We used to walk; now we speed walk.

30
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And of course, we used to date and now we speed date.

31
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And even things that are by their very nature slow --

32
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:43,000
we try and speed them up too.

33
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So I was in New York recently, and I walked past a gym

34
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:47,000
that had an advertisement in the window for a new course, a new evening course.

35
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And it was for, you guessed it, speed yoga.

36
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So this -- the perfect solution for time-starved professionals

37
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:56,000
who want to, you know, salute the sun,

38
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:58,000
but only want to give over about 20 minutes to it.

39
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I mean, these are sort of the extreme examples,

40
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and they're amusing and good to laugh at.

41
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:05,000
But there's a very serious point,

42
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and I think that in the headlong dash of daily life,

43
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:11,000
we often lose sight of the damage

44
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that this roadrunner form of living does to us.

45
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:17,000
We're so marinated in the culture of speed

46
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that we almost fail to notice the toll it takes

47
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:21,000
on every aspect of our lives --

48
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:23,000
on our health, our diet, our work,

49
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:26,000
our relationships, the environment and our community.

50
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And sometimes it takes

51
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:3,000
a wake-up call, doesn't it,

52
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to alert us to the fact that we're hurrying through our lives,

53
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
instead of actually living them; that we're

54
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:37,000
living the fast life, instead of the good life.

55
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And I think for many people, that wake-up call

56
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:41,000
takes the form of an illness.

57
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:44,000
You know, a burnout, or eventually the body says,

58
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:46,000
"I can't take it anymore," and throws in the towel.

59
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Or maybe a relationship goes up in smoke

60
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:5,000
because we haven't had the time, or the patience,

61
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:52,000
or the tranquility,

62
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:54,000
to be with the other person, to listen to them.

63
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And my wake-up call came when I started

64
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:59,000
reading bedtime stories to my son,

65
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and I found that at the end of day,

66
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I would go into his room and I just couldn't slow down -- you know,

67
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I'd be speed reading "The Cat In The Hat."

68
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I'd be -- you know, I'd be skipping lines here,

69
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:1,000
paragraphs there, sometimes a whole page,

70
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and of course, my little boy knew the book inside out, so we would quarrel.

71
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And what should have been the most relaxing, the most intimate,

72
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
the most tender moment of the day,

73
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:21,000
when a dad sits down to read to his son,

74
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:24,000
became instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills,

75
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:26,000
a clash between my speed

76
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and his slowness.

77
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And this went on for some time,

78
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:33,000
until I caught myself scanning a newspaper article

79
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
with timesaving tips for fast people.

80
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And one of them made reference to a series of books called

81
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:39,000
"The One-Minute Bedtime Story."

82
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And I wince saying those words now,

83
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:44,000
but my first reaction at the time was very different.

84
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:46,000
My first reflex was to say,

85
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:48,000
"Hallelujah -- what a great idea!

86
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:51,000
This is exactly what I'm looking for to speed up bedtime even more."

87
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:53,000
But thankfully,

88
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:55,000
a light bulb went on over my head, and my next reaction was very different,

89
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and I took a step back, and I thought,

90
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:,000
"Whoa -- you know, has it really come to this?

91
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Am I really in such a hurry that I'm prepared

92
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:05,000
to fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day?"

93
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And I put away the newspaper --

94
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and I was getting on a plane -- and I sat there,

95
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and I did something I hadn't done for a long time -- which is I did nothing.

96
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I just thought, and I thought long and hard.

97
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And by the time I got off that plane, I'd decided I wanted to do something about it.

98
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I wanted to investigate this whole roadrunner culture,

99
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and what it was doing to me and to everyone else.

100
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And I had two questions in my head.

101
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
The first was, how did we get so fast?

102
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And the second is, is it possible,

103
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:34,000
or even desirable, to slow down?

104
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Now, if you think about

105
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:39,000
how our world got so accelerated, the usual suspects rear their heads.

106
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:41,000
You think of, you know, urbanization,

107
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:44,000
consumerism, the workplace, technology.

108
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:46,000
But I think if you cut through

109
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:49,000
those forces, you get to what might be the deeper

110
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:52,000
driver, the nub of the question,

111
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:54,000
which is how we think about time itself.

112
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:57,000
In other cultures, time is cyclical.

113
0:04:57,000 --> 0:05:,000
It's seen as moving in great,

114
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:02,000
unhurried circles.

115
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:04,000
It's always renewing and refreshing itself.

116
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Whereas in the West, time is linear.

117
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It's a finite resource;

118
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:1,000
it's always draining away.

119
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:12,000
You either use it, or lose it.

120
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:15,000
"Time is money," as Benjamin Franklin said.

121
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And I think what that does to us psychologically

122
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:19,000
is it creates an equation.

123
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Time is scarce, so what do we do?

124
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Well -- well, we speed up, don't we?

125
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:25,000
We try and do more and more with less and less time.

126
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:27,000
We turn every moment of every day

127
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:29,000
into a race to the finish line --

128
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:32,000
a finish line, incidentally, that we never reach,

129
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:34,000
but a finish line nonetheless.

130
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And I guess that the question is,

131
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:38,000
is it possible to break free from that mindset?

132
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And thankfully, the answer is yes, because

133
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:42,000
what I discovered, when I began looking around, that there is

134
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:45,000
a global backlash against this culture that

135
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:48,000
tells us that faster is always better, and that busier is best.

136
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Right across the world, people are doing the unthinkable:

137
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:53,000
they're slowing down, and finding that,

138
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:56,000
although conventional wisdom tells you that if you slow down, you're road kill,

139
0:05:56,000 --> 0:05:58,000
the opposite turns out to be true:

140
0:05:58,000 --> 0:06:,000
that by slowing down at the right moments,

141
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:02,000
people find that they do everything better.

142
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:05,000
They eat better; they make love better; they exercise better;

143
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:08,000
they work better; they live better.

144
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And, in this kind of cauldron

145
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:14,000
of moments and places and acts of deceleration,

146
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:17,000
lie what a lot of people now refer to as

147
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:19,000
the "International Slow Movement."

148
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Now if you'll permit me a small act of hypocrisy,

149
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I'll just give you a very quick overview of

150
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:3,000
what's going on inside the Slow Movement. If you think of food,

151
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:32,000
many of you will have heard of the Slow Food movement.

152
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Started in Italy, but has spread across the world,

153
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and now has 100,000 members

154
0:06:36,000 --> 0:06:38,000
in 50 countries.

155
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And it's driven by a very simple and sensible message,

156
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:44,000
which is that we get more pleasure and more health

157
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:46,000
from our food when we

158
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:5,000
cultivate, cook and consume it at a reasonable pace.

159
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I think also the explosion of

160
0:06:52,000 --> 0:06:55,000
the organic farming movement, and the renaissance of farmers' markets,

161
0:06:55,000 --> 0:06:58,000
are other illustrations

162
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:01,000
of the fact that people are desperate to get away from

163
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:03,000
eating and cooking and cultivating their food

164
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:05,000
on an industrial timetable.

165
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:08,000
They want to get back to slower rhythms.

166
0:07:08,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And out of the Slow Food movement has grown something

167
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:14,000
called the Slow Cities movement, which has started in Italy,

168
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:16,000
but has spread right across Europe and beyond.

169
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And in this, towns

170
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:21,000
begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape,

171
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:24,000
so that people are encouraged to slow down

172
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and smell the roses and connect with one another.

173
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So they might curb traffic,

174
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:31,000
or put in a park bench, or some green space.

175
0:07:31,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And in some ways, these changes add up to more than the sum of their parts,

176
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:37,000
because I think when a Slow City becomes officially a Slow City,

177
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:39,000
it's kind of like a philosophical declaration.

178
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:42,000
It's saying to the rest of world, and to the people in that town,

179
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:44,000
that we believe that in the 21st century,

180
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:5,000
In medicine, I think a lot of people are deeply disillusioned

181
0:07:5,000 --> 0:07:52,000
with the kind of quick-fix mentality

182
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:54,000
you find in conventional medicine.

183
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And millions of them around the world are turning

184
0:07:56,000 --> 0:07:59,000
to complementary and alternative forms of medicine,

185
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:01,000
which tend to tap into sort of

186
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:04,000
slower, gentler, more holistic forms of healing.

187
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Now, obviously the jury is out on many of these complementary therapies,

188
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and I personally doubt that the coffee enema

189
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:13,000
will ever, you know, gain mainstream approval.

190
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:15,000
But other treatments

191
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:18,000
such as acupuncture and massage, and even just relaxation,

192
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:2,000
clearly have some kind of benefit.

193
0:08:2,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And blue-chip medical colleges everywhere

194
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:25,000
are starting to study these things to find out how they work,

195
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and what we might learn from them.

196
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Sex. There's an awful lot of fast sex around, isn't there?

197
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I was coming to --

198
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:35,000
well -- no pun intended there.

199
0:08:35,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I was making my way, let's say, slowly to Oxford,

200
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and I went through a news agent, and I saw a magazine,

201
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:42,000
a men's magazine, and it said on the front,

202
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:45,000
"How to bring your partner to orgasm in 30 seconds."

203
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:47,000
So, you know, even sex

204
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:49,000
is on a stopwatch these days.

205
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Now, you know,

206
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:53,000
I like a quickie as much as the next person,

207
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:56,000
but I think that there's an awful lot to be gained

208
0:08:56,000 --> 0:08:58,000
from slow sex -- from slowing down in the bedroom.

209
0:08:58,000 --> 0:09:01,000
You know, you tap into that -- those deeper,

210
0:09:01,000 --> 0:09:04,000
sort of, psychological, emotional, spiritual currents,

211
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and you get a better orgasm with the buildup.

212
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:09,000
You can get more bang for your buck, let's say.

213
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I mean, the Pointer Sisters said it most eloquently, didn't they,

214
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:15,000
when they sang the praises of "a lover with a slow hand."

215
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Now, we all laughed at Sting

216
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:19,000
a few years ago when he went Tantric,

217
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:22,000
but you fast-forward a few years, and now you find couples of all ages

218
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:24,000
flocking to workshops, or maybe just

219
0:09:24,000 --> 0:09:27,000
on their own in their own bedrooms, finding ways

220
0:09:27,000 --> 0:09:3,000
to put on the brakes and have better sex.

221
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And of course, in Italy where -- I mean, Italians always seem to know

222
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:34,000
where to find their pleasure --

223
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:37,000
they've launched an official Slow Sex movement.

224
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:4,000
The workplace.

225
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Right across much of the world --

226
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:44,000
North America being a notable exception --

227
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:46,000
working hours have been coming down.

228
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And Europe is an example of that,

229
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and people finding that their quality of life improves

230
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:53,000
as they're working less, and also

231
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:55,000
that their hourly productivity goes up.

232
0:09:55,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Now, clearly there are problems with

233
0:09:57,000 --> 0:09:59,000
the 35-hour workweek in France --

234
0:09:59,000 --> 0:10:01,000
too much, too soon, too rigid.

235
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:04,000
But other countries in Europe, notably the Nordic countries,

236
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:06,000
are showing that it's possible

237
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:08,000
to have a kick-ass economy

238
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:1,000
without being a workaholic.

239
0:10:1,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And Norway, Sweden,

240
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Denmark and Finland now rank

241
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:17,000
among the top six most competitive nations on Earth,

242
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and they work the kind of hours that would make the average American

243
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:21,000
weep with envy.

244
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And if you go beyond sort of the country level,

245
0:10:24,000 --> 0:10:26,000
down at the micro-company level,

246
0:10:26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
more and more companies now are realizing

247
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:29,000
that they need to allow their staff

248
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:31,000
either to work fewer hours or just to unplug --

249
0:10:31,000 --> 0:10:34,000
to take a lunch break, or to go sit in a quiet room,

250
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:38,000
to switch off their Blackberrys and laptops -- you at the back --

251
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:41,000
mobile phones,

252
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:44,000
during the work day or on the weekend, so that they have time to recharge

253
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and for the brain to slide into that

254
0:10:46,000 --> 0:10:49,000
kind of creative mode of thought.

255
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:53,000
It's not just, though, these days,

256
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:55,000
adults who overwork, though, is it? It's children, too.

257
0:10:56,000 --> 0:10:59,000
I'm 37, and my childhood ended in the mid-'80s,

258
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and I look at kids now, and I'm just amazed by the way they

259
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:03,000
race around with more homework,

260
0:11:03,000 --> 0:11:05,000
more tutoring, more extracurriculars

261
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:08,000
than we would ever have conceived of a generation ago.

262
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And some of the most heartrending emails

263
0:11:1,000 --> 0:11:12,000
that I get on my website

264
0:11:12,000 --> 0:11:15,000
are actually from adolescents

265
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:17,000
hovering on the edge of burnout, pleading with me

266
0:11:17,000 --> 0:11:19,000
to write to their parents,

267
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:22,000
to help them slow down, to help them get off this

268
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:25,000
full-throttle treadmill.

269
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:27,000
But thankfully, there is a backlash there in parenting as well,

270
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and you're finding that, you know, towns in the United States

271
0:11:29,000 --> 0:11:32,000
are now banding together and banning extracurriculars

272
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:34,000
on a particular day of the month, so that people can,

273
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:37,000
you know, decompress and have some family time, and slow down.

274
0:11:38,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Homework is another thing. There are homework bans

275
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:44,000
springing up all over the developed world

276
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:47,000
in schools which had been piling on the homework for years,

277
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and now they're discovering that less can be more.

278
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:51,000
So there was a case up in Scotland recently

279
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:53,000
where a fee-paying, high-achieving private school

280
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:55,000
banned homework

281
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:57,000
for everyone under the age of 13,

282
0:11:57,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and the high-achieving parents freaked out and said,

283
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:01,000
"What are you -- you know, our kids will fall" -- the headmaster said,

284
0:12:01,000 --> 0:12:04,000
"No, no, your children need to slow down at the end of the day."

285
0:12:04,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And just this last month, the exam results came in,

286
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and in math, science, marks went up 20 percent

287
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:12,000
on average last year.

288
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And I think what's very revealing is that

289
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:17,000
the elite universities, who are often cited as the reason

290
0:12:17,000 --> 0:12:19,000
that people drive their kids and hothouse them so much,

291
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:22,000
are starting to notice the caliber of students

292
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:25,000
coming to them is falling. These kids have wonderful marks;

293
0:12:25,000 --> 0:12:28,000
they have CVs jammed with extracurriculars,

294
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:3,000
to the point that would make your eyes water.

295
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:32,000
But they lack spark; they lack

296
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:34,000
the ability to think creatively and think outside --

297
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:37,000
they don't know how to dream. And so what these Ivy League schools,

298
0:12:37,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and Oxford and Cambridge and so on, are starting to send a message

299
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:42,000
to parents and students that they need to put on the brakes a little bit.

300
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And in Harvard, for instance, they send out

301
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:48,000
a letter to undergraduates -- freshmen --

302
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:51,000
telling them that they'll get more out of life, and more out of Harvard,

303
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:53,000
if they put on the brakes, if they do less,

304
0:12:53,000 --> 0:12:56,000
but give time to things, the time that things need,

305
0:12:56,000 --> 0:12:58,000
to enjoy them, to savor them.

306
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:,000
And even if they sometimes do nothing at all.

307
0:13:,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And that letter is called -- very revealing, I think --

308
0:13:02,000 --> 0:13:05,000
"Slow Down!" -- with an exclamation mark on the end.

309
0:13:05,000 --> 0:13:08,000
So wherever you look, the message, it seems to me, is the same:

310
0:13:08,000 --> 0:13:1,000
that less is very often more,

311
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:13,000
that slower is very often

312
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:15,000
better. But that said, of course,

313
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:17,000
it's not that easy to slow down, is it?

314
0:13:17,000 --> 0:13:19,000
I mean, you heard that I got a speeding ticket

315
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:21,000
while I was researching my book on the benefits of slowness,

316
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and that's true, but that's not all of it.

317
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:25,000
I was actually en route to a dinner

318
0:13:25,000 --> 0:13:27,000
held by Slow Food at the time.

319
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And if that's not shaming enough, I got that ticket in Italy.

320
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And if any of you have ever driven on an Italian highway,

321
0:13:33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
you'll have a pretty good idea of how fast I was going.

322
0:13:35,000 --> 0:13:38,000
(Laughter)

323
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:4,000
But why is it so hard to slow down?

324
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:42,000
I think there are various reasons.

325
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:45,000
One is that speed is fun, you know, speed is sexy.

326
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:48,000
It's all that adrenaline rush. It's hard to give it up.

327
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:5,000
I think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension --

328
0:13:5,000 --> 0:13:52,000
that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off

329
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:54,000
from the bigger, deeper questions.

330
0:13:54,000 --> 0:13:56,000
We fill our head with distraction, with busyness,

331
0:13:56,000 --> 0:13:58,000
so that we don't have to ask,

332
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:01,000
am I well? Am I happy? Are my children growing up right?

333
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Are politicians making good decisions on my behalf?

334
0:14:05,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Another reason -- although I think, perhaps, the most powerful reason --

335
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:1,000
why we find it hard to slow down is the cultural taboo

336
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:13,000
that we've erected against slowing down.

337
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:15,000
"Slow" is a dirty word in our culture.

338
0:14:15,000 --> 0:14:17,000
It's a byword for "lazy," "slacker,"

339
0:14:17,000 --> 0:14:19,000
for being somebody who gives up.

340
0:14:19,000 --> 0:14:21,000
You know, "he's a bit slow." It's actually synonymous

341
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:24,000
with being stupid.

342
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:26,000
I guess what the Slow Movement -- the purpose of the Slow Movement,

343
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
or its main goal, really, is to tackle that taboo,

344
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and to say that yes,

345
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:33,000
sometimes slow is not the answer,

346
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
that there is such a thing as "bad slow."

347
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:37,000
You know, I got stuck on the M25,

348
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:39,000
which is a ring road around London, recently,

349
0:14:39,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and spent three-and-a-half hours there. And I can tell you,

350
0:14:41,000 --> 0:14:43,000
that's really bad slow.

351
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:45,000
But the new idea,

352
0:14:45,000 --> 0:14:47,000
the sort of revolutionary idea, of the Slow Movement,

353
0:14:47,000 --> 0:14:49,000
is that there is such a thing as "good slow," too.

354
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:51,000
And good slow is, you know, taking the time

355
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:54,000
to eat a meal with your family, with the TV switched off.

356
0:14:54,000 --> 0:14:57,000
Or taking the time to look at a problem from all angles

357
0:14:57,000 --> 0:14:59,000
in the office to make the best decision

358
0:14:59,000 --> 0:15:01,000
at work.

359
0:15:01,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Or even simply just taking the time

360
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:05,000
to slow down

361
0:15:05,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and savor your life.

362
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Now, one of the things that I found most uplifting

363
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:13,000
about all of this stuff that's happened around the book

364
0:15:13,000 --> 0:15:16,000
since it came out, is the reaction to it.

365
0:15:16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
And I knew that when my book on slowness came out,

366
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:2,000
it would be welcomed by the New Age brigade,

367
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:23,000
but it's also been taken up, with great gusto,

368
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:25,000
by the corporate world -- you know,

369
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:27,000
business press, but also

370
0:15:27,000 --> 0:15:29,000
big companies and leadership organizations.

371
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Because people at the top of the chain, people like you, I think,

372
0:15:32,000 --> 0:15:34,000
are starting to realize that there's too much

373
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:36,000
speed in the system,

374
0:15:36,000 --> 0:15:39,000
there's too much busyness, and it's time to find,

375
0:15:39,000 --> 0:15:43,000
or get back to that lost art of shifting gears.

376
0:15:43,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Another encouraging sign, I think,

377
0:15:45,000 --> 0:15:47,000
is that it's not just in the developed world

378
0:15:47,000 --> 0:15:5,000
that this idea's been taken up. In the developing world,

379
0:15:5,000 --> 0:15:52,000
in countries that are on the verge of making that leap

380
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:54,000
into first world status -- China, Brazil,

381
0:15:54,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Thailand, Poland, and so on --

382
0:15:56,000 --> 0:15:59,000
these countries have embraced the idea of the Slow Movement,

383
0:15:59,000 --> 0:16:02,000
many people in them, and there's a debate going on

384
0:16:02,000 --> 0:16:04,000
in their media, on the streets.

385
0:16:04,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Because I think they're looking at the West, and they're saying,

386
0:16:06,000 --> 0:16:09,000
"Well, we like that aspect of what you've got,

387
0:16:09,000 --> 0:16:11,000
but we're not so sure about that."

388
0:16:11,000 --> 0:16:13,000
So all of that said, is it,

389
0:16:13,000 --> 0:16:16,000
I guess, is it possible?

390
0:16:16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
That's really the main question before us today. Is it possible

391
0:16:19,000 --> 0:16:21,000
to slow down? And

392
0:16:21,000 --> 0:16:23,000
I'm happy to be able to say to you

393
0:16:23,000 --> 0:16:25,000
that the answer is a resounding yes.

394
0:16:25,000 --> 0:16:28,000
And I present myself as Exhibit A,

395
0:16:28,000 --> 0:16:31,000
a kind of reformed and rehabilitated

396
0:16:31,000 --> 0:16:33,000
speed-aholic.

397
0:16:33,000 --> 0:16:35,000
I still love speed. You know, I live in London,

398
0:16:35,000 --> 0:16:37,000
and I work as a journalist,

399
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:39,000
and I enjoy the buzz and the busyness,

400
0:16:39,000 --> 0:16:41,000
and the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things.

401
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:43,000
I play squash and ice hockey,

402
0:16:43,000 --> 0:16:46,000
two very fast sports, and I wouldn't give them up for the world.

403
0:16:47,000 --> 0:16:5,000
But I've also, over the last year or so,

404
0:16:5,000 --> 0:16:52,000
got in touch with my inner tortoise.

405
0:16:52,000 --> 0:16:53,000
(Laughter)

406
0:16:53,000 --> 0:16:55,000
And what that means is that

407
0:16:55,000 --> 0:16:58,000
I no longer

408
0:16:58,000 --> 0:17:01,000
overload myself gratuitously.

409
0:17:01,000 --> 0:17:04,000
My default mode is no longer

410
0:17:04,000 --> 0:17:06,000
to be a rush-aholic.

411
0:17:07,000 --> 0:17:09,000
I no longer hear

412
0:17:09,000 --> 0:17:11,000
time's winged chariot drawing near,

413
0:17:11,000 --> 0:17:13,000
or at least not as much as I did before.

414
0:17:13,000 --> 0:17:16,000
I can actually hear it now, because I see my time is ticking off.

415
0:17:17,000 --> 0:17:19,000
And the upshot of all of that is that

416
0:17:19,000 --> 0:17:22,000
I actually feel a lot happier, healthier,

417
0:17:22,000 --> 0:17:25,000
more productive than I ever have.

418
0:17:25,000 --> 0:17:27,000
I feel like I'm living

419
0:17:27,000 --> 0:17:3,000
my life rather than actually just racing through it.

420
0:17:31,000 --> 0:17:33,000
And perhaps, the most important

421
0:17:33,000 --> 0:17:35,000
measure of the success of this

422
0:17:35,000 --> 0:17:38,000
is that I feel that my relationships are a lot deeper,

423
0:17:38,000 --> 0:17:4,000
richer, stronger.

424
0:17:4,000 --> 0:17:43,000
And for me, I guess, the litmus test

425
0:17:43,000 --> 0:17:45,000
for whether this would work, and what it would mean,

426
0:17:45,000 --> 0:17:48,000
was always going to be bedtime stories, because that's sort of where

427
0:17:48,000 --> 0:17:51,000
the journey began. And there too the news is

428
0:17:51,000 --> 0:17:53,000
rosy. You know,

429
0:17:53,000 --> 0:17:55,000
at the end of the day, I go into my son's room.

430
0:17:55,000 --> 0:17:57,000
I don't wear a watch. I switch off my computer,

431
0:17:57,000 --> 0:17:59,000
so I can't hear the email pinging into the basket,

432
0:17:59,000 --> 0:18:02,000
and I just slow down to his pace and we read.

433
0:18:03,000 --> 0:18:06,000
And because children have their own tempo and internal clock,

434
0:18:06,000 --> 0:18:08,000
they don't do quality time,

435
0:18:08,000 --> 0:18:1,000
where you schedule 10 minutes for them to open up to you.

436
0:18:1,000 --> 0:18:13,000
They need you to move at their rhythm.

437
0:18:13,000 --> 0:18:15,000
I find that 10 minutes into a story, you know,

438
0:18:15,000 --> 0:18:17,000
my son will suddenly say, "You know,

439
0:18:17,000 --> 0:18:19,000
something happened in the playground today that really bothered me."

440
0:18:19,000 --> 0:18:22,000
And we'll go off and have a conversation on that.

441
0:18:22,000 --> 0:18:25,000
And I now find that bedtime stories

442
0:18:25,000 --> 0:18:27,000
used to be

443
0:18:27,000 --> 0:18:3,000
a box on my to-do list, something that I dreaded,

444
0:18:3,000 --> 0:18:32,000
because it was so slow and I had to get through it quickly.

445
0:18:32,000 --> 0:18:34,000
It's become my reward at the end of the day,

446
0:18:34,000 --> 0:18:36,000
something I really cherish.

447
0:18:36,000 --> 0:18:38,000
And I have a kind of Hollywood ending

448
0:18:38,000 --> 0:18:4,000
to my talk this afternoon,

449
0:18:4,000 --> 0:18:42,000
which goes a little bit like this:

450
0:18:42,000 --> 0:18:45,000
a few months ago, I was getting ready to go on

451
0:18:45,000 --> 0:18:48,000
another book tour, and I had my bags packed.

452
0:18:48,000 --> 0:18:51,000
I was downstairs by the front door, and I was waiting for a taxi,

453
0:18:51,000 --> 0:18:53,000
and my son came down the stairs and

454
0:18:53,000 --> 0:18:55,000
he'd made a card for me. And he was carrying it.

455
0:18:55,000 --> 0:18:57,000
He'd gone and stapled two cards, very like these, together,

456
0:18:57,000 --> 0:19:,000
and put a sticker of his favorite

457
0:19:,000 --> 0:19:02,000
character, Tintin, on the front.

458
0:19:02,000 --> 0:19:04,000
And he said to me,

459
0:19:04,000 --> 0:19:06,000
or he handed this to me, and I read it,

460
0:19:06,000 --> 0:19:08,000
and it said, "To Daddy, love Benjamin."

461
0:19:08,000 --> 0:19:11,000
And I thought, "Aw, that's really sweet.

462
0:19:11,000 --> 0:19:14,000
Is that a good luck on the book tour card?"

463
0:19:14,000 --> 0:19:16,000
And he said, "No, no, no, Daddy -- this is a card

464
0:19:16,000 --> 0:19:18,000
for being the best story reader in the world."

465
0:19:18,000 --> 0:19:21,000
And I thought, "Yeah, you know, this slowing down thing really does work."

466
0:19:21,000 --> 0:19:22,000
Thank you very much.

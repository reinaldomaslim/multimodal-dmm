[This talk contains graphic images Viewer discretion is advised]

2
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I collect objects.

3
0:00:19.64,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I collect branding irons that were used to mark slaves as property.

4
0:00:25.76,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I collect shackles for adults

5
0:00:29.52,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and restraints for adults

6
0:00:31.92,000 --> 0:00:33,000
as well as children.

7
0:00:37.4,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I collect lynching postcards.

8
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Yes, they depict lynchings.

9
0:00:42.28,000 --> 0:00:46,000
They also depict the massive crowds that attended these lynchings,

10
0:00:46.32,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and they are postcards

11
0:00:48.28,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that were also used for correspondence.

12
0:00:52.56,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I collect proslavery books that portray black people as criminals

13
0:00:58.28,000 --> 0:01:,000
or as animals without souls.

14
0:01:02.28,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I brought you something today.

15
0:01:07.8,000 --> 0:01:08,000
This is a ship's branding iron.

16
0:01:10.8,000 --> 0:01:14,000
It was used to mark slaves.

17
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Well, they actually were not slaves when they were marked.

18
0:01:17.76,000 --> 0:01:18,000
They were in Africa.

19
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:21,000
But they were marked with an "S"

20
0:01:21.08,000 --> 0:01:23,000
to designate that they were going to be slaves

21
0:01:23.32,000 --> 0:01:24,000
when they were brought to the US

22
0:01:25.04,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and when they were brought to Europe.

23
0:01:32.32,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Another object or image that captured my imagination when I was younger

24
0:01:35.72,000 --> 0:01:36,000
was a Klan robe.

25
0:01:37.2,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Growing up in South Carolina, I would see Ku Klux Klan rallies occasionally,

26
0:01:41.44,000 --> 0:01:43,000
actually more than occasionally,

27
0:01:43.72,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and the memories of those events never really left my mind.

28
0:01:46.88,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And I didn't really do anything with that imagery until 25 years later.

29
0:01:51.44,000 --> 0:01:53,000
A few years ago, I started researching the Klan,

30
0:01:53.84,000 --> 0:01:54,000
the three distinct waves of the Klan,

31
0:01:56.88,000 --> 0:01:57,000
the second one in particular.

32
0:01:58.36,000 --> 0:02:02,000
The second wave of the Klan had more than five million active members,

33
0:02:03.12,000 --> 0:02:06,000
which was five percent of the population at the time,

34
0:02:06.68,000 --> 0:02:08,000
which was also the population of New York City at the time.

35
0:02:10.72,000 --> 0:02:13,000
The Klan robe factory in the Buckhead neighborhood of Georgia was so busy

36
0:02:14.56,000 --> 0:02:17,000
it became a 24-hour factory to keep up with orders.

37
0:02:18.4,000 --> 0:02:21,000
They kept 20,000 robes on hand at all time to keep up with the demand.

38
0:02:24.4,000 --> 0:02:26,000
As a collector of artifacts and as an artist,

39
0:02:26.92,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I really wanted a Klan robe to be part of my collection,

40
0:02:29.68,000 --> 0:02:32,000
because artifacts and objects tell stories,

41
0:02:33.24,000 --> 0:02:35,000
but I really couldn't find one that was really good quality.

42
0:02:36.92,000 --> 0:02:37,000
What is a black man to do in America

43
0:02:38.8,000 --> 0:02:41,000
when he can't find the quality Klan robe that he's looking for?

44
0:02:41.96,000 --> 0:02:42,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So I had no other choice.

46
0:02:47.28,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I decided I was going to make the best quality Klan robes in America.

47
0:02:53.2,000 --> 0:02:57,000
These are not your traditional Klan robes you would see at any KKK rally.

48
0:02:57.32,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I used kente cloth,

49
0:02:59.56,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I used camouflage,

50
0:03:01.88,000 --> 0:03:05,000
spandex, burlap, silks, satins and different patterns.

51
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I make them for different age groups; I make them for young kids

52
0:03:10.28,000 --> 0:03:11,000
as well as toddlers.

53
0:03:12.8,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I even made one for an infant.

54
0:03:19.56,000 --> 0:03:21,000
After making so many robes,

55
0:03:21.6,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I realized that the policies the Klan had in place

56
0:03:25.68,000 --> 0:03:27,000
or wanted to have in place a hundred years ago

57
0:03:28.04,000 --> 0:03:29,000
are in place today.

58
0:03:30.44,000 --> 0:03:34,000
We have segregated schools, neighborhoods, workplaces,

59
0:03:35.88,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and it's not the people wearing hoods that are keeping these policies in place.

60
0:03:41.08,000 --> 0:03:43,000
My work is about the long-term impact of slavery.

61
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:47,000
We're not just dealing with the residue of systemic racism.

62
0:03:47.36,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It's the basis of every single thing we do.

63
0:03:50.28,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Again we have intentionally segregated neighborhoods,

64
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
workplaces and schools.

65
0:03:56.12,000 --> 0:03:57,000
We have voter suppression.

66
0:03:57.84,000 --> 0:04:02,000
We have disproportionate representation of minorities incarcerated.

67
0:04:03.32,000 --> 0:04:06,000
We have environmental racism. We have police brutality.

68
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I brought you a few things today.

69
0:04:13.4,000 --> 0:04:14,000
The stealth aspect of racism

70
0:04:16.2,000 --> 0:04:17,000
is part of its power.

71
0:04:19.44,000 --> 0:04:2,000
When you're discriminated against,

72
0:04:21.12,000 --> 0:04:23,000
you can't always prove you're being discriminated against.

73
0:04:25.2,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Racism has the power to hide,

74
0:04:28.32,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and when it hides, it's kept safe

75
0:04:31.279,000 --> 0:04:32,000
because it blends in.

76
0:04:34.48,000 --> 0:04:36,000
I created this robe to illustrate that.

77
0:04:38.6,000 --> 0:04:41,000
The basis of capitalism in America is slavery.

78
0:04:46.2,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Slaves were the capital in capitalism.

79
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
The first Grand Wizard in 1868, Nathan Bedford Forrest,

80
0:04:54.44,000 --> 0:04:57,000
was a Confederate soldier and a millionaire slave trader.

81
0:05:07.2,000 --> 0:05:1,000
The wealth that was created from chattel slavery --

82
0:05:10.8,000 --> 0:05:12,000
that's slaves as property -- would boggle the mind.

83
0:05:14.44,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Cotton sales alone in 1860 equalled 200 million dollars.

84
0:05:18.48,000 --> 0:05:21,000
That would equal five billion dollars today.

85
0:05:23.28,000 --> 0:05:27,000
A lot of that wealth can be seen today through generational wealth.

86
0:05:28.32,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Oh, I forgot the other crops as well.

87
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
You have indigo, rice and tobacco.

88
0:05:38.72,000 --> 0:05:42,000
In 2015, I made one robe a week for the entire year.

89
0:05:43.4,000 --> 0:05:45,000
After making 75 robes, I had an epiphany.

90
0:05:45.96,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I have a realization that white supremacy is there,

91
0:05:51.76,000 --> 0:05:54,000
but the biggest force of white supremacy is not the KKK,

92
0:05:55.36,000 --> 0:05:57,000
it's the normalization of systemic racism.

93
0:05:59.28,000 --> 0:06:01,000
There was something else I realized.

94
0:06:01.6,000 --> 0:06:05,000
The robes had no more power over me at all.

95
0:06:05.68,000 --> 0:06:08,000
But if we as a people collectively

96
0:06:09.32,000 --> 0:06:1,000
look at these objects --

97
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
branding irons, shackles, robes --

98
0:06:13.52,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and realize that they are part of our history,

99
0:06:16.52,000 --> 0:06:2,000
we can find a way to where they have no more power over us.

100
0:06:21.92,000 --> 0:06:25,000
If we look at systemic racism and acknowledge

101
0:06:26.28,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that it's sown into the very fabric of who we are as a country,

102
0:06:31.84,000 --> 0:06:34,000
then we can actually do something about the intentional segregation

103
0:06:35.68,000 --> 0:06:39,000
in our schools, neighborhoods and workplaces.

104
0:06:40.52,000 --> 0:06:42,000
But then and only then can we actually address

105
0:06:43.08,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and confront this legacy of slavery

106
0:06:45.76,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and dismantle this ugly legacy of slavery.

107
0:06:49.2,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Thank you very much.

108
0:06:50.48,000 --> 0:06:53,000
(Applause)

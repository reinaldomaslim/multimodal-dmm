1
0:00:12.509,000 --> 0:00:16,000
People say things about religion all the time.

2
0:00:16.736,000 --> 0:00:17,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:18.71,000 --> 0:00:2,000
The late, great Christopher Hitchens

4
0:00:20.96,000 --> 0:00:21,000
wrote a book called "God Is Not Great"

5
0:00:22.381,000 --> 0:00:25,000
whose subtitle was, "Religion Poisons Everything."

6
0:00:25.913,000 --> 0:00:26,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:27.286,000 --> 0:00:31,000
But last month, in Time magazine,

8
0:00:31.38,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Rabbi David Wolpe, who I gather is referred to as America's rabbi,

9
0:00:35.393,000 --> 0:00:39,000
said, to balance that against that negative characterization,

10
0:00:40.031,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that no important form of social change

11
0:00:42.655,000 --> 0:00:46,000
can be brought about except through organized religion.

12
0:00:46.995,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Now, remarks of this sort on the negative

13
0:00:48.973,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and the positive side are very old.

14
0:00:52.01,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I have one in my pocket here

15
0:00:54.451,000 --> 0:00:59,000
from the first century BCE by Lucretius,

16
0:01:00.366,000 --> 0:01:02,000
the author of "On the Nature of Things," who said,

17
0:01:03.229,000 --> 0:01:07,000
"Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum" --

18
0:01:07.512,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I should have been able to learn that by heart —

19
0:01:10.134,000 --> 0:01:12,000
which is, that's how much religion

20
0:01:12.822,000 --> 0:01:14,000
is able to persuade people to do evil,

21
0:01:15.332,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and he was talking about the fact

22
0:01:17.119,000 --> 0:01:2,000
of Agamemnon's decision to place his daughter

23
0:01:20.164,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Iphigenia on an altar of sacrifice

24
0:01:22.075,000 --> 0:01:25,000
in order to preserve the prospects of his army.

25
0:01:25.575,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So there have been these long debates

26
0:01:28.471,000 --> 0:01:29,000
over the centuries, in that case, actually,

27
0:01:30.36,000 --> 0:01:31,000
we can say over the millennia, about religion.

28
0:01:31.946,000 --> 0:01:32,000
People have talked about it a lot,

29
0:01:33.799,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and they've said good and bad

30
0:01:35.597,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and indifferent things about it.

31
0:01:39.106,000 --> 0:01:4,000
What I want to persuade you of today

32
0:01:40.841,000 --> 0:01:41,000
is of a very simple claim,

33
0:01:42.444,000 --> 0:01:44,000
which is that these debates are

34
0:01:44.681,000 --> 0:01:46,000
in a certain sense preposterous,

35
0:01:47.174,000 --> 0:01:51,000
because there is no such thing as religion

36
0:01:51.345,000 --> 0:01:52,000
about which to make these claims.

37
0:01:53.08,000 --> 0:01:54,000
There isn't a thing called religion,

38
0:01:54.468,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and so it can't be good or bad.

39
0:01:57.519,000 --> 0:01:59,000
It can't even be indifferent.

40
0:01:59.68,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And if you think about claims

41
0:02:02.139,000 --> 0:02:05,000
about the nonexistence of things,

42
0:02:06.127,000 --> 0:02:08,000
one obvious way to try and establish

43
0:02:08.319,000 --> 0:02:1,000
the nonexistence of a purported thing

44
0:02:10.771,000 --> 0:02:12,000
would be to offer a definition of that thing

45
0:02:13.229,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and then to see whether anything satisfied it.

46
0:02:15.99,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I'm going to start out on that little route

47
0:02:19.202,000 --> 0:02:2,000
to begin with.

48
0:02:20.411,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So if you look in the dictionaries

49
0:02:22.988,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and if you think about it,

50
0:02:24.138,000 --> 0:02:26,000
one very natural definition of religion

51
0:02:26.507,000 --> 0:02:31,000
is that it involves belief in gods or in spiritual beings.

52
0:02:32.324,000 --> 0:02:33,000
As I say, this is in many dictionaries,

53
0:02:33.83,000 --> 0:02:35,000
but you'll also find it actually

54
0:02:36.581,000 --> 0:02:37,000
in the work of Sir Edward Tylor,

55
0:02:38.208,000 --> 0:02:4,000
who was the first professor of anthropology at Oxford,

56
0:02:40.435,000 --> 0:02:41,000
one of the first modern anthropologists.

57
0:02:42.431,000 --> 0:02:44,000
In his book on primitive culture,

58
0:02:44.665,000 --> 0:02:47,000
he says the heart of religion is what he called animism,

59
0:02:47.685,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that is, the belief in spiritual agency,

60
0:02:49.403,000 --> 0:02:51,000
belief in spirits.

61
0:02:51.78,000 --> 0:02:53,000
The first problem for that definition

62
0:02:53.788,000 --> 0:02:55,000
is from a recent novel by Paul Beatty called "Tuff."

63
0:02:56.528,000 --> 0:02:57,000
There's a guy talking to a rabbi.

64
0:02:57.934,000 --> 0:02:59,000
The rabbi says he doesn't believe in God.

65
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
The guy says, "You're a rabbi, how can you not believe in God?"

66
0:03:02.76,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And the reply is, "It's what's so great about being Jewish.

67
0:03:06.151,000 --> 0:03:07,000
You don't have to believe in a God per se,

68
0:03:08.114,000 --> 0:03:1,000
just in being Jewish." (Laughter)

69
0:03:10.57,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So if this guy is a rabbi, and a Jewish rabbi,

70
0:03:13.598,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and if you have to believe in God in order to be religious,

71
0:03:16.79,000 --> 0:03:19,000
then we have the rather counterintuitive conclusion

72
0:03:20.073,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that since it's possible to be a Jewish rabbi

73
0:03:22.265,000 --> 0:03:23,000
without believing in God,

74
0:03:24.154,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Judaism isn't a religion.

75
0:03:26.504,000 --> 0:03:29,000
That seems like a pretty counterintuitive thought.

76
0:03:29.97,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Here's another argument against this view.

77
0:03:33.231,000 --> 0:03:35,000
A friend of mine, an Indian friend of mine,

78
0:03:35.403,000 --> 0:03:37,000
went to his grandfather when he was very young,

79
0:03:37.586,000 --> 0:03:38,000
a child, and said to him,

80
0:03:38.721,000 --> 0:03:4,000
"I want to talk to you about religion,"

81
0:03:40.84,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and his grandfather said, "You're too young.

82
0:03:42.085,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Come back when you're a teenager."

83
0:03:43.616,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So he came back when he was a teenager,

84
0:03:45.459,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and he said to his grandfather,

85
0:03:47.155,000 --> 0:03:48,000
"It may be a bit late now

86
0:03:48.481,000 --> 0:03:51,000
because I've discovered that I don't believe in the gods."

87
0:03:52.221,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And his grandfather, who was a wise man, said,

88
0:03:54.248,000 --> 0:03:56,000
"Oh, so you belong to the atheist branch

89
0:03:56.432,000 --> 0:03:59,000
of the Hindu tradition." (Laughter)

90
0:03:59.618,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And finally, there's this guy,

91
0:04:03.32,000 --> 0:04:05,000
who famously doesn't believe in God.

92
0:04:05.776,000 --> 0:04:06,000
His name is the Dalai Lama.

93
0:04:07.594,000 --> 0:04:09,000
He often jokes that he's one of the world's leading atheists.

94
0:04:10.242,000 --> 0:04:12,000
But it's true, because the Dalai Lama's religion

95
0:04:13.186,000 --> 0:04:15,000
does not involve belief in God.

96
0:04:15.966,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Now you might think this just shows

97
0:04:17.579,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that I've given you the wrong definition

98
0:04:20.599,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and that I should come up with some other definition

99
0:04:22.718,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and test it against these cases

100
0:04:24.416,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and try and find something that captures

101
0:04:26.987,000 --> 0:04:28,000
atheistic Judaism, atheistic Hinduism,

102
0:04:29.913,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and atheistic Buddhism as forms of religiosity,

103
0:04:33.176,000 --> 0:04:34,000
but I actually think that that's a bad idea,

104
0:04:34.97,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and the reason I think it's a bad idea

105
0:04:37.299,000 --> 0:04:38,000
is that I don't think that's how

106
0:04:38.934,000 --> 0:04:39,000
our concept of religion works.

107
0:04:40.565,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I think the way our concept of religion works

108
0:04:42.165,000 --> 0:04:45,000
is that we actually have, we have a list

109
0:04:45.203,000 --> 0:04:46,000
of paradigm religions

110
0:04:47.129,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and their sub-parts, right,

111
0:04:50.368,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and if something new comes along

112
0:04:52.922,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that purports to be a religion,

113
0:04:54.428,000 --> 0:04:56,000
what we ask is, "Well, is it like one of these?"

114
0:04:56.892,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Right?

115
0:04:59.144,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And I think that's not only how we think about religion,

116
0:05:01.719,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and that's, as it were,

117
0:05:03.019,000 --> 0:05:04,000
so from our point of view,

118
0:05:04.81,000 --> 0:05:06,000
anything on that list had better be a religion,

119
0:05:06.893,000 --> 0:05:07,000
which is why I don't think an account of religion

120
0:05:08.661,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that excludes Buddhism and Judaism

121
0:05:10.516,000 --> 0:05:12,000
has a chance of being a good starter,

122
0:05:13.216,000 --> 0:05:15,000
because they're on our list.

123
0:05:15.92,000 --> 0:05:16,000
But why do we have such a list?

124
0:05:17.9,000 --> 0:05:18,000
What's going on? How did it come about

125
0:05:19.73,000 --> 0:05:21,000
that we have this list?

126
0:05:21.917,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I think the answer is a pretty simple one

127
0:05:24.832,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and therefore crude and contentious.

128
0:05:27.96,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with it,

129
0:05:29.349,000 --> 0:05:3,000
but here's my story,

130
0:05:30.943,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and true or not, it's a story that I think

131
0:05:33.314,000 --> 0:05:35,000
gives you a good sense of how

132
0:05:35.742,000 --> 0:05:36,000
the list might have come about,

133
0:05:37.431,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and therefore helps you to think about

134
0:05:38.74,000 --> 0:05:39,000
what use the list might be.

135
0:05:40.184,000 --> 0:05:43,000
I think the answer is, European travelers,

136
0:05:43.472,000 --> 0:05:44,000
starting roughly about the time of Columbus,

137
0:05:45.305,000 --> 0:05:46,000
started going around the world.

138
0:05:46.93,000 --> 0:05:48,000
They came from a Christian culture,

139
0:05:49.21,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and when they arrived in a new place,

140
0:05:51.02,000 --> 0:05:53,000
they noticed that some people didn't have Christianity,

141
0:05:53.905,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and so they asked themselves the following question:

142
0:05:55.95,000 --> 0:05:58,000
what have they got instead of Christianity?

143
0:05:59.14,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And that list was essentially constructed.

144
0:06:02.503,000 --> 0:06:04,000
It consists of the things that other people had

145
0:06:04.779,000 --> 0:06:06,000
instead of Christianity.

146
0:06:07.37,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Now there's a difficulty with proceeding in that way,

147
0:06:10.738,000 --> 0:06:12,000
which is that Christianity is extremely,

148
0:06:13.178,000 --> 0:06:17,000
even on that list, it's an extremely specific tradition.

149
0:06:17.59,000 --> 0:06:18,000
It has all kinds of things in it

150
0:06:19.151,000 --> 0:06:21,000
that are very, very particular

151
0:06:21.277,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that are the results of the specifics

152
0:06:23.573,000 --> 0:06:25,000
of Christian history,

153
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and one thing that's at the heart of it,

154
0:06:27.857,000 --> 0:06:29,000
one thing that's at the heart of most understandings of Christianity,

155
0:06:30.66,000 --> 0:06:32,000
which is the result of the specific history of Christianity,

156
0:06:32.99,000 --> 0:06:35,000
is that it's an extremely creedal religion.

157
0:06:36.133,000 --> 0:06:38,000
It's a religion in which people are really concerned

158
0:06:38.813,000 --> 0:06:4,000
about whether you believe the right things.

159
0:06:41.552,000 --> 0:06:43,000
The history of Christianity, the internal history of Christianity,

160
0:06:43.808,000 --> 0:06:44,000
is largely the history of people killing each other

161
0:06:45.684,000 --> 0:06:47,000
because they believed the wrong thing,

162
0:06:47.8,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and it's also involved in

163
0:06:49.879,000 --> 0:06:5,000
struggles with other religions,

164
0:06:51.631,000 --> 0:06:54,000
obviously starting in the Middle Ages,

165
0:06:55.23,000 --> 0:06:56,000
a struggle with Islam,

166
0:06:56.62,000 --> 0:06:59,000
in which, again, it was the infidelity,

167
0:06:59.74,000 --> 0:07:01,000
the fact that they didn't believe the right things,

168
0:07:01.77,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that seemed so offensive to the Christian world.

169
0:07:05.15,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Now that's a very specific and particular history

170
0:07:07.788,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that Christianity has,

171
0:07:10.153,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and not everywhere is everything

172
0:07:13.371,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that has ever been put on this sort of list like it.

173
0:07:17.365,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Here's another problem, I think.

174
0:07:18.772,000 --> 0:07:19,000
A very specific thing happened.

175
0:07:20.11,000 --> 0:07:21,000
It was actually adverted to earlier,

176
0:07:21.562,000 --> 0:07:22,000
but a very specific thing happened

177
0:07:23.103,000 --> 0:07:25,000
in the history of the kind of Christianity

178
0:07:25.292,000 --> 0:07:26,000
that we see around us

179
0:07:26.813,000 --> 0:07:28,000
mostly in the United States today,

180
0:07:28.997,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and it happened in the late 19th century,

181
0:07:32.1,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and that specific thing that happened

182
0:07:33.509,000 --> 0:07:34,000
in the late 19th century

183
0:07:34.518,000 --> 0:07:36,000
was a kind of deal that was cut

184
0:07:37.473,000 --> 0:07:39,000
between science,

185
0:07:39.983,000 --> 0:07:44,000
this new way of organizing intellectual authority,

186
0:07:45.676,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and religion.

187
0:07:46.873,000 --> 0:07:47,000
If you think about the 18th century, say,

188
0:07:48.764,000 --> 0:07:49,000
if you think about intellectual life

189
0:07:50.234,000 --> 0:07:52,000
before the late 19th century,

190
0:07:52.59,000 --> 0:07:55,000
anything you did, anything you thought about,

191
0:07:55.76,000 --> 0:07:57,000
whether it was the physical world,

192
0:07:58.49,000 --> 0:07:59,000
the human world,

193
0:08:00.021,000 --> 0:08:02,000
the natural world apart from the human world,

194
0:08:02.251,000 --> 0:08:03,000
or morality, anything you did

195
0:08:04.218,000 --> 0:08:05,000
would have been framed against the background

196
0:08:05.894,000 --> 0:08:07,000
of a set of assumptions that were religious,

197
0:08:08.357,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Christian assumptions.

198
0:08:09.56,000 --> 0:08:1,000
You couldn't give an account

199
0:08:11.226,000 --> 0:08:12,000
of the natural world

200
0:08:12.822,000 --> 0:08:14,000
that didn't say something about its relationship,

201
0:08:15.744,000 --> 0:08:16,000
for example, to the creation story

202
0:08:17.552,000 --> 0:08:18,000
in the Abrahamic tradition,

203
0:08:19.092,000 --> 0:08:22,000
the creation story in the first book of the Torah.

204
0:08:22.296,000 --> 0:08:25,000
So everything was framed in that way.

205
0:08:25.613,000 --> 0:08:27,000
But this changes in the late 19th century,

206
0:08:28.045,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and for the first time, it's possible for people

207
0:08:30.37,000 --> 0:08:32,000
to develop serious intellectual careers

208
0:08:32.749,000 --> 0:08:34,000
as natural historians like Darwin.

209
0:08:34.943,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Darwin worried about the relationship between

210
0:08:36.928,000 --> 0:08:38,000
what he said and the truths of religion,

211
0:08:39.481,000 --> 0:08:4,000
but he could proceed, he could write books

212
0:08:41.406,000 --> 0:08:42,000
about his subject

213
0:08:43.19,000 --> 0:08:45,000
without having to say what the relationship was

214
0:08:45.886,000 --> 0:08:46,000
to the religious claims,

215
0:08:47.358,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and similarly, geologists increasingly could talk about it.

216
0:08:49.74,000 --> 0:08:5,000
In the early 19th century, if you were a geologist

217
0:08:51.542,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and made a claim about the age of the Earth,

218
0:08:53.465,000 --> 0:08:54,000
you had to explain whether that was consistent

219
0:08:55.107,000 --> 0:08:56,000
or how it was or wasn't consistent

220
0:08:56.537,000 --> 0:08:57,000
with the age of the Earth implied

221
0:08:57.909,000 --> 0:08:58,000
by the account in Genesis.

222
0:08:59.462,000 --> 0:09:,000
By the end of the 19th century,

223
0:09:00.647,000 --> 0:09:01,000
you can just write a geology textbook

224
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
in which you make arguments about how old the Earth is.

225
0:09:04.519,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So there's a big change, and that division,

226
0:09:06.61,000 --> 0:09:08,000
that intellectual division of labor occurs as I say, I think,

227
0:09:09.545,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and it sort of solidifies so that by the end

228
0:09:12.37,000 --> 0:09:15,000
of the 19th century in Europe,

229
0:09:15.528,000 --> 0:09:16,000
there's a real intellectual division of labor,

230
0:09:17.519,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and you can do all sorts of serious things,

231
0:09:19.519,000 --> 0:09:22,000
including, increasingly, even philosophy,

232
0:09:23.421,000 --> 0:09:25,000
without being constrained by the thought,

233
0:09:26.279,000 --> 0:09:28,000
"Well, what I have to say has to be consistent

234
0:09:28.56,000 --> 0:09:3,000
with the deep truths that are given to me

235
0:09:31.239,000 --> 0:09:33,000
by our religious tradition."

236
0:09:33.749,000 --> 0:09:35,000
So imagine someone who's coming out

237
0:09:35.913,000 --> 0:09:38,000
of that world, that late-19th-century world,

238
0:09:39.73,000 --> 0:09:42,000
coming into the country that I grew up in, Ghana,

239
0:09:43.482,000 --> 0:09:45,000
the society that I grew up in, Asante,

240
0:09:45.742,000 --> 0:09:46,000
coming into that world

241
0:09:47.148,000 --> 0:09:49,000
at the turn of the 20th century

242
0:09:49.164,000 --> 0:09:51,000
with this question that made the list:

243
0:09:51.187,000 --> 0:09:54,000
what have they got instead of Christianity?

244
0:09:54.95,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Well, here's one thing he would have noticed,

245
0:09:57.807,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and by the way, there was a person who actually did this.

246
0:10:00.151,000 --> 0:10:01,000
His name was Captain Rattray,

247
0:10:01.45,000 --> 0:10:03,000
he was sent as the British government anthropologist,

248
0:10:03.502,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and he wrote a book about Asante religion.

249
0:10:05.495,000 --> 0:10:07,000
This is a soul disc.

250
0:10:08.035,000 --> 0:10:1,000
There are many of them in the British Museum.

251
0:10:10.308,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I could give you an interesting, different history

252
0:10:11.578,000 --> 0:10:13,000
of how it comes about that many of the things

253
0:10:13.743,000 --> 0:10:16,000
from my society ended up in the British Museum,

254
0:10:17.134,000 --> 0:10:18,000
but we don't have time for that.

255
0:10:18.945,000 --> 0:10:19,000
So this object is a soul disc.

256
0:10:20.437,000 --> 0:10:21,000
What is a soul disc?

257
0:10:21.575,000 --> 0:10:22,000
It was worn around the necks

258
0:10:23.404,000 --> 0:10:25,000
of the soul-washers of the Asante king.

259
0:10:25.974,000 --> 0:10:28,000
What was their job? To wash the king's soul.

260
0:10:29.529,000 --> 0:10:3,000
It would take a long while

261
0:10:31.434,000 --> 0:10:33,000
to explain how a soul could be the kind of thing

262
0:10:33.661,000 --> 0:10:34,000
that could be washed,

263
0:10:34.961,000 --> 0:10:36,000
but Rattray knew that this was religion

264
0:10:37.74,000 --> 0:10:4,000
because souls were in play.

265
0:10:41.243,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And similarly,

266
0:10:42.989,000 --> 0:10:44,000
there were many other things, many other practices.

267
0:10:45.196,000 --> 0:10:47,000
For example, every time anybody had a drink, more or less,

268
0:10:47.559,000 --> 0:10:49,000
they poured a little bit on the ground

269
0:10:49.581,000 --> 0:10:5,000
in what's called the libation,

270
0:10:51.31,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and they gave some to the ancestors.

271
0:10:52.999,000 --> 0:10:54,000
My father did this. Every time he opened a bottle of whiskey,

272
0:10:55.348,000 --> 0:10:56,000
which I'm glad to say was very often,

273
0:10:56.869,000 --> 0:10:59,000
he would take the top off and pour off just a little on the ground,

274
0:11:00.748,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and he would talk to,

275
0:11:02.099,000 --> 0:11:05,000
he would say to Akroma-Ampim, the founder of our line,

276
0:11:05.639,000 --> 0:11:06,000
or Yao Antony, my great uncle,

277
0:11:07.235,000 --> 0:11:08,000
he would talk to them,

278
0:11:09.13,000 --> 0:11:11,000
offer them a little bit of this.

279
0:11:11.353,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And finally, there were these huge public ceremonials.

280
0:11:14.238,000 --> 0:11:15,000
This is an early-19th-century drawing

281
0:11:15.654,000 --> 0:11:16,000
by another British military officer

282
0:11:16.927,000 --> 0:11:18,000
of such a ceremonial,

283
0:11:18.977,000 --> 0:11:2,000
where the king was involved,

284
0:11:21.105,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and the king's job,

285
0:11:22.511,000 --> 0:11:23,000
one of the large parts of his job,

286
0:11:23.7,000 --> 0:11:25,000
apart from organizing warfare and things like that,

287
0:11:26.651,000 --> 0:11:29,000
was to look after the tombs of his ancestors,

288
0:11:29.997,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and when a king died,

289
0:11:31.994,000 --> 0:11:32,000
the stool that he sat on was blackened

290
0:11:33.508,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and put in the royal ancestral temple,

291
0:11:36.392,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and every 40 days,

292
0:11:38.521,000 --> 0:11:39,000
the King of Asante has to go and do cult

293
0:11:40.376,000 --> 0:11:41,000
for his ancestors.

294
0:11:41.738,000 --> 0:11:42,000
That's a large part of his job,

295
0:11:43.24,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and people think that if he doesn't do it,

296
0:11:45.113,000 --> 0:11:46,000
things will fall apart.

297
0:11:46.844,000 --> 0:11:48,000
So he's a religious figure,

298
0:11:49.21,000 --> 0:11:5,000
as Rattray would have said,

299
0:11:50.535,000 --> 0:11:52,000
as well as a political figure.

300
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
So all this would count as religion for Rattray,

301
0:11:57.844,000 --> 0:11:58,000
but my point is that when you look

302
0:11:59.783,000 --> 0:12:,000
into the lives of those people,

303
0:12:01.165,000 --> 0:12:03,000
you also find that every time they do anything,

304
0:12:03.91,000 --> 0:12:05,000
they're conscious of the ancestors.

305
0:12:05.944,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Every morning at breakfast,

306
0:12:07.977,000 --> 0:12:08,000
you can go outside the front of the house

307
0:12:09.803,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and make an offering to the god tree, the nyame dua

308
0:12:12.899,000 --> 0:12:13,000
outside your house,

309
0:12:14.083,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and again, you'll talk to the gods

310
0:12:15.4,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and the high gods and the low gods

311
0:12:16.426,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and the ancestors and so on.

312
0:12:18.084,000 --> 0:12:19,000
This is not a world

313
0:12:19.62,000 --> 0:12:21,000
in which the separation between religion and science

314
0:12:22.527,000 --> 0:12:23,000
has occurred.

315
0:12:24.101,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Religion has not being separated

316
0:12:25.644,000 --> 0:12:26,000
from any other areas of life,

317
0:12:26.92,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and in particular,

318
0:12:28.917,000 --> 0:12:29,000
what's crucial to understand about this world

319
0:12:30.612,000 --> 0:12:31,000
is that it's a world in which the job

320
0:12:32.15,000 --> 0:12:33,000
that science does for us

321
0:12:33.288,000 --> 0:12:36,000
is done by what Rattray is going to call religion,

322
0:12:36.432,000 --> 0:12:37,000
because if they want an explanation of something,

323
0:12:38.372,000 --> 0:12:39,000
if they want to know why the crop just failed,

324
0:12:40.2,000 --> 0:12:41,000
if they want to know why it's raining

325
0:12:41.486,000 --> 0:12:43,000
or not raining, if they need rain,

326
0:12:43.904,000 --> 0:12:45,000
if they want to know why

327
0:12:46.428,000 --> 0:12:47,000
their grandfather has died,

328
0:12:48.287,000 --> 0:12:5,000
they are going to appeal to the very same entities,

329
0:12:51.195,000 --> 0:12:52,000
the very same language,

330
0:12:52.637,000 --> 0:12:54,000
talk to the very same gods about that.

331
0:12:55.253,000 --> 0:12:57,000
This great separation, in other words,

332
0:12:57.342,000 --> 0:12:58,000
between religion and science hasn't happened.

333
0:12:59.273,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Now, this would be a mere historical curiosity,

334
0:13:03.598,000 --> 0:13:06,000
except that in large parts of the world,

335
0:13:07.05,000 --> 0:13:09,000
this is still the truth.

336
0:13:09.794,000 --> 0:13:11,000
I had the privilege of going to a wedding

337
0:13:11.802,000 --> 0:13:12,000
the other day in northern Namibia,

338
0:13:13.567,000 --> 0:13:15,000
20 miles or so south of the Angolan border

339
0:13:16.412,000 --> 0:13:17,000
in a village of 200 people.

340
0:13:18.145,000 --> 0:13:19,000
These were modern people.

341
0:13:19.313,000 --> 0:13:2,000
We had with us Oona Chaplin,

342
0:13:21.204,000 --> 0:13:22,000
who some of you may have heard of,

343
0:13:22.613,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and one of the people from this village came up to her,

344
0:13:24.692,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and said, "I've seen you in 'Game of Thrones.'"

345
0:13:27.423,000 --> 0:13:3,000
So these were not people who were isolated from our world,

346
0:13:31.251,000 --> 0:13:32,000
but nevertheless, for them,

347
0:13:32.78,000 --> 0:13:34,000
the gods and the spirits are still very much there,

348
0:13:35.333,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and when we were on the bus going back and forth

349
0:13:37.159,000 --> 0:13:38,000
to the various parts of the [ceremony],

350
0:13:38.821,000 --> 0:13:4,000
they prayed not just in a generic way

351
0:13:41.398,000 --> 0:13:42,000
but for the safety of the journey,

352
0:13:42.859,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and they meant it,

353
0:13:43.77,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and when they said to me that my mother,

354
0:13:46.932,000 --> 0:13:47,000
the bridegroom's [grandmother],

355
0:13:48.623,000 --> 0:13:5,000
was with us, they didn't mean it figuratively.

356
0:13:51.185,000 --> 0:13:53,000
They meant, even though she was a dead person,

357
0:13:53.94,000 --> 0:13:55,000
they meant that she was still around.

358
0:13:56.518,000 --> 0:13:58,000
So in large parts of the world today,

359
0:13:59.067,000 --> 0:14:01,000
that separation between science and religion

360
0:14:01.229,000 --> 0:14:02,000
hasn't occurred in large parts of the world today,

361
0:14:02.91,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and as I say, these are not --

362
0:14:06.638,000 --> 0:14:1,000
This guy used to work for Chase and at the World Bank.

363
0:14:11.44,000 --> 0:14:13,000
These are fellow citizens of the world with you,

364
0:14:14.147,000 --> 0:14:15,000
but they come from a place in which religion

365
0:14:15.956,000 --> 0:14:16,000
is occupying a very different role.

366
0:14:17.867,000 --> 0:14:19,000
So what I want you to think about next time somebody wants

367
0:14:19.993,000 --> 0:14:21,000
to make some vast generalization about religion

368
0:14:22.473,000 --> 0:14:24,000
is that maybe there isn't such a thing

369
0:14:25.214,000 --> 0:14:27,000
as a religion, such a thing as religion,

370
0:14:27.845,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and that therefore what they say

371
0:14:29.501,000 --> 0:14:31,000
cannot possibly be true.

372
0:14:32.314,000 --> 0:14:35,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
You all know the truth of what I'm going to say.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
has been around since before the French Revolution.

4
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
What's changed

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
is we now can look at the evidence,

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
we can compare societies, more and less equal societies,

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and see what inequality does.

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I'm going to take you through that data

9
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and then explain why

10
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
the links I'm going to be showing you exist.

11
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But first, see what a miserable lot we are.

12
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I want to start though

14
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
with a paradox.

15
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
This shows you life expectancy

16
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
against gross national income --

17
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
how rich countries are on average.

18
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And you see the countries on the right,

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
like Norway and the USA,

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.

21
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all.

22
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
There's no suggestion of a relationship there.

23
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
But if we look within our societies,

24
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
there are extraordinary social gradients in health

25
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
running right across society.

26
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
This, again, is life expectancy.

27
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
These are small areas of England and Wales --

28
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.

29
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
A lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us.

30
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Even the people just below the top

31
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
have less good health

32
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
than the people at the top.

33
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
So income means something very important

34
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
within our societies,

35
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and nothing between them.

36
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
The explanation of that paradox

37
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
is that, within our societies,

38
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
we're looking at relative income

39
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
or social position, social status --

40
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
where we are in relation to each other

41
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and the size of the gaps between us.

42
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And as soon as you've got that idea,

43
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
you should immediately wonder:

44
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
what happens if we widen the differences,

45
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
or compress them,

46
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
make the income differences bigger or smaller?

47
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And that's what I'm going to show you.

48
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I'm not using any hypothetical data.

49
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I'm taking data from the U.N. --

50
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
it's the same as the World Bank has --

51
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
on the scale of income differences

52
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
in these rich developed market democracies.

53
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
The measure we've used,

54
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
because it's easy to understand and you can download it,

55
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
is how much richer the top 20 percent

56
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
than the bottom 20 percent in each country.

57
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And you see in the more equal countries on the left --

58
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden --

59
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
the top 20 percent are about three and a half, four times as rich

60
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
as the bottom 20 percent.

61
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
But on the more unequal end --

62
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
U.K., Portugal, USA, Singapore --

63
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
the differences are twice as big.

64
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
On that measure, we are twice as unequal

65
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
as some of the other successful market democracies.

66
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Now I'm going to show you what that does to our societies.

67
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
We collected data on problems with social gradients,

68
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
the kind of problems that are more common

69
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
at the bottom of the social ladder.

70
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Internationally comparable data on life expectancy,

71
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
on kids' maths and literacy scores,

72
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
on infant mortality rates, homicide rates,

73
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
proportion of the population in prison, teenage birthrates,

74
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
levels of trust,

75
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
obesity, mental illness --

76
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
which in standard diagnostic classification

77
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
includes drug and alcohol addiction --

78
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and social mobility.

79
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We put them all in one index.

80
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
They're all weighted equally.

81
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Where a country is is a sort of average score on these things.

82
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And there, you see it

83
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
in relation to the measure of inequality I've just shown you,

84
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
which I shall use over and over again in the data.

85
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
The more unequal countries

86
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
are doing worse

87
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
on all these kinds of social problems.

88
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
It's an extraordinarily close correlation.

89
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
But if you look at that same index

90
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
of health and social problems

91
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
in relation to GNP per capita,

92
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
gross national income,

93
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
there's nothing there,

94
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
no correlation anymore.

95
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
We were a little bit worried

96
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that people might think

97
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
we'd been choosing problems to suit our argument

98
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and just manufactured this evidence,

99
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
so we also did a paper in the British Medical Journal

100
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
on the UNICEF index of child well-being.

101
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It has 40 different components

102
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
put together by other people.

103
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
It contains whether kids can talk to their parents,

104
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
whether they have books at home,

105
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
what immunization rates are like, whether there's bullying at school.

106
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Everything goes into it.

107
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality.

108
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Kids do worse in the more unequal societies.

109
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Highly significant relationship.

110
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
But once again,

111
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
if you look at that measure of child well-being,

112
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
in relation to national income per person,

113
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
there's no relationship,

114
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
no suggestion of a relationship.

115
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
What all the data I've shown you so far says

116
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
is the same thing.

117
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
The average well-being of our societies

118
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
is not dependent any longer

119
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
on national income and economic growth.

120
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
That's very important in poorer countries,

121
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
but not in the rich developed world.

122
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But the differences between us

123
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and where we are in relation to each other

124
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
now matter very much.

125
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I'm going to show you some of the separate bits of our index.

126
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Here, for instance, is trust.

127
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
It's simply the proportion of the population

128
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
who agree most people can be trusted.

129
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
It comes from the World Values Survey.

130
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
You see, at the more unequal end,

131
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
it's about 15 percent of the population

132
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
who feel they can trust others.

133
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
But in the more equal societies,

134
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
it rises to 60 or 65 percent.

135
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And if you look at measures of involvement in community life

136
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
or social capital,

137
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
very similar relationships

138
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
closely related to inequality.

139
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I may say, we did all this work twice.

140
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
We did it first on these rich, developed countries,

141
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and then as a separate test bed,

142
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
we repeated it all on the 50 American states --

143
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
asking just the same question:

144
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
do the more unequal states

145
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
do worse on all these kinds of measures?

146
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
So here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government

147
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
related to inequality.

148
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Very similar scatter

149
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
over a similar range of levels of trust.

150
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Same thing is going on.

151
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Basically we found

152
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
that almost anything that's related to trust internationally

153
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
is related to trust amongst the 50 states

154
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
in that separate test bed.

155
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
We're not just talking about a fluke.

156
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
This is mental illness.

157
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
WHO put together figures

158
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
using the same diagnostic interviews

159
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
on random samples of the population

160
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
to allow us to compare rates of mental illness

161
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
in each society.

162
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
This is the percent of the population

163
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
with any mental illness in the preceding year.

164
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And it goes from about eight percent

165
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
up to three times that --

166
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
whole societies

167
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
with three times the level of mental illness of others.

168
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And again, closely related to inequality.

169
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
This is violence.

170
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
These red dots are American states,

171
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.

172
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
But look at the scale of the differences.

173
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
It goes from 15 homicides per million

174
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
up to 150.

175
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
This is the proportion of the population in prison.

176
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
There's a about a tenfold difference there,

177
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
log scale up the side.

178
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
But it goes from about 40 to 400

179
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
people in prison.

180
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
That relationship

181
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
is not mainly driven by more crime.

182
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
In some places, that's part of it.

183
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
But most of it is about more punitive sentencing,

184
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
harsher sentencing.

185
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
And the more unequal societies

186
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
are more likely also to retain the death penalty.

187
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Here we have children dropping out of high school.

188
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Again, quite big differences.

189
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Extraordinarily damaging,

190
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
if you're talking about using the talents of the population.

191
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
This is social mobility.

192
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
It's actually a measure of mobility

193
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
based on income.

194
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Basically, it's asking:

195
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
do rich fathers have rich sons

196
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and poor fathers have poor sons,

197
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
or is there no relationship between the two?

198
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And at the more unequal end,

199
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
fathers' income is much more important --

200
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
in the U.K., USA.

201
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And in Scandinavian countries,

202
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
fathers' income is much less important.

203
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
There's more social mobility.

204
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And as we like to say --

205
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience here --

206
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
if Americans want to live the American dream,

207
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
they should go to Denmark.

208
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
(Laughter)

209
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Applause)

210
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I've shown you just a few things in italics here.

211
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
I could have shown a number of other problems.

212
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
They're all problems that tend to be more common

213
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
at the bottom of the social gradient.

214
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
But there are endless problems with social gradients

215
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
that are worse in more unequal countries --

216
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
not just a little bit worse,

217
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
but anything from twice as common to 10 times as common.

218
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Think of the expense,

219
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
the human cost of that.

220
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
I want to go back though to this graph that I showed you earlier

221
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
where we put it all together

222
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
to make two points.

223
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
One is that, in graph after graph,

224
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
we find the countries that do worse,

225
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
whatever the outcome,

226
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
seem to be the more unequal ones,

227
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and the ones that do well

228
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.

229
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
So what we're looking at

230
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
is general social disfunction related to inequality.

231
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
It's not just one or two things that go wrong,

232
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
it's most things.

233
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
The other really important point I want to make on this graph

234
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
is that, if you look at the bottom,

235
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Sweden and Japan,

236
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
they're very different countries in all sorts of ways.

237
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
The position of women,

238
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
how closely they keep to the nuclear family,

239
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
are on opposite ends of the poles

240
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
in terms of the rich developed world.

241
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
But another really important difference

242
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
is how they get their greater equality.

243
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Sweden has huge differences in earnings,

244
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and it narrows the gap through taxation,

245
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
general welfare state,

246
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
generous benefits and so on.

247
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Japan is rather different though.

248
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
It starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax.

249
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
It has lower taxes.

250
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
It has a smaller welfare state.

251
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And in our analysis of the American states,

252
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
we find rather the same contrast.

253
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
There are some states that do well through redistribution,

254
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
some states that do well

255
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
because they have smaller income differences before tax.

256
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So we conclude

257
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
that it doesn't much matter how you get your greater equality,

258
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
as long as you get there somehow.

259
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
I am not talking about perfect equality,

260
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
I'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies.

261
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Another really surprising part of this picture

262
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
is that it's not just the poor

263
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
who are affected by inequality.

264
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
There seems to be some truth in John Donne's

265
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
"No man is an island."

266
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And in a number of studies, it's possible to compare

267
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
how people do in more and less equal countries

268
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
at each level in the social hierarchy.

269
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
This is just one example.

270
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
It's infant mortality.

271
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Some Swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths

272
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
according to the British register of general socioeconomic classification.

273
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And so it's anachronistically

274
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
a classification by fathers' occupations,

275
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
so single parents go on their own.

276
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
But then where it says "low social class,"

277
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that's unskilled manual occupations.

278
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
It goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle,

279
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
then the junior non-manual,

280
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
going up high to the professional occupations --

281
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
doctors, lawyers,

282
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
directors of larger companies.

283
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
You see there that Sweden does better than Britain

284
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
all the way across the social hierarchy.

285
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
The biggest differences are at the bottom of society.

286
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
But even at the top,

287
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
there seems to be a small benefit

288
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
to being in a more equal society.

289
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
We show that on about five different sets of data

290
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
covering educational outcomes

291
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and health in the United States and internationally.

292
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And that seems to be the general picture --

293
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom,

294
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
but has some benefits even at the top.

295
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
But I should say a few words about what's going on.

296
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
I think I'm looking and talking

297
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
about the psychosocial effects of inequality.

298
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
More to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority,

299
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
of being valued and devalued,

300
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
respected and disrespected.

301
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And of course, those feelings

302
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
of the status competition that comes out of that

303
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
drives the consumerism in our society.

304
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
It also leads to status insecurity.

305
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
We worry more about how we're judged and seen by others,

306
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
whether we're regarded as attractive, clever,

307
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
all that kind of thing.

308
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
The social-evaluative judgments increase,

309
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
the fear of those social-evaluative judgments.

310
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Interestingly,

311
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
some parallel work going on in social psychology:

312
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
some people reviewed 208 different studies

313
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
in which volunteers had been invited

314
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
into a psychological laboratory

315
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and had their stress hormones,

316
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
their responses to doing stressful tasks, measured.

317
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And in the review,

318
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
what they were interested in seeing

319
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
is what kind of stresses

320
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
most reliably raise levels of cortisol,

321
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
the central stress hormone.

322
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And the conclusion was

323
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
it was tasks that included social-evaluative threat --

324
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
threats to self-esteem or social status

325
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
in which others can negatively judge your performance.

326
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Those kind of stresses

327
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
have a very particular effect

328
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
on the physiology of stress.

329
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Now we have been criticized.

330
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Of course, there are people who dislike this stuff

331
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and people who find it very surprising.

332
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
I should tell you though

333
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data,

334
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
we never pick and choose data.

335
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
We have an absolute rule

336
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
that if our data source has data for one of the countries we're looking at,

337
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
it goes into the analysis.

338
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Our data source decides

339
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
whether it's reliable data,

340
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
we don't.

341
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Otherwise that would introduce bias.

342
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
What about other countries?

343
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
There are 200 studies

344
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
of health in relation to income and equality

345
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
in the academic peer-reviewed journals.

346
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
This isn't confined to these countries here,

347
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
hiding a very simple demonstration.

348
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
The same countries,

349
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
the same measure of inequality,

350
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
one problem after another.

351
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Why don't we control for other factors?

352
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Well we've shown you that GNP per capita

353
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
doesn't make any difference.

354
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
And of course, others using more sophisticated methods in the literature

355
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
have controlled for poverty and education

356
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
and so on.

357
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
What about causality?

358
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Correlation in itself doesn't prove causality.

359
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
We spend a good bit of time.

360
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
And indeed, people know the causal links quite well

361
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
in some of these outcomes.

362
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
The big change in our understanding

363
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
of drivers of chronic health

364
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
in the rich developed world

365
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
is how important chronic stress from social sources

366
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
is affecting the immune system,

367
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
the cardiovascular system.

368
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Or for instance, the reason why violence

369
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
becomes more common in more unequal societies

370
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
is because people are sensitive to being looked down on.

371
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
I should say that to deal with this,

372
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
we've got to deal with the post-tax things

373
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
and the pre-tax things.

374
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
We've got to constrain income,

375
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
the bonus culture incomes at the top.

376
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
I think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees

377
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
in any way we can.

378
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
I think the take-home message though

379
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
is that we can improve the real quality of human life

380
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
by reducing the differences in incomes between us.

381
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
Suddenly we have a handle

382
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
on the psychosocial well-being of whole societies,

383
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and that's exciting.

384
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
Thank you.

385
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
(Applause)

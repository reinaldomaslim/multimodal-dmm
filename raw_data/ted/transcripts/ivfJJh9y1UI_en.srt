1
0:00:12.56,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Jenni Chang: When I told my parents I was gay,

2
0:00:14.88,000 --> 0:00:16,000
the first thing they said to me was,

3
0:00:17.08,000 --> 0:00:19,000
"We're bringing you back to Taiwan."

4
0:00:19.32,000 --> 0:00:2,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:22,000 --> 0:00:25,000
In their minds, my sexual orientation was America's fault.

6
0:00:25.88,000 --> 0:00:27,000
The West had corrupted me with divergent ideas,

7
0:00:28.84,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and if only my parents had never left Taiwan,

8
0:00:31.84,000 --> 0:00:34,000
this would not have happened to their only daughter.

9
0:00:35.32,000 --> 0:00:38,000
In truth, I wondered if they were right.

10
0:00:38.44,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Of course, there are gay people in Asia,

11
0:00:40.52,000 --> 0:00:43,000
just as there are gay people in every part of the world.

12
0:00:43.76,000 --> 0:00:45,000
But is the idea of living an "out" life,

13
0:00:46.72,000 --> 0:00:49,000
in the "I'm gay, this is my spouse, and we're proud of our lives together"

14
0:00:50.4,000 --> 0:00:53,000
kind of way just a Western idea?

15
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
If I had grown up in Taiwan, or any place outside of the West,

16
0:00:58.88,000 --> 0:01:03,000
would I have found models of happy, thriving LGBT people?

17
0:01:03.96,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Lisa Dazols: I had similar notions.

18
0:01:05.651,000 --> 0:01:07,000
As an HIV social worker in San Francisco,

19
0:01:07.88,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I had met many gay immigrants.

20
0:01:09.88,000 --> 0:01:12,000
They told me their stories of persecution in their home countries,

21
0:01:13.08,000 --> 0:01:14,000
just for being gay,

22
0:01:14.6,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and the reasons why they escaped to the US.

23
0:01:17.08,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I saw how this had beaten them down.

24
0:01:19.24,000 --> 0:01:21,000
After 10 years of doing this kind of work,

25
0:01:21.28,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I needed better stories for myself.

26
0:01:23.76,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I knew the world was far from perfect,

27
0:01:25.8,000 --> 0:01:27,000
but surely not every gay story was tragic.

28
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
JC: So as a couple, we both had a need to find stories of hope.

29
0:01:32.8,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So we set off on a mission to travel the world

30
0:01:35.76,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and look for the people we finally termed as the "Supergays."

31
0:01:39.64,000 --> 0:01:42,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:43.76,000 --> 0:01:45,000
These would be the LGBT individuals

33
0:01:46.24,000 --> 0:01:49,000
who were doing something extraordinary in the world.

34
0:01:49.6,000 --> 0:01:51,000
They would be courageous, resilient,

35
0:01:51.96,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and most of all, proud of who they were.

36
0:01:54.92,000 --> 0:01:57,000
They would be the kind of person that I aspire to be.

37
0:01:58.24,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Our plan was to share their stories to the world through film.

38
0:02:02.8,000 --> 0:02:03,000
LD: There was just one problem.

39
0:02:04.4,000 --> 0:02:07,000
We had zero reporting and zero filmmaking experience.

40
0:02:07.48,000 --> 0:02:08,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:08.52,000 --> 0:02:1,000
We didn't even know where to find the Supergays,

42
0:02:10.88,000 --> 0:02:13,000
so we just had to trust that we'd figure it all out along the way.

43
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So we picked 15 countries in Asia, Africa and South America,

44
0:02:17.44,000 --> 0:02:2,000
countries outside the West that varied in terms of LGBT rights.

45
0:02:21.12,000 --> 0:02:22,000
We bought a camcorder,

46
0:02:22.4,000 --> 0:02:24,000
ordered a book on how to make a documentary --

47
0:02:24.567,000 --> 0:02:25,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:26.24,000 --> 0:02:28,000
you can learn a lot these days --

49
0:02:28.8,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and set off on an around-the-world trip.

50
0:02:32.52,000 --> 0:02:35,000
JC: One of the first countries that we traveled to was Nepal.

51
0:02:36.28,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Despite widespread poverty, a decade-long civil war,

52
0:02:39.8,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and now recently, a devastating earthquake,

53
0:02:42.92,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Nepal has made significant strides in the fight for equality.

54
0:02:46.96,000 --> 0:02:51,000
One of the key figures in the movement is Bhumika Shrestha.

55
0:02:52.04,000 --> 0:02:55,000
A beautiful, vibrant transgendered woman,

56
0:02:55.36,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Bhumika has had to overcome being expelled from school

57
0:02:58.56,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and getting incarcerated because of her gender presentation.

58
0:03:02.88,000 --> 0:03:07,000
But, in 2007, Bhumika and Nepal's LGBT rights organization

59
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:11,000
successfully petitioned the Nepali Supreme Court

60
0:03:11.08,000 --> 0:03:13,000
to protect against LGBT discrimination.

61
0:03:13.8,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Here's Bhumika:

62
0:03:15.04,000 --> 0:03:16,000
(Video) BS: What I'm most proud of?

63
0:03:16.8,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I'm a transgendered person.

64
0:03:18.32,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I'm so proud of my life.

65
0:03:20.12,000 --> 0:03:23,000
On December 21, 2007,

66
0:03:23.88,000 --> 0:03:26,000
the supreme court gave the decision for the Nepal government

67
0:03:27.56,000 --> 0:03:29,000
to give transgender identity cards

68
0:03:30.32,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and same-sex marriage.

69
0:03:32.28,000 --> 0:03:35,000
LD: I can appreciate Bhumika's confidence on a daily basis.

70
0:03:35.6,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Something as simple as using a public restroom

71
0:03:38.52,000 --> 0:03:4,000
can be a huge challenge when you don't fit in

72
0:03:41.08,000 --> 0:03:44,000
to people's strict gender expectations.

73
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Traveling throughout Asia,

74
0:03:45.88,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I tended to freak out women in public restrooms.

75
0:03:48.44,000 --> 0:03:5,000
They weren't used to seeing someone like me.

76
0:03:50.88,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I had to come up with a strategy, so that I could just pee in peace.

77
0:03:54.095,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Laughter)

78
0:03:55.4,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So anytime I would enter a restroom,

79
0:03:57.139,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I would thrust out my chest to show my womanly parts,

80
0:04:00.12,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and try to be as non-threatening as possible.

81
0:04:02.28,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Putting out my hands and saying, "Hello",

82
0:04:04.28,000 --> 0:04:06,000
just so that people could hear my feminine voice.

83
0:04:07.68,000 --> 0:04:09,000
This all gets pretty exhausting, but it's just who I am.

84
0:04:10.56,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I can't be anything else.

85
0:04:13.48,000 --> 0:04:16,000
JC: After Nepal, we traveled to India.

86
0:04:16.56,000 --> 0:04:19,000
On one hand, India is a Hindu society,

87
0:04:20.12,000 --> 0:04:22,000
without a tradition of homophobia.

88
0:04:23.04,000 --> 0:04:27,000
On the other hand, it is also a society with a deeply patriarchal system,

89
0:04:27.32,000 --> 0:04:31,000
which rejects anything that threatens the male-female order.

90
0:04:31.48,000 --> 0:04:32,000
When we spoke to activists,

91
0:04:33.12,000 --> 0:04:38,000
they told us that empowerment begins with ensuring proper gender equality,

92
0:04:38.28,000 --> 0:04:41,000
where the women's status is established in society.

93
0:04:41.36,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And in that way, the status of LGBT people can be affirmed as well.

94
0:04:46.44,000 --> 0:04:48,000
LD: There we met Prince Manvendra.

95
0:04:48.92,000 --> 0:04:51,000
He's the world's first openly gay prince.

96
0:04:52.64,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Prince Manvendra came out on the "Oprah Winfrey Show,"

97
0:04:55.2,000 --> 0:04:56,000
very internationally.

98
0:04:56.48,000 --> 0:04:57,000
His parents disowned him

99
0:04:57.76,000 --> 0:05:,000
and accused him of bringing great shame to the royal family.

100
0:05:01.04,000 --> 0:05:02,000
We sat down with Prince Manvendra

101
0:05:02.68,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and talked to him about why he decided to come out so very publicly.

102
0:05:06.56,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Here he is:

103
0:05:07.8,000 --> 0:05:09,000
(Video) Prince Manvendra: I felt there was a lot of need

104
0:05:10.36,000 --> 0:05:14,000
to break this stigma and discrimination which is existing in our society.

105
0:05:14.56,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And that instigated me to come out openly and talk about myself.

106
0:05:19.72,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Whether we are gay, we are lesbian, we are transgender, bisexual

107
0:05:23.2,000 --> 0:05:25,000
or whatever sexual minority we come from,

108
0:05:25.56,000 --> 0:05:29,000
we have to all unite and fight for our rights.

109
0:05:29.64,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Gay rights cannot be won in the court rooms,

110
0:05:32.6,000 --> 0:05:34,000
but in the hearts and the minds of the people.

111
0:05:35.92,000 --> 0:05:36,000
JC: While getting my hair cut,

112
0:05:37.68,000 --> 0:05:39,000
the woman cutting my hair asked me,

113
0:05:39.96,000 --> 0:05:4,000
"Do you have a husband?"

114
0:05:41.8,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Now, this was a dreaded question

115
0:05:43.6,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that I got asked a lot by locals while traveling.

116
0:05:47.2,000 --> 0:05:5,000
When I explained to her that I was with a woman instead of a man,

117
0:05:50.92,000 --> 0:05:51,000
she was incredulous,

118
0:05:52.28,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and she asked me a lot of questions about my parents' reactions

119
0:05:55.68,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and whether I was sad that I'd never be able to have children.

120
0:06:00.04,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I told her that there are no limitations to my life

121
0:06:03.08,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and that Lisa and I do plan to have a family some day.

122
0:06:07.04,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Now, this woman was ready to write me off

123
0:06:09.44,000 --> 0:06:11,000
as yet another crazy Westerner.

124
0:06:12.28,000 --> 0:06:14,000
She couldn't imagine that such a phenomenon

125
0:06:14.32,000 --> 0:06:16,000
could happen in her own country.

126
0:06:16.36,000 --> 0:06:18,000
That is, until I showed her the photos of the Supergays

127
0:06:19.004,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that we interviewed in India.

128
0:06:21.6,000 --> 0:06:23,000
She recognized Prince Manvendra from television

129
0:06:24.04,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and soon I had an audience of other hairdressers

130
0:06:26.303,000 --> 0:06:27,000
interested in meeting me.

131
0:06:27.518,000 --> 0:06:28,000
(Laughter)

132
0:06:29.4,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And in that ordinary afternoon,

133
0:06:31.72,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I had the chance to introduce an entire beauty salon

134
0:06:34.68,000 --> 0:06:37,000
to the social changes that were happening in their own country.

135
0:06:39.52,000 --> 0:06:41,000
LD: From India, we traveled to East Africa,

136
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
a region known for intolerance towards LGBT people.

137
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
In Kenya, 89 percent of people who come out to their families

138
0:06:49.68,000 --> 0:06:5,000
are disowned.

139
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Homosexual acts are a crime and can lead to incarceration.

140
0:06:54.72,000 --> 0:06:57,000
In Kenya, we met the soft-spoken David Kuria.

141
0:06:58.4,000 --> 0:07:,000
David had a huge mission of wanting to work for the poor

142
0:07:01.36,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and improve his own government.

143
0:07:03.12,000 --> 0:07:05,000
So he decided to run for senate.

144
0:07:05.28,000 --> 0:07:09,000
He became Kenya's first openly gay political candidate.

145
0:07:09.96,000 --> 0:07:13,000
David wanted to run his campaign without denying the reality of who he was.

146
0:07:14.64,000 --> 0:07:15,000
But we were worried for his safety

147
0:07:16.32,000 --> 0:07:18,000
because he started to receive death threats.

148
0:07:18.6,000 --> 0:07:2,000
(Video) David Kuria: At that point, I was really scared

149
0:07:21.24,000 --> 0:07:24,000
because they were actually asking for me to be killed.

150
0:07:25.04,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And, yeah,

151
0:07:27.88,000 --> 0:07:29,000
there are some people out there who do it

152
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and they feel that they are doing a religious obligation.

153
0:07:33.8,000 --> 0:07:35,000
JC: David wasn't ashamed of who he was.

154
0:07:36.4,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Even in the face of threats,

155
0:07:38.28,000 --> 0:07:39,000
he stayed authentic.

156
0:07:40.88,000 --> 0:07:43,000
LD: At the opposite end of the spectrum is Argentina.

157
0:07:44.12,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Argentina's a country where 92 percent of the population identifies as Catholic.

158
0:07:48.44,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Yet, Argentina has LGBT laws that are even more progressive

159
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
than here in the US.

160
0:07:54.52,000 --> 0:07:58,000
In 2010, Argentina became the first country in Latin America

161
0:07:58.96,000 --> 0:08:,000
and the 10th in the world to adopt marriage equality.

162
0:08:02.44,000 --> 0:08:04,000
There, we met María Rachid.

163
0:08:04.68,000 --> 0:08:06,000
María was a driving force behind that movement.

164
0:08:07.32,000 --> 0:08:09,000
María Rachid (Spanish): I always say that, in reality,

165
0:08:09.88,000 --> 0:08:1,000
the effects of marriage equality

166
0:08:11.48,000 --> 0:08:13,000
are not only for those couples that get married.

167
0:08:13.76,000 --> 0:08:16,000
They are for a lot of people that, even though they may never get married,

168
0:08:17.28,000 --> 0:08:19,000
will be perceived differently by their coworkers,

169
0:08:19.64,000 --> 0:08:22,000
their families and neighbors,

170
0:08:22.72,000 --> 0:08:26,000
from the national state's message of equality.

171
0:08:27.2,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I feel very proud of Argentina

172
0:08:29.08,000 --> 0:08:33,000
because Argentina today is a model of equality.

173
0:08:33.12,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And hopefully soon,

174
0:08:34.72,000 --> 0:08:38,000
the whole world will have the same rights.

175
0:08:39.68,000 --> 0:08:41,000
JC: When we made the visit to my ancestral lands,

176
0:08:42.44,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I wish I could have shown my parents what we found there.

177
0:08:45.52,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Because here is who we met:

178
0:08:47.48,000 --> 0:08:52,000
(Video) One, two, three. Welcome gays to Shanghai!

179
0:08:52.64,000 --> 0:08:54,000
(Laughter)

180
0:08:58.44,000 --> 0:09:03,000
A whole community of young, beautiful Chinese LGBT people.

181
0:09:04.04,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Sure, they had their struggles.

182
0:09:05.56,000 --> 0:09:07,000
But they were fighting it out.

183
0:09:07.84,000 --> 0:09:11,000
In Shanghai, I had the chance to speak to a local lesbian group

184
0:09:11.92,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and tell them our story in my broken Mandarin Chinese.

185
0:09:15.6,000 --> 0:09:17,000
In Taipei, each time we got onto the metro,

186
0:09:18.28,000 --> 0:09:21,000
we saw yet another lesbian couple holding hands.

187
0:09:21.48,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And we learned that Asia's largest LGBT pride event

188
0:09:25.64,000 --> 0:09:29,000
happens just blocks away from where my grandparents live.

189
0:09:30.04,000 --> 0:09:31,000
If only my parents knew.

190
0:09:33.387,000 --> 0:09:36,000
LD: By the time we finished our not-so-straight journey around the world,

191
0:09:36.84,000 --> 0:09:37,000
(Laughter)

192
0:09:38.08,000 --> 0:09:39,000
we had traveled 50,000 miles

193
0:09:39.8,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and logged 120 hours of video footage.

194
0:09:42.48,000 --> 0:09:43,000
We traveled to 15 countries

195
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and interviewed 50 Supergays.

196
0:09:46.08,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Turns out, it wasn't hard to find them at all.

197
0:09:49.48,000 --> 0:09:51,000
JC: Yes, there are still tragedies that happen

198
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:54,000
on the bumpy road to equality.

199
0:09:54.28,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And let's not forget that 75 countries still criminalize homosexuality today.

200
0:09:59.88,000 --> 0:10:02,000
But there are also stories of hope and courage

201
0:10:03.36,000 --> 0:10:05,000
in every corner of the world.

202
0:10:06.6,000 --> 0:10:09,000
What we ultimately took away from our journey is,

203
0:10:09.72,000 --> 0:10:12,000
equality is not a Western invention.

204
0:10:14.84,000 --> 0:10:18,000
LD: One of the key factors in this equality movement is momentum,

205
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
momentum as more and more people embrace their full selves

206
0:10:22.56,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and use whatever opportunities they have

207
0:10:24.72,000 --> 0:10:26,000
to change their part of the world,

208
0:10:26.96,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and momentum as more and more countries

209
0:10:29.2,000 --> 0:10:31,000
find models of equality in one another.

210
0:10:32.2,000 --> 0:10:35,000
When Nepal protected against LGBT discrimination,

211
0:10:35.76,000 --> 0:10:36,000
India pushed harder.

212
0:10:37.56,000 --> 0:10:39,000
When Argentina embraced marriage equality,

213
0:10:40.48,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Uruguay and Brazil followed.

214
0:10:42.72,000 --> 0:10:44,000
When Ireland said yes to equality,

215
0:10:45.68,000 --> 0:10:49,000
(Applause)

216
0:10:49.76,000 --> 0:10:5,000
the world stopped to notice.

217
0:10:51.72,000 --> 0:10:53,000
When the US Supreme Court makes a statement to the world

218
0:10:54.4,000 --> 0:10:55,000
that we can all be proud of.

219
0:10:55.76,000 --> 0:10:57,000
(Applause)

220
0:11:02.56,000 --> 0:11:03,000
JC: As we reviewed our footage,

221
0:11:04.12,000 --> 0:11:07,000
what we realized is that we were watching a love story.

222
0:11:08.08,000 --> 0:11:1,000
It wasn't a love story that was expected of me,

223
0:11:10.88,000 --> 0:11:14,000
but it is one filled with more freedom, adventure and love

224
0:11:15.24,000 --> 0:11:17,000
than I could have ever possibly imagined.

225
0:11:18.2,000 --> 0:11:2,000
One year after returning home from our trip,

226
0:11:20.76,000 --> 0:11:22,000
marriage equality came to California.

227
0:11:23.76,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And in the end, we believe, love will win out.

228
0:11:30.56,000 --> 0:11:32,000
(Video) By the power vested in me,

229
0:11:33.44,000 --> 0:11:35,000
by the state of California

230
0:11:36.04,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and by God Almighty,

231
0:11:38.32,000 --> 0:11:41,000
I now pronounce you spouses for life.

232
0:11:41.68,000 --> 0:11:42,000
You may kiss.

233
0:11:42.92,000 --> 0:11:43,000
(Applause)

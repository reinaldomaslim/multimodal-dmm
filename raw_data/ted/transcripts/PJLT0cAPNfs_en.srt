1
0:00:12.982,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I'm going to tell you about the most amazing machines in the world

2
0:00:17.065,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and what we can now do with them.

3
0:00:19.396,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Proteins,

4
0:00:20.583,000 --> 0:00:22,000
some of which you see inside a cell here,

5
0:00:22.857,000 --> 0:00:25,000
carry out essentially all the important functions in our bodies.

6
0:00:26.972,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Proteins digest your food,

7
0:00:28.875,000 --> 0:00:29,000
contract your muscles,

8
0:00:30.605,000 --> 0:00:31,000
fire your neurons

9
0:00:32.206,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and power your immune system.

10
0:00:34.4,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Everything that happens in biology --

11
0:00:36.4,000 --> 0:00:37,000
almost --

12
0:00:37.575,000 --> 0:00:38,000
happens because of proteins.

13
0:00:39.698,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Proteins are linear chains of building blocks called amino acids.

14
0:00:44.366,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Nature uses an alphabet of 20 amino acids,

15
0:00:47.623,000 --> 0:00:49,000
some of which have names you may have heard of.

16
0:00:50.921,000 --> 0:00:53,000
In this picture, for scale, each bump is an atom.

17
0:00:55.351,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Chemical forces between the amino acids cause these long stringy molecules

18
0:01:00.019,000 --> 0:01:03,000
to fold up into unique, three-dimensional structures.

19
0:01:03.937,000 --> 0:01:04,000
The folding process,

20
0:01:05.301,000 --> 0:01:06,000
while it looks random,

21
0:01:06.759,000 --> 0:01:07,000
is in fact very precise.

22
0:01:08.746,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Each protein folds to its characteristic shape each time,

23
0:01:13.167,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and the folding process takes just a fraction of a second.

24
0:01:18.029,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And it's the shapes of proteins

25
0:01:19.897,000 --> 0:01:22,000
which enable them to carry out their remarkable biological functions.

26
0:01:24.52,000 --> 0:01:25,000
For example,

27
0:01:25.695,000 --> 0:01:28,000
hemoglobin has a shape in the lungs perfectly suited

28
0:01:29.227,000 --> 0:01:3,000
for binding a molecule of oxygen.

29
0:01:31.759,000 --> 0:01:32,000
When hemoglobin moves to your muscle,

30
0:01:33.675,000 --> 0:01:34,000
the shape changes slightly

31
0:01:35.631,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and the oxygen comes out.

32
0:01:39.494,000 --> 0:01:4,000
The shapes of proteins,

33
0:01:40.884,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and hence their remarkable functions,

34
0:01:43.121,000 --> 0:01:48,000
are completely specified by the sequence of amino acids in the protein chain.

35
0:01:49.331,000 --> 0:01:52,000
In this picture, each letter on top is an amino acid.

36
0:01:54.86,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Where do these sequences come from?

37
0:01:57.586,000 --> 0:02:01,000
The genes in your genome specify the amino acid sequences

38
0:02:02.434,000 --> 0:02:03,000
of your proteins.

39
0:02:03.856,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Each gene encodes the amino acid sequence of a single protein.

40
0:02:09.515,000 --> 0:02:12,000
The translation between these amino acid sequences

41
0:02:13.341,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and the structures and functions of proteins

42
0:02:15.823,000 --> 0:02:17,000
is known as the protein folding problem.

43
0:02:18.439,000 --> 0:02:19,000
It's a very hard problem

44
0:02:20.008,000 --> 0:02:23,000
because there's so many different shapes a protein can adopt.

45
0:02:24.073,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Because of this complexity,

46
0:02:25.742,000 --> 0:02:27,000
humans have only been able to harness the power of proteins

47
0:02:28.703,000 --> 0:02:31,000
by making very small changes to the amino acid sequences

48
0:02:32.195,000 --> 0:02:34,000
of the proteins we've found in nature.

49
0:02:34.835,000 --> 0:02:37,000
This is similar to the process that our Stone Age ancestors used

50
0:02:38.717,000 --> 0:02:41,000
to make tools and other implements from the sticks and stones

51
0:02:42.1,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that we found in the world around us.

52
0:02:45.226,000 --> 0:02:5,000
But humans did not learn to fly by modifying birds.

53
0:02:50.79,000 --> 0:02:52,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:52.831,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Instead, scientists, inspired by birds, uncovered the principles of aerodynamics.

55
0:02:59.165,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Engineers then used those principles to design custom flying machines.

56
0:03:04.195,000 --> 0:03:05,000
In a similar way,

57
0:03:05.464,000 --> 0:03:06,000
we've been working for a number of years

58
0:03:07.43,000 --> 0:03:1,000
to uncover the fundamental principles of protein folding

59
0:03:10.723,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and encoding those principles in the computer program called Rosetta.

60
0:03:15.742,000 --> 0:03:17,000
We made a breakthrough in recent years.

61
0:03:19.029,000 --> 0:03:23,000
We can now design completely new proteins from scratch on the computer.

62
0:03:24.396,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Once we've designed the new protein,

63
0:03:27.242,000 --> 0:03:3,000
we encode its amino acid sequence in a synthetic gene.

64
0:03:31.656,000 --> 0:03:32,000
We have to make a synthetic gene

65
0:03:33.568,000 --> 0:03:35,000
because since the protein is completely new,

66
0:03:35.843,000 --> 0:03:39,000
there's no gene in any organism on earth which currently exists that encodes it.

67
0:03:41.697,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Our advances in understanding protein folding

68
0:03:45.908,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and how to design proteins,

69
0:03:47.654,000 --> 0:03:5,000
coupled with the decreasing cost of gene synthesis

70
0:03:51.306,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and the Moore's law increase in computing power,

71
0:03:54.829,000 --> 0:03:58,000
now enable us to design tens of thousands of new proteins,

72
0:03:59.589,000 --> 0:04:01,000
with new shapes and new functions,

73
0:04:01.952,000 --> 0:04:02,000
on the computer,

74
0:04:03.489,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and encode each one of those in a synthetic gene.

75
0:04:08.248,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Once we have those synthetic genes,

76
0:04:09.94,000 --> 0:04:1,000
we put them into bacteria

77
0:04:11.509,000 --> 0:04:14,000
to program them to make these brand-new proteins.

78
0:04:15.197,000 --> 0:04:17,000
We then extract the proteins

79
0:04:17.294,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and determine whether they function as we designed them to

80
0:04:20.754,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and whether they're safe.

81
0:04:23.867,000 --> 0:04:25,000
It's exciting to be able to make new proteins,

82
0:04:26.356,000 --> 0:04:28,000
because despite the diversity in nature,

83
0:04:28.876,000 --> 0:04:34,000
evolution has only sampled a tiny fraction of the total number of proteins possible.

84
0:04:35.572,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I told you that nature uses an alphabet of 20 amino acids,

85
0:04:39.091,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and a typical protein is a chain of about 100 amino acids,

86
0:04:43.564,000 --> 0:04:48,000
so the total number of possibilities is 20 times 20 times 20, 100 times,

87
0:04:49.14,000 --> 0:04:52,000
which is a number on the order of 10 to the 130th power,

88
0:04:52.981,000 --> 0:04:55,000
which is enormously more than the total number of proteins

89
0:04:56.817,000 --> 0:04:58,000
which have existed since life on earth began.

90
0:04:59.99,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And it's this unimaginably large space

91
0:05:02.705,000 --> 0:05:05,000
we can now explore using computational protein design.

92
0:05:07.747,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Now the proteins that exist on earth

93
0:05:10.14,000 --> 0:05:13,000
evolved to solve the problems faced by natural evolution.

94
0:05:14.705,000 --> 0:05:16,000
For example, replicating the genome.

95
0:05:18.128,000 --> 0:05:2,000
But we face new challenges today.

96
0:05:20.436,000 --> 0:05:22,000
We live longer, so new diseases are important.

97
0:05:23.197,000 --> 0:05:25,000
We're heating up and polluting the planet,

98
0:05:25.436,000 --> 0:05:28,000
so we face a whole host of ecological challenges.

99
0:05:29.977,000 --> 0:05:3,000
If we had a million years to wait,

100
0:05:31.809,000 --> 0:05:34,000
new proteins might evolve to solve those challenges.

101
0:05:35.787,000 --> 0:05:37,000
But we don't have millions of years to wait.

102
0:05:38.488,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Instead, with computational protein design,

103
0:05:41.383,000 --> 0:05:45,000
we can design new proteins to address these challenges today.

104
0:05:47.693,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Our audacious idea is to bring biology out of the Stone Age

105
0:05:52.167,000 --> 0:05:54,000
through technological revolution in protein design.

106
0:05:56.113,000 --> 0:05:58,000
We've already shown that we can design new proteins

107
0:05:59.001,000 --> 0:06:,000
with new shapes and functions.

108
0:06:01.174,000 --> 0:06:05,000
For example, vaccines work by stimulating your immune system

109
0:06:05.506,000 --> 0:06:08,000
to make a strong response against a pathogen.

110
0:06:09.698,000 --> 0:06:1,000
To make better vaccines,

111
0:06:11.273,000 --> 0:06:13,000
we've designed protein particles

112
0:06:13.599,000 --> 0:06:16,000
to which we can fuse proteins from pathogens,

113
0:06:17.21,000 --> 0:06:21,000
like this blue protein here, from the respiratory virus RSV.

114
0:06:22.131,000 --> 0:06:23,000
To make vaccine candidates

115
0:06:23.885,000 --> 0:06:26,000
that are literally bristling with the viral protein,

116
0:06:27.572,000 --> 0:06:29,000
we find that such vaccine candidates

117
0:06:30.166,000 --> 0:06:33,000
produce a much stronger immune response to the virus

118
0:06:33.492,000 --> 0:06:35,000
than any previous vaccines that have been tested.

119
0:06:36.648,000 --> 0:06:39,000
This is important because RSV is currently one of the leading causes

120
0:06:40.522,000 --> 0:06:42,000
of infant mortality worldwide.

121
0:06:44.414,000 --> 0:06:47,000
We've also designed new proteins to break down gluten in your stomach

122
0:06:48.401,000 --> 0:06:49,000
for celiac disease

123
0:06:50.022,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and other proteins to stimulate your immune system to fight cancer.

124
0:06:55.338,000 --> 0:06:58,000
These advances are the beginning of the protein design revolution.

125
0:07:00.85,000 --> 0:07:03,000
We've been inspired by a previous technological revolution:

126
0:07:04.064,000 --> 0:07:05,000
the digital revolution,

127
0:07:05.433,000 --> 0:07:1,000
which took place in large part due to advances in one place,

128
0:07:10.582,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Bell Laboratories.

129
0:07:12.337,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Bell Labs was a place with an open, collaborative environment,

130
0:07:15.655,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and was able to attract top talent from around the world.

131
0:07:19.418,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And this led to a remarkable string of innovations --

132
0:07:22.884,000 --> 0:07:26,000
the transistor, the laser, satellite communication

133
0:07:27.099,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and the foundations of the internet.

134
0:07:29.761,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Our goal is to build the Bell Laboratories of protein design.

135
0:07:34.076,000 --> 0:07:37,000
We are seeking to attract talented scientists from around the world

136
0:07:37.615,000 --> 0:07:39,000
to accelerate the protein design revolution,

137
0:07:40.574,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and we'll be focusing on five grand challenges.

138
0:07:46.136,000 --> 0:07:51,000
First, by taking proteins from flu strains from around the world

139
0:07:51.757,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and putting them on top of the designed protein particles

140
0:07:55.335,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I showed you earlier,

141
0:07:57.026,000 --> 0:08:,000
we aim to make a universal flu vaccine,

142
0:08:00.44,000 --> 0:08:03,000
one shot of which gives a lifetime of protection against the flu.

143
0:08:05.356,000 --> 0:08:06,000
The ability to design --

144
0:08:06.992,000 --> 0:08:11,000
(Applause)

145
0:08:12.24,000 --> 0:08:15,000
The ability to design new vaccines on the computer

146
0:08:15.332,000 --> 0:08:2,000
is important both to protect against natural flu epidemics

147
0:08:20.664,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and, in addition, intentional acts of bioterrorism.

148
0:08:25.272,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Second, we're going far beyond nature's limited alphabet

149
0:08:28.586,000 --> 0:08:29,000
of just 20 amino acids

150
0:08:30.321,000 --> 0:08:34,000
to design new therapeutic candidates for conditions such as chronic pain,

151
0:08:35.08,000 --> 0:08:37,000
using an alphabet of thousands of amino acids.

152
0:08:38.602,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Third, we're building advanced delivery vehicles

153
0:08:42.439,000 --> 0:08:46,000
to target existing medications exactly where they need to go in the body.

154
0:08:47.226,000 --> 0:08:49,000
For example, chemotherapy to a tumor

155
0:08:49.899,000 --> 0:08:53,000
or gene therapies to the tissue where gene repair needs to take place.

156
0:08:55,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Fourth, we're designing smart therapeutics that can do calculations within the body

157
0:09:01.556,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and go far beyond current medicines,

158
0:09:03.794,000 --> 0:09:05,000
which are really blunt instruments.

159
0:09:06.082,000 --> 0:09:1,000
For example, to target a small subset of immune cells

160
0:09:10.455,000 --> 0:09:12,000
responsible for an autoimmune disorder,

161
0:09:12.56,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and distinguish them from the vast majority of healthy immune cells.

162
0:09:16.899,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Finally, inspired by remarkable biological materials

163
0:09:20.335,000 --> 0:09:25,000
such as silk, abalone shell, tooth and others,

164
0:09:25.467,000 --> 0:09:27,000
we're designing new protein-based materials

165
0:09:28.375,000 --> 0:09:32,000
to address challenges in energy and ecological issues.

166
0:09:33.558,000 --> 0:09:35,000
To do all this, we're growing our institute.

167
0:09:36.768,000 --> 0:09:41,000
We seek to attract energetic, talented and diverse scientists

168
0:09:42.391,000 --> 0:09:45,000
from around the world, at all career stages,

169
0:09:45.495,000 --> 0:09:46,000
to join us.

170
0:09:47.304,000 --> 0:09:5,000
You can also participate in the protein design revolution

171
0:09:50.631,000 --> 0:09:53,000
through our online folding and design game, "Foldit."

172
0:09:55.214,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And through our distributed computing project, Rosetta@home,

173
0:09:59.089,000 --> 0:10:02,000
which you can join from your laptop or your Android smartphone.

174
0:10:04.547,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Making the world a better place through protein design is my life's work.

175
0:10:08.996,000 --> 0:10:1,000
I'm so excited about what we can do together.

176
0:10:11.583,000 --> 0:10:12,000
I hope you'll join us,

177
0:10:13.077,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and thank you.

178
0:10:14.259,000 --> 0:10:18,000
(Applause and cheers)

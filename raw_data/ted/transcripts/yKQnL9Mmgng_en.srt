1
0:00:15.4,000 --> 0:00:21,000
few years ago exactly I was in

2
0:00:18.44,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Afghanistan I was covering the war in

3
0:00:21.83,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Afghanistan and I witnessed as a

4
0:00:24.86,000 --> 0:00:28,000
reporter for al-jazeera the amount of

5
0:00:27.77,000 --> 0:00:32,000
suffering and destruction that emerged

6
0:00:29.84,000 --> 0:00:35,000
out of a war like that then two years

7
0:00:33.739,000 --> 0:00:38,000
later I covered another war the war in

8
0:00:36.23,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Iraq I was placed at the center of that

9
0:00:39.65,000 --> 0:00:45,000
world because I was covering the war

10
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:48,000
from the northern part of Iraq and the

11
0:00:45.949,000 --> 0:00:52,000
war ended with a regime change like the

12
0:00:48.979,000 --> 0:00:56,000
one in Afghanistan and that regime that

13
0:00:53.12,000 --> 0:01:,000
we got rid of what actually dictatorship

14
0:00:57.339,000 --> 0:01:05,000
authoritarian regime that for decades

15
0:01:00.489,000 --> 0:01:07,000
you know created great sense of

16
0:01:05.84,000 --> 0:01:09,000
paralysis within the nation within the

17
0:01:08.12,000 --> 0:01:13,000
people themselves however the change

18
0:01:10.64,000 --> 0:01:15,000
that came through foreign intervention

19
0:01:13.13,000 --> 0:01:18,000
created even worse circumstances for the

20
0:01:16.19,000 --> 0:01:21,000
people and even the sense of paralysis

21
0:01:18.68,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and inferiority in that part of the

22
0:01:21.74,000 --> 0:01:25,000
world for decades

23
0:01:23.6,000 --> 0:01:27,000
we have lived under authoritarian

24
0:01:26.15,000 --> 0:01:32,000
regimes in the Arab world in the Middle

25
0:01:28.46,000 --> 0:01:35,000
East these regimes created something

26
0:01:32.75,000 --> 0:01:37,000
within us during this period I'm 43

27
0:01:35.99,000 --> 0:01:4,000
years old right now for the last 40

28
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
years I have seen almost the same faces

29
0:01:41.06,000 --> 0:01:46,000
for kings and presidents ruling us

30
0:01:46.6,000 --> 0:01:53,000
old-aged authoritarian corrupt situation

31
0:01:51.35,000 --> 0:01:57,000
regimes that we have seen around us and

32
0:01:54.47,000 --> 0:01:59,000
for a moment I was wondering are we

33
0:01:57.8,000 --> 0:02:02,000
going to live in order to see real

34
0:01:59.81,000 --> 0:02:03,000
change happening on the ground a change

35
0:02:02.87,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that does not come true for an

36
0:02:04.79,000 --> 0:02:09,000
intervention through misery of

37
0:02:07.01,000 --> 0:02:13,000
occupation through you know nations

38
0:02:10.399,000 --> 0:02:15,000
invading our land and and deepening the

39
0:02:13.099,000 --> 0:02:18,000
sense of inferiority sometimes the

40
0:02:15.89,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Iraqis yes they got rid of Saddam

41
0:02:18.349,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Hussein but when they saw their land

42
0:02:21.219,000 --> 0:02:25,000
occupied by foreign force

43
0:02:23.86,000 --> 0:02:29,000
they felt very sad they figured that

44
0:02:26.2,000 --> 0:02:32,000
dignity has suffered and this is why

45
0:02:30.099,000 --> 0:02:35,000
they revolted this is why they did not

46
0:02:32.44,000 --> 0:02:37,000
accept and actually other regimes they

47
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
told their citizens would you like to

48
0:02:37.72,000 --> 0:02:42,000
see the situation of Iraq would you like

49
0:02:40.239,000 --> 0:02:45,000
to see civil war sectarian killing would

50
0:02:43.39,000 --> 0:02:46,000
you like to see destruction would you

51
0:02:45.28,000 --> 0:02:49,000
like to see foreign troops in your land

52
0:02:47.11,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and the people thought for themselves

53
0:02:49.42,000 --> 0:02:53,000
maybe we should live with this kind of

54
0:02:51.73,000 --> 0:02:55,000
authoritarian situation that we found

55
0:02:53.89,000 --> 0:02:59,000
ourselves and instead of having the

56
0:02:56.47,000 --> 0:03:01,000
second scenario that was the one of the

57
0:02:59.95,000 --> 0:03:04,000
worst nightmares that we have seen for

58
0:03:02.11,000 --> 0:03:07,000
10 years unfortunately we have found

59
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
ourselves reporting images of

60
0:03:08.019,000 --> 0:03:13,000
destruction images of killing of

61
0:03:10.569,000 --> 0:03:16,000
sectarian conflicts images of violence

62
0:03:13.959,000 --> 0:03:18,000
emerging from a magnificent piece of

63
0:03:17.14,000 --> 0:03:21,000
land a region that one day was the

64
0:03:19.51,000 --> 0:03:25,000
source of civilizations and art and

65
0:03:21.76,000 --> 0:03:3,000
culture for thousands of years now I am

66
0:03:26.47,000 --> 0:03:33,000
here to tell you that the future that we

67
0:03:31.51,000 --> 0:03:4,000
were dreaming for has eventually arrived

68
0:03:34.389,000 --> 0:03:44,000
a new generation will educate it

69
0:03:40.799,000 --> 0:03:5,000
connected inspired by universal values

70
0:03:45.34,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and the global understanding has created

71
0:03:51.28,000 --> 0:04:,000
a new reality for us we found new way to

72
0:03:56.739,000 --> 0:04:04,000
express our feelings and to express our

73
0:04:00.7,000 --> 0:04:07,000
dreams these young people who have

74
0:04:05.109,000 --> 0:04:1,000
restored self confidence in our nation's

75
0:04:08.2,000 --> 0:04:15,000
in that part of the world who have given

76
0:04:10.359,000 --> 0:04:17,000
us new meaning for freedom and empowered

77
0:04:15.34,000 --> 0:04:18,000
us to go down to the streets nothing

78
0:04:17.829,000 --> 0:04:2,000
happened no violence

79
0:04:18.959,000 --> 0:04:24,000
nothing just step out of your house

80
0:04:21.539,000 --> 0:04:27,000
raise your voice and say we would like

81
0:04:25.15,000 --> 0:04:3,000
to see that in the very dream this is

82
0:04:27.61,000 --> 0:04:33,000
what happened in Tunisia over a few days

83
0:04:30.46,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that there is a regime that invested

84
0:04:33.68,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Lien's of dollars and the security

85
0:04:35.81,000 --> 0:04:4,000
agencies billions of dollars and

86
0:04:38.99,000 --> 0:04:43,000
maintaining trying to maintain you know

87
0:04:41.6,000 --> 0:04:46,000
its presence collapsed disappeared

88
0:04:44.87,000 --> 0:04:48,000
because of the voices of the public

89
0:04:46.88,000 --> 0:04:5,000
people who were inspired to go down to

90
0:04:49.789,000 --> 0:04:53,000
the streets and to raise their voices

91
0:04:51.259,000 --> 0:04:56,000
they tried to kill the intelligence

92
0:04:54.139,000 --> 0:04:58,000
agencies wanted to arrest people they

93
0:04:56.539,000 --> 0:05:,000
you know found something called

94
0:04:58.97,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Facebook's they found something called

95
0:05:00.71,000 --> 0:05:03,000
you know Twitter they were surprised

96
0:05:02.87,000 --> 0:05:07,000
what all these kind of issues and they

97
0:05:04.61,000 --> 0:05:1,000
said you know these kids are mislead

98
0:05:08.169,000 --> 0:05:13,000
therefore they are their parents to go

99
0:05:11.15,000 --> 0:05:14,000
down to the streets to collect them

100
0:05:13.37,000 --> 0:05:16,000
bring them back home this is what they

101
0:05:15.08,000 --> 0:05:19,000
were telling this is their propaganda

102
0:05:16.699,000 --> 0:05:24,000
bring these kids home because they are

103
0:05:19.25,000 --> 0:05:28,000
mislead but yes these youth who have

104
0:05:25.13,000 --> 0:05:3,000
been inspired by universal values who

105
0:05:28.46,000 --> 0:05:33,000
are idealistic enough to imagine

106
0:05:31.09,000 --> 0:05:36,000
magnificent future and at the same time

107
0:05:33.83,000 --> 0:05:38,000
realistic enough to you know balance

108
0:05:37.009,000 --> 0:05:43,000
disc and imagination and the process

109
0:05:39.5,000 --> 0:05:45,000
leading to it not using violence not

110
0:05:43.159,000 --> 0:05:49,000
trying to create chaos these young

111
0:05:46.37,000 --> 0:05:51,000
people they did not go home parents

112
0:05:49.729,000 --> 0:05:52,000
actually went to the streets and they

113
0:05:52.19,000 --> 0:05:57,000
supported them and this is how the

114
0:05:53.659,000 --> 0:05:59,000
revolution was born in Tunisia we in Al

115
0:05:57.32,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Jazeera were banned from Tunisia for

116
0:05:59.99,000 --> 0:06:03,000
four years and the government did not

117
0:06:03.02,000 --> 0:06:08,000
allow any Al Jazeera reporter to be

118
0:06:04.849,000 --> 0:06:09,000
there but we found that these people in

119
0:06:08.06,000 --> 0:06:13,000
the street all of them are our reporters

120
0:06:10.21,000 --> 0:06:17,000
feeding our newsroom with pictures with

121
0:06:13.909,000 --> 0:06:19,000
videos and with news and suddenly that

122
0:06:17.509,000 --> 0:06:23,000
newsroom in Doha became a center that

123
0:06:20.349,000 --> 0:06:25,000
receive all this kind of input from

124
0:06:23.69,000 --> 0:06:27,000
ordinary people people who are connected

125
0:06:25.55,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and people who have ambition and who

126
0:06:28.34,000 --> 0:06:32,000
have liberated themselves from the

127
0:06:30.289,000 --> 0:06:36,000
feeling of inferiority and then we took

128
0:06:33.289,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that decision we are on rolling news we

129
0:06:36.65,000 --> 0:06:39,000
are going to build the voice for of

130
0:06:38.419,000 --> 0:06:41,000
these voiceless people we are going to

131
0:06:40.22,000 --> 0:06:43,000
spread the message yes some of these

132
0:06:42.38,000 --> 0:06:46,000
young people are

133
0:06:43.86,000 --> 0:06:47,000
to the internet but the connectivity in

134
0:06:46.62,000 --> 0:06:5,000
the Arab world is very little it's very

135
0:06:48.78,000 --> 0:06:52,000
small you know because of many problems

136
0:06:51.09,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that we are suffering from but

137
0:06:52.919,000 --> 0:06:57,000
al-jazeera took the voice from these

138
0:06:55.319,000 --> 0:07:,000
people and we amplified we put it in

139
0:06:58.83,000 --> 0:07:01,000
every setting room in the Arab world and

140
0:07:01.139,000 --> 0:07:06,000
internationally globally through our

141
0:07:02.789,000 --> 0:07:07,000
English English Channel and then people

142
0:07:06.419,000 --> 0:07:13,000
started to feel that there is something

143
0:07:08.61,000 --> 0:07:15,000
new happening and then they in labid in

144
0:07:13.59,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Banali decided to live and then Egypt

145
0:07:16.229,000 --> 0:07:21,000
started and Hassan Mubarak decided to

146
0:07:18.96,000 --> 0:07:22,000
leave and now Libya as you see it and

147
0:07:21.629,000 --> 0:07:25,000
then you have Yemen and you have many

148
0:07:23.729,000 --> 0:07:28,000
other countries trying to see and to

149
0:07:26.099,000 --> 0:07:3,000
rediscover that can-do feeling of how

150
0:07:28.889,000 --> 0:07:32,000
could we imagine a future which is

151
0:07:30.779,000 --> 0:07:37,000
magnificent and peaceful and tolerant I

152
0:07:33.529,000 --> 0:07:42,000
want to tell you something that internet

153
0:07:38.639,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and connectivity has created new mindset

154
0:07:43.52,000 --> 0:07:49,000
but this mindset has continued to be

155
0:07:47.069,000 --> 0:07:53,000
faithful to the soil and to the land

156
0:07:49.62,000 --> 0:07:56,000
that it emerged from and what this was

157
0:07:53.46,000 --> 0:07:59,000
the major difference between many

158
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
initiatives before to create change

159
0:07:59.479,000 --> 0:08:05,000
before we thought and governments told

160
0:08:02.669,000 --> 0:08:08,000
us and even sometimes it was a true that

161
0:08:05.639,000 --> 0:08:1,000
change was imposed on us and people

162
0:08:09.27,000 --> 0:08:15,000
rejected that because they thought that

163
0:08:11.129,000 --> 0:08:18,000
it is alien to their culture always we

164
0:08:15.839,000 --> 0:08:21,000
believed that change should spring from

165
0:08:18.36,000 --> 0:08:25,000
within that change should be you know

166
0:08:22.219,000 --> 0:08:28,000
reconciliation with culture cultural

167
0:08:25.379,000 --> 0:08:3,000
diversity with our faith in our

168
0:08:28.56,000 --> 0:08:33,000
tradition and in our history but at the

169
0:08:30.93,000 --> 0:08:36,000
same time open to universal values

170
0:08:33.81,000 --> 0:08:39,000
connected with the world tolerant to the

171
0:08:36.93,000 --> 0:08:4,000
outside and this is the moment that is

172
0:08:39.93,000 --> 0:08:42,000
happening right now in the Arab world

173
0:08:41.25,000 --> 0:08:44,000
this is the right moment and this is the

174
0:08:43.14,000 --> 0:08:46,000
actual moment that we see all of these

175
0:08:45.18,000 --> 0:08:49,000
meanings meet together and they create

176
0:08:47.13,000 --> 0:08:52,000
this magnificent at the beginning of

177
0:08:49.86,000 --> 0:08:54,000
this magnificent era that will emerge

178
0:08:52.199,000 --> 0:08:56,000
from the frontal region how did the

179
0:08:55.77,000 --> 0:08:59,000
elite deal with

180
0:08:56.64,000 --> 0:09:03,000
the circled political elite in front of

181
0:09:00.75,000 --> 0:09:05,000
the Facebook they bought the camel in a

182
0:09:03.81,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Tahrir Square in front of Al Jazeera

183
0:09:06.709,000 --> 0:09:14,000
they started you know creating tribalism

184
0:09:10.62,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and then when they failed they started

185
0:09:14.79,000 --> 0:09:2,000
speaking about conspiracies that emerge

186
0:09:17.76,000 --> 0:09:22,000
from Tel Aviv and Washington in order to

187
0:09:20.79,000 --> 0:09:25,000
divide the Arab world they started

188
0:09:22.92,000 --> 0:09:27,000
telling the West be aware of al Qaeda al

189
0:09:25.92,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Qaeda is taking over our territories

190
0:09:27.99,000 --> 0:09:32,000
these are Islamic states trying to

191
0:09:30.45,000 --> 0:09:37,000
create new Emirates you know be aware of

192
0:09:33.48,000 --> 0:09:39,000
these people who is coming to you in

193
0:09:38.01,000 --> 0:09:43,000
order to ruin your aggress civilization

194
0:09:40.19,000 --> 0:09:45,000
unfortunately you know or fortunately

195
0:09:43.019,000 --> 0:09:49,000
people right now cannot be deceived

196
0:09:45.269,000 --> 0:09:52,000
because this corrupt in need and in that

197
0:09:49.62,000 --> 0:09:55,000
region has lost even the power of

198
0:09:52.529,000 --> 0:09:57,000
deception they could not and they cannot

199
0:09:55.89,000 --> 0:10:01,000
imagine how could they really deal with

200
0:09:58.32,000 --> 0:10:04,000
this reality they are they have lost

201
0:10:02.19,000 --> 0:10:07,000
they have been detached from their

202
0:10:04.55,000 --> 0:10:09,000
people from the masses and now we are

203
0:10:07.949,000 --> 0:10:15,000
seeing them collapsing one after the

204
0:10:10.32,000 --> 0:10:18,000
other and Jazeera is not a tool of

205
0:10:16.32,000 --> 0:10:23,000
revolution we do not create revolutions

206
0:10:18.98,000 --> 0:10:25,000
however when something of that magnitude

207
0:10:23.49,000 --> 0:10:28,000
happen we are at the center of the

208
0:10:26.01,000 --> 0:10:32,000
coverage we were banned from Egypt and

209
0:10:28.98,000 --> 0:10:36,000
our correspondents some of them were

210
0:10:32.25,000 --> 0:10:4,000
arrested but most of our camera people

211
0:10:37.56,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and our journalists they went

212
0:10:40.38,000 --> 0:10:44,000
underground in Egypt voluntarily to

213
0:10:43.44,000 --> 0:10:48,000
report what happen in a Tahrir Square

214
0:10:44.99,000 --> 0:10:51,000
for 18 days our cameras were

215
0:10:49.13,000 --> 0:10:54,000
broadcasting live the voices of the

216
0:10:52.11,000 --> 0:10:56,000
people on a Tahrir Square I remember one

217
0:10:54.449,000 --> 0:10:58,000
night when someone phoned me on my cell

218
0:10:57.06,000 --> 0:11:01,000
phone ordinary person who I don't know

219
0:10:58.709,000 --> 0:11:02,000
from a Tahrir Square he told me we

220
0:11:01.079,000 --> 0:11:05,000
appeal to you not to switch off the

221
0:11:03.06,000 --> 0:11:07,000
cameras if you switch off the cameras

222
0:11:05.399,000 --> 0:11:1,000
tonight there will be a genocide

223
0:11:07.8,000 --> 0:11:11,000
you are protecting us by showing what is

224
0:11:10.8,000 --> 0:11:15,000
happening at a tener square

225
0:11:12.66,000 --> 0:11:16,000
I felt the responsibility to form our

226
0:11:15.839,000 --> 0:11:19,000
correspondence there and to fund our

227
0:11:17.49,000 --> 0:11:21,000
newsroom and to tell them make your best

228
0:11:19.89,000 --> 0:11:24,000
not to switch off the cameras at night

229
0:11:22.11,000 --> 0:11:27,000
because the guys there really feel

230
0:11:25.29,000 --> 0:11:29,000
confident when someone is reporting

231
0:11:27.36,000 --> 0:11:34,000
their story and they feel protected as

232
0:11:29.399,000 --> 0:11:36,000
well so we have a chance to create a new

233
0:11:34.98,000 --> 0:11:42,000
future in the in that part of the world

234
0:11:36.89,000 --> 0:11:44,000
we have a chance to go and to think of

235
0:11:43.11,000 --> 0:11:46,000
the future as something which is open to

236
0:11:45.81,000 --> 0:11:49,000
the world

237
0:11:46.56,000 --> 0:11:52,000
let us not reveal the mistake of Iran of

238
0:11:50.31,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Mosul de-evolution let us free ourselves

239
0:11:53.029,000 --> 0:11:57,000
especially in the West from thinking

240
0:11:55.649,000 --> 0:12:01,000
about that part of the world based on

241
0:11:57.69,000 --> 0:12:04,000
oil interest or based on interest of

242
0:12:02.089,000 --> 0:12:09,000
step illusion of stability and security

243
0:12:05.51,000 --> 0:12:13,000
security and the stability of

244
0:12:09.62,000 --> 0:12:14,000
authoritarian regimes cannot create but

245
0:12:13.56,000 --> 0:12:17,000
terrorism and valueless and destruction

246
0:12:15.48,000 --> 0:12:21,000
let us accept the choice of the people

247
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:24,000
let us not pick and choose who we would

248
0:12:21.779,000 --> 0:12:25,000
like to rule to rule the future the

249
0:12:24.149,000 --> 0:12:28,000
future should be ruled by people

250
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
themselves even sometimes there are

251
0:12:28.86,000 --> 0:12:34,000
voices that might now scare us but

252
0:12:32.54,000 --> 0:12:37,000
values of democracy and the freedom of

253
0:12:35.459,000 --> 0:12:39,000
choice that is swimming the Middle East

254
0:12:37.92,000 --> 0:12:41,000
at this moment in time is the best

255
0:12:39.93,000 --> 0:12:44,000
opportunity for the world for the west

256
0:12:42.18,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and the east to see stability and to see

257
0:12:45.899,000 --> 0:12:5,000
security and to see friendship and to

258
0:12:48.75,000 --> 0:12:52,000
see tolerance emerging from the Arab

259
0:12:51.18,000 --> 0:12:56,000
world rather than the images of violence

260
0:12:53.1,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and terrorism let us support these

261
0:12:56.25,000 --> 0:13:03,000
people let us stand for them and let us

262
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
give up our narrow selfishness in order

263
0:13:03.87,000 --> 0:13:07,000
to embrace change and in order to

264
0:13:06.42,000 --> 0:13:12,000
celebrate with the people of that region

265
0:13:08.37,000 --> 0:13:16,000
a great future and hope and tolerance

266
0:13:13.019,000 --> 0:13:2,000
the future has arrived and the future is

267
0:13:16.56,000 --> 0:13:19,000
now and thank you very much

268
0:13:38.6,000 --> 0:13:43,000
I just have a couple of questions for

269
0:13:41.839,000 --> 0:13:44,000
you thank you for coming here how would

270
0:13:44.209,000 --> 0:13:47,000
you characterize the historical

271
0:13:45.8,000 --> 0:13:49,000
significance of what's happened is is

272
0:13:47.959,000 --> 0:13:51,000
this in a story of the year a story of

273
0:13:50.12,000 --> 0:13:54,000
the decade or something more actually

274
0:13:52.94,000 --> 0:13:55,000
this is maybe the biggest the story that

275
0:13:54.529,000 --> 0:13:57,000
we have ever covered we have covered

276
0:13:56.029,000 --> 0:14:,000
many wars we have covered a lot of

277
0:13:58.339,000 --> 0:14:01,000
tragedies a lot of problems a lot of

278
0:14:00.199,000 --> 0:14:03,000
conflict zones a lot of hot spots in the

279
0:14:02.06,000 --> 0:14:05,000
region because we were centered at the

280
0:14:03.98,000 --> 0:14:07,000
middle of it but this is story there is

281
0:14:06.05,000 --> 0:14:11,000
great it is great story it is beautiful

282
0:14:08.839,000 --> 0:14:12,000
it is not something that you only cover

283
0:14:11.75,000 --> 0:14:14,000
because you have to cover a great

284
0:14:13.79,000 --> 0:14:17,000
incident it is something you are

285
0:14:15.319,000 --> 0:14:2,000
witnessing change in history you are

286
0:14:18.23,000 --> 0:14:22,000
witnessing a birth of a new era and this

287
0:14:21.11,000 --> 0:14:23,000
is what the soul is all about I mean

288
0:14:22.91,000 --> 0:14:26,000
there are a lot of people in the West

289
0:14:24.019,000 --> 0:14:29,000
who are still skeptical think this may

290
0:14:27.05,000 --> 0:14:33,000
just be a an intermediate stage before

291
0:14:29.569,000 --> 0:14:34,000
much more alarming chaos you really

292
0:14:33.11,000 --> 0:14:37,000
believe that if there are democratic

293
0:14:35.319,000 --> 0:14:39,000
elections in Egypt now that a government

294
0:14:38.089,000 --> 0:14:41,000
could emerge that espouses some of the

295
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
values you've spoken about so

296
0:14:41.69,000 --> 0:14:45,000
inspiringly and people actually after

297
0:14:44.389,000 --> 0:14:48,000
the collapse of the hustla Mubarak

298
0:14:46.279,000 --> 0:14:51,000
regime the youth who have organized

299
0:14:48.86,000 --> 0:14:53,000
themselves in certain groups and and

300
0:14:51.319,000 --> 0:14:56,000
councils they are guarding the

301
0:14:53.959,000 --> 0:14:58,000
transformation and they are trying to

302
0:14:56.72,000 --> 0:15:01,000
put it on a track in order to satisfy

303
0:14:59,000 --> 0:15:05,000
you know the values of democracy but at

304
0:15:02.149,000 --> 0:15:09,000
the same time also to make it reasonable

305
0:15:05.6,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and to make it rational not to be to go

306
0:15:09.439,000 --> 0:15:14,000
out of order in my opinion these people

307
0:15:12.38,000 --> 0:15:16,000
are much more wiser than not only the

308
0:15:14.93,000 --> 0:15:18,000
political elite even the intellectual

309
0:15:16.88,000 --> 0:15:2,000
elite even opposition leaders including

310
0:15:19.55,000 --> 0:15:23,000
political parties at this moment in time

311
0:15:21.649,000 --> 0:15:26,000
the youth in the Arab world are much

312
0:15:24.079,000 --> 0:15:3,000
more wiser and capable of creating the

313
0:15:26.81,000 --> 0:15:31,000
change than the old including the

314
0:15:30.259,000 --> 0:15:38,000
political and cultural and ideological

315
0:15:32.62,000 --> 0:15:4,000
old you know regimes so we are not

316
0:15:38.58,000 --> 0:15:42,000
we are not to get involved politically

317
0:15:40.95,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and interfere in that way what should

318
0:15:42.99,000 --> 0:15:47,000
people hear here at Ted here in the West

319
0:15:46.22,000 --> 0:15:49,000
do if they want to connect or make a

320
0:15:48.899,000 --> 0:15:51,000
difference and they believe in what's

321
0:15:50.19,000 --> 0:15:53,000
happening here I think you know we have

322
0:15:52.41,000 --> 0:15:56,000
discovered very important issue in the

323
0:15:54.029,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Arab world that people care people care

324
0:15:56.459,000 --> 0:16:,000
about this great transformation you know

325
0:15:59.25,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Mohammed Nana bhai who's sitting with us

326
0:16:01.2,000 --> 0:16:06,000
the head or gesture on it he told me

327
0:16:03.81,000 --> 0:16:1,000
that two thousand five hundred percent

328
0:16:07.17,000 --> 0:16:12,000

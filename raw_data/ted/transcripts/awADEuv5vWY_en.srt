1
0:00:12.722,000 --> 0:00:13,000
People don't realize

2
0:00:14.633,000 --> 0:00:18,000
that red light and benign near-infrared light

3
0:00:18.816,000 --> 0:00:21,000
go right through your hand, just like this.

4
0:00:23.157,000 --> 0:00:28,000
This fact could enable better, faster and cheaper health care.

5
0:00:28.696,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Our translucence is key here.

6
0:00:32.093,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I'm going to show you how we use this key and a couple of other keys

7
0:00:35.979,000 --> 0:00:37,000
to see deep inside our bodies and brains.

8
0:00:40.043,000 --> 0:00:41,000
OK, so first up ...

9
0:00:42.868,000 --> 0:00:45,000
You see this laser pointer and the spot it makes on my hand?

10
0:00:47.624,000 --> 0:00:48,000
The light goes right through my hand --

11
0:00:49.534,000 --> 0:00:51,000
if we could bring the lights down, please --

12
0:00:51.625,000 --> 0:00:52,000
as I've already shown.

13
0:00:52.83,000 --> 0:00:54,000
But you can no longer see that laser spot.

14
0:00:55.608,000 --> 0:00:56,000
You see my hand glow.

15
0:00:58.013,000 --> 0:01:01,000
That's because the light spreads out, it scatters.

16
0:01:02.226,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I need you to understand what scattering is,

17
0:01:05.458,000 --> 0:01:07,000
so I can show you how we get rid of it

18
0:01:08.284,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and see deep inside our bodies and brains.

19
0:01:12.419,000 --> 0:01:14,000
So, I've got a piece of chicken back here.

20
0:01:15.683,000 --> 0:01:16,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:17.093,000 --> 0:01:18,000
It's raw.

22
0:01:20.085,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Putting on some gloves.

23
0:01:21.727,000 --> 0:01:25,000
It's got the same optical properties as human flesh.

24
0:01:29.204,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So, here's the chicken ... putting it on the light.

25
0:01:34.744,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Can you see, the light goes right through?

26
0:01:38.731,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I also implanted a tumor in that chicken.

27
0:01:42.215,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Can you see it?

28
0:01:43.419,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Audience: Yes.

29
0:01:44.771,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Mary Lou Jepsen: So this means, using red light and infrared light,

30
0:01:49.467,000 --> 0:01:51,000
we can see tumors in human flesh.

31
0:01:53.117,000 --> 0:01:54,000
But there's a catch.

32
0:01:55.534,000 --> 0:01:57,000
When I throw another piece of chicken on it,

33
0:01:59.137,000 --> 0:02:,000
the light still goes through,

34
0:02:02.05,000 --> 0:02:04,000
but you can no longer see the tumor.

35
0:02:05.188,000 --> 0:02:07,000
That's because the light scatters.

36
0:02:08.633,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So we have to do something about the scatter

37
0:02:10.941,000 --> 0:02:11,000
so we can see the tumor.

38
0:02:14.055,000 --> 0:02:16,000
We have to de-scatter the light.

39
0:02:17.245,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So ...

40
0:02:19.785,000 --> 0:02:21,000
A technology I spent the early part of my career on

41
0:02:22.657,000 --> 0:02:23,000
enables de-scattering.

42
0:02:24.72,000 --> 0:02:25,000
It's called holography.

43
0:02:26.728,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And it won the Nobel Prize in physics in the 70s,

44
0:02:29.688,000 --> 0:02:33,000
because of the fantastic things it enables you to do with light.

45
0:02:34.879,000 --> 0:02:35,000
This is a hologram.

46
0:02:36.934,000 --> 0:02:4,000
It captures all of the light, all of the rays, all of the photons

47
0:02:41.529,000 --> 0:02:45,000
at all of the positions and all of the angles, simultaneously.

48
0:02:47.173,000 --> 0:02:48,000
It's amazing.

49
0:02:48.831,000 --> 0:02:5,000
To see what we can do with holography ...

50
0:02:53.022,000 --> 0:02:54,000
You see these marbles?

51
0:02:54.522,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Look at these marbles bouncing off of the barriers,

52
0:02:57.688,000 --> 0:03:,000
as an analogy to light being scattered by our bodies.

53
0:03:02.323,000 --> 0:03:06,000
As the marbles get to the bottom of the scattering maze,

54
0:03:06.363,000 --> 0:03:1,000
they're chaotic, they're scattering and bouncing everywhere.

55
0:03:11.046,000 --> 0:03:15,000
If we record a hologram at the bottom inside of the screen,

56
0:03:15.276,000 --> 0:03:21,000
we can record the position and angle of each marble exiting the maze.

57
0:03:22.339,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And then we can bring in marbles from below

58
0:03:26.061,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and have the hologram direct each marble to exactly the right position and angle,

59
0:03:32.233,000 --> 0:03:37,000
such as they emerge in a line at the top of the scatter matrix.

60
0:03:39.162,000 --> 0:03:4,000
We're going to do that with this.

61
0:03:41.732,000 --> 0:03:45,000
This is optically similar to human brain.

62
0:03:46.787,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I'm going to switch to green light now,

63
0:03:49.501,000 --> 0:03:52,000
because green light is brighter to your eyes than red or infrared,

64
0:03:53.283,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and I really need you to see this.

65
0:03:55.665,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So we're going to put a hologram in front of this brain

66
0:04:00.514,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and make a stream of light come out of it.

67
0:04:04.831,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Seems impossible but it isn't.

68
0:04:07.784,000 --> 0:04:09,000
This is the setup you're going to see.

69
0:04:10.014,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Green light.

70
0:04:12.514,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Hologram here, green light going in,

71
0:04:15.403,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that's our brain.

72
0:04:18.458,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And a stream of light comes out of it.

73
0:04:22.873,000 --> 0:04:26,000
We just made a brain lase of densely scattering tissue.

74
0:04:27.627,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Seems impossible, no one's done this before,

75
0:04:30.921,000 --> 0:04:32,000
you're the first public audience to ever see this.

76
0:04:33.685,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Applause)

77
0:04:38.495,000 --> 0:04:41,000
What this means is that we can focus deep into tissue.

78
0:04:42.805,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Our translucency is the first key.

79
0:04:45.839,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Holography enabling de-scattering is the second key

80
0:04:49.894,000 --> 0:04:52,000
to enable us to see deep inside of our bodies and brains.

81
0:04:54.981,000 --> 0:04:55,000
You're probably thinking,

82
0:04:57.118,000 --> 0:05:,000
"Sounds good, but what about skull and bones?

83
0:05:00.151,000 --> 0:05:04,000
How are you going to see through the brain without seeing through bone?"

84
0:05:04.245,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Well, this is real human skull.

85
0:05:07.188,000 --> 0:05:1,000
We ordered it at skullsunlimited.com.

86
0:05:10.347,000 --> 0:05:11,000
(Laughter)

87
0:05:12.117,000 --> 0:05:13,000
No kidding.

88
0:05:13.379,000 --> 0:05:17,000
But we treat this skull with great respect at our lab and here at TED.

89
0:05:18.127,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And as you can see,

90
0:05:20.77,000 --> 0:05:21,000
the red light goes right through it.

91
0:05:23.912,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Goes through our bones.

92
0:05:25.471,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So we can go through skull and bones and flesh with just red light.

93
0:05:31.268,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Gamma rays and X-rays do that, too, but they cause tumors.

94
0:05:35.637,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Red light is all around us.

95
0:05:39.137,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So, using that, I'm going to come back here

96
0:05:42.065,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and show you something more useful than making a brain lase.

97
0:05:46.229,000 --> 0:05:49,000
We challenged ourselves to see how fine we could focus through brain tissue.

98
0:05:50.967,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Focusing through this brain,

99
0:05:53.093,000 --> 0:05:57,000
it was such a fine focus, we put a bare camera die in front of it.

100
0:05:58.288,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And the bare camera die ...

101
0:06:03.454,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Could you turn down the spotlight?

102
0:06:05.105,000 --> 0:06:06,000
OK, there it is.

103
0:06:07.117,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Do you see that?

104
0:06:08.3,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Each pixel is two-thousandths of a millimeter wide.

105
0:06:13.673,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Two microns.

106
0:06:15.101,000 --> 0:06:18,000
That means that spot focus -- full width half max --

107
0:06:18.514,000 --> 0:06:19,000
is six to eight microns.

108
0:06:21.006,000 --> 0:06:23,000
To give you an idea of what that means:

109
0:06:24.442,000 --> 0:06:28,000
that's the diameter of the smallest neuron in the human brain.

110
0:06:29.3,000 --> 0:06:33,000
So that means we can focus through skull and brain to a neuron.

111
0:06:34.104,000 --> 0:06:37,000
No one has seen this before, we're doing this for the first time here.

112
0:06:38.207,000 --> 0:06:39,000
It's not impossible.

113
0:06:39.82,000 --> 0:06:4,000
(Applause)

114
0:06:41.786,000 --> 0:06:43,000
We made it work with our system, so we've made a breakthrough.

115
0:06:44.792,000 --> 0:06:45,000
(Laughter)

116
0:06:46.617,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Just to give an idea -- like, that's not just 50 marbles.

117
0:06:49.593,000 --> 0:06:51,000
That's billions, trillion of photons,

118
0:06:52.514,000 --> 0:06:55,000
all falling in line as directed by the hologram,

119
0:06:55.934,000 --> 0:07:,000
to ricochet through densely scattering brain,

120
0:07:01.029,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and emerge as a focus.

121
0:07:03.99,000 --> 0:07:05,000
It's pretty cool.

122
0:07:06.022,000 --> 0:07:07,000
We're excited about it.

123
0:07:07.728,000 --> 0:07:09,000
This is an MRI machine.

124
0:07:09.784,000 --> 0:07:11,000
It's a few million dollars, it fills a room,

125
0:07:11.97,000 --> 0:07:13,000
many people have probably been in one.

126
0:07:14.18,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I've spent a lot of time in one.

127
0:07:15.744,000 --> 0:07:17,000
It has a focus of about a millimeter --

128
0:07:18.165,000 --> 0:07:2,000
kind of chunky, compared to what I just showed you.

129
0:07:21.022,000 --> 0:07:26,000
A system based on our technology could enable dramatically lower cost,

130
0:07:26.704,000 --> 0:07:27,000
higher resolution

131
0:07:28.543,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and smaller medical imaging.

132
0:07:31.68,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So that's what we've started to do.

133
0:07:34.18,000 --> 0:07:38,000
My team and I have built a rig, a lab rig

134
0:07:38.432,000 --> 0:07:39,000
to scan out tissue.

135
0:07:40.797,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And here it is in action.

136
0:07:42.932,000 --> 0:07:44,000
We wanted to see how good we could do.

137
0:07:46.535,000 --> 0:07:48,000
We've built this over the last year.

138
0:07:49.626,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And the result is,

139
0:07:51.814,000 --> 0:07:55,000
we're able to find tumors

140
0:07:56.175,000 --> 0:07:57,000
in this sample --

141
0:07:57.369,000 --> 0:08:,000
70 millimeters deep, the light going in here,

142
0:08:00.534,000 --> 0:08:02,000
half a millimeter resolution,

143
0:08:02.772,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and that's the tumor it found.

144
0:08:05.526,000 --> 0:08:07,000
You're probably looking at this,

145
0:08:08.011,000 --> 0:08:12,000
like, "Sounds good, but that's kind of a big system.

146
0:08:13.026,000 --> 0:08:17,000
It's smaller than a honking-big MRI machine,

147
0:08:17.601,000 --> 0:08:18,000
monster MRI machine,

148
0:08:18.975,000 --> 0:08:2,000
but can you do something to shrink it down?"

149
0:08:22.038,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And the answer is:

150
0:08:23.846,000 --> 0:08:24,000
of course.

151
0:08:25.04,000 --> 0:08:28,000
We can replace each big element in that system

152
0:08:28.684,000 --> 0:08:29,000
with a smaller component --

153
0:08:30.303,000 --> 0:08:31,000
a little integrated circuit,

154
0:08:32.224,000 --> 0:08:36,000
a display chip the size of a child's fingernail.

155
0:08:37.451,000 --> 0:08:38,000
A bit about my background:

156
0:08:39.03,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I've spent the last two decades inventing, prototype-developing

157
0:08:45.289,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and then shipping billions of dollars of consumer electronics --

158
0:08:50.272,000 --> 0:08:52,000
with full custom chips --

159
0:08:52.601,000 --> 0:08:54,000
on the hairy edge of optical physics.

160
0:08:55.919,000 --> 0:08:59,000
So my team and I built the big lab rig

161
0:09:00.625,000 --> 0:09:04,000
to perfect our architecture and test the corner cases

162
0:09:05.849,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and really fine-tune our chip designs,

163
0:09:08.064,000 --> 0:09:11,000
before spending the millions of dollars to fabricate each chip.

164
0:09:12.318,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Our new chip inventions slim down the system, speed it up

165
0:09:17.014,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and enable rapid scanning and de-scattering of light

166
0:09:21.121,000 --> 0:09:22,000
to see deep into our bodies.

167
0:09:23.498,000 --> 0:09:28,000
This is the third key to enable better, faster and cheaper health care.

168
0:09:33.577,000 --> 0:09:39,000
This is a mock-up of something that can replace the functionality

169
0:09:40.306,000 --> 0:09:42,000
of a multimillion-dollar MRI machine

170
0:09:43.3,000 --> 0:09:45,000
into a consumer electronics price point,

171
0:09:46.014,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that you could wear as a bandage, line a ski hat, put inside a pillow.

172
0:09:51.882,000 --> 0:09:52,000
That's what we're building.

173
0:09:53.578,000 --> 0:09:54,000
(Applause)

174
0:09:54.771,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Oh, thanks!

175
0:09:56.074,000 --> 0:09:58,000
(Applause)

176
0:09:59.073,000 --> 0:10:01,000
So you're probably thinking,

177
0:10:01.236,000 --> 0:10:03,000
"I get the light going through our bodies.

178
0:10:04.911,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I even get the holography de-scattering the light.

179
0:10:08.656,000 --> 0:10:1,000
But how do we use these new chip inventions, exactly,

180
0:10:11.547,000 --> 0:10:12,000
to do the scanning?"

181
0:10:13.903,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Well, we have a sound approach.

182
0:10:16.411,000 --> 0:10:17,000
No, literally -- we use sound.

183
0:10:18.949,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Here, these three discs represent the integrated circuits

184
0:10:23.073,000 --> 0:10:24,000
that we've designed,

185
0:10:24.562,000 --> 0:10:28,000
that massively reduce the size of our current bulky system.

186
0:10:30.157,000 --> 0:10:33,000
One of the spots, one of the chips, emits a sonic ping,

187
0:10:34.369,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and it focuses down,

188
0:10:36.696,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and then we turn red light on.

189
0:10:39.347,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And the red light that goes through that sonic spot

190
0:10:42.767,000 --> 0:10:44,000
changes color slightly,

191
0:10:45.68,000 --> 0:10:48,000
much like the pitch of the police car siren changes

192
0:10:48.709,000 --> 0:10:49,000
as it speeds past you.

193
0:10:52.042,000 --> 0:10:53,000
So.

194
0:10:53.307,000 --> 0:10:56,000
There's this other thing about holography I haven't told you yet,

195
0:10:56.632,000 --> 0:10:57,000
that you need to know.

196
0:10:58.427,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Only two beams of exactly the same color can make a hologram.

197
0:11:03.8,000 --> 0:11:08,000
So, that's the orange light that's coming off of the sonic spot,

198
0:11:09.18,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that's changed color slightly,

199
0:11:11.387,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and we create a glowing disc of orange light

200
0:11:15.06,000 --> 0:11:16,000
underneath a neighboring chip

201
0:11:17.212,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and then record a hologram on the camera chip.

202
0:11:21.362,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Like so.

203
0:11:22.601,000 --> 0:11:27,000
From that hologram, we can extract information just about that sonic spot,

204
0:11:27.958,000 --> 0:11:29,000
because we filter out all of the red light.

205
0:11:32.037,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Then, we can optionally focus the light back down into the brain

206
0:11:35.988,000 --> 0:11:38,000
to stimulate a neuron or part of the brain.

207
0:11:39.195,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And then we move on to shift the sonic focus to another spot.

208
0:11:44.323,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And that way, spot by spot, we scan out the brain.

209
0:11:49.309,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Our chips decode holograms

210
0:11:51.976,000 --> 0:11:56,000
a bit like Rosalind Franklin decoded this iconic image of X-ray diffraction

211
0:11:57.764,000 --> 0:12:,000
to reveal the structure of DNA for the first time.

212
0:12:01.379,000 --> 0:12:04,000
We're doing that electronically with our chips,

213
0:12:04.595,000 --> 0:12:07,000
recording the image and decoding the information,

214
0:12:08.356,000 --> 0:12:09,000
in a millionth of a second.

215
0:12:10.612,000 --> 0:12:11,000
We scan fast.

216
0:12:13.625,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Our system may be extraordinary at finding blood.

217
0:12:17.534,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And that's because blood absorbs red light and infrared light.

218
0:12:21.439,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Blood is red.

219
0:12:23.995,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Here's a beaker of blood.

220
0:12:25.407,000 --> 0:12:26,000
I'm going to show you.

221
0:12:27.704,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And here's our laser, going right through it.

222
0:12:31.18,000 --> 0:12:33,000
It really is a laser, you can see it on the -- there it is.

223
0:12:34.133,000 --> 0:12:37,000
In comparison to my pound of flesh,

224
0:12:38.098,000 --> 0:12:4,000
where you can see the light goes everywhere.

225
0:12:41.415,000 --> 0:12:43,000
So let's see that again, blood.

226
0:12:44.303,000 --> 0:12:46,000
This is really key: blood absorbs light,

227
0:12:47.989,000 --> 0:12:49,000
flesh scatters light.

228
0:12:51.133,000 --> 0:12:52,000
This is significant,

229
0:12:52.545,000 --> 0:12:55,000
because every tumor bigger than a cubic millimeter or two

230
0:12:56.434,000 --> 0:12:59,000
has five times the amount of blood as normal flesh.

231
0:13:01.069,000 --> 0:13:05,000
So with our system, you can imagine detecting cancers early,

232
0:13:05.715,000 --> 0:13:07,000
when intervention is easy,

233
0:13:07.879,000 --> 0:13:1,000
or tracking the size of your tumor as it grows or shrinks.

234
0:13:12.338,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Our system also should be extraordinary at finding out where blood isn't,

235
0:13:17.498,000 --> 0:13:18,000
like a clogged artery,

236
0:13:19.244,000 --> 0:13:21,000
or the color change in blood

237
0:13:21.269,000 --> 0:13:24,000
as it carries oxygen versus not carrying oxygen,

238
0:13:24.881,000 --> 0:13:26,000
which is a way to measure neural activity.

239
0:13:28.872,000 --> 0:13:32,000
There's a saying that "sunlight" is the best disinfectant.

240
0:13:33.53,000 --> 0:13:34,000
It's literally true.

241
0:13:35.563,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Researchers are killing pneumonia in lungs by shining light deep inside of lungs.

242
0:13:41.749,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Our system could enable this noninvasively.

243
0:13:45.932,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Let me give you three more examples of what this technology can do.

244
0:13:50.592,000 --> 0:13:51,000
One: stroke.

245
0:13:52.601,000 --> 0:13:54,000
There's two major kinds of stroke:

246
0:13:54.892,000 --> 0:13:56,000
the one caused by clogs

247
0:13:57.068,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and another caused by rupture.

248
0:13:59.053,000 --> 0:14:03,000
If you can determine the type of stroke within an hour or two,

249
0:14:03.175,000 --> 0:14:07,000
you can give medication to massively reduce the damage to the brain.

250
0:14:08.358,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Get the drug wrong,

251
0:14:10.675,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and the patient dies.

252
0:14:12.752,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Today, that means access to an MRI scanner within an hour or two of a stroke.

253
0:14:18.306,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Tomorrow, with compact, portable, inexpensive imaging,

254
0:14:22.601,000 --> 0:14:25,000
every ambulance and every clinic can decode the type of stroke

255
0:14:26.455,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and get the right therapy on time.

256
0:14:30.396,000 --> 0:14:34,000
(Applause)

257
0:14:34.441,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Thanks.

258
0:14:36.155,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Two:

259
0:14:38.085,000 --> 0:14:42,000
two-thirds of humanity lacks access to medical imaging.

260
0:14:43.394,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Compact, portable, inexpensive medical imaging can save countless lives.

261
0:14:49.347,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And three:

262
0:14:50.926,000 --> 0:14:52,000
brain-computer communication.

263
0:14:53.529,000 --> 0:14:57,000
I've shown here onstage our system focusing through skull and brain

264
0:14:57.901,000 --> 0:14:59,000
to the diameter of the smallest neuron.

265
0:15:01.187,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Using light and sound, you can activate or inhibit neurons,

266
0:15:05.498,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and simultaneously, we can match spec by spec

267
0:15:09.014,000 --> 0:15:11,000
the resolution of an fMRI scanner,

268
0:15:11.744,000 --> 0:15:13,000
which measures oxygen use in the brain.

269
0:15:14.276,000 --> 0:15:17,000
We do that by looking at the color change in the blood,

270
0:15:17.641,000 --> 0:15:19,000
rather than using a two-ton magnet.

271
0:15:21.541,000 --> 0:15:27,000
So you can imagine that with fMRI scanners today,

272
0:15:28.617,000 --> 0:15:32,000
we can decode the imagined words, images and dreams of those being scanned.

273
0:15:33.665,000 --> 0:15:36,000
We're working on a system that puts all three of these capabilities

274
0:15:37.006,000 --> 0:15:38,000
into the same system --

275
0:15:38.577,000 --> 0:15:41,000
neural read and write with light and sound,

276
0:15:41.815,000 --> 0:15:45,000
while simultaneously mapping oxygen use in the brain --

277
0:15:45.966,000 --> 0:15:47,000
all together in a noninvasive portable

278
0:15:48.577,000 --> 0:15:5,000
that can enable brain-computer communication,

279
0:15:51.387,000 --> 0:15:55,000
no implants, no surgery, no optional brain surgery required.

280
0:15:56.061,000 --> 0:15:58,000
This can do enormous good

281
0:15:58.165,000 --> 0:16:02,000
for the two billion people that suffer globally with brain disease.

282
0:16:04.02,000 --> 0:16:09,000
(Applause)

283
0:16:09.179,000 --> 0:16:1,000
People ask me how deep we can go.

284
0:16:11.093,000 --> 0:16:13,000
And the answer is: the whole body's in reach.

285
0:16:14.046,000 --> 0:16:16,000
But here's another way to look at it.

286
0:16:20.8,000 --> 0:16:21,000
(Laughter)

287
0:16:22.228,000 --> 0:16:24,000
My whole head just lit up, you want to see it again?

288
0:16:24.864,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Audience: Yes!

289
0:16:26.118,000 --> 0:16:27,000
(Laughter)

290
0:16:28.442,000 --> 0:16:3,000
MLJ: This looks scary, but it's not.

291
0:16:31.046,000 --> 0:16:33,000
What's truly scary is not knowing about our bodies,

292
0:16:34.053,000 --> 0:16:35,000
our brains and our diseases

293
0:16:36.069,000 --> 0:16:37,000
so we can effectively treat them.

294
0:16:38.038,000 --> 0:16:39,000
This technology can help.

295
0:16:39.72,000 --> 0:16:4,000
Thank you.

296
0:16:40.895,000 --> 0:16:45,000
(Applause)

297
0:16:46.373,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Thank you.

298
0:16:47.548,000 --> 0:16:48,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:16.008,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Sydney. I had been waiting my whole life to get to Sydney.

3
0:00:19.687,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I got to the airport, to the hotel, checked in,

4
0:00:22.734,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and, sitting there in the lobby, was a brochure

5
0:00:25.513,000 --> 0:00:27,000
for the Sydney Festival. I thumbed through it,

6
0:00:28.135,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and I came across a show called "Minto: Live."

7
0:00:31.276,000 --> 0:00:34,000
The description read: "The suburban streets of Minto

8
0:00:34.908,000 --> 0:00:36,000
become the stage for performances

9
0:00:37.449,000 --> 0:00:39,000
created by international artists

10
0:00:39.655,000 --> 0:00:41,000
in collaboration with the people of Minto."

11
0:00:42.455,000 --> 0:00:44,000
What was this place called Minto?

12
0:00:45.17,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Sydney, as I would learn, is a city of suburbs,

13
0:00:47.531,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and Minto lies southwest, about an hour away.

14
0:00:51.204,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I have to say, it wasn't exactly what I had in mind

15
0:00:54.563,000 --> 0:00:55,000
for my first day down under.

16
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I mean, I'd thought about the Harbour Bridge or Bondi Beach,

17
0:00:59.099,000 --> 0:01:01,000
but Minto? But still, I'm a producer,

18
0:01:02.055,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and the lure of a site-specific theater project

19
0:01:05.227,000 --> 0:01:07,000
was more than I could resist. (Laughter)

20
0:01:07.496,000 --> 0:01:09,000
So, off I went into Friday afternoon traffic,

21
0:01:09.98,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and I'll never forget what I saw when I got there.

22
0:01:12.385,000 --> 0:01:14,000
For the performance, the audience walked

23
0:01:15.039,000 --> 0:01:17,000
around the neighborhood from house to house,

24
0:01:17.829,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and the residents, who were the performers,

25
0:01:20.709,000 --> 0:01:22,000
they came out of their houses, and they performed

26
0:01:22.82,000 --> 0:01:25,000
these autobiographical dances on their lawns,

27
0:01:26.659,000 --> 0:01:28,000
on their driveways. (Laughter)

28
0:01:29.007,000 --> 0:01:31,000
The show is a collaboration with a U.K.-based

29
0:01:31.975,000 --> 0:01:33,000
performance company called Lone Twin.

30
0:01:34.634,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Lone Twin had come to Minto and worked

31
0:01:36.53,000 --> 0:01:39,000
with the residents, and they had created these dances.

32
0:01:39.654,000 --> 0:01:42,000
This Australian-Indian girl, she came out and started

33
0:01:43.492,000 --> 0:01:45,000
to dance on her front lawn,

34
0:01:45.513,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and her father peered out the window to see

35
0:01:48.451,000 --> 0:01:5,000
what all the noise and commotion was about,

36
0:01:50.958,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and he soon joined her.

37
0:01:53.166,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And he was followed by her little sister.

38
0:01:56.293,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And soon they were all dancing this joyous,

39
0:01:59.351,000 --> 0:02:03,000
exuberant dance right there on their lawn. (Laughter)

40
0:02:03.526,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And as I walked through the neighborhood,

41
0:02:05.718,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I was amazed and I was moved by the incredible

42
0:02:09.939,000 --> 0:02:11,000
sense of ownership this community clearly felt

43
0:02:12.376,000 --> 0:02:14,000
about this event.

44
0:02:14.946,000 --> 0:02:16,000
"Minto: Live" brought Sydneysiders into dialogue

45
0:02:17.905,000 --> 0:02:2,000
with international artists, and really celebrated

46
0:02:21.235,000 --> 0:02:24,000
the diversity of Sydney on its own terms.

47
0:02:24.723,000 --> 0:02:27,000
The Sydney Festival which produced "Minto: Live" I think

48
0:02:28.436,000 --> 0:02:31,000
represents a new kind of 21st-century arts festival.

49
0:02:32.211,000 --> 0:02:35,000
These festivals are radically open.

50
0:02:35.726,000 --> 0:02:38,000
They can transform cities and communities.

51
0:02:39.438,000 --> 0:02:41,000
To understand this, I think it kind of makes sense

52
0:02:42.118,000 --> 0:02:44,000
to look where we've come from.

53
0:02:44.444,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Modern arts festivals were born

54
0:02:46.467,000 --> 0:02:47,000
in the rubble of World War II.

55
0:02:47.965,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Civic leaders created these annual events

56
0:02:50.567,000 --> 0:02:53,000
to celebrate culture as the highest

57
0:02:53.676,000 --> 0:02:55,000
expression of the human spirit.

58
0:02:56.281,000 --> 0:02:59,000
In 1947, the Edinburgh Festival was born

59
0:02:59.364,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and Avignon was born and hundreds of others

60
0:03:02.021,000 --> 0:03:03,000
would follow in their wake.

61
0:03:03.922,000 --> 0:03:06,000
The work they did was very, very high art,

62
0:03:07.174,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and stars came along like Laurie Anderson

63
0:03:09.778,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and Merce Cunningham and Robert Lepage

64
0:03:12.053,000 --> 0:03:13,000
who made work for this circuit,

65
0:03:13.473,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and you had these seminal shows like "The Mahabharata"

66
0:03:16.244,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and the monumental "Einstein on the Beach."

67
0:03:19.229,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But as the decades passed,

68
0:03:21.724,000 --> 0:03:24,000
these festivals, they really became the establishment,

69
0:03:24.925,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and as the culture and capital accelerated,

70
0:03:28.318,000 --> 0:03:3,000
the Internet brought us all together,

71
0:03:30.319,000 --> 0:03:32,000
high and low kind of disappeared,

72
0:03:33.251,000 --> 0:03:34,000
a new kind of festival emerged.

73
0:03:34.873,000 --> 0:03:37,000
The old festivals, they continued to thrive, but

74
0:03:38.012,000 --> 0:03:42,000
from Brighton to Rio to Perth, something new was emerging,

75
0:03:42.36,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and these festivals were really different.

76
0:03:45.304,000 --> 0:03:47,000
They're open, these festivals, because, like in Minto,

77
0:03:48.199,000 --> 0:03:5,000
they understand that the dialogue

78
0:03:50.415,000 --> 0:03:53,000
between the local and the global is essential.

79
0:03:54.133,000 --> 0:03:58,000
They're open because they ask the audience to be a player,

80
0:03:58.636,000 --> 0:04:02,000
a protagonist, a partner, rather than a passive spectator,

81
0:04:03.046,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and they're open because they know that imagination

82
0:04:06.625,000 --> 0:04:08,000
cannot be contained in buildings,

83
0:04:08.784,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and so much of the work they do

84
0:04:10.637,000 --> 0:04:13,000
is site-specific or outdoor work.

85
0:04:13.937,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So, the new festival, it asks the audience to play

86
0:04:17.325,000 --> 0:04:2,000
an essential role in shaping the performance.

87
0:04:20.443,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Companies like De La Guarda, which I produce, and Punchdrunk

88
0:04:25.539,000 --> 0:04:27,000
create these completely immersive experiences

89
0:04:28.353,000 --> 0:04:31,000
that put the audience at the center of the action,

90
0:04:31.548,000 --> 0:04:34,000
but the German performance company Rimini Protokoll

91
0:04:34.65,000 --> 0:04:37,000
takes this all to a whole new level.

92
0:04:37.937,000 --> 0:04:4,000
In a series of shows that includes "100 Percent Vancouver,"

93
0:04:41.719,000 --> 0:04:44,000
"100 Percent Berlin," Rimini Protokoll makes shows

94
0:04:45.716,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that actually reflect society.

95
0:04:48.549,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Rimini Protokoll chooses 100 people that represent that city

96
0:04:53.086,000 --> 0:04:56,000
at that moment in terms of race and gender and class,

97
0:04:56.497,000 --> 0:04:59,000
through a careful process that begins three months before,

98
0:04:59.771,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and then those 100 people share stories about

99
0:05:02.998,000 --> 0:05:04,000
themselves and their lives, and the whole thing

100
0:05:05.534,000 --> 0:05:09,000
becomes a snapshot of that city at that moment.

101
0:05:10.156,000 --> 0:05:13,000
LIFT has always been a pioneer in the use of venues.

102
0:05:13.591,000 --> 0:05:15,000
They understand that theater and performance

103
0:05:16.002,000 --> 0:05:17,000
can happen anywhere.

104
0:05:17.32,000 --> 0:05:2,000
You can do a show in a schoolroom,

105
0:05:20.529,000 --> 0:05:22,000
in an airport, — (Laughter) —

106
0:05:22.914,000 --> 0:05:24,000
in a department store window.

107
0:05:25.399,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Artists are explorers. Who better to show us the city anew?

108
0:05:29.821,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Artists can take us to a far-flung part of the city

109
0:05:33.168,000 --> 0:05:35,000
that we haven't explored, or they can take us into

110
0:05:35.196,000 --> 0:05:39,000
that building that we pass every day but we never went into.

111
0:05:39.621,000 --> 0:05:43,000
An artist, I think, can really show us people

112
0:05:43.784,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that we might overlook in our lives.

113
0:05:46.923,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Back to Back is an Australian company of people

114
0:05:50.318,000 --> 0:05:54,000
with intellectual disabilities. I saw their amazing show

115
0:05:54.904,000 --> 0:05:57,000
in New York at the Staten Island Ferry Terminal

116
0:05:58.073,000 --> 0:05:59,000
at rush hour.

117
0:05:59.483,000 --> 0:06:01,000
We, the audience, were given headsets and seated

118
0:06:02.203,000 --> 0:06:04,000
on one side of the terminal.

119
0:06:04.987,000 --> 0:06:05,000
The actors were right there in front of us,

120
0:06:06.979,000 --> 0:06:08,000
right there among the commuters,

121
0:06:09.389,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and we could hear them,

122
0:06:10.949,000 --> 0:06:13,000
but we might not have otherwise seen them.

123
0:06:14.044,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So Back to Back takes site-specific theater and uses it

124
0:06:18.562,000 --> 0:06:21,000
to gently remind us about who and what we choose

125
0:06:21.836,000 --> 0:06:23,000
to edit out of our daily lives.

126
0:06:24.727,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So, the dialogue with the local and the global,

127
0:06:27.839,000 --> 0:06:3,000
the audience as participant and player and protagonist,

128
0:06:31.749,000 --> 0:06:34,000
the innovative use of site, all of these things

129
0:06:34.877,000 --> 0:06:36,000
come to play in the amazing work

130
0:06:37.726,000 --> 0:06:41,000
of the fantastic French company Royal de Luxe.

131
0:06:41.783,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Royal de Luxe's giant puppets come into a city

132
0:06:45.523,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and they live there for a few days.

133
0:06:48.276,000 --> 0:06:51,000
For "The Sultan's Elephant," Royal de Luxe

134
0:06:51.85,000 --> 0:06:54,000
came to central London and brought it to a standstill

135
0:06:54.873,000 --> 0:06:58,000
with their story of a giant little girl and her friend,

136
0:06:59.262,000 --> 0:07:01,000
a time-traveling elephant.

137
0:07:01.774,000 --> 0:07:05,000
For a few days, they transformed a massive city

138
0:07:06.443,000 --> 0:07:1,000
into a community where endless possibility reigned.

139
0:07:11.346,000 --> 0:07:14,000
The Guardian wrote, "If art is about transformation,

140
0:07:14.937,000 --> 0:07:17,000
then there can be no more transformative experience.

141
0:07:18.927,000 --> 0:07:21,000
What 'The Sultan's Elephant' represents is no less

142
0:07:22.827,000 --> 0:07:24,000
than an artistic occupation of the city

143
0:07:25.673,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and a reclamation of the streets for the people."

144
0:07:30.55,000 --> 0:07:33,000
We can talk about the economic impacts of these festivals

145
0:07:34.01,000 --> 0:07:38,000
on their cities, but I'm much [more] interested in many more things,

146
0:07:38.316,000 --> 0:07:41,000
like how a festival helps a city to express itself,

147
0:07:42.081,000 --> 0:07:45,000
how it lets it come into its own.

148
0:07:45.352,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Festivals promote diversity,

149
0:07:47.477,000 --> 0:07:48,000
they bring neighbors into dialogue,

150
0:07:49.463,000 --> 0:07:51,000
they increase creativity,

151
0:07:51.908,000 --> 0:07:54,000
they offer opportunities for civic pride,

152
0:07:55.08,000 --> 0:07:58,000
they improve our general psychological well-being.

153
0:07:58.739,000 --> 0:08:02,000
In short, they make cities better places to live.

154
0:08:02.947,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Case in point:

155
0:08:03.925,000 --> 0:08:06,000
When "The Sultan's Elephant" came to London

156
0:08:07.269,000 --> 0:08:11,000
just nine months after 7/7, a Londoner wrote,

157
0:08:11.625,000 --> 0:08:14,000
"For the first time since the London bombings,

158
0:08:15.258,000 --> 0:08:18,000
my daughter called up with that sparkle back in her voice.

159
0:08:18.868,000 --> 0:08:19,000
She had gathered with others

160
0:08:20.61,000 --> 0:08:23,000
to watch 'The Sultan's Elephant,' and, you know,

161
0:08:23.798,000 --> 0:08:25,000
it just made all the difference."

162
0:08:26.481,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Lyn Gardner in The Guardian has written

163
0:08:28.631,000 --> 0:08:32,000
that a great festival can show us a map of the world,

164
0:08:33.094,000 --> 0:08:37,000
a map of the city and a map of ourselves,

165
0:08:37.142,000 --> 0:08:4,000
but there is no one fixed festival model.

166
0:08:40.348,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I think what's so brilliant about the festivals,

167
0:08:43.184,000 --> 0:08:48,000
the new festivals, is that they are really fully capturing

168
0:08:48.25,000 --> 0:08:51,000
the complexity and the excitement

169
0:08:51.438,000 --> 0:08:53,000
of the way we all live today.

170
0:08:53.463,000 --> 0:09:,000
Thank you very much. (Applause)

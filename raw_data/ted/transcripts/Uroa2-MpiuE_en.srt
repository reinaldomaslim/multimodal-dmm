0:00:12.754,000 --> 0:00:13,000
This weekend,

2
0:00:14.389,000 --> 0:00:16,000
tens of millions of people in the United States

3
0:00:17,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and tens of millions more around the world,

4
0:00:19.302,000 --> 0:00:21,000
in Columbus, Georgia, in Cardiff, Wales,

5
0:00:22.255,000 --> 0:00:24,000
in Chongqing, China, in Chennai, India

6
0:00:25.236,000 --> 0:00:26,000
will leave their homes,

7
0:00:27.165,000 --> 0:00:3,000
they'll get in their cars or they'll take public transportation

8
0:00:30.387,000 --> 0:00:32,000
or they will carry themselves by foot,

9
0:00:33.046,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and they'll step into a room

10
0:00:34.823,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and sit down next to someone they don't know

11
0:00:37.514,000 --> 0:00:38,000
or maybe someone they do,

12
0:00:39.982,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and the lights will go down and they'll watch a movie.

13
0:00:44.228,000 --> 0:00:47,000
They'll watch movies about aliens or robots,

14
0:00:47.53,000 --> 0:00:5,000
or robot aliens or regular people.

15
0:00:50.911,000 --> 0:00:53,000
But they will all be movies about what it means to be human.

16
0:00:55.831,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Millions will feel awe or fear,

17
0:00:58.982,000 --> 0:01:,000
millions will laugh and millions will cry.

18
0:01:02.625,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And then the lights will come back on,

19
0:01:04.506,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and they'll reemerge into the world they knew several hours prior.

20
0:01:08.014,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And millions of people will look at the world

21
0:01:10.212,000 --> 0:01:12,000
a little bit differently than they did when they went in.

22
0:01:14.53,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Like going to temple or a mosque or a church,

23
0:01:18.284,000 --> 0:01:2,000
or any other religious institution,

24
0:01:20.331,000 --> 0:01:23,000
movie-going is, in many ways, a sacred ritual.

25
0:01:23.95,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Repeated week after week after week.

26
0:01:28.318,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I'll be there this weekend,

27
0:01:30.104,000 --> 0:01:34,000
just like I was on most weekends between the years of 1996 and 1990,

28
0:01:34.556,000 --> 0:01:35,000
at the multiplex, near the shopping mall

29
0:01:36.53,000 --> 0:01:39,000
about five miles from my childhood home in Columbus, Georgia.

30
0:01:40.038,000 --> 0:01:43,000
The funny thing is that somewhere between then and now,

31
0:01:43.638,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I accidentally changed part of the conversation

32
0:01:46.109,000 --> 0:01:48,000
about which of those movies get made.

33
0:01:49.003,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So, the story actually begins in 2005, in an office high above Sunset Boulevard,

34
0:01:53.355,000 --> 0:01:54,000
where I was a junior executive

35
0:01:54.816,000 --> 0:01:56,000
at Leonardo DiCaprio's production company Appian Way.

36
0:01:57.784,000 --> 0:02:,000
And for those of you who aren't familiar with how the film industry works,

37
0:02:01.291,000 --> 0:02:04,000
it basically means that I was one of a few people behind the person

38
0:02:04.65,000 --> 0:02:07,000
who produces the movie for the people behind and in front of the camera,

39
0:02:08.104,000 --> 0:02:1,000
whose names you will better recognize than mine.

40
0:02:10.863,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Essentially, you're an assistant movie producer who does the unglamorous work

41
0:02:14.602,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that goes into the creative aspect of producing a movie.

42
0:02:17.76,000 --> 0:02:19,000
You make lists of writers and directors and actors

43
0:02:20.173,000 --> 0:02:23,000
who might be right for movies that you want to will into existence;

44
0:02:23.387,000 --> 0:02:25,000
you meet with many of them and their representatives,

45
0:02:25.934,000 --> 0:02:27,000
hoping to curry favor for some future date.

46
0:02:28.474,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And you read, a lot.

47
0:02:31.108,000 --> 0:02:33,000
You read novels that might become movies,

48
0:02:33.188,000 --> 0:02:35,000
you read comic books that might become movies,

49
0:02:35.387,000 --> 0:02:37,000
you read articles that might become movies,

50
0:02:37.458,000 --> 0:02:39,000
you read scripts that might become movies.

51
0:02:39.522,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And you read scripts from writers that might write the adaptations

52
0:02:42.68,000 --> 0:02:44,000
of the novels, of the comic books, of the articles,

53
0:02:45.284,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and might rewrite the scripts that you're already working on.

54
0:02:48.186,000 --> 0:02:5,000
All this in the hope of finding the next big thing

55
0:02:50.611,000 --> 0:02:52,000
or the next big writer who can deliver something

56
0:02:52.884,000 --> 0:02:55,000
that can make you and your company the next big thing.

57
0:02:56.561,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So in 2005, I was a development executive at Leonardo's production company.

58
0:03:01.963,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I got a phone call from the representative of a screenwriter

59
0:03:05.161,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that began pretty much the way all of those conversations did:

60
0:03:09.272,000 --> 0:03:1,000
"I've got Leo's next movie."

61
0:03:11.761,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Now in this movie, that his client had written,

62
0:03:14.569,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Leo would play an oil industry lobbyist

63
0:03:17.149,000 --> 0:03:19,000
whose girlfriend, a local meteorologist, threatens to leave him

64
0:03:20.146,000 --> 0:03:22,000
because his work contributes to global warming.

65
0:03:22.784,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And this is a situation that's been brought to a head

66
0:03:25.315,000 --> 0:03:27,000
by the fact that there's a hurricane forming in the Atlantic

67
0:03:28.22,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that's threatening to do Maria-like damage from Maine to Myrtle Beach.

68
0:03:31.609,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Leo, very sad about this impending break up,

69
0:03:33.688,000 --> 0:03:35,000
does a little more research about the hurricane

70
0:03:35.911,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and discovers that in its path across the Atlantic,

71
0:03:38.379,000 --> 0:03:41,000
it will pass over a long-dormant, though now active volcano

72
0:03:41.659,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that will spew toxic ash into its eye

73
0:03:43.866,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that will presumably be whipped into some sort of chemical weapon

74
0:03:46.955,000 --> 0:03:47,000
that will destroy the world.

75
0:03:48.319,000 --> 0:03:49,000
(Laughter)

76
0:03:49.519,000 --> 0:03:53,000
It was at that point that I asked him,

77
0:03:53.694,000 --> 0:03:56,000
"So are you basically pitching me 'Leo versus the toxic superstorm

78
0:03:56.871,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that will destroy humanity?'"

79
0:03:58.877,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And he responded by saying,

80
0:04:00.67,000 --> 0:04:02,000
"Well, when you say it like that, it sounds ridiculous."

81
0:04:03.91,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And I'm embarrassed to admit that I had the guy send me the script,

82
0:04:07.096,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and I read 30 pages before I was sure that it was as bad as I thought it was.

83
0:04:10.982,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Now, "Superstorm" is certainly an extreme example,

84
0:04:13.982,000 --> 0:04:15,000
but it's also not an unusual one.

85
0:04:16.149,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And unfortunately, most scripts aren't as easy to dismiss as that one.

86
0:04:19.742,000 --> 0:04:22,000
For example, a comedy about a high school senior,

87
0:04:23.211,000 --> 0:04:25,000
who, when faced with an unplanned pregnancy,

88
0:04:25.373,000 --> 0:04:28,000
makes an unusual decision regarding her unborn child.

89
0:04:28.527,000 --> 0:04:29,000
That's obviously "Juno."

90
0:04:30.077,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Two hundred and thirty million at the worldwide box office,

91
0:04:32.884,000 --> 0:04:34,000
four Oscar nominations, one win.

92
0:04:35.402,000 --> 0:04:37,000
How about a Mumbai teen who grew up in the slums

93
0:04:37.823,000 --> 0:04:39,000
wants to become a contestant on the Indian version

94
0:04:40.181,000 --> 0:04:41,000
of "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"?

95
0:04:42.038,000 --> 0:04:44,000
That's an easy one -- "Slumdog Millionaire."

96
0:04:44.546,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Three hundred seventy-seven million worldwide,

97
0:04:46.72,000 --> 0:04:48,000
10 Oscar nominations and eight wins.

98
0:04:49.323,000 --> 0:04:5,000
A chimpanzee tells his story

99
0:04:51.031,000 --> 0:04:53,000
of living with the legendary pop star Michael Jackson.

100
0:04:54.585,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Anyone?

101
0:04:55.759,000 --> 0:04:56,000
(Laughter)

102
0:04:56.786,000 --> 0:04:57,000
It's a trick question.

103
0:04:57.982,000 --> 0:04:58,000
But it is a script called "Bubbles,"

104
0:04:59.841,000 --> 0:05:01,000
that is going to be directed by Taika Waititi,

105
0:05:02.038,000 --> 0:05:03,000
the director of "Thor: Ragnarok."

106
0:05:04.483,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So, a large part of your job as a development executive

107
0:05:07.094,000 --> 0:05:1,000
is to separate the "Superstorms" from the "Slumdog Millionaires,"

108
0:05:10.315,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and slightly more generally, the writers who write "Superstorm"

109
0:05:13.615,000 --> 0:05:15,000
from the writers who can write "Slumdog Millionaire."

110
0:05:16.886,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And the easiest way to do this, obviously, is to read all of the scripts,

111
0:05:20.356,000 --> 0:05:22,000
but that's, frankly, impossible.

112
0:05:22.8,000 --> 0:05:24,000
A good rule of thumb is that the Writers Guild of America

113
0:05:25.546,000 --> 0:05:27,000
registers about 50,000 new pieces of material every year,

114
0:05:28.371,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and most of them are screenplays.

115
0:05:30.442,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Of those, a reasonable estimate is about 5,000 of them

116
0:05:33.561,000 --> 0:05:36,000
make it through various filters, agencies, management companies,

117
0:05:36.717,000 --> 0:05:37,000
screenplay compositions and the like,

118
0:05:38.665,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and are read by someone at the production company

119
0:05:40.983,000 --> 0:05:41,000
or major studio level.

120
0:05:42.657,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And they're trying to decide whether they can become

121
0:05:45.149,000 --> 0:05:48,000
one of the 300-and-dropping movies that are released by the major studios

122
0:05:48.696,000 --> 0:05:49,000
or their sub-brands each year.

123
0:05:50.411,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I've described it before

124
0:05:51.607,000 --> 0:05:54,000
as being a little bit like walking into a members-only bookstore

125
0:05:55.134,000 --> 0:05:57,000
where the entire inventory is just organized haphazardly,

126
0:05:58.118,000 --> 0:06:,000
and every book has the same, nondescript cover.

127
0:06:00.8,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Your job is to enter that bookstore

128
0:06:03.435,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and not come back until you've found the best and most profitable books there.

129
0:06:07.379,000 --> 0:06:09,000
It's anarchic and gleefully opaque.

130
0:06:10.982,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And everyone has their method to address these problems.

131
0:06:13.919,000 --> 0:06:14,000
You know, most rely on the major agencies

132
0:06:15.903,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and they just assume that if there's great talent in the world,

133
0:06:18.927,000 --> 0:06:2,000
they've already found their way to the agencies,

134
0:06:21.196,000 --> 0:06:23,000
regardless of the structural barriers that actually exist

135
0:06:23.903,000 --> 0:06:25,000
to get into the agencies in the first place.

136
0:06:26.015,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Others also constantly compare notes among themselves

137
0:06:28.569,000 --> 0:06:29,000
about what they've read and what's good,

138
0:06:30.583,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and they just hope that their cohort group is the best, most wired

139
0:06:33.754,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and has the best taste in town.

140
0:06:36.006,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And others try to read everything, but that's, again, impossible.

141
0:06:39.553,000 --> 0:06:41,000
If you're reading 500 screenplays in a year,

142
0:06:41.691,000 --> 0:06:42,000
you are reading a lot.

143
0:06:43.442,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And it's still only a small percentage of what's out there.

144
0:06:46.601,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Fundamentally, it's triage.

145
0:06:49.046,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And when you're in triage, you tend to default to conventional wisdom

146
0:06:52.355,000 --> 0:06:54,000
about what works and what doesn't.

147
0:06:55.427,000 --> 0:06:58,000
That a comedy about a young woman dealing with reproductive reality

148
0:06:59.347,000 --> 0:07:,000
can't sell.

149
0:07:00.895,000 --> 0:07:03,000
That the story of an Indian teenager isn't viable in the domestic marketplace

150
0:07:04.626,000 --> 0:07:06,000
or anywhere else in the world outside of India.

151
0:07:06.903,000 --> 0:07:09,000
That the only source of viable movies is a very narrow groups of writers

152
0:07:10.823,000 --> 0:07:13,000
who have already found their way to living and working in Hollywood,

153
0:07:14.052,000 --> 0:07:16,000
who already have the best representation in the business,

154
0:07:16.767,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and are writing a very narrow band of stories.

155
0:07:19.63,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And I'm somewhat embarrassed to admit, that that's where I found myself in 2005.

156
0:07:24.634,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Sitting in that office above Sunset Boulevard,

157
0:07:26.888,000 --> 0:07:29,000
staring down that metaphorical anonymized bookstore,

158
0:07:29.92,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and having read nothing but bad scripts for months.

159
0:07:34.095,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And I took this to mean one of two things:

160
0:07:36.143,000 --> 0:07:38,000
either A: I was not very good at my job,

161
0:07:38.571,000 --> 0:07:4,000
which was, ostensibly, finding good scripts,

162
0:07:41.238,000 --> 0:07:44,000
or B: reading bad scripts was the job.

163
0:07:45.203,000 --> 0:07:47,000
In which case, my mother's weekly phone calls,

164
0:07:47.401,000 --> 0:07:5,000
asking me if my law school entrance exam scores were still valid

165
0:07:50.475,000 --> 0:07:52,000
was something I should probably pay more attention to.

166
0:07:53.044,000 --> 0:07:54,000
What I also knew

167
0:07:54.249,000 --> 0:07:56,000
was that I was about to go on vacation for two weeks,

168
0:07:56.759,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and as bad as reading bad scripts is when it is your job,

169
0:07:59.524,000 --> 0:08:,000
it's even more painful on vacation.

170
0:08:01.27,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So I had to do something.

171
0:08:03.046,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So late one night at my office, I made a list

172
0:08:05.261,000 --> 0:08:08,000
of everyone that I had had breakfast, lunch, dinner or drinks with

173
0:08:08.517,000 --> 0:08:11,000
that had jobs similar to mine, and I sent them an anonymous email.

174
0:08:11.907,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And I made a very simple request.

175
0:08:14.479,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Send me a list of up to 10 of your favorite screenplays

176
0:08:17.157,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that meet three criteria.

177
0:08:18.53,000 --> 0:08:2,000
One: you love the screenplay,

178
0:08:20.609,000 --> 0:08:23,000
two: the filmed version of that screenplay will not be in theaters

179
0:08:23.768,000 --> 0:08:24,000
by the end of that calendar year,

180
0:08:25.427,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and three: you found out about the screenplay this year.

181
0:08:29.604,000 --> 0:08:32,000
This was not an appeal for the scripts that would be the next great blockbuster,

182
0:08:33.39,000 --> 0:08:35,000
not an appeal for the scripts that will win the Academy Award,

183
0:08:36.347,000 --> 0:08:38,000
they didn't need to be scripts that their bosses loved

184
0:08:38.884,000 --> 0:08:39,000
or that their studio wanted to make.

185
0:08:40.625,000 --> 0:08:43,000
It was very simply an opportunity for people to speak their minds

186
0:08:43.711,000 --> 0:08:44,000
about what they loved,

187
0:08:45.179,000 --> 0:08:47,000
which, in this world, is increasingly rare.

188
0:08:48.196,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Now, almost all of the 75 people I emailed anonymously responded.

189
0:08:52.056,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And then two dozen other people actually emailed to participate

190
0:08:55.173,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to this anonymous email address,

191
0:08:56.759,000 --> 0:08:59,000
but I confirmed that they did in fact have the jobs they claimed to have.

192
0:09:00.331,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And I then compiled the votes into a spreadsheet,

193
0:09:02.68,000 --> 0:09:04,000
ran a pivot table, output it to PowerPoint,

194
0:09:04.728,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and the night before I left for vacation,

195
0:09:06.712,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I slapped a quasi subversive name on it

196
0:09:08.641,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and emailed it back from that anonymous email address

197
0:09:11.157,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to everyone who voted.

198
0:09:12.498,000 --> 0:09:13,000
The Black List.

199
0:09:13.752,000 --> 0:09:16,000
A tribute to those who lost their careers during the anti-communist hysteria

200
0:09:17.395,000 --> 0:09:18,000
of the 1940s and 50s,

201
0:09:18.95,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and a conscious inversion of the notion

202
0:09:20.863,000 --> 0:09:23,000
that black somehow had a negative connotation.

203
0:09:24.546,000 --> 0:09:26,000
After arriving in Mexico, I pulled out a chair by the pool,

204
0:09:27.356,000 --> 0:09:29,000
started reading these scripts and found, to my shock and joy,

205
0:09:30.292,000 --> 0:09:32,000
that most of them were actually quite good.

206
0:09:32.332,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Mission accomplished.

207
0:09:34.048,000 --> 0:09:36,000
What I didn't and couldn't have expected

208
0:09:36.373,000 --> 0:09:37,000
was what happened next.

209
0:09:38.834,000 --> 0:09:4,000
About a week into my time on vacation,

210
0:09:40.938,000 --> 0:09:42,000
I stopped by the hotel's business center to check my email.

211
0:09:43.768,000 --> 0:09:45,000
This was a pre-iPhone world, after all.

212
0:09:46.458,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And found that this list that I had created anonymously

213
0:09:49.665,000 --> 0:09:51,000
had been forwarded back to me several dozen times,

214
0:09:52.141,000 --> 0:09:53,000
at my personal email address.

215
0:09:53.666,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Everyone was sharing this list of scripts that everyone had said that they loved,

216
0:09:57.539,000 --> 0:09:59,000
reading them and then loving them themselves.

217
0:10:00.11,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And my first reaction, that I can't actually say here,

218
0:10:03.498,000 --> 0:10:05,000
but will describe it as fear,

219
0:10:05.903,000 --> 0:10:07,000
the idea of surveying people about their scripts

220
0:10:08.181,000 --> 0:10:1,000
was certainly not a novel or a genius one.

221
0:10:10.639,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Surely, there was some unwritten Hollywood rule of omertà

222
0:10:14.006,000 --> 0:10:16,000
that had guided people away from doing that before

223
0:10:16.442,000 --> 0:10:19,000
that I was simply too naive to understand, it being so early in my career.

224
0:10:20.939,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I was sure I was going to get fired,

225
0:10:22.717,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and so I decided that day that A: I would never tell anybody

226
0:10:25.931,000 --> 0:10:26,000
that I had done this,

227
0:10:27.251,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and B: I would never do it again.

228
0:10:30.919,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Then, six months later, something even more bizarre happened.

229
0:10:34.133,000 --> 0:10:36,000
I was in my office, on Sunset,

230
0:10:36.458,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and got a phone call from another writer's agent.

231
0:10:39.266,000 --> 0:10:42,000
The call began very similarly to the call about "Superstorm":

232
0:10:42.823,000 --> 0:10:44,000
"I've got Leo's next movie."

233
0:10:44.879,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Now, that's not the interesting part.

234
0:10:46.919,000 --> 0:10:48,000
The interesting part was the way the call ended.

235
0:10:49.363,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Because this agent then told me, and I quote,

236
0:10:54.188,000 --> 0:10:56,000
"Don't tell anybody, but I have it on really good authority

237
0:10:57.069,000 --> 0:11:,000
this is going to be the number one script on next year's Black List."

238
0:11:00.673,000 --> 0:11:02,000
(Laughter)

239
0:11:03.077,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Yeah.

240
0:11:04.807,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Suffice it to say, I was dumbfounded.

241
0:11:07.284,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Here was an agent, using the Black List, this thing that I had made anonymously

242
0:11:11.075,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and decided to never make again,

243
0:11:12.949,000 --> 0:11:13,000
to sell his client to me.

244
0:11:14.933,000 --> 0:11:15,000
To suggest that the script had merit,

245
0:11:16.806,000 --> 0:11:19,000
based solely on the possibility of being included on a list of beloved screenplays.

246
0:11:21.541,000 --> 0:11:24,000
After the call ended, I sat in my office, sort of staring out the window,

247
0:11:25.07,000 --> 0:11:27,000
alternating between shock and general giddiness.

248
0:11:28.01,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And then I realized that this thing that I had created

249
0:11:30.617,000 --> 0:11:31,000
had a lot more value

250
0:11:31.815,000 --> 0:11:34,000
than just me finding good screenplays to read over the holidays.

251
0:11:34.864,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And so I did it again the next year --

252
0:11:37.093,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and the "LA Times" had outed me as the person who had created it --

253
0:11:40.292,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and the year after that,

254
0:11:41.585,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and the year after that -- I've done it every year since 2005.

255
0:11:45.076,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And the results have been fascinating,

256
0:11:46.998,000 --> 0:11:49,000
because, unapologetic lying aside, this agent was exactly right.

257
0:11:51.411,000 --> 0:11:54,000
This list was evidence, to many people, of a script's value,

258
0:11:54.761,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and that a great script had greater value

259
0:11:56.809,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that, I think, a lot of people had previously anticipated.

260
0:11:59.658,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Very quickly, the writers whose scripts were on that list

261
0:12:02.373,000 --> 0:12:03,000
started getting jobs,

262
0:12:03.934,000 --> 0:12:05,000
those scripts started getting made,

263
0:12:05.991,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and the scripts that got made

264
0:12:07.43,000 --> 0:12:09,000
were often the ones that violated the assumptions

265
0:12:09.821,000 --> 0:12:1,000
about what worked and what didn't.

266
0:12:11.744,000 --> 0:12:14,000
They were scripts like "Juno" and "Little Miss Sunshine"

267
0:12:15.093,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and "The Queen" and "The King's Speech"

268
0:12:17.665,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and "Spotlight."

269
0:12:19.212,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And yes, "Slumdog Millionaire."

270
0:12:21.061,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And even an upcoming movie about Michael Jackson's chimpanzee.

271
0:12:25.522,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Now, I think it's really important that I pause here for a second

272
0:12:28.649,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and say that I can't take credit for the success of any of those movies.

273
0:12:32.118,000 --> 0:12:36,000
I didn't write them, I didn't direct them, I didn't produce them, I didn't gaff them,

274
0:12:36.142,000 --> 0:12:38,000
I didn't make food and craft service --

275
0:12:38.45,000 --> 0:12:39,000
we all know how important that is.

276
0:12:40.276,000 --> 0:12:42,000
The credit for those movies, the credit for that success,

277
0:12:42.991,000 --> 0:12:44,000
goes to the people who made the films.

278
0:12:45.204,000 --> 0:12:47,000
What I did was change the way people looked at them.

279
0:12:47.887,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Accidentally, I asked if the conventional wisdom was correct.

280
0:12:52.657,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And certainly, there are movies on that list that would have gotten made

281
0:12:56.069,000 --> 0:12:57,000
without the Black List,

282
0:12:57.261,000 --> 0:12:59,000
but there are many that definitely would not have.

283
0:12:59.673,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And at a minimum, we've catalyzed a lot of them into production,

284
0:13:02.73,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and I think that's worth noting.

285
0:13:04.363,000 --> 0:13:06,000
There have been about 1,000 screenplays on the Black List

286
0:13:07.06,000 --> 0:13:08,000
since its inception in 2005.

287
0:13:08.95,000 --> 0:13:1,000
About 325 have been produced.

288
0:13:11.95,000 --> 0:13:14,000
They've been nominated for 300 Academy Awards,

289
0:13:14.982,000 --> 0:13:15,000
they've won 50.

290
0:13:16.934,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Four of the last nine Best Pictures have gone to scripts from the Black List,

291
0:13:20.712,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and 10 of the last 20 screenplay Oscars have gone to scripts from the Black List.

292
0:13:24.839,000 --> 0:13:26,000
All told, they've made about 25 billion dollars

293
0:13:27.165,000 --> 0:13:28,000
in worldwide box office,

294
0:13:28.774,000 --> 0:13:3,000
which means that hundreds of millions of people

295
0:13:31.497,000 --> 0:13:33,000
have seen these films when they leave their homes,

296
0:13:33.949,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and sit next to someone they don't know and the lights go down.

297
0:13:37.871,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And that's to say nothing of post-theatrical environments

298
0:13:40.667,000 --> 0:13:42,000
like DVD, streaming and, let's be honest, illegal downloads.

299
0:13:44.482,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Five years ago today, October 15,

300
0:13:48.442,000 --> 0:13:5,000
my business partner and I doubled down on this notion

301
0:13:51.085,000 --> 0:13:55,000
that screenwriting talent was not where we expected to find it,

302
0:13:55.506,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and we launched a website that would allow anybody on earth

303
0:13:58.561,000 --> 0:14:,000
who had written an English-language screenplay

304
0:14:00.767,000 --> 0:14:02,000
to upload their script, have it evaluated,

305
0:14:02.807,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and make it available to thousands of film-industry professionals.

306
0:14:06.132,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And I'm pleased to say, in the five years since its launch,

307
0:14:08.934,000 --> 0:14:09,000
we've largely proved that thesis.

308
0:14:10.553,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Hundreds of writers from across the world have found representation,

309
0:14:13.823,000 --> 0:14:14,000
have had their work optioned or sold.

310
0:14:15.657,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Seven have even seen their films made in the last three years,

311
0:14:18.609,000 --> 0:14:19,000
including the film "Nightingale,"

312
0:14:20.276,000 --> 0:14:22,000
the story of a war veteran's psychological decline,

313
0:14:22.712,000 --> 0:14:24,000
in which David Oyelowo's face is the only one on screen

314
0:14:25.403,000 --> 0:14:26,000
for the film's 90-minute duration.

315
0:14:27.125,000 --> 0:14:3,000
It was nominated for a Golden Globe and two Emmy Awards.

316
0:14:30.431,000 --> 0:14:32,000
It's also kind of cool that more than a dozen writers

317
0:14:32.947,000 --> 0:14:33,000
who were discovered on the website

318
0:14:34.685,000 --> 0:14:36,000
have ended up on this end-of-year annual list,

319
0:14:36.891,000 --> 0:14:38,000
including two of the last three number one writers.

320
0:14:39.351,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Simply put, the conventional wisdom about screenwriting merit --

321
0:14:43.397,000 --> 0:14:46,000
where it was and where it could be found,

322
0:14:46.984,000 --> 0:14:47,000
was wrong.

323
0:14:48.373,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And this is notable, because as I mentioned before,

324
0:14:51.302,000 --> 0:14:54,000
in the triage of finding movies to make and making them,

325
0:14:54.601,000 --> 0:14:56,000
there's a lot of relying on conventional wisdom.

326
0:14:58.22,000 --> 0:14:59,000
And that conventional wisdom,

327
0:15:00.165,000 --> 0:15:02,000
maybe, just maybe,

328
0:15:02.371,000 --> 0:15:04,000
might be wrong to even greater consequence.

329
0:15:05.688,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Films about black people don't sell overseas.

330
0:15:09.117,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Female-driven action movies don't work,

331
0:15:11.038,000 --> 0:15:14,000
because women will see themselves in men, but men won't see themselves in women.

332
0:15:16.188,000 --> 0:15:19,000
That no one wants to see movies about women over 40.

333
0:15:19.379,000 --> 0:15:23,000
That our onscreen heroes have to conform to a very narrow idea about beauty

334
0:15:23.498,000 --> 0:15:24,000
that we consider conventional.

335
0:15:26.291,000 --> 0:15:29,000
What does that mean when those images are projected 30 feet high

336
0:15:29.331,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and the lights go down,

337
0:15:30.602,000 --> 0:15:32,000
for a kid that looks like me in Columbus, Georgia?

338
0:15:33.331,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Or a Muslim girl in Cardiff, Wales?

339
0:15:36.117,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Or a gay kid in Chennai?

340
0:15:38.482,000 --> 0:15:4,000
What does it mean for how we see ourselves

341
0:15:41.205,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and how we see the world and for how the world sees us?

342
0:15:47.308,000 --> 0:15:49,000
We live in very strange times.

343
0:15:50.413,000 --> 0:15:53,000
And I think for the most part, we all live in a state of constant triage.

344
0:15:54.224,000 --> 0:15:56,000
There's just too much information,

345
0:15:56.598,000 --> 0:15:58,000
too much stuff to contend with.

346
0:15:58.996,000 --> 0:16:01,000
And so as a rule, we tend to default to conventional wisdom.

347
0:16:03.292,000 --> 0:16:06,000
And I think it's important that we ask ourselves, constantly,

348
0:16:06.835,000 --> 0:16:1,000
how much of that conventional wisdom is all convention and no wisdom?

349
0:16:12.441,000 --> 0:16:13,000
And at what cost?

350
0:16:14.079,000 --> 0:16:15,000
Thank you.

351
0:16:15.255,000 --> 0:16:18,000

1
0:00:25.408,000 --> 0:00:28,000
As someone who has spent his entire career trying to be invisible

2
0:00:29.7,000 --> 0:00:32,000
standing in front of an audience is a cross between

3
0:00:32.7,000 --> 0:00:35,000
an out-of-body experience and a deer caught in the headlights,

4
0:00:35.7,000 --> 0:00:4,000
so please forgive me for violating one of the TED commandments

5
0:00:40.7,000 --> 0:00:42,000
by relying on words on paper,

6
0:00:42.7,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and I only hope I'm not struck by lightning bolts before I'm done.

7
0:00:46.7,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I'd like to begin by talking about some of the ideas that motivated me

8
0:00:51.7,000 --> 0:00:53,000
to become a documentary photographer.

9
0:00:54.7,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I was a student in the '60s, a time of social upheaval and questioning,

10
0:00:59.7,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and on a personal level, an awakening sense of idealism.

11
0:01:03.7,000 --> 0:01:06,000
The war in Vietnam was raging;

12
0:01:06.7,000 --> 0:01:08,000
the Civil Rights Movement was under way;

13
0:01:08.7,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and pictures had a powerful influence on me.

14
0:01:11.7,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Our political and military leaders were telling us one thing,

15
0:01:14.7,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and photographers were telling us another.

16
0:01:17.7,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I believed the photographers, and so did millions of other Americans.

17
0:01:22.7,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Their images fueled resistance to the war and to racism.

18
0:01:26.7,000 --> 0:01:31,000
They not only recorded history; they helped change the course of history.

19
0:01:31.7,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Their pictures became part of our collective consciousness

20
0:01:34.7,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and, as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience,

21
0:01:38.7,000 --> 0:01:42,000
change became not only possible, but inevitable.

22
0:01:42.7,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I saw that the free flow of information represented by journalism,

23
0:01:46.7,000 --> 0:01:5,000
specifically visual journalism, can bring into focus

24
0:01:50.7,000 --> 0:01:54,000
both the benefits and the cost of political policies.

25
0:01:54.7,000 --> 0:01:59,000
It can give credit to sound decision-making, adding momentum to success.

26
0:01:59.7,000 --> 0:02:04,000
In the face of poor political judgment or political inaction,

27
0:02:04.7,000 --> 0:02:08,000
it becomes a kind of intervention, assessing the damage

28
0:02:08.7,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and asking us to reassess our behavior.

29
0:02:11.7,000 --> 0:02:13,000
It puts a human face on issues

30
0:02:13.7,000 --> 0:02:16,000
which from afar can appear abstract

31
0:02:16.7,000 --> 0:02:19,000
or ideological or monumental in their global impact.

32
0:02:19.7,000 --> 0:02:24,000
What happens at ground level, far from the halls of power,

33
0:02:24.7,000 --> 0:02:27,000
happens to ordinary citizens one by one.

34
0:02:27.7,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And I understood that documentary photography

35
0:02:30.7,000 --> 0:02:34,000
has the ability to interpret events from their point of view.

36
0:02:34.7,000 --> 0:02:38,000
It gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice.

37
0:02:38.7,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And as a reaction, it stimulates public opinion

38
0:02:42.7,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and gives impetus to public debate,

39
0:02:44.7,000 --> 0:02:46,000
thereby preventing the interested parties

40
0:02:46.7,000 --> 0:02:5,000
from totally controlling the agenda, much as they would like to.

41
0:02:50.7,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Coming of age in those days made real

42
0:02:53.7,000 --> 0:02:56,000
the concept that the free flow of information is absolutely vital

43
0:02:56.7,000 --> 0:03:,000
for a free and dynamic society to function properly.

44
0:03:00.7,000 --> 0:03:04,000
The press is certainly a business, and in order to survive

45
0:03:04.7,000 --> 0:03:07,000
it must be a successful business,

46
0:03:07.7,000 --> 0:03:09,000
but the right balance must be found

47
0:03:09.7,000 --> 0:03:13,000
between marketing considerations and journalistic responsibility.

48
0:03:13.7,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Society's problems can't be solved until they're identified.

49
0:03:18.7,000 --> 0:03:22,000
On a higher plane, the press is a service industry,

50
0:03:22.7,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and the service it provides is awareness.

51
0:03:25.7,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Every story does not have to sell something.

52
0:03:28.7,000 --> 0:03:31,000
There's also a time to give.

53
0:03:32.7,000 --> 0:03:35,000
That was a tradition I wanted to follow.

54
0:03:35.7,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Seeing the war created such incredibly high stakes for everyone involved

55
0:03:39.7,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and that visual journalism could actually become a factor in conflict resolution --

56
0:03:44.7,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I wanted to be a photographer in order to be a war photographer.

57
0:03:48.7,000 --> 0:03:51,000
But I was driven by an inherent sense

58
0:03:51.7,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that a picture that revealed the true face of war

59
0:03:54.7,000 --> 0:03:58,000
would almost by definition be an anti-war photograph.

60
0:03:59.7,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I'd like to take you on a visual journey through some of the events

61
0:04:02.7,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and issues I've been involved in over the past 25 years.

62
0:04:07.7,000 --> 0:04:1,000
In 1981, I went to Northern Ireland.

63
0:04:10.7,000 --> 0:04:14,000
10 IRA prisoners were in the process of starving themselves to death

64
0:04:14.7,000 --> 0:04:17,000
in protest against conditions in jail.

65
0:04:17.7,000 --> 0:04:2,000
The reaction on the streets was violent confrontation.

66
0:04:20.7,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I saw that the front lines of contemporary wars

67
0:04:24.7,000 --> 0:04:28,000
are not on isolated battlefields, but right where people live.

68
0:04:29.7,000 --> 0:04:33,000
During the early '80s, I spent a lot of time in Central America,

69
0:04:33.7,000 --> 0:04:35,000
which was engulfed by civil wars

70
0:04:35.7,000 --> 0:04:38,000
that straddled the ideological divide of the Cold War.

71
0:04:38.7,000 --> 0:04:41,000
In Guatemala, the central government --

72
0:04:41.7,000 --> 0:04:44,000
controlled by a oligarchy of European decent --

73
0:04:44.7,000 --> 0:04:48,000
was waging a scorched Earth campaign against an indigenous rebellion,

74
0:04:48.7,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and I saw an image that reflected the history of Latin America:

75
0:04:51.7,000 --> 0:04:55,000
conquest through a combination of the Bible and the sword.

76
0:04:55.7,000 --> 0:04:59,000
An anti-Sandinista guerrilla was mortally wounded

77
0:04:59.7,000 --> 0:05:03,000
as Commander Zero attacked a town in Southern Nicaragua.

78
0:05:05.7,000 --> 0:05:08,000
A destroyed tank belonging to Somoza's national guard

79
0:05:08.7,000 --> 0:05:12,000
was left as a monument in a park in Managua,

80
0:05:12.7,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and was transformed by the energy and spirit of a child.

81
0:05:16.7,000 --> 0:05:2,000
At the same time, a civil war was taking place in El Salvador,

82
0:05:20.7,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and again, the civilian population was caught up in the conflict.

83
0:05:25.7,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I've been covering the Palestinian-Israeli conflict since 1981.

84
0:05:30.7,000 --> 0:05:34,000
This is a moment from the beginning of the second intifada, in 2000,

85
0:05:34.7,000 --> 0:05:37,000
when it was still stones and Molotovs against an army.

86
0:05:40.7,000 --> 0:05:43,000
In 2001, the uprising escalated into an armed conflict,

87
0:05:43.7,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and one of the major incidents was

88
0:05:45.7,000 --> 0:05:48,000
the destruction of the Palestinian refugee camp

89
0:05:48.7,000 --> 0:05:51,000
in the West Bank town of Jenin.

90
0:05:52.7,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Without the political will to find common ground,

91
0:05:56.7,000 --> 0:05:59,000
the continual friction of tactic and counter-tactic

92
0:05:59.7,000 --> 0:06:02,000
only creates suspicion and hatred and vengeance,

93
0:06:02.7,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and perpetuates the cycle of violence.

94
0:06:07.7,000 --> 0:06:1,000
In the '90s, after the breakup of the Soviet Union,

95
0:06:10.7,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Yugoslavia fractured along ethnic fault lines, and civil war broke out

96
0:06:15.7,000 --> 0:06:17,000
between Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia.

97
0:06:17.7,000 --> 0:06:21,000
This is a scene of house-to-house fighting in Mostar,

98
0:06:21.7,000 --> 0:06:23,000
neighbor against neighbor.

99
0:06:23.7,000 --> 0:06:26,000
A bedroom, the place where people share intimacy,

100
0:06:26.7,000 --> 0:06:3,000
where life itself is conceived, became a battlefield.

101
0:06:31.7,000 --> 0:06:37,000
A mosque in northern Bosnia was destroyed by Serbian artillery

102
0:06:37.7,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and was used as a makeshift morgue.

103
0:06:46.7,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Dead Serbian soldiers were collected after a battle

104
0:06:49.7,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and used as barter for the return of prisoners

105
0:06:52.7,000 --> 0:06:54,000
or Bosnian soldiers killed in action.

106
0:06:56.7,000 --> 0:06:58,000
This was once a park.

107
0:06:58.7,000 --> 0:07:,000
The Bosnian soldier who guided me

108
0:07:00.7,000 --> 0:07:03,000
told me that all of his friends were there now.

109
0:07:04.7,000 --> 0:07:06,000
At the same time in South Africa,

110
0:07:06.7,000 --> 0:07:09,000
after Nelson Mandela had been released from prison,

111
0:07:09.7,000 --> 0:07:12,000
the black population commenced the final phase

112
0:07:12.7,000 --> 0:07:14,000
of liberation from apartheid.

113
0:07:15.7,000 --> 0:07:18,000
One of the things I had to learn as a journalist

114
0:07:18.7,000 --> 0:07:2,000
was what to do with my anger.

115
0:07:20.7,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I had to use it, channel its energy, turn it into something

116
0:07:25.7,000 --> 0:07:28,000
that would clarify my vision, instead of clouding it.

117
0:07:29.7,000 --> 0:07:34,000
In Transkei, I witnessed a rite of passage into manhood, of the Xhosa tribe.

118
0:07:34.7,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Teenage boys lived in isolation, their bodies covered with white clay.

119
0:07:39.7,000 --> 0:07:41,000
After several weeks, they washed off the white

120
0:07:41.7,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and took on the full responsibilities of men.

121
0:07:44.7,000 --> 0:07:47,000
It was a very old ritual that seemed symbolic

122
0:07:48.315,000 --> 0:07:52,000
of the political struggle that was changing the face of South Africa.

123
0:07:54.7,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Children in Soweto playing on a trampoline.

124
0:08:01.7,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Elsewhere in Africa there was famine.

125
0:08:04.7,000 --> 0:08:08,000
In Somalia, the central government collapsed and clan warfare broke out.

126
0:08:09.7,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Farmers were driven off their land,

127
0:08:11.7,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and crops and livestock were destroyed or stolen.

128
0:08:15.7,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Starvation was being used as a weapon of mass destruction --

129
0:08:19.7,000 --> 0:08:21,000
primitive but extremely effective.

130
0:08:21.7,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Hundreds of thousands of people were exterminated,

131
0:08:24.7,000 --> 0:08:26,000
slowly and painfully.

132
0:08:28.7,000 --> 0:08:32,000
The international community responded with massive humanitarian relief,

133
0:08:32.7,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and hundreds of thousands of more lives were saved.

134
0:08:36.7,000 --> 0:08:39,000
American troops were sent to protect the relief shipments,

135
0:08:39.7,000 --> 0:08:42,000
but they were eventually drawn into the conflict,

136
0:08:42.7,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and after the tragic battle in Mogadishu, they were withdrawn.

137
0:08:46.7,000 --> 0:08:5,000
In southern Sudan, another civil war saw similar use of starvation

138
0:08:50.7,000 --> 0:08:52,000
as a means of genocide.

139
0:08:53.7,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Again, international NGOs, united under the umbrella of the U.N.,

140
0:08:57.7,000 --> 0:09:02,000
staged a massive relief operation and thousands of lives were saved.

141
0:09:03.7,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I'm a witness, and I want my testimony to be honest and uncensored.

142
0:09:10.7,000 --> 0:09:13,000
I also want it to be powerful and eloquent,

143
0:09:13.7,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and to do as much justice as possible

144
0:09:15.7,000 --> 0:09:18,000
to the experience of the people I'm photographing.

145
0:09:18.7,000 --> 0:09:21,000
This man was in an NGO feeding center,

146
0:09:21.7,000 --> 0:09:23,000
being helped as much as he could be helped.

147
0:09:23.7,000 --> 0:09:28,000
He literally had nothing. He was a virtual skeleton,

148
0:09:28.7,000 --> 0:09:32,000
yet he could still summon the courage and the will to move.

149
0:09:32.7,000 --> 0:09:35,000
He had not given up, and if he didn't give up,

150
0:09:35.7,000 --> 0:09:4,000
how could anyone in the outside world ever dream of losing hope?

151
0:09:41.7,000 --> 0:09:46,000
In 1994, after three months of covering the South African election,

152
0:09:46.7,000 --> 0:09:49,000
I saw the inauguration of Nelson Mandela,

153
0:09:49.7,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and it was the most uplifting thing I've ever seen.

154
0:09:52.7,000 --> 0:09:56,000
It exemplified the best that humanity has to offer.

155
0:09:56.7,000 --> 0:09:59,000
The next day I left for Rwanda,

156
0:09:59.7,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and it was like taking the express elevator to hell.

157
0:10:02.7,000 --> 0:10:06,000
This man had just been liberated from a Hutu death camp.

158
0:10:06.7,000 --> 0:10:1,000
He allowed me to photograph him for quite a long time,

159
0:10:10.7,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and he even turned his face toward the light,

160
0:10:13.7,000 --> 0:10:15,000
as if he wanted me to see him better.

161
0:10:16.7,000 --> 0:10:2,000
I think he knew what the scars on his face would say to the rest of the world.

162
0:10:21.7,000 --> 0:10:24,000
This time, maybe confused or discouraged

163
0:10:24.7,000 --> 0:10:27,000
by the military disaster in Somalia,

164
0:10:27.7,000 --> 0:10:3,000
the international community remained silent,

165
0:10:30.7,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and somewhere around 800,000 people were slaughtered

166
0:10:33.7,000 --> 0:10:36,000
by their own countrymen -- sometimes their own neighbors --

167
0:10:36.7,000 --> 0:10:39,000
using farm implements as weapons.

168
0:10:40.7,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Perhaps because a lesson had been learned

169
0:10:43.362,000 --> 0:10:45,000
by the weak response to the war in Bosnia

170
0:10:45.7,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and the failure in Rwanda,

171
0:10:47.7,000 --> 0:10:49,000
when Serbia attacked Kosovo,

172
0:10:49.7,000 --> 0:10:52,000
international action was taken much more decisively.

173
0:10:53.392,000 --> 0:10:57,000
NATO forces went in, and the Serbian army withdrew.

174
0:10:57.7,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Ethnic Albanians had been murdered,

175
0:11:00.423,000 --> 0:11:04,000
their farms destroyed and a huge number of people forcibly deported.

176
0:11:05.7,000 --> 0:11:08,000
They were received in refugee camps

177
0:11:08.7,000 --> 0:11:11,000
set up by NGOs in Albania and Macedonia.

178
0:11:13.238,000 --> 0:11:16,000
The imprint of a man who had been burned inside his own home.

179
0:11:17.285,000 --> 0:11:19,000
The image reminded me of a cave painting,

180
0:11:20.254,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and echoed how primitive we still are in so many ways.

181
0:11:26.177,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Between 1995 and '96, I covered the first two wars

182
0:11:30.223,000 --> 0:11:32,000
in Chechnya from inside Grozny.

183
0:11:32.7,000 --> 0:11:36,000
This is a Chechen rebel on the front line against the Russian army.

184
0:11:38.7,000 --> 0:11:41,000
The Russians bombarded Grozny constantly for weeks,

185
0:11:42.346,000 --> 0:11:45,000
killing mainly the civilians who were still trapped inside.

186
0:11:46.869,000 --> 0:11:48,000
I found a boy from the local orphanage

187
0:11:49.177,000 --> 0:11:51,000
wandering around the front line.

188
0:11:53.008,000 --> 0:11:56,000
My work has evolved from being concerned mainly with war

189
0:11:56.7,000 --> 0:11:59,000
to a focus on critical social issues as well.

190
0:12:00.977,000 --> 0:12:02,000
After the fall of Ceausescu, I went to Romania

191
0:12:03.7,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and discovered a kind of gulag of children,

192
0:12:07.7,000 --> 0:12:1,000
where thousands of orphans were being kept in medieval conditions.

193
0:12:11.7,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Ceausescu had imposed a quota

194
0:12:13.7,000 --> 0:12:16,000
on the number of children to be produced by each family,

195
0:12:16.7,000 --> 0:12:2,000
thereby making women's bodies an instrument of state economic policy.

196
0:12:21.7,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Children who couldn't be supported by their families

197
0:12:24.7,000 --> 0:12:27,000
were raised in government orphanages.

198
0:12:27.7,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Children with birth defects were labeled incurables,

199
0:12:30.7,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and confined for life to inhuman conditions.

200
0:12:34.7,000 --> 0:12:38,000
As reports began to surface, again international aid went in.

201
0:12:40.7,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Going deeper into the legacy of the Eastern European regimes,

202
0:12:44.7,000 --> 0:12:48,000
I worked for several months on a story about the effects of industrial pollution,

203
0:12:48.7,000 --> 0:12:51,000
where there had been no regard for the environment

204
0:12:51.7,000 --> 0:12:55,000
or the health of either workers or the general population.

205
0:12:55.7,000 --> 0:12:58,000
An aluminum factory in Czechoslovakia

206
0:12:58.7,000 --> 0:13:01,000
was filled with carcinogenic smoke and dust,

207
0:13:01.7,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and four out of five workers came down with cancer.

208
0:13:07.1,000 --> 0:13:09,000
After the fall of Suharto in Indonesia,

209
0:13:09.362,000 --> 0:13:11,000
I began to explore conditions of poverty

210
0:13:12.131,000 --> 0:13:15,000
in a country that was on its way towards modernization.

211
0:13:15.362,000 --> 0:13:18,000
I spent a good deal of time with a man

212
0:13:18.7,000 --> 0:13:2,000
who lived with his family on a railway embankment

213
0:13:20.7,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident.

214
0:13:24.7,000 --> 0:13:29,000
When the story was published, unsolicited donations poured in.

215
0:13:29.7,000 --> 0:13:31,000
A trust fund was established,

216
0:13:31.7,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and the family now lives in a house in the countryside

217
0:13:34.7,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and all their basic necessities are taken care of.

218
0:13:37.7,000 --> 0:13:4,000
It was a story that wasn't trying to sell anything.

219
0:13:40.7,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Journalism had provided a channel

220
0:13:43.7,000 --> 0:13:47,000
for people's natural sense of generosity, and the readers responded.

221
0:13:49.7,000 --> 0:13:52,000
I met a band of homeless children who'd come to Jakarta from the countryside,

222
0:13:52.7,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and ended up living in a train station.

223
0:13:55.7,000 --> 0:14:,000
By the age of 12 or 14, they'd become beggars and drug addicts.

224
0:14:00.7,000 --> 0:14:02,000
The rural poor had become the urban poor,

225
0:14:02.7,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and in the process, they'd become invisible.

226
0:14:08.7,000 --> 0:14:1,000
These heroin addicts in detox in Pakistan

227
0:14:11.3,000 --> 0:14:13,000
reminded me of figures in a play by Beckett:

228
0:14:14.192,000 --> 0:14:17,000
isolated, waiting in the dark, but drawn to the light.

229
0:14:21.7,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Agent Orange was a defoliant used during the Vietnam War

230
0:14:24.885,000 --> 0:14:27,000
to deny cover to the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese army.

231
0:14:28.823,000 --> 0:14:32,000
The active ingredient was dioxin, an extremely toxic chemical

232
0:14:33.7,000 --> 0:14:35,000
that was sprayed in vast quantities,

233
0:14:35.7,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and whose effects passed through the genes to the next generation.

234
0:14:41.7,000 --> 0:14:43,000
In 2000, I began documenting global health issues,

235
0:14:44.362,000 --> 0:14:47,000
concentrating first on AIDS in Africa.

236
0:14:47.531,000 --> 0:14:5,000
I tried to tell the story through the work of caregivers.

237
0:14:50.7,000 --> 0:14:54,000
I thought it was important to emphasize that people were being helped,

238
0:14:54.7,000 --> 0:14:58,000
whether by international NGOs or by local grassroots organizations.

239
0:14:59.146,000 --> 0:15:01,000
So many children have been orphaned by the epidemic

240
0:15:01.7,000 --> 0:15:04,000
that grandmothers have taken the place of parents,

241
0:15:04.7,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and a lot of children had been born with HIV.

242
0:15:08.7,000 --> 0:15:1,000
A hospital in Zambia.

243
0:15:13.7,000 --> 0:15:16,000
I began documenting the close connection

244
0:15:16.7,000 --> 0:15:19,000
between HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.

245
0:15:19.7,000 --> 0:15:22,000
This is an MSF hospital in Cambodia.

246
0:15:27.3,000 --> 0:15:29,000
My pictures can play a supporting role to the work of NGOs

247
0:15:30.038,000 --> 0:15:34,000
by shedding light on the critical social problems they're trying to deal with.

248
0:15:34.7,000 --> 0:15:37,000
I went to Congo with MSF,

249
0:15:37.7,000 --> 0:15:39,000
and contributed to a book and an exhibition

250
0:15:39.7,000 --> 0:15:42,000
that focused attention on a forgotten war

251
0:15:42.7,000 --> 0:15:44,000
in which millions of people have died,

252
0:15:44.7,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and exposure to disease without treatment is used as a weapon.

253
0:15:49.7,000 --> 0:15:51,000
A malnourished child being measured

254
0:15:51.7,000 --> 0:15:53,000
as part of the supplemental feeding program.

255
0:15:55.7,000 --> 0:15:58,000
In the fall of 2004 I went to Darfur.

256
0:15:59.7,000 --> 0:16:01,000
This time I was on assignment for a magazine,

257
0:16:01.7,000 --> 0:16:03,000
but again worked closely with MSF.

258
0:16:03.7,000 --> 0:16:06,000
The international community still hasn't found a way

259
0:16:06.7,000 --> 0:16:1,000
to create the pressure necessary to stop this genocide.

260
0:16:11.762,000 --> 0:16:14,000
An MSF hospital in a camp for displaced people.

261
0:16:17.054,000 --> 0:16:21,000
I've been working on a long project on crime and punishment in America.

262
0:16:21.869,000 --> 0:16:23,000
This is a scene from New Orleans.

263
0:16:26.7,000 --> 0:16:28,000
A prisoner on a chain gang in Alabama

264
0:16:29.038,000 --> 0:16:32,000
was punished by being handcuffed to a post in the midday sun.

265
0:16:35.7,000 --> 0:16:37,000
This experience raised a lot of questions,

266
0:16:37.7,000 --> 0:16:4,000
among them questions about race and equality

267
0:16:40.7,000 --> 0:16:45,000
and for whom in our country opportunities and options are available.

268
0:16:45.7,000 --> 0:16:48,000
In the yard of a chain gang in Alabama.

269
0:16:50.977,000 --> 0:16:52,000
I didn't see either of the planes hit,

270
0:16:53.131,000 --> 0:16:56,000
and when I glanced out my window, I saw the first tower burning,

271
0:16:56.7,000 --> 0:16:59,000
and I thought it might have been an accident.

272
0:16:59.7,000 --> 0:17:01,000
A few minutes later when I looked again

273
0:17:01.7,000 --> 0:17:05,000
and saw the second tower burning, I knew we were at war.

274
0:17:06.7,000 --> 0:17:09,000
In the midst of the wreckage at Ground Zero, I had a realization.

275
0:17:09.915,000 --> 0:17:13,000
I'd been photographing in the Islamic world since 1981 --

276
0:17:14.7,000 --> 0:17:18,000
not only in the Middle East, but also in Africa, Asia and Europe.

277
0:17:19.346,000 --> 0:17:21,000
At the time I was photographing in these different places,

278
0:17:22.315,000 --> 0:17:24,000
I thought I was covering separate stories,

279
0:17:24.346,000 --> 0:17:27,000
but on 9/11 history crystallized, and I understood

280
0:17:27.7,000 --> 0:17:31,000
I'd actually been covering a single story for more than 20 years,

281
0:17:32.1,000 --> 0:17:35,000
and the attack on New York was its latest manifestation.

282
0:17:36.7,000 --> 0:17:39,000
The central commercial district of Kabul, Afghanistan

283
0:17:39.7,000 --> 0:17:41,000
at the end of the civil war,

284
0:17:41.7,000 --> 0:17:44,000
shortly before the city fell to the Taliban.

285
0:17:47.085,000 --> 0:17:49,000
Land mine victims being helped

286
0:17:49.7,000 --> 0:17:52,000
at the Red Cross rehab center being run by Alberto Cairo.

287
0:17:54.7,000 --> 0:17:56,000
A boy who lost a leg to a leftover mine.

288
0:17:57.315,000 --> 0:18:,000
I'd witnessed immense suffering in the Islamic world

289
0:18:00.7,000 --> 0:18:05,000
from political oppression, civil war, foreign invasions, poverty, famine.

290
0:18:05.7,000 --> 0:18:07,000
I understood that in its suffering,

291
0:18:07.7,000 --> 0:18:12,000
the Islamic world had been crying out. Why weren't we listening?

292
0:18:15.331,000 --> 0:18:17,000
A Taliban fighter shot during a battle

293
0:18:17.7,000 --> 0:18:21,000
as the Northern Alliance entered the city of Kunduz.

294
0:18:27.438,000 --> 0:18:29,000
When war with Iraq was imminent,

295
0:18:29.7,000 --> 0:18:32,000
I realized the American troops would be very well covered,

296
0:18:32.7,000 --> 0:18:35,000
so I decided to cover the invasion from inside Baghdad.

297
0:18:41.7,000 --> 0:18:43,000
A marketplace was hit by a mortar shell

298
0:18:43.7,000 --> 0:18:46,000
that killed several members of a single family.

299
0:18:48.7,000 --> 0:18:51,000
A day after American forces entered Baghdad,

300
0:18:51.7,000 --> 0:18:53,000
a company of Marines began rounding up bank robbers

301
0:18:53.7,000 --> 0:18:55,000
and were cheered on by the crowds --

302
0:18:56.7,000 --> 0:18:58,000
a hopeful moment that was short lived.

303
0:18:59.9,000 --> 0:19:01,000
For the first time in years,

304
0:19:02.069,000 --> 0:19:04,000
Shi'ites were allowed to make the pilgrimage

305
0:19:04.392,000 --> 0:19:06,000
to Karbala to observe Ashura,

306
0:19:06.7,000 --> 0:19:08,000
and I was amazed by the sheer number of people

307
0:19:09.285,000 --> 0:19:11,000
and how fervently they practiced their religion.

308
0:19:14.7,000 --> 0:19:17,000
A group of men march through the streets cutting themselves with knives.

309
0:19:17.7,000 --> 0:19:21,000
It was obvious that the Shi'ites were a force to be reckoned with,

310
0:19:21.7,000 --> 0:19:26,000
and we would do well to understand them and learn how to deal with them.

311
0:19:28.7,000 --> 0:19:31,000
Last year I spent several months documenting our wounded troops,

312
0:19:32.392,000 --> 0:19:34,000
from the battlefield in Iraq all the way home.

313
0:19:35.946,000 --> 0:19:37,000
This is a helicopter medic giving CPR

314
0:19:38.408,000 --> 0:19:4,000
to a soldier who had been shot in the head.

315
0:19:42.762,000 --> 0:19:44,000
Military medicine has become so efficient

316
0:19:45.285,000 --> 0:19:48,000
that the percentage of troops who survive after being wounded

317
0:19:49.1,000 --> 0:19:52,000
is much higher in this war than in any other war in our history.

318
0:19:54.346,000 --> 0:19:57,000
The signature weapon of the war is the IED,

319
0:19:57.7,000 --> 0:20:,000
and the signature wound is severe leg damage.

320
0:20:02.069,000 --> 0:20:05,000
After enduring extreme pain and trauma,

321
0:20:05.269,000 --> 0:20:07,000
the wounded face a grueling physical

322
0:20:07.7,000 --> 0:20:09,000
and psychological struggle in rehab.

323
0:20:12.069,000 --> 0:20:15,000
The spirit they displayed was absolutely remarkable.

324
0:20:16.238,000 --> 0:20:18,000
I tried to imagine myself in their place,

325
0:20:18.7,000 --> 0:20:22,000
and I was totally humbled by their courage and determination

326
0:20:22.7,000 --> 0:20:25,000
in the face of such catastrophic loss.

327
0:20:26.162,000 --> 0:20:31,000
Good people had been put in a very bad situation for questionable results.

328
0:20:34.192,000 --> 0:20:37,000
One day in rehab someone, started talking about surfing

329
0:20:37.7,000 --> 0:20:41,000
and all these guys who'd never surfed before said, "Hey, let's go."

330
0:20:42.038,000 --> 0:20:43,000
And they went surfing.

331
0:20:47.285,000 --> 0:20:5,000
Photographers go to the extreme edges of human experience

332
0:20:50.7,000 --> 0:20:52,000
to show people what's going on.

333
0:20:52.7,000 --> 0:20:55,000
Sometimes they put their lives on the line,

334
0:20:55.7,000 --> 0:20:59,000
because they believe your opinions and your influence matter.

335
0:20:59.7,000 --> 0:21:03,000
They aim their pictures at your best instincts,

336
0:21:03.7,000 --> 0:21:06,000
generosity, a sense of right and wrong,

337
0:21:06.7,000 --> 0:21:1,000
the ability and the willingness to identify with others,

338
0:21:10.7,000 --> 0:21:13,000
the refusal to accept the unacceptable.

339
0:21:15.7,000 --> 0:21:17,000
My TED wish:

340
0:21:17.7,000 --> 0:21:2,000
there's a vital story that needs to be told,

341
0:21:20.7,000 --> 0:21:24,000
and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it

342
0:21:24.7,000 --> 0:21:28,000
and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways

343
0:21:28.7,000 --> 0:21:31,000
to use news photography in the digital era.

344
0:21:31.7,000 --> 0:21:33,000
Thank you very much.

345
0:21:34.7,000 --> 0:21:49,000
(Applause)

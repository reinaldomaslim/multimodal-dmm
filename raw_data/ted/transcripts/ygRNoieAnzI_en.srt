Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast

2
0:00:16.272,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Well, I was born with a rare visual condition

3
0:00:19.451,000 --> 0:00:22,000
called achromatopsia, which is total color blindness,

4
0:00:23.164,000 --> 0:00:24,000
so I've never seen color,

5
0:00:25.034,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and I don't know what color looks like,

6
0:00:27.557,000 --> 0:00:29,000
because I come from a grayscale world.

7
0:00:30.532,000 --> 0:00:32,000
To me, the sky is always gray,

8
0:00:33.192,000 --> 0:00:34,000
flowers are always gray,

9
0:00:35.044,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and television is still in black and white.

10
0:00:37.246,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But, since the age of 21,

11
0:00:39.539,000 --> 0:00:43,000
instead of seeing color, I can hear color.

12
0:00:43.668,000 --> 0:00:45,000
In 2003, I started a project

13
0:00:46.644,000 --> 0:00:48,000
with computer scientist Adam Montandon,

14
0:00:49.332,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and the result, with further collaborations

15
0:00:52.499,000 --> 0:00:54,000
with Peter Kese from Slovenia

16
0:00:55.347,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and Matias Lizana from Barcelona,

17
0:00:57.38,000 --> 0:00:59,000
is this electronic eye.

18
0:00:59.745,000 --> 0:01:01,000
It's a color sensor that detects

19
0:01:02.101,000 --> 0:01:05,000
the color frequency in front of me — (Frequency sounds) —

20
0:01:05.684,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and sends this frequency to a chip installed

21
0:01:08.036,000 --> 0:01:1,000
at the back of my head, and I hear the color in front of me

22
0:01:11.027,000 --> 0:01:13,000
through the bone, through bone conduction.

23
0:01:13.923,000 --> 0:01:16,000
(Frequency sounds) So, for example, if I have, like —

24
0:01:20.984,000 --> 0:01:22,000
This is the sound of purple. (Frequency sounds)

25
0:01:23.951,000 --> 0:01:3,000
For example, this is the sound of grass. (Frequency sounds)

26
0:01:31.369,000 --> 0:01:33,000
This is red, like TED. (Frequency sounds)

27
0:01:33.494,000 --> 0:01:37,000
This is the sound of a dirty sock. (Laughter)

28
0:01:37.863,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Which is like yellow, this one.

29
0:01:39.74,000 --> 0:01:43,000
So I've been hearing color all the time for eight years,

30
0:01:43.797,000 --> 0:01:45,000
since 2004, so I find it completely normal now

31
0:01:46.432,000 --> 0:01:48,000
to hear color all the time.

32
0:01:48.911,000 --> 0:01:52,000
At the start, though, I had to memorize the names you give

33
0:01:53.285,000 --> 0:01:55,000
for each color, so I had to memorize the notes,

34
0:01:55.691,000 --> 0:01:56,000
but after some time, all this information

35
0:01:57.627,000 --> 0:01:58,000
became a perception.

36
0:01:59.62,000 --> 0:02:,000
I didn't have to think about the notes.

37
0:02:01.379,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And after some time, this perception became a feeling.

38
0:02:04.004,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I started to have favorite colors,

39
0:02:06.01,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and I started to dream in colors.

40
0:02:07.784,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So, when I started to dream in color is when I felt

41
0:02:12.059,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that the software and my brain had united,

42
0:02:14.946,000 --> 0:02:16,000
because in my dreams, it was my brain creating

43
0:02:17.902,000 --> 0:02:19,000
electronic sounds. It wasn't the software,

44
0:02:20.263,000 --> 0:02:23,000
so that's when I started to feel like a cyborg.

45
0:02:23.782,000 --> 0:02:26,000
It's when I started to feel that the cybernetic device

46
0:02:26.832,000 --> 0:02:28,000
was no longer a device.

47
0:02:29.022,000 --> 0:02:31,000
It had become a part of my body,

48
0:02:31.437,000 --> 0:02:33,000
an extension of my senses,

49
0:02:33.902,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and after some time, it even became a part

50
0:02:36.528,000 --> 0:02:39,000
of my official image.

51
0:02:40.055,000 --> 0:02:42,000
This is my passport from 2004.

52
0:02:42.401,000 --> 0:02:45,000
You're not allowed to appear on U.K. passports

53
0:02:45.486,000 --> 0:02:47,000
with electronic equipment, but I insisted

54
0:02:48.298,000 --> 0:02:5,000
to the passport office that what they were seeing

55
0:02:50.699,000 --> 0:02:52,000
was actually a new part of my body,

56
0:02:53.203,000 --> 0:02:56,000
an extension of my brain, and they finally accepted me

57
0:02:56.723,000 --> 0:02:58,000
to appear with the passport photo.

58
0:02:59.234,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So, life has changed dramatically since I hear color,

59
0:03:02.691,000 --> 0:03:04,000
because color is almost everywhere,

60
0:03:05.285,000 --> 0:03:07,000
so the biggest change for example is

61
0:03:08.162,000 --> 0:03:12,000
going to an art gallery, I can listen to a Picasso,

62
0:03:12.7,000 --> 0:03:14,000
for example. So it's like I'm going to a concert hall,

63
0:03:15.554,000 --> 0:03:17,000
because I can listen to the paintings.

64
0:03:17.765,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And supermarkets, I find this is very shocking,

65
0:03:20.226,000 --> 0:03:22,000
it's very, very attractive to walk along a supermarket.

66
0:03:23.176,000 --> 0:03:24,000
It's like going to a nightclub.

67
0:03:24.664,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It's full of different melodies. (Laughter) Yeah.

68
0:03:27.92,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Especially the aisle with cleaning products.

69
0:03:29.995,000 --> 0:03:32,000
It's just fabulous. (Laughter)

70
0:03:33.346,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Also, the way I dress has changed.

71
0:03:35.818,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Before, I used to dress in a way that it looked good.

72
0:03:38.226,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Now I dress in a way that it sounds good. (Laughter)

73
0:03:42.803,000 --> 0:03:47,000
(Applause)

74
0:03:47.934,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So today I'm dressed in C major,

75
0:03:50.443,000 --> 0:03:53,000
so it's quite a happy chord. (Laughter)

76
0:03:53.752,000 --> 0:03:54,000
If I had to go to a funeral, though,

77
0:03:55.626,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I would dress in B minor, which would be

78
0:03:58.193,000 --> 0:04:06,000
turquoise, purple and orange. (Laughter)

79
0:04:06.952,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Also, food, the way I look at food has changed,

80
0:04:11.297,000 --> 0:04:14,000
because now I can display the food on a plate,

81
0:04:14.753,000 --> 0:04:16,000
so I can eat my favorite song. (Laughter)

82
0:04:17.705,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So depending on how I display it,

83
0:04:18.934,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I can hear and I can compose music with food.

84
0:04:21.684,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So imagine a restaurant where we can have, like,

85
0:04:24.409,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Lady Gaga salads as starters. (Laughter) I mean,

86
0:04:27.393,000 --> 0:04:3,000
this would get teenagers to eat their vegetables, probably.

87
0:04:30.41,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And also, some Rachmaninov piano concertos

88
0:04:33.849,000 --> 0:04:36,000
as main dishes, and some Bjork or Madonna desserts,

89
0:04:37.083,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that would be a very exciting restaurant

90
0:04:40.192,000 --> 0:04:42,000
where you can actually eat songs.

91
0:04:42.952,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Also, the way I perceive beauty has changed,

92
0:04:47.402,000 --> 0:04:51,000
because when I look at someone, I hear their face,

93
0:04:52.082,000 --> 0:04:57,000
so someone might look very beautiful but sound terrible.

94
0:04:57.084,000 --> 0:04:58,000
(Laughter) And it might happen the opposite,

95
0:04:58.845,000 --> 0:05:,000
the other way around. So I really enjoy creating, like,

96
0:05:01.093,000 --> 0:05:02,000
sound portraits of people.

97
0:05:02.822,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Instead of drawing someone's face, like drawing the shape,

98
0:05:06.462,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I point at them with the eye and I write down

99
0:05:08.893,000 --> 0:05:11,000
the different notes I hear, and then I create sound portraits.

100
0:05:12.164,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Here's some faces.

101
0:05:13.901,000 --> 0:05:27,000
(Musical chords)

102
0:05:28.428,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Yeah, Nicole Kidman sounds good. (Laughter)

103
0:05:31.861,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Some people, I would never relate, but they sound similar.

104
0:05:34.91,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Prince Charles has some similarities with Nicole Kidman.

105
0:05:37.708,000 --> 0:05:39,000
They have similar sound of eyes.

106
0:05:39.845,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So you relate people that you wouldn't relate,

107
0:05:41.893,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and you can actually also create concerts

108
0:05:45.406,000 --> 0:05:47,000
by looking at the audience faces.

109
0:05:48.046,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So I connect the eye, and then I play the audience's faces.

110
0:05:51.142,000 --> 0:05:52,000
The good thing about this is,

111
0:05:52.646,000 --> 0:05:54,000
if the concert doesn't sound good, it's their fault.

112
0:05:55.613,000 --> 0:05:57,000
It's not my fault, because — (Laughter)

113
0:05:57.884,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And so another thing that happens is that

114
0:06:02.191,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I started having this secondary effect

115
0:06:05.068,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that normal sounds started to become color.

116
0:06:08.398,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I heard a telephone tone, and it felt green

117
0:06:12.159,000 --> 0:06:14,000
because it sounded just like the color green.

118
0:06:14.485,000 --> 0:06:17,000
The BBC beeps, they sound turquoise,

119
0:06:17.783,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and listening to Mozart became a yellow experience,

120
0:06:20.91,000 --> 0:06:24,000
so I started to paint music and paint people's voices,

121
0:06:25.67,000 --> 0:06:26,000
because people's voices have frequencies

122
0:06:27.613,000 --> 0:06:28,000
that I relate to color.

123
0:06:29.156,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And here's some music translated into color.

124
0:06:34.275,000 --> 0:06:39,000
For example, Mozart, "Queen of the Night," looks like this.

125
0:06:39.475,000 --> 0:06:4,000
(Music) Very yellow and very colorful,

126
0:06:41.287,000 --> 0:06:43,000
because there's many different frequencies.

127
0:06:43.477,000 --> 0:06:45,000
(Music)

128
0:06:47.403,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And this is a completely different song.

129
0:06:49.717,000 --> 0:06:52,000
(Music) It's Justin Bieber's "Baby." (Laughter)

130
0:06:53.648,000 --> 0:06:54,000
(Music)

131
0:06:55.379,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It is very pink and very yellow.

132
0:06:58.949,000 --> 0:07:05,000
So, also voices, I can transform speeches into color,

133
0:07:06.116,000 --> 0:07:09,000
for example, these are two very well-known speeches.

134
0:07:09.66,000 --> 0:07:12,000
One of them is Martin Luther King's "I Have A Dream,"

135
0:07:13.397,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and the other one is Hitler.

136
0:07:14.849,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And I like to exhibit these paintings in the exhibition halls

137
0:07:18.325,000 --> 0:07:2,000
without labels, and then I ask people,

138
0:07:20.901,000 --> 0:07:21,000
"Which one do you prefer?"

139
0:07:22.748,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And most people change their preference

140
0:07:25.013,000 --> 0:07:27,000
when I tell them that the one on the left is Hitler

141
0:07:27.924,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and the one on the right is Martin Luther King.

142
0:07:31.044,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So I got to a point when I was able to perceive 360 colors,

143
0:07:36.783,000 --> 0:07:37,000
just like human vision.

144
0:07:38.368,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel.

145
0:07:41.963,000 --> 0:07:43,000
But then, I just thought that

146
0:07:44.045,000 --> 0:07:47,000
this human vision wasn't good enough.

147
0:07:47.284,000 --> 0:07:49,000
There's many, many more colors around us

148
0:07:49.495,000 --> 0:07:5,000
that we cannot perceive,

149
0:07:51.332,000 --> 0:07:52,000
but that electronic eyes can perceive.

150
0:07:53.088,000 --> 0:07:56,000
So I decided to continue extending my color senses,

151
0:07:56.817,000 --> 0:08:,000
and I added infrared and I added ultraviolet

152
0:08:01.067,000 --> 0:08:04,000
to the color-to-sound scale, so now I can hear colors

153
0:08:04.425,000 --> 0:08:06,000
that the human eye cannot perceive.

154
0:08:06.649,000 --> 0:08:09,000
For example, perceiving infrared is good because you can

155
0:08:10.096,000 --> 0:08:14,000
actually detect if there's movement detectors in a room.

156
0:08:14.164,000 --> 0:08:17,000
I can hear if someone points at me with a remote control.

157
0:08:17.617,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And the good thing about perceiving ultraviolet is that

158
0:08:20.767,000 --> 0:08:24,000
you can hear if it's a good day or a bad day to sunbathe,

159
0:08:25.732,000 --> 0:08:27,000
because ultraviolet is a dangerous color,

160
0:08:27.889,000 --> 0:08:3,000
a color that can actually kill us, so I think we should all have this wish

161
0:08:31.873,000 --> 0:08:33,000
to perceive things that we cannot perceive.

162
0:08:34.834,000 --> 0:08:35,000
That's why, two years ago,

163
0:08:36.569,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I created the Cyborg Foundation,

164
0:08:38.25,000 --> 0:08:4,000
which is a foundation that tries to help people

165
0:08:40.692,000 --> 0:08:42,000
become a cyborg, tries to encourage people

166
0:08:43.389,000 --> 0:08:44,000
to extend their senses

167
0:08:44.766,000 --> 0:08:47,000
by using technology as part of the body.

168
0:08:47.837,000 --> 0:08:5,000
We should all think that knowledge comes from our senses,

169
0:08:51.74,000 --> 0:08:52,000
so if we extend our senses,

170
0:08:53.716,000 --> 0:08:56,000
we will consequently extend our knowledge.

171
0:08:56.804,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I think life will be much more exciting

172
0:08:59.597,000 --> 0:09:02,000
when we stop creating applications for mobile phones

173
0:09:02.821,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and we start creating applications for our own body.

174
0:09:06.222,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I think this will be a big, big change

175
0:09:08.038,000 --> 0:09:1,000
that we will see during this century.

176
0:09:10.116,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So I do encourage you all to think about which senses

177
0:09:14.031,000 --> 0:09:15,000
you'd like to extend.

178
0:09:15.45,000 --> 0:09:18,000
I would encourage you to become a cyborg.

179
0:09:18.623,000 --> 0:09:22,000
You won't be alone. Thank you. (Applause)

180
0:09:23.271,000 --> 0:09:29,000
(Applause)

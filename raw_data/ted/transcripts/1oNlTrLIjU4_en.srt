1
0:00:12.751,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Nina Dølvik Brochmann: We grew up believing

2
0:00:14.794,000 --> 0:00:17,000
that the hymen is a proof of virginity.

3
0:00:19.358,000 --> 0:00:2,000
But it turns out, we were wrong.

4
0:00:22.06,000 --> 0:00:23,000
What we discovered

5
0:00:23.489,000 --> 0:00:27,000
is that the popular story we're told about female virginity

6
0:00:28.208,000 --> 0:00:31,000
is based on two anatomical myths.

7
0:00:33.374,000 --> 0:00:37,000
The truth has been known in medical communities for over 100 years,

8
0:00:38.251,000 --> 0:00:44,000
yet somehow these two myths continue to make life difficult

9
0:00:44.346,000 --> 0:00:45,000
for women around the world.

10
0:00:47.714,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Ellen Støkken Dahl: The first myth is about blood.

11
0:00:51.457,000 --> 0:00:54,000
It tells us that the hymen breaks and bleeds

12
0:00:55.163,000 --> 0:00:58,000
the first time a woman has vaginal sex.

13
0:00:59.04,000 --> 0:01:02,000
In other words, if there is no blood on the sheets afterwards,

14
0:01:02.758,000 --> 0:01:04,000
then the woman was simply not a virgin.

15
0:01:06.959,000 --> 0:01:1,000
The second myth is a logical consequence of the first.

16
0:01:11.861,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Since the hymen is thought to break and bleed,

17
0:01:15.559,000 --> 0:01:18,000
people also believe that it actually disappears

18
0:01:19.29,000 --> 0:01:24,000
or is in some way radically altered during a woman's first intercourse.

19
0:01:26.037,000 --> 0:01:27,000
If that were true,

20
0:01:28.216,000 --> 0:01:33,000
one would easily be able to determine if a woman is a virgin or not

21
0:01:33.993,000 --> 0:01:35,000
by examining her genitals,

22
0:01:36.176,000 --> 0:01:38,000
by doing a virginity check.

23
0:01:40.29,000 --> 0:01:41,000
NDB: So that's our two myths:

24
0:01:42.118,000 --> 0:01:43,000
virgins bleed,

25
0:01:43.789,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and hymens are lost forever.

26
0:01:47.301,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Now, this may sound like a minor issue to you.

27
0:01:50.484,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Why should you care

28
0:01:52.104,000 --> 0:01:56,000
about an obscure little skin fold on the female body?

29
0:01:57.823,000 --> 0:02:,000
But the truth is, this is about so much more

30
0:02:01.052,000 --> 0:02:03,000
than an anatomical misunderstanding.

31
0:02:05.186,000 --> 0:02:08,000
The myths about the hymen have lived on for centuries

32
0:02:09.19,000 --> 0:02:11,000
because they have cultural significance.

33
0:02:12.536,000 --> 0:02:14,000
They have been used as a powerful tool

34
0:02:15.474,000 --> 0:02:18,000
in the effort to control women's sexuality

35
0:02:18.711,000 --> 0:02:22,000
in about every culture, religion and historical decade.

36
0:02:24.705,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Women are still mistrusted,

37
0:02:28.049,000 --> 0:02:29,000
shamed,

38
0:02:29.433,000 --> 0:02:3,000
harmed

39
0:02:30.626,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and, in the worst cases, subjected to honor killings

40
0:02:34.147,000 --> 0:02:36,000
if they don't bleed on their wedding night.

41
0:02:38.488,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Other women are forced through degrading virginity checks,

42
0:02:43.17,000 --> 0:02:45,000
simply to obtain a job,

43
0:02:46.592,000 --> 0:02:48,000
to save their reputation

44
0:02:48.624,000 --> 0:02:49,000
or to get married.

45
0:02:51.367,000 --> 0:02:52,000
ESD: Like in Indonesia,

46
0:02:53.304,000 --> 0:02:57,000
where women are systematically examined to enter military service.

47
0:02:59.336,000 --> 0:03:02,000
After the Egyptian uprisings in 2011,

48
0:03:02.947,000 --> 0:03:07,000
a group of female protesters were forced to undergo virginity checks

49
0:03:08.251,000 --> 0:03:09,000
by their military.

50
0:03:10.936,000 --> 0:03:14,000
In Oslo, doctors are examining the hymens of young girls

51
0:03:15.903,000 --> 0:03:19,000
to reassure parents that their children are not ruined.

52
0:03:20.625,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And sadly, the list goes on.

53
0:03:24.533,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Women are so afraid not to live up to the myths about the hymen

54
0:03:29.85,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that they choose to use different virginity quick fixes

55
0:03:34.332,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to assure a bleeding.

56
0:03:36.952,000 --> 0:03:37,000
That could be plastic surgery,

57
0:03:38.88,000 --> 0:03:39,000
known as "revirgination,"

58
0:03:40.968,000 --> 0:03:43,000
it could be vials of blood poured on the sheets after sex

59
0:03:44.887,000 --> 0:03:47,000
or fake hymens bought online,

60
0:03:48.232,000 --> 0:03:49,000
complete with theater blood

61
0:03:50.089,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and a promise to "kiss your deep, dark secret goodbye."

62
0:03:58.438,000 --> 0:04:02,000
NDB: By telling girls that no deed can be kept secret,

63
0:04:03.555,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that their bodies will reveal them no matter what,

64
0:04:07.905,000 --> 0:04:09,000
we have endowed them with fear.

65
0:04:12.07,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Girls are afraid of ruining themselves,

66
0:04:14.981,000 --> 0:04:15,000
either through sport,

67
0:04:16.789,000 --> 0:04:17,000
play,

68
0:04:17.964,000 --> 0:04:18,000
tampon use

69
0:04:19.139,000 --> 0:04:2,000
or a sexual activity.

70
0:04:21.656,000 --> 0:04:24,000
We have curtailed their opportunities and their freedoms.

71
0:04:26.213,000 --> 0:04:29,000
It's time we put an end to the virginity fraud.

72
0:04:30.282,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It's time we break the myths about the hymen

73
0:04:33.277,000 --> 0:04:34,000
once and for all.

74
0:04:36.267,000 --> 0:04:38,000
ESD: We are medical students,

75
0:04:38.388,000 --> 0:04:39,000
sexual health workers

76
0:04:40.28,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and the authors of "The Wonder Down Under."

77
0:04:43.804,000 --> 0:04:44,000
(Laughter)

78
0:04:45.598,000 --> 0:04:48,000
That's a popular science book about the female genitals.

79
0:04:49.852,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And in our experience, people seem to believe

80
0:04:52.716,000 --> 0:04:56,000
that the hymen is some kind of a seal covering the vaginal opening.

81
0:04:58.161,000 --> 0:05:01,000
In Norwegian, it is even called "the virgin membrane."

82
0:05:02.376,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And with this, we picture something fragile,

83
0:05:05.409,000 --> 0:05:07,000
something easily destructible,

84
0:05:08.264,000 --> 0:05:09,000
something you can rip through,

85
0:05:10.738,000 --> 0:05:13,000
perhaps like a sheet of plastic wrapping.

86
0:05:15.045,000 --> 0:05:18,000
You may have wondered why we brought a hula hoop onstage today.

87
0:05:19.838,000 --> 0:05:2,000
We'll show you.

88
0:05:23.466,000 --> 0:05:24,000
(Laughter)

89
0:05:27.096,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Now, it is very hard to hide

90
0:05:29.974,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that something has happened to this hoop, right?

91
0:05:33.442,000 --> 0:05:36,000
It is different before and after I punched it.

92
0:05:37.035,000 --> 0:05:38,000
The seal is broken,

93
0:05:39.586,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and unless we change the plastic,

94
0:05:41.369,000 --> 0:05:43,000
it won't get back to its intact state.

95
0:05:44.677,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So if we wanted to do a virginity check on this hoop right here,

96
0:05:48.982,000 --> 0:05:49,000
right now,

97
0:05:50.266,000 --> 0:05:51,000
that would be very easy.

98
0:05:52.827,000 --> 0:05:57,000
It's easy to say that this hoop is not a virgin anymore.

99
0:05:59.244,000 --> 0:06:,000
(Laughter)

100
0:06:01.184,000 --> 0:06:04,000
NDB: But the hymen is nothing like a piece of plastic

101
0:06:04.629,000 --> 0:06:06,000
you can wrap around your food,

102
0:06:06.659,000 --> 0:06:07,000
or a seal.

103
0:06:08.456,000 --> 0:06:09,000
In fact ...

104
0:06:12.435,000 --> 0:06:13,000
it's more like this --

105
0:06:14.609,000 --> 0:06:16,000
a scrunchie or a rubber band.

106
0:06:18.437,000 --> 0:06:23,000
The hymen is a rim of tissue at the outer opening of the vagina.

107
0:06:24.103,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And usually, it has a doughnut or a half-moon shape

108
0:06:28.422,000 --> 0:06:3,000
with a large, central hole.

109
0:06:31.855,000 --> 0:06:32,000
But this varies a lot,

110
0:06:33.331,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and sometimes hymens can have fringes,

111
0:06:36.791,000 --> 0:06:37,000
it can have several holes,

112
0:06:39.182,000 --> 0:06:41,000
or it can consist of lobes.

113
0:06:42.696,000 --> 0:06:46,000
In other words, hymens naturally vary a lot in looks,

114
0:06:47.493,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and that is what makes it so hard to do a virginity check.

115
0:06:53.614,000 --> 0:06:56,000
ESD: Now that we know a bit more about the hymen's anatomy,

116
0:06:57.178,000 --> 0:06:59,000
it's time to get back to our two myths:

117
0:07:00.24,000 --> 0:07:01,000
virgins bleed,

118
0:07:01.793,000 --> 0:07:03,000
hymens are lost forever.

119
0:07:05.224,000 --> 0:07:08,000
But the hymen doesn't have to break at all.

120
0:07:09.685,000 --> 0:07:13,000
The hymen is like a scrunchie in function as well as in looks.

121
0:07:15.165,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And you can stretch a scrunchie, right?

122
0:07:18.811,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Laughter)

123
0:07:20.446,000 --> 0:07:22,000
You can stretch a hymen, too.

124
0:07:23.673,000 --> 0:07:25,000
In fact, it's very elastic.

125
0:07:28.467,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And for a lot of women,

126
0:07:29.945,000 --> 0:07:33,000
the hymen will be elastic enough to handle a vaginal intercourse

127
0:07:34.617,000 --> 0:07:36,000
without sustaining any damage.

128
0:07:39.051,000 --> 0:07:44,000
For other women, the hymen may tear a bit to make room for the penis,

129
0:07:44.752,000 --> 0:07:45,000
but that won't make it disappear.

130
0:07:47.262,000 --> 0:07:49,000
But it may look a bit different from before.

131
0:07:50.356,000 --> 0:07:53,000
It naturally follows that you can't examine the hymen

132
0:07:53.855,000 --> 0:07:54,000
to check for virginity status.

133
0:07:56.565,000 --> 0:07:59,000
This was noted over 100 years ago in 1906

134
0:08:00.563,000 --> 0:08:02,000
by the Norwegian doctor Marie Jeancet.

135
0:08:04.432,000 --> 0:08:07,000
She examined a middle-aged sex worker

136
0:08:09.014,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and concluded that her genitalia were reminiscent of a teenage virgin.

137
0:08:15.663,000 --> 0:08:16,000
But that makes sense, right?

138
0:08:17.606,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Because if her hymen was never damaged during sex,

139
0:08:21.77,000 --> 0:08:23,000
then what were we expecting to see?

140
0:08:26.025,000 --> 0:08:29,000
ESD: Since hymens come in every shape and form,

141
0:08:30.098,000 --> 0:08:31,000
it is difficult to know

142
0:08:31.514,000 --> 0:08:36,000
if a dent or a fold in it is there because of previous damage

143
0:08:36.729,000 --> 0:08:39,000
or if it's just a normal anatomical variant.

144
0:08:41.275,000 --> 0:08:43,000
The absurdity of virgin testing

145
0:08:44.542,000 --> 0:08:5,000
is illustrated in a study done on 36 pregnant teenagers.

146
0:08:51.821,000 --> 0:08:53,000
When doctors examined their hymens,

147
0:08:54.345,000 --> 0:08:57,000
they could only find clear signs of penetration

148
0:08:57.626,000 --> 0:09:,000
in two out of the 36 girls.

149
0:09:03.694,000 --> 0:09:07,000
So unless you believe in 34 cases of virgin births --

150
0:09:08.265,000 --> 0:09:09,000
(Laughter)

151
0:09:10.288,000 --> 0:09:11,000
we must all agree

152
0:09:11.924,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that also our second myth has taken a vital blow.

153
0:09:17.258,000 --> 0:09:2,000
You simply cannot look a woman between her legs

154
0:09:20.672,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and read her sexual story.

155
0:09:27.813,000 --> 0:09:31,000
NDB: Like most myths, the myths about the hymen are untrue.

156
0:09:33.391,000 --> 0:09:38,000
There is no virgin seal that magically disappears after sex,

157
0:09:38.934,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and half of virgins can easily have sex without bleeding.

158
0:09:45.583,000 --> 0:09:48,000
We wish we could say that by removing these myths,

159
0:09:48.936,000 --> 0:09:49,000
everything would be OK,

160
0:09:51.187,000 --> 0:09:56,000
that shame, harm and honor killings would all just disappear.

161
0:09:57.746,000 --> 0:09:59,000
But of course, it's not that simple.

162
0:10:00.602,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Sexual oppression of women comes from something much deeper

163
0:10:04.239,000 --> 0:10:09,000
than a simple anatomical misunderstanding about the properties of the hymen.

164
0:10:11.231,000 --> 0:10:16,000
It's a question of cultural and religious control of women's sexuality.

165
0:10:16.993,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And that is much harder to change.

166
0:10:20.203,000 --> 0:10:21,000
But we must try.

167
0:10:23.725,000 --> 0:10:27,000
ESD: As medical professionals, this is our contribution.

168
0:10:29.014,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We want every girl, parent and [future] husband to know

169
0:10:33.561,000 --> 0:10:36,000
what the hymen is and how it works.

170
0:10:38.103,000 --> 0:10:39,000
We want them to know

171
0:10:39.401,000 --> 0:10:42,000
that the hymen can't be used as a proof of virginity.

172
0:10:44.344,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And that way, we can remove one of the most powerful tools

173
0:10:48.965,000 --> 0:10:5,000
used to control young women today.

174
0:10:53.673,000 --> 0:10:54,000
After telling you this,

175
0:10:56.49,000 --> 0:10:58,000
you may wonder what the alternative is,

176
0:11:00.734,000 --> 0:11:04,000
for if we cannot use the hymen as a proof of virginity for women,

177
0:11:05.47,000 --> 0:11:06,000
then what should we use?

178
0:11:09.631,000 --> 0:11:11,000
We opt for using nothing.

179
0:11:12.885,000 --> 0:11:13,000
(Cheering)

180
0:11:14.887,000 --> 0:11:15,000
If you --

181
0:11:16.072,000 --> 0:11:2,000
(Applause)

182
0:11:22.326,000 --> 0:11:26,000
If you really want to know if a woman is a virgin or not,

183
0:11:26.785,000 --> 0:11:27,000
ask her.

184
0:11:27.963,000 --> 0:11:28,000
(Laughter)

185
0:11:29.449,000 --> 0:11:33,000
But how she answers that question is her choice.

186
0:11:35.771,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Thank you.

187
0:11:36.946,000 --> 0:11:38,000
(Applause)

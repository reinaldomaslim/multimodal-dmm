1
0:00:15.732,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Those of you who have seen the film "Moneyball,"

2
0:00:19.427,000 --> 0:00:2,000
or have read the book by Michael Lewis,

3
0:00:21.411,000 --> 0:00:24,000
will be familiar with the story of Billy Beane.

4
0:00:24.547,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Billy was supposed to be a tremendous ballplayer; all the scouts told him so.

5
0:00:29.235,000 --> 0:00:3,000
They told his parents that

6
0:00:30.428,000 --> 0:00:32,000
they predicted that he was going to be a star.

7
0:00:32.467,000 --> 0:00:36,000
But what actually happened when he signed the contract -- and by the way, he didn't

8
0:00:37.419,000 --> 0:00:39,000
want to sign that contract, he wanted to go to college --

9
0:00:39.843,000 --> 0:00:41,000
which is what my mother, who actually does love me,

10
0:00:42.5,000 --> 0:00:44,000
said that I should do too, and I did --

11
0:00:45.364,000 --> 0:00:48,000
well, he didn't do very well. He struggled mightily.

12
0:00:48.438,000 --> 0:00:52,000
He got traded a couple of times, he ended up in the Minors for most of his career,

13
0:00:52.971,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and he actually ended up in management. He ended up as a General Manager of the

14
0:00:57.059,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Oakland A's.

15
0:00:57.708,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Now for many of you in this room, ending up in management, which is also what I've done,

16
0:01:02.132,000 --> 0:01:03,000
is seen as a success.

17
0:01:03.828,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I can assure you that for a kid trying to make it in the Bigs,

18
0:01:07.03,000 --> 0:01:11,000
going into management ain't no success story. It's a failure.

19
0:01:11.739,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And what I want to talk to you about today, and share with you, is that our

20
0:01:16.178,000 --> 0:01:2,000
healthcare system, our medical system, is just as bad at predicting

21
0:01:20.618,000 --> 0:01:24,000
what happens to people in it -- patients, others --

22
0:01:24.81,000 --> 0:01:28,000
as those scouts were at predicting what would happen to Billy Beane.

23
0:01:29.423,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And yet, every day

24
0:01:32.104,000 --> 0:01:33,000
thousands of people in this country

25
0:01:34.065,000 --> 0:01:37,000
are diagnosed with preconditions.

26
0:01:37.991,000 --> 0:01:41,000
We hear about pre-hypertension, we hear about pre-dementia,

27
0:01:42.231,000 --> 0:01:47,000
we hear about pre-anxiety, and I'm pretty sure that I diagnosed myself with

28
0:01:47.567,000 --> 0:01:48,000
that in the green room.

29
0:01:48.944,000 --> 0:01:52,000
We also refer to subclinical conditions.

30
0:01:53.297,000 --> 0:01:57,000
There's subclinical atherosclerosis, subclinical hardening of the arteries,

31
0:01:57.848,000 --> 0:02:,000
obviously linked to heart attacks, potentially.

32
0:02:01.383,000 --> 0:02:04,000
One of my favorites is called subclinical acne.

33
0:02:04.816,000 --> 0:02:07,000
If you look up subclinical acne, you may find a website, which I did,

34
0:02:08.783,000 --> 0:02:12,000
which says that this is the easiest type of acne to treat.

35
0:02:12.912,000 --> 0:02:18,000
You don't have the pustules or the redness and inflammation.

36
0:02:19.527,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Maybe that's because you don't actually have acne.

37
0:02:23.183,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I have a name for all of these conditions, it's another precondition:

38
0:02:29.706,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I call them preposterous.

39
0:02:31.561,000 --> 0:02:37,000
In baseball, the game follows the pre-game.

40
0:02:37.62,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Season follows the pre-season.

41
0:02:40.025,000 --> 0:02:44,000
But with a lot of these conditions, that actually isn't the case, or at least it isn't the

42
0:02:44.548,000 --> 0:02:48,000
case all the time. It's as if there's a rain delay, every single time in many cases.

43
0:02:49.121,000 --> 0:02:5,000
We have pre-cancerous lesions,

44
0:02:50.939,000 --> 0:02:53,000
which often don't turn into cancer.

45
0:02:54.432,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And yet,

46
0:02:56.288,000 --> 0:02:59,000
if you take, for example, subclinical osteoporosis, a bone thinning disease,

47
0:03:00.214,000 --> 0:03:01,000
the precondition,

48
0:03:01.867,000 --> 0:03:03,000
otherwise known as osteopenia,

49
0:03:04.274,000 --> 0:03:07,000
you would have to treat 270 women for three years

50
0:03:07.944,000 --> 0:03:09,000
in order to prevent one broken bone.

51
0:03:10.144,000 --> 0:03:11,000
That's an awful lot of women

52
0:03:11.753,000 --> 0:03:13,000
when you multiply by the number of women who were diagnosed

53
0:03:14.68,000 --> 0:03:15,000
with this osteopenia.

54
0:03:16.569,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And so is it any wonder,

55
0:03:18.625,000 --> 0:03:2,000
given all of the costs and the side effects

56
0:03:21.155,000 --> 0:03:25,000
of the drugs that we're using to treat these preconditions, that every year

57
0:03:25.359,000 --> 0:03:28,000
we're spending more than two trillion dollars on healthcare and yet

58
0:03:29.032,000 --> 0:03:32,000
100,000 people a year -- and that's a conservative estimate -- are dying

59
0:03:32.319,000 --> 0:03:33,000
not because of the conditions they have,

60
0:03:34.232,000 --> 0:03:38,000
but because of the treatments that we're giving them and the complications of those treatments?

61
0:03:38.519,000 --> 0:03:4,000
We've medicalized everything

62
0:03:41.331,000 --> 0:03:41,000
in this country.

63
0:03:42.3,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Women in the audience, I have some

64
0:03:45.683,000 --> 0:03:46,000
pretty bad news that you already know,

65
0:03:47.682,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and that's that every aspect of your life

66
0:03:50.339,000 --> 0:03:51,000
has been medicalized.

67
0:03:51.747,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Strike one is when you hit puberty.

68
0:03:54.171,000 --> 0:03:58,000
You now have something that happens to you once a month that has been medicalized.

69
0:03:58.507,000 --> 0:03:58,000
It's a condition;

70
0:03:59.323,000 --> 0:04:,000
it has to be treated. Strike two

71
0:04:00.883,000 --> 0:04:01,000
is if you get pregnant.

72
0:04:02.483,000 --> 0:04:05,000
That's been medicalized as well.

73
0:04:05.579,000 --> 0:04:06,000
You have to have a high-tech experience

74
0:04:07.499,000 --> 0:04:09,000
of pregnancy, otherwise something might go wrong.

75
0:04:10.227,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Strike three is menopause.

76
0:04:13.834,000 --> 0:04:17,000
We all know what happened when millions of women were given hormone replacement therapy

77
0:04:18.171,000 --> 0:04:21,000
for menopausal symptoms

78
0:04:21.217,000 --> 0:04:25,000
for decades until all of a sudden we realized, because a study came out, a big one,

79
0:04:25.647,000 --> 0:04:26,000
NIH-funded.

80
0:04:26.655,000 --> 0:04:26,000
It said,

81
0:04:27.583,000 --> 0:04:31,000
actually, a lot of that hormone replacement therapy may be doing more harm than good

82
0:04:32.168,000 --> 0:04:33,000
for many of those women.

83
0:04:33.952,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Just in case,

84
0:04:36.2,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I don't want to leave the men out --

85
0:04:37.832,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I am one, after all --

86
0:04:39.448,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I have really bad news for all of you in this room,

87
0:04:42.137,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and for everyone

88
0:04:43.097,000 --> 0:04:44,000
listening and watching elsewhere:

89
0:04:44.843,000 --> 0:04:45,000
You all have

90
0:04:46.056,000 --> 0:04:48,000
a universally fatal condition.

91
0:04:48.992,000 --> 0:04:51,000
So, just take a moment.

92
0:04:52.3,000 --> 0:04:53,000
It's called pre-death.

93
0:04:53.632,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Every single one of you has it, because you have the risk factor for it,

94
0:04:58.704,000 --> 0:04:59,000
which is being alive.

95
0:05:00.448,000 --> 0:05:03,000
But I have some good news for you, because

96
0:05:03.506,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I'm a journalist, I like to end things in a happy way or a forward-thinking way.

97
0:05:07.536,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And that good news is that if you can survive to the end of my talk, which

98
0:05:11.465,000 --> 0:05:13,000
we'll see if that happens for everyone,

99
0:05:14.057,000 --> 0:05:17,000
you will be a pre-vivor.

100
0:05:17.352,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I made up pre-death.

101
0:05:22.168,000 --> 0:05:26,000
If I used someone else's pre-death, I apologize,

102
0:05:26.28,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I think I made it up.

103
0:05:27.865,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I didn't make up pre-vivor.

104
0:05:29.432,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Pre-vivor is what a particular cancer advocacy group would like everyone who

105
0:05:34.904,000 --> 0:05:35,000
just has a risk factor,

106
0:05:36.176,000 --> 0:05:38,000
but hasn't actually had that cancer,

107
0:05:38.698,000 --> 0:05:39,000
to call themselves.

108
0:05:40.072,000 --> 0:05:41,000
You are a pre-vivor.

109
0:05:41.647,000 --> 0:05:45,000
We've had HBO here this morning. I'm wondering if Mark Burnett is anywhere in the

110
0:05:46.12,000 --> 0:05:47,000
audience, I'd like to suggest

111
0:05:47.625,000 --> 0:05:51,000
a reality TV show called "Pre-vivor."

112
0:05:51.832,000 --> 0:05:54,000
If you develop a disease, you're off the island.

113
0:05:55.333,000 --> 0:06:,000
But the problem is, we have a system

114
0:06:00.468,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that is completely --

115
0:06:02.34,000 --> 0:06:03,000
basically promoted this.

116
0:06:04.267,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We've selected, at every point in this system,

117
0:06:07.133,000 --> 0:06:1,000
to do what we do, and to give everyone a precondition and then eventually

118
0:06:11.12,000 --> 0:06:12,000
a condition, in some cases.

119
0:06:13.099,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Start with the doctor-patient relationship. Doctors, most of them,

120
0:06:17.592,000 --> 0:06:22,000
are in a fee-for-service system. They are basically incentivized to do more --

121
0:06:22.618,000 --> 0:06:23,000
procedures, tests,

122
0:06:24.275,000 --> 0:06:25,000
prescribe medications.

123
0:06:25.941,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Patients come to them,

124
0:06:27.306,000 --> 0:06:31,000
they want to do something. We're Americans, we can't just stand

125
0:06:31.306,000 --> 0:06:33,000
there, we have to do something. And so they want a drug.

126
0:06:34.187,000 --> 0:06:37,000
They want a treatment. They want to be told, this is what you have and this is how

127
0:06:37.962,000 --> 0:06:39,000
you treat it. If the doctor doesn't give you that,

128
0:06:40.282,000 --> 0:06:41,000
you go somewhere else.

129
0:06:42.106,000 --> 0:06:43,000
That's not very good for doctors' business.

130
0:06:43.986,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Or even worse,

131
0:06:45.674,000 --> 0:06:48,000
if you are diagnosed with something eventually, and the doctor didn't order that test,

132
0:06:49.633,000 --> 0:06:51,000
you get sued.

133
0:06:51.857,000 --> 0:06:54,000
We have pharmaceutical companies that are constantly trying to expand

134
0:06:54.889,000 --> 0:06:59,000
the indications, expand the number of people who are eligible for a given treatment,

135
0:07:00.233,000 --> 0:07:02,000
because that obviously helps their bottom line. We have advocacy groups,

136
0:07:03.026,000 --> 0:07:05,000
like the one that's come up with pre-vivor,

137
0:07:05.281,000 --> 0:07:09,000
who want to make more and more people feel they are at risk, or might have a condition,

138
0:07:09.521,000 --> 0:07:11,000
so that they can raise more funds

139
0:07:11.65,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and raise visibility, et cetera.

140
0:07:14.265,000 --> 0:07:15,000
But this isn't actually,

141
0:07:16.105,000 --> 0:07:19,000
despite what journalists typically do, this isn't actually about blaming

142
0:07:19.201,000 --> 0:07:2,000
particular players.

143
0:07:20.489,000 --> 0:07:21,000
We are all responsible.

144
0:07:22.29,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I'm responsible.

145
0:07:23.732,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I actually root for the Yankees, I mean talk about

146
0:07:26.77,000 --> 0:07:29,000
rooting for the worst possible

147
0:07:29.962,000 --> 0:07:31,000
offender when it comes to doing everything you can do.

148
0:07:32.572,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Thank you.

149
0:07:34.109,000 --> 0:07:37,000
But everyone is responsible.

150
0:07:38.073,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I went to medical school,

151
0:07:40.978,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and I didn't have a course called How to Think Skeptically,

152
0:07:45.73,000 --> 0:07:46,000
or How Not to Order Tests.

153
0:07:47.393,000 --> 0:07:49,000
We have this system

154
0:07:50.044,000 --> 0:07:52,000
where that's what you do.

155
0:07:52.561,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And it actually took being a journalist

156
0:07:55.186,000 --> 0:07:58,000
to understand all these incentives. You know, economists like to say,

157
0:07:59.089,000 --> 0:08:,000
there are no bad people,

158
0:08:00.308,000 --> 0:08:01,000
there are just bad incentives.

159
0:08:02.185,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And that's actually true.

160
0:08:03.793,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Because what we've created is a sort of Field of Dreams, when it comes to medical technology.

161
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So when you put another MRI in every corner, you put a robot

162
0:08:12.56,000 --> 0:08:15,000
in every hospital saying that everyone has to have robotic surgery.

163
0:08:16.098,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Well, we've created a system where if you build it, they will come.

164
0:08:19.914,000 --> 0:08:22,000
But you can actually perversely

165
0:08:23.441,000 --> 0:08:25,000
tell people to come, convince them

166
0:08:26.225,000 --> 0:08:27,000
that they have to come.

167
0:08:27.914,000 --> 0:08:31,000
It was when I became a journalist that I really realized how I was part of this problem,

168
0:08:32.722,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and how we all are part of this problem.

169
0:08:34.746,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I was medicalizing every risk factor, I was writing stories, commissioning stories,

170
0:08:38.402,000 --> 0:08:41,000
every day, that were trying to,

171
0:08:41.795,000 --> 0:08:43,000
not necessarily make people worried, although that was what often happened.

172
0:08:44.792,000 --> 0:08:47,000
But, you know, there are ways out.

173
0:08:47.815,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I saw my own internist last week,

174
0:08:49.687,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and he said to me,

175
0:08:52.219,000 --> 0:08:54,000
"You know," and he told me something that

176
0:08:54.736,000 --> 0:08:56,000
everyone in this audience could have told me for free,

177
0:08:57.21,000 --> 0:08:59,000
but I paid him for the privilege, which is that

178
0:08:59.698,000 --> 0:09:,000
I need to lose some weight.

179
0:09:01.367,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Well, he's right. I've had honest-to-goodness high blood pressure

180
0:09:05.824,000 --> 0:09:06,000
for a dozen years now, same

181
0:09:07.537,000 --> 0:09:08,000
age my father got it,

182
0:09:09.311,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and it's a real disease. It's not pre-hypertension, it's actual

183
0:09:13.098,000 --> 0:09:14,000
hypertension, high blood pressure.

184
0:09:15.071,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Well, he's right,

185
0:09:16.056,000 --> 0:09:19,000
but he didn't say to me,

186
0:09:19.136,000 --> 0:09:2,000
well, you have pre-obesity or

187
0:09:20.823,000 --> 0:09:23,000
you have pre-diabetes, or anything like that. He didn't say,

188
0:09:24.168,000 --> 0:09:27,000
better start taking this Statin, you need to lower your cholesterol.

189
0:09:27.544,000 --> 0:09:3,000
No, he said, "Go out and lose some weight. Come back and see me in a bit,

190
0:09:30.703,000 --> 0:09:32,000
or just give me a call and let me know how you're doing."

191
0:09:32.704,000 --> 0:09:34,000
So that's, to me,

192
0:09:34.744,000 --> 0:09:35,000
a way forward.

193
0:09:36.375,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Billy Beane, by the way, learned the same thing.

194
0:09:38.739,000 --> 0:09:39,000
He learned,

195
0:09:40.275,000 --> 0:09:43,000
from watching this kid who he eventually hired, who was really successful for him,

196
0:09:43.792,000 --> 0:09:47,000
that it wasn't swinging for the fences, it wasn't swinging at every pitch

197
0:09:48.667,000 --> 0:09:52,000
like the sluggers do, which is what all the expensive teams like the Yankees like to --

198
0:09:53.436,000 --> 0:09:54,000
they like to pick up those guys.

199
0:09:54.776,000 --> 0:09:58,000
This kid told him, you know, you gotta watch the guys, and you gotta go out and find

200
0:09:59.365,000 --> 0:10:,000
the guys who like to walk,

201
0:10:00.604,000 --> 0:10:01,000
because getting on base by a walk

202
0:10:02.308,000 --> 0:10:04,000
is just as good, and in our healthcare system

203
0:10:05.076,000 --> 0:10:06,000
we need to figure out,

204
0:10:06.516,000 --> 0:10:07,000
is that really a good pitch

205
0:10:08.092,000 --> 0:10:1,000
or should we let it go by and not swing at everything?

206
0:10:11.01,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Thanks.

1
0:00:13.48,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm a textile artist

2
0:00:15.08,000 --> 0:00:17,000
most widely known for starting the yarn bombing movement.

3
0:00:18.08,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Yarn bombing is when you take knitted or crocheted material

4
0:00:21.04,000 --> 0:00:23,000
out into the urban environment, graffiti-style --

5
0:00:23.4,000 --> 0:00:24,000
or, more specifically,

6
0:00:24.64,000 --> 0:00:26,000
without permission and unsanctioned.

7
0:00:26.96,000 --> 0:00:28,000
But when I started this over 10 years ago,

8
0:00:29.84,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I didn't have a word for it,

9
0:00:31.4,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I didn't have any ambitious notions about it,

10
0:00:33.56,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I had no visions of grandeur.

11
0:00:35.12,000 --> 0:00:39,000
All I wanted to see was something warm and fuzzy and human-like

12
0:00:39.52,000 --> 0:00:42,000
on the cold, steel, gray facade that I looked at everyday.

13
0:00:43.32,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So I wrapped the door handle.

14
0:00:45.56,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I call this the Alpha Piece.

15
0:00:47.96,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Little did I know that this tiny piece would change the course of my life.

16
0:00:52.04,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So clearly the reaction was interesting.

17
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It intrigued me and I thought, "What else could I do?"

18
0:00:56.548,000 --> 0:01:,000
Could I do something in the public domain that would get the same reaction?

19
0:01:00.76,000 --> 0:01:02,000
So I wrapped the stop sign pole near my house.

20
0:01:03.88,000 --> 0:01:04,000
The reaction was wild.

21
0:01:05.32,000 --> 0:01:07,000
People would park their cars

22
0:01:07.4,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and get out of their cars and stare at it,

23
0:01:09.8,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and scratch their heads and stare at it,

24
0:01:11.76,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and take pictures of it and take pictures next to it,

25
0:01:14.28,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and all of that was really exciting to me

26
0:01:16.28,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and I wanted to do every stop sign pole in the neighborhood.

27
0:01:19.32,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And the more that I did, the stronger the reaction.

28
0:01:22.8,000 --> 0:01:23,000
So at this point I'm smitten.

29
0:01:24.32,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I'm hooked.

30
0:01:25.6,000 --> 0:01:26,000
This was all seductive.

31
0:01:26.88,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I found my new passion

32
0:01:28.64,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and the urban environment was my playground.

33
0:01:31.76,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So this is some of my early work.

34
0:01:35.04,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I was very curious about this idea of enhancing the ordinary,

35
0:01:38.08,000 --> 0:01:39,000
the mundane, even the ugly,

36
0:01:39.84,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and not taking away its identity or its functionality

37
0:01:43.52,000 --> 0:01:46,000
but just giving it a well-tailored suit out of knitting.

38
0:01:46.92,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And this was fun for me.

39
0:01:48.68,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It was really fun to take inanimate objects

40
0:01:50.96,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and have them come to life.

41
0:01:53.44,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So ...

42
0:01:54.88,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I think we all see the humor in this,

43
0:01:56.76,000 --> 0:01:57,000
but --

44
0:01:58,000 --> 0:01:59,000
(Laughter)

45
0:01:59.12,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I was at a point where I wanted to take it seriously.

46
0:02:01.84,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I wanted to analyze it.

47
0:02:03.12,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I wanted to know why I was letting this take over my life,

48
0:02:05.88,000 --> 0:02:06,000
why I was passionate about it,

49
0:02:07.36,000 --> 0:02:09,000
why were other people reacting so strongly to it.

50
0:02:09.92,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And I realized something.

51
0:02:11.8,000 --> 0:02:13,000
We all live in this fast-paced, digital world,

52
0:02:14.72,000 --> 0:02:17,000
but we still crave and desire something that's relatable.

53
0:02:18.68,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I think we've all become desensitized

54
0:02:21.44,000 --> 0:02:23,000
by our overdeveloped cities that we live in,

55
0:02:24.04,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and billboards and advertisements,

56
0:02:26.84,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and giant parking lots,

57
0:02:28.48,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and we don't even complain about that stuff anymore.

58
0:02:31.36,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So when you stumble upon

59
0:02:32.64,000 --> 0:02:34,000
a stop sign pole that's wrapped in knitting

60
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and it seems so out of place

61
0:02:36.72,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and then gradually -- weirdly --

62
0:02:38.6,000 --> 0:02:39,000
you find a connection to it,

63
0:02:40.44,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that is the moment.

64
0:02:41.68,000 --> 0:02:42,000
That is the moment I love

65
0:02:42.92,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and that is the moment I love to share with others.

66
0:02:46.28,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So at this point, my curiosity grew.

67
0:02:49.44,000 --> 0:02:51,000
It went from the fire hydrants and the stop sign poles

68
0:02:52.24,000 --> 0:02:53,000
to what else can I do with this material.

69
0:02:54.217,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Can I do something big and large-scale and insurmountable?

70
0:02:58.24,000 --> 0:03:,000
So that's when the bus happened.

71
0:03:03.24,000 --> 0:03:05,000
This was a real game changer for me.

72
0:03:05.28,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for this one.

73
0:03:08.12,000 --> 0:03:1,000
At this point, people were recognizing my work

74
0:03:10.32,000 --> 0:03:11,000
but there wasn't much out there

75
0:03:11.84,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that was wrapped in knitting that was large-scale,

76
0:03:14.24,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and this definitely was the first city bus to be wrapped in knitting.

77
0:03:17.52,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So at this point, I'm experiencing,

78
0:03:19.28,000 --> 0:03:21,000
or I'm witnessing something interesting.

79
0:03:21.36,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I may have started yarn bombing but I certainly don't own it anymore.

80
0:03:24.8,000 --> 0:03:25,000
It had reached global status.

81
0:03:26.36,000 --> 0:03:28,000
People from all over the world were doing this.

82
0:03:28.575,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And I know this because I would travel to certain parts of the world

83
0:03:31.79,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that I'd never been to,

84
0:03:32.981,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and I'd stumble upon a stop sign pole and I knew I didn't wrap it.

85
0:03:36.139,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So as I pursued my own goals with my art --

86
0:03:40.28,000 --> 0:03:41,000
this is a lot of my recent work --

87
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
so was yarn bombing.

88
0:03:44.4,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Yarn bombing was also growing.

89
0:03:45.88,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And that experience showed me the hidden power of this craft

90
0:03:50.24,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and showed me

91
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:55,000
that there was this common language I had with the rest of the world.

92
0:03:57.36,000 --> 0:03:59,000
It was through this granny hobby --

93
0:03:59.64,000 --> 0:04:01,000
this unassuming hobby --

94
0:04:01.8,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that I found commonality with people

95
0:04:04.72,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that I never thought I'd have a connection with.

96
0:04:08.28,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So as I tell my story today,

97
0:04:10.92,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I'd also like to convey to you

98
0:04:12.4,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that hidden power can be found in the most unassuming places,

99
0:04:15.84,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and we all possess skills that are just waiting to be discovered.

100
0:04:19.6,000 --> 0:04:22,000
If you think about our hands, these tools that are connected to us,

101
0:04:22.8,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and what they're capable of doing --

102
0:04:25.2,000 --> 0:04:26,000
building houses and furniture,

103
0:04:26.88,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and painting giant murals --

104
0:04:28.48,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and most of the time we hold a controller or a cell phone.

105
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And I'm totally guilty of this as well.

106
0:04:34.76,000 --> 0:04:35,000
But if you think about it,

107
0:04:36.08,000 --> 0:04:38,000
what would happen if you put those things down?

108
0:04:38.32,000 --> 0:04:4,000
What would you make? What would you create with your own hands?

109
0:04:42.04,000 --> 0:04:44,000
A lot of people think that I am a master knitter

110
0:04:44.36,000 --> 0:04:47,000
but I actually couldn't knit a sweater to save my life.

111
0:04:47.44,000 --> 0:04:49,000
But I did something interesting with knitting

112
0:04:49.6,000 --> 0:04:5,000
that had never been done before.

113
0:04:51.44,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I also wasn't "supposed to be" an artist

114
0:04:53.92,000 --> 0:04:56,000
in the sense that I wasn't formally trained to do this --

115
0:04:57.36,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I'm a math major actually.

116
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So I didn't think this was in the cards for me,

117
0:05:01.88,000 --> 0:05:03,000
but I also know that I didn't stumble upon this.

118
0:05:04.84,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And when this happened to me, I held on tight,

119
0:05:07.32,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I fought for it and I'm proud to say that I am a working artist today.

120
0:05:12.04,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So as we ponder the future,

121
0:05:15.28,000 --> 0:05:17,000
know that your future might not be so seamless.

122
0:05:17.495,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And one day, you might be as bored as I was

123
0:05:20.52,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and knit a door handle to change your world forever.

124
0:05:23.92,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Thank you.

125
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
(Applause)

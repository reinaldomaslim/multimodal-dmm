1
0:00:12,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I grew up in a very small country town

2
0:00:14.463,000 --> 0:00:15,000
in Victoria.

3
0:00:15.763,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I had a very normal, low-key kind of upbringing.

4
0:00:20.18,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I went to school, I hung out with my friends,

5
0:00:23.58,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I fought with my younger sisters.

6
0:00:25.966,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It was all very normal.

7
0:00:27.755,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And when I was 15, a member of my local community

8
0:00:31.927,000 --> 0:00:32,000
approached my parents

9
0:00:33.347,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and wanted to nominate me

10
0:00:34.74,000 --> 0:00:37,000
for a community achievement award.

11
0:00:37.86,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And my parents said, "Hm, that's really nice,

12
0:00:41.103,000 --> 0:00:44,000
but there's kind of one glaring problem with that.

13
0:00:44.32,000 --> 0:00:48,000
She hasn't actually achieved anything." (Laughter)

14
0:00:49.254,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And they were right, you know.

15
0:00:50.849,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I went to school, I got good marks,

16
0:00:53.835,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I had a very low-key after school job

17
0:00:56.283,000 --> 0:00:57,000
in my mum's hairdressing salon,

18
0:00:58.065,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and I spent a lot of time watching

19
0:00:59.863,000 --> 0:01:02,000
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Dawson's Creek."

20
0:01:02.994,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Yeah, I know. What a contradiction.

21
0:01:07.037,000 --> 0:01:08,000
But they were right, you know.

22
0:01:08.377,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I wasn't doing anything that was out of the ordinary

23
0:01:10.93,000 --> 0:01:11,000
at all.

24
0:01:12.611,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I wasn't doing anything that could be considered an achievement

25
0:01:15.554,000 --> 0:01:18,000
if you took disability out of the equation.

26
0:01:19.156,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Years later, I was on my second teaching round

27
0:01:23.022,000 --> 0:01:24,000
in a Melbourne high school,

28
0:01:24.758,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and I was about 20 minutes into a year 11 legal studies class

29
0:01:29.709,000 --> 0:01:3,000
when this boy put up his hand and said,

30
0:01:31.488,000 --> 0:01:35,000
"Hey miss, when are you going to start doing your speech?"

31
0:01:35.732,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And I said, "What speech?"

32
0:01:37.709,000 --> 0:01:38,000
You know, I'd been talking them

33
0:01:39.013,000 --> 0:01:41,000
about defamation law for a good 20 minutes.

34
0:01:41.909,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And he said, "You know, like,

35
0:01:43.58,000 --> 0:01:45,000
your motivational speaking.

36
0:01:45.9,000 --> 0:01:46,000
You know, when people in wheelchairs come to school,

37
0:01:47.89,000 --> 0:01:51,000
they usually say, like, inspirational stuff?"

38
0:01:52.813,000 --> 0:01:53,000
(Laughter)

39
0:01:54.259,000 --> 0:01:58,000
"It's usually in the big hall."

40
0:01:58.557,000 --> 0:02:,000
And that's when it dawned on me:

41
0:02:00.77,000 --> 0:02:03,000
This kid had only ever experienced disabled people

42
0:02:04.041,000 --> 0:02:07,000
as objects of inspiration.

43
0:02:07.699,000 --> 0:02:08,000
We are not, to this kid --

44
0:02:09.56,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and it's not his fault, I mean,

45
0:02:10.861,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that's true for many of us.

46
0:02:12.672,000 --> 0:02:15,000
For lots of us, disabled people are not our teachers

47
0:02:16.418,000 --> 0:02:19,000
or our doctors or our manicurists.

48
0:02:19.477,000 --> 0:02:24,000
We're not real people. We are there to inspire.

49
0:02:24.846,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And in fact, I am sitting on this stage

50
0:02:28.352,000 --> 0:02:31,000
looking like I do in this wheelchair,

51
0:02:31.434,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and you are probably kind of expecting me

52
0:02:34.367,000 --> 0:02:38,000
to inspire you. Right? (Laughter)

53
0:02:39.147,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Yeah.

54
0:02:41.99,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid

55
0:02:44.004,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I'm going to disappoint you dramatically.

56
0:02:46.861,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I am not here to inspire you.

57
0:02:49.03,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I am here to tell you that we have been lied to

58
0:02:51.607,000 --> 0:02:52,000
about disability.

59
0:02:53.574,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Yeah, we've been sold the lie

60
0:02:55.681,000 --> 0:03:,000
that disability is a Bad Thing, capital B, capital T.

61
0:03:00.886,000 --> 0:03:02,000
It's a bad thing, and to live with a disability

62
0:03:03.827,000 --> 0:03:05,000
makes you exceptional.

63
0:03:05.973,000 --> 0:03:07,000
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't

64
0:03:08.888,000 --> 0:03:1,000
make you exceptional.

65
0:03:11.517,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And in the past few years, we've been able

66
0:03:13.252,000 --> 0:03:15,000
to propagate this lie even further

67
0:03:15.875,000 --> 0:03:17,000
via social media.

68
0:03:18.149,000 --> 0:03:2,000
You may have seen images like this one:

69
0:03:20.382,000 --> 0:03:23,000
"The only disability in life is a bad attitude."

70
0:03:24.975,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Or this one: "Your excuse is invalid." Indeed.

71
0:03:29.326,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Or this one: "Before you quit, try!"

72
0:03:35.686,000 --> 0:03:36,000
These are just a couple of examples,

73
0:03:37.342,000 --> 0:03:38,000
but there are a lot of these images out there.

74
0:03:39.311,000 --> 0:03:4,000
You know, you might have seen the one,

75
0:03:40.94,000 --> 0:03:41,000
the little girl with no hands

76
0:03:42.689,000 --> 0:03:45,000
drawing a picture with a pencil held in her mouth.

77
0:03:46.4,000 --> 0:03:47,000
You might have seen a child running

78
0:03:48.12,000 --> 0:03:5,000
on carbon fiber prosthetic legs.

79
0:03:50.993,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And these images,

80
0:03:52.344,000 --> 0:03:53,000
there are lots of them out there,

81
0:03:53.97,000 --> 0:03:56,000
they are what we call inspiration porn.

82
0:03:57.884,000 --> 0:03:59,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:00.11,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And I use the term porn deliberately,

84
0:04:02.328,000 --> 0:04:05,000
because they objectify one group of people

85
0:04:05.477,000 --> 0:04:07,000
for the benefit of another group of people.

86
0:04:08.288,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So in this case, we're objectifying disabled people

87
0:04:11.167,000 --> 0:04:13,000
for the benefit of nondisabled people.

88
0:04:13.824,000 --> 0:04:15,000
The purpose of these images

89
0:04:15.952,000 --> 0:04:18,000
is to inspire you, to motivate you,

90
0:04:19.763,000 --> 0:04:21,000
so that we can look at them

91
0:04:21.838,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and think, "Well, however bad my life is,

92
0:04:24.927,000 --> 0:04:26,000
it could be worse.

93
0:04:26.958,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I could be that person."

94
0:04:30.286,000 --> 0:04:33,000
But what if you are that person?

95
0:04:33.662,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I've lost count of the number of times that I've

96
0:04:35.75,000 --> 0:04:37,000
been approached by strangers

97
0:04:38.218,000 --> 0:04:4,000
wanting to tell me that they think I'm brave

98
0:04:41.123,000 --> 0:04:42,000
or inspirational,

99
0:04:42.88,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and this was long before my work

100
0:04:44.539,000 --> 0:04:46,000
had any kind of public profile.

101
0:04:46.593,000 --> 0:04:47,000
They were just kind of congratulating me

102
0:04:48.295,000 --> 0:04:49,000
for managing to get up in the morning

103
0:04:50.001,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and remember my own name. (Laughter)

104
0:04:54.009,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And it is objectifying.

105
0:04:56.547,000 --> 0:04:58,000
These images, those images

106
0:04:58.64,000 --> 0:04:59,000
objectify disabled people

107
0:05:00.571,000 --> 0:05:02,000
for the benefit of nondisabled people.

108
0:05:03.496,000 --> 0:05:05,000
They are there so that you can look at them

109
0:05:06.11,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and think that things aren't so bad for you,

110
0:05:08.813,000 --> 0:05:12,000
to put your worries into perspective.

111
0:05:12.96,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And life as a disabled person

112
0:05:15.881,000 --> 0:05:17,000
is actually somewhat difficult.

113
0:05:17.965,000 --> 0:05:19,000
We do overcome some things.

114
0:05:20.071,000 --> 0:05:22,000
But the things that we're overcoming

115
0:05:22.283,000 --> 0:05:24,000
are not the things that you think they are.

116
0:05:24.9,000 --> 0:05:26,000
They are not things to do with our bodies.

117
0:05:27.507,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I use the term "disabled people" quite deliberately,

118
0:05:29.885,000 --> 0:05:33,000
because I subscribe to what's called the social model of disability,

119
0:05:34.083,000 --> 0:05:36,000
which tells us that we are more disabled

120
0:05:36.381,000 --> 0:05:39,000
by the society that we live in

121
0:05:40.295,000 --> 0:05:42,000
than by our bodies and our diagnoses.

122
0:05:43.178,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So I have lived in this body a long time.

123
0:05:47.086,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I'm quite fond of it.

124
0:05:49.349,000 --> 0:05:52,000
It does the things that I need it to do,

125
0:05:52.402,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and I've learned to use it to the best of its capacity

126
0:05:55.695,000 --> 0:05:56,000
just as you have,

127
0:05:56.829,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and that's the thing about those kids in those pictures as well.

128
0:05:59.853,000 --> 0:06:02,000
They're not doing anything out of the ordinary.

129
0:06:03.132,000 --> 0:06:05,000
They are just using their bodies

130
0:06:05.481,000 --> 0:06:07,000
to the best of their capacity.

131
0:06:07.79,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So is it really fair to objectify them

132
0:06:11.293,000 --> 0:06:12,000
in the way that we do,

133
0:06:13.016,000 --> 0:06:15,000
to share those images?

134
0:06:15.118,000 --> 0:06:19,000
People, when they say, "You're an inspiration,"

135
0:06:19.641,000 --> 0:06:22,000
they mean it as a compliment.

136
0:06:22.926,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And I know why it happens.

137
0:06:24.292,000 --> 0:06:26,000
It's because of the lie, it's because we've been sold

138
0:06:26.564,000 --> 0:06:3,000
this lie that disability makes you exceptional.

139
0:06:30.778,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And it honestly doesn't.

140
0:06:32.612,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And I know what you're thinking.

141
0:06:33.971,000 --> 0:06:35,000
You know, I'm up here bagging out inspiration,

142
0:06:36.72,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and you're thinking, "Jeez, Stella,

143
0:06:38.639,000 --> 0:06:42,000
aren't you inspired sometimes by some things?"

144
0:06:42.756,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And the thing is, I am.

145
0:06:44.85,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I learn from other disabled people all the time.

146
0:06:47.888,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I'm learning not that I am luckier than them, though.

147
0:06:52.827,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I am learning that it's a genius idea

148
0:06:55.982,000 --> 0:06:56,000
to use a pair of barbecue tongs

149
0:06:57.403,000 --> 0:07:02,000
to pick up things that you dropped. (Laughter)

150
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I'm learning that nifty trick where you can charge

151
0:07:05.681,000 --> 0:07:09,000
your mobile phone battery from your chair battery.

152
0:07:10.266,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Genius.

153
0:07:11.48,000 --> 0:07:13,000
We are learning from each others' strength and endurance,

154
0:07:14.061,000 --> 0:07:16,000
not against our bodies and our diagnoses,

155
0:07:16.702,000 --> 0:07:18,000
but against a world that exceptionalizes

156
0:07:19.506,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and objectifies us.

157
0:07:21.963,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I really think that this lie that we've been sold

158
0:07:24.598,000 --> 0:07:28,000
about disability is the greatest injustice.

159
0:07:28.821,000 --> 0:07:32,000
It makes life hard for us.

160
0:07:32.956,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And that quote, "The only disability in life

161
0:07:36.829,000 --> 0:07:37,000
is a bad attitude,"

162
0:07:38.827,000 --> 0:07:41,000
the reason that that's bullshit

163
0:07:41.954,000 --> 0:07:42,000
is because it's just not true,

164
0:07:43.575,000 --> 0:07:45,000
because of the social model of disability.

165
0:07:46.237,000 --> 0:07:5,000
No amount of smiling at a flight of stairs

166
0:07:50.402,000 --> 0:07:54,000
has ever made it turn into a ramp.

167
0:07:55.348,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Never. (Laughter) (Applause)

168
0:08:01.93,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Smiling at a television screen

169
0:08:03.81,000 --> 0:08:04,000
isn't going to make closed captions appear

170
0:08:05.641,000 --> 0:08:06,000
for people who are deaf.

171
0:08:07.374,000 --> 0:08:09,000
No amount of standing in the middle of a bookshop

172
0:08:09.836,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and radiating a positive attitude

173
0:08:11.606,000 --> 0:08:13,000
is going to turn all those books into braille.

174
0:08:14.305,000 --> 0:08:18,000
It's just not going to happen.

175
0:08:18.509,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I really want to live in a world

176
0:08:21.236,000 --> 0:08:24,000
where disability is not the exception, but the norm.

177
0:08:24.9,000 --> 0:08:26,000
I want to live in a world where a 15-year-old girl

178
0:08:27.096,000 --> 0:08:28,000
sitting in her bedroom

179
0:08:28.83,000 --> 0:08:3,000
watching "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"

180
0:08:31.007,000 --> 0:08:33,000
isn't referred to as achieving anything

181
0:08:33.545,000 --> 0:08:35,000
because she's doing it sitting down.

182
0:08:35.811,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I want to live in a world

183
0:08:37.236,000 --> 0:08:4,000
where we don't have such low expectations

184
0:08:40.361,000 --> 0:08:41,000
of disabled people

185
0:08:41.91,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that we are congratulated for getting out of bed

186
0:08:44.236,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and remembering our own names in the morning.

187
0:08:47.033,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I want to live in a world where we value genuine achievement

188
0:08:50.454,000 --> 0:08:51,000
for disabled people,

189
0:08:52.217,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and I want to live in a world

190
0:08:53.824,000 --> 0:08:56,000
where a kid in year 11 in a Melbourne high school

191
0:08:57.236,000 --> 0:08:59,000
is not one bit surprised

192
0:08:59.589,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that his new teacher is a wheelchair user.

193
0:09:02.747,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Disability doesn't make you exceptional,

194
0:09:05.79,000 --> 0:09:08,000
but questioning what you think you know about it does.

195
0:09:09.243,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Thank you.

196
0:09:10.51,000 --> 0:09:1,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:15.838,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm a brain scientist, and as a brain scientist,

3
0:00:18.935,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I'm actually interested in how the brain learns,

4
0:00:22.007,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and I'm especially interested in a possibility of

5
0:00:25.374,000 --> 0:00:29,000
making our brains smarter, better and faster.

6
0:00:30.106,000 --> 0:00:32,000
This is in this context I'm going to tell you

7
0:00:32.982,000 --> 0:00:34,000
about video games. When we say video games,

8
0:00:35.732,000 --> 0:00:37,000
most of you think about children.

9
0:00:38.27,000 --> 0:00:41,000
It's true. Ninety percent of children do play video games.

10
0:00:42.248,000 --> 0:00:44,000
But let's be frank.

11
0:00:45.166,000 --> 0:00:49,000
When the kids are in bed, who is in front of the PlayStation?

12
0:00:49.955,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Most of you. The average age of a gamer is 33 years old,

13
0:00:56.439,000 --> 0:00:59,000
not eight years old, and in fact, if we look

14
0:00:59.446,000 --> 0:01:02,000
at the projected demographics of video game play,

15
0:01:03.155,000 --> 0:01:05,000
the video game players of tomorrow are

16
0:01:05.888,000 --> 0:01:08,000
older adults. (Laughter)

17
0:01:09.012,000 --> 0:01:13,000
So video [gaming] is pervasive throughout our society.

18
0:01:13.263,000 --> 0:01:17,000
It is clearly here to stay. It has an amazing impact

19
0:01:17.646,000 --> 0:01:2,000
on our everyday life. Consider these statistics

20
0:01:21.033,000 --> 0:01:26,000
released by Activision. After one month of release

21
0:01:26.848,000 --> 0:01:3,000
of the game "Call Of Duty: Black Ops," it had been played

22
0:01:31.34,000 --> 0:01:34,000
for 68,000 years

23
0:01:34.713,000 --> 0:01:35,000
worldwide, right?

24
0:01:36.579,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Would any of you complain if this was the case

25
0:01:39.526,000 --> 0:01:42,000
about doing linear algebra?

26
0:01:42.689,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So what we are asking in the lab is, how can we leverage that power?

27
0:01:46.984,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Now I want to step back a bit.

28
0:01:48.832,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I know most of you have had the experience of coming back

29
0:01:52.073,000 --> 0:01:56,000
home and finding your kids playing these kinds of games.

30
0:01:56.793,000 --> 0:01:58,000
(Shooting noises) The name of the game is to get

31
0:01:58.933,000 --> 0:02:,000
after your enemy zombie bad guys

32
0:02:01.897,000 --> 0:02:04,000
before they get to you, right?

33
0:02:05.487,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And I'm almost sure most of you have thought,

34
0:02:08.664,000 --> 0:02:11,000
"Oh, come on, can't you do something more intelligent

35
0:02:11.985,000 --> 0:02:14,000
than shooting at zombies?"

36
0:02:15.312,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I'd like you to put this kind of knee-jerk reaction

37
0:02:18.778,000 --> 0:02:2,000
in the context of what you would have thought

38
0:02:21.275,000 --> 0:02:24,000
if you had found your girl playing sudoku

39
0:02:24.784,000 --> 0:02:28,000
or your boy reading Shakespeare. Right?

40
0:02:29.135,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Most parents would find that great.

41
0:02:31.872,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Well, I'm not going to tell you that playing video games

42
0:02:35.216,000 --> 0:02:37,000
days in and days out is actually good for your health.

43
0:02:38.184,000 --> 0:02:41,000
It's not, and binging is never good.

44
0:02:41.384,000 --> 0:02:44,000
But I'm going to argue that in reasonable doses,

45
0:02:45.375,000 --> 0:02:47,000
actually the very game I showed you at the beginning,

46
0:02:48.344,000 --> 0:02:5,000
those action-packed shooter games

47
0:02:50.928,000 --> 0:02:53,000
have quite powerful effects and positive effects

48
0:02:54.704,000 --> 0:02:57,000
on many different aspects of our behavior.

49
0:02:58.562,000 --> 0:03:01,000
There's not one week that goes without some major

50
0:03:02.257,000 --> 0:03:04,000
headlines in the media about whether video games are

51
0:03:05.033,000 --> 0:03:09,000
good or bad for you, right? You're all bombarded with that.

52
0:03:09.649,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I'd like to put this kind of Friday night bar discussion aside

53
0:03:15.337,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and get you to actually step into the lab.

54
0:03:18.48,000 --> 0:03:2,000
What we do in the lab is actually measure directly,

55
0:03:21.353,000 --> 0:03:23,000
in a quantitative fashion, what is the impact

56
0:03:24.12,000 --> 0:03:26,000
of video games on the brain.

57
0:03:26.889,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And so I'm going to take a few examples from our work.

58
0:03:30.224,000 --> 0:03:32,000
One first saying that I'm sure you all have heard

59
0:03:32.823,000 --> 0:03:34,000
is the fact that too much screen time

60
0:03:35.109,000 --> 0:03:37,000
makes your eyesight worse.

61
0:03:37.924,000 --> 0:03:39,000
That's a statement about vision.

62
0:03:40.127,000 --> 0:03:42,000
There may be vision scientists among you.

63
0:03:42.663,000 --> 0:03:44,000
We actually know how to test that statement.

64
0:03:45.602,000 --> 0:03:48,000
We can step into the lab and measure how good your vision is.

65
0:03:49.039,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Well, guess what? People that don't play a lot

66
0:03:52.72,000 --> 0:03:54,000
of action games, that don't actually spend a lot of time

67
0:03:55.71,000 --> 0:03:58,000
in front of screens, have normal, or what we call

68
0:03:59.242,000 --> 0:04:01,000
corrective-to-normal vision. That's okay.

69
0:04:01.896,000 --> 0:04:03,000
The issue is what happens with these guys that actually

70
0:04:04.345,000 --> 0:04:07,000
indulge into playing video games like five hours per week,

71
0:04:07.625,000 --> 0:04:08,000
10 hours per week, 15 hours per week.

72
0:04:09.5,000 --> 0:04:12,000
By that statement, their vision should be really bad, right?

73
0:04:12.728,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Guess what? Their vision is really, really good.

74
0:04:15.425,000 --> 0:04:17,000
It's better than those that don't play.

75
0:04:17.865,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And it's better in two different ways.

76
0:04:20.137,000 --> 0:04:22,000
The first way is that they're actually able to resolve

77
0:04:22.562,000 --> 0:04:25,000
small detail in the context of clutter, and though that means

78
0:04:25.817,000 --> 0:04:28,000
being able to read the fine print on a prescription

79
0:04:29.615,000 --> 0:04:33,000
rather than using magnifier glasses, you can actually do it

80
0:04:34.242,000 --> 0:04:35,000
with just your eyesight.

81
0:04:35.808,000 --> 0:04:37,000
The other way that they are better is actually being able

82
0:04:38.624,000 --> 0:04:4,000
to resolve different levels of gray.

83
0:04:41.533,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Imagine you're driving in a fog. That makes a difference

84
0:04:44.704,000 --> 0:04:46,000
between seeing the car in front of you

85
0:04:47.185,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and avoiding the accident, or getting into an accident.

86
0:04:50.928,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So we're actually leveraging that work to develop games

87
0:04:53.944,000 --> 0:04:57,000
for patients with low vision, and to have an impact

88
0:04:58.418,000 --> 0:05:01,000
on retraining their brain to see better.

89
0:05:01.753,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Clearly, when it comes to action video games,

90
0:05:05.402,000 --> 0:05:07,000
screen time doesn't make your eyesight worse.

91
0:05:08.297,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Another saying that I'm sure you have all heard around:

92
0:05:12.283,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Video games lead to attention problems and greater distractability.

93
0:05:16.657,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Okay, we know how to measure attention in the lab.

94
0:05:20.562,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I'm actually going to give you an example of how we do so.

95
0:05:24.163,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I'm going to ask you to participate, so you're going to have

96
0:05:26.888,000 --> 0:05:29,000
to actually play the game with me. I'm going to show you

97
0:05:29.912,000 --> 0:05:34,000
colored words. I want you to shout out the color of the ink.

98
0:05:35.345,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Right? So this is the first example.

99
0:05:38.728,000 --> 0:05:39,000
["Chair"]

100
0:05:39.818,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Orange, good. ["Table"] Green.

101
0:05:42.879,000 --> 0:05:43,000
["Board"] Audience: Red.Daphne Bavelier: Red.

102
0:05:44.259,000 --> 0:05:45,000
["Horse"] DB: Yellow. Audience: Yellow.

103
0:05:45.553,000 --> 0:05:46,000
["Yellow"] DB: Red. Audience: Yellow.

104
0:05:46.878,000 --> 0:05:47,000
["Blue"] DB: Yellow.

105
0:05:48.387,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Okay, you get my point, right? (Laughter)

106
0:05:54.742,000 --> 0:05:57,000
You're getting better, but it's hard. Why is it hard?

107
0:05:58.078,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Because I introduced a conflict between

108
0:06:02.032,000 --> 0:06:04,000
the word itself and its color.

109
0:06:04.945,000 --> 0:06:07,000
How good your attention is determines actually how fast

110
0:06:07.984,000 --> 0:06:09,000
you resolve that conflict, so the young guys here

111
0:06:10.511,000 --> 0:06:12,000
at the top of their game probably, like, did a little better

112
0:06:13.072,000 --> 0:06:15,000
than some of us that are older.

113
0:06:15.616,000 --> 0:06:17,000
What we can show is that when you do this kind of task

114
0:06:18.184,000 --> 0:06:19,000
with people that play a lot of action games,

115
0:06:19.784,000 --> 0:06:22,000
they actually resolve the conflict faster.

116
0:06:23.104,000 --> 0:06:26,000
So clearly playing those action games doesn't lead

117
0:06:26.312,000 --> 0:06:28,000
to attention problems.

118
0:06:28.795,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Actually, those action video game players have

119
0:06:30.766,000 --> 0:06:32,000
many other advantages in terms of attention, and one

120
0:06:33.083,000 --> 0:06:35,000
aspect of attention which is also improved for the better

121
0:06:35.982,000 --> 0:06:39,000
is our ability to track objects around in the world.

122
0:06:40.76,000 --> 0:06:42,000
This is something we use all the time. When you're driving,

123
0:06:43.304,000 --> 0:06:46,000
you're tracking, keeping track of the cars around you.

124
0:06:46.552,000 --> 0:06:49,000
You're also keeping track of the pedestrian, the running dog,

125
0:06:49.627,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and that's how you can actually be safe driving, right?

126
0:06:52.68,000 --> 0:06:55,000
In the lab, we get people to come to the lab,

127
0:06:55.744,000 --> 0:06:57,000
sit in front of a computer screen, and we give them

128
0:06:57.824,000 --> 0:06:59,000
little tasks that I'm going to get you to do again.

129
0:07:00.72,000 --> 0:07:02,000
You're going to see yellow happy faces

130
0:07:03.672,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and a few sad blue faces. These are children

131
0:07:07.488,000 --> 0:07:1,000
in the schoolyard in Geneva during a recess

132
0:07:11.308,000 --> 0:07:15,000
during the winter. Most kids are happy. It's actually recess.

133
0:07:15.609,000 --> 0:07:18,000
But a few kids are sad and blue because they've forgotten their coat.

134
0:07:18.736,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Everybody begins to move around, and your task

135
0:07:22.056,000 --> 0:07:25,000
is to keep track of who had a coat at the beginning

136
0:07:25.18,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and who didn't. So I'm just going to show you an example

137
0:07:27.671,000 --> 0:07:29,000
where there is only one sad kid. It's easy because you can

138
0:07:30.5,000 --> 0:07:32,000
actually track it with your eyes. You can track,

139
0:07:32.837,000 --> 0:07:34,000
you can track, and then when it stops, and there is

140
0:07:35.117,000 --> 0:07:38,000
a question mark, and I ask you, did this kid have a coat or not?

141
0:07:39.048,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Was it yellow initially or blue?

142
0:07:41.876,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I hear a few yellow. Good. So most of you have a brain. (Laughter)

143
0:07:45.673,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I'm now going to ask you to do the task, but now with

144
0:07:50.469,000 --> 0:07:52,000
a little more challenging task. There are going to be

145
0:07:52.557,000 --> 0:07:55,000
three of them that are blue. Don't move your eyes.

146
0:07:55.74,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Please don't move your eyes. Keep your eyes fixated

147
0:07:57.993,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and expand, pull your attention. That's the only way

148
0:08:00.639,000 --> 0:08:02,000
you can actually do it. If you move your eyes, you're doomed.

149
0:08:03.487,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Yellow or blue?

150
0:08:04.95,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Audience: Yellow.DB: Good.

151
0:08:06.596,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So your typical normal young adult

152
0:08:09.099,000 --> 0:08:12,000
can have a span of about three or four objects of attention.

153
0:08:12.735,000 --> 0:08:14,000
That's what we just did. Your action video game player

154
0:08:15.495,000 --> 0:08:18,000
has a span of about six to seven objects of attention,

155
0:08:18.695,000 --> 0:08:2,000
which is what is shown in this video here.

156
0:08:21.673,000 --> 0:08:24,000
That's for you guys, action video game players.

157
0:08:25.149,000 --> 0:08:26,000
A bit more challenging, right? (Laughter)

158
0:08:27.034,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Yellow or blue? Blue. We have some people

159
0:08:30.742,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that are serious out there. Yeah. (Laughter)

160
0:08:33.946,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Good. So in the same way that we actually see

161
0:08:37.55,000 --> 0:08:4,000
the effects of video games on people's behavior,

162
0:08:41.028,000 --> 0:08:44,000
we can use brain imaging and look at the impact

163
0:08:44.093,000 --> 0:08:47,000
of video games on the brain, and we do find many changes,

164
0:08:47.878,000 --> 0:08:5,000
but the main changes are actually to the brain networks

165
0:08:51.238,000 --> 0:08:55,000
that control attention. So one part is the parietal cortex

166
0:08:55.782,000 --> 0:08:58,000
which is very well known to control the orientation of attention.

167
0:08:59.501,000 --> 0:09:01,000
The other one is the frontal lobe, which controls

168
0:09:01.934,000 --> 0:09:03,000
how we sustain attention, and another one

169
0:09:04.644,000 --> 0:09:06,000
is the anterior cingulate, which controls how we allocate

170
0:09:07.213,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and regulate attention and resolve conflict.

171
0:09:10.51,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Now, when we do brain imaging, we find that all three

172
0:09:13.374,000 --> 0:09:16,000
of these networks are actually much more efficient

173
0:09:16.718,000 --> 0:09:18,000
in people that play action games.

174
0:09:19.478,000 --> 0:09:23,000
This actually leads me to a rather counterintuitive finding

175
0:09:24.229,000 --> 0:09:27,000
in the literature about technology and the brain.

176
0:09:27.67,000 --> 0:09:31,000
You all know about multitasking. You all have been faulty

177
0:09:32.119,000 --> 0:09:34,000
of multitasking when you're driving

178
0:09:34.329,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and you pick up your cellphone. Bad idea. Very bad idea.

179
0:09:39.02,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Why? Because as your attention shifts to your cell phone,

180
0:09:42.923,000 --> 0:09:46,000
you are actually losing the capacity to react swiftly

181
0:09:47.071,000 --> 0:09:49,000
to the car braking in front of you, and so you're

182
0:09:49.519,000 --> 0:09:54,000
much more likely to get engaged into a car accident.

183
0:09:55.09,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Now, we can measure that kind of skills in the lab.

184
0:09:57.966,000 --> 0:09:59,000
We obviously don't ask people to drive around and see

185
0:10:00.438,000 --> 0:10:02,000
how many car accidents they have. That would be a little

186
0:10:02.783,000 --> 0:10:05,000
costly proposition. But we design tasks on the computer

187
0:10:06.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
where we can measure, to millisecond accuracy,

188
0:10:09.448,000 --> 0:10:13,000
how good they are at switching from one task to another.

189
0:10:13.976,000 --> 0:10:15,000
When we do that, we actually find that people

190
0:10:16.544,000 --> 0:10:19,000
that play a lot of action games are really, really good.

191
0:10:19.628,000 --> 0:10:23,000
They switch really fast, very swiftly. They pay a very small cost.

192
0:10:24.111,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Now I'd like you to remember that result, and put it

193
0:10:26.769,000 --> 0:10:29,000
in the context of another group of technology users,

194
0:10:30.501,000 --> 0:10:32,000
a group which is actually much revered by society,

195
0:10:32.911,000 --> 0:10:36,000
which are people that engage in multimedia-tasking.

196
0:10:37.45,000 --> 0:10:4,000
What is multimedia-tasking? It's the fact that most of us,

197
0:10:41.095,000 --> 0:10:44,000
most of our children, are engaged with listening to music

198
0:10:44.376,000 --> 0:10:46,000
at the same time as they're doing search on the web

199
0:10:47.123,000 --> 0:10:5,000
at the same time as they're chatting on Facebook with their friends.

200
0:10:50.48,000 --> 0:10:52,000
That's a multimedia-tasker.

201
0:10:52.816,000 --> 0:10:55,000
There was a first study done by colleagues at Stanford

202
0:10:56.376,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and that we replicated that showed that

203
0:10:58.929,000 --> 0:11:02,000
those people that identify as being high multimedia-taskers

204
0:11:03.576,000 --> 0:11:06,000
are absolutely abysmal at multitasking.

205
0:11:07.423,000 --> 0:11:09,000
When we measure them in the lab, they're really bad.

206
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Right? So these kinds of results really

207
0:11:12.866,000 --> 0:11:14,000
makes two main points.

208
0:11:15.352,000 --> 0:11:18,000
The first one is that not all media are created equal.

209
0:11:18.544,000 --> 0:11:22,000
You can't compare the effect of multimedia-tasking

210
0:11:23.456,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and the effect of playing action games. They have

211
0:11:25.102,000 --> 0:11:28,000
totally different effects on different aspects of cognition,

212
0:11:28.494,000 --> 0:11:31,000
perception and attention.

213
0:11:31.608,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Even within video games, I'm telling you right now

214
0:11:34.448,000 --> 0:11:35,000
about these action-packed video games.

215
0:11:36.201,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Different video games have a different effect on your brains.

216
0:11:39.535,000 --> 0:11:41,000
So we actually need to step into the lab and really measure

217
0:11:42.217,000 --> 0:11:44,000
what is the effect of each video game.

218
0:11:44.728,000 --> 0:11:48,000
The other lesson is that general wisdom carries no weight.

219
0:11:49.015,000 --> 0:11:52,000
I showed that to you already, like we looked at the fact that

220
0:11:52.071,000 --> 0:11:54,000
despite a lot of screen time, those action gamers

221
0:11:54.519,000 --> 0:11:58,000
have a lot of very good vision, etc.

222
0:11:58.527,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Here, what was really striking is that these undergraduates

223
0:12:01.845,000 --> 0:12:04,000
that actually report engaging in a lot of high

224
0:12:05.086,000 --> 0:12:09,000
multimedia-tasking are convinced they aced the test.

225
0:12:10.063,000 --> 0:12:12,000
So you show them their data, you show them they are bad

226
0:12:12.353,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and they're like, "Not possible." You know, they have

227
0:12:15.039,000 --> 0:12:18,000
this sort of gut feeling that, really, they are doing really, really good.

228
0:12:18.895,000 --> 0:12:2,000
That's another argument for why we need to step into the lab

229
0:12:21.84,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and really measure the impact of technology on the brain.

230
0:12:25.432,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Now in a sense, when we think about the effect

231
0:12:30.015,000 --> 0:12:32,000
of video games on the brain, it's very similar

232
0:12:32.495,000 --> 0:12:35,000
to the effect of wine on the health.

233
0:12:36.359,000 --> 0:12:39,000
There are some very poor uses of wine. There are some

234
0:12:39.399,000 --> 0:12:43,000
very poor uses of video games. But when consumed

235
0:12:43.615,000 --> 0:12:46,000
in reasonable doses, and at the right age,

236
0:12:47.096,000 --> 0:12:5,000
wine can be very good for health. There are actually

237
0:12:50.367,000 --> 0:12:53,000
specific molecules that have been identified

238
0:12:53.631,000 --> 0:12:58,000
in red wine as leading to greater life expectancy.

239
0:12:59.463,000 --> 0:13:02,000
So it's the same way, like those action video games

240
0:13:02.735,000 --> 0:13:03,000
have a number of ingredients that are actually really

241
0:13:04.397,000 --> 0:13:07,000
powerful for brain plasticity, learning, attention,

242
0:13:08.367,000 --> 0:13:11,000
vision, etc., and so we need and we're working on

243
0:13:11.972,000 --> 0:13:13,000
understanding what are those active ingredients so that

244
0:13:14.727,000 --> 0:13:17,000
we can really then leverage them to deliver better games,

245
0:13:18.617,000 --> 0:13:22,000
either for education or for rehabilitation of patients.

246
0:13:22.86,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Now because we are interested in having an impact

247
0:13:26.639,000 --> 0:13:28,000
for education or rehabilitation of patients, we are actually

248
0:13:29.127,000 --> 0:13:32,000
not that interested in how those of you that choose

249
0:13:32.543,000 --> 0:13:35,000
to play video games for many hours on end perform.

250
0:13:36.415,000 --> 0:13:39,000
I'm much more interested in taking any of you

251
0:13:40.24,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and showing that by forcing you to play an action game,

252
0:13:44.02,000 --> 0:13:46,000
I can actually change your vision for the better,

253
0:13:46.883,000 --> 0:13:48,000
whether you want to play that action game or not, right?

254
0:13:49.214,000 --> 0:13:51,000
That's the point of rehabilitation or education.

255
0:13:51.63,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Most of the kids don't go to school saying,

256
0:13:53.556,000 --> 0:13:55,000
"Great, two hours of math!"

257
0:13:56.296,000 --> 0:14:,000
So that's really the crux of the research, and to do that,

258
0:14:00.735,000 --> 0:14:02,000
we need to go one more step.

259
0:14:03.199,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And one more step is to do training studies.

260
0:14:06.223,000 --> 0:14:09,000
So let me illustrate that step with

261
0:14:09.623,000 --> 0:14:12,000
a task which is called mental rotation.

262
0:14:13.191,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Mental rotation is a task where I'm going to ask you,

263
0:14:17.366,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and again you're going to do the task,

264
0:14:19.251,000 --> 0:14:22,000
to look at this shape. Study it, it's a target shape,

265
0:14:22.936,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and I'm going to present to you four different shapes.

266
0:14:26.19,000 --> 0:14:28,000
One of these four different shapes is actually a rotated

267
0:14:29.03,000 --> 0:14:33,000
version of this shape. I want you to tell me which one:

268
0:14:33.334,000 --> 0:14:37,000
the first one, second one, third one or fourth one?

269
0:14:38.175,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Okay, I'll help you. Fourth one.

270
0:14:40.592,000 --> 0:14:44,000
One more. Get those brains working. Come on.

271
0:14:45.122,000 --> 0:14:49,000
That's our target shape.

272
0:14:50.096,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Third. Good! This is hard, right?

273
0:14:53.799,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Like, the reason that I asked you to do that is because

274
0:14:55.286,000 --> 0:14:57,000
you really feel your brain cringing, right?

275
0:14:58.02,000 --> 0:15:01,000
It doesn't really feel like playing mindless action video games.

276
0:15:01.452,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Well, what we do in these training studies is, people

277
0:15:04.157,000 --> 0:15:06,000
come to the lab, they do tasks like this one,

278
0:15:06.766,000 --> 0:15:1,000
we then force them to play 10 hours of action games.

279
0:15:11.096,000 --> 0:15:13,000
They don't play 10 hours of action games in a row.

280
0:15:13.842,000 --> 0:15:16,000
They do distributed practice, so little shots of 40 minutes

281
0:15:16.952,000 --> 0:15:2,000
several days over a period of two weeks.

282
0:15:21.253,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Then, once they are done with the training, they come back

283
0:15:23.049,000 --> 0:15:26,000
a few days later and they are tested again on a similar type

284
0:15:27.022,000 --> 0:15:3,000
of mental rotation task. So this is work from a colleague

285
0:15:30.638,000 --> 0:15:32,000
in Toronto. What they showed is that, initially,

286
0:15:33.173,000 --> 0:15:35,000
you know, subjects perform where they are expected

287
0:15:35.371,000 --> 0:15:4,000
to perform given their age. After two weeks of training

288
0:15:40.581,000 --> 0:15:43,000
on action video games, they actually perform better,

289
0:15:44.437,000 --> 0:15:49,000
and the improvement is still there five months after

290
0:15:49.793,000 --> 0:15:51,000
having done the training. That's really, really important.

291
0:15:52.661,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Why? Because I told you we want to use these games

292
0:15:55.141,000 --> 0:15:58,000
for education or for rehabilitation. We need to have effects

293
0:15:58.341,000 --> 0:16:,000
that are going to be long-lasting.

294
0:16:01.277,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Now, at this point, a number of you are probably wondering

295
0:16:04.13,000 --> 0:16:07,000
well, what are you waiting for, to put on the market

296
0:16:07.763,000 --> 0:16:09,000
a game that would be good for the attention

297
0:16:10.315,000 --> 0:16:13,000
of my grandmother and that she would actually enjoy,

298
0:16:13.835,000 --> 0:16:15,000
or a game that would be great to rehabilitate the vision

299
0:16:16.418,000 --> 0:16:19,000
of my grandson who has amblyopia, for example?

300
0:16:20.227,000 --> 0:16:24,000
Well, we're working on it, but here is a challenge.

301
0:16:24.707,000 --> 0:16:25,000
There are brain scientists like me that are beginning

302
0:16:26.618,000 --> 0:16:29,000
to understand what are the good ingredients in games

303
0:16:29.875,000 --> 0:16:32,000
to promote positive effects, and that's what I'm going

304
0:16:32.98,000 --> 0:16:35,000
to call the broccoli side of the equation.

305
0:16:36.554,000 --> 0:16:39,000
There is an entertainment software industry

306
0:16:40.29,000 --> 0:16:43,000
which is extremely deft at coming up with

307
0:16:43.762,000 --> 0:16:47,000
appealing products that you can't resist.

308
0:16:47.906,000 --> 0:16:5,000
That's the chocolate side of the equation.

309
0:16:51.434,000 --> 0:16:54,000
The issue is we need to put the two together,

310
0:16:54.458,000 --> 0:16:56,000
and it's a little bit like with food.

311
0:16:56.714,000 --> 0:16:59,000
Who really wants to eat chocolate-covered broccoli?

312
0:17:00.355,000 --> 0:17:02,000
None of you. (Laughter) And you probably have had

313
0:17:02.614,000 --> 0:17:04,000
that feeling, right, picking up an education game

314
0:17:04.946,000 --> 0:17:07,000
and sort of feeling, hmm, you know, it's not really fun,

315
0:17:08.338,000 --> 0:17:1,000
it's not really engaging. So what we need

316
0:17:10.755,000 --> 0:17:13,000
is really a new brand of chocolate, a brand of chocolate

317
0:17:14.106,000 --> 0:17:18,000
that is irresistible, that you really want to play,

318
0:17:18.117,000 --> 0:17:2,000
but that has all the ingredients, the good ingredients

319
0:17:21.102,000 --> 0:17:24,000
that are extracted from the broccoli that you can't recognize

320
0:17:24.33,000 --> 0:17:26,000
but are still working on your brains. And we're working on it,

321
0:17:27.169,000 --> 0:17:31,000
but it takes brain scientists to come and to get together,

322
0:17:31.645,000 --> 0:17:33,000
people that work in the entertainment software industry,

323
0:17:34.608,000 --> 0:17:36,000
and publishers, so these are not people that usually

324
0:17:37.346,000 --> 0:17:39,000
meet every day, but it's actually doable,

325
0:17:39.683,000 --> 0:17:41,000
and we are on the right track.

326
0:17:42.33,000 --> 0:17:43,000
I'd like to leave you with that thought,

327
0:17:44.112,000 --> 0:17:47,000
and thank you for your attention. (Applause)

328
0:17:47.479,000 --> 0:17:51,000
(Applause)

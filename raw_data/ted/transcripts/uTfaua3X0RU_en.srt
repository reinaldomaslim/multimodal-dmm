1
0:00:12.958,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I danced with Bella for the first time

2
0:00:14.833,000 --> 0:00:16,000
as Bei Mir Bistu Shein filled the room.

3
0:00:17.458,000 --> 0:00:19,000
And her blue eyes locked with mine.

4
0:00:19.875,000 --> 0:00:2,000
We took turns singing

5
0:00:21.583,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and forgetting the words.

6
0:00:23.042,000 --> 0:00:24,000
She led, I followed.

7
0:00:24.333,000 --> 0:00:26,000
A waltz step here,

8
0:00:26.417,000 --> 0:00:27,000
a shimmy here.

9
0:00:27.708,000 --> 0:00:28,000
(Rattle sound)

10
0:00:28.833,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Hands on our hearts,

12
0:00:32.458,000 --> 0:00:33,000
our foreheads touching,

13
0:00:33.75,000 --> 0:00:35,000
as we communicated through movement and music,

14
0:00:36.375,000 --> 0:00:38,000
making sense through nonsense.

15
0:00:39.042,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Bella is 83 and lives with dementia.

16
0:00:41.958,000 --> 0:00:44,000
The dance gives us a chance to find each other.

17
0:00:45.125,000 --> 0:00:46,000
How did I learn to dance with dementia?

18
0:00:47.007,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Because I'm not a dancer.

19
0:00:48.292,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And I'm not a doctor.

20
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:52,000
But I've played one in the hospital.

21
0:00:52.125,000 --> 0:00:53,000
(Laughs)

22
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I'm a clown doctor.

23
0:00:56.083,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Or a medical clown.

24
0:00:58.333,000 --> 0:01:,000
My tools are whoopee cushions,

25
0:01:05.25,000 --> 0:01:06,000
shakers

26
0:01:06.542,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Shaker rattles)

27
0:01:09.583,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and a red nose.

28
0:01:11.375,000 --> 0:01:15,000
You know the old adage "laughter is the best medicine?"

29
0:01:15.5,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I hear that a lot.

30
0:01:16.792,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Now, at the same time, there are studies to support it,

31
0:01:19.417,000 --> 0:01:2,000
but right now,

32
0:01:20.708,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I'd like to take you behind the nose and go beyond the laughter

33
0:01:23.708,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and share a few things that I've seen skating through ICUs.

34
0:01:26.542,000 --> 0:01:27,000
In my Heelys.

35
0:01:27.917,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Size 11.

36
0:01:29.917,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Because I take medical clowning

37
0:01:32.333,000 --> 0:01:35,000
very, very seriously.

38
0:01:35.5,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Deflating sound)

39
0:01:36.667,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Laughter)

40
0:01:38.667,000 --> 0:01:39,000
(Deflating sound)

41
0:01:40.951,000 --> 0:01:41,000
(Deflating sound)

42
0:01:42.125,000 --> 0:01:43,000
(Laughter)

43
0:01:43.333,000 --> 0:01:45,000
My mentor was conducting clown rounds in the hospital

44
0:01:46.042,000 --> 0:01:47,000
when he was approached by a nurse.

45
0:01:47.708,000 --> 0:01:49,000
They needed to put a tube up the kid's nose.

46
0:01:49.917,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Kid didn't want to do it,

47
0:01:51.208,000 --> 0:01:52,000
so rather than hold the kid down,

48
0:01:52.833,000 --> 0:01:53,000
they asked my colleague if he could help.

49
0:01:54.81,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So the clown asked for a second tube

50
0:01:57.125,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and shoved it up his own nose.

51
0:01:59.292,000 --> 0:02:,000
Kid of like this.

52
0:02:01.583,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Oh, please don't do this at home.

53
0:02:10.875,000 --> 0:02:11,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:12.083,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Now, the kid saw this,

55
0:02:14.833,000 --> 0:02:15,000
grabbed his own tube

56
0:02:16.625,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and promptly stuck it up his own nose,

57
0:02:18.875,000 --> 0:02:19,000
kind of like this.

58
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:31,000
(Applause)

59
0:02:31.625,000 --> 0:02:33,000
The clowns, the nurse and the patient

60
0:02:34.125,000 --> 0:02:37,000
discovered a creative solution for their situation together.

61
0:02:37.667,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And guess what, there's research to back this up.

62
0:02:40.042,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Randomized controlled trials in Israel and Italy

63
0:02:42.833,000 --> 0:02:45,000
show that medical clowns can be as effective as tranquilizers

64
0:02:45.958,000 --> 0:02:46,000
with no side effects.

65
0:02:47.375,000 --> 0:02:5,000
In 2004, I started conducting my own clown rounds

66
0:02:50.417,000 --> 0:02:53,000
at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.

67
0:02:53.625,000 --> 0:02:56,000
My colleague and I were invited to accompany a young six-year-old

68
0:02:56.708,000 --> 0:02:58,000
with the most adorable southern accent,

69
0:02:58.75,000 --> 0:03:,000
to accompany him while he got his chemotherapy port flushed,

70
0:03:01.667,000 --> 0:03:03,000
a very uncomfortable and regular procedure.

71
0:03:03.75,000 --> 0:03:05,000
We joined him, his mom and the nurse

72
0:03:06.208,000 --> 0:03:08,000
in this tiny, closed curtain cubicle.

73
0:03:09.125,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Every medical clown encounter begins by obtaining consent from the patient.

74
0:03:12.958,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So we ask him if we can be there.

75
0:03:15.333,000 --> 0:03:16,000
He says, "Sure."

76
0:03:16.625,000 --> 0:03:18,000
We're often the one element that a child could control

77
0:03:19.208,000 --> 0:03:2,000
while they're in the hospital.

78
0:03:20.708,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So we start with a card trick,

79
0:03:22.875,000 --> 0:03:23,000
fan the deck so he can pick.

80
0:03:24.375,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But as soon as the nurse approaches with the needle

81
0:03:26.833,000 --> 0:03:27,000
to flush the port,

82
0:03:28.125,000 --> 0:03:29,000
he starts screaming and cussing

83
0:03:29.792,000 --> 0:03:31,000
like no six-year-old I'd ever heard in my life.

84
0:03:32.375,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So we say, "Hey, should we come back later?"

85
0:03:34.5,000 --> 0:03:36,000
He stops, mouth open,

86
0:03:36.958,000 --> 0:03:39,000
eyes wet with tears, face flushed pink with anger,

87
0:03:40.542,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and he smiles,

88
0:03:41.875,000 --> 0:03:43,000
"Oh no, you're fine, I want you to be here."

89
0:03:44.875,000 --> 0:03:45,000
OK.

90
0:03:46.167,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So we start playing a song,

91
0:03:47.542,000 --> 0:03:49,000
my colleague on recorder, me on whoopee cushion.

92
0:03:50.542,000 --> 0:03:51,000
The nurse approaches with the needle,

93
0:03:52.375,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and it happens again, this torrent of four-letter words.

94
0:03:56.583,000 --> 0:03:58,000
He went from playing and laughing

95
0:03:58.625,000 --> 0:03:59,000
to screaming and crying,

96
0:04:00.083,000 --> 0:04:02,000
back and forth until the procedure was complete.

97
0:04:02.417,000 --> 0:04:03,000
For the first time,

98
0:04:03.708,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I experienced this odd duality of joy and suffering.

99
0:04:07.5,000 --> 0:04:08,000
But not for the last time.

100
0:04:08.917,000 --> 0:04:1,000
See, when we're there, we're not there merely to distract

101
0:04:11.917,000 --> 0:04:12,000
or make anyone feel better per se.

102
0:04:13.833,000 --> 0:04:15,000
The medical clowns work moment by moment

103
0:04:16.125,000 --> 0:04:18,000
to create connections between the clowns,

104
0:04:18.708,000 --> 0:04:2,000
the nurse, the parent and the child.

105
0:04:21.25,000 --> 0:04:24,000
This provides a source of power or control for the child

106
0:04:24.583,000 --> 0:04:26,000
while supporting the staff with their work.

107
0:04:27.292,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I've spent over a decade bringing joy and delight

108
0:04:30.167,000 --> 0:04:32,000
to the bedsides of terminally ill children

109
0:04:32.25,000 --> 0:04:33,000
in the top hospitals in New York City.

110
0:04:34.084,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And you know what I've learned?

111
0:04:36.625,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Everyone's hurting.

112
0:04:38.417,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Staff, family, patients.

113
0:04:41.375,000 --> 0:04:43,000
The patient's in the hospital because they're hurting.

114
0:04:43.958,000 --> 0:04:45,000
The family's hurting as they navigate uncertainty, grief

115
0:04:46.667,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and the financial burdens of care.

116
0:04:48.375,000 --> 0:04:5,000
The staff is hurting, only it's more than burnout.

117
0:04:50.75,000 --> 0:04:51,000
More and more health care workers

118
0:04:52.375,000 --> 0:04:55,000
are reporting feeling overworked and overextended.

119
0:04:55.875,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Now, I'm not so naive as to suggest

120
0:04:58.083,000 --> 0:05:,000
that the solution is to send in the clowns.

121
0:05:02.75,000 --> 0:05:04,000
(Laughter)

122
0:05:05.75,000 --> 0:05:06,000
But what if?

123
0:05:07.042,000 --> 0:05:11,000
What if the tools of medical clown arts practitioners from around the world

124
0:05:11.125,000 --> 0:05:13,000
permeated our entire health care system?

125
0:05:13.583,000 --> 0:05:16,000
In 2018, at the Healthcare Clowning International Meeting,

126
0:05:17.542,000 --> 0:05:21,000
they represented over 150 programs in 50 different countries.

127
0:05:21.833,000 --> 0:05:22,000
University of Haifa

128
0:05:23.417,000 --> 0:05:27,000
offers a formal undergraduate degree program in medical clowning.

129
0:05:27.875,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Argentina has passed laws requiring the presence of medical clowns

130
0:05:32.5,000 --> 0:05:34,000
in public hospitals at their largest province.

131
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And this work affects more than the patients.

132
0:05:37.125,000 --> 0:05:39,000
It makes things better for the whole health care team.

133
0:05:39.708,000 --> 0:05:41,000
One of my favorite games to play in the hospital

134
0:05:42.042,000 --> 0:05:43,000
is elevator music.

135
0:05:43.333,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I love elevators, because they're a place

136
0:05:45.875,000 --> 0:05:48,000
where paths cross, different worlds meet.

137
0:05:48.958,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It's intimate,

138
0:05:50.625,000 --> 0:05:51,000
uncomfortably quiet

139
0:05:52.167,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and just begging for a little playful disruption.

140
0:05:55.167,000 --> 0:05:56,000
The doors close

141
0:05:56.542,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and "The Girl from Ipanema" starts playing on Hammond organ,

142
0:06:00.125,000 --> 0:06:03,000
because I keep a portable speaker hidden in my pocket.

143
0:06:04.042,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So for those used to using the silent, sterile elevator,

144
0:06:07.208,000 --> 0:06:08,000
it's a moment of surprise.

145
0:06:08.542,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Folks have permission to acknowledge or not this disruption.

146
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:15,000
The game grows with every stop,

147
0:06:15.875,000 --> 0:06:17,000
because as soon as the elevator stops,

148
0:06:18.292,000 --> 0:06:19,000
the music stops.

149
0:06:19.583,000 --> 0:06:2,000
New passengers get on,

150
0:06:20.875,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and the current passengers get to witness the new passengers --

151
0:06:24.458,000 --> 0:06:27,000
their surprise -- as they hear the elevator music for the first time.

152
0:06:27.917,000 --> 0:06:3,000
You experience the shift of adults

153
0:06:31.792,000 --> 0:06:34,000
standing silently, strangers in an elevator,

154
0:06:35.417,000 --> 0:06:37,000
to attempting to suppress their mirth,

155
0:06:37.708,000 --> 0:06:39,000
to, "Is this a party or an elevator,"

156
0:06:40.208,000 --> 0:06:42,000
filled with full-on laughter.

157
0:06:42.708,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Research conducted in Brazil,

158
0:06:45.208,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Australia, Canada and Germany

159
0:06:47.708,000 --> 0:06:5,000
confirm that the artistic interventions of medical clowns

160
0:06:50.833,000 --> 0:06:53,000
improve the work environment for the staff, beyond the elevator,

161
0:06:53.917,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and support their work administering care.

162
0:06:56.083,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Promising research in the US indicates

163
0:06:57.917,000 --> 0:06:59,000
that arts programing in the hospital

164
0:07:00.042,000 --> 0:07:01,000
can improve the work environment,

165
0:07:01.708,000 --> 0:07:02,000
leading to increased job satisfaction

166
0:07:03.625,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and better quality of care.

167
0:07:05.375,000 --> 0:07:06,000
My work has taught me

168
0:07:06.792,000 --> 0:07:08,000
how to actually be present.

169
0:07:09.583,000 --> 0:07:11,000
How to breathe in a room with a person in pain.

170
0:07:12.417,000 --> 0:07:13,000
How to connect

171
0:07:13.708,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and build trust, no matter the age, ability or illness.

172
0:07:17.292,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And how medical clowning is an excellent way of using the arts

173
0:07:20.221,000 --> 0:07:22,000
to put the care back in health care.

174
0:07:22.792,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Thanks.

175
0:07:24.083,000 --> 0:07:27,000

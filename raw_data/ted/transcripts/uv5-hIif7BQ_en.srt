1
0:00:13.349,000 --> 0:00:16,000
There are more than a trillion galaxies in the universe.

2
0:00:17.976,000 --> 0:00:2,000
And my team discovered an extremely rare one,

3
0:00:21.831,000 --> 0:00:25,000
a galaxy that doesn't look quite like anything observed before.

4
0:00:27.077,000 --> 0:00:29,000
This galaxy is so peculiar,

5
0:00:29.736,000 --> 0:00:32,000
that it challenges our theories and our assumptions

6
0:00:33.434,000 --> 0:00:35,000
about how the universe works.

7
0:00:37.561,000 --> 0:00:39,000
The majority of the galaxies are spiral,

8
0:00:40.497,000 --> 0:00:41,000
similar to our own Milky Way.

9
0:00:42.99,000 --> 0:00:47,000
We have strong theories about how these common galaxies form and evolve.

10
0:00:48.762,000 --> 0:00:53,000
But we don't understand how rare galaxies form and evolve.

11
0:00:55.965,000 --> 0:00:58,000
An especially puzzling rare case is Hoag's Object.

12
0:01:00.434,000 --> 0:01:06,000
It has a very symmetric central body surrounded by a circular outer ring,

13
0:01:07.03,000 --> 0:01:09,000
with nothing visible connecting them.

14
0:01:10.974,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Hoag-type galaxies are among the rarest types of galaxies currently known.

15
0:01:16.538,000 --> 0:01:19,000
There are fewer than one in 1,000 galaxies.

16
0:01:22.072,000 --> 0:01:27,000
It's a mystery how the stars in the outer ring are just floating there

17
0:01:28.025,000 --> 0:01:3,000
in such an orderly manner.

18
0:01:30.898,000 --> 0:01:31,000
That's interesting, right?

19
0:01:33.049,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Hold on.

20
0:01:34.279,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Things are about to get more mysterious.

21
0:01:37.501,000 --> 0:01:4,000
The galaxy that my team discovered is even rarer

22
0:01:41.066,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and much more complex than that.

23
0:01:44.339,000 --> 0:01:47,000
You know, sometimes, you search and search for these objects,

24
0:01:48.244,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and you find nothing.

25
0:01:50.458,000 --> 0:01:53,000
But sometimes, it just appears in the background,

26
0:01:55.315,000 --> 0:01:57,000
when you are not even looking for it.

27
0:01:58.395,000 --> 0:02:01,000
This system looks very similar to Hoag's Object,

28
0:02:01.72,000 --> 0:02:04,000
with its central body and circular outer ring.

29
0:02:05.188,000 --> 0:02:09,000
We got very excited and thought we discovered another Hoag's Object.

30
0:02:10.427,000 --> 0:02:16,000
But my research showed this is an entirely new galaxy type,

31
0:02:17.417,000 --> 0:02:2,000
now commonly referred to as "Burçin's Galaxy."

32
0:02:21.957,000 --> 0:02:22,000
(Laughs)

33
0:02:23.132,000 --> 0:02:26,000
(Cheers) (Applause)

34
0:02:27.072,000 --> 0:02:31,000
We will not be visiting this galaxy anytime soon.

35
0:02:31.237,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It is approximately 359 million light years away from Earth.

36
0:02:38.331,000 --> 0:02:39,000
You may think this is far.

37
0:02:40.545,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Well, actually, this is one of the nearby galaxies.

38
0:02:45.741,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I study this object in different light --

39
0:02:48.796,000 --> 0:02:51,000
in ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared.

40
0:02:53.448,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Small details on our body, like a scar or wrinkles,

41
0:02:57.702,000 --> 0:02:58,000
tell the story of our lives.

42
0:02:59.773,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Similarly, a galaxy's structure in different light

43
0:03:03.893,000 --> 0:03:06,000
can help us trace back their origin and evolution.

44
0:03:07.927,000 --> 0:03:08,000
How do I look for these details?

45
0:03:10.592,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I model the bright central body

46
0:03:13.165,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and remove my model from the image

47
0:03:15.673,000 --> 0:03:17,000
to check for any hidden features,

48
0:03:18.046,000 --> 0:03:23,000
because a bright structure in a galaxy may blind our views of faint features,

49
0:03:24.046,000 --> 0:03:28,000
just like using sunglasses when you are blinded by the intense light.

50
0:03:30.297,000 --> 0:03:32,000
The result was a big surprise.

51
0:03:33.431,000 --> 0:03:36,000
This galaxy doesn't just have an outer ring,

52
0:03:37.066,000 --> 0:03:4,000
it has an additional, diffused inner ring.

53
0:03:41.616,000 --> 0:03:45,000
We were having a hard time explaining the origin of the outer ring

54
0:03:46.378,000 --> 0:03:47,000
in Hoag-type galaxies.

55
0:03:48.314,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Now we also need to explain this mysterious second ring.

56
0:03:53.611,000 --> 0:03:55,000
There is currently no known mechanism

57
0:03:56.27,000 --> 0:04:,000
that can explain the existence of an inner ring in such a peculiar galaxy.

58
0:04:01.379,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So the discovery of Burçin's Galaxy clearly highlights the gap

59
0:04:06.117,000 --> 0:04:08,000
in our knowledge of galaxy evolution.

60
0:04:09.601,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Further research into how this extremely rare galaxy was formed

61
0:04:14.363,000 --> 0:04:18,000
can provide us with new clues on how the universe works.

62
0:04:21.257,000 --> 0:04:25,000
This discovery tells us that we still have a lot to learn,

63
0:04:25.939,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and we should keep looking deeper and deeper in space

64
0:04:29.873,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and keep searching for the unknown.

65
0:04:32.92,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Thank you.

66
0:04:34.144,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm going to talk about two stories today.

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
One is how we need to use market-based pricing to affect demand

3
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and use wireless technologies to dramatically reduce our emissions

4
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
in the transportation sector.

5
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And the other is that there is an incredible opportunity

6
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
if we choose the right wireless technologies;

7
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
how we can generate a new engine for economic growth

8
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and dramatically reduce C02 in the other sectors.

9
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I'm really scared.

10
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
We need to reduce C02 emissions in ten to fifteen years by 80 percent

11
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
in order to avert catastrophic effects.

12
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And I am astounded that I'm standing here to tell you that.

13
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
What are catastrophic effects? A three degree centigrade climate change rise

14
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that will result in 50 percent species extinction.

15
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
It's not a movie. This is real life.

16
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And I'm really worried, because when people talk about cars

17
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
-- which I know something about --

18
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
the press and politicians and people in this room are all thinking,

19
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
"Let's use fuel-efficient cars."

20
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
If we started today, 10 years from now, at the end of this window of opportunity,

21
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
those fuel-efficient cars will reduce our fossil fuel needs by four percent.

22
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
That is not enough.

23
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
But now I'll talk about some more pleasant things.

24
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Here are some ways that we can make some dramatic changes.

25
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So, Zipcar is a company that I founded seven years ago,

26
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
but it's an example of something called car sharing.

27
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
What Zipcar does is we park cars throughout dense urban areas

28
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
for members to reserve, by the hour and by the day, instead of using their own car.

29
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
How does it feel to be a person using a Zipcar?

30
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
It means that I pay only for what I need.

31
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
All those hours when a car is sitting idle, I'm not paying for it.

32
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It means that I can choose a car exactly for that particular trip.

33
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So, here's a woman that reserved MiniMia, and she had her day.

34
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I can take a BMW when I'm seeing clients.

35
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I can drive my Toyota Element when I'm going to go on that surfing trip.

36
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And the other remarkable thing is it's, I think, the highest status of car ownership.

37
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Not only do I have a fleet of cars available to me in seven cities around the world

38
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that I can have at my beck and call,

39
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
but heaven forbid I would ever maintain

40
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
or deal with the repair or have anything to do with it.

41
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
It's like the car that you always wanted that your mom said that you couldn't have.

42
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I get all the good stuff and none of the bad.

43
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So, what is the social result of this?

44
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
The social result is that today's Zipcar has 100,000 members

45
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
driving 3,000 cars parked in 3,000 parking spaces.

46
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Instead of driving 12,000 miles a year, which is what the average city dweller does,

47
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
they drive 500 miles a year. Are they happy?

48
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
The company has been doubling in size ever since I founded it, or greater.

49
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
People adore the company. And it's better,

50
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
you know? They like it.

51
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So, how is it that people went from the 12,000 miles a year to 500 miles?

52
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It's because they said, "It's eight to 10 dollars an hour and 65 dollars a day.

53
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
If I'm going to go buy some ice cream,

54
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
do I really want to spend eight dollars to go buy the ice cream? Or maybe I'll do without.

55
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Maybe I would have bought the ice cream when I did some other errand."

56
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So, people really respond very quickly to it, to prices.

57
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And the last point I want to make is Zipcar would never be possible without technology.

58
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
It required that it was completely trivial: that it takes 30 seconds

59
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
to reserve a car, go get it, drive it.

60
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And for me, as a service provider,

61
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I would never be able to provide you a car for an hour

62
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
if the transaction cost was anything.

63
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So, without these wireless technologies, this, as a concept, could never happen.

64
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So, here's another example. This company is GoLoco --

65
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I'm launching it in about three weeks --

66
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and I hope to do for ridesharing what I did for car sharing.

67
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
This will apply to people across all of America.

68
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Today, 75 percent of the trips are single-occupancy vehicles,

69
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
yet 12 percent of trips to work are currently carpool.

70
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And I think that we can apply social networks and online payment systems

71
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
to completely change how people feel about ridesharing

72
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and make that trip much more efficient.

73
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And so when I think about the future,

74
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
people will be thinking that sharing the ride with someone

75
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
is this incredibly great social event out of their day.

76
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
You know, how did you get to TED? You went with other TEDsters.

77
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
How fabulous. Why would you ever want to go by yourself in your own car?

78
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
How did you go food shopping? You went with your neighbor, what a great social time.

79
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
You know it's going to really transform how we feel about travel,

80
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and it will also, I think, enhance our freedom of mobility.

81
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Where can I go today and who can I do it with?

82
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Those are the types of things that you will look at and feel.

83
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And the social benefits:

84
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
the rate of single-occupancy vehicles is, I told you, 75 percent;

85
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
I think we can get that down to 50 percent.

86
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
The demand for parking, of course, is down, congestion and the CO2 emissions.

87
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
One last piece about this, of course, is that it's enabled by wireless technologies.

88
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And it's the cost of driving that's making people want to be able to do this.

89
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
The average American spends 19 percent of their income on their car,

90
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and there's a pressure for them to reduce that cost, yet they have no outlet today.

91
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So, the last example of this is congestion pricing, very famously done in London.

92
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
It's when you charge a premium for people to drive on congested roads.

93
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
In London, the day they turned the congestion pricing on,

94
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
there was a 25 percent decrease in congestion overnight,

95
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and that's persisted for the four years in which they've been doing congestion pricing.

96
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And again, do people like the outcome?

97
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Ken Livingstone was reelected.

98
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So again, we can see that price plays an enormous role in people's willingness

99
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
to reduce their driving behavior.

100
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
We've tripled the miles that we drive since 1970 and doubled them since 1982.

101
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
There's a huge slack in that system;

102
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
with the right pricing we can undo that.

103
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Congestion pricing is being discussed in every major city around the world

104
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and is, again, wirelessly enabled.

105
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
You weren't going to put tollbooths around the city of London

106
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and open and shut those gates.

107
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And what congestion pricing is is that it's a technology trial and a psychological trial

108
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
for something called road pricing.

109
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And road pricing is where we're all going to have to go,

110
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
because today we pay for our maintenance

111
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and wear and tear on our cars with gas taxes.

112
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And as we get our cars more fuel-efficient,

113
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
that's going to be reducing the amount of revenue that you get off of those gas taxes,

114
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
so we need to charge people by the mile that they drive.

115
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Whatever happens with congestion pricing and those technologies

116
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
will be happening with road pricing.

117
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Why do we travel too much?

118
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Car travel is underpriced and therefore we over-consumed.

119
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
We need to put this better market feedback.

120
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And if we have it, you'll decide how many miles to drive,

121
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
what mode of travel, where to live and work.

122
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And wireless technologies make this real-time loop possible.

123
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So, I want to move now to the second part of my story,

124
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
which is: when are we going to start doing

125
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
this congestion pricing? Road pricing is coming.

126
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
When are we going to do it? Are we going to wait

127
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
10 to 15 years for this to happen

128
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
or are we going to finally have this political will to make it happen in the next two years?

129
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Because I'm going to say, that is going to be the tool that's going to turn our usage overnight.

130
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And what kind of wireless technology are we going to use?

131
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
This is my big vision.

132
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
There is a tool that can help us bridge the digital divide,

133
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
respond to emergencies, get traffic moving,

134
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
provide a new engine for economic growth

135
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and dramatically reduce CO2 emissions in every sector.

136
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And this is a moment from "The Graduate." Do you remember this moment?

137
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
You guys are going to be the handsome young guy

138
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and I'm going to be the wise businessman.

139
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
"I want to say one word to you, just one word."

140
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
"Yes, sir?" "Are you listening?" "Yes I am."

141
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
"Ad-hoc peer-to-peer self-configuring wireless networks."

142
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
(Laughter)

143
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
These are also called mesh networks.

144
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And in a mesh, every device contributes to and expands the network,

145
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and I think you might have heard a little bit about it before.

146
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I'm going to give you some examples.

147
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
You'll be hearing later today from Alan Kay.

148
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
These laptops, when a child opens them up,

149
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
they communicate with every single child in the classroom,

150
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
within that school, within that village.

151
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And what is the cost of that communication system?

152
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Zero dollars a month.

153
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Here's another example: in New Orleans,

154
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
video cameras were mesh-enabled

155
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
so that they could monitor crime in the downtown French Quarter.

156
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
When the hurricane happened,

157
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
the only communication system standing was the mesh network.

158
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Volunteers flew in, added a whole bunch of devices,

159
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and for the next 12 months,

160
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
mesh networks were the only wireless that was happening in New Orleans.

161
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Another example is in Portsmouth, U.K.

162
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
They mesh-enabled 300 buses and they speak to these smart terminals.

163
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
You can look at the terminal

164
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and be able to see precisely where your bus is on the street

165
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and when it's coming, and you can buy your tickets in real time.

166
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Again, all mesh-enabled. Monthly communication cost: zero.

167
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
So, the beauty of mesh networks:

168
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
you can have these very low-cost devices.

169
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Zero ongoing communication costs. Highly scalable;

170
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
you can just keep adding them, and as in Katrina,

171
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
you can keep subtracting them -- as long as there's some, we can still communicate.

172
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
They're resilient; their redundancy is built into this fabulous decentralized design.

173
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
What are the incredible weaknesses?

174
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
There isn't anybody in Washington lobbying to make it happen --

175
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
or in those municipalities, to build out their cities with these wireless networks --

176
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
because there's zero ongoing communications cost.

177
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So, the examples that I gave you are these islands of mesh networks,

178
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and networks are interesting only as they are big.

179
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
How do we create a big network?

180
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Are you guys ready again -- "The Graduate"?

181
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
This time you will still play the handsome young thing, but I'll be the sexy woman.

182
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
These are the next two lines in the movie.

183
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
"Where did you do it?" "In his car."

184
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
So you know, when you stick this idea ... (Laughter)

185
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
where would we expect me, Robin Chase, to be thinking

186
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
is imagine if we put a mesh-network device

187
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
in every single car across America.

188
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
We could have a coast-to-coast, free wireless communication system.

189
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
I guess I just want you to think about that.

190
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
And why is this going to happen? Because we're going to do congestion pricing,

191
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
we are going to do road tolls,

192
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
gas taxes are going to become road pricing.

193
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
These things are going to happen.

194
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
What's the wireless technology we're going to use?

195
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Maybe we should use a good one. When are we going to do it?

196
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Maybe we shouldn't wait for the 10 or 15 years for this to happen.

197
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
We should pull it forward.

198
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
So, I'd like us to launch the wireless Internet interstate wireless mesh system,

199
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and require that this network be accessible to everyone, with open standards.

200
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Right now in the transportation sector, we're creating these wireless devices --

201
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
I guess you guys might have Fast Pass here or Easy Lane --

202
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
that are single-purpose devices in these closed networks.

203
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
What is the point?

204
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
We're transferring just a few little data bits

205
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
when we're doing road controlling, road pricing.

206
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
We have this incredible excess capacity.

207
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So, we can provide the lowest-cost means of going wireless coast-to-coast,

208
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
we can have resilient nationwide communication systems,

209
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
we have a new tool for creating efficiencies in all sectors.

210
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
Imagine what happens when the cost of getting information

211
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
from anywhere to anywhere is close to zero.

212
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
What you can do with that tool: we can create an economic engine.

213
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Information should be free, and access to information should be free,

214
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and we should be charging people for carbon.

215
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
I think this is a more powerful tool than the Interstate Highway Act,

216
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and I think this is as important and world changing

217
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
to our economy as electrification.

218
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And if I had my druthers,

219
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
we would have an open-source version in addition to open standards.

220
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And this open-source version means that

221
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
it could be -- if we did a brilliant job of it --

222
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
it could be used around the world very quickly.

223
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
So, going back to one of my earlier thoughts.

224
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Imagine if every one of these buses in Lagos was part of the mesh network.

225
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
When I went this morning to Larry Brilliant's TEDTalk prize

226
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
-- his fabulous networks --

227
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
imagine if there was an open-source

228
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
mesh communications device that can be put into those networks,

229
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
to make all that happen.

230
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And we can be doing it if we could just get over the fact that

231
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
this little slice of things is going to be for free.

232
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:1,000
We could make billions of dollars on top of it,

233
0:13:10.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
but this one particular slice of communications needs to be open source.

234
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
So, let's take control of this nightmare:

235
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
implement a gas tax immediately;

236
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
transition across the nation to road-tolling with this wireless mesh;

237
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
require that the mesh be open to all, with open standards;

238
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and, of course, use mesh networks.

239
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Thank you. (Applause)

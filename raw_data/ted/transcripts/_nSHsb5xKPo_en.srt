1
0:00:12.84,000 --> 0:00:16,000
In 2008, Burhan Hassan, age 17,

2
0:00:16.96,000 --> 0:00:17,000
boarded a flight from Minneapolis

3
0:00:18.92,000 --> 0:00:2,000
to the Horn of Africa.

4
0:00:21.24,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And while Burhan was the youngest recruit,

5
0:00:23.68,000 --> 0:00:24,000
he was not alone.

6
0:00:25.36,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Al-Shabaab managed to recruit over two dozen young men

7
0:00:28.76,000 --> 0:00:3,000
in their late teens and early 20s

8
0:00:31.36,000 --> 0:00:35,000
with a heavy presence on social media platforms like Facebook.

9
0:00:35.4,000 --> 0:00:37,000
With the Internet and other technologies,

10
0:00:37.68,000 --> 0:00:38,000
they've changed our everyday lives,

11
0:00:39.4,000 --> 0:00:42,000
but they've also changed recruitment, radicalization

12
0:00:43.24,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and the front lines of conflict today.

13
0:00:47.68,000 --> 0:00:49,000
What about the links connecting Twitter,

14
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Google and protesters fighting for democracy?

15
0:00:54.12,000 --> 0:00:58,000
These numbers represent Google's public DNS servers,

16
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
effectively the only digital border crossing

17
0:01:00.72,000 --> 0:01:02,000
protesters had and could use

18
0:01:02.8,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to communicate with each other, to reach the outside world

19
0:01:05.64,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and to spread viral awareness

20
0:01:07.28,000 --> 0:01:09,000
of what was happening in their own country.

21
0:01:10.96,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Today, conflict is essentially borderless.

22
0:01:13.4,000 --> 0:01:15,000
If there are bounds to conflict today,

23
0:01:16.08,000 --> 0:01:19,000
they're bound by digital, not physical geography.

24
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And under all this is a vacuum of power

25
0:01:23.08,000 --> 0:01:27,000
where non-state actors, individuals and private organizations

26
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
have the advantage over slow, outdated military and intelligence agencies.

27
0:01:33.24,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And this is because, in the digital age of conflict,

28
0:01:36.04,000 --> 0:01:38,000
there exists a feedback loop

29
0:01:38.32,000 --> 0:01:4,000
where new technologies, platforms like the ones I mentioned,

30
0:01:41.2,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and more disruptive ones,

31
0:01:42.68,000 --> 0:01:46,000
can be adapted, learned, and deployed by individuals and organizations

32
0:01:47.48,000 --> 0:01:49,000
faster than governments can react.

33
0:01:51.84,000 --> 0:01:55,000
To understand the pace of our own government thinking on this,

34
0:01:55.96,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I like to turn to something aptly named

35
0:01:57.96,000 --> 0:02:,000
the Worldwide Threat Assessment,

36
0:02:01.12,000 --> 0:02:04,000
where every year the Director of National Intelligence in the US

37
0:02:04.84,000 --> 0:02:06,000
looks at the global threat landscape,

38
0:02:07.68,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and he says, "These are the threats, these are the details,

39
0:02:10.96,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and this is how we rank them."

40
0:02:13.04,000 --> 0:02:16,000
In 2007, there was absolutely no mention of cyber security.

41
0:02:16.48,000 --> 0:02:19,000
It took until 2011, when it came at the end,

42
0:02:20.199,000 --> 0:02:23,000
where other things, like West African drug trafficking, took precedence.

43
0:02:24.12,000 --> 0:02:29,000
In 2012, it crept up, still behind things like terrorism and proliferation.

44
0:02:29.64,000 --> 0:02:31,000
In 2013, it became the top threat,

45
0:02:31.76,000 --> 0:02:34,000
in 2014 and for the foreseeable future.

46
0:02:36.24,000 --> 0:02:37,000
What things like that show us

47
0:02:37.92,000 --> 0:02:39,000
is that there is a fundamental inability today

48
0:02:40.92,000 --> 0:02:44,000
on the part of governments to adapt and learn in digital conflict,

49
0:02:46.12,000 --> 0:02:5,000
where conflict can be immaterial, borderless, often wholly untraceable.

50
0:02:51.56,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And conflict isn't just online to offline, as we see with terrorist radicalization,

51
0:02:56.2,000 --> 0:02:58,000
but it goes the other way as well.

52
0:02:59.52,000 --> 0:03:02,000
We all know the horrible events that unfolded in Paris this year

53
0:03:03.08,000 --> 0:03:04,000
with the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks.

54
0:03:05.057,000 --> 0:03:09,000
What an individual hacker or a small group of anonymous individuals did

55
0:03:09.56,000 --> 0:03:13,000
was enter those social media conversations that so many of us took part in.

56
0:03:14.2,000 --> 0:03:16,000
#JeSuisCharlie.

57
0:03:16.36,000 --> 0:03:18,000
On Facebook, on Twitter, on Google,

58
0:03:18.6,000 --> 0:03:21,000
all sorts of places where millions of people, myself included,

59
0:03:22.08,000 --> 0:03:23,000
were talking about the events

60
0:03:23.72,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and saw images like this,

61
0:03:25.2,000 --> 0:03:3,000
the emotional, poignant image of a baby with "Je suis Charlie" on its wrist.

62
0:03:30.36,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And this turned into a weapon.

63
0:03:32.48,000 --> 0:03:34,000
What the hackers did was weaponize this image,

64
0:03:34.84,000 --> 0:03:35,000
where unsuspecting victims,

65
0:03:36.52,000 --> 0:03:37,000
like all of us in those conversations,

66
0:03:38.44,000 --> 0:03:4,000
saw this image, downloaded it

67
0:03:41.08,000 --> 0:03:43,000
but it was embedded with malware.

68
0:03:43.24,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And so when you downloaded this image,

69
0:03:45.24,000 --> 0:03:47,000
it hacked your system.

70
0:03:47.32,000 --> 0:03:51,000
It took six days to deploy a global malware campaign.

71
0:03:52.4,000 --> 0:03:54,000
The divide between physical and digital domains today

72
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
ceases to exist,

73
0:03:56.6,000 --> 0:03:58,000
where we have offline attacks like those in Paris

74
0:03:59.56,000 --> 0:04:01,000
appropriated for online hacks.

75
0:04:03.32,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And it goes the other way as well, with recruitment.

76
0:04:05.8,000 --> 0:04:07,000
We see online radicalization of teens,

77
0:04:08.28,000 --> 0:04:12,000
who can then be deployed globally for offline terrorist attacks.

78
0:04:13.48,000 --> 0:04:17,000
With all of this, we see that there's a new 21st century battle brewing,

79
0:04:18.36,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and governments don't necessarily take a part.

80
0:04:21.56,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So in another case, Anonymous vs. Los Zetas.

81
0:04:26.92,000 --> 0:04:28,000
In early September 2011 in Mexico,

82
0:04:29.48,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Los Zetas, one of the most powerful drug cartels,

83
0:04:32.56,000 --> 0:04:34,000
hung two bloggers with a sign that said,

84
0:04:34.92,000 --> 0:04:37,000
"This is what will happen to all Internet busybodies."

85
0:04:39.72,000 --> 0:04:4,000
A week later, they beheaded a young girl.

86
0:04:41.72,000 --> 0:04:43,000
They severed her head, put it on top of her computer

87
0:04:44.2,000 --> 0:04:45,000
with a similar note.

88
0:04:45.44,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And taking the digital counteroffensive

89
0:04:48.32,000 --> 0:04:51,000
because governments couldn't even understand what was going on or act,

90
0:04:51.63,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Anonymous, a group we might not associate as the most positive force in the world,

91
0:04:55.55,000 --> 0:04:56,000
took action,

92
0:04:56.76,000 --> 0:04:59,000
not in cyber attacks, but threatening information to be free.

93
0:05:01.92,000 --> 0:05:02,000
On social media, they said,

94
0:05:03.64,000 --> 0:05:04,000
"We will release information

95
0:05:05.32,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that ties prosecutors and governors to corrupt drug deals with the cartel."

96
0:05:10.8,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And escalating that conflict,

97
0:05:13.2,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Los Zetas said, "We will kill 10 people for every bit of information you release."

98
0:05:19.88,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And so it ended there because it would become too gruesome to continue.

99
0:05:25.56,000 --> 0:05:27,000
But what was powerful about this

100
0:05:28.64,000 --> 0:05:3,000
was that anonymous individuals,

101
0:05:31.24,000 --> 0:05:34,000
not federal policia, not military, not politicians,

102
0:05:34.88,000 --> 0:05:38,000
could strike fear deep into the heart

103
0:05:39.08,000 --> 0:05:43,000
of one of the most powerful, violent organizations in the world.

104
0:05:44.32,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And so we live in an era

105
0:05:46.52,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that lacks the clarity of the past in conflict,

106
0:05:50.08,000 --> 0:05:53,000
in who we're fighting, in the motivations behind attacks,

107
0:05:53.92,000 --> 0:05:54,000
in the tools and techniques used,

108
0:05:55.8,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and how quickly they evolve.

109
0:05:58.72,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And the question still remains:

110
0:06:00.24,000 --> 0:06:05,000
what can individuals, organizations and governments do?

111
0:06:05.8,000 --> 0:06:07,000
For answers to these questions, it starts with individuals,

112
0:06:08.64,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and I think peer-to-peer security is the answer.

113
0:06:12.8,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Those people in relationships that bought over teens online,

114
0:06:16.76,000 --> 0:06:18,000
we can do that with peer-to-peer security.

115
0:06:18.84,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Individuals have more power than ever before

116
0:06:21.4,000 --> 0:06:23,000
to affect national and international security.

117
0:06:25.36,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And we can create those positive peer-to-peer relationships

118
0:06:28.64,000 --> 0:06:29,000
on and offline,

119
0:06:30.72,000 --> 0:06:34,000
we can support and educate the next generation of hackers, like myself,

120
0:06:35.08,000 --> 0:06:38,000
instead of saying, "You can either be a criminal or join the NSA."

121
0:06:39.36,000 --> 0:06:4,000
That matters today.

122
0:06:41.84,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And it's not just individuals -- it's organizations, corporations even.

123
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
They have an advantage to act across more borders,

124
0:06:49.72,000 --> 0:06:52,000
more effectively and more rapidly than governments can,

125
0:06:53.28,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and there's a set of real incentives there.

126
0:06:57.44,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It's profitable and valuable

127
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
to be seen as trustworthy in the digital age,

128
0:07:02.68,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and will only be more so in future generations to come.

129
0:07:06.68,000 --> 0:07:07,000
But we still can't ignore government,

130
0:07:08.52,000 --> 0:07:11,000
because that's who we turn to for collective action

131
0:07:11.88,000 --> 0:07:13,000
to keep us safe and secure.

132
0:07:16.08,000 --> 0:07:19,000
But we see where that's gotten us so far,

133
0:07:19.12,000 --> 0:07:22,000
where there's an inability to adapt and learn in digital conflict,

134
0:07:22.88,000 --> 0:07:25,000
where at the highest levels of leadership,

135
0:07:25.96,000 --> 0:07:27,000
the Director of the CIA, Secretary of Defense,

136
0:07:28.36,000 --> 0:07:32,000
they say, "Cyber Pearl Harbor will happen." "Cyber 9/11 is imminent."

137
0:07:35.08,000 --> 0:07:38,000
But this only makes us more fearful, not more secure.

138
0:07:39.2,000 --> 0:07:42,000
By banning encryption in favor of mass surveillance and mass hacking,

139
0:07:42.96,000 --> 0:07:44,000
sure, GCHQ and the NSA can spy on you.

140
0:07:46.88,000 --> 0:07:48,000
But that doesn't mean that they're the only ones that can.

141
0:07:49.619,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Capabilities are cheap, even free.

142
0:07:51.8,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Technical ability is rising around the world,

143
0:07:54.44,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and individuals and small groups have the advantage.

144
0:07:59.52,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So today it might just be the NSA and GCHQ,

145
0:08:02.48,000 --> 0:08:04,000
but who's to say that the Chinese can't find that backdoor?

146
0:08:06.12,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Or in another generation, some kid in his basement in Estonia?

147
0:08:10.88,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And so I would say that it's not what governments can do,

148
0:08:15.68,000 --> 0:08:16,000
it's that they can't.

149
0:08:17.72,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Governments today need to give up power and control

150
0:08:22.24,000 --> 0:08:24,000
in order to help make us more secure.

151
0:08:25.6,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Giving up mass surveillance and hacking and instead fixing those backdoors

152
0:08:29.72,000 --> 0:08:31,000
means that, yeah, they can't spy on us,

153
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:33,000
but neither can the Chinese

154
0:08:33.36,000 --> 0:08:35,000
or that hacker in Estonia a generation from now.

155
0:08:37.28,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And government support for technologies like Tor and Bitcoin

156
0:08:40.76,000 --> 0:08:41,000
mean giving up control,

157
0:08:42.36,000 --> 0:08:46,000
but it means that developers, translators, anybody with an Internet connection,

158
0:08:46.679,000 --> 0:08:5,000
in countries like Cuba, Iran and China, can sell their skills, their products,

159
0:08:50.799,000 --> 0:08:51,000
in the global marketplace,

160
0:08:52.2,000 --> 0:08:54,000
but more importantly sell their ideas,

161
0:08:54.44,000 --> 0:08:56,000
show us what's happening in their own countries.

162
0:08:58.08,000 --> 0:09:,000
And so it should be not fearful,

163
0:09:00.4,000 --> 0:09:02,000
it should be inspiring to the same governments

164
0:09:02.84,000 --> 0:09:04,000
that fought for civil rights, free speech and democracy

165
0:09:05.72,000 --> 0:09:07,000
in the great wars of the last century,

166
0:09:07.76,000 --> 0:09:1,000
that today, for the first time in human history,

167
0:09:10.84,000 --> 0:09:12,000
we have a technical opportunity

168
0:09:13.08,000 --> 0:09:15,000
to make billions of people safer around the world

169
0:09:15.72,000 --> 0:09:17,000
that we've never had before in human history.

170
0:09:18.28,000 --> 0:09:2,000
It should be inspiring.

171
0:09:21.84,000 --> 0:09:26,000
(Applause)

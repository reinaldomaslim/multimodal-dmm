1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Last January, my company, Fark.com, was sued

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
along with Yahoo, MSN, Reddit,

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
AOL, TechCrunch and others

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
by a company called Gooseberry Natural Resources.

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Gooseberry owned a patent

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
for the creation and distribution

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
of news releases via email.

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Now it may seem kind of strange that such a thing can actually be patented,

10
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
but it does happen all the time.

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Take something already being done

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and patent it for an emerging technology --

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
like phone calls on the internet

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
or video listings for TV shows

15
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
or radio but for cellphones,

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and so on.

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
The problem with these patents

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
is that the mechanisms are obscure

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and the patent system is dysfunctional,

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and as a result, most of these lawsuits end in settlements.

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And because these settlements are under a non-disclosure agreement,

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
no one knows what the terms were.

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And as a result, the patent troll can claim

24
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that they won the case.

25
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
In the case of Gooseberry Natural Resources,

26
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
this patent on emailing news releases

27
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
had sort of a fatal flaw

28
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
as it pertained to myself,

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and that was that in the mainstream media world

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
there is only one definition for news release,

31
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and it turns out that is press release --

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
as in P.R.

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Now my company, Fark,

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
deals with news, ostensibly,

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and as a result

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
we were not in violation of this patent.

37
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
So case closed, right?

38
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Wrong.

39
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
One of the major problems with patent law is that,

40
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
in the case that when you are sued by a patent troll,

41
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
the burden of proof that you did not infringe on the patent

42
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
is actually on the defendant,

43
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
which means you have to prove

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
that you do not infringe on the patent they're suing you on.

45
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And this can take quite a while.

46
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
You need to know that the average patent troll defense

47
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
costs two million dollars

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and takes 18 months when you win.

49
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
That is your best case outcome

50
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
when you get sued by a patent troll.

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Now I had hoped to team up with some of these larger companies

52
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
in order to defend against this lawsuit,

53
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
but one-by-one they settled out of the case,

54
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
even though -- and this is important --

55
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
none of these companies

56
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
infringed on this patent -- not a one of them.

57
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And they started settling out.

58
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
The reason they settled out

59
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
is because it's cheaper to settle than to fight the lawsuit --

60
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
clearly, two million dollars cheaper in some cases,

61
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and much worse if you actually lose.

62
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It would also constitute a massive distraction for management of a company,

63
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
especially a small eight-man shop like my company.

64
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Six months into the lawsuit,

65
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
we finally reached the discovery phase.

66
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And in discovery phase,

67
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
we asked the patent troll to please provide

68
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
screenshots of Fark

69
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
where the infringement of their patent

70
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
was actually occurring.

71
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Now perhaps it's because no such screenshots actually existed,

72
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
but suddenly Gooseberry wanted to settle.

73
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Their attorney:

74
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
"Ah, yes. My company's having a reorganization on our end."

75
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Never mind the fact

76
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that the address led to a strip mall somewhere in Northern L.A.

77
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
with no employees.

78
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
"And we'd like to go ahead and close this out.

79
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So would you mind giving us your best and final offer?"

80
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
My response:

81
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
"How about nothing?!"

82
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Applause)

83
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
We didn't have high hopes for that outcome.

84
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
(Laughter)

85
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
But they settled.

86
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
No counter offer.

87
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Now, as mentioned before,

88
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
one of the reasons I can talk to you about this

89
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
is because there's no non-disclosure agreement on this case.

90
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Now how did that happen?

91
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Well during the settlement process, when we received our copy, I struck it.

92
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
My attorney said, "Nah, no chance of that working."

93
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
It came back signed.

94
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Now why? You can call them.

95
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
They're not under NDA either.

96
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Now what did I learn from this case? Well, three things.

97
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
First of all, if you can,

98
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
don't fight the patent, fight the infringement.

99
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Patents are very difficult to overturn.

100
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Infringement is a lot easier to disprove.

101
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Secondly, make it clear from the beginning

102
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that either you have no money at all

103
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
or that you would rather spend money with your attorney fighting the troll

104
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
than actually giving them the money.

105
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Now the reason this works

106
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
is because patent trolls

107
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
are paid a percentage of what they're able to recover in settlements.

108
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
If it becomes clear to them that they cannot recover any money,

109
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
they become less interested in pursuing the case.

110
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Finally, make sure that you can tell them

111
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that you will make this process

112
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
as annoying and as painful

113
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and as difficult as possible for them.

114
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Now this is a tactic that patent trolls are supposed to use on people

115
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
to get their way.

116
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
It turns out, because they're paid on contingency,

117
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
it works really, really well in reverse.

118
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Don't forget that.

119
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So what does all this mean?

120
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Well to sum up,

121
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
it boils down to one thing:

122
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Don't negotiate with terrorists.

123
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
(Applause)

124
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Patent trolls have done more damage to the United States economy

125
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
than any domestic or foreign

126
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
terrorist organization in history

127
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
every year.

128
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And what do they do with that money?

129
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
They plow it right back into filing more troll lawsuits.

130
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Now this is the point in the Talk

131
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
where I'm supposed to come up with some kind of a solution for the patent system.

132
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And the problem with that

133
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
is that there are two very large industry groups

134
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
that have different outcomes in mind

135
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
for the patent system.

136
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
The health care industry

137
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
would like stronger protections for inventors.

138
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
The hi-tech industry

139
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
would like stronger protections for producers.

140
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And these goals aren't necessarily diametrically opposed, but they are at odds.

141
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And as a result, patent trolls can kind of live in the space in between.

142
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So unfortunately I'm not smart enough

143
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to have a solution for the patent troll problem.

144
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
However, I did have this idea,

145
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and it was kind of good.

146
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And I thought, "I should patent this."

147
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Laughter)

148
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Behold, patent infringement via mobile device --

149
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
defined as a computer which is not stationary.

150
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
My solution: award me this patent

151
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and I will troll them out of existence.

152
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Thank you.

153
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.095,000 --> 0:00:17,000
We live in a world increasingly tyrannized by the screen,

2
0:00:17.708,000 --> 0:00:2,000
by our phones, by our tablets, by our televisions and our computers.

3
0:00:21.664,000 --> 0:00:23,000
We can have any experience that we want,

4
0:00:23.991,000 --> 0:00:24,000
but feel nothing.

5
0:00:25.651,000 --> 0:00:26,000
We can have as many friends as we want,

6
0:00:27.598,000 --> 0:00:29,000
but have nobody to shake hands with.

7
0:00:31.667,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I want to take you to a different kind of world,

8
0:00:33.963,000 --> 0:00:34,000
the world of the imagination,

9
0:00:35.622,000 --> 0:00:39,000
where, using this most powerful tool that we have,

10
0:00:39.871,000 --> 0:00:42,000
we can transform both our physical surroundings,

11
0:00:43.089,000 --> 0:00:47,000
but in doing so, we can change forever how we feel

12
0:00:47.164,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and how we feel about the people that we share the planet with.

13
0:00:51.872,000 --> 0:00:55,000
My company, Artichoke, which I cofounded in 2006,

14
0:00:56.336,000 --> 0:00:58,000
was set up to create moments.

15
0:00:58.853,000 --> 0:01:01,000
We all have moments in our lives, and when we're on our deathbeds,

16
0:01:02.115,000 --> 0:01:04,000
we're not going to remember the daily commute to work

17
0:01:04.663,000 --> 0:01:05,000
on the number 38 bus

18
0:01:05.842,000 --> 0:01:08,000
or our struggle to find a parking space every day when we go to the shop.

19
0:01:09.674,000 --> 0:01:12,000
We're going to remember those moments when our kid took their first step

20
0:01:13.108,000 --> 0:01:15,000
or when we got picked for the football team

21
0:01:15.5,000 --> 0:01:16,000
or when we fell in love.

22
0:01:17.412,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So Artichoke exists to create moving, ephemeral moments

23
0:01:21.723,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that transform the physical world using the imagination of the artist

24
0:01:25.929,000 --> 0:01:28,000
to show us what is possible.

25
0:01:29.716,000 --> 0:01:31,000
We create beauty amongst ruins.

26
0:01:32.474,000 --> 0:01:33,000
We reexamine our history.

27
0:01:34.42,000 --> 0:01:36,000
We create moments to which everyone is invited,

28
0:01:37.125,000 --> 0:01:39,000
either to witness or to take part.

29
0:01:41.246,000 --> 0:01:43,000
It all started for me way back in the 1990s,

30
0:01:43.673,000 --> 0:01:47,000
when I was appointed as festival director in the tiny British city of Salisbury.

31
0:01:48.448,000 --> 0:01:49,000
You'll probably have heard of it.

32
0:01:50.373,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Here's the Salisbury Cathedral, and here's the nearby Stonehenge Monument,

33
0:01:54.34,000 --> 0:01:55,000
which is world-famous.

34
0:01:56.114,000 --> 0:02:,000
Salisbury is a city that's been dominated for hundreds of years by the Church,

35
0:02:00.432,000 --> 0:02:01,000
the Conservative Party

36
0:02:01.74,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and the army.

37
0:02:03.852,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It's a place where people really love to observe the rules.

38
0:02:07.552,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So picture me on my first year in the city,

39
0:02:10.536,000 --> 0:02:13,000
cycling the wrong way down a one-way street, late.

40
0:02:13.735,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I'm always late.

41
0:02:14.916,000 --> 0:02:16,000
It's a wonder I've even turned up today.

42
0:02:17.091,000 --> 0:02:18,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:18.649,000 --> 0:02:2,000
A little old lady on the sidewalk helpfully shouted at me,

44
0:02:21.576,000 --> 0:02:23,000
"My dear, you're going the wrong way!"

45
0:02:23.863,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Charmingly -- I thought -- I said, "Yeah, I know."

46
0:02:26.602,000 --> 0:02:27,000
"I hope you die!" she screamed.

47
0:02:28.608,000 --> 0:02:29,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:29.832,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And I realized that this was a place where I was in trouble.

49
0:02:33.164,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And yet, a year later,

50
0:02:36.017,000 --> 0:02:39,000
persuasion, negotiation -- everything I could deploy --

51
0:02:39.971,000 --> 0:02:4,000
saw me producing the work.

52
0:02:41.94,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Not a classical concert in a church or a poetry reading,

53
0:02:45.53,000 --> 0:02:47,000
but the work of a French street theater company

54
0:02:47.747,000 --> 0:02:48,000
who were telling the story of Faust,

55
0:02:49.526,000 --> 0:02:53,000
"Mephistomania," on stilts, complete with handheld pyrotechnics.

56
0:02:54.051,000 --> 0:02:57,000
The day after, the same little old lady stopped me in the street and said,

57
0:02:57.964,000 --> 0:03:,000
"Were you responsible for last night?"

58
0:03:01.461,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I backed away.

59
0:03:02.968,000 --> 0:03:03,000
(Laughter)

60
0:03:04.809,000 --> 0:03:05,000
"Yes."

61
0:03:06.963,000 --> 0:03:09,000
"When I heard about it," she said, "I knew it wasn't for me.

62
0:03:10.165,000 --> 0:03:12,000
But Helen, my dear, it was."

63
0:03:13.317,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So what had happened?

64
0:03:14.666,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Curiosity had triumphed over suspicion,

65
0:03:17.44,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and delight had banished anxiety.

66
0:03:20.574,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So I wondered how one could transfer these ideas to a larger stage

67
0:03:27.107,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and started on a journey to do the same kind of thing to London.

68
0:03:31.699,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Imagine: it's a world city.

69
0:03:33.587,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Like all our cities, it's dedicated to toil, trade and traffic.

70
0:03:37.625,000 --> 0:03:39,000
It's a machine to get you to work on time and back,

71
0:03:40.469,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and we're all complicit in wanting the routines to be fixed

72
0:03:44.805,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and for everybody to be able to know what's going to happen next.

73
0:03:48.84,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And yet, what if this amazing city could be turned into a stage,

74
0:03:53.362,000 --> 0:03:56,000
a platform for something so unimaginable

75
0:03:56.395,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that would somehow transform people's lives?

76
0:03:59.652,000 --> 0:04:,000
We do these things often in Britain.

77
0:04:01.424,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I'm sure you do them wherever you're from.

78
0:04:03.495,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Here's Horse Guards Parade.

79
0:04:05.198,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And here's something that we do often. It's always about winning things.

80
0:04:08.627,000 --> 0:04:1,000
It's about the marathon or winning a war

81
0:04:10.704,000 --> 0:04:12,000
or a triumphant cricket team coming home.

82
0:04:12.76,000 --> 0:04:14,000
We close the streets. Everybody claps.

83
0:04:15.416,000 --> 0:04:17,000
But for theater? Not possible.

84
0:04:18.408,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Except a story told by a French company:

85
0:04:22.403,000 --> 0:04:25,000
a saga about a little girl and a giant elephant

86
0:04:25.965,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that came to visit

87
0:04:28.288,000 --> 0:04:29,000
for four days.

88
0:04:29.668,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And all I had to do was persuade the public authorities

89
0:04:32.705,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that shutting the city for four days was something completely normal.

90
0:04:36.326,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Laughter)

91
0:04:37.741,000 --> 0:04:4,000
No traffic, just people enjoying themselves,

92
0:04:41.503,000 --> 0:04:44,000
coming out to marvel and witness this extraordinary artistic endeavor

93
0:04:45.427,000 --> 0:04:47,000
by the French theater company Royal de Luxe.

94
0:04:48.377,000 --> 0:04:5,000
It was a seven-year journey,

95
0:04:50.44,000 --> 0:04:54,000
with me saying to a group of men -- almost always men -- sitting in a room,

96
0:04:55.22,000 --> 0:05:,000
"Eh, it's like a fairy story with a little girl and this giant elephant,

97
0:05:00.567,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and they come to town for four days

98
0:05:02.941,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and everybody gets to come and watch and play."

99
0:05:06.709,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And they would go,

100
0:05:08.586,000 --> 0:05:09,000
"Why would we do this?

101
0:05:11.255,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Is it for something?

102
0:05:13.409,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Is it celebrating a presidential visit?

103
0:05:15.537,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Is it the Entente Cordiale between France and England?

104
0:05:18.375,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Is it for charity? Are you trying to raise money?"

105
0:05:21.343,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And I'd say,

106
0:05:23.794,000 --> 0:05:24,000
"None of these things."

107
0:05:25.866,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And they'd say, "Why would we do this?"

108
0:05:29.393,000 --> 0:05:32,000
But after four years, this magic trick, this extraordinary thing happened.

109
0:05:33.053,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I was sitting in the same meeting I'd been to for four years,

110
0:05:35.956,000 --> 0:05:36,000
saying, "Please, please, may I?"

111
0:05:37.542,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Instead of which, I didn't say, "Please."

112
0:05:39.581,000 --> 0:05:43,000
I said, "This thing that we've been talking about for such a long time,

113
0:05:43.806,000 --> 0:05:45,000
it's happening on these dates,

114
0:05:46.044,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and I really need you to help me."

115
0:05:48.69,000 --> 0:05:49,000
This magic thing happened.

116
0:05:50.253,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Everybody in the room somehow decided that somebody else had said yes.

117
0:05:54.828,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Laughter)

118
0:05:56.97,000 --> 0:05:59,000
(Applause)

119
0:06:01.675,000 --> 0:06:05,000
They decided that they were not being asked to take responsibility,

120
0:06:06.028,000 --> 0:06:09,000
or maybe the bus planning manager was being asked to take responsibility

121
0:06:09.536,000 --> 0:06:11,000
for planning the bus diversions,

122
0:06:11.565,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and the council officer was being asked to close the roads,

123
0:06:15.941,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and the transport for London people were being asked to sort out the Underground.

124
0:06:19.776,000 --> 0:06:22,000
All these people were only being asked to do the thing that they could do

125
0:06:23.261,000 --> 0:06:24,000
that would help us.

126
0:06:24.642,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Nobody was being asked to take responsibility.

127
0:06:26.902,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And I, in my innocence, thought, "Well, I'll take responsibility,"

128
0:06:31.201,000 --> 0:06:34,000
for what turned out to be a million people on the street.

129
0:06:35.51,000 --> 0:06:36,000
It was our first show.

130
0:06:36.929,000 --> 0:06:39,000
(Applause)

131
0:06:41.262,000 --> 0:06:45,000
It was our first show, and it changed the nature of the appreciation of culture,

132
0:06:46.247,000 --> 0:06:49,000
not in a gallery, not in a theater, not in an opera house,

133
0:06:49.521,000 --> 0:06:51,000
but live and on the streets,

134
0:06:51.547,000 --> 0:06:54,000
transforming public space for the broadest possible audience,

135
0:06:55.126,000 --> 0:06:57,000
people who would never buy a ticket to see anything.

136
0:06:57.995,000 --> 0:06:58,000
So there we were.

137
0:06:59.2,000 --> 0:07:03,000
We'd finished, and we've continued to produce work of this kind.

138
0:07:04.644,000 --> 0:07:07,000
As you can see, the company's work is astonishing,

139
0:07:07.94,000 --> 0:07:1,000
but what's also astonishing is the fact that permission was granted.

140
0:07:14.654,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And you don't see any security.

141
0:07:17.282,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And this was nine months after terrible terrorist bombings

142
0:07:20.725,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that had ripped London apart.

143
0:07:22.696,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So I began to wonder whether it was possible

144
0:07:24.887,000 --> 0:07:28,000
to do this kind of stuff in even more complicated circumstances.

145
0:07:29.078,000 --> 0:07:31,000
We turned our attention to Northern Ireland,

146
0:07:31.828,000 --> 0:07:33,000
the North of Ireland, depending on your point of view.

147
0:07:34.444,000 --> 0:07:38,000
This is a map of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland,

148
0:07:38.777,000 --> 0:07:39,000
the island to the left.

149
0:07:40.829,000 --> 0:07:42,000
For generations, it's been a place of conflict,

150
0:07:43.649,000 --> 0:07:46,000
the largely Catholic republic in the south

151
0:07:46.706,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and the largely Protestant loyalist community --

152
0:07:50.383,000 --> 0:07:52,000
hundreds of years of conflict,

153
0:07:53.53,000 --> 0:07:55,000
British troops on the streets for over 30 years.

154
0:07:56.518,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And now, although there is a peace process,

155
0:07:59.53,000 --> 0:08:03,000
this is today in this city, called Londonderry if you're a loyalist,

156
0:08:03.622,000 --> 0:08:05,000
called Derry if you're a Catholic.

157
0:08:07.753,000 --> 0:08:09,000
But everybody calls it home.

158
0:08:09.779,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And I began to wonder

159
0:08:10.986,000 --> 0:08:14,000
whether there was a way in which the community tribalism could be addressed

160
0:08:15.538,000 --> 0:08:17,000
through art and the imagination.

161
0:08:18.77,000 --> 0:08:19,000
This is what the communities do,

162
0:08:20.335,000 --> 0:08:21,000
every summer, each community.

163
0:08:21.933,000 --> 0:08:25,000
This is a bonfire filled with effigies and insignia

164
0:08:25.963,000 --> 0:08:27,000
from the people that they hate on the other side.

165
0:08:28.45,000 --> 0:08:3,000
This is the same from the loyalist community.

166
0:08:31.435,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And every summer, they burn them.

167
0:08:35.784,000 --> 0:08:36,000
They're right in the center of town.

168
0:08:37.553,000 --> 0:08:41,000
So we turned to here, to the Nevada desert, to Burning Man,

169
0:08:41.862,000 --> 0:08:42,000
where people also do bonfires,

170
0:08:43.414,000 --> 0:08:45,000
but with a completely different set of values.

171
0:08:46.291,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Here you see the work of David Best and his extraordinary temples,

172
0:08:51.159,000 --> 0:08:54,000
which are built during the Burning Man event

173
0:08:54.247,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and then incinerated on the Sunday.

174
0:08:56.888,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So we invited him and his community to come,

175
0:08:59.656,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and we recruited from both sides of the political and religious divide:

176
0:09:04.475,000 --> 0:09:05,000
young people, unemployed people,

177
0:09:06.391,000 --> 0:09:08,000
people who would never normally come across each other

178
0:09:09.127,000 --> 0:09:1,000
or speak to each other.

179
0:09:10.709,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And out of their extraordinary work rose a temple

180
0:09:14.543,000 --> 0:09:17,000
to rival the two cathedrals that exist in the town,

181
0:09:17.885,000 --> 0:09:19,000
one Catholic and one Protestant.

182
0:09:20.035,000 --> 0:09:23,000
But this was a temple to no religion,

183
0:09:23.236,000 --> 0:09:24,000
for everyone,

184
0:09:24.641,000 --> 0:09:26,000
for no community, but for everyone.

185
0:09:27.625,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And we put it in this place where everyone told me nobody would come.

186
0:09:30.909,000 --> 0:09:32,000
It was too dangerous. It sat between two communities.

187
0:09:33.466,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I just kept saying, "But it's got such a great view."

188
0:09:35.976,000 --> 0:09:37,000
(Laughter)

189
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And again, that same old question:

190
0:09:39.688,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Why wouldn't we do this?

191
0:09:41.434,000 --> 0:09:42,000
What you see in the picture

192
0:09:42.771,000 --> 0:09:44,000
is the beginning of 426 primary school children

193
0:09:45.655,000 --> 0:09:47,000
who were walked up the hill by the head teacher,

194
0:09:48.424,000 --> 0:09:5,000
who didn't want them to lose this opportunity.

195
0:09:51.251,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And just as happens in the Nevada desert,

196
0:09:53.685,000 --> 0:09:55,000
though in slightly different temperatures,

197
0:09:56.178,000 --> 0:09:59,000
the people of this community, 65,000 of them,

198
0:09:59.915,000 --> 0:10:04,000
turned out to write their grief, their pain, their hope,

199
0:10:05.296,000 --> 0:10:06,000
their hopes for the future,

200
0:10:07.107,000 --> 0:10:08,000
their love.

201
0:10:08.319,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Because in the end, this is only about love.

202
0:10:11.032,000 --> 0:10:13,000
They live in a post-conflict society:

203
0:10:13.629,000 --> 0:10:15,000
lots of post-traumatic stress,

204
0:10:15.783,000 --> 0:10:16,000
high suicide.

205
0:10:16.992,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And yet, for this brief moment --

206
0:10:19.101,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and it would be ridiculous to assume that it was more than that --

207
0:10:22.296,000 --> 0:10:26,000
somebody like Kevin -- a Catholic whose father was shot when he was nine,

208
0:10:26.806,000 --> 0:10:27,000
upstairs in bed --

209
0:10:29.189,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Kevin came to work as a volunteer.

210
0:10:31.168,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And he was the first person to embrace the elderly Protestant lady

211
0:10:34.861,000 --> 0:10:38,000
who came through the door on the day we opened the temple to the public.

212
0:10:40.185,000 --> 0:10:43,000
It rose up. It sat there for five days.

213
0:10:43.221,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And then we chose -- from our little tiny band of nonsectarian builders,

214
0:10:49.138,000 --> 0:10:52,000
who had given us their lives for this period of months

215
0:10:52.276,000 --> 0:10:54,000
to make this extraordinary thing --

216
0:10:55.788,000 --> 0:10:58,000
we chose from them the people who would incinerate it.

217
0:10:59.926,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And here you see the moment when,

218
0:11:02.682,000 --> 0:11:08,000
witnessed by 15,000 people who turned out on a dark, cold, March evening,

219
0:11:09.532,000 --> 0:11:14,000
the moment when they decided to put their enmity behind them,

220
0:11:15.444,000 --> 0:11:18,000
to inhabit this shared space,

221
0:11:19.369,000 --> 0:11:23,000
where everybody had an opportunity to say the things that had been unsayable,

222
0:11:24.19,000 --> 0:11:25,000
to say out loud,

223
0:11:25.423,000 --> 0:11:28,000
"You hurt me and my family, but I forgive you."

224
0:11:28.704,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And together, they watched

225
0:11:32.416,000 --> 0:11:35,000
as members of their community let go of this thing that was so beautiful,

226
0:11:37.394,000 --> 0:11:39,000
but was as hard to let go of

227
0:11:40.077,000 --> 0:11:42,000
as those thoughts and feelings

228
0:11:43.063,000 --> 0:11:45,000
that had gone into making it.

229
0:11:47.163,000 --> 0:11:51,000
(Music)

230
0:11:57.487,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Thank you.

231
0:11:58.964,000 --> 0:12:04,000
(Applause)

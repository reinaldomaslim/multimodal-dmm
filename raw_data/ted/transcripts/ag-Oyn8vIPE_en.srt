0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Hi. I'm here to talk to you about the importance of

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
praise, admiration and thank you,

3
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and having it be specific and genuine.

4
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And the way I got interested in this was,

5
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I noticed in myself, when I was growing up,

6
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and until about a few years ago,

7
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
that I would want to say thank you to someone,

8
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I would want to praise them,

9
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I would want to take in their praise of me

10
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and I'd just stop it.

11
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And I asked myself, why?

12
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I felt shy, I felt embarrassed.

13
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And then my question became,

14
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
am I the only one who does this?

15
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So, I decided to investigate.

16
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I'm fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility,

17
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
so I get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction.

18
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
And sometimes it comes down to something as simple as,

19
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
their core wound is their father died without ever saying he's proud of them.

20
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
But then, they hear from all the family and friends

21
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him,

22
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
but he never told the son.

23
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
It's because he didn't know that his son needed to hear it.

24
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So my question is, why don't we ask for the things that we need?

25
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I know a gentleman, married for 25 years,

26
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
who's longing to hear his wife say,

27
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
"Thank you for being the breadwinner, so I can stay home with the kids,"

28
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
but won't ask.

29
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I know a woman who's good at this.

30
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
She, once a week, meets with her husband and says,

31
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
"I'd really like you to thank me for all these things I did in the house and with the kids."

32
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And he goes, "Oh, this is great, this is great."

33
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And praise really does have to be genuine,

34
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
but she takes responsibility for that.

35
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And a friend of mine, April, who I've had since kindergarten,

36
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
she thanks her children for doing their chores.

37
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And she said, "Why wouldn't I thank it, even though they're supposed to do it?"

38
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So, the question is, why was I blocking it?

39
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Why were other people blocking it?

40
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Why can I say, "I'll take my steak medium rare,

41
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I need size six shoes," but I won't say,

42
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
"Would you praise me this way?"

43
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And it's because I'm giving you critical data about me.

44
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I'm telling you where I'm insecure.

45
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I'm telling you where I need your help.

46
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And I'm treating you, my inner circle,

47
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
like you're the enemy.

48
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Because what can you do with that data?

49
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
You could neglect me.

50
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
You could abuse it.

51
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Or you could actually meet my need.

52
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And I took my bike into the bike store-- I love this --

53
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
same bike, and they'd do something called "truing" the wheels.

54
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
The guy said, "You know, when you true the wheels,

55
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
it's going to make the bike so much better."

56
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I get the same bike back,

57
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and they've taken all the little warps out of those same wheels

58
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I've had for two and a half years, and my bike is like new.

59
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So, I'm going to challenge all of you.

60
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I want you to true your wheels:

61
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
be honest about the praise that you need to hear.

62
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
What do you need to hear? Go home to your wife --

63
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
go ask her, what does she need?

64
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Go home to your husband -- what does he need?

65
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Go home and ask those questions, and then help the people around you.

66
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And it's simple.

67
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And why should we care about this?

68
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
We talk about world peace.

69
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
How can we have world peace with different cultures, different languages?

70
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I think it starts household by household, under the same roof.

71
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So, let's make it right in our own backyard.

72
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And I want to thank all of you in the audience

73
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
for being great husbands, great mothers,

74
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
friends, daughters, sons.

75
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And maybe somebody's never said that to you,

76
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
but you've done a really, really good job.

77
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And thank you for being here, just showing up

78
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and changing the world with your ideas.

79
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Thank you.

80
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.954,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm here today to talk about the two ideas that,

2
0:00:15.904,000 --> 0:00:17,000
at least based on my observations at Khan Academy,

3
0:00:18.286,000 --> 0:00:21,000
are kind of the core, or the key leverage points for learning.

4
0:00:22.188,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And it's the idea of mastery

5
0:00:24.228,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and the idea of mindset.

6
0:00:26.037,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I saw this in the early days working with my cousins.

7
0:00:28.895,000 --> 0:00:3,000
A lot of them were having trouble with math at first,

8
0:00:31.399,000 --> 0:00:34,000
because they had all of these gaps accumulated in their learning.

9
0:00:34.477,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And because of that, at some point they got to an algebra class

10
0:00:37.49,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and they might have been a little bit shaky on some of the pre-algebra,

11
0:00:40.916,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and because of that, they thought they didn't have the math gene.

12
0:00:44.385,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Or they'd get to a calculus class,

13
0:00:46.072,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and they'd be a little bit shaky on the algebra.

14
0:00:48.858,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I saw it in the early days

15
0:00:50.452,000 --> 0:00:53,000
when I was uploading some of those videos on YouTube,

16
0:00:54.004,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and I realized that people who were not my cousins were watching.

17
0:00:57.305,000 --> 0:00:58,000
(Laughter)

18
0:00:59.194,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And at first, those comments were just simple thank-yous.

19
0:01:03.084,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I thought that was a pretty big deal.

20
0:01:05.077,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I don't know how much time you all spend on YouTube.

21
0:01:07.553,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Most of the comments are not "Thank you."

22
0:01:09.664,000 --> 0:01:1,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:11.145,000 --> 0:01:12,000
They're a little edgier than that.

24
0:01:12.807,000 --> 0:01:14,000
But then the comments got a little more intense,

25
0:01:15.262,000 --> 0:01:19,000
student after student saying that they had grown up not liking math.

26
0:01:19.742,000 --> 0:01:22,000
It was getting difficult as they got into more advanced math topics.

27
0:01:22.965,000 --> 0:01:23,000
By the time they got to algebra,

28
0:01:24.517,000 --> 0:01:27,000
they had so many gaps in their knowledge they couldn't engage with it.

29
0:01:27.869,000 --> 0:01:29,000
They thought they didn't have the math gene.

30
0:01:29.966,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But when they were a bit older,

31
0:01:31.47,000 --> 0:01:33,000
they took a little agency and decided to engage.

32
0:01:33.737,000 --> 0:01:34,000
They found resources like Khan Academy

33
0:01:35.613,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and they were able to fill in those gaps and master those concepts,

34
0:01:38.787,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and that reinforced their mindset that it wasn't fixed;

35
0:01:41.401,000 --> 0:01:44,000
that they actually were capable of learning mathematics.

36
0:01:44.99,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And in a lot of ways, this is how you would master a lot of things in life.

37
0:01:49.067,000 --> 0:01:51,000
It's the way you would learn a martial art.

38
0:01:51.39,000 --> 0:01:54,000
In a martial art, you would practice the white belt skills

39
0:01:54.58,000 --> 0:01:55,000
as long as necessary,

40
0:01:56.017,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and only when you've mastered it

41
0:01:57.592,000 --> 0:01:59,000
you would move on to become a yellow belt.

42
0:01:59.751,000 --> 0:02:01,000
It's the way you learn a musical instrument:

43
0:02:01.846,000 --> 0:02:03,000
you practice the basic piece over and over again,

44
0:02:04.164,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and only when you've mastered it,

45
0:02:05.776,000 --> 0:02:06,000
you go on to the more advanced one.

46
0:02:07.471,000 --> 0:02:08,000
But what we point out --

47
0:02:08.835,000 --> 0:02:12,000
this is not the way a traditional academic model is structured,

48
0:02:13.344,000 --> 0:02:16,000
the type of academic model that most of us grew up in.

49
0:02:16.703,000 --> 0:02:17,000
In a traditional academic model,

50
0:02:18.269,000 --> 0:02:2,000
we group students together, usually by age,

51
0:02:20.712,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and around middle school,

52
0:02:22.015,000 --> 0:02:23,000
by age and perceived ability,

53
0:02:23.885,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and we shepherd them all together at the same pace.

54
0:02:27.038,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And what typically happens,

55
0:02:28.359,000 --> 0:02:3,000
let's say we're in a middle school pre-algebra class,

56
0:02:30.884,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and the current unit is on exponents,

57
0:02:32.702,000 --> 0:02:34,000
the teacher will give a lecture on exponents,

58
0:02:34.916,000 --> 0:02:36,000
then we'll go home, do some homework.

59
0:02:37.225,000 --> 0:02:39,000
The next morning, we'll review the homework,

60
0:02:39.303,000 --> 0:02:41,000
then another lecture, homework, lecture, homework.

61
0:02:41.675,000 --> 0:02:43,000
That will continue for about two or three weeks,

62
0:02:43.96,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and then we get a test.

63
0:02:45.159,000 --> 0:02:48,000
On that test, maybe I get a 75 percent,

64
0:02:48.501,000 --> 0:02:49,000
maybe you get a 90 percent,

65
0:02:49.942,000 --> 0:02:5,000
maybe you get a 95 percent.

66
0:02:51.95,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And even though the test identified gaps in our knowledge,

67
0:02:54.721,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I didn't know 25 percent of the material.

68
0:02:56.704,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Even the A student, what was the five percent they didn't know?

69
0:02:59.7,000 --> 0:03:,000
Even though we've identified the gaps,

70
0:03:01.537,000 --> 0:03:03,000
the whole class will then move on to the next subject,

71
0:03:04.099,000 --> 0:03:07,000
probably a more advanced subject that's going to build on those gaps.

72
0:03:07.525,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It might be logarithms or negative exponents.

73
0:03:10.922,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And that process continues, and you immediately start to realize

74
0:03:13.977,000 --> 0:03:14,000
how strange this is.

75
0:03:15.176,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I didn't know 25 percent of the more foundational thing,

76
0:03:17.971,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and now I'm being pushed to the more advanced thing.

77
0:03:20.44,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And this will continue for months, years, all the way until at some point,

78
0:03:24.176,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I might be in an algebra class or trigonometry class

79
0:03:26.64,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and I hit a wall.

80
0:03:27.921,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And it's not because algebra is fundamentally difficult

81
0:03:30.599,000 --> 0:03:33,000
or because the student isn't bright.

82
0:03:34.615,000 --> 0:03:37,000
It's because I'm seeing an equation and they're dealing with exponents

83
0:03:37.95,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and that 30 percent that I didn't know is showing up.

84
0:03:40.703,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And then I start to disengage.

85
0:03:44.469,000 --> 0:03:47,000
To appreciate how absurd that is,

86
0:03:47.919,000 --> 0:03:49,000
imagine if we did other things in our life that way.

87
0:03:51.124,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Say, home-building.

88
0:03:52.602,000 --> 0:03:54,000
(Laughter)

89
0:03:56.878,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So we bring in the contractor and say,

90
0:04:00.296,000 --> 0:04:02,000
"We were told we have two weeks to build a foundation.

91
0:04:02.868,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Do what you can."

92
0:04:04.228,000 --> 0:04:06,000
(Laughter)

93
0:04:06.985,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So they do what they can.

94
0:04:08.801,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Maybe it rains.

95
0:04:09.981,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Maybe some of the supplies don't show up.

96
0:04:11.974,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And two weeks later, the inspector comes, looks around,

97
0:04:15.308,000 --> 0:04:17,000
says, "OK, the concrete is still wet right over there,

98
0:04:17.997,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that part's not quite up to code ...

99
0:04:20.838,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I'll give it an 80 percent."

100
0:04:22.22,000 --> 0:04:23,000
(Laughter)

101
0:04:23.308,000 --> 0:04:25,000
You say, "Great! That's a C. Let's build the first floor."

102
0:04:26.067,000 --> 0:04:27,000
(Laughter)

103
0:04:27.109,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Same thing.

104
0:04:28.287,000 --> 0:04:31,000
We have two weeks, do what you can, inspector shows up, it's a 75 percent.

105
0:04:32.15,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Great, that's a D-plus.

106
0:04:33.333,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Second floor, third floor,

107
0:04:34.603,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and all of a sudden, while you're building the third floor,

108
0:04:37.405,000 --> 0:04:38,000
the whole structure collapses.

109
0:04:38.865,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And if your reaction is the reaction you typically have in education,

110
0:04:42.133,000 --> 0:04:43,000
or that a lot of folks have,

111
0:04:43.498,000 --> 0:04:45,000
you might say, maybe we had a bad contractor,

112
0:04:45.628,000 --> 0:04:48,000
or maybe we needed better inspection or more frequent inspection.

113
0:04:48.745,000 --> 0:04:5,000
But what was really broken was the process.

114
0:04:51.018,000 --> 0:04:54,000
We were artificially constraining how long we had to something,

115
0:04:54.071,000 --> 0:04:56,000
pretty much ensuring a variable outcome,

116
0:04:56.468,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and we took the trouble of inspecting and identifying those gaps,

117
0:05:00.016,000 --> 0:05:01,000
but then we built right on top of it.

118
0:05:01.973,000 --> 0:05:03,000
So the idea of mastery learning is to do the exact opposite.

119
0:05:04.934,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Instead of artificially constraining, fixing

120
0:05:07.426,000 --> 0:05:08,000
when and how long you work on something,

121
0:05:09.438,000 --> 0:05:11,000
pretty much ensuring that variable outcome,

122
0:05:11.68,000 --> 0:05:12,000
the A, B, C, D, F --

123
0:05:13.98,000 --> 0:05:14,000
do it the other way around.

124
0:05:15.844,000 --> 0:05:16,000
What's variable is when and how long

125
0:05:17.66,000 --> 0:05:19,000
a student actually has to work on something,

126
0:05:19.778,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and what's fixed is that they actually master the material.

127
0:05:23.445,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And it's important to realize

128
0:05:25.12,000 --> 0:05:28,000
that not only will this make the student learn their exponents better,

129
0:05:28.509,000 --> 0:05:3,000
but it'll reinforce the right mindset muscles.

130
0:05:31.491,000 --> 0:05:34,000
It makes them realize that if you got 20 percent wrong on something,

131
0:05:34.943,000 --> 0:05:37,000
it doesn't mean that you have a C branded in your DNA somehow.

132
0:05:38.356,000 --> 0:05:4,000
It means that you should just keep working on it.

133
0:05:40.814,000 --> 0:05:42,000
You should have grit; you should have perseverance;

134
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
you should take agency over your learning.

135
0:05:45.908,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Now, a lot of skeptics might say, well, hey, this is all great,

136
0:05:48.922,000 --> 0:05:5,000
philosophically, this whole idea of mastery-based learning

137
0:05:51.667,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and its connection to mindset,

138
0:05:53.127,000 --> 0:05:55,000
students taking agency over their learning.

139
0:05:55.25,000 --> 0:05:58,000
It makes a lot of sense, but it seems impractical.

140
0:05:58.409,000 --> 0:06:01,000
To actually do it, every student would be on their own track.

141
0:06:01.83,000 --> 0:06:02,000
It would have to be personalized,

142
0:06:03.478,000 --> 0:06:06,000
you'd have to have private tutors and worksheets for every student.

143
0:06:06.684,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And these aren't new ideas --

144
0:06:08.207,000 --> 0:06:1,000
there were experiments in Winnetka, Illinois, 100 years ago,

145
0:06:11.057,000 --> 0:06:13,000
where they did mastery-based learning and saw great results,

146
0:06:13.899,000 --> 0:06:16,000
but they said it wouldn't scale because it was logistically difficult.

147
0:06:17.22,000 --> 0:06:19,000
The teacher had to give different worksheets to every student,

148
0:06:20.151,000 --> 0:06:21,000
give on-demand assessments.

149
0:06:21.463,000 --> 0:06:23,000
But now today, it's no longer impractical.

150
0:06:23.748,000 --> 0:06:24,000
We have the tools to do it.

151
0:06:25.138,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Students see an explanation at their own time and pace?

152
0:06:27.757,000 --> 0:06:28,000
There's on-demand video for that.

153
0:06:29.376,000 --> 0:06:31,000
They need practice? They need feedback?

154
0:06:31.472,000 --> 0:06:35,000
There's adaptive exercises readily available for students.

155
0:06:36.311,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And when that happens, all sorts of neat things happen.

156
0:06:38.929,000 --> 0:06:4,000
One, the students can actually master the concepts,

157
0:06:41.726,000 --> 0:06:43,000
but they're also building their growth mindset,

158
0:06:43.945,000 --> 0:06:44,000
they're building grit, perseverance,

159
0:06:45.766,000 --> 0:06:47,000
they're taking agency over their learning.

160
0:06:47.813,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And all sorts of beautiful things can start to happen

161
0:06:50.394,000 --> 0:06:51,000
in the actual classroom.

162
0:06:52.054,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Instead of it being focused on the lecture,

163
0:06:54.136,000 --> 0:06:55,000
students can interact with each other.

164
0:06:55.978,000 --> 0:06:57,000
They can get deeper mastery over the material.

165
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
They can go into simulations, Socratic dialogue.

166
0:07:00.537,000 --> 0:07:02,000
To appreciate what we're talking about

167
0:07:03.24,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and the tragedy of lost potential here,

168
0:07:07.311,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I'd like to give a little bit of a thought experiment.

169
0:07:10.985,000 --> 0:07:15,000
If we were to go 400 years into the past to Western Europe,

170
0:07:16.075,000 --> 0:07:19,000
which even then, was one of the more literate parts of the planet,

171
0:07:19.263,000 --> 0:07:22,000
you would see that about 15 percent of the population knew how to read.

172
0:07:23.556,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And I suspect that if you asked someone who did know how to read,

173
0:07:27.218,000 --> 0:07:28,000
say a member of the clergy,

174
0:07:29.138,000 --> 0:07:32,000
"What percentage of the population do you think is even capable of reading?"

175
0:07:32.774,000 --> 0:07:35,000
They might say, "Well, with a great education system,

176
0:07:36.359,000 --> 0:07:38,000
maybe 20 or 30 percent."

177
0:07:39.424,000 --> 0:07:4,000
But if you fast forward to today,

178
0:07:41.035,000 --> 0:07:44,000
we know that that prediction would have been wildly pessimistic,

179
0:07:44.074,000 --> 0:07:48,000
that pretty close to 100 percent of the population is capable of reading.

180
0:07:48.223,000 --> 0:07:5,000
But if I were to ask you a similar question:

181
0:07:51.494,000 --> 0:07:54,000
"What percentage of the population do you think is capable

182
0:07:55.057,000 --> 0:07:57,000
of truly mastering calculus,

183
0:07:57.954,000 --> 0:08:,000
or understanding organic chemistry,

184
0:08:00.991,000 --> 0:08:03,000
or being able to contribute to cancer research?"

185
0:08:04.301,000 --> 0:08:06,000
A lot of you might say, "Well, with a great education system,

186
0:08:07.222,000 --> 0:08:09,000
maybe 20, 30 percent."

187
0:08:09.778,000 --> 0:08:1,000
But what if that estimate

188
0:08:11.115,000 --> 0:08:14,000
is just based on your own experience in a non-mastery framework,

189
0:08:14.526,000 --> 0:08:16,000
your own experience with yourself or observing your peers,

190
0:08:17.382,000 --> 0:08:19,000
where you're being pushed at this set pace through classes,

191
0:08:20.195,000 --> 0:08:21,000
accumulating all these gaps?

192
0:08:21.558,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Even when you got that 95 percent,

193
0:08:23.223,000 --> 0:08:24,000
what was that five percent you missed?

194
0:08:25.059,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And it keeps accumulating -- you get to an advanced class,

195
0:08:27.81,000 --> 0:08:28,000
all of a sudden you hit a wall and say,

196
0:08:29.706,000 --> 0:08:31,000
"I'm not meant to be a cancer researcher;

197
0:08:31.733,000 --> 0:08:33,000
not meant to be a physicist; not meant to be a mathematician."

198
0:08:34.685,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I suspect that that actually is the case,

199
0:08:36.686,000 --> 0:08:39,000
but if you were allowed to be operating in a mastery framework,

200
0:08:40.536,000 --> 0:08:43,000
if you were allowed to really take agency over your learning,

201
0:08:43.977,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and when you get something wrong,

202
0:08:45.597,000 --> 0:08:47,000
embrace it -- view that failure as a moment of learning --

203
0:08:48.413,000 --> 0:08:51,000
that number, the percent that could really master calculus

204
0:08:52.394,000 --> 0:08:53,000
or understand organic chemistry,

205
0:08:54.178,000 --> 0:08:56,000
is actually a lot closer to 100 percent.

206
0:08:57.601,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And this isn't even just a "nice to have."

207
0:09:01.019,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I think it's a social imperative.

208
0:09:03.511,000 --> 0:09:06,000
We're exiting what you could call the industrial age

209
0:09:07.386,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and we're going into this information revolution.

210
0:09:11.646,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And it's clear that some things are happening.

211
0:09:13.844,000 --> 0:09:15,000
In the industrial age, society was a pyramid.

212
0:09:15.981,000 --> 0:09:19,000
At the base of the pyramid, you needed human labor.

213
0:09:21.085,000 --> 0:09:24,000
In the middle of the pyramid, you had an information processing,

214
0:09:24.442,000 --> 0:09:25,000
a bureaucracy class,

215
0:09:26.064,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and at the top of the pyramid, you had your owners of capital

216
0:09:29.762,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and your entrepreneurs

217
0:09:31.785,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and your creative class.

218
0:09:33.904,000 --> 0:09:34,000
But we know what's happening already,

219
0:09:35.724,000 --> 0:09:37,000
as we go into this information revolution.

220
0:09:37.763,000 --> 0:09:39,000
The bottom of that pyramid, automation, is going to take over.

221
0:09:40.74,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Even that middle tier, information processing,

222
0:09:43.089,000 --> 0:09:44,000
that's what computers are good at.

223
0:09:44.739,000 --> 0:09:45,000
So as a society, we have a question:

224
0:09:46.51,000 --> 0:09:49,000
All this new productivity is happening because of this technology,

225
0:09:49.652,000 --> 0:09:5,000
but who participates in it?

226
0:09:51.006,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Is it just going to be that very top of the pyramid, in which case,

227
0:09:54.225,000 --> 0:09:55,000
what does everyone else do?

228
0:09:55.59,000 --> 0:09:56,000
How do they operate?

229
0:09:56.78,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Or do we do something that's more aspirational?

230
0:09:59.581,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Do we actually attempt to invert the pyramid,

231
0:10:02.715,000 --> 0:10:04,000
where you have a large creative class,

232
0:10:04.74,000 --> 0:10:07,000
where almost everyone can participate as an entrepreneur,

233
0:10:08.445,000 --> 0:10:09,000
an artist, as a researcher?

234
0:10:10.85,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And I don't think that this is utopian.

235
0:10:12.804,000 --> 0:10:14,000
I really think that this is all based on the idea

236
0:10:15.192,000 --> 0:10:17,000
that if we let people tap into their potential

237
0:10:17.4,000 --> 0:10:18,000
by mastering concepts,

238
0:10:19.388,000 --> 0:10:22,000
by being able to exercise agency over their learning,

239
0:10:22.989,000 --> 0:10:23,000
that they can get there.

240
0:10:24.672,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And when you think of it as just a citizen of the world,

241
0:10:28.696,000 --> 0:10:29,000
it's pretty exciting.

242
0:10:29.983,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I mean, think about the type of equity we can we have,

243
0:10:32.635,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and the rate at which civilization could even progress.

244
0:10:36.339,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And so, I'm pretty optimistic about it.

245
0:10:38.576,000 --> 0:10:41,000
I think it's going to be a pretty exciting time to be alive.

246
0:10:42.163,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Thank you.

247
0:10:43.353,000 --> 0:10:48,000
(Applause)

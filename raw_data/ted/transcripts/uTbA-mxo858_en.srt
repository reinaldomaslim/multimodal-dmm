1
0:00:14.366,000 --> 0:00:19,000
(Nature sounds)

2
0:00:19.82,000 --> 0:00:21,000
When I first began recording wild soundscapes

3
0:00:22.536,000 --> 0:00:23,000
45 years ago,

4
0:00:24.467,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I had no idea that ants,

5
0:00:26.889,000 --> 0:00:29,000
insect larvae, sea anemones and viruses

6
0:00:30.368,000 --> 0:00:32,000
created a sound signature.

7
0:00:32.496,000 --> 0:00:33,000
But they do.

8
0:00:33.939,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And so does every wild habitat on the planet,

9
0:00:37.352,000 --> 0:00:4,000
like the Amazon rainforest you're hearing behind me.

10
0:00:40.587,000 --> 0:00:43,000
In fact, temperate and tropical rainforests

11
0:00:44.161,000 --> 0:00:47,000
each produce a vibrant animal orchestra,

12
0:00:47.341,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that instantaneous and organized expression

13
0:00:50.569,000 --> 0:00:54,000
of insects, reptiles, amphibians, birds and mammals.

14
0:00:55.377,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And every soundscape that springs from a wild habitat

15
0:00:58.304,000 --> 0:01:01,000
generates its own unique signature,

16
0:01:01.896,000 --> 0:01:03,000
one that contains incredible amounts of information,

17
0:01:04.813,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and it's some of that information I want to share with you today.

18
0:01:09.172,000 --> 0:01:12,000
The soundscape is made up of three basic sources.

19
0:01:12.378,000 --> 0:01:14,000
The first is the geophony,

20
0:01:14.917,000 --> 0:01:16,000
or the nonbiological sounds that occur

21
0:01:17.283,000 --> 0:01:18,000
in any given habitat,

22
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
like wind in the trees, water in a stream,

23
0:01:21.852,000 --> 0:01:24,000
waves at the ocean shore, movement of the Earth.

24
0:01:25.446,000 --> 0:01:28,000
The second of these is the biophony.

25
0:01:28.724,000 --> 0:01:31,000
The biophony is all of the sound

26
0:01:31.846,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that's generated by organisms in a given habitat

27
0:01:34.964,000 --> 0:01:37,000
at one time and in one place.

28
0:01:38.584,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And the third is all of the sound that we humans generate

29
0:01:43.118,000 --> 0:01:44,000
that's called anthrophony.

30
0:01:44.936,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Some of it is controlled, like music or theater,

31
0:01:48.297,000 --> 0:01:51,000
but most of it is chaotic and incoherent,

32
0:01:52.214,000 --> 0:01:55,000
which some of us refer to as noise.

33
0:01:55.919,000 --> 0:01:57,000
There was a time when I considered wild soundscapes

34
0:01:58.619,000 --> 0:01:59,000
to be a worthless artifact.

35
0:02:00.351,000 --> 0:02:04,000
They were just there, but they had no significance.

36
0:02:04.433,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Well, I was wrong. What I learned from these encounters

37
0:02:07.806,000 --> 0:02:11,000
was that careful listening gives us incredibly valuable tools

38
0:02:12.582,000 --> 0:02:14,000
by which to evaluate the health of a habitat

39
0:02:15.166,000 --> 0:02:18,000
across the entire spectrum of life.

40
0:02:18.978,000 --> 0:02:21,000
When I began recording in the late '60s,

41
0:02:22.19,000 --> 0:02:25,000
the typical methods of recording were limited

42
0:02:25.466,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to the fragmented capture of individual species

43
0:02:29.934,000 --> 0:02:32,000
like birds mostly, in the beginning,

44
0:02:33.03,000 --> 0:02:38,000
but later animals like mammals and amphibians.

45
0:02:38.731,000 --> 0:02:41,000
To me, this was a little like trying to understand

46
0:02:42.243,000 --> 0:02:45,000
the magnificence of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony

47
0:02:45.308,000 --> 0:02:47,000
by abstracting the sound of a single violin player

48
0:02:48.217,000 --> 0:02:5,000
out of the context of the orchestra

49
0:02:50.787,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and hearing just that one part.

50
0:02:53.89,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Fortunately, more and more institutions

51
0:02:56.907,000 --> 0:02:58,000
are implementing the more holistic models

52
0:02:58.975,000 --> 0:03:,000
that I and a few of my colleagues have introduced

53
0:03:01.338,000 --> 0:03:04,000
to the field of soundscape ecology.

54
0:03:05.211,000 --> 0:03:1,000
When I began recording over four decades ago,

55
0:03:10.279,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I could record for 10 hours

56
0:03:12.688,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and capture one hour of usable material,

57
0:03:14.923,000 --> 0:03:17,000
good enough for an album or a film soundtrack

58
0:03:17.98,000 --> 0:03:19,000
or a museum installation.

59
0:03:20.699,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Now, because of global warming,

60
0:03:23.652,000 --> 0:03:24,000
resource extraction,

61
0:03:25.07,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and human noise, among many other factors,

62
0:03:28.139,000 --> 0:03:3,000
it can take up to 1,000 hours or more

63
0:03:30.815,000 --> 0:03:32,000
to capture the same thing.

64
0:03:33.648,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Fully 50 percent of my archive

65
0:03:36.703,000 --> 0:03:39,000
comes from habitats so radically altered

66
0:03:39.899,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that they're either altogether silent

67
0:03:42.799,000 --> 0:03:46,000
or can no longer be heard in any of their original form.

68
0:03:47.52,000 --> 0:03:49,000
The usual methods of evaluating a habitat

69
0:03:49.806,000 --> 0:03:52,000
have been done by visually counting the numbers of species

70
0:03:53.132,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and the numbers of individuals within each species in a given area.

71
0:03:57.337,000 --> 0:04:,000
However, by comparing data that ties together

72
0:04:00.889,000 --> 0:04:02,000
both density and diversity from what we hear,

73
0:04:03.689,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I'm able to arrive at much more precise fitness outcomes.

74
0:04:09.062,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And I want to show you some examples

75
0:04:11.102,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that typify the possibilities unlocked

76
0:04:13.892,000 --> 0:04:15,000
by diving into this universe.

77
0:04:16.914,000 --> 0:04:17,000
This is Lincoln Meadow.

78
0:04:18.306,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Lincoln Meadow's a three-and-a-half-hour drive

79
0:04:20.521,000 --> 0:04:22,000
east of San Francisco in the Sierra Nevada Mountains,

80
0:04:23.414,000 --> 0:04:25,000
at about 2,000 meters altitude,

81
0:04:25.511,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and I've been recording there for many years.

82
0:04:28.32,000 --> 0:04:31,000
In 1988, a logging company convinced local residents

83
0:04:32.24,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that there would be absolutely no environmental impact

84
0:04:35.402,000 --> 0:04:36,000
from a new method they were trying

85
0:04:37.046,000 --> 0:04:38,000
called "selective logging,"

86
0:04:38.766,000 --> 0:04:39,000
taking out a tree here and there

87
0:04:40.321,000 --> 0:04:43,000
rather than clear-cutting a whole area.

88
0:04:43.604,000 --> 0:04:44,000
With permission granted to record

89
0:04:45.364,000 --> 0:04:46,000
both before and after the operation,

90
0:04:47.327,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I set up my gear and captured a large number of dawn choruses

91
0:04:51.945,000 --> 0:04:54,000
to very strict protocol and calibrated recordings,

92
0:04:55.478,000 --> 0:04:57,000
because I wanted a really good baseline.

93
0:04:57.672,000 --> 0:04:59,000
This is an example of a spectrogram.

94
0:04:59.857,000 --> 0:05:01,000
A spectrogram is a graphic illustration of sound

95
0:05:02.288,000 --> 0:05:05,000
with time from left to right across the page --

96
0:05:05.461,000 --> 0:05:07,000
15 seconds in this case is represented —

97
0:05:07.968,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and frequency from the bottom of the page to the top,

98
0:05:10.823,000 --> 0:05:11,000
lowest to highest.

99
0:05:12.042,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And you can see that the signature of a stream

100
0:05:15.176,000 --> 0:05:19,000
is represented here in the bottom third or half of the page,

101
0:05:19.981,000 --> 0:05:22,000
while birds that were once in that meadow

102
0:05:23.424,000 --> 0:05:26,000
are represented in the signature across the top.

103
0:05:26.481,000 --> 0:05:27,000
There were a lot of them.

104
0:05:27.636,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And here's Lincoln Meadow before selective logging.

105
0:05:30.8,000 --> 0:05:44,000
(Nature sounds)

106
0:05:45.593,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Well, a year later I returned,

107
0:05:47.471,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and using the same protocols

108
0:05:49.228,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and recording under the same conditions,

109
0:05:51.943,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I recorded a number of examples

110
0:05:54.171,000 --> 0:05:56,000
of the same dawn choruses,

111
0:05:56.271,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and now this is what we've got.

112
0:05:58.414,000 --> 0:05:59,000
This is after selective logging.

113
0:05:59.694,000 --> 0:06:01,000
You can see that the stream is still represented

114
0:06:02.004,000 --> 0:06:03,000
in the bottom third of the page,

115
0:06:03.674,000 --> 0:06:07,000
but notice what's missing in the top two thirds.

116
0:06:08.177,000 --> 0:06:13,000
(Nature sounds)

117
0:06:13.69,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Coming up is the sound of a woodpecker.

118
0:06:23.177,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Well, I've returned to Lincoln Meadow 15 times

119
0:06:25.767,000 --> 0:06:26,000
in the last 25 years,

120
0:06:27.251,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and I can tell you that the biophony,

121
0:06:30.937,000 --> 0:06:32,000
the density and diversity of that biophony,

122
0:06:33.842,000 --> 0:06:35,000
has not yet returned to anything like it was

123
0:06:36.394,000 --> 0:06:38,000
before the operation.

124
0:06:38.592,000 --> 0:06:41,000
But here's a picture of Lincoln Meadow taken after,

125
0:06:41.69,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and you can see that from the perspective of the camera

126
0:06:44.928,000 --> 0:06:45,000
or the human eye,

127
0:06:46.039,000 --> 0:06:48,000
hardly a stick or a tree appears to be out of place,

128
0:06:48.814,000 --> 0:06:5,000
which would confirm the logging company's contention

129
0:06:51.754,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that there's nothing of environmental impact.

130
0:06:54.383,000 --> 0:07:,000
However, our ears tell us a very different story.

131
0:07:00.8,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Young students are always asking me

132
0:07:02.627,000 --> 0:07:03,000
what these animals are saying,

133
0:07:04.08,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and really I've got no idea.

134
0:07:08.911,000 --> 0:07:13,000
But I can tell you that they do express themselves.

135
0:07:14.18,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Whether or not we understand it is a different story.

136
0:07:17.258,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I was walking along the shore in Alaska,

137
0:07:19.586,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and I came across this tide pool

138
0:07:21.93,000 --> 0:07:24,000
filled with a colony of sea anemones,

139
0:07:24.962,000 --> 0:07:26,000
these wonderful eating machines,

140
0:07:27.038,000 --> 0:07:29,000
relatives of coral and jellyfish.

141
0:07:29.889,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And curious to see if any of them made any noise,

142
0:07:32.247,000 --> 0:07:33,000
I dropped a hydrophone,

143
0:07:33.418,000 --> 0:07:35,000
an underwater microphone covered in rubber,

144
0:07:36.41,000 --> 0:07:37,000
down the mouth part,

145
0:07:37.598,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and immediately the critter began

146
0:07:39.359,000 --> 0:07:41,000
to absorb the microphone into its belly,

147
0:07:41.568,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and the tentacles were searching out of the surface

148
0:07:44.262,000 --> 0:07:46,000
for something of nutritional value.

149
0:07:46.673,000 --> 0:07:48,000
The static-like sounds that are very low,

150
0:07:49.178,000 --> 0:07:5,000
that you're going to hear right now.

151
0:07:51.182,000 --> 0:07:55,000
(Static sounds)

152
0:07:55.584,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Yeah, but watch. When it didn't find anything to eat --

153
0:07:58.451,000 --> 0:07:59,000
(Honking sound)

154
0:07:59.84,000 --> 0:08:01,000
(Laughter)

155
0:08:02.5,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I think that's an expression that can be understood

156
0:08:04.997,000 --> 0:08:05,000
in any language.

157
0:08:06.414,000 --> 0:08:1,000
(Laughter)

158
0:08:11.28,000 --> 0:08:12,000
At the end of its breeding cycle,

159
0:08:12.88,000 --> 0:08:14,000
the Great Basin Spadefoot toad

160
0:08:15.036,000 --> 0:08:17,000
digs itself down about a meter under

161
0:08:17.111,000 --> 0:08:2,000
the hard-panned desert soil of the American West,

162
0:08:20.261,000 --> 0:08:21,000
where it can stay for many seasons

163
0:08:22.14,000 --> 0:08:25,000
until conditions are just right for it to emerge again.

164
0:08:25.64,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And when there's enough moisture in the soil

165
0:08:27.76,000 --> 0:08:29,000
in the spring, frogs will dig themselves to the surface

166
0:08:30.555,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and gather around these large, vernal pools

167
0:08:34.626,000 --> 0:08:36,000
in great numbers.

168
0:08:36.663,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And they vocalize in a chorus

169
0:08:40.069,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that's absolutely in sync with one another.

170
0:08:43.277,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And they do that for two reasons.

171
0:08:44.873,000 --> 0:08:47,000
The first is competitive, because they're looking for mates,

172
0:08:48.302,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and the second is cooperative,

173
0:08:49.755,000 --> 0:08:51,000
because if they're all vocalizing in sync together,

174
0:08:52.236,000 --> 0:08:56,000
it makes it really difficult for predators like coyotes,

175
0:08:56.395,000 --> 0:09:,000
foxes and owls to single out any individual for a meal.

176
0:09:00.614,000 --> 0:09:03,000
This is a spectrogram of what the frog chorusing looks like

177
0:09:03.886,000 --> 0:09:05,000
when it's in a very healthy pattern.

178
0:09:06.147,000 --> 0:09:15,000
(Frogs croaking)

179
0:09:16.163,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Mono Lake is just to the east of Yosemite National Park

180
0:09:20.128,000 --> 0:09:21,000
in California,

181
0:09:21.957,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and it's a favorite habitat of these toads,

182
0:09:24.812,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and it's also favored by U.S. Navy jet pilots,

183
0:09:27.699,000 --> 0:09:3,000
who train in their fighters flying them at speeds

184
0:09:30.745,000 --> 0:09:32,000
exceeding 1,100 kilometers an hour

185
0:09:33.203,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and altitudes only a couple hundred meters

186
0:09:35.984,000 --> 0:09:37,000
above ground level of the Mono Basin,

187
0:09:38.563,000 --> 0:09:41,000
very fast, very low, and so loud

188
0:09:42.237,000 --> 0:09:44,000
that the anthrophony, the human noise,

189
0:09:45.103,000 --> 0:09:47,000
even though it's six and a half kilometers

190
0:09:47.127,000 --> 0:09:49,000
from the frog pond you just heard a second ago,

191
0:09:49.927,000 --> 0:09:52,000
it masked the sound of the chorusing toads.

192
0:09:53.493,000 --> 0:09:56,000
You can see in this spectrogram that all of the energy

193
0:09:56.759,000 --> 0:09:58,000
that was once in the first spectrogram is gone

194
0:09:59.506,000 --> 0:10:,000
from the top end of the spectrogram,

195
0:10:01.253,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and that there's breaks in the chorusing at two and a half,

196
0:10:04.087,000 --> 0:10:06,000
four and a half, and six and a half seconds,

197
0:10:06.279,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and then the sound of the jet, the signature,

198
0:10:09.378,000 --> 0:10:11,000
is in yellow at the very bottom of the page.

199
0:10:11.937,000 --> 0:10:2,000
(Frogs croaking)

200
0:10:21.582,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Now at the end of that flyby,

201
0:10:23.976,000 --> 0:10:26,000
it took the frogs fully 45 minutes

202
0:10:27.465,000 --> 0:10:29,000
to regain their chorusing synchronicity,

203
0:10:29.869,000 --> 0:10:31,000
during which time, and under a full moon,

204
0:10:32.814,000 --> 0:10:34,000
we watched as two coyotes and a great horned owl

205
0:10:35.595,000 --> 0:10:38,000
came in to pick off a few of their numbers.

206
0:10:38.718,000 --> 0:10:41,000
The good news is that, with a little bit of habitat restoration

207
0:10:42.244,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and fewer flights, the frog populations,

208
0:10:44.949,000 --> 0:10:47,000
once diminishing during the 1980s and early '90s,

209
0:10:48.672,000 --> 0:10:51,000
have pretty much returned to normal.

210
0:10:52.205,000 --> 0:10:54,000
I want to end with a story told by a beaver.

211
0:10:55.144,000 --> 0:10:56,000
It's a very sad story,

212
0:10:56.618,000 --> 0:10:59,000
but it really illustrates how animals

213
0:11:00.496,000 --> 0:11:01,000
can sometimes show emotion,

214
0:11:02.478,000 --> 0:11:06,000
a very controversial subject among some older biologists.

215
0:11:07.13,000 --> 0:11:1,000
A colleague of mine was recording in the American Midwest

216
0:11:10.363,000 --> 0:11:12,000
around this pond that had been formed

217
0:11:12.905,000 --> 0:11:15,000
maybe 16,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age.

218
0:11:16.804,000 --> 0:11:18,000
It was also formed in part by a beaver dam

219
0:11:18.957,000 --> 0:11:2,000
at one end that held that whole ecosystem together

220
0:11:21.875,000 --> 0:11:23,000
in a very delicate balance.

221
0:11:24.627,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And one afternoon, while he was recording,

222
0:11:28.402,000 --> 0:11:31,000
there suddenly appeared from out of nowhere

223
0:11:32.226,000 --> 0:11:34,000
a couple of game wardens,

224
0:11:34.674,000 --> 0:11:35,000
who for no apparent reason,

225
0:11:36.269,000 --> 0:11:37,000
walked over to the beaver dam,

226
0:11:37.848,000 --> 0:11:4,000
dropped a stick of dynamite down it, blowing it up,

227
0:11:41.13,000 --> 0:11:45,000
killing the female and her young babies.

228
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Horrified, my colleagues remained behind

229
0:11:47.992,000 --> 0:11:49,000
to gather his thoughts

230
0:11:50.033,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and to record whatever he could the rest of the afternoon,

231
0:11:53.517,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and that evening, he captured a remarkable event:

232
0:11:58.41,000 --> 0:12:02,000
the lone surviving male beaver swimming in slow circles

233
0:12:02.599,000 --> 0:12:07,000
crying out inconsolably for its lost mate and offspring.

234
0:12:08.332,000 --> 0:12:1,000
This is probably the saddest sound

235
0:12:11.241,000 --> 0:12:13,000
I've ever heard coming from any organism,

236
0:12:14.159,000 --> 0:12:16,000
human or other.

237
0:12:18.517,000 --> 0:12:33,000
(Beaver crying)

238
0:12:34.18,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Yeah. Well.

239
0:12:35.995,000 --> 0:12:37,000
There are many facets to soundscapes,

240
0:12:38.577,000 --> 0:12:41,000
among them the ways in which animals taught us to dance and sing,

241
0:12:41.793,000 --> 0:12:43,000
which I'll save for another time.

242
0:12:44.418,000 --> 0:12:46,000
But you have heard how biophonies

243
0:12:47.436,000 --> 0:12:5,000
help clarify our understanding of the natural world.

244
0:12:51.279,000 --> 0:12:53,000
You've heard the impact of resource extraction,

245
0:12:53.743,000 --> 0:12:56,000
human noise and habitat destruction.

246
0:12:56.807,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And where environmental sciences have typically

247
0:12:59.07,000 --> 0:13:02,000
tried to understand the world from what we see,

248
0:13:02.127,000 --> 0:13:06,000
a much fuller understanding can be got from what we hear.

249
0:13:06.595,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Biophonies and geophonies are the signature voices

250
0:13:10.452,000 --> 0:13:11,000
of the natural world,

251
0:13:12.443,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and as we hear them,

252
0:13:13.796,000 --> 0:13:15,000
we're endowed with a sense of place,

253
0:13:16.468,000 --> 0:13:19,000
the true story of the world we live in.

254
0:13:19.885,000 --> 0:13:2,000
In a matter of seconds,

255
0:13:21.804,000 --> 0:13:23,000
a soundscape reveals much more information

256
0:13:24.519,000 --> 0:13:25,000
from many perspectives,

257
0:13:26.067,000 --> 0:13:3,000
from quantifiable data to cultural inspiration.

258
0:13:30.689,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Visual capture implicitly frames

259
0:13:33.59,000 --> 0:13:36,000
a limited frontal perspective of a given spatial context,

260
0:13:37.586,000 --> 0:13:39,000
while soundscapes widen that scope

261
0:13:39.959,000 --> 0:13:44,000
to a full 360 degrees, completely enveloping us.

262
0:13:45.144,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And while a picture may be worth 1,000 words,

263
0:13:48.916,000 --> 0:13:52,000
a soundscape is worth 1,000 pictures.

264
0:13:53.289,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And our ears tell us

265
0:13:55.413,000 --> 0:13:58,000
that the whisper of every leaf and creature

266
0:13:59.008,000 --> 0:14:02,000
speaks to the natural sources of our lives,

267
0:14:02.082,000 --> 0:14:07,000
which indeed may hold the secrets of love for all things,

268
0:14:07.144,000 --> 0:14:08,000
especially our own humanity,

269
0:14:09.102,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and the last word goes to a jaguar from the Amazon.

270
0:14:15.387,000 --> 0:14:28,000
(Growling)

271
0:14:29.135,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Thank you for listening.

272
0:14:31.335,000 --> 0:14:36,000
(Applause)

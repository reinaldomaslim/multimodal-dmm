1
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Good morning everyone. First of all, it's been fantastic

2
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:33,000
being here over these past few days.

3
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And secondly, I feel it's a great honor to kind of wind up

4
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:39,000
this extraordinary gathering of people,

5
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:42,000
these amazing talks that we've had.

6
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I feel that I've fitted in, in many ways,

7
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to some of the things that I've heard.

8
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I came directly here

9
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:56,000
from the deep, deep tropical rainforest in Ecuador,

10
0:00:57,000 --> 0:01:,000
where I was out -- you could only get there by a plane --

11
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:03,000
with indigenous people with paint on their faces

12
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and parrot feathers on their headdresses,

13
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:11,000
where these people are fighting to try and keep the oil companies,

14
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and keep the roads, out of their forests.

15
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:19,000
They're fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest

16
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:22,000
in a world that's clean, a world that isn't contaminated,

17
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:25,000
a world that isn't polluted.

18
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And what was so amazing to me, and what fits right in

19
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:31,000
with what we're all talking about here at TED,

20
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:34,000
is that there, right in the middle of this rainforest,

21
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:38,000
was some solar panels -- the first in that part of Ecuador --

22
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and that was mainly to bring water up by pump

23
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:44,000
so that the women wouldn't have to go down.

24
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:47,000
The water was cleaned, but because they got a lot of batteries,

25
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:5,000
they were able to store a lot of electricity.

26
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So every house -- and there were, I think, eight houses

27
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:55,000
in this little community -- could have light

28
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:57,000
for, I think it was about half an hour each evening.

29
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And there is the Chief, in all his regal finery, with a laptop computer.

30
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:06,000
(Laughter)

31
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And this man, he has been outside, but he's gone back,

32
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and he was saying, "You know, we have suddenly jumped into

33
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:21,000
a whole new era, and we didn't even know about the white man

34
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:24,000
50 years ago, and now here we are with laptop computers,

35
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and there are some things we want to learn from the modern world.

36
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:3,000
We want to know about health care.

37
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:34,000
We want to know about what other people do -- we're interested in it.

38
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And we want to learn other languages.

39
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:4,000
We want to know English and French and perhaps Chinese,

40
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and we're good at languages."

41
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So there he is with his little laptop computer,

42
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:5,000
but fighting against the might of the pressures --

43
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:53,000
because of the debt, the foreign debt of Ecuador --

44
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:57,000
fighting the pressure of World Bank, IMF, and of course

45
0:02:57,000 --> 0:03:01,000
the people who want to exploit the forests and take out the oil.

46
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And so, coming directly from there to here.

47
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:09,000
But, of course, my real field of expertise

48
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:13,000
lies in an even different kind of civilization --

49
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I can't really call it a civilization.

50
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
A different way of life, a different being.

51
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We've talked earlier -- this wonderful talk by Wade Davis

52
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:28,000
about the different cultures of the humans around the world --

53
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:33,000
but the world is not composed only of human beings;

54
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
there are also other animal beings.

55
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And I propose to bring into this TED conference,

56
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:42,000
as I always do around the world, the voice of the animal kingdom.

57
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Too often we just see a few slides, or a bit of film,

58
0:03:45,000 --> 0:03:48,000
but these beings have voices that mean something.

59
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And so, I want to give you a greeting,

60
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:53,000
as from a chimpanzee in the forests of Tanzania --

61
0:03:54,000 --> 0:04:,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

62
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:09,000
(Applause)

63
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I've been studying chimpanzees in Tanzania since 1960.

64
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:19,000
During that time, there have been modern technologies

65
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that have really transformed the way

66
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that field biologists do their work.

67
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:27,000
For example, for the first time, a few years ago,

68
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:3,000
by simply collecting little fecal samples

69
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:35,000
we were able to have them analyzed -- to have DNA profiling done --

70
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:39,000
so for the first time, we actually know which male chimps

71
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:42,000
are the fathers of each individual infant.

72
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Because the chimps have a very promiscuous mating society.

73
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So this opens up a whole new avenue of research.

74
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And we use GSI -- geographic whatever it is, GSI --

75
0:04:56,000 --> 0:05:,000
to determine the range of the chimps.

76
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And we're using -- you can see that I'm not really into this kind of stuff --

77
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:09,000
but we're using satellite imagery

78
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:12,000
to look at the deforestation in the area.

79
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And of course, there's developments in infrared,

80
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:17,000
so you can watch animals at night,

81
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and equipment for recording by video,

82
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and tape recording is getting lighter and better.

83
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So in many, many ways, we can do things today

84
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
that we couldn't do when I began in 1960.

85
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Especially when chimpanzees, and other animals

86
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:36,000
with large brains, are studied in captivity,

87
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:41,000
modern technology is helping us to search

88
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:45,000
for the upper levels of cognition in some of these non-human animals.

89
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So that we know today, they're capable of performances

90
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:51,000
that would have been thought absolutely impossible

91
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:53,000
by science when I began.

92
0:05:54,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled

93
0:05:58,000 --> 0:06:02,000
in intellectual performance is one called Ai in Japan --

94
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:04,000
her name means love --

95
0:06:04,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and she has a wonderfully sensitive partner working with her.

96
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:1,000
She loves her computer --

97
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:13,000
she'll leave her big group, and her running water,

98
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and her trees and everything.

99
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And she'll come in to sit at this computer --

100
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:19,000
it's like a video game for a kid; she's hooked.

101
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:23,000
She's 28, by the way, and she does things with her computer screen

102
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and a touch pad that she can do faster than most humans.

103
0:06:29,000 --> 0:06:34,000
She does very complex tasks, and I haven't got time to go into them,

104
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:36,000
but the amazing thing about this female is

105
0:06:36,000 --> 0:06:4,000
she doesn't like making mistakes.

106
0:06:4,000 --> 0:06:43,000
If she has a bad run, and her score isn't good,

107
0:06:43,000 --> 0:06:45,000
she'll come and reach up and tap on the glass --

108
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:47,000
because she can't see the experimenter --

109
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:5,000
which is asking to have another go.

110
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And her concentration -- she's already concentrated hard

111
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:57,000
for 20 minutes or so, and now she wants to do it all over again,

112
0:06:57,000 --> 0:07:,000
just for the satisfaction of having done it better.

113
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And the food is not important -- she does get a tiny reward,

114
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:06,000
like one raisin for a correct response --

115
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:1,000
but she will do it for nothing, if you tell her beforehand.

116
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:15,000
So here we are, a chimpanzee using a computer.

117
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans also learn human sign language.

118
0:07:19,000 --> 0:07:24,000
But the point is that when I was first in Gombe in 1960 --

119
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I remember so well, so vividly, as though it was yesterday --

120
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:31,000
the first time, when I was going through the vegetation,

121
0:07:31,000 --> 0:07:34,000
the chimpanzees were still running away from me, for the most part,

122
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:38,000
although some were a little bit acclimatized --

123
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and I saw this dark shape, hunched over a termite mound,

124
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and I peered with my binoculars.

125
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:49,000
It was, fortunately, one adult male whom I'd named David Greybeard --

126
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and by the way, science at that time was telling me that I shouldn't name the chimps;

127
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:54,000
they should all have numbers; that was more scientific.

128
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Anyway, David Greybeard -- and I saw that

129
0:07:57,000 --> 0:08:01,000
he was picking little pieces of grass and using them

130
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:04,000
to fish termites from their underground nest.

131
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And not only that -- he would sometimes pick a leafy twig

132
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and strip the leaves --

133
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:12,000
modifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose --

134
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:14,000
the beginning of tool-making.

135
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:17,000
The reason this was so exciting and such a breakthrough

136
0:08:17,000 --> 0:08:2,000
is at that time, it was thought that humans,

137
0:08:2,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and only humans, used and made tools.

138
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:27,000
When I was at school, we were defined as man, the toolmaker.

139
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So that when Louis Leakey, my mentor, heard this news,

140
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:34,000
he said, "Ah, we must now redefine 'man,' redefine 'tool,'

141
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:37,000
or accept chimpanzees as humans."

142
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:39,000
(Laughter)

143
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:43,000
We now know that at Gombe alone, there are nine different ways

144
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:46,000
in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes.

145
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Moreover, we know that in different parts of Africa,

146
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:51,000
wherever chimps have been studied,

147
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:56,000
there are completely different tool-using behaviors.

148
0:08:56,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And because it seems that these patterns are passed

149
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:02,000
from one generation to the next, through observation,

150
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:07,000
imitation and practice -- that is a definition of human culture.

151
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:11,000
What we find is that over these 40-odd years

152
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:14,000
that I and others have been studying chimpanzees

153
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and the other great apes, and, as I say, other mammals

154
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:2,000
with complex brains and social systems,

155
0:09:2,000 --> 0:09:24,000
we have found that after all, there isn't a sharp line

156
0:09:24,000 --> 0:09:27,000
dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom.

157
0:09:27,000 --> 0:09:29,000
It's a very wuzzy line.

158
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:32,000
It's getting wuzzier all the time as we find animals doing things

159
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:37,000
that we, in our arrogance, used to think was just human.

160
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:41,000
The chimps -- there's no time to discuss their fascinating lives --

161
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:44,000
but they have this long childhood, five years

162
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:46,000
of suckling and sleeping with the mother,

163
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and then another three, four or five years

164
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:53,000
of emotional dependence on her, even when the next child is born.

165
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:56,000
The importance of learning in that time, when behavior is flexible --

166
0:09:56,000 --> 0:10:,000
and there's an awful lot to learn in chimpanzee society.

167
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:03,000
The long-term affectionate supportive bonds

168
0:10:03,000 --> 0:10:06,000
that develop throughout this long childhood with the mother,

169
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:08,000
with the brothers and sisters,

170
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and which can last through a lifetime,

171
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:13,000
which may be up to 60 years.

172
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:16,000
They can actually live longer than 60 in captivity,

173
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
so we've only done 40 years in the wild so far.

174
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism.

175
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:29,000
We find in their non-verbal communication -- this is very rich --

176
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:34,000
they have a lot of sounds, which they use in different circumstances,

177
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:36,000
but they also use touch, posture, gesture,

178
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and what do they do?

179
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:4,000
They kiss; they embrace; they hold hands.

180
0:10:4,000 --> 0:10:43,000
They pat one another on the back; they swagger; they shake their fist --

181
0:10:43,000 --> 0:10:46,000
the kind of things that we do,

182
0:10:46,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and they do them in the same kind of context.

183
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:51,000
They have very sophisticated cooperation.

184
0:10:51,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Sometimes they hunt -- not that often,

185
0:10:54,000 --> 0:10:57,000
but when they hunt, they show sophisticated cooperation,

186
0:10:57,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and they share the prey.

187
0:11:,000 --> 0:11:06,000
We find that they show emotions, similar to -- maybe sometimes the same --

188
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:11,000
as those that we describe in ourselves as happiness, sadness, fear, despair.

189
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:13,000
They know mental as well as physical suffering.

190
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And I don't have time to go into the information

191
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
that will prove some of these things to you,

192
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:22,000
save to say that there are very bright students, in the best universities,

193
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:26,000
studying emotions in animals, studying personalities in animals.

194
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
We know that chimpanzees and some other creatures

195
0:11:29,000 --> 0:11:34,000
can recognize themselves in mirrors -- "self" as opposed to "other."

196
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:38,000
They have a sense of humor, and these are the kind of things

197
0:11:38,000 --> 0:11:44,000
which traditionally have been thought of as human prerogatives.

198
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:49,000
But this teaches us a new respect -- and it's a new respect

199
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:52,000
not only for the chimpanzees, I suggest,

200
0:11:52,000 --> 0:11:56,000
but some of the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet.

201
0:11:56,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Once we're prepared to admit that after all,

202
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:02,000
we're not the only beings with personalities, minds

203
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and above all feelings, and then we start to think

204
0:12:04,000 --> 0:12:06,000
about ways we use and abuse

205
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:12,000
so many other sentient, sapient creatures on this planet,

206
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:17,000
it really gives cause for deep shame, at least for me.

207
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:23,000
So, the sad thing is that these chimpanzees --

208
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:27,000
who've perhaps taught us, more than any other creature, a little humility --

209
0:12:27,000 --> 0:12:3,000
are in the wild, disappearing very fast.

210
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:32,000
They're disappearing for the reasons

211
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:35,000
that all of you in this room know only too well.

212
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:4,000
The deforestation, the growth of human populations, needing more land.

213
0:12:4,000 --> 0:12:43,000
They're disappearing because some timber companies

214
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:45,000
go in with clear-cutting.

215
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:49,000
They're disappearing in the heart of their range in Africa

216
0:12:49,000 --> 0:12:54,000
because the big multinational logging companies have come in and made roads --

217
0:12:54,000 --> 0:12:56,000
as they want to do in Ecuador

218
0:12:56,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and other parts where the forests remain untouched --

219
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:03,000
to take out oil or timber.

220
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And this has led in Congo basin, and other parts of the world,

221
0:13:08,000 --> 0:13:1,000
to what is known as the bush-meat trade.

222
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:14,000
This means that although for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years,

223
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:18,000
people have lived in those forests, or whatever habitat it is,

224
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:21,000
in harmony with their world, just killing the animals they need

225
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:23,000
for themselves and their families --

226
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:26,000
now, suddenly, because of the roads,

227
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
the hunters can go in from the towns.

228
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:31,000
They shoot everything, every single thing that moves

229
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:36,000
that's bigger than a small rat; they sun-dry it or smoke it.

230
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And now they've got transport; they take it on the logging trucks

231
0:13:39,000 --> 0:13:43,000
or the mining trucks into the towns where they sell it.

232
0:13:43,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And people will pay more for bush-meat, as it's called,

233
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:51,000
than for domestic meat -- it's culturally preferred.

234
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And it's not sustainable, and the huge logging camps in the forest

235
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:59,000
are now demanding meat, so the Pygmy hunters in the Congo basin

236
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:03,000
who've lived there with their wonderful way of living

237
0:14:03,000 --> 0:14:06,000
for so many hundreds of years are now corrupted.

238
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:09,000
They're given weapons; they shoot for the logging camps; they get money.

239
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Their culture is being destroyed,

240
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:15,000
along with the animals upon whom they depend.

241
0:14:15,000 --> 0:14:18,000
So, when the logging camp moves, there's nothing left.

242
0:14:18,000 --> 0:14:21,000
We talked already about the loss of human cultural diversity,

243
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and I've seen it happening with my own eyes.

244
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And the grim picture in Africa -- I love Africa,

245
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and what do we see in Africa?

246
0:14:3,000 --> 0:14:33,000
We see deforestation;

247
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
we see the desert spreading; we see massive hunger;

248
0:14:38,000 --> 0:14:42,000
we see disease and we see population growth in areas

249
0:14:42,000 --> 0:14:46,000
where there are more people living on a certain piece of land

250
0:14:46,000 --> 0:14:48,000
than the land can possibly support,

251
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and they're too poor to buy food from elsewhere.

252
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Were the people that we heard about yesterday,

253
0:14:54,000 --> 0:14:58,000
on the Easter Island, who cut down their last tree -- were they stupid?

254
0:14:58,000 --> 0:15:,000
Didn't they know what was happening?

255
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Of course, but if you've seen the crippling poverty

256
0:15:02,000 --> 0:15:04,000
in some of these parts of the world

257
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:07,000
it isn't a question of "Let's leave the tree for tomorrow."

258
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:09,000
"How am I going to feed my family today?

259
0:15:09,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Maybe I can get just a few dollars from this last tree

260
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:14,000
which will keep us going a little bit longer,

261
0:15:14,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and then we'll pray that something will happen

262
0:15:17,000 --> 0:15:2,000
to save us from the inevitable end."

263
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:23,000
So, this is a pretty grim picture.

264
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:27,000
The one thing we have, which makes us so different

265
0:15:27,000 --> 0:15:29,000
from chimpanzees or other living creatures,

266
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:32,000
is this sophisticated spoken language --

267
0:15:32,000 --> 0:15:34,000
a language with which we can tell children

268
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:36,000
about things that aren't here.

269
0:15:36,000 --> 0:15:4,000
We can talk about the distant past, plan for the distant future,

270
0:15:4,000 --> 0:15:42,000
discuss ideas with each other,

271
0:15:42,000 --> 0:15:46,000
so that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group.

272
0:15:46,000 --> 0:15:48,000
We can do it by talking to each other;

273
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:52,000
we can do it through video; we can do it through the written word.

274
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:57,000
And we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards,

275
0:15:57,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and we're destroying the world.

276
0:15:59,000 --> 0:16:02,000
In the developed world, in a way, it's worse,

277
0:16:02,000 --> 0:16:05,000
because we have so much access to knowledge

278
0:16:05,000 --> 0:16:07,000
of the stupidity of what we're doing.

279
0:16:07,000 --> 0:16:1,000
Do you know, we're bringing little babies

280
0:16:1,000 --> 0:16:15,000
into a world where, in many places, the water is poisoning them?

281
0:16:15,000 --> 0:16:19,000
And the air is harming them, and the food that's grown

282
0:16:19,000 --> 0:16:22,000
from the contaminated land is poisoning them.

283
0:16:22,000 --> 0:16:26,000
And that's not just in the far-away developing world; that's everywhere.

284
0:16:26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Do you know we all have about 50 chemicals

285
0:16:28,000 --> 0:16:32,000
in our bodies we didn't have about 50 years ago?

286
0:16:32,000 --> 0:16:36,000
And so many of these diseases, like asthma

287
0:16:36,000 --> 0:16:39,000
and certain kinds of cancers, are on the increase

288
0:16:39,000 --> 0:16:44,000
around places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped.

289
0:16:44,000 --> 0:16:47,000
We're harming ourselves around the world,

290
0:16:47,000 --> 0:16:51,000
as well as harming the animals, as well as harming nature herself --

291
0:16:51,000 --> 0:16:54,000
Mother Nature, that brought us into being;

292
0:16:54,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Mother Nature, where I believe we need to spend time,

293
0:16:58,000 --> 0:17:,000
where there's trees and flowers and birds

294
0:17:,000 --> 0:17:03,000
for our good psychological development.

295
0:17:03,000 --> 0:17:06,000
And yet, there are hundreds and hundreds of children

296
0:17:06,000 --> 0:17:08,000
in the developed world who never see nature,

297
0:17:08,000 --> 0:17:1,000
because they're growing up in concrete

298
0:17:1,000 --> 0:17:12,000
and all they know is virtual reality,

299
0:17:12,000 --> 0:17:16,000
with no opportunity to go and lie in the sun,

300
0:17:16,000 --> 0:17:19,000
or in the forest, with the dappled sun-specks

301
0:17:19,000 --> 0:17:22,000
coming down from the canopy above.

302
0:17:22,000 --> 0:17:25,000
As I was traveling around the world, you know,

303
0:17:25,000 --> 0:17:28,000
I had to leave the forest -- that's where I love to be.

304
0:17:28,000 --> 0:17:31,000
I had to leave these fascinating chimpanzees

305
0:17:31,000 --> 0:17:35,000
for my students and field staff to continue studying

306
0:17:35,000 --> 0:17:38,000
because, finding they dwindled from about two million

307
0:17:38,000 --> 0:17:42,000
100 years ago to about 150,000 now,

308
0:17:42,000 --> 0:17:45,000
I knew I had to leave the forest to do what I could

309
0:17:45,000 --> 0:17:47,000
to raise awareness around the world.

310
0:17:47,000 --> 0:17:5,000
And the more I talked about the chimpanzees' plight,

311
0:17:5,000 --> 0:17:55,000
the more I realized the fact that everything's interconnected,

312
0:17:55,000 --> 0:17:57,000
and the problems of the developing world

313
0:17:57,000 --> 0:18:,000
so often stem from the greed of the developed world,

314
0:18:,000 --> 0:18:05,000
and everything was joining together, and making -- not sense,

315
0:18:05,000 --> 0:18:09,000
hope lies in sense, you said -- it's making a nonsense.

316
0:18:09,000 --> 0:18:1,000
How can we do it?

317
0:18:1,000 --> 0:18:12,000
Somebody said that yesterday.

318
0:18:12,000 --> 0:18:17,000
And as I was traveling around, I kept meeting young people who'd lost hope.

319
0:18:17,000 --> 0:18:2,000
They were feeling despair,

320
0:18:2,000 --> 0:18:23,000
they were feeling, "Well, it doesn't matter what we do;

321
0:18:23,000 --> 0:18:25,000
eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die.

322
0:18:25,000 --> 0:18:29,000
Everything is hopeless -- we're always being told so by the media."

323
0:18:29,000 --> 0:18:32,000
And then I met some who were angry,

324
0:18:32,000 --> 0:18:34,000
and anger that can turn to violence,

325
0:18:34,000 --> 0:18:37,000
and we're all familiar with that.

326
0:18:37,000 --> 0:18:41,000
And I have three little grandchildren,

327
0:18:41,000 --> 0:18:44,000
and when some of these students would say to me

328
0:18:44,000 --> 0:18:47,000
at high school or university, they'd say, "We're angry,"

329
0:18:47,000 --> 0:18:5,000
or "We're filled with despair, because we feel

330
0:18:5,000 --> 0:18:54,000
you've compromised our future, and there's nothing we can do about it."

331
0:18:54,000 --> 0:18:56,000
And I looked in the eyes of my little grandchildren,

332
0:18:56,000 --> 0:19:,000
and think how much we've harmed this planet since I was their age.

333
0:19:,000 --> 0:19:06,000
I feel this deep shame, and that's why in 1991 in Tanzania,

334
0:19:06,000 --> 0:19:09,000
I started a program that's called Roots and Shoots.

335
0:19:09,000 --> 0:19:13,000
There's little brochures all around outside,

336
0:19:13,000 --> 0:19:17,000
and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future,

337
0:19:17,000 --> 0:19:2,000
I beg that you pick up that brochure.

338
0:19:2,000 --> 0:19:24,000
And Roots and Shoots is a program for hope.

339
0:19:24,000 --> 0:19:26,000
Roots make a firm foundation.

340
0:19:26,000 --> 0:19:28,000
Shoots seem tiny,

341
0:19:28,000 --> 0:19:31,000
but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls.

342
0:19:31,000 --> 0:19:33,000
See the brick walls as all the problems

343
0:19:33,000 --> 0:19:35,000
that we've inflicted on this planet.

344
0:19:35,000 --> 0:19:39,000
Then, you see, it is a message of hope.

345
0:19:39,000 --> 0:19:41,000
Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world

346
0:19:41,000 --> 0:19:45,000
can break through, and can make this a better world.

347
0:19:45,000 --> 0:19:48,000
And the most important message of Roots and Shoots

348
0:19:48,000 --> 0:19:52,000
is that every single individual makes a difference.

349
0:19:52,000 --> 0:19:54,000
Every individual has a role to play.

350
0:19:54,000 --> 0:19:58,000
Every one of us impacts the world around us everyday,

351
0:19:58,000 --> 0:20:01,000
and you scientists know that you can't actually --

352
0:20:01,000 --> 0:20:04,000
even if you stay in bed all day, you're breathing oxygen

353
0:20:04,000 --> 0:20:08,000
and giving out CO2, and probably going to the loo,

354
0:20:08,000 --> 0:20:1,000
and things like that --

355
0:20:1,000 --> 0:20:12,000
you're making a difference in the world.

356
0:20:12,000 --> 0:20:15,000
So, the Roots and Shoots program

357
0:20:15,000 --> 0:20:2,000
involves youth in three kinds of projects.

358
0:20:2,000 --> 0:20:24,000
And these are projects to make the world around them a better place.

359
0:20:24,000 --> 0:20:3,000
One project to show care and concern for your own human community.

360
0:20:3,000 --> 0:20:34,000
One for animals, including domestic animals -- and I have to say,

361
0:20:34,000 --> 0:20:36,000
I learned everything I know about animal behavior

362
0:20:36,000 --> 0:20:4,000
even before I got to Gombe and the chimps from my dog, Rusty,

363
0:20:4,000 --> 0:20:43,000
who was my childhood companion.

364
0:20:43,000 --> 0:20:47,000
And the third kind of project: something for the local environment.

365
0:20:48,000 --> 0:20:52,000
So what the kids do depends first of all, how old are they --

366
0:20:52,000 --> 0:20:56,000
and we go now from pre-school right through university.

367
0:20:56,000 --> 0:20:59,000
It's going to depend whether they're inner-city or rural.

368
0:20:59,000 --> 0:21:04,000
It's going to depend if they're wealthy or impoverished.

369
0:21:04,000 --> 0:21:07,000
It's going to depend which part, say, of America they're in.

370
0:21:07,000 --> 0:21:1,000
We're in every state now, and the problems in Florida

371
0:21:1,000 --> 0:21:12,000
are different from the problems in New York.

372
0:21:13,000 --> 0:21:15,000
It's going to depend on which country they're in --

373
0:21:15,000 --> 0:21:21,000
and we're already in 60-plus countries, with about 5,000 active groups --

374
0:21:21,000 --> 0:21:25,000
and there are groups all over the place that I keep hearing about

375
0:21:25,000 --> 0:21:28,000
that I've never even heard of, because the kids are taking the program

376
0:21:28,000 --> 0:21:3,000
and spreading it themselves.

377
0:21:3,000 --> 0:21:32,000
Why?

378
0:21:32,000 --> 0:21:34,000
Because they're buying into it,

379
0:21:34,000 --> 0:21:37,000
and they're the ones who get to decide what they're going to do.

380
0:21:37,000 --> 0:21:39,000
It isn't something that their parents tell them,

381
0:21:39,000 --> 0:21:41,000
or their teachers tell them.

382
0:21:41,000 --> 0:21:44,000
That's effective, but if they decide themselves,

383
0:21:44,000 --> 0:21:47,000
"We want to clean this river

384
0:21:47,000 --> 0:21:49,000
and put the fish back that used to be there.

385
0:21:49,000 --> 0:21:54,000
We want to clear away the toxic soil

386
0:21:54,000 --> 0:21:56,000
from this area and have an organic garden.

387
0:21:56,000 --> 0:21:59,000
We want to go and spend time with the old people

388
0:21:59,000 --> 0:22:03,000
and hear their stories and record their oral histories.

389
0:22:04,000 --> 0:22:06,000
We want to go and work in a dog shelter.

390
0:22:06,000 --> 0:22:08,000
We want to learn about animals. We want ... "

391
0:22:08,000 --> 0:22:12,000
You know, it goes on and on, and this is very hopeful for me.

392
0:22:12,000 --> 0:22:16,000
As I travel around the world 300 days a year,

393
0:22:16,000 --> 0:22:19,000
everywhere there's a group of Roots and Shoots of different ages.

394
0:22:19,000 --> 0:22:21,000
Everywhere there are children with shining eyes saying,

395
0:22:21,000 --> 0:22:24,000
"Look at the difference we've made."

396
0:22:24,000 --> 0:22:26,000
And now comes the technology into it,

397
0:22:26,000 --> 0:22:31,000
because with this new way of communicating electronically

398
0:22:31,000 --> 0:22:35,000
these kids can communicate with each other around the world.

399
0:22:35,000 --> 0:22:38,000
And if anyone is interested to help us, we've got so many ideas

400
0:22:38,000 --> 0:22:44,000
but we need help -- we need help to create the right kind of system

401
0:22:44,000 --> 0:22:48,000
that will help these young people to communicate their excitement.

402
0:22:48,000 --> 0:22:53,000
But also -- and this is so important -- to communicate their despair,

403
0:22:53,000 --> 0:22:56,000
to say, "We've tried this and it doesn't work, and what shall we do?"

404
0:22:56,000 --> 0:23:,000
And then, lo and behold, there's another group answering these kids

405
0:23:,000 --> 0:23:03,000
who may be in America, or maybe this is a group in Israel,

406
0:23:03,000 --> 0:23:08,000
saying, "Yeah, you did it a little bit wrong. This is how you should do it."

407
0:23:08,000 --> 0:23:11,000
The philosophy is very simple.

408
0:23:11,000 --> 0:23:14,000
We do not believe in violence.

409
0:23:14,000 --> 0:23:17,000
No violence, no bombs, no guns.

410
0:23:17,000 --> 0:23:19,000
That's not the way to solve problems.

411
0:23:19,000 --> 0:23:23,000
Violence leads to violence, at least in my view.

412
0:23:23,000 --> 0:23:25,000
So how do we solve?

413
0:23:25,000 --> 0:23:3,000
The tools for solving the problems are knowledge and understanding.

414
0:23:3,000 --> 0:23:33,000
Know the facts, but see how they fit in the big picture.

415
0:23:33,000 --> 0:23:36,000
Hard work and persistence --don't give up --

416
0:23:36,000 --> 0:23:41,000
and love and compassion leading to respect for all life.

417
0:23:41,000 --> 0:23:43,000
How many more minutes? Two, one?

418
0:23:43,000 --> 0:23:45,000
Chris Anderson: One -- one to two.

419
0:23:45,000 --> 0:23:47,000
Jane Goodall: Two, two, I'm going to take two.

420
0:23:47,000 --> 0:23:48,000
(Laughter)

421
0:23:48,000 --> 0:23:5,000
Are you going to come and drag me off?

422
0:23:5,000 --> 0:23:52,000
(Laughter)

423
0:23:52,000 --> 0:23:56,000
Anyway -- so basically, Roots and Shoots

424
0:23:56,000 --> 0:23:59,000
is beginning to change young people's lives.

425
0:23:59,000 --> 0:24:03,000
It's what I'm devoting most of my energy to.

426
0:24:03,000 --> 0:24:1,000
And I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact,

427
0:24:1,000 --> 0:24:13,000
not just because you can share technology with us,

428
0:24:13,000 --> 0:24:16,000
but because so many of you have children.

429
0:24:16,000 --> 0:24:21,000
And if you take this program out, and give it to your children,

430
0:24:21,000 --> 0:24:25,000
they have such a good opportunity to go out and do good,

431
0:24:25,000 --> 0:24:27,000
because they've got parents like you.

432
0:24:27,000 --> 0:24:31,000
And it's been so clear how much you all care

433
0:24:31,000 --> 0:24:33,000
about trying to make this world a better place.

434
0:24:33,000 --> 0:24:35,000
It's very encouraging.

435
0:24:35,000 --> 0:24:37,000
But the kids do ask me --

436
0:24:37,000 --> 0:24:39,000
and this won't take more than two minutes, I promise --

437
0:24:39,000 --> 0:24:44,000
the kids say, "Dr. Jane, do you really have hope for the future?

438
0:24:44,000 --> 0:24:48,000
You travel, you see all these horrible things happening."

439
0:24:48,000 --> 0:24:52,000
Firstly, the human brain -- I don't need to say anything about that.

440
0:24:52,000 --> 0:24:55,000
Now that we know what the problems are around the world,

441
0:24:55,000 --> 0:24:59,000
human brains like yours are rising to solve those problems.

442
0:24:59,000 --> 0:25:01,000
And we've talked a lot about that.

443
0:25:01,000 --> 0:25:04,000
Secondly, the resilience of nature.

444
0:25:04,000 --> 0:25:06,000
We can destroy a river,

445
0:25:06,000 --> 0:25:08,000
and we can bring it back to life.

446
0:25:08,000 --> 0:25:13,000
We can see a whole area desolated,

447
0:25:13,000 --> 0:25:18,000
and it can be brought back to bloom again, with time or a little help.

448
0:25:18,000 --> 0:25:24,000
And thirdly, the last speaker talked about -- or the speaker before last,

449
0:25:24,000 --> 0:25:27,000
talked about the indomitable human spirit.

450
0:25:27,000 --> 0:25:31,000
We are surrounded by the most amazing people

451
0:25:31,000 --> 0:25:35,000
who do things that seem to be absolutely impossible.

452
0:25:35,000 --> 0:25:38,000
Nelson Mandela -- I take a little piece of limestone

453
0:25:38,000 --> 0:25:41,000
from Robben Island Prison, where he labored for 27 years,

454
0:25:41,000 --> 0:25:46,000
and came out with so little bitterness, he could lead his people

455
0:25:46,000 --> 0:25:49,000
from the horror of apartheid without a bloodbath.

456
0:25:49,000 --> 0:25:53,000
Even after the 11th of September -- and I was in New York

457
0:25:53,000 --> 0:25:59,000
and I felt the fear -- nevertheless, there was so much human courage,

458
0:25:59,000 --> 0:26:02,000
so much love and so much compassion.

459
0:26:02,000 --> 0:26:06,000
And then as I went around the country after that and felt the fear --

460
0:26:06,000 --> 0:26:08,000
the fear that was leading to people feeling

461
0:26:08,000 --> 0:26:1,000
they couldn't worry about the environment any more,

462
0:26:1,000 --> 0:26:13,000
in case they seemed not to be patriotic --

463
0:26:13,000 --> 0:26:15,000
and I was trying to encourage them,

464
0:26:15,000 --> 0:26:18,000
somebody came up with a little quotation from Mahatma Gandhi,

465
0:26:18,000 --> 0:26:21,000
"If you look back through human history,

466
0:26:21,000 --> 0:26:24,000
you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good."

467
0:26:25,000 --> 0:26:29,000
And just after that a woman brought me this little bell,

468
0:26:29,000 --> 0:26:31,000
and I want to end on this note.

469
0:26:31,000 --> 0:26:34,000
She said, "If you're talking about hope and peace, ring this.

470
0:26:36,000 --> 0:26:42,000
This bell is made from metal from a defused landmine,

471
0:26:42,000 --> 0:26:45,000
from the killing fields of Pol Pot --

472
0:26:45,000 --> 0:26:48,000
one of the most evil regimes in human history --

473
0:26:48,000 --> 0:26:52,000
where people are now beginning to put their lives back together

474
0:26:52,000 --> 0:26:55,000
after the regime has crumbled.

475
0:26:55,000 --> 0:26:59,000
So, yes, there is hope, and where is the hope?

476
0:26:59,000 --> 0:27:02,000
Is it out there with the politicians?

477
0:27:03,000 --> 0:27:05,000
It's in our hands.

478
0:27:05,000 --> 0:27:07,000
It's in your hands and my hands

479
0:27:07,000 --> 0:27:09,000
and those of our children.

480
0:27:09,000 --> 0:27:11,000
It's really up to us.

481
0:27:11,000 --> 0:27:13,000
We're the ones who can make a difference.

482
0:27:13,000 --> 0:27:15,000
If we lead lives where we consciously leave

483
0:27:15,000 --> 0:27:19,000
the lightest possible ecological footprints,

484
0:27:19,000 --> 0:27:22,000
if we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy

485
0:27:22,000 --> 0:27:25,000
and don't buy the things that are not,

486
0:27:25,000 --> 0:27:28,000
we can change the world overnight.

487
0:27:28,000 --> 0:27:29,000
Thank you.

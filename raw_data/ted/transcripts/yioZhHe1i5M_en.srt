1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
As technology progresses,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and as it advances,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
many of us assume that these advances

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
make us more intelligent,

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
make us smarter and more connected to the world.

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And what I'd like to argue

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
is that that's not necessarily the case,

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
as progress is simply a word for change,

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and with change you gain something,

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
but you also lose something.

11
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And to really illustrate this point, what I'd like to do

12
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
is to show you how technology has dealt with

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
a very simple, a very common, an everyday question.

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And that question is this.

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
What time is it? What time is it?

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
If you glance at your iPhone, it's so simple to tell the time.

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
But, I'd like to ask you, how would you tell the time

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
if you didn't have an iPhone?

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
How would you tell the time, say, 600 years ago?

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
How would you do it?

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Well, the way you would do it is by using a device

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that's called an astrolabe.

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
So, an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today's world.

24
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
But, at the time, in the 13th century,

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
it was the gadget of the day.

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
It was the world's first popular computer.

27
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And it was a device that, in fact, is a model of the sky.

28
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So, the different parts of the astrolabe, in this particular type,

29
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
the rete corresponds to the positions of the stars.

30
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
The plate corresponds to a coordinate system.

31
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And the mater has some scales and puts it all together.

32
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
If you were an educated child,

33
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
you would know how to not only use the astrolabe,

34
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
you would also know how to make an astrolabe.

35
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And we know this because the first treatise on the astrolabe,

36
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
the first technical manual in the English language,

37
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
was written by Geoffrey Chaucer.

38
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Yes, that Geoffrey Chaucer, in 1391,

39
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
to his little Lewis, his 11-year-old son.

40
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And in this book, little Lewis would know the big idea.

41
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And the central idea that makes this computer work

42
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
is this thing called stereographic projection.

43
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And basically, the concept is,

44
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
how do you represent the three-dimensional image

45
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
of the night sky that surrounds us

46
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
onto a flat, portable, two-dimensional surface.

47
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
The idea is actually relatively simple.

48
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Imagine that that Earth is at the center of the universe,

49
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere.

50
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Each point on the surface of the sphere

51
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
is mapped through the bottom pole,

52
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
onto a flat surface, where it is then recorded.

53
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So the North Star corresponds to the center of the device.

54
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
The ecliptic, which is the path of the sun, moon, and planets

55
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
correspond to an offset circle.

56
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
The bright stars correspond to little daggers on the rete.

57
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And the altitude corresponds to the plate system.

58
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Now, the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection.

59
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
The real genius is that it brings together two coordinate systems

60
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
so they fit perfectly.

61
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
There is the position of the sun, moon and planets on the movable rete.

62
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And then there is their location on the sky

63
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
as seen from a certain latitude on the back plate. Okay?

64
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
So how would you use this device?

65
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Well, let me first back up for a moment.

66
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
This is an astrolabe. Pretty impressive, isn't it?

67
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And so, this astrolabe is on loan from us

68
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
from the Oxford School of -- Museum of History.

69
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And you can see the different components.

70
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
This is the mater, the scales on the back.

71
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
This is the rete. Okay. Do you see that?

72
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
That's the movable part of the sky.

73
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And in the back you can see

74
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
a spider web pattern.

75
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And that spider web pattern corresponds to the local coordinates in the sky.

76
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
This is a rule device. And on the back

77
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
are some other devices, measuring tools

78
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and scales, to be able to make some calculations. Okay?

79
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
You know, I've always wanted one of these.

80
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
For my thesis I actually built one of these out of paper.

81
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And this one, this is a replica

82
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
from a 15th-century device.

83
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And it's worth probably about three MacBook Pros.

84
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
But a real one would cost about as much as my house,

85
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and the house next to it, and actually every house on the block,

86
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
on both sides of the street,

87
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
maybe a school thrown in, and some -- you know, a church.

88
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
They are just incredibly expensive.

89
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
But let me show you how to work this device.

90
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So let's go to step one.

91
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
First thing that you do is you select a star

92
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
in the night sky, if you're telling time at night.

93
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So, tonight, if it's clear you'll be able to see the summer triangle.

94
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And there is a bright star called Deneb. So let's select Deneb.

95
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Second, is you measure the altitude of Deneb.

96
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So, step two, I hold the device up,

97
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and then I sight its altitude there

98
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
so I can see it clearly now.

99
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And then I measure its altitude.

100
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So, it's about 26 degrees. You can't see it from over there.

101
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Step three is identify the star on the front of the device.

102
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Deneb is there. I can tell.

103
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Step four is I then move the rete,

104
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
move the sky, so the altitude of the star

105
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
corresponds to the scale on the back.

106
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Okay, so when that happens

107
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
everything lines up.

108
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I have here a model of the sky

109
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
that corresponds to the real sky. Okay?

110
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So, it is, in a sense,

111
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
holding a model of the universe in my hands.

112
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And then finally, I take a rule,

113
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and move the rule to a date line

114
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
which then tells me the time here.

115
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Right. So, that's how the device is used.

116
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
(Laughter)

117
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So, I know what you're thinking:

118
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
"That's a lot of work, isn't it? Isn't it a ton of work to be able to tell the time?"

119
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
as you glance at your iPod to just check out the time.

120
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
But there is a difference between the two, because with your iPod

121
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
you can tell -- or your iPhone, you can tell exactly

122
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
what the time is, with precision.

123
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
The way little Lewis would tell the time

124
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
is by a picture of the sky.

125
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
He would know where things would fit in the sky.

126
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
He would not only know what time it was,

127
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
he would also know where the sun would rise,

128
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and how it would move across the sky.

129
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
He would know what time the sun would rise, and what time it would set.

130
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And he would know that for essentially every celestial object

131
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
in the heavens.

132
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
So, in computer graphics

133
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and computer user interface design,

134
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
there is a term called affordances.

135
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So, affordances are the qualities of an object

136
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that allow us to perform an action with it.

137
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And what the astrolabe does is it allows us,

138
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
it affords us, to connect to the night sky,

139
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
to look up into the night sky and be much more --

140
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
to see the visible and the invisible together.

141
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So, that's just one use. Incredible,

142
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
there is probably 350, 400 uses.

143
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
In fact, there is a text, and that has over a thousand uses

144
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
of this first computer.

145
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
On the back there is scales and measurements

146
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
for terrestrial navigation.

147
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
You can survey with it. The city of Baghdad was surveyed with it.

148
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
It can be used for calculating mathematical equations of all different types.

149
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And it would take a full university course to illustrate it.

150
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Astrolabes have an incredible history.

151
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
They are over 2,000 years old.

152
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
The concept of stereographic projection

153
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
originated in 330 B.C.

154
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And the astrolabes come in many different

155
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
sizes and shapes and forms.

156
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
There is portable ones. There is large display ones.

157
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And I think what is common to all astrolabes

158
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
is that they are beautiful works of art.

159
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
There is a quality of craftsmanship and precision

160
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that is just astonishing and remarkable.

161
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Astrolabes, like every technology, do evolve over time.

162
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
So, the earliest retes, for example, were very simple and primitive.

163
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And advancing retes became cultural emblems.

164
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
This is one from Oxford.

165
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And I find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern

166
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
is completely symmetrical,

167
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
and it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical, or random sky.

168
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
How cool is that? This is just amazing.

169
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So, would little Lewis have an astrolabe?

170
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Probably not one made of brass. He would have one made out of wood,

171
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
or paper. And the vast majority of this first computer

172
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
was a portable device

173
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that you could keep in the back of your pocket.

174
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So, what does the astrolabe inspire?

175
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Well, I think the first thing is that

176
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
it reminds us just how resourceful people were,

177
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
our forebears were, years and years ago.

178
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
It's just an incredible device.

179
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Every technology advances.

180
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Every technology is transformed and moved by others.

181
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And what we gain with a new technology, of course,

182
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
is precision and accuracy.

183
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
But what we lose, I think, is

184
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
an accurate -- a felt sense

185
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
of the sky, a sense of context.

186
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Knowing the sky, knowing your relationship with the sky,

187
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
is the center of the real answer

188
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
to knowing what time it is.

189
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So, it's -- I think astrolabes are just remarkable devices.

190
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And so, what can you learn from these devices?

191
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Well, primarily that there is a subtle knowledge

192
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
that we can connect with the world.

193
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And astrolabes return us to this subtle sense

194
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
of how things all fit together,

195
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and also how we connect to the world.

196
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Thanks very much.

197
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
